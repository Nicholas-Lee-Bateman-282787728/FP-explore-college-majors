The action and visuals are breathtaking.It begins with Kirk and Bones running and the running never stops in this fast paced ""energized"" film.It's a great film. The acting by it's entire cast is superb.The special effects are amazing and beautiful to behold.I loved the soundtrack! It's the same as the first film and sounded great.I dare to say that it will be nominated for many academy awards next year including acting by Chris Pine who plays James T. Kirk and Bruce Greenwood who reprises his role as Captain Pike.BUT, It has one big flaw that just bugs me. Why are the 72 frozen superhuman villains being kept alive?Look at all the damage just one of them created. What would happen if they all were set free?They are a huge threat to humanity and other worlds. Kirk should have sent them all into the sun to free humanity once and for all from the threat of their evil intent. I can guess that Starfleet wants these superhuman's blood because of it's power to heal and they believe in giving John Harrison a fair trial. I hate story lines were something big like this is written into the script (written by Roberto Orci), and then not fully dealt with completely. I hate to wait! This part of the story is a hole that is left open on purpose for future sequels? Most likely. I'll bet money we will see John Harrison again and if you think he was angry in this film...*****Spoiler Alert!!! Don't read this paragraph if you haven't watched this film yet!!!********** Oh, and check out this theory! Now that Starfleet has this new powerful anti-death blood serum from ""John Harrison"" (they really need him NOW), Kirk and any of the other characters can die and be brought back to life any time they need to! Right?! Very interesting! *****""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is a must see for all ""TREK"" fans. If you are new to this franchise you can catch up if you want to by watching the first original TV series on Hulu ""Star Trek"" season one for free and the remaining seasons for $8.00 a month subscription fee. If you do choose to watch this entertaining, wonderful series you will be able to enjoy these new films a whole lot more. I highly recommend this new film ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"". Make sure to see it in IMAX 3D for the full awesome effect of this wonderful film.

Uhura lost her mojo from the first film, Scotty was over the top annoying with ""humor"" fit for a flopped SNL skit and Kirk turned in a listless portrayal. Forget Sulu and Chekov, they were cardboard embarrassments. Spock however still shined through, and was the only saving grace of the film.Tons of sweeping camera shots that hoped to provide more substance then was actually before you abounded. The film makers also seemed hard pressed to keep the camera away from being aimed at any alien looking wanderers or crew members. Except for the midget with the plopped on stupid looking alien mask that drank with Scotty.What happened to the Star Trek I know? The core was ripped out, I can tell you that.

I would expect JJ to have a team of Nasa scientists to update that dumb design instead of pandering to the same old same old die hards.

Despite this, it doesn't at all interfere with the film and its storytelling as a whole (save for one moment involving Spock's scream near the end.  I couldn't not burst out laughing).Despite the derivations along those lines, the film makes the story and characters its own, as well as beautifully altering certain character's personalities based on the alternate universe events, while maintaining their original Star Trek personalities (particularly with the villain).Some action scenes border on the gratuitous, but even in those (such as the one with the Klingons), its purpose serves the plot (in demonstrating the villain, particularly when Kirk starts punching him).  About the only thing that stood out as pointless was having Carol Marcus (played by Alice Eve) strip to her underwear while changing into an environment suit.  At the very least, she told Kirk to look away, and the shot we get is when he looks anyway.

These last 2 movies that came out on Star Trek should have been renamed: Testosterone Trek.  That is all this is.  They have taken everything that Gene Rodenberry wrote and used to originally create Star Trek, and pitched everything out the window!  There is no original thinking either, as they not only pitched everthing out, but then, resalvaged a few lines and roles, but reversed the roles and lines on different characters.  For example, we now have the same scene in Wrath of Khan where Spock saved the ship but died in the process, but now, the new and improved version of Star Trek, Kirk saves the ship, and dies in the process, and Spock fights to bring Kirk back to life.  Wow, can't get more original than that, but stay tuned, it will be Uhura's turn in the next movie.  And Khan, is not East Asian (with a name like Kahn Nunien Sing), but looks like a New York Manhattan executive, with a british accent, and asian eastern in name only.  I guess his name comes from a mixed (up) marriage.  What the hey!  They not only did not have original ideas, but the directors and producers had to really work hard and pull a lot of hair to find ways to twist existing plots and lines around to where the same plots and lines exist, but reverse the characters.To sum it all up, I will not go see the third movie when it comes out.  I may buy the dvd only if i can find it at the $1.00 bin at Wal Marts.  When I saw this one, I kept running to the bathroom thinking I was going to vommit.  They are so desparate to appeal to the younger generation and reel in the fast buck.  Well, if the younger generation is that ignorant of good and original stuff, then they can have it.

1587655,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B009934S5M,Anthony L.,"[21, 34]","When Star Trek Into Darkness came into a cinema near me, I knew I had to instantly go and see it. For one thing, the trailers looked great, promising a dark, action-packed film where the stakes were high and the threat was even higher. For another thing, it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it, a consistently good player, as well as a fine cast that included Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, and Peter Weller. The reviews were (mostly) positive, too. So I went and saw it. I had a good time.But I left the theatre with mixed feelings. When I was invited to see it a second time, I saw the film with renewed concentration. I weighed the good, and I weighed the bad. And the film was found wanting.But before you click that dislike button, hear me out. But be warned, there are spoilers below.First, lets see what I DID like:1. Benedict Cumberbatch is the boss! He makes every film he is in better, whether he's acting as a giant dragon or a fussy detective. He is up to par, as expected, in Into Darkness. He is definitely the high point of the film, even if his character has got some script issues.2. Another equally good antagonist is horror icon Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus. His scene-stealing ultra-bad-dude gets some great lines (""You will run this bastard down"") and fun scenes. He reminds me of the film it could have been.3. Michael Giaccino. Wow! The J.J. Abrams staple has outdone himself with his score, which ranges from beautiful piano to pounding drums. The score in the London hospital scenes is incredibly brilliant.4. The action is great! And there's lots of it to behold. Love the mixes of martial arts!5. You know who else I liked? That little mute alien that travels around with Scotty. No kidding! Give that guy an Oscar!Now, for what I did NOT like:1. OK, lets start with the very beginning. I sat down in the darkened cinema, and the film began. Everything was blurry and out of focus. Aha! I forgot to put on my 3D glasses. I put them on my head. Everything was dark, blurry, and out of focus. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks 3D is overrated. Like this review if you think 3D is overrated. Now, I completely understand 3D as a TOOL to tell stories. James Cameron used it brilliantly in Avatar, as did Scorsese in Hugo, Ang Lee in Life of Pi, and Peter Jackson in The Hobbit. Those films are only made BETTER because of it.But let me get this straight: 3D should not be put in for making money, to appeal to younger audiences, or as a joke. Superhero movies do not need to be in 3D. The Great Gatsby does not need to be in 3D. Neither does The Last Airbender, Alice in Wonderland, or The Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Video. Star Trek Into Darkness did not NEED to be in 3D.2. The opening salvo looked like it was being filmed by a hyper-caffeinated teenager with ADD. A person beside me muttered ""It looks like a video game."" Indeed, with the bright colors, fake-looking 3D, lens flares, and out-of-focus shaky cam so shaky it would make Jason Bourne jealous, it did indeed remind one of a video game. But is that a bad thing?3. And here's my biggest problem with the film: the lack of emotion.Near the beginning of the movie, a Starfleet officer is blackmailed by Khan into blowing up the London Starfleet headquarters. We are supposed to feel sorry for this guy, we are almost TOLD to feel sorry for him (with lots of lingering shots on his sick daughter and saddened face), but we do not. The explosion itself is cold and distant, and not in a good way.Iron Man 3 also has a couple suicide bombings, and while it's not a perfect film, you actually feel for the characters. They appear human in our eyes, and the incident is all the more shocking because the stakes are that much higher.Not so in Into Darkness. Instead of feeling sorry for the characters, the audience instead is wondering how such a tiny ring makes such a ludicrously large explosion.Even worse, the explosion is never brought up again, except very briefly. We see no ordinary people affected by it, which makes it hard to feel for the characters, and worse, we don't feel that Khan is actually much of a villain either. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? That never comes about either.In another scene, Spock and Uhura talk about their feelings while flying in Klingon airspace. ""Are they really doing this right now?"" another person beside me asked. I knew what Abrams was trying to do. He was lulling us into a false sense of calm, just to pull a jump scare. And, on queue, it happened. Boom. Yawn. Did I mention that said action scene was AWESOME?There is one action scene where Chekov is sliding down the floor of the Enterprise screaming. I thought he was going to die. But he didn't. The action fell flat. If Chekov had died, who knows how brilliant this film could have been? In the original Star Trek franchise, Spock died. Sure, he was raised again, but at the cost of the Enterprise. To quote another critic, the first series weren't perfect, but at least they were daring. They raised the stakes.Kirk dies in Star Trek Into Darkness, but he is resurrected a few minutes later. Why didn't he stay dead, at least until the inevitable sequel? Think how brave that film could have been! Even when Admiral Pike dies we don't feel sad. It just felt like the mandatory killing off of *that* character to generate sympathy.4. The script. Now this is a time where we can all rally together and point fingers at someone: Damon Lindelof. The guy who ruined Lost, Cowboys and Aliens, Prometheus, and Star Trek Into Darkness. That guy is cinematic poison. It took a second viewing to see all the chinks in the armour. As I said before, Cumberbatch is phenomenal, but when he says ""You, you can't even break a rule, how can you be expected to break bone?"" the seriousness falls out of the story. Lindelof is trying too hard to give him cool lines. Then there's the question of the misogynistic, unnecessary, gratuitous, completely offensive changing scene with Alice Eve (is it just me or is her character somewhat unnecessary?). This got so many bad reviews that Lindelof had to issue an official apology via Twitter.There are a myriad of plotholes pointed out by other cinemaphiles. Some you notice and care about, some you don't.Namely, there's the little ""Khan's magic blood"" twist, which gave many reviewers the impression that Abrams did not know whether he wanted to distance himself from the first franchise and create something new, or follow in older footsteps. The film tries to ""homage"" older films, but only succeeds in making a mess....The result? Not a BAD film. No, not at all. Just a film that could have been so much greater. Did I hate Star Trek Into Darkness? I rather enjoyed it; it's not a bad film at all. It's a great action blockbuster. Abrams and Co. have created a film we can all enjoy, regardless of issues. In conclusion: Hov Trek Into Darkness is dun qu' tIv poH 'ej lathl QaQ movie, with op ay! Pardon my Klingon, it's never been a strong point.yIn nI' yISIQ 'ej yIchep.Live long and prosper, Abrams!",3,Please consider THIS Review!,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,7060,"['When', 'Star', 'Trek',

1587677,AE7EQ5123M75T,B009934S5M,a writer/reader/listener,"[20, 31]","Star Trek Into Darkness is a spectacular addition to the franchise. It's one of the very best Star Trek films, and is even better than the reboot that preceded it. SPOILERS FOLLOWWhat makes it so good? In the first place, it's action-packed with great special effects, which is kind of key for a summer blockbuster, but that alone won't cut it with Star Trek fans. It also has good writing and surprisingly good acting. A lot of the plot is character driven, as Chris Pine's Kirk and Zachary Quinto's Spock continue to take each other's measure: by now Kirk and Spock are friends, but rather uneasily so. The impulsive, by the seat of his pants Kirk finds his relationship to Spock tested by Spock's logical, by-the-book approach that threatens Kirk's very career, while Quinto's Spock does a great job of trying--ultimately without success--to suppress his emotional, impulsive side. By the end of the movie, each of them has applied and learned the value of the other's approach, doing a bit of a role-reversal. Pine and Quinto manage to bring some real depth to this struggle. This is further accentuated by the fact that, as is often the case, the struggle is over matters that reflect current events. Do we arrest terrorists or treat them as legitimate targets of war? Can we cross international boundaries to get at them? Where do Kirk's and Spock's real duties lie? Where does revenge fit in, if it fits in at all?The character who forces Kirk and Spock to wrestle with these issues, partly against their will, is the superb Benedict Cumberbatch, who gives the movie franchise some of its strongest acting ever. Cumberbatch is bound for great things, and he shows it in this role. Midway through the film he is revealed to be none other than Khan Noonien Singh, whom he plays with a dramatic intensity worthy of--and even exceeding--the performance of Ricardo Montalban. Khan is an intriguing character, and Cumberbatch takes him to a whole new level, his schemes consisting of wheels within wheels, becoming in at least one way like a sinister mirror image of Kirk. If Kirk's actions are justified by his concern for his crew, then aren't Khan's as well? A disturbing thought, given where Khan goes with it.But that's not all. Karl Urban continues to channel DeForest Kelly's McCoy, even more successfully than in the previous film. He trades the inevitable barbs with Spock, but most of his relational development is with regard to Kirk in this film. Bruce Greenwood gives another strong, but all too brief, performance as Chritopher Pike. The rest of the Enterprise crew are in fine form as well.One of the nicest touches for hard-core trekkies is how skillfully J. J. Abrams and the writers have woven Trek lore into the plot, and in a way that (mostly)  doesn't feel forced. Khan's appearance is foreshadowed by events that are clearly referenced in the original series as well as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Carol Marcus slips deftly into the story line as well, providing in interesting link to the shadowy Section 31, the very mention of which warns us that all in this film will not be as it seems. And the reprise of the death scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is pulled off with great care. It could have been cheesy, an instance of Star Trek lampooning itself, but the result is anything but that. And in consequence, we get to see the genetically-engineered superman Khan in a knock-down flight with an enraged Vulcan. The only thing that felt a bit odd was a tribble as a lab rat. (How could you, McCoy?)Of course, this isn't the original series. The actors are different; Abrams's' approach is different; the times are different. Nevertheless, Abrams has been true to the original in some core ways. And in this film, even more than the last, he's set himself a high bar for further entries in the franchise.

First off, this is a very, excellent, action-packed, humorous, and adventurous movie. I have watched it a number of times and have enjoyed it more each time. There is a reason for that too which I will get to. First off, I watched it in the theater and the first time, I was completely overwhelmed by the speed and the nonstop action of the movie. It was so fast-paced and action packed that I had difficulty following the story line. All the actors in it are superb and just phenomenal. I could see that they and the writers, director, and everyone else involved in making this movie put a ton of work into it. They also went all out on the special effects and it looks very very believable. The story line is very strong and very well constructed.However, like I said I had trouble following the story because there was so much fast paced action happening BUT with each time that  I re-watched it, I found I could better understand and follow the story. And I grew to like the story more each time. Definitely a few surprises in there. You see familiar Star Trek themes throughout and hear some familiar character lines too which just had to the fun of watching this. The ending is beautiful and caused me to tear up. Also, most interesting to me anyway is when the movie is ending, I found myself not wanting it to end. I was ready to see their next adventure. Of course, we have to wait, a bit on that.

THEY ARE CARICATURES.While the first reboot title, ""Star Trek,"" had many plot ""holes,"" the movie was, in a way, somewhat entertaining. Bertha Zelda and I actually watched the movie twice. We both had open minds. We may not have liked the portrayals of the classic Star Trek characters as much as the portrayals by the original cast members, but we were tolerant.However, this 2nd outing is, well, pure Dreck.The convoluted plots and the poor acting and the re-dubbed dialog in the center of the movie (about 25 minutes worth), that could have been done better by Senor Wences, made both of us wince. The director and the writers should have been very ashamed of this movie, because by attempting to re-do a classic Star Trek movie, even to the point of ""borrowing"" dialog and contriving different versions of events in ""Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan,"" they ruined not only this movie, but also the movie they parodied. They truly screwed up.Bertha Zelda commented, ""This is the best part of the movie,"" when the final credits and theme music were being played. I thought Leonard Nimoy's appearance to be the best part of the movie. Finally, here was a real actor, a believable actor, who wasn't just there for the pay cheque.The Blu-Ray picture and the high quality sound were wonderful.

I know Gene and his lovely wife, Majel, are no longer with us (I do so miss her voice as the ships computer and I caught the reference that Nurse Chapel (Majel's original part) had been reassigned) and a fresh take on the story is always welcome......but how far can it be taken.  By changing ONE thing you start a domino effect that changes a whole lot of things - like Khan, it was originally Kirk that discovered him on the 5 year mission.  I know, I know - major Trekkie nerd freak out there - - but how much more could it change and how much more can it change Gene's message.I did love the references to some of the old episodes, I kept catching little bits here and there, like the ship they took to the Klingon world was a ship they got in the Mudd incident a few months before....and OMG a Tribble in sick bay - doesn't McCoy know better?!But these ALSO happened during the 5 year mission......and how can they explain how the Klingon's head are back to the Next Generation look (which Worf refused to talk about - have to be a hard core Trekkie to get that one) as opposed to how their head ACTUALLY looked when Kirk and the Enterprise encountered them when they were not part of the Federation?Okay, I know I just did a major geek out there and did a lot of nit picking - I'm not a purest, but I would really hate for the vision that Gene Roddenberry put into motion be lost for the sake of an rewritten future.  Remember every science fiction movie, once you do ONE THING that changes the future, it causes a cascade that effect.....and yes, I know just a movie and they can rewrite it so that cascade doesn't happen, but just saying, ya know.Now after ALL that nit picking, it is a very good movie, I recommend adding it to your collection if you are a Trek fan - it is well worth it.

Marold""","[5, 8]","I confess I rarely consider the &#34;extras&#34; in a movie review unless they are essential to understanding the film, or they are a major addition to the cost (such as with 5 disk LOTR sets or 3 disk Avatar sets). On this single DVD, the value stands and falls on the value of the film. I have never been a rabid fan of Star Trek, especially the movies, since I believe they are relatively weak when compared to their closest competitors, the Star Wars series. But this film may be the very best effort so far to attain a level comparable to Star Wars (lets say Star Wars II, Attack of the Clones). I think one of the very best reasons for that is in the quality of the competition, the fabulously talented Khan Noonien Singh, who first appears in the original Star Trek series in 1967, and again in the second Star Trek movie, The Wrath of Khan. The moral here may be &#34;never let a good villain go to waste.&#34; Khan's virtue is probably based on both the screenwriters script for his dialogue plus the delightfully sinister characterization by my favorite actor, Benedict Cumberbatch (who is having a very good year in film). Cumberbatch plays it very, very cool. Khan is an unknown quantity to the young Kirk and Spock, which is why Spock somehow, consults an older version of himselfIt annoyed me that the technique by which he did that is not explained. But that is one of the difficulties of fast action movies. There is no time to fit in the glue that fits things together. (Even the greatest sci fi flicks have that problem, such as 2001 and Avatar.) The advantage you have over the characters in the story is that you know all about Khan long before Kirk and Spock do.And, like so many action / sci fi movies, there are many deus ex machina rescues which pull the bacon out of the fire just in time, and there are an equal number of whatever the opposite is of deus ex machina. That is, dangers, especially late in the film, for which no groundwork has been laid. It's as if the writer says, &#34;These guys are getting off too easily. We need to throw another monkey wrench into the works.&#34; Too much of that and we have just action for the sake of action.But, I confess, this film carries it off with a great amount of &eacute;lan. We feel sympathetic for at least a few of the characters, such as Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Sulu, and Admiral Pike. And, Cumberbatch pulls off a really believable cold, but remarkably calculating character who can appear to be sympathetic and on you side when it suits his purpose.",5,Best Star Trek film yet.

The key for me was to regard this new Star Trek as a completely new entity, and not compare it with the original ""classic"" series cinematic outings. The first film was a good start, and as long as I avoided any comparisons, I found I could enjoy it fairly well. This film, ""Into Darkness"" is a well made, mostly well acted second effort, but its insistence on putting its own spin on an original ""classic"" movie storyline basically crashed this voyage for me. These films, in my opinion, should be establishing their own universe and stories with these characters, not mirroring or mining what has come before. The film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to strike out on its own, or simply be a reworked homage. This incarnation will never escape its predecessors shadow if it continues on this path, and in my opinion, it can only fall short as a result.

A sequel to 2009's Star Trek, Into Darkness is in some ways both a remake and a tribute to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. For me, it works on all levels. It's exciting, action-packed, clever, and highlights certain moral concerns and character relationships that are true to the legacy of this amazing franchise.The only reason to knock a star off of this rating is because of the product itself. I'm not huge on special features. In general, I just want to movie itself with high picture and sound quality. The only ""special"" thing I tend to go for is if there's a director's cut (like for Lord of the Rings and Watchmen, where the added material vastly improves the films). I rarely watch a commentary, and I'll watch little featurettes once, if at all.But this bizarre insult to fans, spreading features out through vendor-exclusive releases, which don't even necessarily have the features, like a commentary, available on a disc . . . that's just wrong. Truly, unambiguously wrong. For myself, I don't feel too affected. I wanted the movie, I love the movie, I like having both the blu-ray and dvd. For others, the completists out there, you're going to be angry and disappointed, and I don't blame you one bit. I felt the same way about the dvd sets for the tv shows, too, where there were no commentary tracks and minimal special features. I don't really need them, but I can totally see how others would feel shafted. If ever there were a franchise where the devoted fans deserve the best, it's Star Trek.

We got the 3D blu ray and just played it for the first time. We've only had a 3D set for about a year now, so our 3D collection is still somewhat limited. However, it does include The Avengers, Avatar, and John Carter of Mars ... all excellent 3D presentations. I honestly think that this topped all of the others. The opening credits were particularly noteworthy. Everything about the blu ray was top notch, as is normally the case with blu rays of recent films. Both picture and audio were outstanding.Now, how about the Star Trek? To state my qualifications, I watched the very first Star Trek &#34;sneak preview&#34; episode in 1966. I was immediately hooked, and I doubt there is an episode I haven't seen 10 times or more over the years ... favorites like The Trouble with Tribbles more than that. So I've been a fan of every series and every movie now for closing in on 50 years.As an original Star Trek fan, this movie hit the spot. There were numerous little tributes to the Original Series throughout this film. It was a treasure trove of nostalgia for folks like me who know that series from every angle. I'll be honest, when I first heard the rumor that Khan was coming back (AGAIN) I rolled my eyes. But they pulled it off, and fantastically. Were some of the plot resolutions telegraphed far in advance? Yes they were. However, I'd like to think that if they make a Star Trek film true to the spirit of TOS (TV and movies), and a fan is intimately familiar with TOS, it is very understandable that they could see some of these things coming.And it literally doesn't matter if you do. There are plenty of surprises regardless.Dialogue throughout the film is snappy and often laugh-out-loud funny in a good way. And once again the triangle of Kirk-Spock-McCoy provided most of the humor and sharp-witted lines. Some of them go by so quickly that you have to pay close attention to catch everything. It was delightful.Even the closing credits are a treat, with a couple of touches certain to put a lump in the throats of long-time fans like me. Watch particularly for the way that Nimoy is credited, and the outstanding orchestral presentation of the original theme music.

Abrams can't turn into gold?After the visionary TV masterpieceLostand other hits, The Star Trek franchise is his latest to be touched by his Midas' finger, and soon it will beStar Wars.  After that, aCloverfieldsequel, a few video game reboots (Half-Lifeand...ohmygod!...Portal), and then he's a producer of Star Trek 3 andMission: Impossibleand who knows what else?  The man's a genius.STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is terrific; it maintains the integrity of the characters, is true to the ideals of the franchise, and besides all that it is a GREAT MOVIE. I thought it hit on all cylinders, even some hokey ones...which any true fan knows are all part of the Star Trek persona. In fact, this new ""alternate universe"" Star Trek is really doing a great job of keeping up with the traditions of the old series, treating the parallels with both reverence and, at times, playfulness.I applaud the decision to shoot it in IMAX; every shot in this movie is crisp and lush and BIG. STID is visually so immediate it feels like it takes place in your veins; even the sounds are intense. In our showing one nearby gentleman stood up during the credits and bellowed to the audience, ""Did anyone else think this was too loud?"" and NO ONE answered him. I certainly didn't...though yes, it was loud, it was so alive and urgent that I felt I was sharing their atmosphere.So much is done to give the movie an amazing sense of presence, as if Abrams truly understands the reverence that even scientists love to ""Trek."" For instance, whenever warp drive is achieved the ship has that familiar e-long-a-tion that, a la Einstein's theory, stretches it just before it punches into warp. But now the vessel makes a final splintering SNAP! as it disappears, and there is a brilliantly iridescent blue trail that the camera immerses us in as it crackles and pops, as if even its speed is a living entity. And Abrams also understands there is nothing like being aboard the captain's command center; it has a luminous blue and white that shimmers in its intensity, making it what it should be: a magical place that pulses with the presence of command. Even the inclusion of the very appropriate but always missing ""Permission to come aboard the bridge!"" is a welcome addition, addressing not only proper naval etiquette, but also the privilege it is to enter the command center of a ship - and ESPECIALLY the Enterprise.As for characterization, the new Trek advances the personalities of the crew without being faithful to the characters they inhabit. There is so much that is correct here in this new iteration of the storyline that I continually found myself actors morphing into the original characters. Chris Pine inhabits Captain Kirk perfectly; he has his swagger and seeming invincibility down so pat that his eventual moment of humility seems truly genuine and moving. The opinion of Sheldon (of [[ASIN:B000VZUWZW]]) aside, Zachary Quinto's Spock and Karl Urban's Bones are so spot on that they seem to inhabit the skin of the original actors. To say too much in the way of specifics would be reveal spoilers, but I will tell you that attention is being given to the original series in so many ways. So many moments will cause Trekkers to grin; and, beyond the more obvious ones there are even some moments and actions that only REAL Trekkers would notice. For instance (and don't worry, I'm being cautious of spoilers): the very fact that Chekov is absent from the bridge for a while is significant, as is the name of a new character. (If there's no Trekker around you, look it up.)And Benedict Cumberbatch is also magnificent as the villain John Harrison; truly intense and dark, he seems to inhabit his rogue with a sinister passion - his lip seems to curl with each word, and he loads the glare of his eye with an evil intensity as deep as space. He is more than a match for Kirk and  the Enterprise, and he carries off his role with such a style that there must be SOME way to get him to return in the future...I would look forward to that so much that I'd look for a wormhole to get there.Abrams has taken a giant leap ahead with STID. He has created a universe LIKE the original, but with the ability to take the old stories and move on FROM there, with respect and admiration for the original. Above all, I suspect Roddenberry himself would have liked this new take on his franchise, because it envisions what he had hoped for: a universe built upon respect for individual rights, where - to quite liberally quote the famous mantra - to boldly go where no one has gone before...or if they did, to go there again, and do something unique the next time around, reverentially, carefully, and with great love.",5,Just About a PERFECT Movie,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,4713,"['anything', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'gold', 'visionary', 'TV', 'masterpieceLostand', 'other', 'hits', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'latest', 'be', 'touched', 'Midas', 'finger', 'soon', 'will', 'beStar', 'Wars', 'aCloverfieldsequel', 'few', 'video', 'game', 'reboots', 'Half-Lifeand', 'ohmygod', 'Portal', 'then', 'producer', 'Star', 'Trek', '3', 'andMission', 'Impossibleand', 'who', 'what', 'else', 'man', 'genius.STAR', 'TREK', 'INTO', 'DARKNESS', 'terrific', 'integrity', 'characters', 'true', 'ideals', 'franchise', 'GREAT', 'MOVIE', 'thought', 'hit', 'cylinders', 'even', 'hokey', 'ones', 'true', 'fan', 'knows', 'are', 'part', 'Star', 'Trek', 'persona', 'fact', 'new', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Star', 'Trek', 'really', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'up', 'traditions', 'old', 'series', 'treating', 'parallels', 'reverence', 'times', 'playfulness.I', 'applaud', 'decision', 'shoot', 'IMAX', 'shot', 'movie', 'crisp', 'lush', 'BIG', 'STID', 'visually', 'so', 'immediate', 'place', 'veins', 'even', 'sounds', 'are', 'intense', 'showing', 'one', 'nearby', 'gentleman', 'stood', 'up', 'credits', 'bellowed', 'audience', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'think', 'was', 'too', 'loud', 'NO', 'ONE', 'answered', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'yes', 'was', 'loud', 'was', 'so', 'alive', 'urgent', 'felt', 'was', 'sharing', 'atmosphere.So', 'much', 'done', 'give', 'movie', 'amazing', 'sense', 'presence', 'Abrams', 'truly', 'reverence', 'even', 'scientists', 'love', 'Trek', 'instance', 'whenever', 'warp', 'drive', 'achieved', 'ship', 'familiar', 'e-long-a-tion', 'la', 'Einstein', 'theory', 'just', 'warp', 'now', 'vessel', 'final', 'splintering', 'SNAP', 'brilliantly', 'iridescent', 'blue', 'trail', 'camera', 'pops', 'even', 'speed', 'living', 'entity', 'Abrams', 'also', 'nothing', 'being', 'captain', 'command', 'center', 'luminous', 'blue', 'white', 'shimmers', 'intensity', 'making', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'magical', 'place', 'presence', 'command', 'Even', 'inclusion', 'very', 'appropriate', 'always', 'missing', 'Permission', 'come', 'bridge', 'welcome', 'addition', 'addressing', 'not', 'only', 'proper', 'naval', 'etiquette', 'also', 'privilege', 'enter', 'command', 'center', 'ship', 'ESPECIALLY', 'Enterprise.As', 'characterization', 'new', 'Trek', 'personalities', 'crew', 'being', 'faithful', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'so', 'much', 'correct', 'here', 'new', 'iteration', 'storyline', 'continually', 'found', 'actors', 'morphing', 'original', 'characters', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'perfectly', 'swagger', 'seeming', 'invincibility', 'down', 'so', 'pat', 'eventual', 'moment', 'humility', 'truly', 'genuine', 'moving', 'opinion', 'Sheldon', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B000VZUWZW', ']', ']', 'aside', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Spock', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Bones', 'are', 'so', 'spot', 'seem', 'inhabit', 'skin', 'original', 'actors', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'specifics', 'would', 'be', 'reveal', 'spoilers', 'will', 'tell', 'attention', 'being', 'given', 'original', 'series', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'So', 'many', 'moments', 'will', 'cause', 'Trekkers', 'grin', 'more', 'obvious', 'ones', 'are', 'even', 'moments', 'actions', 'only', 'REAL', 'Trekkers', 'would', 'notice', 'instance', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'m"", 'being', 'cautious', 'spoilers', 'very', 'fact', 'Chekov', 'absent', 'bridge', 'while', 'significant', 'name', 'new', 'character', 'Trekker', 'look', 'up', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'also', 'magnificent', 'villain', 'John', 'Harrison', 'intense', 'dark', 'inhabit', 'rogue', 'sinister', 'passion', 'lip', 'curl', 'word', 'glare', 'eye', 'evil', 'intensity', 'as', 'deep', 'space', 'more', 'match', 'Kirk', 'Enterprise', 'role', 'such', 'style', 'must', 'be', 'SOME', 'way', 'get', 'return', 'future', 'would', 'look', 'forward', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'look', 'wormhole', 'get', 'there.Abrams', 'taken', 'giant', 'leap', 'ahead', 'STID', 'created', 'universe', 'original', 'ability', 'take', 'old', 'stories', 'move', 'FROM', 'there', 'respect', 'admiration', 'original', 'suspect', 'Roddenberry', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'new', 'take', 'franchise', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'universe', 'built', 'respect', 'individual', 'rights', 'where', 'quite', 'liberally', 'quote', 'famous', 'mantra', 'boldly', 'go', 'where', 'one', 'gone', 'before', 'did', 'go', 'there', 'again', 'do', 'something', 'unique', 'next', 'time', 'reverentially', 'carefully', 'great', 'love']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1587791,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B009934S5M,California Dreaming,"[3, 5]","I was a big fan of the original Star Trek series in the late 60s, and as I have said before, I used to race home to see it on TV when there was a new episode.  As a matter of fact, we were probably the first people on our block who owned a color television, and from what I remember, the series originally aired in color.  (I remember watching the first lunar landing on TV, and I was very disappointed that it was in black and white.  ""Where is the high definition color, in 3D!"" would have been my exact words if HD existed at the time, and if I hadn't have been in awe of that event.  And yes, 3D did exist, albeit in a different form.)The first Star Trek film with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto was pure bliss.  After years and years of borderline lame Star Trek films, I was really proud of the way that the director, producers, and screenwriter pulled off that first film.  It was a true homage to the series, never devolving in any way; there were characters and not caricatures, and the dialog and action were fantastic.  So, I was really looking forward to this film.  And boy, was I disappointed.  No, make that borderline mad.This is really a stinkeroo, in every way.  Everything that they got right in that first film was seemingly turned on its head in ""Into Darkness.""  I could complain about all kinds of things, but what was the worst:  the dialog.  Way, way, way too much exposition here.  You have characters talking and talking and talking, and it never seems to end.  Kind of like a review that rips a film such as this.One piece of dialog that really was a misfire:  when Bones is trying to convince Kirk not to do something -- I can't remember exactly what that was, and I really don't care -- and the doctor said something like, ""That would be like robbing a bank when you have a getaway car with a flat tire!""  Now, I don't know about you, but cars will NOT have tires that far in the future; they will surely be flying cars.  So this character would surely not use this metaphor in this scenario that far in the future.  No way.  No stinking way!And then he used another!  Something about a poker player and an ace card.  Yikes.  Well, at least the dialog was somewhat saved by the Kirk character when he responded with something like, ""Enough with the metaphors already!""  I couldn't have agreed more.  And it would have been better if Kirk would have looked into the camera -- ala Woody Allen -- and said something like, ""O.K.  I can't believe that I have to speak this dialog.  But I'm under contract to do so and so please don't get mad at me.  Get mad at the writer instead.""  (Naturally, with most Woody Allen films, the writer would be himself but whatever.)A huge misfire, of intergalactic proportion.  I will go three here only because some of the special effects and cinematography were really good.  But this would be a pretty big pass by me, in any galaxy, and I might say something like, ""How about if we take the original hard drive that this film is on and throw it into the Event Horizon?""",3,Dialog Only Fitting in a Black Hole,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,3030,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'late', '60s', 'have', 'said', 'used', 'race', 'home', 'see', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'episode', 'matter', 'fact', 'were', 'probably', 'first', 'people', 'block', 'who', 'owned', 'color', 'television', 'what', 'remember', 'series', 'originally', 'aired', 'color', 'remember', 'watching', 'first', 'lunar', 'landing', 'TV', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'Where', 'high', 'definition', 'color', '3D', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'exact', 'words', 'HD', 'existed', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'awe', 'event', 'yes', '3D', 'did', 'exist', 'albeit', 'different', 'form', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'was', 'pure', 'bliss', 'years', 'years', 'borderline', 'lame', 'Star', 'Trek', 'films', 'was', 'really', 'proud', 'way', 'director', 'producers', 'screenwriter', 'pulled', 'off', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'true', 'homage', 'series', 'never', 'devolving', 'way', 'were', 'characters', 'not', 'caricatures', 'dialog', 'action', 'were', 'fantastic', 'So', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'boy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'No', 'make', 'borderline', 'mad.This', 'really', 'stinkeroo', 'way', 'Everything', 'got', 'right', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'seemingly', 'turned', 'head', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'could', 'complain', 'kinds', 'things', 'was', 'worst', 'dialog', 'Way', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'here', 'have', 'characters', 'talking', 'talking', 'talking', 'never', 'end', 'Kind', 'review', 'film', 'such', 'this.One', 'piece', 'dialog', 'really', 'was', 'misfire', 'when', 'Bones', 'trying', 'convince', 'Kirk', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'doctor', 'said', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'robbing', 'bank', 'when', 'have', 'getaway', 'car', 'flat', 'tire', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cars', 'will', 'NOT', 'have', 'tires', 'far', 'future', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'flying', 'cars', 'So', 'character', 'would', 'surely', 'not', 'use', 'metaphor', 'scenario', 'far', 'future', 'way', 'No', 'stinking', 'way', 'then', 'used', 'Something', 'poker', 'player', 'ace', 'card', 'Yikes', 'Well', 'least', 'dialog', 'was', 'somewhat', 'saved', 'Kirk', 'character', 'when', 'responded', 'something', 'Enough', 'metaphors', 'already', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'agreed', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Kirk', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'camera', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'said', 'something', 'O.K', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', 'speak', 'dialog', ""'m"", 'contract', 'do', 'so', 'so', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'mad', 'Get', 'mad', 'writer', 'instead', 'Naturally', 'most', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'writer', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'misfire', 'intergalactic', 'proportion', 'will', 'go', 'three', 'here', 'only', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'big', 'pass', 'galaxy', 'might', 'say', 'something', 'How', 'about', 'take', 'original', 'hard', 'drive', 'film', 'throw', 'Event', 'Horizon']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I am a huge original-series Star Trek fan, and have compared each subsequent series or film to that original show.  In some cases, the latter works compared favorably, and in others unfavorably, but all have the original series as the main ""yardstick"" in my mind.  This film, and its predescessor, fall into that same category... as far as I'm concerned, they exist in the shadow of the ORIGINAL, and must be compared to it.  After all, the original is still watched, today, after almost half a century.  None of what has followed on has shown anything remotely like the same ""legs"" that the original show did.The reason that the original series was, in my opinion, so wonderful was almost something ""alchemical""...  a remarkable mix of many, many element which just came together to form a fantastic whole.

And much of what came into being grew, not from his imagination, but from the active involvement of others unrelated to him (Gene Coon, to me, gets more credit than Gene Roddenberry does, for example, and each actor had a large role in defining their own characters).The design, done by a man with a real technical design background (in aerospace), named Walter (""Matt"") Jefferies.  The prop designs, and many of the more complex makeup designs, as well as the Romulan design...  by a master artisan named Wah Chang.  The music (not just the original fanfare by Alexander Courage, but the many other musical elements, in many cases long since forgotten by modern Trek composers, and to me sorely missed)...  the scripts written, in many cases, by accomplished prose authors...  some really great art direction and some terrific episodic directors.  It all came together to create ""magic.""The original concept was that the Captain, the First Officer, and the Chief Engineer would be the three main characters.  However, this shifted as DeForrest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy just caught fire with the audience and the production team.  Scotty was pushed back a bit, and McCoy rose to the forefront.Many view the original as so successful because it played to widely recognized psychological models...  with Kirk as the ""superego"" (the deciding factor element of the brain in psychological theory), Spock as the ""ego"" (the purely intellectual, ""higher"" element of the mind) and McCoy as the ID (the more instinctive, emotional elements of the mind).  Whether this was ever really intended...  it WORKED, and that's central to who these characters are and how they best served in the series.Star Trek, at its best, was always about us trying (and not always succeeding completely) to rise above our base natures.  It was HOPEFUL, but it was also real... these were real people, who we could imagine knowing in real life, but they were ""us as we hope we might be, at our best.""SOme of the great lines in Classic Star Trek involved Kirk's morality.  Kirk refusing to kill the helpless Gorn commander, who had been trying to kill him...  and this is what proved to the keepers of the Arena that humanity had worth.  Kirk admitting that he's ""a killer, from a race of killers... but I choose not to kill today"" in another episode.Star Trek, classically, had a MESSAGE.  A message that, as flawed as we are, we can be better, and we can overcome, and we can survive, without giving up our humanity, and without giving into our baser nature.That... not the general shape of the ships, or the color of the shirts, or the names of the characters...  is what made ""Star Trek"" special.  The latter series tried, and USUALLY succeeded, in adherence to that, but the overall quality of those latter series varied, widely.  Nevertheless, none of them ever attempted to ""revise"" the original concepts and ideals of Star Trek.Until JJ Abrams came along, that is.The first movie, in 2009, was widely enjoyed by audiences...  for being a ""thrilling romp with awesome visuals.""  It performed better than other recent Trek films, and (in unadjusted-for-inflation dollars) was the highest-grossing movie in Trek history (adjusting for inflation gives different results, of course, but ST'09 remains among the top-earning Trek films made).But that first movie lost the nature of Star Trek which I loved.  They ignored (due, I assume, to utter ignorance of real-world protocols and, more importantly, the REASONS behind those protocols) military logic.  Putting a fresh cadet in charge of the fleet flagship, ignoring the likely tens of thousands of other serving officers with far, far more experience and qualifications?  Not likely.  Uhura getting aboard the Enterprise through ""blackmail"" due to her sleeping with her superior... that's why the real military has regulations making ""fraternization"" a criminal offense (subject to prison time) for the senior personnel involved.  They failed to understand what a singularity is...  they failed to understand anything related to interstellar distances, or even intra-stellar ones (seriously, Old Spock could SEE VULCAN DESTROYED from his vantage point, but his planet was not swallowed up by the same singularity???)Still, I could almost forgive all of that... the lack of logic, of thought behind choices, of the horrendously bad set and prop design...  if the CHARACTERIZATIONS HAD BEEN RIGHT.  But...  they were not.  These were characters who had the same names, and somewhat similar appearances, but who (for the most part) felt utterly unrelated to the characters as portrayed previously.Karl Urban's McCoy was the best of the bunch, in my opinion...  and Zachary Quinto, given the script he was fed, did a decent job as Spock.  Chris Pine was, in my view, badly miscast...  a decent actor, but his ""Kirk"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Kirk I grew up with.  They created a new character, from whole cloth, and named him ""Jim Kirk,"" and expected us not to be bothered by the fact that he had nothing at all in common with the character we know.  As much of a fan as I am of Simon Pegg, I thought his ""Scotty"" was terrible...  like a bad Saturday Night Live parody.  I didn't mind John Cho as Sulu... he's a fine actor who I'm loving in ""Sleepy Hollow""...  but I found the casting of Chekov and Uhura to be pretty poor, as neither actor had anything in common with the originals except for a partial skin-tone similarity in one case... and I'd been hoping that they'd hire an actual Russian actor and an actual African actress to play the roles.Still, in that first movie, they retained to a degree the central role of McCoy in the mix, at least.  But they ignored the philosophy of Star Trek...  it was just wall-to-wall ""attitude, explosions, and pandering.""  And, of course, they seemed to be trying (way too hard, frankly) to put together ""the original series status quo"" in just a couple of hours.In the end, I really hated it, personally.  The first film left me feeling like I'd woken up in the morning, gone into my child's bedroom, and found a stranger in there, pretending to be my child...  except in mocking fashion, torturing my real child's beloved pets and so forth.  Like a mythological ""changeling""... go look it up.Still, I tried to keep an open mind with respect to this second film.  Having ""put all the pieces onto the board in the right order"" in the first film, I had hopes that they'd treat the second film as a ""classic Star Trek episode"" as much as possible, relying on the structures and philosophies with the original series so successfully implemented.Sadly,I was disappointed at every turn.At least in this film they seem to have settled on a size and scale for the Enterprise... in the first film, the size of the ship fluctuated wildly, from more than twice the length of the TNG ship (itself dwarfing the original-series ship) to just about 2x the size of the original-series ship, to one sequence showing it smaller than the original-series ship.  This time out, it seems that the ""JJ-Prise"" is something like 1.75 x the size of the original ship... but of course we get another ""hugererererer"" ship in this movie... which dwarfs the city of San Francisco (though at that size, its fall from orbit through the atmosphere at the speeds shown would have taken a seconds at most, not the minutes it showed on-screen).The characterizations were not improved in this film, with the exception of Chris Pine, who I THINK was trying (with little help from the script) to give us a Kirk who was at least somewhat reminiscent of the original.  Spock was terribly disserved... and the ""soap opera"" between lovers Spock and Uhura was really, really badly carried off.  McCoy was almost ignored...  because, apparently, JJ wants the ""big three"" to be Kirk, Spock, and Uhura.  Urban did his best, but he was given so little to do in this film that it was shocking, frankly.  Pegg's ""Scotty"" wasn't as badly ""parody-ish"" this time around... but he still doesn't seem to be portraying a character with anything at all to do with the character played by James Doohan... despite their putting in a ""Scotty drinking"" scene.  (Drinking doesn't make a character... CHARACTERIZATION does!)  Super-girl Uhura was, to me, just horrendously FORCED... JJ Abrams and team wanting to create a ""feminist-friendly starlet character"" in the film...  except that it really doesn't work.  While Zoe Saldana is a nice-looking girl and I'm sure is a decent actress... the role that this character is supposed to play in this world would not the ""action hero"" that JJ wants her to be.  He found every excuse in the book to send her along on the ""action sequences"" but all this really ended up showing is why, again, FRATERNIZATION IS A REALLY BAD THING in a military or paramilitary environment.The biggest secret re: this film, of course, was ...  KHAAAAAAAANNNN.  It was the secret which was never really a secret.  But, of course, they did their level best to make us not think it was Khan by casting an actor unrelated to either the original presentation of Khan or to the fictional-real-world nature of Khan, and having the actor playing the part show literally no common psychological or personality traits with the Khan we all know.  In other words...  why call him ""Khan"" if you're not going to make him even remotely similar to Khan as we know him?  I'd have bee happier if they'd left him with the ""assumed name"" he initially has in the film, and come up with some other reason for him to be a GOD.And that's what he was.  Khan, in the original series, was a man.  A man whose genetics had been improved through eugenics (laboratory-level selective breeding, NOT ""genetic code rewriting"" by the way!).  Stronger, faster, smarter... but still HUMAN...  just representing the pinnacle of what humanity might be...  say, the top 1% of today's strength, intellect, and so forth, all combined into a single person.But Khan in this film is MAGICAL, it seems.  His strength is akin to Clark Kent in uniform.  He's literally invulnerable to injury or damage (and has ""magic blood"" which, instead of consuming other genetically-dissimilar life, somehow can ""cure anything that ails ya!"" regardless of whether you a ""superman,"" a normal human, or a little round fuzzy lifeform from halfway across the galaxy with a totally unrelated genetic structure).  Heck, it can even bring the dead back to life!  And it'll only cost you $9.99... plus you get this set of Ginsu Knives!  (Yes, that's sarcasm... but that's exactly how I felt about this story as they showed that cheap ""McGuffin"" at the end.)Naturally, they have a massive uber-starship which dwarfs anything ever seen...  and yet can be operated by a crew of one.  (Question... if you only need one man to crew the ship... why have it be so big?  What's the point of the size of the ship in the first place?  Other than to be ""kewlerererererer and hugererererererer"" than even the JJ Enterprise, I mean?)  And this ship, with the help of this one ""superman,"" has somehow led to technological breakthroughs that the entire rest of a hundreds-of-trillions-strong population spread throughout the galaxy could never have thought of.  Again, see, it's cause ""JJ's Khan is a GOD.""  It's faster, better, stronger, tougher...  and somehow, NOBODY IN THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY-RUN UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS HAD ANY IDEA THAT THIS WAS BEING BUILT?  How, I wonder, did they fund this?  Girl scout cookie sales???  Who worked on it?  And is the JJ-verse press so totally controlled that nobody ever reported anything on any of this?  In other words...  is the JJ-Trek future really a fascist utopia?  Because, barring that, I fail to see any way that something like this makes any sense whatsoever.So...  we have this huge ship... and why?  Because ""it'll look kewl crashing into the San Francisco Bay and wiping out half the bay.""  Again, a real issue of lack of understanding of science...  such a crash would not have just ""left a groove"" and knocked down downtown San Francisco... that much energy would have wiped out EVERYTHING.  The waves alone would have wiped out every city within many miles of the SF Bay.  The impact would fracture the San Andreas Fault, and anything still standing would be down in short order.  It made NO SENSE...  but it sure did make for a kewl CGI effect, didn't it?  (Crashing something the size of the TOS Enterprise would have been much more reasonable...  but you wouldn't get those kewl sequences of a tilted saucer ""skating"" through the San Francisco skyline, would you?)Okay...  so...  characterizations - BAD.  Plausibility (remember, SCIENCE FICTION is not the same as fantasy...  it projects from what we know, it doesn't contradict what we know!) - BAD.  Design - only the most minor of improvements from the first film (at least we got minimal exposure to the Pabst Brewery this time around, and the phasers seemed to be a LITTLE bit improved... at least they didn't do ""product placement flippy shots"" to try to sell toy phasers this time!) but still, overall - BAD.This is not to say that the film isn't entertaining...  but the entertainment value is based entirely upon the ""spectacle"" of it, not based upon anything remotely akin to ""making the audience think.""  It's not impossible to do both in a film...  a movie like ""The Island"" from a couple of years back hit the ""thinking"" and the ""outrageous action"" targets equally well, for example...but this one, while a rousing success on the ""visual spectacle"" level, utterly fails on the ""makes you think, and makes you care"" level.And that second item - making you think, and making you care - is where Classic Star Trek was at its best.  Unfortunately, JJ Abrams and his team seem not to have a grasp of how to do that.Fortunately, it seems that Abrams will have minimal involvement in the next film...  at the very least, he won't be directing, anyway...  so it'll be interesting to watch and see how a new director may approach this property.  A new team, even one including elements of the team from the prior two films, could make that ""magic spark"" happen and so there's still a chance... slim, but still there... that the third film (and likely the last one with this cast and production team, I strongly suspect) might finally give us a ""Star Trek film"" which brings us the things that so many of us loved so much about the original show.  Not the costume design, not the set design or ship design, or prop design... though all of those could be much, much better... but the charcterization and writing... the direction and acting.There's hope for the future, but it's a slim hope.  This movie had ""hope"" too... and those hopes, for me at least, were totally dashed by this film.",2,"A passable ""mindless popcorn flick"" lacking everything I loved about the original Star

Since these are &#34;prequel's&#34;, it transitions quite nicely.  Especially for tying those loose ends from the series together.  I didn't however like the part where they kill off Capt. Pike as in the series...he was in a wheel chair but was taken by Spock (providing a mock court martial for kidnapping) so that the retired Pike could live out his life in sort of a &#34;Fantasy Island&#34; scenario.

For example, captain Kirk was confronted with  the question  of saving his friend's life or disobeying  his superior's order. In another instance, he had to decide if he's going to co-operate with one of his enemies to defeat another enemy. Whatever action he took, he would pay dearly. Those situations struck a chord with me. It's because in my daily activities, I also had  the same problems.There are some scenes with gripping suspense. For example, the scene where the Enterprise space ship was so badly damaged that it could not flee or fight. Then the enemy ship locked their laser guns on it. Its crew's  lives were hung on a thread. How could they escape? What happened next took me completely by surprise.The acting of most of the actors is believable.It's more like an interesting drama and thriller than an action film. It has some action scenes but they're not its focus.Of course, it has some logical holes as any other movies but they don't affect its entertaining value.According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:Production Budget: $190 millionDomestic:  $224,459,201+ Foreign:  $222,500,000= Worldwide:  $446,959,201That's a huge amount.In short, it's absolutely worth watching.

The cast has retained the same 'magic' that was on display in the first movie they did together.  If I had let a lot of the original reviews influence me, I'd have never seen this movie, least of all purchased it.  After all, I thought, 'why' would they choose to focus a movie around 'Kahn' instead of going after something altogether NEW...???  But I'll tell ya, this movie does NOT disappoint !  It's really well done.  It's got a great story.  The acting is superb.  Heck, I even shed a tear at one point, ha, bless my soul.  And perhaps that's the point :  This movie has SOUL.I read a few people's reviews who claim that they are Star Trek fans who DIDN'T like this movie.  And, well, I just don't get that.  This movie's cast is EXCELLENT, and has somehow managed to access a REAL synergistic soulfulness together.  This is VERY VERY rare in films today, ESPECIALLY in sci-fi action films.  I hope this SAME cast keeps making Star Trek films for years to come.  If you see and DON'T like it...I don't know what to say to you.  I can't understand how you could NOT like this film...unless you have a stick up your...  In which case, I suggest you see a doctor.Kirk is not only a bad-ass, he's HUMAN.  Kahn is not only a bad-ass, he, too, is HUMAN, in fact, he's a FAR better 'Kahn' in all respects [including premise and story] than the original Kahn, at least in my opinion.  The story is not only 'Star Treky', it is also well paced and excellently depicted.  I guess you could say that its 'Star Trek for today', as compared to being too similar in presentation to the original treck.  I give it 5 stars because it manages to actually keep me interested from start to finish.  And this fact alone means that it is a rare gem.  It might have been nice is Chekov and Sulu had bit more to say and do, but other than that, it was pretty well balanced.Bottom line :  IF you like the last one with this cast, then you'll also like THIS one.  They're both about the same in terms of entertainment / quality.  And THAT is saying a lot, and I must admit 'I' for one am quite GLAD and HAPPY about this cast of actors who are doing a great job so far at filling such hard to fill shoes.

This one was worse and not worth owning unless you are a Star Trek fan.  Aside from the leads looking ugly (Kirk looks like a frog), the sole black woman being in helpless love with an alien, the old 60's clothes should have been jettisoned. Aside from the ugly leads, the clothes single handily ruins the film.  Why would an army go around in shirts?  The clothes and guns still have that 1960's look to them.  This is one of the reasons I always liked Star Wars better than ST.  SW looked futuristic but the weapon looked believable.I saw 1960's looking phasers, pants and shirts.  Why have that in it with all of the CGI?  In fact, the CGI does not help expand the scope of ST because the TV show's appeal was wrapped around the stories due to the lower budget.  You know, when you have less money you concentrate on a better story.  When you have more money you concentrate on special effects and less story.  They should end this right here.  There is a reason why the 1979 ST expanded it's scope and changed the uniforms (besides SW having been out), it is because the 1960's clothes were unique to those times and only cool to those who lived through it.The story is nothing more than the Wrath of Khan, but less creepy and played by a white guy (British at that) this time, which kind of takes away from the guy being names Khan.  The grand admiral (Peter Weller.  I thought he was a professor?) has a blond haired, blue eyed British daughter.  Explain to me how this is possible.  I get tired of Hollywood inserting the random British person in films and acting as if we should not question why they are British!  I do believe that they make their own movies right?  I don't see random Americans in their films!  In fact, I don't see any at all!Now to JJ Abrams.  It is sad that they picked this guy to direct the next Star Wars film instead of a Christopher Nolan, who emphasizes story and feasibility in his films.  Look what he did to the once silly character of Batman. He made that believable. Abrams is not a good director at all and if it were not for CGI, there would be nothing about this film that would make you think quality.  Abram's main shots seem to be one or two persons on screen with close angles - that's really it.  He never gives us a true scope of a film and his films don't seem complete either.  I seriously think that George Lucas is better.  Hopefully Disney will come to their senses and get someone more capable.  On top of that, you never want to have a guy who directed Star Trek do Star Wars, which requires much more skill.

The general theme of these reviews is a long and drawn out rant about how Roddenberry kept true to the science and developed his stories better.What a load of crap. I will admit in the first reboot, the Red Matter was pretty far-fetched. That's about it. Abrams more than makes up for it in this ""rehash"" of Wrath of Khan. Just like the original, there is a death. This time it's Kirk instead of Spock. Same scenario... radiation exposure, saying ""I love you man!"" through the glass, etc. Much better acting this time around. We all loved Shatner and we all agree he cant act, so I think it's time to quit doggin on Pine. At least he has some sort of acting skill.The problem people have is using Khan's superhuman blood to resurrect Kirk. Why not? They're both human after all. Obviously wouldn't work on a Vulcan in the original, but in this version, it's plausible from a scientific standpoint. Rewind 30 years back and how did Roddenberry resurrect Spock? Oh yeah, it was Genesis... the magical torpedo that terraforms an uninhabitable rock (planetoid) that is not located within the habitable zone of any nearby star. If it was it would not have been devoid of any atmosphere. That is an astrophysical fact. Period. Roddenberry took a giant dump on astrophysics in the original and Abrams spun the story slightly in order to make it scientifically plausible.So you folks, who are compelled to debate the science in these films, better come to the table armed with some actual knowledge. For every unbelievable aspect you try to point out in this new version, I will cite 5 examples from the Roddenberry era. It's time to give Abrams some credit and quit berating his work simply because you cant separate yourselves from the Roddenberry era for just two hours so you can enjoy an entertaining film.I've enjoyed all of the Star Trek films. I never could get into TOS, but the later series were pretty good. And yes, despite Genesis, I enjoyed The Wrath of Khan. Just dont try to come at me with scientific appraisals of the original films.

1587857,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B009934S5M,Chris Kennison,"[2, 5]","""Star Trek"" has come a long way since first airing on the NBC network in 1966. No other franchise has such a following of fans that span so many years. Those same fans like their ""Star Trek"" star-trekkie and don't like deviation. So when J.J. Abrams took over the movie franchise almost exactly 4-years ago, there was excitement and hesitation. Abrams not only revitalized the series that had presumably died, but he went back to the beginning to characters originally fleshed out by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, George Takei and Walter Koenig. He started over. On top of that, due to events in the 2009 movie, he wiped everything that ever happened with these characters in any episode or movie clean; as if it never happened.""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is a combination of new ideas and classic stories. Abrams is making a point of doing new things and going new places, but at the same time being nostalgic with those trekkies that like their ""Star Trek"" more than their first born. The actors, especially Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), are all perfectly cast. Pine delivers that classic Captain Kirk charm, charisma, wit and cockiness. Quinto is so good at Spock even the trekkies don't complain.""Into Darkness"" is less about establishing a connection with fans than having some fun. Not to say that Abrams didn't make a considered effort to connect with longtime fans, but after his first movie managed to slip by with wide spread approval, he has taken the gloves off and let the action fly. From the opening moments of the film until the closing credits, the movie is constantly interesting, action-packed and intelligent. A summer blockbuster has to do that, right? Yet, Abrams also delivers with emotional impact and a theme that resonates throughout the film about leadership and friendship.There is a popular assessment of the history of ""Star Trek"" films that only the even numbered releases were worth watching. Abrams in my opinion has finally broken that trend because both of his movies deliver. The future of the ""Star Trek"" film franchise may once again be a tough one to read though. With Abrams also taking on the future ""Star Wars"" films, it makes you wonder if ""Star Trek"" will suffer. For now though, we have ""Into Darkness"" and it is exactly what you pay money for at the movies; a film that delivers on all levels of excitement and emotion.Bottom line though, the original cast of this amazing series should be extremely proud. Not only did they lay the groundwork for a series that has spanned almost 50 years but the actors in the current movies are playing them; recreating them. That doesn't always happen when movies are remade. Yet, these current actors are paying homage to a cast of actors who couldn't have possibly known what they were starting in 1966.",4,FUN and LOYAL,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2854,"['Star', 'Trek', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'first', 'airing', 'NBC', 'network', '1966', 'other', 'franchise', 'following', 'fans', 'span', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'same', 'fans', 'Star', 'Trek', 'star-trekkie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'deviation', 'So', 'when', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'took', 'over', 'movie', 'franchise', 'almost', 'exactly', '4-years', 'ago', 'was', 'excitement', 'hesitation', 'Abrams', 'not', 'only', 'revitalized', 'series', 'had', 'presumably', 'died', 'went', 'back', 'beginning', 'characters', 'originally', 'fleshed', 'out', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'DeForest', 'Kelley', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'James', 'Doohan', 'George', 'Takei', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'started', 'over', 'top', 'due', 'events', '2009', 'movie', 'wiped', 'everything', 'ever', 'happened', 'characters', 'episode', 'movie', 'clean', 'never', 'happened', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'combination', 'new', 'ideas', 'classic', 'stories', 'Abrams', 'making', 'point', 'doing', 'new', 'things', 'going', 'new', 'places', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'nostalgic', 'trekkies', 'like', 'Star', 'Trek', 'more', 'first', 'born', 'actors', 'especially', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Kirk', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Spock', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Pine', 'classic', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'charm', 'charisma', 'wit', 'cockiness', 'Quinto', 'so', 'good', 'Spock', 'even', 'trekkies', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'less', 'establishing', 'connection', 'fans', 'having', 'fun', 'Not', 'say', 'Abrams', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'considered', 'effort', 'connect', 'longtime', 'fans', 'first', 'movie', 'managed', 'slip', 'wide', 'spread', 'approval', 'taken', 'gloves', 'let', 'action', 'fly', 'opening', 'moments', 'film', 'closing', 'credits', 'movie', 'constantly', 'interesting', 'action-packed', 'intelligent', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'do', 'right', 'Yet', 'Abrams', 'also', 'emotional', 'impact', 'theme', 'film', 'leadership', 'friendship.There', 'popular', 'assessment', 'history', 'Star', 'Trek', 'films', 'only', 'even', 'numbered', 'releases', 'were', 'worth', 'watching', 'Abrams', 'opinion', 'finally', 'broken', 'trend', 'movies', 'deliver', 'future', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'franchise', 'may', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'tough', 'one', 'read', 'Abrams', 'also', 'taking', 'future', 'Star', 'Wars', 'films', 'wonder', 'Star', 'Trek', 'will', 'suffer', 'now', 'have', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'exactly', 'what', 'pay', 'money', 'movies', 'film', 'levels', 'excitement', 'emotion.Bottom', 'line', 'original', 'cast', 'amazing', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'extremely', 'proud', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'series', 'spanned', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'actors', 'current', 'movies', 'are', 'playing', 'recreating', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'remade', 'current', 'actors', 'are', 'paying', 'homage', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'possibly', 'known', 'what', 'were', 'starting', '1966']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1587864,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B009934S5M,Christopher Engel,"[12, 16]","In an effort to both be its own film and retain the spirit of the original Star Trek, this reminds me of the old proverb, &#34;Chase two rabbits, and you'll lose both.&#34; Couldn't be any truer here.The real problem here is a gross lack of story. The more you think about it, the more you realize, not a lot happened during the film. If anything was *going* to happen, they rushed through it as fast as humanly possible to get to more CG action.None of the characters are really developed at all from the last film, and while Khan *looks* cool and Benedict tries really hard to give him character, the writing just gives zero room for it. We get the briefest glimpse into who he is and sort of what he's trying to do.But through and through, the film can't figure out what it wants to be. We don't really focus on anything in particular. We get a hodgepodge of characters, but they don't develop, they just act. Khan ends up as nothing more than a cartoon character. Virtually no exposition, no background, and not even so much as a hint of what the hell Project Genesis was all about. Benedict gets no opportunity to develop his character, or his relationship to his crew. What made the original so great is just, well, not there. They just don't follow that.Now, that would be perfectly fine if what they *did* follow was interesting. But it doesn't bother with that. There's so much nothing going on, it just doesn't ever amount to anything substantial.It truly feels like half a film, and they certainly don't even bother to hide that they're loading up for another sequel. But it feels like half a film because we get the action part of things, but none of the &#34;Why should we care?&#34; part of things, which is kind of critical.Kirk is Kirk, Spock is Spock, everyone's everyone from the first film. But there's no real development. There's a tiny bit with Kirk, but just not enough. And the switcheroo they pull for the twist feels horribly forced, and also a bit saccharine, killing off whatever chance for drama there could have been.It's really sad that nothing works here, which is simply because too little happens in such a long timespan. We get the Klingons literally for about five minutes (and they look ridiculous. Bright blue eyes? 'The hell?), we sort of get Khan *once* while he's talking to Kirk at one point for less than five minutes, and the rest is nothing more than nonstop action.Look, action is fine in any film. But you've got to give me a reason to *care* about what's going on. The whole film felt like it was leading up to something interesting, but it never does. It ends so abruptly and without much really occurring, with an ending that is literally nothing more than setting up the next film, that it can't accomplish anything.Very, very disappointing. Feels like one of those films that had enough executive meddling and arguing to the point that everyone conceded and got a *little* of what they wanted, but nothing added up at the end. If all you want is action with no drama or character to speak of, well, go for it.

1587866,A2U5U2WZMUZNPZ,B009934S5M,"Christopher J. OToole ""cotoole""","[2, 3]","First, let me say I have been a fan of Star Trek since the first series was being broadcast the first time. I've watched all the shows and all the movies. I have seen some episodes and some movies which were awesome, and some which sucked. This one is squarely in the middle. If you were new to the series, this is probably an amazing film. Lot's of action, amazing effects. To me, however, I just can't stand the fact every time someone new comes along, they need to change the established. Like most fans, I accepted the Klingons when they were re-designed for the movies and then the subsequent television shows. Why in the hell did we have to redesign them again? Then, there is the U.S.S. Vengeance. Seriously, we are supposed to believe an Admiral is going off the reservation and building a ship like that without others knowing about it? And if it is an approved ship by Starfleet, I can't imagine it getting the name Vengeance. The Enterprise was a fairly new ship, commissioned just a couple years earlier and we are expected to believe it is that outclassed with new weapons and shields. Seriously, if the Admiralty is concerned about the Klingons enough to authorize the construction of the Vengeance, would they not be upgrading the fleet with improved weapons and shields, if not speed, as the technology becomes available? Enterprise was a new ship with a Captain who just recently saved the Earth from destruction, if that is not a ship likely to face immediate upgrades, I can't imagine which would.And, why in the hell would they park the Enterprise under an ocean? What possible need would there be for something stupid like that? The fact they stopped the volcano was a violation of the Prime Directive, it's all they needed to get Kirk in trouble with Starfleet. They did not need to hide it under a damned ocean. It would be out of sight in orbit.I liked the idea of a reboot, it freed the new series of movies to run in new directions without having to worry about keeping up with almost 50 years of established &#34;history&#34;. But, let's be honest, a change in the timeline would not affect the look of the Klingons. Maybe their ships, though frankly, I don't really see that either, since the timeline change affected mostly the Federation. And what the heck was that with the exploding moon around Kronos? Seriously? We know it did eventually become unstable and receive damage, but, again, that would not have happened at such an accelerated pace because of the affects of the first movie.Oh, and I appreciate the nod to the troops, nice to see from Hollywood, but, no missing scenes? A couple of the cut scenes were very important to the first film, I wonder what else is missing from this film that would fix a few gaps.The good, as I said, it's got a lot of action, a lot of great effects. If you don't take the science to seriously and know nothing of the first 48 years of Star Trek, you'll probably love this movie. The scene of the Enterprise rising out of the ocean and later rising from the clouds, reminiscent of the rising from the dust cloud in space, is beautiful, and if you suspend your imagination, you'd enjoy it. The actors are great, the story is certainly interesting. Again, you have to avoid giving it any thought, but, frankly, most action movies suffer from that as well. I wish the creative team would try to keep some things the way we fans have grown to love it, but, it was a fun movie. I look forward to the next one.",4,"Big Star Trek fan, but, this has some things that bug me",1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,3476,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'first', 'series', 'was', 'being', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'shows', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'movies', 'were', 'awesome', 'sucked', 'one', 'squarely', 'middle', 'were', 'new', 'series', 'probably', 'amazing', 'film', 'Lot', 'action', 'amazing', 'effects', 'however', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'fact', 'time', 'someone', 'new', 'along', 'need', 'change', 'established', 'most', 'fans', 'accepted', 'Klingons', 'when', 'were', 're-designed', 'movies', 'then', 'subsequent', 'television', 'shows', 'Why', 'hell', 'did', 'have', 'redesign', 'again', 'Then', 'U.S.S', 'Vengeance', 'Seriously', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Admiral', 'going', 'off', 'reservation', 'building', 'ship', 'others', 'knowing', 'approved', 'ship', 'Starfleet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'getting', 'name', 'Vengeance', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'fairly', 'new', 'ship', 'commissioned', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'outclassed', 'new', 'weapons', 'shields', 'Seriously', 'Admiralty', 'concerned', 'Klingons', 'enough', 'authorize', 'construction', 'Vengeance', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'upgrading', 'fleet', 'improved', 'weapons', 'shields', 'not', 'speed', 'technology', 'available', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'new', 'ship', 'Captain', 'who', 'just', 'recently', 'saved', 'Earth', 'destruction', 'not', 'ship', 'likely', 'face', 'immediate', 'upgrades', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would.And', 'why', 'hell', 'would', 'park', 'Enterprise', 'ocean', 'What', 'possible', 'need', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'something', 'stupid', 'fact', 'stopped', 'volcano', 'was', 'violation', 'Prime', 'Directive', 'needed', 'get', 'Kirk', 'trouble', 'Starfleet', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'hide', 'damned', 'ocean', 'would', 'be', 'sight', 'orbit.I', 'liked', 'idea', 'reboot', 'freed', 'new', 'series', 'movies', 'run', 'new', 'directions', 'having', 'worry', 'keeping', 'up', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'established', '34', 'history', '34', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'change', 'timeline', 'would', 'not', 'affect', 'look', 'Klingons', 'Maybe', 'ships', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'timeline', 'change', 'affected', 'mostly', 'Federation', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'exploding', 'moon', 'Kronos', 'Seriously', 'know', 'did', 'eventually', 'become', 'unstable', 'receive', 'damage', 'again', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'accelerated', 'pace', 'affects', 'first', 'movie.Oh', 'appreciate', 'nod', 'troops', 'nice', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'missing', 'scenes', 'couple', 'cut', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'important', 'first', 'film', 'wonder', 'what', 'else', 'missing', 'film', 'would', 'fix', 'few', 'gaps.The', 'good', 'said', 'got', 'lot', 'action', 'lot', 'great', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'science', 'seriously', 'know', 'nothing', 'first', '48', 'years', 'Star', 'Trek', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'scene', 'Enterprise', 'rising', 'ocean', 'later', 'rising', 'clouds', 'reminiscent', 'rising', 'dust', 'cloud', 'space', 'beautiful', 'suspend', 'imagination', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'Again', 'have', 'avoid', 'giving', 'thought', 'frankly', 'most', 'action', 'movies', 'suffer', 'as', 'well', 'wish', 'creative', 'team', 'would', 'try', 'keep', 'things', 'way', 'fans', 'have', 'grown', 'love', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'one']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Now I can start out by saying I'm not a real Star Trek fan, I grew up watching a few of the TV episodes and movies.

Kinda like they got 3/4 of the way through a movie, realized they didn't have an ending, so stole and rewrote (badly)the ending from one of the franchise's classics. Too many momentary shots of corny looking alien characters, in make-up, appearing to be inspired partially from Mary Poppins, and part from the Star Wars cantina scene. Special effects weren't so well executed and what the story line lacked in comprehension, it failed to compensate for with a nervous urgency to move on to the next action sequence. The token homage to the original cast, by incorporating ""original timeline Spock"" into the story is really lame and cliche now, as it was the first time. Not much here to recommend, except the Spock & Bones characterizations, capture the original series portrayals, pretty well, while updating themselves, into their roles a bit. The rest of it, not so much. Like the Bond movies, Beatles tribute bands and Twinkies, these brands are reaching the end of their use by dates.

1587917,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B009934S5M,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[17, 27]","J. J. Abrams (Super 8, Alias, Fringe, Lost) has excelled in television and movies particularly resurrecting Star Trek by reinventing its essence for new audiences while respecting its origins.  In Star Trek Into Darkness, he expands on keys characters and continues his mastery of plot and non-stop action.  As summer entertainment, it is a class act and sends the science fiction/adventure series on a spectacular trajectory.  It is also the best Star Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan.Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are pursued by a primitive tribe on an alien planet as Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempts to prevent a catastrophic volcanic explosion from within.  Their activities call into the question The Prime Directive where nothing should alter a civilization from without.  In fact, Kirk's outrageous, rule-breaking behavior gets him in hot water with mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Starfleet.  At the same time, a horrifying explosion in London reveals the presence of a mysterious man (Benedict Cumberbatch) named John Harrison, who exhibits a remarkable intellect and physical prowess.  The cryptic Harrison is pursued to Kronos, home planet to the warrior race of Klingons and the threat of all out war.  Overseeing the mission directive is Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whose presence is felt in unexpected ways.  It all leads to a revelation that threatens not only the Enterprise, but Starfleet and Earth.As the original TV series often dealt with contemporary issues, there are strong parallels with current headlines in the form of terrorism.  In fact much of the film has a grim, dark tone as the crew must face a superior, ruthless adversary, and a couple scenes of mass destruction have a 9/11 feel.  There are a number of references to the old TV series and original Trek films as names, locales, music, and even dialogue are lifted and cleverly interjected.  Tribbles, anyone?  And you've got to love those retro uniforms especially Saldana's!Pike and Kirk have what amounts to a father-son relationship, and this is tested in a pivotal moment.  We witness this relatively new crew as it becomes more cohesive under duress, and that is part of the fun as we watch McCoy's character and the beginnings of his amusing, trademark gripes.  There are plenty of heroics from our stars, and Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) shine in key moments.  You only wish to see if the classic trio (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) could mix it up more, but you do see the core beginnings of their dynamic bond.  There are strong, recurring themes of loyalty and sacrifice for the good of the majority, or in other words, ""the needs of the many...""Cumberbatch, (TVs current Sherlock Holmes) is outstanding as a powerful adversary.  Weller is particularly effective as the imposing Admiral with a hidden agenda.The visual effects are impressively on display when the starship Enterprise explodes into warp speed and when devastating terrorist acts decimate a major city.  The pacing is quite good, so don't think too hard on credibility gaps.  Where does Harrison come from?  Anybody check his blood type?  Why is Starfleet headquarters virtually unguarded?  And what's the deal on those torpedoes?Abrams is a master showman and he knows how to engineer cliffhangers upon cliffhangers.  The film has a memorable climax that will ring d&eacute;j&agrave; vu with a twist, but is nonetheless quite emotional.  It solidifies the Kirk-Spock relationship forever and could have served as one of the best endings in Trekdom, but the filmmakers chose to springboard to another exciting moment which leaves the door open for future adventures of the five year kind.

He is way more intense than the original character in the old series. Spock is more emotionally connected in this new series which I also find appealing and more realistic. Nichelle was a tough act to follow but Zoe is great as Uhura; I like the fact that her character has more intellectual depth in the new series and her mad communication skills are more in the forefront. A viable difference between the perception of women between the original series and today. The new character's fluent Klingon in this film contrasts sharply with the stumbling dialogue of the original Uhura character during the conversation with the Rura Penthe outpost guards in &#34;Undiscovered Country&#34;. Karl Urban as Bones is probably the most like the original character. He delivers solid continuity between the old and the new. Chris' acting style is refreshingly different from William's and he portrays the character with fresh precision and realism. The new Star Trek characters keep the best of the old and add a fresh modern flavor which makes them relevant and engaging.

There were two disapointments of my summer 2013 movie viewing and you are looking at one of them!I know usually directors are chosen not because they are familiar with said franchises, but mostly what exactly can they bring to the table. Here, we clearly see that Abrams was wanting to direct something more like Star Wars. Or he wanted to see how one could Michael Bay-conjure up a form of fan fiction. I'll admit that I did enjoy some parts of it when it actually wanted to present a story and setting. The mystery of this terrorist did invoke some interest within me as I was eager to watch Benedict Cumberbatch's acting once again and this time in a science fiction setting.HOWEVER, as soon as the big reveal occurs- Oh come on, it's been a year by now, you should know it already- But whenKHHHHAAANNNNN is apparent, all of my enjoyment and want of suspense went out the airlock. The sad part, I and along with any Star Trek fan guessed correctly what this movie was about from the very first trailer released.Me: ""It's Wrath of Khan 2.0 isn't it, Mr. Abrams?""Abrams: ""Actually no, (insert very long explanation)Me: ""So it's Wrath of Khan 2.0 and you are completely lieing after the fact that we figured it out already?""Abrams: ""See, that is where you are wrong, the plot elements involving Harrison-Me: ""Seriously, I know it's Khan. Stop hiding it. Wait, Khan was never British, particulary a very white British man!""Abrams: ""No, we're doing something completely different here, in fact you'll be sur-Me: (insert sound of me getting up from my chair and just walking away)Seriously, did any of these ""Star Trek fans"" get that vibe that this movie was just tryng to appease by literally adding references from the TV show and movies without even knowing the significance or meaning? In Star Trek II, Spock dying meant something because Spock and Kirk had a freindship that lasted years, and years that I garuantee were much longer and heartfelt than this ""let's assume they are super best buds!"" scenario. I'm sorry guys, but Zachary Quinto's Khan moan was just laughable. It was less cheesey, but felt forced on and not as fun as Bill Shat's. Hell, they even have another cameo that just proves that Abrams didn't want to try to fold out anything unique anymore. ""Hey guys, while we're at it, let's add old Spock in again to remind everybody that THIS IS STAR TREK! So everytime the crew are in a bind, they just ask Old Spock for the asnwers! Even though Lenoard Nimoy cleary stated in the first entry that he should not mess with thier destiny. Then, the super blood magical solution at the end of the film. Even Karl Urban tried to sell it as something as illogical and totally perplexing. This was literally the low point of the film. The movie could have completely made ammends if Abrams had the balls to keep ""said character"" dead and created a brand new path for Star Trek....but no, let's use that super blood because why not? So while were are ahead, LET'S ADD SOME DESTRUCTION CLICHES! Seriously, what exactly is causing all of these damn lens flares during calmer and not calm sections of the film? Is there a department of the CGI effects crew that is only devoted to randomly inserting lens flares for no reason? And how exaclty is this a Star ""TREK"" movie when there is little to none? They trek once to a Klingon planet (which the Klingons look extremley terrible here, I'm sorry) but then it turns into an earth based conspiracy plot. There is 0 exploration or anything that makes watching this as a true Star Trek experience. Come on, already! This is the sophomore title! You are supposed to go above and beyond to break boundaries! Not stay put in the same setting! And here I thought the first entry was going crazy with the desctuction of Vulcan and the timeline changes, but now I appreciate it more because it was more in tune with Star Trek than Into Darkness! Seriously, WHY THE HELL IS IT CALL 'Into Darkness!?'It's not a completely terrible movie. If you perfer more action with your sci-fi tales, then this will hit your fancy. I do admit to liking Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in these films. They do get the job done with younger Kirk and Spock, but I wished that Abrams and crew created a new setting instead of rebooting characters. It was nice watching Peter Weller act again because it seems it has been awhile. don't expect anything grand with Alic Eve's role. Her character is in there for another Wrath of Kahn reference only to be sexy instead of interesting. They even undermined Zoe Saldana's acting potential by providing an argument with Spock. Way to go Robert Orcci! You know how to treat women in the future. (sigh).Into Darkness (seriously dumbest title EVER!) is one of those movies that it will either disappoint you or it will make you go through your popcorn bucket.Oh, and I read that Paramount did something with the special features for physical releases. Hey, not only you (if you disliked this movie) get ripped off at the box office, but you get ripped off at home!Sorry, I just found this movie more illogical than fun to watch. I really wanted to like it, but too many Yellow Alerts popped up as soon as the first trailer hit. Then it went full Red Alert when the big reveal.(incoming Trekkie whine)If these reboots are based around the old series, then when did Star Fleet patent weapon systems to be functional in mid warp?

1587942,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B009934S5M,DanD,"[0, 2]","The first STAR TREK reboot was something refreshing.  Pleasing enough to fans, a delightful film to those like me who only had a fleeting brush with the TREK legacy.  It featured a freshly complex plot (which demanded repeated viewings), superb acting, brilliant effects, and the stubborn mastery of J. J. Abrams, whom love or hate, always does things his own way.  What the first TREK lacked, however, was a villain.Enter INTO DARKNESS.  When a nobody, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), declares all-out war on Star Fleet Command, it prompts panic, confusion, and terror.  James Kirk (Chris Pine) finds himself behind the helm of the Enterprise once more, with his trust crew in tow.  As he wrangles yet again with his personality foil Spock (Zachary Quinto), Kirk faces the greatest challenge of his young life: a mission of vengeance and nobility, once where darkness lurks in the most unlikeliest of places...and death waits for no man.Okay, melodrama aside, STARK TREK INTO DARKNESS is a fantastic film.  The acting is on-par with, if not better than, the first (ignoring Eric Bana's unusually wooden turn as that film's villain).  Pine gets to show a little more range, as does Quinto; meanwhile, Simon Pegg gets in some nice zingers, and Bruce Greenwood has a few great moments.  One nice surprise here is Peter Weller, as the Star Fleet commander; it's nice to see him in a prominent role again, getting some nice material to chew through.But of course, the talk is all about Cumberbatch.  The entire cast (especially Pine, Greenwood, Quinto, and Weller) deserves high praise...but a deliciously delightful villain always steals the show.  There's not exactly anything we haven't seen before; rather, it's we haven't seen it on this high-tech of a scale: a solid, menacing performance set against high-octane action and brilliant special effects.  What's more, for the uninitiated, the role is an unpredictable one.  The film as a whole throws a few nice knocks, and some interesting homages.  J. J. Abrams and company are keen to keep old fans while recruiting new ones.  STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS isn't an original film, per say (part of that is intentional, understand); but it's still a refreshing one, with great performances, great effects, and a killer plot.

A few things came a minor surprises, but most was pretty predictable.  The 'enemy' starship was incredible!  I advise it to any action or sci-fi fan.However, there are a few things that bugged me and kept me from enjoying it fully.  Apparently, with the suspension of the normal behavior of gravity came the ability for people to walk on walls.  When a starship has power, it apparently just hangs in space, and as soon as it loses power, it falls directly toward Earth, never mind the fact that the nearest gravity well is the Moon.  While falling, and having no power, apparently the people inside don't experience freefall, but rather have to deal with 'down' being the direction toward Earth, regardless of where they are in space, and thus the wall walking.  Also, the skinniest guy on the crew is apparently able to pull two of the heftier crew members up with one arm, as well, despite what seems like Earth normal gravity.  Also, the momentum built up from falling from a near lunar orbit down to Earth's cloud layer is reversible in just a couple seconds, without affecting the crew.  The rest I can't talk about without major spoilers, so I'll just leave it with this.I only take one star off for those blaring missteps.  JJ really failed us on that aspect, but I forgive him.

1587954,A3QU74B9N0830G,B009934S5M,Dan Thompson,"[5, 9]","In Star Trek Into Darkness, his follow-up to 2009's blockbuster reimaginging of the Star Trek franchise, JJ Abrams delivers a visually spectacular and action-packed installment that's big on spectacle and a little forced on plot.The plot in its simplest form pits the crew of the Enterprise against a mysterious and vicious figure known as John Harrison, a former member of Starfleet who commits an act of terrorism against London and flees to a war-zone planet outside the neutral zone. Captain Kirk and his crew embark on a manhunt to capture Harrison with the hopes of exacting revenge and preventing further bloodshed.The film itself looks fantastic; Abrams is a true master of visuals and spectacle, both of which are on huge display here. The cityscapes, set pieces, and space effects, including travel and starships, are incredibly detailed and a wonder to behold.The cast, as in the previous film, are equally enjoyable to watch; Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have really nailed their respective characters in Kirk and Spock and have a lot more camaraderie this time around. The rest of the fantastic crew has returned for this installment as well, including Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and Bruce Greenwood. As for the newcomers, Peter Weller is well cast in his role as Admiral Marcus, the man responsible for sending Kirk to catch Harrison. Alice Eve is also very good as Carol Marcus, reassigned science officer of the Enterprise and daughter of Admiral Marcus. The biggest newcomer to the film is that of the villain, played by the increasingly intriguing and engaging Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays his part extremely well and, for me, is one of the highlights of the film.Alas, if only the story could have been as strong as the visuals and cast. The plot, while entertaining as hell and lot of fun to watch, has quite a few holes that can simply be chalked up to sloppy writing. I'll keep this review spoiler-free but there were multiple instances I found myself scratching my head because of what was unfolding onscreen. While this didn't detract from the fun I had while watching the movie, I found myself thinking more and more about the problems with the script afterwards. Don't get me wrong; the film is an outstanding summer blockbuster that will hold its own in the Trek catalog, it just contains a few plot points that were either too convenient or too unexplained for my taste.Overall this is a really good follow-up in the rebooted Star Trek universe and has everything an summer popcorn-flick should. Though it does have some plot issues, I highly recommend this if you're a fan of action blockbusters, sci-fi, or the 2009 reboot.",4,"Terrific Installment to the Reimagined Franchise, Though Does Contain Some Problems",1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,2692,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'follow-up', '2009', 'blockbuster', 'reimaginging', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'action-packed', 'installment', 'big', 'spectacle', 'little', 'forced', 'plot.The', 'plot', 'simplest', 'form', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'mysterious', 'vicious', 'figure', 'known', 'John', 'Harrison', 'former', 'member', 'Starfleet', 'who', 'act', 'terrorism', 'London', 'flees', 'war-zone', 'planet', 'neutral', 'zone', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'embark', 'manhunt', 'capture', 'Harrison', 'hopes', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'preventing', 'further', 'bloodshed.The', 'film', 'fantastic', 'Abrams', 'true', 'master', 'visuals', 'spectacle', 'are', 'huge', 'display', 'here', 'cityscapes', 'set', 'pieces', 'space', 'effects', 'including', 'travel', 'starships', 'are', 'incredibly', 'detailed', 'wonder', 'behold.The', 'cast', 'previous', 'film', 'are', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'have', 'really', 'nailed', 'respective', 'characters', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'camaraderie', 'time', 'around', 'rest', 'fantastic', 'crew', 'returned', 'installment', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'John', 'Cho', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'newcomers', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'well', 'cast', 'role', 'Admiral', 'Marcus', 'man', 'responsible', 'sending', 'Kirk', 'catch', 'Harrison', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'reassigned', 'science', 'officer', 'Enterprise', 'daughter', 'Admiral', 'Marcus', 'biggest', 'newcomer', 'film', 'villain', 'played', 'increasingly', 'intriguing', 'engaging', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'who', 'part', 'extremely', 'well', 'one', 'highlights', 'film.Alas', 'only', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'strong', 'visuals', 'cast', 'plot', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'quite', 'few', 'holes', 'can', 'simply', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'sloppy', 'writing', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'review', 'spoiler-free', 'were', 'multiple', 'instances', 'found', 'scratching', 'head', 'what', 'was', 'unfolding', 'onscreen', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'fun', 'had', 'watching', 'movie', 'found', 'thinking', 'more', 'more', 'problems', 'script', 'afterwards', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'film', 'outstanding', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'will', 'hold', 'own', 'Trek', 'catalog', 'just', 'few', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'convenient', 'too', 'unexplained', 'taste.Overall', 'really', 'good', 'follow-up', 'rebooted', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'everything', 'summer', 'popcorn-flick', 'should', 'have', 'plot', 'issues', 'highly', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'fan', 'action', 'blockbusters', 'sci-fi', '2009', 'reboot']",Star Trek Into Darkness

When I first heard that Benedict Cumberbatch was going to be in the new Star Trek movie, I thought that he did a wonderful job in Sherlock but what can he add to the Star Trek saga aside from the fact that he and Leonard Nimoy have ties to Bilbo Baggins.  Perhaps Gollum would make a surprise appearance with Bilbo and Spock will sing the Ballad of Bilbo Baggins.  So I was very hesitant when I went to see this movie and boy....I was so very wrong!!  Star Trek Into Darkness is now the new gold standard for the entire Star Trek series.The story was fast paced and kept the audiences attention in our theater.  My wife, who has absolutely no knowledge about Star Trek, really enjoyed watching the movie so much so that she wants to see the prior Star Trek movie.  As for me, I thought the movie excelled because of Benedict Cumberbatch as ""John Harrison"".  In several scenes, you could actually hear people gasping at what Mr. Cumberbatch was doing on the screen.  He would suddenly appear or do something so shocking that you would be jumping out of your seat.  In the end, you could actually believe that he is a superior being capable of outwitting the entire Federation.  His performance alone was well worth the price of a ticket.Also it was great to see Peter Weller back on the screen again.  I hope he will do more movies in the future and step away from academia for a bit.By the time the movie was finished, people were actually giving the movie a standing ovation.

1587972,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B009934S5M,David A. Wend,"[1, 2]","Having read some of the negative reviews of Star Trek into Darkness I was expecting a scene by scene rip off of The Wrath of Khan from 1982. In reality, the new Star Trek film is more a remake or even a prequel to the first film.  The plot changes are substantial with Benedict Cumberbatch's coldly calculating Khan seeking revenge for the supposed murder of his crew and Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus, who uses Khan to develop super weapons and sends the Enterprise to unwittingly start a war with the Kligons.  While there are some similarities to the Wrath of Khan (a few lines of dialogue and the reactor malfunction) the new Star Trek has a refreshing plot line with the creation of a new and fascinating Khan.For me, this really an ensemble film with the actors filling out their roles from the first film.  The interactions between Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachery Quinto mirror that of William Shattner and Leonard Nimoy but they add their own spin to their characters, making them their own. The supporting cast -  John Cho (as Sulu), Simon Pegg (as Scotty), Anton Yelchin (as Chekov), and Karl Urban (as McCoy) - all have sizeable roles in the film.  Simon Pegg and Karl Urban were especially fun to see with McCoy's one liners and Scotty's excitability over the state of the Enterprise's engines.JJ Abrams provides the same high level of action as he did in his first venture into the Star Trek franchise. The mix of action and character development is well-balanced. The special effects fit the story rather than the other way around. The futuristic San Francisco was marvelous to behold.

1587977,AGCVPCMDY4Q2W,B009934S5M,David Harvey,"[1, 2]","Star Trek Into Darkness brings us a kind nod to Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, just without Kirk's son, the planet Genesis, or the death of Spock.  Of course, those that are not familiar with the original Trek films will not necessarily follow what I am referring to, which is fine as this film stands on its own.  Personally, my favorite part is the cameo of Lenard Nimoy reprising his role of Spock (or Spock Prime for those that recall the title credits from the previous film).  While I did see Lenard Nimoy's name in the credits of this film, I was disappointed that they did not tie his name to the character he portrayed, ah well.  The story's opening is a little confusing with the Enterprise being hidden in the ocean of an M Class planet.  The problem that is created is Kirk taking the ship out of the ocean and the planet's inhabitants witnessing the Enterprise leaving the ocean in an endeavor to rescue Spock.  My issue with this is, how would the inhabitants not see the Enterprise leaving the ocean, even if he had not gone after Spock.  At any rate, I get that the story needed a vehicle to have Kirk (temporarily) removed from being captain of the Enterprise to drive the story.  From there the story switches to the introduction of Khan and the start of his mission against the Federation.  Without giving away the details, the &#34;good&#34; guys win the day but instead of Khan meeting a gruesome end as in &#34;Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan&#34;, this Khan is stuck in a cryogenic tube and put into storage along with his crew.",4,Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan...sort of,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1551,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'kind', 'nod', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'just', 'Kirk', 'son', 'planet', 'Genesis', 'death', 'Spock', 'course', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'Trek', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'necessarily', 'follow', 'what', 'am', 'referring', 'fine', 'film', 'own', 'Personally', 'favorite', 'part', 'cameo', 'Lenard', 'Nimoy', 'reprising', 'role', 'Spock', 'Spock', 'Prime', 'recall', 'title', 'credits', 'previous', 'film', 'did', 'see', 'Lenard', 'Nimoy', 'name', 'credits', 'film', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'tie', 'name', 'character', 'portrayed', 'ah', 'well', 'story', 'opening', 'little', 'confusing', 'Enterprise', 'being', 'hidden', 'ocean', 'M', 'Class', 'planet', 'problem', 'created', 'Kirk', 'taking', 'ship', 'ocean', 'planet', 'inhabitants', 'witnessing', 'Enterprise', 'leaving', 'ocean', 'endeavor', 'rescue', 'Spock', 'issue', 'how', 'would', 'inhabitants', 'not', 'see', 'Enterprise', 'leaving', 'ocean', 'even', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'Spock', 'rate', 'get', 'story', 'needed', 'vehicle', 'have', 'Kirk', 'temporarily', 'removed', 'being', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'drive', 'story', 'story', 'switches', 'introduction', 'Khan', 'start', 'mission', 'Federation', 'giving', 'away', 'details', '34', 'good', '34', 'guys', 'win', 'day', 'instead', 'Khan', 'meeting', 'gruesome', 'end', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', '34', 'Khan', 'stuck', 'cryogenic', 'tube', 'put', 'storage', 'crew']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Rossi,"[7, 13]","One aspect of this film that demands more of a mention is something that has been sorely lacking in most of the Trek films through the years: Suspense. The original series had some truly suspenseful, nail biting moments that were unlike any suspense seen anywhere before. The Enterprise Incident, Obsession, Day Of The Dove and The Doomsday Machine all had moments of edge of your seat suspense and there were several others, but when it came to the films, something malfunctioned on the level of a major engineering blunder that would send Mr Scott into a tizzy: The suspense was largely gone. Seems impossible, given that with a film, there are MORE opportunities for intense suspense thanks to more time and better budgets which could lead to more elaborate plot points that could create tense situations, but alas, Star Trek got it wrong..... until now.With Star Trek Into Darkness we are treated to more suspense than the total sum of all suspenseful moments from the entire Original Series. If you're NOT on the edge of your seat watching this movie, trekker, trekkie or not, you must be a cliff diver or live on rollercoasters.Some of why the film is so suspenseful is the pacing itself. Abrams and his team barely allow you to recover from one suspenseful situation before the plot, which is excellent, hurls another one at you. That's not to say the film doesn't contain moments of heart and those humanistic elements Roddenberry built the franchise on, they are there, and in more abundance than has been recognized by other reviewers due to the pulse pounding action and incredible visual effects that will have you wanting to be a part of the Enterprise crew more than ever before.Abrams does a marvelous job at PROPERLY recreating in the new altered timeline everything that made the original series such a terrific show and he manages to make it fresh and appealing to everyone even more so than the first of his forays into the Star Trek universe.That there is a villain from a place you might not have seen coming (besides the villain that everyone has been muttering about, yes there are TWO villains in this film) that adds that topical touch of reflection of current headlines to the mix, another hallmark of much of the writing of the second and third seasons of the original series, is also a welcome plot point.To sum it up, Abrams and his crew have a huge uphill battle to endure now that they have so perfectly put together the most satisfying Trek film ever created. Here's hoping Abrams is up to the challenge and that he will continue going where no man has gone before.",5,it's all about the suspense,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,2597,"['One', 'aspect', 'film', 'more', 'mention', 'something', 'been', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'most', 'Trek', 'films', 'years', 'Suspense', 'original', 'series', 'had', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'nail', 'biting', 'moments', 'were', 'suspense', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'before', 'Enterprise', 'Incident', 'Obsession', 'Day', 'Dove', 'Doomsday', 'Machine', 'had', 'moments', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'were', 'several', 'others', 'when', 'came', 'films', 'something', 'malfunctioned', 'level', 'major', 'engineering', 'blunder', 'would', 'send', 'Mr', 'Scott', 'tizzy', 'suspense', 'was', 'largely', 'gone', 'Seems', 'impossible', 'given', 'film', 'are', 'MORE', 'opportunities', 'intense', 'suspense', 'thanks', 'more', 'time', 'better', 'budgets', 'could', 'lead', 'more', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'points', 'could', 'create', 'tense', 'situations', 'alas', 'Star', 'Trek', 'got', 'wrong', '..', 'now.With', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'suspense', 'total', 'sum', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'entire', 'Original', 'Series', ""'re"", 'NOT', 'edge', 'seat', 'watching', 'movie', 'trekker', 'trekkie', 'not', 'must', 'be', 'cliff', 'diver', 'live', 'rollercoasters.Some', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'suspenseful', 'pacing', 'Abrams', 'team', 'barely', 'allow', 'recover', 'one', 'suspenseful', 'situation', 'plot', 'excellent', 'hurls', 'one', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'contain', 'moments', 'heart', 'humanistic', 'elements', 'Roddenberry', 'built', 'franchise', 'are', 'there', 'more', 'abundance', 'been', 'recognized', 'other', 'reviewers', 'due', 'pulse', 'pounding', 'action', 'incredible', 'visual', 'effects', 'will', 'have', 'wanting', 'be', 'part', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'more', 'ever', 'before.Abrams', 'marvelous', 'job', 'PROPERLY', 'recreating', 'new', 'altered', 'timeline', 'everything', 'made', 'original', 'series', 'terrific', 'show', 'make', 'fresh', 'appealing', 'everyone', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'forays', 'Star', 'Trek', 'villain', 'place', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'villain', 'everyone', 'been', 'muttering', 'about', 'yes', 'are', 'TWO', 'villains', 'film', 'topical', 'touch', 'reflection', 'current', 'headlines', 'mix', 'hallmark', 'much', 'writing', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'original', 'series', 'also', 'welcome', 'plot', 'point.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Abrams', 'crew', 'have', 'huge', 'uphill', 'battle', 'endure', 'now', 'have', 'so', 'perfectly', 'put', 'together', 'most', 'satisfying', 'Trek', 'film', 'ever', 'created', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Abrams', 'up', 'challenge', 'will', 'continue', 'going', 'where', 'man', 'gone', 'before']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Eastwood,"[2, 4]","Viewers of STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS will probably fall into three categories: those who love it, those who hate it, and those who have very mixed feelings about it. And there will probably be many reasons for this, although one of the major reasons will be the degree of affection and loyalty a viewer feels for the original series and the movies that included the original cast members, especially THE WRATH OF KHAN.To me, one of the few ""bright spots"" in this often lame action film was the brief cameo appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Old Spock talking with Young Spock. To me and to several fellow Trekkies who are between 50 and 80, the original characters, played by the original cast, had great ""charm"" and ""warmth."" This new cast, to us, for the most part is cartoony and is doing a moderately competent parody of the originals. Try as some of us do, we just can't buy their performances, can't take them seriously, because they haven't grown on us over a series of years, even decades. And if any were to die - as we thought Spock had ""really"" died in THE WRATH OF KHAN - we would not feel real grief and sorrow and pity for these newbies, as we did for the original Spock and Kirk and the others.Watching this film, I felt ""removed"" from it emotionally; it was a visual and intellectual experience with all the ""caring"" about the characters drained out. I could appreciate the ""cleverness"" of several special effects and several allusions the original series, and I could bet myself that X or Y or Z would be the way the script-writer would get the characters out of predicaments A, B, and C ... and 95 percent of the time I guessed right, which made me feel ""smart"" but also disappointed me that the script was so weak that even I (in my mid-70s) could predict virtually every plot twist at least ten minutes in advance.In the last half of this film, I sensed that parts of one major confrontation were deliberately parallel to recent and current Hawk-vs.-Dove foreign policy disputes in the U.S., and I was disappointed by the stereotyped shallowness and blatant dishonesty of one of those sides in this film. While I agreed with the point being made, I wished the characters had been given more depth and better lines - and that the ""solution"" had been more imaginative than the violent beat-down killing we see.I viewed STAR TREK: IN DARKNESS with a very disgusted Trekkie who thought this film was a ""desecration"" of the ""already perfect"" Khan story and who, at the end, rated it ""F-"". I myself rated it ""C-"", and we briefly argued about my ""high"" rating.Then I made a little pun that made that person lighten up: I said, ""It has some SUCK without much SESS."" Then I amended this to ""It was rather SUCK-CESSPOOL."" And then we agreed that we would not watch this film again.",3,"""INTO DARKNESS"" IS IRONICALLY THE RIGHT TITLE FOR THIS",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,2786,"['Viewers', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'INTO', 'DARKNESS', 'will', 'probably', 'fall', 'three', 'categories', 'who', 'love', 'who', 'hate', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'many', 'reasons', 'one', 'major', 'reasons', 'will', 'be', 'degree', 'affection', 'loyalty', 'viewer', 'feels', 'original', 'series', 'movies', 'included', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'especially', 'THE', 'WRATH', 'OF', 'KHAN.To', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'often', 'lame', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'brief', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Old', 'Spock', 'talking', 'Young', 'Spock', 'several', 'fellow', 'Trekkies', 'who', 'are', '50', '80', 'original', 'characters', 'played', 'original', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'charm', 'warmth', 'new', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'cartoony', 'doing', 'moderately', 'competent', 'parody', 'originals', 'Try', 'do', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'have', ""n't"", 'grown', 'series', 'years', 'even', 'decades', 'were', 'die', 'thought', 'Spock', 'had', 'really', 'died', 'THE', 'WRATH', 'OF', 'KHAN', 'would', 'not', 'feel', 'real', 'grief', 'sorrow', 'pity', 'newbies', 'did', 'original', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'others.Watching', 'film', 'felt', 'removed', 'emotionally', 'was', 'visual', 'intellectual', 'experience', 'caring', 'characters', 'drained', 'out', 'could', 'appreciate', 'cleverness', 'several', 'special', 'effects', 'several', 'allusions', 'original', 'series', 'could', 'bet', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'script-writer', 'would', 'get', 'characters', 'predicaments', 'A', 'B', 'C', '95', 'percent', 'time', 'guessed', 'right', 'made', 'feel', 'smart', 'also', 'disappointed', 'script', 'was', 'so', 'weak', 'even', 'mid-70s', 'could', 'predict', 'virtually', 'plot', 'twist', 'least', 'ten', 'minutes', 'advance.In', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'sensed', 'parts', 'one', 'major', 'confrontation', 'were', 'deliberately', 'parallel', 'recent', 'current', 'Hawk-vs.-Dove', 'foreign', 'policy', 'disputes', 'U.S.', 'was', 'disappointed', 'stereotyped', 'shallowness', 'blatant', 'dishonesty', 'one', 'sides', 'film', 'agreed', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'wished', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'depth', 'better', 'lines', 'solution', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'imaginative', 'violent', 'beat-down', 'killing', 'see.I', 'viewed', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'IN', 'DARKNESS', 'very', 'disgusted', 'Trekkie', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'desecration', 'already', 'perfect', 'Khan', 'story', 'who', 'end', 'rated', 'F-', 'rated', 'C-', 'briefly', 'argued', 'high', 'rating.Then', 'made', 'little', 'pun', 'made', 'person', 'lighten', 'up', 'said', 'SUCK', 'much', 'SESS', 'Then', 'amended', 'was', 'rather', 'SUCK-CESSPOOL', 'then', 'agreed', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'again']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I'm not Trekie enough to dress up or attend conventions, but I enjoy and admire the series, especially the historical continuity all the series tried hard to maintain.  J. J. Abrams has done some very fine film work, but his two CGI infested rapes of the Star Trek saga will never be find a place on my shelf.Had I never watched a moment of the Rodenberry and Rodenberry-inspired Star Trek saga, I would grant both films, at best, three stars and describe them as grossly over-CGIed and aimed at an audience without much of an attention span.  In other words, par for the Hollywood course.  But I have seen Rodenberry's work and those he inspired.  Even when he was bound and gagged by minuscule budget constraints everything on the original series, he did it so much better and with brain fully engaged.Both of Abrams' alternative versions destroy the history the various Star Trek series carefully constructed and maintained throughout a variety of series:  The destruction of Vulcan in the first film retained here; the out-of-character love interest between Spock and Uhura; the death of Christopher Pike that negates the original pilot later woven into a two-part story in the original series; an Enterprise bridge that looks nothing like the original; the frenetic behavior of every character except Spock that is nothing like the original characterizations (and this film ends where the TV series began); Carol Marcus's English accent in this film even though she was a an all-American girl in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.  And speaking of Kahn, Into Darkness is in part a mirror-image recycle of Star Trek II's conclusion.  (Really uncreative, J. J.  I saw it coming a mile away.)  Benedict Cumberbatch is a fine actor and suitably maniacal as Kahn, but he makes a better Sherlock Holmes where he can display a range of emotion.  Here, he is as expressionless as a statue, no doubt at Abrams' direction.  Ricardo Montelban brought so much more flair to the character - twice.  And I here enter a plea to all film makers to stop asking the human body to survive unscathed the physically impossible.  You don't need science fiction for that.  Watch any James Bond film.At the end of the film, I hoped mightily the Enterprise would burn up in Earth's atmosphere, take all its hyperactive characters with it, and end this series so Gene Rodenberry could rest peacefully in his grave.  I doubt I'll get my wish, but I won't waste time watching the inevitable third installment.",1,"Please, Mr. Abrams!

The actor doing Khan is terrible and horribly over acts every scene.  There is a lot of completely mindless action that really does nothing for the show.  The fifteen minutes spent flying through space, swerving around debris to get Kirk and Khan to the enemy ship is just stupid.  But worse than that, there are changes to the entire idea of Star Trek and how it was supposed to be about a better humanity that Abrams has essentially destroyed.  The future suddenly looks and feels - bleak.  And what was the thinking behind changes to the Klingons?  They look fake and just ridiculous.  Then we have plot lines which Abrams stole from the pages of Star Trek II (how we got there, chronologically, when the events of early Khan encounter haven't happened seems a stretch) - but trying to steal the emotional charge of the Spock dying scene just seemed contrived and had no impact whatsoever.As a Star Trek fan, I'm appalled at this latest feature.

Its now obvious Chris Pine is badly miscast, and its time to recast Uhura with a younger actress (Zoe Saldana is not aging as well as Nichelle Nichols did, she looks hungover and half asleep throughout) Its also time to abandon the Spock/Uhura romance, it just doesn't work.

Abrams reboot movie, which was just so dynamic and clean, but still a lot. I like what these guys are doing with the characters, with the ground-level view of the formative years of the Federation, and in particular with the concept of this being an alternate-reality Star Trek universe.The concept was introduced at the end of the first film, and even though I knew this, and consciously reminded myself of it before going into this second film, I still found myself halfway through the movie thinking, ""oh, thus-and-such can't happen, since it doesn't fit the continuity"" or ""I wonder how they're going to change that back so it'll fit in with what we know happens later..."" and it wasn't until way, way far in that I realized that this version of Star Trek is going to be a lot different than the ""reality"" we already know. It's a really profound divergence, and they are having a lot of fun with it. Me, too.We all left the theater psyched and ready for more: if the movie theater production schedule proves too ponderous, I sure hope they'll consider keeping this cast and crew together for a TV series. They're all doing great work, with a special shout-out to Zachary Quinto, who has definitively made the new-universe Spock his own. Great stuff. Bring on Number Three!

The action scenes were not as frenetic or jerky as in the previous movie, making them more believable and less disorienting. The story itself was driven more by the characters and their interaction was reminiscent of the original (TV) series. It took me a few scenes for my mind to accept the new Khan, but that is surely not a problem for most viewers. J.J. Abrams still has a tendency to create overly bombastic endings but this one was saved by the fight between Spock and Khan. Nods to old Trek, like a tribble and Mudd's confiscated spaceship, definitely worked for me. I have hopes that the next one will be even better (even though I'm giving this one a five star). Just please, no time travel! I understand the need to make the series reboot plausible in the first new Trek,  but time travel is excruciatingly hard to do well (in my opinion it killed the Star Trek Enterprise TV series).

I couldn't stand the first film (and still can't), but this sequel is AMAZING.  Very well done, great storyline with edge-of-your-seat action, and great acting.*SPOILERS AHEAD!*Now to get to the nitty gritty stuff:1)  The storyline:  KHAN.  I found it really funny how this is the second movie of the new Trek cast, and Khan just happened to be introduced here (just like the second movie of the original cast).  How they revealed the ""Federation agent"" to be Khan was pretty well done.  In this film, you have Spock screaming ""KHANNN!!!!"" instead of Kirk (which was rather blahh in my opinion), and you have Kirk (instead of Spock) being trapped in the radiation chamber.  What would have been great is if Kirk actually died in this film, but alas, he doesn't.2) I felt that introducing the Klingons in this film was a wasted plot effort.  They really served no purpose here, and they looked AWFUL.  You can see the computer generated effects with the so-called makeup, and they look more reptilian than anything else (with parallels to the Cardassians).  Not a fan at all with how the new Klingons look.3)  Capt. Christopher's Pike death.  Too bad they killed him off.  I wish they would have paralleled the Chris Pike character from the original series by showing how he came to be in a motorized wheelchair.Other than the above points, I really enjoyed the film, and I'll definitely watch it again and again.  As much as I initially hated J.J. Abrams' re-imagining of the franchise, it's not bad when you view it in a certain way.  You can't see these movies as a complete destruction of the Trek canon or a cheap rip off.  You need to see them as an alternative history/timeline sort of thing.

Reed,"[2, 5]","FAIR WARNING: This review contains some MAJOR spoilers so if you haven't seen the movie, read with caution!Reading through the reviews posted for Star Trek Into Darkness, they appear to fall into two camps: one (by far the largest) unadulterated love for the movie, the other (notably smaller) unadulterated hatred for the same movie.Question is, where does the truth lie? Is it ""the movie of the year"" or ""absolute cr@p""?It's complicated.My wife thought it was terrific, but then again she thinks Chris Pine is hot and that was the major reason for seeing the movie (as with the original reboot in 2009). She thought the story made sense, the effects were awesome, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Her biggest quibble was that it appeared there was something weird with Chris Pine's lower lip, like he'd had collagen injections.If you're a long-time Trekkie (like me), it's a mix of love and hate. On the one hand, the effects are awesome. If you're a fan more of TOS than TNG, then you probably liked the 2009 reboot (as I did) because although different it does recapture the sense of fun and adventure that TOS had. And Into Darkness effectively continues what was started in the 2009 reboot. It's fun, its got a good, rousing adventure and it is spectacular to look at.But there are quibbles. First, why Khan? It could have been a completely new villain and the story been just as good. That's a minor quibble though compared to the bigger quibble. And that's the reversal of the death seen from Wrath of Khan (Kirk dies instead of Spock) and Zachary Quinto (as Spock) trying to outdo Shatner's ""Khan"" yell (also from Wrath of Khan). Couldn't they have come up with a different way rather than shameless stealing? So to me it ruined what otherwise was a rollicking fun ride.I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, because I am torn. For the most part, it was just as much fun as the 2009 reboot and I did enjoy it. But the theft of key scenes from Wrath of Khan (still, by far, the superior movie) forces me to lower it to 4 stars. Is it the movie of the year? No, in my opinion it is so far a tie between Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel. Into Darkness is a distant third. It's light years better than Hansel and Gretel (glad I waited to see that on a flight to Europe and even gladder that there were other movies I could watch when I quickly realized what drek that was) or A Good Day to Die Hard (wish I'd waited for the flight to see that!).",4,"A more nuanced view on ""Into Darkness""",1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,2436,"['FAIR', 'WARNING', 'review', 'MAJOR', 'spoilers', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'read', 'caution', 'Reading', 'reviews', 'posted', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'appear', 'fall', 'two', 'camps', 'one', 'far', 'largest', 'unadulterated', 'love', 'movie', 'other', 'notably', 'smaller', 'unadulterated', 'hatred', 'same', 'movie.Question', 'where', 'truth', 'lie', 'movie', 'year', 'absolute', 'cr', '@', 'p', 'complicated.My', 'wife', 'thought', 'was', 'terrific', 'then', 'again', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'hot', 'was', 'major', 'reason', 'seeing', 'movie', 'original', 'reboot', '2009', 'thought', 'story', 'made', 'sense', 'effects', 'were', 'awesome', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'biggest', 'quibble', 'was', 'appeared', 'was', 'something', 'weird', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'lower', 'lip', ""'d"", 'had', 'collagen', 'injections.If', ""'re"", 'long-time', 'Trekkie', 'mix', 'love', 'hate', 'one', 'hand', 'effects', 'are', 'awesome', ""'re"", 'fan', 'more', 'TOS', 'TNG', 'then', 'probably', 'liked', '2009', 'reboot', 'did', 'different', 'recapture', 'sense', 'fun', 'adventure', 'TOS', 'had', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'effectively', 'what', 'was', 'started', '2009', 'reboot', 'fun', 'got', 'good', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'spectacular', 'look', 'are', 'quibbles', 'First', 'why', 'Khan', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'new', 'villain', 'story', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'minor', 'quibble', 'compared', 'bigger', 'quibble', 'reversal', 'death', 'seen', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'Kirk', 'instead', 'Spock', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Spock', 'trying', 'outdo', 'Shatner', 'Khan', 'yell', 'also', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'up', 'different', 'way', 'rather', 'shameless', 'stealing', 'So', 'ruined', 'what', 'otherwise', 'was', 'rollicking', 'fun', 'ride.I', ""'d"", 'give', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'could', 'am', 'torn', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', '2009', 'reboot', 'did', 'enjoy', 'theft', 'key', 'scenes', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'still', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'lower', '4', 'stars', 'movie', 'year', 'No', 'opinion', 'so', 'far', 'tie', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'distant', 'third', 'light', 'years', 'better', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'glad', 'waited', 'see', 'flight', 'Europe', 'even', 'gladder', 'were', 'other', 'movies', 'could', 'watch', 'when', 'quickly', 'realized', 'what', 'drek', 'was', 'Good', 'Day', 'Die', 'Hard', 'wish', ""'d"", 'waited', 'flight', 'see']",Star Trek Into Darkness

If all you're looking for is eye candy, then you'll enjoy this film.  If you have only seen the 2009 movie, and no other Trek media, you will enjoy the movie.  However, if you are a Trekkie (or Trekker) you will be disappointed and possibly upset by how Abrams further butchers Trek lore.The set up of the film is the Enterprise hiding under water while Spock goes into an active volcano.  There is then a big scene where Kirk has to violate the Prime Directive to save Spock by revealing the ship to the natives. WHY the Enterprise would submerge under water makes no sense.  They would be safe in orbit and could easily beam Spock out, yet JJ Abrams (who is doing his thing and to heck with the lore), creates this absurd situation just so Kirk can get demoted (briefly) later in the film.  You could delete this entire scene and it would not affect the story at all.Plus Kirk is further portrayed as a reckless, rule-breaking, bad boy contradictory to the character we've seen since the Original Series.  I cannot fault Chris Pine as he does a good job given the script.  However, before this film the number of times Kirk broke the rules could be counted on one hand.  Here, JJ Abrams has a Kirk that makes one wonder why Starfleet would have him in the first place let alone captain of the Enterprise.The rest of the movie is basically Star Trek II, with some tweaks.  JJ Abrams continuing his trend of his films taking cues from other movies.  The ending is actually a blantant copy of the ending to Star Trek II.Overall the individual actors play their parts well with Benedict Cumberbatch pretty much stealing every scene he's in.  This movie is forgettable, some will watch it for the CG then forget about it later, others will watch it for a specific actor (Cumberbatch or Pine) and that's about it.

1588073,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B009934S5M,drqshadow,"[1, 2]","A skillful space-faring overdose of adrenaline, if not really my idea of a Star Trek film. Into Darkness has the makings of a curvy, complicated red tape thriller, but its predictability, superficiality and outright refusal to go more than five minutes between jump-cut-loaded action scenes halts the germination of that seed relatively early. With the exception of big-bad Benedict Cumberbatch, who manages to be both admirable and despicable in even doses, the film is thoroughly overacted and the touches of fan service that I so relished in the 2009 reboot seem far more forced and unnecessary the second time around. There's also a notable lack of gravitas to the proceedings, in my opinion one of the hallmarks of the series, with an unfamiliar trigger-happy temperament lending the impression of an adult who's regressed into a period of renewed adolescence.

1588078,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B009934S5M,D. S. Thurlow,"[29, 43]","""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" manages to be several entertaining movies at once.  It is first a very exciting action movie with lots of excellent special effects that should hold the viewer's interest from start to finish.  Second, it is a well-done prequel to the earlier Star Trek movies and even the television series.  We get to meet the crew of the Starship Enterprise before that five year mission of exploration.  The actors who portray the main characters at a younger age should be instantly recognizable to generations of Star Trek fans.  Third, the movie is a fairly clever remix of familiar story elements that pays homage but is not a slavish imitation of those earlier stories.  The movie succeeds particularly well in exploring the interactions of the main characters, and in rebooting the most famous villain of the Star Trek series.The movie begins with an extended action sequence on a distant world, where Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) has once again exceeded his guidance and put his crew and ship at risk.  Kirk gets out of it by violating rules and directives, and finds himself demoted, and separated from Spock (Zachary Quinto), when he returns to Earth.  The actions of a vengeful Starfleet officer named John Harrison (a superb Benedict Cumberbatch) create a new crisis seemingly tailor-made for Kirk's talents.  He is restored to command and sent after the bad guy, who is hiding out on the edge of the Klingon part of the galaxy.Harrison turns out to have a surprising agenda and equally surprising enemies; he and Kirk must be uncertain allies for a time.  But the audience knows there will eventually be a confrontation, one so serious that Kirk, Spock, and the crew of Enterprise will be tested to their limits.

1588087,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B009934S5M,E. David Swan,"[3, 5]","I really enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek when it first came out in theaters but repeated viewings have not improved my feelings. Visually it is stunning and I have no issues with the casting or acting but the plot is a mess and Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is way off the mark. I don't blame Pine because that's the way he's written. Into Darkness corrects a lot of the things that bothered me about the first movie and the plot is tighter. Another problem I had with the 2009 movie was that it had absolutely no message and really didn't honor Gene Roddenberry's legacy. Into Darkness does have a message and it's a good one but the film doesn't bludgeon the viewer with the message.My top three favorite Star Trek movies are Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country. Into Darkness doesn't break into my top three but it is one of the better Star Trek film despite the feelings of many Star Trek fans. I prefer the more intimate early films but for those who prefer a huge budget action packed thrill ride Into Darkness delivers. Let me give a special nod to the design of the U.S.S. Vengeance which, if you haven't seen it yet, is perhaps the most awesome ship Star Trek has ever produced and that includes the Romulan Narada from the previous film that blew may away in 2009.Into Darkness actually reminds me a lot of Skyfall if you can believe it. From a technical standpoint both films may be at the pinnacle of their respective series. The casting, the special effects, the set designs and the big moments are thrilling. When the Enterprise rises from an alien ocean it is positively awe inspiring. And then my inner Star Trek nerd pinches me and says, `wait, why was the Enterprise underwater?' Just like with Skyfall it's much better if you don't think too hard about the plot. The plot is much better than the complete nonsense of the previous film but a coherent plot never seems to be the goal of J.J. Abrams so fans can either accept it or do as some Star Trek fans did and declare Into Darkness the works Star Trek film ever.  The new series is just a whole new animal from the previous films.  Comparing Wrath of Khan to Into Darkness is like comparing Skyfall to Goldfinger. They are so different as to be incomparable. You can either accept the changes or cling to the classics but I think that to say this film is terrible on its own merits is just wrong.One of the biggest complaints was near the end when Into Darkness essentially remade one of the most famous scenes from one of the earliest movies and I won't deny that it made me cringe. I would call the whole scene ill advised rather than a ruination of the movie as some online reviews have suggested. I'm also not thrilled with the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch. Not that he isn't an astounding revelation as an actor and a great addition to Star Trek but the character he plays just doesn't fit.  I can sympathize with many of the criticisms of the film but in the end, like Skyfall, the enjoyment of the experience outweighed the demerits of my own personal criticisms and a repeated viewing only reinforced my appreciation of the movie.",5,Perhaps the Most Visually Stunning Star Trek Yet,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,3143,"['really', 'enjoyed', '2009', 'Star', 'Trek', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'have', 'not', 'improved', 'feelings', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'have', 'issues', 'casting', 'acting', 'plot', 'mess', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'interpretation', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'way', 'mark', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Pine', 'way', 'written', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'lot', 'things', 'bothered', 'first', 'movie', 'plot', 'tighter', 'problem', 'had', '2009', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'absolutely', 'message', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'honor', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'legacy', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'have', 'message', 'good', 'one', 'film', ""n't"", 'bludgeon', 'viewer', 'message.My', 'top', 'three', 'favorite', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'are', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'Search', 'Spock', 'Undiscovered', 'Country', 'Into', 'Darkness', ""n't"", 'break', 'top', 'three', 'one', 'better', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'feelings', 'many', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'prefer', 'more', 'intimate', 'early', 'films', 'who', 'prefer', 'huge', 'budget', 'action', 'packed', 'thrill', 'ride', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'delivers', 'Let', 'give', 'special', 'nod', 'design', 'U.S.S', 'Vengeance', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'perhaps', 'most', 'awesome', 'ship', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ever', 'produced', 'Romulan', 'Narada', 'previous', 'film', 'blew', 'may', 'away', '2009.Into', 'Darkness', 'actually', 'lot', 'Skyfall', 'can', 'believe', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'pinnacle', 'respective', 'series', 'casting', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'designs', 'big', 'moments', 'are', 'thrilling', 'When', 'Enterprise', 'alien', 'ocean', 'positively', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'then', 'inner', 'Star', 'Trek', 'nerd', 'pinches', 'wait', 'why', 'was', 'Enterprise', 'underwater', 'Just', 'Skyfall', 'much', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'plot', 'plot', 'much', 'better', 'complete', 'nonsense', 'previous', 'film', 'coherent', 'plot', 'never', 'be', 'goal', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'fans', 'can', 'either', 'accept', 'do', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'did', 'declare', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'works', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'ever', 'new', 'series', 'just', 'whole', 'new', 'animal', 'previous', 'films', 'Comparing', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'comparing', 'Skyfall', 'Goldfinger', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'be', 'incomparable', 'can', 'either', 'accept', 'changes', 'cling', 'classics', 'think', 'say', 'film', 'terrible', 'own', 'merits', 'just', 'wrong.One', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'essentially', 'remade', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'scenes', 'one', 'earliest', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'made', 'cringe', 'would', 'call', 'whole', 'scene', 'ill', 'advised', 'rather', 'ruination', 'movie', 'online', 'reviews', 'have', 'suggested', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'thrilled', 'casting', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Not', ""n't"", 'astounding', 'revelation', 'actor', 'great', 'addition', 'Star', 'Trek', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'can', 'sympathize', 'many', 'criticisms', 'film', 'end', 'Skyfall', 'enjoyment', 'experience', 'outweighed', 'demerits', 'own', 'personal', 'criticisms', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'only', 'reinforced', 'appreciation', 'movie']",Star Trek Into Darkness

While my wife and I are original and dedicated Trekkies (and yes, we love that name) I found essentially little to really love about this film. Noonien Soong Khan, a/k/a John Harrison (an unusually buff Benedict Cumberbatch), shows up to cause havoc at Starfleet. Guess who gets picked to go after him?That pretty much sums up this film. While I found it technically a bit shameful (some of the CGI was looking like a SyFy Channel reject) it was OK. My wife certainly went bonkers for it and enjoyed it ~ so might you, if you are as bonkers as my wife. Personally, I'm glad I can say I watched it. It won't thrill my imagination for days to come. The original series fuels my mind to this day.Abrams directs here with a lighter hand ~ meaning not so much stupid glare and blue-light flashing specials ~ but he also seems absent. It is interesting that about 75% of this film looks exactly like any other goofy sci-fi adventure in space except this has the Enterprise. Abrams, I find, simply abuses that venerable presence but puts no soul in it. I guess he's busy with the new Star Wars release he's directing.Everyone hands in capable performances, though the music as well as some of the lines are pure cheese. They did this to pay homage to (or to highjack from) the original series. There is a scene which sort of made me laugh that is pulled right fromStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. That is something I did not appreciate. I saw what they were trying to do, but it still fell flat with me.Either you love this, you hate it or you remain neutral and unmoved, like me. I can do without Benedict Cumberbatch for the rest of my life ... and Carl Urban simply did not have enough ""Bones"" in this movie so I couldn't even enjoy his usual homages to Deforest Kelley.

Abrams production team even admits they did not get the Star Trek philosophy and it shows.  This one has a few inconsistencies with the Star Trek Universe story line.  To me it seems like they are &#34;chasing the Hollywood shiny thing&#34; trying to get a block buster, and it just so happens to look like Star Trek, as opposed to a true Star Trek production.  There is another Roku title that expresses this sentiment called &#34;Trek Nation&#34; which by Rod Roddenberry (Gene Roddenburry's son).  Rod Roddenberry states that most of his life he did not &#34;get&#34; what Star Trek was all about and this documentary was about his quest to find out.  Like some other producers that do great original stuff but flub a remake (e.g. Tim Burton), Abrams does better with his own stuff like Fringe.  I cringe when these producers try to tackle someone else's production (especially when it's a classic) like Tim Burton did with Planet of the Apes and J. J. Abrams did with Star Trek.Believability is another aspect of capturing your audience: One thing I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND ABOUT HOLLYWOOD is when there is a spectacular and highly unbelievable sequence like Spock in the volcano.  I don't care what kind of technology they have, surviving that fall and the heat of the volcano was just not believable to the point of being dumb, loosing my interest and faith in the process.  Star Wars did this as well when they had the light saber fight above the volcano lava... and not a singed hair?  No breathing problems?  Nothing???  I think you can put together a spectacular scene and have it believable and that the believability is a plus. Incorporating the real life physics would even make it more interesting and dramatic but instead Hollywood always takes the cheap shot and chases the shiny thing, missing the opportunity's to create noteworthy classics.Hollywood... here's $12... go out any buy yourself some integrity!",3,"Okay, but not true Star Trek",1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,2060,"['love', 'Sci-Fi', 'would', 'watch', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'last', 'Star', 'Trek', 'be', '34', 'true', '34', 'Star', 'trek', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'production', 'team', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Star', 'Trek', 'philosophy', 'one', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Universe', 'story', 'line', 'are', '34', 'chasing', 'Hollywood', 'shiny', 'thing', '34', 'trying', 'get', 'block', 'buster', 'just', 'so', 'look', 'Star', 'Trek', 'opposed', 'true', 'Star', 'Trek', 'production', 'Roku', 'title', 'sentiment', 'called', '34', 'Trek', 'Nation', '34', 'Rod', 'Roddenberry', 'Gene', 'Roddenburry', 'son', 'Rod', 'Roddenberry', 'most', 'life', 'did', 'not', '34', 'get', '34', 'what', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'about', 'documentary', 'was', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'producers', 'do', 'great', 'original', 'stuff', 'remake', 'e.g', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Abrams', 'better', 'own', 'stuff', 'Fringe', 'cringe', 'when', 'producers', 'try', 'tackle', 'someone', 'else', 'production', 'especially', 'when', 'classic', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'did', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'did', 'Star', 'Trek.Believability', 'aspect', 'capturing', 'audience', 'One', 'thing', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'STAND', 'ABOUT', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'when', 'spectacular', 'highly', 'unbelievable', 'sequence', 'Spock', 'volcano', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'kind', 'technology', 'have', 'surviving', 'fall', 'heat', 'volcano', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'point', 'being', 'dumb', 'loosing', 'interest', 'faith', 'process', 'Star', 'Wars', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'had', 'light', 'saber', 'fight', 'volcano', 'lava', 'not', 'singed', 'hair', 'No', 'breathing', 'problems', 'Nothing', 'think', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'spectacular', 'scene', 'have', 'believable', 'believability', 'plus', 'Incorporating', 'real', 'life', 'physics', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'instead', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'cheap', 'shot', 'shiny', 'thing', 'missing', 'opportunity', 'create', 'noteworthy', 'classics.Hollywood', 'here', '12', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'integrity']",Star Trek Into Darkness
1588118,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B009934S5M,Enjolras,"[133, 188]","UPDATE (9/15/13): As others have noted, this version of the blu-ray does NOT contain all of the special features. In a move of sheer inanity, Paramount has distributed the special features to different retailers. Do your homework to find out which features you'll get from which vendor. I took off an additional star in protest of this sleazy marketing practice.***I might be the only person on Earth who liked this movie more than I liked Abrams' Star Trek 2009. Unfortunately, that's partly because I disliked the 2009 Star Trek. But Into Darkness does have stunning visuals, some fun moments, and a much more compelling villain. It seems overall that viewers who don't know much about Star Trek seem to enjoy this movie and Abrams' larger take on Trek, whereas many viewers who do know Trek despise this movie. I'm more of the latter category (I've watched Trek since 1994), and while I don't *hate* Abrams' versions there are serious problems. Here are my thoughts.SPOILER WARNING: I've included spoilers in my review. I found out about some key moments in the film before having seen it. I think in retrospect it was a good thing. There are some moments in the movie that can be maddening for Trek fans and having them spoiled actually allowed me to get my frustration out of my system before seeing the movie. I think I enjoyed the movie more having been spoiled. IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON""T READ THIS REVIEW.THE STORYI love the beginning of this movie. Basically, Kirk violates the Prime Directive to save Spock. However, Spock reports him and Kirk gets demoted. The story connects to classic Trek and it gives the characters more emotional weight.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really continue with this intro. The rest of the movie follows rogue Starfleet officer John Harrison, who engages in several acts of terrorism against Starfleet. This part of the movie becomes a bit convoluted. Basically, the entire plot is an attempt by Starfleet Admiral Marcus to frighten Starfleet and to start a war with the Klingons, but what a convoluted way of going about it. When Harrison flees to the Klingon homeworld, Marcus sends the Enterprise to Kronos (yes, it's misspelt in the movie) to kill him. This part of the movie is fun, but a bit short on logic. Apparently, nobody thought to make diplomatic overtures to the Klingons to request that they return Harrison. Given that Harrison seems not to get along with the Klingons, it's hard to imagine they'd keep him.I wish the movie had explored the consequences of Kirk's violating the Prime Directive and show Kirk actually struggle to get his command back. However, he's back in the captain's chair within a few minutes. This is fine. It gives the initial scenes a bit less emotional weight, but the second third of the movie is still fun. Where the movie really weakens though is the final third. It basically becomes a rehash of The Wrath of Khan. Things happen way too quickly, without any space to breath and let the emotional impact of events sink in.There are a bunch of stupid plot twists that drove me nuts. Why on Earth was the Enterprise underwater in the beginning of the movie? I'm sure it was because Abrams thought it would look cool, but it makes no sense. Why would Admiral Marcus tell Kirk to fire torpedoes with Khans crew at Kronos? Why not just regular torpedoes? Sure, you could come up with contrived explanations, but like the 2009 movie this movie stretches logic.THE VILLAINGiven that I claim the final third of the movie borrows heavily from The Wrath of Khan, it's worth mentioning that John Harrison is Khan. Yes, despite all denials to the contrary, he is Khan. This is both good and bad. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the few actors who can bring enough menace and charisma to the character to make a believable Khan. However, in this movie Khan's motives are pretty mundane. He just wants to get his 72 crew members back. Khan here has no ambitions to rule the galaxy, no epic quest for revenge. In fact, in one scene, Khan actually tears up when talking about his crew.In short, while there was potential, Khan in this movie just never rises to the level of epic villain. The only reason anybody would care about Khan is because of the legacy of The Wrath of Khan. For much of the movie, Abrams could have substituted almost any other name for John Harrison without changing the villain's role. In fact, by making the villain Khan, I think it forced viewers who had seen Star Trek II to drew too many comparisons with Khan from that movie. It might have been better to just have had a fresh villain, perhaps a human or alien terrorist.THE CHARACTERSAs with the 2009 Star Trek, I'm impressed with how well the new batch of actors mimic their counterparts from the Original Series. That said, Into Darkness is even less about the ensemble and more about the Kirk and Spock bromance. There are two problems here. First, one of the key relationship dynamics in the Original Series was the three-way dialogue between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock represented logic, McCoy represented emotion, and Kirk was the balance. However, in the Abrams movies McCoy has been relegated to a background character and to compensate has taken Kirk to an emotional extreme. I think there's a real opportunity missed for a band of brothers relationship between the three men.Second, Spock is just too emotional. I don't mean that Vulcans never have emotions. However, in the Abrams movies, especially Into Darkness, Spock's default is emotional. This becomes particularly bad near the end, when Spock becomes enraged, yells ""KHAAAAAN!"", and goes off to chase Khan. The problem is that we never see Zachary Quinto's Spock as the cool, collected, logical Vulcan we see from the TV series and original movies. It's fine to show Spock's emotional side sometimes, but making him too emotional minimizes those moments.CINEMATOGRAPHYThis is really where the movie shines. Abrams really knows how to paint a pretty picture. The intro sequence with the red planet and the white aliens with yellow robes was wonderful. The battle scenes are intense and when the Enterprise takes damage it really appears pretty damaged. Despite my other complaints, I do wish other Star Trek movies looked this good.That said, the movie just doesn't slow down. There's no room for viewers to breath and absorb the emotional impact of events. Nicholas Meyer, director of Star Trek II & VI, says it's important to make some scenes special and some scenes mundane. However, in Abrams' movies, all of the scenes are so bold and busy that viewers really don't get a sense of which, if any scenes, are special (perhaps except radiation chamber scene). It's like a roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs but to straightaways.THE ENDINGAs I said above the final third of the movie was the biggest disappointment. There's a situation where Spock grieves for Kirk. It's pretty much a direct rip on Wrath of Khan. I'm fine with a subtle homage. But what really frustrated me was that the end sequence is just a big fistfight between Khan and Spock. The scene lacks any tension and moreover takes place on a moving transport shuttle on Earth in broad daylight. While I think Abrams usually gets the visuals right, here the visuals were not only silly but also didn't provide a climax for the final battle. There was no battle of wits, just a pedestrian brawl.One reviewer (I think the Transporter Room 3 podcast) said it best: at this point, the characters haven't earned this ending. We've only had one movie before this one with Kirk and Spock. It's not clear how that emotional became so deep. It just doesn't work when viewers know that Kirk will be resurrected. I think the ending could have been just as effective if Uhura had died, and made more sense.THE VERDICTOverall I give Into Darkness 3.5 stars. It's better than the 2009 Star Trek in my opinion, but Abrams still doesn't seem to understand Star Trek. This is all popcorn movie with little intellectual or emotional heft. More importantly, Abrams seems a bit too willing to make large leaps in logic and to fall back on action sequences rather than develop the plot. I'd still recommend seeing it. Despite my complaints, I did enjoy the movie and I'll buy the blu-ray. It just lacks the thoughtfulness of Star Treks II and VI, and that's a shame. If Abrams does make another sequel, I'd recommend he watch Star Trek II and VI, but not just to copy the plot twists, but also the thoughtfulness in those films.",2,"strong visuals, spotty

The only reasons why it was popular and liked by most people are:1. It's new (i.e. following the first &#34;Star Trek&#34; story)2. It has &#34;Into Darkness&#34; in the title (ooooh, so scary-sarcasm, trust me, this movie was for children)Use your brains, people. Just because it's a sequel doesn't automatically make it the best of the series. For example, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight rises were both awful sequels with predictable stories and pathetic action. The same goes for skyfall and iron man 3. Both were pathetic sequels. What are some worthy sequels that aren't pathetic then, you ask? Here's a short list:1. Back to the Future II and III2. Mission Impossible II and III3. Spider-Man 24. X-Men 2&#34;Star Trek: into darkness&#34; was plain stupid on all levels. Here's why: The story was similar to the first &#34;Star Trek&#34; (meaning there was no creativity and effort by the writers to entertain and pique the interest of viewers), the main villain (Khan) was not menacing and evil (people's grandmother's are more evil than Khan was), the story lacked the suspense and action that the first &#34;Star Trek&#34; has, and it seems J.J.

It is impossible to watch this film and not make comparisons to the Wrath of Khan. That film ended in arguably the single most emotional moment in the history of Star Trek. And the actors were up to the task. Shatner and Nimoy were exceptional. Here, we get a scene that lacks that emotional punch and part of the problem is because the Kirk/Spock relationship doesn't have the history here that it did in the original series. I never really bought that Spock would, or should, feel such anger over someone he has not known that long.Khan? A nice and interesting choice but doomed because Montalban is perhaps the best villain Star Trek ever produced. Any actor will suffer by comparison and maybe that is why another story would have worked better.The rest of the cast is good, although I think Urban is underused as McCoy. He again manages to capture the elements of DeForest Kelley and still seem original. That's no easy task.The film looks gorgeous, the effects are impressive, the score is fine.Something that really bothers me, though, is the almost complete lack of military decorum. I mean they are the military. But most of the time they act like buddies hanging out. The original series was much more disciplined and, I think, realistic. Making someone CO of a starship straight out of the academy? I still laugh at that. Is Starfleet THAT desperate? I don't care how brilliant a person is, you cannot beat experience. Even Einstein had to work.Maybe it is unfair to compare it to the original because by the time Wrath of Khan was released, they had over 70 episodes played over and over again throughout the country to build a relationship the viewers could connect with for well over ten years. This new cast has just two films. Maybe it would be better to watch this without having seen the original? Maybe so.I still prefer the original, although I have to say I like this Trek much more than the other Trek series.

I really love the look to this updated Star Trek universe (just as in the 1st movie) and I like that all the main characters truly do maintain consistency with the original ones (only Kirk being a bit more free spirited and reckless). The opening ""Bond like"" sequence was interesting and beautifully portrayed on screen. The initial set up to the plot conflict was intelligent and well paced out with several action spots. Like some other reviewers have mentioned however, the ending slipped a bit because it became so typical of many action films.

1588150,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B009934S5M,FNDNreview,"[6, 11]","It's an absolutely great time to be a Star Trek fan - and who could have imagined anyone would ever be saying that again?  Much like Star Wars, Star Trek has always had an adoring and devoted legion of fans that will line up around the block for a seat to watch the newest space adventure regardless of who's starring in it, who's directing it, etc.  However, it's not just Trekkies that are standing in line anymore.  Since J.J. Abrams took over the director's chair in 2009, he's returned the struggling franchise to prominence, possibly making it more popular than ever before.  With the successful reimagining of these classic characters, devoted fans and new fans alike have been filled with anticipation for the sequel - but Star Trek sequels haven't always met expectations.  In fact, half of Star Trek's (original series and Next Generation) sequels have been downright deplorable.  So, does J.J. Abrams have what it takes to make a successful Star Trek sequel?Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) return in the explosive sequel, Star Trek: Into Darkness, on a manhunt to capture former Starfleet Commander, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  After terrorizing London and murdering a group of Starfleet officers, Harrison flees to Qo'noS, the Klingon home world.  Kirk instantly volunteers the Enterprise and its crew to do whatever is necessarily to bring the terrorist to judgment.  Karl Urban, John Cho, Zoe Saldana, Alive Eve, Anton Yelchin, and Simon Pegg also star in supporting roles.No Spoilers...Yet.As far as the entertainment value goes, there really isn't anything not to like about Star Trek: Into Darkness.  The film begins with action-packed drama (much like the first film), and really never slows down until the credits roll.  It's filled with plenty of twists and turns, along with several appearances by characters that will be familiar to fans of the original series.  From the film's synopsis alone, obviously the Klingons play a part in the storyline, yet it's only a very brief introduction as the inner turmoil in Starfleet is the main focus of the film - along with the introduction to film's partial antagonist, John Harrison.  The lines between the good and evil is easily visible in the film, but the main problem throughout the film is the feeling of nostalgia - as if you've already seen this film once before.  Into Darkness does serve as a parallel to the original Star Trek film series, yet this sequel still feels a bit recycled when comparing it to the 2009 film.  The good news is this is about the closest thing to a complaint that you'll find about this movie.It's nearly impossible to go into detail about the plot points of this film without spoiling something for someone, so from here on out - you've been warned.Spoilers start HERE.The majority of the hype surrounding Into Darkness was in regards to the villain, John Harrison.  Since these new Star Trek films are still a part of the official continuity (now an alternate reality), you'd think Star Trek fans would have some kind of knowledge about this character - yet there was nothing to be found.  Of course, this prompted the speculation about the possibility that this John Harrison character could really be Khan Noonien Singh.  If you were one of those people that made this call early on, you were right.  John Morrison is indeed that same villain that was such a massive thorn in William Shatner's side in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  And, since the timeline has been altered, a new storyline was constructed in order for the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise to cross paths with Khan and his followers.Unlike the easily noticeable charm of Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n, there's not much to like about Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of the character.  Into Darkness' version of Khan clearly cares about his fellow augmented brothers and sisters, but he has no reason to hold a grudge against Captain Kirk like he did in The Wrath of Khan, which takes a great deal of emotion out of this new sequel.  The majority of the enjoyment that came from The Wrath of Khan was due largely to the revenge Khan felt compelled to inflict on Kirk, but when you remove that particular emotion from the equation, it needs to be replaced with something else entirely - hence the introduction to Admiral Alexander Marcus as a second antagonist.  Sadly, Marcus' desire to take the Federation into an unavoidable war, long before the Federation is prepared isn't really a visible motive to build an entire film around.  It leads to more action, but isn't necessarily the best road taken, even though it was necessary if the third film is potentially going to focus on the Klingon war (assuming Mr. Abrams isn't too busy with Star Wars).Like its predecessor, Into Darkness is largely focused on Kirk and Spock.  With another film comes more chemistry building, meaning if these films continue on with their current flow, it's very possible this duo could become legends in their own right.  However, the advantages of making a television show instead of a feature film is the ability to give the supporting cast more time to shine.  The original series gave each of the supporting members the chance to further the depth of their characters, while the cast of the new films are basically reduced to offering their own set of one-liners - most of which are used for comedy.  This was also the case if you look back on the Next Generation films, which focused largely on Captain Picard, and Data, while the rest of the crew was basically along for the ride.  Of course, they already had 7 seasons of television under their belts, so it was a huge deal - but this is where the future of the Star Trek franchise comes into question.  Without character development, it will be difficult to sustain momentum past the next sequel.To this point, Star Trek: Into Darkness is the best summer blockbuster of 2013.  This action-packed sequel pays homage to the original series, while still continuing to draw new fans to the franchise.  However, it's difficult to justify a claim that this sequel is superior to the first film, since they are nearly mirror images of one another.  Both focus on the same cast members, both feature similar villains, and both end in essentially the same exact way.  With each passing sequel comes more questions about where the next one will take us - but until then, feel free to beam aboard the Star Trek bandwagon and embrace the outer space chaos.Overall Grade - BFNDNreview.com",4,J.J.

1588155,A1TPFCXHCGKTY6,B009934S5M,Frank L. Urbano,"[12, 19]","I am just back from the theater watching 'Star Trek Into Darkness' and I think that one word describes this movie - amazing.  I have seen many negative reviews, saying this movie was cliched, had too many special effects, and was too much of a knockoff on earlier plots.  To all of those who have seen this movie and didn't think it was wonderful I can say only one thing - you are not a true Star Trek fan.  I have been watching the show for close to 40 years and found this movie to be among the best of all the movies ever done in this series.First of all, let's get some things out there.  The special effects were excellent.  The sound quality and music was phenomenal.  While I was concerned that there might be too much action in this movie, in reality I felt it fit very nicely into the plot and didn't overwhelm the movie.The acting was great.  The characters who played the classic character parts from the 2009 movie all were stellar in their roles in this movie.  Some highlights included:- a welcome expansion of Uhura's role in this movie (when you see her you will be happy she is on our side!!)- the continued crotchetiness of McCoy, including one of his ""I'm a doctor, not a...."" comments- another very humorous rendition of Scotty, including several classic commentsBenedict Cumberbatch was chilling as John Harrison (Khan), although I'm not sure he 'looked' the part of Khan,  given the incredible job that Ricardo Montalban did with this character in both the original ""Space Seed"" and in ""Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan"".  There were many other excellent performances, including the actors who played Admiral Pike, Admiral Marcus and Dr. Carol Marcus.Now to the plot.  It was an ingenious reboot of the entire Khan space opera.  It took elements of the original episode and the movie and incorporated them into a new take on one of the best story concepts in the entire Star Trek franchise.  It also reminded one of the episodes from Star Trek : Enterprise where the Augments were first described.  The plot was very reminiscent of many things, including the entire Khan story, the notion of a senior Starfleet officer going bad (like ""The Pegasus"" in TNG), and the cinematic extravaganza that occurs near the end when Kirk sacrifices his own life to save the crew.  I think it is very interesting how in this reboot Kirk dies and Spock lives, while in TWOK, it was the other way around.  I enjoyed JJ Abrams' approach in solving this problem, so more movies could come forth from this one.Most importantly, this movie did everything that a great Star Trek movie should do - it involved a great storyline, good character development, and a fully satisfying villain who the crew had to defeat.  It also paid homage to many things about Star Trek which made it so great.  It was funny, scary, action-packed, and riveting.  Even though you knew in the end that the crew would prevail, it didn't stop you from gripping the edge of your seat as you waited for it to happen.  Put simply, it caused Star Trek to shine yet again and I fully believe that Gene Roddenberry is looking down smiling about this one.If you haven't seen the movie yet, please go see it and relax and enjoy it.  Don't overanalyze it or sit there and pick it apart.  Just watch the movie and be happy that there are people who love this franchise so much that they keep on making new movies.  I think that this movie will go down as among the best of the series.Finally, I sincerely hope that at the end when it seems like the 5-year mission was going to be launched, that this means there will be more of these movies to come.

Fine - that's what you expect from most action movies these days. And yes, I'm not a fan of a re-do of the beloved original crew (even though I think the selection for the guy who plays McCoy is pretty good.) I hate the Uhura-Spock relationship - it never happened in canon works, and it's just silly. Basically the new stuff is someone's idea of a remake of Star Trek. Just make a new movie series with new characters. Why are you screwing with a classic movie and sci-fi series? Because you can't think of anything new to do.I only have watched these new Star Treks for free through trial offers. I won't pay for them on my own and I feel honestly, after Voyager, the franchise was done for me. I hated Enterprise, and the two new movies just don't fit. The new creators wouldn't listen to what fans want, and instead tried to re-create the series for a younger audience.

1588174,AG8K92N37MT27,B009934S5M,Garnet,"[2, 3]","Just like the first new and re-booted Trek movie, I liked this one more than I expected to.  The acting was very good, the special effects were absolutely spectacular (even on the small screen), and the script was quite well done.  It made me wish I had gotten to see it on the big screen, but...oh well.  This way I can watch it again and again on my blu-ray.Just like the first movie, this one pays homage to original Trek, but without going overboard on it.  That can be quite the feat and, so far, they are managing it very well indeed.  The familiar relationships between the main characters are there, all the affection and teasing, even if they are being played by new actors and there are occasional twists that we never saw in original Trek...but were sometimes hinted at.  You never know when an old name (with a new face) will appear and it keeps you guessing--are they the same as what we've seen before, or will they turn out to have a very different role in things.  I really do enjoy the alternate universe they are exploring in this series.I am especially enjoying the new (old) McCoy and a very sassy and spitfire Uhura.  Hey, we always knew she had it in her!  Kirk is wild and footloose in his personal life and yet dedicated to his ship and his crew.  Once again, some things never change...for good reason.  Spock...well, some part of me will always see Leonard Nimoy, but the actor we see in this series is definitely growing on me.  I really like the new Scotty; we get to see much more of the humor in his character, even as he is still a genius with engines.The movie opens with Kirk having been demoted for one of the issues he was always getting into on old Trek--playing fast and loose with the Prime Directive.  I guess some things never change.  However, nothing keeps Jim down long...because soon Star Fleet needs him again once they are under attack by a brilliant and dangerous man who is out to destroy them.

I saw it the day it opened and again last week at the best Imax theater in Manhattan and I think it is terrific, even better than the first film.  The actors are all superb especially Pine, Quinto, Cumberbatch and Bruce Greenwood as Admiral Pike.  The film is loaded with action.  I remember thinking that it was a very long film, not because I was bored but because every time you think it is over, we get another terrific action sequence.  The 3D was also excellent, way better than Iron Man 3.  I look forward to getting it on blu-ray and I cannot truly state that I won't see it one more time in the movies.However I am so tired of the nit-pickers and complainers that I have run into about this film.  One person stated that there were no surprises.  Well yeah if you are the internet 20 hours a day reading every rumor and bit of information or downloading the film before it opened in the U.S., then I guess there wouldn't be any surprises.  I stayed away from all these rumors, as I usually do, and I found many surprises in this film.  One thing I didn't expect literally made me jump forward in my seat (no, not Khan.)  I've heard other complaints that this and that didn't make sense.  Hey guys wake up, its a movie and its a sci-fi movie.

He is honest, brave, and sensitive to others.The plot is great.  400 year old villain is revived, Khan the wolf, Sonn is brought back from cryogenic freeze to build advanced weapons designed to destroy the Klingon empire.  The admiral feels that ""War is inevitable"" and that he will be the general leading the war.  In an effort to destroy the crew of Bounty Bay, 72 pods armed with photon missiles is target at the Klingon homework.  The plot almost worked, but Kirk decides to bring Khan back to earth to face his crimes and answer for the death of Admiral Pike.Kirk saves Spock, Spock saves Kirk, McCoy saves Kirk, Spock kicks Khans butt.  The war with the Klingons does not happen.  Spock fight scenes are fantastic: the vulcan nerve pinch, the vulcan death touch, and the rage within. Vulcans are war like race that control their combat tendencies.  Spock demonstrates a high degree of courage and resourcefulness.  Khan skull crushing technique is very ruthless.  Khan is a superior being, psychopathic killer, with desires to conquer.  Kirk is set to fall in love with Dr. Marcus.The cast was great:  Scottie was resourceful and the trans warp technology remains innovative.  Chekov continues to be impressive at the helm and in engineering.  The Warp core looks like a fusion reactor or collider, a nice twist between sci fi and real world technology.The sci fi special efforts were great.  I loved the cgi city, the colors and backgrounds, and the music.What do we learn about the federation?  We learn the federation is war like and the top brass is invest in technology that will defeat the Klingons or any enemy.  The federation is powerful and armed with a weapon that can destroy ships in warp, a predator ship.  We learn the federation moon of Praxis has been destroyed.  The Klingons are tribal and in survival status.  However, there was no indication that the Klingons were trying to occupy federation planets or were attacking the federation.  Uhara correctly accesses the Klingons as having honor.  The Klingon code of honor makes them less of a Villain.  The Klingons are in a civil war and the tribes or clans are struggling for power.  The federation does not seem interested in helping the Klingons rebuilt and prefers them to remain in a state of chaos, backward development, and isolated.",5,Was that movie good or what?,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,2412,"['usually', 'think', 'Spock', 'master', 'deception', 'however', 'am', 'starting', 'like', 'new', 'Spock', 'honest', 'brave', 'sensitive', 'others.The', 'plot', 'great', '400', 'year', 'old', 'villain', 'revived', 'Khan', 'wolf', 'Sonn', 'brought', 'back', 'cryogenic', 'freeze', 'build', 'advanced', 'weapons', 'designed', 'destroy', 'Klingon', 'empire', 'admiral', 'feels', 'War', 'inevitable', 'will', 'be', 'general', 'leading', 'war', 'effort', 'destroy', 'crew', 'Bounty', 'Bay', '72', 'pods', 'armed', 'photon', 'missiles', 'target', 'Klingon', 'homework', 'plot', 'almost', 'worked', 'Kirk', 'bring', 'Khan', 'back', 'earth', 'face', 'crimes', 'answer', 'death', 'Admiral', 'Pike.Kirk', 'Spock', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'McCoy', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'kicks', 'Khans', 'butt', 'war', 'Klingons', 'not', 'happen', 'Spock', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'vulcan', 'nerve', 'pinch', 'vulcan', 'death', 'touch', 'rage', 'Vulcans', 'are', 'war', 'race', 'control', 'combat', 'tendencies', 'Spock', 'high', 'degree', 'courage', 'resourcefulness', 'Khan', 'skull', 'crushing', 'technique', 'very', 'ruthless', 'Khan', 'superior', 'being', 'psychopathic', 'killer', 'desires', 'conquer', 'Kirk', 'set', 'fall', 'love', 'Dr.', 'Marcus.The', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'Scottie', 'was', 'resourceful', 'trans', 'warp', 'technology', 'innovative', 'Chekov', 'be', 'impressive', 'helm', 'engineering', 'Warp', 'core', 'fusion', 'reactor', 'collider', 'nice', 'twist', 'sci', 'fi', 'real', 'world', 'technology.The', 'sci', 'fi', 'special', 'efforts', 'were', 'great', 'loved', 'cgi', 'city', 'colors', 'backgrounds', 'music.What', 'do', 'learn', 'federation', 'learn', 'federation', 'war', 'top', 'brass', 'invest', 'technology', 'will', 'defeat', 'Klingons', 'enemy', 'federation', 'powerful', 'armed', 'weapon', 'can', 'destroy', 'ships', 'warp', 'predator', 'ship', 'learn', 'federation', 'moon', 'Praxis', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Klingons', 'are', 'tribal', 'survival', 'status', 'However', 'was', 'indication', 'Klingons', 'were', 'trying', 'occupy', 'federation', 'planets', 'were', 'attacking', 'federation', 'Uhara', 'correctly', 'Klingons', 'having', 'honor', 'Klingon', 'code', 'honor', 'less', 'Villain', 'Klingons', 'are', 'civil', 'war', 'tribes', 'clans', 'are', 'struggling', 'power', 'federation', 'not', 'seem', 'interested', 'helping', 'Klingons', 'rebuilt', 'prefers', 'remain', 'state', 'chaos', 'backward', 'development', 'isolated']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Benedict Cumberbatch as the terrorist is magical. With so many villains chewing up the sets in films these days he oozes a confident, contemptuous sense of superiority not seen since Roger Delgado. Lastly Simon Pegg as Scotty is the comic relief of the film, not a fool, not out of character but with great timing and sense of who is about him he easily steals any scene he's in, my favorite scene in the whole film is him complaining about Star fleet paperwork over who will sign for what.The down side to this product, keeping me from making this 5 stars is not the film itself but the extras or rather the way paramount is eeking them out to try and grind as much money from the fans as possible making them buy different variations of the same film just to get all the extras.

1588254,AEV640MKB3I9J,B009934S5M,Hank Drake,"[4, 6]","I&#8217;ve been a Star Trek fan for longer than I can remember. I was only two years old when the original series was cancelled, but I watched it early on in the syndication &#8211; around the same time I watched the Animated Series. I&#8217;ve seen all the movies on or shortly after opening day. After seeing the pilot of The Next Generation, I didn&#8217;t bother watching it again until the Third Season &#8211; by which time it was a much better series, and I&#8217;ve watched the subsequent series, but not with the dedication I had for the original.Of course, an adult looks for different things in entertainment than a child &#8211; at least I hope that&#8217;s the case. When I watched Trek initially, it was for the &#8220;neat-o&#8221; things: phasers, photon torpedoes, the ship being thrown off axis and crewmembers flying everywhere. Later, I watched for the familiar interactions of the crew. Even later, I picked up on the social/political commentary embedded in many episodes. Not long ago, I was watching an episode called &#8220;A Private Little War&#8221; which concerned the Klingons and Federation arming different factions on a neutral planet, and I realized the episode was an allegory about Vietnam.Many of these thoughts returned to me after watching the latest Trek film: Into Darkness. It&#8217;s certainly entertaining, in that it holds the viewer&#8217;s attention. Like most genre films these days, it&#8217;s paced relentlessly fast. I saw the movie twice, mostly because it was in 3-D, a first for a Star Trek film. But it was a curiously empty experience.SPOILERS AHEAD!First, there is the issue of the villain, who&#8217;s revealed to be none other than Khan Noonian Singh. Let&#8217;s ignore the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch, while a fine actor, is totally unsuited to the role of a North Indian superman. Let&#8217;s focus on how the character is written. Khan as portrayed in STID is a psychotic killer without remorse or redemptive qualities, who committed genocide during the 20th Century. This is poles apart from the way Khan was written in the original series, where he was described as &#8220;the best of the tyrants&#8230;there were no massacres under his rule.&#8221; The writing, and Ricardo Montalban&#8217;s performance, exuded a sense of ruthless nobility. During the course of the episode, Khan killed precisely ZERO crewmembers. It was for this reason that Kirk dropped charges against Khan and his followers and settled them on a planet &#8211; which subsequently suffered an ecological disaster. Even the revenge obsessed, Ahab-Like Khan of the second Star Trek film, who rightly blamed Kirk for neglecting to send follow up ships to check on their progress, was restrained enough to maroon the crew of the Reliant on Ceti Alpha V rather than killing them &#8211; although he killed several people later in the film. The original Khan and the alternate Khan are not the same villain, and the alternate timeline of the new movies is not an adequate excuse for that.  Further, what makes villains, from Montalban&#8217;s Khan to Hopkins&#8217; Lecter, interesting are when they can persuade the audience to understand their point of view &#8211; even if they are repelled by the character.Secondly, there is the film&#8217;s portrayal of Kirk as a reckless youth, too big for his britches and not worthy of commanding a starship. By the end of the film, he&#8217;s had his comeuppance. Whether he&#8217;s matured into the character seen in the original series remains to be seen.To be blunt, I find the portrayal of Kirk in the two most recent Trek films to be offensive. Although the new films&#8217; kirk grew up in an altered universe from the original series, it&#8217;s worth remembering that originally the young Kirk was remembered as &#8220;a stack of books with legs&#8221; by associates who knew him while in Starfleet Academy.The impression most people have of the original series' Kirk as a shoot first, talk later, bed down with every space-babe Captain is exaggerated. In reality, he was a lot closer to Pike and Picard than he is to the Kirk character in the two most recent movies. Also, William Shatner&#8217;s acting style has been so often and broadly parodied that it has changed the perceptions of casual and non-fans regarding his real portrayal. It&#8217;s worth remembering that Shatner&#8217;s performance in early TOS episodes was initially criticized as &#8220;wooden&#8221; by TV Guide. Shatner did his share of scenery chewing, but those were rare and mostly toward the end of the series&#8217; run and in the movies.Take for example, Kirk&#8217;s alleged aggression. There are plenty of episodes where Kirk resisted the impulse/advice to act more aggressively against a real or perceived enemy (Where No Man has Gone Before, The Devil in the Dark, The Corbomite Maneuver, The Conscience of the King, Arena, By Any Other Name, The Omega Glory). In nearly every episode in which there&#8217;s aggression, Kirk is backed into a corner until there&#8217;s no alternative (Where No Man has Gone Before), or undertakes it to stave off an expansion of hostilities (Balance of Terror).Then there is the issue of Kirk&#8217;s alleged promiscuity. He certainly had his share of &#8220;action&#8221;, but there were often qualifiers: under a spell/hypnosis/posession (Elaan of Troyus, Dagger of the Mind, Return to Tomorrow); amnesia (The Paradise Syndrome); divided in two by the transporter (The Enemy Within); the female was an android/simulacrum (What Are Little Girls Made of, Requiem for Methuselah, Shore Leave); operating under false pretenses (The Conscience of the King, Mirror Mirror, Catspaw, By Any Other Name, Wink of an Eye, The Mark of Gideon). He also had his share of exes &#8211; intelligent, independent females &#8211; most of whom regarded him highly, and vice-versa (Court Martial, The Deadly Years, The Wrath of Khan). There was one exception, Janet Lester, who was arguably psychotic. Kirk also suffered his share of romantic tragedy (The City on the Edge of Forever, The Paradise Syndrome), and was even given the brush-off (The Voyage Home). Finally, anyone who followed the series even casually could discern that many of these flings didn&#8217;t go &#8220;all the way&#8221;. Somehow, I can&#8217;t imagine the series&#8217; Kirk bedding down with two alien females while the Beastie Boys blasted from his sound system.Ultimately, of course, it's the writer who's responsible for the character's arc. Classic Trek was blessed with a great writer D. C. (Dorothy) Fontana, one of the few female writers in television in those days. She and the rest of the creative team - including the actors - made Kirk and Spock into complex, interesting, and imperfect characters. The J. J. Abrams franchise is run by post-adolescent fanboys who place cleverness and contrivance before substance &#8211; STID&#8217;s final act, which is a twist on TWOK, rings especially hollow.  Not that the new Trek isn't entertaining - but it's not a character driven drama &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t stand up to repeated viewing.  In many ways, this Trek is something I would have responded to when I was a child &#8211; but I doubt it would grow with me.",3,Star Trek Into Gimmickry,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,7233,"['8217',

The true fan can very easily see that this movie was not made by a Trekkie, but by someone who disliked the whole Roddenberry vision. The makers of this film thought that their meaningless regurgitation of generic Hollywood plot and dialogue was better than the sensitive and inspiring world of a true science fiction writer. The plot makes no sense. No continuity editing whatsoever.Kirk's eyes are fake contact blue in some scenes, just to be brownish in the next. In this movie they no longer show Kirk as an intelligent Captain who refers to Shakespeare and thinks deeply upon interpersonal meanings. This movie represents Kirk as an alcoholic man-slut who sleeps with two women at a time and listens to club/rap music. I guess the whole Kirk being a likable person is not as profitable as just showing the kids the new horrible role model that sells units in Hollywood today. Who cares that they're ruining yet another positive image? This is NOT Kirk. They missed the point of all the characters we've been developing for fifty years.Would anybody but a soulless Hollywood businessman imagine Scotty hanging out at the bar they show him in? Scotty is a likable old nerd who likes scotch and the hum of his engines, not hanging out in a thumping club for fashionable young people. No fan ever would have imagined this really stupid scene.Furthermore, in all the rest of Star Trek, whenever they show the Earth it is a calm and natural environment. We used to get the feeling that the future was something positive and better than today. This film shows a dark depressing Orwellian future, an all gray world of clubs, meaningless sex, and more bad music. The future of Earth in this vision is just a dark continuation of today's lowbrow shallow society. It is apparent that the makers of this film are either ignorant of Roddenberry's positive vision or that they are directly attacking it on purpose.They blatantly ignored the point of looking up towards a brighter future and instead made an allegory of today's stupid warlike culture here in a America. Interestingly the costumes are low quality, and by the end they are all literally lined up in what can only be described as Nazi uniforms. Oh, they took the time to remove the WWII symbols but that's about it. Nazi uniforms - hat and all.Also, there's the whole tribble problem. I'm not going to get into it too deeply, but let it be said that they include the tribble so we can do scientific testing on it! Great right?!? No. What they are really doing here is telling all actual fans that they have not watched and do not care about the previous fifty years of Trek mythos. Question: How can you have these creatures before your 5 year mission. Answer: Because we don't care about making sense. There are many more stupid examples of plot points that make no sense.Long story short: THIS IS NOT STAR TREK. It just looks like it occasionally and they use the say names. If you love Trek, skip this. You'll be glad you did.

Does not disappoint on any level whatsoever. While the fans may have been impatient for Abrams to get the ball rolling on this sequel ever since the release of the 2009 franchise reboot, practical reasoning makes it obvious that waiting is always better if the product is successful. In this sequel, the same emotions, feelings, and thoughts from the first Star Trek are all explored again, but on a much deeper and more aggressive level. This also goes for everything else in the movie. Much like the first movie, the acting is superb, the action is crazy but terrific, and the unexpected plot points are of course, always welcome. Some have compared this film to 'Iron Man 3', 'Skyfall', and 'The Dark Knight Rises' in its execution. They say that they are all too similar in plot, because they all feature a central male character that is known to regret his feelings and actions from the past. They all feature an enigmatic villain that defeats and/or humiliates the character on their own turf. The main character then has to make a decision whether or not to step outside their comfort zone, all at potential great cost to everyone else. While I agree that these similarities are true and very interesting, they do not discredit any of the mentioned films. Each of these films is fashioned in a different way, and gives the viewer an entirely different feeling. So I, for one, no matter what any detractors of this film may say, highly recommend this film to any Star Trek or sci-fi fan, or any movie fan in general.

1588281,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B009934S5M,Hound Dog,"[18, 28]","Make no mistake: this movie is not your grandaddy's Trek.  Per this latest sequel, the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise with director J.J. Abrams in the driver's seat is now confirmed as an adrenaline-pumping, warp-speed summer action adventure series with razzle-dazzle special effects.  Yes, Abrams' take on Trek is incredibly superficial as compared to the more intelligent, thematic films that the original cast appeared in.  You certainly won't be finding timeless literary references to Dickens, Melville, or even Shakespeare in J.J.'s movie.  That said, I still absolutely enjoyed seeing this film in the thrill of opening weekend and chose at the time to ignore its glaring flaws.  Hence, I hope you will find my review well-balanced as follows.THE GOOD: In terms of performances, the ensemble (Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, etc.) and newcomers Benedict Cumberbatch, Alice Eve, and Peter Weller provide top-flight entertainment equal to, if not better than the 2009 film.  Even if McCoy, Chekov, and especially Sulu have minimal screen time, the cast members each receive great individual moments.  Predictably, Kirk and Spock both have big action scenes, as Spock finally gets his first solo fistfight (it is well worth waiting for, especially for who gives him some help).  Alice Eve (as young Dr. Carol Marcus), Peter Weller (as Admiral Marcus), and Benedict Cumberbatch (as the mysterious John Harrison) blend seamlessly into the fast-paced, energetic storyline, as long as one can suspend disbelief about the script's plot holes.  Supported by a terrific musical score, the gaudy special effects are mostly superb, if not particularly realistic.  Without a doubt, the engagingly brash story is sufficient for the price of admission to see this movie.  Just think of it as a sneak preview of what likely director Abrams will do with the next ""Star Wars"" film in 2015.THE BAD: Yes, there are some spoilers here.  As much as I appreciated the wink-wink homages to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (watch for Kirk's use of the Han Solo phrase ""Punch it!"" and a familiar banking flight maneuver escaping from the Klingons) and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (Kirk and McCoy do their best Indiana Jones imitations fleeing from pursuing aliens in the opening sequence), it struck me that Abrams' screenwriting team should have tried harder to push originality and depth over the ""ain't it cool"" approach.  Case in point: the finale from ""STII: The Wrath of Khan"" is so blatantly lifted (and then ""reimagined"") that STII's screenwriters, director Nicholas Meyer and producer Harve Bennett, should have been at least acknowledged in the new film's lengthy credits.  Further, Cumberbatch's super-soldier is actually pretty generic compared to the original, fiendishly flamboyant incarnation of Trek's greatest villain, Khan.  Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, but he is not Khan - the late Ricardo Montalban made Khan so believably diabolical as is.  Here, viewers are supposed to believe that the new Khan is somehow both a super-soldier and a genius 23rd Century weapons designer thawed out from the 1990's by the Federation.  As a result, we get Kirk & Spock vs. Khan, Round 3 on steroids - even after thirty years, the two previous doses of Khan (from 1967 TV episode ""Space Seed"" and 1982's ""STII"") still remain plenty enough.Unfortunately, using ESP-powered Gary Mitchell (from the original series' pilot episode) as the film's villain didn't happen.  It would have made far more sense to use him for the Federation's treacherous secret weapon, complete with a personal grudge against Captain Kirk already in place.  Cumberbatch would have excelled playing Mitchell.  Further, the plot twists involving Admiral Marcus and a monster-sized starship OR a starship crashing OR Federation treachery OR a resurrected major character have already been done before in Trek movies.  Instead of exploring some strange new worlds in this alternate timeline, Abrams and the screenwriting team certainly deserve an EPA achievement award for all the recycling they end up doing here.THE QUESTIONABLE: Unlike its 2009 predecessor, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" hasn't inspired a glut of kid-oriented merchandising, especially toys.  That is a wise choice, as there are several adult scenes that are inappropriate for younger viewers.  I'm not just talking about the massive amounts of sci-fi violence (including the crushing of a human head and a violent attack against a defenseless woman), but there are also two instances of implied sexual content that easily could have been omitted.  Hence, please remember that the PG-13 rating is definitely justifiable.  As a final note, any appearance by Leonard Nimoy is always appreciated, but his cameo was frankly unnecessary.  I suspect he was included simply to bolster credibility of this new Khan storyline.If you enjoyed the 2009 film, then I highly recommend ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" -- even if the entertaining, depth-free script digs into the Trek archives far too often instead of boldly going somewhere else no one has gone before.Rating: 4/5 stars.P.S.  It is unclear when or if Paramount Studios will make another Trek film assuming media reports are accurate that the studio wasn't happy with an opening weekend box office take of less than $100 million dollars.  Time will tell, but any greedy studio should remember that a bloated movie budget doesn't override the law of unrealistic expectations.",4,"Get What You Pay For: ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a Pure

1588292,A10C4ZRZTWIV7Y,B009934S5M,Ian J. Hayes,"[6, 9]","&#60;Spoiler Alert - Plot elements will be discussed&#62; Let me be forthright and admit upfront that I do not like the new Star Trek movies. That applies to many other movies being issued by Hollywood these days as well. The reason is they sacrifice story for special effects and a barrage of sound. No doubt this is what many look for, and walk out of a theater thinking they saw a good movie when in fact they simply saw a lot of visual and auditory stimuli. I further detest that Hollywood will rewrite the legends of the characters and back story. I think of these newer Star Trek movies as a &#34;parallel universe&#34; where Star Trek lore and legend evolved differently. Traditionalists may look elsewhere, because the story we grew up with is not here. The new actors do a remarkable job of imitating the old characters, and even look like them too. The one exception is the character of Captain Kirk. The old Kirk had a human element where he would &#34;roll the dice&#34; upon occasion or play a hunch, much to Spock's chagrin. This has been overplayed in the new Kirk to the point where he is an immature, undisciplined, and loose cannon danger to all around him. This Kirk should never have been admitted to Star Fleet Academy. The story in this sequel is a remake of a remake. SPOILER: Our old nemesis Khan is back, although it is no longer Ricardo Montalban, nor do the other genetically altered supermen of the Botany Bay appear. Suffice to say, the framework is there for sufficient amounts of visual and auditory mayhem to ensue as the good guys try to defeat two bad guys, Khan and the evil admiral who revived him from cryogenic sleep. I find it a curious twist that the new Trek movies have tried so hard to be different from the old Trek universe to the point of changing the legend outright, and yet they have fallen back on one of the Enterprise's greatest (old) legendary enemies to create the cinematic motivation for this movie. Fascinating.

1588296,A1W9QAR7P545IC,B009934S5M,iMike,"[2, 4]","I did not go into this film with as much dreaded anticipation as I did its predecessor.  There were a lot of things to like and dislike about 'Star Trek Into Darkness,' but overall the film is very enjoyable.  I first watched it back in May in the theater, and again this past weekend after purchasing the Blu-Ray.  The spoilers for this film really put me off, I will admit.  Is he (the deliciously brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch) Khan, is he John Harrison?  After a while I became bored with all the speculation.The payoff - and let down - is that he's both, and I won't say more than that.  Remember that Abrams' reboot series exists within an alternate universe separate from that Roddenberry and his successors created, so the old rules don't apply.The opening sequence of the film is absolutely brilliant, with only one real letdown.  The opening sequence consists of Kirk (Chris Pine) and McCoy (Karl Urban) on a very lush and colorful planet (called Nibiru) running from very alien-looking primitive natives.  Elsewhere, Spock (Zach Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are attempting to deactivate a very violent volcano that's about to erupt and would eventually eradicate this burgeoning species.  The opening sequence, while it has nothing to do with the rest of the film, touches on one of the basic tenets of the entire Trek mythology and if Abrams' team is smart they will come back to this in future films.  My only gripe is that the crew has submerged the Enterprise under the planet's ocean to observe this primitive species.  First, a ship of the Enterprise's design and configuration could not enter an atmosphere much less be submerged in water.  If you are a diehard Trekkie you have to suspend your disbelief on that one.  Second, why do they need to be underwater to observe this culture or render the active volcano inert?  This is a primitive culture with no real technology ... they aren't going to a detect a ship in orbit.The plot for 'Into Darkness' is very well-conceived.  While I was disappointed they decided to take a classic Trek film (The Wrath of Khan) and some elements of TOS (John Harrison, a frequently used minor character) and even DS9 (Section 31), they took the references and twisted them into something unique so that the story felt fresh.  The inclusion of the character of Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), obviously much younger than when we met her in TWOK, added an extra dimension to the story's second villain, the war-hungry Starfleet Admiral who sought out war with the Klingons.  As in the 2009 film, each of the ""main characters"" received something important to do.  McCoy, Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu, and Checkov (Anton Yelchin) once again take a back seat to Kirk/Spock/Uhura, but each character is paid enough attention so that you don't feel they're just taking up space.  The inclusion of Carol Marcus as a member of the Enterprise crew at the end of the film, when the ship embarks on it's ""historic five-year mission"" is a nice surprise.  Clearly this was set up as a romantic plot-point for Kirk in the next film.I will say I hope for the third installment of the reboot series Abrams does not borrow elements from previous films.  I don't want to see anymore characters from the established Gene Roddenberry universe.  Abrams created the perfect set-up with his alternate universe, and since the end of this film shows the Enterprise embarking on its original ""five-year mission"" I'm sure there's a lot of original stories that would excite fans.  Before I close, there are two things I must mention.  First, the Klingons did not need a makeover.  They don't look menacing at all. Why did the Klingons need to be redone?  It's like remaking the Romulans in the last film.  The Klingons from The Next Gen/DS9/Voyager era look far more menacing than these ""glistening creatures.""  Second, the utilization of Leonard Nimoy was cheap and did nothing for the story.  If Spock Prime appears in the next film it needs to be sending him home to his own universe.  Keeping two Spocks in one universe is dumb.Overall I am giving this film five stars, because despite the minor plot holes the film is engaging and held my interest.  Abrams and Co. do a great job of continuing the story they began in 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot.",5,Better than the 2009 reboot!,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,4288,"['did', 'not', 'go', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'dreaded', 'anticipation', 'did', 'predecessor', 'were', 'lot', 'things', 'like', 'dislike', ""'Star"", 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'watched', 'back', 'May', 'theater', 'again', 'past', 'weekend', 'purchasing', 'Blu-Ray', 'spoilers', 'film', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'will', 'admit', 'deliciously', 'brilliant', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Khan', 'John', 'Harrison', 'while', 'became', 'bored', 'speculation.The', 'payoff', 'let', 'down', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'Remember', 'Abrams', 'reboot', 'series', 'alternate', 'universe', 'separate', 'Roddenberry', 'successors', 'created', 'old', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'film', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'letdown', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'McCoy', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'very', 'lush', 'colorful', 'planet', 'called', 'Nibiru', 'running', 'very', 'alien-looking', 'primitive', 'natives', 'Elsewhere', 'Spock', 'Zach', 'Quinto', 'Sulu', 'John', 'Cho', 'Uhura', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'are', 'attempting', 'deactivate', 'very', 'violent', 'volcano', 'erupt', 'would', 'eventually', 'eradicate', 'burgeoning', 'species', 'opening', 'sequence', 'nothing', 'do', 'rest', 'film', 'touches', 'one', 'basic', 'tenets', 'entire', 'Trek', 'mythology', 'Abrams', 'team', 'smart', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'future', 'films', 'only', 'gripe', 'crew', 'submerged', 'Enterprise', 'planet', 'ocean', 'observe', 'primitive', 'species', 'First', 'ship', 'Enterprise', 'design', 'configuration', 'could', 'not', 'enter', 'atmosphere', 'much', 'less', 'be', 'submerged', 'water', 'are', 'diehard', 'Trekkie', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'one', 'Second', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'be', 'underwater', 'observe', 'culture', 'render', 'active', 'volcano', 'inert', 'primitive', 'culture', 'real', 'technology', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'detect', 'ship', 'orbit.The', 'plot', ""'Into"", 'Darkness', 'very', 'well-conceived', 'was', 'disappointed', 'decided', 'take', 'classic', 'Trek', 'film', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'elements', 'TOS', 'John', 'Harrison', 'frequently', 'used', 'minor', 'character', 'even', 'DS9', 'Section', '31', 'took', 'references', 'twisted', 'something', 'unique', 'so', 'story', 'felt', 'fresh', 'inclusion', 'character', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'obviously', 'much', 'younger', 'when', 'met', 'TWOK', 'added', 'extra', 'dimension', 'story', 'second', 'villain', 'war-hungry', 'Starfleet', 'Admiral', 'who', 'sought', 'out', 'war', 'Klingons', '2009', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'received', 'something', 'important', 'do', 'McCoy', 'Scotty', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Sulu', 'Checkov', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'once', 'again', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'Kirk/Spock/Uhura', 'character', 'paid', 'enough', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'just', 'taking', 'up', 'space', 'inclusion', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'member', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'ship', 'historic', 'five-year', 'mission', 'nice', 'surprise', 'Clearly', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'romantic', 'plot-point', 'Kirk', 'next', 'film.I', 'will', 'say', 'hope', 'third', 'installment', 'reboot', 'series', 'Abrams', 'not', 'borrow', 'elements', 'previous', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'anymore', 'characters', 'established', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'universe', 'Abrams', 'created', 'perfect', 'set-up', 'alternate', 'universe', 'end', 'film', 'Enterprise', 'embarking', 'original', 'five-year', 'mission', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'original', 'stories', 'would', 'excite', 'fans', 'close', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'must', 'mention', 'First', 'Klingons', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'makeover', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'menacing', 'Why', 'did', 'Klingons', 'need', 'be', 'redone', 'remaking', 'Romulans', 'last', 'film', 'Klingons', 'Next', 'Gen/DS9/Voyager', 'era', 'look', 'far', 'more', 'menacing', 'glistening', 'creatures', 'Second', 'utilization', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'was', 'cheap', 'did', 'nothing', 'story', 'Spock', 'Prime', 'next', 'film', 'be', 'sending', 'home', 'own', 'universe', 'Keeping', 'two', 'Spocks', 'one', 'universe', 'dumb.Overall', 'am', 'giving', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'minor', 'plot', 'film', 'engaging', 'held', 'interest', 'Abrams', 'Co.', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'continuing', 'story', 'began', '2009', ""'Star"", 'Trek', 'reboot']",Star Trek Into Darkness

They are then obligated to the reader, listener, audience, from then on to remain faithful to those rules they have established for the story. No matter what kind of genre they are writing this one Rule never varies. The reason it is a Rule is because it is how the audience understands the tension of situations. Say you have aardvarks and they have spaceships. If you show the aardvarks outside the ship without any sort of protection on you are telling your audience that these aardvarks dont need the protection to function in space in this Universe. If you then later attempt to build tension by having your aardvark hero shot out of an airlock the audience will not see the dilemma because they know that the hero can and has survived in space without protection before.The writers of this movie fail at this, horrendously. Rules change to suite the whim of the writer leaving a confusing mash of action vignettes strung together without the consistency of a good story. The reason I bring this up in such detail is because to use the name Star Trek you are accepting the Rules within THAT Universe for your story. The name is shorthand for everything previously established. The writers of this film are very poor at writing stories. They have no consistency, even just within the movie, let alone beyond it. One writer who was called on the carpet actually went on twitter (no names) to lash out at his critics and bash fans. His most telling rant though was something like, ""there is a reason that some people write movies and others dont."" I expect he was implying that you must have a certain rare and non-questionable skill to be such a writer. I can think of dozens movies just in the past few years that clearly establish that for writing movies and television it is definitely not what you do but who you know that gets you the job.Im not one of those that think movies are much worse than in the past. Having seen hundreds if not a couple of thousand movies even, I can say that 80% of all movies in any year have been mostly crap. Sometimes its the writing, others the acting, or the director mad a mess of the plotting or direction. some are enjoyable with your brain turned off but most all are easily forgotten. Classics are movies NOT forgotten and maybe one a year, if even that, is rare to fall into this category. i personally believe that in 20 years Star Trek will still be enjoyed but these two ""reboots"" will be an embarrassing joke to the rest.I will say though that as a movie removed of any history and keeping your expectations low even if the names had all been changed it is a fun ride.As Star Trek, though, it is a painful experience. I wanted to like it on even a basic action, explosions, humorous quips, level but it failed to keep me interested with its completely awful writing; the dialog was painful and some of the situation completely unbelievable with what you had been told earlier.Abrams is well documented for ignoring anything in a story except spectacle and shock. Its in poorly written and paced television and in his poorly written movies.I have absolutely no idea why anyone would still let him make a movie, except perhaps that his name is well known. And just like M. Night Shamalamadindong he will inevitably fail one time too many. and his fans will abandon him, justly.If it were on a channel as I was surfing through I might leave it on but dont buy it and believe you are getting value.Others have spoken about the awful packaging that Paramount has done to wring every last penny from this poorly treated franchise. That in itself is a shame. It would be like inheriting the Hope Diamond and then having it breaking it down, advertising, ""BUY A PIECE OF THE HOPE DIAMOND !"" just to make squeeze the extra few dollars from its name recognition.I will lastly say (is anyone actually still reading this?) That I dont like the ""reboot"" of famous franchises in general because they really have little integrity to stand on by their own merits. Casablanca was actually made 3 times, the other 2 the same year as the 1 with Bogart and Becall. Only the Bogart/ Becall movie is remembered because everything came together in that film where the others didnt. Could a retelling add anything new to it? Very doubtful. Reboots are an ego trip, a self stroking of the Producer/Director to put his own stamp to something that came before. Comic books movies are an exception to this, in my personal opinion, because comic books are pretty much rebooted every time their is a new writer on board anyway. They recreate the origin with some variant and try to refashion the character to their own fanboy obsession with it. Whats funny to me is that except for a rare few, almost all the comic book reboots actually look identical, maybe a place name of an angle is adjusted. Why does Batman, or Superman need an origin story every single time its remade. We get it, we know, its the same thing for 2/3 of the movie followed by whatever minor variation of the villain is attached. To me most of the directors of reboots just have nothing relevant to say and so slap a reboot together.Okay, Im done now. Thanks for reading (the hushed silence of an empty room).Post Script Edit: One final word.

I had originally thought the new actors playing Bones, Scotty, and the Russian helmsman (sorry the character's name escapes me at the moment) were miscast.  However, I feel that they've grown into their roles more, or else I've grown to love them more in those roles.  The plot is a new rendition of the original Khan story.  For those who are unfamiliar with the original plot, the new one will seem unique and interesting.  Those who are familiar with the original plot may have some problem with the new version of Khan.  However, I didn't have a problem accepting the new version.  I happen to love Benedict Cumberbatch and liked the new twists on Khan.  I especially  like seeing a younger James Kirk learning to accept authority and how to be the great leader he ends up being.  There is also the developing brotherhood and friendship between Spock and Kirk, though rocky because of Spock's race and struggle to be truthful and analytical in all things.  It isn't easy for a Vulcan to live and work among emotional and sometimes irrational humans!  However, brotherhood and friendship does win in the end. The visuals are stunning.  The 3D effects well placed.  The only complaint I have in this movie is the production's decision to split the special features between the various sources for the DVD.  The ones on the DVD I purchased from Amazon are not available through Best Buy, or any other resource.  Which means you either don't get all the special features, or have to buy multiple versions of the DVD in order to see them all.  Come on, who would do that?

1588321,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B009934S5M,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[8, 13]","J.J. Abrams, who very successfully rebooted the long-dormant STAR TREK franchise in 2009, stated that he wanted to make a TREK film that wasn't exclusively for TREK fans. He wanted to make a film that anyone could get on board with the new crew of the USS Enterprise and enjoy just as much as longtime fans of the show and the previous films. It worked extremely well as an extremely entertaining and rollicking piece of summer entertainment, and not only was pleasing to those longtime fans, but brought in new fans as well. Now, Abrams is doubling down on the existing fans of the Star Trek Universe and still looking to bring in new fans with STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, which is such a breathtaking piece of stellar entertainment that it stands currently as the film to beat for this summer.Admittedly, it's hard to review this film without spoiling a myriad of plot points, but I'll do my best to avoid that. The film opens with all of our crew members returning to the Enterprise: Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as ""Bones"" McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty are all back and they're trying to save a planet from its own destruction, but Kirk violates Starfleet's infamous Prime Directive in saving Spock. This gets Kirk busted down by Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood, also reprising) to his first officer and Spock reassigned to another ship. But a terrorist explosion in London at a Starfleet facility carried out by rogue Starfleet officer John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch, most famous for his work as the titular detective in BBC's SHERLOCK) forces the upper echelon of Starfleet captains into a military operation, overseen by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), to take down Harrison. A horrific attack brings Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew, including a new science officer, Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), into conflict with Harrison and his plans for his revenge on Starfleet, which quickly escalates beyond what they would have imagined, and not every crew member will be returning from this voyage.Abrams, and writers Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof (most of these are part of Abrams' crew, working on some of his television shows like LOST, FRINGE and ALIAS, as well as some of his other films like MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III and the previous TREK film) are not reinventing the wheel here with INTO DARKNESS, but they are making that wheel turn at a frenetic and not frantic speed. All of the action and set pieces are huge and are tremendously exciting (particularly a sequence where a badly-damaged Enterprise is plummeting towards Earth being probably the highlight, but it's hard to say which is the most exciting) and it's clear that the films of Abrams' youth of the late 70's and early 80's, particularly films by Steven Spielberg (to whom he made the brilliant love-letter to in 2011's SUPER 8), have heavily influenced this film in how it moves and how it feels. The film has a breakneck pace that few of the more recent tentpole releases have had, but when it does need to slow down, it makes all it can of those scenes. And here, not only do the action sequences dazzle from a technical standpoint, there is a reason for them to be taking place both from a story and especially from a character point of view. There aren't many plot contrivances here that just propel the action forward and don't serve a need of character or story elements, which was something I felt seriously hindered the other big summer release so far, the tepid IRON MAN 3. Another standout here is the brilliant score from returning composer Michael Giacchino, who has become Abrams' John Williams here, rising the highs and sombering the lows of the story with his work.The returning cast once again do an excellent job filling their roles on the Enterprise, with each character getting a severely kick-ass moment in the narrative, but from an Enterprise perspective, as is usually the case, this film is very much about Kirk and Spock and their bromance, which is a mix of antagonism and deep caring. However, this film, if it's anyone's, it's Cumberbatch's performance that keeps you on your toes and keeps you transfixed. It's a performance of absolute superiority, not only in a character-related sense, but just the skill in which he envelops himself with his perfect diction, his physicality, and his sense that he's not the bad guy here, because no good villain thinks they're a villain. He does what he thinks is right, and what he knows to be superior to anyone else's goals. Just barely running second to Cumberbatch though is once again Quinto, who was the standout of the first film as well as Spock. He treads a careful line between his half-human/half-Vulcan sides, and this is the first time in this series of feature-length films where we see, at times, a much more emotional side of Spock, and it ultimately makes for a more compelling character as well as a much more fulfilling performance. Don't get me wrong; I love Leonard Nimoy as Spock, but I never felt that he could do more like I feel with Quinto. The only cast member that feels short-changed here is newcomer Eve (who sadly has been in some truly abysmal films such as SEX AND THE CITY 2 and THE RAVEN), because other than being someone who is obviously important in the series' mythology, she doesn't really have a lot to do.It's hard to keep the secrets that constantly cloak the productions of J.J. Abrams when you're reviewing one of his works, but I find that if you just stick to the basics, you can avoid things that people want to go in fresh to. The only thing I will state here is that, like in the first film, there's a lot of fan service to some of the bigger films of the original crew's films, but even moreso in this film. Some have called this film a ""remake"", which it most decidedly is not despite there being similar situations and even a strange mirror-universe restaging of one of the more famous scenes in the series, and the reason it's not a remake is because of that whole mirror-universe alternate-timeline that Abrams so refreshingly set the stage for in the first film of the reboot. That gives the narrative of this series a very unpredictible sensibility. There were moments I didn't see coming at all, and what's more is that no one crew member ever seems safe to return for the next film. Abrams really risks running the ire of fans with this series and probably even moreso with this film, but so far, it seems to be paying off in spades.If 2009's STAR TREK was that summer's IRON MAN, than Abrams' INTO DARKNESS is very much 2013's AVENGERS. It's a mighty film with an epic scope, great performances, great humor and a satisfaction that only the best of the summer blockbusters can give and will be very difficult to surpass on that level of sheer entertainment.",5,Summer truly begins with DARKNESS!,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,6877,"['J.J.', 'Abrams', 'who', 'very', 'successfully', 'rebooted', 'long-dormant', 'STAR', 'TREK',

The new stars, particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (Kirk and Spock) have done an amazing job with the mannerisms and interactions that Bill Shatner and Leonard Nimoy created with the characters.  The doctor was acceptable...the rest of the characters were just...characters. If you aren't looking at the screen, you'll swear that Scotty is Craig Ferguson talking. Maybe it's more realistic to have an actual Scotsman playing the part...but he doesn't sound or even remotely resemble James Doohan.  I wish they had allowed Doohan's son to play the part...it would have been much better.According to the hard core fans on Shatner's Facebook, some comic books in between the two new movies indicated the story in these to be an ""alternate timeline"".  I don't care for this concept, and the fact that they blew up Vulcan in the first movie.  I think it has screwed up the continuity that was always so carefully preserved with all the shows and movies, and it's a shame.That being said, it was still a fun movie...half of it taken from Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.  They used a lot of those scenes, although some reversed. You can't imagine Spock screaming KHANNNNNNNN! yet he does.  Both actors cry too easily, which is somewhat irksome.  They have taken the two most macho characters in our folklore and turned them into metro-sexuals. :-)Anyway, it's a good little video, especially if you aren't a hard core fan and won't be insulted with the changes.

1588347,A3SYV5BEYHJPKU,B009934S5M,Jason Wilks,"[6, 10]","JJ Abrams reboot of Star Trek in 2009 breathed new life into a franchise which CBS had given up on and which Paramount seemed non-committal to in it's present form. The result was a film which seemed to please current fans, but which brought in a new fan base (younger movie goers and overseas audiences), making ""Star Trek"" the highest grossing movie in franchise history.That bit of magic gave Paramount the balls to try a sequel with the new cast and gave Abrams some bit of clout - resulting in an IMAX presentation of the film as well as 3D.Because of the reboots appeal with new audiences - particularly overseas (where Star Trek has historically performed very poorly), the studio wanted to insure a wide appeal to justify the largest budget ever for a Star Trek film.  Focus groups were shown cut after cut of the film to give every beat of the movie the maximum appeal to audiences.The result is a Star Trek which is unparalleled in terms of being a very deliberately engineered product. The movie is clearly designed as a big budget event movie, more than it is a ""Star Trek"" movie. Removed or thickly veiled are many of the elements of previous Star Trek incarnations: literary references, idealistic ideologies and existential themes. Instead, it tries to satisfy fans with Star Trek references that might not be easily identified by ""newbies."" For instance, they reference Section 31 - a plot element from the Deep Space 9 series and as far as I know, doesn't appear in any of the other series. They introduce the character Carol Marcus - which is significant if you've seen The Wrath of Khan a million times and recognize her as the mother of Captain Kirk's son David. There is also a quick discussion about the Prime Directive and then that's pretty much the end of Star Trek culture outside of costuming.So, given that the movie is a product, more than any other Star Trek to date, the questions become: Is the movie any good? and Is this a good Star Trek movie? I have to say yes on both counts.This movie breaks the warp barrier in terms of action. 2009's Star Trek had more action than any Star Trek to date. This one starts at a run (literally) and the viewer has to work to catch up the whole show. Some in my family felt like the movie was moving so fast it was hard to catch all of what was going on. I didn't feel like that myself, but I can see their point.The Trek archetypal characterizations are really well performed by the cast and I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters. Additionally, the screenwriters have done a good job constructing dialog which feels true to each character.  There's plenty of humor here, but maybe not as much as the last film - there's just no room/time for joking around.The plot revolves around a terrorist attack which spurs Starfleet brass to mount an assassination attempt. Kirk fights with his feelings for revenge and as the plot unfolds, interesting conspiracies arise.The emotional component of the film is another strength of the film. Characters are given emotional motivations and the stakes are high - both for earth and Starfleet, but also for the Enterprise crew.

Yet despite my best efforts, I can't come up with a better description for this movie.  It's incoherent, poorly written and nonsensical.  It also apparently contains some sort of subliminal brain washing hidden in all of Abram's lens flares that cause people to enjoy it, because when I explain my reasons for disliking this movie I hear a lot of, &#34;it's just a good, fun movie!  It's got good action and it's Star Trek!  Don't over-analyze it!  JJ ABRAMS IS THE BEST DIRECTOR EVER.  ALL HAIL ABRAMS.&#34;  Sorry, I just can't agree to any of this and I refuse to jump on the Into Darkness bandwagon.  Okay, let's get into some details.  And as a disclaimer, I will NOT be able to keep this spoiler free.  You've been warned and what-have-you.The 2009 Star Trek reboot wasn't the best science fiction movie ever, nor the best Star Trek movie, but it was really fun and if you overlooked the flaws (which weren't nearly as numerous as they are in this followup) it really was quite enjoyable.  One of the best sequences in that movie, if not THE best, was the introductory scene.  It was intense, it evoked emotion and it was a great action sequence.  I had no doubt that I was watching a Star Trek movie.  The intro scene to Into Darkness was none of the above.  It was goofy, pointless and made no sense.  I understand it laid the groundwork for the whole &#34;we're supposed to be friends, Spock!&#34; plot point, but there are better ways that could have been done.  The biggest flaw with that sequence... why was the Enterprise under water?? Why wasn't it in orbit where it belonged?  The pasty black-eyed natives wouldn't have seen it there.  The entire reason they put it there was to have the scene where it rises up with water falling off of it.  But why do we NEED that scene?  It's a space ship!  We already got the Enterprise rising up through Saturn's Ring in the last movie, and that scene looked cool and made more sense.  This intro only laid the ground work for how little sense the rest of this movie makes.So next we're introduced to the movie's villain (or merely one of them, as we later find out).  And he's mysterious and borderline interesting and made cooler by the fact that he's played by Benedict Cumberbach.  But wait... how does he convince the star fleet officer to blow up a building and kill hundreds of his peers AFTER he saved the life of said officer's daughter?  What kind of monster would kill hundreds of people for his child in the first place, let alone AFTER their child was already saved?  Couldn't he have at least TRIED to contact a superior officer?  &#34;Hey boss, I think some dude has it out for us, because he wants me to blow everyone up.&#34;  No.  He's just a sheep and does what the bad guy wants.Okay, I'll just cut the &#34;bad guy&#34; crap and say it.  It's Khan.  KHAAAAAAAAN! You know, the villain in one of the most iconic Star Trek films that already came out 30 years ago?  Yes apparently we need him as a villain again, because someone thought that giving this movie its own identity was a bad idea.  Not surprising since Abrams doesn't seem to have an original bone in his body.  Except this time Khan is a white gentleman, presumably English. But the character is Indian.  Okay... Well, as long as they give him good motive and make him an interesting character, that's forgivable right? WRONG.  The original Khan was a such a good villain in Wrath because he and the Enterprise crew had a history. He had a true REASON to hate Kirk.  This Khan's weight as a villain in this continuity is baseless.  He's apparently a puppet to a corrupt Starfleet admiral who found him randomly, suspended for 300 years in the vacuum of space, and wants to use him to build a star ship with modern technology. *record abruptly stops.*  What???  Admiral Marcus is going to use the 300 year old man to develop technology that exceeds current tech?  Who thought of this during the writing process?  It makes no sense.That brings me to yet another item in the stream of things that make no sense: Admiral Marcus.  At first I really liked the idea of the Starfleet Admiral trying to beef up Star Fleet into a force to be reckoned with against the Klingons.  The plot of the movie should have been based around THIS.  I have a feeling it originally was and some producer put his hand in the cookie jar and said &#34;okay, this is good but we need Khan in it.  People won't watch it unless Khan is there.&#34;  It seemed like Marcus was pulling the whole &#34;the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many&#34; schtick, letting one crew take the wrap for a mess that would lead to Starfleet needing a greater military presence.  But then I thought, &#34;wait, why is this even necessary?  Doesn't the Federation have the foresight to know that they're surrounded by potential enemies everywhere and that they already NEED a strong military presence?  Didn't Nero's super-ship prove that a few years before?  There shouldn't need to be a stupid evil plot to sacrifice the most celebrated ship in the fleet and all of it's crew to make it happen.  And why is Marcus so evil?  Why wouldn't he care that he's killing a ship with a crew of hundreds on it?  This is just bad writing.  A villain without a purpose, evil for evil's sake.  This isn't Disney and we should expect more.You'd think the good guys, the crew of the Enterprise, would be the one shining spot in this movie, the one redeeming factor.  This is ALMOST the case, except that the 2009 movie handled the crew much better.  Here, Kirk isn't so much clever as a fumbling, lucky idiot (though I still do enjoy Pine as the casting choice.) I had enough of self-doubting, boyfriend Spock in the first movie, I didn't need more of him here.  Ohura is nothing but a nagging girlfriend.  Clearly there could have been SOMETHING more useful to do with her character.  Urban as Bones is still enjoyable, I don't have too much negative to say about him.  The roles that the rest of the crew had were easily forgettable, even the wonderful Simon Pegg couldn't hold this crew together.I could keep going... (why did Khan put his people in torpedoes, of all things?? Why did they have to ask future Spock for help? Isn't that cheating?) but this is going long enough.  If the movie weren't so pretty to look at, I wouldn't have given it the extra star.  As it is, that was the only enjoyable thing about it for me.  I really hope that Abrams will be too busy with Star Wars to get his hands into the next one.  Perhaps with a better director and a better script for #3 (if there will be a #3) I can forget that this mess even happened.  May this franchise live-long and prosper under more capable hands in the future.",2,Into Darkness is a steaming pile of Trek,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,6790,"['title', 'alone', 'review', 'may',

Star Trek Next Generation was generally weak but had a few very good, very well written science fiction episodes. Don't have much good to say about Enterprise or Deep Space Nine.  J. J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek reboot was quite good, respectful of the origin myth while adding to it, introducing characters we all know in a very fresh way, etc.  In short it was very well written and directed.  I'm also a fan of J. J. Abrams work in general, as it's often of relatively high quality.In this context, Star Trek Into Darkness has very little to recommend it, and the writing is very weak.  The plotting is weak.  Most characters are shallow and lazily written.  The flow drags often.  Probably the best aspect is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain, since he can probably make even poor lines and weak scripts sound good through superb delivery.I'm very disappointed at a squandered opportunity.

I just can't wait to see what comes next!!I was a fan of the original Star Trek on TV and of all the movies. So it is great to now see new versions which capture the spirit of the old originals.

Being the next reboot of the series on events from the first films, this one will strike the hearts or hatred of Trekkies with its retelling of ***SPOLIER***  The Wrath of Khan. Personally, I thought they did a fantastic job turning Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch into the representation of Khan as a more sane, plotting, and devious enemy over the somewhat meddened version from the original film. The casting remains excellent with all the key roles filled by ample talent and good performances, Quinto does a better performance as Spock, letting his more human side show both through attitude and action, letting us see an improvement to his character through more freedom in not being tied to the original Spocks emotional restrictions. Karl, Simon, Chris, and crew all do well, and the only issue with casting I have, is in Alive Eves role as the admirals daughter. First off, she is absolutely gorgeous. She also is an accomplished and skilled actress. However, her addition to the film struck me as uneeded. It felt she was placed here to eek by in an underlying role with just enough ties to the plot to make her relevant long enough to get a &#34;for no reason&#34; underwear shot.As a red blooded male, it was... well fantastic, but for the film, seemed like a juvenile attempt at pulling the Geek and Gamers to the film by being able to use it in the preview and using her to sell extra tickets. Everything she did in the film, every relation she had in it, could have been removed completely, or replaced by existing cast, and it in no way would have impacted the film. For the Record, THIS IS A STAR TREK MOVIE, you had every self respecting nerd, geek, gamer, trekkie, and Sci-Fi fan preordering tickets before the first teaser finished playing. Do not insult us by thinking we need the blond bomshell in a skirt to compete the film experience. I found it rather distastefull of the franchise, and insulting to Ms. Eve, and hindering to the movie. I in no way dock the film for it, as it is not like I will not enjoy her scenes, just did not appreciate the lowbrow approach to her characters inclusion into the series.Other than that small huge rant, I felt just about everything was improved over the first installment. Experiencing it in 3D boosts the enjoyment to new heights, and there is no shortage of CGI Eye Candy, the look at the rebooted Klingon was well done, with a happy medium between the original envisionment of them (if you do not know, go look that up lol) and the &#34;classic&#34; look most are used to. The characters meld and bounce off each other much smoother and the time they spent together through the first tale has really bonded them better both in dialogue and action, making a smoother film, with each being able to bring out more of the nuances of each individual. Things that friends do with each other that creates the familiarity with the characters and invests you more in the film.I have no qualms about recommending the new reboot films to anyone, and see them only growing better in time. I would love however, to see them allow a new non-rebooted tale for the cast to stretch out with and make their own marks on the franchise instead of restricting them to follow in very big footsteps.

Director J.J. Abrams has clearly gotten into his stride with this latest second one. He has decided to spice things up a little, but not too much. It is a little edgier than his first but at the same time it also ticks all the right boxes from the Star Trek ""tradition"".This time it's all systems go as the movie opens with some hard-hitting volcanic and Vulcan  action. As a result of what occurs on the planet, Kirk makes a decision to bend the rules and ignore the Prime Directive. With good reason I might add. But the decision lands him in some trouble. It's not all about logic.The consequences of this do not last long. A weightier matter soon develops. There is a terrorist attack in London. It also transpires that Starfleet has not been whiter than white. A villain with a grudge is now on the loose. And this dangerous enemy has brains. There are a few little twists, all is not what it seems.What happens to Kirk much later on in the movie comes as a big surprise.

The special effects are very good and quality of the performances of the cast are spot on and bring across the personality and relationships that the characters have developed as they begin to meld themselves into a young crew of a Federation starship. Chris Pine is molding himself into the role of Captain Kirk quite well and he brings a type of enthusiasm into the roll that makes you simply want him and the crew to succeed.

I do wish that the script had not depended so much on bringing back so many of the Star Trek clich&eacute;s and old characters. After all the future is different with the destruction of the Vulcan home world in the first movie of this series and there are so many opportunities for many great plots and events to occur differently. The future films do not have to fall so much in line with the old antagonist characters and there is a whole galaxy to explore.That being said the film is still exciting and action packed.

My impression of the STORY LINE is that this is NOT, REPEAT NOT AN ACTUAL STAR TREK representation.  For someone who was fortunate to watch the REAL Star Trek with Caption James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, these cartoon characters do not come close to representing that classic TV series.  This Star Trek should be called Alternate Universe Star Trek.  Simply put, the movie is ILLOGICAL.  The time sequencing is screwed up. WHY: In this version, Khan encounters the Enterprise, when the Crew had just been assembled.  And rather then Khan and his genitically altered crew being put on a distant planet, they were put into a frozen state?  So a past event occurred before a future event, but that out of sequence event coincided with the initial launching of the Enterprise, which was the ship that was used to maroon Khan and his people.  Then there is Old Spock speaking to young Spock about a past event, that is reoccuring, HUH?  Sorry but this is just another rip off of the extreem creative ability that America had at one time.  Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek and it was successful, so now rather then write a NEW level based on that success, the creaters of this ""version"" decided to recreate the characters and attempt to steal the greatness that the series once had.  To give credit where credit is due, this BOGUS cartoon Star Trek is an entertaining movie, but you must forget all that you know about the REAL Star Trek series.  I wonder why JJ Abrams did not make a ""future"" version of the highly successful series by creating new characters with NEW names.  I guess that it is much easier to steal thunder then create it on your own.  To restate: The movie is worth watching, if you, much like the ""writers"" of this dribble, forget every thing that you knew about Star Trek, Star Trek The Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, and Star Trek Voyeger.",2,Not REALLY Star Trek,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,2019,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'great', 'reviews', 'are', 'seem', 'be', 'special', 'FX', '3D', 'what', 'ever', 'impression', 'STORY', 'LINE', 'NOT', 'REPEAT', 'NOT', 'AN', 'ACTUAL', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'representation', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'fortunate', 'watch', 'REAL', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Caption', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'crew', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'representing', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Alternate', 'Universe', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Simply', 'put', 'movie', 'ILLOGICAL', 'time', 'sequencing', 'screwed', 'up', 'WHY', 'version', 'Khan', 'Enterprise', 'when', 'Crew', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'assembled', 'rather', 'then', 'Khan', 'genitically', 'altered', 'crew', 'being', 'put', 'distant', 'planet', 'were', 'put', 'frozen', 'state', 'past', 'event', 'occurred', 'future', 'event', 'sequence', 'event', 'coincided', 'initial', 'launching', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'ship', 'was', 'used', 'maroon', 'Khan', 'people', 'Then', 'Old', 'Spock', 'speaking', 'young', 'Spock', 'past', 'event', 'reoccuring', 'HUH', 'Sorry', 'just', 'rip', 'extreem', 'creative', 'ability', 'America', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'created', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'successful', 'so', 'now', 'rather', 'then', 'write', 'NEW', 'level', 'based', 'success', 'creaters', 'version', 'decided', 'recreate', 'characters', 'attempt', 'steal', 'greatness', 'series', 'once', 'had', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'BOGUS', 'cartoon', 'Star', 'Trek', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'must', 'forget', 'know', 'REAL', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'wonder', 'why', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'future', 'version', 'highly', 'successful', 'series', 'creating', 'new', 'characters', 'NEW', 'names', 'guess', 'much', 'easier', 'steal', 'thunder', 'then', 'create', 'own', 'restate', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'much', 'writers', 'dribble', 'forget', 'thing', 'knew', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyeger']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I'm an undying fan of the original series.  The characters were innovative for their time and just fun to watch in any situation.  They all had distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses that made you care.  At its core, they were like a family.  In the Abrams version, they're all like caricatures who are slightly off mark.  But the biggest distraction is Spock and Uhura.  First off all, I don't buy their romance.  It doesn't add to the movie, the plot or anything.  Its unnecessary and annoying.  I mean Spock bickering with his girlfriend while they are on a dangerous mission?  Spock claims to be all about logic and duty.  So how can he rationally explain his dalliance with Uhura?  First, aren't Vulcans only supposed to get down once every 7 years?  Second, isn't their a regulation against fraternization between crew members.  But mostly, its just illogical.  Spock must realize that this relationship is doomed to failure thus prolonging it makes no sense.  People may argue that Spock is attracted to her but that means he's following his emotions, not logic.  So he has no problems backstabbing Captain Kirk because of his logic.  But having a volatile relationship, with a fellow crew member, which may interfere with his duties, is his idea of logical?  In the original series, he was always committed to Starfleet, the ship and his shipmates.  No matter how many girls threw themselves at him, he would not reciprocate.  The only time he went against logic was when engaging in noble acts like saving his Captain and crew.  That was Spock's charm.  But the new Spock is selfish, self-indulgent and petty.  He's more interested in getting some trim, fighting with his Captain and boasting about his logic.  He's just not Spock.  Finally,...they really couldn't find anyone else to play Khan?

I found that the actors portray the original characters very well, convincingly capturing their personalities and appearance while, at the same time, making them their own.What particularly helps is that I view these as I complete reboot, and in no way try to tie this into the original Trek universe (despite old Spoke's involvement).  (To me, trying to link these to the old series is as crazy as trying to link the Dark Knight saga to the old Tim Burton Batman movies.)The other is being honest. Let's face it, the original Star Trek movies were a mixed bag. Half were really good (2,4,6) and half stank (1,3,5). Nor were they as deep as people would like to believe. Yes they spoke of high minded ideals (most that would never work in real life - such as the idea that all mankind simply works for the mutual benefit of society, obeying their superiors with a smile, and with no thought of personal gain other than the satisfaction of a job well done), but in the end, a lot came down to who had the superior firepower/military tactics anyway. (Oh, and to those that claim that this movie is not Sci-Fi because to is not focused on the technology, the tech described in TOS, and especially TNG, was nothing but techno-babble.)This movie, as its predecessor, was a fun action flick that paid homage to an enjoyable franchise that was fun to watch, but should never have been taken as seriously as it has been.There are a few concerns with this movie, however, especially for parents who are wandering if they should let their children watch. There is one completely pointless scene of Kirk in bed with two lady aliens (it's only purpose, I suppose, is to reinforce the notion that he's a lady's man - which is shown easily enough with the way Kirk is distracted by anyone walking by with a skirt), and a scene in which Carol Marcus strips down to her underwear (the only purpose seeming to be to show off Alice Eve in as little as possible). Because of these two scenes, though rather brief, I find the movie to be less than suitable for impressionable children.** Possible spoiler **My only other real criticism of the film is the beginning portion with the sick child. I know it was to foreshadow the effects of Khan's blood, but the somber tone of those scenes felt completely out of place with the rest of the movie, especially since it tries to pull the heartstrings for a little girl that is never again seen in the movie.",4,"Good remake, with but a few parental concerns.",1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,2528,"['not', 'perfect', 'did', 'enjoy', 'new', 'version', 'Star', 'Trek', 'as', 'well', '2009', 'predecessor', 'found', 'actors', 'portray', 'original', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'convincingly', 'capturing', 'personalities', 'appearance', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'own.What', 'particularly', 'view', 'complete', 'reboot', 'way', 'try', 'tie', 'original', 'Trek', 'universe', 'old', 'Spoke', 'involvement', 'trying', 'link', 'old', 'series', 'as', 'crazy', 'trying', 'link', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'saga', 'old', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'movies', 'other', 'being', 'honest', 'Let', 'face', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'were', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Half', 'were', 'really', 'good', '2,4,6', 'half', 'stank', '1,3,5', 'were', 'as', 'deep', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'Yes', 'spoke', 'high', 'minded', 'ideals', 'most', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'real', 'life', 'such', 'idea', 'mankind', 'simply', 'mutual', 'benefit', 'society', 'obeying', 'superiors', 'smile', 'thought', 'personal', 'gain', 'other', 'satisfaction', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'end', 'lot', 'came', 'down', 'who', 'had', 'superior', 'firepower/military', 'tactics', 'anyway', 'Oh', 'claim', 'movie', 'not', 'Sci-Fi', 'not', 'focused', 'technology', 'tech', 'described', 'TOS', 'especially', 'TNG', 'was', 'nothing', 'techno-babble', 'movie', 'predecessor', 'was', 'fun', 'action', 'flick', 'paid', 'homage', 'enjoyable', 'franchise', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'as', 'seriously', 'been.There', 'are', 'few', 'concerns', 'movie', 'however', 'especially', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'wandering', 'should', 'let', 'children', 'watch', 'one', 'completely', 'pointless', 'scene', 'Kirk', 'bed', 'two', 'lady', 'aliens', 'only', 'purpose', 'suppose', 'reinforce', 'notion', 'lady', 'man', 'shown', 'easily', 'enough', 'way', 'Kirk', 'distracted', 'anyone', 'walking', 'skirt', 'scene', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'down', 'underwear', 'only', 'purpose', 'seeming', 'be', 'show', 'off', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'two', 'scenes', 'rather', 'brief', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'less', 'suitable', 'impressionable', 'children', 'Possible', 'spoiler', '**My', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'criticism', 'film', 'beginning', 'portion', 'sick', 'child', 'know', 'was', 'foreshadow', 'effects', 'Khan', 'blood', 'somber', 'tone', 'scenes', 'felt', 'completely', 'place', 'rest', 'movie', 'especially', 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'little', 'girl', 'never', 'again', 'seen', 'movie']",Star Trek Into Darkness

You need not be a lifelong fan to enjoy this spectacular roller coaster ride of a movie but if you are, you will enjoy it... O-SO-MUCH-BETTER! The inferences & nods to past TV episodes & the early movies of the 80's are in of themselves so richly rewarding. You will find yourself unable to control your smiling as you discover the creativeness of the writing, as the originality of the story keeps that 'alternate reality' concept going. This film is one of the most enjoyable films to come out in a long, long time. It is thoroughly entertaining. The audience I saw it with stood up and clapped. When was the last time you experienced that in a movie theater? As previously stated 'STID' propels you on a non stop roller coaster ride but also has a great deal of heart as well. The friendship dynamic between Spock & Kirk is further developed in a really great, dramatic way. Some reviewers poo-pooed the character traits of all the beloved crew as being tired & predictable. However, as a Star Trek fan, isn't that what we've come to expect? In fact a true fan would be truly disappointed if Scotty & McCoy did not behave accordingly. A major surprise awaits and is done in such a subtle unexpected manner that you never see it coming. That's all I'll say on that or I'll have to be indited for being a huge spoiler. There are a ton of special F/X but they are done well and are not over bearing, in fact they add & give the movie it's richness. I met Gene Roddenberry when I was in college and was in awe of the man. I know in my heart that he would be very proud of this handling of his brain-child. Kudos to J.J. Abrams, Kurtzman & Orci for the respect and dignity they continue to give this much loved story & the characters who inhabit the world of Star Trek. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto shine.

I had heard of Star Trek but never saw it and when I finally did, I wondered why I never watched it. The show was groundbreaking and gave me a renewed love for astronomy and science. I have since read many novels and watched every series (including the cartoon). This movie is not even in the same quadrant as previous Treks. Sure, it has very good effects and some of the action is good, but the writing for the movie is atrocious. I kept wondering if the writers ever watched Star Trek before. News flash Orci and Kutzman, Spock would never get involved with a cadet when he is an instructor; Kirk would not act like a drunken frat boy and Starfleet would never promote such a person to captain. It's hard to discuss the movie without spoilers, so be warned.******** SPOILERS BELOW ********The movie starts out with Kirk and McCoy on a planet that is about to experience a world ending event. Both are running from the natives and Kirk is carrying one of their scrolls but there is no explanation why he took the scroll. They eventually get beamed onto the Enterprise that's sitting underwater. Yes, you read that right...underwater. The reason given for them being underwater is because of the Prime Directive; they can't allow themselves to be seen by the natives. Then why not be in orbit, you say? GOOD QUESTION! The scene turns to Spock, Uhura and Sulu in a shuttlecraft trying to deliver a cold-fusion device into the super volcano that will destroy the planet when it erupts. Spock is lowered down into the volcano but the shuttle is rocked by waves of heat from the volcano, and Sulu must withdraw. Spock sets the timer on the machine and is awaiting his fate. Kirk decides to go against protocol and emerge from the ocean and beam Spock aboard. Of course, the natives see this and starts worshiping the ship as some type of deity. Spock reports Kirk and Kirk is reduced in rank to first officer.The problems I had with this film is Spock has more emotion than most of his human compatriots. Also, Kirk is rash and undisciplined yet a military organization gives him the rank of captain not because of experience but because of who his father was. Trek physics has been drastically changed; you can now travel from sector to sector in minutes instead of days and you can beam from planet to planet (why have Starships anymore). When Kirk was on the Klingon homeworld, he used his handheld communicator to call Scotty, who was on Earth (even in TNG they couldn't do that). Security in this new Trek world is none existent; Scotty was able to get on the most powerful starship without a single security officer around and the villain was able to fly up to Starfleet Headquarters without a single security drone, ship, officer, etc... to stop him. And now death is even reversed with magic blood.The writers had better do their homework for the next movie or it might be their last.",3,Pretty good effects & action but nothing else,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,3058,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'reviews', 'STID', 'while', 'now', 'decided', 'should', 'write', 'review', 'myself.I', 'have', 'been', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'first', 'year', 'college', 'back', '1981', 'had', 'heard', 'Star', 'Trek', 'never', 'saw', 'when', 'finally', 'did', 'wondered', 'why', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'gave', 'renewed', 'love', 'astronomy', 'science', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'novels', 'watched', 'series', 'including', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'quadrant', 'previous', 'Treks', 'Sure', 'very', 'good', 'effects', 'action', 'good', 'writing', 'movie', 'atrocious', 'kept', 'wondering', 'writers', 'ever', 'watched', 'Star', 'Trek', 'News', 'flash', 'Orci', 'Kutzman', 'Spock', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'involved', 'cadet', 'when', 'instructor', 'Kirk', 'would', 'not', 'act', 'drunken', 'frat', 'boy', 'Starfleet', 'would', 'never', 'promote', 'such', 'person', 'captain', 'hard', 'discuss', 'movie', 'spoilers', 'so', 'be', 'warned', '********', 'SPOILERS', 'BELOW', '********The', 'movie', 'out', 'Kirk', 'McCoy', 'planet', 'experience', 'world', 'ending', 'event', 'are', 'running', 'natives', 'Kirk', 'carrying', 'one', 'scrolls', 'explanation', 'why', 'took', 'scroll', 'eventually', 'get', 'beamed', 'Enterprise', 'sitting', 'underwater', 'Yes', 'read', 'right', 'underwater', 'reason', 'given', 'being', 'underwater', 'Prime', 'Directive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'seen', 'natives', 'Then', 'why', 'not', 'be', 'orbit', 'say', 'GOOD', 'QUESTION', 'scene', 'Spock', 'Uhura', 'Sulu', 'shuttlecraft', 'trying', 'deliver', 'cold-fusion', 'device', 'super', 'volcano', 'will', 'destroy', 'planet', 'when', 'Spock', 'lowered', 'down', 'volcano', 'shuttle', 'rocked', 'waves', 'heat', 'volcano', 'Sulu', 'must', 'withdraw', 'Spock', 'timer', 'machine', 'awaiting', 'fate', 'Kirk', 'go', 'protocol', 'emerge', 'ocean', 'beam', 'Spock', 'aboard', 'course', 'natives', 'see', 'worshiping', 'ship', 'type', 'deity', 'Spock', 'reports', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'reduced', 'rank', 'first', 'officer.The', 'problems', 'had', 'film', 'Spock', 'more', 'emotion', 'most', 'human', 'compatriots', 'Also', 'Kirk', 'rash', 'undisciplined', 'yet', 'military', 'organization', 'rank', 'captain', 'not', 'experience', 'who', 'father', 'was', 'Trek', 'physics', 'been', 'drastically', 'changed', 'can', 'now', 'travel', 'sector', 'sector', 'minutes', 'instead', 'days', 'can', 'beam', 'planet', 'planet', 'why', 'have', 'Starships', 'anymore', 'When', 'Kirk', 'was', 'Klingon', 'homeworld', 'used', 'handheld', 'communicator', 'call', 'Scotty', 'who', 'was', 'Earth', 'even', 'TNG', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'Security', 'new', 'Trek', 'world', 'none', 'existent', 'Scotty', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'most', 'powerful', 'starship', 'single', 'security', 'officer', 'villain', 'was', 'able', 'fly', 'up', 'Starfleet', 'Headquarters', 'single', 'security', 'drone', 'ship', 'officer', 'etc', 'stop', 'now', 'death', 'even', 'reversed', 'magic', 'blood.The', 'writers', 'had', 'better', 'do', 'homework', 'next', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'last']",Star Trek Into Darkness

However, as the plot unfolds we learn that the renegade is none other than Khan, a genetically enhanced tyrant from the Eugenics wars who has been frozen in stasis for the last few hundred years.Star Trek: Into Darkness is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end. J.J. Abrams has successfully rebooted the franchise in ""Action Adventure"" mode. Hardly five minutes of screen time goes by without a fist fight or chase or an explosion. It is all well done, the effects are first rate and the audience is hardly given time to catch their breath or think.And, from my perspective, therein lies the problem. For me, as I suspect for most long time Star Trek fans, my love of the series has always been about the ideas. In scrapping this aspect, J.J. Abrams has taken out much of what made Star Trek so appealing.It's hard to talk about this without sounding pedantic, but, for example, let's take scientific terminology. There's always been a fair amount of technical jargon in the Star Trek lexicon. But up until now it's always made some kind of sense and been part of a carefully thought out and self-consistent fictional universe. In this film, however, when someone refers to a device that turns everything into ice as a ""cold fusion"" generator, it reveals not only what a painfully weak grasp of science the writers have, but also how far from Gene Rodenberry's original conception the franchise has slid.If it weren't for the cast, this dumbed-down over-amped approach would probably ruin the film. However, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are well cast as Kirk and Spock and rest of the crew turn in solid and energetic performances which make the movie enjoyable.I was particularly impressed by Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. It's hard not to feel nostalgia for Ricardo Montalban's rendition of this character who appeared the original series episode Space Seed and later in The Wrath of Khan. Into Darkness' hectic pace gives Cumberbatch very little time to craft a well-rounded portrayal, but he brings such a magnetic presence to the screen, that he steals every scene.",3,Fun...But Not Really Star Trek,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,2262,"['When', 'rogue', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'Federation', 'leaders', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'are', 'sent', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'Klingon', 'space', 'hunt', 'down', 'criminal', 'However', 'plot', 'learn', 'renegade', 'none', 'other', 'Khan', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'tyrant', 'Eugenics', 'wars', 'who', 'been', 'frozen', 'stasis', 'last', 'few', 'hundred', 'years.Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'fun', 'thrill', 'ride', 'beginning', 'end', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'successfully', 'rebooted', 'franchise', 'Action', 'Adventure', 'mode', 'Hardly', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'fist', 'fight', 'chase', 'explosion', 'all', 'well', 'done', 'effects', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'audience', 'hardly', 'given', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'think.And', 'perspective', 'therein', 'problem', 'suspect', 'most', 'long', 'time', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fans', 'love', 'series', 'always', 'been', 'ideas', 'scrapping', 'aspect', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'taken', 'out', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'Star', 'Trek', 'appealing.It', 'hard', 'talk', 'sounding', 'pedantic', 'example', 'let', 'take', 'scientific', 'terminology', 'always', 'been', 'fair', 'amount', 'technical', 'jargon', 'Star', 'Trek', 'lexicon', 'up', 'now', 'always', 'made', 'kind', 'sense', 'been', 'part', 'carefully', 'thought', 'out', 'self-consistent', 'fictional', 'universe', 'film', 'however', 'when', 'someone', 'refers', 'device', 'everything', 'ice', 'cold', 'fusion', 'generator', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'painfully', 'weak', 'grasp', 'science', 'writers', 'have', 'also', 'how', 'far', 'Gene', 'Rodenberry', 'original', 'conception', 'franchise', 'slid.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'cast', 'dumbed-down', 'over-amped', 'approach', 'would', 'probably', 'ruin', 'film', 'However', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'rest', 'crew', 'turn', 'solid', 'energetic', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Khan', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'nostalgia', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'rendition', 'character', 'who', 'appeared', 'original', 'series', 'episode', 'Space', 'Seed', 'later', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'hectic', 'pace', 'Cumberbatch', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'craft', 'well-rounded', 'portrayal', 'magnetic', 'presence', 'screen', 'scene']",Star Trek Into Darkness

The visuals, the sound, the story, and more importantly the realism to the world of Star Trek Into Darkness.  For the most part, we have the usual characters comprised of Chris Pine as Captain James Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock (he was born to play this character) , Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and Karl Urban as Bones (hilarious). They all did great. There are new additions including a very gorgeous blonde Alice Eve as Carol Marcus. But the surprise standout performance definitely goes to Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison or for you familar Trekkies, Khan. He has the eyes, the personality, the stance, and the voice that you would want your villan to have in this movie. I expected the sequel to be just enough to be better than the 2009 remake, but Star Trek Into Darkness took what was already good in the 2009 reboot, and made an even better sequel. I am an avid sci-fi fan, and this is one for the ages in my opinion. The story line is good. After the first 30-45 mins of the movie I thought the main focus for the movie would be Kirk to prove that he is still worthy to be called Captain, but it is not. The film goes deeper than that. But in short, It is sensationally terrific.My closing remarks for this review will be: Star Wars Episode 7 is in excellent hands, and without a doubt, it will be great.

Basically, the idea is I rate and score movies from the vantage point of The Regular Dudes of the world - something I find missing in other for pay services or the so called ""movie critic"" professionals.  Frankly, who you gonna believe - some out of touch guy who gets paid per word or me, just your average dude who watches too many movies?  Hey, they may be able to claim themselves as ""experts"" but experts at what I ask you.  Now me, I just have access to hundreds and hundreds of movies across all formats and genres and a deep love of hearing myself talk... basically the only two things one might need to give an accurate view if you will, of Hollywood magic - and all conveniently laid out for you, dear Amazon review reader, in an easy to interpret format - the humble bowling score.  Furthermore, the system can be trusted because it literally has nothing to do with actual bowling (and isn't that just great for your peace of mind or POM for those into the whole brevity thing).Now while I have a sort of template I generally use when writing movie reviews when a movie is a true gem (and let me assure you, this movie IS A PURE AND TRUE GEM) I have vowed to write a completely new review.  While the review is a one of a kind, the system is not - a bowling score of 108 would be considered, eh - it was ok; while a 192 would truly be a good movie - one you might recommend to friends; now crack 200 and you've got something - and by thunder - this be one heck of a great popcorn movie.Star Trek: Into Darkness - we own the super cool 3D Blu Ray with official Starfleet phaser version (I added a picture to the `customer images') - seriously people if you don't have a 3D TV, get one - it seriously ramps up the OMG factor and why else would you watch a movie if not for the OMG factor?What's the movie about?(Ok, I am gonna try my best here to give you what you need without spoiling any of the good parts, so bear with me here.)When questionable judgment leads the crew of the Enterprise into some ""oops, did I do that?"" kind of trouble (prime directive, prime smekertive, oh, wait, you're serious) Jim Kirk loses his beloved Enterprise and is busted down to commander.  Meanwhile, there is trouble afoot when a top secret installation laying hidden in plain sight as a library is blown up in the WAY TO COOL FOR SCHOOL looking London (circa 2259) Starfleet gathers its best and brightest - only to have them blown away at the hands of the mysterious John Harrison - yup, you guessed it, the same dude responsible for blowing up the building in London town.  It's up to Kirk and crew to put an end to this renegade's shenanigans, uncover the mystery of Section 31, get a good look at J.J. Abrams version of what a Klingon looks like, and find out what the Enterprise is really made of.  WOW, trying NOT to give away anything is not as easy as it would seem.  People, there are some SERIOUS twists and turns along the way and at least one OOOH MMMY GOOODDDD moment... I had 3 of those myself, but individual results may vary.Why I loved this movie so much:&lt;> Total popcorn movie - action, adventure, comedy, good friends, tonight is kind of special sort of movie that keep me going from beginning to end - there was no `heavy, middle of the movie' type dialog quagmire - the movie just spilled from one scene to the next without slowing down&lt;> The special effects were simply put - amazing.  So often with CGI-dependent movies the action on screen comes off as cartoonish (at best) which can really negate the viewer's immersion, not the case here; I am for positive that the 3D helped out in this department as space debris littered my living room, spears whizzed by my head, and you could see to infinity (maybe even beyond) which really ramped up the feeling that you were genuinely in space&lt;> While it is this Movie Dude's opinion that The Prime Directive is simply awesome (I mean really, how many of the world's ills could have been avoided if one culture didn't try to change, covert, or otherwise ""make better, for your own good"" anyone else's culture); Gene Roddenberry was a true hero and humanitarian way back in the 60's when he created a show which featured such novel ideas as equality of the races, the abolishment of nationalism in favor of a worldview without borders, and a `hands off' to cultural conversions by way of respectful intellectual tolerance&lt;> The blending of old Star Trek mythos into a new Star Trek package... dude, you have NO IDEA how bad I want to just tell you what happens but that would be SPOILING the movie for you, trust The Movie Dude here - they did just that and they did it well&lt;> The script feature some wonderful interplay between the core characters of Kirk, Spock, and Uhura which further developed the characters in a significantly more intimate way not previously seen in any other franchise offeringWhy I didn't give the movie a perfect score:&lt;> It just missed a perfect score for a few small reasons - first, the villain in our story, while wonderfully acted by Benedict Cumberbatch (say that three times fast with crackers in your mouth), true Trekkies may stumble on the apparent `whitewashing' of the character&lt;> I may be alone in this but - ever since the Terror Attacks of 9/11, Hollywood has seemed completely and overtly obsessed with producing films which show the utter annihilation of skyscrapers, usually in some dramatic collapse - enough is enough already, move on to some other disasters will you Hollywood... will ya?Beyond that, dude, I seriously have NOTHING to complain about.  The movie had a quick pace, a solid (if slightly predictable) plot, all the action and adventure you could shake a stick at (which I can shake a stick at quite a lot), all the love interests, scandals, blowing stuff up, Star Ships battling it out, and a gratuitous scene with a blond in her underwear one Movie Dude could ask for... kudos to you Mr. Abrams, kudos to you.Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",5,Star Trek: Into Darkness Bowling for Movies Score!!,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,6846,"['Star',

My only complaint without too much of a spoiler was the death of a key person. Great film. Can't wait for the next one, this reboot is SO much better than I ever could have hoped for!Some commenters complained that I didn't give much of a review, so here is some more information: This particular film is an update on Space Seed and The Wrath of Khan but this time Khan's wrath is aimed at Admiral Marcus and Starfleet. It is also somewhat reminiscent of the novel ""Dreadnaught"" in it featured an Admiral bent upon starting a war with the Klingons and building a pure military vessel for the purpose. The movie continues to build on the story of the early growth of Kirk, his relationship with Spock and the crew, and his role as a commander. Unlike an other reviewer, I think that the casting has been fantastic, particularly Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Chekov. Cumberbatch was brilliant as Harrison/Khan. I was not thrilled with how they presented the Klingons although it is easier to see how they could have been a couple generations prior to Worf as opposed to the Klingons of TOS. Look for two special cameos (one obvious, one not so much).",5,Benedict Cumberbatch is great addition,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,1265,"['lifelong', 'Trekkie', 'Whovian', 'devotee', 'Sherlock', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'three', 'universes', 'come', 'together', 'film', 'only', 'complaint', 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'was', 'death', 'key', 'person', 'Great', 'film', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'reboot', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'commenters', 'complained', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'review', 'so', 'here', 'more', 'information', 'particular', 'film', 'update', 'Space', 'Seed', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'time', 'Khan', 'wrath', 'aimed', 'Admiral', 'Marcus', 'Starfleet', 'also', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'novel', 'Dreadnaught', 'featured', 'Admiral', 'bent', 'starting', 'war', 'Klingons', 'building', 'pure', 'military', 'vessel', 'purpose', 'movie', 'build', 'story', 'early', 'growth', 'Kirk', 'relationship', 'Spock', 'crew', 'role', 'commander', 'other', 'reviewer', 'think', 'casting', 'been', 'fantastic', 'particularly', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'McCoy', 'Chekov', 'Cumberbatch', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Harrison/Khan', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'how', 'presented', 'Klingons', 'easier', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'couple', 'generations', 'prior', 'Worf', 'opposed', 'Klingons', 'TOS', 'Look', 'two', 'special', 'cameos', 'one', 'obvious', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much']",Star Trek Into Darkness
1588521,A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B009934S5M,JWink,"[17, 26]","I will qualify my review by saying I am a huge star trek fan, having seen all the series including the cartoon series and movies and owning all of them on DVD.  With that being said, did I like the new Into Darkness movie...well, yes and no.  What I did like, the special effects were great and have continued to get better with the continuation of this new reboot.  The actors in this reboot have also done well at bringing the characters to life without straying from the original intent of the characters.  I especially think that the actors who played Bones, Chekov and Scotty did an excellent job at portraying the original series actors.  The first half of the movie plot I thought was a great way to introduce Khan as the supervillian/terrorist.But here are some of my issues with the movie and the reason why I say Yes and no to liking the movie.  I didn't like in either the first or second movie, the ongoing relationship thing with Spock and Uhura.  Call me a Trek purist or whatever, I just feel there is too much of this in the movie and doesn't really fit into Spock's character.  This half  Vulcan has too much emotion showing through at times. I can give a little on this because we are talking a young half Vulcan mind trying to deal with his emotions..but at times this is way too much.I am still not crazy about the alternate time line thing that still hasn't been dealt with in this movie either.  Unless you totally discount all the Trek lore and history, the time line has to be fixed at some point (hmm maybe in a third movie, we can hope). Also, what the heck has the elder Spock been doing in this timeline??? Just sitting retired? I think not.And finally, where the big let down occurred to me is the second half of the plot.  I had no issue reintroducing Khan in a way that surprises you and adds to the original story, but what let me down is where it strayed into nothing original but a retread of the original Wrath of Khan.  To me, the original Wrath of Khan was probably the best movie and story plot of the original series, Ricardo Monteblan, played an excellent Khan villain with some classic scenes and lines, and I will give the Cumberbatch credit, he played an excellent Khan as well and that is not where I have the issue.  Instead of going somewhere original with this version (like in the first half of the movie), Abrams goes back down the road of telling almost the same story as the original Khan, almost line for line at times, but with one big exception of switching roles between Kirk and Spock.  For those that have watched and enjoyed the Star Trek series and movies over the years, I hope that you understand where I am coming from.  The scenes that were considered classic in the original Khan movie seem less so here.  The classic scene where Spock dies saving the ship and the movie ending with you not knowing at the time Spock was going to come back or not was an emotional tug of war.  I remember at the time sitting in disbelief that they killed Spock.  This version had none of that emotion and had Kirk hopping back up like nothing had happened.I don't mind a retelling of the story, especially when you tell it as well if not better than the original but in this case, I unfortunately don't feel that way.For those that have never seen the original movies or been a fan of the series in the past and are part of the more mainstream audience then you will most likely like this story as well as any other.  I will admit as a fan of science fiction, I enjoyed the movie and is the reason for 4 stars.  But as a fan of the series, I am in an emotional tug of war.  Hmm..., almost like when I watched the original Khan.Alas, maybe Abrams has something up his sleeve for the 3rd movie in the series to make me say Aha, so that was it.  The Trekkie in me sure hopes so.  And maybe that's what Abrams intended.",4,Yes and no,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,3862,"['will', 'qualify', 'review', 'saying', 'am', 'huge', 'star', 'trek', 'fan', 'having', 'seen', 'series', 'including', 'cartoon', 'series', 'movies', 'owning', 'DVD', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'new', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'movie', 'well', 'yes', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'have', 'continued', 'get', 'better', 'continuation', 'new', 'reboot', 'actors', 'reboot', 'have', 'also', 'done', 'well', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'straying', 'original', 'intent', 'characters', 'especially', 'think', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Bones', 'Chekov', 'Scotty', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'original', 'series', 'actors', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'plot', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'Khan', 'supervillian/terrorist.But', 'here', 'are', 'issues', 'movie', 'reason', 'why', 'say', 'Yes', 'liking', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'second', 'movie', 'ongoing', 'relationship', 'thing', 'Spock', 'Uhura', 'Call', 'Trek', 'purist', 'whatever', 'just', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'Spock', 'character', 'half', 'Vulcan', 'too', 'much', 'emotion', 'showing', 'times', 'can', 'give', 'little', 'are', 'talking', 'young', 'half', 'Vulcan', 'mind', 'trying', 'deal', 'emotions..but', 'times', 'way', 'too', 'much.I', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'crazy', 'alternate', 'time', 'line', 'thing', 'still', ""n't"", 'been', 'dealt', 'movie', 'totally', 'discount', 'Trek', 'lore', 'history', 'time', 'line', 'be', 'fixed', 'point', 'hmm', 'maybe', 'third', 'movie', 'can', 'hope', 'Also', 'what', 'heck', 'elder', 'Spock', 'been', 'doing', 'timeline', 'Just', 'sitting', 'retired', 'think', 'not.And', 'finally', 'where', 'big', 'let', 'down', 'occurred', 'second', 'half', 'plot', 'had', 'issue', 'reintroducing', 'Khan', 'way', 'original', 'story', 'what', 'let', 'down', 'where', 'strayed', 'nothing', 'original', 'retread', 'original', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'original', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'story', 'plot', 'original', 'series', 'Ricardo', 'Monteblan', 'played', 'excellent', 'Khan', 'villain', 'classic', 'scenes', 'lines', 'will', 'give', 'Cumberbatch', 'credit', 'played', 'excellent', 'Khan', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'where', 'have', 'issue', 'Instead', 'going', 'somewhere', 'original', 'version', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Abrams', 'back', 'down', 'road', 'telling', 'almost', 'same', 'story', 'original', 'Khan', 'almost', 'line', 'line', 'times', 'one', 'big', 'exception', 'switching', 'roles', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'movies', 'years', 'hope', 'understand', 'where', 'am', 'coming', 'scenes', 'were', 'considered', 'classic', 'original', 'Khan', 'movie', 'seem', 'less', 'so', 'here', 'classic', 'scene', 'where', 'Spock', 'saving', 'ship', 'movie', 'ending', 'not', 'knowing', 'time', 'Spock', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'not', 'was', 'emotional', 'tug', 'war', 'remember', 'time', 'sitting', 'disbelief', 'killed', 'Spock', 'version', 'had', 'none', 'emotion', 'had', 'Kirk', 'hopping', 'back', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'retelling', 'story', 'especially', 'when', 'tell', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'better', 'original', 'case', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way.For', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'movies', 'been', 'fan', 'series', 'past', 'are', 'part', 'more', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'will', 'admit', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'fan', 'series', 'am', 'emotional', 'tug', 'war', 'Hmm', 'almost', 'when', 'watched', 'original', 'Khan.Alas', 'maybe', 'Abrams', 'something', 'up', 'sleeve', '3rd', 'movie', 'series', 'make', 'say', 'Aha', 'was', 'Trekkie', 'sure', 'so', 'maybe', 'what', 'Abrams', 'intended']",Star Trek Into Darkness
1588522,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B009934S5M,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[10, 19]","In ""The Wrath of Khan"" when the crew of the Enterprise is hunting Khan in the nebula Spock tells Kirk that Khan shows a lack of three dimensional thinking. This is the same  shortcoming of ""Star Trek: Into Darkness.""I had trepidations going to see ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" because I didn't like 2009's J.J. Abrams reboot of  Star Trek, but as I watched the first few minutes of the movie the hope of redemption crawled into my mind. That hope was soon dashed when I realized ""Into Darkness"" was a hatcheted up ""The Wrath of Khan"" with key characters taken directly from that movie, such as Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), along with key scenes taken directly from the movie and added to ""Into Darkness"" except that Abrams inverts the characters that were originally in the scene.""Into Darkness"" takes the same liberties as before and violates the parameters of the characters. Spock and Uhura are `dating' and their boyfriend-girlfriend arguments intrude like a break-up between two seventh graders that at times seemed it would be more appropriate in a movie about Star Fleet Academy the high school years. In the original Star Trek, Captain James Kirk is a man of action but displays a much more intelligent character than Chris Pine's Kirk, though it is no fault of Pine's, he's just following the script and the direction of J.J. Abrams who seems to be trying to make these movies too much his material and not that of Star Trek or Gene Roddenbury.The plot of the movie is topical. A terrorist, John Harrison, bombs a Star Fleet archive and tries to assassinate high ranking members of Star Fleet then flees to the Klingon home world of Kronos. The politics in the movie is handled more adeptly then the ham-handed way it is ""The Undiscovered Country.""There are plot inconsistencies that start to add up and become more and more of a detracting factor as the movie progresses, such as how can a person transport from Earth across the whole galaxy to the Klingon home world, but Spock can't be transported out of an active volcano with the Enterprise in much closer proximity? Or, if you can't beam a person or two aboard the Enterprise because you can't get a transporter lock on the person(s), how is it possible to beam someone right next to them?The cast is fine. Pine plays Kirk with less William Shatner's hamminess, Zachary Quinto is also makes a good Spock, Zoe Saldana is as hot as Nichelle Nichols was as Uhura and is given much more than Nichols ever was, Karl Urban nails McCoy and acts and looks enough like Deforrest Kelley that we believe his McCoy could age into Kelley's McCoy, and Anton Yelchin crosses over into caricature as a near hysterical Chekov.In an alternate universe if you went to see a science fiction movie titled ""Into Darkness"" directed by J.J. Abrams without any appellation like Star Trek on it, it would probably be an OK movie although it doesn't display the imagination needed for a stand alone movie. The whole alternate reality time line of Star Trek could be used to more imaginative effect, such as it could be used to show how the world of Star Trek turned into the world shown in the Star Trek episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" which shows a Star Fleet Empire instead of a federation, but ""Into Darkness"" has already passed that possibility by. ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" needs the imprimatur of Star Trek on it to justify the budget for the movie and to bring in the crowds to make it successful. Based on J.J. Abrams either fiddling too much with the Star Trek mythology or not understanding it, it shouldn't be called Star Trek.",3,"The Wrath of Khan Jr,",1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,3565,"['Wrath', 'Khan', 'when', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'hunting', 'Khan', 'nebula', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'Khan', 'lack', 'three', 'dimensional', 'thinking', 'same', 'shortcoming', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'had', 'trepidations', 'going', 'see', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'did', ""n't"", '2009', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'reboot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'watched', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'hope', 'redemption', 'crawled', 'mind', 'hope', 'was', 'soon', 'dashed', 'when', 'realized', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'was', 'hatcheted', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'key', 'characters', 'taken', 'directly', 'movie', 'such', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'key', 'scenes', 'taken', 'directly', 'movie', 'added', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'Abrams', 'characters', 'were', 'originally', 'scene', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'same', 'liberties', 'before', 'parameters', 'characters', 'Spock', 'Uhura', 'are', 'dating', 'boyfriend-girlfriend', 'arguments', 'intrude', 'break-up', 'two', 'seventh', 'graders', 'times', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Academy', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Captain', 'James', 'Kirk', 'man', 'action', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'character', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Kirk', 'fault', 'Pine', 'just', 'following', 'script', 'direction', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'who', 'be', 'trying', 'make', 'movies', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'not', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Gene', 'Roddenbury.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'topical', 'terrorist', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'archive', 'tries', 'assassinate', 'high', 'ranking', 'members', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'then', 'Klingon', 'home', 'world', 'Kronos', 'politics', 'movie', 'handled', 'more', 'adeptly', 'then', 'ham-handed', 'way', 'Undiscovered', 'Country', 'are', 'plot', 'inconsistencies', 'start', 'add', 'up', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'detracting', 'factor', 'movie', 'such', 'how', 'can', 'person', 'transport', 'Earth', 'whole', 'galaxy', 'Klingon', 'home', 'world', 'Spock', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'transported', 'active', 'volcano', 'Enterprise', 'much', 'closer', 'proximity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beam', 'person', 'two', 'Enterprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'transporter', 'lock', 'person', 's', 'how', 'possible', 'beam', 'someone', 'right', 'next', 'cast', 'fine', 'Pine', 'Kirk', 'less', 'William', 'Shatner', 'hamminess', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'also', 'good', 'Spock', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'as', 'hot', 'Nichelle', 'Nichols', 'was', 'Uhura', 'given', 'much', 'more', 'Nichols', 'ever', 'was', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'McCoy', 'acts', 'enough', 'Deforrest', 'Kelley', 'believe', 'McCoy', 'could', 'age', 'Kelley', 'McCoy', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'caricature', 'near', 'hysterical', 'Chekov.In', 'alternate', 'universe', 'went', 'see', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'titled', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'directed', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'appellation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'OK', 'movie', ""n't"", 'display', 'imagination', 'needed', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'whole', 'alternate', 'reality', 'time', 'line', 'Star', 'Trek', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'more', 'imaginative', 'effect', 'such', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'show', 'how', 'world', 'Star', 'Trek', 'turned', 'world', 'shown', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Empire', 'instead', 'federation', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'already', 'passed', 'possibility', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'imprimatur', 'Star', 'Trek', 'justify', 'budget', 'movie', 'bring', 'crowds', 'make', 'successful', 'Based', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'fiddling', 'too', 'much', 'Star', 'Trek', 'mythology', 'not', 'understanding', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'called', 'Star', 'Trek']",Star Trek Into Darkness

The opening sequence on the red volcano planet offers ideal examples.The Enterprise has traveled to a beautifully-designed red-foliage planet, with the simple mission of studying (but not interacting with) the primitive culture there.  A big volcano is about to erupt, however, and it will likely destroy all the people.  So, the Enterprise crew decide to stop the eruption by having Spock place a device that will freeze the magma.  Meanwhile, Kirk and Bones distract the primitives by stealing a sacred scroll and running away through a red-foliage forest, only to jump off a cliff into the ocean and swim underwater to the ship.  (Bizarrely, the Enterprise is parked under the sea.  Why they didn't leave it in space and travel by shuttle or transporter is not explained.)  Meanwhile, Spock is trapped and would rather sacrifice himself to the volcano than have the Prime Directive (not to interfere in the natural evolution of a planet) jeopardized by a rescue operation.  Nevertheless, Kirk orders a rescue attempt and the Enterprise rises from the depths and shoots toward the volcano, to the wonder of the primitives.There's so much that is illogical here, Spock would have a cow.  Obviously, there's no need for the Enterprise to be parked beneath the waves.  Clearly, there's no reason why Spock needs to personally place the volcano-freeze device -- they have sophisticated probes and torpedoes and other space-age gizmos, after all.  Certainly, there's no sense in Kirk and Bones grabbing a religious relic and causing the primitives to give chase.

Do not expect character building here. These characters are already built from the TV shows.  The movie depicts their personalities well. This movie is full of fast paced action, and if you are not a student of ST, you can get lost.  I liked the movie because I feel the character personalities are done well. This is hard to do. These are young Kirks, Spocks, Bones, Scotties and Uhurha's.  This movie exploits what we already know about them.

The result is a mindless, soulless and utterly pointless exercise in blockbuster stupidity. The plot is so idiotic it defies description, I can't and won't specify this any further or I am gonna have an aneurysm. One of the authors mentioned the great amount of social commentary STID was employing, I could find none. Not trying to be a nitpicker I could not escape noticing the giant plot holes and purposeful violations of Star Trek laws. I felt like I was watching a slapstick action comedy aimed at an audience of idiots, THIS IS NOT WHAT STAR TREK IS OR SHOULD BE! I could not find a single aspect of this picture I liked. JJ Abrams said himself that ""the fans"" were not only not his focus group, but that he even tried to make a movie not for fans but outsiders. Considering that statement, I believe he succeeded completely! And considering that very statement, can anybody please, for the love of god, explain to me why if he/they tried so hard to make something not for the fans they still felt compelled to include Khan, eugenics, Tribbles and basically ever other major plot line from Star Trek - the Warth of Khan into this picture? What am I expected to think about people that tell me that what I love is so lame it needs to be reinvented completely and then serve me a complete rehash even down to identical dialogue lines as a result? The only reason for that is that I, as a fan, are considered as being stupid. But hey, far from me to say anything against a movie that garners an 8+ rating on IMDB! All the more evidence that this film is aimed at a completely different target audience. Furthermore, the look of the film is reminiscent of a computer operating system, the sound effects were embarassing, the pacing was moronic, all the actors degraded to puppets of a braindead script and even the films pseudo-emotional climax was robbed of its impact by a clear setup-resolve scene early in the movie that serves no other logical purpose to reverse plot elements that occur later. Screenwriting for complete jerks!As someone who has been watching ST for 25 years now I honestly feel like it may be best for me to just keep buying the great Blu Ray releases of the ST television series (all of them!) and stop right there. I even bought this movie in used condition because I couldn't bring myself to support what is being done to something I love so much. I dare ANYONE to honestly tell me that this CRAP is superior to what was done in ST both in TV and cinema before the reboot idea occured, I loathe these last two films and can only wish that this does not keep going on. Star Trek is such a great phenomenon and it sure as hell does not deserve this incredibly idiotic treatment any longer. Please, make it stop! One thing though I am really sure of: ST-The Wrath of Khan is 31 years old as of the writing of this review.

1588577,AZD18Z3FWGAKY,B009934S5M,Kevin,"[3, 5]","First, let me begin by simply stating that this is a fantastic movie featuring a well-paced and authentic screenplay that takes advantages of the best audio and video production available.The movie features a new villain, new in the sense those who watch the first movie (2009) have not met him before as well as introduces a number of characters and races we know in ways that are believable and fun. While at times the movie is predictable, the film includes some twists and turns that keep you enjoying the entire ride. While some fan favorites may not feature as central a role as one would hope, the characters all play an important role in making this a believable environment. For those with families, this would probably be good for anyone 10-12 years old or older. The movie features some lingerie (well, ""sexy"" underwear) and a few instances of profanity (s word being the worst). Obviously whether this movie is appropriate would depend on your family, but my personal opinion would be as stated above.The audio in the movie is fantastic and features strong low frequency extensions (aka will make your subwoofer work) when ships go to warp and other events occur which I won't spoil for you. The highs are warm and vibrant and not shrill or harsh. The sound field envelopes you a few times in a full 360 experience for those with surround sound, with phasers firing, characters talking and action occurring on all sides. Overall, the Dolby HD track on the Blu-Ray would be considered a reference quality audio that is perfect to show off a home theater or to marvel at with your family. This is engaging and purposeful sound that truly transforms the experience.The video is sharp and crisp, in beautiful 1080p (Blu-Ray version) with saturated colors where appropriate. The film benefits from a larger screen as you can get more details and can truly appreciate the scale and work that was put into this, but any device will do. There is a little bit of film grain (the little speckles on the picture) which is really only noticeable if looking for it on the darker scenes and in some of the fog like effects. Throughout the film, the camera is very close to the characters, showing detail and color, but can get a bit much if the constant camera motion bothers you. CGI was well done, and never appeared ""fake"", all of it blended well and felt like part of the set. For some viewers, you may want to watch this at night, or in a room that you can control the light as the sunlight on the TV may wash out some of the blacks, causing you to miss some of the detail that can be found in the dark colors and the blacks.Overall, this film is a wonderful experience. It will stimulate all of your movie-goer senses (auditory, visual, and touch if you have a subwoofer). The script is well written, nicely paced, and albeit predictable at times, wholly enjoyable. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi, Action, and great character interaction.",5,Well Paced Action with Believable Character Interaction,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,2975,"['First', 'let', 'begin', 'simply', 'stating', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'featuring', 'well-paced', 'authentic', 'screenplay', 'advantages', 'best', 'audio', 'video', 'production', 'available.The', 'movie', 'new', 'villain', 'new', 'sense', 'who', 'watch', 'first', 'movie', '2009', 'have', 'not', 'met', 'as', 'well', 'introduces', 'number', 'characters', 'know', 'ways', 'are', 'believable', 'fun', 'times', 'movie', 'predictable', 'film', 'twists', 'keep', 'enjoying', 'entire', 'ride', 'fan', 'favorites', 'may', 'not', 'feature', 'central', 'role', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'characters', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'making', 'believable', 'environment', 'families', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'good', 'anyone', '10-12', 'years', 'old', 'older', 'movie', 'lingerie', 'well', 'sexy', 'underwear', 'few', 'instances', 'profanity', 's', 'word', 'being', 'worst', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'would', 'depend', 'family', 'personal', 'opinion', 'would', 'be', 'stated', 'above.The', 'audio', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'strong', 'low', 'frequency', 'extensions', 'aka', 'will', 'make', 'subwoofer', 'work', 'when', 'ships', 'go', 'warp', 'other', 'events', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'highs', 'are', 'warm', 'vibrant', 'not', 'shrill', 'harsh', 'sound', 'field', 'few', 'times', 'full', '360', 'experience', 'surround', 'sound', 'phasers', 'firing', 'characters', 'talking', 'action', 'occurring', 'sides', 'Overall', 'Dolby', 'HD', 'track', 'Blu-Ray', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'reference', 'quality', 'audio', 'perfect', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'marvel', 'family', 'engaging', 'purposeful', 'sound', 'truly', 'experience.The', 'video', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'beautiful', '1080p', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'saturated', 'colors', 'where', 'appropriate', 'film', 'benefits', 'larger', 'screen', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'details', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'scale', 'work', 'was', 'put', 'device', 'will', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'film', 'grain', 'little', 'speckles', 'picture', 'really', 'only', 'noticeable', 'looking', 'darker', 'scenes', 'fog', 'effects', 'film', 'camera', 'very', 'close', 'characters', 'showing', 'detail', 'color', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'much', 'constant', 'camera', 'motion', 'bothers', 'CGI', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'never', 'appeared', 'fake', 'blended', 'well', 'felt', 'part', 'set', 'viewers', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'night', 'room', 'can', 'control', 'light', 'sunlight', 'TV', 'may', 'wash', 'out', 'blacks', 'causing', 'miss', 'detail', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'dark', 'colors', 'blacks.Overall', 'film', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'will', 'stimulate', 'movie-goer', 'senses', 'auditory', 'visual', 'touch', 'have', 'subwoofer', 'script', 'well', 'written', 'nicely', 'paced', 'predictable', 'times', 'wholly', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'Sci-Fi', 'Action', 'great', 'character', 'interaction']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1588580,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B009934S5M,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[8, 13]","For starters I think it is necessary to say that I will probably insult a few people in this review, horrify others, and hopefully make one or two people laugh.  This review will contain a spoiler or two (I'll try to keep them vague).  It will also most likely draw the ire of a few people who think I am off my rocker when it comes to my opinion of the film and of Star Trek in general.  Just know that I do really enjoy the original series and most of the films that it spawned as well as many of the spin-off shows and books.  My review will be written from the heart, tongue firmly in cheek, and with no ill will toward anyone.And so begins my review that CONTAINS SPOILERS.  ""Shields up, Prairie Cajun!""I walked into the theater a couple of weeks ago with my daughter in tow.  As much as I love Doctor Who and Star Wars, her passion burns just as brightly for Star Trek.  She loves the original series and ST:TNG, and is especially fond of Spock, Bones, Data, and Captain Picard.  I didn't plan on seeing Star Trek Into Darkness until it had been out for awhile, but she insisted on seeing it as soon as possible.  We saw it in 3-D and by the end of the film, the rebooted crew of the Enterprise had once again impressed me and solidified her love of the franchise.As the film began, I felt a great disturbance in the Force.  It was as if millions of Trekkies witnessed J.J. Abrams dash the Prime Directive on the rocks of his Star Wars-infused childhood.  The crew of the Enterprise was actually trying to save a race of primitives on a planet that was about to go belly up via a volcano.  Instead of letting nature take its course, Kirk and company literally freeze the destruction of the primitives, expose themselves and the Enterprise to the people (which leads to a new idol for the primitives to worship), and also endangers the life of Spock.  Naturally this gets Kirk into a whole heap of trouble with Admiral Pike, but in true Trek fashion, Kirk manages to skirt any real punishment and is put under the command of Pike who is given back the helm of the Enterprise.Meanwhile, a dark and mysterious figure begins manipulating a poor fellow who is a part of Starfleet.  Whovians will recognize him as Mickey (Noel Clark) from the new Doctor Who era.  This leads to the destruction of a Starfleet archive, which leads to all of the head honchos (including Kirk and Spock, naturally) gathering in one place, which makes it ever-so-easy for the mysterious figure to attack and nearly wipeout all of the biggest members of Starfleet in one fell swoop.  Kirk and Spock are two of the survivors, obviously.  Kirk is basically given the green light to find and destroy the mysterious guy at any and all costs.  Spock follows his lead, but only after making it very clear that he disagrees with the actions of Kirk and of a certain high-ranking official in Starfleet.  To top it all off, Scotty quits, refusing to have any hand in the militarization of the Enterprise in order for it to catch its prey.From that point on, more people are manipulated, orders are questioned, and an old enemy from the original series reveals himself to maybe/maybe not be the villain behind all of the bad things that are happening to Kirk and the rest of Starfleet.I could literally hear the wailing and gnashing of Trekkie teeth while watching this film.  Abrams not only revives an old and beloved villain, he makes him likeable!  He makes this villain work WITH Kirk and then backstab him all within a few minutes of the film!  I was actually pulling for the ""villain"" a lot of the time, and to top it all off, Abrams takes a pivotal scene from the most beloved film in the entirety of Star Trek and reverses the roles of its two key members!  He then goes on to take a popular line uttered by one of those said members in Star Trek II, places it within the scene, and has the other person say it!!  Oh, the horror, the outrage!!!!Once again I felt a disturbance in the Force!  It was as if Abrams had evacuated his bowels all over the memories of the high and mighty Trek.  Children were weeping!  Women were screaming!  Cats and dogs were living together!  I literally had friends who got rid of any and everything associated with Abrams' rebooted Trek.  Others were so upset with what had happened to their beloved franchise that they were turning to ""lesser"" franchises like Firefly and, dare I say it, Babylon 5, for comfort!And then it hit me.Abrams is brilliant.  He took a franchise that is so loved by its fans and made them see it for what it really is....another space opera.  I've always held the belief that Trekkies placed Trek on a pedestal far taller than it deserved to be upon.  Don't get me wrong.  I've taken my love of Star Wars and Doctor Who to places it has no business being, but Trekkies always managed to take their love just a bit farther and for that, I love them.  I believe that they are so very passionate about their franchise that they forget that the original Trek had its share of cheese, objectification of women, bad acting, and more often than once the Prime Directive was violated.  Kirk was a cowboy in space.  Spock was supposed to be his anchor of logic and Bones the unbridled passion.  When the two combined, they made Kirk a better person.  That, at least to me, is the core of Trek.  It really wasn't until The Next Generation that politics, social issues, etc. came to the forefront of the franchise.  The original series had its moments, but in the end it was meant to be entertaining, and I do believe Abrams has succeeded in doing that with the franchise.  Heck, if you dig deep enough, you'll see that Abrams does manage to touch on modern issues like terrorism and the abuse of power.  He does all of this with lots of bang and zip, which is, quite frankly, something that TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise often lacked.Now, I am by no means a Star Trek wizard.  My opinion is based purely on what I've read and watched over the years.  I'm sure there are fans of Trek reading my words right now and laughing out loud, possibly calling me an idiot, and I'm okay with that.  I've been a nerd for the entirety of my life and can handle name calling and other forms of verbal abuse.With all of that out of the way, I'll briefly state that the production values in this film were top notch.  I expected nothing less from Abrams and his gang.  The story is fast-paced, well written, and enjoyable to see unfold on the screen.  The few extra bucks for 3-D are entirely worth it.  All of the returning cast did excellent jobs, especially Karl Urban and Chris Pine.  Peter Weller was solid in his role and Benedict Cumberbatch owned the screen any time he was on it (even when he wasn't speaking).  Alice Eve wasn't too shabby, either.I really enjoyed this flick.  I'll buy it when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray.  I highly recommend it, even to hardcore Trekkies.  You'll scream and tear your flesh, but in the end you will enjoy this film.""Drop shields, Prairie Cajun.""",4,"""Shields Up!""",1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,7010,"['starters', 'think', 'necessary',

1588583,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009934S5M,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 21]","The Star Trek franchise is still going strong and shows no visible signs of relenting. I am constantly critical of the lack of new ideas prevalent in the Hollywood movie making machine. Studios keep cranking out sequels, remakes, and reimaginings of anything with a familiar name. And for the most part, these movies are more about a brand than artfulness. Let's not offend anyone, let's not challenge anyone, let's give them exactly what they expect. It all gets so tedious. There is no surprise and oftentimes no fun. Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of Star Trek. I never faithfully watched any of the TV programs and, although I've seen them all, I only really liked about half of the movies. When I heard that J.J. Abrams was planning yet another reboot, it didn't really get my juices flowing. But his ""Star Trek"" prequel from 2009 was a very pleasant surprise. It had adventure, it had comedy, and it skillfully played with the beloved characters as it was bringing them together for the first time. It struck such a perfect balance, it was a blockbuster that you didn't have to be ashamed of because it was actually good! Because of this, I went into ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" with considerably higher expectations. Abrams has scored again. Although with a darker tone, the end product doesn't always feel like the Star Trek you've come to know and love.""Star Trek Into Darkness"" picks up in the aftermath of events from the first movie. In this way, it is still a prequel to the events of the original television program. The cast has been separated and it will take a truly devastating act to bring them back together again. That is easily and vividly enacted by an enigmatic villain played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch, seemingly with superhuman strength and a secret agenda, seems to be targeting Starfleet Command with acts of terrorism. One such act strikes very close to Kirk (Chris Pine) which sets up the primary plot of tracking down and destroying this madman. The mission is personal, so Kirk uses his influence to reassemble the old bunch. With Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhuru (Zoe Saldana), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu (John Cho), McCoy (Karl Urban), and Checkov (Anton Yelchin) on hand, it's business as usual. Also along fro the ride is Alice Eve as Dr. Carol Marcus. At first her presence is questioned, but she soon becomes a vital part of the adventure. As the team get closer to Cumberbatch, the movie morphs into a morality play of sorts. What if a villain is justified? As the truth of Cumberbatch's identity comes into focus, his attacks might just seem warranted.But I'm not going to spoil anything. I really enjoyed how that film played with classic Star Trek lore and presented it in new and exciting ways. You don't realize until midway through just how clever and intricate the screenplay is and that is, perhaps, the greatest success of this iteration of Star Trek. As I mentioned, the tone of the movie is noticeably darker than some of the other genre entries. It deals with complex issues and ethical debates. But the action is also unrelenting. There are still the requisite laughs, but this plays much more seriously. What's at stake here seems very real. I know that not everyone loved this interpretation, but I appreciated the ambition and willingness to take things to a whole new level. Adding to the dramatic heft are great supporting turns by Bruce Greenwood (Pike) and Peter Weller (Marcus) who push the emotional resonance of the piece.Much of the early part of ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" once again, details the evolving relationship between Kirk and Spock. Pine and Quinto are perfect foils and are generally my favorite part of this new series. The other characters each get a moment to shine, but this pairing makes up the heart of ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" I could also go on, at length (as if this isn't lengthy enough), about the technical merits of the film. Great effects, music, cinematography, visual design all really set this apart. At the end of the day, though, the thing that really distinguishes this film (in my estimation) is Cumberbatch. Acting with almost Shakespearean gravity, he is absolutely mesmerizing. I want to talk about his character, but I will refrain as it might present unnecessary spoilers. Let's just say he is memorable and very significant to the Star Trek world. In the end, Abrams scores with a entertaining blockbuster that also has something on its mind. Smarter than you might expect, this is a blockbuster to remember. About 4 1/2 stars.

1588589,A1KELU76GK578O,B009934S5M,"Kim M. Brantley ""BTheFuture""","[2, 4]","Star Trek Into Darkness is a very exciting revamp of the Star Trek films, and a worthy sequel to the 2009 Star Trek.  Great pains were taken to match the current actors' likenesses to the previous actors' likenesses -- with the exception of Khan, of course, but more about that in a moment.What I loved about the film is the finely tuned character web.  All of the characters of the Star Trek series are well known, which leaves the dilemma of how to successfully give each of them enough onscreen time to develop their characters.  In Into Darkness, all of the crew members' roles were not only essential but virtually interchangeable.  They moved from task to task, position to position seamlessly, setting up the theme that the crew members are as family.I felt that the way the women were portrayed in the film could have been worked on a lot more.  Uhura and Carol had their share of onscreen time, but they did not really cause much action to occur.  I was also disappointed, still, by the heiny-hugging mini dresses and the gratuitous bra-n'-panty flashes that are a rote part of today's action films.  I mean, this is set in the 24th century.  Get with it!I also loved the big sets and fast-paced action scenes.  As a woman, I sometimes feel uninspired with respect to how the concept of war is approached in film.  Into Darkness however left me chewing my fingernails to the stubs, particularly during the confrontation between Kirk and his unconscious &#34;id&#34;, Admiral Marcus.  Marcus was the top-tier villain over Kahn, having been constructed out of Kirk's very conscious need for domination and control.Which brings me to what I felt was one of the more glaring flaws in this film.  I felt that Kirk was a product of what I'll refer to as &#34;Life in the Bubble.&#34;  He only sees things his way and mostly expects everyone else to see things his way as well.  Kirk seems to barrel forward fueled by his own impetus and self-interest -- clearly not qualities befitting a Star Fleet captain.  This makes it difficult to identify with Kirk.  He is getting away with murder... and being rewarded for it.  The only redeeming element is when Kirk's senior officer, Admiral Pike, chews him out over lying to his superiors and delivers the bad news that command of the Enterprise has been taken away from him.I felt it difficult to feel a sense of loss over Kirk, even in light of the sacrifice he made for his crew, largely because in the film he is dictating that loss to the audience by delivering his own eulogy -- a task that should have been left to Mr. Spock, who was actually experiencing the loss of his friend.There is another disturbing theme in this film, that of the de-evolution of mankind being viewed as the future of mankind.  This theme is set up in the 2009 Star Trek when Vulcan -- a planet of inhabitants who believe they have evolved beyond the outward emotional trappings of, say, Earthlings -- is destroyed.  Why would the writers/directors of this long-running series go to such lengths to design as unique a character as Mr. Spock only to sacrifice him to the Cro-Magnon mentality of today's action flicks?  Why must he, too, become a fist-pounding brute in order to justify the paradigm of savagery and war outlined by the Enterprise's prisoner, Khan?Which brings me to Khan.  For all of those who chose to focus on the ethnicity of the actor who portrayed Khan, you'll probably want to leave now.  I too was left momentarily confused at the depiction of a light-complected, blue-eyed, supposedly Asian man in the role of Khan, but the actor's portrayal of the villain rose above all of the other characters in the film -- and above all of the negative banter.Khan's initial actions seem heartless and blood thirsty... until he has the opportunity to speak.  This Khan embodied the often imposed-upon identity of being the &#34;other man,&#34; the one who is &#34;not one of us,&#34; the one who &#34;doesn't belong.&#34;Khan, from his recitation, is awoken from a three-hundred-year cryogenic sleep at the command of Admiral Marcus -- the most senior officer of all of Star Fleet.  The rest of Khan's crew mates languish in stasis.  Khan reveals that he is of a race of genetically-engineered beings purposed with restoring peace at a time of war.  Khan is enrolled by Admiral Marcus in the belief that all civilized life is under threat of extermination by &#34;the enemy,&#34; the Klingons, and that if he does not assist him in building warships and weapons, he and his crew will perish as well.As Khan realizes that Admiral Marcus' intentions are focused more upon his own self-aggrandizement and less on the protection of the universe, he attempts to defect.  Admiral Marcus threatens the lives of Khan's crew, and Khan is forced to secrete his few remaining crew mates' cryogenic containers within the fuselage compartments of the long-range torpedoes he helped design.This revelation of events and the subsequent act of desperation is delivered with such emotional depth that it nearly becomes impossible to realign the audience with concern over the plight of the Enterprise and its crew.  Even a cameo by the original Spock, the venerable Leonard Nimoy, cannot help.  The antagonist arguably becomes the hero, in light of the avalanche of disreputable deeds committed by the Star Fleet envoy, and the audience is left wanting to see more of this character.Even Khan's final act of vengeance, where he instructs the disabled dreadnought Vengeance to crash land on Star Fleet headquarters, thereby killing as many of the little devils as possible, evoked a round of sinister giggles from me, as Kirk, and Star Fleet's, integrity (through Admiral Marcus), was damaged at that point beyond repair.Although the final battle scene between Khan and Spock is extremely exciting, as well as relevant in ending the threat imposed by Khan, and although by and large the performance by all of the characters in the film is superb, I just felt little sense of triumph, let alone closure.At the end of Star Trek Into Darkness, Kirk, after having been revived from the dead via a transfusion of Khan's stolen &#34;super&#34; blood, delivers the final epilog, making the story appear to be all neatly tied up at the end.  But not quite.  Not quite.",4,"Loved the film, but...",1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,6282,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'very', 'exciting', 'revamp', 'Star', 'Trek', 'films', 'worthy', 'sequel', '2009',

1588598,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B009934S5M,King of Controversy,"[3, 7]","The title Star Trek Into Darkness is misleading. The trailer, too, leads one to believe this is a tale of revenge. And this film features Khan. The film Star Trek II is dedicated to Khan Noonien Singh's obsession with revenge. In one scene, released to the public before the movies premier, Captain Pike tells Captain Kirk something like, ""The Federation isn't about personal vendettas"". Captain Kirk replies, ""Maybe it should be"".Instead what Captain Kirk learns, pretty much on his own, perhaps as a continuation of the end of the first film Star Trek 2009, is that justice is not about revenge. Human life isn't his to take. At least not in cold blood. Leonard Nimoy appears again in this film and he also provides a firm sense of moral grounding. Nimoy's performance here is not solely about bringing Vulcan sensibilities to the part? Surely we are seeing something of the real Leonard Nimoy in his performance. Nimoy would title his second autobiography, ""I am Spock"". The apparent moral certainty Nimoy helps bring to the film feels real, probably because it is. In the previous film, the Romulan Captain Nero destroys Spock's home world, in a quest for revenge of a sort. All the elder Spock can say about Nero, after pausing to think about it, is that Nero is 'troubled' as if he's concerned about Nero. The ending of this film, at least Kirk's medical recovery, leads one to wonder if perhaps Khan might return.We also learn that friendship is more important than truth. For Spock, who cannot tell a lie, this is something he will learn, or be corrupted by, over a lifetimes worth of experience. When captain Kirk falsifies a report to Star Fleet, I was kind of hoping the lesson to be learned would be one about the importance of being truthful, but instead we're learning about the importance of friendship. And also that friends believe different things than we do and sometimes live in different ways than we do, but we should still be committed to them. It's what gives life meaning?In a Star Trek episode from the original series, 'The Enterprise Incident', Spock does lie, convincing a Roluman Captain that he's defecting from Star Fleet. He's actually on a spy mission. He uses the fact that it's known Vulcan's cannot lie against this female captain. When she discovers the deception, Spock confesses that, ""I was not unmoved"" by this woman's advances. In one of the more famous episodes from the original serious, 'Mirror, Mirror' the crew are errantly beamed aboard an Enterprise that exists in an alternate universe. One where the Federation is an 'Empire' that rules by maintaining terror. When captain Kirk is talking to his concubine on the evil ship, a woman who's figured out something is wrong, captain Kirk tells her, ""you're the captains woman until he says you're not"". He plans on finding his way back to his own Enterprise.As other reviewers have noted, this film sails closer to Gene Roddenberry's 'humanistic vision'. Whether it's been made under the influence of Roddenberry or not, this film has a proverbial heart.I agree with this view, however, a small minority of Star Trek fans have claimed that the original series was all about Captain Kirk. Even that Kirk represented the antithesis of humanism. That each week, Captain Kirk would outsmart the counter-culture figures on the show, presented in the guise of aliens or rogue factions of the Federation, correct the error of their ways, and sometime before or after bed their women. Perhaps it's about those in the Federation, reactionaries and the educated, artists and scientists, uniting and coming together over common cause. Or more likely still, it is about friendship. As Star Trek moved to the series Next Generation, and Gene Roddenberry presumably held more control over the Star Trek, it did become more cerebral. In the ensuing generations it's returned to being more about action, even more so than the original incarnation, and that trend has continued here in Into Darkness.Anyway, I think I enjoyed the first film more, Star Trek 2009. Perhaps it was the joy of seeing these characters in action once again, because that movie had a, pardon the phrase, illogical plot. In the 2009 film there's more dialog between the crew members. This new film has a heart. I'd feel more comfortable recommending it, I think.",4,Closer to Gene Roddenberry's original vision?

I still think Wrath Of Khan is the best Trek film to date, mainly due to the rich Corinthian leather (smile if you remember those '70s ads!), but STID is a very respectable entry into the ever-expanding Trek universe.Pine and Quinto make a great pair, and Urban and Pegg's silliness works pretty well. The Vulcan love subplot is a tad goofy and unreal but then so is everything in the Trekverse, so why worry? The script has some good laughs, some solid action, and a few interesting concepts, though I for one would like more of the latter next time out. It's the mind-bending ideas that made the best Trek episodes work, and Abrams should seek to get more of them in next time around. This world is so rich in possibility it seems a shame not to play that side of it to the hilt.As for the ripoff marketing of this film, all I can say is we'll keep getting more and more of that as long as we put up with it, so stand up and simply DON'T BUY ANY OF IT! They only do it because they know so many Trekkies are serious collectors. If you don't buy all their versions maybe they'll get the message.Or just do what we do and rent these for half a buck at your local rental box with a monthly membership, or one night rental for a buck at the kiosk. That's all the cash they'll get from me!All in all, this is a good Trek entry and this cast looks set to give us quite a good run of fun films.

The actors are all good too in their roles, playing a range of emotions and styles from silly comedy to intense action and tragedy. So on its own merits, it's certainly a quality action movie with a few amazing sequences of outer space derring-do.However, what's sorely lacking from this installment is any sense of intelligence or philosophy that always infused the &#34;Star Trek&#34; franchise. Now, personally, I am not a Trekkie, but have seen the shows as a kid and watched most of the films. And &#34;Star Trek&#34; was always partially defined by its loftier ambitions, a sense of adventurous exploration that infused fun action with smart ideas on heady topics.This movie does not have any of that. It simply jumps from one explosion to the next, which are still amazing to gawk at. But the actual plot is quite dumb. It tries to sneakily move from one twist to another, but really cannot exist by its own warped logic. Why the bad guys do what they do, it simply doesn't make sense. So besides its general lack of intellect, the story proper is very weak.At the end of the ride though, the general production, big-budget effects and zippy pace were still good enough for me to enjoy the experience. Also, I can see how old-school fans might be bothered by some of the liberties this film takes in retooling the lore.The new Trek is bigger, louder, cooler and sleeker than ever.

How about a new idea, A new race, A new enemy. The enemy does not have to always be a single person, as it usually is, but could be a race or a planet.... anyway...  2. Chekov is not chief engineer material, never was. The replacement for Scotty should have been from engineering, I don't care if it was an unknown member of the crew. The recruitment of Chekov made no sense.

1588683,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B009934S5M,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[11, 17]","J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8) hit this one out of the park because Star Trek (2009) was an amazingly good character driven and origin story film filled with good drama, some comedy and some action, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is literally a visual roller coaster of action and fun. The 3D is effective in this film and more importantly the action and suspense does not stop at all.  Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (both on Transformers and Fringe), along with Damon Lindelof (Prometheus, Lost) to the story to the next level and the stakes are much higher in this film - literally.Watching this film was also an experience of audience participation with cheers, tears, fears, applause and even ""oooo's"" and ""ahhhhs"" and tons of laughter, laughter and hysterics throughout most of movie! What I really liked about the movie is that once again it took the original series concepts and turned them upside down and twisted them and made them fresh. Some familiar and yet not familiar moments do occur and you have to see it to understand what I mean.What also received a warm applause at the end of the film from the entire audience was a proud dedication the filmmakers give to the ""...Post 9/11 Veterans..."", giving them thanks and praise for their past and present service at home and abroad.Chris Pine (Rise of the Guardians, This Means War) does the comedy just as well as he does the drama and his passion for the role is clear with his wild James T. Kirk agenda, which often isn't exactly what Starfleet would approve. Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Margin Call) does an incredible Spock once again. His passionless persona is passion-ful and his commitment to subtlety conveying meaning without saying a word is amazing. The chemistry between Chris and Zach is blissfully apparent on screen and their compassion for each other as Starfleet officers is fully developed in this filmKarl Urban (Dred, Bourne Supremacy) is the cantankerous ""Bones"" McCoy and Karl is having an amazing time with this in this film. His charm is burning through his bitterness and sarcasm throughout the film. Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Columbiana) as Uhura really gets to shine in this film as her relationship with Spock is tested and it happens in some very funny scenes between their domestic arguments they have. (And they have them in front of Kirk!)I waited till now to discuss the story and I don't want to give any spoilers away, but the plot centers around why the film was dedicated to who it was dedicated to in the first place. Benedict Cumberbatch (Warhorse, Sherlock) plays a villain that would rival most villains. Mean, sadistic, relentless and extremely intelligent - all the elements you do not want a madman to have, and he has got them in spades! He is a terrorist who affects Kirk in a very personal way that causes Kirk to make his entire mission to get Benedicts' character. (And I am avoiding his name for a reason!) It's a real terrorist story.Did I mention that Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) playing Chief Engineer Scott is one of the funniest things you'll ever see on screen in this film? Even when he resigns? (Oooops, tiny spoiler - or maybe not, you'll see.) John Cho (American Beauty, Harold & Kumar) has an amazing moment of power when he gets an unexpected upgrade and John plays it to the hilt and even has a moment that impresses himself quite a bit! The one who has the least amount to do, yet some very funny moments and one truly heroic moment, is Anton Yelchin (Fright Night, Terminator Salvation) as Chekov. He literally fixes and saves and fixes and saves...you have to see it for yourself.Another brilliant performance by the father-figure Bruce Greenwood (I,Robot, DejaVu) as Captain Pike, sole `cheerleader' for Captain Kirk and all his troublesome antics. Bruce and Chris also have amazing chemistry as the surrogate father and son relationship that they have developed. And joining the cast this time around is Alice Eve (Men In Balck III, The Raven) as Carol Marcus, a specialist in a field that defiantly helps in the hunt for Benedict's character, as well as unexpectedly helping Benedict as well.Now ad an Admiral with a mission and a twist (or two or three) that will very much surprise you and you have you wondering at all times, is Peter Weller (Robocop, Buckaroo Bonzai) adding to the mix of extremely high energy and fast pace.And there is a really big surprise too! Everyone is back and in full form and full force and this is definitely a candy film for the soul. Take the drama and passion of the first film, sprinkle in some suspense, plot twists, a double extra helping of humor and scene by scene action on top of action on top of action on top of action, and you have ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" A film that will literally have something  for everyone, of all ages, to enjoy and you will definitely `feel' much better leaving the theatre then when you came in! As Spock always says, Live Long and Prosper!",5,"""Star Trek Into Darkness Is Action, Humor, Passion And It's Non-Stop!""",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,4943,"['J.J.', 'Abrams', 'Lost', 'Super', '8',

1588696,A1QVD9K16N5RQ2,B009934S5M,L. S. Tucker,"[2, 3]","Let's start at the beginning.  First, there WILL be spoilers here, so if you haven't seen the film as yet, back away from the review.  Second, I'm a fan of Star Trek since the Original Series first aired (yes, I am that old).  Third, The Wrath of Khan has always been my favorite Star Trek film ever.Did I enjoy it? Most definitely. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love once again with the gorgeous basso profundo voice of Benedict Cumberbatch (who I really, REALLY hope will read Edgar Allan Poe someday).Did I think it was the greatest thing since the reboot? Sorry to say, but I didn't. It was a good film, although perhaps pandering a bit too much to those of us from the old days with Dr. Carol Marcus and mention of Christine Chapel.The biggest problem for me is Midshipman James T. Kirk being promoted to Commander, captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, without any stops or real training along the way. It jarred in the first film and hasn't gotten any better with this one. They did, sorta, address why that is a problem, but then it was pushed aside as if it didn't matter anymore because we have a ""crisis"". Admittedly, we soon see why the Admiral was willing to go along with it, not for the good of the service, but for his own personal agenda. He basically hoped he could use Kirk's renowned hotheadedness to achieve his own personal motives.I did like the comparison of Khan's loyalty to his crew to Kirk's own loyalty. Both men will break any rules to save their family, that same crew. And I'm not entirely certain their methods to achieve that end would be all that different, although the Kirk we know does have some limits in regards to hurting innocents.To be honest, once I left the theater and began thinking, I realized that the plot was a mess. Not only wasn't it logical, it didn't make sense (not always the same thing). Khan and his crew were engineered to bring peace, but were then deep-frozen as war criminals (why not just execute them?). Khan is defrosted, forced to make weapons of war for the Admiral who uses Khan's crew members as leverage. And despite being better and smarter than anyone, must less a war happy Star Fleet officer, Khan seemed to have no choice but to do the Admiral's bidding. Except he decides to, instead, blow up a top-secret facility, uses it as a way to gather all of top officers in one location (and they sure don't have many ships in Star Fleet, do they?) in order to kill the lot of them, and then flee to the Klingon sector. Explain to me exactly how that was supposed to save Khan's crew?THEN, instead of allowing the Klingons to kill Uhura, Kirk and Spock, Khan rescues them by killing all the Klingons. Okay, I totally get why he surrendered. Once he heard how many torpedoes Kirk had, it was obvious they were his people. I give up. Trying to figure out this plot is giving me a headache.I didn't notice, but I hope they gave the writers of The Wrath of Khan some credit for directly taking scenes and lines from the original film. I really thought going with that end scene was unnecessary, but I won't say that I didn't find myself crying just a bit with the ever excellent Zachary Quinto, even if I was saying from the moment Kirk went into the radiation chamber, ""use Khan's blood"". Speaking of which, what the hell did McCoy do with that whole tube of blood? Tests shouldn't have taken that much of it, nor would bringing a tribble back to life.Was the conversation with old Spock really needed? Other than giving the fans another look at a Leonard Nimoy version of Spock, it didn't seem to hold much purpose for the film's development.All the actors did a great job with what they were given to work with, but I wish it had been a tighter script. We did get some moments between characters, but I feel like everything was rushed. I had read their tweets while the film was being done and they (Quinto, Cumberbatch, Pine, Urban, and Pegg) all appeared to get along quite well. I should also mention that I was thrilled to see Noel Clarke playing Harewood. For those who don't know, he played Mickey in Doctor Who. I also spotted Scott Lawrence in the film, just one scene surprisingly enough. Fans of JAG will remember him as Commander Sturgis Turner.The special effects were great. We've come a long way over the last 50 years, no real complaints there. I wouldn't say that the story was overwhelmed by the effects, so kudos to the crew for not making that mistake. However, I'm not so certain that the level of violence was as needed to make the point that Khan was this terrible, horrible, not very nice man.Personally, I think that Star Fleet could've given the same sort of choice to this Khan and his people as they did to the ones from the original series, a home of their own. Hopefully on a planet that didn't go belly up like the one from the later film.Letting Kirk lead the 5 year mission after he has made it quite clear that he cannot be trusted to obey the rules, particularly the Prime Directive? As John Watson would've said, a bit not good. Oh, and Kirk? Your record for not losing anyone in your crew sure got shot to hell and back with this one!I would probably give the movie a B+. It was an adventure, fun and easy to watch, as long as you didn't look too closely behind the curtain.",4,Benedict and Zachary Make the Film,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,5274,"['Let', 'start',

I like special effects as much as the next person, but that is not enough to hold my attention. I want to hear a story. You can only watch so many space ships explode and men flying through space until it become predictable - nothing special anymore.

But there's nothing original or interesting here.Look, we're already saddled with characters who we've now known for close to 50 years. We know none of them is ever going to die or be in any real danger. That's a pretty big eight ball to be behind in trying to develop stories for what's essentially a space western. So why compound the problem by reintroducing guest characters from earlier Star Trek fare? Do we really need to see Khan in this movie as the evil protagonist? Couldn't they come up with something or somebody else? You know, something NEW?And the basic crew of the USS Enterprise are morphing into superheroes. The fight sequence between Spock and Khan is absolutely cartoonish and ridiculous. Funny how a character who has spent the better part of 4 decades searching to get in touch with his humanity has jumped the shark to become The Mighty Thor.Worst is the scene that mirrors the death of Spock from Star Trek II, here inverted to having Kirk die while Spock lives. We're even treated to Spock yelling ""Kh-a-a-n,"" this time, rather than Kirk. Is this supposed to be high camp? Of course, Kirk is brought back from the dead after Spock beats the crap out of Khan and they derive a life-giving serum from Khan's blood. McCoy says it's their only hope...but, wait a sec...aren't Khan's 76 cohorts lying in suspended animation canisters in the Enterprise? Don't they all have the same genetically enhanced blood as Khan? Er, I think we missed something obvious here - why not take the elevator down to the storage area and draw some blood from one of Khan's sleeping buds, rather than chasing him around San Francisco, jumping like Spiderman from flying car to flying car?I'll bet you a nickel the Borg show up in the next Star Trek movie.Funny how the original TV series and its various spinoffs had no problem coming up with new enemies, dangers and challenges, and on a weekly basis. Where did Khan, the Borg, tribbles and the rest originally come from? From a CREATIVE mind, that's where. Yet the best these movies can seem to do is to recycle villains and situations from the TV series over and over again. The very first Star Trek movie basically took the plot of the ""Nomad"" TV episode and turned it into ""Ve-jer."" The first remake in the JJ Abrams series took the story from the movie ""ST Nemesis"" and switched the hatred of a Romulan outlaw to be directed at Spock, rather than Picard. And now, Khan returns.

But when I saw this was available on instant video on Amazon, well I ordered that one too!  HAHA!  Here is my review!1) Plot:  The plot was excellent and it wasn't too obvious.  The bad guy's name remained nameless to me until just before he identified himself. It wasn't so soon as to make the movie any less exciting than it was.  The plot did take a dangerous theme from Trek history, one that for us Trek followers could have been disastrous if not done perfectly. Some Trek followers might even consider it movie blasphemy.  I admit, there were a few seconds that I thought they had crossed the line.  But it wasn't a few more seconds later where a tear welled up in my eye and was proof to me that it was done well.  Yes, they did it right.  I'm sure the director, JJ Abrams, was sweating bullets the whole time.2) Action:  All Sci-Fi movies should have a lot of action and Star Trek is no exception.  This movie had all of that, and it did keep me guessing about what was next.  There is no shortage of action in this movie, None.  And the special effects supported the action 120%.  From the Enterprise, shuttles, volcanoes, alien worlds, to things that go boom, smash and crash.  Its an eye popping, ear ringing, action adventure movie that just so happens to be in the future.3) Acting.  I rather like that the actor Zachary Quinto that plays Spock gained some weight from the last star trek movie.  My guess would be about 15lbs.  He wears it well, and acted true, albeit slightly out of bounds, from his historical character. But, I suppose that was the point anyways since the last movie changed history right?  Chris Pine, who played James Tiberius Kirk (every time I think of his full name I think of the first movie where the 9 year old version says it - high pitched!) did an excellent job again.  The not-so-confident Kirk is humbled to death in this one and that too is a turn from the historical version.  Everyone else was excellent too.  However, I did think the Tribble was a little out of uniform.  Since when was there ever a  short hair version? - Ok wait, I have the answer.  Since history itself changed.  Ok ok.So, if you are a follower of Trek, you will not be disappointed.  If this is the first time seeing a trek movie, you'll be better than fine, as long as you like Sci Fi, action and good vs evil.Have fun!

Abram's 2009 film version of ""Star Trek [DVD]"" and both are set at about the same time as, or slightly earlier than, the original series but in an alternative timeline. I'm not going to explain more than that because to do so would be a spoiler for the previous film and ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" works best if you have previously watched Abram's first offering. Abrams said that ""The idea, now that we are in an independent timeline, allows us to use any of the ingredients from the past - or come up with brand-new ones - to make potential stories.""He does that many times in this film, which includes a lot of references to the most popular features and characters from the original TV episodes, from the Kirk/Picard voiceover during the title sequence to Tribbles, but you don't have to be a massive Star Trek fan to enjoy it.I would advise against looking up the cast list on the internet before watching the film, because this would give away the identity of the first villain - which was such a closely guarded secret before the film came out that even Benedict Cumberbatch, who performs the part brilliantly, was not told who he was playing until a week after he was cast.I say the first villain because there are more than two sides to the conflict and it is not at all obvious at first who the bad guys are.There is some element of sympathetic parody of the original series, which perhaps can be best illustrated by two quotes from this film. At one point Kirk (Chris Pine) tells his away team""Don't set your phasers to stun - their's certainly won't be""which rather reminds one of the line attributed to his TOS character in a comic song, ""We come in peace - shoot to kill!""On another occasion Dr McCoy (Karl Urban) asks Kirk ""Tell me, are you feeling homicidal, power-mad, despotic?""Kirk replies: ""No more than usual.""Zachary Quinto is magnificent as Spock (Leonard Nimoy has a brief cameo as Spock's older self), Pine and Urban are equally brilliant as Kirk and McCoy, while Zoe Saldana makes a convincing Uhura and Simon Pegg is an excellent Scotty (it grates slightly that his accent is from a different part of Scotland than James Doohan's was, but never mind.)Special effects are, of course, superb, with the Enterprise managing both to look true to the sixties original and like a magnificently sophisticated creation of the twenty-third century.The film delivers non-stop action and excitement, and anyone who is at all into science fiction is very likely to enjoy it.",5,Continues a stunning reboot of the original series,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,2628,"['review', 'based', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'home', 'family', 'Blu-ray', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'sequel', 'Director', 'J.J.', 'Abram', '2009', 'film', 'version', 'Star', 'Trek', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'are', 'set', 'same', 'time', 'slightly', 'earlier', 'original', 'series', 'alternative', 'timeline', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'explain', 'more', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'previous', 'film', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'best', 'have', 'previously', 'watched', 'Abram', 'first', 'offering', 'Abrams', 'said', 'idea', 'now', 'are', 'independent', 'timeline', 'use', 'ingredients', 'past', 'come', 'up', 'brand-new', 'ones', 'make', 'potential', 'stories', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'lot', 'references', 'most', 'popular', 'features', 'characters', 'original', 'TV', 'episodes', 'Kirk/Picard', 'voiceover', 'title', 'sequence', 'Tribbles', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'massive', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'would', 'advise', 'looking', 'up', 'cast', 'list', 'internet', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'identity', 'first', 'villain', 'was', 'closely', 'guarded', 'secret', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'even', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'who', 'part', 'brilliantly', 'was', 'not', 'told', 'who', 'was', 'playing', 'week', 'was', 'cast.I', 'say', 'first', 'villain', 'are', 'more', 'two', 'sides', 'conflict', 'not', 'obvious', 'first', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'element', 'sympathetic', 'parody', 'original', 'series', 'perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'illustrated', 'two', 'quotes', 'film', 'one', 'point', 'Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'away', 'team', 'Do', ""n't"", 'set', 'phasers', 'stun', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'rather', 'one', 'line', 'attributed', 'TOS', 'character', 'comic', 'song', 'come', 'peace', 'shoot', 'kill', 'occasion', 'Dr', 'McCoy', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Kirk', 'Tell', 'are', 'feeling', 'homicidal', 'power-mad', 'despotic', 'Kirk', 'replies', 'No', 'more', 'usual', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'magnificent', 'Spock', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Spock', 'older', 'self', 'Pine', 'Urban', 'are', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Kirk', 'McCoy', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'convincing', 'Uhura', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'excellent', 'Scotty', 'slightly', 'accent', 'different', 'part', 'Scotland', 'James', 'Doohan', 'was', 'never', 'mind', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'course', 'superb', 'Enterprise', 'managing', 'look', 'true', 'sixties', 'original', 'magnificently', 'sophisticated', 'creation', 'twenty-third', 'century.The', 'film', 'delivers', 'non-stop', 'action', 'excitement', 'anyone', 'who', 'science', 'fiction', 'very', 'likely', 'enjoy']",Star Trek Into Darkness

It feels like a bunch of kids playing at spaceships, the characters aren't convincing. Spock isn't too bad and Peter Weller does a reasonable job as the admiral. Some of the characters (Scotty in particular) are just too silly to take seriously.Ok, so it's not a serious film, but the problem is that it has a feel of a high budget comedy that isn't funny. Everyone is trying to keep a straight face, but the audience doesn't get what they find funny.What the film does deliver however is an audio visual treat.

1588780,A205C7VCSDVARI,B009934S5M,Meatwad,"[7, 12]","Director: JJ Abrams.Writers: Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof.Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, Benedict Cumberbatch, Alice Eve and Peter Weller.Running Time: 132 minutes.Rated: PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Action and Violence.There's something I really enjoy about JJ Abrams style of filmmaking. Yes, its flashy and fast and it may come off as a bit shallow, but there's something about it that gives off a spark that really gets me engaged. He can get establish a lot within the first 15 to 30 minutes of a movie, which would take most filmmakers quite a while to build up. Everything from the big action scenes, to the core characters and their motivations to what they do - He knows exactly what he's doing behind the camera.A prime example of this would be when he did Super 8. Within a half hour, we know just about the entire cast, what the kids are doing in the movie, the big awesome train crash that was so publicized happens and it happens at full force and it never feels like its overstuffing its self.Which brings us to his take on the much loved Star Trek franchise. These films of his really cause some weird reactions with people. They make nice amounts of money and get excellent reviews from critics, but if you went to a random forum on the cesspit that is the internet, you'd probably find the opposite reaction. Almost like as if Abrams and co. spat in the face of everyone's mother and other relatives.Personally, I actually really liked - hell, maybe even loved - his reboot of the Trek franchise. Great visuals, excellent chemistry, fun dialogue, fast paced, awesome music - It did a lot of things right, even if the plot was a bit confusing, with the alternate universes, black holes and what not.Something that puzzles the hell out of me is why did the sequel, Into Darkness, take so long? I know Abrams was busy with Super 8 but maybe he should have put that off (as much as I love that film) in favor of doing this. It probably would be doing better business at the box office and critics than it is doing now.Now, in the event you are wondering if I'm attacking the film or am going to spew out negative thoughts on the film, let's get this out of the way:I'm not.While Into Darkness certainly has its problems, and we'll get to those latter, its a worthy sequel to the original and one of the most entertaining things I've seen this year. It still has all the elements I loved from the original with a few new things thrown in.Set a few years after the original, the Federation has come under attack from a terrorist by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a former Starfleet officer out for revenge after he felt that Star command screwed him over in the worst ways possible. The crew of the Enterprise, led of course by Kirk n' Spock (Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, respectively), are sent in to take him down by orders of one Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller). But while the plot may seem simple, things are not as they seem.I feel the need to get the bad stuff out of the way first, like in the same way a bratty child is forced to eat his vegetables before he can get to the good stuff. One of my main complaints of the film is that I feel it goes on for far too long. While Abrams's previous films have sported great pacing, Into Darkness kind of mess up a bit. There's filler in the movie that could have been seriously cut out and it would have been all the better for it, like bits where good ol Scotty (Simon Pegg) gets drunk off his ass or the bar scene between Kirk and Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood and yes, I know its done to show their Father-Son-like relationship but it came off as forced).Another thing that film does that bothers me is that it suffers from being unpredictable to predictable. There's some twists that caught me off guard but there's some stuff that can be seen a mile away. I think it may have to do with the fact that it had 3 screenwriters doing it, the first two being the scribes from the previous film Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman while the third scribe was divisive Prometheus and Lost writer Damon Lindelof. I always get this weird feeling like whenever Mr. Linelof is involved, the product always ends up spawning weird reactions with people. Eh, moving on.As for the good stuff for the film, a lot of the things that made the first film great are still here. The visual effects and set design are better than ever, ranging from seeing things like an incredible fight in hyper-space in which we see all sorts of people flying out of the hull as things explode left and right, to the now famous scene in the trailers and advertisements where we see a Starfleet cruiser crash into a sprawling metropolis. Michael Giacchino's score is still nothing short of incredible, bringing out some true excitement and wonderment to the universe and some of the music is bound to get stuck in your head after its all over.The performances across the board are quite good as well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continue to show they have their characters down pat and never ceases to stop being amusing from watching them be bros one moment to bickering about the rules and personal approaches to how the current mission on hand should be accomplished. Or how Karl Urban, who will always be Judge Dredd in my mind from now on thanks to to the excellent 2012 adaptation, continues to be the best replacement for Bones McCoy, with his quips and grumpy attitude.While some have had problems with the character of Dr. Carol Marcus, a doctor who pops up on the Enterprise under a different name (Don't worry: No spoilers), and her actress Alice Eve, I never really had a problem with her. I thought she did well with the material that was given to her, especially her scenes between her and Bones.But special mention must go to Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison. Charismatic, intimidating, fierce and methodical are just the few words to describe his villain. One moment, you can go from being fascinated and even wanting to see him defeated, to feeling incredibly sorry for the guy. Quite a performance here. He's a true threat and makes the villain of the previous film, Nero (Eric Bana), look like a chump. No disrespect to Mr. Bana, who played a very fun and dangerous villain, but you look like old stuff compared to Cumberbatch. Kinda funny how the guy who has a ship with the ability to create black holes looks less threatening than one man with superpowers.One might ask me: ""Is Into Darkness better than the original?"" I cannot say no, as due to the problems I've mentioned here that were not or at least weren't as big in the 2009 reboot. Star Trek 2009 was incredibly fresh at the time and sadly, with this, some, if only a little of the polish has come off. But that's only minor. Both films are pretty much on the same plane, with Darkness coming up just a tad short.Into Darkness is bound to piss people off, as with most ""sacred"" works in nerdom, like whatever Joss Whedon pumps out or live action adaptations of Anime (which always almost suck). But even with the problems that the film has, there's still a lot to like here. If you can get past the pacing issues and the predictability of the film, you're in for one fun summer movie.Now that all that is said and done, two questions remain: How will Abrams take on Star Wars turn out and what will Paramount do with the next film in the Trek franchise? I've got high hopes for his take on SW, but I'm not sure what to think the next Trek film will turn out. I just hope they get someone who's just as confident and energetic as Abrams is.",5,The Wrath of John.,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,7680,"['Director', 'JJ', 'Abrams.Writers', 'Roberto', 'Orci',

Plus, you get both versions anyway, when you purchase the HD.And be careful when you place your order. Amazon makes ordering via Instant Video so easy, that it's also easy to make mistakes. I accidentally ordered the Standard Def version. The Amazon customer service rep I contacted wasn't too keen on fixing that for me, since I have called about some similar mistakes I've made in the past. But he did so reluctantly ""this time.""

Instead of some great character moments, the writers decide to go for over-the-top action instead of the humanity/friendship angle that the original series and movies proved sucessfully.We also get major plot developments here, only to be undone with a reset button twenty minutes to half an hour later. It  cheapens the drama if someone that dies, is brought back to life. If someone's ship is taken away, only to conveniently get it back soon after.My other issue is, that if you are going to reboot something like Trek, don't start redoing movies that have already been done. This movie takes a character from the original series and TWOK and makes him over with far less success (or impact) than the original source material. If you have a clean slate, why can't the writers be a bit more imaginative? Whole scenes are copied and not even well enough to be considered as an homage. It just seems lazy and unnecessary.They had a couple of years to write this Sequel after the sucessful 2009 movie so it could have been so much more Engaging. What happened in the writers room?

I loved this film from start to finish and am looking forward to the next installment.  As the whole universe changed when Nero attacked Kirk's father's ship in the first film and that Vulcan was wiped out, one cannot expect that these movies should follow anything that the original series and movies did.  And because of the way Spock felt his race die, he will certainly have more ""human"" emotional outbursts at times.  It is only ""logical.""When the movie starts, the Enterprise is on one of their first missions and two things go wrong.  Namely Spock needs rescuing and in doing so the Enterprise makes itself visible to a primitive group of people.  This violates the Prime Directive of non-interference in developing cultures (when was this ever a big deal in the original series?  All they did was interfere).  Kirk does not record anything in the ship's log but Spock does, because he can't lie.  (If you remember Taggart in the Beverly Hills Cop movie you will have an idea how this will play out later).Kirk is briefly demoted and told to report back to Starfleet Academy for remedial training (I was wondering if he was going to meet up with Finnegan).  This lasts until a terrorist attack on London wipes out a bunch of senior Starfleet officers.  Kirk is told to get the terrorist (Harrison who goes by another name that us oldtimers know well) who has hidden himself in the Vulcan sector of space by Admiral Marcus.The movie moves at breakneck speed as the Enterprise goes to bring back ""Harrison,"" despite the lovers spat that is going on between Spock and Uhura.  Mr. Scott seems to be on the ""out"" with Kirk and after an argument, quits the Enterprise and Mr. Chekov has to get Engineering up to speed.The character that steals the movie is McCoy.  The new McCoy goes overboard with spewing cliches that would make DeForest Kelly proud to the point of getting on Kirk's nerves.  He is also worried about Kirk's health and will pick the ""wrong"" times to examine him.Note possible spoiler - there is a brief mention of having to take care of Mudd's ship, so of course we will see a familiar furry friend make an appearence.I really hope that Abrams will continue with a third installment of this film.

Or some such thing. But in spite of that with actors like peter weller on board the movie is still very good.

1588810,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B009934S5M,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 5]","For fans new to the Star Trek series, ""Into Darkness"" is an entertaining if hyperactive tour of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the Enterprise.  But for fans of ""Wrath of Khan"" it acts as an additional layer of enjoyment for that acts as another voice in a Star Trek chorus.  It also sometimes feels like ""Into Darkness"" is so enchanted with its predecessor that it doesn't even try and instead settles exclusively on one long homage.The gang's all here, putting on their game faces to play the parts they established in the first film: Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban).  But despite the supposed freedom of having no longer to establish a back story, ""Into Darkness"" is slavishly dedicated to reimagining ""Wrath of Khan,"" down to the same lines from the script.  But for fans who remember the original, ""Into Darkness"" adds another layer of complexity, inverting roles, putting lines in different characters' mouths, and turning threats into opportunities.  It also takes the devil-may-care challenges that Kirk finally admitted to in ""Wrath of Khan"" -- tantamount to the scriptwriters admitting that they were on Kirk's side all along -- and tore the veil away to let us know that anything was possible.=== ""Wrath of Khan"" ===David Marcus: Lieutenant Saavik was right: You never have faced death.Kirk: No. Not like this. I haven't faced death. I've cheated death. I've tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.=========Thing is, William Shatner as Kirk was over 50 years old at the time he said those words.  In the younger Kirk's mouth they are prescient -- it changes the tone from a mid-life crisis to a quarter-life crisis, and given the reboot perhaps that's appropriate.That doesn't diminish the love note to the original.  ""Into Darkness"" becomes all the more poignant in what it's trying to say -- that friendship is tenuous, that leadership is difficult, that being a leader means making the tough choices -- by making its comparisons to the sacrifices made in ""Wrath of Khan.""  The Kobayashi Maru test figures prominently, testing the mettle of both captains with similar outcomes -- only in ""Into Darkness"" we get to see Kirk's famous workaround.  The simulation is a proxy for the audience experiencing the movie's high stakes.===""Into Darkness"" ===Christopher Pike: Do you know what a pain you are? You think the rules don't apply to you. There's greatness in you, but there's not an ounce of humility. You think that you can't make mistakes, but there's going to come a moment when you realize you're wrong about that, and you're going to get yourself and everyone under your command killed.=========The burden of the captain is a heavy one, ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,"" but like an immature sibling ""Into Darkness"" isn't able to face the consequences of death as seriously.  ""Into Darkness"" has no interest in exceeding the original -- it's content to simply imitate it with a wink and a nod, diverging cleverly to disrupt our expectations while managing to be surprisingly conventional.  And in that regard ""Into Darkness"" is both charming and frustrating in its inability to live up to ""Wrath of Khan.""

It is clear that the executives are finally showing their true faces & the hate they have carried against Star Trek but dared not to show until Majel was gone for fear they would be denounced for what they are & lose control of the Franchise. The only reason anyone tolerates it is because there is no other alternative Star Trek available and no one with enough power to boot them out of the franchise.The Roddenberry's are likely spinning in their graves over these reboot films.In addition to the mutilation of past storylines (because they obviously can't think of anything original) they show their hate of the franchise by destroying things held most dear such as Vulcan & the original crew just to get back at the Roddenberry's & original fans. No one who truly cares about a franchise would ever cater to those who wish to destroy the canon & slap the core fans in the face unless it was an ultimate act of animosity while holding the original fans hostage to their defecation on a beloved institution.If anyone would bother to rewatch the original series, they would see Kirk was a soft spoken warm, gentle character. A romantic with intense loyalty willing to take risks to save his ship. He was never the wild, out of control cowboy, he has been portrayed. Nor was Spock ever adversarial or harmful to Kirk.

That is probably even more the case when the franchise is Star Trek.  This does what all sequels strive to do (yet which many cannot) actually improve on the original movie.Like the first movie it blended action, drama, and humor.  There was not a lot of character development in this movie since it was already done in the last one, but if you saw the first movie this one does not require a lot of set up.  While all of the actors did remarkably well in their various roles the standout performance was Benedict Cumberbatch.  While they kept his role as much as a secret as possible when filming it is well known that he played Khan, the most formidable villain in the original series.  He stole every scene he was in and brought presence to the screen every time he was on.  As good as he is in the BBC series Sherlock, he as just as good playing one of the ultimate bad guys in the Star Trek universe.  Zachary Quinto's portrayal of Spock continued to be very well done, and he does a great job playing homage to the character that Nimoy (who has a small cameo in the film) created, but making the role his own.Like the first movie there are twists on the events from the original series show and movies.  Even though some of the scenes were similar to things that happened in the show and the movies (some in a joking way, and others as major plot points)since the timeline was changed in the first movie things do not play out exactly as expected.  In fact in more than one instance the roles of Kirk and Spock are flipped in situations that occurred before.The movie definitely sets up themes for the next movie, including introducing the Klingons and leaving open the possibility of Khan's return.  The ""main"" events of this movie are all resolved by the end though so there was no definitive set up for what is to come, just hints.  While it is inevitable that the movies will run out of steam at some point, J.J. Abrams has done a great job with it so far, and if he maintains this quality and can keep the main actors on, then he can definitely get a lot more out of the franchise.  Personally I would love to see him introduce the Borg into this timeline, but that remains to be seen.The A/V quality of the blu ray is great, and the special effects are as good or better than in the first movie.  As many have pointed out the extras you get depend on where you buy the movie.  Different retailers discs have different special features.  There will almost inevitably be some ultimate edition kind of release down the road that will combine them all, so if you are really into getting as many bonus features as possible, then you may want to wait.  The stuff that is included in the Amazon release are fine, but there is more out there.In all I think your enjoyment of the movie itself will come down to whether you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise or just like sci-fi movies in general.  If you fall into the latter category I think you can definitely find this enjoyable.  If you are in the former, and can accept that the movie does change things that happened in the original story you will like it.  Whether you want to shell out for the discs will probably depends on where you fall on the issue of the special features.  I definitely think the movie itself is worth seeing but if the special feature issue bugs you then you probably want to stick with a rental or streaming.",5,A more than worthy follow up to the first,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,3682,"['Fair', 'warning', 'will', 'be', 'slight', 'spoilerish', 'material', 'review', 'so', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'proceed', 'caution', 'Movies', 'are', 'reboots', 'franchise', 'are', 'always', 'tricky', 'then', 'taking', 'step', 'further', 'making', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'own', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'trickier', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'case', 'when', 'franchise', 'Star', 'Trek', 'what', 'sequels', 'strive', 'do', 'yet', 'many', 'can', 'not', 'actually', 'improve', 'original', 'movie.Like', 'first', 'movie', 'blended', 'action', 'drama', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'was', 'already', 'done', 'last', 'one', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'require', 'lot', 'set', 'up', 'actors', 'did', 'remarkably', 'well', 'various', 'roles', 'standout', 'performance', 'was', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'kept', 'role', 'as', 'much', 'secret', 'possible', 'when', 'filming', 'well', 'known', 'played', 'Khan', 'most', 'formidable', 'villain', 'original', 'series', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'brought', 'presence', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'As', 'good', 'BBC', 'series', 'Sherlock', 'as', 'just', 'good', 'playing', 'one', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guys', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'portrayal', 'Spock', 'continued', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'homage', 'character', 'Nimoy', 'who', 'small', 'cameo', 'film', 'created', 'making', 'role', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'twists', 'events', 'original', 'series', 'show', 'movies', 'Even', 'scenes', 'were', 'similar', 'things', 'happened', 'show', 'movies', 'joking', 'way', 'others', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'timeline', 'was', 'changed', 'first', 'movie', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'out', 'exactly', 'expected', 'fact', 'more', 'one', 'instance', 'roles', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'are', 'flipped', 'situations', 'occurred', 'before.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'up', 'themes', 'next', 'movie', 'including', 'introducing', 'Klingons', 'leaving', 'open', 'possibility', 'Khan', 'return', 'main', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'resolved', 'end', 'so', 'was', 'definitive', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'come', 'just', 'hints', 'inevitable', 'movies', 'will', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'point', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'so', 'far', 'quality', 'can', 'keep', 'main', 'actors', 'then', 'can', 'definitely', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'franchise', 'Personally', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'introduce', 'Borg', 'timeline', 'be', 'seen.The', 'A/V', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'first', 'movie', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'extras', 'get', 'depend', 'where', 'buy', 'movie', 'Different', 'retailers', 'discs', 'have', 'different', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'be', 'ultimate', 'edition', 'kind', 'release', 'road', 'will', 'combine', 'so', 'are', 'really', 'getting', 'many', 'bonus', 'features', 'possible', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'stuff', 'included', 'Amazon', 'release', 'are', 'fine', 'more', 'think', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'down', 'are', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'just', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'general', 'fall', 'latter', 'category', 'think', 'can', 'definitely', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'former', 'can', 'accept', 'movie', 'change', 'things', 'happened', 'original', 'story', 'will', 'like', 'want', 'shell', 'out', 'discs', 'will', 'probably', 'depends', 'where', 'fall', 'issue', 'special', 'features', 'definitely', 'think', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'special', 'feature', 'issue', 'then', 'probably', 'want', 'stick', 'rental', 'streaming']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1588846,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B009934S5M,mirasreviews,"[3, 5]","""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the second movie in the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise, and, where the first one's awkward allusions to the original television series were endearing, this movie seems to be about a bunch of pathological personalities who live inside a video game. Cdr. James Kirk (Chris Pine) is reprimanded by Starfleet for violating the Prime Directive not to interfere with pre-warp cultures twice, on a whim, on the same mission. His mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), thinks Kirk should get a ""second chance"". But a rogue officer, Cdr. John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), has just blown up a Starfleet facility and fled to the Klingon home world Qo'noS. The very hawkish Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) thinks Kirk is the perfect man to go after him.Gene Rodenberry must be rolling in his grave. Granted the new ""Star Trek"" franchise has next to nothing in common with the various ""Star Trek"" television series and little in common with the long-running movie franchise, which was aimed more at sci-fi fans. This is intended to be a transnational product with little dialog, simplistic plots, and ample merchandising opportunities. But these characters could not even pass as 12-year-olds. Pubescent children at least try to act like they think adults would. None of these characters, not even Spock, is capable of controlling his emotions or his actions -not even for a little while. None have any ethics. The movie is more fascinated with crew members smooching than with any semblance of plot or dialog.The themes run something along the lines of: Kirk does a lot of bad things. Then someone else does even worse things. So Kirk decides to do better things. And the movie interweaves a new backstory for Khan, of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (1982). I think the writers were throwing a bone to the Trekkers there. Benedict Cumberbatch shows some of his usual charisma as the villain, which made me wish he had more screen time and better dialog. Apart from him, the entire crew is wallpaper. The casting director probably had to look far and wide to find a group of actors this unremarkable who could play 8-year-olds with ADD while wearing absurd 1960s-kitsch Halloween costumes.

If he brings the same level of quality to the new Star Wars films, then both Star Trek and Star Wars fans are in for a treat for the next several years.  Into Darkness was a great and thrilling film like the 2009 Star Trek film was.  I, personally, like the first film a little better for one reason, which I will get to.  However this is still an experience you must see in the theater.The characters are the same from the first movie with a couple new additions.  The crew of the enterprise is still very fun to watch and work off of each other brilliantly.  Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto still do great as Kirk and Spock.  I love the development and growth that this movie gave to both characters.  Kirk comes to realize that there are consequences of his rash actions.  Kirk seems much more like a captain in this film.  He is still a bit reckless and hot-headed, but he comes off as much more mature than the last film, which I think is nice.  Spock finds himself conflicted with following protocol and being human.I really like how both character arcs are presented and how they are resolved.The rest of the actors give fantastic performances as well.  We are introduced to a new crew member, Carol Marcus, played by Alice Eve.  She does a good job.  I do not mind her.The villain, however, I have some issue with.  Benedict Cumberbatch as Kon did not do it for me.  He is not bad, and I know he had big shoes to fill.  However, compared to Ricardo Montalban as Kon, Benedict just falls short, in my opinion.  He is the reason why I do not like this film as much as the 2009 film.The effects look gorgeous.  They are every bit as eye-pleasing as the first film, if not more so.  I cannot comment on the 3D, since my theater does not show movies in 3D.  The action is awesome and intense.Overall, this is a must see for those who loved the 2009 film like I did.

Having said that, I've seen almost all of the original episodes that were on TV as well as ""Next Generation"" and a few of the others that followed.  I've also seen all of the movies...in theaters and at home on Blu ray.  But I'm no expert on this series or any other.What I've always liked about Star Trek is the humanity, humor and honor Gene Roddenberry instilled in the franchise.  Director extraordinaire J. J. Abrams has managed to maintain that character in this his second time at the helm.  He also brings to the table a credible cast that manages to retrieve the original characters personalities while adding their own individuality.In an action filled opening sequence, the Enterprise crew is on an exploratory mission when they decide to intervene in the evolution of a remote planet, and its primitive inhabitants, on the verge of destruction from a large volcano.  This is in violation of The Federation's code and James Kirk (Chris Pine) is relieved of his command as a result.The appearance of a terrorist named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch in a chewy role) returns Kirk and crew to chase him to forbidden Klingon territory.  Zachary Quinto returns as Spock in yet another good performance of the Vulcan science officer and second in command.  ""Into Darkness"" borrows some important plot points from past episodes that I won't give away here.  What is important is that this may exceed even the Star Trek reboot from 2009 in terms of action and suspense.  We know all the characters now, so we can concentrate on villains, collisions, space battles and fist fights.  And Abrams is a master.I saw this theatrical production on a large IMAX print in 3D and it equals ""Avatar"" in terms of production quality.  I never noticed any departure from the large print but here is some information I found on Kodak's website regarding the film:""(Dan) Mindel upped the ante further by shooting about 40% of Star Trek Into Darkness in the huge 15-perf IMAX format, which captures a negative image nearly 10 times the area of a standard 35mm frame. Almost the entire story that unfolds outside the Enterprise spaceship was shot with IMAX cameras, usually mounted on Technocranes to facilitate movement. Some scenes were also shot 65mm 8-perf. In using the IMAX format on a narrative feature, Mindel and Abrams were following a trail blazed by Christopher Nolan and Wally Pfister, ASC, BSC on The Dark Knight. In fact, Mindel and Abrams consulted with Nolan and Pfister, who encouraged them to go for it.""That's what I say, go for it.",5,4 1/2 stars for maybe the best Trek ever (IMAX & 3D),1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2648,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'considered', 'trekkie', 'trekker', 'See', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'correct', 'word', 'Having', 'said', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'original', 'episodes', 'were', 'TV', 'as', 'well', 'Next', 'Generation', 'few', 'others', 'followed', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'movies', 'theaters', 'home', 'Blu', 'ray', ""'m"", 'expert', 'series', 'other.What', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Star', 'Trek', 'humanity', 'humor', 'honor', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'instilled', 'franchise', 'Director', 'extraordinaire', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'managed', 'maintain', 'character', 'second', 'time', 'helm', 'also', 'table', 'credible', 'cast', 'retrieve', 'original', 'characters', 'personalities', 'adding', 'own', 'individuality.In', 'action', 'filled', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'exploratory', 'mission', 'when', 'decide', 'intervene', 'evolution', 'remote', 'planet', 'primitive', 'inhabitants', 'verge', 'destruction', 'large', 'volcano', 'violation', 'Federation', 'code', 'James', 'Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'relieved', 'command', 'result.The', 'appearance', 'terrorist', 'named', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'chewy', 'role', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'chase', 'forbidden', 'Klingon', 'territory', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'returns', 'Spock', 'yet', 'good', 'performance', 'Vulcan', 'science', 'officer', 'second', 'command', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'past', 'episodes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here', 'What', 'important', 'may', 'exceed', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', '2009', 'terms', 'action', 'suspense', 'know', 'characters', 'now', 'can', 'concentrate', 'villains', 'collisions', 'space', 'battles', 'fist', 'fights', 'Abrams', 'master.I', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'production', 'large', 'IMAX', 'print', '3D', 'Avatar', 'terms', 'production', 'quality', 'never', 'noticed', 'departure', 'large', 'print', 'here', 'information', 'found', 'Kodak', 'website', 'regarding', 'film', 'Dan', 'Mindel', 'upped', 'ante', 'further', 'shooting', 'about', '40', '%', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'huge', '15-perf', 'IMAX', 'format', 'negative', 'image', 'nearly', '10', 'times', 'area', 'standard', '35mm', 'frame', 'entire', 'story', 'unfolds', 'Enterprise', 'spaceship', 'was', 'shot', 'IMAX', 'cameras', 'usually', 'mounted', 'Technocranes', 'facilitate', 'movement', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'shot', '65mm', '8-perf', 'using', 'IMAX', 'format', 'narrative', 'feature', 'Mindel', 'Abrams', 'were', 'following', 'trail', 'blazed', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'ASC', 'BSC', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'fact', 'Mindel', 'Abrams', 'consulted', 'Nolan', 'Pfister', 'who', 'encouraged', 'go', 'what', 'say', 'go']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1588866,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B009934S5M,Moon Donkey,"[9, 12]","One of my groupies asked for a review of Star Trek - Into Darkness.  I had it on my watch list anyway, so I figured what the heck.  Rock stars sometimes take requests... so I might as well too.The first 10 minutes are some of the most nonsensical in the history of film.The film starts out with the crew of the Enterprise attempting to save a primitive civilization from an erupting volcano.  Kirk and Bones are running through the woods being chased by the natives while Spock is being lowered into the volcano with a device to stop the eruption.Apparently Kirk and Bones have stolen a holy relic from the natives in order to provide a distraction so that the natives won't see a shuttlecraft fly into the cloud above the volcano.  On the other hand, Kirk tells the shuttle that the ""locals are out of the kill zone... you're clear...""  What does that mean?  Out of the kill zone of the volcano?  That seems pretty stupid if you think about it considering that there is no way that they are out of the kill zone of the volcano.  The only other option would be that Kirk is referring to the ""kill zone"" of the device they are putting in the volcano to stop it.  Well that seems stupid too because, as we see, the device goes off but it does not affect the area surrounding the volcano.  Sooooo... I don't get it.Also, why does Spock have to lower the device into the volcano?  For the sake of argument, let's say that the eruption and/or magnetic field interferes with transporters.  Ok... then put the device in a torpedo and shoot it into the volcano.  Why do they need Spock to ride down and do it?  Also, this isn't exactly a technical job.  Spock just has to flip some switches on the device.  Does that device appear to be so complicated that only Spock can figure it out?  Why not send down a red-shirted guy to do the job?  For that matter, why not just drop it out the shuttlecraft door and take off?But what really gets my goat is the location of the Enterprise.  Why is the Enterprise hidden under water?  It is a ""Starship"" right?  What possible reason could there be to hide it under water?  Even Scotty says, ""do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to hide a starship at the bottom of the ocean?""  Actually yes, I do know how ridiculous it is.Typically, the Enterprise would be in orbit and the shuttlecraft would descend to the planet's surface.  Sooooo... exactly what decision making process generated the conclusion that the best way to hide the Enterprise from the natives was to enter the atmosphere of the planet and drop the ship into the ocean like a giant submarine?  How is that a good idea?  Is there ANY reason why that would be necessary?  ANY?  Never mind the fact that having the Enterprise fly around inside a planet's atmosphere is ridiculous to begin with.  Since when has the Enterprise been capable of entering a planet's atmosphere?  Maybe in the next Star Wars films we will see Imperial Star Destroyers flying around inside a planet's atmosphere as well.  Yeah, that would be stupid... and so is this.Seriously - stop for just a minute and think about this.  Assuming the Enterprise was in orbit at some point (because that is typically where one would find a starship), what could have possibly lead the crew to the conclusion that taking the ship into the atmosphere and plunging into the ocean was a good idea?  Huh?  What would possibly be gained by that?  Remember the ""Prime Directive?""  How does flying a starship into the atmosphere help hide it from the native population?  Wouldn't that be easier if you stayed in orbit?Ok fine... so the Enterprise is under the water.  So if you want to make a special effects statement by doing something like that, then do it better.  Recall in the original Star Trek films the majesty of the Enterprise?  How the movies go out of their way to showcase the ship?  Is that what you see here?  When the ship rises out of the ocean, the effects are terrible.  Recall how the Enterprise looked in The Wrath of Khan when it rose up out of the nebula cloud?  How does that compare to the ship rising out of the ocean?  It doesn't.  Instead, we have a bunch of CGI nonsense ... then the view is blocked by a bunch of red trees... then `boom' the ship is flying across the sky toward the volcano.  Maybe I'd forgive the stupidity of having the ship under water if they at least made it look awesome when it came out.  Nope.However, I must point out what Sulu says prior to the ship rising out of the water to rescue Spock.  Sulu says ""I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude.""  What!  What are you talking about?  This is a starship.  What do you mean you can't ""maintain that kind of altitude.""  What kind of altitude are we talking about?  I watched this scene over and over and it makes zero sense.What about the Prime Directive?  Spock doesn't want Kirk to save him because it would allow the natives to see the ship (again - why under water in the first place?) and violate the Prime Directive.  However, according to Admiral Pike, stopping the volcano also violates the Prime Directive.  Pike tells Kirk ""You were supposed to survey a planet, not alter its destiny.""  So what is Spock concerned about?  He is already violating the Prime Directive.  Is he ok violating it one way but not another?Whew.... And that was just the first 10 minutes!Since I had to practically write a book just to review the first 10 minutes, I can't continue that for the rest of the film.  I can, however, highlight some of the other low points:-Distance transporting - does this make any sense at all?  If this were truly possible, then there would really be no reason for star fleet.  Who needs ships?  Everyone can just transport themselves anywhere.-And speaking of long distant transporters, why exactly does Khan transport himself to Kronos, the Klingon world?  Why?  To escape the Federation?  Isn't there anywhere else he could go?  If I was Khan I'd transport myself to that new militaristic starship that the Federation built and take it over.  Why doesn't he do that?  Apparently he helped build and/or design the darn thing.-When the Enterprise arrives near Kronos, why does Kirk announce to Khan that he has arrived and is going to torpedo him unless he surrenders?  I thought the idea was to capture Khan, not give him a heads up you were arriving.  Maybe a sneak attack would be in order?  Well... I take that back... I guess the original idea was to shoot 72 torpedoes at him.-Is it just me or is the whole idea here to make Khan into Osama bin Laden?- Super cell phones - when did The Federation invent super-interstellar cell phones?  How exactly is it that Kirk can make a personal call to Scotty half way across the galaxy?-When Scotty resigns, why is Chekov made head of engineering?  Do they not have a #2 guy?  They have to take a pilot or weapons officer from the bridge and make him head of engineering?-What are the Klingons doing while the Enterprise sits there?  Can't they detect it?-Of all the places to hide people, why would Khan put them into torpedoes?  Yeah, I get he was working on weapons.  However, if you are trying to save people I'm thinking sticking them in a loaded torpedo might not be the best choice.-What exactly does the big, bad Dreadnought starship look like?  The effects are terrible.  You never really get a good look at it.  And why are the space battle effects so awful?  Watch Wrath of Khan and then watch Into Darkness.  Which battle looks better?  Yeah - Wrath of Khan.  Oh... and what is that admiral dude doing while Kirk and Spock figure out how to shoot through space?  Did he take a coffee break or something?-When Khan and Spock go through logic of surrendering and returning Khan's crew to him, they play a logic game going through step by step.  Ahhhh... wouldn't part of that discussion be whether Spock would remove the bodies and arm the torpedoes?  If Khan was so brilliant, why didn't he think of that?  They are... after all... torpedoes.-Was the death scene emotional?  Did you really care?  Again, compare to the same scene in Wrath of Khan.  Which is better?-When Scotty sabotages the Dreadnought ship, where is the rest of the crew?  Recall that when he enters the ship they are bringing what appears to be a full crew on board.  So where is everyone when he is running around? Why does the ship look deserted?Still, I give the movie 2 stars.",2,Why is the Enterprise under water?,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,8398,"['One', 'groupies', 'asked', 'review', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into',

1588871,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B009934S5M,Moviedude,"[2, 3]","SPOILERS AHOY. There's no point trying to review this movie without them.So. Into Darkness sees the new Trek cast go up against a conspiracy within Starfleet; one that begins with a bombing on Earth and ends back in San Francisco, taking detours through the Klingon empire along the way. It's a big, ambitious film, with a clever, convoluted plot that is pleasantly cerebral. And as you almost certainly know, it features English rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. What he lacks in oiled, muscular chest real estate he makes up for in panache. Pine, Quinto and company are just as good as they were before, bringing their own twists to unmistakable classic characters. Peter Weller rounds out the cast as Admiral Marcus, who will surprise nobody when he turns out to be the bad guy, since he already was one on Enterprise.The movie does a ton of stuff very right. In this universe Kahn and Kirk meet for the first time under different circumstances and their relationship is one of tense violence mixed with sympathetic understanding. Kirk initially pursues Kahn, who is responsible for a devastating attack on London, all the way to the Klingon homeworld in an epic shootout (the klingons are kind of a three-way hybrid between their TNG appearances, Middle Earth orcs, and glam rockers, and it totally works) but becomes sympathetic to Kahn's plight as a victim of Marcus' blackmail. Marcus has thawed Kahn (a long-frozen warlord from Earth's distant past, for those not in the know) to help instigate a preemptive war with the Klingons (and to win it with an experimental battleship, the Vengeance). Kahn allies with Kirk, but the Enterprise and its crew are really only pawns as he struggles to recover his frozen soldiers and declare war on the universe.There's a ton of good stuff here. The interplay between everyone is great, the space battles are astounding, and Space seems more wild and wide-open than it did in the first reboot film. Yet the film is sloppy. The biggest problem is Kahn, who quite simply doesn't need to be Kahn. His identity is purely a shoutout to the popularity of Star Trek II; this Kahn is in no way dependent on the original, nor does he have a first meeting with Kirk for this film to spin off from. He could easily have been a totally original character. This fabricated twist that really only occurs in the minds of fans feels cheap, which is a shame because Cumberbatch is great. Conversely, Kirk and company all seem befuddled who Kahn is, when in the Trek universe casually meeting him would be kind of like walking into your favorite Starbucks to see Hitler as the barrista. So the people who SHOULD be excited about Kahn aren't, and the people who shouldn't be are expected to.Trim aside the fluff and the JJ Abrams ego trip though, and this is a really good Trek film. It has the action and epic setpieces we expect of the films, but there are mysteries to solve and alien worlds to visit and it feels a bit more like an episode of the show. The Spock-Uhura dynamic, which was kind of lame in the last film, is now genuinely appealing, and everyone has settled into their roles- none so much as Chris Pine, who affects Shatner's frustrated leader exasperation with perfect pitch. And I'm reluctant to even harsh on Abrams too much- I was no fan of Lost, but his work seems to be increasing in quality at a geometric rate.So buy this movie! Watch it, love it, and look past the hype to see talented actors bringing an exciting story to life. That is after all why we actually watch movies. And yeah, there is a Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan moment and yeah, it is actually pretty good. But I stand by my criticism.PROS-Well acted, great looking, good music. It's all pretty good.-Feels a bit more star-trek-ey.CONS-BD is shaping up to be pretty bare-bones.-BIG TWIST feels contrived and needless.-Benedict Cumberbatch, talented as he is, lacks the rippling bronze physique of Ricardo Montalban.NOTES-In Space Seed, Kahn looks older than Kirk (because the actors are in fact 10 years apart). By that logic, he should now be even older since this Kirk is younger and Kahn has been thawed out for some time. Yet in this film their ages appear much closer (Cumberbatch is only 4 years older than Pine). That's some really nice cryogenic stasis, there.-Throughout Wrath of Kahn, Shatner and Montalban were never actually in the same scene due to schedule and budget issues. In this film they share tons of set time, but are almost always divided in some way- by walkway levels in the fight with the Klingons, by force field on the Enterprise, by pylons on the Vengeance, and by paths through debris in the part where they, um, fly through debris.

It had its problems (mainly in the plot and certain directing choices) but was fun to watch and captured the feel of the classic characters.Into Darkness continues this trend, maturing Kirk into a true leader who measures the consequences of his actions, and strengthening the bond between him and Spock (as well as allowing more screen time for McCoy, Uhura, etc). I was worried when I heard about the villain, but he was written in very nicely (Cumberbatch may not look like the original actor who played the role, but does a similarly awesome job conveying his power) and most of the nods to both the 2009 movie and the original series and its movies were welcome (though some were copied too directly). I found the bulk of the movie to be entertaining and exciting, which to me counts for a lot.

Second, the Bluray quality of this movie isn't blu-ray, its not any better than a regular DVD. (Yes I used my HDMI cord and yes, I put the bluray disc in my bluray player). I own several movies in blu-ray, like MIB3. MIB3 blu-ray quality is so crystal clear I actually only watched it once and gave it away and bought the regular DVD of the movie, because I didn't need to see that much of everyone's skin, it was kind of gross and really distracting.

The story was a good choice and less worrisome than the 'Star Trek: Enterprise' feel of the first.  A bold choice to include an iconic figure from the past has proven controversial.  It is impossible to fill the original shoes.  However, the actor did a great job and I was perfectly at ease with the inclusion to the story.

The character succeeds but pays for his actions by dying. I won't write more as this would be considered a spoiler.One of the things I did not like was the depiction of the Klingons.

1588907,A2HO26XOD5SXLL,B009934S5M,"nashman ""DPL""","[3, 4]","All the complaints on the extras is pathetic. Lets talk about the movie itself. (MAYBE SOME SPOILERS). I am a die hard fan of all the movies and shows including TOS. The movie was great entertainment, great special affects, all actors did a well as expected job.Story direction: I am a little disappointed in the direction this story went or is going. I know there are dozens of storys to be used even from TOS that were never made into shows. Why remake a whole movie? Especially one that was probably the most successful? Its one thing to tweak threads from different storys but to rearrange and retell an entire movie and story line....I really expected more from Abrams. The movie was extremely fast paced and barely any time for any substantial dialogue. It teetered on the edge of lacking substance. The growing bond with Kirk/Spock/McCoy. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but it seems they tried to pack so much into the movie it was busting at the seams with any and every tid bit of information of TOS history, including using old lines (some re-worded) from the original series or previous movies from the old cast. I think its ok to resemble some lines etc but don't just throw them in there just to have them in there. I do like the way Marcus and Nurse Chapel were brought into the story, very clever.Characters: Dr. McCoy--What was bothersome were the amount of cliched analogy's they had Dr. McCoy spouting off. At one point in the movie Spock said, ""enough already with the analogy's"". That was amusing but it was no longer amusing when they had McCoy continue doing these analogy's, in fact I would say JJ Abrams was on the edge of ""SPOOFING"" the good doctor. McCoy had very little insightful or useful dialogue throughout the whole movie. That was disappointing. We all love McCoy's attitude and sarcasm with Kirk and Spock, but they really wore it to death with every one liner cliche they could pack in there. McCoy deserves better than that.Spock: Although Zachary Quinto does a great job with Spock, the Spock character it seems has been softened for lack of better words. And what about this fling he has with Uhura? Pryor story? Originally written? I don't know, but it makes Spock a bit of a pansy, instead of a level headed Vulcan always in control. And what about ""PON FAR""? I guess that's out the window now? I'm just not buyng this fling with Uhura. This movie had moments where he was indecisive and unsure of himself. That's not the Spock we know from past, even the young Spock from past. True he was young and still learning to cope with his human side. But if he wasn't in control as a Vulcan should be then he probably wasn't ready for life in general much less being a Star Fleet officer.Uhura: Great job by the actress but they have her character very lax & emotional, its not complimentary of a StarFleet officer nor to the original Uhura character. Scotty, Chekov and Sulu all do well and their characters flow well in these new movies.Kirk: Chris Pine does as well as expected on Kirk. Maybe just a little bit too lax in his command. I realize this is young Kirk and he is learning who he is. But even a young Kirk would actually command more respect than an older Kirk who's been around the block.Kahn: This guy did OK job, but he lacked the strong screen presence even the older Kahn gave us. Obviously no one can match Ricardo Montalban but if you cant find someone with equally or more  powerful substance on the screen, then dont do it at all. Even Kahn's character deserved some one better.Bottom Line: The movie is entertaining and very watchable. Although it is a remake of an older one, they did change it up enough to keep you guessing. But it wasn't enough to cover my disappointment of trying to do the remake in the first place. I am concerned on where Abrams is going with these characters. My other concern is ending up with a bunch of remakes of movies from the 80""s. These movies will stand the test of time, leave them alone. So far every single Star Trek Big Picture has been with an original story, even TNG movies never remade from an old old movie.The first Star Trek movie Abrams did offered us a great perspective of the whole crew and how they came to be, this movie although is entertaining, was not nearly as fresh and exciting as the previous one.",3,"JJ Abrams potluck version, an insult to the franchise",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,4321,"['complaints', 'extras', 'pathetic', 'talk', 'movie', 'MAYBE', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'am', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'movies', 'including', 'TOS', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'entertainment', 'great', 'special', 'affects', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'expected', 'job.Story', 'direction', 'am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'direction', 'story', 'went', 'going', 'know', 'are', 'dozens', 'storys', 'be', 'used', 'even', 'TOS', 'were', 'never', 'made', 'shows', 'Why', 'remake', 'whole', 'movie', 'Especially', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'successful', 'one', 'thing', 'tweak', 'threads', 'different', 'storys', 'rearrange', 'retell', 'entire', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'really', 'expected', 'more', 'Abrams', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'fast', 'paced', 'barely', 'time', 'substantial', 'dialogue', 'teetered', 'edge', 'lacking', 'substance', 'growing', 'bond', 'Kirk/Spock/McCoy', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'tried', 'pack', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'busting', 'seams', 'tid', 'bit', 'information', 'TOS', 'history', 'including', 'using', 'old', 'lines', 're-worded', 'original', 'series', 'previous', 'movies', 'old', 'cast', 'think', 'ok', 'resemble', 'lines', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'there', 'just', 'have', 'there', 'do', 'way', 'Marcus', 'Nurse', 'Chapel', 'were', 'brought', 'story', 'very', 'clever.Characters', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'What', 'was', 'bothersome', 'were', 'amount', 'cliched', 'analogy', 'had', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'spouting', 'off', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Spock', 'said', 'enough', 'already', 'analogy', 'was', 'amusing', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'amusing', 'when', 'had', 'McCoy', 'continue', 'doing', 'analogy', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'was', 'edge', 'SPOOFING', 'good', 'doctor', 'McCoy', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'insightful', 'useful', 'dialogue', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'love', 'McCoy', 'attitude', 'sarcasm', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'really', 'wore', 'death', 'one', 'liner', 'cliche', 'could', 'pack', 'there', 'McCoy', 'better', 'that.Spock', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'great', 'job', 'Spock', 'Spock', 'character', 'been', 'softened', 'lack', 'better', 'words', 'what', 'fling', 'Uhura', 'Pryor', 'story', 'Originally', 'written', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Spock', 'bit', 'pansy', 'instead', 'level', 'headed', 'Vulcan', 'always', 'control', 'what', 'PON', 'FAR', 'guess', 'out', 'window', 'now', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'buyng', 'fling', 'Uhura', 'movie', 'had', 'moments', 'where', 'was', 'indecisive', 'unsure', 'not', 'Spock', 'know', 'past', 'even', 'young', 'Spock', 'past', 'True', 'was', 'young', 'still', 'learning', 'cope', 'human', 'side', 'was', ""n't"", 'control', 'Vulcan', 'should', 'be', 'then', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'life', 'general', 'much', 'less', 'being', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'officer.Uhura', 'Great', 'job', 'actress', 'have', 'character', 'very', 'lax', 'emotional', 'not', 'complimentary', 'StarFleet', 'officer', 'original', 'Uhura', 'character', 'Scotty', 'Chekov', 'Sulu', 'do', 'well', 'characters', 'flow', 'well', 'new', 'movies.Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'as', 'well', 'expected', 'Kirk', 'Maybe', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'lax', 'command', 'realize', 'young', 'Kirk', 'learning', 'who', 'even', 'young', 'Kirk', 'would', 'actually', 'command', 'more', 'respect', 'older', 'Kirk', 'who', 'been', 'block.Kahn', 'guy', 'did', 'OK', 'job', 'lacked', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence', 'even', 'older', 'Kahn', 'gave', 'Obviously', 'one', 'can', 'match', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'cant', 'find', 'someone', 'equally', 'more', 'powerful', 'substance', 'screen', 'then', 'do', 'Even', 'Kahn', 'character', 'deserved', 'one', 'better.Bottom', 'Line', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'very', 'watchable', 'remake', 'older', 'one', 'did', 'change', 'up', 'enough', 'keep', 'guessing', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'cover', 'disappointment', 'trying', 'do', 'remake', 'first', 'place', 'am', 'concerned', 'where', 'Abrams', 'going', 'characters', 'other', 'concern', 'ending', 'up', 'bunch', 'remakes', 'movies', '80', 's.', 'movies', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'leave', 'alone', 'So', 'far', 'single', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Big', 'Picture', 'been', 'original', 'story', 'even', 'TNG', 'movies', 'never', 'remade', 'old', 'old', 'movie.The', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'Abrams', 'did', 'offered', 'great', 'perspective', 'whole', 'crew', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'previous', 'one']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I was instantly hooked, which then led to wanting to watch The Original Series and all the movies.I, at the time *loved* all the movies and was starting to get into Voyager and Deep Space Nine as well. Toward the middle of Voyager, the writing went in the tank and spilled over into (Star Trek) Enterprise and The Next Gen movie Nemesis.By the time Star Trek '09 came around, I was really hoping that it would get me back into the franchise; as at that point, I had about given up that there would ever be another series or movie. As it turned out &#34;Star Trek&#34; was, in my opinion, just perfect and amazing in every way and made Star Trek fun to watch again.Now, I was aware that there were supposedly to be three movies and when the seemingly forever nameless &#34;Star Trek Sequel&#34; (later known as &#34;Into Darkness&#34; came around, I was really excited.I'm not really sure what it was about &#34;Into Darkness&#34; but I just didn't get the same thrill I did when I saw ST '09. The cast is once again great and I still love Karl Urban's McCoy dearly, but something felt off. Maybe it was the fact that they toyed around with the beautifully done &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; and flipped a few things around. I actually found the outcome of the last few scenes predictable and anti-climatic, which was disappointing for me. I was hoping for a fresh plot this time; but it is entertaining and looking at Chris Pine for a couple hours is never a bad thing.So, it's an entertaining shot, but if you loved the original reboot, don't get your hopes up that &#34;Into Darkness&#34; surpasses its predecessor in any way.",4,"Good, but not as good as the '09 reboot",1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,1730,"[""'m"", 'relatively', 'young', 'Trek', 'fan', 'having', 'been', 'introduced', 'Next', 'Generation', 'age', '6', 'so', '1993', 'so..', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'then', 'led', 'wanting', 'watch', 'Original', 'Series', 'movies.I', 'time', 'movies', 'was', 'starting', 'get', 'Voyager', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'well', 'Toward', 'middle', 'Voyager', 'writing', 'went', 'tank', 'spilled', 'over', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Next', 'Gen', 'movie', 'Nemesis.By', 'time', 'Star', 'Trek', 'came', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'franchise', 'point', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'series', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', '34', 'was', 'opinion', 'just', 'perfect', 'amazing', 'way', 'made', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fun', 'watch', 'again.Now', 'was', 'aware', 'were', 'supposedly', 'be', 'three', 'movies', 'when', 'seemingly', 'forever', 'nameless', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Sequel', '34', 'later', 'known', '34', 'Into', 'Darkness', '34', 'came', 'was', 'really', 'excited.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'was', '34', 'Into', 'Darkness', '34', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'thrill', 'did', 'when', 'saw', 'ST', ""'09"", 'cast', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'still', 'love', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'McCoy', 'dearly', 'something', 'felt', 'off', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'toyed', 'beautifully', 'done', '34', 'Wrath', 'Khan', '34', 'flipped', 'few', 'things', 'actually', 'found', 'outcome', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'predictable', 'anti-climatic', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'hoping', 'fresh', 'plot', 'time', 'entertaining', 'looking', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'couple', 'hours', 'never', 'bad', 'thing.So', 'entertaining', 'shot', 'loved', 'original', 'reboot', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up', '34', 'Into', 'Darkness', '34', 'predecessor', 'way']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I knew the names of all of the principal actors in the film and the names of the characters they were portraying, but I had done a pretty good job of shielding myself from articles containing discussions of the plot. As such, I found the film to be very entertaining and fun, and there were a couple of surprises. I will admit that a lot of the movie was predictable. In some ways, too predictable. While attempting to stay true to some historic Star Trek stories and fan favorite moments, the movie was - in some small ways - lessened. Still, there was action, aplenty, and the special effects department got everything right. The cast is just about perfect. This time around, there seemed to be a lot more cohesion and interplay between the members of the main cast, and every principal character had plenty of time in the sun and saved the day in their own way. The dialogue was 95% great. There were a few points at which I was thinking to myself ""Did they have to make it sooooo close to previous Trek movie dialogue?"" Still, most of the dialogue was witty and true to character, and the actors did a great job with it. I think they all had a lot of fun with this movie. I was especially impressed with how much more I like John Cho's Sulu characterization this time around. Benedict Cumberbatch played an AMAZING villain that you both cheer for and against. I'm sure he will have a promising future post-Star Trek.I really enjoyed the movie, even if it had a few too many points where it tread on ground that's been trod before. J.J.

Why do it when it was already so clearly defined especially with the follow up movie, also a Star Trek classic.  This is a totally totally distinct movie.  They don't try to recreate or repeat the plot of the original episode or the movie. I have to say that given the plot twist of the alternate timeline and it's effect on what followed, I thought they did quite a good job.  While he did an excellent job, I wasn't and still am not sure that Benedict Cumberbatch was ideal casting.  He played  a splendid villain though.J.J. Abram's approach always seem to create a more complex character and expand on their motivations and formative experience to make you see them as more than just good and bad guys, heroes or villains.  Here they did just that.  I have to say that the action sequences were in keeping with the standard of action flicks with it's fast pacing and outlandish stunts.  The special effects were off the charts, and the twist at the crucial point of the movie was, for me, unexpected.  Again, they presented the characters more interestingly, making them more human.  There was also some humorous moments especially with Scotty and McCoy.They could've actually given Karl Urban some more aspects as he seemed to be channeling Deforest Kelly at times.  He was so spot on with the mannerisms.  Perhaps in the next movie.  Don't get me wrong , Karl Urban is an good actor and is perfect for this part, it's just he could have had more to do.  Frankly this movie, for me, rates right up there with ""Wrath of Khan"", ""First Contact"" and the first one with Chris Pine.  Chris Pine plays Kirk with equal swagger as William Shatner without actually seeming to or want to recreate the Shatner experience.  Just enough of the mannerisms but then embellishing and updating the character.  Zachary Quinto was brilliant casting as Spock, bringing his own approach to the part..  Enough can't be said at how he has embellished on the various aspects of this character, the dynamics of his friendship with Kirk, that being distinct from the original series.  Simon Pegg brings a light hearted, but dynamic Scotty to the screen.  He provides some very funny moments  and in so doing affords the Scotty character more screen time.  Zoe Saldana's Uhura is slowly growing on me, after having grown up with the pioneering, mysterious, graceful  and exotic depiction of the original serie's Nichelle Nichols.

The time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists, loud and booming explosions, and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix. It's a summer movie clich&eacute;; one that is fun, yet unfulfilling. You could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of 2009's best films, Star Trek, but have no fear...JJ Abrams is back in action.Into Darkness has come early in the summer movie season, but I'm sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also Trek fans. For me, it's definitely going to be one of the 2013 summer blockbusters to judge all others, simply because it does nearly everything right.Returning with a phenomenal cast, Into Darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time, which succeeds in almost every way. The whole cast, from Kirk to Spock (Pine and Quinto), Scotty to Chekov (Pegg and Yelchin), I could go on and on...the whole cast rocks. Dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here, with each and every character having their shining ""moment."" Cumberbatch, our villain this time around, is also fantastic, featuring an intense and believable performance that doesn't feel clich&eacute; or silly. Above all else one of my favorites, Scotty, gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene. It's only some of the newer faces on the Enterprise are simply ""there"", but it's cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight. The character driven story could've fallen apart, but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes you'll want to root for.The story of Into Darkness is nothing ""new"", but it's far from boring and dull. Featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces, the story told is one that could've easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting. While the plot of the original is a little ""thrown in there"", the plot here is more essential to the experience, it's just a little less original. There are a couple of plot holes, mainly when getting closer to the ending, but it doesn't distract...it simply (and sadly) mars an incredible experience.The visual effects wizards that Abrams commands are also back, with some incredibly delicious results. Ships look gorgeous, phasers and guns look vibrant and cool, and the action sequences are FANTASTIC. Abrams trademark style shines here too, with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that it's impossible not to be glued to your seat. There are also some simply gorgeous shots, from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most CGI enhanced scenes.The soundtrack (composed by the wonderful Michael Giacchino) is perfect. The theme is incredible, Khan's theme is excellent, and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping. The sound effects are loud and in your face, but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment. It's edited to perfection (in theaters).It's only a couple of plot holes and the lack of ""freshness"" that made the original so incredible that keeps Into Darkness just shy of greatness. It's the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair, which arguably is more important and thus makes Into Darkness the superior entry in the series.As for now, Into Darkness is a truly spectacular 2nd act for the Enterprise and crew, one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and Abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again. Into Darkness doesn't boldly go where no film has gone before, but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that Hollywood has dished out in recent memory.But I'll stand by this: What a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season.9.25/10",5,"9.25 - JJ Abrams Returns With An Epic Character Driven Dive ""Into Darkness""",1368835200,"05 18, 2013",2013,4149,"['Short', 'Featuring', 'strong', 'incredibly', 'dynamic', 'cast', 'well', 'acted', 'written', 'grandeur', 'delicious', 'special', 'effects', 'incredible', 'sense', 'pacing', 'match', 'first', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'only', 'nearly', 'out-do', 'himself.9.25/10Ah', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'blown', 'away', 'grand', 'demonstrations', 'digital', 'artists', 'loud', 'booming', 'explosions', 'silly', 'excuses', 'characters', 'story', 'thrown', 'mix', 'summer', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'fun', 'yet', 'unfulfilling', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'skeptical', 'sequel', 'one', '2009', 'best', 'films', 'Star', 'Trek', 'have', 'fear', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'back', 'action.Into', 'Darkness', 'come', 'early', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', ""'m"", 'sure', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'pick', 'most', 'movie', 'goers', 'also', 'Trek', 'fans', 'definitely', 'going', 'be', 'one', '2013', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'judge', 'others', 'simply', 'nearly', 'everything', 'right.Returning', 'phenomenal', 'cast', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'piece', 'time', 'almost', 'way', 'whole', 'cast', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'Pine', 'Quinto', 'Scotty', 'Chekov', 'Pegg', 'Yelchin', 'could', 'go', 'whole', 'cast', 'rocks', 'Dashes', 'great', 'humor', 'stupendous', 'writing', 'are', 'strong', 'points', 'here', 'character', 'having', 'shining', 'moment', 'Cumberbatch', 'villain', 'time', 'also', 'fantastic', 'featuring', 'intense', 'believable', 'performance', ""n't"", 'feel', 'clich', 'eacute', 'silly', 'else', 'one', 'favorites', 'Scotty', 'plenty', 'screen', 'time', 'steals', 'show', 'nearly', 'scene', 'only', 'newer', 'Enterprise', 'are', 'simply', 'there', 'cool', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'get', 'chance', 'limelight', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'could', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'apart', 'gladly', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'even', 'better', 'time', 'are', 'heroes', ""'ll"", 'want', 'root', 'for.The', 'story', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'nothing', 'new', 'far', 'boring', 'dull', 'Featuring', 'interesting', 'twists', 'incredible', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'story', 'told', 'one', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'rudimentary', 'instead', 'smart', 'exciting', 'plot', 'original', 'little', 'thrown', 'plot', 'here', 'more', 'essential', 'experience', 'just', 'little', 'less', 'original', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'mainly', 'when', 'getting', 'closer', 'ending', ""n't"", 'distract', 'simply', 'sadly', 'incredible', 'experience.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'wizards', 'Abrams', 'commands', 'are', 'also', 'back', 'incredibly', 'delicious', 'results', 'Ships', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'phasers', 'guns', 'look', 'vibrant', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'FANTASTIC', 'Abrams', 'trademark', 'style', 'shines', 'here', 'too', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'simple', 'are', 'shot', 'such', 'fantastically', 'cool', 'ways', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'glued', 'seat', 'are', 'also', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'shots', 'great', 'use', 'rack', 'focusing', 'quick', 'zooms', 'create', 'sense', 'realism', 'even', 'most', 'CGI', 'enhanced', 'scenes.The', 'soundtrack', 'composed', 'wonderful', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'perfect', 'theme', 'incredible', 'Khan', 'theme', 'excellent', 'booming', 'percussion', 'will', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'loud', 'face', 'also', 'never', 'lose', 'intimacy', 'important', 'dialogue', 'moment', 'edited', 'perfection', 'theaters', '.It', 'only', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'lack', 'freshness', 'made', 'original', 'so', 'incredible', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'just', 'shy', 'greatness', 'characters', 'thrilling', 'story', 'glued', 'chair', 'arguably', 'more', 'important', 'thus', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'superior', 'entry', 'series.As', 'now', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'truly', 'spectacular', '2nd', 'act', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'one', 'relationships', 'breaking', 'point', 'truly', 'tests', 'both', 'cast', 'Abrams', 'once', 'again', 'return', 'try', 'top', 'once', 'again', 'Into', 'Darkness', ""n't"", 'boldly', 'go', 'where', 'film', 'gone', 'before', 'surely', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'sequels', 'Hollywood', 'dished', 'out', 'recent', 'memory.But', ""'ll"", 'stand', 'What', 'fantastic', 'way', 'begin', 'summer', 'movie', 'season.9.25/10']",Star Trek Into Darkness

He mostly stands around looking wimpy and stupid, is not played by a good actor,  and is unbelievable when he suddenly starts acting &#34;tough&#34; for a minute or two. \I mainly hated the weird and unexplained plot points, like:- Why did Mr. Spock care so much about Kirk violating the prime directive by saving him - yet wasn't at all bothered by the Enterprise saving the planet from a world-killing volcano, a violation of the prime directive that was about 10,000 times more extreme than letting the natives see the Enterprise?  (In the various ST tv series, captains would let whole planets and people be destroyed rather than violate the prime directive.)- Who put the 72 survivors of the eugenics war in the torpedoes? And why?  If the point was to kill them, why not just kill them?  If the point was to save them, putting them inside of torpedoes armed with explosives is a silly way to do it.- Why was Carol Markus in the story at all? She played no role in it, other than being pretty and disarming a bomb, something any other character could have done.  And her very minor and ineffective role in the story effectively ended about 20 minutes before the movie ended.  Once she was rescued, she had nothing to do but again, hang out and looking concerned and pretty.- Why does the &#34;old&#34; Spock look and sound so completely different from the young Spock?  Faces change as people age, but we don't morph into totally different people with different voices and bone structures and heights and ways of expressing ourselves, who bear no resemblance to our younger adult selves..  And why was the old Spock even in the story? He played even less of a role in it than Carol Markus. And why's he so worried about telling young Spock his future, when the timeline has so clearly and obviously changed, and nothing he reveals would make any difference at this point?- Why is Bones even in the stories?  That is, couldn't the authors have tried to come up with a better role for him? In the original series he was the foil to an overly-logical, unemotional Spock. In this version, Spock is almost as emotional as Bones and there is no dynamic tension between them at all.",2,Too many plot holes and inconsistencies,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,2601,"['review', 'few', 'SPOILERS', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'few', 'plot', 'points', 'may', 'be', 'spoiled.Last', 'warning', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'have', 'scroll', 'down', 'ways', 'find', '*******************************************Okay', 'so', '.I', 'liked', 'parts', 'it.I', 'liked', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'James', 'Kirk.I', 'liked', 'costumes.I', ""'m"", 'getting', 'used', 'new', 'Spock.Hated', 'new', 'Mr.', 'Sulu', 'mostly', 'looking', 'wimpy', 'stupid', 'not', 'played', 'good', 'actor', 'unbelievable', 'when', 'suddenly', 'acting', '34', 'tough', '34', 'minute', 'two', 'mainly', 'hated', 'weird', 'unexplained', 'plot', 'points', 'Why', 'did', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'Kirk', 'violating', 'prime', 'directive', 'saving', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'Enterprise', 'saving', 'planet', 'world-killing', 'volcano', 'violation', 'prime', 'directive', 'was', 'about', '10,000', 'times', 'more', 'extreme', 'letting', 'natives', 'see', 'Enterprise', 'various', 'ST', 'tv', 'series', 'captains', 'would', 'let', 'whole', 'planets', 'people', 'be', 'destroyed', 'rather', 'violate', 'prime', 'directive', 'Who', 'put', '72', 'survivors', 'eugenics', 'war', 'torpedoes', 'why', 'point', 'was', 'kill', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'kill', 'point', 'was', 'save', 'putting', 'torpedoes', 'armed', 'explosives', 'silly', 'way', 'do', 'it.-', 'Why', 'was', 'Carol', 'Markus', 'story', 'played', 'role', 'other', 'being', 'pretty', 'disarming', 'bomb', 'something', 'other', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'minor', 'ineffective', 'role', 'story', 'effectively', 'ended', 'about', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'ended', 'was', 'rescued', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'again', 'hang', 'out', 'looking', 'concerned', 'pretty.-', 'Why', '34', 'old', '34', 'Spock', 'look', 'sound', 'so', 'completely', 'different', 'young', 'Spock', 'Faces', 'change', 'people', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'morph', 'totally', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'voices', 'bone', 'structures', 'heights', 'ways', 'expressing', 'who', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'younger', 'adult', 'selves..', 'why', 'was', 'old', 'Spock', 'even', 'story', 'played', 'even', 'less', 'role', 'Carol', 'Markus', 'why', 'so', 'worried', 'telling', 'young', 'Spock', 'future', 'when', 'timeline', 'so', 'clearly', 'obviously', 'changed', 'nothing', 'would', 'make', 'difference', 'point', 'Why', 'Bones', 'even', 'stories', 'could', ""n't"", 'authors', 'have', 'tried', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'role', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'foil', 'overly-logical', 'unemotional', 'Spock', 'version', 'Spock', 'almost', 'as', 'emotional', 'Bones', 'dynamic', 'tension']",Star Trek Into Darkness

My favorite of the films remains Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home--but I've really enjoyed J.J. Abrams' take on the Trek universe. What I've loved most about this franchise overall, however, is not the sci-fi elements or the adventure or the special effects (which were amazing!), but the characters. The crew of the Enterprise is a wildly diverse group that has somehow produced just the right chemistry. They're not just a crew, they're a family. In the face of overwhelming danger, they come together in the way families do.I'm pretty sure this is no longer a secret, so no spoiler alert--in Star Trek: Into Darkness, Kirk and company have their first face-off with the notorious Khan, who appears on Earth with an offer to help a couple whose child is dying. He can save her, he promises. But his offer comes with a price...one that will lead to the deaths of many members of Starfleet, including Kirk's mentor, Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Kirk and the Enterprise crew set off in pursuit.The young Captain James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is what anyone familiar with the character in his later years would expect: brash, stubborn, daring--but always with the best intentions. And with a middle name like Tiberius, one can assume he learned to fight at an early age. He is, as Admiral Pike puts it, Starfleet's ""only genius-level repeat offender.""Spock (Zachary Quinto), by contrast, is still trying to be all Vulcan, in spite of his half human side. Kirk brings out that human side, which frustrates Spock. Kirk has a nasty habit of giving a single-finger salute to logic. He might not break the rules, but he'll bend them beyond recognition, the way Uri Geller used to bend spoons.The negatives? I was disappointed that a pivotal scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was borrowed in this movie, reversed to have Kirk dying to save the Enterprise as Spock did in that film. If one is going to rewrite Trek history, don't include retread scenes! Also, I never bought into the relationship between Spock and Uhura--there was never anything in the original series to even hint at such a relationship, and it seemed to me it was contrived to give the character a stronger presence in the story. It wasn't necessary. Uhura is and always was a great character without the romance angle.All of the actors (Pine, Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin are spot-on in their roles. (Okay, I do have one question: how is it that Scotty, in his later years, has so much more hair than young Scotty? He really is a miracle-worker--or those 23rd-century replicators are just that good!) Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan brings just the right degree of brilliance and menace to the role. I would have preferred he be a more complex villain, like Tom Hiddleston's Loki in Thor and The Avengers, but still I'm glad the character wasn't killed off--there's always the possibility he'll return in a future installment (and I do hope there will be future installments).",4,With a Name Like Tiberius....,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,3064,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'favorite', 'films', 'Star', 'Trek', 'IV', 'Voyage', 'Home', ""'ve"", 'really', 'enjoyed', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'take', 'Trek', 'universe', 'What', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'most', 'franchise', 'overall', 'however', 'not', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'adventure', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'characters', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'wildly', 'diverse', 'group', 'somehow', 'produced', 'just', 'right', 'chemistry', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'crew', ""'re"", 'family', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'danger', 'come', 'together', 'way', 'families', 'do.I', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'no', 'longer', 'secret', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'Kirk', 'company', 'have', 'first', 'face-off', 'notorious', 'Khan', 'who', 'Earth', 'offer', 'help', 'couple', 'child', 'dying', 'can', 'save', 'offer', 'price', 'one', 'will', 'lead', 'deaths', 'many', 'members', 'Starfleet', 'including', 'Kirk', 'mentor', 'Christopher', 'Pike', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Kirk', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'set', 'off', 'pursuit.The', 'young', 'Captain', 'James', 'Tiberius', 'Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'what', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'character', 'later', 'years', 'would', 'expect', 'brash', 'stubborn', 'daring', 'always', 'best', 'intentions', 'middle', 'name', 'Tiberius', 'one', 'can', 'assume', 'learned', 'fight', 'early', 'age', 'Admiral', 'Pike', 'Starfleet', 'only', 'genius-level', 'repeat', 'offender', 'Spock', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'contrast', 'still', 'trying', 'be', 'Vulcan', 'spite', 'half', 'human', 'side', 'Kirk', 'out', 'human', 'side', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'nasty', 'habit', 'giving', 'single-finger', 'salute', 'logic', 'might', 'not', 'break', 'rules', ""'ll"", 'bend', 'recognition', 'way', 'Uri', 'Geller', 'used', 'bend', 'spoons.The', 'negatives', 'was', 'disappointed', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'was', 'borrowed', 'movie', 'reversed', 'have', 'Kirk', 'dying', 'save', 'Enterprise', 'Spock', 'did', 'film', 'one', 'going', 'rewrite', 'Trek', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'retread', 'scenes', 'Also', 'never', 'bought', 'relationship', 'Spock', 'Uhura', 'was', 'never', 'anything', 'original', 'series', 'even', 'hint', 'relationship', 'seemed', 'was', 'contrived', 'give', 'character', 'stronger', 'presence', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Uhura', 'always', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'romance', 'angle.All', 'actors', 'Pine', 'Quinto', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'John', 'Cho', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'are', 'spot-on', 'roles', 'Okay', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'question', 'how', 'Scotty', 'later', 'years', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'hair', 'young', 'Scotty', 'really', 'miracle-worker', '23rd-century', 'replicators', 'are', 'just', 'good', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Khan', 'just', 'right', 'degree', 'brilliance', 'menace', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'villain', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'Avengers', 'still', ""'m"", 'glad', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'off', 'always', 'possibility', ""'ll"", 'return', 'future', 'installment', 'do', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'installments']",Star Trek Into Darkness

This movie gets sadistic!!!If not for my love of the overall Star Trek universe I am not sure I would have enjoyed this film. Some of the violence went too far, and the story line felt contrived for the purpose of unleashing so much evil. Yes the original Khan Noonien Singh was evil and generally a bad guy, but I never interpreted him as sadistic. If anything, he was the bad guy you loved to hate. Benedict Cumberbatch&#8217;s Kahn is not lovable to me in the least bit.In essence &#8220;Star Trek Into Darkness&#8221; is the origins of Khan Noonien Singh, from the movie &#8220;Star Trek- The Wrath of Khan&#8221; and not the music band led by Chaka Kahn. The Wrath of Kahn was released in 1980 and Kahn was brilliantly played by Ricardo Montalban, and this film is possibly the best drama out of all the original Star Trek movies. Nice one to emulate, if you were to do a reboot- strong story line.Unfortunately, I think this Re-boot went too far with the darkness and was not nuanced enough in telling the story of how someone can be driven to commit evil.

Over forty five years ago!? I have checked out just about all the Star Trek spin-offs along the way. From the very good (Star Trek TNG) to awful (most of the first series of Shatner/Nimoy Star Trek films, except for the funny one with the whales). On the whole, I'm glad to see Star Trek still truckin' along. It has been a constant in my life for so long.As to this film, well how many decades has it been now since so many blockbuster films have starred special effects, stunt doubles, model makers, and blue screens? As film after film has tried to surpass the last in action sequences, I long ago lost interest. When all the spectacle was over, the good guys still won.It's still the characters and the relationships between them that determine whether a film is really any good or not. So I'm happy to say that this film is good. Seeing the original Star Trek characters portrayed by different actors at a different time is fun. And it's done with sufficient humor and well-acted pathos to keep your interest.If someone were completely unfamiliar with the world of Star Trek, I don't think that that person would enjoy the film much, except in so far as they love gigantic action sequences featuring lots of destruction and last second escapes from disaster. Their are lots of inside jokes and references to the future adventures of the crew of the Enterprise. (I have always liked the touch with which Federation ships were given the names of former US Navy ships from earlier centuries. Starting with the Enterprise, the greatest ship of the Second World War. A lot of people probably thought that the space shuttle &#34;Enterprise&#34; was named after the Star Trek ship. In fact, maybe it was.)I don't know why I took the time to write this review. With hundreds of other reviews, this one may be read by two people.

No spoilers here, but I'm pleased to see our favorite Vulcan giving in to his emotions on more than one occassion. The noise over Alice Eve's &#34;exposure&#34; was no more revealing than similar scenes from the first of JJ Abrams' reboots. And it was so brief that all it did for me was to confirm Dr. Marcus' original film comment that &#34;Jim Kirk was _no_ boy scout.&#34; Amen to that.No Trek film rates five stars (very few films do) from me, but this one was certainly satisfying and complete. All I can say is that I hope TPTB at Paramount can talk Abrams into doing more of the Trek films.

Has Hollywood dried up in truly imaginative films because their audience is willing to be entertained by simplistic stories.  We need a more thoughtful art form not a reliance on the easy, lazy content.  My favorite Science Fiction movie is the 'The Forbidden Planet'.

To me it looks like he's trying to blend or include the two fan groups (1960's-90's and the new movies) with this introduction. The story had way more action than character developement but I guess that is due to the status quo these days in film making. Roddenberry was WAAAAAAAAAY into character developement. Just look at TNG, Voyager or DS9 to see my point. In those series he cared much more about us &#34;knowing&#34; the characters than actual story lines although the creative genius of the plots was never lacking. Gene was also resolute about the prime directive which both versions of Kirk ignore (esp the new version). Picard would rather die than &#34;bend&#34; it. The latter part of the movie was interesting in the &#34;twist&#34; of characters between Spock and Kirk.

But my enduring caveat is that ""Into Darkness"" displays sadly little respect for the franchise's rich history.Granted, the first Abrams film didn't either, but it got away with it  more effectively owing to the alternate-timeline plot. Here, ""Star Trek"" seems little more than a framework and set of characters to be drawn upon at will, irrespective of events in the original series and the earlier films, and less ""reboot"" than reinvention.I can't expand upon this assertion without getting into spoilers, but, in the main, it comes down to the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain.He is less than effective. I don't blame the actor. Cumberbatch did his best with what he was given -- and he does have one especially resonant scene -- but he was badly miscast in this particular part and for the worst Hollywood sorts of reasons. He should have had weight, and he has none. I wasn't intimidated by his character. I wasn't even interested in him.

Having established the new crew, the writers could develop an actual story. The result is that this is a more personal Star Trek , less about special effects and more about drawing the crew together. I liked this movie and recommend it to Trekkies and to those looking for a light weight action movie. The violence is not so graphic as to make it unfriendly to the kids and there is enough not about technology and flashing lights to keep the non Trekkies in the home audience interested. These movies are never about brain food, more like an afternoon off with some excitement.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>As always these movies come with a package of inconsistencies. I will try to avoid spoilers and sum them up as being not so much logical inconsistencies as structural inconsistencies.  Years ago I remember a professional review noting that in these movies, no matter how massive the destruction of ship/aircraft/space ship and etc., the damage is never exactly that bad. Just something to think about....""Space the Final Frontier..."" turns out to be London! It has to be London because we are here to chase down Sherlock Holmes (dun dun DUN!). OK its Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Holmes for the BBC , but in Into Darkness he has a slight change in make up mostly the same wardrobe. Here he gets a Much cooler overcoat, and pretty much the same lines, motivations and delivery/acting style.As usual Spock does not know how to chill or to be a pal. ""How to be a Pal"" could have been a better subtitle than Into Darkness, but never mind. Pay close attention to Spock. He gets all of the best lines. Scotty has some nice writing but much of that is on his walking plush toy, Keenser. Sulu and Chekhov almost disappear. Love interest &lt;?>  Uhura gets to be brave, mouthy and pouty. I guess that is what every aspiring female adventurer wants. There is a ship's doctor for some reason and a female who will (no spoiler to Trekkie's) be a future love interest.  Can Star Trek III: Kirk Gets Past his Green Skin Hang-up be far away?Over all this is a fun movie. Even so I can't see Gene Roddenberry being that happy. There are too many casual deaths, masses of people sucked into space and no actual exploration, meeting strange new life and the rest of the values GR was famous for promoting.

1589010,A2GBMLJM53M0FZ,B009934S5M,PJA,"[12, 19]","""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a bunch of grand performances in search of an actual script.That the plot has holes large enough to accommodate an exploding supernova should come as no surprise: the screenwriters, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof have a long history of substituting tropes, non sequiturs and jarring plot shifts, in place of coherence, character development and tight plotting.This was tolerable in the first JJ Abrams 'Trek' film, because so much of it was fresh and interesting. However, ""...Into Darkness"" plays like a bunch of fanboys throwing their fave Trek scenes into a hat, pulling them out randomly, pasting them together and calling it a script.We have 'Khan', the greatest Trek villain of them all...and, one of the greatest in SciFi history...or, do we? The role is miscast with the extraordinary actor Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's 'Sherlock'). Do I believe that he is brilliant...ruthless...superior? Absolutely. Do I believe him to be Khan Noonian Singh? Not for a moment...he is too elegant to be believed as the ultimate, genetically engineered warlord. What's worse, Khan's marvelous backstory is hardly mentioned...and, is only used as a plot device to give Leonard Nimoy an absolutely unnecessary cameo.The laziness/sloppiness of the 'screenwriting'reaches its nadir, when the ""...enter the radiation-filled chamber/save the ship/die a hero's death/miraculously come back from the dead..."" routine from 'Wrath of Khan' is replayed...but, with Kirk and Spock switching roles. The shark has been well and truly jumped.Finally, we have a lazily contrived series of events, starting with an Away Team adventure that seems more Bowery Boys, than Star Trek. These implausible blunders are supposed to make the audience believe that Kirk is a moronic, purile egotist...demanding to go on a black ops mission in order to avenge a death...AND, that the Admiral in charge of Star Fleet (a mis-used Peter Weller)would sanction it without a 2nd thought. Its hard enough to believe that Kirk would (even out of a need for revenge) risk his ship and crew this way. That the crew would blindly follow him on such an insane (asinine) mission is pure tripe. The movie reaches Ludicrous Speed, when we are asked to believe that a massive ship (and spacedock) could be constructed by this Admiral, without anyone at Star Fleet being the wiser. The theme of building tensions and political backroom skullduggery between the Klingons and Star Fleet, drove many excellent episodes of the Trek canon...and, would have made an interesting movie. So, also, would have a new approach to the Khan/Kirk dynamic.Instead, the mashing of the two creates dual, under-developed plot lines that never mesh...and, its a pity, because the acting is simply superb.The cast of this latest Star Trek incarnation lays full claim to their iconic roles in ""...Into Darkness"", with the exception the (normally) excellent Simon Pegg as 'Scotty'. His borderline goofiness of the first film has gone over to ham-fisted mugging...for which director Abrams must take a large part of the blame.Zachery Quinto has taken Spock fully into the realm of having/acknowledging emotions. I don't cotton to this version of Mr. Spock...it eliminates the constant struggle with his dual nature; but, Quinto does such a superb job navigating the nuances, that you can't help but like the character. Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is the highlight in this movie. Despite the contrivances that the script forces him into, Pine rises above it, and makes the role of Kirk his own. This IS a Captain that a crew would follow, fearlessly on a 5-year mission into Space. The scenes between Pine and Bruce Greenwood (Pike) are marvelous expressions of mentor/student, father/son dynamics...and, completely organic.I was also very disappointed in Michael Giacchino's score. It is (literally) the same score from the previous Trek film, with the Romulan leitmotifs being recycled for Khan, and the Klingons (sounds like a garage band).Bottom line: there is too much to like in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" to allow me to dismiss it out-of-hand.

This installment, helmed by J.J. Abrams straddles the fine line between computer animation and human emotions, similar in tone and philosophy to the groundbreaking original Star Trek television series.  Perhaps I'm jaded but after awhile computer animation battle scenes becomes numbingly tiresome.  But more often than not Mr. Abrams bails out of frantic action sequences with the human story- the individual and group heroics essential to the Star Trek legend also provides needed gravitas to the story.Acting is first rate, the villains multi-faceted and the heroism exhibited by Kirk, Spock, and others is noteworthy and serves to drive the story to heights not usually seen in space operas.  I still have issues with Chris Pine as Kirk (he lacks emotional credibility and depth) but the terrific supporting cast- including a marvelous turn by Zachary Quinto as Spock- serves to support the story and add color.  Plots owing much to revenge and retribution are often easier to ""sell"" because of the visceral emotions those feelings convey to people.

I'm surprised that Paramount would allow this franchise to be ripped off so cheaply. Or maybe they are just catering to what they believe is the current movie-going public (good reference point: watch 'Idiocracy' for the direction we seem to be going).Every plot turn in this movie ends up being something that we've seen or heard before -- and in a lot of cases, makes no sense to whatever storyline they are trying to present. They've just thrown it in so they can use up *all* of the plot ideas on the list. Additionally, many of the actors are not playing characters -- in most cases, they are playing the actors who played the characters in the original series. Worst examples are the kid who plays Chekov, and, of course, Quinto as Spock. Best examples are Scotty and McCoy, who do a good job with those characters.

Something I did not feel in the first one. True, there are many differences, that Gene might not be so happy about. There is a greater feel of action and daring, as well as fly by the seat of your pants in JJ Abrahms Star Trek. With Gene's Star Trek, there was a greater need to think and use one's brains before brawn. Here is quite the opposite. Now don't get me wrong, I loved this movie from star to finish. But, there were things I had many issues with. I have been blasted for spoilers in the past, so I won't go into the details, but needless to say, if you are expecting Shatner's James Tiberius Kirk, you won't find him here. Though, Quinto's Spock in my opinion is dead on. He plays Spock perfectly. While I love the new Scotty, he is no where near the Scotty we all knew and loved, played by James Doohan. I am already ordering this so that I can watch it again and again. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes the Star Trek universe (different as it may be) or just likes plain action/science fiction. *******SPOILER ALERT****** I will say that we get to see a whole new take on many aspects of the original Star Trek, for instance this movie has Khan Noonian Sing, (remember him) along with modified (yet again) Klingons. And a very inspiring yet (I felt) ripped off death sequence towards the end, with some roll reversal. I don't want to give away anymore of the story so I had to erase what I just typed. You will also get to see a lovers quarrel (sort of) between Uhura and Spock. Very interesting take on Vulcan emotions. ******Spoiler alert over******  Listen, see the movie, you'll be glad you did, then you will want to come right back to Amazon.com and buy it, I guarantee it.

I got a chance to visit the Paramount lot for an exclusive screening of this movie, which left me in awe and thrill. Although this movie is a sequel  to the previous Star Trek series, movie goers who are not familiar with the story will understand the plot clearly. The actors portray their characters very well thanks to the director, J.J Abrams. The scenery and set for the futuristic year of 2240 are so vivid and realistic, audience members will forget they are in the year 2013. This movie is also produced for the IMAX 3D, which puts all the explosions and fight scenes in your face.The relationship of all the characters on the iconic Starship Enterprise are deep and meaningful. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachery Quinto) develop a brotherly love through the struggles they conquer. The Villain, Khan (Benedict Cumberpatch) is a scary two-faced character that will leave the audience guessing his fate until the very end. Not only does the main star achieve his role prefectly, but the co-stars also do an superb job. The writers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof successfully add comedy in the script to bring an emotional roller coaster to the audience.The set ranges from modern skyscrapers to futuristic spaceships. The designers portrayed the theme very well, using many computer generated images to create the year of 2240 in a way that makes it seem so real. The 3D element is an added bonus because it brings the action up close. The beginning scene has lots of running and fighting sequences and yet it is all filmed in such detail that the characters seem like they are going to run off screen.After watching this movie, my passion for Star Trek has been sparked! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it balances the comedy and action scenes so well. It has multiple themes taking place but the on-going theme ""the power of friendship can build you or destroy  you"" is present throughout. This movie contains a hand-full of violence but is not bloody or graphic. The action sequences, violence and realistic make-up could be scary for younger audience members so, I recommend this for ages 13 to18. This movie has sparked an interest in Star Trek for me and hopefully, it will do the same to you.Reviewed by Patrick N, KIDS FIRST!

This claim is bogus for two main reasons, that I see anyway...  One...if you don't believe that it didn't adhere to the exploration mantra, did you not hear the numerous lines about how the Enterprise was about to be sent out on its 5-year mission?  They're getting around to it, OK?  Either in the next movie or in a potential TV series.  So they go side-tracked by the whole Khan thing...give'em a break.  Yeah, OK, and maybe the taunting of the Klingon Empire to start a Interstellar War.And two, the idea that Star Trek isn't about conflict, war, or just having to deal with a really bad guy, and a corrupt Starfleet Admiral, is just being disingenuous as there have been MANY Star Trek episode/movies that have dealt with similar themes.  And this business whether one action was moral or ethical (as per that conversation between Scotty and Kirk) was a bit ridiculous, as I couldn't even follow the logic in that discussion.  And I'm a logical thinking guy.  Because the way I saw most of the moral dilemmas in this film all had to deal with the age ol' Vulcan Proverb of ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""  It was all about the question of whet someone will do to save their best friend or their crew.  And if you put saving your friend over everything else, the rest of the moral dilemmas in the film make much more sense.  So I had no problem with all the moral decisions in this movie.  You do whatcha gotta do.War with the Klingons?  Hell, yeah!  Bring it on!  I hope Trek 3 will continue on with a potential War with the Klingons....just as long as they leave out something about a Genesis Planet...know what I mean?  Just start off the 5-year mission as you would expect, and then being called into action by Starfleet by an incursion into the Neutral Zone by the Klingons.All that being said, I thought Into Darkness was a good film, not a great film, but a solidly good film.  I give it a 4.5 stars.  The only thing that it really needed little more space stuff, although it had more than I thought it would given some of the other reviews I've read.  What it did lack was Enterprise fighting back.  She was so beat up by sabotage and the Vengeance blasting her to bits, that she didn't have a change to fire phasers or torpedoes.",4,Not following Roddenberry's vision???,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,2438,"['lot', 'criticism', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'seemed', 'get', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Roddenberry', 'utopian', 'future', 'exploration', 'driven', 'story', 'lines', 'classic', 'TOS', 'exposed', 'claim', 'bogus', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'see', 'anyway', 'One', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'exploration', 'mantra', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'numerous', 'lines', 'how', 'Enterprise', 'was', 'be', 'sent', 'out', '5-year', 'mission', ""'re"", 'getting', 'around', 'OK', 'next', 'movie', 'potential', 'TV', 'series', 'go', 'side-tracked', 'whole', 'Khan', 'thing', 'break', 'Yeah', 'OK', 'maybe', 'taunting', 'Klingon', 'Empire', 'start', 'Interstellar', 'War.And', 'two', 'idea', 'Star', 'Trek', ""n't"", 'about', 'conflict', 'war', 'just', 'having', 'deal', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'corrupt', 'Starfleet', 'Admiral', 'just', 'being', 'disingenuous', 'have', 'been', 'MANY', 'Star', 'Trek', 'have', 'dealt', 'similar', 'themes', 'business', 'one', 'action', 'was', 'moral', 'ethical', 'conversation', 'Scotty', 'Kirk', 'was', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'follow', 'logic', 'discussion', ""'m"", 'logical', 'thinking', 'guy', 'way', 'saw', 'most', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'film', 'had', 'deal', 'age', 'ol', 'Vulcan', 'Proverb', 'needs', 'many', 'outweigh', 'needs', 'few', 'was', 'question', 'whet', 'someone', 'will', 'do', 'save', 'best', 'friend', 'crew', 'put', 'saving', 'friend', 'everything', 'else', 'rest', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'film', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'So', 'had', 'problem', 'moral', 'decisions', 'movie', 'do', 'whatcha', 'got', 'ta', 'do.War', 'Klingons', 'Hell', 'yeah', 'Bring', 'hope', 'Trek', '3', 'will', 'continue', 'potential', 'War', 'Klingons', '.just', 'as', 'long', 'leave', 'out', 'something', 'Genesis', 'Planet', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Just', 'start', 'off', '5-year', 'mission', 'would', 'expect', 'then', 'being', 'called', 'action', 'Starfleet', 'incursion', 'Neutral', 'Zone', 'Klingons.All', 'being', 'said', 'thought', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'solidly', 'good', 'film', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'space', 'stuff', 'had', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'given', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'What', 'did', 'lack', 'was', 'Enterprise', 'fighting', 'back', 'was', 'so', 'beat', 'up', 'sabotage', 'Vengeance', 'blasting', 'bits', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'change', 'fire', 'phasers', 'torpedoes']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Bollinger ""Phoenix Knight""","[2, 3]","let me say I have never been a star trek fan I have always been a star wars fan but back in 3009 I saw the new star trek series made by j.j.abrams and I liked it not as much as star wars but I thought he did a good job to a series that had gotten stale. In this sequel though I felt a lot more could have been done. First off this is the new story of the enterprise crew trying to stop a madman from destroying the basic tenants of starfleet with the threat of war with the klingons over their head. First off yes Kahn is in this but unlike the one from the original series or movies, this one is not as scary but incredibly cool. Secondly Spock and the rest of the crew could have been done better. Even the new love interest between spock and uhura could have been done better and mor lively but it was good. Another problem is the story, and all the little bits that help tell it all. Certain events and characters seem great but other times they are brought down by others especially the end. With one big event that could have changed star trek forever but because of KAHN didn't. I was very unhappy by how it was done and felt it could have had more weight if done right but not this time. Still it is a passable movie. Fans of the series would love it but non fans of the series will think it is a ok movie, what really brings down the Bluray is the extra features. Movie companies need to think outside the box on the special feature if the want the public to buy more blu rays and how things was done is not going to cut it which is all this blu ray has.

The original cast movies were hit and miss,(stick with the even numbered 2,4&6 original cast movies) but at least they were ORIGINAL. Right from the get go, this flick gives itself away. The plot is a series of invented events that make little sense to get the cast to a point in the story where they need to be for the next retarded series of events. Then there is the cast! The actor chosen to play the part of Kahn carried the role with all the presence of a house cat pretending to be a lion. I realize the original Kahn played by the late, great Ricardo Montalban would be a hard act to follow but seriously? A skinny Brit?.....it was sad to watch. And let us add up the unbelievably stupid aspects of this movie that the supposed ""alternate time line"" allowed......Klingons that look like cat people with too many body piercings,  a transporter that can send a person not just from earth to the moon, but over a hundred light years away, all the way to the flaming Klingon home world! Who needs a starship when you have a super transporter on steroids. What did JJ Abrams do to come up with that one? One too many beers? (yah, we'll say ""beers"")  Let's not forget the warp drive trip back to earth, alllll the way back from the Klingon home world. The script needed it to happen in minutes and not days sooooo lets do it AGAIN folks. Oh yah, now it was Kirk's turn to die saving the ship and not Spock's as in Star Trek 2....you're so original JJ. Oh yes, and let us not forget the part where a warp driven starship is hanging out UNDER WATER on some goofy planet. A dozen ways the Enterprise could have stayed outta sight from the primitive native inhabitants while they complete their planet saving mission but we needed a scene where the giant starship comes out of the sea cause its like way kool.....doesn't make any sense having Kirk violate the prime directive for no reason except to make the scene happen but its like totally kool looking so why not throw it in the mix.

I admit, I liked the moment in the last one when future-Spock met Kirk and introduced himself with the line we all know and love.  But a single line is one thing.  Half the movie is another.I don't know, maybe they were going for an irony story, that the alternate timeline played out in almost the exact same way.  I just know I've never watched a movie before with the line ""you've GOT to be kidding me!"" running through my head so much.I scored it 3/5 because as a stand-alone movie it's actually pretty good.  As someone who has seen Wrath of Khan I'm considering dumping it in the trash.  Whoever the writer for Wrath of Khan was should seriously consider a plagiarism lawsuit; it's seriously pathetic.  The moment Spock was screaming ""KHAN!"" I finally gave up on this movie.  Unbelievable.  I've seen remakes and sequels try to cash in on their predecessors but this is a whole new level of plain reeking of trying to just replicate something else.

Benedict Cumberbatch, as the villain with the familiar name of Khan, delivers a truly memorable and possibly career defining performance. Other standouts include Chris Pine reprising his role as Captain Kirk, from the 2009 film; Zachary Quinto as Spock; and Zoe Saldana as Uhura. Leonard Nimoy makes a cameo appearance as Spock Prime.

I will say that the role that Kahn plays and how he is portrayed just doesn't seem consistent with the Kahn from the old Star Trek movie, and the whole storyline with the top ranking Starfleet officer---I just have to roll my eyes at that.  Aside from those gripes, this movie is even more amazing than the first one with Chris Pine.  I was skeptical about the first movie, only to be pleasantly surprised, and so then I was prepared for this follow up movie to certainly be a dud (surely they can't have a second great movie).  But again, they have pulled it off with flying colors.  The picture quality is top notch, the sound is explosive and nuanced appropriately, with great detail and effective use of the surround channels.  The bass is powerful (if your system is up to the task) and will leave you shaking in your seat.  The movie is action packed, and I like that although the focus of the movie is still surrounding Captain Kirk, again the director takes plenty of time to explore the complicated dynamics of the relationships between Kirk/Spock and Spock/Uhura.  I am also glad that Lenard Nemoy gets to return, as I fear with his current health issues, it's possible he won't be around for a third movie, if they decide to make one.  All in all, this is an excellent movie, despite the glaring plot devices, one of which is way too far fetched in my opinion, even for Star Trek.  Don't buy the steelbook unless you don't mind that annoying piece of flappy cardboard hanging over the top edge.  Sure, you can remove it but the actual steelbook doesn't have any of the information printed on the back, which I don't understand, so I have to keep the stupid paper stuck to the back, that overlaps the top of the movie, and just doesn't look neat sitting in my blu ray stand.",5,"Awesome movie, although the plot is a bit questionable",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1894,"['wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'can', 'read', 'professional', 'movie', 'reviews', 'will', 'say', 'role', 'Kahn', 'plays', 'how', 'portrayed', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'consistent', 'Kahn', 'old', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'whole', 'storyline', 'top', 'ranking', 'Starfleet', 'officer', '-I', 'just', 'have', 'roll', 'eyes', 'Aside', 'gripes', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'first', 'one', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'was', 'skeptical', 'first', 'movie', 'only', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'so', 'then', 'was', 'prepared', 'follow', 'up', 'movie', 'certainly', 'be', 'dud', 'surely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'second', 'great', 'movie', 'again', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'flying', 'colors', 'picture', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'sound', 'explosive', 'nuanced', 'appropriately', 'great', 'detail', 'effective', 'use', 'surround', 'channels', 'bass', 'powerful', 'system', 'up', 'task', 'will', 'leave', 'shaking', 'seat', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'like', 'focus', 'movie', 'still', 'surrounding', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'again', 'director', 'plenty', 'time', 'explore', 'complicated', 'dynamics', 'relationships', 'Kirk/Spock', 'Spock/Uhura', 'am', 'also', 'glad', 'Lenard', 'Nemoy', 'return', 'fear', 'current', 'health', 'issues', 'possible', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'around', 'third', 'movie', 'decide', 'make', 'one', 'excellent', 'movie', 'glaring', 'plot', 'devices', 'one', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'opinion', 'even', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'steelbook', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'annoying', 'piece', 'flappy', 'cardboard', 'hanging', 'top', 'edge', 'Sure', 'can', 'remove', 'actual', 'steelbook', ""n't"", 'have', 'information', 'printed', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'have', 'keep', 'stupid', 'paper', 'stuck', 'back', 'top', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'neat', 'sitting', 'blu', 'ray', 'stand']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1589106,AO6L5RJILSLDX,B009934S5M,"R. Long ""Tessie's Boy""","[4, 10]","Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)As a long-time Trekker, I don't have the many problems with the new incarnation that some do. I like this new cast, and the films are undeniably entertaining, even if it isn't exactly the Star Trek I used to know and love. Philosophy, ethical debates and the merits of intelligence have largely gone out the window in favor of slam-bang action and cowboy heroics. Still, the original Star Trek always contained some of the latter, so it isn't as jarring a change as it would be if, say Picard and crew starting indiscriminately kicking @$$ and taking names.Star Trek Into Darkness picks up a year (four years in real time) after the events of the first reboot, in which young Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew managed to save Earth from vengeful renegade Romulans. During that time, James T. Kirk, while undeniably talented in the Captain's chair, has still not fully understood the responsibility that comes with sitting in it. After a mission to save a primitive race ends up with Kirk violating the Prime Directive, he is demoted in rank--thanks to an incident report filed by Spock (Zachary Quinto)--and assigned to serve as first officer to his mentor, Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), who will be resuming command of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, devastating acts of terrorism committed by mysterious former Starfleet operative John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) have rocked their largely peaceful society. During an emergency meeting called to deal with the latest attack, Harrison ambushes Starfleet headquarters and causes the death of much of Starfleet's key personnel, including Admiral Pike. Enraged and seeking vengeance, Kirk corners Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) and volunteers to lead a manhunt for Harrison into the Neutral Zone and beyond, to Qo'noS (Kronos), the homeworld of the mysterious Klingon Empire. But what Kirk doesn't know is that there is more to ""John Harrison"" than meets the eye...Might as well get to it... **MANY SPOILERS AHEAD**So it's not really a spoiler, everyone knows by now that ""John Harrison"" is just a cover identity for none other than one Khan Noonien Singh. If you only know Benedict Cumberbatch from BBC's Sherlock, prepare to be mesmerized as he kicks all manner of ass here playing the Trek universe's preeminent villain. I do think J.J. Abrams and company could have tried a little harder to find someone who is not a pasty Englishman to play Khan, one of the more important characters in Trek lore; Sendhil Ramamurthy (""Heroes"") comes to mind as a good candidate, an actual Indian. However, at the end of the day the performance is what really matters, and Cumberbatch gives a terrific one. (I mean, he's no Montalban, but then who is?) Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why Khan looks so different, coming from an era before the timeline was altered.Khan's presence here, of course, means plenty of ""homages"" and reworkings of famous scenes from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, including a reversal of Spock's poignant death scene. Here, it's Kirk who selflessly sacrifices himself for the sake of the crew, while his friend Spock looks on helplessly. It's an iffy thing, recreating one of the best-known and most emotional scenes in all of Trek, and they almost pull it off except for two factors, a combination of bad writing and misplaced fan service:The first is some clumsy foreshadowing earlier in the film where McCoy (Karl Urban) is experimenting on a dead Tribble using some of Khan's blood, which now has some incredible healing properties apparently...? Someone asks him what he's doing, and he says, basically, ""Oh, I'm just experimenting with this dead Tribble [for no logical reason] using this blood, it's got the most amazing regenerative properties I've ever seen, blah blah blah""; it's inserted so awkwardly into the ongoing action that even newbies will think, ""Hmm, gee, I wonder if THAT information is going to be important later?"" Meanwhile, members of the audience who've seen Wrath of Khan already are now ten steps ahead of the film and know exactly where this is going.The second (and the worst moment of the film, for my money) comes after Kirk has succumbed to radiation and Spock, mute with rage, looks at his now-dead friend, then screams ""KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!"" Words can't accurately convey just how convey how goofy this moment is, how much it damages the emotion of that moment. I get why they put it in; it's one of the key things, if not THE key thing, that most people remember from Wrath of Khan, and they were going to shoehorn it in somewhere. And yes, sometimes fan service is cool, IF IT SERVES THE STORY YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL. If it doesn't fit the movie, you've got to let it go. The original worked so well because it was a character moment. It's hammy, campy, over-the-top, and yet it's rooted in genuine rage all at the same time. You need a guy like Shatner, who can be hammy, over-the-top and seem genuine all at the same time, to sell a line like that. Zachary Quinto, for all his particular strengths, is not that guy.So finally, at the end, Spock gets mad and goes after Khan, proceeding to beat him into a pulp. I feel like the filmmakers are creating an unfortunate trend in this new Trek universe where Spock is more or less encouraged to fly off the handle, something that would be considered anathema to the Spock we've come to know and love over 40+ years. At one point, Khan belittles Spock, saying ""you can't even bring yourself to break bones."" So at the end of the picture, what do we see? Spock breaking Khan's bones during their fight, something that is presented as a triumphant moment. I recognize that this is, strictly speaking, not the same character as before, but I feel it's a detriment to the character that, instead of using his two main traits--intelligence and resolve--to win out, Spock just has to ""hulk out"" a little now and it's enough to save the day.Oh yeah, and the Klingons were completely wasted. They were in and out of the movie in less than five minutes! The filmmakers could have used any other alien race, could have placed Harrison on any number of alien planets beyond the Neutral Zone, and it would not have mattered. It's a real disappointment that the reintroduction of the most important culture in Trek outside of Earth and Vulcan is so casually tossed off. Truly a letdown.**END SPOILERS**Star Trek Into Darkness has many, many flaws, but it's still entertaining as a popcorn adventure with at least some big ideas. It still isn't terribly original yet, but maybe with a second sequel the filmmakers can finally craft some new ideas instead of remixing old ones. If Abrams and Co. do decide to make a third film, hopefully they will finally embrace some of the headier aspects of Trek (though it isn't likely). The performances are good, Cumberbatch's in particular. Watch and enjoy... but don't think too hard about it.Picture and sound quality were great when I saw them in the theater, as expected. The 3D was very well integrated, especially in the opening scenes, even though the film is just as impressive visually in 2D (we saw it twice). I will update this review with Blu Ray specs when it comes out.**********Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Weller, Bruce GreenwoodDirected By: J.J.

1589110,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B009934S5M,Robert Badgley,"[4, 7]","Sta Trek-into Darkness(released April/13)is a bitter disappointment from the first of this new series of Star Trek films.This one stars,among others,Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk,Zachary Quinto as Spock,Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Uhura,Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan,Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy,Simon Pegg as Scotty,John Cho as Sulu,and Peter Weller as Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus.The film has that old debilitating film trait of wanting to do far too much within a certain time frame.And that 133 minute time frame unfortunately wears very heavily on the viewer.The story finds the Enterprise crew on a far distant planet violating the prime directive.Kirk and Scotty flee from a primitive tribe,trying to steal a precious scroll.They in turn have to jump off a high cliff into water,and re board the Enterprise.The ship,in turn,rises out of the water in front of the tribesmen and Spock almost gets killed setting off a device which prevents the total annihilation of the planet.Back on Earth,Kirk gets his ship taken away from him by Capt.Pike,his mentor.Kirk is made 2nd officer,while Spock is transferred.Meanwhile a ""terrorist"" has set off a terrible explosion in London,destroying a top secret Federation area called Section 31(we have heard of this in DS9).While at a meeting of top Federation captains with the fleet Admiral(discussing the terrorist act)they get attacked(a set up),and Capt.Pike is killed.The ""terrorist"" is identified as an agent from Section 31,and Kirk volunteers to bring the man back,who has fled to the Klingon home world.The Admiral tells Kirk to take along 72 new style photon torpedoes with him.He wants Kirk to launch them from the Neutral Zone to the uninhabited area where the fugitive is,and come home.The Admirals daughter accompanies him,but Scotty resigns in the process,sensing danger.While en route to Kronos,Spock repeatedly reminds Kirk of the immorality of his orders.In the end Kirk relents and agrees to head an away mission to Kronos to capture the fugitive.When the team arrives on Kronos they are soon after set upon by a Klingon patrol.However the fugitive they seek appears to be helping them to defeat the Klingons.When the action calms down he unexpectedly surrenders to Kirk and is thrown in the brig.It is there that the man identifies himself as Khan,a 300 year old genetically superior being from Earth.The ""torpedoes"" the Enterprise carries are actually cryo tubes,containing the rest of his original crew.Spock contacts his older self,who informs him,among other things,that Kahn was the most dangerous adversary the Enterprise ever faced.On the way home,the Enterprise is confronted by a top secret Federation ship commanded by Admiral Marcus.They end up stopped above Earth.Admiral Marcus,we find out,was the one who awoke Kahn in order to possibly glean information that might help the Federation in future battles with its enemies.However it back fired and Kahn went rogue.Now the Admiral is going to destroy the Enterprise.Scotty has infiltrated the Admirals ship and disabled its' power,just as The Admiral was about to deliver the coup de' gras on the Enterprise.While they scurry about trying to get their weapons up and running,Kirk and Kahn board them.They seize the bridge,but Kahn turns on them and kills the Admiral.Kirk,Scotty and the Admirals daughter are beamed back to the Enterprise.There,Kirk is forced to hand over the cryo tubes.However Spock has armed the torpedoes and removed the bodies.They blow the ship up and it and Kahn go down towards Earth,just missing the disabled Enterprise,which itself starts to fall out of Earth's orbit.The anti matter reactor is totally off line and Kirk,in desperation,enters the reactor core to manually re align the reactor.This results in Kirks death,as Spock looks on.Meanwhile Kahns ship has plunged into San Fransisco,but Kahn still survives.The Enterprise scans,detects Kahns whereabouts,and Spock rushes to capture him.Just as Spock is about to deal a death blow to Kahn,Uhura shows up telling Spock to stop.They apparently need his super DNA to repair Kirk.Kirk is indeed revived and a year later is lead speaker commemorating Capt.Pike's death and commencing the Enterprise's new five year mission.I think this time shift/change has really got to me.The sight of a Kahn that looks and sounds like a student of Cambridge University in England,instead of someone with a distinct Latino heritage(played by Ricardo Montalban,on TV AND in films),really,REALLY bugs me.Time shift or not,I think there should have been at least had SOME resemblance physically and in demeanour.I also almost laughed out loud when they recreated the Spock death scene from Star Trek 2,but in reverse,with Kirk dying instead.Now I just shake my head.What also put the nail in the proverbial coffin with this scene was Spock yelling ""Kahhhhhhhn"" aftewards.Give...me...a...break! How totally UN-believable a thing that was and a slap in the face to the entire Star Trek cannon.I also do NOT understand why they needed Kahn's DNA to bring back Kirk.They had 72 different tubes to work with,all filled with super beings with roughly the same super DNA.Any one of them would have done the trick.Right?Not only do those points and others make me de-mark this film,but it's meandering plot is all over the galaxy.This film was far,far too ambitious and was trying to fit too much within the space of one film.The good things? I think the new actors portraying Kirk,Spock,et al,are starting to fit nicely into their roles and it was great to see Leonard Nimoy back again,if only for a few seconds.The explosions and fight scenes are all good...maybe even too good.They certainly are designed to hide this film's weaknesses.Which is harder to do than hitting a Gorn at two miles with a phaser rifle.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extra features on this DVD at all.All in all a BIG let down from the first Abrams epic.I can only say the producers of this new line of films better beware of what Star Trek cannon they climb all over before they start pounding it into new ones.I KNOW this is a new time line,I get it Mr.Abrams.Pike wasn't supposed to die here,in the reality we know,he lived.I can understand that.But hey,a Kahn that no more resembles the original in any way,shape or form than I do...time change or no,that is wrong.And the role reversal with Kirks death instead of Spock....it was not poignant or good,just laughable.This is a film that is less than the sum of its parts.Lesson learned,so let's move on to a better(I hope)third Star Trek installment.And remember...I'll be watching.",3,A definite step down from the first!,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,6657,"['Sta', 'Trek-into', 'Darkness', 'released', 'April/13', 'bitter',

1589112,A1165I5PFKIFEL,B009934S5M,"Robert Carver ""Space Historian""","[5, 9]","SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! You have been warned!!!Others have detailed the plot specifics so I will go with my own perspective as a lifelong Star Trek fan who started watching TOS in syndicated rerun in the mid-70's. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is my favorite Star Trek movie by far and it is in my list of the Top 10 films of all-time. So I was a bit concerned when I read the rumors on the Internet that Cumberbatch was going to reprise this iconic Science Fiction role in Star Trek: Into Darkness. I felt that JJ & company needed to do something different since they had created an alternate timeline with the first movie. I think the writing team had given lots of thought of parallel universes and how certain points and people are fixed in time in all possible universes. The work they did on Fringe pushed them to do several seasons worth of story about an alternate universe. Peter was their fixed person in the Fringe universe who impacted both realities. The writers looked at Khan the same way. I had to think about the plot threads of terrorism, betrayal, security, revenge, optimism, family and trust that were weaved through Into Darkness after seeing it Wednesday night. I then read the novelization and the prequel graphic novel to gain a better perspective before I went and watched the movie again today.The main themes hit by this story are many such as Kirk being too young, impetuous, inexperienced, undisciplined, egotistical, etc., to command a starship effectively; Spock still suffering emotionally from the traumatic loss of his home-world and his mother while trying to connect with his erratic, emotional, impulsive Captain; Starfleet Command reacting badly to the devastating terror attack by Nero against Vulcan and Starfleet in the previous film causing Starfleet Command to turn to extraordinary extra-legal actions to bring security to the Federation despite undermining the very freedoms and ethics espoused by the Federation (Section 31); Scotty being the one crew member (besides Spock) willing to take a moral stand with Kirk over crossing the line of legality and ethics while Kirk & Starfleet are preoccupied with revenge against Khan.So to me this wasn't a rehash of Wrath of Khan because that story was about coming to terms with growing older and feeling that life had passed you by. Kirk's past comes back to haunt him and the Enterprise and Kirk finally had to face his own Kobyashi Maru test with Spock's sacrifice. Khan was motivated by his need for vengeance against Kirk over the loss of his wife and being left marooned on a doomed planet. This too was an issue from Khan's past he could not let go and it was his undoing. ST:ID is about surviving the viccitudes of youth and learning from your mistakes to mature into a better sentient being connected to your friends and society. Kirk had Pike to place his faith and trust in him even when Kirk had royally screwed up from the hubris of flagrantly violating the Prime Directive on Nibiru even as Kirk failed to recognize this error. It took Pike's death and the pursuit of Khan to bring Kirk to the realization that he had to change his worldview and behavior.Spock was struggling with his inner demons over the loss of Vulcan and his mother. He also made a personal journey of self-discovery in ST:ID especially after Kirk sacrificed himself to save the ship. Spock is filled with rage and pursues Khan with a fury never seen before. He helps save his friend Jim Kirk and he can now acknowledge this friendship and let it evolve.Starfleet Command reacted like the US did after 9/11. They undermined their own principles in the name of imagined security. Admiral Marcus had sent out ships looking for resources to help Starfleet defend the Federation and they found the Botany Bay. Admiral Marcus thought he could exploit Khan's genetically engineered superior intellect and his capacity for violence to give the clandestine Section 31 (think CIA/Homeland Security/Special Forces) an advantage in building a capacity to take on the biggest perceived threat to the Federation for Admiral Marcus... the Klingon Empire. Thus you get the top-secret special prototype photon torpedoes and the built for combat USS Vengeance along with who knows what else that didn't get mentioned. You get incidents manipulated to provoke a state of war with the Klingons. All justified in the name of security.Scotty was just awesome in this story. He was a moral compass while getting in on the action with the sabotage of the USS Vengeance. He also got some more great comedic scenes and lines. I was a bit disappointed that Bones didn't get more involved in this story but since it involved more technological issues I can see why Scotty was used rather than McCoy. Bones still got in some great metaphors and scenes and you know he can deliver Gorn babies in a crisis situation. Sulu gets a taste of the command chair and Checkov gets to flex his savant genius abilities as Scotty's replacement (temporarily) as Chief Engineer. Uhura has some issues with Spock, talks up some Klingons, battles some Klingons & makes some tough long distance calls. Getting a young Carol Marcus was cool and they didn't force her to be romantically involved with Kirk, She gets to join the crew and maybe they will hook up in the next installment. The Big E gets a refit to repair her battle damage and the crew of the USS Enterprise embark on the start of what should be an eventful, glorious and historic Five-Year Mission to Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.So I give Into Darkness a 9.235 out of 10. My biggest issue was with how long it took to warp to Kronos and then back to Earth. Unless warp speed had improved by a factor of 100 over the old Star Trek this was a plot device that was just way out of step with the rest of the movie. So other than that I am cool with the rest of the film elements as they were explained by the prequel graphic novel and in the novelization book for the film. I look forward to Star Trek 3 to come out in May of 2016 to be a part of the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Star Trek!!!**************DVD Release Addendum*************I was really excited about the Blu-ray release of Into Darkness. I had read about the multitude of extras that JJ Abrams and his team shot for inclusion with the Blu-ray that would be exciting for the fans. Apparently the good folks in the marketing department at Paramount took a look at this treasure of bonus material and saw a way to extort the fans for even more profit. They struck deals to parcel out these bonus features to different retailers forcing fans to buy a plethora of copies to collect all of the bonus features. I didn't cancel my order because this isn't Amazon's fault and I do want the awesome phaser. I won't be buying these extra copies to line Paramount's pockets full of gold-pressed latinum. Actually, if Paramount had an ounce of integrity they would make a public apology for trying to screw over the fans of Star Trek who have made them profits that would make a Ferengi blush and offer a Blu-ray disc with the bonus material to make up for this error in judgement.The website Digital Bits is where I was alerted to this shameful avarice. It stated the following: ""Yes... the seven featurettes listed in the press release are basically everything you get on the disc, aside from the usual DVD copy, Digital Copy, UltraViolet copy, Xerox copy and what not.  The featurettes amount to about 42 minutes of EPK-style behind the scenes material.  There's no commentary, no deleted scenes, no trailers... which would be bad enough.Except...It turns out that more extras were created for this release - more featurettes and even an audio commentary with director J.J. Abrams and members of his crew.  None of it is available on the wide release Blu-ray or Blu-ray 3D SKUs.  The commentary can only be found as an iTunes ""extra"" download.  And those extra featurettes?  Some are on a Target bonus disc.  Some are on a Best Buy bonus disc.  And some are only available via CinemaNow and VUDU downloads. That's right: More than half of the special features created for Star Trek Into Darkness were used by Paramount's marketing team as retailer exclusives. It's a terrible way to treat your consumers, who are sometimes spending $30 or more for a Blu-ray, expecting to get a little genuine value for their money.  And no, six different versions of the exact same movie isn't value.  If you're a serious Blu-ray enthusiast - or for that matter a Star Trek fan of any kind - all you care about when you buy a Blu-ray is getting the movie in pristine quality with lots of extras.  Though its A/V quality is exceptional, in all other respects the Star Trek Into Darkness Blu-ray is an insult.""

1589115,A3E1N2J6DHGXL4,B009934S5M,Robert Gamble,"[5, 9]","First of all, my biggest pet peeve. A lot of people complain about Spock showing too much emotion in the new movies. Does anyone remember that his mother died in front of him and that his entire planet was destroyed? The character is still young, immature, and malleable. Watch Spock in The Original Series. He displays smugness, superiority, touches of humor, annoyance, and so on. He's not a robot. Vulcans have emotions as strong, or stronger than, humans. They use logic to control them. But I'm guessing losing your planet and mother might allow cracks to show. Additionally, the last two movies take place BEFORE the original series, and if you look at Spock in ""The Cage"" - the first pilot which took place before Kirk took over, Nimoy's Spock was much more emotional - possibly even more than Quinto's Spock. Yes, that was because the character itself changed in concept, but one could also view the character as a rebel who left Vulcan - partly due to his emotional responses, and over time tried to become more and more Vulcan than human.  Nimoy's Spock was able to do this because there wasn't a huge emotional event in his life to the extent that occurred for Quinto's Spock.Ok, pet peeve rant done.  This was a solid movie.  I was actually afraid there would be more action than there was, and while it was pretty action packed - there were moments of quiet and character development interspersed.  There were a lot of shout outs to The Wrath of Khan, but I think the movie made sense in using them.  Perhaps there were a few too many... bringing Carol Marcus in for instance, but overall I thought it worked.  Regarding Carol Marcus, people complain that she's supposed to be a molecular biologist not a weapon's tech.  Her father (and the Federation in general) was obviously affected by the events from the first movie, and probably became much more focused on military action than he would have been without Nero's arrival.  He could easily have influenced her decision of which areas of science to enter.  Still, she was the weakest link in the movie.The characters were just as perfectly acted this time around as before, and everyone had something to do - if only for a moment.  It was an action movie, but Abrams managed to throw more character development and true feeling emotion into scenes than many directors can do with a lot more slow scenes (Iron Man 3 for instance).I rate Star Trek II, First Contact, and maybe Star Trek VI above this one, but those were all great Science Fiction movies that just happened to be Star Trek movies too.",4,Solid Entry in the Trek Movie-Verse,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,2565,"['First', 'all', 'biggest', 'pet', 'peeve', 'lot', 'people', 'complain', 'Spock', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'emotion', 'new', 'movies', 'Does', 'anyone', 'remember', 'mother', 'died', 'front', 'entire', 'planet', 'was', 'destroyed', 'character', 'still', 'young', 'immature', 'malleable', 'Watch', 'Spock', 'Original', 'Series', 'smugness', 'superiority', 'touches', 'humor', 'annoyance', 'so', 'not', 'robot', 'Vulcans', 'have', 'emotions', 'strong', 'stronger', 'humans', 'use', 'logic', 'control', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'losing', 'planet', 'mother', 'might', 'allow', 'cracks', 'show', 'Additionally', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'take', 'place', 'original', 'series', 'look', 'Spock', 'Cage', 'first', 'pilot', 'took', 'place', 'Kirk', 'took', 'over', 'Nimoy', 'Spock', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'possibly', 'even', 'more', 'Quinto', 'Spock', 'Yes', 'was', 'character', 'changed', 'concept', 'one', 'could', 'also', 'view', 'character', 'rebel', 'who', 'left', 'Vulcan', 'partly', 'due', 'emotional', 'responses', 'time', 'tried', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'Vulcan', 'human', 'Nimoy', 'Spock', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'emotional', 'event', 'life', 'extent', 'occurred', 'Quinto', 'Spock.Ok', 'pet', 'peeve', 'rant', 'done', 'was', 'solid', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'afraid', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'action', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'action', 'packed', 'were', 'moments', 'quiet', 'character', 'development', 'interspersed', 'were', 'lot', 'shout', 'outs', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'think', 'movie', 'made', 'sense', 'using', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'bringing', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'instance', 'overall', 'thought', 'worked', 'Regarding', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'people', 'complain', 'supposed', 'be', 'molecular', 'biologist', 'not', 'weapon', 'tech', 'father', 'Federation', 'general', 'was', 'obviously', 'affected', 'events', 'first', 'movie', 'probably', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'military', 'action', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Nero', 'arrival', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'influenced', 'decision', 'areas', 'science', 'enter', 'Still', 'was', 'weakest', 'link', 'movie.The', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'time', 'around', 'before', 'everyone', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'only', 'moment', 'was', 'action', 'movie', 'Abrams', 'managed', 'throw', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'true', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'scenes', 'many', 'directors', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'more', 'slow', 'scenes', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'instance', '.I', 'rate', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'First', 'Contact', 'maybe', 'Star', 'Trek', 'VI', 'one', 'were', 'great', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'movies', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'too']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1589127,A1OZYNWEWRE8WT,B009934S5M,Robert Ruddle Jr.,"[11, 17]","We are a Star Trek family. We truly enjoy all things Star Trek but when stories started to sway from the original theme probably really started with the series Star Trek: Enterprise. Stories of an alternate beginning with a ""time war"" and an attack on Earth that never happened prior in any Star Trek movie or series. Then when the new Star Trek movie came out and Romulans' get thrown back in time and obliterate the planet Vulcan, this totally changes the scope of stories to come. So this movie goes on from this ""alternate time line or reality; take your pick"". Yes this was a story done in the original Star Trek series and then in Star Trek: The wrath of Khan. But keeping that we've skewed from what was to what now is; this story does a great job of being told. And truly some terrific humor and character relationship building.In the original Star Trek, Kirk and Spock come to be brothers, always looking out for each other and this is carried on in this new movie even stronger. And when it comes to action, it may seem a little slow at times but when it does happen, you're not disappointed. The Dreadnaught class of ship was never built in the original series but in this departure from the old to the new, we get to finally see a Dreadnaught ( a British term for a super battleship prior to the outbreak of WWI ) built and in action, which could lend to even more exciting battles to come with the Klingon empire and the Federation in any future stories. This movie builds on the relationship that many old Star Trek fans kept saying existed between Spock and Uhura. Thou it is about time they put seat belts on the ships of the federation, they need to put in the walls. Far too many people keep getting sucked out into space even in this movie. Crew safety was paramount in the concept of the series. But again, this movie delivers a good story and action.We purchased this from our local Best Buy store 9/10/13 and have watched it half a dozen times so far! Thou my Daughter and I did not like how Paramount started this new venture, it has gotten our family captivated. In the extra features thou, this time the outtakes ( bloopers ) were not included! Total bummer because it is enjoyable to watch the cast members having fun even when they make mistakes. We wish they would include outtakes with every movie.

Karl Urban is a great character actor, he seemed side-lined in this film-the hype, the 'no spoilers!' thing... having 'secrets' of the storyline which only serve to make reviewers, or anyone(!), look like bad guys when they wanted to explain why they thought something didn't work-the plot.  It's a serious hot mess-Lifting the dialog from the most famous scene from the Star Trek films, almost verbatim, as if the writers had just given up-predictable face-punching finale-Killing off my favorite secondary characterPERSONAL OPINION-the best thing I can say about Into Darkness is that they made (after a long wait) a fun, fast-paced, good-looking summer blockbuster, and that there will be more Star Trek films to come.  That's a good thing!The worst thing I can say is that the cast and crew (and audience!) for these films are capable and deserving of a higher standard of writing.  The dramatic scenes in this film where the actors get to act?  They're OUTSTANDING.  Full of emotional depth!

But the writers couldn't seem to figure where to go with it, so they went into ever more unbelievable zipping through fields of debris and narrow escapes, giving the same unimaginative end to Khan for the 3rd time, and relying on the same tired ""I have to go into the reactor to save everyone"" theme with some hand-waving revival.All of the wonder of encountering new and different lifeforms, higher or lower, who might behave in unexpected ways is lost from the Start Trek franchise.  There is also a pointed hopelessness that has crept in about the future of man, as it supposes there is no peace to be made with any advanced human type and all are to be destroyed.Most of the glowing reviews are probably written by people who did not see the original series in the context of the 1960s, who don't realize that we were in fact locked in a death battle with the Klingon-like Soviet Empire, and that Star Trek of that era prophesied a hopeful end to the madness of mutual destruction - an alternate ending that 20 years later played out in the real world.Hopefully this version of Trek is not as prophetic.  It makes clear that we are our own worst enemy as [warning, spoiler] Kirk faces off against the evil admiral.  After that the plot goes down a rathole.

1589151,AL5BWQ7N6MLQK,B009934S5M,"Ronin Dave ""Far be it for Logic to Stand in t...","[9, 13]","If you have seen the film imagine for a moment if Khan had been erased entirely from the film and Benedict Cumberbatch played as John Harrison a double-agent looking to start a war with the Klingons.What you would have had is a film that more focused on a struggle for the very soul of Star Fleet - would it be one military might and pre-emptive strikes or would it be one of peace and exploration? The struggle was there in the film but unfortunately too much was focused on Khan that it became buried and practically a subplot to the film.The only thing this Khan had going for him was name recognition. Seriously if you had no frame of reference, his character is so pointless to the story - a 300 year old genetically modified guy woken up to work on weapon systems centuries ahead of his time and he wants revenge because he thinks his super buddies have been killed. Uh, ok?And Khan's grand revenge scheme is to create a situation where the top officials of Star Fleet would gather and then just shoot the hell out of the place outside a window. This guy's suppose to be a genius? He didn't even kill the one guy he really wanted. Another one of those ring bombs he designed would have been more effective. When Kirk interrupts his turkey shoot, he teleports all the way to the Klingon homeworld and does nothing but hang out wearing a cloak until the Enterprise crew shows up later. What was his plan exactly if the Enterprise hadn't shown up conveniently carrying his people in torpedoes? He just so didn't need to be in this movie.The attempt to militarize Star Fleet and jump start a war with the Klingons was a more interesting story and should have been developed further. Given the changes in the reboot universe with Vulcan having been destroyed this would have caused a major shift in the power politics of the galaxy making some in Star Fleet justifiably nervous of Klingon and Romulan reactions. You could have had a struggle in the film where both sides make a good case for themselves but ultimately the more difficult route of peace is the one settled on.Anyway that hypothetical movie aside, I have trouble buying this new reboot as Star Trek. We have a captain who was promoted from cadet to star ship captain and he is given charge of the flagship of Star Fleet? There weren't any other officers out there with years of experience to take that job? All the older series and movies made Star Fleet more organized where people advanced through the ranks based on merit and more importantly experience. Most of the star ship captains we saw through out the other shows and movies were seasoned veterans. Even in the old series Kirk was in his thirties and had several years under his belt as lower-ranking officers. This Kirk just stands out as a wet behind the ears captain who would have been put in his place by every other star ship captain from the old series.Another problem with the film is that it seems to be written with little thought to the consequences. The writers just wrote a bunch of stuff to either make for a cool action scene or magically resolve away a problem like Kirk's death (Spock had to have his body shot onto a miracle planet and his mind melded with another person to come back to life which took an entire movie) but gave no thought to the potential consequences. One or two are forgivable but they made so many that would have completely changed or destroyed the Star Trek world.Khan uses a portable transwarp teleporter which transports him from earth to the klingon homeworld countless lightyears away. That device alone would have changed everything in the Star Trek universe. Klingons and Romulans would be scrambling to the designs of that and beaming their warriors all over the galaxy to conqueror.At the beginning of the film, the Enterprise crew use a cold fusion device to make a volcano inert. You could teleport those suckers into planet cores and destroy them. Coupled with the transwarp teleporter you could do it all from the comfort of your home and hold the whole galaxy ransom.The Enterprise crew wipes out a patrol of Klingons on their home planet. Wouldn't the Klingons have looked into that? Couldn't that have started a major incident? In Star Trek IV the Klingons were angry because a rogue Kirk killed a Klingon crew and took their ship even though that ship had destroyed a Federation ship earlier. You'd think a patrol wiped out on their home planet no less would create a major stink but no the scene was just to have some lazer fights and some Khan moments to establish he's tough.There was a whole secret base near Jupiter which built the huge war ship. This implies a major conspiracy and effort to build it and maintain its secrecy. At the end of the movie apparently it was just one guy and some dudes he hired.A huge starship crashes into San Francisco which would have killed thousands of people but the people who witness it just go about their business once it's over as Khan and Spock race through them.And of course there is Khan's superblood which can cure diseases like the little girl at the beginning and bring Kirk back from the dead after massive radiation poisoning. his blood would cause a major change in the galaxy. Klingons and Romulans would love to have access to blood that could keep their soldiers going. There'd be huge wars over control of those super people and their blood.Again a lot of this is due to Khan being shoehorned into the movie solely for name recognition purposes.If you want a sci-fi action movie with a lot of action scenes loosely tied together where stuff just happens, then this is the film for you; however do not try to give much thought to the plot because it unravels fairly quickly into a convoluted mess.",2,A better film lies buried in this one because of KHHHAAAAAANNNN!!!!,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,5738,"['have', 'seen', 'film', 'imagine', 'moment', 'Khan', 'had',

I am here to tell you that I am a HUGE Star Trek fan and I found this movie to be very good.  I realize Abrams has changed the universe, but that is what makes this so interesting. We all watched the original series, the next generation, voyager... etc.  Rather than relive the past over and over and over again, what we have is something new.  We have a franchise that is decades old and still relevant today.  That is what makes these movies so refreshing.  The fact that they aren't predictable and feel NEW!For those non-Star Trek fans, you will love the movie.  It is very fast paced.  There is humor (maybe a bit too much).  There is a bad guy.  There is suspence.  There is GREAT Writing and a great story.  And more importantly, these actors have done a fabulous job working together and you can feel the chemistry like you did in all the Star Trek series.  Even if you are not a trekie, this is a great fun movie to watch.William Shatner once blasted the Next Generation when it was coming out on TV.

1589159,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B009934S5M,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","[As with the last movie, the polarizing effect of &#8220;Star Trek Into Darkness&#8221; requires that The Rotten Review accept reviews from our satellite office in the Evil Mirror Universe; As in 2009, the Evil side cheated and gets the last word.]THE GOOD UNIVERSE SAYS:&#8220;Star Trek&#8221; is back and cooler than ever!!  When John Harrison, a mysterious evil genius, declares a one-man war on Star Fleet, it&#8217;s up to Kirk to stop him.  Taking the USS Enterprise into hostile territory, Kirk will risk interplanetary war to bring this mysterious enemy to justice.  Once Kirk faces his new foe - far from home and surrounded by enemies - dark secrets will be revealed which may threaten the very existence of Star Fleet and demand that the crew of the Enterprise make the ultimate sacrifice.&#8220;My name is&#8230;.&#8221;&#8220;Star Trek&#8221; proves it&#8217;s still full of surprises.  From the true identity of John Harrison to the inner characters of the crew of the Enterprise.  The visuals are amazing.  Space, so bland and boring on episodes of TNG, is now blazing with energy.  The story moves at warp speeds and never lets up.  If you&#8217;re into sci-fi movies bursting with energy, this is your movie.BUT THE EVIL UNIVERSE RESPONDS:&#8220;Trek Into Darkness&#8221; is both original and great&#8230;but never both at the same time.  Rather, the best parts of the story are so derivative that you&#8217;re more likely to enjoy it if you&#8217;re NOT a Trekker.  That way you won&#8217;t recognize plot ideas used in previous movies (and one plot idea basically lifted whole from a memorable &#8211; if not canonical &#8211; Star Trek novel).Luckily, this liberal borrowing only occurs when &#8220;Trek Into Darkness&#8221; actually tells a story, and there are vast stretches where that doesn&#8217;t happen.  Instead, we get cute scenes of Kirk being an arrogant jerk, cute scenes where Spock and Uhura will choose inopportune moments for a lover&#8217;s spat, cute moments where people drop hints on famous Trek moments (Harry Mudd, Tribbls, etc), and Alice Eve&#8217;s gratuitous underwear moment.  When  &#8220;Trek Into Darkness&#8221; remembers that it&#8217;s supposed to be telling a story it does so sloppily.  Instead of having its characters navigate the plot using their instinct and their reason, &#8220;Trek Into Darkness&#8221; settles for having characters just TELL us what the plot is.  The characters prove so ineffective that it&#8217;s questionable whether they really are characters and not simply people around whom the story unfolds by itself.  It&#8217;s like we could have replaced the crew of the Enterprise at the last minute and the story would have been the same.&#8220;My name is&#8230;!!!&#8221;The biggest surprise is the identity of John Harrison &#8211; Trekkies like me hashed their theories about that one months ahead of the movie&#8217;s release. However, the real surprise isn&#8217;t WHO Harrison really is, but HOW irrelevant it is in the end.  Like the rest of the story, we learn the secret&#8230;when it&#8217;s just told to us.  Like the main characters, Harrison&#8217;s identity could have been switched with no change to the overall story.  It&#8217;s sort of like an Agatha Christie mystery without a murder &#8211; the butler&#8230;did something.&#8220;can we do something about these lights!?!?&#8221;Following the example of the last movie, &#8220;Trek Into Darkness&#8221; is gloriously vivid, perhaps a bit too vivid.  Once again, the interiors of starships built by an advanced civilization of human beings will either be these rooms flooded with light OR these dirty industrial areas that look like the factory floor at Anheuser-Busch.  The exterior shots of spacecraft are more beautiful than anything seen before in Trek, but less elaborate than the first several movies, especially the &#8220;Run Silent, Run Deep&#8221; space combat scenes from &#8220;Wrath of Khan&#8221;.  Nothing on screen can distract you from the lack of original plot or compelling characters.I would have been willing to wait an extra few years for a Trek movie that actually came up with an original story. Is that so difficult?  There are hordes of Trek fan projects on the web that have (at least) a good story to distract from bargain-basement visuals. This bodes poorly for JJ Adams&#8217;s planned future projects (or should that be &#8220;poorly does this bode&#8221;).  In short, if you like your sci-fi with a strong plot and unique characters, this is NOT your movie.",3,Whether you love it or hate it depends on what you look for in movies,1390953600,"01 29,

1589164,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B009934S5M,R. Sardrena,"[2, 4]","""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" is the sequel to JJ Abrams awful 2009 revision of the hoary sci-fi series.  Though the weaknesses of the first film remain, there are enough redemptive features here to bear watching.Though the choices for the Kirk and Spock leads remain poor - Chris Pine is a clown, Zachary Quinto is unlikable and unbelievable as an intellectual and the Spock/Uhura neurotic romance angle remains  - new additions to the cast improve things quite a bit: Benedict Cumberbatch - fresh from his popular portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in an equally crass bastardization of that genre - and ol' Robocop Peter Weller add a great deal of gravitas to the sequel.  Cumberbatch has a grand time twisting his narrow features into all kinds of sinister contortions, using his resonant British voice powerfully.  No attempt is made to explain why the Indian Khan Noonian Singh is now a pasty faced Brit.  Weller is a wonder, giving his militaristic Starfleet admiral the perfect air of menacing arrogance.One amusing manufactured controversy involves a glimpse of young Carol Marcus in her underwear.  The self-righteous were ""shocked, shocked"" that Hollywood would dare to show an attractive woman in flimsy clothing.  The screenwriter even issued a ""mea culpa"" to the easily offended.  No one admitted that this has been going on - usually in longer shots - since moving pictures began.The second Abrams trek continues to boast production values denied the franchise during the years when it was well-written.  Viewers can ooh and ahh over a giant black Federation starship that menaces the Enterprise.  Interior sets have been upgraded since the last film too.  Though they remain pink and white with annoying lens flares, the sets include scenes shot at Lawrence Livermore Labs.  This marginally mitigates the mistake of shooting a Budweiser distillery as Engineering.The biggest problem remains the script.  Whereas in Abrams' ""Star Trek"" the main characters repeated their old signature lines ad infinitem (""I'm a doctor, not a ____""), the sequel repeats variations on entire scenes from popular predecessors.

While a good chase scene or battle scene can work well in a movie, here they're just an excuse for the special effects.  The real film basically stops when they send Kirk after Khan--after that, we get a few scattered details about characters and background, but no real character or plot development.

1589171,A2B3VV5Y4FHHBL,B009934S5M,Russell W. Sanders,"[3, 5]","Into the Darkness is everything Star Trek was never meant to be.  I'm a casual viewer, not a Trek fanatic, but even at that level, this film seemed abrasive to everything that its meant to build upon.  Its all video-game action with little concern about developing anything resembling a storyline.  Its fast moving but there isn't really any point to it moving along at any speed.  If it weren't part of a franchise, the film would quickly collapse as it doesn't have much of a foundation to make it worthwhile.  This is masked as its a reboot that tries to break away from the old material while concurrently trying to remind you that its deeply rooted in the same material its trying to ignore.  This is the real problem.  It wants to boldly go where no man has gone before but does so by tip-toeing in bunny slippers.The original cast of these characters were all, in my opinion, only average actors, Nimoy and Takei notwithstanding, but they had amazing charisma and interaction.  The reboot has really good actors but there is no magic in their performance.  They provide mirrors to their 1960s versions but not much else.  The single exception to this is the truly original aspect of Spock and Uhura, which hints at what this reboot should have been.  Instead, we get a poor rehash of the Wrath of Khan storyline that feels like Iron Man or Captain America.  It also drags out the &#34;senior leader is corrupt&#34; scenario which has never worked in Star Trek, despite the multiple attempts and is now so cliche as to be laughable.  The assembly of formula elements screams that JJ Abrams and his film crew just don't seem to understand the franchise they're working on, nor do they seem to have much of a clue as to the nature of the new universe they are trying to build.  The plot holes and logical disconnects in this film and the 2009 reboot are huge, so much so they make anything and everything else seem flimsy and very ill-conceived.THE GOOD- Pretty good soundtrack- Spock and Uhura interaction- The new Enterprise design is pretty coolThe BAD- Horrible retelling of the Khan story- Very weak plot and disjointed storyline- Mindless CG action- Fairly lifeless despite lots of activityCONCLUSION:  Star Trek really ended with the Generations film.

It's FICTION. It's a story, with plots and characters, locations and events-- ALL MADE UP. Sorry to shake the very foundation of your beliefs. But from the first episode of TOS, Gene Roddenberry was telling stories about truth, honor, trust, compassion, intelligence, companionship, bravery, and above all else, human emotion.

When you get quality like this and have an HDTV, this is the best way to enjoy a movie.Now the movie review:I loved it.  I am by no means a die-hard Star Trek fan. In fact, my first real entry into the universe was through the 2009 film, which I thought was a good start to a new franchise of movies.Into Darkness was even better, because without having to spend time on character backstories, they were able to jump right into the story.  There were several interesting twists that I did not see coming.  While all of the cast is good, I was most impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch.  He easily conveys the physical strength and mental prowess of Khan.  I was also happy to see that several supporting characters (Ahura, Scott, and Bones) got their own mini stories rather than just supporting the Kirk/Spock story.Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it has heart.  As a fan of Fringe, Lost, Super 8 and other Bad Robot projects, one of the things that stand out about these projects is that they tend to tell very good character stories where friendship and camaraderie are central.  Into Darkness is no exception.The movie looks stunning.

All it has are barely 42 min.s of EPK behind/scenes stuff ....and that's it. No commentaries, no deleted scenes, nothing else. Other material is only available on-line or as the exclusive of certain stores' editions. Anyway, those of you who care about extras are being cheated.  Details can be found in all of the discussions on this page's forum below, and also at the digital bits' review of this blu-ray. (Which has become pretty infamous since its posting)///As a long-time Trek fan, and my feelings about JJ Abrams' version(s) remains mixed. (Star Trek [Blu-ray]So this is a review based on first viewing / first impressions.In terms of quality, this movie is all over the place. And so is its plot. Plot-lines are dropped, and the conspirators' evil plot(s?) never really make any sense, partially because none of it ever really comes together in the end. And, yes, yet again, the action occasionally gets way over the top, sometimes adding to the nonsensical feel of the movie. There's also a nice little brief encounter with (quasi-Goth??!!) Klingons.&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER PARAGRAPH: My biggest problem comes later in the film -- what starts as a nice parallel to movie 2 (WoK) becomes another travesty, another example of Trek's refusal to permanently kill off a main character. A great dramatic opportunity gets utterly wasted by a last-minute super-miraculous (even by 23rd-century standards) cure. Dammit! And so we end up with a mega-overdone-Angry Spock (tm), just so he can lose control enough to get into a massive brawl and beat the tar out of the villain. Jeez, talk about a letdown. The first half was --however haltingly-- potentially leading into a riveting story (albeit re-using a bunch of characters and concepts from ST2), only to waste weepy time on a false death and lead into a literally overkill fight sequence, and more brutal action facing up against a super-militarized starship. (Crazy '80s Trek novels ""Dreadnought,"" much?Dreadnought! (Star Trek, No 29)) SPOILER END>>>The visuals are generally nice, the score's okay, the character dynamics usually remain entertaining, and Cumberbatch's character is pretty interesting.

Diehard Trek fans as well as new fans to the franchise will enjoy this fast-paced, action-packed adventure. Those familiar with the original series will, of course, catch more clues and references to the impending story and correlation to the alternate version. And this super-fan was not disappointed in the least. My one complaint is that Abrams could stand to tone down the lens flares during the bridge scenes.Full of intense fight scenes, drama, suspense, intrigue, and plenty of humor, Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent sequel. And while I loved the story, the strong point for the film is the characters.  We had the backstory and groundwork set in the previous film, and here we see the characters grow and their relationships develop. The cast and acting is spot-on, once again. Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), and Simon Pegg (Scotty) have great, central roles in this film. I wish Karl Urban (Bones) had more screen time. I think he's fantastic. And of course, Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant in his complex, villainous role.While some of the big mystery reveals were a bit predictable, especially to fans, I think it served as a respectable homage.  I only hope we don't have to wait another four years to see another installment. But with Abrams focusing on Star Wars next, Star Trek will need to pass on to another director for that to happen. A strong foundation has been laid here with this alternate crew with limitless possibilities for new stories and adventures, whether it be more films, tv, or novels. I'll certainly be going to see this one a few more times in the theater, especially on IMAX. The 3D screening was nice, but after the first hour I forgot about it. Beyond the first few scenes, I don't think the 3D is necessary. Either way, don't miss this exciting sequel.Review previously posted at SciFiChick.",5,Excellent Sequel,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1947,"['Four', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'last', 'Star', 'Trek', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'Diehard', 'Trek', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'fans', 'franchise', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fast-paced', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'familiar', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'course', 'catch', 'more', 'clues', 'references', 'impending', 'story', 'correlation', 'alternate', 'version', 'super-fan', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'least', 'one', 'complaint', 'Abrams', 'could', 'stand', 'tone', 'down', 'lens', 'flares', 'bridge', 'scenes.Full', 'intense', 'fight', 'scenes', 'drama', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'plenty', 'humor', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'excellent', 'sequel', 'loved', 'story', 'strong', 'point', 'film', 'characters', 'had', 'backstory', 'groundwork', 'set', 'previous', 'film', 'here', 'see', 'characters', 'grow', 'relationships', 'develop', 'cast', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'once', 'again', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Kirk', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Spock', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Scotty', 'have', 'great', 'central', 'roles', 'film', 'wish', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Bones', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'think', 'fantastic', 'course', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'was', 'brilliant', 'complex', 'villainous', 'role.While', 'big', 'mystery', 'reveals', 'were', 'bit', 'predictable', 'especially', 'fans', 'think', 'served', 'respectable', 'homage', 'only', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'four', 'years', 'see', 'installment', 'Abrams', 'focusing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'next', 'Star', 'Trek', 'will', 'need', 'pass', 'director', 'happen', 'strong', 'foundation', 'been', 'laid', 'here', 'alternate', 'crew', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'new', 'stories', 'adventures', 'be', 'more', 'films', 'tv', 'novels', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'be', 'going', 'see', 'one', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'theater', 'especially', 'IMAX', '3D', 'screening', 'was', 'nice', 'first', 'hour', 'forgot', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '3D', 'necessary', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'exciting', 'sequel.Review', 'previously', 'posted', 'SciFiChick']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Abrams writes still has a lot of the borrowed items from the original TV and movies to make the film interesting to fans, yet for those not into the ""canon,"" the film stands on its own as an interesting science fiction film.** Spoilers **As you may have heard by now, the Botany Bay was discovered earlier than in the original time-line and someone who knows better wants to militarize the Federation and wants to use Khan for that purpose.  Let's get a man who knows how a military mind works and use him to handle the Klingon threat.Quite a story!** End Spoilers **Relationships:The film is very character-driven.  Now this may seem at odds to you if you enjoy a film full of special effects and warp-speed ships.  Even so Kirk is the same brash self who will break the rules if it means saving a life.The film starts out with Kirk swiping a holy scroll from natives - white, wild natives with eyes that blink backwards  -- weird, but I digress.  And somehow we have his science officer about to blow a cold fusion bomb into a volcano and save the planet.  Yeow!  And the Enterprise having the ability to land on the surface of a planet was a new look as well.Some fans squawk about Spock having a relationship with Uhura. First, it's not that unheard of.  Remember in the original series with Apollo?  And second, it's done in a tasteful manner and really could have been cut out altogether!The primary relationship of course is the Kirk/Spock dynamic.  As in the original series, Kirk, Spock and at times McCoy really go at it.  Would have liked this to have been better scripted with more banter and some humor injected here.The other relation is between Khan (played coolly by Cumberbatch) and the Federation - playing on others emotions, playing them to get what he wants - fascinating character.  As Kirk, he cares about his crew - frozen and awaiting revival - and besides wanting revenge on the Federation, he wants Kirk - very dead!Cons:  Scotty in this film is a riot of a Scotman - but Chekov not so much.  Not all characters come off well.  Would have liked to have seen some more romance with the Carol Marcus character.  Ah, well.Special Effects:  See the film on the big IMAX screen.  The cost is prohibitive but the effects are well worth it.  The chase through a pink/purple Peter Maxx-like jungle, the new ""warp speed"" and the speed chasing with Klingon space cruisers is worth the price.Make-Up!:  The Klingons, must mention the Klingons.  They make a brief and exciting entrance half-way through the film as they confront a powerless shuttle containing Kirk and a few hand-picked men - who smartly took off their red shirts, LOL - and as in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the view of Klingons have again changed.Music!:  The score is excellently done - the mix throughout was amazing and fit each scene well.  Alexander Courage's score is inserted where appropriate.  Stay for the end credits and listen to the coda.  Awesome stuff.Bottom Line:  A must-see especially for ""Wrath of Khan"" fans.  You'll see many similarities to an interesting story that will keep you on the edge throughout.Recommend:Star Trek II: The Wrath of KhanStar Trek Countdown to Darkness #1 Enterprise Edition (Exclusive Variant Cover) (Star Trek: Countdown to Darkness)",5,Boldly Go See This Film!,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,3436,"['[', 'Review', 'Theatrical', 'Version', 'IMAX', ']', '**', 'Spoilers', '**Into', 'Darkness', 'excellent', 'follow-up', '2009', 'film', 'Star', 'Trek.The', 'alternate', 'history', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'still', 'lot', 'borrowed', 'items', 'original', 'TV', 'movies', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'fans', 'yet', 'not', 'canon', 'film', 'own', 'interesting', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', '**', 'Spoilers', '**As', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'now', 'Botany', 'Bay', 'was', 'discovered', 'earlier', 'original', 'time-line', 'someone', 'who', 'better', 'militarize', 'Federation', 'use', 'Khan', 'purpose', 'Let', 'get', 'man', 'who', 'how', 'military', 'mind', 'works', 'use', 'handle', 'Klingon', 'threat.Quite', 'story', '**', 'End', 'Spoilers', '**Relationships', 'film', 'very', 'character-driven', 'Now', 'may', 'seem', 'odds', 'enjoy', 'film', 'full', 'special', 'effects', 'warp-speed', 'ships', 'Even', 'so', 'Kirk', 'same', 'brash', 'self', 'who', 'will', 'break', 'rules', 'saving', 'life.The', 'film', 'out', 'Kirk', 'swiping', 'holy', 'scroll', 'natives', 'white', 'wild', 'natives', 'eyes', 'blink', 'backwards', 'weird', 'digress', 'somehow', 'have', 'science', 'officer', 'blow', 'cold', 'fusion', 'bomb', 'volcano', 'save', 'planet', 'Yeow', 'Enterprise', 'having', 'ability', 'land', 'surface', 'planet', 'was', 'new', 'look', 'well.Some', 'fans', 'squawk', 'Spock', 'having', 'relationship', 'Uhura', 'First', 'not', 'unheard', 'Remember', 'original', 'series', 'Apollo', 'second', 'done', 'tasteful', 'manner', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'altogether', 'primary', 'relationship', 'course', 'Kirk/Spock', 'dynamic', 'original', 'series', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'times', 'McCoy', 'really', 'go', 'Would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'scripted', 'more', 'banter', 'humor', 'injected', 'here.The', 'other', 'relation', 'Khan', 'played', 'coolly', 'Cumberbatch', 'Federation', 'playing', 'others', 'emotions', 'playing', 'get', 'what', 'fascinating', 'character', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'frozen', 'awaiting', 'revival', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'Federation', 'Kirk', 'very', 'dead', 'Cons', 'Scotty', 'film', 'riot', 'Scotman', 'Chekov', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'characters', 'come', 'off', 'well', 'Would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'romance', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'character', 'Ah', 'well.Special', 'Effects', 'See', 'film', 'big', 'IMAX', 'screen', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'effects', 'are', 'well', 'chase', 'pink/purple', 'Peter', 'Maxx-like', 'jungle', 'new', 'warp', 'speed', 'speed', 'chasing', 'Klingon', 'space', 'cruisers', 'price.Make-Up', 'Klingons', 'must', 'mention', 'Klingons', 'make', 'brief', 'exciting', 'entrance', 'half-way', 'film', 'confront', 'powerless', 'shuttle', 'containing', 'Kirk', 'few', 'hand-picked', 'men', 'who', 'smartly', 'took', 'off', 'red', 'shirts', 'LOL', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'view', 'Klingons', 'have', 'again', 'changed.Music', 'score', 'excellently', 'done', 'mix', 'was', 'amazing', 'fit', 'scene', 'well', 'Alexander', 'Courage', 'score', 'inserted', 'where', 'appropriate', 'Stay', 'end', 'credits', 'listen', 'coda', 'Awesome', 'stuff.Bottom', 'Line', 'must-see', 'especially', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'see', 'many', 'similarities', 'interesting', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'throughout.Recommend', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'KhanStar', 'Trek', 'Countdown', 'Darkness', '1', 'Enterprise', 'Edition', 'Exclusive', 'Variant', 'Cover', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Countdown', 'Darkness']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I am a DIE HARD trek fan. Been watching since i was 5 years old, which was right about the time the series ended. I have watched every Movie, spin off, and now yet another adaptation of my beloved show, only to see i was ecstatic at the portrayal of things, with some gripes (mostly minor) that exist solely because i try not to be a purist, but as a sci fi fan you just cannot help it sometimes.The action, the re telling of the story, and Cumberbatchs' homage to the timeless Montalban villain, left you really appreciating the herculean task that Abrams took on, and that, given what, when, and where he had to work it, he did a great job. I look forward to more films, but will be hesitant, since hollywoods endless need for money ruins even the mighty phoenix's ability to rise from the ashes.One can debate that Pine or Quinto didnt deliver this, or that, as you can pick apart anything, but as much as i did not want to like Quinto as Spock, i found myself warming to this re imagined version of him as somehow (i know its blasphemy) more human.

Into Darkness has about as much science fiction and boldly going as the recent James Bond, Skyfall, which is to say ... sadly ... none.This terrible writing team has contrived a tapestry of action with artificial amped-up crisis after crisis--- the entire movie is essentially action scenes with a couple of pauses for clich&eacute;d dramatic beats--- ""You're a loose cannon!"" ""This time ... it's personal!"" ""Vulcans should be more emotional.""Most of the cast is terrible cartoon caricature (Scotty & Bones are abysmal Saturday Night Live sketch performances), except Greenwood as Pike (this actor is directorproof, great in Exotica) and Kirk and Spock are good enough to keep me interested at a very low level.The things lifted from Wrath of Khan are numerous and embarrassing and exemplify everything that is wrong with Hollywood and the remake/reboot machine: No CREATIVITY anywhere.

1589219,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B009934S5M,Sean Pasek,"[3, 5]","Star Trek: Into Darkness is one of the best films of the Star Trek series of movies.  To my mind, the only two films that surpass it are Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek: First Contact.  The movie is very solid on story, characterization, and special effect laden action sequences that never overshadow the story or the characters.There are two main things that have made Star Trek an iconic epic over the years.  The first is Gene Roddenberry's vision of a hope for a better tomorrow; that mankind is not only looking to explore strange new worlds, but to explore the unknown possibilities of existence.  Perhaps Q in the final episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" summed up Roddenberry's vision better than anyone when he states: ...""the exploration that awaits you is not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence.""The other main component is the relationship between three men that served to demonstrate an unconditional brotherly/comrade love between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  In many ways, these three characters cover the spectrum of characteristics.  Spock, the ever-logical Vulcan constantly in pursuit of knowledge and logic and always seeming to criticize humans for their irrationality and ever-present emotions.  And yet, we have seen Spock behave almost emotionally when he has saved the lives of his friends countless times.  McCoy, the irascible ""country"" doctor who covers the opposite end of the spectrum from Spock as the one who yields more to emotional reactions.  But under McCoy's bickering and arguing is a powerful love that he as for both of his friends.  In the middle of that spectrum, we have Kirk, who is as prone to using logic and common sense as he is to using his gut-feeling and intuition.  And Kirk has an almost obsessive love for his shipmates, his ship, and his friends.The film takes place very early on in Kirk's career.  In fact, he has yet to perform his legendary ""five year mission.""  So, one has to realize that Kirk is still a fledgling captain, regardless of how tactically brilliant he may be.  The same can be said of Spock who is still trying to control the emotions that always seem to be percolating just under the surface.  His relationship with Uhura is still alive and somewhat well.  The couple's relationship will be tested a bit during this film.  And McCoy is still the ever-complaining questioning doctor who seems to have a millions sayings ready to be unleashed at any given moment.  Because the characters are young and new, their relationship has not yet had enough time to gell into the iconic relationship that we know of these three men.  That being said, there is an emotional moment that takes place in the film that, unfortunately, isn't as powerful as it could have been because of the absence of the strength of that relationship.  I had almost hoped that such a moment might be savored for another movie later on when the viewer has a chance to become more emotionally invested with its characters and be able to feel more strongly what the characters are feeling.  On a more optimistic note as a result, a powerful bond and friendship will be solidified.The story takes place when Starfleet utilizes a man who is renowned for his intelligence and tactical abilities.  However, the big prize of Starfleet inevitably turns upon his former masters, and Kirk and company are dispatched to deal with him.  Obviously things are not what they seem, and Kirk is pitted against all odds.  Anyone who is familiar with the story of Star Trek II will remember the famed Kobayashi Maru test (which was also utilized in the last film).  In many ways, this outing serves as Kirk's Kobayashi Maru...a veritable baptism by fire.  You might also notice some other parallel elements from that film as well, which I won't disclose here for those who haven't seen this film yet.The cast of the film are as good as they were in the previous film.  Chris Pine is a fantastic Captain Kirk.  He's arrogant and cocky, and Pine has a real gift for comedic facial expressions and timing.  And we get to see Kirk begin to feel his affinity for his crew and his ship.Zachary Quinto is playing Spock as well as he can.  I don't know if people understand how difficult a role this is.  Leonard Nimoy directed Robin Curtis (Lt. Saavik) in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.  He stated, ""to play a Vulcan you must have the look of a thousand years of wisdom in your eyes.""  It is not nearly as easy as it sounds.  But again, Spock is very young here in this entry.  In short, however, Leonard Nimoy really did make Spock nearly impossible for anyone else to play with as much complexity and depth that he did.Benedict Cumberbatch is the surprise new character here.  He plays ""John Harrison"" with savagery and intelligence that really added some wonderful dimensions to the character.  ""Harrison"" is a man who is like a grandmaster chess player; someone who is always a number of moves ahead of everyone else, and it is fun to see if Kirk can find a way to outwit him.  I only wished that he had been given more screen time.  I really wanted to see a bit more exploration of this character.I still think that of all of the characters to really ""nail"" the interpretations of their previous counterparts, Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy is still the best.  His speech pattern and mannerisms are all nearly dead-on.  He isn't in this film nearly as much as I would have liked, but every scene he is in is a welcome one.J.J. Abrams has succeeded in breathing life back into a franchise that was all but dead.  This film is fun, exciting, and even thought-provoking when we consider the kind of people that we help to create.  If you enjoyed the last film, it is nearly a certainty that you will enjoy this one as much, if not more so.  And the fun part is, there is still plenty of ""Star Trek"" left to be told.",5,Star Trek Scores Again With a Film That All But Surpasses the First Film,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,5905,"['Star',

I love Star Trek, and consider myself a Star Trek geek, but I don't memorize trivia or dress up or anything. I just grew up watching Star Trek Next Generation and the others. I thought from the minute this movie started, it was fantastic. I also love all the new super hero movies, and if you like those, you will probably like this. You don't even have to know anything about Star Trek, but it will help you to get some of the jokes and understand the personalities of the main characters. I love JJ Abrams' new version of Star Trek. It's for a ""modern,"" younger audience; it's full of huge, action-packed fantastic scenes. Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant and sexy as Khan. I love Chris Pine as Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto is an awesome Spock. Simon Pegg as Scotty is fantastic and he has a great story in this one.

1589237,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B009934S5M,shaun brammer,"[6, 8]","When I first watched Star Trek, the J.J. Abrams reboot, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked it. The action was action like, and the effects were pretty stunning, and everything looked pretty cool, but I was troubled by the story and the characters. I kept thinking, that is not how it happened and Kirk doesn&#8217;t act like that. Of course, I was unaware of the alternate time line. When that was made clear I started to accept the film a little more. In the end I decided it was ok and when I found a copy, used, for five dollars, I bought it. However, I still had lingering doubts as to this film really being apart of the Star Trek lineage. It seemed too different from the vision of that Roddenberry gave the world.Then Star Trek: Into Darkness came out. I thought that I would see it in movie theaters, because I have not seen a Star Trek film in a theater since The Search for Spock. However, I began to see the trailers for the film, and I was not impressed. I saw an underwear clad Dr. Marcus. I saw Spock being argumentative with Kirk and Uhura. I saw a very white Khan. I saw a womanizing Kirk, womanizing to the Beastie Boys. I saw enough that I decided I would not spend the money to see it in the theaters. I would wait and rent it through Netflix, so I didn&#8217;t pay any extra money to see it. I am glad I waited.When it finally was available to me, for it had a very long wait, I sat down to watch it with an open mind. I really wanted to like this film. I don&#8217;t want Star Trek disappearing. I want the franchise to continue on and grow. I had high hopes with the last film that this would be the beginning of a new generation, if you will, of Star Trek fans and projects that would keep the franchise alive and well and Roddenberry&#8217;s vision clear. Star Trek: Into Darkness dashed those hopes against Hollywood&#8217;s rock solid foundation of sexist, macho, adolescent, white washing, token minority, marketing philosophy.I can&#8217;t say that there was any major flaw in the film that went against the Star Trek pantheon. Though I was bothered by the similarity of the Star Fleet dress uniforms to that of the Imperial uniforms from Star Wars. Can Abrams not keep his movies straights? Also, what the hell did he do to the Klingons? When did they hide their faces from battle? When did they become such push overs? And the phasers, where are they? Everyone is using projectile weapons, even the starships are spitting out colored bullets. So, yes, there were major stylistic flaws.Uniforms and Klingons aside, what happened in the film were things that happened in other Star Trek films and the various TV shows. However, it was how this film did those things that makes the difference. It is like the difference between dancing and dancing with class. Kirk does have a way with woman, and woman dressed provocatively have been a staple of Star Trek. However, the old Kirk didn&#8217;t get jiggy with it to the Beastie Boys with two women at the same time, not classy. The old Kirk liked his women, but one at a time and they were special to him. The provocatively dressed women, were just that, provocatively dressed, not in their underwear or naked. The old Kirk also had restraint, he didn&#8217;t act like a frat boy, the way the new Kirk does. The new Kirk has no self control, just acts on impulse at warp factor nine. The old Kirk always showed intelligence and thought, before taking any action.Spock always defended his logic, but never argued it. He never bickered, he did not allow himself to be drawn into petty squabbles. The new Spock plays out like a tight wad who always has to have things his own way, a Sheldon Cooper with pointy ears. The old Spock only lost his cool under extreme circumstances, pon farr, or freaky plants. Now, you might say the death of Kirk would be a pretty extreme circumstance, but I say that Spock is still Vulcan, alternate time line or not. The new Spock is suicidal, worrisome, and has anger management issues, at least for a Vulcan. In short he is a basket case who makes a poor poster child for logic and reason.As for the rest of the crew; Sulu is barely explored as a character, he quickly becomes a token minority with a two dimensional structure and has little to do with story, unlike all the other films. The old Scotty was a knowledgable cool headed engineer, who controlled his area of the ship with a steady hand and only gave the captain overly cautious estimates. The new one is a spaz. He does nothing be freak out and run from one place to another, while never shutting his mouth. Abrams has turned Scotty into the JarJar Binks of the Star Trek universe. The old Uhura was a forthright woman, who played her part in the missions. She was a professional, who didn&#8217;t allow herself to become distracted by the dangers that threaten the ship and crew. If she had something to say she would say it. The new one is another token minority fleshed out just to add to Spock&#8217;s personality, rather then having one of her own. She becomes overly emotional over Spock, only appears or reacts to anything in relation to Spock. Also, Dr. Marcus is reduced to eye candy for adolescent boys who acts somewhat childish, especially when her father shows up. Daddy, she calls him daddy. Also, why is the white woman the only who gets striped down? The new bones if the closest to the old Bones, however the new Bones, like everything else, is over the top. The genuine worrywart personality of Dr. McCoy form the 60&#8217;s was transformed into a hypochondriac Rodney Dangerfield.Let me talk about Khan for a moment. Khan Noonien Singh, the name alone should suggest that this person is of Indian decent. Ricardo Montalban, who originally played Khan, while not Indian, was Mexican at least. He was closer to the appearance of what one would think of when thinking of Khan. While Benedict Cumberbatch, a great actor, is a pasty white Englishman. I could not help but think that this was a white wash. When Montalban was selected to play Khan it was for a small TV show back in the 60&#8217;s, so the pool of Indians to play the roll was most likely non-existent. In today&#8217;s world, finding an actor, who is Indian, to play an Indian, shouldn&#8217;t be all that hard. Also, the battle of wits that the old Kirk and Khan engaged in was turned into an ugly brute force cage match by Abrams. So, you mean to tell me that the best a superhuman with a super brain can come up with is punching and kicking? No wonder it took him so long to escape from Admiral Marcus. Again, taking away that level of intelligence and class from the dance.That leads me to the last aspect I wish to touch upon, there is no intelligence in these films of Abrams. Star Trek has always been marked with a certain level of intelligence and class, even when there was action. Abrams has taken away all the intelligence, there is now no difference between these Star Trek films and other Hollywood muscle movies with womanizing men and half dressed overly sexualized women. In conclusion, I am not happy with Abrams&#8217;s vision of Star Trek. This is not the Trek I knew and loved and he has not taken it in a positive direction in my opinion. I can liken it to a bad impression. Imagine someone performing an impression of a famous person. While they say all the right things, they say them all the wrong way. That is what it was like watching the J.J. Abrams remakes. A really bad impression from someone who hasn&#8217;t studied their subject.Perhaps it is time for the fans to take it from here and make Youtube shows of Trek if the big companies refuse to bring it back to TV? I have started watching the progress of a production called Star Trek: Renegades, which is using the talents of Walter Koenig, Tim Russ, Robert Picardo, Gary Graham, Manu Intiraymi. I believe they are trying to get CBS to pick it up and be the company to bring Star Trek back to the small screen. I already feel that this will be closer to the Trek spirit than Abrams can ever get.",3,Not My Trek,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,8025,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'Star', 'Trek', 'J.J.', 'Abrams',

I disagree. the visuals were A-1 FANTASTIC ! and the story was pretty believable. This new set of movies isnt following the old one to a T and i think thats great, new stories or variations for a new generation. My dad went on and on about all the old cues from the old movies that were injected into this one (although i dont know them) he sure did pick up on them.

Henderson,"[1, 2]","The movie was entertaining, but it seemed problematic to me in several ways:1) Several times, they bemoaned that doing such and such would make them 'gasp' military, as if that's a bad thing.  Historically, Star Fleet IS a military organization, that just happens to do a lot of research and exploration along the way.  If that weren't so, then certainly the Kobayashi Maru exercise would not be focused on defeating several Klingon cruisers.  Luckily, the Enterprise IS a cruiser that just happens to have considerable scientific and exploratory capabilities.  Many of the ships in Star Fleet having nothing but a military/patrol role -- and that's OK.2) The Enterprise is an exo-atmospheric vessel -- built IN space because it's not designed to deal with atmospheric stresses.  Thus, landing on a planet would be a very bad idea, and underwater even worse.3) If your chief engineer disappears, you don't send  a junior helmsman officer to take over, you have the senior person in engineering take over as acting, even if they're an NCO.4) The notion that shooting a long range photon torpedo at Chronos might cause a war, but landing an armed landing party won't is ridiculous.  That's why we use drones to take out targets in uncooperative countries.5) The idea that an emergency demands the gathering of all captains AND 1st officers in one room is a ludicrous plot device made even dumber by having that room be hugely exposed.  Star Flleet and all its ships have advanced communications and holographic capabilities -- they could just &#34;meet&#34; virtually, or they could just have the Captains so the 1st Officers are ready on the ships.  Finally, if you do decide to put your key personnel all in one place when under attack, you do it in a hardenened bunker, not a room with windows.",4,"Entertaining, but problematic",1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,1795,"['movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'seemed', 'problematic', 'several', 'ways:1', 'Several', 'times', 'bemoaned', 'doing', 'such', 'such', 'would', 'make', 'military', 'bad', 'thing', 'Historically', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'military', 'organization', 'just', 'do', 'lot', 'research', 'exploration', 'way', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'then', 'certainly', 'Kobayashi', 'Maru', 'exercise', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'focused', 'defeating', 'several', 'Klingon', 'cruisers', 'Luckily', 'Enterprise', 'cruiser', 'just', 'have', 'considerable', 'scientific', 'exploratory', 'capabilities', 'Many', 'ships', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'having', 'nothing', 'military/patrol', 'role', 'OK.2', 'Enterprise', 'exo-atmospheric', 'vessel', 'built', 'IN', 'space', 'not', 'designed', 'deal', 'atmospheric', 'stresses', 'Thus', 'landing', 'planet', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'idea', 'underwater', 'even', 'worse.3', 'chief', 'engineer', 'disappears', 'do', ""n't"", 'send', 'junior', 'helmsman', 'officer', 'take', 'over', 'have', 'senior', 'person', 'engineering', 'take', 'acting', 'even', ""'re"", 'NCO.4', 'notion', 'shooting', 'long', 'range', 'photon', 'torpedo', 'Chronos', 'might', 'cause', 'war', 'landing', 'armed', 'landing', 'party', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ridiculous', 'why', 'use', 'drones', 'take', 'out', 'targets', 'uncooperative', 'countries.5', 'idea', 'emergency', 'gathering', 'captains', '1st', 'officers', 'one', 'room', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'device', 'made', 'even', 'dumber', 'having', 'room', 'be', 'hugely', 'exposed', 'Star', 'Flleet', 'ships', 'have', 'advanced', 'communications', 'holographic', 'capabilities', 'could', 'just', '34', 'meet', '34', 'virtually', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'Captains', '1st', 'Officers', 'are', 'ready', 'ships', 'Finally', 'do', 'decide', 'put', 'key', 'personnel', 'one', 'place', 'when', 'attack', 'do', 'hardenened', 'bunker', 'not', 'room', 'windows']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Perhaps they should have taken a shortcut through the center of the universe.All this aside I must say that the second installment had me completely engaged and refreshingly I had no idea what was around the next corner. The movie in my opinion was absolutely brilliant with so much to offer both Trek fans and non fans both.  The respect for story continuity and Trek lore is very evident and the crew work so well together it's amazing to watch something so well orchestrated. Of course my favorite scenes are those of the bridge and the Enterprise herself which this movie does so well in illustrating just how versatile and multipurpose the ship is, taking away some limitations that the older movies seem to impose on her.Just an amazing work by J.J.Abrahms and his team.

1589256,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,B009934S5M,Skywalker,"[3, 4]","...and most fans probably imagined it already: the Star Trek films usually alternate between good and bad, thus since Star Trek X turned out quite good, the next one couldn't be but a disappointment.In the first place, I can't understand why it had to be 3D filming. The movie is already packed full of action, hypnotizing music, heart-wrenching drama, images flitting so quickly by that you can hardly discern them properly: but I guess it had to be in 3D because today's moviegoers, spoilt as they are, might otherwise get horribly bored.The pictures are almost always stunning, as is the music. I liked the portrayal of the villain, his motives were more believable than in Star Trek II; and a few scenes were really moving, like Pike's death. But it more or less ends there.To enlist all that I found disputable:1. The opening scene - these funny aliens looked more ridiculous than any whose sight we had to endure during the original series. Having so much more budget today, is that all the filmmakers can come up with?2. Spock's ""pose"" in the volcano when he briefly thought he would have to die - my god, how pathetic.3. Harrisons attack on the Starfleet elite: Kirk screams to the others ""Down!"" but doesn't duck or jump to the side himself (?) Later he manages to damage Harrison's helicopter, but when it flies exactly in his direction and crashes into the wall right near him, he just stands rooted to the ground. Is the man suicidal? (Knowing the movie's end: he probably is. But then, why is such a disturbed man allowed to captain a ship with over 400 crew members?!)4. Later, Kirk tells Spock he will miss him. Miss the man who cost him his captaincy?5. Spock and Uhura, two - as is well known - discreet, reasonable and practical persons must carry out their emotional quarrel while they are on the way to a dangerous mission and while their captain is present? And why doesn't he tell them to be quiet and keep such conversations for later?6. Spock' behaviour towards Uhura is cool bordering on uncaring; on the other hand he begins to develop strong feelings for Kirk. There is absolutely no explanation for this.7. Kirk beats Harrison at least 10 times before his comrades utter the first word of protest. Excuse me, what happened to morals?8. Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, but he doesn't bear the smallest similarity to Ricardo Montalban. Why couldn't he simply be some other villain, why in the world did it have to be Khan?9. Dear me, Kirk's and Khan's endless flight from one space ship to the other. Doesn't the director know when it's time to yell ""Cut!""?10. After their helmets were already about to burst, Kirk and Khan tumble into the foreign starship full tilt, skidding and rolling over several times. Of course, none of them loses an eye through split glass or is otherwise hurt.11. At the end of the movie - of course - Kirk can be reanimated. How could he not be brain dead yet after all of that time?! I will move to the 23rd century now, it seems they can even resuscitate people there...12. Action, action and more action. What I liked in particular about Star Trek were the intelligent dialogues, the relationships of the characters and the philosophical, sometimes harassing social questions it dealt with. What has become of all that?13. Character design: it has hardly anything left to do with the characters thought up by Roddenberry. Uhura is a ""contemporary"", emancipated woman, and additionally she can't hold a candle to Nichelle Nichols' beauty. Kirk has almost no kindness to show, only heaps of arrogance. Spock is by far too emotional - I will concede that he is traumatized through the loss of his home world, but nevertheless, is that necessary? Scott is markedly jovial, since when was he supposed to be the story's clown? Apart from that, the actor looks by far too small and thin for the role.14. During the original series and the films the characters hardly had a chance to develop. Here they have the chance, being still very young. And what happens? They used to repeat the same mistakes, here they can develop - and then they repeat the same mistakes anyway.15. At last, Carol Marcus has her big performance. Only this reduces the film to the usual Hollywood pattern - hero wins over the villain, saves the world and the beautiful (blonde) maiden.

That may be the case with every film and thus a statement of the obvious, but I think that it is especially true with regard to this one. If one is just looking for an exciting, briskly-paced film with plenty of action, an attractive cast and some great visuals, then Star Trek Into Darkness will deliver. It is certainly not guilty of being boring, as some previous ST films have been.On the other hand, if one is looking for a well-written screenplay or a new-ground-breaking story, those things are not to be found here. I will grant that this film attempts to deal with some current issues such as terrorism and militarism, but it does not develop those themes nearly as well as it could have it if was not so busy shamelessly, clumsily recycling elements from Stark Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Now, I certainly enjoy seeing familiar faces show up again and graceful nods to the past. But there is a big difference between that done well, and the way that it is done in this film. This smacks of laziness,unoriginality and really just a profound lack of either comprehension and/or care for what Star Trek is really about, i.e. exploring new territory and addressing issues with eloquence. What a frustratingly wasted opportunity, considering the fresh reboot that this franchise has potentially been given.Specifically, the use of Benedict Cumberbatch's character is in my personal view an unforgivable sin. He is a very fine actor and if the screenplay would only continue on the path that it starts out on with regard to the character in the early parts of the film, things could be great. But for some reason, the writers/director/producers felt compelled to be clever or something and twist the character in an entirely arbitrary, disrespectful and ultimately ineffective way. I do not like to be very negative, but in this case, it simply cannot go unnoted.On the brighter (okay, darker) flip side, there is one scene in which this film really breaks through into the realm of truly, insanely good:SPOILER********************************************************When Khan kills Admiral Marcus on the dark bridge of the warship, as Kirk watches stunned and Carol screams like she's in a slasher film, for a brief moment STID lives up to its name and gives us something truly crazy and new. It's violent, but it's sharply composed and purely effective. A film full of that sort of vivid content would have impressed me.*********************END SPOILER**********To wrap up, Star Trek Into Darkness is fine as a casual, do-not-think-about-it too much ""spaceships and lasers"" action film. But it is not a good Star Trek film. Worth watching at least once, if only to form an objective personal opinion? Sure. But I am sincerely hoping for something much better the next time around. Star Trek deserves better.Note: The basic DVD-only version of this film does not include any special features to speak of.

I was gaga over the first one even if it included a big dud of a villain in Nero. This new one, inexplicably titled ""Into Darkness,"" moves to re-establish the trinity of Kirk/Spock/Bones as Kirk/Spock/Uhura. And that's the good news! Look, Nichelle Nichols was an inspiration to me and one of the main reasons I pursued a career in the entertainment industry (I did fine, but I did grow tired of the rampant drug abuse that permeates that field). As much as Uhura was a ""force"" to be reckoned with, using her femme charms in part V ""The Final Frontier"" to devastating effect, these new movies have transformed Uhura into a powerhouse. I love the scene in ""Into Darkness"" where she stands her ground while confronting a demonic Klingon warrior. Oh but they paired her as a subservient girlfriend to Mr. Logic himself, Spock. Even Sybok would likely have found her too headstrong, haha!I wish they had done something other than essentially remake The Wrath of Khan, but what else is new? I will buck the current trend among femmes my age (or shall I say ""vintage""? *wink*) and say that I do not understand the fuss over Benedict Cumberbatch. Great name, blank-slate screen presence.

Always get a hoot out of the hyper-sexed Captain Kirk: the guy is always on the lookout; it's a wonder he doesn't have 20 babies by now. Regarding the story, it was okay.  I'm a Star Trek fan from way back, and the actors who play the roles presently are all competent actors. In this story, director/writer, whoever, seemed to be trying to age some of the leads by giving them older hair styles. I know Bones is a complainer but totally unbelievable that he'd what, volunteer to go along with Captain Kirk in the opening sequence, just to complain, complain, complain while they're running for their lives. Just don't think a guy would behave that way, even though the old television character was somewhat like that; would've been nice to keep a touch of that but have him make sense, in other words not have him complain for the sake of complaining. Also, have no idea why Ohura and Spock have hooked up, absolutely no chemistry. I'm a big Spock fan and I have no idea why the actress playing Ohura would fancy him, no idea whatsoever, and this is coming from someone who likes Spock.

My husband and I both wanted to see this movie due to our previous experience of liking the 2009 Star Trek film (it was one of the first movies we caught during the summer 2009 season). With that said, my husband's favorite character portrayal was the skillful acting of Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. I can understand this because of the Kahn character being depicted as maniacally sinister but intellectually brilliant in challenging Spock and Kirk. As for me, my favorite character portrayals are a tie between Chris Pine's Captain Kirk portrayal, Zachary Quinto's Spock depiction, and Zoe Saldana's acting incarnation as Uhura. I enjoyed how the characters of Kirk, Uhura, and Spock brilliantly managed to keep their personal and professional lives separate for the greater good of saving the Enterprise.  There is even more action in this film and the carefully calculated emergence of new characters such as Dr. Carol Marcus, a  Science Officer (played proficiently by Alice Eve). The following actors also make significant contributions to the film's plot: Karl Urban, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, Bruce Greenwood, Peter Weller, Noel Clarke, Nazneen Contractor, and Joseph Gatt.

This movie was excellent.Here's why:- The story was engaging, exciting, and had plenty of edge of your seat moments.- The way it wove the new story together using prior movie and TV themes to build on was kind of genius. Those who know Star Trek will enjoy that.- It had humor with a few good laughs and chuckles, but it also brought tears to my eyes.- I loved the way they developed the relationships between the main characters, especially between Spock and Kirk. I very much disagree with the poster who said there wasn't enough character development. I felt it was quite the opposite.- There were surprises. Especially one big one, which I won't reveal. I enjoyed that this movie wasn't predictable.- The casting was spot on. It's so believable that these are the young versions of Spock, Kirk, etc.- The acting was superb.What else can you want!I saw it at an IMAX 3-D theater, and I'd highly recommend that. The 3-D was phenomenal on this huge screen. There were moments when I could imagine I was in space.I think that Star Trek fans, as well as those who are new to Star Trek, will enjoy the movie.

1589290,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B009934S5M,Steve Douglas,"[3, 5]","Yes, I know this borrowed so heavily from the original Wrath of Khan that it can be considered a prequel and much talk has already been provided regarding that issue, as well as various summaries and opinions.  I will forego that and write regarding only the quality of the disc on Blu Ray.  I have not watched the 3D version yet so this review focuses only upon the 2D version watched on a new Panasonic ZT series 65"" monitor.VIDEO.....You couldn't have had a film such as this without the extensive use of CGI and other special effects.  That said, the various effects do not cheapen the image with poor production like you might see in those 'Sharkanodo vs DinoCroc'  sci fi films you watch on the Sci Fi channel.  All special effects are done very well in my opinion and add to the story line.  A huge problem with special effects laden films is that often the film becomes about the FX and not the characters or story line.  Not so with Star Trek into Darkness.  The encode to Blu Ray provides a very clean image with excellent contrast and color resolution.  The majority of the color grading is fairly cool to the viewer but tends to warm up with close ups.  At no point did I see any distracting or noticeable artifacts or dirt in the imaging and details, even in the shadow areas, are easily discernible.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low thirties and while some dismiss the Mbps rate as being unimportant, I find that the higher it is, the better the imaging.  While you may or may not like the film as I did, the video transfer to Blu Ray is quite excellent.AUDIO.....Was very pleased that both a 5.1 and 7.1 mix was offered and a lossless audio codec was used.  I watched the film using the 7.1 audio for my 7.1 home theater setup.  There is so much going on in this film's audio mix that the dialogue and foley fx battle for your attention.  This doesn't mean that you have to adjust your remote's volume control once set as both dialogue and foley audio are properly balanced, it's just that during the many action scenes the surround audio fully envelopes you and creates one of those 'You are there' moments.  There is a great amount of discreet directionality to all 6 of the surrounds and panning from front to rear and rear to front is frequent.  Never the less, the dialogue center channel has most of the heavy lifting as it does in every movie and it does so just fine.  The LFE sub channel will earn its stripes as it will be in constant use.  I would suggest that viewers be careful regarding their sub channel as I often find friends who have it set far too high.  The sub should not be noticeable as a discreet channel as low end bass is non-directional.  The mix of audio was simply excellent in 7.1 and I can safely come to the conclusion is that if you have a 5.1 system, as most do, then you will find the directionality of the audio to be one of the best in your collection.  The lossless audio really deserves 5 stars;EXTRAS.....There are a number of extras on the Blu Ray regarding many aspects of what it took to make this film.  However, I did not have the time as yet to watch them so I will not comment upon the quality of these usually short docs.  However, there are also several 'previews' of other films that come up when you put the blu ray in.  This annoys the heck out of me as it forces you to  pay for nothing more than advertising which takes up valuable disc space causing for even more compression to be placed upon the film you are buying.

1589293,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B009934S5M,Steven Aldersley,"[12, 19]","I'm old enough to remember the original Star Trek series, and I have a deep affection for it despite its obvious flaws. I was ready to despise this latest reboot when Star Trek was released in 2009, but some terrific choices were made and I left the theater grinning. I was delighted with the casting choices four years ago, and how this new version of Star Trek gave enough nods to the original without going over the top.So, I have been anticipating the release of Star Trek Into Darkness ever since the credits rolled on the last entry. I was not disappointed.What do you want from a Star Trek movie? The world has changed over the past 45 years, and action is an essential element of any science fiction movie. Special effects rule, and the budget can be enormous for proven franchises that simply can't fail at the box office. There is certainly no lack of action in this movie, and it doesn't waste any time in surfacing. Kirk and some of the crew are shown fleeing the inhabitants of a primitive planet, after trying to prevent a volcano from destroying it. The fast cuts look like something out of a Bourne movie, and provide the first adrenaline rush. There are no shortage of similar moments over the remaining two hours.While I loved Star Trek (2009), it was pretty light on story. It served as a vehicle to introduce the new crew, and did so splendidly, but the actual story wasn't particularly memorable. That's not to say that it wasn't tremendously enjoyable. What Into Darkness does is develop on that strong foundation. We learn more about the characters, and what binds them together, but this time we're also given a story with more depth.The story is built around the hunt for John Harrison, who is a man that seems out to destroy the Federation. Who is he? What are his motivations? Needless to say, Kirk is given the task of tracking him with the Enterprise and her crew. Expect chase scenes, fights, battles, and all the special effects you could possibly desire. It's what you won't expect that will make you smile most of all. The theme of family is used in various forms, as well as revenge and the lust for power.The great thing about this reboot is that, thanks to a plot device in the previous movie, anything can happen to the characters we know and love. Part of the fun is recognizing events and people that you know from other versions of the franchise, and seeing where their story deviates from the one you expect. Into Darkness introduces a couple of characters that you'll know, if you remember your Star Trek history. I wouldn't dream of ruining that surprise for you, so I'll leave it at that. You'll also an encounter an alien race that you might be familiar with.I've mentioned that the movie is action-packed. Its budget also means that the effects are superb. But don't make the mistake of thinking that Into Darkness is all action and no substance. There are several exchanges of dialogue which create genuine emotion. This cast can act. One example takes place in a bar between Pike and Kirk, and it's an excellent example of key characters forming a bond.My only disappointment with the 2009 movie is that Simon Pegg didn't seem like the best choice to play Scotty, but he won me over this time. My only criticism of the movie is that some of the key characters don't get enough screen time, but I am sure they will all have their moments to shine in future entries in the series. As with the original series, the relationships between Kirk, Spock and McCoy are vital, and I think all three actors do a great job portraying them. However, it's also wonderful to see characters like Uhura with more significant roles.There's really no way to explain the plot without giving away too much. If you enjoyed the first reboot, and like these actors, there's a strong chance that you will love Star Trek Into Darkness. It seemed to last about an hour, but had enough content for four hours. That's meant as a compliment. You won't see anyone washing dishes for 20 minutes in this movie.Where will the franchise go next? I hope that it is a long and glorious journey. I would happily watch another five movies with this crew, and can only hope that there won't be a four-year gap between them.Go and see this movie if you care about Star Trek in any way, because you'll have a lot of fun. Oh, and be prepared to see more lens flares. They are apparently here to stay.Overall score 4.5/5This is the first movie I have seen in theaters since Roger Ebert's passing. Normally I would head over to his site to see whether his opinion was close to mine.

(Fortunately, my wife agreed!) And I love it. It arrived on time and in good condition. It came in a large, Star Trek-themed box that I can't seem to throw away, and the phaser was inter-packaged separately from the Blu-ray case.The movie itself was an excellent Blu-ray transfer (sound and picture quality - 5 stars), and the phaser looks and feels amazing. It comes with a stand so it can be displayed 'standing up', which is how we have it. The phaser is hefty and solid-feeling, which I was very impressed with. And the front tip spins around to either the 'kill' or 'stun' mode, which I wasn't expecting. (You can see this 'flip' from 'kill' to 'stun' in the scene with Kirk and Benedict Cumberbatch have just arrived on the enemy Starfleet shit and are formulating a plan with Scotty.)The only -- and I really do mean ONLY -- reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because the phaser doesn't have...a trigger. To some, that may seem a petty complaint, but there you have it. I miss the trigger.But don't let this one niggly complaint dissuade you. If you're a Star Trek fan and like props, this is the edition for you. The phaser isn't some plasticky, schlocky giveaway -- it's a solid, well-built collectible.

1589306,A26MJME9IBNETY,B009934S5M,StrangePegs,"[5, 8]","What's the deal with meaningless titles? They annoy me. The title has no more to do with the movie than it could have to many movies. Like The Empire Strikes Back could have been called Into Darkness, and it would have held more meaning to the actual movie than this one. I get that it sounds cool, but, seriously, the title (of anything) ought to relate to the thing that's being titled in more than some vague way.Past that, though, the movie was pretty awesome. Abrams  knows how to bring the action and keep you tense and on the edge of your seat. And, hey, there was no red matter, this time, so double plus good. Without giving anything away, I loved best the role reversal of Spock and Kirk. That was pretty awesome.I have only two negatives (other than the title) at this point:1. I do not want to see ""old Spock"" pop up in every movie as their tiny ""god in a box."" I get that the fans love seeing Nimoy (I do; I get it), but, from a story perspective, it's gonna get old if they always contact him when they're in trouble.2. As much as I love Simon Pegg and love Simon Pegg as Scotty, he is the one character that doesn't quite feel right. he has moments where he feels like Scotty but, most of the time, the character seems off target. I don't blame this on Pegg, as he has no control over the writers having him do things that are not ""Scottyish.""Speaking of the characters, I still love Karl Urban the most. Man, he could be DeForest Kelley. I swear, I can't tell the difference; he's just like watching the original Bones at work. And they gave him the line! Well, not the line but a the line: ""I'm a doctor not a..."" It was awesome.Zachary Quinto comes in a close second to Urban on pulling off the channeling of the original character. Of course, he has had the privilege of actually working with Nimoy, so he wouldn't have an excuse to not be able to pull it off.And, well, then there's Benedict Cumberbatch who was a perfect match to the rest of the cast. Mostly, it's the voice. But he seems to be able to play any kind of role he wants to play (see War Horse and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to understand what I mean by that).And that's really about all I can say about the movie without giving stuff away, and I don't want to do that. As someone who is not really a Star Trek fan, I loved the movie. I do know that there are Trek fans out there that don't like what Abrams is doing, but, really, I'm not quite sure I get that, because he's really captured the heart of the original series with how closely they've managed to get the characters to their originals. It's actually enough that it makes me want to go back and watch those old episodes, and how much more successful can you be than that?Tribble!",5,Into Whatness?,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2724,"['What', 'deal', 'meaningless', 'titles', 'annoy', 'title', 'more', 'do', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'many', 'movies', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'more', 'meaning', 'actual', 'movie', 'one', 'get', 'cool', 'seriously', 'title', 'anything', 'ought', 'relate', 'thing', 'being', 'titled', 'more', 'vague', 'way.Past', 'though', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'Abrams', 'how', 'bring', 'action', 'keep', 'tense', 'edge', 'seat', 'hey', 'was', 'red', 'matter', 'time', 'so', 'double', 'good', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'loved', 'best', 'role', 'reversal', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome.I', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'negatives', 'other', 'title', 'point:1', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'old', 'Spock', 'pop', 'up', 'movie', 'tiny', 'god', 'box', 'get', 'fans', 'love', 'seeing', 'Nimoy', 'do', 'get', 'story', 'perspective', 'gon', 'get', 'old', 'always', 'contact', 'when', ""'re"", 'trouble.2', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'love', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Scotty', 'one', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'right', 'moments', 'where', 'Scotty', 'most', 'time', 'character', 'off', 'target', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Pegg', 'control', 'writers', 'having', 'do', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'Scottyish', 'Speaking', 'characters', 'still', 'love', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'most', 'Man', 'could', 'be', 'DeForest', 'Kelley', 'swear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'just', 'watching', 'original', 'Bones', 'work', 'gave', 'line', 'Well', 'not', 'line', 'line', ""'m"", 'doctor', 'not', 'was', 'awesome.Zachary', 'Quinto', 'close', 'second', 'Urban', 'pulling', 'off', 'channeling', 'original', 'character', 'course', 'had', 'privilege', 'actually', 'working', 'Nimoy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'excuse', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'well', 'then', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'who', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'rest', 'cast', 'Mostly', 'voice', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'kind', 'role', 'play', 'see', 'War', 'Horse', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'understand', 'what', 'mean', '.And', 'really', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'giving', 'stuff', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'loved', 'movie', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'Trek', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'that', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'Abrams', 'doing', 'really', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'get', 'really', 'captured', 'heart', 'original', 'series', 'how', 'closely', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'get', 'characters', 'originals', 'actually', 'enough', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'old', 'episodes', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'can', 'be', 'Tribble']",Star Trek Into Darkness

It's Kirk who dies saving the ship from a warp core breach brought on by Khan. It even has Spock screaming, ""Khan!"" like Kirk did in Star Trek II. Then Kirk is magically brought back to life by Khan's healing blood. (I'm rolling my eyes right now.)The casting is bad. Khan was originally played twice by Ricardo Montalban, and he did a great job. He had a Spanish accent and a very well-developed body. Montalban was believable as a genetically enhanced man. The actor playing Khan in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch, has neither. When you're watching the film and you first learn Cumberbatch is Khan, you're left thinking, ""HUH? This skinny guy?"" He isn't believable. Couldn't they have found a Hispanic actor with a six-pack to play Khan?They threw in hottie actress, Alice Eve, to play Kirk's old flame, Carol Marcus, the mother of his love child, David. Sadly, Alice has no real role. She is simply eye candy. The writers could have explored the relationship she develops with Kirk, since we've never seen any of that, but no. Instead, we just see her in underwear.Then there's Kirk, who keeps flouting the rules, acting illogically and irresponsibly, but does so because he's so noble, so heroic. He's always risking his life for others. He cares so much he should have been a nurse instead of a starship captain. It isn't believable someone would get away with so much bad behavior from their employer (Starfleet) or have such luck.They need to stop making Star Trek movies. They are out of ideas.Note to producers: please don't put a vampire on the Enterprise in the next lame installment.",1,"Not Original, Bad Casting, Bad Writing, Not Believable",1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1829,"['little', 'like', 'latest', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', ""'m"", 'life-long', 'fan.SPOILER', 'ALERTThis', 'film', 'so', 'unoriginal', 'exact', 'scene', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'where', 'Spock', 'only', 'positions', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'who', 'saving', 'ship', 'warp', 'core', 'breach', 'brought', 'Khan', 'even', 'Spock', 'screaming', 'Khan', 'Kirk', 'did', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Then', 'Kirk', 'magically', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'Khan', 'healing', 'blood', ""'m"", 'rolling', 'eyes', 'right', 'now', 'casting', 'bad', 'Khan', 'was', 'originally', 'played', 'twice', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'had', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'very', 'well-developed', 'body', 'Montalban', 'was', 'believable', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'man', 'actor', 'playing', 'Khan', 'film', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'neither', 'When', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'learn', 'Cumberbatch', 'Khan', ""'re"", 'left', 'thinking', 'HUH', 'skinny', 'guy', ""n't"", 'believable', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'Hispanic', 'actor', 'six-pack', 'play', 'Khan', 'threw', 'hottie', 'actress', 'Alice', 'Eve', 'play', 'Kirk', 'old', 'flame', 'Carol', 'Marcus', 'mother', 'love', 'child', 'David', 'Sadly', 'Alice', 'real', 'role', 'simply', 'eye', 'candy', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'relationship', 'Kirk', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Instead', 'just', 'see', 'underwear.Then', 'Kirk', 'who', 'flouting', 'rules', 'acting', 'illogically', 'irresponsibly', 'so', 'so', 'noble', 'so', 'heroic', 'always', 'risking', 'life', 'others', 'so', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nurse', 'instead', 'starship', 'captain', ""n't"", 'believable', 'someone', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'behavior', 'employer', 'Starfleet', 'have', 'such', 'luck.They', 'need', 'stop', 'making', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'are', 'ideas.Note', 'producers', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'vampire', 'Enterprise', 'next', 'lame', 'installment']",Star Trek Into Darkness

As a fan of all of the various Star Trek TV shows and movies, I love where this rebooted version of the Star Trek universe is going.

The pacing is faster than the older films, and there are some differences in tone, but I like the new version.  This is an exciting adventure story on a big stage told with courage and imagination.

To talk about the plot is pointless, other than to say Khan is back. Benedict Cumberbatch is a rather boring Khan who lacks the exotic look and class of Ricardo Montalban. Fortunately the cast of regulars can carry the film.The film also introduces Carol Marcus (Alice Eve). In the original film version Carol Marcus was an early conquest of Kirk (Chris Pine). She would have his child, a son who was ultimately killed by Klingons. If you have never seen the Khan film, then the juxtapositions in this film will be meaningless and the genius and enjoyment hindered.Another aspect of the early series is that it was reflective of the era with Klingons representing Russia and Romulans being China. That symbolism is meaningless today, so our writers cleverly use the aspect of terrorism as a way to maintain the original flavor of the series. Likewise the character of James Kirk, who did things on hunches and &#34;out of the box&#34; is maintained in this film, perhaps the only real reason we tolerated Shatner in that role in the first place.Dialogue is recycled. Zachary Quinto captures Spock. The role of Uhura has been expanded and Zoe Saldana kicks a lot of women to the curb. Bones (Karl Urban) still throws out the metaphors. Simon Pegg still needs to work on Scotty. John Cho is working hard to fill the big shoes of Sulu, whose stardom has multiplied as an Amazon reviewer. There is mention of Nurse Christine Chapel from the original TV and film series which didn't fit into the plot, perhaps a clue to the next script, or maybe I missed something. Perhaps some nice Trekkie could toss me a bone on this one in the comments section and I can edit this review.Be warned, there is zero character introduction. If you don't know who these characters are, the film will just be a special effects meh. The picture has its light moments, but I thought could use some more. Hopefully the next film we can re-introduce Harry Mudd a Star Trek favorite who made two episode appearances.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. A man wakes up in bed with two women.

Rickles,"[15, 21]","If you like space battles, nifty new design concepts of ships and you felt that the  nearly fifteen minutes in Star Trek The Motion Picture still wasn't enough time to fully visually caress the exterior of the U.S.S. Enterprise, then  you'll love ""Star Trek: Into The Darkness"".  To Be fair, the actors give fantastic performances.  Chris Pine, as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, and the other actors who reprise their roles of the Enterprise crew have absolutely grown in their roles and as before are a joy to watch.  For viewers remotely familiar with Star Trek's television canon, there are deep mischaracterizations of the ""villain"" Khan.  These mischaracterizations are aside from altering his initial ethnicity (In the 1967 ""Space Seed"" Khan Noonian SIngh appears of Indian extraction - in the film, he is British}.  In the TV episode, the ""Space Seed"" script and Ricardo Montalban's performance crafted the 300 year old frozen superman as a suave, commanding, charismatic leader who was as much a ladie's man as he was a tactician and intellect.  In contrast, Orci and Kurtzman's script has dumbed down Khan to the level of a vindictive, reactive wounded wolf who leaps before he looks in attempting to manipulate Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise into serving his goals of rescuing his fellow frozen supermen. The film also does not pay full homage to Roddenberry's depiction of a 23rd century United Federation of Planets that is pushing out colonies into the far reaches of the galaxy.  The script isolates almost all of the terrorist and political damage on Earth.  The initial terrorist incursion is in a visually stylistic London, the Star Fleet council that is convened to consider the events is also on Earth and the threat from Khan seems primarily aimed at Earth. Other than the Klingons, we have little sense of the rest of  human colonization.  Those who may be aware of Abrams,Orci's and Kurtzman's preference for Star Wars will also note that as in, the earlier 2009 film there is obvious Star Wars homage.  The situation is that the Enterprise crew needs a stealth way into a Klingon stronghold without identifying themselves as Federation - so Kirk orders that the ship from their recent ""Mudd incident"" be manned by Kirk, Spock and Uhura in an attempt to get past the Kiingon defences.  The shape of Mudd's freighter has an odd commonality with a miniature plain surface version of the Millenium Falcon. The bantering that goes on amid the characters, while different in content, is reminiscent of the camaraderie of Skywalker, Leia and Solo. The external shots of the ship's evasion of mountains and pursuing Klingon vessels involves side swipes that seem to pull directly from the cinematography of the Millennium Falcon in it's desperate efforts to escape the Empire's pursuit in Star Wars. For mindless action entertainment and adequate blue screen cinematography you can get away with spending a couple hours watching this film - but don't expect much of a take-away, other han a few smiles for enjoyable nostalgic character enactments by some truly gifted actors.",1,"A hack piece, Un-memorable and at odds with the Franchise's History",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3095,"['like', 'space', 'battles', 'nifty', 'new', 'design', 'concepts', 'ships', 'felt', 'nearly', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'fully', 'visually', 'caress', 'exterior', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Darkness', 'Be', 'fair', 'actors', 'give', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Kirk', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Spock', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'reprise', 'roles', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'have', 'absolutely', 'grown', 'roles', 'before', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'viewers', 'remotely', 'familiar', 'Star', 'Trek', 'television', 'canon', 'are', 'deep', 'mischaracterizations', 'villain', 'Khan', 'mischaracterizations', 'are', 'aside', 'altering', 'initial', 'ethnicity', '1967', 'Space', 'Seed', 'Khan', 'Noonian', 'SIngh', 'Indian', 'extraction', 'film', 'British', 'TV', 'episode', 'Space', 'Seed', 'script', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'performance', 'crafted', '300', 'year', 'old', 'frozen', 'superman', 'suave', 'commanding', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'ladie', 'man', 'was', 'tactician', 'intellect', 'contrast', 'Orci', 'Kurtzman', 'script', 'dumbed', 'down', 'Khan', 'level', 'vindictive', 'reactive', 'wounded', 'wolf', 'who', 'attempting', 'manipulate', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'serving', 'goals', 'rescuing', 'fellow', 'frozen', 'supermen', 'film', 'also', 'not', 'pay', 'full', 'homage', 'Roddenberry', 'depiction', '23rd', 'century', 'United', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'pushing', 'out', 'colonies', 'far', 'galaxy', 'script', 'almost', 'terrorist', 'political', 'damage', 'Earth', 'initial', 'terrorist', 'incursion', 'visually', 'stylistic', 'London', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'council', 'convened', 'consider', 'events', 'also', 'Earth', 'threat', 'Khan', 'primarily', 'aimed', 'Earth', 'Other', 'Klingons', 'have', 'little', 'sense', 'rest', 'human', 'colonization', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'aware', 'Abrams', 'Orci', 'Kurtzman', 'preference', 'Star', 'Wars', 'will', 'also', 'note', 'as', 'earlier', '2009', 'film', 'obvious', 'Star', 'Wars', 'homage', 'situation', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'stealth', 'way', 'Klingon', 'stronghold', 'identifying', 'Federation', 'so', 'Kirk', 'orders', 'ship', 'recent', 'Mudd', 'incident', 'be', 'manned', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'Uhura', 'attempt', 'get', 'Kiingon', 'defences', 'shape', 'Mudd', 'freighter', 'odd', 'commonality', 'miniature', 'plain', 'surface', 'version', 'Millenium', 'Falcon', 'bantering', 'characters', 'different', 'content', 'reminiscent', 'camaraderie', 'Skywalker', 'Leia', 'Solo', 'external', 'shots', 'ship', 'evasion', 'mountains', 'pursuing', 'Klingon', 'vessels', 'side', 'swipes', 'seem', 'pull', 'directly', 'cinematography', 'Millennium', 'Falcon', 'desperate', 'efforts', 'escape', 'Empire', 'pursuit', 'Star', 'Wars', 'mindless', 'action', 'entertainment', 'adequate', 'blue', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'spending', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'take-away', 'other', 'han', 'few', 'smiles', 'enjoyable', 'nostalgic', 'character', 'enactments', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actors']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Fortunately, Abrams and company have done it again, in that Star Trek Into Darkness is nothing short of spectacular!After a four year wait, the crew of the Enterprise is back on the big screen.  Into Darkness hits the ground running with a wild, stylish opening segment that reminds us that hot-shot Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) doesn't play by anybody else's rules.  However, this time his cavalier philosophy finally catches up with him.  Kirk's chance at redemption comes at the cost of an attack on star fleet by a mysterious mad-man by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch).  Harrision's attack and subsequent retreat to hostile space leads Kirk and crew on an inter-galactic man-hunt that tests their strength, courage, and relationships.The film looks very good and while heavy on special effects, they do not overwhelm the movie.  Abrams shot much of this film on the lot in Paramount Studios, but he was able to use realistic staging quite often, resulting in action scenes where the actors actually were able to interact with the environment and be immersed in the reality of it.  A clear example of this is a fantastic fight scene near the end of the film that takes place on top of multiple levitating barges.  The actors filmed this scene on actual moving platforms, which aid in creating a very intense tone for a pivotal scene.A major strength of Abrams's first Star Trek was the expert casting, and that remains so in Into Darkness.  All of the iconic roles are filled with performers who understand how to balance the legacy of their characters' reputations with the modern turn necessary to freshen up the franchise.  Especially excellent is Zachary Quinto who plays a more sensitive Spock, while still preserving the stone-cold-logical element that all fans have embraced for nearly fifty years.  While inside tongue-in-cheek references are aplenty, non-trekies will be none-the-wiser and will not feel like they are missing something.  Nonetheless, Abrams does not let the notoriously passionate fans down and creates another film that will certainly have devotees reeling, laughing, and gasping at several carefully nuanced touches; study up on your Klingon!Star Trek Into Darkness is far simpler in story and scope than its predecessor, which may disappoint those looking for twists and turns that fans of Abrams have come to expect from his work on television shows like Lost and Fringe.  While straightforward and uncomplicated in terms of plot, it is a lot of fun.  The pacing is swift, the action is great, and the all of the humor works.  Star Trek Into Darkness substantiates the latest voyages of the Starship Enterprise, which will surely live long and inevitably pro$per!  A-Star Trek Into Darkness is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 3 minutes.  While it was apparently not shot in 3-D, it was shot in IMAX, and the 3-D conversion is top notch and not disappointing.  See it in 2-D or 3-D, but definitely see it on an IMAX or Xtreme screen.",5,Live Long and Prosper!,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,3669,"['fair', 'say', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'quite', 'bit', 'success', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'fact', 'name', 'likely', 'top', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'list', 'encouraging', 'up-and-coming', 'writers', 'producers', 'directors', 'creators', 'few', 'milestones', 'are', 'left', 'achieve', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'happen', 'represent', 'first', 'responsibility', 'director', 'sequel', 'high-profile', 'one', 'secret', 'Abrams', 'will', 'be', 'helming', 'most', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'set', 'sequels', 'time', 'terms', 'upcoming', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'little', 'more', 'riding', 'usual', 'Fortunately', 'Abrams', 'company', 'have', 'done', 'again', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'four', 'year', 'wait', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'ground', 'running', 'wild', 'stylish', 'opening', 'segment', 'hot-shot', 'Captain', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'Chris', 'Pine', ""n't"", 'play', 'anybody', 'else', 'rules', 'However', 'time', 'cavalier', 'philosophy', 'finally', 'up', 'Kirk', 'chance', 'redemption', 'cost', 'attack', 'star', 'fleet', 'mysterious', 'mad-man', 'name', 'John', 'Harrison', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Harrision', 'attack', 'subsequent', 'retreat', 'hostile', 'space', 'Kirk', 'crew', 'inter-galactic', 'man-hunt', 'strength', 'courage', 'relationships.The', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'heavy', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'not', 'overwhelm', 'movie', 'Abrams', 'shot', 'much', 'film', 'lot', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'was', 'able', 'use', 'realistic', 'staging', 'quite', 'often', 'resulting', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'actors', 'actually', 'were', 'able', 'interact', 'environment', 'be', 'immersed', 'reality', 'clear', 'example', 'fantastic', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'place', 'top', 'multiple', 'levitating', 'barges', 'actors', 'filmed', 'scene', 'actual', 'moving', 'platforms', 'aid', 'creating', 'very', 'intense', 'tone', 'pivotal', 'scene.A', 'major', 'strength', 'Abrams', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'expert', 'casting', 'so', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'iconic', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'performers', 'who', 'understand', 'how', 'balance', 'legacy', 'characters', 'reputations', 'modern', 'turn', 'necessary', 'freshen', 'up', 'franchise', 'Especially', 'excellent', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'who', 'more', 'sensitive', 'Spock', 'still', 'preserving', 'stone-cold-logical', 'element', 'fans', 'have', 'embraced', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'references', 'are', 'aplenty', 'non-trekies', 'will', 'be', 'none-the-wiser', 'will', 'not', 'feel', 'are', 'missing', 'something', 'Nonetheless', 'Abrams', 'not', 'let', 'notoriously', 'passionate', 'fans', 'down', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'devotees', 'reeling', 'laughing', 'gasping', 'several', 'carefully', 'nuanced', 'touches', 'study', 'up', 'Klingon', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'far', 'simpler', 'story', 'scope', 'predecessor', 'may', 'disappoint', 'looking', 'twists', 'fans', 'Abrams', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'work', 'television', 'shows', 'Lost', 'Fringe', 'straightforward', 'uncomplicated', 'terms', 'plot', 'lot', 'fun', 'pacing', 'swift', 'action', 'great', 'humor', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'latest', 'voyages', 'Starship', 'Enterprise', 'will', 'surely', 'live', 'long', 'inevitably', 'pro', 'A-Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'running', 'time', '2', 'hours', '3', 'minutes', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'shot', '3-D', 'was', 'shot', 'IMAX', '3-D', 'conversion', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'disappointing', 'See', '2-D', '3-D', 'definitely', 'see', 'IMAX', 'Xtreme', 'screen']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1589375,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B009934S5M,Thomas Glebe,"[6, 12]","If you liked/loved the first JJ movie having something to do with ""Star Trek,"" then you're going to fall head over heels in love with this one.  The first JJ effort (Star Trek 2009, Star Trek 11 or whatever), did well at the box office, though perhaps not as much as JJ and Paramount INC liked, so yeah, warp speed and we get a sequel.Considering how absolutely great the first JJ Star Trek flick was/is, I wondered before I saw a frame of this instant masterpiece, could JJ ever come even close to giving us a great sequel?  Well, the answer is yes, yes, and an extra yes!  All the regulars from the first JJ film are back, and more!  Yet, of course, one of the keys to the success and long-livety of the very first original Star Trek TV show, was in the writing.  The direction an afterthought (until JJ).  Here, JJ and crew live up to not only the almost sacredness of the original show, and the first few big screen flix and spinoff series, but go beyond that.Fortunately, JJ Abrams has already proven his worth in ""Hollywood"" time and time again, as not only a man of great creativity and vision generally, but the guy who brought back the Star Trek franchise back to life.  Not that it was ever broken, but it had ""been"" a few years...The first movie by JJ was just so perfect, imho, but this one ups the bet.  JJ and Paramount have wagered that those misguided souls who bought into the first film's wonderful cosmic vision of humankind's near future, might let down with the sequel.  But, judging from the box office and acceptance among ST drones, hope lives inside and outside this clearly five-star effort based upon characters created by Gene Roddenberry...I will leave breakdowns of the various pro's and con's of this sequel to 2009's brilliant original to others for the meantime, but the first film was such a ground-breaking tribute to all that is good and decent in the Star Trek universe, (JJ's first, startrek 11, st2009, zzzzz), that this is just icing on the cake.  The first offered lens flares?  They are here, in spades.  Jittery and zoomiee phony director techniques?  JJ drenches us in them, praise the Lord.  And all our favorites are back.  Obnoxious Kirk, goofy Spock, interpretations of others, i.e., McCoy, Scotty, Uhuruh (Spock's ""lover"" oops spoiler alert), and good impressions of Sulu and Chekov.  All give oscar award consideration performances, and if JJ doesn't win best picture for this, then there just ain't no justice in the whole dang universe...This is great cinema.  This is ""art.""  And while this review is based upon seeing just a few minutes of this, that was more than enough.  And I really, really, really mean that a few minutes of this is way more than enough, just like it was with JJ's original.  Extra DVD/Blu-Ray versions have tons of extra features and all go to make you just worship this JJ effort.  The JJ ""lens-flare"" discussion, is for gold.  As is the featurette, ""JJ and ST 2013: Further spoiling a worn-out franchise.""  There are other DVD/Blu-Ray features which JJ and Paramount have included, like ""JJ: What's this Star Trek all about?""  Extra stuff like this is included.  Much more than I can go into here.Since the original JJ Abram's Star Trek first came out, there has been a somewhat muted debate of what JJ had actually done, with his ""rebooting"" of the ST brand.  Some have seen it as heaven-sent, some otherwise, but let me just end this by saying that, and I almost choke when I write this, Star Trek 2009 is absolutely nothing.  I mean, St2K9 is old news and nowhere as good as this first JJ sequel.  So, rush right out and see it or buy this product, to joyfully, blissfully, enjoy one of the greatest filmmaker's of all time, JJ Abrams, and his brilliant, much better than the original, artwork, called (appropriately), ""Star Trek: Into Darkness.""  The split second, but so totally filmic comfort food special effects shots, alone make this a must buy!Hats off, lens flare off, steady-cam on, steady-cam off, lens flare on, 3d on and off and who cares, and two thumbs up for the obvious talent employed in the making of this, this ageless epic for all times.  This is, nuff said, the greatest motion picture of all times, and yay, JJ gets to bring similar glorious renewal to Star Wars,...If our pal JJ does for Star Wars what he did for Star Trek, I can't wait!JJ Abrams rules.  He just rules, that's all.  This is not a film, but a work of art.

Chris Pine is a perfectly suitable Jim Kirk, Zachary Quinto's deeply etched and by-the-book Spock is vastly familiar and Karl Urban continues to channel the soul of DeForest Kelly; but therein, I fear, lies the death knell for Star Trek, for we have entered the realm of keeping this franchise alive at all costs, by retelling old stories, employing even grander scenes of destruction, longer battles on ever larger scales &#8212; troubles that require tribbles &#8212; and a reservoir of plots so depleted that an old villian needed to be resurrected to get this movie up and running, along with Dr. Carol Marcus, the once and future director of the Genesis Project, seen in her earlier years, portrayed here as a plastic Starship Barbie, so bimbo-like that any minute I expected her to text OMG to her girlfriend, very much in contrast to the classy 1982 incarnation that Bibi Besch gave to this character in The Wrath of Khan.&#8232;&#8232;The visuals are simultaneously thrilling and yet over-the-top.

For the people boycotting buying this movie for that reason...that is their choice.  For the cinephiles, sci-fi buffs, and Trek enthusiasts the movie itself must be considered and when the topic is returned to the film proper we are left with an exciting, intense, dense, and frenetic sci-fi action movie full of political intrigue and machination, some sharp acting from likable actors, and loads of nods to fans from the old Trek lore but packaged for a new sidereal reality.  I think that part of the fun of this movie is that though we are dealing with known characters they are no longer trapped replaying what we've already seen but just now updated for today's special effects and savvy scriptwriters; they are beholden to similar elements of a history that we know of but is no more, but it is only the elements that are similar and how they will work themselves out in this line of reality intrigues.The heart of this movie is still Kirk and Spock (less so Bones) but all of the crew (especially Scotty) get some nice play time here.  Returning one of Trek's most popular nemesis, Khan (played with unnerving precision by Benedict Cumberbatch), Kirk and crew are presented with the option of taking out Khan after he attacks and murders some high-ranking Starfleet officers on home turf.  Kirk has to be careful, though, not to start a war with the Klingons as Khan is hiding in their habitat.  All of this is orchestrated by some human hawks in this particular future (apparently despite the prime directive there are more than a few men who still believe in some good old-fashioned military imperialism with the notion of taking one's enemies out before they get the chance to take you out).The ending of this movie is a nice twist on &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34; though it isn't as heart wrenching.  Still, the spirit and flavor of Star Trek lives on.  There are those who are criticizing the lack of its boldness by &#34;going where men have gone before&#34; instead of exploring new territory.  That's fine and all but they may be living in the past, not this new sideline present.

LOTS of holes in the plot that are either outright blunders in writing or at least require some explanation. The Enterprise, NCC-1701 is NOT a submarine. So WHY was it underwater at the beginning of this movie? Shouldn't they have mentioned WHY somewhere? If you're trying to hide yourself from the native life, wouldn't the transporter have been more effective, with the ship in orbit where it couldn't be seen by the locals? Even if the ship had a CLOAKING DEVICE (which it does NOT), it could still be seen entering and exiting the water. Pretty obvious, huh?Anyway, I've been a Trek fan since I was a kid during the original series run. We took our Trek seriously, buying everything we could, from ST Academy Handbooks and ships blueprints to making our own props and movies with US as the actors. So I do know a bit about what things should and shouldn't be doing.OK, so this is a 'new timeline' and things may be different. Is this a NICE way of saying 'turn your brains off and just enjoy the ride'? If so, they should have been more obvious about letting us know. If this had been about the Good Ship Lollypop in the 23rd century with no Trek references I would have enjoyed it. I'd give it a 3 out of 5 and call it entertaining. But it could and SHOULD have been so much more.Some people blame the movie goers for what now passes for entertainment. They say that people don't want to think too much - they just want LOTS of actions and not too many breaks of 'dialog' in-between. I don't agree! I think people are smarter today than they've ever been, with so many sources of knowledge at their fingertips. Once upon a time you COULD get away with misinforming people about the way things were done. ""Everybody knows that"" was often added to the end of an erroneous statement to give it more weight and believability.For whatever reason, this movie was made without the wit and twists us fans of The Trek have come to expect. This version would have more appropriately started out with the words 'Once Upon A Time""...In closing, I have to share my biggest pet peeve regarding FIRST Generation Trek. It is in NO WAY improper for Hu-MAN beings to refer to the whole as the race of Man or Mankind. It is not (yet) Peoplekind, as people are very obviously NOT kind to each other often enough. So WHY change the OPENING LINES?""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""They now call this 'The Captains Oath"". Seems more like a mission statement to me, but what do I know? I've only been following them for about 50 years. Would Neil Armstrong's statement have carried the same weight if HE had changed it for the new PC crowd? Go ahead - give it a try. It wasn't necessary then any more than it is now.So shall we be called -Hu-Man or Hu-People? The choice is yours.

1589405,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B009934S5M,Tom Birkenstock,"[9, 17]","My first introduction to the world of Star Trek was not the original series but the second television show, Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I may have seen reruns of the original series before I sat down with my family to watch the pilot episode of TNG, but if so it has been lost to memory.  I do remember watching reruns of TOS after familiarizing myself with TNG and trying to wrap my head around the fact that these two shows were supposed to comprise the same fictional universe.  As I got older, I eventually came to understand the shared philosophy between each iteration of Star Trek: a secular humanist view of the future.  Star Trek exists in a world where the limitless optimism of the 1960s never died.  I continued watching Star Trek shows and movies for years after my first introduction, but eventually I bailed sometime in the middle of Voyager's run (my zeal for Star Trek had its limits).  Still, the first three television shows found a unique way of exploring and commenting on creator Gene Roddenberry's image of the future: TOS presented us with the dangers and surprises of exploration; TNG constructed a lived in image of different worlds attempting to share what sometimes seemed like a small galaxy; and DS9, freed from Roddenberry's creative vision, actually started to question some of the mid-century zeal for the future that characterized the first two shows.I started this review with this brief sketch of my relationship to Star Trek because no one goes into a long running series like this unencumbered.  Even those who have never seen an episode of any of the many series have an image (right or wrong) of what Star Trek stands for.  But you should know that I have an emotional, intellectual, and personal connection to the franchise, and this of course colors how I watched this movie.  When J.J. Abrams first decided to reboot the series, I wasn't sure what to think.  I was cautiously optimistic that he would be able to capture some of the fun of the original, but I in no way expected him to mimic the same pop-philosophy that had always characterized the series and made its way, in abbreviated form, into the movies.  (I can't imagine that Abrams is much of a Herman Melville fan, for instance).  Keeping my expectations in check helped me to really enjoy 2008's Star Trek.  Abrams transformed the movie into a series of sometimes enjoyable, sometimes dumb, and sometimes exhausting action set pieces, but he also managed to capture the relationship between the principal characters surprisingly well.But where Star Trek had the benefit of low expectations, Star Trek into Darkness had the burden of showing where Abrams could take this series and the anticipatory build up of five years, a long time in-between movies.  While it's no unmitigated disaster, Star Trek into Darkness is a mixed bag.  It suffers from the usual problems that plague J.J. Abrams work, like the fact that it works when the gears are moving and the audience has little time to reflect on what's happening, but it starts to flail when things turn serious.Typical of a J.J. Abrams joint, STiD begins in media res, with Kirk and McCoy fleeing a group of natives after stealing a religious artifact.  They hope to lure the island community, a burgeoning society of sentient beings, away from an active volcano long enough so that Spock can set a cold fusion bomb that will deactivate the volcano, allowing the natives to live long enough to enter the Bronze Age.  Kirk soon has to decide whether he should leave Spock to die in the volcano or if he should reveal the Enterprise to the natives and beam Spock out of danger.  Obviously, Kirk decides on the latter, and in doing so he breaks the Prime Directive, a central tenant of Starfleet that says explorers should not interfere with the development of alien civilizations.  Kirk leaves all of this out of his official report, but Spock doesn't, which leads to Kirk's mentor and senior officer, Captain Pike, dressing him down and relieving him of command of the Enterprise.Shortly after Pike has taken command of the Enterprise, a mysterious terrorist played by Benedict Cumberbatch blows up a building used by Starfleet and later attacks a meeting of senior Starfleet officers who have convened to decide how best to tackle this act of terrorism.  In the attack, Pike is killed, sending Kirk into revenge mode.  It's discovered that the terrorist, John Harrison, has fled to the Klingon home world, a warrior race that is on the brink of war with the Federation. So Captain Marcus, played by Robocop himself, Peter Weller, tasks Kirk and the enterprise with tracking Harrison's location and killing him with a long range torpedo.The clear modern analogy is drone strikes, a policy where we often ignore the sovereign space of other nations in order assassinate individuals suspected of terrorism, even if they are also American citizens.  The crew of the Enterprise is naturally uncomfortable with the idea of assassinating a Federation citizen without a trial.  Spock makes his disagreement with the assignment clear and Scotty goes so far as to stay behind rather than to be implicated in the assassination.It's obvious that this plot is attempting to address criticism that Abrams's Star Trek is just dumb fun without any of the original show's notions of philosophy. The use of science fiction to comment on contemporary politics was integral to what made the original series so memorable.  Gene Roddenberry wanted to do more than entertain; he wanted comment on the civil rights movements of the 60s.  In the end, Kirk decides to push aside his desire for revenge and captures Harrison.  I have to commend Abrams and his screenwriters for not only addressing moral quandaries surrounding terrorism, but also for clearly coming down against drone strikes.  It's common for large blockbusters to throw in an allusion to terrorism now and then to give themselves an easy sense of gravitas, but for every film that handles the issue with intelligence (Batman Begins), there are many more films that drop the ball (The Dark Knight Rises).  In fact, I would argue that STiD is better at handling the themes of terrorism, revenge, and justice than more overtly ""real world"" movies like Zero Dark Thirty.  And while we will never know for certain, the film's condemnation of assassinating our enemies would have been embraced by Roddenberry himself, who always came off as a bit of 60s radical.It's too bad, then, that the moment Kirk captures the terrorist, Harrison, the movie begins to fall apart. Fair warning: from here on out there are heavy spoilers.  I avoided all spoilers before seeing the film, but I had heard the internet whisperings that Cumberbatch would be playing Kahn, the most notorious Star Trek villain.  Well, he is Kahn.  How a Mexican pretending to be Indian in the original Star Trek universe becomes a Brit in this universe, I'll never know (perhaps they'll explain this discrepancy in the sequel).  Perhaps one of the most potentially exciting aspects of the first Star Trek was that Abrams and company had come up with a way of starting fresh without completely overwriting the long history of the series.  All they had to do was construct an entirely new parallel universe.  But it seems wrong headed for Abram to give himself all of this freedom, to tell the audience that we are now entering a world where anything can happen--we are not bound to continuity; this is my playground now--and then go ahead and retread characters and events from the old universe.  There are so many possibilities in the world of Star Trek. Why give us more of the same?But wait, it gets worse.  Perhaps the most inexplicable moment in the entire film is a restaging of a famous scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but this time the characters are flipped.  Fans of the Star Trek series will almost immediately guess what scene I'm referring to: the death of Spock.  But here it is Kirk who sacrifices his life and restores power to the Enterprise.  At best, this comes across as mistaken fan service, cosplay on the big screen.  Abrams understands, rightly, that the death of Spock still has a strong emotional pull for geekdom.  So he thinks that restaging it will conjure up the same sort of emotional memories.  Instead, the scene plays out as rote.  I felt like I had to endure the death of Kirk in order for the real film to resume.  At its worst, this scene plays out as cynical miscalculation.  Abrams, unable to conjure up something new, tosses out pre-masticated remains for the public.  In my review of Super 8 (a film that has some fine moments), I said that Abrams was like a piano prodigy who can recreate the notes of a piece of music perfectly, but somehow the results are devoid of emotion.  I can think of no finer example of this than STiD's death of Kirk.I don't think Abrams understands what a disservice the death of Kirk did not only to his audience, but also to himself.  Star Trek II is such a taught, well crafted piece of entertainment that to intentionally draw comparisons between it and STiD causes the latter to suffer.  But it also shows how little Abrams understood what made the death of Spock work.  Star Trek II smartly drew on the fact that the characters were getting older for dramatic weight.  Early in the film, McCoy gives Kirk his birthday presents, including a pair of archaic looking spectacles.  Death is becoming real to these characters.  Sure, there's element of survivor's guilt--that these characters have survived trouncing through the galaxy while others haven't.  But it's also the sense that age and death catches up with us all.  This dread hangs over much of the film.  But STiD takes place when Kirk and Spock are just beginning to understand each other.  They don't have the same history, and as young men death is not yet real to them.  In order to understand this, a director has to know not only how to stage action, which Abrams does well, but he must also know how to weave thematic weight into his narrative, which Abrams has yet to learn.But despite my rant, the movie is rather enjoyable until about two-thirds of the way through.  It's not a complete loss.  The greatest boon this new series of movies has going for it are the actors.  Abrams must get credit for assembling a great group of young actors who manage to fit their roles well.  This is especially surprising, because the single greatest aspect of the original Star Trek was the relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  It was easy to ignore the chintzy 1960s special effects when these three characters and the actors who portrayed them were on the screen.  (I still wish that Karl Urban could get more screen time as McCoy in the new series).  I sincerely hope that this crew has plenty of adventures left, and I think that one day Abrams might even become a great director of blockbuster entertainments.  Until then, I'm happy for someone else to take over for the next installment.",3,A Copy of a True Original,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,11005,"['first', 'introduction', 'world', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was',

However, this film was also fairly overrated as far as films in the Star Trek series go. While this film attempted some degree of character development, it was minimal at best, and, without spoiling anything, there exist numerous narrative flaws that you may notice by the end of the film. One of the main antagonists is a cardboard-cutout villain and a straw-man war hawk used by the writers of the film to convey the film's message against government corruption. This is all very fine and well but this particular antagonist could have used more depth and complexity - one aspect that always really defined the later Star Trek series was that even the antagonists were given a complex and reasonable motivation, and that their sides of the issue were usually explored in depth. This is attempted somewhat with the other main antagonist John Harrison (you'll find out his real name later in the film, as though you didn't guess already), the super-villainous anti-hero (or so it seems at first) trying to save his friends so that they can&#8230;. (this is where all sense of complexity or depth is lost) take over the world!Over all, while a watchable movie, this film was blunt, shallow, and lacking in the intellectual overtones that defined the Star Trek franchise ranging from the original series up even until the relatively anti-intellectual (by comparison) Star Trek: Enterprise. Instead, viewers will get a few violent action sequences, some major plot holes at which you will likely roll your eyes or say &#34;really?&#34; more than once, used to provide a blunt, ham-fisted, and above all shallow allegory about the evils of unjust war and governmental corruption.",3,"A shallow, ham-fisted allegory against unnecessary war and government corruption",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1734,"['was', 'watchable', 'film', 'decent', 'amount', 'action', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'fairly', 'overrated', 'as', 'far', 'films', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'go', 'film', 'attempted', 'degree', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'minimal', 'best', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'exist', 'numerous', 'narrative', 'flaws', 'may', 'notice', 'end', 'film', 'One', 'main', 'antagonists', 'cardboard-cutout', 'villain', 'straw-man', 'war', 'hawk', 'used', 'writers', 'film', 'convey', 'film', 'message', 'government', 'corruption', 'very', 'fine', 'well', 'particular', 'antagonist', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'depth', 'complexity', 'one', 'aspect', 'always', 'really', 'defined', 'later', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'was', 'even', 'antagonists', 'were', 'given', 'complex', 'reasonable', 'motivation', 'sides', 'issue', 'were', 'usually', 'explored', 'depth', 'attempted', 'somewhat', 'other', 'main', 'antagonist', 'John', 'Harrison', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'real', 'name', 'later', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'guess', 'already', 'super-villainous', 'anti-hero', 'so', 'first', 'trying', 'save', 'friends', 'so', 'can', '8230', 'where', 'sense', 'complexity', 'depth', 'lost', 'take', 'world', 'watchable', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'blunt', 'shallow', 'lacking', 'intellectual', 'overtones', 'defined', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'ranging', 'original', 'series', 'up', 'even', 'relatively', 'anti-intellectual', 'comparison', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'few', 'violent', 'action', 'sequences', 'major', 'plot', 'holes', 'will', 'likely', 'roll', 'eyes', 'say', '34', 'really', '34', 'more', 'once', 'used', 'provide', 'blunt', 'ham-fisted', 'shallow', 'allegory', 'evils', 'unjust', 'war', 'governmental', 'corruption']",Star Trek Into Darkness

1589416,A1FO24PIXHM3SG,B009934S5M,T. RHEAULT,"[14, 22]","After striking gold with hisStar Trek (2009)movie that managed to be both a reboot and a sequel to the Star Trek franchise, J.J. Abrams hits another home run with ""Star Trek Into Darkness"".  In this newest Trek movie, Abrams manages to give non-Trek fans a rousing action story, outstanding special effects, another excellent score by composer Michael Giacchino and, for Trek fans, all of this plus some good-natured nods to previous movies (although some were offended by this; more on this point later).  Also, in the spirit of the original Star Trek television series, andStar Trek IV: The Voyage HomeandStar Trek: Insurrection, Abrams gives us a ""message"" movie with commentary on current events (*minor spoiler* in this movie Kirk is ordered by his superior officer to destroy a terrorist in enemy territory via the use of long-range torpedoes).After turning in excellent performances in the 2009 movie, the cast is once again outstanding in this film.  Chris Pine continues to channel William Shatner and yet put his own stamp on the role of Captain James T. Kirk; a remarkable achievement by a remarkable actor.  Likewise, Zachary Quinto expertly balances Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Spock with his own mix of melancholy and occasional bursts of emotion and even anger.  After the destruction of his planet in the previous film, I completely buy into the idea that his Spock would show more emotion than Nimoy's.The rest of the cast also turns in good performances- Karl Urban is very good but slightly underused as Bones McCoy, John Cho as Sulu gets a nice scene of his own, Anton Yelchin as Chekov makes the most of his screen time, and Zoe Saldana is used well again as Uhura.  Alice Eve is also good as Dr. Carol Marcus, but is not given much to do; most likely she was introduced in this film with the intent of featuring her more prominently in the next movie.  Simon Pegg as Scotty is both heroic and hilarious in this film, and steals several scenes.*Major Spoilers Ahead re: Villains* Peter Weller appears as the corrupt Starfleet admiral Alexander Marcus, and makes an effective villain.  Special mention must be made of Benedict Cumberbatch, who *Major Spoiler* plays Khan.  Cumberbatch's Khan is just as villainous as the classic Khan and even more brutal, but yet manages to explain his actions to the extent that while you may not agree with what he does, it still makes a certain degree of sense from his point of view.  Cumberbatch is so good in the role that I think he turns in a Heath Ledger Joker-esque performance as Khan, and I really hope we see him again in a future sequel.  While some fans object to his nationality (in comparison to the classic Khan's nationality), I feel that, as with any film, some imagination must be used when you go to see a movie.*Major Spoiler*  As I mentioned earlier, some fans have been offended by the movie's references to previous events in Star Trek.  In particular, some fans have been offended by the nod to the famous ending toStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan [HD] when in this film Kirk sacrifices himself (albeit temporarily) to save the Enterprise, and then shares an emotional goodbye with Spock through a transparent door.  I know some disagree, but I thought this was an interesting way to turn Spock's sacrifice in Star Trek II on its head while, at the same time, reverse the ultimate meaning of the farewell between the two friends.  As screenwriter Bob Orci has explained, in Star Trek II Kirk and Spock are sharing a final goodbye as the culmination of decades of friendship; whereas in this movie, this emotional moment is really the true beginning of their friendship.  I disagree completely with the notion that this moment is a ""copy and paste"" rip-off of Star Trek II.Does this movie edge out ""Star Trek II"" as the best Star Trek movie (IMHO) in my mind?  Close, but for one nitpick- the movie's use of the Enterprise.  The Enterprise has always been as much of a character in Star Trek as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, etc.  It has always been much more than an airplane, helicopter, etc., or something simply used to ferry our characters from Point A to Point B in the story.  *Spoiler*  While the Enterprise manages to hang tough in the face of heavy fire from Admiral Marcus' secret battleship U.S.S. Vengeance, it never returns fire to defeat its adversary, which I think is a storytelling flaw.  In Star Trek II andStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, the Enterprise takes heavy damage, but also eventually overcomes its enemy starship adversaries in those films.  In this film, the Vengeance is eventually disabled in a clever ploy undertaken by Spock, but I think it would have been more satisfying from a storytelling point of view if its comeuppance had been delivered by the Enterprise herself.On that subject, after the Scimitar inStar Trek: Nemesis, the Narada in Star Trek (2009), and the Vengeance in Star Trek Into Darkness, I think the writers have mined the ""massive powerful battleship versus the smaller, less powerful Enterprise"" plotline enough.  I hope the next film gives us a more evenly matched naval engagement between the Enterprise and the enemy vessel, where the Enterprise prevails.In summary, Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent film for Star Trek fans and non-Trek fans of action/adventure films alike, and should not be missed.

1589422,A3MG6ECEYK0KYM,B009934S5M,TrueNerd,"[16, 30]","STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is an extremely watchable movie. That is because of JJ Abrams. Say what you will about JJ Abrams, the man is a talented visual stylist. The way his camera moves, his edits, the set piece sequences he creates are all pretty great. He can make any movie fun. Hell, I even like his overuse of lens flares. His work in these areas is once again excellent in STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS. Unfortunately, he's never worked with a good script. When MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 is the best script you've worked with, you're not doing too hot. Most impressive is Abrams' ability to make watchable, even sometimes good movies out of bad scripts. Abrams, along with his excellent cast, do their best again here in STID, but the script they are working from is just too vile to save.Again, most of the movie was very watchable. It never ""feels"" like Star Trek (whatever that means) to me, but it was enjoyable, in a dumb, obvious 9/11 allegory sci fi way. (Btw, have these writers seen the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA reboot? Cuz they kinda already did the whole space-opera-as-9/11 metaphor thing. 10 years ago. Before the allegory had been done a million times.) Honestly it felt more like a dumber version of Mass Effect than it did Star Trek. And I was fine with that. I love Mass Effect! But then, the wheels start falling off the wagon.Spoilers ahead.For context, I looooove THE WRATH OF KHAN. I'm not crazy about everything relating to Star Trek, but that movie is great. So when STID very openly invites comparisons between itself and TWOK, it looks absolutely foolish in comparison, and frankly, made me mad. The writers may love TWOK like I do, but I don't think for a second they understand WHY that movie is great. Let's break this down into the two plot elements that most directly relate to TWOK.1.) Khan - The reason Khan is the most popular villain in Star Trek is because a) Ricardo Montalban's pecs and b) Khan has a history with Kirk and he wants revenge. When Eggs Benedict Cumberbund reveals himself to actually be Khan, NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE CARES because he has no history with anyone. Hell, he hasn't even been talked about prior to this reveal. His name could have been John Bon Poopypants for all they care. It is a ""reveal"" that only exists for fan service and it falls completely flat. And then after that, he bears absolutely zero resemblance to any Khan I remember. Basically what they did was name a generic bad guy Khan for the fans when it really had no bearing on the movie they were making.2.) The Self Sacrifice Ending Inversion - This is the one that pissed me off. Kirk sacrificing himself for his crew and ship is a pretty obvious ending to his arc in this movie, at least after Pike spells out what he needs to do to be a good captain. But why, for the love of god, why, reprise Spock's sacrificial ending in TWOK? Why turn what should be an emotional moment into one where the writers are elbowing you in the side going, ""Eh? Eh? See what we're doing here? Eh? Get it?"" It was even worse for me because I knew pretty quickly that they weren't even going to follow through with Kirk's death and they were going to cop out with Magical Khan Blood (dumbest plot device ever, btw), basically rendering Kirk's arc completely pointless.TWOK is great because, on top of being a great popcorn film, every element of that movie comes together to say something about life and death and the relationship between the two. The Genesis project, Kirk having a son, Khan being a villain from Kirk's past, Kirk feeling old, and Spock sacrificing himself are all about these things. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. STID has no understanding of this. STID just takes a couple surface elements from this great movie and throws them in its movie and thinks that's enough. What it is instead is a hollow and cynical re-appropriation of the genuine article, and at that point all you're doing is fan-fiction. BAD fan-fiction.I do, however, have a few friends who have never seen TWOK and they all think this movie is great. So if you've never seen the masterpiece that is THE WRATH OF KHAN and have no interest in doing so, maybe you'll like this.STAR WARS RELATED POST SCRIPT: Honestly at this point, the only hope I have for STAR WARS EPISODE VII is that Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelof won't be involved at all and based on Michael Arndt's previous work, EPISODE VII will be quite easily the best script Abrams has worked with.

""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a big-budget action-packed adventure movie that is so fast-paced that you almost forget the storyline is full of plot holes. After all, this is a J.J. Abrams movie and how he re-imagined the universe of ""Star Trek,"" for better or worse. It was sort of refreshing in his previous effort back in 2009, with a new cast of players and Leonard Nimoy returning to the series, but this time the filmmakers went too far.Following the pre-main title action sequence (in a James Bond fashion, the main story begins as Chris Pine's Captain Kirk sets out to capture one John Harrison, a terrorist responsible for the bomb attack in London, now hiding in the Klingon home world.Whether or not you are an avid Star Trek fan, you will soon realize that this is a Hollywood-made sci-fi blockbuster action movie whose name happens to be ""Star Trek,"" in spite of the third act that has something to do with one ""Star Trek"" episode in the past.Among the film's cast including those who have returned to play the ""Enterprise"" crew, it is Benedict ""Sherlock"" Cumberbatch who leaves the most lasting impression as ""John Harrison.""

1589428,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B009934S5M,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[2, 4]","I was rather disappointed with the first of the ""new"" Star Trek films starring this new cast and alternate Universe. The first film didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, as Spock would say, ""Highly Illogical"".This second film fared much better with me. For one thing, it kept me guessing through more than half the film who was the real bad guy. Obviously, it was Kahn, but the way he pulled off his treachery was cleverly done. It reminded me of the original TOS character. He had a charm and charisma that got some members of the Enterprise crew to follow him. Of course he was a bad guy, but he wasn't originally all that scary. It wasn't until the ""Wrath of Kahn"" years later that we saw the really scary, dark and vicious side of him. Ricardo Montalban did a great job with him. In this film, Benedict Cumberbatch does a nice ""alternate"" Khan.Without giving away spoilers, he is sometimes brutally cruel, sometimes seems the innocent victim of forces beyond his control, and sometimes is the kind of fighter you want on your side because he could take down a star ship all on his own, except you can't trust him. So you better call his bluff before he blows you into space. That's a complex villain, and he was obviously well crafted based on the prior characterizations. And lest he take you in with his charms, Capt'n Kirk will set you straight with a simple sentence, ""I have a feeling he's not helping us, we're helping him."" Brilliant!I also kind of like the new all blue and white interiors of the Enterprise. Yes, it still does look like the make up counter in a hi tech department store, or something APPLE might design, but for some reason, this time around, I warmed up to it.Of course, there's plenty of action in this film, the usual spaceships being severely damaged and people getting tossed out into space, complete with screams. And there's also the expected mass destruction of buildings, people and property when a star ship crashes into a planet (I won't spoil it by saying which star ship or which planet). And of course, there are the usual ""falling from great heights at ridiculous speeds and landing on target anyway"" sequences that are a common to these types of films. These types of scenes have become a staple or signature for this version of the genre.What got me, and had a lasting effect, was how well the actors did with the characters. They did what every Star Trek version has managed to do... they created characters who I care about, who are fun to watch. This was one of the things that made Star Trek TOS so memorable... the characters seemed real because the actors made them so. Other series and spin offs were successful in this, and I'm happy to say, this new ""crew"" pulled together nicely in this film, making the characters likeable, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and well, believable. Bravo to everyone on the bridge and in the engineering section, which still looks like the inside of a brewery.So I give this film a 5 star thumbs up this time around.

1589429,A1M1H7B8QRT5U,B009934S5M,"Tuck ""TS FTW""","[2, 6]","Yes, I say it, knowing how much flak I'm probably gonna get, also I've seen the 2nd-4th, 7th, 8th & 11th movies. It left me in awe, with how well it was written, acted, & directed. The only thing that could make it better, is an extra scene depicting Spock, Uhura, & Kahn beaming back up to the Enterprise after Spock knocks Kahn out, they rush him to sick bay, they unfreeze Kirk, take a sample of blood from Kahn, made the serum he did, injected it into Kirk, refroze Kahn, then faded into black with Spock asking if Kirk were all right & Bones answering ""we'll see,"" & we be given some indication of Kirk being revived, then we see Kirk in the med bay on Earth. Other than that, it's perfect. I was laughing for the 1st part of this movie, with all its jokes (Chekov being told to put on a red shirt) & possible callbacks to the original timeline (Wrath of Kahn, DS9, TOS, etc). Then s*** got real pretty quick & I enjoyed the hell out of the movie.Now, for those that might complain about it not being perfect, what size stick is up your ass?Possible topics for why you'd probably be mad;1. It takes from Wrath of Kahn.It parallels Wrath of Kahn, not steals from it. They even remind older fans of that movie, with Leonard Nimoy as original Spock, telling his younger alternate self about it. Also, what was Kirk supposed to do about the Enterprise, huh? Let it crash on Earth & have most to every person die on impact? No, he's James T. Kirk, he's not gonna let the Enterprise get destroyed, he's gonna save it no matter what.2. Benedict Cumberbatch is white & British.Kahn, being revived by admiral Marcus, could've been given plastic surgery, as well as an alias & his skin could've paled from being frozen for too long. As to why he's British instead of Hispanic in his accent, got me. His performance tells you he's a worthy successor to the original actor in every way, for the most part.3. Spock gets too emotionalIt's been almost 50 years of seeing Spock be as Vulcan & emotionless as possible. This alternate version of him has had s*** thrown at him since the last movie, where he lost his planet & mom. In this, he's sort of started adapting to human culture on Earth; starting to get jokes, insults, etc that are thrown at him, which his original self would've let fly over his pointed-eared head. He's also been bested by an equally inelegant adversary to himself, who's helped kill his friend & he feels the need to avenge him. So much, that he lets his Vulcan-fueled emotions run wild, as he chases Kahn down the streets & in the air in California, besting Kahn, only to be stopped when Uhura, his girlfriend in this timeline, tells him to stop because they need him to save Kirk. I feel his emotional release is perfectly called for, since now we see why Vulcans can't/shouldn't be allowed to express their emotions freely & regularly.Overall, I find this movie great, as long as you're like me & feel that every era in Star Trek has their merits on their own & should only be judged upon the era it belongs to. Hope you found this at least slightly helpful in at least seeing this movie at least once, which I suggest you do, to see if you at least like it.

1589430,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B009934S5M,Turfseer,"[8, 17]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I'm happy to report that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superior to the ho-hum 2009 initial Reboot. Here you get two villains for the price of one; they manage to be much more fleshed out than the bald Romulan, Nero, in the 2009 film, an unlikeable sadist of a character, who viewers could never warm up to.At least the two villains in 'Into Darkness', Starfleet's Admiral Marcus, and the genetically engineered superhuman, rogue Starfleet agent, John Harrison (aka 'Khan'), operate on the surface, with some sort of (albeit twisted), moral imperative. Marcus is sort of a futuristic Dick Cheney run amok, determined to provoke a war with the Klingons, who he fears will soon destroy the Federation. And Khan, who resorts to terrorism when he blows up a secret Starfleet installation in London, is actually trying to get back at Marcus, who has stashed 72 of his superhuman comrades inside photon torpedoes, which end up on the Enterprise.After Kirk's mentor, Admiral Pike, is killed by Khan, in a direct attack on Starfleet headquarters in San Francisco, Marcus correctly calculates that the impulsive Kirk, will gladly follow his 'shoot to kill' orders, and take out Khan, who has fled to Chronos, the Klingon home world. Kirk's impulsivity is what makes him interesting. Don't ask me why it's necessary for Marcus to place the 72 'pod people' in the photon torpedoes, because after all, Kirk could eventually disobey his orders and they could be discovered, which could mean bad news for Marcus, back at Starfleet. But that's exactly what happens. So why didn't Marcus dispose of Khan's 72 buddies before he orders Kirk to go after Khan? Some internet posters have suggested that Marcus wants to 'stick it to' Khan after he becomes a turncoat. Khan will die with the knowledge that all members of his race will die with him, at the same moment.If Kirk happens to have a little of 'Marcus' in him in his thirst for revenge, it's up to his 'United Nations' crew members, to become more 'balanced' and bring Kirk back into the fold, so he conforms to acceptable behavior, within the context of international (or shall we say, 'universal') law. 'Scotty' is first to sound the trumpet of 'lawful behavior', when he resigns his commission after he's banned from inspecting the torpedoes. And then Spock, Bones and Uhura, who today would make a great team on a Commission of Human Rights, convince Kirk to take Khan alive.'Into Darkness' really picks up in terms of plot, when a series of reversals keep us guessing as what's going to happen next. Marcus attacks the Enterprise and disables it; Kirk offers to give up Khan and the 72 cryogenically frozen ones but before Marcus can kill everyone, Scotty infiltrates Marcus' unmarked Federation starship, the USS Vengeance, and causes a power outage; after Kirk and Khan do a 'space jump' to the Vengeance, Khan manages to kill Marcus and take over the ship. But Spock manages to beam the torpedoes onto the USS Vengeance, explode them, causing the ship to become incapacitated, just like the Enterprise.There's a spectacular scene as Khan crashes the USS Vengeance into Starfleet Academy in San Francisco as well as his apprehension by Spock and Uhura (please rest assured that in the future, there are still cable cars operating in San Francisco!).'Into Darkness' could have been a masterpiece except for the unfortunate fact that it is wholly derivative. Kids who are not familiar with earlier Trek movies, might not realize that when Kirk saves the ship by going into the radiation chamber and has an emotional farewell with Spock, that's almost a direct rip-off from Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Except in the earlier film, the roles are reversed: it's Spock who gets radiated, dies and saves the ship! I know this is supposed to be a tribute to Wrath of Khan, but tributes should not be direct copies. It's an example of LAZY Screen writing.Examples of additional laziness abound in Reboot #2. Consider how easy it is that Kirk is revived when they discover Khan's blood has restorative properties. One unexplored implication is that many people on earth will now be resurrected from death, by simply tapping into the blood supply of the 72 pod people, once they are brought out of suspended animation.There are plenty of more scenes that are copies from earlier Trek incarnations. Take for example, the opening scene, where the Prime Directive is violated. How many times did we see that before? Another group of indigenous peoples, being saved by the noble crew of the Enterprise. Or how about the 'machine gun' attack on Starfleet Headquarters or when Kirk and Khan, do the 'space jump'? You'll just have to ignore In Darkness' lack of originality, if you want to enjoy this film.The story is also enhanced by how the screenwriters give the supporting players, their moment in the sun. I happen to favor Simon Pegg as the best actor in the film and enjoyed how he disabled the ship, in the proud tradition of the original Scotty, James Doohan. Bones is nicely utilized when he helps out arming the torpedoes and saves Kirk; Uhura helps Spock subdue Khan and Chekov has some nifty moments, below deck. Sulu also manages to get in the act by some death-defying piloting.Spare me all the little petty arguments between Kirk and Spock as well as the aforementioned copycat radiation chamber scene. Nonetheless, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, are becoming much more comfortable as worthy precursors of Shatner and Nimoy.Now that J.J. Abrams has improved his reboot, it's high time that he steps up his game and comes up with a truly original screenplay for the third installment. Keep the copycat stuff to a minimum.

I can only wish they'd start a series with the same people which I believe they could do excellent job with that and still once in a while do another movie. But since the time shift with the previous movie they could take a newer series just about into any direction. It's nice to see that the star Trek could keep going. As it is with the newer actors they have a great mesh together and appear to work well in their characters so why not make a series.I really would like to see this come out as a series again. It's been long enough for us fans that a star trek series hasn't been done in quite a while. Plus hopefully which ever network were to do it isn't stupid like the previous ones at CBS and not schedule it on a Friday Night when they'd get less viewers. Put is up on like a Thursday or Wednesday when they'd get more people to watch it. Plus even if they weren't able to do that and had it on a Friday today there's DVR's and amazon where people could buy their episodes they'd for sure get the ratings and the sales from advertisers to more than pay for it. There's too many of us star trek fans out there to just forget us. After all look at the history of it even newer generations are watching. Hopefully someone in Hollywood is listening or maybe an advertisers that would love to sponsor such a new series. They should at least give it a try. After all the older original series only lasted 3 seasons only because the final season they moved it to Friday. Now days the day of the week doesn't really matter with DVRS and DVD recorders and amazon instant videos. Anymore these days I my new stuff there less chance of my movie getting damaged or lost or stolen.If you like any of the star trek movies or series you'll love this movie.,5,star trek reborn again,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,1850,"['was', 'very', 'good', 'kept', 'same', 'line', 'original', 'newer', 'actors', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'can', 'only', 'wish', ""'d"", 'start', 'series', 'same', 'people', 'believe', 'could', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'still', 'once', 'while', 'do', 'movie', 'time', 'shift', 'previous', 'movie', 'could', 'take', 'newer', 'series', 'just', 'direction', 'nice', 'see', 'star', 'Trek', 'could', 'keep', 'going', 'newer', 'actors', 'have', 'great', 'mesh', 'together', 'appear', 'work', 'well', 'characters', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'series.I', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'series', 'again', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'fans', 'star', 'trek', 'series', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'quite', 'while', 'hopefully', 'ever', 'network', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'previous', 'ones', 'CBS', 'not', 'schedule', 'Friday', 'Night', 'when', ""'d"", 'get', 'less', 'viewers', 'Put', 'up', 'Thursday', 'Wednesday', 'when', ""'d"", 'get', 'more', 'people', 'watch', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'do', 'had', 'Friday', 'today', 'DVR', 'amazon', 'where', 'people', 'could', 'buy', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'sure', 'get', 'ratings', 'sales', 'advertisers', 'more', 'pay', 'too', 'many', 'star', 'trek', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'just', 'forget', 'look', 'history', 'even', 'newer', 'generations', 'are', 'watching', 'Hopefully', 'someone', 'Hollywood', 'listening', 'maybe', 'advertisers', 'would', 'love', 'sponsor', 'new', 'series', 'should', 'least', 'give', 'try', 'older', 'original', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', '3', 'seasons', 'only', 'final', 'season', 'moved', 'Friday', 'Now', 'days', 'day', 'week', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'DVRS', 'DVD', 'recorders', 'amazon', 'instant', 'videos', 'days', 'new', 'stuff', 'there', 'less', 'chance', 'movie', 'getting', 'damaged', 'lost', 'stolen.If', 'star', 'trek', 'movies', 'series', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie']",Star Trek Into Darkness

I enjoy it for what it is, and I am completely hooked. I was in love with the reboot when it came out in 2009 and this sequel was so worth the wait. As far as I know it still takes place in the alternate time-line so liberties were taken and new events can take place because of it. This is a fast-paced action film, but it is also a film about friendship, and forging bonds. It really is all about Spock and Kirk and they couldn't have done it better than this. Zachary Quinto is simply extraordinary in this. He stays perfectly in character, no matter the situation. His professional relationship with Kirk is just amusing to witness simply for the fact that they are polar opposites. They bicker, disagree on almost everything and yet you can see the evolvement of both their character's throughout the movie. When they are on screen together, you know you are in for a treat, even when the unexpected happens and the most subtle scene becomes the most poignant. The rest of the cast is top-notch as well, with a few characters getting less screen time than the first, but understandable for this particular film. However, it is Benedict Cumberbatch that absolutely steals the film. You can't take your eyes off of him. His voice, so dark and full of promise, so elegant, with a touch of crazy. He is perfect and I hope to see much more from him in future films.Let's talk about the score. It's fantastic. Very rarely do I lose concentration during a fight scene to admire the music, but here it happens quite often. Just a great, effective musical score. The special effects/CGI are all done to perfection. As somone who IS picky about that, I can say I don't have any complaints regarding the production value of Into Darkness. I can't wait for the Blue-ray. If it looked that great on the big screen, I look forward to seeing how it looks with perfect clarity in my living room. Star Trek Into Darkness is a great film for those not really into Star Trek. I didn't think I would care much for the reboot, as I'm not a huge sci-fi fan. But I was hooked from the first scenes, and now, I am completely open to watching the original films as well.

The 2009 Star Trek reboot was a surprise hit with audiences and critics that no one really saw coming.  When I first saw the trailer for that film I thought I was looking at a last desperate attempt to make Star Trek relevant.  Much to my surprise I ended up applauding at the end of the reboot.  It was fast paced, well-acted, and visually extraordinary- the most entertaining space opera to hit the big screens since the original Star Wars trilogy.  More importantly, it managed to breathe new life into the Star Trek franchise.  Trek was cool, and except for some Trek purists out there, everyone applauded the film.Now 4 years have passed.  There is now a high expectation on a Trek film that was not placed on the 09 entry.  I had my doubts.  Star Trek 2009 was a surprise; a great blockbuster that few saw coming.  Into Darkness rides in four years later and had to meet expectations set by the 09 film...And it did!Star Trek Into Darkness is what a quality summer blockbuster and sequel should be.  It doesn't slow itself down at any points and gets straight to what the audience cares about.  Character development and interactions are handled in such a way that the film never gets boring, and the narrative moves forward without many stalls.  At times I found myself on the edge of the seat, and throughout the entire film I legitimately felt for the characters and wanted to know how the conflict would be resolved.  This movie knows how to take a basic plot and transform it into Grade-A entertainment.We cannot address Into Darkness without discussing its villain.  Many complained about the blue collar villain Nero in the '09 Trek (I personally enjoyed him, but the masses have spoken) and we do get a vastly superior antagonist in the form of Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock).  Cumberbatch is a menacing, physically imposing, charismatic figure who easily dominates every scene he appears on screen for.  In other words: everything Nero was not.  Although I think some Trek purists may complain about this character for spoiler related matters I think most viewers will just accept him for the outstanding performance.The only  fault I can think of is that the film isn't any larger in scale than the previous...In fact, given the last one's villain was destroying entire planets, Into Darkness may be somewhat of a step back in scale.  But this movie didn't need to be like The Dark Knight where each film raises the stakes.  As a continuation of a long running franchise Into Darkness is exciting, has genuine humor, suspense, visual spectacle, superb action, and character moments.  It is what every popcorn film should strive to be.Of course, some fans will complain over the emphasis on action over political intrigue and such.  I get it, I love that stuff in the show, but we just have to accept that we're dealing with two different mediums.  If you're going to make a blockbuster movie you have to appeal to the masses, and Abrams Star Trek movies do it incredibly well.If you are one of those Star Trek purists who cannot accept the changes made in the 2009 reboot you're better off steering away from this entry as it will probably give you more to gripe about.  But if you're a casual Trek fan like me who loved the 2009 film you will not be disappointed.",5,They've done it again!,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,3389,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'crew', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'success', 'franchise', '2009', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', 'was', 'surprise', 'hit', 'audiences', 'critics', 'one', 'really', 'saw', 'coming', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'looking', 'last', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'make', 'Star', 'Trek', 'relevant', 'Much', 'surprise', 'ended', 'up', 'applauding', 'end', 'reboot', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'well-acted', 'visually', 'extraordinary-', 'most', 'entertaining', 'space', 'opera', 'hit', 'big', 'screens', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'More', 'importantly', 'managed', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'Trek', 'was', 'cool', 'Trek', 'there', 'everyone', 'applauded', 'film.Now', '4', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'now', 'high', 'expectation', 'Trek', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'placed', '09', 'entry', 'had', 'doubts', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'was', 'surprise', 'great', 'blockbuster', 'few', 'saw', 'coming', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'meet', 'expectations', 'set', '09', 'film', 'did', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'what', 'quality', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'sequel', 'should', 'be', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'points', 'straight', 'what', 'audience', 'Character', 'development', 'interactions', 'are', 'handled', 'such', 'way', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'narrative', 'moves', 'forward', 'many', 'stalls', 'times', 'found', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'film', 'legitimately', 'felt', 'characters', 'wanted', 'know', 'how', 'conflict', 'would', 'be', 'resolved', 'movie', 'how', 'take', 'basic', 'plot', 'transform', 'Grade-A', 'entertainment.We', 'can', 'not', 'address', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'discussing', 'villain', 'Many', 'complained', 'blue', 'collar', 'villain', 'Nero', ""'09"", 'Trek', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'masses', 'have', 'spoken', 'do', 'get', 'vastly', 'superior', 'antagonist', 'form', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'Sherlock', 'Cumberbatch', 'menacing', 'physically', 'imposing', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'who', 'easily', 'scene', 'screen', 'other', 'words', 'everything', 'Nero', 'was', 'not', 'think', 'Trek', 'purists', 'may', 'complain', 'character', 'spoiler', 'related', 'matters', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'just', 'accept', 'outstanding', 'performance.The', 'only', 'fault', 'can', 'think', 'film', ""n't"", 'larger', 'scale', 'previous', 'fact', 'given', 'last', 'one', 'villain', 'was', 'destroying', 'entire', 'planets', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'may', 'be', 'somewhat', 'step', 'back', 'scale', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'where', 'film', 'stakes', 'continuation', 'long', 'running', 'franchise', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'exciting', 'genuine', 'humor', 'suspense', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'superb', 'action', 'character', 'moments', 'what', 'popcorn', 'film', 'should', 'strive', 'be.Of', 'course', 'fans', 'will', 'complain', 'emphasis', 'action', 'political', 'intrigue', 'such', 'get', 'love', 'stuff', 'show', 'just', 'have', 'accept', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'two', 'different', 'mediums', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'have', 'appeal', 'masses', 'Abrams', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'do', 'incredibly', 'are', 'one', 'Star', 'Trek', 'purists', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'changes', 'made', '2009', 'reboot', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'steering', 'away', 'entry', 'will', 'probably', 'give', 'more', 'gripe', 'about', ""'re"", 'casual', 'Trek', 'fan', 'who', 'loved', '2009', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Success was helped by casting excellent actors and keeping the story moving at a fast pace.  Somehow with the rapid forward movement, character development has some time to ferment but not enough for the supporting cast because of time limitations.  The 2nd foray with this crew is a twist on a original series story and for me it works.

The previous (reboot-franchised) film had the character development, INTO DARKNESS had more character development without the elongated, integrated plots. The main plots are lackluster. The acting is excellent, so believable that in moments, I felt as though I was in the film, in space, however, the writing and direction is too surface. The previous film is one that is a must-see. INTO DARKNESS begins with the crew running, the film ""hits the ground running"" and that is a great idea for a a film with 1 premise, however, this film has so many side-plots being played out, none of the plots are given proper time to play out.Star Trek INTO DARKNESS could have been epic, I had great expectations with no spoilers when I watched this film. I wasn't the only person whom thought the film was lackluster & fleeting, the family watched all at once and agreed after that this film is too flawed in production. With actors at pinnacles of their craft, the writing, direction and even the graphic effects were less than stellar.That being said, I recommend watching the first film.

I watched this twice on my 55"" Samsung 8000 series LED TV. There is absolutely nothing to distract. No banding, artifacting, etc. This is as perfect an image as possible, short of actually being in the movie. I do not give such ratings lightly, when it comes to video or audio quality. I am generally very unforgiving, when it comes to that sort of thing. Video wise, this is a perfect Bluray.(And yes, the lens flares are in this one too. Get over it.)Audio: Fair ...at best. 3 stars. Played through an Onkyo 7.2 receiver powering Definitive Technology speakers. 7006's (built in 300W subs) as mains. A BP8 as a center channel, and 4 350's as side and rear channels. I mention all that because these are excellent speakers (merely a good receiver) and you need to know where I'm coming from and why I rated the audio so poorly. The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track is only okay. Bass is mostly fine. There are a very few slightly weak points but nothing troubling. That's not to say the bass is fantastic either. It's quite good but never hits that level of true awesomeness that I expected from this movie. The mids and highs are simply fall down dead. Weak, anemic, and lame all come to mind as good adjectives. There is a lot of audio surround going on. Phasers, explosions, and such in front, to the side and behind. Stuff whizzing by. It's wild and chaotic and it's supposed to be. The problem is it sounds like hell. The mids and highs both sound flat and utterly lacking in any clarity. I even turned the volume WWWWAAAAAYYYYYY up for a time to really, really listen. The goodness just isn't there. Even in the fairly subdued scenes (few as they are), there's a fair amount of background audio going on. It sounds slightly muffled and it's somewhat difficult to discern to the point of being quite distracting. The dialog suffers all of the same issues as the rest of the track. Flat and empty. It never gets to the point of indecipherable which I suppose is a plus. Although I did have to turn my center level up much higher than I normally keep it. +12 dB instead +2dB. I'd almost say the audio track is lossy but I didn't hear any of the tell tale slight warble or tinniness that comes with compressed audio. Still, I'm not convinced it isn't lossy. Honestly, I think the culprit here is Dolby True-HD and bad mastering. I strongly suspect this would have been a 5 star track, if it had been DTS-HD Master.Having given the audio as much of a thrashing as I just did (told you I was unforgiving), you will now likely be surprised to find that I haven't gotten to the critical flaw I mentioned in my title. Here it is. The audio is out of sync with the video. This is absolutely, 100% UNFORGIVABLE! That goes for any movie, of course, but especially for one of this pedigree. It gets worse. Okay so any halfway decent Home Theater setup can delay the audio to make it sync up. That's the thing, I couldn't fix it. My receiver can set a delay in 10 ms increments. 20 isn't enough and 30 is ever so slightly too much.There's no excuse for this. Paramount ruined an otherwise great movie experience with a hack job on the audio in their rush to get the disc on shelves so they could dive into additional profits like Scrooge McDuck.  I'm terribly disappointed with this audio. If I find a Bluray with DTS-HD audio then this copy will immediately become my new beer coaster. Thanks Paramount. &lt;--- That sentence is known as sarcasm. I will never pre-order a movie again.",4,Fantastic but with one very critical flaw.,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,4032,"['may', 'read', ""'m"", 'Trek', 'fan', ""'m"", 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.The', 'movie', 'easily', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Perhaps', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'precisely', 'right', 'word', 'event', 'one', 'rare', 'sequels', 'equal', 'predecessor', 'predecessors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'Star', 'Trek', 'regardless', 'generation', 'one', 'things', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'amount', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'will', 'change', 'that.Video', 'Excellent', '5', 'stars', 'down', 'watched', 'twice', '55', 'Samsung', '8000', 'series', 'LED', 'TV', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'distract', 'banding', 'artifacting', 'etc', 'perfect', 'image', 'possible', 'short', 'actually', 'being', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'such', 'ratings', 'lightly', 'when', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'am', 'generally', 'very', 'unforgiving', 'when', 'sort', 'thing', 'Video', 'wise', 'perfect', 'Bluray', 'yes', 'lens', 'flares', 'are', 'one', 'too', 'Get', 'Audio', 'Fair', 'best', '3', 'stars', 'Played', 'Onkyo', '7.2', 'receiver', 'powering', 'Definitive', 'Technology', 'speakers', '7006', 'built', '300W', 'subs', 'mains', 'BP8', 'center', 'channel', '4', '350', 'side', 'rear', 'channels', 'mention', 'are', 'excellent', 'speakers', 'merely', 'good', 'receiver', 'need', 'know', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', 'why', 'rated', 'audio', 'so', 'poorly', '7.1', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'audio', 'track', 'only', 'okay', 'Bass', 'mostly', 'fine', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'slightly', 'weak', 'points', 'nothing', 'troubling', 'not', 'say', 'bass', 'fantastic', 'either', 'quite', 'good', 'never', 'level', 'true', 'awesomeness', 'expected', 'movie', 'mids', 'highs', 'are', 'simply', 'fall', 'down', 'dead', 'Weak', 'anemic', 'lame', 'come', 'mind', 'good', 'adjectives', 'lot', 'audio', 'surround', 'going', 'Phasers', 'explosions', 'such', 'front', 'side', 'behind', 'Stuff', 'whizzing', 'wild', 'chaotic', 'supposed', 'be', 'problem', 'hell', 'mids', 'highs', 'sound', 'flat', 'utterly', 'lacking', 'clarity', 'even', 'turned', 'volume', 'WWWWAAAAAYYYYYY', 'up', 'time', 'really', 'really', 'listen', 'goodness', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'Even', 'fairly', 'subdued', 'scenes', 'few', 'are', 'fair', 'amount', 'background', 'audio', 'going', 'slightly', 'muffled', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'discern', 'point', 'being', 'quite', 'distracting', 'dialog', 'same', 'issues', 'rest', 'track', 'Flat', 'empty', 'never', 'point', 'indecipherable', 'suppose', 'plus', 'did', 'have', 'turn', 'center', 'level', 'up', 'much', 'higher', 'normally', 'keep', '+12', 'dB', 'instead', '+2dB', ""'d"", 'almost', 'say', 'audio', 'track', 'lossy', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'tell', 'tale', 'slight', 'warble', 'tinniness', 'compressed', 'audio', 'Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', ""n't"", 'lossy', 'Honestly', 'think', 'culprit', 'here', 'Dolby', 'True-HD', 'bad', 'mastering', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'would', 'have', 'been', '5', 'star', 'track', 'had', 'been', 'DTS-HD', 'Master.Having', 'given', 'audio', 'much', 'thrashing', 'just', 'did', 'told', 'was', 'unforgiving', 'will', 'now', 'likely', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'critical', 'flaw', 'mentioned', 'title', 'Here', 'audio', 'sync', 'video', 'absolutely', '100', '%', 'UNFORGIVABLE', 'movie', 'course', 'especially', 'one', 'pedigree', 'worse', 'Okay', 'halfway', 'decent', 'Home', 'Theater', 'setup', 'can', 'delay', 'audio', 'make', 'sync', 'up', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'fix', 'receiver', 'can', 'set', 'delay', '10', 'ms', 'increments', '20', ""n't"", 'enough', '30', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'too', 'excuse', 'Paramount', 'ruined', 'otherwise', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'hack', 'job', 'audio', 'rush', 'get', 'disc', 'shelves', 'could', 'dive', 'additional', 'profits', 'Scrooge', 'McDuck', ""'m"", 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'find', 'Bluray', 'DTS-HD', 'audio', 'then', 'copy', 'will', 'immediately', 'become', 'new', 'beer', 'coaster', 'Thanks', 'Paramount', 'lt', 'sentence', 'known', 'sarcasm', 'will', 'never', 'pre-order', 'movie', 'again']",Star Trek Into Darkness

Kirk violated the Prime Directive in the process of saving these people and Spock's life. Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood--a great actor well cast)takes command of the Enterprise back from Kirk and convinces Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) to let Kirk be his First Officer while Spock is reassigned.Deciminated by a terrorist attack by a former Star Fleet member John Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch), Marcus allows Kirk to take command of the Enterprise to hunt down Anderson and kill him. Unforunately for Kirk and his crew they discover a conspiracy that leads back deep into the heart of Star Fleet putting them at risk from both their own and Anderson.End of Spoilers:The second film in the reboot for Star Trek isn't quite as consistent as the first but it does build on the characters.How Does it Look? ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" looks marvelous with rich detail and depth to the image. The 3D version looks nice for a post-production conversion (it wasn't shot in 3D)but, at times, suffers from ""viewmaster syndrome"" i.e., while the image has depth it doesn't look as natural as 3D productions shot in the format. The dark look of the film also can be an issue at times but, overall, the 3D version looks pretty good.The conventional Blu-ray has amazing depth, detail and I didn't note any artifacts on first viewing making this a demo disc for me.The audio is lossless and sounds terrific. Audio is also presented in 5.1 for the following: French, Spanish and also has English Audio Description. We get subtitles in a variety of languages including English, French, Spanish and Portuguese.The seven featurettes on included with the disc are solid but could have been far more indepth. We get the following featurettes that run from 2 to 8 minutes: Creating the Red Planet focuses on the opening sequence and how the world we see was created with CG and practical effects;Attack on Starfleet; The Klingon Home World focuses on the reimagined Klingon's;The Enemy of My Enemy features Abrams and Cumberbatch discussing the villian of the film; Ship to Ship with previz compared to final footage and Brawl by the Bay focusing on Spock's fight at the conclusion.For a big title like this there is always the chance you're going to be double dipped and all those special features that were spread out among three different retailers will, later, show up in a deluxe edition. It just sucks that Paramount's marketing department has decided to do this to fans. It was an unfortunate decision on Paramount's marketing department that will prevent many fans from buying this as very few people will want to purchase three copies of the same movie on Blu-ray just to get all the special features.""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" fuses elements of the reboot with a classic Trek bad guy and elements from other classic Trek episodes to create a compelling, entertaining fushion that touches on ""Trek"" as well as J.J.

That is no small feat, but Abrams has managed it with a thoroughly engaging story and plot, and a cast of outstanding young actors.  The CG effects and everything else are, of course, first rate as well, something you would naturally expect from an Abrams film.  All of the younger actors channel their older counterparts with an amazing amount of authenticity.  It was a lot of fun watching them as they adopted the accents and mannerisms of the old guard with such skill.  Zachary Quinto's voice could have perhaps been lowered considerably to match the tonal properties of the original Spock/Nemoy, but this is just one of a few minor quibbles.  Beside,doing so would have probably come across as phony and inauthentic in any event.Karl Urban does a wonderful early version of the irascible Bones.  Urban is, in my opinion, a very interesting and talented young character actor who reminds me a lot of Gary Oldman or Dustin Hoffman in their ability to transform themselves so thoroughly like human chameleons). Another incredibly talented actor in this piece is Benedict Cumberbach as the evil Pike.  I first noticed Cumberbach as the modern day version of Sherlock Holmes in the unfortunately short-lived series of that same name.  He was, in my opinion, the best flim version of Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen.  FYI:  I am a HUGE Conan Doyle fan and am thoroughly acquainted with the behavior and mannerisms of Doyle's Holmes and Cumberbach managed to absolutely nail Holme's personality down in a way that no other actor has.Star Trek into Darkness has been thoroughly reviewed by others far more capable than myself, but I will only say that it is a must see for any serious sci-fi fan, such as myself.

Don't get me wrong, I love all the previous movies in the franchise too, its just that these movies really capture the magic of that first love.I greatly enjoyed the 2009 movie ""Star Trek"" so I had high expectations for this film. I think this movie surpassed my expectations. This movie has everything a Trekkie like myself could want. This movie is chocked full of action and adventure, and an intriguing story/plot with wonderful and moving character development all bound up in great eye caching special effects.I will not rehash the plot here but I do want to mention the addition of Khan as the villain. I was not sure if this would work. Ricardo Montalban was very iconic playing the role of Khan in the original series episode ""Space Seed"" and the feature film ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and I really wondered if Benedict Cumberbatch could pull it off.

JJ Abrams et al. eschewed the 1.1 million remaining Star Trek fans and focused on making main stream entertainment for the masses.  And oh no!  The fanboys were betrayed.  And oh no!  This is a Star Trek movie that feeds into the lowest common denominator eschewing logic, story plot and true character motivation for simple thrills and big bangs.  To be honest there are movies franchises that I feel betray the story and true inner essence like the Star Trekkies feel towards this.  It's utter crap that we have to watch meaningless drivel instead of movies that are far more directly related and are extension of the tv series, graphic novels, novels, fan fiction and other media that these unique and special universes live in.  But Hollywood just ain't going to invest $200million or so in making a hardcore faithful movie just for the fanboys.  No it's a bit dishonest that Hollywood really gives off that impression at all the comic cons across the country.  They go in and show special sneak 10min previews just using the fanboys for the marketing aspect.  But movies are way too big business and way too much potential money on the table to not keep using and cranking out the same formulaic dreck.Personally I was bored trying to watch the original Star Trek series even with the HD fancy schmancy cgi they added a couple years back.  But I fully understand the Trekkies abject horror to what they are seeing happen to their beloved franchise on the big screen.  True Tolkein fans may finally have it hit them across the brow with the &#34;Hobbit 2: desolation of a child's book.&#34;  It happened with me every time i see a Marvel movie.  But I don't see the movie adaptations as the culmination of the story/universe/franchise of any great modern tale.  Yep, it's can fill your belly with untold amounts of indignation to see your favorite story universe get smeared up on the big screen like it's a can of processed cheese for the masses to consume and think they are now Star Trek devotees.  But most people aren't watching Into Darkness cause they love Star Trek they watch it cause they love this big over the top formulaic action packed movies and this particular one simply had carbon copies of characters like Spock, Capt Kirk and the ensign in red uniform.*On a side note; when they same thing happens with Star Wars none of us can use this same argument.  Star Wars began life on the big screen and has been the template for the big over the top formulaic action packed movie.  And Lucas had years ago said that he never looked at the EU as canon (kinda like St Ignatius scoffing at the Gospel of Thomas.)  So JJ Abrams is probably the best one to make the Star Wars sequel but if he don't keep to a strict 3 years time line then we need Brad Bird waiting in the wings.",5,Heresy abounds!

""Me!""","[4, 6]","Even though the original series debuted well before I was born, I was a huge fan of the original star trek and to this day it remains my favorite.  The next generation was too obvious in it's attempt to be politically correct which often gave a dishonest sort of feel to it and though the original series is lacking in PC qualities and certainly isn't perfect, I find its honesty and its honest portrayal of characters appealing.  Which is why I found the reboot so disappointing and this film is no different.  First of all the acting in this film is horrible.  The characters are reduced (or perhaps a better term is- overdone) to caricatures of themselves. The only actors who do a good job are Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock and Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan.  These were the only performances that made the movie remotely worth it. John Cho was a decent Sulu... the rest were a joke. The characters of the original series are the richest, most distinct and perhaps the most complex of all in the star trek universe and yet what they are reduced to here is little more than a bunch of cute sayings and snippets that make them look like cartoon versions of themselves. The script didn't help matters. Many of the lines given to Spock were things that his character would never have said in his youth and the script tries too hard to pull heart strings without succeeding.  Somehow you end up feeling more empathy for Khan than for any of the good guys even when they are dying.  And then there are all the holes in the story which like in the first movie they don't bother to explain because they are hoping everyone watching is too dumb to look past the explosions to notice them.  The only good thing about this reboot being done so poorly is that it opens the door for another much better reboot in the future.  This movie caters to the lowest denominator; people who just want to see things explode and punches thrown without caring about whether the actual movie/story is any good. Sure- everyone likes explosions every now and then; that's why we see the fireworks on the 4th of July, but they are the same every year; which is fine because it's only once a year so they are still special.  But with these types of movies it seems they are all the same and they come out with a whole lot of the same every year.  You would think with all the millions they throw at these films they could actually put some creative energy into it and make the audience walk away actually feeling something.  Khan and Uhura to be the most engaging and interesting characters on the screen which does not fair well considering the star is supposed to be Captain Kirk.

Brilliant.Let me just say that I am not the type of person to describe a movie as ""brilliant"" but that's all I could think walking out of this movie!THE GOOD-The plot was smart and entertaining. Not quite something we've never seen before, but it's still really well crafted. J.J. Abrams proves once again he is a great story teller when it comes to directing. Summary: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is struggling with his responsibilities as captain. But When Starfleet is attacked by one of their own (Benedict Cumberbatch) Kirk must prove if he truly has what it takes to command The Enterprise, and if his crew can find the terrorist and bring him to justice. I know a lot of hard core Trekkies are thinking ""Oh, great, Star Trek has become a simple popcorn flick"". Don't worry, plenty of twists and turns (along with a few Easter Eggs and nods to the original series).-Acting is absolutely perfect. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and the rest of the Enterprise cast all give great performances as the iconic crew. Newcomer Benedict Cumberbatch steals every scene he is in, giving an impressive (and intimidating) performance as the film's villain, John Harrison. There are no bad performances in the movie.-Effects are incredible. The action is exhilarating while enhanced by the 3D. The CGI is great, but the impressive set designs and practical effects should not be overlooked.-Very fast pacing, not a dull moment here. despite the film's length, it goes by pretty fast. Very entertaining beginning to end.THE BAD-Pacing is great, but probably TOO fast. There should be at least a few more minutes in the middle to give audiences time to breathe! Probably one are two more action sequences than there needs to be (although they are all fantastic and well done).-Too much lens flare. It works for a lot of the movie, but is seriously over used. It can be pretty distracting from what's going on at times.Overall, there are very few problems with the movie (for me). There are certain twists that take the movie back to source material from the original series, which work really well. There are also certain events from other Star Trek movies that, in a way, repeat themselves in this story. I wouldn't call this a remake, cause this is a new series that takes place in an alternate timeline, due to the time travel that occurred in the first movie from 2009. Point is, some of theses ""events"" that repeat themselves some fans will love, others will hate. Again, there are certain parts of the film (for the hard core Trekkies) that will be hit or miss.As a casual fan of the Star Trek franchise, I loved this movie. Not ALL of the throwbacks to classic Star Trek work, but I at least appreciated them. This isn't just an entertaining action movie, it's a good movie in general.

Second, the original Kahn was a freaking genius, not just a throwaway monster. Thirdly, the war-hungry admiral plot could've worked as its own movie without stomping the memory of Kahn into mud. The 'Kirk violates the rules and gets rewarded' schtick is old and we're only two movies into the new franchise. Scotty's been relegated to a clown.

The brevity of Kirk&#8217;s demotion makes it unnecessary, especially in light of the last movie and its juggling of who&#8217;s really the captain.3. The original Kahn learned how to take over a starship while recovering from centuries of cryogenic slumber. The guy was physically awesome, but his enormous ego and intellect made him a wonderful villain. This Kahn&#8217;s brilliance occurred mostly off screen, before the opening scene. If he&#8217;d been Ricardo Montelban brilliant, he&#8217;d have done something cleverer to put the Dreadnaught into his hands.4.

It's not bad plot-wise if (like most sci-fi movies) you are willing to ignore a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies.  Chris Pine's acting has improved somewhat.  SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ FURTHER IF HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW:  The tension of the scene where he is confronted by Peter Weller (ship to ship) is probably the best acted scene in the movie.  It's well written as Pine/Kirk parries the Admirals authority and steps cagily and confidently while holding his ground when the chips are down.  Scotty, McCoy and Uhuru seem more comfortable and developed in their roles.  My complaint is that the writers had to go back and mine the Khan from the old franchise.  Cumberbatch is a good villain smart, intense, edgy.  I'm just worried what the franchise will do for the next installment if they get into a habit of not writing new stuff.  Also, how did Khan (Cumberbatch) survive 72 torpedoes going off on that ship?  For that matter, how did the ship itself survive intact with all those explosions?  72 torpedoes onboard?  Oh yeah, that's right I'm not supposed to think about that.  The Carol Marcus backstory gets fitted into this episode. Supposedly some critics have complained about CGI on this film.  I don't have any problem with the quality of it's CGI rendering on this film.  It looks no more or less convincing  than a zillion other high budget sci-fi movies.

While I really liked the development of the iconic Original Series characters, the ending of the film (spinning it off into the parallel universe) left a very bad taste in my mouth.  I really wanted to see Chris Pine's Kirk turn into Bill Shatner's Kirk, for example...not an entirely new imagining of the characters.  Thus, during the four year interim, I put the onus on J.J. to completely win me over to his way of viewing the Trek story.  With ""Into Darkness"", he did just that!For a basic plot summary, this film once again sees Captain James Kirk (Pine), First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto), Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), and the rest of the crew manning the starship U.S.S. Enterprise.  When terrorist James Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) detonates an explosive device in England, the Enterprise takes the lead in figuring out just exactly what is going on and proposing the best plan to set things straight again.This is a tough film to review because of potential major spoilers, so the above was about as generic of a plot description as one can give (!).  Truth be told, it is a very complex film that harkens back to many themes running through multiple Original Series adventures.From my point of view, though, the biggest reason that this may be the best film I see all summer is because it sets J.J.'s Trek canon right in accordance with my Trek fan-dom.  Any doubts I had about his ability to tell an interesting Trek story are now completely gone.  If you, like me, were left feeling a little bitter after the ending of the original (2009), trust me when I say that you will ""get it"" after watching ""Into Darkness"".Of course, all the ""little things"" also add up to create a completely engaging experience.  The visuals are worthy of Trek science fiction, the dialogue is snappy and contains doses of humor at vital points, the acting is spot-on, and the soundtrack (from Michael Giacchino) is as much of a treat as anything.Thus, ""Into Darkness"" may very well be the best film I see for some time to come.  Without giving away any key details of the plot, what I can say is that the film has the ability this time to totally please both the casual fan and the hardcore Trekkie.  My only fear?  That J.J. will get caught up in ""Star Wars"" and not continue with the wonderful ""Trek"" franchise he has now nurtured back to life!",5,The Last Remnant Of Doubt Is Gone...Star Trek Is Back!,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,2474,"['big', 'fan', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'everything', 'Trek', 'loved', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', '2009', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'point', 'really', 'liked', 'development', 'iconic', 'Original', 'Series', 'characters', 'ending', 'film', 'spinning', 'off', 'parallel', 'universe', 'left', 'very', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Kirk', 'turn', 'Bill', 'Shatner', 'Kirk', 'example', 'not', 'entirely', 'new', 'imagining', 'characters', 'Thus', 'four', 'year', 'interim', 'put', 'onus', 'J.J.', 'completely', 'win', 'way', 'viewing', 'Trek', 'story', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'did', 'just', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'sees', 'Captain', 'James', 'Kirk', 'Pine', 'First', 'Officer', 'Spock', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Leonard', 'Bones', 'McCoy', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'rest', 'crew', 'manning', 'starship', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'When', 'terrorist', 'James', 'Harrison', 'Benedict', 'Cumberbatch', 'explosive', 'device', 'England', 'Enterprise', 'lead', 'figuring', 'out', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'proposing', 'best', 'plan', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'again.This', 'tough', 'film', 'review', 'potential', 'major', 'spoilers', 'above', 'was', 'about', 'generic', 'plot', 'description', 'one', 'can', 'give', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'very', 'complex', 'film', 'back', 'many', 'themes', 'running', 'multiple', 'Original', 'Series', 'point', 'view', 'biggest', 'reason', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'see', 'summer', 'J.J.', 'Trek', 'canon', 'right', 'accordance', 'Trek', 'fan-dom', 'doubts', 'had', 'ability', 'tell', 'interesting', 'Trek', 'story', 'are', 'now', 'completely', 'gone', 'were', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'bitter', 'ending', 'original', '2009', 'when', 'say', 'will', 'get', 'watching', 'Into', 'Darkness', '.Of', 'course', 'little', 'things', 'also', 'add', 'up', 'create', 'completely', 'engaging', 'experience', 'visuals', 'are', 'worthy', 'Trek', 'science', 'fiction', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'doses', 'humor', 'vital', 'points', 'acting', 'spot-on', 'soundtrack', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'as', 'much', 'treat', 'anything.Thus', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'see', 'time', 'come', 'giving', 'away', 'key', 'details', 'plot', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'ability', 'time', 'totally', 'please', 'casual', 'fan', 'hardcore', 'Trekkie', 'only', 'fear', 'J.J.', 'will', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'Star', 'Wars', 'not', 'continue', 'wonderful', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'now', 'nurtured', 'back', 'life']",Star Trek Into Darkness
