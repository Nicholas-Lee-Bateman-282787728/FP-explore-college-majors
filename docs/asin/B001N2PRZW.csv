1219009,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001N2PRZW,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[2, 2]","This is an interesting independent film, it's not great, it's just well above average. The story has been told many times over, but there was something endearing and heartwarming about this film. And for maybe the first time ever, thankfully, John Ratzenberger isn't Cliff Clavin. No this time John is a wonderful, cranky, overweight old man, that we have probably all met at one time or another.The film is about the owner of a barbershop, whose partner just died. He has a sad outlook, a deep rooted routine, drinks and gambles too much, and misses his wife who died 11 years earlier. The story comes alive when Gloria (Shelly Cole) arrives and shows Art the goodness in life. This would feel like the same old story over and over again, but The Village Barbershop has a warm heart that keeps the story moving forward and the viewer wanting more.Technically, a very low budget film. There's a fair number of editing mistakes, shots held too long, cuts that don't make sense, or begin too early. The director may have edited this film very quickly, there are pieces of the film that don't add up perfectly, story lines that are left hanging, and unexplained or supported events later in the film. It's not horribly important or distracting, just a flaw in the film.Production is just fine, Art's house and the barbershop are captured perfectly. It's hard to understand why this film had to be set in Reno. The city was almost a distraction, it didn't have to be any particular city. In some ways, the dumpier the better. I loved the Airstream trailer.The soundtrack is wonderful. I really enjoyed the indie (with country / Cowboy Junkies influence) music by Brittany Shane. There is a great little present at the official movie website, thevillagebarbershop dot com, four of the songs are available for preview. Decked Out Brittany Shane. The film recording is simply work a day voice recording, nothing wrong with it, just nothing outstanding.Shelly Cole reminds me a bit of an older Ellen Page (Juno). She's just quirky enough. I enjoyed her chemistry with John Ratzenberger. The supporting cast was just right, characters that you would enjoy getting to know (with the exception of Gloria's truck driving boy friend).An hour and forty minutes, some threads could have been trimmed. But there are many holes that should have been patched better. The film is R rated, mostly for language. There's a moment of nudity in a strip club, not anything anyone would ever expect incidently. There's no violence.The DVD is a strange one. There are bonus features. Except these have to be the absolute stranges features ever included on a DVD. Feature one - a movie slide show on the history of barbershops (balloon words with pictures of barbershops). Feature two - a travel advertisement for Reno (totally strange). Feature three - a written interview with the director (really bad). Feature four - written bios for Shelly Cole, John Ratzenberger, and Cindy Pickett. All very strange.Not a great film. But a film that restores your faith in people doing nice things for eachother just because they can.",4,Good Independent Film,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,3096,"['interesting', 'independent', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'just', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'something', 'endearing', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'maybe', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'thankfully', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', ""n't"", 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'No', 'time', 'John', 'wonderful', 'cranky', 'overweight', 'old', 'man', 'have', 'probably', 'met', 'one', 'time', 'another.The', 'film', 'owner', 'barbershop', 'partner', 'just', 'died', 'sad', 'outlook', 'deep', 'rooted', 'routine', 'drinks', 'gambles', 'too', 'much', 'wife', 'who', 'died', '11', 'years', 'earlier', 'story', 'alive', 'when', 'Gloria', 'Shelly', 'Cole', 'Art', 'goodness', 'life', 'would', 'feel', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'over', 'again', 'Village', 'Barbershop', 'warm', 'heart', 'story', 'moving', 'forward', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more.Technically', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'fair', 'number', 'editing', 'mistakes', 'shots', 'held', 'too', 'long', 'cuts', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'begin', 'too', 'early', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'edited', 'film', 'very', 'quickly', 'are', 'pieces', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'perfectly', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'unexplained', 'supported', 'events', 'later', 'film', 'not', 'horribly', 'important', 'distracting', 'just', 'flaw', 'film.Production', 'just', 'fine', 'Art', 'house', 'barbershop', 'are', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'set', 'Reno', 'city', 'was', 'almost', 'distraction', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'particular', 'city', 'ways', 'dumpier', 'better', 'loved', 'Airstream', 'trailer.The', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'indie', 'country', '/', 'Cowboy', 'Junkies', 'influence', 'music', 'Brittany', 'Shane', 'great', 'little', 'present', 'official', 'movie', 'website', 'thevillagebarbershop', 'dot', 'com', 'four', 'songs', 'are', 'available', 'preview', 'Decked', 'Out', 'Brittany', 'Shane', 'film', 'recording', 'simply', 'work', 'day', 'voice', 'recording', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'just', 'nothing', 'outstanding.Shelly', 'Cole', 'bit', 'older', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Juno', 'just', 'quirky', 'enough', 'enjoyed', 'chemistry', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'characters', 'would', 'enjoy', 'getting', 'know', 'exception', 'Gloria', 'truck', 'driving', 'boy', 'friend', '.An', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'threads', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'are', 'many', 'holes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'patched', 'better', 'film', 'R', 'rated', 'mostly', 'language', 'moment', 'nudity', 'strip', 'club', 'not', 'anything', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'expect', 'incidently', 'violence.The', 'DVD', 'strange', 'one', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'have', 'be', 'absolute', 'stranges', 'features', 'ever', 'included', 'DVD', 'Feature', 'one', 'movie', 'slide', 'show', 'history', 'barbershops', 'balloon', 'words', 'pictures', 'barbershops', 'Feature', 'two', 'travel', 'advertisement', 'Reno', 'totally', 'strange', 'Feature', 'three', 'written', 'interview', 'director', 'really', 'bad', 'Feature', 'four', 'written', 'bios', 'Shelly', 'Cole', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'Cindy', 'Pickett', 'very', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'faith', 'people', 'doing', 'nice', 'things', 'eachother', 'just', 'can']",The Village Barbershop
1219010,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001N2PRZW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","THE VILLAGE BARBERSHOP (2008) was an unfortunate flop for its star John Ratzenberger, who has continued his stellar career doing voices for Pixar. In this gem of a comedy, old fashioned barber Art (Ratzenberger) loses his partner just a few years after losing his wife - and very nearly loses his shirt in a conflict over his rented barbershop. When the free-spirited and hip young helper (Shelley Cole) arrives, Art barely knows what to do with her. Soon he will learn, or rather recall, what happy youth was like.This movie has some classic comedy in it, with a perfect and subdued performance by Ratzenberger - who shows just what an accomplished actor he is. Not many of his ilk could handle a role of this weight ... and be a romantic lead also. Ratzenberger takes it all in his stride, and I'm frankly ashamed that he did not get many more roles after doing this film. He earned his spurs long ago, and while I love catching his voice in the Pixar cartoons, he deserves a few more feature films.This was filmed in Las Vegas, where it is set (not in a ""small town"" as some reviews say). It's fun, aside from some adult language and situations I think it's a good family film, and it is a film classic that just fell through the cracks.Get this. I for one am tired of these films being made only to be ignored, forgotten then 'lost'.

1219012,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001N2PRZW,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 5]","***1/2""The Village Barbershop"" is a modest, unassuming little indie comedy set in the unusual locale of Reno, Nevada.Art Leroldi (the wonderful John Ratzenberger) is the cantankerous old-school barber whose business has fallen onto such hard times that he is at risk of losing the establishment that he and his recently deceased partner have run for many years.  Against his better judgment, he hires a free-spirited young woman (the endearing Shelly Cole) to serve as both his accountant and fellow haircutter at the shop.  At first, both Art and his conservative customers have a hard time adjusting to this frightening new-world-order of gender equality, but through her expertise with the scissors and the force of her personality, Gloria eventually manages to win them over to her side.Given this undeniably slight storyline, it's obvious that this movie was never going to exactly set the world on fire - but within the admittedly humble parameters that he's set for himself, writer/director Chris Ford has succeeded in creating a sweet and amusing regional comedy filled with sparkling performances and generous dollops of local color.  Ratzenberger and Cole have charm and likeability to spare, and their scenes together are played with understated warmth and humor.  Their performances alone compensate for the occasional overindulgence in indie-brand quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality.A minor film but an enjoyable one.",3,slight but generally charming indie comedy,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,1435,"['***1/2', 'Village', 'Barbershop', 'modest', 'unassuming', 'little', 'indie', 'comedy', 'set', 'unusual', 'locale', 'Reno', 'Nevada.Art', 'Leroldi', 'wonderful', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'cantankerous', 'old-school', 'barber', 'business', 'fallen', 'such', 'hard', 'times', 'risk', 'losing', 'establishment', 'recently', 'deceased', 'partner', 'have', 'run', 'many', 'years', 'better', 'judgment', 'free-spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'endearing', 'Shelly', 'Cole', 'serve', 'accountant', 'fellow', 'haircutter', 'shop', 'first', 'Art', 'conservative', 'customers', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'frightening', 'new-world-order', 'gender', 'equality', 'expertise', 'scissors', 'force', 'personality', 'Gloria', 'eventually', 'win', 'over', 'side.Given', 'undeniably', 'slight', 'storyline', 'obvious', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'exactly', 'set', 'world', 'fire', 'admittedly', 'humble', 'parameters', 'set', 'writer/director', 'Chris', 'Ford', 'succeeded', 'creating', 'sweet', 'amusing', 'regional', 'comedy', 'filled', 'sparkling', 'performances', 'generous', 'dollops', 'local', 'color', 'Ratzenberger', 'Cole', 'have', 'charm', 'likeability', 'spare', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'played', 'understated', 'warmth', 'humor', 'performances', 'alone', 'compensate', 'occasional', 'overindulgence', 'indie-brand', 'quirkiness', 'feel-good', 'sentimentality.A', 'minor', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'one']",The Village Barbershop

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 3]","With all the huge blockbusters cranked out by the major studios filling the multiplexes each weekend with big budget action pictures - or duds which depend on blockbuster names - it's films like this little gem which only get exposure at small regional film festivals, and by word of mouth on DVD. Actually you have probably only found this listing and review if someone recommended it to you and I'm here to give just one more recommendation that you don't miss this film.There are no big stars here - unless you were a huge fan of TV's ""Cheers"" and remember John Ratzenger as Cliff, the mailman. (I was not so I didn't have a character image of Ratzenger in my mind before viewing this film.) He is perfect for the role of the barber who is struggling to make a living in suburban Reno, Nevada. He is matched is his talent by Shelly Cole, as the young woman who made some made ""life"" decisions and now wants to get her life in order.Writer Director Chris Cole is practically never mentioned in the publicity for this film but without him there would be no ""Village Barbershop"". Hos background was in commercials and this project is his first screenplay and film and yet you'd never know that. The script is tight and the film is the right length. His directorial skills shine on ""little images"" like the Chinese fortune cookie messages mounted around a mirror in one frame. (You'll remember that image days after viewing the film.)I don't even want to discus the plot here because it will only distract from the surprises. This is a ""small film"" and is best enjoyed without too much advance plot hints.The DVD comes with some bonus features - which are creative but short. One is a 2-minute history of the occupation of ""barbering"". The other is a 2-minute history of Reno, Nevada, where Cole lives and where the film was shot. Not much, but a nice touch.The print is excellent and the songs on the soundtrack provide just the right amount of atmosphere.Do yourself a favor and give this film a chance. Then tell your friends and they'll tell their friends. Hopefully Cole will get enough recognition to go back to paper and camera and make another film.
