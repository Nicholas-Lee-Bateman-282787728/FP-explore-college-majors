772060,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0000C0FGY,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[32, 33]","This DVD contains five of Alan Jackson's videos that come from his Greatest Hits Volume II CD, as well as ""It's All Right to be a Redneck"" off the ""When Somebody Loves You"" CD,  and are a treat; it's priced reasonably and packaged as ""Disc 1"", so doesn't last long (approximately 23 minutes), but the content is nevertheless strong.Alan's excellence as a songwriter, musician, and performer make him one of my favorite artists in any genre, and I especially love the beautiful Kieran Kane song, ""I'll Go on Loving You"", with it's floating dancer and terrific effects.The DVD comes with no credits for the videos, as far as authorship or director; you get the six videos, and no more, but it's not quantity but quality here, and there's a lot of quality, and worth it for ""I'll Go on Loving You"" alone, as well as ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"", which means so much to so many of us.# 1, ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere""; the big hit Alan co-authored and sings with Jimmy Buffett, and includes two bartenders with some fancy moves !# 2, ""I'll Go on Loving You""; Kieran Kane's gorgeous song, with a perfect interpretation by Alan. One of my favorite videos by any artist in any genre.# 3, ""Little Bitty""; Tom T. Hall's song is full of rich color and fun, with a dancing scarecrow.# 4, ""It's Alright to be a Redneck""; very entertaining with lots of good reasons from a diverse group of people.# 5, ""When Somebody Loves You""; Alan wrote this lovely song, and it's filmed in b&w;, with some marvelous stop-action photographic effects.# 6, ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"", Alan's moving lyrics express what many of us felt on that tragic day in September, and his teary-eyed rendition is heartfelt and sincere.",5,"lots of quality, if not much quantity",1095292800,"09 16, 2004",2004,1738,"['DVD', 'five', 'Alan', 'Jackson', 'videos', 'come', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'Volume', 'II', 'CD', 'as', 'well', 'All', 'Right', 'be', 'Redneck', 'When', 'Somebody', 'CD', 'are', 'treat', 'priced', 'reasonably', 'packaged', 'Disc', '1', 'so', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'approximately', '23', 'minutes', 'content', 'nevertheless', 'strong.Alan', 'excellence', 'songwriter', 'musician', 'performer', 'make', 'one', 'favorite', 'artists', 'genre', 'especially', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Kieran', 'Kane', 'song', ""'ll"", 'Go', 'Loving', 'floating', 'dancer', 'terrific', 'effects.The', 'DVD', 'credits', 'videos', 'as', 'far', 'authorship', 'director', 'get', 'six', 'videos', 'more', 'not', 'quantity', 'quality', 'here', 'lot', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'Go', 'Loving', 'alone', 'as', 'well', 'Where', 'Were', 'When', 'World', 'Stopped', 'Turning', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'us.', '1', 'Five', ""O'Clock"", 'Somewhere', 'big', 'hit', 'Alan', 'co-authored', 'sings', 'Jimmy', 'Buffett', 'two', 'bartenders', 'fancy', 'moves', '2', ""'ll"", 'Go', 'Loving', 'Kieran', 'Kane', 'gorgeous', 'song', 'perfect', 'interpretation', 'Alan', 'One', 'favorite', 'videos', 'artist', 'genre.', '3', 'Little', 'Bitty', 'Tom', 'T.', 'Hall', 'song', 'full', 'rich', 'color', 'fun', 'dancing', 'scarecrow.', '4', 'Alright', 'be', 'Redneck', 'very', 'entertaining', 'lots', 'good', 'reasons', 'diverse', 'group', 'people.', '5', 'When', 'Somebody', 'Alan', 'wrote', 'lovely', 'song', 'filmed', 'b', 'w', 'marvelous', 'stop-action', 'photographic', 'effects.', '6', 'Where', 'Were', 'When', 'World', 'Stopped', 'Turning', 'Alan', 'moving', 'lyrics', 'express', 'what', 'many', 'felt', 'tragic', 'day', 'September', 'teary-eyed', 'rendition', 'heartfelt', 'sincere']",N/A

Mr. Jackson spoke for the voice of American in this heartbreaking song. It's a voice of tragedy, as well as salvation - and hope. Singing with a most persuasive bittersweetness, Jackson captured, for all time, the sentiments all of us felt on that awful day when, indeed, the world stopped turning.  Thanks to Jackson for this heartfelt expression of a black day that affected all of us. He is the voice of America.
