The arm-wrestling action is the most appetizing part of this film. It's all about the stomach-twisting action. Stallone gives a great performance: dim-witted but lovable. Machismo bleeds everywhere in Over the Top. Unlike many male films, Over the Top is an outstanding picture where testosterone rules the world. It's definitely a top five great Stallone picture.6/06: Forget the kid. Forget the sob story. Focus on the arm wrestling action. That's what Over the Top is all about. It's a perfect role for Sylvester Stallone. ""You got guys from M.I.T., and you got guys who can't spell M.I.T."" reads the tagline of Over the Top. What I loved about this film is that there are two sides: the pretentiousness that the kid shows and the grunt machismo where muscle, attitude, and trash talking prevail. This is what this film intends to show that there is no room for flowers in a man's world. Pure testosterone bleeds everywhere. The highlight of Over the Top is the arm wrestling action, complemented by the competitors, the audience, and the atmosphere. It's definitely pure entertainment. Arm wrestlers eating cigars, drinking out of motor oil can, and trash talking with pounds and pounds of muscles, intense mentality, and do-or-die attitudes. It's all about one thing: beat this punk. Over the Top is an excellent movie for its unusual display of arm wrestling sport. Of course, the story between the kid and the father is a nice touch, and it did have some purpose. But okay, forget that anyway. Arm-wrestling extravaganza dominates Over the Top.6/08: Over the Top is hands down the best arm wrestling film made. Of course, it's the only film of its genre. And that's why there ought to be another movie about arm wrestling and the competitiveness nature it entails. Over the Top is not thoroughly focused on arm wrestling but rather a small part of it. The sob story between the kid and his father has to go; it sucks and takes away the flow of the film. I couldn't bleeding care about the kid and whether he finds a father or not in the process. What I wanted to see in Over the Top is the intensity and ferocity by the adrenaline junkie arm wrestlers; it's absolutely fantastically unbelievable and sky-high awesome movie experience. Mad Dog Madison goes crazy and drinks motor oil; Grizzly eats a cigar; Bull Hurley torches everybody with his piercing eyes; and a lot of head slapping moments. That's the best part of Over the Top; the competition and the wild atmosphere of that circuit certainly got me pumped up. Sadly, there wasn't enough of that because the first hour is must wasted on building up the story between Lincoln Hawk and his son. That gets a `1' from me. The final half hour is mostly arm wrestling moments which are undisputedly the meat of the film. I'll give it a `9' for its uniqueness. Over the Top averages out as `5' for me. The most confusing part about the picture is the use of Lincoln's last name; is it Hawk or Hawks? Why can't this fact be kept straight? The rule during the championship is also confusing; it kept saying that it's a double elimination contest, but does it not apply in the semifinal and final? I love the double personality shows of each character when one is really sky-high pumped up and then shows a calm, reticent persona during interviews. A couple of moments showing a guy getting his arm broken during matches are unbelievable, and they are a sad fact of the sport. I remember when I saw a special edition of arm wrestling national championship on ESPN2, one guy said word-for-word quotes to describe his thinking before the contests, and ""Second sucks"" immediately comes to my mind. No question without Over the Top, arm wrestling would undeniably be a very obscure sport although is deserving of much recognition. All in all, the story killed Over the Top and slowed down the picture a lot, but the atmosphere and the blood-pumping moments in underground arm wrestling world are the stuff of greats. I'm bringing down the rating `7' to `5'.",3,The Ooze of Machoism.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,4122,"['Viewed', '11/03', '7/05', '6/06', '6/08Rate', '57/05', 'Top', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'also', 'ultimate', 'Stallone', 'film', 'arm-wrestling', 'action', 'most', 'appetizing', 'part', 'film', 'stomach-twisting', 'action', 'Stallone', 'great', 'performance', 'dim-witted', 'lovable', 'Machismo', 'bleeds', 'everywhere', 'Top', 'many', 'male', 'films', 'Top', 'outstanding', 'picture', 'where', 'testosterone', 'rules', 'world', 'definitely', 'top', 'five', 'great', 'Stallone', 'picture.6/06', 'Forget', 'kid', 'Forget', 'sob', 'story', 'Focus', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'action', 'what', 'Top', 'perfect', 'role', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'got', 'guys', 'M.I.T.', 'got', 'guys', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spell', 'M.I.T', 'tagline', 'Top', 'What', 'loved', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'pretentiousness', 'kid', 'shows', 'grunt', 'machismo', 'where', 'muscle', 'attitude', 'trash', 'talking', 'prevail', 'what', 'film', 'show', 'room', 'flowers', 'man', 'world', 'Pure', 'testosterone', 'bleeds', 'everywhere', 'highlight', 'Top', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'action', 'complemented', 'competitors', 'audience', 'atmosphere', 'definitely', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Arm', 'wrestlers', 'eating', 'cigars', 'drinking', 'motor', 'oil', 'can', 'trash', 'talking', 'pounds', 'pounds', 'muscles', 'intense', 'mentality', 'do-or-die', 'attitudes', 'one', 'thing', 'beat', 'punk', 'Top', 'excellent', 'movie', 'unusual', 'display', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'sport', 'course', 'story', 'kid', 'father', 'nice', 'touch', 'did', 'have', 'purpose', 'forget', 'anyway', 'Arm-wrestling', 'extravaganza', 'Top.6/08', 'Top', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'film', 'made', 'course', 'only', 'film', 'genre', 'why', 'ought', 'be', 'movie', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'competitiveness', 'nature', 'Top', 'not', 'thoroughly', 'focused', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'rather', 'small', 'part', 'sob', 'story', 'kid', 'father', 'go', 'away', 'flow', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'bleeding', 'care', 'kid', 'father', 'not', 'process', 'What', 'wanted', 'see', 'Top', 'intensity', 'ferocity', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'arm', 'wrestlers', 'absolutely', 'fantastically', 'unbelievable', 'sky-high', 'awesome', 'movie', 'experience', 'Mad', 'Dog', 'Madison', 'crazy', 'drinks', 'motor', 'oil', 'Grizzly', 'cigar', 'Bull', 'Hurley', 'torches', 'everybody', 'piercing', 'eyes', 'lot', 'head', 'slapping', 'moments', 'best', 'part', 'Top', 'competition', 'wild', 'atmosphere', 'circuit', 'certainly', 'got', 'pumped', 'up', 'Sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'first', 'hour', 'must', 'wasted', 'building', 'up', 'story', 'Lincoln', 'Hawk', 'son', '1', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'mostly', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'moments', 'are', 'undisputedly', 'meat', 'film', ""'ll"", 'give', '9', 'uniqueness', 'Top', 'averages', 'out', '5', 'most', 'confusing', 'part', 'picture', 'use', 'Lincoln', 'last', 'name', 'Hawk', 'Hawks', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fact', 'be', 'kept', 'straight', 'rule', 'championship', 'also', 'confusing', 'kept', 'saying', 'double', 'elimination', 'contest', 'not', 'apply', 'semifinal', 'final', 'love', 'double', 'personality', 'shows', 'character', 'when', 'one', 'really', 'sky-high', 'pumped', 'up', 'then', 'calm', 'reticent', 'persona', 'interviews', 'couple', 'moments', 'showing', 'guy', 'getting', 'arm', 'broken', 'matches', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'sad', 'fact', 'sport', 'remember', 'when', 'saw', 'special', 'edition', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'national', 'championship', 'ESPN2', 'one', 'guy', 'said', 'word-for-word', 'quotes', 'describe', 'thinking', 'contests', 'Second', 'sucks', 'immediately', 'mind', 'question', 'Top', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'would', 'undeniably', 'be', 'very', 'obscure', 'sport', 'deserving', 'much', 'recognition', 'story', 'killed', 'Top', 'slowed', 'picture', 'lot', 'atmosphere', 'blood-pumping', 'moments', 'underground', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'world', 'are', 'stuff', 'greats', ""'m"", 'bringing', 'down', 'rating', '7', '5']",N/A

338899,A2N84VEBTQFDSU,6302816580,"C.J. Roger ""C.J. Roger""","[4, 6]","When you think of Sylvester Stallone most of the times movies like Rocky and Rambo come to mind. But there were a few other gems he has done in the 1980's that should be noted as fun and interesting watches 20 years later.Over the Top is one of these films that you may have never heard about but should check out. Sylvester Stallone plays a truck driver named Lincoln Hawk who left his wife and son 10 years earlier due to the over baring and wealthy grandfather to his son Michael. Now with his wife that he hasn't been with in years dying, she has a request for father and son to reunite and get in some over due bonding time while they travel the road together. The grandfather Jason Cuttler, played by Robert Loggia is less then happy with the situation and wants his grandson returned to him at all costs.The story is more then just a son and father reunited situation. It also deals with an arm wrestling competition in Las Vegas that will act as the exciting climax to the movie. Hawk is a new comer to arm wrestling competitions but seems to hold his own in private battles at local truck stops. If he can win this tournament he can get a new truck and have money to hopefully start his own company. But most of all prove his worth to a son who he owes a lot of lost time and love to.While money wise, the movie was a dud in the box office, it has picked up a cult-following of sorts due to it's nostalgic and feel good story.  A lot of 1980's themes will be found in this movie. Most notably with the music soundtrack that blares at us in the opening and closing credits and throughout various driving moments on the road.  Sylvester Stallone really shines as well as a quiet, yet aggressive man who wants to be a father and drive a truck more then having any amount of money. The chemistry between Stallone and Loggia is interesting but far fetched at points. Loggia may come off as a little over the top and silly even in his schemes to keep the father and son apart so he can have him back.The only real downsides of the movie are the weak plot points. Some moments seemed rushed through like the role of the mother in this film and everyone rushing to Las Vegas for the films climax. Michael cries a lot and seems to be over acting at moments. And the way the writers tried to make his grandfather seem like a real selfish SOB but also give him a little heart was confusing if not out of place in the story. A few moments could have been done a little better but for the most part this is a very good feel good movie but also has a lot of action. Some of it again is forced like him using his truck to break into the Bel Aire home of said grandfather and pushing one of the henchmen through a door as it shatters to dust. A little 'over the top' ironicly.The best parts probably are the arm wrestling moments itself. The big underdog taking on really muscular and massive men that could even make some wrestlers shake in fear. Calm and steady Hawk taking them all on as they taunt him by drinking automobile oil from the can and giving him a bloody nose right before the match starts. The weird ""Double Elimination"" rules can make one wonder if that was put in for dramatic effects as they repeat that rule to us listeners at least 10 times so we get the point. Again seemed forced but the over all feel of the film is good fun and everything works out great for everyone involved and that's all one could expect from a movie of this time period.I definitely say give it a watch if you haven't seen it or have forgotten about it. Its a nice film that really showed a different side of Stallone and has a little something for everyone. I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets into the situation when his kid is yelling ""Over the top dad!"" as the tension mounts. A lost treasure from the past finally making its way to DVD. Not the best flim made but a lot of fun and a good trip down memory lane in one of those lost classics from Stallone.",4,"Interesting, often forgotten film from the 1980's",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,3952,"['When', 'think', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'most', 'times', 'movies', 'Rocky', 'Rambo', 'come', 'mind', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'gems', 'done', '1980', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'fun', 'interesting', 'watches', '20', 'years', 'later.Over', 'Top', 'one', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'truck', 'driver', 'named', 'Lincoln', 'Hawk', 'who', 'left', 'wife', 'son', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'due', 'baring', 'wealthy', 'grandfather', 'son', 'Michael', 'Now', 'wife', ""n't"", 'been', 'years', 'dying', 'request', 'father', 'son', 'reunite', 'get', 'due', 'bonding', 'time', 'travel', 'road', 'together', 'grandfather', 'Jason', 'Cuttler', 'played', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'less', 'then', 'happy', 'situation', 'grandson', 'returned', 'costs.The', 'story', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'son', 'father', 'reunited', 'situation', 'also', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'competition', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'will', 'act', 'exciting', 'climax', 'movie', 'Hawk', 'new', 'comer', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'competitions', 'hold', 'own', 'private', 'battles', 'local', 'truck', 'stops', 'can', 'win', 'tournament', 'can', 'get', 'new', 'truck', 'have', 'money', 'hopefully', 'start', 'own', 'company', 'most', 'prove', 'worth', 'son', 'who', 'lot', 'lost', 'time', 'love', 'to.While', 'money', 'wise', 'movie', 'was', 'dud', 'box', 'office', 'picked', 'up', 'cult-following', 'sorts', 'due', 'nostalgic', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'lot', '1980', 'themes', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'Most', 'notably', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'various', 'driving', 'moments', 'road', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'really', 'as', 'well', 'quiet', 'yet', 'aggressive', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'father', 'drive', 'truck', 'more', 'then', 'having', 'amount', 'money', 'chemistry', 'Stallone', 'Loggia', 'interesting', 'far', 'fetched', 'points', 'Loggia', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'top', 'silly', 'even', 'schemes', 'keep', 'father', 'son', 'apart', 'can', 'have', 'back.The', 'only', 'real', 'downsides', 'movie', 'are', 'weak', 'plot', 'points', 'moments', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'role', 'mother', 'film', 'everyone', 'rushing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'films', 'climax', 'Michael', 'lot', 'be', 'acting', 'moments', 'way', 'writers', 'tried', 'make', 'grandfather', 'seem', 'real', 'selfish', 'SOB', 'also', 'give', 'little', 'heart', 'was', 'confusing', 'not', 'place', 'story', 'few', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'little', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'action', 'again', 'forced', 'using', 'truck', 'break', 'Bel', 'Aire', 'home', 'said', 'grandfather', 'pushing', 'one', 'henchmen', 'door', 'dust', 'little', 'top', 'ironicly.The', 'best', 'parts', 'probably', 'are', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'moments', 'big', 'underdog', 'taking', 'really', 'muscular', 'massive', 'men', 'could', 'even', 'make', 'wrestlers', 'shake', 'fear', 'Calm', 'steady', 'Hawk', 'taking', 'taunt', 'drinking', 'automobile', 'oil', 'can', 'giving', 'bloody', 'nose', 'right', 'match', 'weird', 'Double', 'Elimination', 'rules', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'was', 'put', 'dramatic', 'effects', 'repeat', 'rule', 'listeners', 'least', '10', 'times', 'so', 'get', 'point', 'Again', 'seemed', 'forced', 'feel', 'film', 'good', 'fun', 'everything', 'out', 'great', 'everyone', 'involved', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'movie', 'time', 'definitely', 'say', 'give', 'watch', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'have', 'forgotten', 'nice', 'film', 'really', 'showed', 'different', 'side', 'Stallone', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'situation', 'when', 'kid', 'yelling', 'top', 'dad', 'tension', 'mounts', 'lost', 'treasure', 'past', 'finally', 'making', 'way', 'DVD', 'Not', 'best', 'flim', 'made', 'lot', 'fun', 'good', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'one', 'lost', 'classics', 'Stallone']",N/A

Also this is your typical Sly Stallone film with an inspirational message and all about over coming the odds. I know what you are thinking that is every Sly flick, but hey it is Sly. When we watched this again the other night after many years we called every thing in the film, all things 80's that is.The film follows Lincoln Hawk [Sly] has he is on a mission to make amends with the son he left behind many moons ago. The boy's mother is on her death bed and wants him to get to know his son before she goes. Of course the kid wants nothing to do with his estranged father and tries at all costs to get away. But as their journey counties he begins to get along with him that is until his mother dies before they get to see her. So they drift apart once more as the boy's grandfather has hired people to get the boy back with him. On top of all that Sly needs to win an arm wrestling tournament to get some money to buy his own rig.Sly is Sly and acts as such which for this type of movie is great, don't see how you could go wrong with the Sly. Robert Loggia is great as the grandfather in the way of the father and son, he does an excellent job. Susan Blakely is great for the small amount of time she is on screen but unfortunately her character dies but that kick starts the movie kinda. David Mendenhall is surprisingly good in this film since most child actors are not all that great and of course Terry Funk is always fun no matter what.Director Menahem Golan does a great job I think with an arm wrestling movie even if it is ""over the top""; sorry I had to say that again. The four writers for the film including Sly himself make things interesting but it is your typical 80's action b dialogue, got to love it. Still this is a very predictable film as any one who remembers anything from the 80's can call everything in this without having seen it before. The first thing I said when we started this was that there had to be a song that actually uses ""over the top"" as lyrics in the chorus, yup there it is in the end. The first thing my brother called was that at some point the title of the film would be used as lines in the film, yep there they are.This is a fun ""over the top"" 80's type flick that any Sly fan will enjoy, plus it has Terry Funk in it man. How could anything with the Funker in it be bad, I can't think of any. This is a fun weekend flick and pretty much a rental unless you want the Sly collection; I got it cheap so it was cool.",4,TERRY FUNK AND SLY IN THE SAME FLICK,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,2703,"['THE', 'TOPThere', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'sports', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'one', 'classic', '80', 'movie', 'top', '[', 'meant', 'say', ']', 'pop', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'man', 'love', 'em', 'Also', 'typical', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'film', 'inspirational', 'message', 'coming', 'odds', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'Sly', 'flick', 'hey', 'Sly', 'When', 'watched', 'again', 'other', 'night', 'many', 'years', 'called', 'thing', 'film', 'things', '80', 'is.The', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'Hawk', '[', 'Sly', ']', 'mission', 'make', 'amends', 'son', 'left', 'behind', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'boy', 'mother', 'death', 'bed', 'get', 'know', 'son', 'course', 'kid', 'nothing', 'do', 'estranged', 'father', 'tries', 'costs', 'get', 'away', 'journey', 'counties', 'get', 'mother', 'dies', 'get', 'see', 'drift', 'apart', 'once', 'more', 'boy', 'grandfather', 'hired', 'people', 'get', 'boy', 'back', 'top', 'Sly', 'win', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'tournament', 'get', 'money', 'buy', 'own', 'rig.Sly', 'Sly', 'acts', 'such', 'type', 'movie', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Sly', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'great', 'grandfather', 'way', 'father', 'son', 'excellent', 'job', 'Susan', 'Blakely', 'great', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'character', 'dies', 'kick', 'movie', 'kinda', 'David', 'Mendenhall', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'most', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'course', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'always', 'fun', 'matter', 'what.Director', 'Menahem', 'Golan', 'great', 'job', 'think', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'movie', 'even', 'top', 'sorry', 'had', 'say', 'again', 'four', 'writers', 'film', 'including', 'Sly', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'typical', '80', 'action', 'b', 'dialogue', 'got', 'love', 'Still', 'very', 'predictable', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'anything', '80', 'can', 'call', 'everything', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'thing', 'said', 'when', 'started', 'was', 'had', 'be', 'song', 'actually', 'top', 'lyrics', 'chorus', 'yup', 'end', 'first', 'thing', 'brother', 'called', 'was', 'point', 'title', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'lines', 'film', 'there', 'are.This', 'fun', 'top', '80', 'type', 'flick', 'Sly', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'man', 'How', 'could', 'anything', 'Funker', 'be', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'fun', 'weekend', 'flick', 'pretty', 'much', 'rental', 'want', 'Sly', 'collection', 'got', 'was', 'cool']",N/A

338906,AY12DBB0U420B,6302816580,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","My bargain-rack movie for last night was the ""Over The Top"" DVD starring Sylvester Stallone. I found it for under five bucks. Well, I've come to regard Stallone movies as little monuments to bad acting, and that was the case here. However, altogether this was a rather  entertaining movie and I enjoyed it. The movie was simple, straight forward, emotional and would probably appeal to any father with a little boy, such as me. Stallone played a tough but sensitive big-truck (18 wheeler) driver who was out to save his little boy from an unwanted adoption when his ex-wife was expiring. The grandfather, who had low regard for our hero, was trying to take over the boy and exclude Stallone. It turned into a complicated legal battle, of  course, and Stallone had little understanding or sympathy for the law. The movie had Stallone driving  from Colorado to Las Vegas where he was to participate in  the World Arm-Wrestling Championships. The boy accompanied Stallone part way (a rather touching part of the movie) until he was captured. He finally managed to escape and attend the Championship Event and watch his father emerge victorious.Well, Las Vegas was Las Vegas and it was so grotesque it was actually funny. The World Arm Wrestling Championships somehow fit Las Vegas, and it gathered Neanderthalic males from all over the world. Stallone fit in with the assembled crowd. Whoever put this movie together had a perverse sense of humor, and my hat is off to him/her. Good job! Stallone won, of course, but in a drawn out and dramatic fashion. He won the boy over and everyone, presumably, lived happily ever after. What can I say? It was an enjoyable movie. Lots of fun! The photography was  good. The background music got tiresome with all those oldie songs dominating, but I guess it fit. The acting was what you might expect in a Stallone movie, but the story moved  along rather  well.Gary Peterson",4,"An Enjoyable Movie. Lots of Fun.

The clever title is an obvious double-entendre in that it's a story about arm-wrestling that is completely ridiculous; yet, it somehow manages to be a highly enjoyable movie with real, albeit unanticipated, drama.Amidst the preposterous father-son bonding, in which a borderline mongloid named Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) shares a long-haul trucking get-together with his son, as well as the finer points of arm wrestling - via a pulley system generically rigged up by Hawk (pun intended) - there is one the most comical, unbelievable scenes in movie history.  While stopping for a bite to eat at a greasy spoon diner - in which Hawk's prissy, weakling, snowflake, WASP son preaches about the benefits of health food - Hawk decides that it is high time his son proves his worth and strength via an absurd arm-wrestling match staged between his son and a tough, street kid on top of a pinball machine.  I'll let you be ""surprised"" by the outcome.The ultimate arm wrestling showdown seems more like a collection of carnies or psych-ward patients than a group of competitors in an arm wrestling tournament.  There is a pretty good chance that there was no blood testing at the time of this event, and if there were, more than one guy would be found with horse steroids or psychotropic drugs in his system.  The favorite of the competition, Bull Harley, who seems like a villian in a video game because of his epic proportions, probably has stool bigger than Hawk's arms.  Through sheer will and determination, Hawk manages to spin his hat around and channel the energy of 100 suns in order to win the title.I'd feel bad about the spoiler if it weren't so painfully obvious and insignificant.

If that doesn't scream B to you then you're just not listening. There are just so many elements of B in this one. Namely the fact that they can't even decide if Sly's character's name is Lincoln Hawk or Lincoln Hawks. Then there's the great parenting skills displayed by Sly. The first time he sees his son in 10 years, he takes him to his big rig and tries to arm-wrestle him. The aforementioned big rig is equipped with a Lincoln original forearm press machine so he can hone his arm-wrestling skills while driving. Pure genius!Hawk is going to need the practice to face...Bull Hurley! This imposing 5 time world arm-wrestling champ's mantra is ""I drive truck, break arms, and arm-wrestle."" How you can take that in and not be rivited, I'll never know. Sid the Elf noticed something watching Over the Top. Most of Sly's movies are pretty much the same premise with interchangable plots and characters. To the B novice, Sly isn't the first name that comes to mind, but think again. Sly is that rare person who has a big name, but is really B with very few people making the observation. But thats what we, Sid the Elf are here for.This classic B flick easily recieves the Sid the Elf Seal of Approval.  Do yourself a favor and buy this one for years of priceless entertainment. This movie is a great choice for the novice B viewer due to it's sheer ridiculous content.  What other film can you find a competitor whose pre game meal is a cigar and a jug a valvoline motor oil?  We could go on until next weeks B review, but we'll end here.  Again if you are up for a good old fashioned B evening, pick up this work of art.  Just a heads up, be on the look out for a packed month of Sly reviews most likely starting in August.",5,Does it really get more B than a movie about an arm-wrestling truck driver?

338950,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,6302816580,The Cool Guy,"[4, 7]","Forget Rocky. Forget Rambo. Forget Marion Cobretti. What really put Stallone on the map in my opinion is ""Over the Top."" This movie is a true inspiration.I sometimes wonder if this movie was based on a true story. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. I remember when I was a kid watching this movie. Every time I watched this movie, I wished Stallone was MY dad. I still do. He would not only be the coolest and best-looking dad ever, but he would also be rich. (The only drawback being that he would have named me something like ""Sage Moonblood"" or ""Seargeoh"" instead of just ""Clint"", but that would still be cool. I wouldn't have to make up a name for when I play Dungeons and Dragons - I could just use my real name instead.)In this movie, the cool truck-driving dad teaches his young snot-nosed brat kid how to be a REAL man through arm-wrestling. Plus, it features a giant semi driving through the front of a house. Could anything be cooler than that? I don't think so. I mean, what else could anybody want in a movie anyway?I thought it was really neat how Stallone, a.k.a. Hawke, turned his hat around when he was really about to lay the arm-wrestling smack down. And the slow-motion arm wrestling scenes were really intense! I've probably watched this movie about 16 times so far, and each time I have found myself wondering if Hawke is really going to win. (Of course he does, but it makes the movie more exciting to watch over and over again if you pretend that you don't know!)Lots of times after I watched this movie, I would challenge my friends in school to a great Arm-Wrestling Duel. I would make sure that I wore my hat that day. I would challenge the big kid who made fun of me for having a wadded-up paper towel in my underwear (a little personal problem of mine), and would get ready to kick some... I would wait until he had my arm almost all the way down, and then I would turn my hat around backwards. Unfortunately, that never seemed to work for me like it did in the movie. I always got beat anyway (and then they'd give me a wedgie just for good measure).So that was disappointing, but I never lost my faith that one day the hat trick would work for me. I just chalked it up to Stallone not being on my team - not ""having my back"", so to speak. So even today so many years later, I try to solve my disputes through a good friendly arm-wrestling match. It's a great way to make friends, and it helps you to solve problems with your boss and the wife, too. I give Sylvester Stallone credit for teaching us this Peace Through Arm-Wrestling technique. In fact, it's more than a technique. It's a way of life.Stallone, you're my Hero.

Why, oh why, I ask, would ""Over The Top"" be on cable sixteen years after its release when all available copies should have been ceremoniously burned years ago?This ridiculous piece of filth is, quite possibly, the worst movie ever made.  Here's one hint as to just why this movie is so bad: it stars Sylvester Stallone as a sensitive, truck-driving arm wrestler trying to make up with his estranged son on the way to a competition.  Now, just read that sentence again.  That's right, ""Over the Top"" involves Sylvester Stallone trying to invest a dumb arm-wrestler with tenderness.  I'm pretty sure I could run through a brick wall before Sly could achieve such a feat.  And the script is every bit as bad as you could imagine, with dialogue so insipid and hackneyed that indecipherable gibberish written by a team of retarded, blindfolded monkeys would have been more intelligent.  I feel especially bad for the poor kid playing Stallone's son.  He must be about my age now, and he has to look back at this movie and see himself trying to breathe life into his stick figure of a character.  I think some of the lines and facial expressions he was assigned may well qualify as child abuse, or at least violate child-labor laws.  ""Over The Top"" probably ruined his career, just as it should have ruined Stallone's.  If that were me at around age eight, I'd probably still be in therapy.  I don't even think think ""Over The Top"" is good enough to qualify for ""so bad it's funny"" distinction.

In order to show the means to support the young boy, Hawk risks everything on his arm-wrestling skills in trying to win the grand prize of the national competition.Yep, seriously, that is the plot of this movie.  It is so cheesy that I almost wonder if it wasn't meant to be taken seriously in the first place.  It is so sappy that adults with an emotional intellect above a fifth grade level will laugh at the contrived drama and soap opera-ish acting from all participants.  In fact, this movie will actually be more enjoyed by action-oriented young children than any other demographic, as they will be completely sucked in by the one-dimensional and straightforward drama.Thus, while this may be a movie to watch with your young son, it really doesn't serve any other dramatic or entertainment purpose.  Either watch it just to enjoy the cheese, or prepare to put your eyes on ""perpetual roll"".",2,Pure Cheeseball Drama,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,1358,"['have', 'watched', 'lot', 'movies', 'years', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'one', 'easily', 'cheesiest', 'sappiest', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'pun', 'very', 'much', 'intended', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'way', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Top', 'focuses', 'uncultured', 'trucker', 'named', 'Lincoln', 'Hawk', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'trying', 'win', 'custody', 'stuck-up', 'son', 'Michael', 'David', 'Mendenhall', 'Michael', 'ruthless', 'filthy', 'rich', 'grandfather', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'order', 'show', 'means', 'support', 'young', 'boy', 'Hawk', 'everything', 'arm-wrestling', 'skills', 'trying', 'win', 'grand', 'prize', 'national', 'competition.Yep', 'seriously', 'plot', 'movie', 'so', 'cheesy', 'almost', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'first', 'place', 'so', 'sappy', 'adults', 'emotional', 'intellect', 'fifth', 'grade', 'level', 'will', 'laugh', 'contrived', 'drama', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'acting', 'participants', 'fact', 'movie', 'will', 'actually', 'be', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'action-oriented', 'young', 'children', 'other', 'demographic', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'sucked', 'one-dimensional', 'straightforward', 'drama.Thus', 'may', 'be', 'movie', 'watch', 'young', 'son', 'really', ""n't"", 'serve', 'other', 'dramatic', 'entertainment', 'purpose', 'watch', 'just', 'enjoy', 'cheese', 'prepare', 'put', 'eyes', 'perpetual', 'roll']",N/A
