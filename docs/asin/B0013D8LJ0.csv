Seven Wonders of the Industrial World should be seen by everyone---especially younger students.  There are many heroes long dead who deserve our admiration and thanks.  Three cheers for the engineers of the world.  They have indeed richly improved our lives.  Sadly, however, they are normally ignored.  I particularly enjoyed the segment regarding the construction of the London Sewer System.  One is also encouraged to read W.

The Hoover Dam and Brooklyn Bridge segments complimented, rather than duplicated, other documentaries I'd seen and the London sewer episode- which I thought would be a snore- was fascinating.
