931588,A2IVD0F8VZ7AQD,B000ARDGYK,"liliana ""liliana""","[0, 0]","I was pleasantly surprised with this kdrama series.  Acting was superb throughout.  I can see now why Rain is such a big star, and they actually have him sing a bit in the very last part of the series. The actors and the material seem to hallmark the golden age of Hollywood; with a lot of glamour, a cast that is multitalented, and scripts that showcase the actors talents and the screenplay; instead of the pyrotechnics of car crashes, the use of foul language or undressed bodies in private activities.This storyline is quite sweet, retelling the basic boy girl boy girl romance, with all the angst and pitfalls that lovers endure.  It also shows the family interaction and cross generation disturbances that occur as past and present mores clash in the story.  The actors pulled off their emotional rollercoaster beautifully, keeping well in character to build the fairy bubble that this romance is.  And while many sneer at romances, they are the most popular genre, both in book and video format.English subtitles were good, and I could follow along pretty easily.  The soundtrack was a series of american standards that had me going, ""oh yeah!  i remember that song!""  If you have the chance, this is definitely a keeper.

931589,AUDGV1OWJMOYD,B000ARDGYK,"Linda ""Linda Cameron""","[0, 0]","I have become addicted to Korean dramas starting with Dr. Jin, Rooftop Prince, Secret Garden and many more. I am watching Full House on Dramafever.com right now. I am about 2 and a half episodes from done. If this could have been shortened to about 10 episodes, I would give it 5 stars, but the past several episodes are pretty much the same thing over and over.This couple who are in love with each other but can't seem to figure it out are constantly hurting each other then making up for it and then doing it all again. After a while, things are said that can't be taken back (if this was real life). How many times do these two have to break each other's hearts before they can be happy? I have seen other reviews and the ending is happy, so I guess it is headed there but in the meantime, I am getting impatient. There needs to be more fun and good times for two people to want to put up with all the heartache.I have noticed that there are similar Korean dramas with the same formula. Somehow a girl and guy end up living in the same house and begin to have feelings for each other. There is always another girl and another guy who really want to be with these two people, so there is jealousy involved and the danger of losing to a rival.The guy who plays the lead is supposed to be a famous movie star and supposedly gets mobbed by fans anytime he is in public. Yet, he spends a lot of time having drinks in a bar with his old girlfriend. He also eats in restaurants. I guess the fans only show up when the writers want the viewers to know he is a popular movie star, but when they want him to do other things, he is free to do so.The rival girl is a bit on the bad side--selfish and scheming. The rival guy is a nice, rich guy. The girl in the lead is just sweet and pure as can be. The movie star is a basically good guy who is very immature. The two leads get married, but it is a contract between them, not a real marriage (for their own reasons). That makes it strange that the rival girl and rival guy both seem to think they should be able to steal the two away from each other--since the world thinks these two are a married couple. Strange storyline.

Han Ji-Eun also doesn't leave him alone and lies to him.I didn't like that Han Ji-Eun didn't pursue the thieves who stole her home and life saving. It just made the story unrealistic and sappy. There is nice, and then there is so nice that you don't protect your own self interest and Han Ji-Eun is the latter. Watching someone be victimized and not stand up for herself is not entertaining.
