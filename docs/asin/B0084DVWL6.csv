It is a work of fiction, not a proof of concept.  The writers could have made Julie turn into a watermelon if they wanted to.  Just because someone write the story this way does not mean that it will work this way.  If you get raped, feel free to do whatever floats your boat, including bake the rapist cookies, but, do NOT judge others who decide that they would rather burn their rapist alive or drown him in feces than forgive him.  Reality seldom follows a script.This movie does a disservice to real victims of violence.  There is no empirical rationale for the notion that forgiving a rapist will make you feel better.  This movie has the potential to make people who have suffered REAL violence feel even worse because they don't forgive their tormentors like the FICTIONAL Julie.",1,it is fiction,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,981,"['Try', 'keep', 'mind', 'notion', 'movie', 'forgiving', 'rapist', 'getting', 'know', 'troubles', 'will', 'somehow', 'benefit', 'victim', 'kid', 'simply', 'construct', 'work', 'fiction', 'not', 'proof', 'concept', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Julie', 'turn', 'watermelon', 'wanted', 'Just', 'someone', 'write', 'story', 'way', 'not', 'mean', 'will', 'work', 'way', 'get', 'raped', 'feel', 'free', 'do', 'floats', 'boat', 'including', 'bake', 'rapist', 'cookies', 'do', 'NOT', 'judge', 'others', 'who', 'decide', 'would', 'rather', 'burn', 'rapist', 'alive', 'drown', 'feces', 'forgive', 'Reality', 'seldom', 'script.This', 'movie', 'disservice', 'real', 'victims', 'violence', 'empirical', 'rationale', 'notion', 'forgiving', 'rapist', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'movie', 'potential', 'make', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'REAL', 'violence', 'feel', 'even', 'worse', 'do', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'tormentors', 'FICTIONAL', 'Julie']",Loving The Bad Man

1546045,A57JWK56OUKLZ,B0084DVWL6,Amber,"[6, 7]","Not sure about this movie. The beginning was a bit ridiculous - within the first ten minutes the main character, Julie, has led the prayer at breakfast, spoke about the help she's going to be giving to troubled youth, worn her 'Got Jesus' pin at work, and helped out a young boy stealing poptarts by making him promise to go to church with her.Sometimes subtle is best, but this film certainly didn't think that.Next you have Julie's tire blowing out, in which she then enters one of the shadiest bars you've ever seen to find help. Instead of waiting patiently in her car for reputable help to come, she asks the scary looking young man bent over his beer bottle. Not too bright.The rape scene is done discreetly, but there is no way I would consider this a family approved film, like it says on the cover. There is way too much violence in the prison scenes.So now, we have our rapist behind bars, and Julie pregnant. Somehow she has put the rape behind her with what seems little emotional reprecussions. I agree with another reviewer who said Julie's character is somewhat one dimensional and I have hard time believing that this innocent young girl, who had her virginity stolen from her in a horrible act of violence, would have recovered so quickly. She seems to take the pregnancy in stride, but while she shows remarkable maturity in this, she talks to her dad like a disrespectful teenager.It was also a little odd watching her so cheerfully visit her rapist, with big smile and all, and continue to visit him even when he didn't want to see her. I know this was the whole point of the movie, God loving the rapist through Julie, but I had a hard time with the believability.The prison scenes were well done. Stephen Baldwin slinks through them like a deadly cobra ready to strike. And I did find myself investing some emotion into the rapist's story.So while I found the message behind this movie was a powerful one, I struggled with the character of Julie.

1546048,A8DR6JIHBM6K5,B0084DVWL6,Bean Slap,"[1, 3]","I don't know why they mention Stephen Baldwin in here so much, he only plays a small part. The story revolves around a 23 year old conservative Christian woman who is assaulted by a low-life. She finds herself pregnant from assault and her family, though prolife, tell her they see no problem if she wants to have an abortion from this assault. She goes into hysterics and claims that she'd be &#34;murdering&#34; her baby and that two wrongs don't make a right. Luckily the low-life is put in prison. This is where she becomes what I'd call insane; she visits her rapist in prison and pops up spontaneously with her baby in tow and starts a happy, nay giddy gushing of her baby to her rapist talking to him like they are old friends like she met him at a party. He leaves her, thinking that she's crazy. He refuses to visit her multiple times. The next time they meet she had baked him some chocolate chip cookies (WTF?) and she talks to him like they are an old fling and he's Mr. Father of the Year. He starts to listen to her message of Christianity and does something to save both of their lives which wouldn't have been jeopardized if she hadn't started up a relationship with her rapist to begin with. What I don't like about the movie is the pushing of  judgment towards sexual assault survivors and the glorifying of those who continue their pregnancies conceived out of rape. It isn't &#34;murder&#34; to have an abortion nonetheless in the case of rape. Many survivors relive their assault while giving birth and remaining pregnant from rape can further issues of PTSD. In 28 states (last I checked, though a politician is trying to change it) the rapist retains custody of the baby even if convicted meaning she cant give the child up for adoption without his permission since in all 50 states if the father is known you have to get permission from him before giving the child up for adoption. There is no scripture in the Bible where it explicitly talks about abortion and there is certainly no place in the Bible that says you have to bake your convicted rapist chocolate chip cookies, give birth to his baby and try and create some sort of family arrangement with him as if he's Mr. Father of the Year.",1,"Rather conniving message to women who've been assaulted....or worse, impregnated from assault",1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2217,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'mention', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'story', '23', 'year', 'old', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'woman', 'who', 'assaulted', 'low-life', 'pregnant', 'assault', 'family', 'prolife', 'tell', 'see', 'problem', 'have', 'abortion', 'assault', 'hysterics', 'claims', ""'d"", 'be', '34', 'murdering', '34', 'baby', 'two', 'wrongs', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'right', 'Luckily', 'low-life', 'put', 'prison', 'where', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'insane', 'rapist', 'prison', 'up', 'spontaneously', 'baby', 'tow', 'happy', 'nay', 'giddy', 'gushing', 'baby', 'rapist', 'talking', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'met', 'party', 'thinking', 'crazy', 'visit', 'multiple', 'times', 'next', 'time', 'meet', 'had', 'baked', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'cookies', 'WTF', 'talks', 'are', 'old', 'fling', 'Mr.', 'Father', 'Year', 'listen', 'message', 'Christianity', 'something', 'save', 'lives', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'jeopardized', 'had', ""n't"", 'started', 'up', 'relationship', 'rapist', 'begin', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'pushing', 'judgment', 'towards', 'sexual', 'assault', 'survivors', 'glorifying', 'who', 'continue', 'pregnancies', 'conceived', 'rape', ""n't"", '34', 'murder', '34', 'have', 'abortion', 'nonetheless', 'case', 'rape', 'Many', 'survivors', 'relive', 'assault', 'giving', 'birth', 'remaining', 'pregnant', 'rape', 'can', 'further', 'issues', 'PTSD', '28', 'states', 'last', 'checked', 'politician', 'trying', 'change', 'rapist', 'custody', 'baby', 'even', 'convicted', 'meaning', 'cant', 'give', 'child', 'up', 'adoption', 'permission', '50', 'states', 'father', 'known', 'have', 'get', 'permission', 'giving', 'child', 'up', 'adoption', 'scripture', 'Bible', 'where', 'explicitly', 'abortion', 'certainly', 'place', 'Bible', 'have', 'bake', 'convicted', 'rapist', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'cookies', 'give', 'birth', 'baby', 'try', 'create', 'sort', 'family', 'arrangement', 'Mr.', 'Father', 'Year']",Loving The Bad Man

1546050,A1CX79P27ALJJP,B0084DVWL6,Bronx Book Guy,"[0, 2]","[SPOILERS]I am pro-choice and this to me involves the woman following her faith and judgment, including if she thinks abortion wrong even if she was raped. So, I respect the premise. The makers of the film might not see it quite the way I do, but I respect the premise. The lead actress also does a pretty good job, especially since she seems not to have much experience. Some of the others do okay. I realize this is a low budget affair and take some notice of that. Likewise, the film is a message movie, not some great work of art.Still, find myself giving it a below average review, including because I had to turn it off an hour in since it was so dull and amateurish. I think this weakens the point of the movie too. First, I don't think the film does a good enough job leading up to the first visit between the rapist and the woman. In effect, it looks like she has a quick moment of insight (she's caring for the baby, she suddenly is distraught and then looks at an inspirational sign -- this all seems to take a minute or two) and then decides to pop up at the prison. Really?The basic idea is realistic. People who were raped have had their child. People who were victims of horrible crimes have forgave and even met the person in prison. But, you don't just show up without notice with the baby! Warning to good doers -- don't try this at home. The rapist also seems to change pretty fast. First, he is this angry guy who beats up his boss and is drunk/rapes. Seems much more calm once in prison. Then, is bonding with some older black (interracial harmony!) mechanic/Morgan Freeman fill-in. Not great character development.There is also some prison drama about white and black gangs in prison ... I ff thru that though again shut things off before finding out what happened. I was interested in the subject matter but it was not handled that well. Some might appreciate it because they support her decisions and her faith. I think even then you have to judge the film as a film. It's lacking there. The charm here is that you have to remember it is partially entertainment, not just a message movie. Jesus after all used parables to get the people's attention.There is a kernel of good material here.",2,Premise is Fine / Not that great quality,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,2213,"['[', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'am', 'pro-choice', 'woman', 'following', 'faith', 'judgment', 'including', 'abortion', 'wrong', 'even', 'was', 'raped', 'So', 'respect', 'premise', 'makers', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'quite', 'way', 'do', 'respect', 'premise', 'lead', 'actress', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'experience', 'others', 'do', 'okay', 'realize', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'take', 'notice', 'Likewise', 'film', 'message', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'work', 'art.Still', 'find', 'giving', 'below', 'average', 'review', 'including', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'hour', 'was', 'so', 'dull', 'amateurish', 'think', 'point', 'movie', 'too', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'leading', 'up', 'first', 'visit', 'rapist', 'woman', 'effect', 'quick', 'moment', 'insight', 'caring', 'baby', 'suddenly', 'distraught', 'then', 'inspirational', 'sign', 'take', 'minute', 'two', 'then', 'pop', 'up', 'prison', 'Really', 'basic', 'idea', 'realistic', 'People', 'who', 'were', 'raped', 'have', 'had', 'child', 'People', 'who', 'were', 'victims', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'have', 'forgave', 'even', 'met', 'person', 'prison', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'show', 'up', 'notice', 'baby', 'Warning', 'good', 'doers', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'home', 'rapist', 'also', 'change', 'pretty', 'fast', 'First', 'angry', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'boss', 'drunk/rapes', 'Seems', 'much', 'more', 'calm', 'once', 'prison', 'Then', 'bonding', 'older', 'black', 'interracial', 'harmony', 'mechanic/Morgan', 'Freeman', 'fill-in', 'Not', 'great', 'character', 'also', 'prison', 'drama', 'white', 'black', 'gangs', 'prison', 'ff', 'thru', 'again', 'shut', 'things', 'off', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'not', 'handled', 'that', 'well', 'might', 'appreciate', 'support', 'decisions', 'faith', 'think', 'even', 'then', 'have', 'judge', 'film', 'film', 'lacking', 'there', 'charm', 'here', 'have', 'remember', 'partially', 'entertainment', 'not', 'just', 'message', 'movie', 'Jesus', 'used', 'parables', 'get', 'people', 'kernel', 'good', 'material', 'here']",Loving The Bad Man

In reading the comments of others, I do not think the filmmakers were stating that women who are raped should keep their babies and visit the father's in jail, I feel the point was being made about the power of love and forgiveness.  In the movie Julie's loving, kind, forgiving spirit spread to those around her and changed them from selfish, self-centered individuals to selfless forgiving ones.

The part of the movie where Julie takes her baby to the prison was very disturbing to me.  No woman would bounce back from such a traumatic experience and place their own child in this environment.  I think that this movie glossed over the intense hurt that is experience when a woman is abused.  Other parts of the movie I enjoyed.  I do believe that God can provide healing and forgiveness in horrible situations.  I think the movie could have portrayed this better.  I believe when you understand the intensity of the pain you can fully grasp the greatness of forgiveness.  This is a movie people should watch and make up their own minds about.
