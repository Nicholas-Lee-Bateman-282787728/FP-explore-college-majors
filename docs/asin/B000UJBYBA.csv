1095191,A3R1RMX39QI265,B000UJBYBA,"Karris ""yassa""","[7, 8]","I liked this enough to order a copy after seeing it on cable one night. A great old fashioned treasure hunt story that is part Hardy Boys, Indiana Jones, and Spin and Marty. Fairly realistic young adult characters for the time period, with avoidance of stereotypes. During three fleeing scenes they would yell ""Go!Go!Go!Go!"" which is a popular (and somewhat overused) modern expression from military and police shows. Never heard it used prior to about ten years or so ago. But this is easily forgiven and the plot is a good one. And I thought the Butch Cassidy element was refreshingly clever, as his sister and many who knew him including other family members said he survived Bolivia, and of all the outlaws who supposedly survived their own death, Butch is probably the most likely to have actually done this.",5,Surprisingly good.,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,813,"['liked', 'enough', 'order', 'copy', 'seeing', 'cable', 'one', 'night', 'great', 'old', 'fashioned', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'story', 'part', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'Fairly', 'realistic', 'young', 'adult', 'characters', 'time', 'period', 'avoidance', 'stereotypes', 'three', 'fleeing', 'scenes', 'would', 'yell', 'Go', 'Go', 'Go', 'Go', 'popular', 'somewhat', 'overused', 'modern', 'expression', 'military', 'police', 'shows', 'Never', 'heard', 'used', 'prior', 'ten', 'years', 'so', 'ago', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'plot', 'good', 'one', 'thought', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'element', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'clever', 'sister', 'many', 'who', 'knew', 'including', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'said', 'survived', 'Bolivia', 'outlaws', 'who', 'supposedly', 'survived', 'own', 'death', 'Butch', 'probably', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'actually', 'done']",N/A
