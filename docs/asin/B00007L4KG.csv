730905,A33L7G4E8CID3,B00007L4KG,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[3, 5]","I just watched this movie, and I have to say that I really, really liked it, although I can understand why others don't. This is a cult film, to be sure, and it requires a certain sensibility to see through to the end--the film's blunt force trauma approach to Gen Y college kids will leave lots of viewers cold, unable to muster any feeling for the film's characters. But others will enjoy the comedy of it all. For me, the movie clicked from the very first scene. I totally got what was going on and what the filmmakers were trying to say because of my own college experiences. I knew all these bastards, and I appreciated that they weren't really that sympathetic. This movie really is the definitive movie about the most prevalent form of college life that on sees today, so much so that there seems no point of ever making another.All of this is not to say that the film is perfect, even if you share the film's sensibility. All of the scenes featuring Sean (James Van Der Beek) interacting with the drug dealer were a real drag on the movie. The actor who played the latter evidently never learned that good acting doesn't necessarily mean MORE acting. And although Van Der Beek does a surprisingly good job as Sean Bateman (my expectations were, to put it kindly, low) there are a few uneven moments. Generally, though, the acting is pretty good, and the movie is a technical marvel.If you're not convinced so far, here are five of my favorite moments from the film. If you like them, consider watching it.1. Sean has lost a chance at being with the woman he has convinced himself he's in love with, so he decides to kill himself. First, he tries to hang himself with a phone cord. The light fixture can't hold his weight, so he falls to the ground. Then he tries to slash his wrists with a razor, but it's a face shaver and he is again unsuccessful. Finally, he tries to overdose on pills, but all he has are what appear to be cold pills, which he takes a bunch of and chases with off-brand NyQuil. It's a pretty funny take on emo-style hysterics.2. Sean (Ian Somerhalder of LOST) is late to meet Sean for dinner when one of his friends overdoses. He's completely nonplussed as they drive to the hospital, dismissing the crisis by saying things like, ""Freshmen don't OD."" He doesn't even bother to conceal his boredom when the guy seems to die (but doesn't).3. ""I only did it with her because I'm in love with you."" Sure...4. The restaurant scene. ""Well, Richard..."" ""I'm DICK!"" ""Well, Dick, what are you studying?"" Much of the rest of the dialogue is unprintable. The scene is the key to the entire movie: entitlement, resentment of authority, lack of control--it's all there. And hilarious.5. The scene where Sean's secret admirer (who we had seen several times before) commits suicide. In between all the irony and sleaze, it's a genuinely beautiful and sad moment.The Rules of Attraction is more than the sum of its parts, though. It makes an effective brief for what its subject group is like, and it does not exactly let them off the hook when it comes to moral terms. It is not, of course, for everyone, but if you're still reading this it might be worth a viewing.P. S. Van Der Beek also punches Jessica Biel in the face. So, there's that.",5,The ultimate film about college life,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,3255,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'cult', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'certain', 'sensibility', 'see', 'end', 'film', 'blunt', 'force', 'trauma', 'approach', 'Gen', 'Y', 'college', 'kids', 'will', 'leave', 'lots', 'viewers', 'cold', 'unable', 'muster', 'feeling', 'film', 'characters', 'others', 'will', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'movie', 'clicked', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'totally', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'say', 'own', 'college', 'experiences', 'knew', 'bastards', 'appreciated', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'sympathetic', 'movie', 'really', 'definitive', 'movie', 'most', 'prevalent', 'form', 'college', 'life', 'sees', 'today', 'so', 'much', 'point', 'ever', 'making', 'another.All', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'perfect', 'even', 'share', 'film', 'sensibility', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Sean', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'interacting', 'drug', 'dealer', 'were', 'real', 'drag', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'latter', 'evidently', 'never', 'learned', 'good', 'acting', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'MORE', 'acting', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'job', 'Sean', 'Bateman', 'expectations', 'were', 'put', 'kindly', 'low', 'are', 'few', 'uneven', 'moments', 'Generally', 'though', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'technical', 'marvel.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'convinced', 'so', 'far', 'here', 'are', 'five', 'favorite', 'moments', 'film', 'like', 'consider', 'watching', 'it.1', 'Sean', 'lost', 'chance', 'being', 'woman', 'convinced', 'love', 'kill', 'First', 'hang', 'phone', 'cord', 'light', 'fixture', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'weight', 'ground', 'Then', 'slash', 'wrists', 'razor', 'face', 'shaver', 'again', 'unsuccessful', 'Finally', 'overdose', 'pills', 'are', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'cold', 'pills', 'bunch', 'chases', 'off-brand', 'NyQuil', 'pretty', 'funny', 'take', 'emo-style', 'hysterics.2', 'Sean', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'LOST', 'late', 'meet', 'Sean', 'dinner', 'when', 'one', 'friends', 'overdoses', 'completely', 'nonplussed', 'drive', 'hospital', 'dismissing', 'crisis', 'saying', 'things', 'Freshmen', 'do', ""n't"", 'OD', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'conceal', 'boredom', 'when', 'guy', 'die', ""n't"", '.3', 'only', 'did', ""'m"", 'love', 'Sure', '4', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'Well', 'Richard', ""'m"", 'DICK', 'Well', 'Dick', 'what', 'are', 'studying', 'Much', 'rest', 'dialogue', 'unprintable', 'scene', 'key', 'entire', 'movie', 'entitlement', 'resentment', 'authority', 'lack', 'control', 'there', 'hilarious.5', 'scene', 'where', 'Sean', 'secret', 'admirer', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'commits', 'suicide', 'irony', 'sleaze', 'genuinely', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'moment.The', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', 'though', 'effective', 'brief', 'what', 'subject', 'group', 'not', 'exactly', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'when', 'moral', 'terms', 'not', 'course', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'still', 'reading', 'might', 'be', 'viewing.P', 'S.', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'also', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'face', 'So']",The Rules of Attraction VHS

730908,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007L4KG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I love Bret Easton Ellis.  Seriously.  I mean, I understand that he is rather tactless in his old age (the man will never be old, let's face it) and that his breed of sexual depravity needs a serious update in this modern world, but overall I consider him faultless mainly because he captivated my youth and got me started in what is the most rewarded career path I could have chosen (regardless of the fact that it is not a career yet).  So, I love him.  While `The Rules of Attraction' is not his finest work (that being the super controversial `American Psycho'), it is one of his finer efforts and certainly made for the best film adaptation of his work.`Less Than Zero' and `American Psycho', while both superior novels, were completely butchered in film form; sadly.So this brings me to the film adaptation, released in 2002.  Using a flirty and witty construction and utilizing Ellis's love for sex, drugs and rock and roll, `The Rules of Attraction' is pungent, sour and infectiously delightful.  The story is basically a love triangle of the most bizarre kind.  You have Lauren, a young `virgin' withholding herself for her man-whore boyfriend who is off on a backpacking trip where he basically sleeps with everybody (and we see this in a very speedy three or so minute clip).  Lauren has caught the eye of Sean, a slacker drug dealer who has real skeletons in the closet (thank you Bret for interweaving your novels) but who also happens to be deflecting the affections of Paul, a bisexual classmate who has the hots for him.The slippery decline of depravity follows suit in a way that is utterly priceless.The entire cast handles this really well.  The early aughts were a time when quite a few young stars were trying to make a lasting impression, and Shannyn Sossamon was one of them.  Sadly, she disappeared, but after `A Knights Tale' she became a sort of a `thing' and so she gets top billing over the breathtaking Jessica Biel (who plays the college slut) and even Kate Bosworth, both of whom carved out longer lasting careers than Sossamon.  I happen to LOVE Shannyn and wish that her career was reflective of her good looks, because she is quite a looker.  I've never been a fan of `Dawson's Creek', and Van Der Beek's face offends me, but he delivers here in a way I didn't expect.  Still, best in show accolades go to Ian Somerhalder if for that hospital parking lot scene alone.  The man is awesome in this movie and really should have garnered some awards traction.  Alas, this is not an awards movie (although it should have been).For a really good time, listen to the Carrot Top commentary.

730910,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00007L4KG,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[0, 1]","Directed & Scripted by Roger Avary from the Bret Easton Ellis novel, RULES OF ATTRACTION is 100% UNCUT in NZ! Amazing!The ""story"" revolves around a pack of self-absorbed, doped-up college kids- among them Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek in a bad guy role)cousin of American Psycho Patrick; Paul the token gay guy; Peter a country bumpkin who is attending college on financial aid... and who also needs to pay off a whacked out drug dealer who possesses a vocab as extensive as Mickey Rourke; & other characters I won't bother going into because the movie is so self-absorbed and numbing. Just like the story's protaganists.THE RULES OF ATTRACTION is basically about a group of college kids & the seemy underside of the American Dream of a privileged education & what lies below the surface. The film is narrated in a dull monotone by Van Der Beek's character; which of course manages to capture the tone of Ellis's book quite well- if you've read the book & LESS THAN ZERO, you'll know what I mean.The first 15 minutes are the most annoying; which is meant to set up the story before the opening creds- including a scene where Van Der Beek is engaging in a violent sex act. Meant to be shocking, but really when you watch it you just think ""Hey, check it out! Dawson's doing the rumba!""After that the film turns into a long, protracted two and a half hours of drugs, booze, sex, rape, suicide, vomit & numerous other bodily fluids; a vain attempt by Avary to be provocative & scandalous; but all the movie does is wallow in its own excess & amounts to nothing more than a self indulgent piece of glitzy trash. This especially applies to the overlong, monotonous montage sequence in the last half hour; where my next door neighbour makes her motion picture debut as ""the Kiwi girl""- an entire half second of screen time. (Chances are she'll jump the fence and beat me up if she reads this!!)Overall, RULES OF ATTRACTION is a movie in which its ambition far outweighs its achievements (What's with the reverse play sequence in the movie? Is it just Avary saying ""Look at me! I can do camera tricks!""?). One of the characters also makes a reference to Quentin Tarantino. Subtle. Is Avary annoyed because BOOGIE BOY & MR. STITCH were far from being great movies? Is RULES OF ATTRACTION a vain attempt to be taken seriously by Hollywood for another 15 minutes? If so he's failed in that respect.The cast also includes Kate Bosworth, Swoosie Kurtz & Faye Dunaway. Ron Jeremy has a cameo as a pianist. Why did they bother? And why should you?

Anything which happens to a character in an Ellis novel doesn't mean much to that character. So things you need in a movie like unity, character arcs... all that is either forged by the screenwriter or doesn't work in the movie.Here, Roger Avery (the bitter man destined to be remembered for his jealousy of former partner Tarantino) employs a gimmick of scenes running backwards which unfortunately does not add to the story's unity. This is because the book does not work backwords - the book is linear and moves forwards - as does the movie, after the first few scenes! So i wasn't sure what the point of it was!It does not give the whole thing a feeling of purpose, it does not tie it together. The gimmick is essentially useless. He shows us the final scene first, then we do the movie and by the time we come back to it, we've not learned hardly anything that gives us a new appreciation of it. This is a sign that you're gimmick has done absolutely nothing for you.So while i thought the actors (particularly James van der Beek as Sean Bateman and the guy playing Paul) did a sterling job at playing these dark, hollow characters - and lovers of the book will have to admire the lion's effort of an adaptation, this problem with the gimmick was damning for me.Don't come expecting a standard teen film - this film is an expose of the emptiness of college sex drugs and violence.

730912,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,B00007L4KG,bowery boy,"[7, 8]","I read The Rules of Attraction years ago when it was first released in the 80s (I still have my dog-eared hardback copy).  It has remained one of my all time favorite novels. The resonations from that novel have stayed with me, changing my perspective on what writing can be and making me an instant Bret Easton Ellis fan. I was in college at the time I first read it and it seemed to be a frighteningly accurate portrayal of the excesses of 80s college life.  So imagine my dismay when I discovered that it was adapted for film.  Less Than Zero was a disappointing flop, the original story practically unrecognizable in its film adaptation and American Psycho was a fairly well-done interpretation of Ellis's difficult novel.  So I had no hopes for The Rules of Attraction.  Finally, months after its release on DVD, I decided to give it a go.Although it isn't a truly faithful adaptation, Avary manages to capture the essence of the novel brilliantly taking some liberties with the storyline and characters (i.e. Lauren was NOT a virgin and did not go to the opening party, Sean and Paul had a fairly extended sexual relationship although Sean was too drunk or high to remember most of it).  Through the use of a cinematic bag of tricks, an alienating soundtrack by tomandandy peppered with 80s hits and a cast of beautiful 20-something actors (Shannyn Sossamon is gorgeous!) Avary creates the same atmosphere of detached disaffectedness with a sense of urgency as the novel.  My favorite cinematic devise used is running the film backwards.  I liked the opening party scene which really is the end of the movie and how each character and their perspective is introduced by running the scene backwards three times.  Also, the use of character voiceovers helps to convey a sense of hopelessness as a lot of the voiceover dialogue is lifted directly from the novel.  The movie even opens and closes in a mid sentence dialogue like the novel.  Watching this movie (and reading the novel as well) creates a sense that something is wrong, but what?  The scary thing is in 1987 this novel was spot on in its portrayal of jaded 80s youth.  I don't think, in 2004, it's too far off the mark in relation to today's youth as well.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, more so than I thought I would.

In another scene, a split screen is used to show what two different characters are doing prior to meeting one another. In one montage, a characters entire trip to Europe is told & visualized in less then 5 minutes.  What I am getting at is this, the The Rules of Attraction is a flashy film that uses flashy storytelling, a flashy soundtrack and a star studded cast in flashy roles to tell a story of teenagers and college students living a flashy lifestyle.The problem is, that all of these flashy elements stop us from getting a sense of who the film's main characters truly are. They are squarely defined by who they are sleeping with or who they want to sleep with. There's no depth, no substance amongst all the the flash.On the other hand, all this flash leads to a mighty entertaining film, one that never bores. The film always has some kind of cinematic trick up its sleeve from a harrowing suicide sequence, to sharp dialogue, to all kinds of crazy sexual encounters, to seeing good ol' boy James van der Beek of Dawson's Creek fame playing a decidedly unappealing character who makes reprehensible life choices.The Rules of Attraction is a film that is both fascinating and repellent all at the same time. Roger Avary's storytelling is innovative & cutting edge, yet the characters are shallow & narcissistic, much like the film itself. The Rules of Attraction is a one of a kind movie experience that undoubtedly will hit a real nerve with some people, but when a film gets people thinking and gets people talking, its struck a chord with audiences and challenged them in ways that they didn't quite expect.

The characters are all unlikable and demented trying to find some sort of happiness, but filling all of the gaps in between with drugs and sex. It's boring. There is no plot. And I can only think of a few reasons to see this movie. The number one reason would have to be the kissing scene with James Van Der Beek and Ian Somerhalder. Ian's character yearning for James' character is about the only true emotion that plays out well in this movie. The second reason would be Russell Sams who has an all too brief cameo. Someone find this guy some work, cause he made me laugh my tail off. The movie is so uneventful and absurd that by the time his character comes into the movie, the audience is begging for anything and he delivers. His scene at the dinner table with Swoozie Kurtz is just priceless. After this scene, the movie goes back to being dull and feeling sorry for itself. Thirdly, the cast all does a great job of portraying people you'll loath. James and Jessica Biel especially shine as an over sexed druggie who can't find happiness and a [person] who can't be too high or too skinny. Ian Somerhalder who shows potential deserves better and Russell Sams needs to be in something cool NOW. ...Oh and by the way, the camera tricks were cool for the first ten minutes, quite annoying the other 110 minutes. In closing, I have to say, I feel sorry for the people who made this. It's not deep, it's not thought provoking, .... If these souless characters reflect your lives in any way, please seek help now. I feel sorry for all the actors. Hopefully they'll all do something else one day that's much better than this. At least James and Ian got a nice kiss out of it. I also feel sorry for the audience.

Here it goes...Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek, good old Dawson), brother to AMERICAN PSYCHO's Patrick Bateman, goes to New England's Camden College. Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon, Angelina Jolie's twin from A KNIGHT'S TALE and FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS) and Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) also go to Camden and happen to be at the same party Sean is at. They are all at the End of the World party (the Camden Christmas bash) and they all are celebrating different things, which we find out through a flashback to the start of the semester.Sean has been getting love letters from a mysterious girl and he is slowly falling in love, while dealing cocaine and screwing anyone he can on the side, even though he doesn't seem satisified with his decisions. He assumes that Lauren has been slipping him the letters, but she has her eyes set on Victor (Kip Pardue of REMEMBER THE TITANS and um, DRIVEN), who happens to be in Europe screwing every foreigner in sight and taking every drug known to man.Paul is in love with Sean, but Sean doesn't seem to notice. Sean's more interested in getting more pot and geting laid.James Van Der Beek couldn't have picked a better role to make people forget about Dawson's Creek. This role is about as un-Dawson Leery as he can get and he fits like a glove. He really embodied the character. He is great in this film and deserves an Oscar nom but the fact is that no one will even think to give it to him just because he is a Creeker.The movie is extremely fun to watch!

730921,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00007L4KG,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 7]","This film is like when you have 10 food items and you try to make a big dinner out of all of it. It contains so much that it comes across as being very less about what the film thinks it actually is.It's kind complicated so let's meet the players first: ""I'm so dark and angry"" Sean Bateman(Dawson's Creek James Van Der Beek), virginal innocent etc Lauren(Shannon Sossamyn from A Knight's Tale and might add: gave the worst name to a baby, yes even worse than Gwyneth's Apple, it's Audio Science, yes you heard me), bisexual Paul(Ian Somerholder, Adam from season 3 of Smallville, tv's Lost), resident college slut Lara(WB's Jessica Biel) and drama major slightly gay Victor(Kip Pardue....from somewhere).Now let's get to the plot: Sean likes Lauren but a college lunch server likes him. Lauren likes Sean but is saving herself for her boyfriend Victor, who's in Europe backpacking(and doing every girl that's willing might I add). Paul used to date Lauren but is now after Sean due to a snafu in miscommunication. Meanwhile, Lara just wants to have everyone. And there's some minor players now and then.The opening scene is where basically a bunch of stuff happens to our players. And in a neat rewinding scene, we follow one person's situation but then rewind but following someone else. Example: due to being quite drunk, Lauren is raped and filmed until a keg bursts in the room. We rewind the scene only following the keg out of the room, down the hall and down the stairs and back where it started and then seeing the water magically going back to ice. Then we follow someone else's actions in real time.There's some other notable ones including a split screen conversation between Sean and Lauren and a musical montage which could be straight out of a Kubrick film set to George Michael's Faith. There's also one scene that's so heartbreaking it's difficult to watch if only your eyes would quit watching. A girl commits suicide by wrist slitting in a bathtub and we basically see only her facial reaction of the cut and the beginning of death setting in. Noteworthy piece of acting here.The film only has one problem, besides the ""I'm an important film!"" feel it has: it's like it doesn't care for its characters.

730922,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B00007L4KG,Dai-keag-ity,"[1, 1]","I think in the end the question posed by the original 1987 source material, The Rules of Attraction, is all about why its characters miss the point that sex, when devoid of all elements of romance, becomes such an empty thing. While this fast-moving film didn't take that question on, it did give us an expos&eacute; on how one collection of young people at an exclusive east coast college are willing to trade almost anything to gratify their desires, even if the means they are using to fill the emotional void are really the last things they need. Although they probably don't know it, they are so collectively terrified of ennui that they take any path but the obvious one to find the happiness that's lacking in their lives. It's effectively tragic and also problematic, because in depicting such empty banality, the story itself runs the risk of seeming to be ABOUT this druggy void, when it's simply not at all.Overall, Roger Avary's movie is a capable adaptation of the 1980s novel. With its split screens and buzzy `80s pop music, it kept up a nearly impossible pace that acted as a stand-in for the paragraph-length chapters Brett Easton Ellis often employed when he penned The Rules of Attraction a generation ago. As written the novel The Rules of Attraction presented some real challenges to anyone wanting to faithfully adapt it to the screen. Much of the story took place inside the thoughts of its characters, important moments existed that would have been all but impossible to successfully translate to celluloid, and great segments of the book came and went without doing much toward moving the plot forward. Also with its vast cast of characters, it could have been a film maker's nightmare to jump into any sort of faithful recreation of what Ellis had in mind. (It is, after all, a novel that opens with the callous defloration of a virgin at a raucous party---""...I always knew it'd be like this....""---and ends with the reunion of two lovers...only one of the lovers scarcely even remembers the other despite the young woman's obsessive infatuation with him.)I think these considerations explain why no one tried to tackle this book for so long. In my opinion the result of this 2003 attempt to set the novel to screen isn't bad at all. It retains the energy of the book while infusing it with a pace that keeps what works well on the written page working well onscreen. It's momentarily amusing to see James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel shed their lily-white TV character purity and take on roles as promiscuous drug addicts, but after a few scenes you forget the TV personas and instead notice that both these performers are actually adept actors who bring a convincing performance to the big screen.In among its sex and drugs, its suicide, its homosexuality, and its post-adolescent dramas tragically real and painfully imagined, The Rules of Attraction has a strong back story to tell, and while it's easy to miss it amid the lure of its surface blur, that back story is worth looking for.",4,It's The Cocaine 80s!

While I am a huge fan of Bret Easton Ellis and have read and loved all of his work, Rules of Attraction is one of my favorites (Less Than Zero is still his best work)...regardless I had to see this film, and while not in anyway a perfect adaptation of his novel it is a great film that holds to most of the same morals that Ellis addressed in his novel.  I have to say first that other than the fact that the charactors have the same names I don't particularly watch this film as if it were based off the novel...for many of the ket scenes in the novel, mostly Laurens pregnancy, are not in this film at all and thus watching it with the intent of watching a film version of the novel will leave you null and void.  The film does revolve around Sean Bateman (Van Der Beek) who is madly in love with Lauren (Sossaman) who once dated Paul (Sommerhalder), but Paul, now openly bisexual, is in love with Sean.  The novel delves more into these three as relationships are concerned, but the film delves into their personalities and there charactors apart from their significant other whomever that may be.  One of the best scenes involves Paul's friend Richard in the resturant.  It's outright hilarious.  Its in the novel too and I'm so glad it was included in the film.  This film does well to show the lack of morality in society and that out generation of teenagers is just as morally debased as any other.  The novel took place in the 80's during free love and drugs and the film takes place now, during free love and drugs.  I look at all of Ellis' work as great charactor studys, wonderfull looks at who we are in the mirror, not who we pretend to be in front of everyone else.

730924,A3GVDZUVE79TK7,B00007L4KG,David F. Green,"[0, 1]","There are two types of bad movies.  The first is movies that were doomed from Day One.  (Battlefield Earth, Glitter, Swept Away fall into this category)  The second type is much more aggrevating.  This is movies that COULD'VE have been great, but something went horribly wrong.  Sadly, ""The Rules Of Attraction"" falls into this category.Director Roger Avary tries several filming techniques that would have been good in moderation, but unfortunately he drags them out to the point of boredom.  A perfect example occurs at the very beginning.  The first scene takes place at a party and shows events through the eyes of the three main characters, sociopathic Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), repressed Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), and frustrated bisexual Paul (Ian Somerhalder).  After Sean's events and before Lauren's events, the film then ""rewinds"", as everything we just saw is reversed.  This would have been cool for about 30 seconds, but instead the film continues to rewind for a few more minutes, to the point where you want to scream ""WE GET IT!"" at the screen.Another classic example is when a character who has been out of the country for most of the movie returns, and his adventures are displayed in fast-motion while he quickly narrates without taking a breath.  Again, this would've have been interesting for about 90 seconds, but the scene continues to drag on for over 5 minutes.The movie also suffers under the misconception that being ""outrageous"" will automatically make it interesting.  Watching the characters do drugs non-stop and talk about sex isn't enough to carry a movie.  And if you're going to have a character commit suicide in a graphic manner, it may be more effective if you actually give her at least one line of dialogue during the movie.  It's hard to feel too much sympathy for a character we don't even know.There are only two reasons to watch this movie.  The first is for the scene in which Paul and his former male lover dine out with their mothers.  This scene is so hysterically funny it almost makes the movie worth watching.  The second reason is for Jame Van Der Beek, who breaks his usual typecasting and gives an incredibly effective and chilling performance as Sean Bateman.  (American Psycho fans, don't get too excited, the only mention of Sean's serial killer brother is when Sean is informed that ""Patrick"" left a message for him).  Other than these two pluses, watching ""Rules of Attraction"" simply makes us wonder how good this movie could have been had it been put together better.

730926,A2F5OMNCGD430M,B00007L4KG,"Diane ""dmt277""","[2, 2]","I really do not know what was going through Roger Avary's mind when he was adapting Bret Easton Ellis' book into a screenplay, but I personally think that turning Lauren's character into a virgin was a really stupid idea. I think this movie would have made much more sense had Avary not completely warped Lauren's character. The book starts off with an anonymous woman, describing the humiliating experience she had losing her virginity when she was a freshman at Camden. After reading the whole book I am still not completely sure whether that woman was actually Lauren or not. The other really big discrepancy between the book and the movie is that Jessica Biel's character, Lara, does not exist in the book. I don't think that Lauren even had a roommate in the book, but Sean does cheat on Lauren with her best friend Judy.I watched the movie first and I liked it enough to want to read the book. While I definitely liked the book better than the movie, I think the movie ""improved"" on the book by keeping Paul and Sean's relationship unconsummated sexually, because in the book Paul talks about having sex with Sean several times. This is really confusing because Sean's character is clearly heterosexual.In the book and in the movie, the highlight is the time that Paul spends with the Mimi and Richard 'Dick' Jared and his mother. Of course the scene where Paul and Richard are dancing on the bed never happens in the book, but it is hilarious and not to be missed.The only comment I want to make about the girl who committed suicide is that a man/jerk like Sean Bateman is not worth killing yourself over. If there is any real reason to have a scene like that in a movie/book it is to point out the utter stupidity of throwing your life away over someone who is not worthy of you in the first place.Some of the time, when a movie is based on a book that I have read, I will get upset with the movie makers because they often absolutely butcher the book and make it into a lousy movie.

The movie stays true to the tone of the book, even if it did change the time period from the early 80's to present day. All the visual and stylistic tricks the filmmakers used worked to convey the confusion, drug use, and craziness that the troubled students of Camden college are experiencing. Since the film didn't shy away from many of the dark themes of the book, my only real complaint was how much the film minimized the homosexual relationship between Sean and Paul in the film (which was much more explicit and extensive in the book).

Whereas the novel now serves as a time capsule of an era (and is still a fascinating, well written read), the film brings us to the present time, complete with post-Pulp Fiction-style editing tricks. If you are looking for the characters from the book, you'll find their namesakes here, but not necessarily the same people.  Some characters (the beautiful Shannyn Sossamon's Lauren) have been cleaned up to be more sympathetic, some (James Van Der Beeks malevolent Sean) seem more monstrous, and others  (Jessica Biel's Lara) are entirely new to the film, having not appeared in the novel. This film is a look at the lives of students at a private, wealthy liberal arts college in New England and their interpersonal relationships.  This film is pretty much the darker side of college life as seen in films like &quot;Animal House.&quot;  Instead of levity and humor, we see the darkness of college life, and the underbelly of the infamous American &quot;lesiure time.&quot;It's nice to have actresses like Fay Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz make appearances but I wish they'd been onscreen longer.  Be on the watch for a bizarre cameo by Paul Williams in a hospital scene taken directly from the book that is still as confusing onscreen as it is on the printed page.The real star turn in this film is by Ian Somerhalder as Paul Denton.  Perhaps it's because he is one of the most stunningly beautiful faces (male or female) to ever grace a movie screen, but his Paul is an interestingly complex character who wears his heart on his sleeve. Somerhalder's only stumbling block to fame may be his looks, but I do hope to see hime in more things.Look for a reference to &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; in this film as well.

Maybe its the dead-on observations, the voiceovers that are just long enough to not become intrusive and pretentious.  Maybe it is the flagrantly brilliant character introductions.  Maybe its the way the scenes take complete left-turns from their supposed pre-ordained destinations.  Maybe its how a simple act of ripping a note can become a singularly despicable and depressing thing.  Maybe its because when you're watching it, you're thinking ""I shouldn't like this"" but you do anyway.  All of these things and more are here for your viewing.  Its a wonderful film, as wonderful as a movie about sex-crazed deviant drug-addicted college students can be.  It's poignant in very very odd ways.  Where else can you watch a movie where you enter a mans thoughts as he is having sex, and he says ""I can't remember the last time I had sex sober""  That quote was magnificent, brilliance, that line alone sums up the entire character.  Stuff like this is why I go to the movies.  One can make the accusation that this movie is over-directed, you'll get no argument from me.  The visual tricks utilized are occasionally just boring.  But when the trickery hits brilliance, aka Victors introduction.  Then you just have to take the winners with the losers.

It sounds like a simple plot, but in the hands of Roger Avary its compelling.  The backwards scenes, the suicide scene, the parties and the character interaction is disturbing yet intriguing.  Of course, the book is better but that is generally the case.  Still, I liked this better than ""American Psycho"" for some reason.

I think that this is what is strongest about the movie:it is very funny at times, has great acting by almost everyone, is a movie that you can not easily forget. In some ways the movie is original although previous movies have mixed fantasy with reality in a manner in which it is unclear what is fantasy and what is reality(such as Rosemary's Baby and Mullholland Drive).

It's the story of multiple college students, and pretty about them and what they do. And of course, since it's a Hollywood movie, there has to be some insane amount of pointless, non believable things happening. Atop of this pile of unbelievable stuff, the writing is just as bad. Everytime James Van der Beek's character was going to talk, I cringe, because I know some pointless, bad thing was going to happen.And while I suppose this knocks out Brett Easton Ellis, perhaps not, as I have not read the book, but the characters are so cliche for movies.

730939,A1ZS82R4RC0I2N,B00007L4KG,gonn1000,"[0, 0]","Cult director Roger Avary (""Killing Zoe"") adapts the material from one of Brett Easton Ellis` books and provides an enticing and addictive cinematic experience in ""The Rules of Attraction"".The movie focuses on 3 college kids who are emotionally hurt and the only way to deal with the situation is spending their time around drugs, sex, parties and little else. The directing is edgy and stylish enough, pherhaps even a bit too hip for it`s own good, but excellent nonetheless. There are a lot of jump/ reverse moments in the narrative to make it interesting, as well as multiple story perspectives, split screens and an unique, cretive way of connecting sound and image (the soundtrack is just great and sets the mood properly). At times, it recalls some ""Trainspotting"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" moments (Avary co-wrote the latter, by the way).Sean (played by James Van Der Beek) is a character one love`s to hate, a selfish, crude and arrogant guy who eventually gets a hold on himself as he becomes more and more interested in Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), a smart, late virgin who is expecting for her boyfriend to return from a trip to Europe. Paul (Ian Somerhalder) is a bisexual guy who recently dated Lauren and starts caring deeply about Sean, who rejects him. So, we have a circular plot who`s simple in a way but is told in a refreshing manner, so it never becomes tiresome. Sure, there are some apparently meaningless scenes but as a whole they make sense and help to develop the characters, who are more than what they first seem (although we never get to know them properly, since ""no one knows anyone"").The movie offers an interesting look at a part of college experience, showing a darker, cynical and bitter side of teenagers and young adults that isn`t seen in the most common, dumbed down and predictable teen flicks out there. This mixes heavy dark comedy with sad moments of loneliness, despair and alienation. There`s sex, drugs and rock n`roll, but it isn`t really a case of style over substance. Sure, it has style and is visually compelling, but it`s also meaningful and though-provoking, especially in the poetic, gothic-like moments of the third act.

730940,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00007L4KG,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[2, 8]","Directed by Roger Avary ''The Rules of Attraction'' is one of the worst movies of 2002 and there have been a couple.The movie stars James Van Der Beek from ''Dawson's Creek'' as Sean Bateman, a drug dealing slanking student who basically by his own words is a ''social vampire'' someone who leeches of others, and sinks his fangs to those naive and weak enough around him. The best example is near the beginning where Sean is telling us through a couple of brief flashbacks about the pathetic situations he has been involved in. He then seeks to forgot about his problems like some individuals by consuming himself with alcohol and then finding a cheap girl to sleep with. His prayers get answered when he meets a young blonde who is obviously a little drunk as well. Anyhow fast forward 5 minutes and then we are introduced to a whole slew of pathetic characters. There is the homosexual character of Paul (Ian Somerhalder) who basically likes to sleep with any boys around him. I doubt think gays would have liked this character either. I have seen in many films vile heterosexual characters but dare I say it, Paul is the first vile homosexual character Ive seen in film (another good reason that the movie shouldn't have been made let alone a novel)Supposedly this horrible movie was taken from a novel by Bret Easton Ellis and I could only shudder to think how bad the book is if the movie of this calibur is taken from a novel. In fact looking at another site it doesn't quite know how to qualify the movie. It has the movie itself listed as a Comedy/Drama/Romance/Thriller? lolBack to the movie, we see a couple of the stupid situations Mr. Bateman is in. Apparently he has a drug pimp (some weak little 17 yr old white boy) who think he is a big shot because he carries a gun. Anyhow, this pimp wants money from Sean (apparently they have some sort of partnership going where this guy gets his own cut of the drug money). Sean can't pay the money but he comes with a way to get it by swindling a couple of rich preppies who want to get high....lolThen there comes this sick twist in the film, Paul sexually loves Sean and Sean is interested in this girl Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon) supposedly because she is pure and sweet (which is not what I heard in the novel).Anyhow, Sean Bateman well to put in a blunt is real nilist, he likes to turn everything into crap plain and simple. The movie itself takes one direction (to sicken us with one hideous character after the next and shows their selfish stupid actions)and pretty does until the very end. Speaking of which, the ending itself is written on the wall halfway, it's not surprising, it's a sad ending to a sad vile film.''The Rules of Attraction'' also has done nothing for the cast either, James Beek hasn't done a movie in 2 yrs and none of the other actors except maybe Kate Bosworth who has a short role as Kelly (friend of Lauren) has gone anywhere.The only good thing that I think comes from watching such a stupid movie as this, is that it shows that even in 2002 American directors still seek to make incredibly bad movies hoping that audiences will dig them, they won't and I didn't dig this movie at all.Another horrible movie with James Van Der Beek which started a couple of years ago with his weak movie ''Varsity Blues''.I did get the blues watching this movie (pun intended). Van Der Beek is just not a good actor at all, all he has is good looks but not much acting depth. So stay away from this movie.

James Van-der-Beek as the psycho thrill-seeking drug dealer? Oh my, what will their parents think? This was a big laugh as much as anything. Being unintentionally funny, and having a good soundtrack were the only good points to this. The sad part is knowing that some 16 year old is going to watch this and think it's cool. I mean the sex and drugs are one thing, but there were two suicide scenes because people couldn't ""hook-up"" with their crushes.

Roger Avary and Ellis seem to have collaborated to a certain extent here and the result is a very well done movie.If I had to pick a bone, its that the book itself doesn't have enough of a narrative story and that problem seems to have translated somewhat to the screen. Avary does a great job of using reverse motion (more effectively than I've ever seen before) split screen (pretty amazing, the one scene that is dissected on the DVD in Anatomy of a Scene)nonlinear timeline and some other subtle tricks but its misdirection, designed to point the viewer a bit away from the lack of narrative.Make no mistake...I thought it was a really good film.  If anything, the problem stems from the source material, where Ellis was building characters with a relatively loose narrative story.  Avary does a very good job translating it.Interestingly, in Ellis' writing, he sometimes switches to different narrative forms. That sounded like one thing in my head as I read, but to see Avary's take on it, it changed it.  Victor's Trip (if you haven't seen the movie, wait and you'll see what I mean) was almost pure Ellis and while different from the voice in my head, it was just as legitimate.

730946,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,B00007L4KG,J. Edkin,"[1, 2]","Never have I enjoyed watching a movie I didn't enjoy more.  What do I mean by that?  The filmmaking techniques in The Rules of Attraction employed by director Roger Avary, cinematographer Robert Brinkman, editor Sharon Rutter, and the slew of digital effects technicians and all the rest behind the scenes is splendid.  This is a movie that people who appreciate the art of shooting and editing a movie can be thrilled by.  The sheer visual joy of filmmaking is evident in almost every shot.  It's too bad all this technical prowess and creativity is wasted on a whole bunch of characters that are shallow and unpleasant.  It's the story and the performances that I didn't enjoy.The Rules of Attraction centers around a group of reprehensible students at a small liberal arts college whose lives revolve around getting stoned/drunk and getting laid.  Sure, that description can be applied to almost any teen &quot;coming of age&quot; comedy or drama.  But the problem is that none of the characters in this movie had any redeeming qualities.  There was no reason to root for any of them, no reason to care enough to become invested in the directions their lives would take them.  On top of that, the script is a collection of disjointed scenes.  These disjointed scenes allow for cameos by notable actors like Faye Dunaway, Swoosie Kurtz, Fred Savage, Paul Williams, Theresa Wayman, and not-so-notable Russell Sams, but none of their appearances really serve the story.  In fact, you could take their scenes out of the movie, and nothing--absolutely nothing--would be lost.  So, what was the point?  In fact, the only one on that list whose character is an important plot point, a motivating factor for much of the lead character's actions, is removed from the story at the two thirds mark, but because of the disjointed nature of the script, the removal doesn't have any transformational effect on the lead character as it could or should.As for the stars, from my understanding, Jason Van Der Beek chose this script because he wanted to break away from his Dawson's Creek image.  Well, okay.  The lead character Sean Bateman is a much different note than Dawson Leery.  The problem is, it's only one note.  Part of the blame must be laid on scriptwrite/director Roger Avary, because there isn't much in the way of development for the character (or any of the other characters) in word or direction, but Van Der Beek doesn't imbue the character with any depth of his own creation.  Much of Van Der Beek's performance is made up of tilting his head down and looking up with his eyes to communicate menace, lust, puzzlement, being drunk/stoned, annoyance, fear, and an orgasm (mind you, not all at the same time).  It's an extremely limited pallet, and it gets monotonous.  The other two leads, Shannyn Sossamon and Ian Somerhalder (who have equally difficult names to spell), fare a little better as the script gives them both a little more to do in terms of range and because they are able to inject small bits of humanity into their performances.Ultimately, I watched the movie until the end and I'm glad I did.

In this, it a far more successful adapation of Ellis' work than any film thus far. Roger Avary has created an incoherent, chaotic, frenzied work, full of unlikable, selfish characters. Anyone that's read Ellis' book knows that's exactly what it is. However, what works on page often does not work on film, and this film is a clear example of that. Even though the entire cast is great, and James Van Der Beek has never been better on the big screen, the film simply does not really click. I don't know if Avary could have made the film differently and still stayed faithful to the book, but the end result is a great book adaption and a not so great film.My advice?

730949,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00007L4KG,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 5]","Bret Easton Ellis is an awesome writer. I think his book ""American Psycho"" captures a certain essence of modern America that eludes most authors. It's difficult to say that about a book whose main character spends most of his time killing people in the most nauseating ways possible while working days as a Wall Street insider. Based on that plot summary alone, I would say you'd have to be insane to think ""American Psycho"" is a modern classic. It is, though. It's how Ellis captures the vacuousness of the elites, the absolute absence of any form of morality, which makes the book shine. Too, he captures the mindlessness of rampant consumerism perfectly. He takes it over the top, I think, but he does so only to emphasize the emptiness of his characters. Not surprisingly, his other novels look at the same ideas from different perspectives. ""Less Than Zero"" cast a scathing eye on the immoral goings on amongst wealthy 1980s youth in Los Angeles. Then there's ""Rules of Attraction,"" a book, eventually made into a major motion picture in 2002, which does the same thing for wealthy college students. I think I detect a pattern unfolding here!""The Rules of Attraction"" exposes the antics unfolding at Camden College, one of those snooty, Ivy League type schools attended by the offspring of America's rich and famous. Let's meet the cast of characters, shall we? We've got Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), a drug dealer in hot water with his supplier Rupert Guest (Clifton Collins, Jr.). Lauren Hynde (the delightful Shannyn Sossamon) is a pretty young girl saving herself for her boyfriend Victor (Kip Pardue), who in turn is currently making the party rounds in Europe. Lauren's roommate Lara (Jessica Biel) likes to mix it up with the entire male population of Camden College. Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) is a chap that likes to swing both ways. He used to date Lauren before coming out of the closet, so to speak, and now has eyes for Sean Bateman, who he thinks swings both ways as well. I think that pretty much covers the main characters. We've got a host of minor actors in the unfolding story arcs--people like Candice (Clare Kramer), Kelly (Kate Bosworth), and Marc (Fred Savage)--to keep things popping. We also see Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz as parents in a particularly amusing sequence.Whew! Just trying to keep track of the characters takes up most of your first viewing experience. You'll need to watch the film again to get the most out of it, however, because director Roger Avary employs a most unusual narrative technique to tell these characters' stories. When we first enter the movie, Sean's prowling about the infamous ""End of the World"" party held every year on campus. We hear him talking about himself and his actions in voiceover, a tactic used for other characters as well, before the weirdness begins. Scenes start rewinding at an incredible pace, zipping back through what we've already seen in order to take us to another character's sad tale of woe. We see Sean's problems with Rupert, Lauren's romantic difficulties, and lots of out of control partying. We learn that Sean receives love notes in his post office box that he thinks Lauren sent. The two meet but eventually drift apart before anything serious occurs. That's mainly the crux of the film right there: interesting things start to happen but don't due to inaction, misunderstandings, and a lack of communication. It doesn't help that the characters labor under vacuousness so total as to preclude meaningful relationships with anyone other than themselves.I got a huge kick out of this movie. Then again, I also got a huge kick out of the film versions of ""Less Than Zero"" and ""American Psycho"". Others disagree, obviously, but I think Ellis's novels translate well to the screen. ""Rules of Attraction"" works under the capable guidance of Roger Avery. I think a lot of people complain about this movie, and by extension the other film versions of Ellis's books, because they don't understand the subject matter. You can complain about the film's lack of substance (not substance abuse, though, because there's plenty of that to go around), but that's the point. Ellis writes books that expose the various forms of decadence plaguing our society, and writes them in order to show the consequences on its practitioners. If you can't grasp that concept, you won't like this film. Then again, maybe you will if you like your humor as black as pitch. Let me cite two wickedly funny sequences in the movie as proof. One, the scene in which Sean attempts to take his own life had me howling with laughter. I watched it again and again, and it never lost its ability to amuse. Two, Victor's sojourn through Europe is a sight and sound experience one should not miss. Hilarious. If you still can't groove to the flick, two words: Jessica Biel.You'll find great picture and audio quality on this DVD. Supplements include an intriguing 26 minute ""Anatomy of a Scene"" that explains how Avary and company pulled off an especially tricky piece of camera work involving Sossamon and Van Der Beek. We also receive trailers and television spots for the film, promotional material, and a commercial for the book. We also get SIX commentary tracks. One of them is a bonus commentary with comedian Carrot Top (?). The rest rely on the various actors and a few crewmembers. SIX COMMENTARY TRACKS! What were they thinking? If you listen to all of them, and I did, you'll spend days working your way through this disc's special features. I like the movie, I'm giving it five stars, and even I don't think I needed to know this much information about the film. What's surprising is that director Roger Avary isn't on a single one of these tracks! Weird. Anyway, enjoy the film.

730953,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B00007L4KG,J. Michael Click,"[3, 11]","Movie: BOMB _____ DVD Quality: **** _____ DVD Extras: *About halfway through ""The Rules of Attraction"", a minor character climbs into a warm tub surrounded by candles, opens the veins in her arms with a razor blade, and bleeds out into the bathwater. I almost envied her. Because for her, the movie was over. I, on the other hand, still had another 55 minutes of watching unlikeable and totally unappealing characters vomit on each other; play with themselves; wipe themselves while sitting on the toilet; shoot up drugs; and advertise Jack Daniels whiskey by clutching a bottle in scene after scene after repetitive, dull scene. Seriously, it isn't often that I run across a movie with no redeeming qualities - usually there's one praiseworthy performance, or a sparkling line of dialogue, or a commendable technical achievement - but ""The Rules of Attraction"" is an utter waste of film. The characters are unpleasant; the script, which is chockful of homophobic and misogynic elements, is totally repellent; the direction is showy yet uninspired; the editing is completely ineffective. Someone needed to remind the filmmakers that it's entirely possible to make a successful black comedy about youthful alienation, but to do so, it's necessary to: 1) be funny, and 2) avoid alienating the audience.While the film is a resounding dud, the DVD nonetheless can be complemented on offering a clean and sharp audio and video transfer.

730954,A3CM1985CV46CD,B00007L4KG,John Ashley Nail,"[5, 9]","Beautiful people with pockets deeper than they are recklessly indulge their appetites for drugs, alcohol and sex: these ingredients are staples in the novels of Harold Robbins, Jacqueline Susann, Jackie Collins and Judith Krantz. Their books are regarded as trash. With ""Less than Zero"" and ""The Rules of Attraction,"" author Bret Easton Ellis essentially uses the same ingredients, yet in the 1980s he somehow got hailed as a literary wunderkind. True, ""Less than Zero"" maybe has more to say about the privileged young adults of L.A. than ""Hollywood Kids,"" and Ellis' witty style and Nihilistic sensibilities gives him more literary weight than, say, Rosemary Rogers. But Nihilistic trash isn't any less trashy. And it certainly sells, which is why Hollywood is eager to turn Ellis' books into box office gold. Unfortunately, as often happens, trashy books usually become celluloid garbage.Which brings us to ""The Rules of Attraction,"" the movie. In one scene in this movie, Jessica Biel and Shannyn Sossamon's characters do so much coke that Biel's nose starts to bleed. ""Rusty pipes,"" Biel giggles as she wipes the blood away. This line also is uttered in the movie of ""Less Than Zero"" and while using it in ""Rules"" seemed intended as a joke, it also highlights how much of a ""Zero"" retread ""The Rules of Attraction"" is. Although this time around it's being sold as satire and is free, thankfully, of any ""Just Say No"" moralizing, this could just as well have been ""Less than Zero 2,"" or ""Less than Half,"" or whatever. Set on an East Coast campus where students, besides all being on a first-name basis, are more likely to be instructed to perform sexual favors for a professor than write a term paper, ""Rules of Attraction"" is both plotless and soulless. There are attempts to make characters played by Sossamon, as the ""sensitive virgin,"" and Ian Somerhalder, as a homosexual smitten with James Van Der Beek (who in turn wants Sossamon), as possibly capable of feelings that go beyond the dull tingling of their crotches or the burning in their noses, and a peripheral character commits suicide for good measure, but I've felt a deeper connection to Old Navy spokesmodels.The performances in ""Rules"" are competent, though I think I enjoyed Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz's small parts as pill-popping moms more than any of the leads. Van Der Beek does an admirable job of distancing himself from his ""Dawson Creek"" role, but that might not necessarily be a good thing. I know director Roger Avery has been slammed by some for pushing style over substance, but style is really all this movie has. I don't know if ""Rules"" would be watchable without all of Avary's flourishes like split screens, reverse action and MTV-style quick cuts. He's turned Ellis' trashy book into... well, a trashy movie, but what glittery trash it is. If nothing else, the cast is pretty and the soundtrack's decent.As if ""The Rules of Attraction"" didn't have enough problems, the DVD's commentary track includes some homophobic and immature remarks by Somerhalder. If he truly thought kissing a man is ""the most disgusting thing on the planet,"" why did he take the role of a homosexual? Considering Lion's Gate also courted the gay dollar in the film's release, it was stupid of the studio to include comments that alienate the very demographic they're trying to attract. They wouldn't include racist remarks on a movie targeting African-American audiences, would they? As for Somerhalder, he should get in touch with Donna Summer and find out just how damaging homophobic comments can be to a career.",2,"Better than `Zero,' but Still Less Than",1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,3580,"['Beautiful', 'people', 'pockets', 'deeper', 'are', 'recklessly', 'indulge', 'appetites', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'sex', 'ingredients', 'are', 'staples', 'novels', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'Jacqueline', 'Susann', 'Jackie', 'Collins', 'Judith', 'Krantz', 'books', 'are', 'regarded', 'trash', 'Less', 'Zero', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'author', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'essentially', 'same', 'ingredients', 'yet', '1980s', 'somehow', 'got', 'hailed', 'literary', 'wunderkind', 'True', 'Less', 'Zero', 'maybe', 'more', 'say', 'privileged', 'young', 'adults', 'L.A.', 'Hollywood', 'Kids', 'Ellis', 'witty', 'style', 'Nihilistic', 'sensibilities', 'more', 'literary', 'weight', 'say', 'Rosemary', 'Rogers', 'Nihilistic', 'trash', ""n't"", 'less', 'trashy', 'certainly', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'eager', 'turn', 'Ellis', 'books', 'box', 'office', 'gold', 'Unfortunately', 'often', 'trashy', 'books', 'usually', 'become', 'celluloid', 'garbage.Which', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'characters', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'coke', 'Biel', 'nose', 'starts', 'bleed', 'Rusty', 'pipes', 'Biel', 'giggles', 'blood', 'away', 'line', 'also', 'uttered', 'movie', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'using', 'Rules', 'seemed', 'intended', 'joke', 'also', 'how', 'much', 'Zero', 'retread', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'time', 'being', 'sold', 'satire', 'free', 'thankfully', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'moralizing', 'could', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Less', 'Zero', '2', 'Less', 'Half', 'Set', 'East', 'Coast', 'campus', 'where', 'students', 'being', 'first-name', 'basis', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'instructed', 'perform', 'sexual', 'favors', 'professor', 'write', 'term', 'paper', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'plotless', 'soulless', 'are', 'attempts', 'make', 'characters', 'played', 'Sossamon', 'sensitive', 'virgin', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'homosexual', 'smitten', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'who', 'turn', 'Sossamon', 'possibly', 'capable', 'feelings', 'go', 'dull', 'tingling', 'crotches', 'burning', 'noses', 'peripheral', 'character', 'commits', 'suicide', 'good', 'measure', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'deeper', 'connection', 'Old', 'Navy', 'spokesmodels.The', 'performances', 'Rules', 'are', 'competent', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'small', 'parts', 'pill-popping', 'moms', 'more', 'leads', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'admirable', 'job', 'distancing', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'role', 'might', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'know', 'director', 'Roger', 'Avery', 'been', 'slammed', 'pushing', 'style', 'substance', 'style', 'really', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rules', 'would', 'be', 'watchable', 'Avary', 'flourishes', 'split', 'screens', 'reverse', 'action', 'MTV-style', 'quick', 'cuts', 'turned', 'Ellis', 'trashy', 'book', 'well', 'trashy', 'movie', 'what', 'glittery', 'trash', 'nothing', 'else', 'cast', 'pretty', 'soundtrack', 'decent.As', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'problems', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'homophobic', 'immature', 'remarks', 'Somerhalder', 'truly', 'thought', 'kissing', 'man', 'most', 'disgusting', 'thing', 'planet', 'why', 'did', 'take', 'role', 'homosexual', 'Considering', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'also', 'courted', 'gay', 'dollar', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'stupid', 'studio', 'include', 'comments', 'alienate', 'very', 'demographic', ""'re"", 'trying', 'attract', 'would', ""n't"", 'include', 'racist', 'remarks', 'movie', 'targeting', 'African-American', 'audiences', 'would', 'Somerhalder', 'should', 'get', 'touch', 'Donna', 'Summer', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'damaging', 'homophobic', 'comments', 'can', 'be', 'career']",The Rules of Attraction VHS

In order for any art form to be ""good"" (however you want to subjectively define that), it needs to *make sense*. Whether it's a painting, the lyrics of a song, a book, or a movie: the parts which comprise the whole need to work together to create one uncompromising union.This movie doesn't make sense.It is a string of gratuitous events, from the very beginning to the absolute end, and anytime the word ""gratuitous"" is used in conjunction with a form of art, that's a bad thing. Our main characters consist of Lauren, who thinks she has a boyfriend who is in Europe for a time, and while he is away she falls in love with another main character. That character's name is Sean Bateman, and why anyone would fall in love with him is beyond comprehension. He is base, immoral, and revolting. The other main character, Paul, was Lauren's ex-boyfriend until he came out of the closet. He too, bewilderingly, falls in love with Sean.But this isn't a story about a love triangle - in fact, it's not really a story about anything. There's nothing to latch onto and say, ""This is the foundation of this film.""The images we are shown aren't meant to enlighten us - they never enlighten us. They merely disgust or please us, and that comes full circle back to the film being a string of gratuitous events.Nothing, absolutely nothing, makes any sense.The one bright spot in the film, and the reason for its two star rating, is Ian Somerhalder's performance (Paul).

Bernabo,"[3, 6]","The fact that ""The Rules of Attraction"" is based on a Brett Easton Ellis's novel was brought home to me forcefully in the opening segment of this 2002 film when the first character we meet loses her virginity.  It is a rather disquieting scene, not only in terms of the circumstances but more so given her reaction.  I found myself feeling sorry for the character, but not sympathetic towards her, and if there is a major complaint to be made with regards to how it is difficult to access this film it would be because finding a character to root for is rather difficult (at least, for some of us).The central character, a designation dictated because he provides links to the other main characters, is Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), who is a drug dealer at Camden College in Vermont.  Sean likes Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon), who has been saving herself for her boyfriend, Victor Johnson (Kip Pardue), who is out backpacking across Europe.  Her roommate, Lara (Jessica Biel), likes Victor, Sean, and pretty much everybody including the football team.  Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) is bisexual and while he used to date Lauren he is now interested in Mitchell Allen (Thomas Ian Nicholas), who is dating Candice (Clare Kramer) to prove he is not bisexual, which results in Paul having a crush on Sean.  Lauren might be interested in Sean as well.  Who is leaving the notes in Sean's mailbox?  More importantly, how is Sean going to pay all that money he owes for drugs to Rupert Guest (Clifton Collins, Jr.)?""The Rules of Attraction"" begins at the end and then literally backs up to shift the focus to a different character and follow them for a while.  Again, knowing that Roger Avary, who co-wrote ""Pulp Fiction"" and was writer-director of ""Killing Zoe,"" adapted the novel and directed this film helps to explain this approach.  The credits take place while the images are go in an accelerated reverse to take us back several months to ""begin"" the tale anew.  By the time we get to the final credits if you do not anticipate how those are going to go then you have just not bought into this film at all.The novel is based on Ellis's experiences in college, and if what happens in this film seems excessive, allow me to point out that today the Collegiate Network announced its seventh annual Campus Outrage Awards today and tied for first place were Sex Week at Yale and a porn ""scholarship"" at UC Santa Barbara.  The former, funded by the university and co-sponsored by Wicked Pictures, included on professor lecturing on the ""History of the Vibrator"" and a ""Porn Party"" featuring a porn star.  Given that, the string of parties that pop up throughout this film to give these characters someplace to go, and the titles of which appear on the bottom of the screen, seem pretty normal.The best part of this film is the energy that Avary brings to it with his camera.  There is a split-screen sequence that serves as an ""Anatomy of a Scene"" featurette and another sequence that I thought was an eerily elegant suicide sequence.  That is why you keep paying attention despite the fact you have no real affection for any of the characters and are largely disinterested in their plights.  Avary seems as unsympathetic towards them as we are, but his camera refuses to let us look away.  For me the virtues of ""The Rules of Attraction"" are style over substance, but I do not think that is simply because I am decades beyond that side of the college experience.  I did not cotton to Houlden Caulfield either and I have to think he would have been at home with this bunch.",4,A rather interesting look at some unsympathetic characters,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,3573,"['fact', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'based', 'Brett', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'was', 'brought', 'home', 'forcefully', 'opening', 'segment', '2002', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'character', 'meet', 'virginity', 'rather', 'disquieting', 'scene', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'circumstances', 'more', 'so', 'given', 'reaction', 'found', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'character', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'major', 'complaint', 'be', 'made', 'regards', 'how', 'difficult', 'access', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'finding', 'character', 'root', 'rather', 'difficult', 'least', 'central', 'character', 'designation', 'dictated', 'links', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'Sean', 'Bateman', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'who', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Camden', 'College', 'Vermont', 'Sean', 'Lauren', 'Hynde', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'been', 'saving', 'boyfriend', 'Victor', 'Johnson', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'who', 'out', 'backpacking', 'Europe', 'roommate', 'Lara', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Victor', 'Sean', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'including', 'football', 'team', 'Paul', 'Denton', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'bisexual', 'used', 'date', 'Lauren', 'now', 'interested', 'Mitchell', 'Allen', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'dating', 'Candice', 'Clare', 'Kramer', 'prove', 'not', 'bisexual', 'results', 'Paul', 'having', 'crush', 'Sean', 'Lauren', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'Sean', 'as', 'well', 'Who', 'leaving', 'notes', 'Sean', 'mailbox', 'More', 'importantly', 'how', 'Sean', 'going', 'pay', 'money', 'drugs', 'Rupert', 'Guest', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'end', 'then', 'literally', 'up', 'shift', 'focus', 'different', 'character', 'follow', 'while', 'Again', 'knowing', 'Roger', 'Avary', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'was', 'writer-director', 'Killing', 'Zoe', 'adapted', 'novel', 'directed', 'film', 'explain', 'approach', 'credits', 'take', 'place', 'images', 'are', 'go', 'accelerated', 'reverse', 'take', 'back', 'several', 'months', 'begin', 'tale', 'anew', 'time', 'get', 'final', 'credits', 'do', 'not', 'anticipate', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'then', 'have', 'just', 'not', 'bought', 'film', 'all.The', 'novel', 'based', 'Ellis', 'experiences', 'college', 'what', 'film', 'excessive', 'allow', 'point', 'out', 'today', 'Collegiate', 'Network', 'announced', 'seventh', 'annual', 'Campus', 'Outrage', 'Awards', 'today', 'tied', 'first', 'place', 'were', 'Sex', 'Week', 'Yale', 'porn', 'scholarship', 'UC', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'former', 'funded', 'university', 'co-sponsored', 'Wicked', 'Pictures', 'included', 'professor', 'lecturing', 'History', 'Vibrator', 'Porn', 'Party', 'featuring', 'porn', 'star', 'Given', 'string', 'parties', 'pop', 'up', 'film', 'give', 'characters', 'someplace', 'go', 'titles', 'appear', 'bottom', 'screen', 'seem', 'pretty', 'normal.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'energy', 'Avary', 'camera', 'split-screen', 'sequence', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'featurette', 'sequence', 'thought', 'was', 'eerily', 'elegant', 'suicide', 'sequence', 'why', 'keep', 'paying', 'attention', 'fact', 'have', 'real', 'affection', 'characters', 'are', 'largely', 'disinterested', 'plights', 'Avary', 'unsympathetic', 'towards', 'are', 'camera', 'let', 'look', 'away', 'virtues', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'are', 'style', 'substance', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'simply', 'am', 'decades', 'side', 'college', 'experience', 'did', 'not', 'cotton', 'Houlden', 'Caulfield', 'have', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'home', 'bunch']",The Rules of Attraction VHS

Just about no one does it better than Bret Easton Ellis when it comes to capturing the vapid, empty existence of his generation - therefore the adaptation of his novel should be just as scathing, right? In this case, absolutely not. Director Roger Avary has an arsenal of cinematic tricks, violence, and sexual deviance that he lets loose in ""Attraction,"" but all of it doesn't really add up to much. Sure, it catalogues some of the things that go hand in hand with the college generation that the movie shows: wild parties, nearly-anonymous sex, masturbation, homosexuality, drugs, booze, and MORE sex, but the film's pointless plot never really seems to bring meaning to it all. This is not helped by a scowling, one-note performance by James Van Der Beek (trying his hardest to shed his soulful-teen-heartthrob image) and other below-par offerings from Shannyn Sossamon and Kip Purdue. Sure, Avary lets his characters run loose in his vision of modern emotional emptiness, but things go cinematically out of control, and the movie iself dives downward, right with its characters.

Based on the Brett Easton Ellis (author of American Psycho) novel, the basic set-up is a group of college kids including James Van Der Beek as Sean Bateman, who is in love with the virginal Lara, who is also in love with him but wants to save herself for Victor.  Oh, and Paul is in love with Sean too.  This could well be the story for any good-natured quirky teen flick.  However, the abandonment with which these kids snort cocaine, drink and have sex sets it apart as more akin to movies such as Go than She's All That.The acting is all good, especially James Van Der Beek, completely ruining any illusions that Dawson will remain Dawson forever.  As the carefree, cruel and narcisstic drug dealer Sean he is perfectly cast against type.  There are also some much appreciated, though slightly pointless, cameos from Eric Stoltz as a corrupt tutor and Faye Dunaway as Paul's mother.  Director Avery worked on the script to Pulp Fiction, and it shows.  There are flashy narrative effects aplenty - time runs backwards, speeds up and there's split-screen.  Unfortunately this is nowhere as original as the Tarantino original and doesn't come close to the superior Go, the other teen movie to try and replicate the formula (which incidentally also starred Dawson co-star Katie Holmes).  This being the case the drugs, sex, porn, masturbation and loud music come across as aiming to shock rather than the satire that you can't help but feel that the book contained.  Brett Easton Ellis's satire was much better adapted to screen in American Psycho and The Rules Of Attraction just comes across as its junior brother that doesn't really know what it's doing but is more than happy to ape Tarantino's visual style and the shock imagery of American Psycho.  It's just a shame that through such consistent repetition it just becomes dull.This being the case it comes across not as a genuine effort to transplant the novel to the screen but as a vanity project for James Van Der Beek to show that he's not such a goody goody.  That said, the movie is still enjoyable, even if most of the laughter is raised when we see Dawson doing something Dawson wouldn't do in the Creek, something that you see as being the movie's biggest asset or its biggest flaw.  The end message, that no-one ever knows anybody really is impressive, although the characters don't seem to go through any emotional changes to realise this.  In particular the ending will leave with that 'so what' feeling inside.  Even so, the novelty value of this vacuous movie is higher than most, and it's never less than engaging.  It's just that the story obviously has so much potential that you can't help but wish that something better had been done with it.",3,Where's the satire?,1050796800,"04 20, 2003",2003,2806,"['Rules', 'Attraction', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'audience', 'Based', 'Brett', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'author', 'American', 'Psycho', 'novel', 'basic', 'set-up', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'including', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'Sean', 'Bateman', 'who', 'love', 'virginal', 'Lara', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'save', 'Victor', 'Oh', 'Paul', 'love', 'Sean', 'too', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'story', 'good-natured', 'quirky', 'teen', 'flick', 'However', 'abandonment', 'kids', 'snort', 'cocaine', 'drink', 'have', 'sex', 'sets', 'apart', 'more', 'akin', 'movies', 'such', 'Go', 'That.The', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'completely', 'ruining', 'illusions', 'Dawson', 'will', 'remain', 'Dawson', 'forever', 'carefree', 'cruel', 'narcisstic', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Sean', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'type', 'are', 'also', 'much', 'appreciated', 'slightly', 'pointless', 'cameos', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'corrupt', 'tutor', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Paul', 'mother', 'Director', 'Avery', 'worked', 'script', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'are', 'flashy', 'narrative', 'effects', 'time', 'backwards', 'up', 'split-screen', 'Unfortunately', 'nowhere', 'as', 'original', 'Tarantino', 'original', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'superior', 'Go', 'other', 'teen', 'movie', 'try', 'replicate', 'formula', 'incidentally', 'also', 'starred', 'Dawson', 'co-star', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'being', 'case', 'drugs', 'sex', 'porn', 'masturbation', 'loud', 'music', 'come', 'aiming', 'shock', 'rather', 'satire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'book', 'contained', 'Brett', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'satire', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'adapted', 'screen', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'just', 'across', 'junior', 'brother', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'more', 'happy', 'ape', 'Tarantino', 'visual', 'style', 'shock', 'imagery', 'American', 'Psycho', 'just', 'shame', 'such', 'consistent', 'repetition', 'just', 'dull.This', 'being', 'case', 'across', 'not', 'genuine', 'effort', 'transplant', 'novel', 'screen', 'vanity', 'project', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'show', 'not', 'such', 'goody', 'goody', 'said', 'movie', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'most', 'laughter', 'raised', 'when', 'see', 'Dawson', 'doing', 'something', 'Dawson', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'Creek', 'something', 'see', 'being', 'movie', 'biggest', 'asset', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'end', 'message', 'no-one', 'ever', 'anybody', 'really', 'impressive', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'emotional', 'changes', 'realise', 'particular', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'what', 'feeling', 'Even', 'so', 'novelty', 'value', 'vacuous', 'movie', 'higher', 'most', 'never', 'less', 'engaging', 'just', 'story', 'obviously', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'something', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'done']",The Rules of Attraction VHS

The acting is tolerable, but there is something very forlorn and misbegotten about the entire affair. Why, for example, must we witness the suicide scene? What's the point in showing a college student who draws a bath, gets in the tub, lights some candles and slits her wrists? (We later see the dead body in the blood-filled bathtub). This is a sad, sad scene, very painful and agonizing to watch, and contributes nothing to the story, except the moribund nature of the film.The suicide is just one example of scene after pointless, depressing scene. It feels like the filmmakers were going after shock value. (""Let's take a character we know nothing about and watch her kill herself."") Also disgusting is the lack of humanity all the characters show. They are all nihilist, masochist people, who seem to find no joy in living. Even hedonism is more fun than this. It's not just the character's disturbing attitudes; I can take a film that has self-hate. Witness the excruciatingly painful montage where a guy goes off to Europe and has joyless, senseless sex with every woman he meets. These characters seem to transcend any logical reason for existing.I question the very reason why this film was made. I understand it was based upon a book by Bret Easton Ellis, who also wrote ""American Psycho,"" and maybe the book is this pointless and miserable. The photography and editing are compelling and done with skill, but they ultimately add up to nothing. The characters are uninteresting. The situations are unremarkable. Not even the backwards story (told from the end to the beginning) does anything for the film, and it feels like the director only did it to be hip.

I think that as a college student, that ""The Rules of Attraction"" hits our feelings and acts right on the nose.

These love letters tear his emotions apart, making him confused and start to change the way he has been living his life.Lauren wants to stay a virgin, but cant wait for her love Victor forever, who is away on a trip to Europe.  She lives her life one moment at a time, snorting cocain with her roomate and looking through her book of vaginal STD's, to keep her from sleeping around.Paul is as gay as you can get, and just wants to be loved.

Of course it's not the first film to portray self-obsessed college kids desperately trying to make some sort of emotional connection.  The first scene of the film makes it clear that their efforts fail, which allows the story to unfold as a long, intertwined flashback.Anyone who has read the novel (or any of Brett Easton Ellis's work) will already know that his characters are generally emotionally detached, and the characters in ""Rules of Attraction"" are no exception.  Their detachment goes beyond being jaded, and ultimately is almost a form of self-imposed emotional safety.  It's debatable whether such detachment reflects reality, but this film doesn't pretend to be some sort of hyper-realistic depiction of college life.  I considered both the book and the film to be highly stylized expressions of a certain type of person in a certain type of environment.  I did not think that it contained too much sex or drugs, especially compared to certain other films that have been critical successes.It's not surprising that some viewers find this sort of film to be offensive or frustrating or just plain boring.

And that just frustrates me, because it has so much potential, so many good ideas, but just doesn't fully realize them.The story, a satirical look at the lives of college students as many really are, uses actors normally portraying the more idealistic or silly versions of students in unrealistic films. The concept is great, just not flushed out enough.My likes and dislikes begin right away as the three primary characters are introduced at a big party, showing a character in a scene, then the film going in reverse to see another at the exact same moment. It's a great visual way to show the simultaneous nature of their situations, but it's overused. After you get the idea, the film is still going backwards, and it becomes boring. Fortunately, many other gimmicky devices are handled better, and do have a point.But my biggest problem is that the story is centered on three characters and their relationships together, yet they're rarely together in the film. They are always off with other people doing other things. While it gives them great character development and offers some great scenes, the three primary characters never really seem connected until the very end. This affects the impact the film should have delivered.What's good about it though are the performances the actors give. James Van Der Beek is great in his sinister, almost frightening role of Sean Bateman. Shannyn Sossamon is equally as impressive as a pretty, nice, grunge-wearing student. Perhaps, though, Ian Somerhalder as a gay student in love with Bateman gives the most touching performance. You feel more sorry for him in his impossible wishes then anyone else.Also, there are some great visual devices used to display symbolism. Several times in the film, a shot with intense meaning will make you want to  love the film. And that's why I find it so upsetting that it didn't live up to its potential. There is just so much to love here. If the film had built a better cohesiveness among its primary characters, it would be great. As is, however, it's only mediocre.

Lauren used to date Paul (Ian Somerholder) a bisexual who'd like to sleep with Sean himself.Could Paul be the one sending Sean love letters? Could Lauren? Sean is an unmitigated jerk with only a dark humor to his credit; he is attractive to weak people who mistake his malevolence for self-esteem, which they crave for themselves. Van Der Beek proves he's capable amateur sadism as his Sean rebukes the offers of everyone around him, building a wall to his own thoughts so impenetrable even he can't pierce it. ""You'll never know me,"" he yells at Paul and the audience. Do we really want to?Avary fares better with Lauren's story. Sossamon is quirky-looking, and not classically trained - she was discovered as a deejay - but naturally vulnerable. Her Lauren is smart but precocious, hiding behind lines of coke and her sheltered version of ""promiscuity"" - she performs oral sex on a professor (Eric Stoltz) almost as a duty - until she finally decides that officially losing her virginity is a way of asserting herself. She alone sees through to Sean, seems capable of cracking the shell, until Sean pulls one too freaky a stunt for her to stand. Unlike Paul, who is a Sean-groupie to the end.The movie swings for the fences and tries to render these relationships through the lens of satire. Mugging director David Lynch, Avary inserts bizarre, unrelated scenes that he lacks the humor and visual restraint to properly orchestrate. What to make of Russell Sams' cameo, which consists of dancing with Somerholder to George Michael on a bed, then throwing a restaurant tantrum? Or of a sequence where an admirer of Paul's tries to commit suicide and is declared dead at the hospital while he's still breathing? Or of the entire subplot concerning Sean's drug deals that features Clifton Collins Jr. playing another half-lunatic?'Avary meticulously stages musical numbers for Paul and a long sequence that splits the screen and follows Sean and Lauren from their beds to class until they stare right at each other into their respective cameras. Nice steal of Bergman's ""Persona,"" but what is it for, if the actors don't do anything with it? The source material isn't exactly Ellis' best work, and hardly a bouquet of humor, like ""American Psycho"" or deadly ennui, like ""Less Than Zero,"" both of which were made into entertaining pictures. The kids in ""Rules"" seem to be suffering from a fierce case of acting out, and deserve what's coming to them.The same goes for Avary, an innovative talent who nonetheless has few storytelling skills behind that bag of visual tricks.The director's ambition doesn't know many bounds - ""Rules"" is the first in a trilogy, if you can imagine - nor does his ego, as his movie plays like a gauntlet-throw at old partner Quentin Tarantino, with whom he shared the Oscar for co-writing ""Pulp Fiction,"" and who, as Avary claims, stole work credit and material all the time.Avary may, in fact, have mastered a few extra skills, and stolen from films of a better pedigree - Tarantino rips off Saturday morning kung fu trash these days - but his treatment of the characters is hateful - you don't put Biel and Kate Bosworth if acting chops are of any import. ""The Rules of Attraction"" has a fan base that insists its detractors ""just don't get it"" when, in fact, the movie's major flaw is that there's isn't much to get: Avary is the lone star. He gives it all away, and then some. It's not only indecent; it's like watching Dennis Hopper redux.",2,"All sexed up, with not a backward thought in its head.",1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,4172,"['Rules', 'Attraction', 'already', 'address', 'cinematic', 'dictionary', 'cult', 'film', 'Writer/director', 'Roger', 'Avary', 'visually', 'exuberant', 'chronicle', 'college', 'life', 'relentlessly', 'nihilistic', 'sexed-up', 'drug-addled', 'embraced', 'catalogue', 'truth', 'Based', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'book', 'was', 'never', 'self-conscious', 'Avary', 'dispense', 'occasional', 'wisdom', 'pearls', 'few', 'directorial', 'tricks', 'worth', 'envying', 'vapid', 'titillation', 'film', 'school', 'coke-dealing', 'Sean', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'sleep', 'virgin', 'Lauren', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'had', 'saved', 'Victor', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'went', 'Europe', 'semester', 'Lauren', 'used', 'date', 'Paul', 'Ian', 'Somerholder', 'bisexual', 'who', 'sleep', 'Sean', 'himself.Could', 'Paul', 'be', 'one', 'sending', 'Sean', 'love', 'letters', 'Could', 'Lauren', 'Sean', 'unmitigated', 'jerk', 'only', 'dark', 'humor', 'credit', 'attractive', 'weak', 'people', 'who', 'mistake', 'malevolence', 'self-esteem', 'crave', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'capable', 'amateur', 'sadism', 'Sean', 'offers', 'everyone', 'building', 'wall', 'own', 'thoughts', 'impenetrable', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pierce', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'Paul', 'audience', 'Do', 'really', 'want', 'Avary', 'better', 'Lauren', 'story', 'Sossamon', 'quirky-looking', 'not', 'classically', 'trained', 'was', 'discovered', 'deejay', 'naturally', 'vulnerable', 'Lauren', 'smart', 'precocious', 'hiding', 'lines', 'coke', 'sheltered', 'version', 'promiscuity', 'oral', 'sex', 'professor', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'almost', 'duty', 'finally', 'officially', 'losing', 'virginity', 'way', 'asserting', 'alone', 'Sean', 'capable', 'cracking', 'shell', 'Sean', 'one', 'too', 'stunt', 'stand', 'Paul', 'who', 'Sean-groupie', 'end.The', 'movie', 'swings', 'fences', 'tries', 'render', 'relationships', 'lens', 'satire', 'Mugging', 'director', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Avary', 'bizarre', 'unrelated', 'scenes', 'humor', 'visual', 'restraint', 'properly', 'orchestrate', 'What', 'make', 'Russell', 'Sams', 'cameo', 'dancing', 'Somerholder', 'George', 'Michael', 'bed', 'then', 'throwing', 'restaurant', 'tantrum', 'Or', 'sequence', 'where', 'admirer', 'Paul', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'declared', 'dead', 'hospital', 'still', 'breathing', 'entire', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'Sean', 'drug', 'deals', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jr.', 'playing', 'half-lunatic', ""'Avary"", 'meticulously', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Paul', 'long', 'sequence', 'screen', 'Sean', 'Lauren', 'beds', 'class', 'stare', 'right', 'other', 'respective', 'cameras', 'Nice', 'steal', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'what', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'source', 'material', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Ellis', 'best', 'work', 'hardly', 'bouquet', 'humor', 'American', 'Psycho', 'deadly', 'ennui', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'were', 'made', 'entertaining', 'pictures', 'kids', 'Rules', 'seem', 'be', 'suffering', 'fierce', 'case', 'acting', 'out', 'deserve', 'what', 'coming', 'them.The', 'same', 'Avary', 'innovative', 'talent', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'few', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'bag', 'visual', 'tricks.The', 'director', 'ambition', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'bounds', 'Rules', 'first', 'trilogy', 'can', 'imagine', 'ego', 'movie', 'plays', 'gauntlet-throw', 'old', 'partner', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'whom', 'shared', 'Oscar', 'co-writing', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'who', 'Avary', 'claims', 'stole', 'work', 'credit', 'material', 'time.Avary', 'may', 'fact', 'have', 'mastered', 'few', 'extra', 'skills', 'stolen', 'films', 'better', 'pedigree', 'Tarantino', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'kung', 'fu', 'days', 'treatment', 'characters', 'hateful', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'Biel', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'acting', 'chops', 'are', 'import', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'fan', 'base', 'detractors', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'fact', 'movie', 'major', 'flaw', ""n't"", 'much', 'get', 'Avary', 'lone', 'star', 'away', 'then', 'not', 'only', 'indecent', 'watching', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'redux']",The Rules of Attraction VHS

Here, we follow three young people who live their College years through drugs, parties and sex. They are all without an identity, all without a life so to speak. The only thing they love is feeling sorry for themselves and making everything seem worst than it is.You can't care for these characters in a way that other movies will make you care. And yet, you can't help but feel sorry for this lot of blinded kids.

I have always been a fan of his with my favorites being of course, ""American Psycho"" and ""Glamorama."" The main reason for my fascination for the book was the fact that Patrick Bateman's little brother Sean is really the main character in this one.  You can definetely see another American Psycho growing in Sean, making you wonder if Patrick had a similar college life. And while ROA was a good read, not his best but very enjoyable, the movie was gimmicky by contrast.Yes, I do agree with the other reviewers here that ""if you are able to identify with the characters, you will love this movie."" Yes, I had some rough times myself and looking back, pretty much partied myself out.  I CAN identify with the characters, and that is good for some laughs throughout and a couple of ""Oh S***s"" to squeak out of my mouth.  That's really about it.As a movie, it wasn't really faithful to the the book, which to me, is always dissapointing.  Sadly, reading the book first has made me not quite like this movie.So why the three stars?  Well, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't read the book.  It is entertaining as well as disturbing especially if you have lived this film in some form or another.  You can get a bit of nostalgia watching this flick.  So for me, it's two stars.

730993,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00007L4KG,Steven Reynolds,"[82, 126]","Based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name, Roger Avary's first film in five years is a rather tedious tour through the social malaise of some rich, young and miserably hip kids at a swanky New England liberal arts college where the good-looking come to breed. The story, what little there is of it, involves an abortive love triangle between Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), brother of the infamous Patrick from ""American Psycho"", Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon) and her bisexual ex, Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder). Paul loves Sean, Sean loves Lauren, and Lauren doesn't want either of them. She's saving herself for Victor (Kip Pardue): oversexed, ""only a little gay"", and currently summering in Europe. If I could convince myself that in its catatonic banality ""The Rules of Attraction"" meant to iterate both the boredom and degenerate emptiness of the lives it recounts, then I'd be able to say it succeeds. As I can't, I'm stuck with saying it's bad. Not even well-intentioned-but-ultimately-unsuccessful bad, just plain bad. And irritating. There's a thin line between confrontational and banal, and Avary spends way too much time on the wrong side of it. He seems to think that showing otherwise self-consciously cool characters throwing up, picking their noses, wiping their asses, and masturbating to internet porn somehow makes them gritty and real. Here's a better idea: how about writing a decent scene? His direction is either self-consciously gimmicky (split screen and reverse running used to little effect) or relentlessly dull. Not even his take on the guns-and-knives drama of a drug deal gone sour, or a teen suicide, can raise your pulse. There is one moment of inspiration: a fast-paced retelling of Victor's trip to Europe, shot in the style of a camcorder travelogue. The performances, in general, are weak. James Van Der Beek tries to scowl away the ghost of Dawson Leery, but can't. Ian Somerhalder seems to have accepted his past and plays just the kind of character his Versace-model looks equip him for - pity it's not a more interesting one. Fellow ""Young Americans"" survivor Kate Bosworth is entirely forgettable. Only Shannyn Sossamon manages to convince you that beneath the well-heeled teen angst and doe-eyed disaffection there's a living, breathing human and not just a teen TV star looking to make the leap into film. But it isn't quite enough. By the end, I was wishing Sean's maniacal and more interesting brother Patrick would arrive from New York with his axe and Armani raincoat.

731002,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007L4KG,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","&quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; is based on Bret Easton Ellis book of the same title, and the fact tells you all; like the previously filmed &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and &quot;American Psyco&quot; the characters spending time aimlessly in university are not your oridinary clean-cut all-American boys and girls.  But let me hurriedly say that that is not a problem at all here (in fact, not everything about them is repulsive as some critics suggest).The real problem can be found in the name of the director, Roger Avary, who once was working at a local video shop with a film buff called Quention Tarantino.  Unlike his ex-pal, however, Avary's filmic technique are only a showy performance -- split-screen, fast cutting, backward-running shots -- everything is at first mildly funny to see, and then he overuses them.  And we realize that the characters are not well-rounded or interesting in any way (I mean, how many people really care if college students drink so much as the film shows?  We are long past the stage when we are easily shocked by them, living in the time of the internet, you know.)The story is actually a string of loosely connected episodes around drug-dealing (and brother to another Bateman in &quot;American Psycho&quot;) Sean Bateman (James Vab Der Beek) and Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon).  It starts with a party scene where every students got drunk and stoned, and among them we see these two not-quite-happy.  And you are introduced to other characters played by Ian Someholder, Kate Bosworth, and Kip Pardue (though the last two's screen time is fairly short,  Plus you get cameos of Faye Dunnaway and Eric Stoltz.Sean wants to sleep with Lauren, who is in love with another guy.  Sean then sleeps with different girls while Paul Denton (Ian Someholder) is attracted to him.  Every character wants something which they cannot have, and the only thing they can do is &quot;deal with it.&quot;These characters are all shallow and self-centered, but remember, Tarantino has shown many killers in his films and can make them quite engaging and lively presence.  No chance here.  Roger Avary insists on his own &quot;realism&quot; so that Dowson's Creek Van Der Beek must show us how he spends his time in bathroom.  All is done as if saying, &quot;How about that?&quot;  Sorry, but we are not impressed, after watching &quot;Kill Bill&quot; lately.Possibly except for Ms. Sossamon, the acting is of lower kind that would explain why these actors have not achieved higher or bigger level of works after their once memorable performance in career.  They need another agent who has seen Avary's tedious &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; disaster, and can give better advice on their choice of jobs.I do not disagree with the shallow characters -- we may resemble them in some way or other -- but the shallow way of presenting them.  But more fundamental questiuon is the film does not answer the question -- why should we watch this film (which still smells the bubbly 80s) now in the 21st century?",2,The Shallow Film Doesn't know Why We Should  See it Now,1072137600,"12 23, 2003",2003,3021,"['quot', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'based', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'fact', 'previously', 'filmed', 'quot', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Psyco', 'quot', 'characters', 'spending', 'time', 'aimlessly', 'university', 'are', 'not', 'oridinary', 'clean-cut', 'all-American', 'boys', 'girls', 'let', 'hurriedly', 'say', 'not', 'problem', 'here', 'fact', 'not', 'everything', 'repulsive', 'critics', 'suggest', '.The', 'real', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'name', 'director', 'Roger', 'Avary', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'working', 'local', 'video', 'shop', 'film', 'buff', 'called', 'Quention', 'Tarantino', 'ex-pal', 'however', 'Avary', 'filmic', 'technique', 'are', 'only', 'showy', 'performance', 'split-screen', 'fast', 'cutting', 'backward-running', 'shots', 'everything', 'first', 'mildly', 'funny', 'see', 'then', 'realize', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well-rounded', 'interesting', 'way', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'care', 'college', 'students', 'drink', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'shows', 'are', 'long', 'stage', 'when', 'are', 'easily', 'shocked', 'living', 'time', 'internet', 'know', 'story', 'actually', 'string', 'loosely', 'connected', 'episodes', 'drug-dealing', 'brother', 'Bateman', 'quot', 'American', 'Psycho', 'quot', 'Sean', 'Bateman', 'James', 'Vab', 'Der', 'Beek', 'Lauren', 'Hynde', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'students', 'got', 'drunk', 'stoned', 'see', 'two', 'not-quite-happy', 'are', 'introduced', 'other', 'characters', 'played', 'Ian', 'Someholder', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'last', 'two', 'screen', 'time', 'fairly', 'short', 'get', 'cameos', 'Faye', 'Dunnaway', 'Eric', 'Stoltz.Sean', 'sleep', 'Lauren', 'who', 'love', 'guy', 'Sean', 'then', 'different', 'girls', 'Paul', 'Denton', 'Ian', 'Someholder', 'attracted', 'character', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'quot', 'deal', 'it.', 'quot', 'characters', 'are', 'shallow', 'self-centered', 'remember', 'Tarantino', 'shown', 'many', 'killers', 'films', 'can', 'make', 'quite', 'engaging', 'lively', 'presence', 'chance', 'here', 'Roger', 'Avary', 'own', 'quot', 'realism', 'quot', 'Dowson', 'Creek', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'must', 'show', 'how', 'time', 'bathroom', 'done', 'saying', 'quot', 'How', 'quot', 'Sorry', 'are', 'not', 'impressed', 'watching', 'quot', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'quot', 'lately.Possibly', 'Ms.', 'Sossamon', 'acting', 'lower', 'kind', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'actors', 'have', 'not', 'achieved', 'higher', 'bigger', 'level', 'works', 'once', 'memorable', 'performance', 'career', 'need', 'agent', 'who', 'seen', 'Avary', 'tedious', 'quot', 'Killing', 'Zoe', 'quot', 'disaster', 'can', 'give', 'better', 'advice', 'choice', 'jobs.I', 'do', 'not', 'disagree', 'shallow', 'characters', 'may', 'resemble', 'way', 'other', 'shallow', 'way', 'presenting', 'more', 'fundamental', 'questiuon', 'film', 'not', 'answer', 'question', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'still', 'bubbly', '80s', 'now', '21st', 'century']",The Rules of Attraction VHS
731003,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00007L4KG,wellwellwell,"[3, 10]","I rented this movie based on the previews I&#65533;d seen prior to its release, and was expecting good things from it.  And although the casting was very diverse and some of the comedy was humorous, I found this movie to be a huge waste of time.  James Van Der Beek is the main character; as he plays the role of Sean Bateman.  The molester-like vulgar thoughts and actions that Bateman reveals are somewhat stimulating, but in the end only sickening.  The film could be considered as a romance-based comedy with episodes of drama and action, yet the ending and use of the rewind button can&#65533;t really fall under pretense to any of those genres.  Another WB heavyweight appears (Jessica Biel as Lara), but only plays the role of an unintelligent, sex-driven roommate.  Which is typical of the entire film.I&#65533;d categorize this movie as a troublesome mix between Pulp Fiction and Magnolia; both of which portrayed many small stories within one.  And also similar to those two films, there is a weak and/or stupid ending that will leave you wondering why you watched the film.  The movie starts by showing us the ending (which you&#65533;ll figure out halfway through the film) and introduces the characters of Sean, Lauren, Paul, Lara, and a few other no-namers.  Still, none of the parts really take shape or have any relevance to college life.  The movie twists between scenes of suicide, gays, porno-like themes, drugs (primarily pot and cocaine), and backwards storytelling.  Among the suicide attempts and successions, you&#65533;ll see anything from a girl resting naked in a bathtub full of blood to Van Der Beek trying to hang himself with a phone cord.  Paul Denton (played by Ian Somerhalder) is the premiere gay guy, but is supported by a few other gay developments.  And Paul&#65533;s feeble obsession with Bateman is very weak.  Another part of Van Der Beek&#65533;s story is that he owes money to a drug dealer.  Which, as you can imagine, spawns some of the movie&#65533;s more violent imagery.  In the midst of the film&#65533;s horridness, I found many things to be either sick or unnecessary.  For instance, the 5-minute rant from Victor--giving us his life story consisting of drugs, sex, foreign countries, and a forgotten girlfriend (Lauren)--is terrible to the point of annoying.  Also, James Van Der Beek&#65533;s thoughts during his many &#65533;sex&#65533; scenes were appalling; as they&#65533;re reminiscent of a porno movie.  We won&#65533;t even discuss his gay &#65533;sex&#65533; scene with Ian.  His pretty-boy Dawson identity is easily gone.  Again I come back to the backwards film editing.  It was probably the most unnecessary part of the film; it was a bit intriguing  the first time, but after the second or third it becomes bothersome.  The suicide incidents were revolting, although I&#65533;m sure that&#65533;s what the director (Roger Avary) wanted them to be.I hope that I haven&#65533;t spoiled the movie for you; but on the other hand, I hope you don&#65533;t see it.  If you were enticed by the movie&#65533;s trailer, you will be more than let down with the film as a whole.  Its comedy is definitely lacking, yet it&#65533;s the only thing that made the movie watch-able (Van Der Beek singing the Counting Crows&#65533; &#65533;Anna Begins&#65533; and dubbing it his own is most excellent).  And if you are a fan of the WB and all their teen shows, this movie is certainly not for you.  It&#65533;s sick, it&#65533;s unethical, it&#65533;s sexist, but most of all it&#65533;s disappointing.  Only watch this movie if you are a fan of the drug-induced-new-millennia-college-life cycle; or a huge fan of James Van Der Beek.  Otherwise its nauseating and jarring plot, characters, and themes are not worth your time.  If there is anything good about Rules Of Attraction, it&#65533;s either (as I said) the bits of comedy; or the cameo by Fred Savage.",2,"Typical, though not really",1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,3905,"['rented', 'movie', 'based', 'previews', '65533', 'd', 'seen', 'prior', 'release', 'was', 'expecting', 'good', 'things', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'diverse', 'comedy', 'was', 'humorous', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'huge', 'waste', 'time', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'main', 'character', 'role', 'Sean', 'Bateman', 'molester-like', 'vulgar', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'Bateman', 'reveals', 'are', 'somewhat', 'stimulating', 'end', 'only', 'sickening', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'romance-based', 'comedy', 'episodes', 'drama', 'action', 'yet', 'ending', 'use', 'rewind', 'button', 'can', '65533', 't', 'really', 'fall', 'pretense', 'genres', 'WB', 'heavyweight', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Lara', 'only', 'role', 'unintelligent', 'sex-driven', 'roommate', 'Which', 'typical', 'entire', 'film.I', '65533', 'd', 'categorize', 'movie', 'troublesome', 'mix', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Magnolia', 'portrayed', 'many', 'small', 'stories', 'one', 'also', 'similar', 'two', 'films', 'weak', 'and/or', 'stupid', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'why', 'watched', 'film', 'movie', 'showing', 'ending', '65533', 'll', 'figure', 'out', 'halfway', 'film', 'characters', 'Sean', 'Lauren', 'Paul', 'Lara', 'few', 'other', 'no-namers', 'Still', 'none', 'parts', 'really', 'take', 'shape', 'have', 'relevance', 'college', 'life', 'movie', 'scenes', 'suicide', 'gays', 'porno-like', 'themes', 'drugs', 'primarily', 'pot', 'cocaine', 'backwards', 'storytelling', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'successions', '65533', 'see', 'anything', 'girl', 'resting', 'naked', 'bathtub', 'full', 'blood', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'trying', 'hang', 'phone', 'cord', 'Paul', 'Denton', 'played', 'Ian', 'Somerhalder', 'premiere', 'gay', 'guy', 'supported', 'few', 'other', 'gay', 'developments', 'Paul', '65533', 'feeble', 'obsession', 'Bateman', 'very', 'weak', 'part', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', '65533', 's', 'story', 'money', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Which', 'can', 'imagine', 'spawns', 'movie', '65533', 'more', 'violent', 'imagery', 'midst', 'film', '65533', 's', 'horridness', 'found', 'many', 'things', 'be', 'either', 'sick', 'unnecessary', 'instance', '5-minute', 'rant', 'Victor', 'giving', 'life', 'story', 'consisting', 'drugs', 'sex', 'foreign', 'countries', 'forgotten', 'girlfriend', 'Lauren', 'terrible', 'point', 'annoying', 'Also', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', '65533', 's', 'thoughts', 'many', '65533', 'sex', '65533', 'scenes', 'were', 'appalling', '65533', 're', 'reminiscent', 'porno', 'movie', 'won', '65533', 't', 'even', 'discuss', 'gay', '65533', 'sex', '65533', 'scene', 'Ian', 'pretty-boy', 'Dawson', 'identity', 'easily', 'gone', 'Again', 'come', 'back', 'backwards', 'film', 'editing', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'unnecessary', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'intriguing', 'first', 'time', 'second', 'third', 'bothersome', 'suicide', 'incidents', 'were', 'revolting', '65533', 'm', 'sure', '65533', 's', 'what', 'director', 'Roger', 'Avary', 'wanted', 'be.I', 'hope', 'haven', '65533', 't', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'hope', 'don', '65533', 't', 'see', 'were', 'enticed', 'movie', '65533', 's', 'trailer', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'whole', 'comedy', 'definitely', 'lacking', '65533', 's', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'movie', 'watch-able', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'singing', 'Counting', 'Crows', '65533', '65533', 'Anna', 'Begins', '65533', 'dubbing', 'own', 'most', 'excellent', 'are', 'fan', 'WB', 'teen', 'shows', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', '65533', 'sick', '65533', 's', 'unethical', '65533', 's', 'sexist', 'most', '65533', 's', 'disappointing', 'Only', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'drug-induced-new-millennia-college-life', 'cycle', 'huge', 'fan', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Beek', 'Otherwise', 'nauseating', 'jarring', 'plot', 'characters', 'themes', 'are', 'not', 'time', 'anything', 'good', 'Rules', 'Attraction', '65533', 's', 'said', 'bits', 'comedy', 'cameo', 'Fred', 'Savage']",The Rules of Attraction VHS

In fact, it is quite watchable but it does try a little too hard at times to be funny.  It was refreshing to see the Dawson's Creek guy in a different role.  I found some of the scenes very sad in the movie, and that was the idea (girl's suicide).  This scene was particularly well filmed and the accompanying music added definite atmosphere.Adding Faye Dunaway and Eric Stulz in short cameos made very little sense to me.  I assume the purpose of that was to attract audiences, but the remaining cast did an okay job on their own.Worth watching for a snapshot of how stupid teenagers can be.",3,I sat through all of it ... so it must be ok,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,673,"['RULES', 'OF', 'ATTRACTION', 'not', 'worst', 'look', 'wasted', 'teenagers', 'have', 'seen', 'fact', 'quite', 'watchable', 'try', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'times', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'guy', 'different', 'role', 'found', 'scenes', 'very', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'idea', 'girl', 'suicide', 'scene', 'was', 'particularly', 'well', 'filmed', 'accompanying', 'music', 'added', 'definite', 'atmosphere.Adding', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Eric', 'Stulz', 'short', 'cameos', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'assume', 'purpose', 'was', 'attract', 'audiences', 'remaining', 'cast', 'did', 'okay', 'job', 'own.Worth', 'watching', 'snapshot', 'how', 'stupid', 'teenagers', 'can', 'be']",The Rules of Attraction VHS
