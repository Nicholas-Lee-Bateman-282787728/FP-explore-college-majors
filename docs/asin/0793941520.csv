Arnold Schwarzenegger has done it again. He has done thrillers, action films, comedies and now even family movies. No matter what kind of movie he has done in the past he has always made it a MASTERPIECE!The movie starts out with Howard (Schwarzenegger) as a distracted businessman who hasn't paid much attention to his son lately. His son Jamie (Lloyd) is really excited about Christmas coming up and desperately along with every kid in the city wants one thing for Christmas: A Turbo Man doll. Every child has been begging their parents to buy it. Even though his wife Liz (Watson) told him to buy it a month ago, he FORGOT!!Now it's Christmas Eve and he decides then to go buy the most popular toy on the market. Luckily so he don't look stupid, dozens of of other parents are doing the same thing. Now at the first store, they are SOLD OUT! Then one store after the other and the other and NOTHING!! Then he finds out that one store just got a late delivery of Turbo Man dolls and they are having a lottery to see who gets one first. So they whole crowd goes crazy after all the number balls are thrown in the air. He fights a mailmain (Sinbad) for number 2. He loses his ball. Then a mall Santa Claus convinces him that they have Turbo Man dolls to sell him. He follows the guy to his secret facility. He actually pays $300 for a doll and opens the box and it is all broken. They ARE CONARTISTS!! After all the trouble he's been through he starts punching everyone. He fights migit Santa's and even 7' giants.Finally, after being chased my a cop, he accidenlty hides in the dressing room for the people in the parade. They think he is the replacement for the Turbo Man actor that goes on the parade float. So he finally gets his hand on a turbo man and now see what happens next.

If you *ever* want this movie, BUY IT NOW... here's why:For those who don't know, this movie was pulled off the shelves about 3 years ago.  Fox was on the losing end of a $19 million dollar lawsuit which claimed they had ripped off the script from a Detroit high school teacher (Brian Webster).  Later, the award was reduced to $1.5 million.  Meanwhile, Fox appealed the case which held off any payment until at least late 2003; however, Fox was forced by this decision to pull the movie off the market and excess stock was sent back to Fox.Murray Hill publishing (the Plaintiff)  had optioned a script titled ""Could This Be Christmas"" from Laurel as far back as 1993.  The script was about two men trying to secure the last known Action Man doll on Christmas Eve.  Murray Hill says they pitched ""Could This Be Christmas"" to Fox in 1994 and a year later Robert G. Laurel Lessnau learned of Fox's plans for ""Jingle All the Way"" which was penned by a script reader for Fox Studios.On May 22, 2004, Fox won on appeal.  Apparently they were able to show evidence that ""Jingle All the Way"" was based on a treatment that predated the pitch for ""Could This Be Christmas"" in 1994.Murray Hill vows to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Incidentally, Murray Hill's Lessnau died in September 2001, about 6 months after the company's court victory.When the movie was pulled, you saw the price on this DVD skyrocket.  Here on Amazon, if you search for ""Jingle All The Way"", you'll find an ""out-of-stock"" version.  This is the one that was pulled.  Notice that the price is STILL (as of today) between $26.99 and $132.57.  Before this re-release was announced, the prices were all in the $100 dollar range.  Some people obviously have seen the writing on the wall and have reduced the price of these used DVDs on the eve of its re-release.  Some people, I guess, have not heard of this coming.  Anyhow, if you want this movie buy one (or two) NOW before any further legal action makes it unavailable again.  Then you can sell your extra here at Amazon for a hefty profit.",4,Some background on this movie...,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,2146,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'finally', 'getting', 're-released', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', '*ever*', 'want', 'movie', 'BUY', 'IT', 'NOW', 'here', 'why', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'shelves', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'Fox', 'was', 'losing', 'end', '19', 'million', 'dollar', 'lawsuit', 'claimed', 'had', 'ripped', 'off', 'script', 'Detroit', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'Brian', 'Webster', 'Later', 'award', 'was', 'reduced', '1.5', 'million', 'Meanwhile', 'Fox', 'appealed', 'case', 'held', 'off', 'payment', 'least', 'late', '2003', 'however', 'Fox', 'was', 'forced', 'decision', 'pull', 'movie', 'market', 'excess', 'stock', 'was', 'sent', 'back', 'Fox.Murray', 'Hill', 'publishing', 'Plaintiff', 'had', 'optioned', 'script', 'titled', 'Could', 'Be', 'Christmas', 'Laurel', 'far', 'back', '1993', 'script', 'was', 'two', 'men', 'trying', 'secure', 'last', 'known', 'Action', 'Man', 'doll', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Murray', 'Hill', 'pitched', 'Could', 'Be', 'Christmas', 'Fox', '1994', 'year', 'later', 'Robert', 'G.', 'Laurel', 'Lessnau', 'learned', 'Fox', 'plans', 'Jingle', 'Way', 'was', 'penned', 'script', 'reader', 'Fox', 'Studios.On', 'May', '22', '2004', 'Fox', 'won', 'appeal', 'Apparently', 'were', 'able', 'show', 'evidence', 'Jingle', 'Way', 'was', 'based', 'treatment', 'predated', 'pitch', 'Could', 'Be', 'Christmas', '1994.Murray', 'Hill', 'vows', 'appeal', 'case', 'U.S.', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Incidentally', 'Murray', 'Hill', 'Lessnau', 'died', 'September', '2001', 'about', '6', 'months', 'company', 'court', 'victory.When', 'movie', 'was', 'pulled', 'saw', 'price', 'DVD', 'skyrocket', 'Here', 'Amazon', 'search', 'Jingle', 'Way', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out-of-stock', 'version', 'one', 'was', 'pulled', 'Notice', 'price', 'STILL', 'today', '26.99', '132.57', 're-release', 'was', 'announced', 'prices', 'were', '100', 'dollar', 'range', 'people', 'obviously', 'have', 'seen', 'writing', 'wall', 'have', 'reduced', 'price', 'used', 'DVDs', 'eve', 're-release', 'people', 'guess', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'coming', 'Anyhow', 'want', 'movie', 'buy', 'one', 'two', 'NOW', 'further', 'legal', 'action', 'unavailable', 'again', 'Then', 'can', 'sell', 'extra', 'here', 'Amazon', 'hefty', 'profit']",N/A

I was a little put off at first when I saw that the case had the extended cut at a 122 minute running time.

So if you'd prefer that version, you have both from which to choose.As for the features.  A little disappointing.  They all center on the fictional Turbo Man used in the movie.

Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o...","[3, 3]","I can't beleive this movie gets the bad reviews it does, but it seems to be a love it/hate it relationship.  Even Dr. Laura chimed in about how bad this was, but at least she admits she didn't watch it all (else I think she may change her mind).First - unless you watch it to the conclusion, you may think it's about parental materialism and purchased loyalties.  IT'S NOT!  In fact, the end of the movie very firmly reinforces the idea that Christmas is NOT about materialism.I don't want to spoil the plot for you, but so many bad reviews may lead you away from this movie if I do not dispell at least some of them.  The movie is in fact quite heart-warming.  Where others have said that the kid is annoying and materialistic, he is the one who best demonstrates true christmas spirit at the end by admiting that it is not the TOY that matters at all - in fact he GIVES IT AWAY after getting it, in favour of a BETTER gift: his own father.The supposedly leacherous character of hartman is, in fact, leacherous.  But his target (Arnold's wife) quite firmly affirms her monogomous loyalty by cold-cocking the leacher upside his noggin.  Also, at the end.And Sinbad's performance is pure, well, Sinbad!  I love this guy.  An overweight postman trying to outrun the President's Fitness Council chairman!  HA!  Running down the street throwing mail overboard to lighten the load!

And, for those of us who are really into Christmas shopping and have been on that search for the elusive, must have toy of the year, it really touches a nerve!Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Howard Langston, a workaholic father who's failing with his family. He is constantly breaking promises and missing family events simply by being absent-minded and overly concerned with his business. When he shows up far too late for his son Jamie's Karate presentation, he realizes he's got some major sucking up to do. Howard immediately offers to get his son anything he wants for Christmas as a quick fix. But, little does Howard know that the toy Jamie wants, the official Turbo Man action figure, is the hottest toy of the season! No stores in town have one, and tomorrow is Christmas Eve!!!Howard gets an early start in the morning, arriving at a toy store that hasn't opened yet and already has a large crowd outside. Here, he meets his biggest competition, an unstable mailman named Myron (Sinbad). Myron is also an inexperienced shopper whose son has asked for a Turbo Man figure. Both men are shocked and angered when everyone in the store mocks them upon hearing what they are looking for, and this is where their heated rivalry begins. Howard and Myron bump into each other at location after location in their search for the evasive toy and continue to physically abuse each other at nearly every encounter, and every bit of it is quite hilarious! In addition to dealing with Myron's attacks while searching for Turbo Man, Howard has to keep tabs on his intrusive neighbor, Tim (Phil Hartman), who is continuously making plays for Howard's wife, Liz (Rita Wilson). It's not as confusing as it sounds, but it's a lot for a man to have to worry about on Christmas Eve when he's gotta meet his family at a parade later on that same day.""Jingle All the Way"" is a great Christmas adventure that is full of laughs and mayhem! It's not supposed to be ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" it's just supposed to be funny! And it is, if you have any sort of sense of humor at all and any experience with last-minute shopping during the Holiday Season! Arnold Schwarzenegger is still not a great actor, but he plays the role of a helpless, inexperienced shopper rather well, and this is probably my favorite of all his movies that I've seen. Sinbad is great as nutty mailman Myron, and Phil Hartman steals the movie as Tim, the seemingly perfect single dad that all the neighborhood women want, but who mainly has eyes for Liz. And, upon repeated viewings, Jake Lloyd (who plays Arnold's son) isn't as annoying as everyone says. ""Jingle All the Way"" may not be as magical as ""Miracle On 34th Street,"" but it still qualifies as an annual MUST WATCH Christmas movie for this viewer, and probably many others!Updating this review for the ""Family Fun Edition"" 2007 DVD release, the newest edition, which maintains the enhanced widescreen of the previous release,  includes a handful of new extras along with a special, extended cut of the film. Unfortunately, having watched the extended cut, I can definitely say I still prefer the theatrical version. Luckily, this new release includes both. The scenes added into the extended version were deservedly cut from the film, and it also includes a different and completely inappropriate song in the early toy hunting montage, making the theatrical version much more enjoyable. The only positive thing I can say about the extended version is that they move the post-end credits scene to just before the end credits, and it fits so well that one wonders why it wasn't placed there to begin with. The extras include ""The Making of a Hero"", which is a somewhat interesting look at the creation of the Turbo Man character, ""Super Kids"", a pretty unnecessary interview montage with random kids on their wishes to be superheroes, and ""Turbo Man Unmasked,"" a short and mildly funny mockumentary on the hero as a former (fictional) TV star that inspired a fictional action figure craze. Other extras include a photo gallery that is happily in a slideshow format and two DVD games. ""Guess the Gift"" is a somewhat fun game.

Its being touted as a family film, but look deeper.  Its a dark comedy about lies, greed, and broken promises.  This film works on two levels.  Sinbad's best performance is in this film.  He is suprisingly more menacing than the governator himself, Ah-nuld.

159695,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,0793941520,Simon Davis,"[5, 6]","""Jingle All the Way"", is an oddity in the huge offering of Christmas movies that get an airing during the festive season each year. While it certainly is not to everyone's taste and lacks the sentimental and affirming message of so many other offerings at this time it can also be viewed as a quite candid illustration of what has happened to Christmas for many people where commercialism has taken over from the original purpose of the holidays. Arnold Schwarzeneggar is not someone you would automatically associate with the likes of James Stewart, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope as a Christmas icon but aside from his ""Terminator"", type roles he has proven himself quite adept at broad comedy and he handles his frantic role in ""Jingle All the Way"", very well. Never could this movie be called a Christmas classic and I personally feel a bit uneasy with the message it is conveying about the Christmas season and what it represents but the best way to approach it is as the frantic, broad comedy it most certainly is, choc full of pratfalls and slap stick that makes it a definite variation on the more traditional Christmas fare being offered.""Jingle All the Way"", opens with harried salesman Howard Langston (Arnold Swarzenegger), missing yet another one of his son Jamie's (Jake Llyod)activites, this being his karate class award ceremony. Neglectful also of his wife Liz (Rita Wilson) Howard continually makes promises to both of them that he will find more time for family matters however his work always ends up taking priority. Howard says to Jamie that he will make up fo rhis neglect and asks him what does he especially want for Christmas. Jamie asks for the hugely popular Turbo Man action figure which has been largely out of stock in stores since Thanksgiving. So begins a mad scramble by Howard to find the elusive toy which takes him on a hellish trip through every major department store in the city. Along the way Howard encounters a very disturbing cross section of mankind from manic postman Myron Larabee (Sinbad) who is also seeking out the elusive Turbo Man for his own child, to a devious conman Santa (John Belushi), who tricks Howard into buying a fake cheap imported version of the toy from a scam production company. Meanwhile neglected wife Liz is having to deal with the unwelcome attentions of sleazy neighbour Ted Maltin who pretends that he is only full of the ""holiday spirit"", while having to explain to Jamie why his father hasn't been home all day on Christmas Eve and is about to miss the annual Christmas parade in their local area that he promised to attend. Only after Howard's own desperate behaviour sees him stoop to robbing Ted's own wrapped Turbo Man doll from under his neighbour's Christmas tree, does he see the error of his ways and an opportunity to well and truly make it up to his family arrives when he is mistaken for the actor who was to play Turbo Man in the Christmas Parade and takes his place. After rescuing his own son after he is selected as the prize winner of the last available Turbo Man figure above other jealous would be owners Howard finally is able to be the hero and role model that his son always wanted him to be and this also engineers a reconciliation with Liz who with the help of a well aimed serving of eggnog manages to get rid of Ted's very unwelcome attentions at the parade for a happy fadeout.I suppose the main problem for most viewers would be that apart from the very cynical message this film conveys about Christmas, is the fact that there are really no likeable or identifiable characters in the whole story. Only after the admittedly amusing scene where Howard/Arnold breaks into his neighbours home to steal his wrapped Turbo Man but then suddenly realises what he has done and that this madness is not worth it, do we see even an ounce of humanity in any of the characters. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fairly good job with the largely impossible character he is given to work with here and while there is no deep examination of his character his handling of the numerous pratfalls and confrontations with salespeople and rival shoppers, ie Sinbad, is quite amusing. While his neglect of his family obligations is something that is not right the characters of his wife Liz and son Jamie are also problematic in that they seem to have little to do but simply complain about Howard's neglect of them with little being given by them in terms of support for Howard's busy schedule. Sindab's playing of the obviously quite unhinged mail man and rival for Howard in the hunt for the Turbo Man toy is played very broadly and loudly and his dementia is actually at times quite disturbing to watch as is the Phil Hartman character of the sleazy neighbour Ted who hides his darker side under the cover of a supposedly gentle and loving man just upholding the Christmas spirit. It is however nice to see veteran actor Robert Conrad reappear on the big screen in the role of harrassed Officer Hummell who continually runs into trouble with Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in various locations throughout the movie. Supposedly based on the producer's(Chris Columbus) , real life Christmas shopping experiences it really is a festive experience you wouldn't wish on anyone with icons such as Santa Claus depicted as a devious con man and shoppers depicted as almost vicious hunters consumed by greed, materialism and hatred for their fellow man. Visually ""Jingle All the Way"", compensates for its tarnished message with beautiful locations shot around a snowbound Minneapolis/St. Paul region which gives the film at least a rich festive look in between all the madness.""Jingle All the Way"", would most definately not be for all tastes and I find the best way to appreciate it is to really remove any of the usual expectations you have in regard to Christmas movies and simply go along for the wild ride. Despite having a upbeat and quite predictable conclusion it certainly does show in a most unflattering light what has become wrong with much of our holiday season and how the pressures of getting that elusive last present before closing time often overirdes everything else and can make people do things they ordinarily know are wrong. ""Jungle All the Way"",is certainly guilty of being exaggerated and lacking in any subtlety but in my case a viewing of it makes me think more clearly about what Christmas really should be about and on that level I guess the film has real value. Sit back and enjoy the wild search by Arnold Schwarzenegger for that elusive Turbo Man action figure in the crazy Christmas offering ""Jingle All the Way"", soon it might just make you think differently about Christmas in the future.",3,Non Traditional Christmas Movie That Illustrates The Commercial Slant On the Season,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,6692,"['Jingle', 'Way', 'oddity',

She takes it and walks away. He takes it out and discovers that it is TurboMan's sidekick, Booster. He then runs after the woman in the car.2.) In the following scene of Howard traveling to different toy stores looking for TurboMan, the 'Jingle all the Way' song is replaced by ""The Christmas Song"".3.)

A scene with Howard riding home in a tow truck after his car had been stripped where he's rehearsing how he was going to explain what happened to him to his wife.9.) An alternate ending: instead of the ending at the parade, the film fades back to Howard's house. He turns on the lights on his tree and everybody is happy. Liz says ""It was so nice that you went to all that to get him that present.... so what did you get me?"" It ends with a closeup of Howard looking horrified. This scene originally played following the credits (theatrical and home video versions).Personally I prefer this edition cause I am a sucker for Director's Cuts...plus I do like this movie alot. This Extended Cut is presented in it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, a fullscreen version is not offered on this disc. If you like this movie and have the previous edition I would recommend upgrading, if you're new to this movie then this is the edition to get.",5,Jingle All The Way - Family Fun Edition,1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,2364,"['October', '16th', '2007', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'released', 'Jingle', 'All', 'Way', 'Family', 'Fun', 'Edition', 'extended', 'cut', 'specially', 'supervised', 'director', 'Brian', 'Levant', '94', 'minutes', 'verus', '89', 'minutes', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'edition', 'following', 'additions', '1', 'Instead', 'Howard', 'going', 'right', 'woman', 'car', 'first', 'woman', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'matching', 'fur', 'coat', 'TurboMan', 'package', 'bag', 'money', 'walks', 'away', 'out', 'discovers', 'TurboMan', 'sidekick', 'Booster', 'then', 'woman', 'car.2', 'following', 'scene', 'Howard', 'traveling', 'different', 'toy', 'stores', 'looking', 'TurboMan', ""'Jingle"", 'Way', 'song', 'replaced', 'Christmas', 'Song', '.3', 'scene', 'Howard', 'GMC', 'when', ""'re"", 'driving', 'Santa', 'warehouse', 'where', 'Howard', 'saying', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'sign', 'supposed', 'Turbo', 'Man', 'doll', 'sentence', 'mall', 'Santa', ""n't"", 'sing', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Forgot', 'song', 'car.4', 'Additional', 'dialogue', 'warehouse', 'as', 'well', 'Mall', 'Santa', 'other', 'Santas', 'singing', 'chorus', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Forgot', '.5', 'rock', 'version', 'Jingle', 'way', 'plays', 'Howard', 'warehouse', 'Santas6', 'extra', 'scene', 'Myron', 'Larabee', 'describing', 'Johnny', '7', 'O.M.A', 'gun', 'Howard.7', 'Additional', 'dialogue', 'Howard', 'cops', 'warehouse.8', 'scene', 'Howard', 'riding', 'home', 'tow', 'truck', 'car', 'had', 'been', 'stripped', 'where', 'rehearsing', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'wife.9', 'alternate', 'ending', 'instead', 'ending', 'parade', 'film', 'back', 'Howard', 'house', 'lights', 'tree', 'everybody', 'happy', 'Liz', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'went', 'get', 'present', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'closeup', 'Howard', 'looking', 'horrified', 'scene', 'originally', 'played', 'following', 'credits', 'theatrical', 'home', 'video', 'versions', '.Personally', 'prefer', 'edition', 'cause', 'am', 'sucker', 'Director', 'Cuts', 'do', 'movie', 'alot', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'presented', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'fullscreen', 'version', 'not', 'offered', 'disc', 'like', 'movie', 'have', 'previous', 'edition', 'would', 'recommend', 'upgrading', ""'re"", 'new', 'movie', 'then', 'edition', 'get']",N/A
