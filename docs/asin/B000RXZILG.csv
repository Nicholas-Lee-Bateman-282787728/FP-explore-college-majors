Her supporting cast members are also quite good.Americans may have some difficulty understanding the accent(s), but for the most part her scenes translate well. It seemed to me that there were sketches that had been cut from television so it was nice to see some new things. However, I was puzzled as to why there were no extras included on the dvd.

1084318,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B000RXZILG,Sylviastel,"[19, 20]","Catherine Tate may be one of the newest talents to arrive from England. Her show is not yet broadcasted in America as it should have. Regardless, it is one of the funniest shows that I have seen in a long time and Catherine Tate is becoming one of my television favorites. She can transform herself from a young flygirl teenager to an annoying old woman. In between, she plays the woman who is frightened of her own shadow; the mall information lady who is useless, haven't we met one of them; the woman who can't get drunk enough to have sex with her boyfriend; the drunk real estate agent who makes crude remarks, and others. Anyway, the six episodes are really wonderful to watch over and over again. As somebody who got the first season of the show, I hope other American anglophiles will take a chance on Catherine Tate. She's one of Britain's funniest leading ladies.",5,"The Woman of Many, Many Different Faces!!!",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,873,"['Catherine', 'Tate', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'newest', 'talents', 'arrive', 'England', 'show', 'not', 'yet', 'broadcasted', 'America', 'should', 'have', 'Regardless', 'one', 'funniest', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'becoming', 'one', 'television', 'favorites', 'can', 'transform', 'young', 'flygirl', 'teenager', 'annoying', 'old', 'woman', 'woman', 'who', 'frightened', 'own', 'shadow', 'mall', 'information', 'lady', 'who', 'useless', 'have', ""n't"", 'met', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'drunk', 'enough', 'have', 'sex', 'boyfriend', 'drunk', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'crude', 'remarks', 'others', 'Anyway', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'somebody', 'who', 'got', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'hope', 'other', 'American', 'anglophiles', 'will', 'take', 'chance', 'Catherine', 'Tate', 'one', 'Britain', 'funniest', 'leading', 'ladies']",The Catherine Tate Show - Series One

So nice to see real talent,which  is getting harder and harder to find anymore .Do I like every single sketch?Nah,but even the baton sketch, which isn't my favorite has kind of a heart to it which makes it sweet. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be blown away by talent , just a warning though for those watching with little ones or people who are offended by colorful language, there is cursing a plenty, especially when she does the old lady character, but that's real life isn't it? :)",5,"Such talent, I am truly amazed!",1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,724,"['Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'chameleon', 'French', 'Saunders', 'who', 'are', 'favorite', 'British', 'comedy', 'team', '.Normally', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'tend', 'be', 'tad', 'relative', 'other', 'not', 'lady', 'WOW', 'So', 'nice', 'see', 'real', 'talent', 'getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'anymore', '.Do', 'like', 'single', 'sketch', 'Nah', 'even', 'baton', 'sketch', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'kind', 'heart', 'sweet', 'Would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'talent', 'just', 'warning', 'watching', 'little', 'ones', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'offended', 'colorful', 'language', 'cursing', 'plenty', 'especially', 'when', 'old', 'lady', 'character', 'real', 'life', ""n't""]",The Catherine Tate Show - Series One
