""Skyscraper"" (1997) is directed by the same genius who brought us Anna's other blockbuster -1995's ""To The Limit"".  Both movies are similar(wow, really?) in that Anna uses a gun, she gets naked a few times, and attempts to act too much.  Oh yeah, there's also a really evil guy and a lot of explosions. If I must choose between the two for entertainment value, I'm going with Skyscraper.  Not only does Anna have more nude scenes in this one, her acting (and everyone elses) is even more hilarious (if you actually watch it with sound!).  Also there aren't as many long stretches of ""acting"" and ""explosions"".  Bottom line, a laughably bad acted movie with breasts, guns, and things exploding.

400265,A231ZCJGWZA38A,6304087578,"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix""","[5, 7]","Where do I begin so you can get some idea of this whole bad-version-of-Die-Hard-meets-softcore-porn mess?  Let's start with poor pitiful Anna.  This wannabe actress is so short on talent, you'll be  howling at how bad she is.  When she isn't whining her lines with a really  bad Southern drawl, then she's pouting her collagen-bloated lips.  That's  it.  That's the extent of her acting.  Cue card reading is very evident and  rumors that she couldn't remember the lines from the grade-school script  are confirmed when an earpiece is noticeable in a couple of scenes.  But  she's not the only bad actor in this disaster.  The supporting cast is full  of over-the-top thespians who seem convinced they'll win Oscars for their  amateurish performance.  The juvenile script doesn't add to this either.  Plot gaffes abound.  The most glaring is when Anna easily kicks through a  window in a building that is supposedly designed to withstand riots and  military firepower.  Go figure!  Then we're treated to a downtown Los  Angeles with almost no cars or pedestrians.  Although, once the bad guys  start plummeting to their deaths and the police finally arrive, then  there's traffic everywhere and there are more civilians running around than  at a local shopping mall.  Continuity is non-existent.  After fighting off  one of the bad guys, Anna has blood on her right arm and on the right side  of her face.  A couple of scenes later, the blood is gone.  Then it  reappears on the left side of her face.  And despite all her fighting, her  long fingernails never break or chip.  What a woman!  The whole thing  becomes so pathetic, you wonder who edited this.  Even the three nude  scenes (which have nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the story) end  up being more comical than erotic.  One interesting comment: in a storyline  that supposedly takes place in one day, Anna actually gains weight between  the time the movie starts and the final scene.  Looks like she was visiting  the fridge a little too often between takes.

400276,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6304087578,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 3]","""Skyscraper"" stars Anna Nicole Smith as Carrie Wisk, a helicopter pilot for ""Heliscort,"" an air taxi service in Los Angeles. She is married to an LA cop and finds herself in the midst of a confusing plot complete with government conspiracy, terrorist ninjas, gun battles, a top secret briefcase in a dumpster, and an obligatory shower scene. The script is largely incoherent, but it's better than the acting. Her accent is beyond tolerable, and her countenance does not exactly lend plausibility to her casting as a pilot of one of the most notoriously difficult to fly machines on earth.After a subplot about wanting to have a baby and her husband's fear of flying (apparently her boss just lets her take the helicopter home and use it for errands), her hubby, Gordon (Richard Steinmetz) gets dropped off at terrorist central, where he promptly asks one of the bad guys to cuff himself (I guess police procedures are a bit more laid back in LA). While Carrie whisks the bad guys from terror site to terror site obliviously, Dudley (Gary Imhoff), the worst security guard ever, realizes that a huge skyscraper is being taken over by terrorists and its occupants are hostages. The next half hour or so features lots of extremely bad accents, ridiculous stereotypes, and plotpoints that lead nowhere. Suddenly the least likeable character in the movie enters the distasteful melange on a Big Wheel. Who could it be? Why it's Billy Ray, played by Daniel Wayne Smith, Anna's late son and obvious kidnapping fodder, who is the only one able to escape the vicious terrorists while riding around the building going ""vroom."" Seriously. In real life both Anna and Daniel had tragic lives; in this film you will have no difficulty sensing their special relationship, as acting talent is evidently largely inherited.Of course Gordon is the police officer assigned to the case, and after a disgusting flashback establishing that Carrie excels at marksmanship (Caution: the love theme from ""Skyscraper"" is far more odious than anything ever recorded by ""Berlin""), Dudley and Carrie team up to retake the building. Dudley explains that the ""Emergency Containment System"" is activated, rendering the building incapable of letting anyone in or out, in violation of every building code on the planet. Despite this revelation (and lots of fretting from the building's architect, which pads the film immensely), the next shot is a cop walking in an open door.Since everyone is sealed in the building, Carrie calls on her vast intellect and sets the building on fire, and agrees to give herself over to the terrorists. (Seriously.) This is when I learned two very interesting things: first, in LA a hook and ladder truck responds to a trashcan fire; and second, an abundance of Shakespearean quotes in a terrible movie only exacerbate the awfulness of the film, they do not raise the standard of dialogue. The terrorists don't seem to grasp that shooting the hook and ladder truck with a Rocket Propelled Grenade will attract police scrutiny, and reinforcements arrive in record numbers. Carrie and Gordon rendezvous in the basement, and it's Carrie who goes to rescue the hostages, not the trained police officer. You just know that the terrorists will eventually use hapless Billy Ray as leverage, drawing Carrie into a karate death match on the roof, and you would be right. I won't tell you how it ends, but I'm pretty certain you can guess (like you actually needed to watch this thing to know).This movie is relentlessly cheap: in actuality only one helicopter appears onscreen playing all airborne roles (check the registration and very temporary ""Police"" decals if you don't believe me), and except for the scenes in Carrie's house (complete with Marilyn Monroe print) and the helicopter scenes, it's pretty much shot in an office tower, making the budget lower than low. If you are after a bad movie, this definitely fits the bill, but it's not remotely entertaining, even for camp value. Smith appears out of shape and not especially alert, and her acting (while not the worst in the film) is not so much funny as sad.

Some movies can suck so much that they are actually enjoyable to watch. We stumbled across Skyscraper, a true masterpiece in movie dullness. What convinced us? Well, that has to have been Anna Nicole Smith's resume. Is read as follows:*Playmate of the year 1993*Sex diva beyond comparison*Married to an ancient billionaire - widow short after the wedding*H&M; Lingerie model*Possibly the least talented actress in the world.This movie is positively the lamest, most boring, worst scripted, worst acted, badly paced movie ever made in the 90s. Words can't describe how much this movie sucks. We were in the mood for something really cheap to diss the hell out of, to really have a huge laugh at. This movie didn't even manage that! Anna Nicole Smith's acting is absolutely non-existent. As soon as she opens her mouth you can tell she is reading off a script board that someone is holding up behind the camera. She can't even move, walk or run without looking awkward and rehearsed. You can tell she is thinking really hard, conscious of every move she makes. You really start feeling sorry for the poor chick. This entire movie has to be a joke - on her! And not even her overly exploited boobs save this movie, because there is a great chance you've already turned it off before that first practically-soft core-porn scene unfolds on the screen.
