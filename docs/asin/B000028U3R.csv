513738,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B000028U3R,Ace-of-Stars,"[5, 6]","*THIS is the kind of homegrown animated feature film American audiences have been waiting decades for! No nausiating operatic renditions, no insulting goofy sidekicks, no talking anthropomorphized animals, no tapdancing kitchen appliances -- No Dumbing Down!Warner Bros. appears to have grasped something that other U.S. film studios with animation divisions still quite haven't yet: Warner understands that there is a REASON ''Nippon no Anime'' feature films have such a huge worldwide appeal! DreamWorks SKG still seems to want to mimic the Disney model (though taking their themes to a somewhat higher, more mature level) -- which really should come as no surprise, since former Disney icon, Jeffery Katzenburg, is now one of the major driving forces at DreamWorks SKG, and many former Disney animators are also now part of the DreamWorks team, while Disney appears to be ''playing it safe'' by sticking to the old, non-varying ''Disney Standard'' with their own ''in house'' productions and choosing, instead, to merely acquire the American rights to popular established Japanese anime features like ''Mononoke Hime.'' Warner's ''THE IRON GIANT,'' by contrast, breaks with the tired and worn American tradition and presents a very beautiful animated feature with a very beautiful story.The animation for ''THE IRON GIANT'' still reflects a strong American artistic style -- which is not necessarily a bad thing, since it supplies the viewer with a comfortable ''familiarity'' and not a sense ''foreignness'' or slight alienation. But as the story unfolds it immediately begins to sink in that this is NOT some typicical ''kiddie cartoon'' movie; that it is unique as homemade animated features are concerned; that it is a melding of animation and good storytelling that places it light-years ahead of your average run-of-the-mill Disney animated feature. Also, the marriage of traditional ''cel animation'' with ''CGI,'' as used in this film, flows very smoothly and believably -- it is one of those rare films where the two radically different animation ''technologies,'' if you will, compliment one another and work perfectly together, rather than clashing with each other and distracting the viewer. (Rintarou's ''METROPOLIS'' is the ultimate example of a ''cel/CGI'' wedding gone bad!)Playing it straighter than most American animated features geared toward a younger audience, ''THE IRON GIANT's'' real beauty is in its storytelling -- Not only is it a delight to watch for its warm & touching ''lighthearted'' moments, but it is also a very powerful and thought provoking experience, revisiting some of the old morality play standards such as friendship, acceptance, personal responsibility, and the freedom to decide one's own life course.Set in a small New England seaside village in the 1950s-- during an era when ''Red Menace,'' extra-terrestrial and atomic bomb paranoias are the order of the day --''THE IRON GIANT'' follows the adventures of Hogarth Hughes, a young boy who is the only child in a single parent household. One night, when Hogarth's mom is asked to work late, he discovers evidence of what he assumes to be ''invaders from Mars'' -- a belief inspired by the earlier rantings of a supposed ''eyewitness'' who claims to have had an actual physical encounter with one of the ''Martians.'' Armed with his pellet rifle, Hogarth marches off into the woods around his house looking for he-has-no-idea-what and encounters the title character ... a towering robot with a deadly secret.As a result of the unpredictable events which take place during that first encounter, an unusual bond forms between these two unlikely and lonely souls: Hogarth, who has few friends, and the ''metal man,'' who finds itself alone in a foreign place with no memory of who it is, where it's from, or what its ''purpose'' is.But the evidence of the robot's activities do not go unnoticed by the Government, which suspects that Russian activity may be at play in the small town. Kent Mansley, a fiery and relentless ''Commiephobe'' is dispatched by Washington to investigate and eventually comes to suspect-- and later prove --that the metal giant does in fact exist and that Hogarth is somehow connected with it, resulting in our young hero's attempt to stay one step ahead of their pursuer, which includes enlisting the aid of a new friend, Dean, who also happens to have the perfect hideout for a gigantic ''metal-eating'' machine.Despite the fact that a suspension of logic and reason is required in order to get past the ''metal-eating robot that can experience physical hunger'' sub-theme (just go with it), the entire movie plays out very well, right down to its heroic, tear-jerking climax. ''THE IRON GIANT'' would, without question, be one of my first picks for a ''Top Ten'' favorite movies of all time list (...and that's not a statement I make lightly). My only regret is that I never got the chance to see it on the big screen when it played in theatres.Simultaneously humorous and dramic, I strongly recommend ''THE IRON GIANT'' for adults as well as for its younger target demographic. To miss out on this one is to truly miss out on something special.* * *",5,American Animation That Gets It Right!,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,5176,"['*THIS', 'kind', 'homegrown', 'animated',

It is also one of those few movies I watched as a kid over and over and never got tired of, mostly because of finding new meanings within the film.The reason for The Iron Giant's success isn't hard to discern - it has to do with the writing. The script is crisp, smartly-paced, intelligent, and emotionally satisfying. It recalls the strengths of E.T. without the weaknesses.

The Iron Giant is filled with small moments that only older viewers will get, but which pass so quickly that kids won't realize they have missed anything.

Could not help noticing that every 5th or 6th of them mentions Disney products as something very different from the Warners masterpiece.  But Warners is taking it's first  steps in full-length animation and of course quite eager to make a name for  itself at the market. Do you seriously expect them to duplicate the Disney  formula of incessantly singing heroes/heroines traveling exotic landscapes  in a company of mischeviously giggling sidekicks? Of course the first  releases of the major studio have to be innovative. Warner is ready to earn  less but make it's presense felt in the market, to back up it's ambitions  with something worth mentioning. So the superbly creative team got the  adequate funding and now we have this rare gem. I suppose that was the case  in Disney's early years but now it's mostly routine and marketing overkill.A lot of reviewers mention the Cold War relics making the film ring true  but I see another All-American tradition behind the plot. Remember Shane?  Yes,yes,yes! Retired gunfighter befriending a boy. It's a Western in all  it's archetypal splendor! In which inter-galactical battles the big guy  took his deadly part part? Who knows? He came out of nowhere.  -&quot; You  are not a gun!&quot; - But when the baddies close in he is spitting fire -  and what the difference if it's space blasters that make enemy run for  cover - not the six-guns of the great tradition? The Iron Giant is  laconical, galant with the ladies and children - he is a bit of a child  himself. He is rushing unflinchingly towards his destiny to save the loved  ones. Do you need more similarities?As for the quality of animation it  made me happy every time I saw The Giant move with such UNPREDICTABLE ease.  When you see the great chunk of metal you expect him to creak and limp but  what really happens takes your breath away.Characterization is above  all praise. The people are really alive! Neurotic beatnik yearning for the  contact with fellow humans, owerworked single mother - and the boy! Every  one of them is worthy of Oscar nomination.

Nevertheless, The Iron Giant is amazingly powerful and very  believable.There are two stories going on at the same time. The first,  obvious story is geared towards children, as young Hogarth Hughes  &quot;befriends&quot; a giant robot from space who apparently had his  memory wiped out when he tried to eat a power plant (not as silly as it  sounds). This story is filled with the standard cartoon slapstick comedy  and the casual childish gag. Thankfully, there are no songs within sight  (most reviewers noticed this). In fact, none would befit this animated film  (I have difficulty imagining giant robots sing).The second, subtler  story is the debunkment of the Cold War-era anti-Soviet (and anti-non-US in  general) propaganda, as Hogarth tries to conceal the fifty-foot-tall  behemoth, fails, and has a forceful, nosy agent (and eventually an entire  army) tracking his every move - naturally, the government is quite  displeased with the robot. This story, on the other hand, has quite a few  adult-oriented jokes (not, not in that sense). For example, Hogarth feeds a  laxative to the agent to stop him from following, and the duck-'n-cover  thing that recurs in the beginning and the finale. Both stories interweave  quite frequently, so a rather mature-minded child will have no difficulty  following the action.Finally, the film has a rather good ending (marred  only by the few last seconds that were obviously tacked on to stop the  younger audience from being too sad, although, if you're emotional enough,  you might appreciate it). The art is quite grand, and the frequent use of  perspective is very effective in conveying the giant's size.

First let me start off by saying that this is no &quot;Disney&quot; type movie. The cast doesn't all of a sudden break into a song every five minutes.

With the voices of Harry Connick, Jr., Jennifer Anniston, Vin Diesel, Christopher McDonald and Jon Mahoney you're bound to get something that has appeal for all ages.  True, the story might be appear to be a children's tale, but it also takes place in a time when the US was suspicious of anything and everything that appears foreign.  The Giant is definitely foreign.  It's also clueless about how to behave on earth.  That is until he meets Hogarth (who saves him from being electrocuted to death).  Hogarth's next priority was to teach the Giant more about human life and find a place to hide it.  A government agent soon comes to town asking about any strange occurences that might have happened recently.  When he discovers the truth, he is hell bent on destroying this thing (even at the cost of all the lives in a small town in Maine).  Does the town side with Hogarth or this agent?  What happens to the giant?  That's for you to find out ;).This film is a touching story of friendship, protection and loyalty.  We're naturally scared when we see something unfamiliar to us, but Hogarth sets aside his fear and saves the Giant from death in their first encounter.  The Giant begins to understand that it can't just go around eating and destroying everything in its way and trusts the boy to do the right thing and keep it safe.  Later on, and perhaps in the most touching part of the story, the Giant learns that friendship means protecting the ones we love.  And it does just that.I wish the film could have been longer and the DVD more feature-laden.  This DVD only includes a 30-minute, TV-aired special about the making of the film, some actor filmographies, and a trailer.I highly recommend this as a family film.

513751,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000028U3R,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[2, 3]","This wonderful animated classic is based on a children's book by the late British poet laureate, Ted Hughes (who drove two wives to suicide--Sylvia Plath and, six years later, Assia Welville, who also murdered her child). But neither kids nor the grown-ups who see this film need know about Hughes, or the Cold War, during which Hughes created this allegory to demonstrate the evil of war.Hughes gave his book's characters very little development. Hogarth, the boy who centers the movie, is the central character. But there's not much explanation (here, or in the book) about why he acts, or why anyone acts, for that matter.Nevertheless, the plot and fantastic cartoon art and music will draw kids and adults alike into this tangle of fantasy. The film, in a way, even reproduces some of the book's poetic language, in pictures.  Hughes wrote of the music of the spheres--the music that space made, a strange soft music, deep and weird, like millions of voices singing together. Here, the spheres come alive in the giant's body parts, and the beatnik artist who helps Hogarth.The Iron Giant came to the top of a cliff one night, no one knows how, why, or from where. The film also recreates the wind, which Hughes wrote, sang through his iron fingers, and his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin but big as a bedroom, slowly turned right, then slowly turned left. Down the cliff he fell, his iron legs, arms and ears breaking loose and falling off as he went. The pieces scattered, crashed, bumped, clanged down onto the rocky beach far below, where the sound of the sea chewed away at it, and the pieces of the Iron Giant lay scattered far and wide, silent and unmoving.The Giant eats metal, and ends up safe from government agents--for a time at least--in the local scrap yard, where he could eat tractors and cars to his heart's content.But the government agents are after the Giant, and eventually start a war by firing upon him. The film does not end the same way as the book, but it's fun, anyway.But one important point, for grown-ups at least, remains the same: In creating his 1968 Cold War space-bat-angel-dragon, the erstwhile pacifist poet Hughes also created a vision of evil incarnate--the kind of evil that wishes to engulf the entire world, that cannot be reasoned with, cannot be pacified and must be fought.

You could also draw comparisons with the relationship between characters John Conner and Schwarzenegger's 'Terminator'. The quality of animation is very high, with nice touches of CGI. The characters are both well-drawn and very well performed by a cast of fine actors. The script is incisive, fast-moving and sprinkled with lots of subtle and occasionally, suprisingly adult humor. And 'The Iron Giant' has a spectacular and dramatically pleasing climax that is neither too bleak nor too sentimental, which is always a delicate balance to reach.

This is something that I share with the people that I work with. A collection of artists and creative types, who share a love for our work and for fine pieces of animation.Few films can be defined as great, if not perfect. This film belongs on that list. Without any questions, arguments or debates. A friend of mine let me borrow this film on DVD format, and after viewing it, quickly went out and purchased my own copy. The animation, color palettes, storyline and characters made this film truly memorable. A fine balance of artistry, technology and storytelling, and at its center, the Iron Giant himself. This film stands out to me as a wonderful example of what can be done both artistically and humanistically. The story, like its characters, are of significant substance and value. Illustrating the need for humanity and compassion both in the arts and life itself. For the Iron Giant himself illustrates the warmth and &quot;human&quot; love that is needed from all of us.

Then he hears some funny  noises, so he goes investigating and thus runs smack into the most unlikely  friend he would ever make: a towering robot who could gobble up cars and  flatten entire forest areas.

And along comes a  sharp-nosed detective who is sniffing suspiciously for any clues to the  strange happenings in the small Maine town.

A meteor streaks to Earth from somewhere unknown and strange things soon start happening near the town of Rockwell as tales of outer space invaders begin to circulate. During an evening alone, a bright young boy, Hogarth Hughes decides to take in some guilty pleasures, such as snacks and a monster movie, when the TV goes out unexpectedly. When he climbs to the roof, he finds the antenna bitten off, and that's only the beginning. When he ventures alone into the woods, he discovers a huge metal creature attacking a power station seeking the metal for food. When it gets caught in the power lines, Hogarth at first flees out of terror, but regains his courage and returns to help by shutting down the power. It is then that his curiosity gets the better of him and at first, he seeks to get some pictures of the giant, only to find that the giant literally after him. After he stumbles and falls, he discovers the giant actually wants to be friendly and Hogarth eagerly obliges by teaching him about his surroundings-- and by hiding him from an overzealous government agent who wants to find and destroy him, deeming him a military threat, engaging in a battle of wits to do so.

The video quality is superb.  The image  is sharp and the colors are true.  This is especially appreciated when  viewing some of the more spectacular animated sequences, such as the storm  at sea at the very beginning of the film, or the combat scenes near the  end.  Contrary to the reviewer who said the sound is inadequate, the  package states that the movie is recorded in Dolby Digital Surround 5.1,  and my player also stated that it was playing AC-3 sound when queried.  My  ears heard sound from all six speakers, and the sound is very nicely done.  There are many quiet scenes in the story, but when full blown sound is  called for, it is there.  There are not a lot of extras on this disk, but  it is better supplied than most family films.  For some reason, the studios  have decided that those who buy family oriented movies are not interested  in the additional features that other DVDs provide.  This disk does include  a trailer (see for yourself if Warner botched the advertising for this film  or just released it at a bad time), bios and filmographies of the cast, and  a -Making of- documentary.  The latter was apparently made for television  and shown prior to the release of the movie to build interest.  It contains  clips of interviews with the cast and director and not much else.  There is  really little about the actual production of the movie.  The disk also  contains some DVD-ROM material but this is also rather limited.  Please  note that I don't consider interactive menus and scene access to be special  features, they are, or should be, standard features of all DVDs.  All  though these extras are limited, they are far more than commonly found on  DVDs intended for a comparible market.  The only really negative thing I  can offer about the DVD version of The Iron Giant is that it is packaged in  the cheap and shabby cardboard Snap case that Warner insists on using.

513775,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B000028U3R,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","There's a scene approximately midway through The Iron Giant in which young Hogarth Hughes finds himself trying to explain death to his new friend, a giant metal robot from outer space.  ""Things die. That's part of life. It's bad to kill, but it's not bad to die,"" he tells the giant after they witness a deer shot by hunters.  That's a pretty heavy statement for what appears to be a kid friendly animated film, but The Iron Giant is anything but a mere children's film.  It's a surprisingly moving story about friendhsip and loyalty with additional subtext regarding such ""grown up"" issues as patriotism, intolerance, fear and our gun culture.  Yet at its big, beating heart the film remains an engrossing adventure story that will resonate with viewers of all ages.Director Brad Bird's tale is set in a small town in Maine in the mid 50's during the height of the cold war which is no mistake since it provides the perfect backdrop for a culture of fear and misunderstanding to percolate.  It is into this tiny, rural community that a massive robotic creature crashes from space.  What is he?  Where is he from?  Those are questions that are left up to the viewer to decide.  The giant is befriended by young Hogarth, an inqisitive boy who teaches him what it means to be human, to have a soul and to do a cannonball into a lake, although not necessarily in that order.  Hogarth decides to keep his friend a secret from the townsfolk since he knows that they will react out of fear.  His plan gets derailed when special FBI agent Kent Mansley arrives in town to investigate the incident and decides to expose and destroy the giant.  Mansley claims to be acting in the interest of national security, but it is clear that he is trying to make a name for himself and further his career by taking advantage of tensions between the U.S and Russia as well as by playing the patriotism card.  As events escalate to a showdown between the giant and the military, the film also invites viewers to consider the shoot first/ask questions later mentality that seems to be a result of America's love affair with guns.But politics aside, The Iron Giant is a fun and fast paced story that is ultimately about the friendship between a young boy and a misunderstood creature from another world.

513776,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000028U3R,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 4]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***Friendship. Love. Respect. Growing up. These are the themes that run throughout THE IRON GIANT, an Oscar Award winning animated film from 1999. Kids films without substance are very familiar to most parents, but The Iron Giant harkens back to a time when family and friendship meant everything.Although unusual in the sense that a boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) befriends an alien robot simply called The Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel,Find Me Guilty), this animated feature still teaches kids the responsibilities of friendship and how devastating it can be to lose one.The set-up is common in that we see the military and government agents as bumbling morons who misunderstand the intentions of something as large and as powerful as a nearly indestructible robot. But understanding eventually reaches them, too, through the actions of Hogarth and his new alien buddy.More interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers ...as well as a fatal ending (sort of). Parents should be prepared to comfort their kids when The Iron Robot launches himself into space in preparation to save his best friend (Hogarth). The words ""Superman"" are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words.But there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones. Watching fellow humans complain to the local constabulary about suddenly absent mouthfuls of trucks, towers, and other metal munchables is pretty comical, as is a great scene where The Iron Giant does a cannonball jump into a favorite swimming hole of Hogarth's.A fun and serious film with themes that most parents will find a positive influence on the pliable minds of their young ones.",4,Friendship.

To animation geeks, he did the Family Dog segment from Spielberg's Amazing Stories and he was a creative consultant/director on Simpsons. In the middle though he wrote/directed the Iron Giant, which Warner Brothers had no idea how to market and the film bombed in the box office, not even making its budget back. However the film became incredibly popular afterwards and there's even a 24-hour marathon of the film played every year.Hogarth and his mom Annie are living on their own in the 1950's. One night during a storm, something from space crash lands in the ocean and makes its way to a port town in the forest. Turns out it's a giant robot that Hogarth finds and befriends, teaching him how to speak(kinda) and teaching him some lessons. These lessons will need to be used since a government agent named Mansley is after it and sure that it's a destructive thing, which it might be.Looking at the Iron Giant, it's easy to tell how Warner Brothers messed up its marketing: it's hard to label the film. The film's animated so it automatically would be kid friendly but it's not something that kids will find funny and colorful since there's no songs and there's no comic relief talking donkeys. It's a more mature story that happens to be animated so most adults will probably bypass it. But it's the themes that will appeal to everyone whether they're too ""macho"" or they're not young enough to understand it.What makes the film work is the film's heart and its tone. It never panders to the audience and tries to make it too sympathetic(which plagues a lot of this Oscar wannabe films) and it's likable without being dull. It's also got a great ending which gives you a sense of closure without being a cop-out saccharine ending. The animation isn't as top notch as the CG features but you don't ever care since it's very well done and considering the budget they had and the amount of time, you're surprised by how much bad shots you're least likely to find.Story and characters are important and the story's great enough but the characters shine through as well. Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Christopher McDonald, Eli Marienthal(previously known as Stifler's brother in American Pie) both give exceptional performances, as well as Vin Diesel who gives a likability to the titular giant with a deep voice without being James Earl Jones style deep.If you're a fan of the Incredibles, you'll see Brad Bird's 2nd feature was the obvious talent still left over from Iron Giant and you owe it to yourself to watch this.",5,Criminally overlooked,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2630,"['lot', 'people', 'know', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'name', 'now', 'Pixar', '6th', 'film', 'directed', 'Incredibles', 'animation', 'geeks', 'did', 'Family', 'Dog', 'segment', 'Spielberg', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'was', 'creative', 'consultant/director', 'Simpsons', 'middle', 'wrote/directed', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'market', 'film', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'even', 'making', 'budget', 'back', 'However', 'film', 'became', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'afterwards', 'even', '24-hour', 'marathon', 'film', 'played', 'year.Hogarth', 'mom', 'Annie', 'are', 'living', 'own', '1950', 'One', 'night', 'storm', 'something', 'space', 'crash', 'lands', 'ocean', 'way', 'port', 'town', 'forest', 'out', 'giant', 'robot', 'Hogarth', 'teaching', 'how', 'speak', 'kinda', 'teaching', 'lessons', 'lessons', 'will', 'need', 'be', 'used', 'government', 'agent', 'named', 'Mansley', 'sure', 'destructive', 'thing', 'might', 'be.Looking', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'easy', 'tell', 'how', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'messed', 'up', 'marketing', 'hard', 'label', 'film', 'film', 'animated', 'automatically', 'would', 'be', 'kid', 'friendly', 'not', 'something', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'funny', 'colorful', 'songs', 'comic', 'relief', 'talking', 'donkeys', 'more', 'mature', 'story', 'be', 'animated', 'so', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'probably', 'bypass', 'themes', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'too', 'macho', ""'re"", 'not', 'young', 'enough', 'understand', 'film', 'work', 'film', 'heart', 'tone', 'never', 'audience', 'tries', 'make', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'lot', 'Oscar', 'wannabe', 'films', 'likable', 'being', 'dull', 'also', 'got', 'great', 'ending', 'sense', 'closure', 'being', 'cop-out', 'saccharine', 'ending', 'animation', ""n't"", 'top', 'notch', 'CG', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'care', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'budget', 'had', 'amount', 'time', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'bad', 'shots', ""'re"", 'least', 'likely', 'find.Story', 'characters', 'are', 'important', 'story', 'great', 'enough', 'characters', 'shine', 'as', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'previously', 'known', 'Stifler', 'brother', 'American', 'Pie', 'give', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'who', 'likability', 'titular', 'giant', 'deep', 'voice', 'being', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'style', 'deep.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Incredibles', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Brad', 'Bird', '2nd', 'feature', 'was', 'obvious', 'talent', 'still', 'left', 'over', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'owe', 'watch']",The Iron Giant

Based on the 1968 children's book, The Giant: A Story in Five Nights, by late British poet Ted Hughes, The Iron Giant refuses to rely on musical numbers and simplify its message in an obvious appeal to kids. It is one of those rare animated films that both adults and kids can appreciate. It is also a nostalgic ode to the '50s that is thought-provoking and entertaining.There are brief biographies and filmographies for the cast and crew.Also included is an audio commentary by director Brad Bird, head of animation Tony Fucile, story development head Jeff Lynch and animation supervisor Steven Markowski. They talk about the challenges of realizing their ambitious ideas with a limited budget and time constraints. This is a very informative, if slightly technical track.There are eight additional scenes with introductions by Bird that total 18 minutes. This includes an original opening sequence that was longer and too elaborate.""Teddy Newton `The X-Factor'"" is a five-minute look at storyboard artist, Newton. He's a creative guy who drew up boards for the movie and talks over some of his drawings, including scene that featured a date between Dean and Hogarth's mom in Canada.""Duck and Cover Sequence"" features Newton again as he talks about the creation of the old educational film that Hogarth and his class watch.""The Voice of the Giant"" features footage from the original featurette on the first DVD version of this movie. It briefly examines Vin Diesel's work on The Iron Giant.""Behind the Armor"" allows you to watch the movie and at certain points access behind-the-scenes footage for a particular scene.""Motion Gallery"" is a four-minute reel of rough drawings, artwork and storyboards juxtaposed with the finished film.Finally, there are two trailers for the movie.Missing in action from the first DVD is the music video for ""Cha-Hua-Hua"" by Eddie Platt and the 22-minute Making Of featurette (some of it has been absorbed into the new extras) but they aren't really missed with all of these new, more substantial extras.The Iron Giant is one of those rare animated films that not only appeals to both children and adults; it does not contain one annoying musical number. It is also refuses to serve as one long, obvious advertisement for a toy. In fact, this film is an entertaining, even touching story about tolerance and compassion. It deals with real issues like death and bigotry-pretty heavy topics for a children's animated film-in an honest and heartfelt way. From all indications, The Iron Giant was clearly a labour of love for those involved and this translates into an enjoyable film for everyone to enjoy.",5,An animation classic for our times,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,2758,"['When', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'flew', 'face', 'current', 'trend', 'popularized', 'Disney', 'animated', 'musicals', 'Based', '1968', 'children', 'book', 'Giant', 'Story', 'Five', 'Nights', 'late', 'British', 'poet', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'rely', 'musical', 'numbers', 'simplify', 'message', 'obvious', 'appeal', 'kids', 'one', 'rare', 'animated', 'films', 'adults', 'kids', 'can', 'appreciate', 'also', 'nostalgic', 'ode', ""'50s"", 'thought-provoking', 'are', 'brief', 'biographies', 'filmographies', 'cast', 'crew.Also', 'included', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'head', 'animation', 'Tony', 'Fucile', 'story', 'development', 'head', 'Jeff', 'Lynch', 'animation', 'supervisor', 'Steven', 'Markowski', 'talk', 'challenges', 'realizing', 'ambitious', 'ideas', 'limited', 'budget', 'time', 'constraints', 'very', 'informative', 'slightly', 'technical', 'are', 'eight', 'additional', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'Bird', 'total', '18', 'minutes', 'original', 'opening', 'sequence', 'was', 'longer', 'too', 'elaborate', 'Teddy', 'Newton', 'X-Factor', 'five-minute', 'look', 'storyboard', 'artist', 'Newton', 'creative', 'guy', 'who', 'drew', 'up', 'boards', 'movie', 'talks', 'drawings', 'including', 'scene', 'featured', 'date', 'Dean', 'Hogarth', 'mom', 'Canada', 'Duck', 'Cover', 'Sequence', 'Newton', 'again', 'creation', 'old', 'educational', 'film', 'Hogarth', 'class', 'watch', 'Voice', 'Giant', 'footage', 'original', 'featurette', 'first', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'briefly', 'examines', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'work', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Armor', 'watch', 'movie', 'certain', 'points', 'access', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'particular', 'scene', 'Motion', 'Gallery', 'four-minute', 'reel', 'rough', 'drawings', 'artwork', 'storyboards', 'juxtaposed', 'finished', 'film.Finally', 'are', 'two', 'trailers', 'movie.Missing', 'action', 'first', 'DVD', 'music', 'video', 'Cha-Hua-Hua', 'Eddie', 'Platt', '22-minute', 'Making', 'featurette', 'been', 'absorbed', 'new', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'missed', 'new', 'more', 'substantial', 'extras.The', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'one', 'rare', 'animated', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'appeals', 'children', 'adults', 'not', 'contain', 'one', 'annoying', 'musical', 'number', 'also', 'serve', 'one', 'long', 'obvious', 'advertisement', 'toy', 'fact', 'film', 'entertaining', 'even', 'touching', 'story', 'tolerance', 'compassion', 'real', 'issues', 'death', 'bigotry-pretty', 'heavy', 'topics', 'children', 'animated', 'film-in', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'way', 'indications', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'was', 'clearly', 'labour', 'love', 'involved', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'everyone', 'enjoy']",The Iron Giant

While it may not have the glitzy look and feel of a Disney film, this Warner Brothers animated movie is of the highest caliber.  The Iron Giant has a heart and a natural home-spun appeal that make it a great film for children as well as adults.  Disney animated films always have a distinctly Disney aura to them, but The Iron Giant disavows artificiality to the extent that it almost seems too natural to be a movie.  The animation is solid and impressive without any over-the-top or flashy sequences, the voice acting (featuring the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Christopher McDonald, Eli Marienthal, and Vin Diesel) is quite good, and the story is both entertaining and heart-warming, imparting some important lessons about life without ever becoming the least bit preachy.It is 1957, and the Soviets have just launched Sputnik, giving rise to a sense of concern to the American people and its government.  Thus, when something foreign tears through the atmosphere and hits the water some few miles off the coast of Maine, the government wants to know what this mysterious object is.  Before government agent Kent Mansley arrives to investigate, though, young Hogarth Hughes has made first contact with what turns out to be a huge metal robot.  The giant is child-like in terms of adapting to life on earth and does not seem to remember where it originally came from, but the lad soon makes friends with him and teaches him many of the things a parent would teach his own child.  The giant gets a poignant and sad bird's-eye view of death, reinforcing its seemingly innate hatred of guns, and has little trouble developing a moral philosophy of goodness, choosing to mimic Superman rather than the evil robot Atomo.  As sometimes happens in this world, though, the giant's goodness is met with fright, paranoia, and panic on the part of society, and Hogarth is only able to hide his gigantic new friend from the world for so long.  The initially somewhat goofy but ultimately detestable agent Mansley sees to it that the army does everything in its power to destroy the gentle giant.  He fears the giant simply because it is alien and different, never making the first attempt to understand or communicate with it.  As might be expected, the giant eventually has to prove himself in a way that will convince even those who fear him of his kind and generous soul.  In essence, the giant becomes the most human character in the film.I have to say that there are a couple of pretty sad scenes in the film, but the hard lessons of life are presented in such a way as to be more empowering than frightening to the most sensitive of viewers.  By and large, the movie is humorous on a number of levels, exuding obvious appeal to young and old alike.

While there is plenty here for them, there is also an abundance of witty dialogue and comic situations that adults should love as well.  My one and only complaint comes from an early moment in the film when  the Iron Giant gets tangled in a mess of electrical wires, the current still surging through them.  Hogarth saves the robot, thus making a friend of him, by pulling down on a huge ""on/off"" switch at the town's power station.  I could not imagine how many vandals and delinquents would love to see that kind of switch, with the words ""on"" and ""off"" clearly printed in large colored letters, in the middle of a heavily wooded area with maximum concealment.  That plot discrepency laid aside, the rest of the film flows without flaw, and it pains me to point out the one and only part which just didn't make any sense.  I do realize this is a story about a giant robot from outer space, so I will let it slide (note the 5-star-rating).  The mixture of classic-style animation and computer animation melds surprisingly well, and is both inventive and extraordinary.

Brad Bird, 1999, 86 minutes, based on the kids' bookIron Manby Ted Hughes) is a buoyant, delightful, deceptively simple cartoon about a boy (Hogarth, voiced by a brilliant Eli Marienthal) who, in the late 1950s, befriends an iron giant (voiced by Vin Diesel, and I think this is Vin's film debut).This alien robot, it transpires, is a sophisticated weapon that was sent here either erroneously or due to atomic activity on earth. But the boy convinces the giant that he is not a weapon (""not a gun"" as they say) - and teaches him to reach for the stars instead of being a 100-foot-tall spark plug.The animation and characters, the judicious use of computerized technology, the sophisticated humor yet works for the whole family, all perfect and the script could have been done at a billion dollar budget live-action. I've always held Brad Bird in a vital place in my heart, but in this film Bird totally outdoes even himself. My wife loves this film almost to the point of tears; as much as my late mother lovedE.T., The Extra-Terrestrial.Aside from the stunning look of an old Disney-level animated film, which this of course has even better than Disney, there is a crisp, no-vertigo kind of animation here that shows LOVE. All I can tell you is, any film that shows that much love is automatically the best there is. E.T. among a small handful of ""children's"" films have that quality also.About Brad Bird I have to say this: he seems to do too little in the way of these animated cartoons. I realize he's ""in rotation"" with other directors, but I think we should consider his track record: he has given us the screenplay for*Batteries Not Included(the oldest major thing of his I can find); he has madeThe Incredibleswhich has yet to be matched by anyone;Ratatouillewhich was in my opinion a sinister misuse of his talents;Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol - Extended Previewupon which I shall remain silent;Up(a splendid companion to THE INCREDIBLES, see my review); andBrave(see my review).Considering all that, isn't it time we got a little more Bird and a little less, well, bird poop from Pixar? Admittedly, there's very little poop from Pixar, which we ought to cherish more than ever ... but I'd still enjoy a LOT more Brad Bird. We need the likes of him especially now. I hate seeing that he's only given us a few films from either side of 9/11 and people need this kind of thing to bring them back to a happier state.With the additional talents of John Mahoney, Harry Connick, Jr., and Jennifer Aniston.",5,"This Iron Man is fun, smart and beautiful",1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,2536,"['IRON', 'GIANT', 'Dir', 'Brad', 'Bird', '1999', '86', 'minutes', 'based', 'kids', 'bookIron', 'Manby', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'buoyant', 'delightful', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'cartoon', 'boy', 'Hogarth', 'voiced', 'brilliant', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'who', 'late', '1950s', 'iron', 'giant', 'voiced', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'think', 'Vin', 'film', 'debut', 'alien', 'robot', 'sophisticated', 'weapon', 'was', 'sent', 'here', 'either', 'erroneously', 'due', 'atomic', 'activity', 'earth', 'boy', 'giant', 'not', 'weapon', 'not', 'gun', 'say', 'reach', 'stars', 'instead', 'being', '100-foot-tall', 'spark', 'plug.The', 'animation', 'characters', 'judicious', 'use', 'computerized', 'technology', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'yet', 'whole', 'family', 'perfect', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'billion', 'dollar', 'budget', 'live-action', ""'ve"", 'always', 'held', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'vital', 'place', 'heart', 'film', 'Bird', 'totally', 'even', 'wife', 'film', 'almost', 'point', 'tears', 'as', 'much', 'late', 'mother', 'lovedE.T.', 'Extra-Terrestrial.Aside', 'stunning', 'look', 'old', 'Disney-level', 'animated', 'film', 'course', 'even', 'better', 'Disney', 'crisp', 'no-vertigo', 'kind', 'animation', 'here', 'LOVE', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'much', 'love', 'automatically', 'best', 'E.T', 'small', 'handful', 'children', 'films', 'have', 'quality', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'too', 'little', 'way', 'animated', 'cartoons', 'realize', 'rotation', 'other', 'directors', 'think', 'should', 'consider', 'track', 'record', 'given', 'screenplay', 'Not', 'Included', 'oldest', 'major', 'thing', 'can', 'find', 'madeThe', 'Incredibleswhich', 'yet', 'be', 'matched', 'anyone', 'Ratatouillewhich', 'was', 'opinion', 'sinister', 'misuse', 'talents', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'Extended', 'Previewupon', 'shall', 'remain', 'silent', 'Up', 'splendid', 'companion', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLES', 'see', 'review', 'andBrave', 'see', 'review', '.Considering', ""n't"", 'time', 'got', 'little', 'more', 'Bird', 'little', 'less', 'well', 'bird', 'poop', 'Pixar', 'Admittedly', 'very', 'little', 'poop', 'Pixar', 'ought', 'cherish', 'more', 'ever', ""'d"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'LOT', 'more', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'need', 'likes', 'especially', 'now', 'hate', 'seeing', 'only', 'given', 'few', 'films', 'side', '9/11', 'people', 'need', 'kind', 'thing', 'bring', 'back', 'happier', 'additional', 'talents', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston']",The Iron Giant

His single mom works as a waitress, so Hogarth is pretty much on his own until an adventure leads him to discover a giant robot that happens to have no idea why he is there.  What he is? Where did he come from? What is his mission?  Such questions are thrown to the back as Hogarth makes his first real friend and is lead on a myriad of further adventures.  As for the Giant, does his purpose matter in comparison to what he wants for himself?These themes are explored through some truly three-dimensional characters: Hogarth's mom (voiced wonderfully by the lovely Jennifer Aniston), a local junk artist/beatnik, a villainous government agent sent to see what all the fuss is.This movie is an emotional and animation gem that is so underappreciated it's not funny.",5,This was so ignored in theatres...,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,1343,"['fell', 'love', 'precocious', 'little', 'boy', 'iron', 'alien', 'friend', 'first', 'time', 'family', 'saw', 'theatres', 'So', 'course', 'had', 'have', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'bought', 'cheaply', 'odd', 'reason', 'uncultured', 'masses', 'have', 'appreciation', 'story.Trust', 'Pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'enjoy', 'one', 'most', 'magical', 'movies', 'come', 'along', 'while.Set', 'Cold', 'War', 'story', 'young', 'Hogarth', 'Hughes', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'cursed', 'awful', 'name', 'gifted', 'mind', 'popped', 'older', 'grade', 'where', 'tormented', 'bullies', 'single', 'mom', 'waitress', 'so', 'Hogarth', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'adventure', 'discover', 'giant', 'robot', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'there', 'What', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'What', 'mission', 'Such', 'questions', 'are', 'thrown', 'back', 'Hogarth', 'first', 'real', 'friend', 'lead', 'myriad', 'further', 'adventures', 'Giant', 'purpose', 'matter', 'comparison', 'what', 'themes', 'are', 'explored', 'truly', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'Hogarth', 'mom', 'voiced', 'wonderfully', 'lovely', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'local', 'junk', 'artist/beatnik', 'villainous', 'government', 'agent', 'sent', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'is.This', 'movie', 'emotional', 'animation', 'gem', 'so', 'underappreciated', 'not', 'funny']",The Iron Giant

It also shows us why it is good to have major studios taking serious interest in feature-length  animation. The WB made big strides (no pun intended) in blending  traditional cel animation with CGI. It's possible to see where CGI is used,  but it no longer stands out glaringly on the screen, making for a much  smoother viewing. Disney is good, but they SHOULD take this movie as an  object lesson in how to present a story honestly. The adaptation of the Ted  Hughes novel is proof that it isn't too hard to adapt a novel without  destroying it's message. It's a shame that Hughes died before seeing how  many people his story reached in this form. Incidentally, the biggest fan  of this story would have to be it's executive producer, Pete Townshend  (yes, THAT Pete Towshend), who was so affected by the story that he adapted  an early stage version of the story into a pop musical in 1989, The Iron  Man.

My son rented this when he was 3.5 years old and asked for it so often we finally bought it for him. Just this evening we watched it for the zillionth time, with him entranced, and me (again) marvelling over the attention to minute details, the fully-fleshed out plots and sub plots, and the great voice talent.&quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is the story of Hogarth, growing up in the 1950s with a single, hard working mother. It is the era of Sputnik, &quot;duck and cover&quot; movies, and bad sci-fi movies. Hogarth is an outcast poindexter in school and a wild, imaginative handful at home. He befriends the Iron Giant after discovering that he's a good guy who won't hurt him. Of course, it's up to Hogarth to prove that to all of America.Each time I watch this I notice something different. Sure, there are the obvious jokes. But there are subtler touches in the story (the Cold War sub-plot issues are great) and animation (just watch how the Iron Giant imitates how Hogarth sits down) that take this way beyond any of the recent Disney movies. Even the &quot;big name&quot; star Jennifer Aniston stands out in her understated and wonderful rendering of a concerned, tired, sweet mother. Harry Connick Jr.'s character (an art building  beatnik) is fantastic with deep-set eyes and constant six o'clock shadow.Appropriate for young kids and a *must* see.",5,The Best Way to Spend Your Money,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,1475,"['quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'become', 'instant', 'classic', 'family', 'two', '30-year', 'old', 'parents', 'four-year', 'old', 'son', 'rented', 'when', 'was', '3.5', 'years', 'old', 'asked', 'so', 'often', 'finally', 'bought', 'Just', 'evening', 'watched', 'zillionth', 'time', 'entranced', 'again', 'marvelling', 'attention', 'minute', 'details', 'fully-fleshed', 'plots', 'sub', 'plots', 'great', 'voice', 'talent.', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'story', 'Hogarth', 'growing', 'up', '1950s', 'single', 'hard', 'working', 'mother', 'era', 'Sputnik', 'quot', 'duck', 'cover', 'quot', 'movies', 'bad', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'Hogarth', 'outcast', 'poindexter', 'school', 'wild', 'imaginative', 'handful', 'home', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'discovering', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'course', 'up', 'Hogarth', 'prove', 'America.Each', 'time', 'watch', 'notice', 'something', 'different', 'Sure', 'are', 'obvious', 'jokes', 'are', 'subtler', 'touches', 'story', 'Cold', 'War', 'sub-plot', 'issues', 'are', 'great', 'animation', 'just', 'watch', 'how', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'how', 'Hogarth', 'sits', 'down', 'take', 'way', 'recent', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Even', 'quot', 'big', 'name', 'quot', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'out', 'understated', 'wonderful', 'rendering', 'concerned', 'tired', 'sweet', 'mother', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'character', 'art', 'building', 'beatnik', 'fantastic', 'deep-set', 'eyes', 'constant', 'six', ""o'clock"", 'shadow.Appropriate', 'young', 'kids', '*must*', 'see']",The Iron Giant

I can't remember the last time I was drawn to a film in the way I was drawn to THE IRON GIANT. I ended up seeing this film 10 times in theatres over a two-month period. The film's trailer initially brought it to my attention. After I saw THE IRON GIANT on opening day, I had to see again and again and so fourth. Needless to say, I liked the film very much. I consider it one of my favorite films. Why? That is not an easy answer. All I can say is that I genuinely consider this to be a GOOD film and it has some enigmatic heartfelt intrinsic value to many that see it. It is not just a kid's film. It is not just a family film. It is a film for everyone. After my second or third viewing in theatres, I became interested in the audience's reactions. There was always a cheer or a sniffle or a shed tear rolling down a cheek. I remember one father saying to a gang of kids when the movie was over, ""That was a good one. We should have taken mommy with us."" I thought I was alone in my reaction to this film. After I got hooked up to the Internet, I found that there were literally thousands of people who were also moved by this film. And it seems that we all repeated one act of endorsement: we told as many people as we could to go see THE IRON GIANT. The closest I can come to saying why I liked THE IRON GIANT is that it somehow made me reflect on my life's experiences in a very nostalgic and endearing way, yet it did not let me forget that we still grow and learn new experiences every new day.

But what really made this work were the issues discussed within the film along with the film's time period. For a ""kid movie"" (I use that somewhat lightly), The Iron Giant talks about death, complex and difficult choices, and our sometimes xenophobic tendencies.Yes, this is still a kid movie at heart, but that doesn't mean that there's not plenty for adults to enjoy as well. The humor was well presented without dumbing it down for the 5yr old crowd. The story has a logical flow, the animation was well done, and there is genuine emotion witnessed before us.As for whether or not the content is suitable for kids in the first place (I've read plenty of bickering within the reviews section regarding this), I'll leave that up to your own parental judgment. Just keep in mind that this is a kid movie that challenges kids to think and ask questions about issues that MAY be complex to children.

Some of the enthusiasm is justified--the animation is quite impressive and the story appealing--but the movie does not work as well as its defenders would have one believe.The biggest problem with The Iron Giant lies with the fact that the entire movie feels like a less-witty animated remake of E.T.  Think about it--lonely boy from a fatherless home stumbles upon a sweet and gentle creature from another world and bonds with the strange being, ultimately facing off against government agents who want the creature for their own purposes.  While obviously some details differ, the movie has the feel of something we've seen before.  Additionally, though set in the 1950s the movie never really gets the details of the era right.  Cold War paranoia is fairly easy to drum up, but almost every character (especially the poorly-essayed main character and the psuedo-Beatnik) sounds as if he or she was lifted from the 1990s.All things considered, The Iron Giant is probably not a waste of time or money, but it is also not the brilliant work of cinema that many of its supporters claim it to be.",3,Acceptable animated fare but little more,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,1236,"['Perhaps', 'part', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'developed', 'quite', 'cult', 'recent', 'years', 'enthusiasm', 'justified', 'animation', 'quite', 'impressive', 'story', 'appealing', 'movie', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'defenders', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'believe.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'fact', 'entire', 'movie', 'feels', 'less-witty', 'animated', 'remake', 'E.T', 'Think', 'lonely', 'boy', 'fatherless', 'home', 'stumbles', 'sweet', 'gentle', 'creature', 'world', 'bonds', 'strange', 'being', 'ultimately', 'facing', 'off', 'government', 'agents', 'who', 'want', 'creature', 'own', 'purposes', 'obviously', 'details', 'differ', 'movie', 'feel', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Additionally', 'though', 'set', '1950s', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'details', 'era', 'right', 'Cold', 'War', 'paranoia', 'fairly', 'easy', 'drum', 'up', 'almost', 'character', 'especially', 'poorly-essayed', 'main', 'character', 'psuedo-Beatnik', 'was', 'lifted', '1990s.All', 'things', 'considered', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'probably', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'also', 'not', 'brilliant', 'work', 'cinema', 'many', 'supporters', 'claim', 'be']",The Iron Giant

We hopped in my car and went and  saw this movie. We both walked out of there choked up with smiles on our  faces. I can honestly say that the movie rekindled that sense of wonder we  all have as children. This isn't some saccharine-Hollywood-hype quote, but  a genuine description of my emotions. When the Giant picks up Hogarth in  his hand, you get that rush of childhood that you thought dies when you get  older. This movie doesn't pander to little kids, but entertains them even  more than the lesser Disney films. Is it just me, or are the older Disney  films better than new ones? The film is deep and involving and will have  you glued to the screen. The film comments on the time period (1950's) with  a wink to the older, wiser adults. The voices are perfect. Harry Connick,  Jr. steals the show as the beatnik artist Dean and Eli Marenthal (Hogarth  Hughes) is great because his emotions are genuine and well voiced. Kudos to  Brad Bird for not making Hogarth some smart alec punk with  &quot;attitude&quot;. The kid is an outsider with a huge heart. It's  because of these attributes everyone feels for him at the end. The other  character so richly drawn is the Giant. He is more three-dimensional than  most characters in live films. It's scary folks, but it's true. I don't  want to give away the plot so I won't write much more about it. The  plotline is beautiful and flows from one scene to the next. It's too much  fun to reveal it here. Now for some info about the disc. The picture is  superb and the audio is excellent. It has a few features including the  &quot;Making of...&quot; and a music video, but they are secondary to the  beautiful artwork so abundantly present in this wonderful piece of work.

I can not watch the ending of this film without getting a  tear in my eye. If all of us would only learn this one lesson, the world  would be a more pleasant place to live.It took two viewings to really  get all the subtle meanings of some of the scenes. I urge parents to  discuss with their children the message of this movie with their kids. Let  them know it is their choice whether to be &quot;a gun&quot; or  &quot;Superman.&quot; Maybe in some small way this movie can help them to  make the right choice.Don't get me wrong, this is not a preachy movie. I  hate that.

513857,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B000028U3R,"JJD ""John""","[1, 1]","In 1999, in the midst of a summer movie season that included Star Wars: Episode One (gag), The Sixth Sense, and Disney's Tarzan, the people at Warner Bros. made a critical error in marketing and released one of the finest animated films in history to little or no fanfare. It's poor box office reception is a direct result. However, poor box office is not a tell tale sign of a film's greatness. History is replete with film classics that performed poorly (The Shawshank Redemption, Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, and A Christmas Story to name a few classics that fall under this category).Based on a book by Ted Hughes and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Family Dog), The Iron Giant is among the rarest of modern animated films as it's heart is at the very core of the film. It is earnest and moving in a way that isn't force fed and emotes without the typical ""tugging on the heart string"" devices.It's the story of Hogarth Hughes, who lives with his single Mom in Maine of the late Fifties. The cold war is in full swing and McCarthy era paranoia is rampant.Enter the Giant...Crash landed, damaged (or wounded), and alone, the Giant makes his way through the Maine country side eating cars and other scraps of metal. He's lost, alone, and hungry. He's the epitome of a ""stranger in a strange land"". It is in the midst of his misadventures that he finds himself in a spot of trouble when tangled up in the cables of the local powerplant. Hogarth, although frightened, frees the Giant and it's not long before they develop a strong bond of friendship.Their troubles come in the form of Special Agent Kent Mansley (masterfully voiced by Christopher McDonald), who is brought to town to investigate the sightings of the ""metal man"". Riddled with misguided patriotism and McCarthy like ignorance, he sets out on a mission to find the Giant and take it down, no matter the cost.The basic subtext of the film is the love between a boy and a weapon with a heart. The Giant learns about the ills of violence in a way that isn't overbearing or preachy...but powerful and incredibly well written.The voice talents include Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr., among others. In my opinion, this film ranks right up there among anything Disney has ever offered and far superior than anything Dreamworks has ever done. It is a SOLID story and it is near impossible to walk away unmoved. In all honesty, I can't watch it without a lump in my throat at certain points.Incredibly powerful, funny, moving, and just plain wonderful.",5,"Easily among the best animated films of all time, if not THE best.",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2532,"['1999', 'midst', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', 'included', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'One', 'gag', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Disney', 'Tarzan', 'people', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'made', 'critical', 'error', 'marketing', 'released', 'one', 'finest', 'animated', 'films', 'history', 'little', 'fanfare', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'reception', 'direct', 'result', 'However', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'tell', 'tale', 'sign', 'film', 'greatness', 'History', 'replete', 'film', 'classics', 'performed', 'poorly', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'name', 'few', 'classics', 'fall', 'category', '.Based', 'book', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'directed', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Incredibles', 'Family', 'Dog', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'rarest', 'modern', 'animated', 'films', 'heart', 'very', 'core', 'film', 'earnest', 'moving', 'way', ""n't"", 'force', 'fed', 'emotes', 'typical', 'tugging', 'heart', 'string', 'devices.It', 'story', 'Hogarth', 'Hughes', 'who', 'single', 'Mom', 'Maine', 'late', 'Fifties', 'cold', 'war', 'full', 'swing', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'paranoia', 'rampant.Enter', 'Giant', 'Crash', 'landed', 'damaged', 'wounded', 'alone', 'Giant', 'way', 'Maine', 'country', 'side', 'eating', 'cars', 'other', 'scraps', 'metal', 'lost', 'alone', 'hungry', 'epitome', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'midst', 'misadventures', 'spot', 'trouble', 'when', 'tangled', 'up', 'cables', 'local', 'powerplant', 'Hogarth', 'frightened', 'Giant', 'not', 'long', 'develop', 'strong', 'bond', 'friendship.Their', 'troubles', 'come', 'form', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Kent', 'Mansley', 'masterfully', 'voiced', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'who', 'brought', 'town', 'investigate', 'sightings', 'metal', 'man', 'Riddled', 'misguided', 'patriotism', 'McCarthy', 'ignorance', 'out', 'mission', 'find', 'Giant', 'take', 'down', 'matter', 'cost.The', 'basic', 'subtext', 'film', 'love', 'boy', 'weapon', 'heart', 'Giant', 'ills', 'violence', 'way', ""n't"", 'overbearing', 'preachy', 'powerful', 'incredibly', 'well', 'written.The', 'voice', 'talents', 'include', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'others', 'opinion', 'film', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'anything', 'Disney', 'ever', 'offered', 'far', 'superior', 'anything', 'Dreamworks', 'ever', 'done', 'SOLID', 'story', 'near', 'impossible', 'walk', 'away', 'unmoved', 'honesty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lump', 'throat', 'certain', 'points.Incredibly', 'powerful', 'funny', 'moving', 'just', 'plain', 'wonderful']",The Iron Giant

I love the feel and style of this movie, but what I mostly love is the comparative reactions to the Iron Giant by Hogarth versus his progressively adult and responsible counterparts.Hogarth isn't the least bit scared of the giant--he thinks it's really cool--and after some initial fear, so does his super cool adult, artist friend Dean.  But Hogarth knows the adults would freak out if they knew, and so tries to hide and protect his robot friend from the adults.Enter an overeager and overzealous government representative who is most fond of telling people he's important because he's from the government. His chief concern in life is finding any incursion of the 'commies' on US soil, and when he suspects a robot from space may be on the loose, he jumps to the conclusion that it must be Russian.  If he can only confirm this, he can really live his ultimate fantasy--calling in the Army to blast the thing out of existence.Hogarth teaches the robot human values from a child's perspective, and ends up saving everyone from what might have been the end of humanity--but without really knowing it.  Hogarth just wants his friend, the robot, to live, be happy, and not be harmed or cause harm to anyone.Hogarth has natural morals.  He knows what's good and bad without considering good and evil.  Even if the robot had a 'Made in Russia' label on it, Hogarth would have helped, befriended, and did his best to teach it right and wrong all the same.  His character is a nice refresher for us jaded adults and our thousands of issues.All of the above aside, it's a very entertaining movie which couldn't be safer for your children to watch, and adults will be thrown back into how they thought as children.",5,Visually appealling and a sweet story about the clarity of childhood thinking compared to adult prejudice and stupidity.,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,1848,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatre', 'Japan', 'animation', 'capital', 'world', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'DVD', 'love', 'feel', 'style', 'movie', 'what', 'mostly', 'love', 'comparative', 'reactions', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Hogarth', 'progressively', 'adult', 'responsible', 'counterparts.Hogarth', ""n't"", 'least', 'bit', 'scared', 'giant', 'really', 'cool', 'initial', 'fear', 'so', 'super', 'cool', 'adult', 'artist', 'friend', 'Dean', 'Hogarth', 'adults', 'would', 'freak', 'out', 'knew', 'so', 'tries', 'hide', 'protect', 'robot', 'friend', 'adults.Enter', 'overeager', 'overzealous', 'government', 'representative', 'who', 'most', 'fond', 'telling', 'people', 'important', 'government', 'chief', 'concern', 'life', 'finding', 'incursion', ""'commies"", 'US', 'soil', 'when', 'robot', 'space', 'may', 'be', 'loose', 'conclusion', 'must', 'be', 'Russian', 'can', 'only', 'confirm', 'can', 'really', 'live', 'ultimate', 'fantasy', 'calling', 'Army', 'blast', 'thing', 'existence.Hogarth', 'teaches', 'robot', 'human', 'values', 'child', 'perspective', 'up', 'saving', 'everyone', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'humanity', 'really', 'knowing', 'Hogarth', 'just', 'friend', 'robot', 'live', 'be', 'happy', 'not', 'be', 'harmed', 'cause', 'harm', 'anyone.Hogarth', 'natural', 'morals', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'considering', 'good', 'evil', 'Even', 'robot', 'had', ""'Made"", 'Russia', 'label', 'Hogarth', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'befriended', 'did', 'best', 'teach', 'right', 'wrong', 'same', 'character', 'nice', 'refresher', 'jaded', 'adults', 'thousands', 'issues.All', 'above', 'aside', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'safer', 'children', 'watch', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'thrown', 'back', 'how', 'thought', 'children']",The Iron Giant

This award-winning but critically ignored feature animation debut from director Brad Bird combined a then-infant CGI style with traditional hand-drawn animation, was skillfully adapted from the late British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes' 1968 novel, The Iron Man, which was a gem in itself. It features the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Vin Diesel, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and John Mahoney, and it's a film that my then-young son and I first watched together on television, then immediately ordered on DVD here.This film is about a lonely boy named Hogarth (Eli Marienthal) raised by his widowed and single mother (Jennifer Aniston), who discovers an iron giant (Vin Diesel )who fell from space into the Maine woods. Helped by a beatnik artist and junkyard owner named Dean (Harry Connick, Jr.), a man who ""sees art where others see junk,"" the voices of these animated characters have been cast perfectly. The Iron Giant is a fifty-foot, metal-eating robot which reacts defensively if it recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it, but can stop himself. Hogarth and Dean have to stop the U.S. military and an arrogant, ambitious and paranoid federal agent (Christopher McDonald) from finding and destroying the Giant.The film is spellbinding, and though it was never a commercial success; in fact, it flopped in 1999 but remains one of the smartest and most profoundly moving sci-fi films ever made. My title to this review was taken from a dialogue that I had to explain to my son, where Hogarth was explaining to the Iron Giant that though he was made of metal, he had feelings, thought about things, and that meant that the Giant had a soul: ""And souls don't die."" After Hogarth left, the Giant laid back and looked at the stars and said: ""Souls don't die.""Bought The Iron Giant here years ago on DVD, because we wanted a permanent copy, but luckily it's available as an Amazon Instant Video, and if you haven't yet seen the film, it's worth it... and one to share together with your kids.11/20/2012",5,"The Iron Giant: ""Souls don't die...""",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,2426,"['How', 'might', 'completely', 'paranoid', 'post-war', 'America', 'react', 'overwhelmingly', 'powerful', 'invader', 'space', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'fall', '1957', 'question', 'asked', 'Iron', 'Giant', '1999', 'animated', 'film', 'now', 'true', 'cult', 'classic', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'science-fiction', 'tales', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'find', 'award-winning', 'critically', 'ignored', 'feature', 'animation', 'debut', 'director', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'combined', 'then-infant', 'CGI', 'style', 'traditional', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'was', 'skillfully', 'adapted', 'late', 'British', 'Poet', 'Laureate', 'Ted', 'Hughes', '1968', 'novel', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'gem', 'voices', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'film', 'then-young', 'son', 'first', 'watched', 'together', 'television', 'then', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'here.This', 'film', 'lonely', 'boy', 'named', 'Hogarth', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'raised', 'widowed', 'single', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'iron', 'giant', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'who', 'fell', 'space', 'Maine', 'woods', 'Helped', 'beatnik', 'artist', 'junkyard', 'owner', 'named', 'Dean', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'man', 'who', 'sees', 'art', 'where', 'others', 'see', 'junk', 'voices', 'animated', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'fifty-foot', 'metal-eating', 'robot', 'defensively', 'anything', 'weapon', 'immediately', 'attempting', 'destroy', 'can', 'stop', 'Hogarth', 'Dean', 'have', 'stop', 'U.S.', 'military', 'arrogant', 'ambitious', 'paranoid', 'federal', 'agent', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'finding', 'destroying', 'Giant.The', 'film', 'spellbinding', 'was', 'never', 'commercial', 'success', 'fact', 'flopped', '1999', 'one', 'smartest', 'most', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'title', 'review', 'was', 'taken', 'dialogue', 'had', 'explain', 'son', 'where', 'Hogarth', 'was', 'explaining', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'was', 'made', 'metal', 'had', 'feelings', 'thought', 'things', 'meant', 'Giant', 'had', 'soul', 'souls', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'Hogarth', 'left', 'Giant', 'laid', 'back', 'looked', 'stars', 'said', 'Souls', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'Bought', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'here', 'years', 'ago', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'permanent', 'copy', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'one', 'share', 'together', 'kids.11/20/2012']",The Iron Giant

Bird, however, is one of the very few animators who can write and tell a story with a genuine human touch.Set in a wryly named Downeast Maine hamlet called Rockwell,this is an unusual mix- part boy-and-pet fable, part '50s-style sci-fi/Cold War thriller with some gentle humor added. The main character, a friendly red-haired boy named Hogarth Hughes, is not only raised by a single mom (the waitress at the town diner)but the kid who finds a mysterious 50-foot robot in the woods...and helps him become not a man-eating monster, but a ""friendly giant"". He also keeps the secret from not only the townies, but a glib FBI agent who happens to rent a room in his house.A well-done mix of old-fashioned hand-drawn designs (withgood '50s decor) and the computer-driven Giant make for a nice transition between the classic Disney-style look and the flashy CGI era. Sequences involving the Giant, who can put himself together in seconds, are just geeky enough- this is a human-scalemovie, not a high-tech extravaganza. The character mix is also interesting and not typical '50s white-bread, especially the laid-back, beatnik-style scrap yard owner, Dean McCubbin (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.)Connick is the biggest name among the voice cast, which includes a down-to-earth Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's waitress mom, a caffeinated Christopher McDonald as the true-believer FBI man Mansley, and even the salty M. Emmet Walsh as the old salt who stumbles upon the seaborne Giant. But the best voice work belongs to an impressive child actor from San Francisco, Eli Marienthal, who gives Hogarth his warm, empathetic quality and personality that's rare in a cartoon kid (or a live-action one).Don't forget Vin Diesel's perfect mechanical grunts as Hogarth teaches the Giant to talk!Even the music and sound effects are subtle, rather than splashy. Michael Kamen's moody, symphonic score is unusual- and classy- for animation, and a few well-chosen rock n'roll oldies (notably ""Searchin'"" by the Coasters) are added, yet neither overwhelms. This is a story, not a ""Shrek""-style pastiche, and it shows.""The Iron Giant"" isn't just a sci-fi tribute, but a thoughtful fable with a central theme of friendship and self-guidance. Its surprising, and touching, finale, like the entire movie, is life-affirming without ever getting gooey or preachy.I can see why this movie slipped through the cracks on release. Studio politics is one thing, but the nature of ""The Iron Giant""- not quite fantasy, not quite high-tech- is hard to peg. What it is, though, is one of the nicest family-friendly movies I've seen in a while. I saw the older DVD version, but if the great success of ""The Incredibles"" gets others, like me, to check out Bird's other work, they'll discover a story that's not easy to pull off, animated or live. ""The Iron Giant"" deserves itsreputation as a lost animated gem!UPDATE: I recently checked this movie out for the first time in a year and, once again, think it's terrific. One of the few American animated movies with real depth and meaning- and a crackling good tribute to, not to mention send-up of, Cold War/sci-fi thrillers. Some surprise gags, too, like the sequence where Hogarth and agent Mansley share ice cream- and Hogarth puts Ex-Lax on the agent's sundae! What a wicked bit of humor there. The extras are great, too: when you watch the ""Behind the Armor"" version, little interviews pop up that really enhance, not detract from, the story line. Those with the late Michael Kamen, who wrote and conducted the score (in the Czech Republic, oddly enough) are especially interesting. The most unusual fact about ""Iron Giant"" is that the Ted Hughes story was originally optioned by Pete Townshend to develop into a ""Tommy""-style rock opera, but Townshend's friend, director Des McAnuff, insisted it would work better as an animated feature and brought it to an ambitious young ""Simpsons"" associate named Brad Bird. If Brad had never made ""The Incredibles"", he'd be remembered as one of the all-time great animation talents for ""Iron Giant"" alone. Again, I can't recommend this marvelous movie enough.",5,A LOST ANIMATED GEM!,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,4398,"['Iron', 'Giant', 'was', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'debut', 'animated', 'feature', 'several', 'years', 'created', 'Incredibles', 'be', 'best', 'animated', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'d"", 'not', 'heard', 'movie', 'original', 'story', 'children', 'novel', 'late', 'renowned', 'British', 'poet', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'Bird', 'however', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'animators', 'who', 'can', 'write', 'tell', 'story', 'genuine', 'human', 'touch.Set', 'wryly', 'named', 'Downeast', 'Maine', 'hamlet', 'called', 'Rockwell', 'unusual', 'mix-', 'part', 'boy-and-pet', 'fable', 'part', ""'50s-style"", 'sci-fi/Cold', 'War', 'thriller', 'gentle', 'humor', 'added', 'main', 'character', 'friendly', 'red-haired', 'boy', 'named', 'Hogarth', 'Hughes', 'not', 'only', 'raised', 'single', 'mom', 'waitress', 'town', 'diner', 'kid', 'who', 'mysterious', '50-foot', 'robot', 'woods', 'become', 'not', 'man-eating', 'monster', 'friendly', 'giant', 'also', 'secret', 'not', 'only', 'townies', 'glib', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'rent', 'room', 'house.A', 'well-done', 'mix', 'old-fashioned', 'hand-drawn', 'designs', 'withgood', ""'50s"", 'decor', 'computer-driven', 'Giant', 'make', 'nice', 'transition', 'classic', 'Disney-style', 'look', 'flashy', 'CGI', 'era', 'Sequences', 'involving', 'Giant', 'who', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'seconds', 'are', 'just', 'geeky', 'enough-', 'human-scalemovie', 'not', 'high-tech', 'extravaganza', 'character', 'mix', 'also', 'interesting', 'not', 'typical', 'white-bread', 'especially', 'laid-back', 'beatnik-style', 'scrap', 'yard', 'owner', 'Dean', 'McCubbin', 'voiced', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'Connick', 'biggest', 'name', 'voice', 'cast', 'down-to-earth', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Hogarth', 'waitress', 'mom', 'caffeinated', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'true-believer', 'FBI', 'man', 'Mansley', 'even', 'salty', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'old', 'salt', 'who', 'seaborne', 'Giant', 'best', 'voice', 'work', 'belongs', 'impressive', 'child', 'actor', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'who', 'Hogarth', 'warm', 'empathetic', 'quality', 'personality', 'rare', 'cartoon', 'kid', 'live-action', 'one', '.Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'perfect', 'mechanical', 'grunts', 'Hogarth', 'Giant', 'talk', 'Even', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'subtle', 'rather', 'splashy', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'moody', 'symphonic', 'score', 'unusual-', 'classy-', 'animation', 'few', 'well-chosen', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'oldies', 'notably', 'Searchin', 'Coasters', 'are', 'added', 'yet', 'overwhelms', 'story', 'not', 'Shrek', '-style', 'pastiche', 'Iron', 'Giant', ""n't"", 'just', 'sci-fi', 'tribute', 'thoughtful', 'fable', 'central', 'theme', 'friendship', 'self-guidance', 'surprising', 'touching', 'finale', 'entire', 'movie', 'life-affirming', 'ever', 'getting', 'gooey', 'preachy.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'release', 'Studio', 'politics', 'one', 'thing', 'nature', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'not', 'quite', 'fantasy', 'not', 'quite', 'high-tech-', 'hard', 'peg', 'What', 'though', 'one', 'nicest', 'family-friendly', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'saw', 'older', 'DVD', 'version', 'great', 'success', 'Incredibles', 'others', 'check', 'out', 'Bird', 'other', 'work', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'story', 'not', 'easy', 'pull', 'off', 'animated', 'live', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'itsreputation', 'lost', 'animated', 'gem', 'UPDATE', 'recently', 'checked', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'year', 'once', 'again', 'think', 'terrific', 'One', 'few', 'American', 'animated', 'movies', 'real', 'depth', 'meaning-', 'crackling', 'good', 'tribute', 'not', 'mention', 'send-up', 'Cold', 'War/sci-fi', 'thrillers', 'surprise', 'gags', 'too', 'sequence', 'where', 'Hogarth', 'agent', 'Mansley', 'share', 'ice', 'cream-', 'Hogarth', 'Ex-Lax', 'agent', 'sundae', 'What', 'wicked', 'bit', 'humor', 'there', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'when', 'watch', 'Armor', 'version', 'little', 'interviews', 'pop', 'up', 'really', 'enhance', 'not', 'detract', 'story', 'line', 'late', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'who', 'wrote', 'conducted', 'score', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'oddly', 'enough', 'are', 'especially', 'interesting', 'most', 'unusual', 'fact', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'story', 'was', 'originally', 'optioned', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'develop', 'Tommy', '-style', 'rock', 'opera', 'Townshend', 'friend', 'director', 'Des', 'McAnuff', 'insisted', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'animated', 'feature', 'brought', 'ambitious', 'young', 'Simpsons', 'associate', 'named', 'Brad', 'Bird', 'Brad', 'had', 'never', 'made', 'Incredibles', ""'d"", 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'animation', 'talents', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'alone', 'Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'marvelous', 'movie', 'enough']",The Iron Giant

Unlike a genuine bomb of a film, however, these unsung gems will often find a fanbase and be vindicated through home video release or airings on TV, and gain the recognition they deserve long after their theater run has come to an end.  (Yes, sometimes the occasional bomb gains a cult following after the fact, such as ""Showgirls"" or ""Zardoff,"" but these tend to be watched for the ""so bad they're good"" factor rather than any sort of quality...)""The Iron Giant"" is one such film, one that arrived in theaters relatively unpromoted except for a few trailers, and made barely a ripple during its theatrical run.  But unlike many other films that have faded into obscurity, this film has found its niche through the home video market and become something of a classic... and quite deservedly so, as it's one of the most heartfelt animated films I've ever seen.Set in the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine in the late 1950s, this film follows a boy and his robot -- young Hogarth, a young boy living with his single mother and who feels like an outcast due to being moved up a grade in school, and the titular Iron Giant, who crash-lands in the ocean and wanders into the woods around town, bereft of his memory and seeking food (metal) and a safe place to stay.  Hogarth stumbles across the giant late one night and ends up befriending him, teaching him about the world and finding sanctuary for him in a junkyard, run by the deadpan-snarker beatnik Dean.  Both Hogarth and Dean try to keep the giant occupied and hidden from an arrogant government agent who sees the giant as his ticket to gaining recognition for himself... but when said agent sics the US military on the giant, Hogarth must somehow prove the giant is benevolent, before the military can destroy him.The animation in this film is fantastic.  A combination of traditional 2D animation and cel-shaded CGI, it manages to combine both elements very well for being a '90s animated feature.  The giant is well-rendered, highly detailed and not clashing horribly with the 2D characters and backgrounds.  And there's a wide variety of character designs in this film, which is quite appreciated when many animated films tend to fall back on three or four basic designs for their human characters.  And the 1950s setting of the film actually benefits it -- not only does this film capture the look and feel of the decade in its scenery, it helps drive the plot as well, as Cold-War paranoia and the Red Scare affect many people's attitude toward their unlikely alien invader.The characters are also well-done, and in most cases quite likable.  Hogarth is a typical young boy, energetic and hungry for adventure, and while he can be a bit of a smartmouth at times he didn't come across as obnoxious -- he had plenty of kind and heartwarming moments.  The giant himself is -- there's no better word for it -- adorable, somewhat nave and innocent but endlessly curious, with just as much heart as any of the human characters.  Dean serves as a foil for the two main characters, sarcastic and something of a realist, and provides some of the film's funniest moments.  The government agent is the typical bad guy, out to hunt down the giant, but there are moments that show his desperate need for approval and validation, which give him some motivation for what he does (I like it when a film gives its villains more motivation than ""hahaha, I'm EVIL!"").  The minor characters -- Hogarth's mom, the general, and various townsfolk -- tend to only appear when they're needed for the plot, but they do get some good lines and are shown to be sympathetic characters in their own rights.Some have complained that this film is an anti-gun, anti-military propaganda piece.  I respectfully disagree.  Yes, the army serves as one of the antagonists in this film, but the film is careful to show that the military is acting in what they see as the best interests of the people, and that they are willing to back down when necessary.  The anti-gun message is a little more heavy-handed, but in the end the overall message of the film seems to be that it's not what you are or what you're capable of, but what you choose to be and what you choose to do with what you can do, that's good or bad.  That's a message I can fully get behind -- just as the giant, for all his destructive capabilities, can choose whether to use his abilities for good or ill, so any member of society can choose what they do with what they have.And maybe a minor spoiler here, but... this film brought me close to tears.  It manages to grip the heart that much, especially with its lovable robot character.An underrated animation classic, this is a must-have for any animation fan.  Probably best for kids 10 and older due to some violence and language.",5,A boy and his robot - an underrated animated classic,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,5112,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'film',

513886,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000028U3R,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 3]","I am always hesitant to give a five-star rating to a film.  I always try to compare movies to ones that are in the same genre first, and then to films that have stood the test of time before determining if they are worthy of five stars.  ""The Iron Giant"" towers over the competition in its genre, and I believe that it will be around much longer than many of its modern counterparts.  It is full of heart, wonder, and amazement.  It has emotional twists that keep you intrigued.  It is definitely worthy of five stars.First of all, the giant is great.  He's just a big kid trying to find his place in the universe.  ""E.T."" entered my mind as soon as he is discovered by young Hogarth near the power plant.  There is a charm about the giant that I have seen in few Disney or Dreamworks characters.  You will deeply care about him before the film is over.Hogarth is the typical little boy.  He loves sci-fi and horror movies, even though his mother doesn't quite approve of them.  He likes to sneak out of the house every once in awhile for a little mischief.  When he hears noises, they automatically become ""invaders from Mars.""  He is such a wonderful little character to watch on the screen.The voices in the film are brilliantly cast.  Vin Diesel voices the giant.  He manages to evoke tons of emotion, even though most of his lines have fewer than three words in them.  Harry Connick, Jr. stands out as Dean, the local scrap metal artist, who helps Hogarth ""hide"" the giant.  Jennifer Aniston plays Hogarth's mother, who busts her bottom to support her son.  There is a genuine love between her character and that of Hogarth's that is missing in most animated features today.  Chrisopher McDonald plays a scheming government agent and John Mahoney lends his voice to the general who doesn't believe McDonald at first, but is then fooled into listening to him.  Eli Marienthal portrays Hogarth.  Considering that he plays Stifler's brother in the ""American Pie"" films, he does an amazing job in capturing the wonder inside of Hogarth.  M. Emmett Walsh and Cloris Leachman are two of the other stellar voices in this feature.  There roles aren't as big, but they are great in the movie.The animation is beautiful.  From the forest and countryside to the little town that is ""terrorized"" by the giant, it's all brilliantly done.The story is one full of emotion.  I'll be honest and tell you that I shed a few tears near the end of the movie.  The characters are so likeable and the story is so good that it is hard not to get caught up in the moment.As far as the DVD is concerned, there are more special features than you'd expect for a film such as this.  It didn't do extremely well at the box office, so I wasn't expecting much in the way of extras.  What you get are deleted scenes from the movie, interviews with members of the crew, hidden gems that you have to bounce around the menu for, and mini-documentaries on the creation of the film.There are a couple of curse words in the movie, but the story is so great that you can look beyond this.  Naturally, anything involving a giant includes a little violence, but it is all handled with care.  There is one sad moment involving a deer, and some may consider the message a little preachy, but just keep in mind that our hero and his young friend are both children trying to cope with reality.Trust me when I say that you will fall in love with this movie.  It has a powerful story and never gets too sugary for anyone.  It will hold the attention of all viewers, no matter what their age.  It is worthy of multiple views and definitely worth purchasing.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  Watch it with your family after you have a home-cooked meal at the dinner table to top off a perfect evening.",5,One Of The Best Films Ever,1101772800,"11 30, 2004",2004,3779,"['am', 'always', 'hesitant', 'give', 'five-star', 'rating', 'film', 'always', 'try', 'compare', 'movies', 'ones', 'are', 'same', 'genre', 'first', 'then', 'films', 'have', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'determining', 'are', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'towers', 'competition', 'genre', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'around', 'much', 'longer', 'many', 'modern', 'counterparts', 'full', 'heart', 'wonder', 'amazement', 'emotional', 'twists', 'keep', 'intrigued', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars.First', 'giant', 'great', 'just', 'big', 'kid', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'universe', 'E.T', 'entered', 'mind', 'as', 'soon', 'discovered', 'young', 'Hogarth', 'power', 'plant', 'charm', 'giant', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'Disney', 'Dreamworks', 'characters', 'will', 'deeply', 'care', 'film', 'over.Hogarth', 'typical', 'little', 'boy', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'movies', 'even', 'mother', ""n't"", 'quite', 'approve', 'sneak', 'house', 'once', 'awhile', 'little', 'mischief', 'When', 'noises', 'automatically', 'become', 'invaders', 'Mars', 'such', 'wonderful', 'little', 'character', 'watch', 'screen.The', 'voices', 'film', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'giant', 'evoke', 'tons', 'emotion', 'even', 'most', 'lines', 'have', 'fewer', 'three', 'words', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'out', 'Dean', 'local', 'scrap', 'metal', 'artist', 'who', 'Hogarth', 'hide', 'giant', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Hogarth', 'mother', 'who', 'bottom', 'support', 'son', 'genuine', 'love', 'character', 'Hogarth', 'missing', 'most', 'animated', 'features', 'today', 'Chrisopher', 'McDonald', 'scheming', 'government', 'agent', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'voice', 'general', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'McDonald', 'first', 'then', 'fooled', 'listening', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', 'Hogarth', 'Considering', 'Stifler', 'brother', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'amazing', 'job', 'capturing', 'wonder', 'Hogarth', 'M.', 'Emmett', 'Walsh', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'stellar', 'voices', 'feature', 'roles', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'are', 'great', 'movie.The', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'forest', 'countryside', 'little', 'town', 'terrorized', 'giant', 'brilliantly', 'done.The', 'story', 'one', 'full', 'emotion', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'tell', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'end', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'likeable', 'story', 'so', 'good', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'moment.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'are', 'more', 'special', 'features', ""'d"", 'expect', 'film', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'extremely', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'What', 'get', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'interviews', 'members', 'crew', 'hidden', 'gems', 'have', 'bounce', 'menu', 'mini-documentaries', 'creation', 'are', 'couple', 'curse', 'words', 'movie', 'story', 'so', 'great', 'can', 'look', 'Naturally', 'anything', 'involving', 'giant', 'little', 'violence', 'handled', 'care', 'one', 'sad', 'moment', 'involving', 'deer', 'may', 'consider', 'message', 'little', 'preachy', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'hero', 'young', 'friend', 'are', 'children', 'trying', 'cope', 'reality.Trust', 'when', 'say', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'powerful', 'story', 'never', 'too', 'sugary', 'anyone', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'viewers', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'worthy', 'multiple', 'views', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'Watch', 'family', 'have', 'home-cooked', 'meal', 'dinner', 'table', 'top', 'off', 'perfect', 'evening']",The Iron Giant

My children are young, and I simply insist on shielding them from all swear words whenever possible.  I rented the video and have decided not to buy a copy for my children due only to the fact that mild oaths like 'Sweet Mother of God,' 'damn,' and 'what the hell,' etc. are used.  Why do filmmakers think that American mothers approve of cursing in movies intended for young audiences?  I'd love to see DVD technology developed that would allow a parent to play a ""censored"" version of any given movie without the cuss-words.  My kids don't need to hear them!!  I'm sure they'll hear those words soon enough at school--or from their cousins!!Aside from the inappropriate language used in several spots in the film, there is little else to dislike about ""The Iron Giant.""  The characters are likable and believable, the messages of friendship and trust shine through, and the movie doesn't have a soundtrack full of catchy tunes blasted at full volume; in fact, I don't recall hearing music that was intrusive at all.  That, in my opinion, is one hallmark of a well-made film.  Grown-ups watching ""Iron Giant"" will catch some of the less-obvious jokes embedded in the film; watch for the air-raid drill film Hogarth and his classmates are shown at school.  I enjoyed this movie, but if you buy it, I recommend that parents watch it with their children so that they can answer the questions that will surely follow about the cold war, sophisticated weaponry, etc.  ""Iron Giant"" deserves your consideration; it seems to have been overlooked to some extent when it was originally released.",4,"""Iron Giant"" is rated PG for a reason!",1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,1741,"['%', '@', '*', 'would', 'give', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'five', 'stars', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'easily', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'use', 'several', 'unnecessary', 'expletives', 'children', 'are', 'young', 'simply', 'insist', 'shielding', 'swear', 'words', 'whenever', 'possible', 'rented', 'video', 'have', 'decided', 'not', 'buy', 'copy', 'children', 'due', 'only', 'fact', 'mild', 'oaths', ""'Sweet"", 'Mother', 'God', ""'damn"", 'hell', 'etc', 'are', 'used', 'Why', 'do', 'filmmakers', 'think', 'American', 'mothers', 'cursing', 'movies', 'intended', 'young', 'audiences', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'DVD', 'technology', 'developed', 'would', 'allow', 'parent', 'play', 'censored', 'version', 'given', 'movie', 'cuss-words', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hear', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'words', 'soon', 'enough', 'school', 'cousins', 'Aside', 'inappropriate', 'language', 'used', 'several', 'spots', 'film', 'little', 'else', 'dislike', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'believable', 'messages', 'friendship', 'trust', 'shine', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'blasted', 'full', 'volume', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'hearing', 'music', 'was', 'intrusive', 'opinion', 'one', 'hallmark', 'well-made', 'film', 'Grown-ups', 'watching', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'will', 'catch', 'less-obvious', 'jokes', 'embedded', 'film', 'watch', 'air-raid', 'drill', 'film', 'Hogarth', 'classmates', 'are', 'shown', 'school', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'buy', 'recommend', 'parents', 'watch', 'children', 'can', 'answer', 'questions', 'will', 'surely', 'follow', 'cold', 'war', 'sophisticated', 'weaponry', 'etc', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'consideration', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'extent', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released']",The Iron Giant
513898,ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B000028U3R,Lord Chimp,"[14, 14]","The Iron Giant choked in the box office, buried under a deluge of flashy films, all of which suffered from a serious dearth of heart and soul. It didn't help that the advertising campaign was painfully bad, embedding a pretense of &quot;crappy kids' movie.&quot; And, of course, the animated motion picture genre is decidedly handcuffed by Disney, and any non-Disney flick is sure to elicit cynicism from the kids (the prime demographic for a movie like this).But forget all that...The Iron Giant is a fine movie. Actually, I would go as far as to say it's the best animated movie I've ever seen.Forget everything you've ever thought about animated films. Just for kids...bad script...juvenile humor...long, boring music numbers...talking animal sidekicks with lame one-liners... Forget it all. Instead of staying shackled to convention, The Iron Giant eschews all the faults associated with other animated films, and simply delivers a charming film that anyone can enjoy. Pardon the clich&eacute;, but in this case, it is absolutely true.The Iron Giant's story is delightfully captivating in all its exquisitely crafted facets. The script is irresistible, tastefully witty, and profoundly moving. Time and time again, I marveled at how a single scene could be better than entire movies. The giant robot character is a stranger in a strange land, and his (mis)adventures with Hogarth (the young boy who befriends the robot) are accompanied with elegant humor, but sometimes the lighthearted moments relinquish themselves to emotionally-stirring segments. If the ending doesn't have you holding back tears, you simply aren't human. The iron giant himself succeeds in being the ideal non-human character with a very important human element, and that's one of the greatest merits of this movie's story.From a technical standpoint, the animation is simply breathtaking. Special accolade goes to the technique used on the iron giant himself. He is rendered with computers graphics, but with a special cel-shading technique that makes him look hand-drawn. This allows him to seamlessly blend in with the hand-drawn environments and other characters.Some people will certainly pass by The Iron Giant. They'll return to their Disney flicks -- movies that are so engineered to be impressive that they somehow fail. These people will never know what they missed. That is because The Iron Giant is so much more than any other animated movie. It's a ride through a timeless story and human emotion that few movies match, much less animated films. Lofty praise, certainly, but every word of it is sincere and true.

The Cold War is heating up and people are getting paranoid about Russia especially with Sputnik orbiting the earth. Hogarth lives in a wooded area outside a small Maine community with his single mother who works long hours in a restaurant. This gives Hogarth plenty of time to explore and develop his imagination. There is a crash nearby in the woods and rumors start about some giant creature. When Hogarth is watching TV alone at night the picture suddenly turns to snow. Hogarth climbs up on the roof to adjust the antenna only to find part of it missing. He sees a trail of destruction and follows it to the nearest power station where Hogarth finds the unconscious Iron Giant, a 50 foot tall robot like character who must find metal and lots of it to eat to survive. Trying to eat a chunk of the high voltage tower was bad for indigestion. Hogarth saves his life and the adventure begins of trying to protect this friendly giant from the community and a very paranoid government agent determined to destroy first and ask questions later.

Precious few saw it in theaters.Thank God for film preservation in the form of DVD!Like the book, the picture takes place in 1957, during the height of The Cold War. The Soviet Union's satellite, Sputnik, flies across American skies. Our country is filled with paranoia. What else may they have launched?One stormy night off the coast of Maine, a huge object falls from the sky. A frightened sailor sees it and swears that it is a giant made of metal. The townsfolk chalk the tale off to the sailor's love of drink. A giant made of metal, indeed!A night or so later, young Hogarth Hughes, whose Mom is working overtime at the local diner, gets mad when his TV starts acting up. He goes to the roof to check the antenna and finds it missing. He then notices huge footprints leading away from the house and into the woods. He grabs his deceased Dad's old army rifle and a flashlight and goes off in pursuit. He soon discovers that there is indeed a metal giant. In fact, he saves it when it bumps into some high voltage utility wires. The adventure has begun.Rarely has a movie for children - or adults! - addressed the need to search for a peaceful solution to our problems as gently or as wisely as The Iron Giant. It never preaches and is always accessible. It does not address us from on high. It remains at our level. It also shows how clever we can be at overcoming the most unexpected obstacles. It reminds us that things alien to us are not always hostile to us. In fact, it is we who often initiate the hostilities. Perhaps best of all, The Iron Giant examines these and other issues in the guise of a wonderful story that should hold almost anyone's attention.The animation is first-rate. Most of the voices are good, especially Harry Connick, Jr.'s as Dean Cooper, a hip young artist. As Hogath's voice, Eli Marienthal speaks like a real boy, not a cartoon boy. Speaking for Hogarth's mother, Annie, Jennifer Anniston gives her a loving quality. Vin Diesel does well with the most difficult voice, that of The Iron Giant.Rated PG for a couple of spooky scenes and a few mild profanities.

But now this has pride & place in my favourite movies - alongside Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Miss Congeniality, Freaky Friday, Mean Girls, and there's probably more.I hardly watch animation anymore, unless its Simpsons or Family Guy, and I've never been that keen on Japanese animation particularly, and for some reason got this into my head as being Japanese animated. But it wasn't. (I hate the unrealistic HUGE eyes) I simply forgot after a while that this was just drawings or CGI. It's not one of those animations, where the words don't match the movements of the mouth etc.And I loved the fact that some famous people were instantly recognisable just by the voices. I practically cheered when I recognised Jennifer Aniston's voice straight away, and although I've never heard Harry Connick Jnr speak (only sing), I wasn't sure about his voice, but his character looked really similar to him! Vin Diesel was a little harder to guess, as he was the voice of the giant, and his voice sounded overly processed, but obviously, it's not going to sound normal!The difference between this movie, and any Disney movies, is the lack of songs. It's not as schmaltzy as a Disney movie, and it definitely makes it better. There's a fantastic score by Michael Kamen, and the good thing is there a definite lack of songs, which you might normally find. And Brad Bird has now joined Pixar and recently made the Incredibles movie.It's has a lot of incredible laugh out loud moments, and scenes that you need to watch over & over. I particularly had to re-watch the scrapyard scene where the giant takes a bite out of a car and its alarm starts going off! The look on his face was unforgettable, and then he tries sitting on it, and then he starts smashing it to shut it up! It's so funny, I'm sitting at the computer trying to not to make it obvious I'm giggling at the memory. The other scene which had me creasing myself, and had me crying with laughter, was the lake scene, where the giant follows the little boy into the lake. BONZAI!!! The following scene is hilarious, where you see a racoon desperately trying to swim, or Dean ending up in the middle of the road, soaking wet.The entire story seldom gets boring or slow, which I sometimes tend to find with animation, or any movie for that matter. It's quite short at the same time, only 86 minutes. I didn't like the FBI guy or whatever he was. He was drawn evil, and he was definitely not a good thing. But then he wasn't meant to be.I don't remember much about this movie when it originally came out, which is 5 years ago, but apparently, Warner didn't do a great job of advertising it, so it probably sank without a trace, and only got to where it is by word of mouth.It has bits of ET in it, but the sentimental, tear-inducing finale reminded me SOOOOOO much of the finale to Armageddon. Which was a neat touch I thought. I did get quite teary, although not full on bawling. I got choked up by the end.I'm so glad that I was recommended to watch this movie, and would definitely rewatch it at some point, although you'll have to stop me trying to watch the funny moments over & over. I demand you see this movie, and just make sure you have a box of tissues somewhere.

It is a particular command for those whohave mastered the field of animated cartoons, anidiom which too many still dismiss as unworthy""kidvid"" material.Introduce any such skeptic to the work of directorBrad Bird, and the odds are that you will see suchskepticism fade like grey clouds from a sunlit sky.Bird, whose roots in the field began with some finework for THE SIMPSONS, and has grown into Oscar-winningnarrative as showcased by THE INCREDIBLES, first metthe challenge of feature animation with his ingenioustreatment of poet Ted Hughes' single prose work.There can be no doubt that THE IRON GIANT stands on itsown as a masterpiece in any genre. A wicked piece ofScience Fiction which may find some thinking of THE DAYTHE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE IRON GIANT is the other sideof the saga.

He reminds me of Iron Man and a Transformer at the same time, so not entirely original, but whatever. The story sometimes feels like it takes a few detours, but it remains the same: hide the Giant robot as long as you can! But, we all know in the end that the robot is exposed and then there's explosions and I'll let you see how it ends. The reason I gave it a 3/5 stars is because of the obvious anti-gun propaganda in the movie. Phrases like ""guns kill"" and ""I'm not a gun"" made me frown. In my opinion, guns don't kill; it's people who kill, they just happened to use a gun to do it. Anyway, this movie has good animation and a decent story that left room for a sequel at the end.

In the book the origins of the giant are unknown, and he is initially buried beneath the earth before being attacked and ultimately befriended.  The enemy in the book, who becomes a common enemy to both the humans and the giant and the cause of their alliance, was a giant dragon-like creature (as big as Australia!!) who the giant ends up outsmarting.In the film, set during the Cold War, and presenting a wonderful portrait of the 50s atmosphere, the enemy is US -- and our tendency to fear what is alien, and to shoot first and ask questions later.  I think that this is, in the end, more profound.  Of course, the original author may have had some such allegory in mind when he wrote the original book, since the dragon from outer space ends up destroying and enveloping in darkness a large part of the planet, almost like a world war.  But in that case is their alliance with the giant supposed to mean an alliance with military technology in order to prevent a world war?  In the film, the robot is just a cool robot from outer space, that human beings can choose to make a friend or to establish as an enemy.In any case, this is easily one of the best animated films to come out of the United States in the last decade (and one of the others is by the same director, Brad Bird).",5,may even be more interesting than the book,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,1407,"['Iron', 'Giant', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'wonderful', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'Ted', 'Hughes', 'written', 'late', 'sixties', 'book', 'origins', 'giant', 'are', 'unknown', 'initially', 'buried', 'earth', 'being', 'attacked', 'ultimately', 'befriended', 'enemy', 'book', 'who', 'common', 'enemy', 'humans', 'giant', 'cause', 'alliance', 'was', 'giant', 'dragon-like', 'creature', 'as', 'big', 'Australia', 'who', 'giant', 'up', 'film', 'set', 'Cold', 'War', 'presenting', 'wonderful', 'portrait', '50s', 'atmosphere', 'enemy', 'US', 'tendency', 'fear', 'what', 'alien', 'shoot', 'first', 'ask', 'questions', 'later', 'think', 'end', 'more', 'profound', 'course', 'original', 'author', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'such', 'allegory', 'mind', 'when', 'wrote', 'original', 'book', 'dragon', 'outer', 'space', 'up', 'destroying', 'enveloping', 'darkness', 'large', 'part', 'planet', 'almost', 'world', 'war', 'case', 'alliance', 'giant', 'supposed', 'mean', 'alliance', 'military', 'technology', 'order', 'prevent', 'world', 'war', 'film', 'robot', 'just', 'cool', 'robot', 'outer', 'space', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'choose', 'make', 'friend', 'establish', 'enemy.In', 'case', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'come', 'United', 'States', 'last', 'decade', 'one', 'others', 'same', 'director', 'Brad', 'Bird']",The Iron Giant

It's characters are honest portrayals of people in the 1950s..A single parent family trying to make ends meet, A beatik who likes to express himself through art, and townspeople who are afraid of nuclear war. Try finding that in Disney drivel. What I like is how one kids simplicity can change a symbol of war into a beacon of peace (that being the Iron Giant). The film is full of humor. The scene where Dean has to unzip his pants to let out Hogarth's new pet is hilarious. Another funny scene is where Hogarth is wired up on Expresso. There are also heartfelt scenes where the Iron Giant goes through the emotions of being emotional. I feel for the Giant because I know what it is like to be lonely and on the outside. Another quality that I applaud is the Giant decides to do the right thing rather than what he was programmed for. The animation was superb and the soundtrack was full of 50s gems. I am one of the many on this list that think it deserved more attention in advertising (instead WB throws the spotlight on ho-hum films like Space Jam). It also teaches lessons to kids such as friendship, war, death, and doing what is right.

I'm also guilty of passing it during its run because I thought it's another Disney rip-off. Far from it, no songs or dance detract from the  basic plot. It's got great satirical comments on the atomic age paranoia, a  cute sense of humor that would make even adults snicker, and a truly  touching ending that would make even the souless shed a tear. The Iron  Giant character is also a masterpiece of 3d animation that gives dimension  to the robot without looking out of place as other 3d animated features  have been in 2d backgrounds. Jennifer Aniston makes a great vocal actress  as Hogarth's mom, Eli Marienthal does a superb job on his performance as  the wide-eyed kid, Hogarth, and Harry Connick Jr makes the cool cat, Dean,  look cooler. The DVD version, which I bought, sports The Making of the Iron  Giant feature that was shown on the WB before. It was a decent add-on along  with some cast bios.

J Rey,"[9, 9]","Director Brad Bird (The Simpsons & The Incredibles) surpasses some of Disney's finest with the highly entertaining animated adventure ""The Iron Giant"". In the dawn of the Cold War, a spirited New England boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) forms a strong friendship with a gigantic metal-eating robot (Vin Diesel) from another world. When an ambitious government agent (Christopher MacDonald) arrives to investigate strange events in town, Hogarth and the local beatnik (Harry Connick Jr.) must protect their enormous visitor from the US military. Based on the 1968 children's book, ""The Iron Giant"" is a superbly enjoyable animated treasure. Though the animated movie failed in theaters, it received great critical praise and a good cult following upon home video release and television airings. The underrated family film contains a well written story, memorable characters, great humor and a strong morale message. The talented voice cast also includes John Mahoney (Frasier) and Jennifer Aniston (Freinds).""The Iron Giant"" Special Edition is a notable improvement over its previous release. The 1999 animated feature is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a wonderful video transfer with rich detailed colors, and a lively Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.

513963,A4FX5YCJA630V,B000028U3R,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","Despite glowing praise from the critics and enthusiastic responses from audiences, ""The Iron Giant"" crept in and out of theatres with barely a whisper. And what a terrible shame it was. It seems to me that so often the very best of children's programming (other movies that come to mind are ""The Secret Garden"", ""A Little Princess"" and ""Fairytale: A True Story"") that can be just as easily enjoyed by their parents are unfairly shadowed by the empty and junky movies put in the spotlight by huge advertising and wide range of merchandising.It is the Cold War, and young Hogarth living in the Maine woods is, like everyone else, on edge about what other countries are getting up to behind America's back. Of course, as a kid, such worries are easily prepared for with sauce-pan helmets and plastic guns. When the antennae from his roof is mysterious torn off, young Hogarth comes to the obvious conclusion (""Invaders from Mars!"") and makes his way into the woods to find the culprit. Which is, believe it or not, a huge iron robot that has no idea how it got there.Delighted at his find, Hogarth instantly adopts him, and coaxes him homeward to hide in the barn, away from the eyes (and inevitable screams) of his single mother Annie, and introducing him to the concept of good and evil, souls, death, fear of the unknown and Superman. But other forces are on the move - the paranoid governent is on the lookout for any odd disturbances which could mean spying foreign countries, and one agent in particular is determined to track down the Giant.Helped by his beatnik friend Dean who creates art at the local junkyard, Hogarth pits his skills against this agent, who wonderfully captures every shade of prejudice humankind can show - from subterfuge to threats to madness. Everyone loves watching ""helpless"" kids being pitted up against ""older, wiser"" adults, and in this case the conflict doesn't disappoint - I defy anyone not to burst out laughing at the results of a certain powder Hogarth pours into the agent's milkshake.The final message ""You are what you choose to be"" is beautifully worked up to when the Giant realises that he reacts defensively to any attack upon him, and when the military is called in, he is devastated at the thought of being merely a gun. The climax is something I can't give away, but it is a beautiful ending to a powerful story.Animation is not in any way stylised or overly cartoonish, and the humans look, move and sound like natural humans. Voice acting is good on all fronts, from the adequate Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr as Annie and Dean, to the then-unknown Vin Diesiel as the Giant, before his fame took hold after ""Pitch Black"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"". But special mention must be made of Christopher McDonald as the high-strung agent, and the voice actor (sorry, I don't know exactly who it is) of Hogarth, who brings his character to life with all its energy, egoism, sincerity and innocence that all ten year old boys have - look out especially for the scene in which he drinks a little too much coffee! With no broadway-style musical numbers or corny endings, ""The Iron Giant"" is serious, poignant and sweet, without being too sentimental.In the course of this movie young Hogarth tells the Iron Giant: ""You think about important things. And you care about things. That must mean you have a soul."" The same thing could be said of this movie, and indeed compared with some of the other rubbish that is catapulted rapidly into children's minds these days, the rare movie/book that touches on such real issues as ""The Iron Giant"" does *do* seem to have souls.",5,This Is What Children's Entertainment Should Be,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,3620,"['glowing', 'praise', 'critics', 'enthusiastic', 'responses', 'audiences', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'crept', 'theatres', 'barely', 'whisper', 'what', 'terrible', 'shame', 'was', 'so', 'often', 'very', 'best', 'children', 'programming', 'other', 'movies', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Little', 'Princess', 'Fairytale', 'True', 'Story', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'easily', 'enjoyed', 'parents', 'are', 'unfairly', 'shadowed', 'empty', 'junky', 'movies', 'put', 'spotlight', 'huge', 'advertising', 'wide', 'range', 'merchandising.It', 'Cold', 'War', 'young', 'Hogarth', 'living', 'Maine', 'woods', 'everyone', 'else', 'edge', 'what', 'other', 'countries', 'are', 'getting', 'up', 'America', 'back', 'course', 'kid', 'such', 'worries', 'are', 'easily', 'prepared', 'sauce-pan', 'helmets', 'plastic', 'guns', 'When', 'antennae', 'roof', 'mysterious', 'torn', 'off', 'young', 'Hogarth', 'obvious', 'conclusion', 'Invaders', 'Mars', 'way', 'woods', 'find', 'culprit', 'Which', 'believe', 'not', 'huge', 'iron', 'robot', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'there.Delighted', 'find', 'Hogarth', 'instantly', 'coaxes', 'homeward', 'hide', 'barn', 'away', 'eyes', 'inevitable', 'screams', 'single', 'mother', 'Annie', 'introducing', 'concept', 'good', 'evil', 'souls', 'death', 'fear', 'unknown', 'Superman', 'other', 'forces', 'are', 'move', 'paranoid', 'governent', 'lookout', 'odd', 'disturbances', 'could', 'mean', 'spying', 'foreign', 'countries', 'one', 'agent', 'particular', 'determined', 'track', 'down', 'Giant.Helped', 'beatnik', 'friend', 'Dean', 'who', 'art', 'local', 'junkyard', 'Hogarth', 'skills', 'agent', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'shade', 'prejudice', 'humankind', 'can', 'show', 'subterfuge', 'threats', 'madness', 'Everyone', 'watching', 'helpless', 'kids', 'being', 'pitted', 'up', 'older', 'wiser', 'adults', 'case', 'conflict', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'defy', 'anyone', 'not', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'results', 'certain', 'powder', 'Hogarth', 'agent', 'milkshake.The', 'final', 'message', 'are', 'what', 'choose', 'be', 'beautifully', 'worked', 'up', 'when', 'Giant', 'defensively', 'attack', 'when', 'military', 'called', 'devastated', 'thought', 'being', 'merely', 'gun', 'climax', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'powerful', 'story.Animation', 'not', 'way', 'stylised', 'overly', 'cartoonish', 'humans', 'look', 'move', 'sound', 'natural', 'humans', 'Voice', 'acting', 'good', 'fronts', 'adequate', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr', 'Annie', 'Dean', 'then-unknown', 'Vin', 'Diesiel', 'Giant', 'fame', 'took', 'hold', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'high-strung', 'agent', 'voice', 'actor', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'Hogarth', 'who', 'character', 'life', 'energy', 'egoism', 'sincerity', 'innocence', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'have', 'look', 'out', 'especially', 'scene', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'coffee', 'broadway-style', 'musical', 'numbers', 'corny', 'endings', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'serious', 'poignant', 'sweet', 'being', 'too', 'sentimental.In', 'course', 'movie', 'young', 'Hogarth', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'think', 'important', 'things', 'care', 'things', 'must', 'mean', 'have', 'soul', 'same', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'indeed', 'compared', 'other', 'rubbish', 'catapulted', 'rapidly', 'children', 'minds', 'days', 'rare', 'movie/book', 'such', 'real', 'issues', 'Iron', 'Giant', '*do*', 'seem', 'have', 'souls']",The Iron Giant

Fortunately for me it was given to me as a gift, and instead of a typical piece of animated feel-good flotsam, I was delighted to discover a brilliantly conceived and animated film with great subtlety and nuance.The Iron Giant comes from space during a storm off the coast of Maine in the 1950s, during the height of cold war hysteria. He is befriended by the comically named Hogarth Hughes through a series of improbable events. The story metaphorically becomes a struggle between good and evil, yet never becomes jingoistic or propagandistic. If you have dry eyes at the end of the film you are not human, which speaks to the power of really good animation and filmmaking in general.The voices (Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., Vin Diesel, John Mahoney, etc.) are all perfect for their roles, and the animation is truly breathtaking. This is better than anything Disney has made in the last twenty years or so, and Warner Brothers should be proud of this film and use it as a model for what a truly good animated picture can be.Finally, to dispel a rumor, although this film is suitable for kids, it is not a ""kid's movie,"" as it raises many important issues and deals with them in a very adult fashion. Although children will enjoy the film, expect it to generate major questions from them. In that regard, it does most parents a service in introducing difficult concepts (such as love, friendship, and death) in a marvelous way. Some of the humor will slide right past younger children, but never fear, the adults will love it.I highly recommend this film to children and adults alike.

The basic plot of the movie is this:  The Iron Giant, an alien robot of tremendous size and power, crash-lands on Earth for reasons unknown.  Although the Giant has the power to &quot;fix&quot; physical damage, he has somehow been damaged mentally so that he has lost memory of all of his powers.  His crash-landing does not go unnoticed by the government, which sends an agent to investigate (the story is set in 1957, at the height of Sputnik-inspired paranoia).  Meanwhile, the Giant has made the acquaintance of young Hogarth Hobbs, a boy living with his working mom in a small Maine town.  The whereabouts of Hogarth's dad are never explicity made clear, but you do get a brief glimpse of a photo in Hogarth's room of a fighter pilot and his plane, presumably Dad, lost in Korea (just my theory).  The story pretty much revolves around the agent's attempts to find the Giant (with the aid of a few indiscretions by Hogarth, who really needs to keep better track of his stuff), and Hogarth's attempts to keep the Giant away from the government's clutches, while at the same time developing a relationship with the Giant that is very reminiscent of Elliot and E.T.  Hogarth gets some help in this effot from Dean, the local hippie type who runs the local junkyard (which is good for the Giant, who needs to eat scrap metal to survive).At first, the Giant seems to be nothing more than a big robot.  But, as Hogarth learns to communicate with him, we learn that the Giant has feelings and a big heart.  He doesn't want to play &quot;bad robot&quot; to Hogarth's pretend space hero, he wants to be Superman!  You can't help but like the big lug.The movie is well-written, with a lot of absolutely hilarious comedy as well as some real tear-jerker moments.  The quality of the animation is top-notch, especially the scene near the end when the Giant (who can fly) is being confronted by three VERY well-drawn F-86 Sabre jets.An EXCELLENT movie, which everyone can enjoy.

The youngster then  teaches his special pal to communicate while hiding him from both his  mother and the diabolical forces of the uncomprehending military industrial  complex which are bent on the interloper's total annihilation.Sound  familiar? Say one thing for &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;: if you have to  model your tale on an earlier film, you could do a lot worse than choose  Steven Spielberg's timeless masterpiece, &quot;E.T. - the  Extraterrestrial.&quot; The good news too is that, derivative as this new  film is - it plays at times almost like a scene-by-scene remake of the  previous film - &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is quite a charmer in its own  right as well. It is a rare pleasure to see an animated film so rooted in  the real world. So many of them take us to such exotic places - for the  obvious reason that animated films, by their very nature, simply CAN - that  all too often we feel distanced from what is taking place on the screen  before us. By setting this film in the recognizable world of 1950's  America, the makers establish a tone of unfrenetic charm and tranquility  that plays well as a background for the sci-fi elements of the tale. The  film also becomes a beautiful reflection on the strange coexistence of  scientific idealism and trepidation that took hold of the imagination in  that early era of space exploration and nuclear gamesmanship - an uneasy  amalgam that found its way into many of the science fiction films of the  time.The dialogue in the film enhances the gentle tone of the story  without resorting to either maudlin sentimentalilty or sardonic cynicism.  Hogarth, the boy, is simply a curious, well intentioned young lad, a bit  smarter than most perhaps but not a budding genius (one of the wittiest  lines comes when he bemoans the fact that other boys tease him because he  is so much smarter than them when really the only difference is that he  STUDIES). &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; manages to instill a number of such  subtle life lessons as these without straining the point or becoming  pedantic about it - although the &quot;guns kill&quot; theme, obviously  designed to infuriate NRA members, does come across as a bit  heavyhanded.The use of widescreen yields a number of tremendously  beautiful moments of visual splendour, and the giant himself is especially  impressive. Again, though, the animation is always placed at the service of  the material; we are not subjected to a barrage of meaningless flashy  images for their own sweet sake. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; may feel overly  familiar - and it will never replace &quot;E.T.&quot; as the definitive  version of this story - but it is definitely a film well worth seeing, an  animated film that will indeed appeal to audiences of all ages.",4,nifty animated tale,964742400,"07 28, 2000",2000,2898,"['young', 'boy', 'living', 'suburbia', 'single-parent', 'mother', 'benign', 'outer', 'space', 'alien', 'nearby', 'forest', 'youngster', 'then', 'special', 'pal', 'communicate', 'hiding', 'mother', 'diabolical', 'forces', 'uncomprehending', 'military', 'industrial', 'complex', 'are', 'bent', 'interloper', 'total', 'annihilation.Sound', 'familiar', 'Say', 'one', 'thing', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'have', 'model', 'tale', 'earlier', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'choose', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'timeless', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'E.T', 'Extraterrestrial.', 'quot', 'good', 'news', 'too', 'derivative', 'new', 'film', 'times', 'almost', 'scene-by-scene', 'remake', 'previous', 'film', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'quite', 'charmer', 'own', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'rare', 'pleasure', 'see', 'animated', 'film', 'so', 'rooted', 'real', 'world', 'So', 'many', 'take', 'such', 'exotic', 'places', 'obvious', 'reason', 'animated', 'films', 'very', 'nature', 'simply', 'CAN', 'too', 'often', 'feel', 'distanced', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'setting', 'film', 'recognizable', 'world', '1950', 'America', 'makers', 'establish', 'tone', 'unfrenetic', 'charm', 'tranquility', 'well', 'background', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'tale', 'film', 'also', 'beautiful', 'reflection', 'strange', 'coexistence', 'scientific', 'idealism', 'trepidation', 'took', 'hold', 'imagination', 'early', 'era', 'space', 'exploration', 'nuclear', 'gamesmanship', 'uneasy', 'amalgam', 'found', 'way', 'many', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'time.The', 'dialogue', 'film', 'gentle', 'tone', 'story', 'resorting', 'maudlin', 'sentimentalilty', 'sardonic', 'cynicism', 'Hogarth', 'boy', 'simply', 'curious', 'well', 'intentioned', 'young', 'lad', 'bit', 'smarter', 'most', 'perhaps', 'not', 'budding', 'genius', 'one', 'wittiest', 'lines', 'when', 'fact', 'other', 'boys', 'tease', 'so', 'much', 'smarter', 'when', 'really', 'only', 'difference', 'STUDIES', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'instill', 'number', 'such', 'subtle', 'life', 'lessons', 'straining', 'point', 'becoming', 'pedantic', 'quot', 'guns', 'kill', 'quot', 'theme', 'obviously', 'designed', 'infuriate', 'NRA', 'members', 'come', 'bit', 'heavyhanded.The', 'use', 'widescreen', 'yields', 'number', 'tremendously', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'visual', 'splendour', 'giant', 'especially', 'impressive', 'Again', 'though', 'animation', 'always', 'placed', 'service', 'material', 'are', 'not', 'subjected', 'barrage', 'meaningless', 'flashy', 'images', 'own', 'sweet', 'sake', 'quot', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'quot', 'may', 'feel', 'overly', 'familiar', 'will', 'never', 'replace', 'quot', 'E.T.', 'quot', 'definitive', 'version', 'story', 'definitely', 'film', 'well', 'seeing', 'animated', 'film', 'will', 'indeed', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'ages']",The Iron Giant

The commentary is the only truly noteworthy aspect of this release, and it stars Brad Bird as well as three other people heavily involved in the project.  That should make fans happy, and it's long overdue (the story of Warner's unwillingness to fund the project from day one is well-known).  Sadly, the other features are fairly mediocre and uninformative.  The hidden-in-plain-sight Easter Eggs involve about 45 seconds of material, the deleted scenes are a pastiche of storyboard material given an animated halflife (fair enough, given the medium, I suppose), and just generally feels tacked on (Quote alert!).The print and audio quality are good, however, so that shouldn't be a concern.  And like I said, it's a brilliant film that-- given the current state of US affairs-- is as timely as timeless.  And its initial price is lower than the original DVD release!

Then when you actually see the film you wonder why there aren't time-machines so you can go back and get the few hours you just wasted on seeing it. Then there are movies like The Iron Giant; movies that slip under the radar and are pure diamonds in the ruff. This is a family movie that can be enjoyed by adults and children.The plot takes place in the 1950's during the height of the cold war when everyone is paranoid over nuclear attacks.Hogarth is an imaginative little boy being raised by his single mother. Left home alone while his mother works a late shift at her waitress job, Hogarth ventures off into the woods near his house and discovers and saves the life of the Iron Giant. The Iron Giant crash landed on earth from his war ridden planet. Hogarth develops a friendship with the metal giant but soon realizes he has a dangerous side. The Iron Giant reacts (in a big way) defensively against attacks. So in other words, if he feels threatened, he goes into a sort of auto pilot mode and will attack the threat no matter whom or what that threat is. The giant realizes that it almost attacked his best friend and promises to be like Super man; good and non violent.Naturally, it becomes rather difficult to conceal this large giant and a nosy government agent becomes suspicious thusly starts investigating the strange happenings that surrounds the giant. I don't want to tell too much about the plot because it's really a movie that you should see yourself. But it has such a beautiful message at the end. The animation is just superbly done.

'The Iron Giant' evokes the pop-culture bubbly effervescence of the 1950's, along with that era's nuclear paranoia.Hogarth Hughes is an imaginative pre-teen who apparently constantly finds forest creatures of all manners and brings them home to keep as pets, much to the chagrin of his single mother.  He befriends Dean, a beatnik with a big heart, who lives in and runs the local junkyard.  One night while home alone, Hogarth investigates the disappearance of his TV signal and finds a giant robot, whose glowing green eyes seem to indicate life inside.  Hogarth manages to keep the robot a secret for a while, teaching the creature to mimic human speech and dive into ponds, among other things.  Eventually, the odd happenings surrounding the giant prompt a government agent to investigate, causing the giant to be outed.In the end, thanks to some great voice acting by Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., and Vin Diesel (nearly unrecognizable as the giant), along with some very wonderful production design and masterful direction by Brad Bird, this film brings a marvelous message with it.

Brad Bird's ""The Iron Giant"" is a chronicle of such a bond - only the dog has been replaced by a giant robot from outer space. What results is a charming film full of wit and clever political commentary that outshines everything Disney has put out since ""Beauty and the Beast."" With the inclusion of G-Men, B-grade monster films, Cold War paranoia, beatniks, Sputnik, Superman comics, and nuclear bomb drills, ""The Iron Giant"" is also a loving tribute to the bygone 1950's.Amidst a sleepy Maine town nervous about the implication of a new Russian satellite in orbit, a giant robot arrives with no memory of who he is. At the outset, no one except a young boy named Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) knows of the iron stranger in their presence. Hogarth hides him from his snooping mother (Jennifer Aniston) and an annoying federal agent (Christopher McDonald) all the while dreaming of the possibilities a pet robot can provide to a young boy. As the two spend more time together, Hogarth discovers that his new companion may have been created for more dastardly purposes. Yet, through the friendship he shares with Hogarth, the Iron Giant discovers that he can exceed his programming and become what he chooses to be.The one element that elevates ""The Iron Giant"" from other recent animated fare is its sophistication of story. It does not simplify its material for the sake of young minds but instead challenges them to comprehend complex ideas and messages. This film is an ambitious attempt to educate viewers who were not even alive in the 1950's about that decade and an entertaining nostalgia trip for adults who actually lived through that unique period. In sum. ""The Iron Giant"" is a worthwhile film experience for young and old alike.",4,"""You can fly?

Though exciting in places the movie is never really scary since it soon becomes apparent that the giant is a friendly, helpful creation that needs to be protected by Hogarth not feared.  The 1950's setting is well realized from the Cold War fears to the kids' obsession with superhero comic books.  Several important themes are examined including the value of non-violence, the eternity of the soul and tolerance for beings that seem different. Some of these themes are presented subtly and others not so subtly.  Despite the sometimes serious ideas presented there are many scenes that are ""laugh out loud"" funny.The movie is welled voiced with Harry Connick Jr. perfect as Dean the beatnik/artist/scrap dealer and Jennifer Aniston  as Hogarth's attractive mother.  Hogarth is fully developed as a smart kid missing his dad, and enduring resentment from his less intelligent peers.  The movie is adapted from Ted Hughes' children's novella of the same name and though both are well rendered they are vastly different from each other.

By that I mean it doesn't conform to what has become the standard for American animation. For too long there has been a culture to imitate Disney's style.  Fox and  Dreamworks, but to name a few, have done this; to be fair, sometimes with  great success (Anastasia, Prince of Egypt) and sometimes not.  I admit that  I love these movies but would still like to see something slightly more  original. It seems that there has been a fear amongst film makers, that the  public won't accept anything else...wake up call!  Iron Giant has broken  this mould and given us one of the best  animated films ever.  There's no  singing or dancing; no cute little animals prancing around and the  animation even steps away from the genre's typified tradition of square  jaw, pouty lips and doughy eyes.  So what does this movie have then?  The  answer to that is simply &quot;everything!&quot;It is best not to look  at it in terms of it being an animated picture because this instantly  clouds the judgment on what it is capable of.  This film really is  different to your normal animated movies. The story is far more intelligent  and involving than most others; yet it still retains  a sense of fun and  innocence, qualities which have helped to make the genre so charming. The  films characters are also great and the interaction between them provides  many great moments.  It is somehow always easier to attatch yourself to an  animated character than a human acting the part, this is definately the  case with this movie.  This story, about a boy who discovers a huge robot  and befriends it, had more of an emotional effect on me than any other  film. Films rarely make me cry but this one definately brought a tear or  two to my eyes.The dvd itself doesn't let the side down either.  It  offers amazing 5.1 digital sound which picks up the tiniest of detail in  the movies stunning soundtrack, giving an enjoyable assault on your ears.

Throughout this, a government agent is on Hogarth's back the entire time, searching for the giant.

514005,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B000028U3R,Thomas Zabiega,"[0, 0]","My 6 year old son is into everything to do with robots.  I had no clue about this movie until I saw it listed as one of the 10 best robots in cinematic history.  I was surprised how wonderfully different this movie is from most children's movies out there.  In fact, it is the first time I saw my son have tears in his eyes at the end of a movie and that was not a bad thing because the tears are due to the amazing sacrifice of the robot.  It seems the movie will have a sad ending, but not quite.  I think many adults will enjoy it (as most action movies out there are much more childish than this film).  The story is one of humanity, the one of a robot who is set up to be a killing machine, but who does not want to kill.  It is a story of how things are not necessarily completely evil or good, that a person set up for evil can become good, and in the end self-sacrifice and heroism win.  This can be a great conversion starter about the important issue of true heroism, about willing to sacrifice even your life for your family and for others.  This is not like the dumb, horribly predictable endings of most children movies, including adult superhero movies like the Avengers. The ending of this movie has a lot of meaning and therefore is something many children will enjoy but will get a good message out of.  It is a surprisingly anti-war and anti-killing movie for a movie full of action and battle scenes worthy of any good superhero cartoon.  Rare to see a cartoon these days which kids can enjoy and also be taught about virtue at the same time.  My only negative comment is in regards to the use of some inappropriate words for a children's movie (&#34;Oh, Great Mother of G...&#34;) which were completely unnecessary, especially in a movie that teaches children some wonderful virtues to follow.

Rarely does an animated movie appeal to anything but children, and rarely does any other studio besides Disney put out anything worth viewing. Even Disney cannot seem to master their patented, one-dimensional creations any longer, leaving them nearly lifeless at the mercy of Pixar. So, who would have thought that a little movie titled ""The Iron Giant"" from Warner Bros. could trump them both? Beats the heck outta me...yet, somehow it makes sense.The age of the old Disney ""magic"" seems to be almost completely dead---murdered by the increasing number of pop culture references, dirty jokes, and sarcastic comments that are becoming a staple, if not a MUST, for animated features today. And even though Pixar has mastered that aforementioned art so well that adults are often more attracted to their movies than children, there still is something missing. You can add all the humor and CGI effects in the world, but you can't fabricate heart.""The Iron Giant"" isn't what it appears to be. From a distance, it looks like your run-of-the-mill cartoon---boy finds giant, giant turns out to be good, giant is misunderstood by everyone but boy, problem resolved in climatic hero sequence, everyone lives happily ever after---little substance, right? Wrong. It's way more than a cutesy corn-fest; ""The Iron Giant"" actually delves right into some of the biggest problems of our society.Set in the 1950's, after WWII, when the air reeked with cold war sentiments, ""The Iron Giant"" manages to deal with the preposterous goings-on of entire decades worth of history during the 87 minutes of this clever and engaging film. The whole story is centered upon the ignorant ""shoot first, ask questions later"" belief system that was unbelievably prevalent during the cold war. Not only that, but the movie pinpoints the mentality in which the use of guns is a panacea to ""protect"" human existence, when in all actuality, they only destroy it before it can even begin.It is quite possible that kids might not read as much into this movie, though...unless they have an unprecedented knowledge of the time period or society, in general. That's why it is incredible. It satisfies all ages but in an intelligent, classy manner. Kids will view ""The Iron Giant"" and become completely transfixed by the giant iron dude on the screen, while adults can pick up on subtle humor and meaningful subtext as they too are enamored by the characters. Also, the adult characters act and speak (not limiting themselves to G-rated language) like real people...but don't expect the vulgar innuendos of some other ""kid-friendly"" blockbusters. The dialogue here is actually appropriate in context, so instead of just throwing in some cursing for ""cool factor"", this movie's realism is strengthened by it.I have never seen a better acted (or scripted) animated movie. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, is instantly loveable for his wide-eyed enthusiasm, impish charm, and quick wit. Hogarth's mother (Jennifer Aniston) is an amazing addition to the movie because she offers a dose of reality that stereotypical cartoon moms do not have---a single mom trying to maintain her son and home by working a dead-end job at a diner. Then there's Dean (Harry Connick Jr.), the resident cool, free-thinking hipster, who befriends Hogarth and gives him and the giant a safe haven while becoming more and more of a father figure throughout the movie. And of course there's Giant, who is about as impossible to like as a super-sized puppy...well, except when he snaps...Even the villain in this movie is likeable (because great villains should be). Kent Mansley (Christopher MacDonald), the intruding government agent, is so hilarious in an understated way in almost every scene; it's hard not to like him a little. Calling Hogarth everything from ""Champ"" to ""Slugger"" in attempt to him win over into confessing his knowledge of the giant, Kent Mansley is the epitome of a charming, yet calculating numbskull.""The Iron Giant"" may not side-splitting, it may not be a tried-and-true cartoon love story, and it may not be an extravagant tale of adventure and magic...but jokes grow old, sugar-coated love creates cavities, and long journeys are tiresome. What the ""Giant"" has is genuine, real, and is worth more than a thousand cookie-cutter laughs.P.S. The army general, (John Mahoney), is a great supporting character. His interactions with Mansley are not to be overlooked---""Where's the giant, Mansley?!""",5,Not your kid brother's animated movie...,1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,4548,"['When', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'animated', 'movies', 'usually', 'think', 'one', 'two', 'things', '-kiddy', 'fodder', 'Disney', 'Rarely', 'animated', 'movie', 'appeal', 'anything', 'children', 'rarely', 'other', 'studio', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'anything', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Even', 'Disney', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'master', 'patented', 'one-dimensional', 'creations', 'longer', 'leaving', 'nearly', 'lifeless', 'mercy', 'Pixar', 'So', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'little', 'movie', 'titled', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'could', 'trump', 'Beats', 'heck', 'yet', 'somehow', 'sense.The', 'age', 'old', 'Disney', 'magic', 'be', 'almost', 'completely', 'dead', '-murdered', 'increasing', 'number', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'are', 'becoming', 'staple', 'not', 'MUST', 'animated', 'features', 'today', 'even', 'Pixar', 'mastered', 'aforementioned', 'art', 'so', 'well', 'adults', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'attracted', 'movies', 'children', 'still', 'something', 'missing', 'can', 'add', 'humor', 'CGI', 'effects', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fabricate', 'heart', 'Iron', 'Giant', ""n't"", 'what', 'be', 'distance', 'run-of-the-mill', 'cartoon', '-boy', 'finds', 'giant', 'giant', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'giant', 'misunderstood', 'everyone', 'boy', 'problem', 'resolved', 'climatic', 'hero', 'sequence', 'everyone', 'lives', 'happily', 'ever', '-little', 'substance', 'right', 'Wrong', 'way', 'more', 'cutesy', 'corn-fest', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'actually', 'right', 'biggest', 'problems', 'society.Set', '1950', 'WWII', 'when', 'air', 'reeked', 'cold', 'war', 'sentiments', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'deal', 'preposterous', 'goings-on', 'entire', 'decades', 'history', '87', 'minutes', 'clever', 'engaging', 'film', 'whole', 'story', 'centered', 'ignorant', 'shoot', 'first', 'ask', 'questions', 'later', 'belief', 'system', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'prevalent', 'cold', 'war', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'mentality', 'use', 'guns', 'panacea', 'protect', 'human', 'existence', 'when', 'actuality', 'only', 'destroy', 'can', 'even', 'begin.It', 'quite', 'possible', 'kids', 'might', 'not', 'read', 'much', 'movie', 'have', 'unprecedented', 'knowledge', 'time', 'period', 'society', 'general', 'why', 'incredible', 'ages', 'intelligent', 'classy', 'manner', 'Kids', 'will', 'view', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'become', 'completely', 'transfixed', 'giant', 'iron', 'dude', 'screen', 'adults', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'subtle', 'humor', 'meaningful', 'subtext', 'too', 'are', 'enamored', 'characters', 'Also', 'adult', 'characters', 'act', 'speak', 'not', 'limiting', 'G-rated', 'language', 'real', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'vulgar', 'innuendos', 'other', 'kid-friendly', 'blockbusters', 'dialogue', 'here', 'actually', 'appropriate', 'context', 'instead', 'just', 'throwing', 'cursing', 'cool', 'factor', 'movie', 'realism', 'strengthened', 'it.I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'better', 'acted', 'scripted', 'animated', 'movie', 'boy', 'Hogarth', 'Hughes', 'instantly', 'loveable', 'wide-eyed', 'enthusiasm', 'impish', 'charm', 'quick', 'wit', 'Hogarth', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'amazing', 'addition', 'movie', 'dose', 'reality', 'stereotypical', 'cartoon', 'moms', 'do', 'not', 'have', '-a', 'single', 'mom', 'trying', 'maintain', 'son', 'home', 'working', 'dead-end', 'job', 'diner', 'Then', 'Dean', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'resident', 'cool', 'free-thinking', 'hipster', 'who', 'Hogarth', 'giant', 'safe', 'haven', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'father', 'figure', 'movie', 'course', 'Giant', 'who', 'about', 'as', 'impossible', 'like', 'super-sized', 'puppy', 'well', 'when', 'Even', 'villain', 'movie', 'likeable', 'great', 'villains', 'should', 'be', 'Kent', 'Mansley', 'Christopher', 'MacDonald', 'intruding', 'government', 'agent', 'so', 'hilarious', 'understated', 'way', 'almost', 'scene', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'little', 'Calling', 'Hogarth', 'everything', 'Champ', 'Slugger', 'attempt', 'win', 'confessing', 'knowledge', 'giant', 'Kent', 'Mansley', 'epitome', 'charming', 'yet', 'calculating', 'numbskull', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'may', 'not', 'side-splitting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'tried-and-true', 'cartoon', 'love', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'extravagant', 'tale', 'adventure', 'magic', 'jokes', 'grow', 'old', 'sugar-coated', 'love', 'cavities', 'long', 'journeys', 'are', 'tiresome', 'What', 'Giant', 'genuine', 'real', 'more', 'thousand', 'cookie-cutter', 'laughs.P.S', 'army', 'general', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'great', 'supporting', 'character', 'interactions', 'Mansley', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Where', 'giant', 'Mansley']",The Iron Giant

When Hogarth discovers the Iron Giant, the pair form a true friendship, beginning from the moment Hogarth saves the IG from being short-circuited by electrical cables to the end, when it is the IG's turn to prove his allegiance and love for his human friend.Despite the fantasy premise, there is just something so incredibly genuine and heartwarming in this story that appeals to me, even after all these years since its release back in '99 and I was so happy when my 4.5-year-old liked it too, which goes to show this is an animated feature that can appeal to a broad range of ages.I plan to buy a copy for my animated features library - it's an evergreen classic that I believe will stand the test of time.",5,A classic story of friendship,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,960,"['essence', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'young', 'Hogarth', '[', 'Eli', 'Marienthal', ']', 'Iron', 'Giant', '[', 'Vin', 'Diesel', ']', 'hulking', 'fighter', 'robot', 'Earth', ""'forgets"", 'real', 'purpose', 'i.e', 'killing', 'machine', 'When', 'Hogarth', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'pair', 'form', 'true', 'friendship', 'beginning', 'moment', 'Hogarth', 'IG', 'being', 'short-circuited', 'electrical', 'cables', 'end', 'when', 'IG', 'turn', 'prove', 'allegiance', 'love', 'human', 'friend.Despite', 'fantasy', 'premise', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'incredibly', 'genuine', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'appeals', 'even', 'years', 'release', 'back', ""'99"", 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', '4.5-year-old', 'liked', 'too', 'show', 'animated', 'feature', 'can', 'appeal', 'broad', 'range', 'ages.I', 'plan', 'buy', 'copy', 'animated', 'features', 'library', 'evergreen', 'classic', 'believe', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",The Iron Giant
