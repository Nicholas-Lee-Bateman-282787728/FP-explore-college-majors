They recently watched some of Indiana Jones and have been obsessed with him.  Having Mickey be an adventurer like Indiana Jones was so cool to them.  I thought the episode was super cute and didn't mind watching it.  It did feel though like a movie and was a refreshing episode to watch.  Now in case your wondering, this DVD features episodes of the show, not a whole movie.Quest for the Crystal MickeyDonald of the DesertDonald the GenieGoofy's Coconutty MonkeyGoofy's Giant AdventureThe ""Quest for the Crystal Mickey"" is just one episode on the DVD, along with four others.  They are all episodes that your child may have seen on tv already but I love how they are all on one DVD.  It is nice to be able to put on this wholesome show whenever your child wants it.  Honestly we have a few other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs and this is my favorite because of the Quest for the Crystal Mickey episode.  It is just such a fun episode full of the gang going on an adventurer against sneaky Pete.  Very cute and age appropriate for preschoolers.I received this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",5,Our Favorite Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVD so far!,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,1240,"['boys', 'are', 'starting', 'watch', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'show', 'less', 'less', 'get', 'older', 'DVD', 'got', 'hooked', 'again', 'recently', 'watched', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'have', 'been', 'obsessed', 'Having', 'Mickey', 'be', 'adventurer', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'thought', 'episode', 'was', 'super', 'cute', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'did', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'refreshing', 'episode', 'watch', 'Now', 'case', 'wondering', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'show', 'not', 'whole', 'movie.Quest', 'Crystal', 'MickeyDonald', 'DesertDonald', 'GenieGoofy', 'Coconutty', 'MonkeyGoofy', 'Giant', 'AdventureThe', 'Quest', 'Crystal', 'Mickey', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'DVD', 'four', 'others', 'are', 'episodes', 'child', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'tv', 'already', 'love', 'how', 'are', 'one', 'DVD', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'wholesome', 'show', 'whenever', 'child', 'Honestly', 'have', 'few', 'other', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'DVDs', 'favorite', 'Quest', 'Crystal', 'Mickey', 'episode', 'just', 'such', 'fun', 'full', 'gang', 'going', 'adventurer', 'sneaky', 'Pete', 'Very', 'cute', 'age', 'appropriate', 'preschoolers.I', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', 'exchange', 'honest', 'opinion']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Quest for the Crystal Mickey
1635272,A3V5F050GVZ56Q,B00BK8E4D0,Dre,"[17, 18]","My girls (ages 3 and 6) love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD. The show is great and a big hit in our house. It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of subjects through the gang's adventures and interaction with your child. This particular episode has been very popular in our house since it came out this year.  My 3 year old is always asking for ""Crystal Mickey"".Quest for the Crystal Mickey is a fun episode about the gang searching for a magical statue in order to save the Clubhouse.  They go on an adventure through jungles and over rivers, all while avoiding that pesky Pete's traps.  It has a very ""Indiana Jones"" feel to the episode which is fun for parents too.This DVD contains the main title episode plus four great bonus episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:1. Quest for the Crystal Mickey2. Donald of the Desert - Donald and the gang go to the desert to get sand for the clubhouse sandbox.3. Donald the Genie - Donald becomes a genie and grants a wish to each friend.4. Goofy's Coconutty Monkey - The gang searches for coconuts with Coco the Monkey.5. Goofy's Giant Adventure - Goofy searches for a special elixir to cure Willie the Giant's upset tummy.We use cartoon DVDs for car trips and these popular episodes are perfect for our collection.

1635273,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B00BK8E4D0,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[3, 4]","The nicest thing about the new ""Quest for the Crystal Mickey"" DVD collection of episodes from ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" is that Disney fans might notice a little nod to Walt himself.I won't give it away, but I will give a clue that it has something to do with Walt's early career and Mickey's name in the signature episode.""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" is a preschooler CG series along the lines of ""Blue's Clues"" and ""Dora the Explorer."" Regular cast Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Pluto share a basic storyline with visits from other Disney favorites like Ludwig Von Drake, Chip 'n Dale, Clarabelle Cow and Pete, who serves as a villain or just a misguided soul.""The Quest for the Crystal Mickey"" epsode boasts probably the most intricate of all the plots, but that's okay since kids love the repetition and parents can catch the mild in-jokes (it's not quite as edgy as Sesame Street).A friendly gadget called Toodles provides objects in each episode that help solve the problem. There's always a mystery tool that is revealed near the end. Kids can follow Mickey and the gang and help them figure things out, also doing some counting, colors, shapes, concepts and things like that.One of two original songs highlight each episode. There's also a nice soundtrack album on CD or download on amazon and iTunes.Some may find this a watered-down version of Mickey, but it's a great way for very young children to get to know the characters on an everyday TV basis rather than waiting for the occasional cartoon (as it was in my day).Mickey Mouse should mean more to kids than just being a corporate icon and theme park greeter. For a long time, that's pretty much what he was, though that's okay for some. Children saw him in merchandise and his basic shape clearly appeals to them. But I like that kids are relating to him as a character, he same way they do to other preschool TV characters.EPISODE GUIDE TO""MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE: QUEST FOR THE CRYSTAL MICKEY""The overall theme seems to be grand adventures in faraway lands, but each episode was obviously chosen to focus on a different learning skill as well.Episode 60 (Season 2)Goofy's Coconutty MonkeyOctober 5, 2009Goofy's monkey friend wants to have a party but first everyone helps find the missing coconuts.Episode 74 (Season 3)Goofy's Giant AdventureMay 9, 2011Willie the giant (from the ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" segment of the Disney animated feature ""Fun and Fancy Free"" needs help from the gang in this story.Episode 75 (Season 3)Donald of the DesertMay 8, 2010Donald finds a genie lamp and learns the wisdom of the old phrase, ""be careful what you wish for.""Episode 98 (Season 3)Donald the GenieOctober 18, 2010Donald becomes a genie himself in this story.Episode 121 (Season 4)Quest for the Crystal MickeyMarch 8, 2013Pete has stolen the Crystal Mickey in the this episode from the most recent season and its disappearance threatens to make the Clubhouse disappear.",4,Nice Walt Disney reference in the latest Mickey Mouse DVD,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,2930,"['nicest', 'thing', 'new', 'Quest', 'Crystal', 'Mickey', 'DVD', 'collection', 'episodes', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'Disney', 'fans', 'might', 'notice', 'little', 'nod', 'Walt', 'himself.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'will', 'give', 'clue', 'something', 'do', 'Walt', 'early', 'career', 'Mickey', 'name', 'signature', 'episode', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'preschooler', 'CG', 'series', 'lines', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'Regular', 'cast', 'Mickey', 'Minnie', 'Donald', 'Daisy', 'Pluto', 'share', 'basic', 'storyline', 'visits', 'other', 'Disney', 'favorites', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Drake', 'Chip', 'n', 'Dale', 'Clarabelle', 'Cow', 'Pete', 'who', 'villain', 'just', 'misguided', 'soul', 'Quest', 'Crystal', 'Mickey', 'epsode', 'probably', 'most', 'intricate', 'plots', 'okay', 'kids', 'love', 'repetition', 'parents', 'can', 'catch', 'mild', 'in-jokes', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'edgy', 'Sesame', 'Street', '.A', 'friendly', 'gadget', 'called', 'Toodles', 'objects', 'episode', 'help', 'solve', 'problem', 'always', 'mystery', 'tool', 'revealed', 'end', 'Kids', 'can', 'follow', 'Mickey', 'gang', 'help', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'also', 'doing', 'counting', 'colors', 'shapes', 'concepts', 'things', 'that.One', 'two', 'original', 'songs', 'highlight', 'episode', 'also', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'CD', 'download', 'amazon', 'iTunes.Some', 'may', 'find', 'watered-down', 'version', 'Mickey', 'great', 'way', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'everyday', 'TV', 'basis', 'rather', 'waiting', 'occasional', 'cartoon', 'was', 'day', '.Mickey', 'Mouse', 'should', 'mean', 'more', 'kids', 'just', 'being', 'corporate', 'icon', 'theme', 'park', 'greeter', 'long', 'time', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'okay', 'Children', 'saw', 'merchandise', 'basic', 'shape', 'clearly', 'appeals', 'like', 'kids', 'are', 'relating', 'character', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'other', 'preschool', 'TV', 'characters.EPISODE', 'GUIDE', 'TO', 'MICKEY', 'MOUSE', 'CLUBHOUSE', 'QUEST', 'THE', 'CRYSTAL', 'MICKEY', 'overall', 'theme', 'be', 'grand', 'adventures', 'faraway', 'lands', 'episode', 'was', 'obviously', 'chosen', 'focus', 'different', 'learning', 'skill', 'well.Episode', '60', 'Season', '2', 'Goofy', 'Coconutty', 'MonkeyOctober', '5', '2009Goofy', 'monkey', 'friend', 'have', 'party', 'first', 'everyone', 'find', 'missing', 'coconuts.Episode', '74', 'Season', '3', 'Goofy', 'Giant', 'AdventureMay', '9', '2011Willie', 'giant', 'Mickey', 'Beanstalk', 'segment', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'Fun', 'Fancy', 'Free', 'help', 'gang', 'story.Episode', '75', 'Season', '3', 'Donald', 'DesertMay', '8', '2010Donald', 'genie', 'lamp', 'wisdom', 'old', 'phrase', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'Episode', '98', 'Season', '3', 'Donald', 'GenieOctober', '18', '2010Donald', 'genie', 'story.Episode', '121', 'Season', '4', 'Quest', 'Crystal', 'MickeyMarch', '8', '2013Pete', 'stolen', 'Crystal', 'Mickey', 'episode', 'most', 'recent', 'season', 'disappearance', 'make', 'Clubhouse', 'disappear']",Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Quest for the Crystal Mickey
