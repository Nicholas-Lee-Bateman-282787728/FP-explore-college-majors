Underacted by Franco (probably on purpose, but it doesn't work). Some of the dogfights were quite good, except for the cutaways to the actors ... especially when one would give the slightest nod of the chin to let the other guy know he &#34;understood&#34; .... from 100 yards away at 150mph, while someone was shooting at them. It's paying attention to detail that makes a good movie. This didn't have it. The only reason it got 2 stars from me was for the actors that played the American Ace and the French commander.

1036075,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B000KX0HIC,AbeStreet,"[0, 1]","To begin with I&#8217;ll state that I found this film to be highly enjoyable.  I know it bombed at the box office and was rated poorly by many critics but I can&#8217;t help it, this is a good film.  There are a couple of ways to evaluate this film and I&#8217;ll list them below.1. Historic perspective:  As many reviewers have indicated in previous reviews this film suffers from many inaccuracies.  For true history and war film buffs this may ruin the film them.  Myself, I knew very little of the details, other than the German planes were not colored correctly, and so the story line kept me interested.  In fact, this film sparked such an interest in the story of the Lafayette Escadrille that I did a lot of research reading on the topic.  I would encourage people to read up on the actual events and people.2. Film locations & special effects:  I&#8217;m thought the costume design, set locations, props, flying sequences, and special effects were extremely well done.  I was completely sold on the time period and setting in which this film takes place.  No doubt the film relied on CG animation for some of the fight scenes.  These effects were so well done that there is no jarring juxtaposition from real life to animation that the viewer is momentarily distracted from the film&#8217;s story.3. Story:  I found the story to be very good.  Not overly complex but that does not mean it is a simple color by number type story.  The supporting characters are given enough attention and screen time, some more than others, that the viewer is emotionally connected to their fates.Lastly, I would say that the main reason this film works for me is that I&#8217;m drawn into the story.  The writing was good, the acting was good, and the story was believable.  Special Effects, good sets, and costume design don&#8217;t make a good film, think PEARL HARBOR (2001).  The story is the thing that links all these other things together and this film links them together pretty well.",4,Time well spent!!!!!,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,1984,"['begin', '8217', 'state', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'know', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'rated', 'poorly', 'many', 'critics', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'ways', 'evaluate', 'film', '8217', 'list', 'below.1', 'Historic', 'perspective', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'indicated', 'previous', 'reviews', 'film', 'suffers', 'many', 'inaccuracies', 'true', 'history', 'war', 'film', 'buffs', 'may', 'ruin', 'film', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'details', 'other', 'German', 'planes', 'were', 'not', 'colored', 'correctly', 'so', 'story', 'line', 'kept', 'interested', 'fact', 'film', 'sparked', 'interest', 'story', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'did', 'lot', 'research', 'reading', 'topic', 'would', 'encourage', 'people', 'read', 'up', 'actual', 'events', 'people.2', 'Film', 'locations', 'special', 'effects', '8217', 'thought', 'costume', 'design', 'set', 'locations', 'props', 'flying', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'completely', 'sold', 'time', 'period', 'setting', 'film', 'place', 'doubt', 'film', 'relied', 'CG', 'animation', 'fight', 'scenes', 'effects', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'jarring', 'juxtaposition', 'real', 'life', 'animation', 'viewer', 'momentarily', 'distracted', 'film', '8217', 'story.3', 'Story', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Not', 'overly', 'complex', 'not', 'mean', 'simple', 'color', 'number', 'type', 'story', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'enough', 'attention', 'screen', 'time', 'more', 'others', 'viewer', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'fates.Lastly', 'would', 'say', 'main', 'reason', 'film', '8217', 'drawn', 'story', 'writing', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'believable', 'Special', 'Effects', 'good', 'sets', 'costume', 'design', 'don', '8217', 't', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'think', 'PEARL', 'HARBOR', '2001', 'story', 'thing', 'other', 'things', 'together', 'film', 'together', 'pretty', 'well']",N/A

The movie could have had some help at the box office if it had a different name (Flyboys sounds dumb to me) and more advertising leading up to its release. When viewing the movie you cant find fault with the acting. Everyone does a good job. The plot and writing arent perfect but get the point across. The bond between the men as they battle together works well. The romance though is the key here for me. We have two people that speak different languages and they fall in love. Its the heart of the movie in my opinion. The action is great, though I could argue that the dogfighting is too short. You just get the blood pumping and that particular fight ends too soon. The battles could have been longer but they are well executed.

1036077,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000KX0HIC,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The film starts with a view of the heavens. The recently invented flying machine was adopted by armies as an observation platform that was better than the earlier tethered balloon. In September 1914 an observation airplane saw the German flanking attack, they were able to stop it at the first Battle of the Marne using the taxis of Paris (fast mechanized deployment). The way to stop observation airplanes was to shoot them down with another armed airplane. First rifles, then machine guns. The way to stop an armed fighter was with another armed fighter. Bombing was another development, as well as anti-aircraft guns. Trench warfare prevented the maneuvers used by generals of the past. A stalemate followed.A young man in Texas wants to get out of town. Another leaves Nebraska for ""The War to End War"". An American boxer joins the Lafayette Escadrille. So too a dropout from Harvard. The men meet their mascot ""Whiskey"" and the issue of racism. The men undergo elementary training in flying and tactics. The average life of a pilot was six weeks. The German Air Force predominated in 1916. Fighters will accompany Handley-Page bombers to attack German supplies. No parachutes for pilots. ""Beware of the Hun in the sun!"" There is a dogfight, some are shot down. One flyer seeks love. There is a pleasant scene. Then they are scrambled to pursue German bombers. Another dogfight with wins and losses.One flyer returns to see a girlfriend. There is a drama in the history of one flyer. Why did he miss his target? A flight of Fokkers attacked a town, the Lafayette Escadrille comes to the rescue. One pilot lands in No Man's Land, and is rescued in an incredible manner. Was the war meaningless? Who will win? Can one flyer rescue his girlfriend? [Did anyone fly at night then?] It was a dramatic rescue. ""Don't ever do that again!"" Next they attack a Zeppelin. [These bombed London at night.] The film shows the effects of machine gun fire on the pilots and airplanes. The hospital is being evacuated. Will they meet again? There is another mission to attack Jametz. This time it will be a flanking attack to surprise the enemy with escorted bombers. There is another dogfight to let the bombers get through. There is a last dogfight between the fighter airplanes. Will the good guy survive? The last scenes tell about the flyer's future.This is a good film in spite of the story. This film uses CGI to recreate the known past. A better story makes a better film. You may find a book about this subject educational. Hollywood provides entertainment, not history.

1036078,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B000KX0HIC,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","There's something both romantic and intimidating about the mechanized slaughter that plagued Europe at the beginning of the 20th century during what that generation called 'the GREAT War' and we call World War One. While French and Germans were slaughtering each other on the ground by the millions with the help of first generation tanks, early model machine guns and clouds of mustard gas, some privileged few were confronting their enemies in the air, riding on small, fragile, underpowered but deadly airplanes, trying to obliterate opponents riding the same or protecting/attacking bomb-carrying larger, motorized flying machines or giant, bloated, terror-inspiring airships.It's a historical fact that a handful of American took sides in this battle at a time their own country, the United States, was officially neutral. They decided to help the French side by forming their own Escadrille Lafayette of flying knights. The Escadrille, famous for its bravery AND its partying while off duty, distinguished itself at Verdun and many of its members were recognized as Aces, some receiving valuable French medals for bravery.The movie attempts to follow, to the extent that a fiction movie can, the historical record. We see the initial members as they make their decision to fight for France, we watch them train and then we watch them fight the Germans. It's fighter vs. fighter, fighter attacking the enemy's bombers, fighter protecting their own bombers, fighter attacking the Zeppelin and fighter strafing the enemy air base and, on several occasions, we watch air duels between Aces on either side. In addition, there is some romance, a tiny bit of racial tension and we watch some personal problems as they are dealt with by the squad's members.This is a very visual, CGI enhanced to the point of almost cartoonish-looking movie when it comes to the numerous dogfight scenes and its most attractive feature is the air battles. The scruffy and fragile-looking French fighters, the intimidating, red-colored German Fokkers, the bombers, the Zeppelin, they all look spectacular in ways that only today's video enhancement technologies can produce. One may conclude that, maybe there's too much fighting and too little character development but this is not a psychological drama. It's about aerial fighting and this is what we get to see in a movie that comes pretty close to being a WW1 documentary. All the little conflicts between the squad's members or between them and the French military or the other American volunteers are insignificant when viewed within the context of the war against the Germans.The movie is good at what it attempts to deliver - in this case, the dogfights -  but, after a while, the fighting gets repetitive and the movie seems to be stretching a bit too long. This is as close to a pure dogfight action movie as it gets.Recommended as a rental or even as a keeper for any lover of war action videos.P.S. While many of the details are fictionalized enhancements or pure inventions, it is historically true that the squadron had lions as pets. The movie shows us one. In fact, they had TWO lion cubs named Whiskey and Soda.",3,Watchable World War One Dogfight Movie,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,3158,"['something', 'romantic', 'intimidating', 'mechanized', 'slaughter', 'plagued', 'Europe', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'what', 'generation', 'called', ""'the"", 'GREAT', 'War', 'call', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'French', 'Germans', 'were', 'slaughtering', 'other', 'ground', 'millions', 'help', 'first', 'generation', 'tanks', 'early', 'model', 'machine', 'guns', 'clouds', 'mustard', 'gas', 'privileged', 'few', 'were', 'confronting', 'enemies', 'air', 'riding', 'small', 'fragile', 'underpowered', 'deadly', 'airplanes', 'trying', 'obliterate', 'opponents', 'riding', 'same', 'protecting/attacking', 'bomb-carrying', 'larger', 'motorized', 'flying', 'machines', 'giant', 'bloated', 'terror-inspiring', 'airships.It', 'historical', 'fact', 'handful', 'American', 'took', 'sides', 'battle', 'time', 'own', 'country', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'officially', 'neutral', 'decided', 'help', 'French', 'side', 'forming', 'own', 'Escadrille', 'Lafayette', 'flying', 'knights', 'Escadrille', 'famous', 'bravery', 'partying', 'duty', 'distinguished', 'Verdun', 'many', 'members', 'were', 'recognized', 'Aces', 'receiving', 'valuable', 'French', 'medals', 'bravery.The', 'movie', 'attempts', 'follow', 'extent', 'fiction', 'movie', 'can', 'historical', 'record', 'see', 'initial', 'members', 'make', 'decision', 'fight', 'France', 'watch', 'train', 'then', 'watch', 'fight', 'Germans', 'fighter', 'vs.', 'fighter', 'fighter', 'attacking', 'enemy', 'bombers', 'fighter', 'protecting', 'own', 'bombers', 'fighter', 'attacking', 'Zeppelin', 'fighter', 'strafing', 'enemy', 'air', 'base', 'several', 'occasions', 'watch', 'air', 'duels', 'Aces', 'side', 'addition', 'romance', 'tiny', 'bit', 'racial', 'tension', 'watch', 'personal', 'problems', 'are', 'dealt', 'squad', 'members.This', 'very', 'visual', 'CGI', 'enhanced', 'point', 'almost', 'cartoonish-looking', 'movie', 'when', 'numerous', 'dogfight', 'scenes', 'most', 'attractive', 'feature', 'air', 'scruffy', 'fragile-looking', 'French', 'fighters', 'intimidating', 'red-colored', 'German', 'Fokkers', 'bombers', 'Zeppelin', 'look', 'spectacular', 'ways', 'only', 'today', 'video', 'enhancement', 'technologies', 'can', 'produce', 'One', 'may', 'conclude', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'fighting', 'too', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'psychological', 'drama', 'aerial', 'fighting', 'what', 'get', 'see', 'movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'being', 'WW1', 'documentary', 'little', 'conflicts', 'squad', 'members', 'French', 'military', 'other', 'American', 'volunteers', 'are', 'insignificant', 'when', 'viewed', 'context', 'war', 'Germans.The', 'movie', 'good', 'what', 'deliver', 'case', 'dogfights', 'while', 'fighting', 'repetitive', 'movie', 'be', 'stretching', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'as', 'close', 'pure', 'dogfight', 'action', 'movie', 'gets.Recommended', 'rental', 'even', 'keeper', 'lover', 'war', 'action', 'videos.P.S', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'fictionalized', 'enhancements', 'pure', 'inventions', 'historically', 'true', 'squadron', 'had', 'lions', 'pets', 'movie', 'one', 'fact', 'had', 'TWO', 'lion', 'cubs', 'named', 'Whiskey', 'Soda']",N/A

Period.In fact, it's so full of historical, scientific, military, and logical inaccuracies that it's almost laughable. I won't even bother to list them all, although there is one particular inaccuracy that I *must* point out, because it is stunningly, mind-bogglingly asinine: More than once in the movie, several of the protagonists are flying in formation, and they shout across to one another -- and on one occasion, they even have a  moderately lengthy conversation in this manner.Well, I have flown in an open-cockpit biplane, so I can assure you from personal experience that such a conversation is absolutely, completely and totally *impossible*. I flew as a passenger in a two-seater, with a friend squeezed into the front cockpit beside me (with his brother, the pilot, behind us), and we *tried* to converse by shouting at the top of our lungs -- literally, *directly* into each other's ears, from a distance of less than an inch -- and neither of us could hear a single damned word.Even if you  haven't had the experience, it's really quite easy to understand. When you are sitting in an open-cockpit biplane, the wind is roaring past you at somewhere between 150-200mph, and there is a tremendous, screaming engine right in front of you. You can't hear *anything* but that engine. That's why in the Real World -- the historically accurate one, as opposed to the idiotic Hollywood caricature of it -- *REAL* WWI pilots communicated solely by hand signals or the occasional flare gun.So every time this movie shows you pilots shouting across to each other, it is insulting your intelligence. The only way it could have been *more* absurd is if they were having these shouted fighter-to-fighter conversations in the vacuum of outer space.To that kind of idiocy, add ham-handed direction, acting that swings from utterly lifeless to inexplicably melodramatic with no apparent connection to whatever is transpiring, and a contrived and imbecilic story full of plot holes bigger than the Death Star / Zeppelin featured in the big climactic fight scene (in which innumerable laws of physics were violated).The result is garbage.

1036097,A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB,B000KX0HIC,"ANT ""azraelart""","[1, 1]","This movie could have been so much better than it was.  Still, I think the pros just BARELY outweigh the cons, so if you want to see it, it's entirely up to you.  I think there are some good qualities to be enjoyed here, but just be prepared to sit through some dull moments, uninspired dialogue, and formulaic nonsense.PROS:* Rarity: There aren't many WWI movies made these days, and particularly after the recent glut of WWII films (of which I am very thankful for... mostly).  Even harder to find are aerial combat movies that focus on this period of history.  Fighter and bomber planes were very new to the scene, and seeing as how the airplane had really only be &#34;invented&#34; less than a decade before the war broke out, it was astonishing to think of how quickly the technology progressed.* Air Combat: Given the lack of working planes from that era still in service (no surprise), I thought they did a decent job of marrying actual planes (repros and one or two originals) with the CGI scenes.  I'm not sure how I feel about the smoke tracers on nearly every bullet, but whatever.  It was intense at times, mostly believable, and certainly action-packed.* Acting: For a group comprising of James Franco, Jean Reno, and a long list of somewhat unknowns, the acting was actually pretty decent.  Franco certainly held his own, and he definitely seemed to take on his role pretty thoroughly.  It was pretty good across the board, but not really worthy of any awards for best of the year.  But, better than many!* History: For all of the inaccuracies, the movie did venture into the historical non-fiction realm quite nicely from time to time.  It was interested to see how families were brutally altered by this terrible war.  The stance of the US was also a focus now and then, and it was interesting to see why people chose to volunteer.CONS:* Dialogue: Okay, it wasn't atrocious, but it was stymied and choppy a lot of the time.  How many 'courageous' speeches can Reno give before the boys go into battle?  How many times do Franco and Henderson have to have the same exact conversation about how bad-ass/mopey the other is?  Don't get me started on the romance, which, by the way... totally unnecessary.* Plot: Um... where was it?  There was something about... um... Americans.  Joining up with the... uh... French?  Along side the English?  Yeah, I think so.  And they were in France.  And there was this war going on.  Oh, and I'm sure there was unnecessary and probably grotesquely fictitious romances that sprung up across the countryside.  Seriously!  What plot?  It was a mish-mesh of jumbled pithy platitudes simmered in a time period of war, and it had so much potential to focus on that and be something more!  But, alas...* Accuracy: Enough people have already torn this to shreds for the false history, so I'll leave it at that, but I have to say, I was a bit disappointed.  I am by no means an expert on WWI history, but I know enough to recognize that the Fokker tri-planes were VERY rare and interspersed throughout the squadrons.  And only one was every all-red.  And that was the Red Baron's squadron.  To say nothing of the planes the Allies flew, or the engines, paint schemes, etc.  I guess when your ONE MILITARY ADVISER turned out to be a FRAUD, you have to take what you get.* Formulaic: Nothing new here.  The guy that is vaguely racist of course gets his life saved by a person of color.  Every &#34;watch out for...,&#34; &#34;be sure to remember...,&#34; and &#34;don't forget to...&#34; will come back in some way, shape, or form, don't you worry.  You can predict the ending to each vignette before it really gets underway.  And that's unfortunate, really; I thought we'd finally gotten away from the standard formula.* Scare Tactics: Okay, I get it.  Starting an engine on a WWI-era plane was a noisy prospect.  Stop blowing out my eardrum every chance you get, and completely out of nowhere!  There's no excuse for that!  You're not making a horror movie (right?), you're supposed to be telling a dramatic story set in a key moment of European and American history.Overall, I really was quite disappointed in how they really dropped the ball in certain key areas.  I really want to give this three stars for the efforts made in certain spots in the film.  Overall, though, it crashes (pun intended) due to flimsy structure and obnoxious laziness on the part of the filmmakers.  What could (and should) have been a solid offering in the genre instead turned into a blotch in an otherwise glowing resume.  Worth seeing?  Yeah, I think so.

1036099,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B000KX0HIC,Anthony Hand,"[14, 21]","Looking through the past reviews of this film / DVD I am  forced to wonder what film some other reviewers were watching. I cannot imagine anybody above the age of 20 finding this film either entertaining or convincing. I find it impossible to recommend anything about ""Flyboys"", except perhaps a couple of good performances to lighten up the absolute failure of its execution.Like the majority of people who chose to watch this film, I approached it because a) It was a war film and b) it was a film about air combat.However, neither of these parameters was satisfied, even minimally.Regarding its depiction of war, well you can forget it. Besides some truly strange ""history"" involving mythical German advances, none of the actual nods to WWI make any impact whatsoever. I was NEVER once convinced that the film makers had a clue about the period in which their story was set. There is no real sense of worry or despair throughout the film that accompanied the WWI pilots of real life. The Pretty boys of the Lafayette Escadrille don't share the same sense of ""not coming back"" as the RFC (Royal Flying Corps) pilots of ""Aces High"" or the Jasta pilots of ""The Blue Max"". I know the pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille were volunteers, but there is no doubt or cynicism regarding the war or a sense of nervousness or apprehension. In fact all the pilots seem somewhat happy to be there. They obviously weren't aware of the average lifespan of a WWI pilot or the fact that none of the major combatants allowed their pilots to use parachutes until the Germans introduced the practice in 1917. Being issued a pistol to shoot yourself in the head instead of being burned alive should have caused some raised eyebrows.The aerial sequences, which should have been the star of this film, are in a word `terrible'. There are more convincing effects, physics and graphics in most computer games these days than there are in ""Flyboys"". It's really a shame that the producers didn't get some physicians on board to point out that WWI aircraft were subject to real life limitations....and of course, every German aircraft was a Fokker DR1 triplane....and painted red.""Flyboys"" also includes some of the usual clich&eacute;s of modern Hollywood war movies. There is the obligatory love interest and the obligatory black sacrifice, this time in the shape of Jennifer Decker and Abdul Salis.As the unlikely love of James Franco's lead character, Decker is just irritating. Their scenes are obviously there as a clumsy filler in between the flying scenes and they are a complete waste of time.Salis's character, presumably based on real life pilot Eugene Bullard (the only black pilot of WWI), is also extremely annoying. The idea of introducing a black pilot into the film should have been a good one (even if a little forced), but in ""Flyboys"" one gets the feeling that he is reduced to the level filling the ranks of the ""good guys"" simply as a PC device. I don't think there's anything mentioned regarding the difficulty Bullard faced in real life, or that he was barred from entry to a US squadron on racial grounds.

Something I don't think warranted by their behaviour in WW1.The acting is below average. When they showed the daily lives of the people and the pilots in no scenes could I say they grabbed me. Often I found them boring even scenes that were suppose to be gripping. Partly I suspect because the lives of the people were not interesting, real life often is not gripping and partly because I did not think much of their acting.However it is different with the action scenes.

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[4, 4]","When this movie was about to enter theaters, I was VERY impressed by the trailer and wanted to see it at the theaters - a rare event for me and the Mrs. (we prefer the obvious advantages & benefits of at-home rentals, although The Star Cinema Grill in Clear Lake City is a great place to see movies if you have to see one in the theater.  I digress.)As mentioned, I am someone whose interest in seeing a movie is largely based on the impression I get from the trailer, plus a look at the story synopsis.  I was a little disappointed that this movie did not stay at theaters long, and just figured (not surprisingly) that this kind of movie, which was once very popular, does not have the same wide audience base in a time when movies like Jackass 2 and Borat can bring in the ticketbuyers.I took a look for myself.  The movie has some great dogfighting scenes with outstanding CGFX, which was what I rented it for.  However, it made the same mistake Pearl Harbor did (trying to have a romantic film and a war film and a buddy film all tied together).  As a result, the pacing was a little slower than I would have liked, and it probably was a factor in why the film did not do well at the box office (the war aspect may have turned off many potential female fans who might have been interested in the romantic story; though it does have a beautiful girl as the romantic interest: actress Jennifer Decker).  Another factor in its disappointing revenues may be that in a time of high-tech aerial warfare marvels (I was even an aircrew member in a couple of them), there seems to be little appreciation or interest in the saga of cloth & wood & wire aircraft, which is ironic since the level of morbid interest and excitement (higher fatality rates) would be better represented by World War 1 aircraft.  In fact, one of the things that the film did not really address was the danger and unpredictability of early airplanes, especially in combat, let alone just during landings and other ""routine"" operations.The character development was brief but sufficient, since more of it would have only slowed the pacing further without adding much in the way of interest.

Each one is dealing with some kind of loss or rejection that shows up in the dynamics of the group relationships. The rejected son of a top one per center has to live with the son of a slave in his squad. This gives one of the best lines in the film when the rich kid finally recognizes his racism and asks Skinner what his father had thought about something. Skinner's response put the deep personal differences of the characters in true relief. The flight scenes are surpassed only by &#34;Wings&#34;. Bravado and liquor are the most common defense against the absurdity of life as a pilot whose sole purpose has become killing more of the enemy each day before the enemy kills them.

TOP GUN rip off with extended volleyball scenes? What? American men vacationing in France? For the record. I didn't see one volleyball in the film. In fact, I didn't see one guy without his shirt or a shower scene. Don't listen to bogus reviews. Please, don't listen to these comments, because you will be missing a marvelous, sharp, beautiful and BASED ON A TRUE STORY World War I picture that blew me away.The extent that the filmmakers went to make this a realistic, poigniant and time capturing homage to the FLYBOYS of World War I who went over to France BEFORE America joined the war, is stunning. After watching this film, I couldn't believe that this film hasn't received more accolades.It's a little one dimensional, but that was the way life was for the pilots of World War I who were volunteering to fly war planes only years after the plane was even invented. They arrived in France, they trained for three weeks and they were flying missions that had claimed thousands of lives and had a less than 5% return rate.In between missions, their lives were dull and simple. Parked in the middle of a French country side, they would frequent a single pub and drink to the men who didn't return that day.FLYBOYS is based on real stories from journals of the real men the movie portrays. The lives they left behind to become pilot gods. The loves they lost and left behind. The people they met and the amazing world changing missions they embarked on.James Franco plays Blaine Rawlings, a young man who was about to lose his ranch and be arrested, motivating him to enter World War I as a fighter pilot before the American government joined the fight. He meets a beautiful french women named Lucienne (newcomer Jennifer Decker) who speaks little english, but their bond is realistic and beauiful portrayed.The most breathtaking part of FLYBOYS is the battle scenes themselves. The planes circle and dart between the clouds, streaming their clouds of bullets across the sky. The rudementry targeting system and the flaws in their guns. Everything is captured.Bottom line.

Granted, this movie has some historical inaccuracies (e.g. type of plane portrayed not in service at time, etc) but, personally, I choose not to get too hung up on that sort of thing unless it is just completely outrageous.  I found the film to be very entertaining.  Perfect CG or not, the dogfight sequences were outstanding and there were plenty of them.  I did appreciate the love story, but appreciated more that it did not take the central focus in the film.  It was just enough to show some more humanity.  So, the balance there was good.  Now the plot is quite simple...There is a German nemesis that has to be dealt with by someone...I don't want to include spoilers.  Negative reviews point out just how simple and contrived such a plot line is.  However, I base my judgement based on the entertainment factor.  Did I find myself wanting to see the Nemesis go down?  Yes.  Did I route for the good guys?  Specifically, did I identify with some of the characters (albeit not perfectly developed) and want to see them vindicated?  Yes.  In short, despite the lack of character development, somewhat predictable plot, and not quite perfect CGI, I found the film to be very entertaining.  On top of that, I appreciated the story.

Usually when I look forward to a movie, as I was with this one, I can expect too much and then be disappointed. It's rare but sometimes the film is even better than I anticipated....and that's the case here.This is a  beautifully-photographed, classy film with interesting characters, excellent action scenes in the air with the World War I bi-planes and tri-planes, and a subtle and sweetly-told romance. In other words, this film had a lot to like. Acting-wise, everyone was good. I wasn't familiar with any of these people except for veteran Frenchman Jean Reno, who played ""Captain Thenault"", the main instructor and head of the Lafayette Escadrille. He was excellent, as usual, and played a likable character.The aerial-battle scenes might be the best-ever shown on film but with today's ever-improving cameras, techniques, special-effects with computer knowledge, it's no surprise the flying scenes looked so good. (Think what we'll see on screen in 10 years!) The fight scenes are not overdone, either.Most of the movie centers more on the drama and romantic side than that of action. The romance only involves one of the fliers and it's nicely, tastefully done...and very touching. The actress who plays the part, Jennifer Decker (""Lucienne""), is just beautiful and a wholesome-looking lady. You can see why the flier ""Blaine Rawlings (James Frano) fell for her right away, even though neither could speak the other's language.Anyway, the main story is all about all the fighters and some of the missions they flew. This is based on fact and that means it's not always a happy ending for everyone.

1036154,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B000KX0HIC,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[15, 18]","Where does one start when reviewing a movie like ""Flyboys""? Does one discuss the attention to historical detail? The facts behind the real-life Lafayette Escadrille? The surprisingly great acting from a cast largely comprised of unknowns? The amazing flying sequences and special effects?Really, the movie ""Flyboys"" is a monumental achievement and an effort of which everyone involved in it can take pride.Prior to the United States entry into World War I a number of American men traveled to Europe lured by a fascination with the relatively new ability to fly (many people had never seen an airplane at this time). They joined a squadron known as the Lafayette Escadrille (named after the French general who aided America during the Revolutionary War).Airflight was incredibly dangerous at this time and even more so when flying into a combat zone. Aerial dog-fighting was also a close quarters affair with mere feet between opposing pilots. Indeed the life expectancy for WWI pilots was also extremely short. As one character comments of another's hard edged nature ""Bet he doesn't make friends easily."" The always excellent Jean Reno interjects with ""All of his friends are dead!""So into this backdrop comes ""Flyboys"" which follows the stories of a group of mismatched new arrivals to the squadron.  We have, among others, a Texas rancher faced with the repossession of his land, a young aristocrat seeking the approval of his father, an African American prize fighter eager to repay the kindness shown to him by the French and a young man seeking to follow in his families military heritage.Together they forge a friendship and from stumbling beginnings an effective fighting force.It's an engaging drama and one that I have already ewatched three times. It is nicely complemented on this DVD release by an impressive number of special features the prize of which, for me at least, is the documentary on the inspirations for the characters and historical research and a second one on the real-life Lafayette Escadrille. There is of course a very engaging commentary track which also highlights the great amount of detail that went into the making of the movie.When it was released the movie was criticized by some rather ignorant reviewers who railed against some of the details in the movie. They complained for example about the gunman atop a zeppelin shooting at the fighters buzzing around him. This, however, as the producer Dean Devlin explains, was based on historical fact when Devlin came across a picture of one such gunman in a history book of WWI.Yes, ""Flyboys"" is an impressive achievement and well worth your time and money.",5,'Flyboys' is an impressive achievement,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2643,"['Where', 'one', 'start', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'Flyboys', 'one', 'discuss', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'facts', 'real-life', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'acting', 'cast', 'largely', 'comprised', 'unknowns', 'amazing', 'flying', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'Really', 'movie', 'Flyboys', 'monumental', 'achievement', 'effort', 'everyone', 'involved', 'can', 'take', 'pride.Prior', 'United', 'States', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'number', 'American', 'men', 'traveled', 'Europe', 'lured', 'fascination', 'relatively', 'new', 'ability', 'fly', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'airplane', 'time', 'joined', 'squadron', 'known', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'named', 'French', 'general', 'who', 'aided', 'America', 'Revolutionary', 'War', '.Airflight', 'was', 'incredibly', 'dangerous', 'time', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'flying', 'combat', 'zone', 'Aerial', 'dog-fighting', 'was', 'also', 'close', 'quarters', 'affair', 'mere', 'feet', 'opposing', 'pilots', 'Indeed', 'life', 'expectancy', 'WWI', 'pilots', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'short', 'one', 'character', 'comments', 'hard', 'edged', 'nature', ""n't"", 'make', 'friends', 'easily', 'always', 'excellent', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'friends', 'are', 'dead', 'So', 'backdrop', 'Flyboys', 'stories', 'group', 'mismatched', 'new', 'arrivals', 'squadron', 'have', 'others', 'Texas', 'rancher', 'faced', 'repossession', 'land', 'young', 'aristocrat', 'seeking', 'approval', 'father', 'African', 'American', 'prize', 'fighter', 'eager', 'repay', 'kindness', 'shown', 'French', 'young', 'man', 'seeking', 'follow', 'families', 'military', 'heritage.Together', 'forge', 'friendship', 'stumbling', 'beginnings', 'effective', 'fighting', 'force.It', 'engaging', 'drama', 'one', 'have', 'already', 'ewatched', 'three', 'times', 'nicely', 'complemented', 'DVD', 'release', 'impressive', 'number', 'special', 'features', 'prize', 'least', 'documentary', 'inspirations', 'characters', 'historical', 'research', 'second', 'one', 'real-life', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'course', 'very', 'engaging', 'commentary', 'track', 'also', 'great', 'amount', 'detail', 'went', 'making', 'movie.When', 'was', 'released', 'movie', 'was', 'criticized', 'rather', 'ignorant', 'reviewers', 'who', 'railed', 'details', 'movie', 'complained', 'example', 'gunman', 'zeppelin', 'shooting', 'fighters', 'buzzing', 'however', 'producer', 'Dean', 'Devlin', 'was', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'when', 'Devlin', 'came', 'picture', 'one', 'such', 'gunman', 'history', 'book', 'WWI.Yes', 'Flyboys', 'impressive', 'achievement', 'well', 'time', 'money']",N/A
1036155,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B000KX0HIC,DarthRad,"[10, 11]","The real actors?Well, there's poor James Franco, a fine young actor, who must be cursing his bad luck in getting to play the leading man only in movies plagued by rotten screenplays and supporting casts, and also in losing the leading man role (and then having to play second fiddle) to some wimp in that blockbuster series of all time, Spider-man...And then there's Jean Reno, Hollywood's favorite token Frenchman (even though he was born in Morocco to Spanish parents, as Juan Moreno), once again playing the earnest, understanding wise man with the funny French accent........ gosh, if only all French people could be just like him! ......especially those nasty waiters and shopkeepers in Paris, and those anti-American French politicians......This movie had so many clich&eacute;d scenes in it that I began to realize that the filmmakers must have thought that they could get away with it because the younger movie-going generation wouldn't recognize these as clich&eacute;s, since most are from an older generation of movies.  It must save money to just recycle the old classic scenes, instead of hiring better, more original screenwriters.There's the obligatory sendoff at the train station with the girlfriend running alongside the train (I winced during this scene, half expecting the girl to run splat into a signpost.........ooops, wrong movie, that was from one of the ""Hot Shots"" series);  the obligatory first fight at the bar amongst the airmen;  the obligatory hero's death with kamikaze swan dive into the mission target;  the obligatory hero saves girl - hero loses girl plot;  the obligatory devout Christian, who might as well have also been carrying a sign saying ""I'LL BE DEAD MEAT SOON"" along with his Bible.So what about the non-actors?Chief among them has to be David Ellison,  son of billionaire Larry Ellison of Oracle Software.  Daddy helped finance a good chunk of the $60 million budget of this movie which meant that, despite a complete lack of any acting ability, on a scale similar to the fiasco that was Jake Lloyd (little Anakin - Stars Wars, Phantom Menace), and despite an intensely annoying screen presence equivalent to that of Jar Jar Binks from that same movie, David Ellison gets huge amounts of screen time, including a constant series of brief cutaway shots focused on him, designed to subliminally remind the viewer that he's in this movie........OOOOOFFTA........can you spell N-A-R-C-I-S-S-I-S-T ?Another near non-actor, Jennifer Decker - the girl who plays James Franco's love interest Lucienne.  OK, she's sort of cute, but who told her that the way to play a French girl who doesn't speak English is to act like a deaf-mute?  How the heck did SHE get this role?  We used to come to the answer to that question quite easily, but unfortunately, it is no longer politically correct to say such things in public.Historically, a number of things are not quite right.  The Nieuport 17s that the airmen are supposedly flying had rotary engines, not the radial engines depicted.  NONE of the fighters of WWI had radial engines in fact, since air cooling technology had not developed fully to allow for fixed cylinder heads (in the rotary engines, the cylinder heads of the engine spun around together with the propeller, thus providing superior air cooling).  In any case, the Lafayette Escadrille would quickly lose the Nieuport 17s and mostly fly SPADs (which had inline engines) for much of the war.And those bullet holes!  Come on!  The planes were made of fabric and wood, and had absolutely NO ARMOR!  If bullets hit all around the cockpit, the pilot is DEAD!  How the heck could James Franco's plane be so riddled with bullets in that last dogfight, and he only gets hit ONCE!?That's just my two bits on the historical inaccuracies - there are a great many in this movie which have been pointed out by other reviewers already.However, in spite of all its flaws, this was a moderately entertaining movie.  I watched it as a $2 rental, on my 23"" widescreen computer monitor, so that I could surf the Internet whenever the movie got too inane.  It's the only way to watch this movie, as far as I'm concerned.  Whenever Jar Jar..., I mean, David Ellison,... appeared onscreen, I would Google something about him or his billionaire father - these multi-tasking distractions helped to get me through those scenes, and reminded me also that money has its privileges.I give the movie one star for James Franco's earnest performance, one star for the CGI flying sequences, and one star for trying to tell some of the history of WWI, even if the details got mangled",3,Can you spot the real actors in this movie?,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,4603,"['real', 'actors', 'Well', 'poor', 'James', 'Franco', 'fine',

The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered less than 200 feet.  He was moving at a speed of just 7 miles per hour!  Within a dozen years or so, technology had proceeded to the point where planes could fly over 100 MPH, with ceilings up to 20,000 feet.  Mount a machine gun and voila!  You have a new dimension in modern warfare: aerial combat.Flyboys tells the story of a ragtag group of Americans who flew for France in World War I, before the United States officially entered the war.  The plot is fairly predictable for this genre, even cliche at points, but the movie still works thanks to some amazing CGI that gives photo realistic images of the aerial combat.  The cinematography is well done all around.The acting was passable.  The performance of French actress Jennifer Decker was memorable, despite limited screen time.The blu-ray transfer is outstanding--one of the best I have seen.  Amazing detail; rich colors; little or no film grain, even in nighttime shots.  Because of the gorgeous cinematography and CGI effects, this is a film where you want the best possible clarity, and this blu-ray delivers.  The sound is also very good.  The battle noises are effective, and the epic soundtrack plays great.Parental Advisory: Flyboys features realistic wartime violence, mild language, drinking (but not drunkenness), and a couple of scenes in a brothel (but very tame by modern standards).  Also, a couple kiss in one scene.  The PG-13 rating is for the violence.  Apart from that, it would have been a mild PG.  This is a throwback to an older style of movie making.I recommend this movie.  While fairly predictable, it nevertheless has some patriotic spirit and is beautiful to watch.

While hot air balloons were used during the Civil War to survey battlefields, WWI was the first conflict in which military aviation made a huge impact on the outcome.Long before flight simulators, ejection seats and pilot training schools (which take years & years to complete), the world saw pilots who flew by the seat-of-their pants and took just a few months to become qualified to take to the skies.  They used incredibly primitive flight simulators to learn what they could on the ground, and there was little rm to develop bad habits as they were pushed straight into conflict as soon as they were able to control their aircraft.James Franco is an up & coming actor who has his chance as a sort Errol Flynn role, and he pulls it off nicely.  His character is a Texan who finds himself @ the end of his rope.  So, he sets off for France during WWI and becomes a fighter pilot.  Along the way, he meets up with several other Americans doing the same thing.  While they may have fudged some details, all of the major characters in the film depict historical people.It's unfortunate that this movie didn't do all that great at the box office.  World War One doesn't generate a lot of interest these days, and that's a shame.  Up until WWII, it was the most important war the world had ever seen.  Sadly, its mantra as the ""War to end all wars"" has long since become an obsolete concept.  Nevertheless, it is a vitally important war for us to understand as its a war our great grandparents fought in.

As for it being 'based on a true story,' the only things 'true' about it could be counted on one hand.  Yes, there WAS a Lafayette Escadrille; yes, they DID have a lion as a mascot named 'Whiskey;' yes, there WAS a black pilot in the squadron; yes, Vanderbilt DID rent a chateau for them to use as a barracks, and yes, they did fly Nieuports for a while.  As for the rest of the story, it is either rubbish, or was composed of a number of incidents actually attributable to a large number of pilots from other squadrons.  But even that didn't bother me so much as the PLANES used in this movie!  I can't understand it!  They got so many of the other details correct (motorcycles, the aerodrome, cars, etc, etc.), how could they screw up the planes so badly, when almost all of them and almost all of the flying scenes were CG??  Is there ANYONE who does not know that the famous Red Baron Von Richtofen was the ONLY German to fly an all-red triplane?  As far as I am aware, he was the ONLY German to fly an all-red airplane, period.  So why are there entire squadrons of all-red triplanes flying around in this movie?  This is an idiotic mistake that could only have happened because the stupid CG animators simply copied the red triplanes out of some stupid video game (probably along with the rest of the planes as well).  Blue, green, yellow, checkerboard, just about any OTHER color or color combination could have worked!  Also, why did the two-seater (called a Sopwith 1 1/2 strutter, for those that care) not have FRENCH markings, since it belonged to the squadron as their training plane (it was in British markings throughout the movie)?  As this was a real aircraft (along with one of the Nieuports, an SE-5, a Bristol, and perhaps one of the Fokker Triplanes, the rest were all CG), my guess is the real owners didn't want their nice British paint job screwed up, but the CG animators could easily have made the changes after filming.  Continuity!!  And considering the film-makers were in close contact with all the owners and fliers of the real aircraft, all of whom may be considered experts on WW1 aircraft and markings, why is it none of these issues were ever dealt with?  All of these things were acceptable when WW1 flying movies were filmed in the '20's and 30's, because the technology was simply not available to make the movies truly accurate.  And I know there are a lot of people out there that think I am being too fussy, but dammit!  Think about the movie 'Top Gun,' and imagine it filmed with Cessnas instead of F14's, and perhaps you might get the idea.  Looks like we will all just have to wait for the 'perfect' WW1 flying movie.

I can see that pains a lot of people reviewing it, because they didn't have those planes that year, or they didn't fire that ammo that year, or the planes are the wrong color, or zeppelins didn't bomb in the daytime. What. Ever.  Go rent a documentary or read a history book if that's what you seek.  This movie was BASED on a true story, and did not claim to be factual in every way.Flyboys was a story about people with nothing to lose.  For the most part, they came from various trials in life back in the States that seemed hopeless for them, and they were committed to making a meaningful contribution in the great war, regardless of the risk to their own lives.  (just like the fine men and women in our military today). They must overcome cultural, racial and national prejudices to do so.This is the first movie I've watched in some time which cast the French in a positive light.  It reminded me that they were once a brave nation that stood to fight against those that would overrun them.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jean Reno as French Capt. Thenault of the Lafayette Escadrille.  Although the script nods to the French disdain for Americans, it's not long before we see Thenault's compassion, love and admiration for the yankee expats who have come to die for his country and cause.This film both condemns and glamorizes war.  We see front-line battle, the death of civilians, the destruction of beautiful historical buildings, the struggle with killing, the admiration of a skilled enemy and both honor and disgrace in battle.  There are also the thrills of victory, however small, bitterness of loss and defeat, and hope for the future.It is laced with a love story made to feel genuine by the lack of common language.  That love goes surprisingly unfulfilled at the end, as was surely the case uncountable times in the Euro wars (or any for that matter).There are no big name actors to suck the air from the film, so it is an opportunity to enjoy some fresh faces and performances.  One of my favorites was Michael Jibson as Porter, flying into battle singing ""Onward Christian Soldiers"".  It was funny because the Germans could hear him as he was doing battle with them.  Jennifer Decker as Lucienne was WOW good-looking.  And when she was injured, she was made to look so, instead of glam wounded.  Gunnar Winbergh played the evil German ace Black Falcon, and without a word of dialog he makes us hate every molecule of his being.Bottom line, this was a fun flick.

Yes, it has its flaws in technical lines, but it has a strong, committed cast and a storyline that flows seamlessly to the end.Tony Bill uses his resources from his countless cinematic experiences in adapting a story by Blake T. Evans (screenplay by Phil Sears, David S. Ward, and Evans) to recreate the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, a disparate group of young Americans who volunteered for the French military to become the country's first fighter pilots before the USA entered World War I.  He manages to find the world atmosphere during the Great War, a time when young American boys who had no chance for significance in the tough times USA to go 'over there' to fight the Germans.  He begins with the lad Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) who has just lost his family's farm to the bank, with William Jensen (Philip Winchester) who must live up to his family's fame as heroes, with Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) whose father sees him as a complete loss to his wealthy gentrified family, with Eddie Beagle (David Ellison) who leaves for war with his sweetheart's picture against his breast, with frustrated black fighter Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) - a crew of boys who become bonded through the efforts of the French Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and the loner flyer Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).Planes are designed, the boys are rigorously trained, and off they go to missions never before flown, missions that waste some, and make heroes of others.  Along the way Rawlings meets Lucienne (Jennifer Decker), a French girl who speaks no English but whose heart emboldens Rawlings to feats of heroism.The fighting scenes are terrific to watch as they seem to be done with toys, so light are the aircraft that started flying fighters.  Yes, there are problems in depicting these missions because there are no stunt men who would dare fly such machines even for a movie.  But Tony Bill keeps our attnetion with his direction and with the aerial cinematography of Henry Braham.  The costumes are excellent and the musical score by Trevor Rabin recalls the period well. James Franco and his fellow actors offer solid performances.

Like many here, I absolutely love history.  I am also often disappointed when ""historic"" movies totally fumble historic facts.  But I've given up on trying to get 100% accurate history from dramatic movies.  I've got plenty of books that can give me that.  I read some of the reviews here of those who know WWI better than me.  I ABSOLUTELY respect them, but I can't help but feel that if these movies were made with the accuracy they demanded, a lot of the audience would be lost.  I think the people who made this film care about history, but they can't afford to lose money.  ""Gods and Generals,"" a huge box office flop, was a good example of real accuracy losing its audience.Three things I really appreciated about ""Flyboys:""The role of Eugene Skinner, based on the real Euguene Jacques Bullard (who was from my father's hometown of Columbus, GA).  Bullard was not technically in the Lafayette Escadrille, but it is so important to have him in the movie to communicate his story.  Like the producers said, a lot of people will think he was a ""PC"" Hollywood creation.  I hope the day comes soon when people will stop assuming these things.The role of Lyle Porter, or the cliche ""religious one.""  I don't know if he was based on one of the real pilots, but I'm glad they treated his Christianity with dignity and respect.And I really liked the scene where the pilots trained.  When I watch it, I feel like I'm watching the birth of United States aviation as it happened back then.  I feel like I'm watching history even if the participants don't realize the impact of what they were doing.

To look at it is very pretty and if you can overlook some flawed images, like all the Fokker triplanes being pained red, it looks good.Unfortuneatly this is where the good points end. Even without getting into the historical flaws the film rapidly become predictable, painfully so. You know who will die and can almost predict when and how an hour a head of time. A pointless love story with a french peasant is supposed to add an emotional touch but anyone familiar with a good war film knows this isn't needed.

I watched it despite the reviewers warning that it was all cliche. Well if this was cliche then so was High Noon. That is not a comparison of the two films. However to say everything in this film has been done before so it is all cliche is like saying every western has men on horseback, a sheriff facing a bad guy and his gang, towns people afraid to help and they all have guns strapped to their waist. Yes they fly biplanes in this movie, yes there are good guys and bad guys, ya sorta have to to make a story. So yes we have seen these things before, but not like this. The planes flying through debris of exploded planes may, as the other reviewer put it, have been there for the 3D effect but I would not have thought of that if he hadn't said it. I thought the debris whizzing by was new, they didn't do that in the past! Those scenes, I thought the cg was fine, really helped make it feel as dangerous as it must have been to those pilots back in the day. The love story the human drama the loss and the elation of survival made this a film to be watched. Director Tony Bill knows how to get the best from his actors and put it on film, this he did here time and again. He is also a great story teller which is one reason I chose to watch this film despite the review I read.

1036232,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000KX0HIC,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[6, 9]","James Franco stars in this exciting movie based on the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a group of American pilots flying for the French in the early days of World war I.Franco portrays Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher from Texas who's family ranch has just been repossessed.  While watching a movie at the local moviehouse, he sees a newsreel about pilots fighting in Europe.  He decides to enlist with the French Lafayette Escadrille and battle the Germans.  Soon, Rawlings and fellow pilots William Jensen (Philip Winchester), Lyle Porter (Michael Jibson), Eddie Beagle (David Ellison), Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), and Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) are on their way to France.  All have come from different backgrounds and circumstances, but they all share one common goal; to fight and defeat the Germans.Upon arriving in France, they are met by Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno).  It's Thenault's job to train the American pilots proper tactics in order to battle the Germans.  There are already some American pilots in France.  One is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).  He has become one of the best pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, already having shot down over twenty German aircraft.  The lead pilot for the Germans is the menacing Black Falcon (Gunnar Winbergh) and his group of skilled pilots.  All of the Germans fly the famed Fokker triplane, painted blood-red.  All except the Falcon's, who's is jet black.After completing their training, the Americans are finally ready to take to the skies and do battle with the Germans.  During the course of the movie, there are several thrilling aerial combat sequences between the Americans and Germans, especially the sequence where the Germans send a zeppelin to bomb Paris.  Relationships develop among the pilots as well.  Rawlings becomes the de facto leader of the group, and many of the other pilots look to him for support and advice.  Rawlings has also developed a relationship with a local French girl named Lucienne (Jennifer Decker).  She bandaged Rawlings' leg after a flying accident, and he became attracted to her.  However, she can't speak English and he can't speak French.  But the language barrier can't hide the feelings between the two.The missions become more and more dangerous for the Americans, and soon, some of the pilots are lost in combat.  But the Americans keep going up to fight it out with the Germans despite their lack of experience.  Their will to fight and courage is unquestioned as these heroic men continue to do battle with the enemy.This is an outstanding movie.  The story of the famed Lafayette Escadrille is told with complete historical accuracy.  The acting, especially by James Franco and Jean Reno, is excellent.  The plot is well-conceived, and the amazing aerial combat sequences are the highlight of the film.  The romance between Rawlings and Lucienne his handled wonderfully.  It does not become so out of control as to take over the movie.  Rather, it is allowed to grow at a slower pace that holds the viewer's interest.I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  History fans will enjoy it for its great combat sequences and attention to detail.  Laypersons will enjoy the romance between Rawlings and Lucienne.

1036240,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B000KX0HIC,J. Michael,"[16, 22]","As someone with a great interest in WWI, I had high hopes for ""Flyboys"" but found it to be a rather excruciating experience watching one-dimensional cardboard cutouts religiously follow every single last cliche' in the Hollywood playbook. A movie about a group of Americans who violated their nation's neutrality laws to fight for a foreign power in a senseless, fratricidal war, I was going to give it 2 stars for the impressive dogfighting scenes, thinking at least some of it was performed by actual pilot reenactors, until I found out that it was all CGI-generated and technologically anachronistic to boot. In any case, all the action in the world couldn't save a movie with such a predictable story and such generically boring characters.A professor once told me that a quick test of the quality of a novel or movie's characterization is whether you remember the characters' names. This movie was so mind-numbing, I was lucky to remember my own name by the end, never mind the protagonist's! I don't know if these were bad actors or they just had bad material to work with, but my family and I certainly didn't remember anyone's names, and were forced to refer to the characters by their physical attributes. Unfortunately, only a few of them- Blackie, Fatty and Spiderman-guy- had any kind of unique features, while the rest seemed as undistinguishable as snowflakes. We were glad when one of them got his hand cut off, because he then gained an identity as ""Hookhand"", and we were hoping the others would similarly discover their individuality- i.e. Burnedface, Lack-nose, One-eye - but we were disappointed.As terrible as the characters were- and I can't describe to you the interminable horror of watching a monolingual American try to woo a retarded French girl- the plot was even more disgraceful. If you've ever seen any sports movie, you've seen this one: A motley group of American misfits initially get their clocks cleaned by big, bad German bullies, led by the ""Black Falcon."" Our scrappy Yanks get their act together and start to hold their own against the German B-team. When the Black Falcon knocks out our ace, the young hero vows revenge, which he dramatically achieves with the unexpected help of a character previously thought to be useless.

I would have to say the best actor in the movie probably was the lion.  Yes, there is a lion in a WWI movie, can you believe it?I found the dramatic dog fighting scenes actually quite comical.  Once you realize the planes are CGI, the dogfights are almost as enjoyable as watching a PS3 game.  The true horror of the film is watching the star of the show (Spiderman's best friend) try to woo a (almost retarded) French girl that likes to visit a local brothel for recreation.  I had to vomit several times during their less than bearable dialogue.  In one part of the movie, the leading character flies to her house to give her a joy ride in his plane. Yeah, I'm sure that happened all the time during a little war like WWI.

1036268,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000KX0HIC,Kaya Savas,"[6, 16]","MOVIE: Flyboys is a strange thing to dissect. It's a movie you really want to like, but you just can't help but face the fact that it's so cliched and poorly written. The story is centered around Blaine Rawlings, a young man who leaves his past to go fly planes in France. Each of the young men has a story behind them. Some do it for glory, some because they are forced to, some trying to make better lives for themselves, or some escaping their troubles. The film tells the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a fleet of young Americans who flew planes for the French in WWI before the U.S entered the war. The entire film is schmaltzy with some lame dialogue and weak acting, but it's entertaining. The dogfights, even though the CGI seems unpolished, are quick paced and really great. The story does a good job of building the characters, but since the characters are very flat we really don't care when they get shot down and die. Every formulaic cliche is followed and the movie itself can be followed like a map, there is no surprise as to where it builds and leads to. The audience can pretty much stay one step ahead of the characters, and that is due to the poorly written story. Decent cinematography and set design enhance the atmosphere of the movie, and the dogfights are intense and entertaining to watch. The movie just doesn't exceed in any area to make it memorable. The narrative is greatly enhanced by Trevor Rabins score. Rabin flexes his orchestral muscles and delivers one of his best scores ever. All in all the movie was a good experience, but it's just so cliched.ACTING: The moment after I saw the trailer I asked myself why couldn't they have spent some money on a good cast. James Franco seems to play the same person in every movie. In his previous outing, The Great Raid, he played pretty much the same person. At least The Great Raid had Joseph Fiennes and Marton Csokas. The only credible actor here is Jean Reno who is always great even though the only reason he got the role was because he's French. Martin Henderson never lands good roles and I really don't like him. He tries to pull off a tough guy with a troubled past here, but you just want to flick his nose and laugh every time he gets all up in James Franco's face. A better cast could have helped with the lack of a quality script, it sure did with The Great Raid.BOTTOM LINE: Amazing dogfights that should be seen on the big screen, but poor acting and a weak contrived script hinders this film from being anything extraordinary.",3,"Cliched, Contrived, Laughable Dialogue, But A Great Score With Amazing Dogfight Sequences Make It Worthwhile",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,2524,"['MOVIE', 'Flyboys', 'strange', 'thing', 'dissect', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'like', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'face', 'fact', 'so', 'cliched', 'poorly', 'written', 'story', 'centered', 'Blaine', 'Rawlings', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'past', 'go', 'fly', 'planes', 'France', 'young', 'men', 'story', 'do', 'glory', 'are', 'forced', 'trying', 'make', 'better', 'lives', 'escaping', 'troubles', 'film', 'story', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'fleet', 'young', 'Americans', 'who', 'flew', 'planes', 'French', 'WWI', 'U.S', 'entered', 'war', 'entire', 'film', 'schmaltzy', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'acting', 'entertaining', 'dogfights', 'even', 'CGI', 'unpolished', 'are', 'quick', 'paced', 'really', 'great', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'building', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'flat', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'when', 'get', 'shot', 'down', 'die', 'formulaic', 'cliche', 'followed', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'followed', 'map', 'surprise', 'where', 'audience', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'characters', 'due', 'poorly', 'written', 'story', 'Decent', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'enhance', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'dogfights', 'are', 'intense', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'exceed', 'area', 'make', 'memorable', 'narrative', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'Trevor', 'Rabins', 'score', 'Rabin', 'flexes', 'orchestral', 'muscles', 'delivers', 'one', 'best', 'scores', 'ever', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'experience', 'just', 'so', 'cliched.ACTING', 'moment', 'saw', 'trailer', 'asked', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'spent', 'money', 'good', 'cast', 'James', 'Franco', 'play', 'same', 'person', 'movie', 'previous', 'outing', 'Great', 'Raid', 'played', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'person', 'least', 'Great', 'Raid', 'had', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'only', 'credible', 'actor', 'here', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'who', 'always', 'great', 'even', 'only', 'reason', 'got', 'role', 'was', 'French', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'never', 'good', 'roles', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pull', 'off', 'tough', 'guy', 'troubled', 'past', 'here', 'just', 'want', 'flick', 'nose', 'laugh', 'time', 'up', 'James', 'Franco', 'face', 'better', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'lack', 'quality', 'script', 'sure', 'did', 'Great', 'Raid.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Amazing', 'dogfights', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'poor', 'acting', 'weak', 'contrived', 'script', 'hinders', 'film', 'being', 'anything', 'extraordinary']",N/A

The computer-generated planes zip around more like jet fighters than WW1 planes, making snap-rolls & vertical climbs rather than Immelman turns & the slower, more gradual maneuvers the real planes were capable of. The Nieuports the Escadrille fly were obsolete & replaced by Spads by late 1916/early 1917 (when the movie takes place--they mention the USA entering the war which was April, 1917), and the Fokker Triplane didn't enter service until the winter of 1917 & never in great numbers (very few were red by the way). These quibbles aside, what really destroys the believabilty of the movie is when one of the Flyboys gets shot down & crashes in no-man's land (at a point where the German & French lines seem to be about 50 yards apart when a half mile is about the closest they ever actually got).  Though he's in the cockpit when it crashes, the pilot somehow gets his hand trapped between the ground & the upper wing (which miraculously didn't collapse when the plane flipped upside down). And he can't get it out! His friend has to land (apparently also in no-man's land), run THRU no-man's land perpendicular to all the Germans shooting at him, & help his friend get his hand out. (I won't spoil it by saying how.) WW1 fighters weighed roughly 1000 lbs, with the engine & guns comprising over half the total weight.  The top wing his hand was trapped under would have weighed about 100 lbs total.  If your hand was trapped under one side, you'd simply lift it off with your free hand.  Also the trailing edge of the Nieuport was made up of a pine-wood stringer which was one inch square. He could have cut your way thru it with a penknife.  OR, since his hand was trapped between the wing & the GROUND, he could have simply dug the earth away underneath it.Other blatant inaccuracies: the Germans invade with tanks of British design a year before the tank was invented; they've made a massive breakthrough within a few miles of the airfield & the pilots (& the hero's French girlfriend living in the war zone) are completely unaware of it; the hero takes off at night, lands (where? in a field, in the dark?) by his girl friend's house, & none of the thousands of German soldiers in the area hear the plane. . .For all that, it's not a bad action movie, but as far as being realistic?  They should have just made the movie about the real Escadrille pilots. Raoul Lufbery's true exploits would have been much more exciting. (To anyone interested in the true story of the Escadrille, I heartily recommend Jeff Shaara's novel about WW1, TO THE LAST MAN. And for a movie that gets to the heart of what flying in WW1 was really like, try THE DAWN PATROL with Errol Flynn (coming out in March on dvd).",3,Historically accurate?,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,2841,"['Flyboys', 'decent', 'adventure', 'film', 'apologies', 'reviewer', 'Monty', 'Rainey', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'praised', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'computer-generated', 'planes', 'zip', 'more', 'jet', 'fighters', 'WW1', 'planes', 'making', 'snap-rolls', 'vertical', 'climbs', 'rather', 'Immelman', 'slower', 'more', 'gradual', 'maneuvers', 'real', 'planes', 'were', 'capable', 'Nieuports', 'Escadrille', 'fly', 'were', 'obsolete', 'replaced', 'Spads', 'late', '1916/early', '1917', 'when', 'movie', 'place', 'mention', 'USA', 'entering', 'war', 'was', 'April', '1917', 'Fokker', 'Triplane', 'did', ""n't"", 'enter', 'service', 'winter', '1917', 'never', 'great', 'numbers', 'very', 'few', 'were', 'red', 'way', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'what', 'really', 'believabilty', 'movie', 'when', 'one', 'Flyboys', 'shot', 'down', 'crashes', 'no-man', 'land', 'point', 'where', 'German', 'French', 'lines', 'seem', 'be', '50', 'yards', 'apart', 'when', 'half', 'mile', 'closest', 'ever', 'actually', 'got', 'cockpit', 'when', 'pilot', 'somehow', 'hand', 'trapped', 'ground', 'upper', 'wing', 'miraculously', 'did', ""n't"", 'collapse', 'when', 'plane', 'flipped', 'upside', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'friend', 'land', 'apparently', 'also', 'no-man', 'land', 'run', 'THRU', 'no-man', 'land', 'perpendicular', 'Germans', 'shooting', 'help', 'friend', 'get', 'hand', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'saying', 'how', 'WW1', 'fighters', 'weighed', 'roughly', '1000', 'lbs', 'engine', 'guns', 'comprising', 'total', 'weight', 'top', 'wing', 'hand', 'was', 'trapped', 'would', 'have', 'weighed', '100', 'lbs', 'total', 'hand', 'was', 'trapped', 'one', 'side', ""'d"", 'simply', 'lift', 'off', 'free', 'hand', 'Also', 'trailing', 'edge', 'Nieuport', 'was', 'made', 'pine-wood', 'stringer', 'was', 'one', 'inch', 'square', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'way', 'penknife', 'hand', 'was', 'trapped', 'wing', 'GROUND', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'dug', 'earth', 'away', 'it.Other', 'blatant', 'inaccuracies', 'Germans', 'invade', 'tanks', 'British', 'design', 'year', 'tank', 'was', 'invented', ""'ve"", 'made', 'massive', 'breakthrough', 'few', 'miles', 'airfield', 'pilots', 'hero', 'French', 'girlfriend', 'living', 'war', 'zone', 'are', 'completely', 'unaware', 'hero', 'off', 'night', 'where', 'field', 'dark', 'girl', 'friend', 'house', 'none', 'thousands', 'German', 'soldiers', 'area', 'hear', 'plane', '.For', 'not', 'bad', 'action', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'realistic', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'movie', 'real', 'Escadrille', 'pilots', 'Raoul', 'Lufbery', 'true', 'exploits', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'anyone', 'interested', 'true', 'story', 'Escadrille', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Jeff', 'Shaara', 'novel', 'WW1', 'TO', 'THE', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'movie', 'heart', 'what', 'flying', 'WW1', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'try', 'THE', 'DAWN', 'PATROL', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'coming', 'out', 'March', 'dvd']",N/A

There are a lot of similarities in the film -- both feature American boys going off to France in World War I as aerial aces; both films have lengthy romantic interludes; and both feature pretty good air action scenes in dogfights with Germans.Yet it is, ironically, the older film that is more authentic, more fun, has better flying scenes, and has better music than its newer mate. ""Wings"", which was among Gary Cooper's first films, is more naive in its ""script"" (it's a silent film) but far more realistic and exciting in its all-important aerial scenes.What ""Flyboys"" does with aerial excitement is pretty typical and bland by 21st century standards. Most of the scenes are computer-generated and feature things that could not possibly happen mixed with a perfection that obviously wasn't the case in 1918, when the United States officially entered the war.In one instance, an American flyboy -- being tailed by a German -- lets off the throttle, the plane goes backward, and his stationary wheels rip through the upper fuselage of the German plane, knocking it out of air. Sure, that could happen, uh huh.Both films features lengthy and boring love scenes but, again, the older movie has the better stuff. The love scenes between Buddy Rogers and his female star in ""Wings"" is more authentic, more interesting and, frankly, more realistic than the nonsense that goes on being American flyboys and French girls that don't even speak the same language.Still, this movie is good for an evening's entertainment but people around here giving it five stars and saying it's great apparently have never seen another film. This movie has long, long boring sequences between the action and it goes on far too long. At almost 130 minutes, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long.

It is about a story of the famed ""Lafayette Escadrille"" of the French Airforce in World War I. It was like a foreign legion of the air. It shows American volunteers who joined the glorius escadrille to fight against their German foes. The film also shows that there were both good and bad, like the German pilot of the red, crossed swords marked, red colored Fokker D-VII Triplane, a good man, who spares his American nemesis realizing his machine gun was jammed. But then there was the Black Fokker pilot,also depicting the drawing of a black falcon who was a heartless butcher.This film shows the famed escadrille in action, the way it was, which is now only remembered on connoseur or expert circles. The film also demonstrates a pilot's courage in those days, lest we forget that the parachute had not been invented yet or was at least in the drawing boards, so if your aircraft was hit or disabled you could not bail out thus the pilots were given guns, so that they could shoot themselves rather than be incinerated alive.

1036282,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B000KX0HIC,L. E. Cantrell,"[27, 35]","I have just had an interesting time perusing the 101 previous reviews.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me there's a wide range of opinion out there.  How often do we find headlines running from one-starred ""Save your money"" to three-starred ""Good enough"" to five-starred ""Best movie of 2006 - also best kept secret""?  And all three comments in consecutive reviews on a single Amazon ""page""?[For the enlightenment of any cynics out there, I read the reviews and the attached comments as well as the headlines.]The main objection to ""Flyboys"" seemed to arise from the innumerable errors found on the screen.  They ranged from the airplanes that did not exist at the time of the film, to the super-abundance of Red Barons infesting the skies above France, to the breathtaking indifference to the laws of physics, to the positively giddy misapprehensions about what actually took place in the First World War (aka The Great War aka The War to End All Wars ... ahem.)  Now you may think that these historical boners, these intellectual clunkers are characteristic of video game-addled, Star Wars-bedazzled, comic book-educated lunkheads and lamebrains rather than of responsible adults given control over the millions and millions of dollars required to make a motion picture--but I say to err is human and to provide reason for selling all that overpriced popcorn is near-divine (at least for the theater owners.)A smaller group of naysayers held forth that the plot of the movie made no sense and that the people on the screen masquerading as actors displayed no slightest hint of talent.  I heartily dispute the latter.  The always excellent Jean Reno, who portrayed the French commandant of the flyboy squadron, was right up there on the screen to show what a competent actor looks like.  For several minutes, at least.Enough negativity.  Most reviewers clearly loved this picture.  Many of them took up such stirring war cries as, ""Never listen to the CRITICS!  This is one of the BEST!!!!"", ""Never mind the critics"" and ""The critics don't get it,""--not to mention the immortal, ""Don't listen to the `experts.'""  And the reasons they gave to turn off your mind and just drool in your seat were ... uh, and ....  Oh, yes, here's one, and by far the best of the bunch: ""I took my 4-year old to see it, and he loved it.""  Yes! Absolutely!!  Take that you hyper-critical snobs!!!As for myself , I shall venture just one small criticism: not one minute, not one second, not one frame of the flying sequences looked convincing.  ""Flyboys"" is the most compelling argument I have ever seen against using CGI on a motion picture screen.  ""Cheesy,"" ""unreal"" and unintentionally hilarious"" don't even come close to expressing the way I feel about this visual train wreck.Take the vaunted Zeppelin sequence: the animation in ""Wallace and Grommet"" was more convincing.  Much more.  Now look at the Zeppelin sequence in Howard Hughes' 1930 blockbuster, ""Hell's Angels.""  Both are special effects sequences.  The 21st century version just lies down and dies, leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  Its 76 year-old predecessor (in color, mind you!) pins you back in your seat.  When the Zep crashes, if I hadn't known the date of ""Hell's Angels"" I'd have  believed that Hughes had intercut some lost color film of the Hindenberg tragedy.DVD STUFF: In my journey through the earlier reviews, I noticed that some critics looked askance at comments addressed solely to the film and not to the DVD.  With that in mind I hasten to inform everyone that ""Flyboys"" appears on one or more plastic disks, and that in some editions it is accompanied by other stuff of no discernible significance.A FINAL WISTFUL THOUGHT: Wouldn't it be nice if somebody, somewhere, someday made a movie about the Lafayette Escadrille?",1,"A swing and a miss, not even a flyball",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,3797,"['have', 'just', 'had', 'interesting', 'time', 'perusing', '101', 'previous', 'reviews', 'Correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'wide', 'range', 'opinion', 'there', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'find', 'headlines', 'running', 'one-starred', 'Save', 'money', 'three-starred', 'Good', 'enough', 'five-starred', 'Best', 'movie', '2006', 'also', 'best', 'kept', 'secret', 'three', 'comments', 'consecutive', 'reviews', 'single', 'Amazon', 'page', '[', 'enlightenment', 'cynics', 'there', 'read', 'reviews', 'attached', 'comments', 'as', 'well', 'headlines', ']', 'main', 'objection', 'Flyboys', 'seemed', 'arise', 'innumerable', 'errors', 'found', 'screen', 'ranged', 'airplanes', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'time', 'film', 'super-abundance', 'Red', 'Barons', 'infesting', 'skies', 'France', 'breathtaking', 'indifference', 'laws', 'physics', 'positively', 'giddy', 'misapprehensions', 'what', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Great', 'War', 'aka', 'War', 'End', 'Wars', 'ahem', 'Now', 'may', 'think', 'historical', 'boners', 'intellectual', 'clunkers', 'are', 'characteristic', 'video', 'game-addled', 'Star', 'Wars-bedazzled', 'comic', 'book-educated', 'lunkheads', 'rather', 'responsible', 'adults', 'given', 'control', 'millions', 'millions', 'dollars', 'required', 'make', 'motion', 'picture', 'say', 'err', 'human', 'provide', 'reason', 'selling', 'overpriced', 'popcorn', 'near-divine', 'least', 'theater', 'owners', 'smaller', 'group', 'naysayers', 'held', 'forth', 'plot', 'movie', 'made', 'sense', 'people', 'screen', 'masquerading', 'actors', 'displayed', 'slightest', 'hint', 'talent', 'heartily', 'dispute', 'latter', 'always', 'excellent', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'who', 'portrayed', 'French', 'commandant', 'flyboy', 'squadron', 'was', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'show', 'what', 'competent', 'actor', 'several', 'minutes', 'least.Enough', 'negativity', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'clearly', 'loved', 'picture', 'Many', 'took', 'up', 'such', 'stirring', 'war', 'cries', 'Never', 'listen', 'CRITICS', 'one', 'BEST', 'Never', 'mind', 'critics', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'not', 'mention', 'immortal', 'Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'experts', 'reasons', 'gave', 'turn', 'off', 'mind', 'just', 'drool', 'seat', 'were', 'uh', 'Oh', 'yes', 'here', 'one', 'far', 'best', 'bunch', 'took', '4-year', 'old', 'see', 'loved', 'Yes', 'Absolutely', 'Take', 'hyper-critical', 'snobs', 'shall', 'venture', 'just', 'one', 'small', 'criticism', 'not', 'one', 'minute', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'not', 'one', 'frame', 'flying', 'sequences', 'looked', 'convincing', 'Flyboys', 'most', 'compelling', 'argument', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'using', 'CGI', 'motion', 'picture', 'screen', 'Cheesy', 'unreal', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'expressing', 'way', 'feel', 'visual', 'train', 'wreck.Take', 'vaunted', 'Zeppelin', 'sequence', 'animation', 'Wallace', 'Grommet', 'was', 'more', 'convincing', 'Much', 'more', 'Now', 'look', 'Zeppelin', 'sequence', 'Howard', 'Hughes', '1930', 'blockbuster', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences', '21st', 'century', 'version', 'just', 'down', 'dies', 'leaving', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', '76', 'year-old', 'predecessor', 'color', 'mind', 'back', 'seat', 'When', 'Zep', 'crashes', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'date', 'Hell', 'Angels', ""'d"", 'have', 'believed', 'Hughes', 'had', 'intercut', 'lost', 'color', 'film', 'Hindenberg', 'tragedy.DVD', 'STUFF', 'journey', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'noticed', 'critics', 'looked', 'askance', 'comments', 'addressed', 'solely', 'film', 'not', 'DVD', 'mind', 'hasten', 'inform', 'everyone', 'Flyboys', 'one', 'more', 'plastic', 'disks', 'editions', 'accompanied', 'other', 'stuff', 'discernible', 'significance.A', 'FINAL', 'WISTFUL', 'THOUGHT', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'somebody', 'somewhere', 'someday', 'made', 'movie', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille']",N/A

1036288,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000KX0HIC,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 6]","As a drama, this film lacks a lot.  The characters almost have depth, almost.  The romance almost has depth, almost.  The film almost has facts, almost.  There is a lot of almost in this film, which is this movie's primary problem.The story is quite straightforward.  A group of hot-blooded young lads head for France during The Great War to fly airplanes against Germany.  One of the future pilots takes the Aquitania to Europe, which had to have been a bit of a challenge since the Aquitania was not in civilian service at the time.Once in France, the excitement builds as the young pilots fly against Fokker Triplanes, even though those planes did not enter the war until later, and then only in small numbers.  The Fokker was notorious for being slow and occasionally falling apart because of a variety of problems.  However, the Fokker had an excellent climb rate and was maneuverable.  Baron Von Richthofen's plane was one of the few painted completely red.  I understand that the choice of red was made to help tell the good guys from the bad guys.Skipping past all the historical inaccuracies, which this film boasts in abundance, the movie finally gets into two stories.  There is a shallow love story and the dog fights.  The love story is shallow because our two love birds have to develop this love story in between dog fights and the love story seemed to me to be a distraction to the rest of the story.The real heart of this movie is the dog fights.  Boasting hundreds of CGI effects, this movie is a video game.  Planes roar and fly with awesome-looking bullet effects.  The zeppelin is a masterpiece, and one of the scenes on the zeppelin is a reprise of a similar scene used at least once, in the movie ""The Rocketeer.""  I do not have sufficient knowledge of the aircraft used in World War I to know whether they could turn as well as the aircraft shown in this movie, but the turns did seem too tight to me, especially for the Fokker with its wing structural issues.So we get to see a series of scenes where the good guys and the bad guys fight each other in the skies over France.  The good guys lose pilots and shoot down the bad guys, and the good guys are on the side of right and eventually they must have to gain some kind of moral victory.The biggest problem with this movie is lack of story.  The backgrounds of the various characters and the nominal love story are merely doorways to get these characters into dogfights.  I have seen this movie compared to ""Top Gun,"" but though that movie had its own issues, the dogfight scenes were secondary to the conflicted character that Tom Cruise played.  In this movie the dogfights are the entire reason for the movie, and everything else is secondary.On the other hand, the dogfight scenes are a blast to watch.  If you have ever liked video games, especially flight simulator type games or war games, this movie brings those games to life.  The special effects used to show the planes are phenomenal.  The special effects provide the redeeming qualities of this movie and save it from being a two-star movie.Other reviews of this movie are quite polarized.  However, the reason for the polarization is obvious.  If you expect even a nominal attempt at accuracy, then this movie will likely be disappointing for you to watch.  If you want to watch a movie about that is vaguely inspired by World War I dogfights and can wait for the movie to start showing them, then you will likely enjoy this movie.Good Luck!",3,Lots of Juice but Little Meat,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,3482,"['drama', 'film', 'lot', 'characters', 'almost', 'have', 'depth', 'almost', 'romance', 'almost', 'depth', 'almost', 'film', 'almost', 'facts', 'almost', 'lot', 'almost', 'film', 'movie', 'primary', 'problem.The', 'story', 'quite', 'straightforward', 'group', 'hot-blooded', 'young', 'lads', 'head', 'France', 'Great', 'War', 'fly', 'airplanes', 'Germany', 'One', 'future', 'pilots', 'Aquitania', 'Europe', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'challenge', 'Aquitania', 'was', 'not', 'civilian', 'service', 'time.Once', 'France', 'excitement', 'young', 'pilots', 'fly', 'Fokker', 'Triplanes', 'even', 'planes', 'did', 'not', 'enter', 'war', 'later', 'then', 'only', 'small', 'numbers', 'Fokker', 'was', 'notorious', 'being', 'slow', 'occasionally', 'falling', 'apart', 'variety', 'problems', 'However', 'Fokker', 'had', 'excellent', 'climb', 'rate', 'was', 'maneuverable', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Richthofen', 'plane', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'painted', 'completely', 'red', 'understand', 'choice', 'red', 'was', 'made', 'help', 'tell', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys.Skipping', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'abundance', 'movie', 'finally', 'two', 'stories', 'shallow', 'love', 'story', 'dog', 'fights', 'love', 'story', 'shallow', 'two', 'love', 'birds', 'have', 'develop', 'love', 'story', 'dog', 'fights', 'love', 'story', 'seemed', 'be', 'distraction', 'rest', 'story.The', 'real', 'heart', 'movie', 'dog', 'fights', 'Boasting', 'hundreds', 'CGI', 'effects', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'Planes', 'roar', 'fly', 'awesome-looking', 'bullet', 'effects', 'zeppelin', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'scenes', 'zeppelin', 'reprise', 'similar', 'scene', 'used', 'least', 'once', 'movie', 'Rocketeer', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'sufficient', 'knowledge', 'aircraft', 'used', 'World', 'War', 'know', 'could', 'turn', 'as', 'well', 'aircraft', 'shown', 'movie', 'turns', 'did', 'seem', 'too', 'tight', 'especially', 'Fokker', 'wing', 'structural', 'issues.So', 'get', 'see', 'series', 'scenes', 'where', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'fight', 'other', 'skies', 'France', 'good', 'guys', 'lose', 'pilots', 'shoot', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'side', 'right', 'eventually', 'must', 'have', 'gain', 'kind', 'moral', 'victory.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'lack', 'story', 'backgrounds', 'various', 'characters', 'nominal', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'merely', 'doorways', 'get', 'characters', 'dogfights', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'compared', 'Top', 'Gun', 'movie', 'had', 'own', 'issues', 'dogfight', 'scenes', 'were', 'secondary', 'conflicted', 'character', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'played', 'movie', 'dogfights', 'are', 'entire', 'reason', 'movie', 'everything', 'else', 'secondary.On', 'other', 'hand', 'dogfight', 'scenes', 'are', 'blast', 'watch', 'have', 'ever', 'liked', 'video', 'games', 'especially', 'flight', 'simulator', 'type', 'games', 'war', 'games', 'movie', 'games', 'life', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'show', 'planes', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'special', 'effects', 'provide', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'movie', 'save', 'being', 'two-star', 'movie.Other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'polarized', 'However', 'reason', 'polarization', 'obvious', 'expect', 'even', 'nominal', 'attempt', 'accuracy', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointing', 'watch', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'vaguely', 'inspired', 'World', 'War', 'dogfights', 'can', 'wait', 'movie', 'start', 'showing', 'then', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'movie.Good', 'Luck']",N/A

I am a little surprised by the very poor reviews this movie is getting, because I rather liked it, although I am the first to recognise that it could be much, much better.The strong point of this movie are the computer generated planes and air fights. WW I dogfights were a great movie material, because of their short range personal character - in fact, strangely enough, they remind me a little the STAR WARS fights between X-Wings and TIE fighters. Here the planes look really like real ones and the effect is great for any fan of aviation: Nieuport and Fokker fighters, Handley-Page and Gotha bombers and the gigantic L32 Zeppelin, they all give a great show. The movie is quite realistic and stresses well the incredibly idiotic decision of allied high command to NOT provide pilots with parachutes (Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians and even Turks had them, from the beginning of the war) on the incredible assumption, that pilots will jump from their planes at the first occasion!! That explains why the casualty rates in French, British, Italian and later American aviation were so high.There are some very weak spots. Relations between pilots and especially all the conflicts are too pinky easy and sweet, which takes away most of the realism. The main hero accomplishes alone all the most incredible things, the rest of the unit being mostly his sidekicks. The ending is a little too previsible. The love story is going nowhere and we do not even know why. There is only one really bad guy in the movie and of course he is German, etc., etc.;Jean Reno indeed is not very much used but this is a nice effort from Hollywood to hire a French to play a French officer, rather than just use an American and make him speak with a French accent... On this point, let's stress that this movie is a welcome pause in French bashing, which seems to be a kind of national sport in Hollywood this last years....But all those weak points notwithstanding, I forgive to this movie a lot, for the scenes, when the Escadrille Lafayette takes off and is flying over the beautiful French landscapes, together with a flight of cranes... And then there is this unique scene, when a whole horde of red painted Fokkers emerges from the sunlight to butcher the unsuspecting American rookies, with the Black Falcon in the lead (yes, you guessed right, the Black Falcon is the plane of the BAD GUY).There is also some good humor in ""Flyboys"" - a mascot lion named Whiskey, an American pilot who simply can not shoot straight no matters how much he tries, until.... well, no, no hints here, you will see by yourself. And the decorations of the planes, with my favorite being a seriously deranged woodpecker... This is a nice war movie, and a must if you are a fan of aviation and can simply not resist the sight of a flight of Fokkers going after some heavy Handley-Page bombers....",4,"Not a great movie, but very watchable",1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,3065,"['story', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'American', 'volunteers', 'who', 'came', 'fight', 'France', 'country', 'entered', 'war', 'who', 'became', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'now', 'legendary', 'Escadrille', 'Lafayette', 'am', 'little', 'surprised', 'very', 'poor', 'reviews', 'movie', 'getting', 'rather', 'liked', 'am', 'first', 'recognise', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'better.The', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'are', 'computer', 'generated', 'planes', 'air', 'fights', 'WW', 'dogfights', 'were', 'great', 'movie', 'material', 'short', 'range', 'personal', 'character', 'fact', 'strangely', 'enough', 'remind', 'little', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'fights', 'X-Wings', 'TIE', 'fighters', 'Here', 'planes', 'look', 'really', 'like', 'real', 'ones', 'effect', 'great', 'fan', 'aviation', 'Nieuport', 'Fokker', 'fighters', 'Handley-Page', 'Gotha', 'bombers', 'gigantic', 'L32', 'Zeppelin', 'give', 'great', 'show', 'movie', 'quite', 'realistic', 'well', 'incredibly', 'idiotic', 'decision', 'allied', 'high', 'command', 'NOT', 'provide', 'pilots', 'parachutes', 'Germans', 'Austrians', 'Bulgarians', 'even', 'Turks', 'had', 'beginning', 'war', 'incredible', 'assumption', 'pilots', 'will', 'jump', 'planes', 'first', 'occasion', 'why', 'casualty', 'rates', 'French', 'British', 'Italian', 'later', 'American', 'aviation', 'were', 'so', 'high.There', 'are', 'very', 'weak', 'spots', 'Relations', 'pilots', 'especially', 'conflicts', 'are', 'too', 'pinky', 'easy', 'sweet', 'away', 'most', 'realism', 'main', 'hero', 'accomplishes', 'alone', 'most', 'incredible', 'things', 'rest', 'unit', 'being', 'mostly', 'sidekicks', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'previsible', 'love', 'story', 'going', 'nowhere', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'course', 'German', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'indeed', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'used', 'nice', 'effort', 'Hollywood', 'hire', 'French', 'play', 'French', 'officer', 'rather', 'just', 'use', 'American', 'make', 'speak', 'French', 'accent', 'point', 'let', 'stress', 'movie', 'welcome', 'pause', 'French', 'bashing', 'be', 'kind', 'national', 'sport', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'years', '.But', 'weak', 'points', 'notwithstanding', 'forgive', 'movie', 'lot', 'scenes', 'when', 'Escadrille', 'Lafayette', 'flying', 'beautiful', 'French', 'landscapes', 'together', 'flight', 'cranes', 'then', 'unique', 'scene', 'when', 'whole', 'horde', 'red', 'painted', 'Fokkers', 'emerges', 'sunlight', 'butcher', 'unsuspecting', 'American', 'rookies', 'Black', 'Falcon', 'lead', 'yes', 'guessed', 'right', 'Black', 'Falcon', 'plane', 'BAD', 'GUY', 'also', 'good', 'humor', 'Flyboys', 'mascot', 'lion', 'named', 'Whiskey', 'American', 'pilot', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'shoot', 'straight', 'matters', 'how', 'much', 'well', 'hints', 'here', 'will', 'see', 'decorations', 'planes', 'favorite', 'being', 'seriously', 'deranged', 'woodpecker', 'nice', 'war', 'movie', 'must', 'are', 'fan', 'aviation', 'can', 'simply', 'not', 'resist', 'sight', 'flight', 'Fokkers', 'going', 'heavy', 'Handley-Page', 'bombers']",N/A

1036300,A2HWGK45RBQX63,B000KX0HIC,"Mark ""a longtime record buyer""","[18, 21]","This is an awfully good looking movie put together by some very gifted veteran film makers.  Unfortunately, it seems not to have occurred to any of them to consult even a rudimentary history of World War I before embarking on this.""Flyboys"" is supposedly set against the backdrop of that war but in fact it is not.  It takes place in an alternate universe where things are very different.Okay, a good movie has dramatic needs.  But usually its fictions are things that ""could have happened"" within the context of a larger historical backdrop.  Consider...(1) The actual war opened with a German drive on Paris in 1914 which stalled out at the Marne.  Both sides dug in there, and each extended their flanks until parallel trench lines ran uninterrupted for 475 miles from the Swiss border to the sea. And there they sat...This was the notorious ""trench deadlock"" that gripped the western front from late 1914 through early 1918.  The film supposedly takes place during this period but...(2) ""Flyboys"" forgets the trenches and strangely posits an imaginary German drive on Paris around 1916.  Airmen of the Escadrille try to thwart it by escorting bombers to attack German supply depots.  What is even more odd is that when this raid fails, they simply lose interest in the threat to Paris and turn to other missions.(3) The only major German offensive in this period was actually at Verdun.  It was a bloody struggle that lasted months and accomplished little, but cost over a million  lives.  The Escadrille is based at Verdun in the movie so its airmen should be in the middle of this crisis.  Yet they seem blissfully unaware something is amiss.(4) There is mention of ""sending children to England"" for safety.  A touching cinematic moment, but there was no need to flee France in World War I.  If necessary, you simply moved farther away from the front.(5) Around mid-film the surprising announcement is made that ""the Germans have moved across the Meuse"" -- and indeed we see soldiers marching across open fields.But again, as with the drive on Paris, how did these troops get past the Allied trenches?A massive breech of the Allied line would be needed, with follow up forces penetrating deep into open country in the rear. Such a staggering event would have shaken France to the core.But here it merely provides the hero an opportunity to fly to the rescue of his sweetheart and evacuate her by air to safety.  After that bit of personal drama the film once again simply loses interest in the situation.(6) The Zeppelin daylight suicide raid on Paris seems like another fanciful concoction.  Zeppelins raided England at night but were never very effective.  Here we are given a lovely cinematic death ride that makes no sense.(7) Toward the end of the film the Germans renew that strange drive on Paris.  This time it triggers an evacuation of the French capital, apparently to create a poignant background against which the romance between the airman and French girl plays out.Germany was incapable of such an attempt until the collapse of Russia in 1917, which allowed transfer of a million troops from the east.  Then came the great German offensives of 1918, but none were aimed at Paris and there was no evacuation.Bottom line:""Flyboys"" routinely destroys any remote possibility of understanding this important event with its huge and impossible distortions for the most casual and fleeting of purposes. There is more than enough exceptional material in the history of this war to meet any dramatic requirements of film makers. They seem not to have bothered to even look at it.It is strange to see young student reviewers call this film ""a good way to learn about WW I.""Look, I'm no historian.  These remarks are from memory based on having read a few books on this war some years back.

The acting is excellent, but people used to the over-the-top emotionalism of most acting these days are probably not going to appreciate it. There is no self-pity and no tantrums.They captured the historical reality of air missions during the first world war as well as anyone ever has. And the CGI, despite its limitations visually, allowed them to recreate a richer variety of aircraft in battle than previous live-action films were able to show. With some notible exceptions, many past WWI air films ended up in the air being dogfights between a small set of fighters. This is different.The film has a strong male point of view to it which is almost never seen these days. Rather than drunk supermen with a gun in one hand and a woman in the other ready, rather than prettyboys (Top Gun), rather than crybabies, you get ordinary guys with motivations that most people can understand.Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault does an excellent job in playing his part as well.This is a first-class retelling of some of the stories of the Escadrille LaFayette. Most films these days are unwatchable junk.

1036305,A2CHKTBRQHDQQ8,B000KX0HIC,"Mason Vaquero ""Engineer""","[5, 8]","Flyboys has some historical inaccuracies, but so did a lot of movies that were made about WWII.  In this case, it is about WWI and it is based off of the Lafayette Escadrille, which was basically the French Air Force (then called French Air Service) during that time.  There were a number of American men who joined this service to help fight for the French but also to learn to fly and become a part of history.  The airplane had been invented not very long before, so for these men they really were being a part of history in more ways than one:  They were the first combat pilots in a war.  I wanted to talk about the Collector's edition disc first.  I see a lot of people exploding at the mouth, ears, nose and overall body cavity when railing on this film.  Many of the comments are that the flight scenes are not realistic because of CG and impossible capabilities of the airplane.  I find this funny because in the special edition it shows how they had stunt pilots do these very things and have it all recorded.  The construction of the Zeppelin was also interesting and yet debunks another myth that it was a 100% CG creation.  Last but not least they do show a history of the real Escadrille and amazingly despite all the exploding heads, I found that it seemed to be far more accurate than some people are claiming when accusing it of being false.Overall the story is good for representing dog fights and training exercises, and although I didn't feel moved by every character's story, I still feel it had enough different things going on to make it good.  The romance was a nice touch and when Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is hiding from the Germans in the house it was very scary, especially thinking moments like that really happened back then.  I also really liked the fact that they showed some ground battle and portrayed the trenches and the soldiers who fought in them.  Many don't realize how many fought and died right there in the trenches, because if a bullet or bayonet did not get you, the mustard gas did.  The team of men do start out somewhat as misfits and spoiled brats but then are shown to come together in their training and off base hanging out time to become a team.  It is not the greatest portrayal of WWI nor is it the most accurate, but the story I thought was very moving and it is close enough to representing some of the men that I liked it.  Eugene Skinner was one of my favorite people and Abdul Salis did a great job playing this role.  James Franco and Jean Reno also are great in their roles.  Franco is not everyone's favorite male actor but he seems much better than if they were to put Colin Farrel in there.",4,Flyboys - two disc collector's edition,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,2656,"['Flyboys', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'so', 'did', 'lot', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'WWII', 'case', 'WWI', 'based', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'was', 'basically', 'French', 'Air', 'Force', 'then', 'called', 'French', 'Air', 'Service', 'time', 'were', 'number', 'American', 'men', 'who', 'joined', 'service', 'help', 'fight', 'French', 'also', 'learn', 'fly', 'become', 'part', 'history', 'airplane', 'had', 'been', 'invented', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'before', 'men', 'really', 'were', 'being', 'part', 'history', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'were', 'first', 'combat', 'pilots', 'war', 'wanted', 'talk', 'Collector', 'edition', 'disc', 'first', 'see', 'lot', 'people', 'exploding', 'mouth', 'ears', 'nose', 'overall', 'body', 'cavity', 'when', 'railing', 'film', 'Many', 'comments', 'are', 'flight', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'CG', 'impossible', 'capabilities', 'airplane', 'find', 'funny', 'special', 'edition', 'how', 'had', 'stunt', 'pilots', 'do', 'very', 'things', 'have', 'recorded', 'construction', 'Zeppelin', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'yet', 'debunks', 'myth', 'was', '100', '%', 'CG', 'creation', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'do', 'show', 'history', 'real', 'Escadrille', 'amazingly', 'exploding', 'heads', 'found', 'seemed', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'accurate', 'people', 'are', 'claiming', 'when', 'accusing', 'being', 'story', 'good', 'representing', 'dog', 'fights', 'training', 'exercises', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'moved', 'character', 'story', 'still', 'feel', 'had', 'enough', 'different', 'things', 'going', 'make', 'good', 'romance', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'when', 'Lucienne', 'Jennifer', 'Decker', 'hiding', 'Germans', 'house', 'was', 'very', 'scary', 'especially', 'thinking', 'moments', 'really', 'happened', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'showed', 'ground', 'battle', 'portrayed', 'trenches', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'many', 'fought', 'died', 'right', 'there', 'trenches', 'bullet', 'bayonet', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'mustard', 'gas', 'did', 'team', 'men', 'do', 'start', 'out', 'somewhat', 'misfits', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'then', 'are', 'shown', 'come', 'together', 'training', 'base', 'hanging', 'out', 'time', 'become', 'team', 'not', 'greatest', 'portrayal', 'WWI', 'most', 'accurate', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'close', 'enough', 'representing', 'men', 'liked', 'Eugene', 'Skinner', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'people', 'Abdul', 'Salis', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'James', 'Franco', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'also', 'are', 'great', 'roles', 'Franco', 'not', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'male', 'actor', 'much', 'better', 'were', 'put', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'there']",N/A

This film did little but anger me. It certainly did not entertain.I am a sucker for airplane movies. I like James Franco and Jean Reno as actors. So I stayed with it and the longer I did the more upset I got.First and foremost are the blatant historical and factual inaccuracies. Yes, the Lafayette Escadrille existed and was manned by American volunteers. NO, they did not train in their operational unit. The French had an entirely separate, not entirely logical system for training new pilots. Worse, they used Nieuport 17s, which had rotary engines NOT radial engines. The entire mass of a rotary rotates around its crankshaft, greatly affecting maneuvarability, while a radial - although they cylinders are arranged in similar fashion - sits still in the aircraft while the crank rotates. There are a number of close-up scenes in which the nose of the plane is prominent and in all the engine sits still.This alone had my teeth grinding. Then there is the story-telling.There are several scenes in which Franco takes of on a usually love interest-driven mission that shows him in the air. Cut to him walking from the plane in some sort of rough, plowed field. Gimme a break. How does one make the jump from being in the air to walking away from an impossible landing?I can go on and on but this is already taking more effort than the film is worth. This should have been an homage to the brave men who flew for France before America entered the Great War. Instead it is a farce. Don't even get me started on how the producers and director wasted Jean Reno. I am certain he was blushing as he cashed his check and \paid his French taxes.To be sure, the CGI stuff is awesome and worth watching on a streaming service.

The true life story was most accurate, including such details as the lion which served as the mascot for the Escadrille LaFayette, the dented bullets which the flying aces had to sort through before each flight, and the fact that over one million allied soldiers lost their lives at Verdun.Hollywood movie critics have a difficult time with true stories. True life, especially when accurately presented, doesn't always have the same flair as fictionalized accounts, and critics have given rather harsh reviews of the plot, totally missing so many details surrounding such things as camaraderie, respect and traumatic real life emotions. And no, in real life, people don't always live happily ever after and the hero doesn't always ride off into the sunset with his sweetheart.Beyond the historical accuracy portrayed here, the film has sensational filming, particularly in the air battle scenes. The aerial views depict the miles of devastation of French countryside surrounding the trenches. The casting is more than adequate with particular mention going to Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault. James Franco also gives a superb portrayal of American Ace Blaine Rawlings.If you are a history lover, and particularly interested, as I am, in the Great War, I urge you to go and watch this movie. You will find it historically accurate and yet able to bridge the gap into being an entertaining movie. Remember that this is not some Hollywood enhanced idea of war, but rather an accurate depiction of the real life events that surrounded the American pilots who became the Escadrille LaFayette. The critics got this one all wrong.

I won't be having nightmares about ""Flyboys"".Set in the First World War, it follows the journey of a group of young Americans who decide, for various reasons of their own, to enlist with the French forces to fly against the Germans. They did this before the USA entered the war. Learning to fly canvas and wood planes, they soon find out the realities of air warfare and the skills of their enemies.The acting is fairly average and most of the dogfighting and aerial shots are CGI images. However, that is understandable considering there are not many of the aeroplanes left, and anyone who has built a replica would be naturally possessive and protective. That said, I thought the CGI had been well done, indeed, and was far superior to a lot that shows up in war movies. The quality was very good.For the historical inaccuracies that some have mentioned, you would have to be very knowledgable in the field of First World War aviation to pick them up, except the most obvious ones. For the average viewer, these concerns will not take away from the overall plot or enjoyment of the movie. The one point I thought was a bit rich was Rawlings landing his plane and running into No Man's Land to rescue a downed pilot. The fact that some of the best machine gunners in the world at that time could not hit him was a glaring oversight.The concession made to the performance of the aeroplanes themselves is also understandable in my own opinion. For the sheer spectacle of combat, I can see why they ""enhanced"" the performance of the planes themselves. The real thing would not have been able to do vertically climb as they did in the movie, (true), or do such snappy moves, (true), but that would have been less than exciting if the makers had stuck strictly to the reality.For sheer spectacle, this movie more than makes up for its short-comings. It is visually gripping and very much an action drama. Considering it is the first movie about First World War fliers in some decades that I know of, it was a refreshing and pleasant movie to see.

Paris Hilton maybe?  No, wait, she could've done better.Where to start?  Fokker triplanes at the end of 1916?  Nope, that was later.  Five thousand Fokker triplanes, all painted brilliant red, with crosses all over them, even on the upper surfaces of the lower wings?  Nope.  A zeppelin raid in broad daylight with a triplane escort?  Nope.  Close up views of the smallish looking Neuports that show the brakes on the backs of the wheels? That's plain stupid.

This movie shares this fate.

But don't let this fool you, this was a good movie, fun to watch and engaging the entire way.  The movie begins by showing how the various Americans joined the war before their own country.  The movie then progresses to show their training, and troubles both in and out of the cockpit.  Finally comes the dogfights, of which there are several.  One dogfight occurs around a zeppelin, another occurs over a trench battlefield, and another occurs over fields and forests.  The dogfights themselves were very realistic, and the only miss of detail is that all the pilots landed looking just as good as when they took of, even though they sat in open air cockpits.  It seems hair gel was standard treatment for WWI pilots.For a war movie, it has all the generic subplots; the romance between a local girl and the group's brooding conscious, the doomed hero, the silent villian, the spoiled rich kid who does good, and the over eager chap who losses his nerve, only to gain it back at the end.

1036335,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000KX0HIC,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[0, 3]","Flyboys is a 2006 American drama film set during World War I, starring James Franco, Martin Henderson, Jean Reno, Jennifer Decker, David Ellison, Abdul Salis, Philip Winchester and Tyler Labine. It was directed by Tony Bill, a pilot and aviation enthusiast.[1] Screenplay was written by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans and David S. Ward with the screen story by Blake T. Evans.The film follows the enlistment, training and combat experiences of a group of young Americans who volunteer to become fighter pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, the 124th air squadron formed by the French in 1916. The squadron consisted entirely of American volunteers who wanted to fly and fight in World War I during the main years of the conflict, 1914-1917, before the United States later joined the war against the Central Powers.A group of young Americans go to France, for different personal reasons, and volunteer to fight in the French Air Service, L'A&eacute;ronautique militaire, during World War I prior to America's entrance into the war. One of the main characters, Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) faced with the foreclosure of his family ranch in Texas, decides to enlist after seeing a newsreel of aerial combat in France. Dilettante Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) joins because of his overbearing father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), who had been accepted as an athlete in France, was motivated to ""pay back"" his adopted country. These American recruits were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault (Jean Reno), while the veteran fighter ace Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), a fellow American, takes over as their mentor.During their training, the film mainly deals with the struggles each pilot has with the demanding flying; later, the focus shifts to the aerial dogfights that dominate the front line missions. Themes of camaraderie, racial prejudice, revenge and love are also explored. The film ends with an epilogue that relates each film character to the real-life Lafayette Escadrille figures on which the movie was based.[2] One charming touch in this film is that the hero is given a small bear, which he carries as a good luck charm. This is an obvious reference to the small bear carried as a good luck charm by a pilot in ""Wings,"" a silent film about the Lafayette Escadrille, which, in 1927, was the first film ever to win the Academy Award for best picture.",5,A MASTERPIECE!

It is impossible to cover all of the inaccuracies not to mention anachronisms throughout the movie. At any moment during training I expected Franco to pull out a droid and start texting. And the lack of respect shown by the American trainees to the battle hardened French officer was just so out of character for men in that time period its ridiculous. Not only were men much more classy in their public behavior back then but they would never have disrespected an officer like that, particularly the French. They'd have all been doing their flying from the brig. .The yelling &#34;yahoo!&#34; from an airplane, and shouting to each other as they flew by, I mean, ...come on. You can't hear anything over the roar of those rotary engines and a hundred mph wind in your face. It was laughable. Never once did I get the feel of climbing into the cockpit first person, like you did in the Blue Max when Stachel first flies a combat patrol in the Pfalz. Even though the cockpit shots weren't as good as &#34;Hells Angels&#34; looking at the actors (which used real pilots for actors who were filmed actually flying their planes) the shots from inside the cockpits were still were from real cockpits so you got the experience of taking off in a WWI plane. And the scene of the German gunning down the young dumb pilot (why would you run in a straight line in front of an airplane, ....did he think he could out run it? Just run into the woods dummy) is just garbage. There is a famous story that many WWI movies took liberties with about a pilot saluting another pilot who's guns jammed, but the story is true. It was a German Ace, Ernst Udet who spared Georges Gunymeyer when Gunymeyers guns jammed by waving and flying off.  And it was the allies who broke the treaty against incendiary ammunition and started lighting up the fuel tanks of German planes with fiery bullets. The German pilots actually flew with chivalry and honor for the most part from all accounts, so to do something so cheap as that scene just makes you hate the movie even more.  That and the only German plane you get to see other than the Gotha are the Fokker Triplanes and they weren't even on the battlefield yet and when they were finally on the battlefield they weren't the only planes in the air as they made just over 200 of them that actually saw combat duty. Where were the Pfalz's, Halberstadts, and more importantly the Albatrosses?  I mean if you're going to paint it in CGI then you can make anything you want. They should have had SPADS, and they shouldn't have given them Nieuport 17s as they weren't out yet. If they were flying Nieuports it would have been 11's (with a single Lewis on the top wing).

I think FLYBOYS is excellent throughout, with nary a false step along the way. Okay, I'll grant that some of the aerial CGI is unconvincing, but the great majority of it adds exciting action - - and who really cares if a physicist might find fault? Staging is brilliant, treating us to plenty of period detail, and the story is taut, with lots of intriguing characters about whom I truly care. I do not find FLYBOYS excessively clich&eacute;d. Indeed, the screenwriters (Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward) quite often back off from easy stereotypes. If anything, the fine cast UNDERacts, which is a refreshing change from other films in this genre. Particular praise goes to James Franco as Blaine Rawlings, Jean Reno as a believable Captain Georges Thenault, and Jennifer Decker as a sweet French girl named Lucienne. The love bypath within this film demonstrates how sensitive the writers are to avoiding the typical Hollywood gimmick of throwing in a boy-girl relationship that eventually overpowers the essential plot line (PEARL HARBOR, TITANIC). Here, the characters of Blaine and Lucienne are treated honestly, with the respect they deserve, and not flung into the sack after knowing each other for five minutes. I'm sorry that this film was not successful at the box office, for director Tony Bill and his massive crew do a fabulous job of storytelling, and I am proud and unashamed to add it among my favorite war movies of all time.

Firstly, I have always loved biplanes and biplane warfare and, as usual, this title looked sad and lonely on Amazon Instant Watch and in need of a review.  So here we are.The only really positive thing I can find to say about this movie is that it happens to be about a fascinating period of history.  If you think about it flying around in a rickety wooden plane is a pretty daring thing to do even if people aren't shooting at you.  That and the inevitable thoughts of Snoopy and his Snoopwith Camel make WWI aviation a very attractive topic.No, the problem comes in right about the time the movie starts.  If there's a standard war movie cliche line or shot that is laying about to be redone this movie redoes it.  Often.  And badly.  You've got the wistful French girl looking to the sky as planes fly overhead.  You've got the cockpit to cockpit waves goodbye as one pilot's plane goes down in flames.  Everything that you've seen in every war movie before, you see here again.  I guess you can look at this as a good retrospective of other cheesy war films if you really wanted to stretch it.Also, a note on special effects.  Considering when this movie was made, the CGI in this sucker are pretty abominable.  Leave aside for a moment the completely bogus dogfights with dozens of fliers in undisturbed tight formation while anti-aircraft fire belches into the sky around them.  Leave aside the numerical failure as 20 planes go out, 5 planes come back and somehow only 3 pilots were lost.  As if that was not enough, the whole thing is littered with those special effects that make you think, ""Hmm.  They put that in just so it would look 3D in the theatre version of the film.""  It's a lot of visual drama just for the sake of visual drama.In summary, totally unwatchable and beyond my ability to tolerate for more than an hour.  I had such high hopes but sadly every single one of them was utterly disappointed by this film.  Bah.---As always I endeavor to make my reviews as helpful as possible.

And director Tony Bill does not disappoint: the sequences of aerial combat are as thrilling as any military action ever recreated on film.

The effects are what one should watch this movie for, as they are able to induce suspended disbelief in even the most jaded viewer. One is left with a sense of respect for the men who did fly these planes back when there were no parachutes. In fact, the Prince evinced renewed interest in his great grandfather who few a biplane in WWI for the British. So it wasn't a waste of time at all.

During World War I, a group of American pilots joined the fighting in Europe before the United States entered the war in 1918.  Flying for the French, they were named the Lafayette Escadrille.  The movie follows five or six freshly arrived pilots, most notably James Franco as Texan Blaine Rawlings, as they train and learn how to fly and ultimately join the war as they take on German fighters, most notably the Black Falcon, a German pilot who doesn't follow the ""rules of war.""  All in all, this was a pretty good movie.  It's by no means a great movie, but it kept me entertained for the full 140 minute running time.  The added love story isn't as bad as I thought it'd be, but the movie didn't need that storyline.  It would have been better if the storyline focused primarily on the pilots and the dogfights, which are the high points of the movie.  Go see this movie for the dogfights, especially the zeppelin attack on Paris and the final showdown between Rawlings and the Black Falcon!One of the complaints of the movie was that it is too cliched, and this is partly true, but for me it felt like the actors did the best they could with what they have.  James Franco gets top billing as Texan Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher who joins the war after his ranch went under.  Along with flying with the Escadrille, he falls in love with a French girl, Lucien (French beauty Jennifer Decker), who can't speak English.  My favorite character is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), the veteran pilot who slowly opens up to the new pilots.  The rest of the young pilots who arrive with Rawlings include Phillip Winchester as William Jensen, the golden boy who knows he'll become a hero, Tyler Labine as Briggs Lowry, a young man from a rich family who is trying to prove himself to his father, Abdul Salis as Eugene Skinner, the lone African-American pilot in the group who must prove himself while also dealing with some racism, and David Ellison as Eddie Beagle, the struggling pilot who may or may not have a suspicious background.  Jean Reno is excellent in a small part as the captain of the squadron, Capt. Thenault, but it's too bad he couldn't have been used more.The soon to be released two-disc DVD, Jan. 30, 2007, will offer a boatload of special features which I'm definitely looking forward to watching.  There will be several making of featurettes, some history about the real Lafayette Escadrille, an audio commentary with director Tony Bill and producer Dean Devlin, deleted scenes, trailers, and a Flyboys Squadron DVD-rom game.  So for a movie with some excellent dogfights and aerial sequences, a pretty good ensemble cast, and a not so bad love story, look for the two-disc DVD of Flyboys in January!",4,Pretty good WWI aerial drama,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2851,"['Flyboys', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'theaters', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'scare', 'away', 'above', 'average', 'WWI', 'period', 'drama', 'World', 'War', 'group', 'American', 'pilots', 'joined', 'fighting', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'entered', 'war', '1918', 'Flying', 'French', 'were', 'named', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'movie', 'five', 'six', 'freshly', 'arrived', 'pilots', 'most', 'notably', 'James', 'Franco', 'Texan', 'Blaine', 'Rawlings', 'train', 'learn', 'how', 'fly', 'ultimately', 'join', 'war', 'take', 'German', 'fighters', 'most', 'notably', 'Black', 'Falcon', 'German', 'pilot', 'who', ""n't"", 'follow', 'rules', 'war', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'kept', 'entertained', 'full', '140', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'added', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'storyline', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'storyline', 'focused', 'primarily', 'pilots', 'dogfights', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'movie', 'Go', 'see', 'movie', 'dogfights', 'especially', 'zeppelin', 'attack', 'Paris', 'final', 'showdown', 'Rawlings', 'Black', 'Falcon', 'One', 'complaints', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'cliched', 'partly', 'true', 'felt', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'have', 'James', 'Franco', 'top', 'billing', 'Texan', 'Blaine', 'Rawlings', 'young', 'rancher', 'who', 'war', 'ranch', 'went', 'flying', 'Escadrille', 'love', 'French', 'girl', 'Lucien', 'French', 'beauty', 'Jennifer', 'Decker', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'favorite', 'character', 'Reed', 'Cassidy', 'Martin', 'Henderson', 'veteran', 'pilot', 'who', 'slowly', 'up', 'new', 'pilots', 'rest', 'young', 'pilots', 'who', 'arrive', 'Rawlings', 'include', 'Phillip', 'Winchester', 'William', 'Jensen', 'golden', 'boy', 'who', ""'ll"", 'become', 'hero', 'Tyler', 'Labine', 'Briggs', 'Lowry', 'young', 'man', 'rich', 'family', 'who', 'trying', 'prove', 'father', 'Abdul', 'Salis', 'Eugene', 'Skinner', 'lone', 'African-American', 'pilot', 'group', 'who', 'must', 'prove', 'also', 'dealing', 'racism', 'David', 'Ellison', 'Eddie', 'Beagle', 'struggling', 'pilot', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'suspicious', 'background', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'excellent', 'small', 'part', 'captain', 'squadron', 'Capt', 'Thenault', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'used', 'more.The', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'Jan.', '30', '2007', 'will', 'offer', 'boatload', 'special', 'features', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'will', 'be', 'several', 'making', 'featurettes', 'history', 'real', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tony', 'Bill', 'producer', 'Dean', 'Devlin', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'Flyboys', 'Squadron', 'DVD-rom', 'game', 'So', 'movie', 'excellent', 'dogfights', 'aerial', 'sequences', 'pretty', 'good', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'love', 'story', 'look', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'Flyboys', 'January']",N/A

1036439,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000KX0HIC,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Flyboys is rather a disappointment even if you're not expecting much. The Lafayette Escadrille - a French squadron of American pilots who fought in the First World War before the USA entered the conflict - is a great subject for a film, but somehow keeps on falling short. William Wellman's semi-autobiographical Lafayette Escadrille was so brutally re-edited by the studio that he never made another film, yet Tony Bill's film feels like it could have done with a firmer hand somewhere down the line. Rather than a gritty, brutally realistic war movie it harks back to silent cinema and WW2 flagwavers, concentrating on often-cartoonish heroics by one-dimensional characters unmemorably played by a bland cast. With a charismatic star in the lead this might not have been an insurmountable problem, but with only Jean Reno as their commander providing any star quality the film is often as flat as the ill-advised digital photography that makes much of the film look like a Turner TV movie at times. Even on the small screen its lack of detail, depth and limited colour range are distractingly problematic. It doesn't make particularly good use of its 138-minute running time and there's surprisingly little sense of time or place either. The characters' attitudes are often more late than early-20th century while its attitude to accuracy is schizophrenic: it gets a lot of pertinent small details right while larger ones slip by unchecked if they look cool enough (if the film is to be believed, the German air force consisted almost entirely of red triplanes).As vanity projects go (the film was allegedly largely financed by co-star David Ellison's billionaire father), it's certainly not as disastrous as Gunbus/Sky Bandits, but like that forgotten box-office fiasco it suffers from trying to make an old-fashioned gung ho adventure set in the one war in which such comic book heroics have never seemed at home. Using the industrial killing fields of the first modern war as a backdrop for an action movie seems almost like setting The Great Escape in Auschwitz. But even ignoring that, it fails to work on its own terms as a simple adventure story. There's far too much unconvincing melodrama, be it James Franco carrying out an unlikely rescue of a pilot crashed in No Man's Land or an even more unlikely rescue of his sweetheart and her siblings from behind German lines. However, even these cannot prepare you for the absurdity of the way he finally takes on the dastardly homicidal Hun in the underwhelming finale: all that's missing is Franco saying ""Sayonara, sucker!"" It's not that such things couldn't or didn't happen as that the film fails to sell them in a more cynical age.But the biggest problem is the aerial scenes, primarily dependent on Cgi. You may not always be able to see the joins, but it's often curiously unconvincing as weightless planes defy the laws of aerodynamics for a cool shot, with the mayhem often cut short because computer-rendering time is so expensive. The camera may be able to get right in the thick of the action, but you never once feel like you're flying with the characters and it's never as impressive as the kind of footage the likes of Skeets Kelly and Johnny Jordan were able to get in the The Blue Max and Aces High, let alone earlier classics like Wings and The Dawn Patrol. And there's the problem that when you know it's just pixels rather than real people in real planes, all sense of danger and peril is gone. CGI may be easier and safer, but who says it SHOULD be easier? The choreography of the dogfights isn't that impressive either - for the first half of the film adequate seems to be the aim, with only a sequence where the pilots take on German planes strafing refugee columns really catching fire and living up to its potential. Even an attack on a Zeppelin seems more okay than inspired. Certainly there's nothing in the film to compare to the dazzling but brief Hell's Angels scenes in The Aviator. Adding to the general lack of inspiration is Trevor Rabin's score, which wears the film's temp track proudly on its sleeve - parts of it follow The Patriot so closely that you wonder why they didn't just give John Williams a screen credit of his own.It's watchable enough if you're in an undemanding mood, and Jennifer Decker makes an appealing leading lady, but it's hard to shake the feeling that the material would have worked better as a weekly TV series - though, if it were anything like this film, one that would probably be cancelled after a handful of episodes.",2,Distinctly Earthbound,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,4540,"['Flyboys', 'rather', 'disappointment', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'French', 'squadron', 'American', 'pilots', 'who', 'fought', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'USA', 'entered', 'conflict', 'great', 'subject', 'film', 'somehow', 'falling', 'short', 'William', 'Wellman', 'semi-autobiographical', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'was', 'so', 'brutally', 're-edited', 'studio', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'yet', 'Tony', 'Bill', 'film', 'feels', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'firmer', 'hand', 'somewhere', 'line', 'Rather', 'gritty', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'war', 'movie', 'back', 'silent', 'cinema', 'WW2', 'flagwavers', 'concentrating', 'often-cartoonish', 'heroics', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'unmemorably', 'played', 'bland', 'cast', 'charismatic', 'star', 'lead', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'insurmountable', 'problem', 'only', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'commander', 'providing', 'star', 'quality', 'film', 'often', 'as', 'flat', 'ill-advised', 'digital', 'photography', 'much', 'film', 'look', 'Turner', 'TV', 'movie', 'times', 'Even', 'small', 'screen', 'lack', 'detail', 'depth', 'limited', 'colour', 'range', 'are', 'distractingly', 'problematic', ""n't"", 'make', 'particularly', 'good', 'use', '138-minute', 'running', 'time', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'either', 'characters', 'attitudes', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'late', 'early-20th', 'century', 'attitude', 'accuracy', 'schizophrenic', 'lot', 'pertinent', 'small', 'details', 'right', 'larger', 'ones', 'slip', 'unchecked', 'look', 'cool', 'enough', 'film', 'be', 'believed', 'German', 'air', 'force', 'consisted', 'almost', 'entirely', 'red', 'triplanes', '.As', 'vanity', 'projects', 'go', 'film', 'was', 'allegedly', 'largely', 'financed', 'co-star', 'David', 'Ellison', 'billionaire', 'father', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'disastrous', 'Gunbus/Sky', 'Bandits', 'forgotten', 'box-office', 'fiasco', 'trying', 'make', 'old-fashioned', 'gung', 'ho', 'adventure', 'set', 'one', 'war', 'such', 'comic', 'book', 'heroics', 'have', 'never', 'seemed', 'home', 'Using', 'industrial', 'killing', 'fields', 'first', 'modern', 'war', 'backdrop', 'action', 'movie', 'almost', 'setting', 'Great', 'Escape', 'Auschwitz', 'even', 'ignoring', 'work', 'own', 'terms', 'simple', 'adventure', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'unconvincing', 'melodrama', 'be', 'James', 'Franco', 'carrying', 'out', 'unlikely', 'rescue', 'pilot', 'crashed', 'Man', 'Land', 'even', 'more', 'unlikely', 'rescue', 'sweetheart', 'siblings', 'German', 'lines', 'However', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'prepare', 'absurdity', 'way', 'finally', 'dastardly', 'homicidal', 'Hun', 'underwhelming', 'finale', 'missing', 'Franco', 'saying', 'Sayonara', 'sucker', 'not', 'such', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'film', 'sell', 'more', 'cynical', 'biggest', 'problem', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'primarily', 'dependent', 'Cgi', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'joins', 'often', 'curiously', 'unconvincing', 'weightless', 'planes', 'defy', 'laws', 'aerodynamics', 'cool', 'shot', 'mayhem', 'often', 'cut', 'short', 'computer-rendering', 'time', 'so', 'expensive', 'camera', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'right', 'thick', 'action', 'never', 'once', 'feel', ""'re"", 'flying', 'characters', 'never', 'as', 'impressive', 'kind', 'footage', 'likes', 'Skeets', 'Kelly', 'Johnny', 'Jordan', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'Blue', 'Max', 'Aces', 'High', 'let', 'alone', 'earlier', 'classics', 'Wings', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'problem', 'when', 'know', 'just', 'pixels', 'rather', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'planes', 'sense', 'danger', 'peril', 'gone', 'CGI', 'may', 'be', 'easier', 'safer', 'who', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'easier', 'choreography', 'dogfights', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'adequate', 'be', 'aim', 'only', 'sequence', 'where', 'pilots', 'take', 'German', 'planes', 'strafing', 'refugee', 'columns', 'really', 'catching', 'fire', 'living', 'up', 'potential', 'Even', 'attack', 'Zeppelin', 'more', 'okay', 'inspired', 'Certainly', 'nothing', 'film', 'compare', 'dazzling', 'brief', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'scenes', 'Aviator', 'Adding', 'general', 'lack', 'inspiration', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'score', 'film', 'temp', 'track', 'proudly', 'sleeve', 'parts', 'follow', 'Patriot', 'so', 'closely', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'John', 'Williams', 'screen', 'credit', 'own.It', 'watchable', 'enough', ""'re"", 'undemanding', 'mood', 'Jennifer', 'Decker', 'appealing', 'leading', 'lady', 'hard', 'shake', 'feeling', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'weekly', 'TV', 'series', 'were', 'anything', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'cancelled', 'handful', 'episodes']",N/A

It's not a bad start, but still his character could have been more three dimensional with a better script and direction. Actually, he and other members of the Lafayette Escadrill are not given many chances to shine, especially on the ground.In fact, the back stories of the volunteers sometimes look clich&eacute;d and Blaine's sub-plot involving a French farm girl drags a bit. Jean Reno plays a French captain who has to train the new recruits patiently, but like ""The Da Vinci Code,"" somehow the director missed the opportunity to use Reno's unique persona effectively.Still, all these flaws would be forgotten once the film starts showing the dogfights, which, I think, are mostly done with CGIs, but still impressive and thrilling.

1036446,AV37WGFZH7PIO,B000KX0HIC,"Vincent Tesi ""Vinny""","[4, 5]","Fly Boys is one of the few films ever made that acknowledges the heroism of WWI fighter pilots.  The film's action aerial shots are amazing. The authenticity of the WWI planes, gunfire, and interplay between pilots is beautifully captured.  Howard Hughes would have been impressed. Unfortunately the lead, James Franco gives a wooden performance as the squadron leader. The supporting cast of pilots all give credible performances, but the film doesn't gain acclaimed status because of the acting.  I never felt emotionally connected to the lead characters and the romantic storyline did nothing to enhance the drama the director so desperately wanted to achieve.  The most immprobable scene involves Franco's rescue of his French girlfriend. While a dozen or so German troops invade the girl's home, she slips away and hides nearby; that is believable.  What is preposterous is when Franco flies his plane to a nearby field without any of the German soldiers seeing or hearing it.  Of course Franco and the French girl escape under a hail of German gunfire.  The characterizations of the other pilots are well crafted.  The Black pilot who at first is not readily welcomed, the rich, cultured pilot who is seeking his father's approval, the religious pilot who accepts his duty, the unemotional ace, the suspected ""spy"", and the small town hero who doubts his courage all contribute to the on screen cammaraderie.

1036447,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000KX0HIC,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[5, 7]","Flyboys is the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, an elite group of flyers during WWI that US citizens were allowed to join before America had formally entered the war. Much like the French Foreign Legion, it was made up of men who, for the most part, were running away from something or were out for adventure. One man in particular from Texas, Blaine Rawlings - played engagingly by James Franco (James Dean, Spiderman) - is particularly laid back about the whole affair, until he finds himself in his first dogfight. Then reality sets in and he realizes why the average life expectancy for these flyers is three to six weeks.Director Tony Bill (The Sting - producer) gives his film a traditional epic look with gorgeous cinematography, sweeping locations and authentic details, while also using CGI technology to good effect in the flying sequences. This film far surpasses The Aviator, which did little more than prepare the way for this more masterful handling of early military aviation and the dogfight sequences in particular. There are also some exciting rescue missions that have us on the edge of our seats, as well as the downing of a zeppelin that has set out to bomb Paris.Besides the action in the air and on the ground, there is a sweet love story between Franco's character, Rawlings, and a French country girl named Laura, played winsomely by Ruth Bradley. There are also some well-developed character studies among the rest of the pilots:  a black boxer-turned-pilot, played by Abdul Salis; a Bible-reading Christian, played by Michael Jibson, who sings ""Onward Christian Soldiers"" as he goes in for a kill; a suspected spy, played by David Ellison; etc. Jean Reno does a terrific job as Captain Thenault, their instructor and commanding officer, as does Tyler Labine as head flyer Briggs, who keeps a lion as a pet.If there were one word I would use to describe the story and relationships in this film it would be ""grace."" There are a lot of screw-ups along the way, but there always seems to be an attitude of grace among the participants. This brings the men together as a family, and gives the film a very godly quality. WWI fighter pilots had a harrowing job to do. If their planes caught fire, they had only three options:  burn to death, jump and hope for the best (there were no parachutes) or kill themselves with a pistol. So, they were heroes of the first order. Giving the story plenty of grace helps to make it human and raise it above the typical action-adventure film.Though the film is rated PG-13 for war violence, it is handled with surprising good taste, and there is also a refreshing absence of sex and profanity, though there is a small amount of the latter. The DVD is almost absent of extra features, which is a shame. People who like reality, history, aviation and a good story will like this film. Those who want to escape reality into an artificial world of sensory overload, won't.Waitsel Smith",5,"TOP-NOTCH FILM, FULL OF ACTION AND GRACE",1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2947,"['Flyboys', 'true', 'story', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'elite', 'group', 'flyers', 'WWI', 'US', 'citizens', 'were', 'allowed', 'join', 'America', 'had', 'formally', 'entered', 'war', 'Much', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'was', 'made', 'men', 'who', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'running', 'away', 'something', 'were', 'out', 'adventure', 'One', 'man', 'particular', 'Texas', 'Blaine', 'Rawlings', 'played', 'engagingly', 'James', 'Franco', 'James', 'Dean', 'Spiderman', 'particularly', 'laid', 'back', 'whole', 'affair', 'first', 'dogfight', 'Then', 'reality', 'sets', 'why', 'average', 'life', 'expectancy', 'flyers', 'three', 'six', 'weeks.Director', 'Tony', 'Bill', 'Sting', 'producer', 'film', 'traditional', 'epic', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'sweeping', 'locations', 'authentic', 'details', 'also', 'using', 'CGI', 'technology', 'good', 'effect', 'flying', 'sequences', 'film', 'far', 'Aviator', 'did', 'little', 'more', 'prepare', 'way', 'more', 'masterful', 'handling', 'early', 'military', 'aviation', 'dogfight', 'sequences', 'particular', 'are', 'also', 'exciting', 'rescue', 'missions', 'have', 'edge', 'seats', 'as', 'well', 'downing', 'zeppelin', 'set', 'out', 'bomb', 'Paris.Besides', 'action', 'air', 'ground', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'Franco', 'character', 'Rawlings', 'French', 'country', 'girl', 'named', 'Laura', 'played', 'winsomely', 'Ruth', 'Bradley', 'are', 'also', 'well-developed', 'character', 'studies', 'rest', 'pilots', 'black', 'boxer-turned-pilot', 'played', 'Abdul', 'Salis', 'Bible-reading', 'Christian', 'played', 'Michael', 'Jibson', 'who', 'Onward', 'Christian', 'Soldiers', 'kill', 'suspected', 'spy', 'played', 'David', 'Ellison', 'etc', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'terrific', 'job', 'Captain', 'Thenault', 'instructor', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Tyler', 'Labine', 'head', 'flyer', 'Briggs', 'who', 'lion', 'pet.If', 'were', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'use', 'describe', 'story', 'relationships', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'grace', 'are', 'lot', 'screw-ups', 'way', 'there', 'always', 'be', 'attitude', 'grace', 'participants', 'men', 'together', 'family', 'film', 'very', 'godly', 'quality', 'WWI', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'had', 'harrowing', 'job', 'do', 'planes', 'caught', 'fire', 'had', 'only', 'three', 'options', 'burn', 'death', 'jump', 'hope', 'best', 'were', 'parachutes', 'kill', 'pistol', 'So', 'were', 'heroes', 'first', 'order', 'Giving', 'story', 'plenty', 'grace', 'make', 'human', 'raise', 'typical', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'war', 'violence', 'handled', 'surprising', 'good', 'taste', 'also', 'refreshing', 'absence', 'sex', 'profanity', 'small', 'amount', 'latter', 'DVD', 'almost', 'absent', 'extra', 'features', 'shame', 'People', 'who', 'like', 'reality', 'history', 'aviation', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'who', 'want', 'escape', 'reality', 'artificial', 'world', 'sensory', 'overload', ""won't.Waitsel"", 'Smith']",N/A
