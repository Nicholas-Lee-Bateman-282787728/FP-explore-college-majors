410973,AADJXNY9HSKJF,6304279000,Aaron,"[1, 1]","This is probably one of my favorite comedies of all-time. Is it corny? Definitely. So it might take a certain kind of person to enjoy it. Like the first movie, the Bradys are living in the 90's yet them themselves seem to be trapped in the 70's unaware of how bizarre they seem. In this one, Carol's supposed first husband Roy suddenly shows up at the unsuspecting Brady's. Yet meanwhile, as in the first one, each family member is having their own private dramas. Greg and Marsha are attracted to each other, Jan is involved with an imaginary boyfriend, Cindy lost her doll, etc. Shelly Long is great as Carol and Alice does a great job too, but I think Jan steals the show. She's hillarious. So, if you like corny comedy, you can't go wrong with this.",5,A Riot,1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,753,"['probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedies', 'all-time', 'corny', 'Definitely', 'might', 'take', 'certain', 'kind', 'person', 'enjoy', 'first', 'movie', 'Bradys', 'are', 'living', '90', 'yet', 'seem', 'be', 'trapped', '70', 'unaware', 'how', 'bizarre', 'seem', 'one', 'Carol', 'supposed', 'first', 'husband', 'Roy', 'suddenly', 'up', 'unsuspecting', 'Brady', 'meanwhile', 'first', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'having', 'own', 'private', 'dramas', 'Greg', 'Marsha', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'Jan', 'involved', 'imaginary', 'boyfriend', 'Cindy', 'lost', 'doll', 'etc', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'great', 'Carol', 'Alice', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'think', 'Jan', 'show', 'hillarious', 'So', 'like', 'corny', 'comedy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",A Very Brady Sequel VHS

410975,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304279000,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I adored the first `Brady Bunch' movie.  I was such a huge fan of the show (reruns) as a child and to watch the sitcom get ripped apart in such a respectful way (you can tell that they wanted to honor the films ridiculousness as apposed to trash it) gave me such a warm and fuzzy feeling all over.  What is nice about this `Brady Bunch' sequel is that it builds off the same scenario, trapping the Brady's in a time warp where there brand of style and general life keeps them segregated from the rest of society, and in doing this they have set themselves up for ample laughs.  What is sad at the same time though is that a lot of the laughs seem repetitive, as if we've seen this once before.The film follows the Brady's as they are faced with a wrench in their tightly knit family circle.  Yes, a man shows up at their front door claiming to be Carol's long presumed dead husband Roy Martin.  Roy is actually Trevor, an imposter wanting to get his hands on a priceless artifact that Roy gave to Carol before he disappeared.  The Brady's are oblivious to this though, and their lovely home begins to crumble as this man begins to take root in their lives.The real story though is taking place in the attic, where Greg and Marcia find themselves rooming together.  Finally realizing that they aren't technically brother and sister their attraction to one another starts burning a whole in their conscience for it just seems so wrong yet feels so right.Thanks to the spot on acting done on the part of the entire Brady clan (Long, Cole, Taylor, Barnes, Cox, Sutera, Hack & Soffer) not to mention the witty script that keeps fresh in mind all the reasons we loved and or hated the inspiration, `A Very Brady Sequel' serves up some very worthy laughs.  Christine Taylor (who honestly should have received an Oscar nomination for her performance in `The Brady Bunch Movie') is not necessarily best-in-show here, her performance being upstaged by actors such as Jennifer Elise Cox, who does an extraordinary Jan.Like I mentioned on the outset, the film does seem a bit repetitious at times, and the original was funnier in my opinion (maybe because it felt so much fresher).  I wasn't too thrilled about the throwbacks to other popular sitcoms (`I Dream of Genie' and `Gilligan's Island') being littered into the script, although the `Gilligan' riff was pretty funny.  The plot involving Carol's husband was a bit of a stretch, but it served its purpose in giving this sequel a purpose.  In the end it delivered the laughs and was consistent so I'd recommend it, but I won't say that it was better than the first because the first was almost too good to be true.",4,"I wouldn't say `funnier', but it surely is just as entertaining...",1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,2657,"['adored', 'first', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movie', 'was', 'such', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'reruns', 'child', 'watch', 'sitcom', 'get', 'ripped', 'apart', 'such', 'respectful', 'way', 'can', 'tell', 'wanted', 'honor', 'films', 'ridiculousness', 'apposed', 'trash', 'gave', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'over', 'What', 'nice', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'sequel', 'same', 'scenario', 'trapping', 'Brady', 'time', 'warp', 'where', 'brand', 'style', 'general', 'life', 'segregated', 'rest', 'society', 'doing', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'ample', 'laughs', 'What', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'though', 'lot', 'laughs', 'seem', 'repetitive', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'once', 'before.The', 'film', 'Brady', 'are', 'faced', 'wrench', 'tightly', 'knit', 'family', 'circle', 'Yes', 'man', 'up', 'front', 'door', 'claiming', 'be', 'Carol', 'long', 'presumed', 'dead', 'husband', 'Roy', 'Martin', 'Roy', 'actually', 'Trevor', 'imposter', 'wanting', 'get', 'hands', 'priceless', 'artifact', 'Roy', 'gave', 'Carol', 'disappeared', 'Brady', 'are', 'oblivious', 'though', 'lovely', 'home', 'crumble', 'man', 'take', 'root', 'lives.The', 'real', 'story', 'though', 'taking', 'place', 'attic', 'where', 'Greg', 'Marcia', 'find', 'rooming', 'together', 'Finally', 'realizing', 'are', ""n't"", 'technically', 'brother', 'sister', 'attraction', 'one', 'burning', 'whole', 'conscience', 'just', 'so', 'wrong', 'yet', 'feels', 'so', 'spot', 'acting', 'done', 'part', 'entire', 'Brady', 'clan', 'Long', 'Cole', 'Taylor', 'Barnes', 'Cox', 'Sutera', 'Hack', 'Soffer', 'not', 'mention', 'witty', 'script', 'fresh', 'mind', 'reasons', 'loved', 'hated', 'inspiration', 'Very', 'Brady', 'Sequel', 'up', 'very', 'worthy', 'laughs', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'who', 'honestly', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best-in-show', 'here', 'performance', 'being', 'upstaged', 'actors', 'such', 'Jennifer', 'Elise', 'Cox', 'who', 'extraordinary', 'Jan.Like', 'mentioned', 'outset', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'repetitious', 'times', 'original', 'was', 'funnier', 'opinion', 'maybe', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'fresher', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'throwbacks', 'other', 'popular', 'sitcoms', 'Dream', 'Genie', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'being', 'littered', 'script', 'Gilligan', 'riff', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'plot', 'involving', 'Carol', 'husband', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', 'served', 'purpose', 'giving', 'sequel', 'purpose', 'end', 'delivered', 'laughs', 'was', 'consistent', 'so', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'first', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true']",A Very Brady Sequel VHS

The sexual tension between the two is hilarious and leaves us with a will they won't they idea which of course keeps the movie interesting.

While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole.This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures.The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new ""incest"" angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia (""Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?"") that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up ""tripping with the Bradys"".While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one.As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie.

But after seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised at how they poked fun at the innocence of the family.  I found it clever how they put them in the 90's with the same woredrobes and attitudes they had in the tv show. The original throws in unexpected gags and inside jokes that, for instance, the next door neighbor is attracted to all the Brady boys and would obvious take advantage of one if she could, Marsha is full of herself and the guys don't only want her but some girls do too, lol. Oh plus Jan is just a Psycho, lol.With all that said, now to the squel, it takes all those little things and improves on them.  For instance there's a sick relationship between Marsha and Greg involving where they start finding themselves attracted to each other. Which in itself offers some pretty funny scenes. Tim Matheson (Animal House, 1941) is a good improvement to the sequel as Mr.s Bradie's so called missing husband.

410991,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,6304279000,Michael J. Mazza,"[1, 2]","""A Very Brady Sequel,"" directed by Arlene Sanford, continues the comic adventures of the recast Brady clan (headed by Shelley Long as Carol and Gary Cole as Mike). Like the preceding film, this is a campy but affectionate riff on the original ""Brady Bunch"" television series.In ""Sequel,"" a man claiming to be Roy Martin (Carol's first husband) enters the Brady's lives. It's a bizarre situation (unthinkable as a plot in the original series!), and Carol and the bunch must figure out how to deal with this challenge to their established family. Clever twists on plot points from the original series are interwoven as subplots in the film; Jan's imaginary boyfriend, for example, is a key running gag (which has a marvelous resolution, and well showcases Jennifer Elise Cox's comic appeal). Another key subplot involves an unexpected attraction between step-siblings Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes) and Marcia (Christine Taylor); the filmmakers, I believe, keep this potentially kinky theme within the bounds of good taste.""Sequel"" continues the first film's running gag that the Bradys are stuck in a sort of 70s time warp, and are oblivious to 90s culture. Some of this ""fish-out-of-water"" humor is weak; the movie Bradys are at their best and funniest, I believe, when they are wholly in their own groovy element. The cast members seem really comfortable in their roles, and have a great chemistry together. As an ensemble they hit just the right balance between campiness and genuine familial affection.Overall, ""Sequel"" gave me lots of smiles and chuckles, and the 70s-style costumes provided constant visual appeal.

A fan of the first one, but I have to say the sequel's even funnier. I'm not sure why. Maybe because of the scene with Alice and Roy (Tim Matheson) when Alice puts the mushrooms she finds in his bag in his dinner and he completely trips out. Whatever the case, pure cheesy entertainment awaits you with A Very Brady Sequel. Just like in the first one, the world has changed all around the Brady's, but the Brady's are very much the same. In this movie however, Carol's supposedly deceased husband Roy comes back into their lives, explaining that he didn't die in his archaeological adventures a few years back and had been hanging on to the hope that his wife Carol and their daughters, Cindy, Jan & Marsha would be there waiting for him. But Roy isn't who he seems...he's really Roy's evil assistant using Roy's name after his death to get to this horse statue the real Roy sent to Carol for safekeeping before he died. ""Roy"" is just out to get this horse, worth millions of dollars. The Brady's initially welcome him in, as per grand Brady tradition. But soon they find out there's more to ""Roy"" than they thought. The whole movie is just plain silly, but great because of that. If you enjoyed making fun of the Brady's as you grew up and you're in need of mindless entertainment, this sequel is for you.
