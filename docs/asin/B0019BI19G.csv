This movie was really touching, its about this boy who is the ""boyfriend"" of a gay couple in New York.  The couple take off to visit relatives for the holiday leaving our young ""Houseboy"" to spend Christmas alone.  He over heres a small piece -a tiny sound bite, of a conversation between his ""boyfriends"" and he discovers that he is not wanted by one of the two.  He decides that on Christmas Eve he is going to kill himself.  This is really a great movie, I know some people didnt like it because of the drugs and loveless sex, but that didnt bother me. I really felt for the ""Houseboy"" and I really liked the ending.  I dont know, there was just something really sweet about the whole movie that comes together nicely in the end.

1162907,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0019BI19G,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[18, 20]","Ricky (Nick May) is a cute twinkish 21 year old who is ""The Houseboy"" (2007) to a gay couple in New York City.  Or, more accurately, he is their frequent bed partner, or ""toy"" that they use to try to convince themselves that their relationship is as solid as it was when they first met ten years before.  When the couple goes to one of their parents for Christmas, Ricky is left alone to housesit and care for their small menagerie of fish, bunnies, hamsters and feral cats.What they don't know is that Ricky overheard one of them lament that he wanted a ""new toy"" for Christmas, which devastated the young man, who had recently become estranged from his family after coming out to them.  Already depressed by being alone during the holidays, and devastated at the thought of being tossed aside by the couple he thought loved him, he plans to commit suicide in their home on Christmas Eve, so that they will discover him when they return.  In the meantime, he hooks up with anonymous tricks he meets on the internet, agrees to go home with a kindly older man, and has a couple of dangerous liaisons with a rough-trade hood he met in a park.  The one bright spot of his week is meeting Blake (Blake Young-Fountain), a guy his own age who seems genuinely friendly and real, but is put off by Ricky's premature push toward intimacy.Despite some delightful eye candy, the film's overall impression is darkly emotional and somewhat depressing, at first.  Stick with it, however, as there are some surprises in store.  Acting is adequate, the direction a bit sloppy in parts, but, overall, this is a noteworthy dramatic film that won some kudos at gay film festivals, though a bit uneven for my taste.  Not rated, but likely would have been an NC-17 due to some full nudity, graphic drug use, and simulated sex.  DVD includes some outtakes.

Four stars is more than generous. But Nick May really did a fine job of acting in a less than stellar role.Ricky is a rather pudgy, scruffy, depressed twenty-one year old. He is left to spend Christmas alone when the middle aged Gay couple he has been sleeping with, leaves him to house sit their nasty, overfurnished flat, and feed their odd assortment of animals. Ricky can't celebrate Christmas with his family after coming out to his mother, so his holiday plans include being indiscriminately promiscuous, and committing suicide on Christmas Eve. His Christmas miracle comes when he makes friends with a black kid from the neighbourhood who has two lesbian mothers. Somehow this gives him the courage to keep living.Like I said, Nick May did an excellent job of making a cheesy role into a character you could sympathise with. It wasn't enough to make the film a masterpiece of cinema. But I've certainly seen worse movies.  I guess I should add that watching The Houseboy might be depressing enough to make you want to commit suicide.

He does a fantastic job creating a character who you can really sympathize with. He's this young kid who gets tangled up in a 3 way relationship with two older men (believe me, there are lot of old guys out there looking for that) and he realizes that nobody really cares about him. The two older guys go to visit their family and ditch him on Christmas. The boy ends up finding himself turning to sex just to get some affection. He tells his hookups he's going to kill himself just hoping that somebody will care enough to tell him not to do it. I really felt bad for this character. His parents disowned him and his sister is horrible too. The actor does a brilliant job of making this character feel like he's all alone in the world.There are a couple of horrible scenes in the movie that should have been left out. One involving a Santa and Mrs Clause jumping around and another involving an orgy. The orgy was just exploitative. Probably to try and get more people to watch the movie.

Nick May is very good in the title role and manages to create a sympathetic portrayal of a young guy desperately in need of love.

What you actually get is a few moments of interaction between these characters to establish the fact that the houseboy is no different than the other pets that the two men own, apart from the sex, I'm hoping. Treated more as a possession than a person, the houseboy recognizes this indifference and spends the entire film commiserating himself to whomever will listen. Having no common sense he internalizes this apathy as a valid judgement of his character and feels his only option is to kill himself. This comes across not only as ridiculous and unbelievable but also manipulative. This aspect is strengthened when he confesses to everyone he meets that he is going to kill himself on Christmas Eve, hoping, I guess, to provoke some concern for his miserable existence. Of course this makes him a perfect target for those who would advantage themselves at his expense, which he seems to not mind, after all his life is unremarkable anyway.

However he seems to genuinely like/love them both and it is Christmas and as he has been let down by his own family he thinks he is going to be with them. Except they are going away to one of their parents for `the holidays', and are leaving him with extensive directions on how to look after their love nest. This involves a lot of plant and fish feeding apparently.Before they leave Ricky overhears them talking about getting a `new toy' for Christmas and he knows they are referring to his position within the home. They leave and he is distraught, so he goes out and hooks up with an astonishing amounts of success with every low life cruiser on the planet and a few more besides. His first guy is into chicks except they lack any felating prowess - like we didn't know. He then lets them come back to his place and get up to all sorts of shenanigans, the sort you normally need to visit a `members club' for. He then announces on a number of occasions that he will commit suicide on Christmas Eve.Whilst the plot is somewhat limited, it is actually a quiet and warm film, with love and the lack of it as a central theme. Where I felt it fell down was in some average support performances and the comedy fairground music that kept on crashing into the mood of the thing. Whilst nearly all of the guys he picks up are universally self centred and actually horrible, there are some that redeem gayhood and men in general and at 71 minutes this did not drag.
