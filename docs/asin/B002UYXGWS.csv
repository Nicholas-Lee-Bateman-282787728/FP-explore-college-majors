1290854,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002UYXGWS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There's an honesty to `The Boys Are Back' (awful title for a genuinely good movie) that makes it so much better than I expected.  Sure, it has flaws, and there are clich&eacute;s that litter this `semi-biographical' film, but the overall feeling I'm left with is one of fractured beauty that makes me smile, cry and remember nearly every scene.The film tells the story of Joe Warr, a sweet yet immature father and husband who loses his world when his beautiful wife suddenly dies of cancer.  Having everything throw in the air, Joe dashes about trying to pick up every piece.  A big piece is his young son, Artie, who isn't quite sure how to greive the loss of his mother.  Throw in the mix an older son, from Joe's previous marriage, and you have a odd little family that blossoms out of failure.  Joe wasn't a very good dad to his eldest son Harry.  He left him when he was six and hasn't seen him since.  Harry grew up in England with his mother while Joe started his new family over in Australia.  Joe's job (sports writer) kept him even at arms length from Artie, but he certainly has a bond with the boy that Harry sees lacking in his own relationship.  Soon after his wife's death, Joe finds himself picking Harry up from the airport, and that is when the real life begins for these three `boys'.Don't get me wrong, there is a predictability here that one must expect.  The see-saw of emotions between father and sons is there, as well as tensions between in-laws and the `other woman', but they are all handled with so much care and a sliver of originality that one feels as though this is real.It's so incredibly moving.The acting here on all counts is semi flawless.  Clive Owen sinks into his role effortlessly, displaying raw depression and a earnestness to do right by his children (and most everyone else around him) despite constant failings.  Emma Booth has a nice turn as a beauty (yes, she is stunning) who catches Joe's eye, and I really love the way the relationship is handled in the film.  It is not as clich&eacute; as one might expect!  Both George McAnulty and Nicholas McAnulty really soar as Joe's sons, especially George who just captures every bit of confused emotional angst Harry is feeling at every waking moment.  Your heart breaks for him.The film does not play up the schmaltz, which is commendable.  It doesn't go for easy heart tugs, and when it does attempt to get your tear ducts working, it does so in a way that feels organic as apposed to manipulated.  Because of that, your not going to bawl your eyes out as easily as you would watching a number of other films, but you will feel in your heart what you don't feel with those other films; a real love.",5,Heartwarming and honest...,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2694,"['honesty', 'Boys', 'Are', 'Back', 'awful', 'title', 'genuinely', 'good', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'Sure', 'flaws', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'litter', 'semi-biographical', 'film', 'overall', 'feeling', ""'m"", 'left', 'one', 'fractured', 'beauty', 'smile', 'cry', 'remember', 'nearly', 'scene.The', 'film', 'story', 'Joe', 'Warr', 'sweet', 'yet', 'immature', 'father', 'husband', 'who', 'world', 'when', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'cancer', 'Having', 'everything', 'throw', 'air', 'Joe', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'piece', 'big', 'piece', 'young', 'son', 'Artie', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'greive', 'loss', 'mother', 'Throw', 'mix', 'older', 'son', 'Joe', 'previous', 'marriage', 'have', 'odd', 'little', 'family', 'failure', 'Joe', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'dad', 'eldest', 'son', 'Harry', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'six', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Harry', 'grew', 'up', 'England', 'mother', 'Joe', 'started', 'new', 'family', 'Australia', 'Joe', 'job', 'sports', 'writer', 'kept', 'even', 'arms', 'length', 'Artie', 'certainly', 'bond', 'boy', 'Harry', 'lacking', 'own', 'relationship', 'Soon', 'wife', 'death', 'Joe', 'picking', 'Harry', 'up', 'airport', 'when', 'real', 'life', 'three', ""boys'.Do"", ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'predictability', 'here', 'one', 'must', 'expect', 'see-saw', 'emotions', 'father', 'sons', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'tensions', 'in-laws', 'other', 'woman', 'are', 'handled', 'so', 'much', 'care', 'sliver', 'originality', 'one', 'feels', 'real.It', 'so', 'incredibly', 'moving.The', 'acting', 'here', 'counts', 'semi', 'flawless', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'sinks', 'role', 'effortlessly', 'displaying', 'raw', 'depression', 'earnestness', 'do', 'right', 'children', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'constant', 'failings', 'Emma', 'Booth', 'nice', 'turn', 'beauty', 'yes', 'stunning', 'who', 'Joe', 'eye', 'really', 'love', 'way', 'relationship', 'handled', 'film', 'not', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'George', 'McAnulty', 'Nicholas', 'McAnulty', 'really', 'soar', 'Joe', 'sons', 'especially', 'George', 'who', 'just', 'bit', 'confused', 'emotional', 'angst', 'Harry', 'feeling', 'waking', 'moment', 'heart', 'breaks', 'him.The', 'film', 'not', 'play', 'up', 'schmaltz', 'commendable', ""n't"", 'go', 'easy', 'heart', 'tugs', 'when', 'attempt', 'get', 'tear', 'ducts', 'working', 'so', 'way', 'organic', 'apposed', 'manipulated', 'not', 'going', 'bawl', 'eyes', 'out', 'as', 'easily', 'would', 'watching', 'number', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'feel', 'heart', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'other', 'films', 'real', 'love']",N/A
1290855,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002UYXGWS,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 1]","The Boys Are Back (2009) is one of those small indie films that people often don't discover in the theaters, but find on DVD or TV. I recently watched it on Showtime and found it to be a great gem of a movie (3.5 stars out of 5). Director Scott Hicks has brought us two other small but beautifully made films: Shine (1996) and Snow Falling On Cedars (1999). Clive Owen plays the lead character in The Boys Are Back, a husband and father who is both broken and free. His wife dies early in the movie, leaving him to reconcile his role as a father and a man. He left his first wife and son to live with his second wife. And they had a son of their own. As Owen's character Joe mourns his wife, he soon realizes he needs to reconnect with his first son who lives in England. Joe and his younger son live in Australia. The movie takes us on Joe's journey of reconnecting with his first son and learning how to parent his younger son. And Joe begins to understand what is most important for himself in living his own life.This film is a little flat and melodramatic at times, but it makes up for it with some great scenes and good story. I wasn't sure at first if Owen was the right fit for this character, but by the end of the movie, I was sold on him in the role. The young actor who plays the first son, George MacKay, is wonderfully brilliant as a tortured teen who doesn't understand his father or why he was left behind. The photography in the film is brilliant as it showcases the Australian landscape and some Aussie architecture as well. I especially love the newspaper building where Joe works, with its headlines in large print all over its glass facade.This is a small character-driven family drama, without any flash or sizzle, but just solid movie storytelling.",3,Broken Father,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1771,"['Boys', 'Are', 'Back', '2009', 'one', 'small', 'indie', 'films', 'people', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'discover', 'theaters', 'find', 'DVD', 'TV', 'recently', 'watched', 'Showtime', 'found', 'be', 'great', 'gem', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', '5', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'brought', 'two', 'other', 'small', 'beautifully', 'made', 'films', 'Shine', '1996', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', '1999', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'lead', 'character', 'Boys', 'Are', 'Back', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'broken', 'free', 'wife', 'early', 'movie', 'leaving', 'reconcile', 'role', 'father', 'man', 'left', 'first', 'wife', 'son', 'live', 'second', 'wife', 'had', 'son', 'own', 'Owen', 'character', 'Joe', 'wife', 'soon', 'reconnect', 'first', 'son', 'who', 'England', 'Joe', 'younger', 'son', 'live', 'Australia', 'movie', 'Joe', 'journey', 'reconnecting', 'first', 'son', 'learning', 'how', 'parent', 'younger', 'son', 'Joe', 'understand', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'living', 'own', 'life.This', 'film', 'little', 'flat', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'up', 'great', 'scenes', 'good', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'first', 'Owen', 'was', 'right', 'fit', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'sold', 'role', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'first', 'son', 'George', 'MacKay', 'wonderfully', 'brilliant', 'tortured', 'teen', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'father', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'photography', 'film', 'brilliant', 'Australian', 'landscape', 'Aussie', 'architecture', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'love', 'newspaper', 'building', 'where', 'Joe', 'headlines', 'large', 'print', 'glass', 'facade.This', 'small', 'character-driven', 'family', 'drama', 'flash', 'sizzle', 'just', 'solid', 'movie', 'storytelling']",N/A

The story is emotional and very touching.  It's well written and the best of this film is Clive Owen who delivers a great performance, and the two child actors are great.The lines are filled with emotional honesty.  It's mainly about fatherhood, but it also deals with choices and consequences.  It caught my attention the fact that when you cheat on your spouse, children feel you are cheating on them as well.  Henry, the teenager son from a previous marriage felt he was betrayed and abandoned by his father.  At the end of the movie he forgives his father and chooses to live with him and his brother.

Symington ""millenium reader""","[1, 1]","Other reviewers have outlined the story well enough, so all I can really add is that the acting and directing are absolutely superb in this film.  Often child actors are either annoying or pitifully inept at what they do, but the young boy (McAnulty) as well as the teenager (George McKay) are absolutely excellent to Clive Owen's father character. I would go so far as to say probably among the best child actors that I personally have ever seen (and I've watched a LOT of kid movies over the years). Owen, as always, is so completely believable in his role that the viewer is transported by him and his story.  The director knew just when to cut, when to focus, and what NOT to include to keep the film from getting sappy or uninteresting. Cinematography is also excellent, showcasing southern Australia like I've never seen it before.

1290858,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002UYXGWS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","In 2009, ""The Boys are Back"" is a film from BBC films, adapted from the novel ""The Boys are Back in Town"" by Simon Carr and was distributed in the US from Miramax Films.The film is directed by Scott Hicks (""""Snow Falling on Cedars"", ""No Reservations"", ""Shine"") and a screenplay adaptation by Allan Cubitt (""The Hound of Baskervilles"", ""Anna Karenina: TV Series"").  The film features cinematography by Greig Fraser (""Spider"", ""Last Ride"", ""Bright Star"") and music by composer Hal Lindes (""Apparitions"", ""Little Devil"", ""Losing Gemma"").""The Boys are Back"" is about a busy sportswriter in Australia named Joe Warr (played by Clive Owen, ""Sin City"", ""Children of Men"", ""Shoot `Em Up"").  Because he travels so much, his wife Katy (played by Laura Fraser, ""The Passion"", ""The Flying Scotsman"", ""No Holds Bard"") raises their five-year-old son Artie (played by Nicholas McAnulty).For Joe, his connection with Artie is brief since he works a lot and their main emotional connection is when he brings over gifts when he comes home.  But fortunately Katy and her parents have been there for Artie.But one night as he goes out with his wife to a dinner party, she feels sick to her stomach and collapses.  She has cancer and it has spread throughout her body and she doesn't have much time left.  Joe tries to prepare Artie for his mom's inevitable death but both are not prepared of how life would be afterward without their mom.Without his mother, Joe now wants to connect with his son and be there and takes time off from his work.  Joe sees life differently now as he is forced to be a father for his son but most importantly, asking his son Harry (played by George McKay, ""Defiance"", ""Peter Pan"") from his first marriage to come stay with him in Australia.But Joe realizes that he never really had any connection with his sons.  When Harry was six, he left him to be with another woman who was pregnant with Artie.  And thus, this is the first real time in their lives Joe and his son Harry are together and a similar situation with Artie who was always dependent on his mother.  Now the three must live as a family but will Joe be the father that they need?VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Boys are Back"" features beautiful cinematography from Southern Australia.  Director Scott Hicks knew of what scenes he wanted in the film and Greg Fraser does a great job in showcasing the ocean, the blue skies, the yellow and green landscapes.  The scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  Shots of Joe and his wife Katy was well-filmed as with Joe and his sons.  Key scenes showing the family bond and him trying to be there for his loved ones.  The film is presented in Widescreen (2:35:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions.As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with a Spanish language track included.  The film is primarily dialogue driven with the occasional music.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and is primarily front and center channel driven.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Boys are Back"" comes with the following special features:* The Boys are Back: A Photographic Journey - (16:22) The following featurette showcases photography taken on the set of the film and behind-the-scenes.  Optional commentary by director Scott Hicks is included as Hicks talks about working with the various talent and crew and filming in Southern Australia.* A Father and Two Sons, On Set - (1:42) Author Simon Carr talks about the day his sons met the talent playing them and how the real life sons and the movie sons got a long quite well with each other.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Boys Are Back"" is a film inspired by a true story and where films about life after a deceased parent is nothing new, what makes this film so special is the connection between father and two sons that he has never been close with because of his commitment of being one of the best sports writers out there.  Always traveling to major sports competitions, he has always trusted his son with his wife.But it's when the character of Joe is forced to take on the role of father, you can feel that wall between him and his son.  He knows that he hasn't been much of a father but he's trying.  But when his son Harry from a previous marriage comes to stay with them, this is when we see Joe start to learn about himself.  Things he was not conscious about.  He's only thought about his young son Artie with his current wife, its when he sees his son Harry, a son that he has not really been too close with, you realize that Harry has missed out on having a father and now Harry is learning first hand that even though he had this new family in Australia, he has always made decisions that would benefit himself and never realizing how his children were feeling.It's a real-eye opening story that you don't really see too often in a film.  As mentioned, Clive Owens does a great job with his performance as Joe but credit also goes to the children played by George McKay and Nicholas McNaulty.  Also, the characters of Barbara played by Julia Blake.  Blake plays a good grandmother but having lost her daughter to cancer, she wants to make sure that her only living connection with her daughter, which is her grandson, is taken care of.  And Julia has a hard time trusting Joe who has made some bad decisions.Another actress that deserves credit is model Emma Booth who plays the character Laura.  A woman who takes care of Artie when Joe is gone and a single parent who has chemistry with Joe but doesn't know where there relationship/friendship is going.  Is she just his babysitter or does Joe really care about her?As for the film being rated PG-13, there are some scenes with profanity and some situations that you just don't want your young children to recreate in real life, such as riding on the hood of a vehicle to jumping into a bath.  But there is no violence, no scary situations for children but some sexual language and certain elements that parents may not want their children to see.The fact is that this is a dysfunctional family.  A child losing his mother and having to deal with the person closes to him not there anymore, is hard for a young child.  And the same with the character of Harry.  A boy that loves his father but they have not been together since he left him and his mother.  So, there is resentment.  And for Joe, its just being put in the role of a single parent while having this major career which is now being affected.  All three individuals are facing challenges that they have never faced before.  But together as a family, they try to make things good and that is what the heart of the film is about.Overall, ""The Boys are Back"" is a delightful, heartwarming film worth watching.  Definitely recommended!",4,"A delightful, heartwarming film.

Guy gets call from another son in England, and then somehow remembers he split on older son's mom long ago.  But never mind: a little Chaos Therapy will bring them all together.  Women hover around the edges, warning of the (inevitable) disasters to come.That's it for the plot.  But Clive Owen's Aussie dad is charmingly arrogant and later, charmingly chastened.  The real gem performances are the boys, and in particular the older son Harry, played by a very gifted young man named George MacKay.  MacKay's Harry is quiet and decent--just this side of vulnerable, and trying desperately to hold it all together.  As he slowly begins to trust Dad's goofball rules, he lightens up and relaxes, only to be hauled up short by Dad's not quite liking the new rule after all. Every kid in the universe can relate to THAT!It's the little epiphany Owen has in England--that nothing whatever can undo the past except simply soldiering on--that makes this film a little more than sweet fluff.

Though the story of a happily married sports writer to a beautiful young second wife Katy (Laura Fraser), enjoying their one child Artie (Nicholas McAnulty), who abruptly becomes a single parent when Katy dies from metastatic carcinoma, placing him in the uncomfortable position of becoming a single parent, is not unique among the tearful novels that have also made their way to the screen, this film survives on the quality of the cast.  Not only does Joe have to overcome the treacherous terrain of tending to housekeeping along with the tenuous gap that occurs when a parent dies and the remaining parent must tend to the grief of the remaining child, but he also must cope with the young Harry (George McKay), his son by his first marriage in England (his second family is in Australia) who feels deserted and asks to come to live with Joe and his half brother Artie. The film lingers over the madness of a household of males, tinkers with tricky problems with inlaws and his exwife, but in the end the message is that with 'growth' on the parts of each of the three males in the tale, happiness is possible.The film's intent is admirable and the cast of characters selected to portray these people - Owens shows real potential as a serious dramatic actor, George McKay is particularly excellent as the elder son - is very well selected.  The film is long, and could be easily edited without altering the impact of the story.  Director Scott Hicks allows the film to become predictable and overly saccharine: less could definitely have been more.  But it is a good evening's entertainment.

It's an absolutely lovely film absolutely worth seeing.Joe Warr (Clive Owen) suddenly finds himself a single father when his young wife Katy (Laura Fraser) precipitously dies of intestinal cancer. Joe, the lead and oft-on-the-road sportswriter for Melbourne's major newspaper, must now connect with his six-year old son Artie (Nicholas McAnulty). Coming to visit from England is his 14-year old son from a previous marriage, Harry (George MacKay), whom Joe pretty much abandoned to his first wife years before on their divorce.THE BOYS ARE BACK is about male bonding - father with motherless son, father with fatherless son, brother with half-brother. In this clubhouse, the women, whether it be Joe's mother-in-law Barbara (Julia Blake) or potential new significant-other Laura (Emma Booth), are almost intruders.Filmed mostly on Australia's striking south coast and with a soundtrack featuring haunting songs by Iceland's Sigur R&oacute;s, this film contains what is perhaps Clive Owen's finest and most nuanced performance to date. I wouldn't be surprised if Owen is nominated for an Oscar for this role, which is the best by a male actor I've seen in 2009.Too often, I think, the societal presumption is that children of marriages broken by death or divorce are better off with mothers, that fathers are somehow less loving and less skilled at parenting. At least in this must-see film, that is emphatically not the case.I left the screening keen on THE BOYS ARE BACK more than I can adequately express.P.S. 1/21/2010  Now that 2009 is finished, I must say that Owen's performance, while not THE best of 2009, is one of three best, joining Morgan Freeman of INVICTUS and Jeff Bridges of CRAZY HEART.

1290874,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B002UYXGWS,Sheryl Fechter,"[5, 5]","From the memoir written by Simon Carr and directed by Scott Hicks, this gorgeously filmed (Greig Fraser) movie begins with Joe Warr (Clive Owen) as a happily married husband and loving father to their young son, Artie (Nicholas McAnulty).  The family resides in a colorfully shown Australia while he works as an important sports writer.  Warr and his wife, Katie (Laura Fraser), are out during one evening and she suddenly drops to the floor without warning.  She is terminally ill.  A brokenhearted Warr tenderly takes care of Katie along with his son.  Clive Owen provides a personally poignant and stirring portrayal of a convincingly take-action husband and father which appears almost effortless.Their son Artie is a totally free-spirited little boy.  He remains aloof to the situation with his mother as she passes away quickly and Warr is left to care for his son, job, home, and to manage everything that he never did before.  His mother-in-law, ""Nana"", is in their home on and off trying to guide Joe in the ways of raising his precocious little boy, who states while in his class at school that ""cat food looks better than it tastes"". Warr sees things differently while learning to understand all that is involved in the grieving process of his son; anger, outbursts, laughter, indifference, and the closeness that Artie needs.We quickly understand that Joe was married before and has another son, Harry (George MacKay).  He has been at a highbrow prep school and comes to visit his father, who he barely knows, and meet his little brother for the first time.  The two boys are vastly different coming from two different worlds.  Harry first appears disenfranchised with being a part of this new-found threesome until his father is able to smooth over the familial culture shock. He slowly begins enjoying the freedom of finally belonging to his father and Artie in a place that does not carry the staunch rules of decorum. It is lovely to see Harry be the child he really is and slowly grow to love his father and his younger brother.  He wants to move there and live with them and Warr agrees.  He fiercely loves his two boys in the course of the relationships slowly developing between the three of them.Everything with this movie is not sunshine, actually quite the opposite.  Warr is forced, by the household situation, to quickly learn how to adapt to being an all around father.  He educates himself about caring for Harry while smoothing over years of absence from his life and for Artie as he best sees fit then begins to enjoy his two sons in a whole new light.  The movie studies the relationship of parent and child from the father's point of view.

It doesn't gloss over the great feeling of loss from the death of a spouse or parent.  It really moves you through it with the players.  They do not come out magically whole and intact.  I found myself saying, &#34;Yes, that is exactly what you experience. There is no magic pill for healing the hole in your heart.&#34;  They do go through the processes of grieving.  They do scab-over enough to come back to be among their friends and family.

Mainly it was about how different people deal with the loss of a family member. And this didn't mean the death of one for all the characters. Clive Owen gave a brilliant performance as (Joe Warr)a grieving and now single father or a precocious little boy. He did drink heavily at first, but once he realized he had to deal with being a father he decided to become more mature. You couldn't ask for more from the six-year-old Nicholas McAnulty that played Artie. He was funny and cute and ill-tempered in just the right ways. He was the embodiment of how children do not know how to deal with the death of someone close. As for his older son from his first marriage. His name was Harry, he was played masterfully by George MacKay. This character was supposed to be moody and burned by his father's leaving him with his mother, who was now moved on with her life and had very little room for Harry in it. This is why he was so angry with his father. George portrayed all of this emotion quite brilliantly. He was the right person for this role. And has a promising future as an actor. He was angry and teen-age ""I'm mad at my father"" moody, and mature, and pleasant to his half brother... all in just the right ways. The only thing I hold against this movie, is that Joe was seemingly interested in another woman and it was never pursued. Although it would have been hard on Artie if his dad had moved on that quickly.",5,Great,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1530,"['was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'story', 'acting', 'even', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'piece', 'Mainly', 'was', 'how', 'different', 'people', 'deal', 'loss', 'family', 'member', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'death', 'one', 'characters', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'gave', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Joe', 'Warr', 'grieving', 'now', 'single', 'father', 'precocious', 'little', 'boy', 'did', 'drink', 'heavily', 'first', 'once', 'realized', 'had', 'deal', 'being', 'father', 'decided', 'become', 'more', 'mature', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'six-year-old', 'Nicholas', 'McAnulty', 'played', 'Artie', 'was', 'funny', 'cute', 'ill-tempered', 'just', 'right', 'ways', 'was', 'embodiment', 'how', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'death', 'someone', 'close', 'older', 'son', 'first', 'marriage', 'name', 'was', 'Harry', 'was', 'played', 'masterfully', 'George', 'MacKay', 'character', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'moody', 'burned', 'father', 'leaving', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'now', 'moved', 'life', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'Harry', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'angry', 'father', 'George', 'portrayed', 'emotion', 'quite', 'brilliantly', 'was', 'right', 'person', 'role', 'promising', 'future', 'actor', 'was', 'angry', 'teen-age', ""'m"", 'mad', 'father', 'moody', 'mature', 'pleasant', 'half', 'brother', 'just', 'right', 'ways', 'only', 'thing', 'hold', 'movie', 'Joe', 'was', 'seemingly', 'interested', 'woman', 'was', 'never', 'pursued', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'Artie', 'dad', 'had', 'moved', 'quickly']",N/A
