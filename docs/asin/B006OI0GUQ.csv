The fact that so much is crammed into so relatively little time, as he goes from hit to hit, miss to miss, abject failure and madness makes no difference as do any inventions or stretches of the truth. The film whips along at breakneck speed and Con O'Neill's portrayal of this tortured soul is nothing short of brilliant.Fascinating glimpses of the era pepper the production and the whole thing just radiates.As faultless as it can get. The tune, Telstar, is STILL bloody good.Check it out.

1518237,A356RFKNIG043B,B006OI0GUQ,K. Swanson,"[5, 6]","3.8 starsThis started out so well that I thought I might be in for one of the best movies I'd ever seen. The exceptionally crisp opening scene stuffs about five minutes of exposition into one, then a truly exemplary credit sequence not only provides endless split-screen eye candy but also clues us into the basics of where we are and how we got there. Genius, one of the best opening few minutes of any film I can think of.Buuut, then things begin to slow down and never really pick up. Con O'Neill is very good indeed, as are almost all of the actors, but the script is about 30 minutes too long. The story drags on and as Joe's life unravels so does this film. By the end I was just glad it was over.Spacey's opening scenes are wonderful and you'd hardly recognize him. But then his Brit accent seems to fade as the film goes on and his role loses its lustre. It was funny to see portrayals of the young Ritchie Blackmore and Mitch Mitchell (his gun scene is a highlight), but the Blackmore guy was just lame at faking guitar playing. RB was and is a true guitar great, even on his early Joe Meek cuts, and this guy is clueless. Bad casting.There are some fine moments scattered throughout, however, and Con carries this one all the way. Meek's gayness is dealt with pretty well, and his obsession with Heinz comes across with real edge. But the film shines most in its light moments, and as it wears on Meek's life has precious few of them, so don't expect fun and games after the first hour.Worth seeing if you recall the great Telstar fondly (it is a classic tune, no doubt), or are interested in the London music scene back then, or just find bios of odd genius types interesting.But if you really love great film making and ever get a chance, do watchthat opening few minutes.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 10]","I'm old enough to remember when the pop hit ""Telstar"" was first released in the US and the impact it had. I knew that Producer Joe Meek was responsible for it and that - like Phil Spector - he was an ""eccentric"". So I was looking forward to this DVD of the 2008 film made in England. As I looked at the opening credits I didn't recognize any of the actors' name except Kevin Spacey and when he appeared on the screen I hardly recognized him.As the 119-minute film began I watched as Spacey - as a plastics company owner who was funding Meek on his first record - and Meek (Con O'Neill) started running around the make-shift studio on the second floor, above a handbag store, and yelling. For at least the next 20 minutes the film had this high energy and lots of yelling (and MANY expletives - not that that's wrong but making you aware of them). The film jumps back and forth between Meek's first production and his death - 6 years later. This can be confusing and the Director puts in a lot of symbolism too.Meek was certainly a strange guy - not unlike Spector in many ways - and had internaldemons to deal with. He was gay - in a period when this was not openly acceptable - and used his ""love"" for the mono-syllable-named Heinz - to promote the career of this guy who - though early in his career was ""backed"" by the Rolling Stones! - couldn't really sing. And we have ""drop in"" lines such as when Meek is offered to work with both the Beatles - before they hit it big - and ""some Welsh guy named Tom"", who he also turns down to concentrate on his artist/lover Heinz.The film continued and kept repeating itself - at least for me - and, though we learn some things about Meek's two ""hits"" (the other was ""Have I The Right?"" under the group name Honeycone) , the film seems to go on forever. The director used the actual recordings for the soundtrack but the lip-synching seemed fake. The film is graphic as well with implied sex and gore at the end (sorry if you think this is a ""spoiler"" but you need to know where it's heading before looking forward to the standard ""pop music bio"".After I finished watching it, I knew a bit more about Meek than before but felt that the two hours could have been better served.There are no extras here except the film's trailer.Other reviewers - especially Meek fans - will probably disagree with me but I can't really recommend this DVD to anyone other than a die-hard fan of the early British rock scene.I hope you found this review both informative and useful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,"Quirky, eccentric and violent biopic (just like its subject) of this ""footnote"" in 60s pop/rock history",1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,2537,"[""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'pop', 'hit', 'Telstar', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'US', 'impact', 'had', 'knew', 'Producer', 'Joe', 'Meek', 'was', 'responsible', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'was', 'eccentric', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', '2008', 'film', 'made', 'England', 'looked', 'opening', 'credits', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'actors', 'name', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'when', 'appeared', 'screen', 'hardly', 'recognized', 'him.As', '119-minute', 'film', 'began', 'watched', 'Spacey', 'plastics', 'company', 'owner', 'who', 'was', 'funding', 'Meek', 'first', 'record', 'Meek', 'Con', ""O'Neill"", 'started', 'running', 'around', 'make-shift', 'studio', 'second', 'floor', 'handbag', 'store', 'yelling', 'least', 'next', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'had', 'high', 'energy', 'lots', 'yelling', 'MANY', 'expletives', 'not', 'wrong', 'making', 'aware', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'Meek', 'first', 'production', 'death', '6', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'Director', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'too.Meek', 'was', 'certainly', 'strange', 'guy', 'not', 'Spector', 'many', 'ways', 'had', 'internaldemons', 'deal', 'was', 'gay', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'openly', 'acceptable', 'used', 'love', 'mono-syllable-named', 'Heinz', 'promote', 'career', 'guy', 'who', 'early', 'career', 'was', 'backed', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'sing', 'have', 'drop', 'lines', 'such', 'when', 'Meek', 'offered', 'work', 'Beatles', 'hit', 'big', 'Welsh', 'guy', 'named', 'Tom', 'who', 'also', 'down', 'concentrate', 'artist/lover', 'Heinz.The', 'film', 'continued', 'kept', 'repeating', 'least', 'learn', 'things', 'Meek', 'two', 'hits', 'other', 'was', 'Have', 'Right', 'group', 'name', 'Honeycone', 'film', 'go', 'forever', 'director', 'used', 'actual', 'recordings', 'soundtrack', 'lip-synching', 'seemed', 'fake', 'film', 'graphic', 'as', 'well', 'implied', 'sex', 'gore', 'end', 'sorry', 'think', 'spoiler', 'need', 'know', 'where', 'heading', 'looking', 'forward', 'standard', 'pop', 'music', 'bio', '.After', 'finished', 'watching', 'knew', 'bit', 'more', 'Meek', 'before', 'felt', 'two', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'extras', 'here', 'film', 'trailer.Other', 'reviewers', 'especially', 'Meek', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'other', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'early', 'British', 'rock', 'scene.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'useful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Telstar
