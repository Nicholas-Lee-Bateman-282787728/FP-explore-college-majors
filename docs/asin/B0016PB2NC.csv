This film is obviously not from a major studio and was filmed on a tight budget, but it held my attention.The basic premis is that a Mormon missionary returns home after completing his two years of service and, while taking a taxi from the airport, is in a major auto accident.  He believes that he was sent back to Earth (life) and given 60 days to try to help his mother.  He soon discovers that his mother, who is not Mormon, is working in a bar, that his best friend shaved his head, has multiple piercings, and has a large tatoo, and his girlfriend/fiance is pushing forward with plans for their wedding.  Of course, the returned missionary cannot commit to the wedding since he thinks that he will be dead in 60 days, so things get complicated.The main storyline, for me, is that the missionary is just too judgemental of others.  He assumes too much, and doesn't take make the effort or take the time to try to see other people's points of view.  He finally comes around with the help of his friend.The acting was passable, the storyline was interesting, the filming was just OK, and the message was good.  That combination, for me, equals about 3 stars.",3,"A passable effort, but has a good moral (Warning, contains spoilers)",1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,1309,"['just', 'watched', 'RETURN', 'WITH', 'HONOR', 'other', 'night', 'found', 'story', 'line', 'be', 'engaging', 'film', 'filmcraft', 'were', 'somewhat', 'amateurish', 'film', 'obviously', 'not', 'major', 'studio', 'was', 'filmed', 'tight', 'budget', 'held', 'attention.The', 'basic', 'premis', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'returns', 'home', 'completing', 'two', 'years', 'service', 'taking', 'taxi', 'airport', 'major', 'auto', 'accident', 'was', 'sent', 'back', 'Earth', 'life', 'given', '60', 'days', 'try', 'help', 'mother', 'soon', 'mother', 'who', 'not', 'Mormon', 'working', 'bar', 'best', 'friend', 'shaved', 'head', 'multiple', 'piercings', 'large', 'tatoo', 'girlfriend/fiance', 'pushing', 'forward', 'plans', 'wedding', 'course', 'returned', 'missionary', 'can', 'not', 'commit', 'wedding', 'will', 'be', 'dead', '60', 'days', 'so', 'things', 'get', 'complicated.The', 'main', 'storyline', 'missionary', 'just', 'too', 'judgemental', 'others', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'take', 'make', 'effort', 'take', 'time', 'try', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'points', 'view', 'finally', 'around', 'help', 'friend.The', 'acting', 'was', 'passable', 'storyline', 'was', 'interesting', 'filming', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'message', 'was', 'good', 'combination', 'equals', '3', 'stars']",N/A
1154709,A90HPVBN7LU1F,B0016PB2NC,Book Hound,"[0, 1]","I was very disappointed in this movie, not only because the premise of the movie turned out to be different that what was actually promoted, i.e. that the returning missionary had 60 days to finish up his life's work, but the main focus of the movie dealing with the returned missionary trying to convert his mother to the LDS Church was theologically inconsistent with basic LDS doctrine.The movie has the main character pursing his sinful mother to join the LDS Church and when his mother is finally baptized into the LDS Church, she dies the very next day and the premise is that she is saved by grace alone and will be in heaven with Christ just after her death.This is all very good theology based on Orthodox Christianity for non-member viewers, but it is important for LDS Church viewers to know that LDS doctrine does not promote this concept of grace and instead just has the person going to the spirit world right after death and working on their own salvation to eventually enter a higher level of heaven to live with God and Christ.  Ask any missionary and they will tell you this fact. Otherwise, a slight step up from the LDS movie Baptists at our Barbecue, but still a very poor choice for any decent entertainment value.",1,A Total Waste of Viewing Time.,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,1236,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'premise', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'promoted', 'i.e', 'returning', 'missionary', 'had', '60', 'days', 'finish', 'up', 'life', 'work', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'dealing', 'returned', 'missionary', 'trying', 'convert', 'mother', 'LDS', 'Church', 'was', 'theologically', 'inconsistent', 'basic', 'LDS', 'doctrine.The', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'pursing', 'sinful', 'mother', 'join', 'LDS', 'Church', 'when', 'mother', 'finally', 'baptized', 'LDS', 'Church', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'premise', 'saved', 'grace', 'alone', 'will', 'be', 'heaven', 'Christ', 'just', 'death.This', 'very', 'good', 'theology', 'based', 'Orthodox', 'Christianity', 'non-member', 'viewers', 'important', 'LDS', 'Church', 'viewers', 'know', 'LDS', 'doctrine', 'not', 'promote', 'concept', 'grace', 'instead', 'just', 'person', 'going', 'spirit', 'world', 'right', 'death', 'working', 'own', 'salvation', 'eventually', 'enter', 'higher', 'level', 'heaven', 'live', 'God', 'Christ', 'Ask', 'missionary', 'will', 'tell', 'fact', 'Otherwise', 'slight', 'step', 'up', 'LDS', 'movie', 'Baptists', 'Barbecue', 'still', 'very', 'poor', 'choice', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'value']",N/A
