There's only two good films in this set.I'd argue there's only two bad films in the set. Although they have charismatic leads, Daredevil and Elektra just don't work. X-men 3: The Last Stand is certainly the weakest of the 3, but it has some great action set pieces and some pretty shocking twists. Finally, the Fantastic Four films. Everyone seems to hate them, but if you approach them as geared towards a younger audience, I think you might see they're pretty harmless fun. Yes, Galactus is a big space cloud rather than a purple-skirted giant planet eater, but would the latter have worked either?Great price if you don't have these films.",4,A great deal if you don't already have these films,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,724,"['know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Daredevil', 'Elektra', 'Fantastic', 'Four', '1', '2', 'X-men', '3', 'only', 'two', 'good', 'films', 'set.I', ""'d"", 'argue', 'only', 'two', 'bad', 'films', 'set', 'have', 'charismatic', 'leads', 'Daredevil', 'Elektra', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'X-men', '3', 'Last', 'Stand', 'certainly', 'weakest', '3', 'great', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'pretty', 'shocking', 'twists', 'Finally', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'films', 'Everyone', 'hate', 'approach', 'geared', 'younger', 'audience', 'think', 'might', 'see', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'harmless', 'fun', 'Yes', 'Galactus', 'big', 'space', 'cloud', 'rather', 'purple-skirted', 'giant', 'planet', 'eater', 'would', 'latter', 'have', 'worked', 'Great', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'films']",Marvel Heroes Collection: (Daredevil/Elektra/X-Men/ X2/X-Men 3: The Last Stand/ Fantastic Four & Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer)

He loved opening this up and seeing all the super hero movies, the only thing that we did not like is that there was a dvd in there with just comics on it that you couldn't even read. We thought it was a dvd of another cartoon, so it was kind of dissapointing. Other than that! The movies are great, and my son almost has the whole Marvel collection, so that helped out alot!",4,It was a good gift,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,412,"['got', 'son', 'Christmas', 'loved', 'opening', 'up', 'seeing', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'was', 'dvd', 'just', 'comics', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'thought', 'was', 'dvd', 'cartoon', 'was', 'kind', 'dissapointing', 'Other', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'son', 'almost', 'whole', 'Marvel', 'collection', 'helped', 'out', 'alot']",Marvel Heroes Collection: (Daredevil/Elektra/X-Men/ X2/X-Men 3: The Last Stand/ Fantastic Four & Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer)

I think we've all seen them, but if not, I'd say that you must see the X-Men movies, that I really liked the Fantastic Four movies, but not all of my friends did, and that Daredevil and Elektra were ok, but why did Elektra get brought back to life just so that she could never see Daredevil again? I guess I should have read the comic books.I had a ball with the language options and special features. If I were a collector, I would have been transported by all of the goodies that came with it, but then, if I were a collector, I would have bought an extra set to leave in the wrapping and never to touch.I'm not much for the goodies, though, and I would have traded a smaller bookshelf footprint for the little comic books.
