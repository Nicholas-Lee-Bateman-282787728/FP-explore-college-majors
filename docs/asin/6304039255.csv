And the rich history of fighting for democracy in war while battling racism is brought to life in this outstanding DVD based on the triumphs & travails of the airmen.An all-star cast - including Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr., Malcolm Jamal Warner, Vivica A. Fox and John Lithgow - follows the airmen through their training to the skies over Africa and Italy, with the focus on the lives of each major character.The DVD does an excellent job in juxtaposing the patriotism of the flyers with the Jim Crow laws on the homefront and in the military. In one powerful scene, German POW's are given better accomodations on a train transport than the airmen.The flyers proved to be one of the most efficient and valuable squadrons in the war. The squadron actually had a low casualty rate while suffering no losses of bombers being escorted. The squadron also tallied a high kill rate of enemy aircraft when engaged in combat.Not only heroes in war, the squadron was an important factor in setting the stage several years later for the military to be desegregated by law by President Harry Truman.As with most movies with a historical theme, there are liberties taken to push the story along. But The Tuskegee Airmen is a great story and sets a solid foundation for anyone interested in further pursuing research in yet another lost gem of American history.",5,Democracy Begins At Home,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,1657,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'experimental', 'program', 'was', 'attempted', 'Tuskegee', 'Alabama', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'greater', 'implications', 'years', 'come.Call', 'Manhattan', 'Project', 'minds', 'military', 'political', 'leaders', 'was', 'train', 'use', 'black', 'air', 'squadron', 'war', 'rich', 'history', 'fighting', 'democracy', 'war', 'battling', 'racism', 'brought', 'life', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'based', 'triumphs', 'travails', 'airmen.An', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Malcolm', 'Jamal', 'Warner', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'airmen', 'training', 'skies', 'Africa', 'Italy', 'focus', 'lives', 'major', 'character.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'job', 'juxtaposing', 'patriotism', 'flyers', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'laws', 'homefront', 'military', 'one', 'powerful', 'scene', 'German', 'POW', 'are', 'given', 'better', 'accomodations', 'train', 'transport', 'airmen.The', 'flyers', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'efficient', 'valuable', 'squadrons', 'war', 'squadron', 'actually', 'had', 'low', 'casualty', 'rate', 'suffering', 'losses', 'bombers', 'being', 'escorted', 'squadron', 'also', 'tallied', 'high', 'kill', 'rate', 'enemy', 'aircraft', 'when', 'engaged', 'combat.Not', 'only', 'war', 'squadron', 'was', 'important', 'factor', 'setting', 'stage', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'military', 'be', 'desegregated', 'law', 'President', 'Harry', 'Truman.As', 'most', 'movies', 'historical', 'theme', 'are', 'liberties', 'taken', 'push', 'story', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'great', 'story', 'solid', 'foundation', 'anyone', 'interested', 'further', 'pursuing', 'research', 'yet', 'lost', 'gem', 'American', 'history']",Tuskegee Airmen VHS

(for a film of this historical event check out Laurence Fishburne's ""The Tuskegee Airmen""This documentary is a legacy to the men who fought two wars in WWII, the enemy abroad and racism at home.  This documentary (along with others) is an important part to complementing the standard history books on American WWII era.The Army had allowed the negros to try out for this flight program, only to see if the negro man was capable, mentally and physically, to make it thru pilot training.  These were the elite of the African American community of those days, college educated negros.  Negro is the term used during that era, and used in this review, only for historical purposes.Starts off with the remaining living veterans aboard a bus going back to Tuskegee, Alabama - a veterans reunion.  With scenes overlapping with recreated footage, one learns from the veterans what it was like to be a negro in pre-WWII America (""the white press did not publish anything favorable of the negros.  The negros got their news and understood white America thru the black press"").  The Intro. also mentions Bessy Coleman, as the first woman black pilot.The vision the young educated negro cadets, to change their society thru their joined efforts to fight for their country and prove to white America that the negro man can fly and do a great job at that, is quite contagious.  I could not, as a white Protestant, but just root for them and be glad that they proved their 1940 society, wrong.SCENE SELECTIONS:* Introduction* Coming Home* The Battle for the Right to Fight* Welcome to Tuskegee* Learning to Fly* Winning their Wings* Trial by Fire* Victory for the Red Tails* A Disappointing Homecoming* An Everlasting Legacy* CreditsIt is so weird and ironic to learn, that today Tuskegee is a known town in Alabama, primarily because of the Tuskegee Airmen and the black Institute campus.If you want to learn the real story, accurately, watch the PBS DVD (it is really well made).  If you just want to watch a great film about a great story and with a plot that conveys the segregation and racism of the times (but without all the details being historically accurate), then watch the film by Laurence Fishburne.  The PBS edition, also talks about what happened to the airmen after WWII, and one of the things mentioned is Truman's the bill for desegregation of the army.The Tuskegee pilots of the 232 became known as the best in the business.

From the time they took the written test to strapping into their trainer aircraft, their white instructors, especially those from the South, were just itching to bounce them out of pilot training. Their flying had to be exceptional and it was.The 332nd Fighter Group made it to Italy and began flying reconnaissance missions and endless patrols with no hope of engaging the enemy. That was the next battle, fighting the reports that belied their meager combat missions. Their commander would go Washington to make their case that they hadn't been used for combat, that they were anxious to engage the enemy and that they were not innate cowards.Under the watchful eye of Southern politicians eager to see them fail and have their unit disband, they began to escort bombers to their targets, and they lost the fewest bombers to enemy fighter attack. As a subplot, we see two bomber pilots arguing about the group that came to their rescue. The Californian pilot believes the group are Negroes, and the Southern pilot, exasperated, tries to explain to him that they can't be because don't have the courage or will to fight. That changes when badly hit by an enemy aircraft, a Negro pilot begins singing the squadron's fight song over the radio. The bomber pilots listen as the pilot crashes into the ground. The bomber pilot from the south eventually asks the 332nd to escort his planes on their bomb runs. He is compelled to dispel a life-long belief.Thank heaven no one challenges black acting talent, and this movie is full of the same, proving that a TV movie can be just as entertaining as the ones found in theaters. Lawrence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Andre Braugher lead the cast of characters, with John Lithgow and Christopher McDonald playing a southern U.S. Senator and white officer respectively, characters you learn to love to hate.The story and script explore the tension between black cadets and white officers, the conflict of wanting to fight for a country and cause that doesn't respect them or want them, and continuing to do it anyway. They not only fought the Germans, but their own services. This story only scratches the surface of their daily stress, the fear of dying and the fear of failing, or being perceived as failures. It makes their story personal. There were no TV cameras to extoll their challenges and success. There was Eleanor Roosevelt who visited the training and insisted on being taken for a flight--by a black cadet, but that was about all the support they would receive, and the equanimity of some officers who believed they deserved a chance just as anyone else.The Red-Tail Devils, as they were called, did a service to our country while their country did a disservice to them.",4,A Story of Service,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2766,"['guys', 'were', 'good', 'had', 'be', 'time', 'took', 'written', 'test', 'strapping', 'trainer', 'aircraft', 'white', 'instructors', 'especially', 'South', 'were', 'just', 'itching', 'bounce', 'pilot', 'training', 'flying', 'had', 'be', 'exceptional', 'was.The', '332nd', 'Fighter', 'Group', 'made', 'Italy', 'began', 'flying', 'reconnaissance', 'missions', 'endless', 'patrols', 'hope', 'engaging', 'enemy', 'was', 'next', 'battle', 'fighting', 'reports', 'belied', 'meager', 'combat', 'missions', 'commander', 'would', 'go', 'Washington', 'make', 'case', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'used', 'combat', 'were', 'anxious', 'engage', 'enemy', 'were', 'not', 'innate', 'cowards.Under', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Southern', 'politicians', 'eager', 'see', 'fail', 'have', 'unit', 'disband', 'began', 'escort', 'bombers', 'targets', 'lost', 'fewest', 'bombers', 'enemy', 'fighter', 'attack', 'subplot', 'see', 'two', 'bomber', 'pilots', 'arguing', 'group', 'came', 'rescue', 'Californian', 'pilot', 'group', 'are', 'Negroes', 'Southern', 'pilot', 'exasperated', 'tries', 'explain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'because', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'courage', 'will', 'fight', 'when', 'badly', 'hit', 'enemy', 'aircraft', 'Negro', 'pilot', 'singing', 'squadron', 'fight', 'song', 'radio', 'bomber', 'pilots', 'listen', 'pilot', 'crashes', 'ground', 'bomber', 'pilot', 'south', 'eventually', '332nd', 'escort', 'planes', 'bomb', 'runs', 'compelled', 'dispel', 'life-long', 'belief.Thank', 'one', 'black', 'acting', 'talent', 'movie', 'full', 'same', 'proving', 'TV', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'ones', 'found', 'theaters', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'lead', 'cast', 'characters', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'playing', 'southern', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'white', 'officer', 'respectively', 'characters', 'learn', 'love', 'hate.The', 'story', 'script', 'explore', 'tension', 'black', 'cadets', 'white', 'officers', 'conflict', 'wanting', 'fight', 'country', 'cause', ""n't"", 'respect', 'want', 'continuing', 'do', 'anyway', 'not', 'only', 'fought', 'Germans', 'own', 'services', 'story', 'only', 'surface', 'daily', 'stress', 'fear', 'dying', 'fear', 'failing', 'being', 'perceived', 'failures', 'story', 'personal', 'were', 'TV', 'cameras', 'extoll', 'challenges', 'success', 'was', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'who', 'visited', 'training', 'insisted', 'being', 'taken', 'flight', 'black', 'cadet', 'was', 'support', 'would', 'receive', 'equanimity', 'officers', 'who', 'believed', 'deserved', 'chance', 'just', 'anyone', 'Red-Tail', 'Devils', 'were', 'called', 'did', 'service', 'country', 'country', 'did', 'disservice']",Tuskegee Airmen VHS

I can never see the ending without tears of appreciation, joy and intense pride. HBO is by far the best at making original movies and shows. The film has technical flaws... every film does... but beyond them it tells a story that, by design or negligence, has been ignored by American history for almost a half century.Laurence Fishburne and Andre Braugher deliver stellar performances as Hannibal Lee and the great military leader Benjamin O. Davis. The other great actors who have some sort of direct or distant connection to the cause, to contribute were Cuba Gooding Jr., Courtney B. Vance, Allen Payne, Malcolm Jamal Warner, and Andre Braugher.This film was wrapped up for me when a red necked White bomber pilot says in the final briefing: ""I have a crew whose lives are my responsibility. If it's all the same to you Sir, I want the 332nd to take me to Berlin and back"". That cinematic statement is a long overdue.`Tuskegge Airmen' is a movie that should be viewed by all Americans interested in seeing a slice of Americana that's been neglected. Most will identify with the raw emotion evoked by the plight of these brave and talented men. Black Americans will be moved to tears as we are reminded of what those trailblazers overcame so that future Black soldiers, airmen and every day citizens could take their rightful place in American society, proud of their past and heritage.

Topics examined include the prewar state of affairs of black servicemen, their training in Tuskegee, Alabama, their air campaigns in North Africa and Europe and their less than triumphant return home after the war. At each step of the way, they had to fight individual and institutional racism and they did so in the best possible manner. They fought bigotry with sheer excellence. They remain the only fighter group never to have lost one of the bombers they were charged with protecting to enemy fire.Participating in this documentary are some of the original airmen and their poignant recolections and anecdotes bring a very human face to go with their legendary exploits. These people include both pilots and the aircrews who kept them in the air.

Because I have a thing for World War II movies (and for aviation movies), I really found this movie very enthralling.I don't like the back of the DVD box that says how it's ""1943, and the Germans are winning the war.""  In early '43, Von Paulus had surrendered in Stalingrad (which is generally seen as a huge turning point in the war).  By late 1942, the Germans had already been losing in Stalingrad.  But anyways...This movie's great.  I like how these men have to fight not only the Nazis, but racism in their own country as well.  The best part is when the First Lady decides to fly with one of the ""colored"" pilots (and you can see how angry the commanding officer is).The weakest part of this movie is the budget.  Whenever aerial combat occurs (or even ground attack from the air), the movie uses stock footage from World War II.  If I wanted to see footage that old, I'd watch a documentary (and yes, I do watch documentaries).  But the advantage of watching a movie is that you can RECREATE these re-enactments in a more flashy way.But all minor weaknesses aside, this movie's awesome.  And the cast is awesome too featuring Cuba Gooding Jr and Lawrence Fishburne.  It also has that guy from the Cosby Show.  Suffice it to say, the acting is great.It's a really touching movie because it shows the plight of these men as they risk their lives for a country that gives more rights to Nazi prisoners-of-war than to their own people (who happened to be non-White).It's nice to see that this country has come such a long way in just 60 years.",5,"low budget, but a great movie nevertheless",1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,1624,"['wo', ""n't"", 'knock', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'story', 'good', 'small', 'budget', 'have', 'thing', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'aviation', 'movies', 'really', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'enthralling.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'back', 'DVD', 'box', 'how', '1943', 'Germans', 'are', 'winning', 'war', 'early', ""'43"", 'Von', 'Paulus', 'had', 'surrendered', 'Stalingrad', 'generally', 'seen', 'huge', 'turning', 'point', 'war', 'late', '1942', 'Germans', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'losing', 'Stalingrad', 'movie', 'great', 'like', 'how', 'men', 'have', 'fight', 'not', 'only', 'Nazis', 'racism', 'own', 'country', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'First', 'Lady', 'fly', 'one', 'colored', 'pilots', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'angry', 'commanding', 'officer', '.The', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'budget', 'Whenever', 'aerial', 'combat', 'even', 'ground', 'attack', 'air', 'movie', 'stock', 'footage', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'wanted', 'see', 'footage', 'old', ""'d"", 'watch', 'documentary', 'yes', 'do', 'watch', 'documentaries', 'advantage', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'RECREATE', 're-enactments', 'more', 'flashy', 'minor', 'weaknesses', 'aside', 'movie', 'awesome', 'cast', 'awesome', 'too', 'featuring', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'also', 'guy', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Suffice', 'say', 'acting', 'great.It', 'really', 'touching', 'movie', 'plight', 'men', 'risk', 'lives', 'country', 'more', 'rights', 'Nazi', 'prisoners-of-war', 'own', 'people', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'non-White', '.It', 'nice', 'see', 'country', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'just', '60', 'years']",Tuskegee Airmen VHS

397344,A11TUHEHHENLBC,6304039255,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[1, 8]","The problem with a polemical movie like this is that there are at least two separate and distinct ways it can be judged. First of all it can be judged as an entertainment. Secondly it can be judged as a brief  for a political position.Let me address the second point first. The Tuskegee Airman issue is a favorite topic of the left. It is not presented as objective history but rather as an argument for what liberals think is a moral point. According to this view, the fact that at one point some whites said blacks couldn't fly modern fighters and that later they were shown to be adequate pilots proves - well just what does it prove other than some people were wrong in their judgments.None of the writings, or movies about the Tuskegee Airmen ever point out that the majority of white officers always believed that blacks had the capability to fly fighters. There was indeed a debate within the officer corps but those who believed that blacks were genetically and physiologically incapable of flight were the minority. So when the Tuskegee Airmen proved capable of flying P-51s some white officers were surprised but most weren't.Blacks and whites are good at different  activities. Blacks are obviously much better than whites at basketball and running. This wasn't always evident. Adolf Hitler for one was surprised by Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics but few American track coaches expected anything else. Owens was on our team because he was known to be blindingly fast. Hollywood still makes movies about the time when many whites thought blacks couldn't play basketball or baseball.The Tuskegee Airmen story is popular but it is also filled with lies and distortions. The real Tuskegee Airmen had the worst record of any air group escorting bombers over Germany in terms of their ability to shoot down Nazi fighters. All other comparable white units flying comparable planes were much more effective. There were no Tuskegee Airman who became 'Aces'.  That was unusual.There was a major study at the end of the war that dealt with the black fighter pilots very low kill rate. However the real reason they were so different from white pilots was not so much racial as it was political. They flew different missions than whites - ones with less risk to them and less risk to the bombers. They also flew at a time when the major air action was over. The Nazi planes and pilots had been decimated. Almost all of their missions over Germany were unopposed. They rarely saw a Nazi fighter in the air.The Tuskegee Airmen seem to have been single out for political cover. Like Prince Andrew it looks as if they were not exposed to the same risks as their colleagues because of political considerations.So as objective history this movie and the similar George Lucas film 'red Tails' could hardly be less accurate. Both films are blatant propaganda  pieces which defame the white pilots so as to advance the case for this small group of black pilots. On the other hand as a simple distracting entertainment this is a competent Hollywood effort. The photography is good. The acting is good. This made for TV movie has to rely on a lot of stock footage for the battle scenes. It was made before the CGI revolution so all the original flying sequences use real planes. This is good and bad. Real planes look like real planes in a way that the CGI heavy Lucas 'Red Tails' planes don't. But there are only so many real planes left. So it soon becomes clear that the producers had access to three and only three P-51s. For anyone who appreciates WWII war birds that's a plus but it does  restrict the kind of scenes that can be depicted.",1,Good Movie - Bad Subject,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3633,"['problem', 'polemical', 'movie', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'separate', 'distinct', 'ways', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'First', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'entertainment', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'brief', 'political', 'position.Let', 'second', 'point', 'first', 'Tuskegee', 'Airman', 'issue', 'favorite', 'topic', 'left', 'not', 'presented', 'objective', 'history', 'rather', 'argument', 'what', 'liberals', 'think', 'moral', 'point', 'According', 'view', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'whites', 'said', 'blacks', 'could', ""n't"", 'fly', 'modern', 'fighters', 'later', 'were', 'shown', 'be', 'adequate', 'pilots', 'well', 'just', 'what', 'prove', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'wrong', 'judgments.None', 'writings', 'movies', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'ever', 'point', 'out', 'majority', 'white', 'officers', 'always', 'believed', 'blacks', 'had', 'capability', 'fly', 'fighters', 'was', 'indeed', 'debate', 'officer', 'corps', 'who', 'believed', 'blacks', 'were', 'genetically', 'physiologically', 'incapable', 'flight', 'were', 'minority', 'So', 'when', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'proved', 'capable', 'flying', 'P-51s', 'white', 'officers', 'were', 'surprised', 'most', ""weren't.Blacks"", 'whites', 'are', 'good', 'different', 'activities', 'Blacks', 'are', 'obviously', 'much', 'better', 'whites', 'basketball', 'running', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'evident', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'one', 'was', 'surprised', 'Jesse', 'Owens', '1936', 'Olympics', 'few', 'American', 'track', 'coaches', 'expected', 'anything', 'else', 'Owens', 'was', 'team', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'blindingly', 'fast', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'movies', 'time', 'when', 'many', 'whites', 'thought', 'blacks', 'could', ""n't"", 'play', 'basketball', 'baseball.The', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'story', 'popular', 'also', 'filled', 'lies', 'distortions', 'real', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'had', 'worst', 'record', 'air', 'group', 'escorting', 'bombers', 'Germany', 'terms', 'ability', 'shoot', 'down', 'Nazi', 'fighters', 'other', 'comparable', 'white', 'units', 'flying', 'comparable', 'planes', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'were', 'Tuskegee', 'Airman', 'who', 'became', ""'Aces"", 'was', 'unusual.There', 'was', 'major', 'study', 'end', 'war', 'dealt', 'black', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'very', 'low', 'kill', 'rate', 'However', 'real', 'reason', 'were', 'so', 'different', 'white', 'pilots', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'racial', 'was', 'political', 'flew', 'different', 'missions', 'whites', 'ones', 'less', 'risk', 'less', 'risk', 'bombers', 'also', 'flew', 'time', 'when', 'major', 'air', 'action', 'was', 'over', 'Nazi', 'planes', 'pilots', 'had', 'been', 'decimated', 'Almost', 'missions', 'Germany', 'were', 'unopposed', 'rarely', 'saw', 'Nazi', 'fighter', 'air.The', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'single', 'out', 'political', 'cover', 'Prince', 'Andrew', 'were', 'not', 'exposed', 'same', 'risks', 'colleagues', 'political', 'considerations.So', 'objective', 'history', 'movie', 'similar', 'George', 'Lucas', 'film', ""'red"", 'Tails', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'less', 'accurate', 'films', 'are', 'blatant', 'propaganda', 'pieces', 'defame', 'white', 'pilots', 'so', 'advance', 'case', 'small', 'group', 'black', 'pilots', 'other', 'hand', 'simple', 'distracting', 'entertainment', 'competent', 'Hollywood', 'effort', 'photography', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'rely', 'lot', 'stock', 'footage', 'battle', 'scenes', 'was', 'made', 'CGI', 'revolution', 'so', 'original', 'flying', 'sequences', 'use', 'real', 'planes', 'good', 'bad', 'Real', 'planes', 'look', 'real', 'planes', 'way', 'CGI', 'heavy', 'Lucas', 'Tails', 'planes', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'real', 'planes', 'left', 'soon', 'clear', 'producers', 'had', 'access', 'three', 'only', 'three', 'P-51s', 'anyone', 'who', 'WWII', 'war', 'birds', 'plus', 'restrict', 'kind', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'depicted']",Tuskegee Airmen VHS

This film also stars the equally versatile Cuba Gooding, who happens to be a household word in America.THE FILM IS BASED ON THESE EVENTS. The Tuskegee program began with the formation of the 99th Fighter Squadron at the Tuskegee Institute. After basic training the airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., then one of the few black graduates of West Point, then was transported to Casablanca, Morocco, on the USS Mariposa and to participate in the North African campaign. From Morocco they traveled by train to Oujda then to Tunis, the location from which they operated against the Luftwaffe. Flyers and ground crew alike largely were isolated by the racial segregation practices of their initial command, Colonel William W. Momyer. The Tuskegee Airmen were credited with 112 Luftwaffe aircraft shot down, the German-operated Italian destroyer TA-23 sunk by machine-gun fire, and destruction of numerous fuel dumps, trucks, and trains. The Tuskegee airmen flew more than 15,000 sorties on 1,500 missions. On a mission flown March 24, 1945, they escorting B-17s to bomb the Daimler-Benz tank factory at Berlin, Germany. During the action its pilots were credited with destroying three Me-262 jets of the Luftwaffe's all-jet Jagdgeschwader 7 in aerial combat that day.STORYLINE OF THE FILM. The film begins with several young African-Americans who meet on a train on their way to aviator school. They encounter a dose of reality during the trip, when they are required to move to a special blacks-only car on the train, to make room for white people (the white people are German prisoners of war). They encounter more doses of reality on the military base, where one of the officers, Major Joy, refers to them with the ""n word,"" and sees it as his personal mission to sink the entire Tuskegee training program. At any rate, Major Joy does not succeed, and the Tuskegee airmen travel to north Africa, where they see huge quantities of combat action. Laurence Fishburne survives, but Cuba Gooding crashes during a mission.The film is characterized by its occasional stylized dialogue and by its didactic script. Overall, the film is geared to people of the ages ten and up. The entire script seems to be about 25 pages long, as there are no lengthy dialogues. The violence is kept to a minimum. There is a minimum of bad words. This would make an excellent teaching device for a civics class, for middle school students.THEATRICALLY STYLIZED and DIDACTIC SCENES. The recruits spontaneously derive nicknames from the men's background, and spontaneously begin using these nicknames. Mr.Fishburne is called ""Iowa"" because his character is from Iowa. Cuba Gooding exclaims, ""Hey Iowa, are you ready for all this?"" Other nicknames are ""Stick"" and ""Train."" The theaterical technique of conferring a nickname that corresponds to a character's origin, was also used in the film, HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN.  Six minutes into HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN, a soldier is called by the nickname, ""BROOKLYN.""  In a scene typical of countless sports movies, Cadet Leroy expresses self-doubt about finishing training, in view of the fact that 1/3rd of the men had already dropped out. But Mr.Fishburne give him a pep-talk. At first, Leroy expresses self-doubt saying, ""I don't know."" Then, Mr.Fishburne give him more pep-talking, and Leroy half-heartedly answers, ""Yeah, I'm going to make it."" Finally, after more pep-talking, Leroy exclaims affirmatively, ""I'm going to make it."" Another didactic theme, found in this movie, and in other movies such as BILLY BUDD by Herman Melville, OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN with Richard Gere, and A SOLDIER'S STORY starring Adolph Caesar, is humiliation and abuse from the officers directed to new recruits. Thus, if you don't mind that your movie entertainment is sometimes preachy, corny, or didactic, then you won't mind these excesses in THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN.QUOTABLE QUOTES. The film contains a number of quotable quotes:(1) For example, after a crash kills one of the cadets, the liaison officer tells the other cadets, ""If you don't believe in God, you'd better find a damned good substitute.""(2) In a confrontation between Major Joy, who wants to see the Tuskegee program eliminated, we find this exchange. The Major exclaims, ""There's a war on,"" meaning that America should not be tinkering around with an experimental program to train black fliers. The Colonel replies to this with, ""And I'd prefer that war not be on this base,"" meaning that it is not the Major's business to dictate military policy to the Colonel.(3) Another great line is delivered by an older member of a chain gang, cutting tall weeds in a field by a country road, under the supervision of redneck guards with toting rifles. Two of the cadets, Cappy and Hannibal, experience engine trouble and they land on a country road by the chain gang. ""Just a little engine trouble,"" explains Hannibal (Mr.Fishburne) as he climbs out of his plane, and pulls off his goggles. Of course, this surprises the rednecks as well as the members of the chain gang. An older member of the chain gang smiles broadly, and quietly utters, ""They're colored fliers."" This low-key scene is likely to instill more pride in the viewing audience than a dozen touchdowns at the Superbowl. To repeat, the great line is: ""They're colored fliers.""The timing and development that went into this script is not something that can be easily be taught, or automatically learned, in film school.  I might even be willing to characterize the script-writer as a genius.  The ingenious sense of time and development, in the script, is especially evident in the scene when the 2 fliers land on a country road near a chain gang, and in the scene in the tent when the redneck bomber captain specifically requests the colored squadron.RED TAILS.  Okay, now it is May 9, 2014, and yesterday, I watched RED TAILS.  RED TAILS and THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN are easily distinguished, as follows: (1) RT is nearly all about combat missions, with nothing about recruitment or training of the pilots.  TTA spends about three quarters of its time on recruitment, training, and politics in the U.S. government, with about one quarter on combat; (2) RT contains plenty of phony-looking CG.  If TTA does have CG, it is not as blatantly obvious as the phony-looking CG that is found in RT; (3) RT has little in the way of character development, aside from the pilot's relationship with the Italian girl.  In contrast, TTA has a huge amount of character development, and almost every person with a speaking line has a well-developed character.  In particular, Mr. Lithgow plays a character who you will love to hate; (4) RT has watered-down representations of racism.  In contrast, TTA has plenty of overt, in-your-face representations of racism (just as overt as in the movie called ""42"").  By its intense depiction of racism, TTA is so much the more successful in depiction overcoming racism; (5)  RT will provide an amusing two hours, without a boring moment, and once you watch it, there won't be much reason to watch it again.  In contrast, TTA will live with you forever, and you will want to watch it repeatedly, perhaps once a year.",5,Fun to watch repeatedly.,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,7375,"['TUSKEGEE', 'AIRMEN',
