If you are a surfer, do not expect this to be a surfing movie. It's not. Indeed, the stereotypes and lingo are pretty much overplayed, and most surfers (Christian or not) will roll their eyes.This is a Christian message movie and speaks directly to young adults who do not know Jesus. It also speaks to reinvesting in family. It is moderately successful in these areas. I believe that Skipstone Productions will get better as they go, just as the church back in Georgia who produced ""Fireproof"" did.

1430125,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B004VRK49K,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I bought ""Cutback"" on DVD blindly yesterday thinking it was a surfing drama/sports flick akin to, say, 2002's ""Blue Crush (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"". It is and it isn't. The surfing and sports competition take a serious backseat to the inspirational coming-of-age drama.Released in 2010, ""Cutback"" tells the story of teenager Luke Harris (Justin Schwan) and his parents (Greg Carlson & Raquel Gardner). The mother's a woman of faith, but the father and son aren't. There are signs of marital problems, but this is a very solid family. Luke's goofy best friend, Casey, isn't so fortunate (Angel Cruz). Luke's a natural at surfing and wants to pursue it, but his dad insists he goes to college. Meanwhile, a beautiful redhead catches his eye (Emily played by Kelsey Sanders) and everything seems to be bliss, and then...This is a low-budget, straight-to-video film and shows some of the limitations thereof, like questionable acting by some of the peripheral characters (e.g. Casey and Luke's boss), but it's Grade A at heart. Seriously, this is an outstanding coming-of-age drama. Despite some of the questionable acting I was able to buy into the characters and their story. The people became ""real"" to me because they ring true. Excellent job by the director, writers and cast in this regard.What I especially liked was the overtness of things pertaining to God, like prayer and such. Mainline films (whether theatrical or TV) have to be ""politically correct"" in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Anything having to do with God is typically watered down, (but not always, see the pull-no-punches ""Black Death (+ Digital Copy)"", as an example). Thankfully, independent films aren't as constrained in this respect and can therefore address ""touchy areas"" like God and faith.""Cutback"" boldly shows the awful truth along with the gospel truth. Mistakes happen, anger is flared, divorce is threatened, tragedy strikes and intense doubts are vented. But amidst all this is the nobility of the central characters, which makes you root for them. Luke and Casey are bosom buddies, and it shows; there's a palpable attraction between Luke and Emily; Luke's dad is a weary cop who's understandably sick of being taken for granted; and his mother's a precious cornerstone of faith, but not without her own failings.The film is also salted with inspirational scenes that are nigh life-changing. There's a potent discussion on integrity at a youth group that forces the viewer to check their own integrity; there's a marital counseling session that's similarly effective; there's a visceral response to tragedy and the equally visceral counter, albeit wisely subdued.I'll be honest with you, this is one of the best coming-of-age dramas I've ever seen. It's inspirational, even enlightening, not to mention heart-warming and moving. The only reasons I don't rate it higher than A- is because it has the limitations of a low-budget, independent film, like dubious acting with the secondary characters, but most of the main characters are excellent or very good. Plus I don't want to mislead potential viewers into thinking this is some polished, big film. It's not; it's small, but it's Goliath at heart.Most importantly, ""Cutback"" boldly addresses the most important issues of life -- ambition, compromise, folly, defeat, resolve, forgiveness, God, faith, love, loyalty, hope, death, grief and life.All films are contrived in the sense that they involve actors performing from a written script. The secret of successful films is that they pull it off without seeming contrived; that is, they come across as real life. Too many independent inspirational films aren't able to do this and, consequently, they're painfully awkward at times. ""Cutback"" soars above this, triumphantly.The film was shot in S. California and is lean & mean at 87 minutes.GRADE: A-",5,"Wow, an ""inspirational film"" that's actually inspiring",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3867,"['bought', 'Cutback', 'DVD', 'blindly', 'yesterday', 'thinking', 'was', 'surfing', 'drama/sports', 'flick', 'akin', 'say', '2002', 'Blue', 'Crush', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', ""n't"", 'surfing', 'sports', 'competition', 'take', 'serious', 'backseat', 'inspirational', 'coming-of-age', 'drama.Released', '2010', 'Cutback', 'story', 'teenager', 'Luke', 'Harris', 'Justin', 'Schwan', 'parents', 'Greg', 'Carlson', 'Raquel', 'Gardner', 'mother', 'woman', 'faith', 'father', 'son', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'signs', 'marital', 'problems', 'very', 'solid', 'family', 'Luke', 'goofy', 'best', 'friend', 'Casey', ""n't"", 'so', 'fortunate', 'Angel', 'Cruz', 'Luke', 'natural', 'surfing', 'pursue', 'dad', 'college', 'Meanwhile', 'beautiful', 'redhead', 'eye', 'Emily', 'played', 'Kelsey', 'Sanders', 'everything', 'be', 'bliss', 'then', 'low-budget', 'straight-to-video', 'film', 'limitations', 'thereof', 'questionable', 'acting', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'e.g', 'Casey', 'Luke', 'boss', 'Grade', 'A', 'heart', 'Seriously', 'outstanding', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'questionable', 'acting', 'was', 'able', 'buy', 'characters', 'story', 'people', 'became', 'real', 'ring', 'true', 'Excellent', 'job', 'director', 'writers', 'cast', 'regard.What', 'especially', 'liked', 'was', 'overtness', 'things', 'pertaining', 'God', 'prayer', 'such', 'Mainline', 'films', 'theatrical', 'TV', 'have', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'order', 'appeal', 'wide', 'audience', 'possible', 'Anything', 'having', 'do', 'God', 'typically', 'watered', 'down', 'not', 'always', 'see', 'pull-no-punches', 'Black', 'Death', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'example', 'Thankfully', 'independent', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'constrained', 'respect', 'can', 'therefore', 'address', 'touchy', 'areas', 'God', 'faith', 'Cutback', 'boldly', 'awful', 'truth', 'gospel', 'truth', 'Mistakes', 'happen', 'anger', 'flared', 'divorce', 'threatened', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'intense', 'doubts', 'are', 'vented', 'nobility', 'central', 'characters', 'root', 'Luke', 'Casey', 'are', 'bosom', 'buddies', 'palpable', 'attraction', 'Luke', 'Emily', 'Luke', 'dad', 'weary', 'cop', 'who', 'understandably', 'sick', 'being', 'taken', 'granted', 'mother', 'precious', 'cornerstone', 'faith', 'not', 'own', 'failings.The', 'film', 'also', 'salted', 'inspirational', 'scenes', 'are', 'nigh', 'life-changing', 'potent', 'discussion', 'integrity', 'youth', 'group', 'viewer', 'check', 'own', 'integrity', 'marital', 'counseling', 'session', 'similarly', 'effective', 'visceral', 'response', 'tragedy', 'equally', 'visceral', 'counter', 'wisely', 'subdued.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'best', 'coming-of-age', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'inspirational', 'even', 'enlightening', 'not', 'mention', 'heart-warming', 'moving', 'only', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'rate', 'higher', 'A-', 'limitations', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'dubious', 'acting', 'secondary', 'characters', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'mislead', 'potential', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'polished', 'big', 'film', 'not', 'small', 'Goliath', 'heart.Most', 'importantly', 'Cutback', 'boldly', 'most', 'important', 'issues', 'life', 'ambition', 'compromise', 'folly', 'defeat', 'resolve', 'forgiveness', 'God', 'faith', 'love', 'loyalty', 'hope', 'death', 'grief', 'life.All', 'films', 'are', 'contrived', 'sense', 'involve', 'actors', 'performing', 'written', 'script', 'secret', 'successful', 'films', 'pull', 'off', 'seeming', 'contrived', 'come', 'real', 'life', 'Too', 'many', 'independent', 'inspirational', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'do', 'consequently', ""'re"", 'painfully', 'awkward', 'times', 'Cutback', 'triumphantly.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'S.', 'California', 'lean', 'mean', '87', 'minutes.GRADE', 'A-']",Cutback
