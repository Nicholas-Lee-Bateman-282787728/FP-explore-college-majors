706540,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000694WN,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","I remember my first skateboard.  Odd, this is probably how every other review for this film probably goes, but being as I seem to watch quite a bit of clich&eacute; ridden drama these days, why not begin with this very simple memory.  It was the summer of 1986, I was eight years old, my younger brother was six.  Our grandparents found this board in their basement, possibly my mothers or fathers, and decided it was our time to feel the harsh times of the pavement.  The board was nothing spectacular, a ""Bun Buster"" I believe, and it provided hours upon hours of scrapes, scuffs, and thankfully no broken bones as we sailed down the hills of Virginia.  It was something that I believe my brother continued with, but I just never found it to stick.  I pursued other hobbies, but I will always remember this little piece of wood with probably clay wheels that gave us the war wounds of life.  Now, 29-years old, I had the opportunity to see where my fascination with this semi-sport (now full-fledged) arrived.  While I have to admit that it took a second viewing with the audio commentary blasting through my ears to fully appreciate the film, I have to stand and applaud what these teens endured to raise the stakes, but go above the clich&eacute; of the average sports star.I hate films about sports.  I guess the pre-fabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre.  Use exhibit ""A"" - ""The Game Plan"" as evidence of this if you want.  So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like ""Step into Liquid"" and ""Billabong Odyssey"".  I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I wasn't happy.  I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs.  With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s.  The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating.  The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention.  I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool.  I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now.  It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day.  I wanted to know the men behind the myths.Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary.  His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished ""wow-ed"" me.  This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see.  Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera.  He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface.  He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project.  While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me.  It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.Jay Adams.  Tony Alva.  Jeff Ho.  Peggy Oki.  Wentzle Ruml.  These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees.  While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport.  Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level.  This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for.  ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship.  We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that.  I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend.  It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again - they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time.  I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming - the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events.  As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now.  Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times.  The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film.  Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voiceover, wasn't needed at all.  They could have spent the money elsewhere.  On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing.  Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events.  Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away.  Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.Grade: ***  out of *****",4,"The pools are empty, but these Z-Boys still give us an Endless Summer...",1185667200,"07 29,

However, this movie was a blast for me because I grew up on LA's Westside and went to school with several of these guys. The ""surfing and skating"" crowd at Venice High School in Los Angeles might have radicalized the sport, but they were never viewed as evil or with distain by the most of their peers. In fact, the surfers were viewed as a kind of a ""cool"" group because so much of the summer culture revolved around the beach. However, as they state clearly in the film, they did feel somewhat marginalized from the mainstream. Furthermore, their sport and efforts never got the full measure of respect from their peers at the time, although, time, fame & fortune and several prestigious awards from the Sundance Film Festival have changed all that.

706550,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0000694WN,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is a documentary on the Z-Boys of Venice, California from the tough Dogtown neighborhood.The Z-Boys aka the Zephyr team literally revolutionized skateboarding with an aggressive in-your-face style that shredded the competition.Growing up in the 1970's, the documentary is blessed with old school footage (that is great quality compared to many surfing films that came out in the early 90's) that I just kept repeating... ""sick"".The documentary shows the kids skating as well as a few classic clips of other competitors of skateboarding in the 50's and 60's and how the Z-Boys just came in and shattered the image of what skateboarding was all about with their freestyle surfing way on a skateboard.Also, footage of the group skating in emptied pools brought upon the California drought.Also, how the friends became rivals as skateboard manufacturers started to offer contracts and get a hold of a Z-Boy and make money off them.Naturally, the talents of the kids of that time earned them great money but not all were able to overcome the limelight that introduced a few to drugs and hard tmes.From the awesome freestyle of Jay Adams, the competitor and uber talented Tony Alva (aka godfather of skateboarding) and talented Stacy Peralta (who gone on to create Powell-Peralta Skateboards, the Bones Brigade which led to some guy named Tony Hawk), we are reminded of what these three and other members of the Zephyr team brought to skateboarding.My favorite part of the film which I can't stop watching is the 1975 Del Mar Invitational where people saw the Zephyr team debut and saw a new style that no one has seen before.  What makes it even more exciting was the footage of the skateboarding competitiors of that time and then the entrance of the Zephyr team and seeing how the competitors were frustrated by the Zephyr team.That was a definite, classic moment in my opinion from yesteryear and to see the footage today is just incredible.As for the video quality of this documentary, it was expected that certain footage (being very old) would be grainy and we would see some artifacts but a lot of those messes were cleaned up and look great on this DVD.As for the DVD, this is the second release of the DVD (Deluxe Edition) which features a sneak peak at the theatrical release of ""Lords of Dogtown"", two webisodes of ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""Alternate Ending"", Director and Editor commentary and extended raw footage.Footage includes Stacy Peralta visiting the original Zephyr store owner Jeff Ho shaping some surfboards in Hawaii and even Stacy Peralta and film crew skateboarding at an old Z-Boy hangout/skateboard spot.Awesome footage of the group and competitions combined with a cool soundtrack, cool interviews of most of Zephyr team and a lot of cool, in-depth information of the past and what happened to the members of the team now.Suffice to say that this film has done really well on the film festival circuit especially at Sundance and AFI and Stacey Peralta continues to show his talent as a director.",5,AWESOME!,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,3035,"['Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'documentary', 'Z-Boys', 'Venice', 'California', 'tough', 'Dogtown', 'neighborhood.The', 'Z-Boys', 'aka', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'literally', 'revolutionized', 'skateboarding', 'aggressive', 'in-your-face', 'style', 'shredded', 'competition.Growing', 'up', '1970', 'documentary', 'blessed', 'old', 'school', 'footage', 'great', 'quality', 'compared', 'many', 'surfing', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'early', '90', 'just', 'kept', 'repeating', 'sick', '.The', 'documentary', 'kids', 'skating', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'classic', 'clips', 'other', 'competitors', 'skateboarding', '50', '60', 'how', 'Z-Boys', 'just', 'came', 'shattered', 'image', 'what', 'skateboarding', 'was', 'freestyle', 'surfing', 'way', 'skateboard.Also', 'footage', 'group', 'skating', 'emptied', 'pools', 'brought', 'California', 'drought.Also', 'how', 'friends', 'became', 'rivals', 'skateboard', 'manufacturers', 'started', 'offer', 'contracts', 'get', 'hold', 'Z-Boy', 'make', 'money', 'them.Naturally', 'talents', 'kids', 'time', 'earned', 'great', 'money', 'not', 'were', 'able', 'overcome', 'limelight', 'introduced', 'few', 'drugs', 'hard', 'awesome', 'freestyle', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'competitor', 'uber', 'talented', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'godfather', 'skateboarding', 'talented', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'who', 'gone', 'create', 'Powell-Peralta', 'Skateboards', 'Bones', 'Brigade', 'led', 'guy', 'named', 'Tony', 'Hawk', 'are', 'reminded', 'what', 'three', 'other', 'members', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'brought', 'skateboarding.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', '1975', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Invitational', 'where', 'people', 'saw', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'debut', 'saw', 'new', 'style', 'one', 'seen', 'before', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'was', 'footage', 'skateboarding', 'competitiors', 'time', 'then', 'entrance', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'seeing', 'how', 'competitors', 'were', 'frustrated', 'Zephyr', 'was', 'definite', 'classic', 'moment', 'opinion', 'yesteryear', 'see', 'footage', 'today', 'just', 'incredible.As', 'video', 'quality', 'documentary', 'was', 'expected', 'certain', 'footage', 'being', 'very', 'old', 'would', 'be', 'grainy', 'would', 'see', 'artifacts', 'lot', 'messes', 'were', 'cleaned', 'up', 'look', 'great', 'DVD.As', 'DVD', 'second', 'release', 'DVD', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'sneak', 'peak', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'two', 'webisodes', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'Director', 'Editor', 'commentary', 'extended', 'raw', 'footage.Footage', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'visiting', 'original', 'Zephyr', 'store', 'owner', 'Jeff', 'Ho', 'shaping', 'surfboards', 'Hawaii', 'even', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'film', 'crew', 'skateboarding', 'old', 'Z-Boy', 'hangout/skateboard', 'spot.Awesome', 'footage', 'group', 'competitions', 'combined', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'cool', 'interviews', 'most', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'lot', 'cool', 'in-depth', 'information', 'past', 'what', 'happened', 'members', 'team', 'now.Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'film', 'festival', 'circuit', 'especially', 'Sundance', 'AFI', 'Stacey', 'Peralta', 'show', 'talent', 'director']",N/A

There were two Santa Monicas, the exclusive neighborhood and of course, Dogtown. Dogtown was a tough neighborhood but it created a pasttime for youth--skateboarding. The original Z-Boys tell their stories detailing what it was like to be young, carefree and skating on the pavement.Before skateboarding became a competetive sport, it was a pasttime for the youth to be creative and have fun. Along with surfing, it was considered a sport for outcasts. That didn't stop them from having their fun. Like any activity, it kept them out of trouble and fostered creativity. And like any sport, it became commercialized. Jay Adams, a former Z-Boy, avoided gaining any endorsements because of deadlines, contracts, timeliness, anything that associated with the establishment. For him, skateboarding was exhiliarating. But he also had regrets as well too. For Tony Alva, it capatulted him into the spotlight. He enjoyed getting endorsements, going around the world, and making money. But he too broke away and created his own line of skateboards and continues to this day skate. It is the sport that has fond memories.What I like about this documentary is that it showed us how much fun people had before the advancement of technology. Before Internet and video games, people went out the house and did something; even if it wasn't conventional. They enjoyed life without being confined to the trappings of wealth. When the big corporations stepped in, they took out the enjoyment of not only skating, but the camraderie of the group. Let's not forget that the small shops that got them in local competitions were forced to close their doors taking away their creativity and talent.Dogtown and Z-Boys are reminiscent of what it is to be young.

706552,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0000694WN,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[5, 5]","The first time I saw this amazing documentary was when the punky types on the night shift at my local video hut were watching a bootleg VHS copy a few months before the video actually came out.  Nearly every customer in the store craned their necks up towards the screen, and sat transfixed, watching the history of modern skateboarding unfold onscreen.  [Note to self: if it was that absorbing in the video store, be sure to get it when it comes out!]""Dogtown And Z-Boys"" is a thoroughly engaging, well-produced film which recalls the dim, pre-punk origins of the skateboarding scene that came out of LA in the 1970s and has grabbed hold of antisocial daredevil types across the world ever since.  I was transfixed by this film, from beginning to end, and found there wasn't a dull moment or false note in the entire production.  I should hasten to add that I have never been much of a skateboarding fan; when I moved to Berkeley in the mid-1980s, skateboarding was already firmly identified with punk rock rebelliousness, with swarms of leather- and denim-clad losers barrelling down the sidewalks at top speed, tediously intent on messing with the minds of all the uptight squares who dared to be less cool than they were.  As a punk rock fan who prefers walking to knocking others off the sidewalk, I intensely dislike the culture of show-offy, in-your-face self-centeredness and machismo that skateboarders have adopted; in the 1990s, when the scene went mainstream and became commercialized as an ""extreme"" sport, it became even that much more tedious and trivial.  But this film shows where it all started, with a motley bunch of scruffy teenage Santa Monica beach bums who took the elegance and attitude of the world's best surfers and adapted it to the humble (and then quite primitive) skateboard.  The documentary appealed to me both aesthetically and personally -- the Dog Town skateboarders were all undeniably hella cool, and their story is pretty amazing.  Also, I remember having the same sort of restlessness and rebelliousness during the post-hippie, pre-punk years of my adolescence, and watching the old footage of the Dog Town crew, I was powerfully reminded of my own proud years as a 1970s juvenile delinquent.  The film's tone rang true, which isn't surprising since it was produced by guys who were part of the original Z-Boys clique.  It's a captivating, funny, stylish and very creative film, which exhalts a sexy urban subculture without exploiting its subjects or leaving out any members of the audience who might not skate themselves.  Great soundtrack, too.

Close enough in size, metabolic rate, sensory function to be recognizable to us, or we to 'them'? Will 'they' - however bizarre - perceive themselves as 'just plain zenobians' and us as freaky? Of course!Dogtown is a part of greater Los Angeles including south Santa Monica, Venice Beach, and Marina del Rey, a rundown ethnically scrambled slum in the 1960s and 1970s. The Z Boys -- Z for Zephyr -- were the tough local kids who 'proved' themselves first as reckless surfers and then as 'outlaw' skate-boarders, using their surf-style moves and their Dogtown attitudes to invent a 'youth culture' which, from their vantage point, conquered the world. Some of them - Tony Alva for instance - achieved enormous celebrity in the conquered territories. A few made lucrative careers out of their drop-out kids-stuff passion. This film is a documentary of their lifestyle, made up of old scraps of film, mostly amateur, of their escapades as teenagers, along with stunning still photos by an ardent journalist/chronicler, mingled with interviews of the same boys as men in their middle age. The editing is provocatively jagged and jerky, all quick cuts and stuttering images by design, as raggedy as the vacant lots and empty swimming pools of Dogtown where the Z Boys polished their tricks. Actor Sean Penn is the off-screen narrator, but the director/filmmaker Stacy Peralta was a Z Boy himself, an eloquent spokesman for his own life and art. There's nothing dispassionate or exterior about this documentation; these guys truly believe in their own seminal significance. ""It all started here,"" they say again and again, ""with us.""I'm not so much older than the Z Boys but I'm a different species, from another planet. I've never skate-boarded in my life, although I have skied and kayaked and ice-boated and scuba-dived. But my obsession with style, with exaltation over doing something the best it could be done, with a physical aesthetic at odds with the conventional, seems to me remarkably similar to the rebellious egotism of the Z Boys. My 'home boys' have also conquered the world and compelled others to imitate us. We too have perceived ourselves as 'lords' of our Dogtown. We take our lifestyle just as seriously as the Z Boys. Isn't that rather odd, since they've never heard of me/us any more than I'd ever heard of them before this film! Is it possible that golfers, stock brokers, and pastry chefs all suppose that they are the paladins of culture, the Lords of their parallel Dogtowns? Evolution seems to have equipped all of us with a valuable proprioception that enables us to ignore the fact that nobody outside our own delimited Dogtown has any notion of our importance.I'm getting quite an education in 'alternate realities' lately -- street art, skate-boarding, video game design, all momentous life styles to the people who practice them.

In fact, it comes as little surprise that a brat pack of surfboys were the ones to turn skateboarding on its ears in the 70's, by introducing extreme maneuvers that left the judges agape when they reintroduced national competitions in the late 70's.  Here you get the unvarnished impressions of the motherf*#!ers of invention themselves, exploiting every school yard and swimming pool in their immediate vicinity to give skateboarding a whole new look and feel.Stacy Peralta captures the energy of the Z-Boys and how they rise to fame and in some cases fortune by turning this kids' sports into one of the great extreme sports of the 90's.  Like ""Riding Giants,"" Peralta has fun piecing together the history and breakthroughs of the sport with a lot of personal interviews with the original Z-Boys.

Because surfs ended around 10am the boys had to occupy themselves during the day, and skateboarding became an extension of their surfing identity.  During the 1970s there was a drought in California, and swimming pools had to be emptied.  The boys would jump fences, drain pools, and learn to go vertical in the pools.This documentary was made by one of the original members of the Z-boys, and that's why there's so an intimate and personal feel to the documentary.  It also helps that the director's partner was the photo-journalist who documented and made popular Dogtown skateboarding.This film is a labor of love, a remembrance of good times past.  There's also a distinctive rhythm and style to the documentary that makes it as interesting to watch as the teenagers carving their way across swimming pools on their skateboards.",5,The Evolution of Skateboarding,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",2012,1253,"['Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'documentary', 'back', 'time', 'Zephyr', 'skateboarding', 'team', 'who', 'collectively', 'created', 'modern', 'sport', 'skateboarding', 'thus', 'launch', 'X', 'sports.Jeff', 'Ho', 'was', 'surfboard', 'maker', 'who', 'was', 'genius', 'carving', 'out', 'revolutionary', 'surfboards', 'founding', 'own', 'surf', 'shop', 'partners', 'also', 'adopted', 'surfing', 'teenage', 'misfits', 'Dogtown', 'area', 'mentored', 'surfs', 'ended', 'around', '10am', 'boys', 'had', 'occupy', 'day', 'skateboarding', 'became', 'extension', 'surfing', 'identity', '1970s', 'was', 'drought', 'California', 'swimming', 'pools', 'had', 'be', 'emptied', 'boys', 'would', 'jump', 'fences', 'drain', 'pools', 'learn', 'go', 'vertical', 'pools.This', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'original', 'members', 'Z-boys', 'why', 'so', 'intimate', 'personal', 'feel', 'documentary', 'also', 'director', 'partner', 'was', 'photo-journalist', 'who', 'documented', 'made', 'popular', 'Dogtown', 'skateboarding.This', 'film', 'labor', 'love', 'remembrance', 'good', 'times', 'past', 'also', 'distinctive', 'rhythm', 'style', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'watch', 'teenagers', 'carving', 'way', 'swimming', 'pools', 'skateboards']",N/A

Other X-Games superstars are also well known and have their own games and are nationally recognized (Kelly Slater, Matt Hoffman, etc).  Snowboarding is an Olympic sport.  Skateboarding is at an incredible level of popularity.  Skateboarding today is alive because of a group from the Dogtown neighborhood of Venice, CA.  This group was called the Z-Boys.  The Z-Boys were from the Zephyr competition team.  They were first an elite group of surfers who only started skating when the ocean didn't have the waves for surfing.  The Z-Boys ended up helping propel skateboarding to new levels of popularity.Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary and it deals with how they got started in skating (and surfing, because it is relevant to the skating) and about the impact that they had in the skate world.  The Z-Boys created new moves that would set the standard for what it means to skate.  They began by using what they did in surfing and emulated top surfers, but when California had a huge drought, they started skating in dried out pools (often without permission).  This led to the beginnings of vert skating, and had the Z-Boys not skated in pools, perhaps the style of skating today would not even exist (vert ramps did not exist when the Z-Boys were skating pools).  They were testing the limits of what was possible in skating and with each passing day they discovered that more and more was possible.  The Z-Boys made it to the top of the skating world, and they inspired new generations of skaters.  This is their story.I had never heard of the Z-Boys until this documentary came out and the most I knew of skating was that I couldn't skate, and whatever I learned from the Tony Hawk video games.  It would be hard to believe the influence that these skaters had on the skate world if not for today's influential skaters (Hawk, Burnquist, etc) also talking about how they were influenced by the Z-Boys.

Instead it is a fascinating story about how a group of kids from a low income, L.A. neighborhood graduated from surfing to skateboarding and became the legendary Zephyrs(or Z-Boys) skateboarding team.Using urban guerilla tactics, they created a style and attitude, that revolutionized the sport and made it, what it is today.The film shows how many of these kids (including Tony Alva) went on to a superstar status within the sport. Director, Stacy Peralta has done a wonderful job of telling this story, through the use of recent interviews, beautiful still photography and tons of actual archival footage from that period. You will be amazed as you watch the film footage of these skateboarders as they seem to defy both physics and gravity in an aggressive style that is like poetry in motion.Also, listen for a great classic rock soundtrack (everything from Jimi Hendrix to Pink Floyd to Black Sabbath) that recalls the era.

I'm currently 26 years old and started skating back in 1987 at the age of 11. Watching the Z-Boys from my era (the 80's -90's) the Bones Brigade sparked my curiosity in discovering who influenced them. I've heard so many stories now over the years from the older skaters about how the Dogtown skate team changed our world. I read articles and saw photos. But never was able to witness first-hand what was taking place at that time. This documentary is one of the rawest compilations of footage that I've ever seen. Sure, It may be self-congratulatory. But I don't think anyone else besides the actual Dogtown team could actually convey the story more effectively. Words can't explain how beautiful this documentary is. It covers the foundation of modern-day skateboarding beginning with the aggressive so-cal 70's Zephyr surf team weaving in and out of Piers and metal wreckage. To the birth of modern day vertical skateboarding and early street skating, which clearly mimicked the popular 70's surfers individual styles. This movie displays how a once decayed sport such as skateboarding was rejuvenated in the 70's by a group of young teens. But most importantly this is an outstanding educational tool intended for those who skate and those who don't skate. From a skateboarding standpoint this documentary will show you that the trick necessarily doesn't make the man, but style will ultimately separate you from the rest. Style and individualism is something that is almost extinct today amongst skaters. Hopefully a film of this magnitude can save the actual soul of skateboarding. Kids with Eric Koston, Jaime Thomas, and Stevie Williams posters on their wall need to actually view the talent that emerged from this tough neighborhood and gave birth to not only a sport, but a world wide sub-culture and phenomenon that transcends age, race, and gender. This film will make you grab your board and hit the streets or the local park no matter who you are.

When it did finally come to my town, I dragged my husband to it; it certainly confused him, seeing his 39 year old computer nerd wife turn into a teen age skate rat overnight!In my mispent youth, I lived about 20 miles south of Dogtown &amp; idolized Tony Alva. I had his magazine shots covering my walls; I memorized every issue of Skateboarder when it arrived in my mailbox. I also spent every available moment gonzoing the local hilly streets with my friends. As soon as I was old enough to get my own place, where did I move to? You guessed it, Dogtown. I don't talk much about those days now, or at least I didn't until DOGTOWN &amp; Z-BOYS came out.This movie is wonderful. It really captures what that time felt like, when skateboarding was still closely allied to surfing &amp; just finding it's own identity. The archival footage is amazing, especially the P.O.P. sequence, &amp; the early shots of the Z-Boys at Paul Revere &amp; Bellagio. The editing is brilliant, &amp; the music rocks! What is truly remarkable is that it manages to make skateboarding accessible &amp; enjoyable to those who never participated, such as my husband. He's just as blown away at some of the footage as I was.The DVD transfer is great. It's nice to be able to slow down some of the sections, or freeze a frame to get a better look, or just repeat your fave sections over &amp; over again. The voice-over commentary by Peralta on the bonus track adds many anecdotes that had to be left out of the film, as well as giving credit to many of the people who contributed footage the documentary relies heavily on. There's also an additional, uncut film of today's Tony A during a pool session, which is nice to see.The only reason this film doesn't get 5 stars is because of some of the people it left out. Where's Tom Inouye, of the notorious Inouye's Pool Service? When it came to outlaw pool-finding, Tom was the man! Laura Thornhill was probably the only other hard-core girl who got attention at the time; she's completely unmentioned. Although Stacy Peralta gets his props for modesty, he sometimes errs on the side of being TOO modest; there was a spectacular Arizona Pipe session I recall that goes unmentioned, one that Stacy made history at. It would have been nice to see some of that footage too.All in all, Dogtown &amp; Z-Boys can't be beat if you remember those days.

I have not done anything that would remotely be considered riding a skateboard, but at some point in the past I have stood on one and tried to maintain my balance.  So when even when they talk about the first generation of skateboarders who simply navigated slalom courses such things are way beyond me and when we get to what the Z-Boys are doing in Dogtown we are no longer talking people who live on the same planet as I do.  Even if the Z-Boys are tooting their own horns, it seems pretty clear that everybody else in their world thinks they have plenty to be arrogant about, both then and now.""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is a 2001 documentary directed by Stacy Peralta, who is not only one of the original Z-Boys but also the writer of the screenplay for ""Lords of Dogtown"" (Peralta co-writes this documentary with photo-journalist Craig Stecyk, whose Dogtown articles in ""Skateboarding"" magazine were seminal in creating the Z-Boy legend).  In point of fact, I checked out this documentary because I am tired of just watching trailers for that film and if it came here I must have blinked and missed it.  That movie comes out on DVD in October, so I checked out this documentary instead.  Basically what we have here is not only the stories of these legendary skateboarders and the fame and fortune that they found, to varying degrees, but the history of how skateboarding became the cutting edge of the extreme sports movement that now sees X-Games and X-sports at the Olympics.One of the strengths of this documentary is that you understand exactly the four things that came together to make skateboarding what is was because of these kids in the beachfront slum located between Santa Monica and Venice in California.  First, these kids were surfers, but the reality is that you cannot surf all day, so you have to find something else to do, which is what gets you to skateboards as basically little surf boards on wheels.  Second, you have the invention of urethane wheels for skateboards, replacing the clay ones appropriated from regular skates, which makes a complete difference in terms of being able to ride your board.  Third, you have the element of thrill seeking that comes not from surfing in general but surfing in that particular neighborhood, where surfers do in and around the burned out piers.  If you risk banging your head and drowning to get your kicks, then skating on concrete does not exactly pale in comparison.  Finally, the California drought of the late 1970s stopped the people of Los Angeles from drinking water in restaurants, watering their lawns, and keeping their pools full.  These empty L.A. pools are where skateboarding really takes off because this is what introduces the vertical into the equation.  At first the goal is simply to ride your skateboard above the light in the pool, then to side up so only one wheel is on the rim, and then we get eventually and logically to a complete takeoff.For me the history of the sport and how the Z-boys (named for the Zephyr surfer shop run by Skip Engblom and Jeff Ho) ended up on the cutting edge is more interesting than the individual stories.  First Tony Alva is the greatest skateboarder in the world and then maybe it is Stacy Peralta because of his self-promotion, but probably Jay Adams was the best of them all.  The problem is that they all look pretty good to me, and Peralta's documentary works mainly because in addition to the talking heads of the 40-year-old Z-Boys today he has home movies of these skaters in their glory days.  I understand that demigods like Tony Hawk consider the Z-Boys to be the Olympians or yore, but I really do not have any appreciation for why Alva and Adams are way better than Zephyr teammates Bob Biniak or Paul Constantineau any more than I understand why 70's skateboard champion David Hackett is on a lower rung in the pantheon.  I wonder if ""Lords of Dogtown"" will manage to make such distinctions clearer to me when this documentary could not, but I know already that the film will not give me the understanding of the history of the sport that I get from ""Dogtown and Z-Boys.""",4,Stacy Peralta's documentary about the Z-Boys of skateboarding,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,4154,"['record', 'have', 'been', 'skateboard', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'anything', 'would', 'remotely', 'be', 'considered', 'riding', 'skateboard', 'point', 'past', 'have', 'stood', 'one', 'tried', 'maintain', 'balance', 'So', 'when', 'even', 'when', 'talk', 'first', 'generation', 'skateboarders', 'who', 'simply', 'navigated', 'slalom', 'courses', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'when', 'get', 'what', 'Z-Boys', 'are', 'doing', 'Dogtown', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'talking', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'same', 'planet', 'do', 'Even', 'Z-Boys', 'are', 'tooting', 'own', 'horns', 'pretty', 'clear', 'everybody', 'else', 'world', 'have', 'plenty', 'be', 'arrogant', 'then', 'now', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', '2001', 'documentary', 'directed', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'original', 'Z-Boys', 'also', 'writer', 'screenplay', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'Peralta', 'documentary', 'photo-journalist', 'Craig', 'Stecyk', 'Dogtown', 'Skateboarding', 'magazine', 'were', 'seminal', 'creating', 'Z-Boy', 'legend', 'point', 'fact', 'checked', 'out', 'documentary', 'am', 'tired', 'just', 'watching', 'trailers', 'film', 'came', 'here', 'must', 'have', 'blinked', 'missed', 'movie', 'out', 'DVD', 'October', 'so', 'checked', 'out', 'documentary', 'instead', 'Basically', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'stories', 'legendary', 'skateboarders', 'fame', 'fortune', 'found', 'varying', 'degrees', 'history', 'how', 'skateboarding', 'became', 'cutting', 'edge', 'extreme', 'sports', 'movement', 'now', 'X-Games', 'X-sports', 'Olympics.One', 'strengths', 'documentary', 'understand', 'exactly', 'four', 'things', 'came', 'together', 'make', 'skateboarding', 'what', 'was', 'kids', 'beachfront', 'slum', 'located', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'Venice', 'California', 'First', 'kids', 'were', 'surfers', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'surf', 'day', 'have', 'find', 'something', 'else', 'do', 'what', 'skateboards', 'basically', 'little', 'surf', 'boards', 'wheels', 'Second', 'have', 'invention', 'urethane', 'wheels', 'skateboards', 'replacing', 'clay', 'ones', 'appropriated', 'regular', 'skates', 'complete', 'difference', 'terms', 'being', 'able', 'ride', 'board', 'Third', 'have', 'element', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'not', 'surfing', 'general', 'surfing', 'particular', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'surfers', 'do', 'burned', 'out', 'piers', 'risk', 'banging', 'head', 'drowning', 'get', 'kicks', 'then', 'skating', 'concrete', 'not', 'exactly', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Finally', 'California', 'drought', 'late', '1970s', 'stopped', 'people', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'drinking', 'water', 'restaurants', 'watering', 'lawns', 'keeping', 'pools', 'full', 'empty', 'L.A.', 'pools', 'are', 'where', 'skateboarding', 'really', 'off', 'vertical', 'equation', 'first', 'goal', 'simply', 'ride', 'skateboard', 'light', 'pool', 'then', 'side', 'up', 'so', 'only', 'one', 'wheel', 'rim', 'then', 'get', 'eventually', 'logically', 'complete', 'takeoff.For', 'history', 'sport', 'how', 'Z-boys', 'named', 'Zephyr', 'surfer', 'shop', 'run', 'Skip', 'Engblom', 'Jeff', 'Ho', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'edge', 'more', 'interesting', 'individual', 'stories', 'First', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'greatest', 'skateboarder', 'world', 'then', 'maybe', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'self-promotion', 'probably', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'was', 'best', 'problem', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'Peralta', 'documentary', 'works', 'mainly', 'addition', 'talking', 'heads', '40-year-old', 'Z-Boys', 'today', 'home', 'movies', 'skaters', 'glory', 'days', 'understand', 'demigods', 'Tony', 'Hawk', 'consider', 'Z-Boys', 'be', 'Olympians', 'yore', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'appreciation', 'why', 'Alva', 'Adams', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'Zephyr', 'Bob', 'Biniak', 'Paul', 'Constantineau', 'more', 'understand', 'why', '70', 'skateboard', 'champion', 'David', 'Hackett', 'lower', 'rung', 'pantheon', 'wonder', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'will', 'manage', 'make', 'such', 'distinctions', 'clearer', 'when', 'documentary', 'could', 'not', 'know', 'already', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'understanding', 'history', 'sport', 'get', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys']",N/A

White ""impossiblefunky""","[2, 2]","While this documentary could have been an incestuous, self-congratulatory promo piece for director Stacy Perralta, he manages to present himself and his childhood pals (the title's ""Z-Boys"") from an outsider's point of view. Perralta attempts to show a ""warts and all"" portrait of he and his group. While there may be ""sins of the past' that remain out of the camera's view, these are secondary to the wider scope of the film.DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS focuses on the history of skateboarding, from its surf board origins to its explosive rebirth in the mid-70s. Perralta (co-founder of skateboarding company Powell-Perralta) and his hometown cronies comprised ""Team Zephyr"" and helped revolutionize the ""sport"" of skateboarding. Told in vignettes scored with an incredible soundtrack of guitar rock (the music rights probably quintupled the flick's budget), DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS occasionally resembles a bigger budget ""Bones Brigade"" video. The form lends itself to fleshed-out chapters of information along with occasional skate breaks that highlight the poetry of the sport.The skating speaks for itself and calls attention to the narration of Sean Penn who trips over the overwrought prose of writer Craig Stecyk. Far too often, Penn sounds like he's reading his Ninth Grade term paper on skateboarding.Perralta's film moves at a good clip, only bogging down towards the end with long-winded vignettes focusing on he and two of his other Dogtown chums. Yet, at no time does DOGTOWN AND Z BOYS ever wear out its welcome.

But when the amateur filmmaker is documenting a moment in history for which he was actually involved, he can be forgiven. Stacy Peralta was one of the members of the Zephyr skating team, the subject of the film, and Dogtown and Z-Boys was his attempt to document the time when skateboarding went from being something that amused junior high school kids with too much time on their hands to being a serious sport. The problem, of course, being that the natures of the members of the Zephyr team, not to mention its co-founders, wasn't exactly germane to the codification of, well, anything.Los Angeles in the early seventies: poor, territorial surfers with a lot of time on their hands discover skateboards. Previously considered toys, skateboards seemed a natural extension of the surfers' ethic; an oblong board with which one could perform. The skateboard companies were in the midst of attempting to get skateboarding noticed and televised; teams were put together for competition purposes. Two surf shop owners decide to put together a team from the anarchic, dysfunctional Dogtown scene (of which film narrator Sean Penn was a minor member himself). The Dogtown kids, who eventually became known as the Z-Boys, stood in opposition in every way to the clean-cut teams of skateboarders usually seen in competitions--not only in their style (considered outrageous at the time, now almost stereotypical in period movies and the like of the ""seventies style""), but also in their ability. No one had ever considered doing things on skateboards that these kids were doing. They soon rocketed to the top of their game, but almost inevitably, the fame exacerbated existing problems, and everything exploded.Peralta takes a straightforward, if understandably biased, approach to the subject matter, and his intimate knowledge of both the events and the motivations, stuff that no one outside the crew would have had access to, makes this a fascinating story, even for those of us who were never interested in skateboard culture. (I was a little punk like everyone else, but I barely have enough balance to ride a bike. Skateboard? Not on your life.) I don't think it even matters if you have any idea that Dogtown is a slang term for a part of LA, or who the Z-Boys were; you'll like this. ****",4,Insider's perspective makes this one worth watching.,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2421,"['Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', '2001', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'suffers', 'one', 'names', 'screams', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'when', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'documenting', 'moment', 'history', 'was', 'actually', 'involved', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'was', 'one', 'members', 'Zephyr', 'skating', 'team', 'subject', 'film', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'was', 'attempt', 'document', 'time', 'when', 'skateboarding', 'went', 'being', 'something', 'amused', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'being', 'serious', 'sport', 'problem', 'course', 'being', 'natures', 'members', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'not', 'mention', 'co-founders', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'germane', 'codification', 'well', 'anything.Los', 'Angeles', 'early', 'seventies', 'poor', 'territorial', 'surfers', 'lot', 'time', 'hands', 'discover', 'skateboards', 'Previously', 'considered', 'toys', 'skateboards', 'seemed', 'natural', 'extension', 'surfers', 'ethic', 'oblong', 'board', 'one', 'could', 'perform', 'skateboard', 'companies', 'were', 'midst', 'attempting', 'get', 'skateboarding', 'noticed', 'televised', 'teams', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'competition', 'purposes', 'Two', 'surf', 'shop', 'owners', 'decide', 'put', 'together', 'team', 'anarchic', 'dysfunctional', 'Dogtown', 'scene', 'film', 'narrator', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'minor', 'member', 'Dogtown', 'kids', 'who', 'eventually', 'became', 'known', 'Z-Boys', 'stood', 'opposition', 'way', 'clean-cut', 'teams', 'skateboarders', 'usually', 'seen', 'competitions', 'not', 'only', 'style', 'considered', 'outrageous', 'time', 'now', 'almost', 'stereotypical', 'period', 'movies', 'like', 'seventies', 'style', 'also', 'ability', 'one', 'had', 'ever', 'considered', 'doing', 'things', 'skateboards', 'kids', 'were', 'doing', 'soon', 'rocketed', 'top', 'game', 'almost', 'inevitably', 'fame', 'exacerbated', 'existing', 'problems', 'everything', 'exploded.Peralta', 'straightforward', 'understandably', 'biased', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'events', 'motivations', 'stuff', 'one', 'crew', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'access', 'fascinating', 'story', 'even', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'interested', 'skateboard', 'culture', 'was', 'little', 'punk', 'everyone', 'else', 'barely', 'have', 'enough', 'balance', 'ride', 'bike', 'Skateboard', 'Not', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'matters', 'have', 'idea', 'Dogtown', 'slang', 'term', 'part', 'LA', 'who', 'Z-Boys', 'were', ""'ll"", 'like', '****']",N/A

Once the cat was out of the bag, the world could never go back.  Equally important was the early promotion of the sport and the lifestyle, of which the writer/director was an early pioneer. He was also a member of the Z-boys, which provides a perspective that no one else could deliver.

Sean Penn is the perfect narrator for skateboarding legend Stacey Peralta's true story about a gang of discarded Venice (CA) kids who revolutionized skateboarding and transformed the culture.  In the late 60s and early 70s, skateboarding had gone the way of the Hula-Hoop. And then polyurethane wheels, hi-tech bearings, custom trucks and laminated, curved, surfboard-shaped platforms were custom rigged. And the sport exploded with an aggressive style, awe inspiring moves and intimidating, sometimes cynical, street smarts.  This is an affectionate, irreverent look back by the guys who lived and loved it.  FRUIT OF THE VINE is an even better film, also nominally about skateboarding. This wonderful vintage footage, shot on Super-8 is dirty, raw, disrespectful and anarchic.  At its heart, it's about breaking into private property, cleaning out refuse-filled but otherwise empty swimming pools, and using the tempting concave shells for practicing blissful wall-riding stunts that often end in bone crunching crashes and torn flesh. It's very tribal: enemy territory is claimed and marked, then daring tests of manhood, repetitive, almost trance-inducing coming of age rituals are performed that inevitably involve blood-letting.

As a 50 year old who grew up in Southern California in the mid-60s skateboarding in the ""uncool"" manner that they portrayed in the first skateboard tournament, I was absolutely mesmerized by the evolution to vertical skateboarder, ie, ""airtime"".This film narrated by Sean Penn interviews the members of the Zephyr Surf Shop skateboarding team from the 70s.  Sean Penn does an excellent job as voice over and the teammates and shop owners are very honest and forthright in sharing the evolution through the skateboarding where they were first seen, to the urban guerilla boarding in empty swimming pools, to skateboard stardom, and finally to grown-ups.Many reviewers mention the braggadocio of the participants since the director was also a Z-Boy.  Also many complained that they were just a bunch of skateboarders.  But I didn't view it that way at all.  I found their reporting to be very balanced and in fact, I thought the director somewhat downplayed his stature in the skateboarding world vs. say, Tony Alva.  Also as a former skateboarder of a previous generation, I found it absolutely fascinating watching the evolution of the sport.  Whether true or not, following that evolution to airborne makes fascinating history.  Now, skateboard/wakeboard/surfing/in-line skating have merged into extreme sports.  Did these guys invent it?

I bought this video simply because one of students in my English class said how cool the film was, and I just checked it out to see if I can use the film in my class.  The result turned out more engaging than I expected, and &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; is pretty awesome documentary for those who are interested in the hot summer of 1970s.&quot;Dogtown&quot; follows the rise of local youth, hanging around the beach of Santa Monica in the 70s.  Around that time, once prospered amusement park by the seaside had been long deserted, and the seaside area had become a place for local surfers.  They made the rule of &quot;only locals&quot; which means, you cannot mess around the place, just coming from outside the town.And after their dangerously exciting surfing in the sea (among the ruined piles), they spent time doing another thing: skateboarding.  While doing that for fun, they gradually developed the style, making it their own.  Finally, taking advantage of unused swimming pools (that means, trespassing, of course), the boys (though, actually, the original members include a girl) went on to set a new style, using the edge of the pool, which, according to the film, led to today's vertical ride of skateboarding.  They become famous; they become cultural icons.  (One of them appears as a cameo in original TV series &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; as, who else, a skateboarder; this brief scene is also included in the film.)  In short, they set the style.You must face it; the film sounds like self-advertizing at times.  But still, &quot;Z-Boys&quot; gives very interesting information on skateboarding, which by the end of the 20th century has become one of the independent category of sports (you will see, for instance, the difference between skateboarding in Jan and Dean era, and the Boys' own style).  The original skatebording footages are also noteworthy, which, with all its faded color and shaky camerawork, telescope the free spirits of the 70s into the exciting moments of their skateboarding practice or contests.The film is also unusual in that the director himself appears before the camera, giving his own interview of the film.  This kind of attitude would invite criticism of the film's taking unbalanced view.  But they somehow get away with it, probably because it is clear that they love the sports, and really want to say something about it.&quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; lets you look at the world of street culture of the 70s West Coast in a quite unique way, and anyone who is interested in this sort of thing should watch it, whether or not he/she has ever experienced skateboarding.  The film ends with the reports of the original members' life today, many of whom seem to have settled down, and leading a family life.  That is most interesting, you might say.Sean Penn (who was one of the fans of the &quot;Boys&quot;) provides narration, but I wish he too gave his own account of the boys.  And it seems some part of the film is missing -- I want to know whether or not they ever got injured; what they were doing in the 80s and 90s, and so on, but perhaps it is not our business after all.
