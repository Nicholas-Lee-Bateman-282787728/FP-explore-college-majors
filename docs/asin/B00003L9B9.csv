Well I think they need to understand the stories are just tall tales (That means the stories are made up). The stories are really cool to me. My favourite stores are probatly ""Duncan gets spooked"", ""Stepney gets lost"" & ""Rusty & the boulder"". I also like ""Haunted Henry"".But, did you know that the engine who falls off the bridge in""Duncan gets spooked"" was acctually played by Skarloey?

Actually, this one was so terrible that I even feel bad giving it one star. The Stories are:Toby's Dicovery  C:This story starts out all happy when Toby and Sir Topham Hatt are trying to find a lost castle. They also find a mine near the castle and Sir Topham Hatt decides to put the mine back in business. But at night the mine looks very scary at night, at least to Toby it does. Soon enough Toby sees an engine that he thinks is a ghost.Rusty and the Boulder  F:Okay here are the highlights of the story, I boulder, with a mind of it's own starts rolling around the Island of Sodor, Yawn. This is probably the WORST THOMAS STORY OF ALL TIME!Duncan Gets Spooked  B:One of the better ones on this video. Duncan's driver and fireman play a trick on him while crossing the old iron bridge. Duncan soon thinks that he sees the ghost engine that fell of the bridge in an old legend.Stepney Gets Lost  F:Another awful story. Stepney gets lost while going home from a long day of pulling freight cars and, after taking an wrong turn, he finds himself in the scrap yard. His old enimies, Arry and Burt, take him to the incinerator to be turned in to scrap iron. But then Sir Topham Hatt saves Stepney and he is able to go home after all.Haunted Henry  A:The best one on this video. Edward tells Henry about the ghosts that come out at night one the old railway. Henry refuses to believe Edward, but when he travels on the old railway that same night, he sees something that might be a ghost.Sir Topham Hatt's Holiday  C:Sir Topham Hatt and his family go on a holiday. But Sir Topham Hatt encounters some problems and his holiday is ruined until Thomas helps him out.Again, not a very good Thomas video and I wouldn't recommend it.",1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!(4 out of 10),1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,1961,"['Okay', 'so', 'guess', 'stories', 'one', 'tape', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'scary', 'ghost', 'engine', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'scrap', 'yard', 'think', 'should', 'just', 'stick', 'regular', 'Thomas', 'stories', 'how', 'could', 'Thomas', 'possibly', 'be', 'scary', 'Actually', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'even', 'feel', 'bad', 'giving', 'one', 'star', 'Stories', 'are', 'Toby', 'Dicovery', 'C', 'story', 'out', 'happy', 'when', 'Toby', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'lost', 'castle', 'also', 'find', 'mine', 'castle', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'put', 'mine', 'back', 'business', 'night', 'mine', 'very', 'scary', 'night', 'least', 'Toby', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Toby', 'engine', 'ghost.Rusty', 'Boulder', 'F', 'Okay', 'here', 'are', 'highlights', 'story', 'boulder', 'mind', 'own', 'starts', 'rolling', 'Island', 'Sodor', 'Yawn', 'probably', 'WORST', 'THOMAS', 'STORY', 'ALL', 'TIME', 'Duncan', 'Gets', 'Spooked', 'B', 'One', 'better', 'ones', 'video', 'Duncan', 'driver', 'fireman', 'play', 'trick', 'crossing', 'old', 'iron', 'bridge', 'Duncan', 'soon', 'ghost', 'engine', 'fell', 'bridge', 'old', 'legend.Stepney', 'Lost', 'F', 'awful', 'story', 'Stepney', 'lost', 'going', 'home', 'long', 'day', 'pulling', 'freight', 'cars', 'taking', 'wrong', 'turn', 'scrap', 'yard', 'old', 'enimies', 'Arry', 'Burt', 'take', 'incinerator', 'be', 'turned', 'scrap', 'iron', 'then', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'Stepney', 'able', 'go', 'home', 'all.Haunted', 'Henry', 'best', 'one', 'video', 'Edward', 'Henry', 'ghosts', 'come', 'out', 'night', 'one', 'old', 'railway', 'Henry', 'believe', 'Edward', 'when', 'old', 'railway', 'same', 'night', 'something', 'might', 'be', 'ghost.Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'Holiday', 'C', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'family', 'go', 'holiday', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'problems', 'holiday', 'ruined', 'Thomas', 'out.Again', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Thomas', 'video', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend']",N/A

545263,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B00003L9B9,Mr. Bey,"[2, 6]",This is probaly the 2nd or 3rd Alec Baldwin tape there was and I thought he did a okay job. It wasn't really that scary.My sister has been much more scared in Percy's Ghostly Trick or in Thomas Percy and the Dragon. I wouldn't not give this tape to anyone because it's not that scary. I think their now makiing Stepney the Blubell Engine from Austraila. And it the books Stepney's not even the Fat Controler's engine. And when he was first introduced in the tapes he wan't Sir Topam Hat's either. Just because their's a new narrator doesn't mean they should forget the old stuff. I thought Rusty and the Boulder was pretty good but I wish Thumper was used more often. He was in only one.
