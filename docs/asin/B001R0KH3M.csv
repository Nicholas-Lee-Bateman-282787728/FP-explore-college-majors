1232356,A2X449RA8YXYIB,B001R0KH3M,A. E. Pagano,"[1, 1]","I agree that the lack of a live performance of Stevie on DVD unitl now is inexcusable for both Motown and for Stevie. Stevie like so many artists of his age group has become somewhat complacent about new material not to mention the new mediums to express and expose themselves to both new and old audiences. That being said this performance is great but not without some real editing and sound issues. There are times when Stevie's (who I believe is supposed to be the star of this performance) keyboards are no where in the mix. The same applies to other performers during the course of the video. While I like the notion of seeing a concert as it was performed, Stevie for all his genius can be a rambler verbally and musically and ""songs"" like the gospel rave-up with the audience, the ""talk- box"" medley of beatles and Stylistic tunes could have been easily edited from the video as as far as I'm concerned the performance too. This is Stevie Wonder the quintessential American songwriter resorting to gimmicks. While you get alot of Stevie's greatest hits there are some glaring omissions. There is not sinlge tune from ""Fulfillingness 1st Finale"", but he does inlcude ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" the worst tune he's ever written. The band is absolutely awesome and his decision really feature them on Chick Corea's ""Spain"" was a wise and rewarding decision. His daughter while an adequate vocalist is in water way over her head as a featured soloist especially on the demanding tune he or she chose. Yes I recommend this whole heartedly because whatelse is out there to document Stevie in a live performance. Next time Stevie hire and editor and soemone with ears to do the final mix.",4,At Last,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1696,"['agree', 'lack', 'live', 'performance', 'Stevie', 'DVD', 'unitl', 'now', 'inexcusable', 'Motown', 'Stevie', 'Stevie', 'so', 'many', 'artists', 'age', 'group', 'become', 'somewhat', 'complacent', 'new', 'material', 'not', 'mention', 'new', 'mediums', 'express', 'expose', 'new', 'old', 'audiences', 'being', 'said', 'performance', 'great', 'not', 'real', 'editing', 'sound', 'issues', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Stevie', 'who', 'believe', 'supposed', 'be', 'star', 'performance', 'keyboards', 'are', 'where', 'mix', 'same', 'applies', 'other', 'performers', 'course', 'video', 'like', 'notion', 'seeing', 'concert', 'was', 'performed', 'Stevie', 'genius', 'can', 'be', 'rambler', 'verbally', 'musically', 'songs', 'gospel', 'rave-up', 'audience', 'talk-', 'box', 'medley', 'beatles', 'Stylistic', 'tunes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'edited', 'video', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'performance', 'too', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'quintessential', 'American', 'songwriter', 'resorting', 'gimmicks', 'get', 'Stevie', 'greatest', 'hits', 'are', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'not', 'sinlge', 'tune', 'Fulfillingness', '1st', 'Finale', 'inlcude', 'Just', 'Called', 'Say', 'Love', 'worst', 'tune', 'ever', 'written', 'band', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'decision', 'really', 'feature', 'Chick', 'Corea', 'Spain', 'was', 'wise', 'rewarding', 'decision', 'daughter', 'adequate', 'vocalist', 'water', 'way', 'head', 'featured', 'soloist', 'especially', 'demanding', 'tune', 'chose', 'Yes', 'recommend', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'whatelse', 'out', 'there', 'document', 'Stevie', 'live', 'performance', 'Next', 'time', 'Stevie', 'hire', 'editor', 'soemone', 'ears', 'do', 'final', 'mix']",N/A

1232358,AL9P13WB6L9PQ,B001R0KH3M,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I saw portions of this concert on PBS and enjoyed it so much I went on line to Amazon and discovered it's available, thankfully, in Blu-Ray. (I say ""thankfully"" because they're not enough quality concerts on Blu-Ray yet, in my opinion.)Anyway here's the ""skinny"" on this Blu-Ray:1. The concert I think was fabulous. Stevie's been around so many decades that he can sing song after song of big hits. As a result many in the audience know the lyrics and ""sing along"". Stevie at times significantly encourages this: even letting the crowd sing the first stanza to a couple songs at least. I read the other reviewers' comments. I don't understand the criticism of hearing the crowd sing along. I mean, to my way of thinking, if you want pristine ""sound"" sans crowd then don't buy a ""live album"". Buy the CD or download the music. If I want to go to, see, a CONCERT, however, I want it to be a concert experience (sans, of course, the part about not seeing the stage due to everyone standing or arena view issues)! This means, I WANT to hear the crowd sing along at times. I want to hear the gaffs, coughs, the cheers, the applause!  I'd give this concert an A.2. The video quality is excellent, but not 1080p quality. It says 1080i, but to my way of thinking, more like 720. It even has a ""film/grainy"" look at times. Not bad, but this isn't anything like the quality of Planet Earth or Avatar. I'd give the video quality a C+, for Blu-Ray. If it were DVD, I'd rate it B+ or A-.3. The audio quality is in three choices: the Default seems to be LPCM 2.0, which is VERY GOOD. The other choices are Dolby 5.1 (not as good) and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. I've listened to all three. The LPCM manages to quieten the crowd and external noises quite a bit. This emphasizes Stevie and Band a bit at the expense of crowd. However the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 blows me away. I mean, I could really think I was ""there"". I hear things, including in the music, I just can't hear otherwise. You can ""really"" hear the crowd. I give this AUDIO an A.Conclusion: For ME, I think this Blu-Ray disc with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 turned on is the BEST true to life concert experience I've yet had in my home. But I love concerts, loud music, music of all kinds, and I could easily see that many might think the somewhat subdued LPCM 2.0 default setting is better for them. With an A for Concert, C+ for Video, A for Audio, overall it's an A-.",5,One of the best concerts on Blu-Ray?,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2417,"['saw', 'portions', 'concert', 'PBS', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'went', 'line', 'Amazon', 'discovered', 'available', 'thankfully', 'Blu-Ray', 'say', 'thankfully', ""'re"", 'not', 'enough', 'quality', 'concerts', 'Blu-Ray', 'yet', 'opinion', 'Anyway', 'here', 'skinny', 'Blu-Ray:1', 'concert', 'think', 'was', 'fabulous', 'Stevie', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'can', 'sing', 'song', 'song', 'big', 'hits', 'result', 'many', 'audience', 'know', 'lyrics', 'sing', 'Stevie', 'times', 'significantly', 'even', 'letting', 'crowd', 'sing', 'first', 'stanza', 'couple', 'songs', 'least', 'read', 'other', 'reviewers', 'comments', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'criticism', 'hearing', 'crowd', 'sing', 'mean', 'way', 'thinking', 'want', 'pristine', 'sound', 'sans', 'crowd', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'live', 'album', 'Buy', 'CD', 'download', 'music', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'CONCERT', 'however', 'want', 'be', 'concert', 'experience', 'sans', 'course', 'part', 'not', 'seeing', 'stage', 'due', 'everyone', 'standing', 'arena', 'view', 'issues', 'WANT', 'hear', 'crowd', 'sing', 'along', 'times', 'want', 'hear', 'gaffs', 'coughs', 'cheers', 'applause', ""'d"", 'give', 'concert', 'A.2', 'video', 'quality', 'excellent', 'not', '1080p', 'quality', '1080i', 'way', 'thinking', 'more', '720', 'even', 'film/grainy', 'look', 'times', 'Not', 'bad', ""n't"", 'anything', 'quality', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'Avatar', ""'d"", 'give', 'video', 'quality', 'C+', 'Blu-Ray', 'were', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'rate', 'B+', 'A-.3', 'audio', 'quality', 'three', 'choices', 'Default', 'be', 'LPCM', '2.0', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'other', 'choices', 'are', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'three', 'LPCM', 'quieten', 'crowd', 'external', 'noises', 'quite', 'bit', 'Stevie', 'Band', 'bit', 'expense', 'crowd', 'However', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'blows', 'away', 'mean', 'could', 'really', 'think', 'was', 'there', 'hear', 'things', 'including', 'music', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'otherwise', 'can', 'really', 'hear', 'crowd', 'give', 'AUDIO', 'A.Conclusion', 'ME', 'think', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'turned', 'BEST', 'true', 'life', 'concert', 'experience', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'had', 'home', 'love', 'concerts', 'loud', 'music', 'music', 'kinds', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'many', 'might', 'think', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'LPCM', '2.0', 'default', 'setting', 'better', 'A', 'Concert', 'C+', 'Video', 'A', 'Audio', 'overall', 'A-']",N/A
1232359,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B001R0KH3M,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[1, 1]","Over the years there have been precious few DVD's of any sort on the subject of Stevie Wonder,one of my favorite all time musicians. Even though this come somewhat late in his career this live presentation is certainly a treat. Sure a lot of us can nitpick that there's no DVD available of any of the concerts from the peak of his career but he makes this particular one a very all encompassing event. You'd expect Stevie,at this point in his career that he'd turn his concerts into big hit parades packed with nothing but songs everyone would know. Luckily Stevie Wonder also has gained fame as an album artist and,throughout his career much as with The Beatles many of his best known songs often didn't become hits. That is how Stevie presents himself here-as an almost unspeakably talented musician,singer and songwriter with a lot more to say to the people than what they might here on the radio. One big feature of this is that Stevie plays a handfull of songs from his often neglected 1980 albumHotter Than July. He even starts everything off with a song from that album in a stomping version of ""As If You Read My Mind"".From the same album he also performs ""Did I Hear You Say You Love Me"",""All I Do"",""Lately"" and ""Master Blaster"". Many of these songs might no be too familiar to Wonder fans but anyone who experiences this will feel as if they've been intimately involved with these songs forever. He really does make the Beatle connection with a ""uk medley"" mostly comprised of potent versions of Beatle songs. He's even joined by his grown daughter Aisha on the previously unheard ""I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out Of My Life"". In between many of these songs Stevie talks with the audience about keeping their inner eyes open to the joys and sorrows of the world and what can be done to improve upon some of the situations. Especially notable on this area is his intro to ""Visions"". Mindfull of blending old and new Stevie presents his 1972 funk classic ""Superstition"" with his recent hit ""So What The Fuss"" from his 2005 albumA Time To Love. It's amazing how with all the years seperating the songs how they fit so well together as if his career has come through another full circle and trust me;he's had many. Also notable is his version here of the Thom Bell written classic ""People Make The World Go 'Round"",an eerily beautiful song to begin with that is entirely keeping with Stevie's social vision for the people of the world. Seeing and hearing this man do his thing not only makes you feel like part of the audience itself but realize how his music and strong character can make you happy and think all at the same time. Not only will you come out of this having enjoyed an incredible live musical experience but also feel like a much better person for having experienced all of it.",5,Stevie AT LAST!!!!,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,2797,"['years', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'precious', 'few', 'DVD', 'sort', 'subject', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'one', 'favorite', 'time', 'musicians', 'Even', 'come', 'somewhat', 'late', 'career', 'live', 'presentation', 'certainly', 'treat', 'lot', 'can', 'nitpick', 'DVD', 'available', 'concerts', 'peak', 'career', 'particular', 'one', 'very', 'encompassing', 'event', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Stevie', 'point', 'career', ""'d"", 'turn', 'concerts', 'big', 'hit', 'parades', 'packed', 'nothing', 'songs', 'everyone', 'would', 'know', 'Luckily', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'also', 'gained', 'fame', 'album', 'artist', 'career', 'much', 'Beatles', 'many', 'best', 'known', 'songs', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'hits', 'how', 'Stevie', 'presents', 'here-as', 'almost', 'unspeakably', 'talented', 'musician', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'lot', 'more', 'say', 'people', 'what', 'might', 'here', 'radio', 'One', 'big', 'feature', 'Stevie', 'handfull', 'songs', 'often', 'neglected', '1980', 'albumHotter', 'Than', 'July', 'even', 'everything', 'off', 'song', 'album', 'stomping', 'version', 'Read', 'Mind', 'same', 'album', 'also', 'Did', 'Hear', 'Say', 'Love', 'Me', 'Do', 'Lately', 'Master', 'Blaster', 'Many', 'songs', 'might', 'no', 'be', 'too', 'familiar', 'Wonder', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intimately', 'involved', 'songs', 'forever', 'really', 'make', 'Beatle', 'connection', 'uk', 'medley', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'potent', 'versions', 'Beatle', 'songs', 'even', 'joined', 'grown', 'daughter', 'Aisha', 'previously', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Laugh', 'Right', 'Out', 'My', 'Life', 'many', 'songs', 'Stevie', 'talks', 'audience', 'keeping', 'inner', 'eyes', 'open', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'world', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'improve', 'situations', 'Especially', 'notable', 'area', 'intro', 'Visions', 'Mindfull', 'blending', 'old', 'new', 'Stevie', '1972', 'funk', 'classic', 'Superstition', 'recent', 'hit', 'So', 'What', 'Fuss', '2005', 'albumA', 'Time', 'Love', 'amazing', 'how', 'years', 'seperating', 'songs', 'how', 'fit', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'career', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'trust', 'had', 'many', 'Also', 'notable', 'version', 'here', 'Thom', 'Bell', 'written', 'classic', 'People', 'Make', 'World', 'Go', 'eerily', 'beautiful', 'song', 'begin', 'entirely', 'keeping', 'Stevie', 'social', 'vision', 'people', 'world', 'Seeing', 'hearing', 'man', 'do', 'thing', 'not', 'only', 'feel', 'part', 'audience', 'realize', 'how', 'music', 'strong', 'character', 'can', 'make', 'happy', 'think', 'same', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'will', 'come', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'incredible', 'live', 'musical', 'experience', 'also', 'feel', 'much', 'better', 'person', 'having', 'experienced']",N/A

In his performance, his songs felt dated and you know, in the hands of an more enthusiastic performance or performer, these songs are unarguably timeless!This is not the concert I wanna remember the man in.  Apparently, ""going down memory lane"" with a greatest hits premise has made the master's performance look even more tired.  His solo work was listless and uninspired (particularly the harmonica solo in his opening ""All Blues"" segment)  His band was/is capable, but they didn't seem to embody the music much, with the exception of the drummer, IMHO! (Often, it's a reoccurring danger for an seasoned act that has been around for 30+ years to do ""greatest hits"" tours: it doesn't take long before the act begin to look and sound like a covers band STARRING the original members.)Stevie's most recent record ""A Time For Love"" proved to me that he still had something to say musically, poetically and politically.  Perhaps he should retire from gigging publicly and do something he might really love doing at this point of his life.  Political activism, maybe? ;)(I'm definitely SO ready for him to publish his memoirs then get on the morning talk show circuit to support it. :))",2,It looked like he phoned in his performance,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1239,"['looked', 'bloated', 'tired', 'perhaps', 'little', 'melancholy', 'performance', 'songs', 'felt', 'dated', 'know', 'hands', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'performer', 'songs', 'are', 'unarguably', 'timeless', 'not', 'concert', 'wan', 'na', 'remember', 'man', 'Apparently', 'going', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'greatest', 'hits', 'premise', 'made', 'master', 'performance', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'tired', 'solo', 'work', 'was', 'listless', 'uninspired', 'particularly', 'harmonica', 'solo', 'opening', 'Blues', 'segment', 'band', 'was/is', 'capable', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'embody', 'music', 'much', 'exception', 'drummer', 'IMHO', 'Often', 'reoccurring', 'danger', 'seasoned', 'act', 'been', '30+', 'years', 'do', 'greatest', 'hits', 'tours', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'act', 'begin', 'look', 'sound', 'covers', 'band', 'STARRING', 'original', 'members', 'Stevie', 'most', 'recent', 'record', 'Time', 'Love', 'proved', 'still', 'had', 'something', 'say', 'musically', 'poetically', 'politically', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'retire', 'gigging', 'publicly', 'do', 'something', 'might', 'really', 'love', 'doing', 'point', 'life', 'Political', 'activism', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'SO', 'ready', 'publish', 'memoirs', 'then', 'get', 'morning', 'talk', 'show', 'circuit', 'support']",N/A

Recorded at the illustrious O2 arena in London, the clarity of this sensational live presentation penetrates and permeates throughout the entire DVD with enhanced Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and remarkable screen quality. Taking us on this exclusive 50-year musical journey, the genius of Stevie Wonder, with the strength of his band directed by bassist Nate Watts mellifluously leads the viewers on a series of highs! There are no low points on this album at all. Every song is the life of the party from beginning to the absolute end. The band and vocalists are phenomenal!! Keith John, Aisha Morris (Stevie's daughter), Dejah Gomez & Kimberly Brewer are having a wonderful time on the stage alongside the incredibly oozing guitar licks of Errol Cooney and Kyle Bolden, who meshed perfectly together on the Unity Melody of the song ""Visions""!! Vocally, Stevie is STILL the quintessential vocalist of our generation as well as the epitome of what timeless and tenacious musical craft is all about. I loved everything, including the cover of Miles Davis' ""All Blues"", the UK Medley where Stevie and his guitarists sing using talk boxes. They masterfully flow right into Thom Bell & Linda Creed's ""People Make The World Go 'Round."" Stanley Randolph & Fausto Cuevas put it down on drums and percussions! Fabulous! Overall, ""Wonder Summer's Night"" is so versatile and well-rounded. The quality is remarkable.

Held Jr. ""cheld""","[8, 13]","There ARE positives to this DVD - Stevie is in good voice, his band is very talented and it's clear they're having a heckuva good time.  The problems are the song selection and the pacing.  As others have noted, the setlist leans too heavily on slower and unfamiliar (Wonder hasn't had a Top 40 hit since 1987) numbers that get repetitive after a while.  When he does pull out the hits, they crackle for the most part (if the opening bass line of ""I Wish"" doesn't get your toes tapping you might want to check your pulse).  ""Visions"" from ""Innervisions"" is a nice surprising ""deep cut"" from his classic era, but where are ""That Girl"" or ""I Was Made To Love Her"" or ""You Haven't Done Nothin'"" (which could have been 'dedicated' to George W.

But whose complaining, I am glad to have this DVD at long last, maybe next time.",5,It's About Time,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,649,"['long', 'last', 'finally', 'DVD', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'am', 'well', 'pleased', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Stevie', 'singing', 'hits', 'esecially', 'good', 'one', 'favorites', 'Lately', 'vocals', 'really', 'shine', 'daughter', 'Aiesha', 'song', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'good', 'job', 'band', 'good', 'solid', 'play', 'high', 'level', 'energy', 'making', 'must', 'have', 'purchase', 'anybody', 'Stevie', 'music.One', 'disappointment', 'are', 'extras', 'backstage', 'interviews', 'had', 'included', 'old', 'footage', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'package', 'complaining', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'DVD', 'long', 'last', 'maybe', 'next', 'time']",N/A

This is perfect for people like me who are physically unable to make the concerts in person due to others standing during most of the concert and blocking the view from those of us who are unable to stand. I wish other R&B;/soul artist would consider doing this.This dvd gives you shots from all angles! Close ups you wouldn't see at the actual concert. I'm thankful that I did see Stevie at least 3 times when I was younger and physically able. Stevie is an artist who gives you your moneys worth! Being from the old school, THERE'S NO LIP-SYNCHING and REAL music!!! Now, with this dvd, I can see and hear him in concert mode as often as I wish!
