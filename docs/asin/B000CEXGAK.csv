It's just a movie, and if you start to think of the historical inaccuracies you might become very frustrated. Some examples are (don't worry, no real spoilers)*Keep in mind, this movie takes place in 18501) Abraham Lincoln appeared at the end - (Lincoln was president 1861-1865)2) There is some talk of the Confederacy - (Confederacy was formed in 18613) General Bouregard meets an untimely demise - (He died in 1893)Have fun and find more on your own.If you like light, easy to watch movies - buyIf you like light movies but don't want to buy unless it's great - rentIf you want serious - don't watchIf you can't stand historical inaccuracies - forget you heard about this movie.",4,Fun to Watch If Relaxed,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,1180,"['Antonio', 'Banderas', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'not', 'mention', 'prowess', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'so', 'knew', 'start', 'was', 'good', 'chance', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'beginning', 'action', 'sword', 'fighting', 'running', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'unrealistic', 'thought', 'enjoyable', 'watch.It', 'not', 'deepest', 'drama', 'action', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'just', 'fine', 'go', 'movie', 'more', 'easy-to-watch', 'action/comedy.When', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'please', 'be', 'relaxed', 'just', 'movie', 'start', 'think', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'might', 'become', 'very', 'frustrated', 'examples', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'real', 'spoilers', '*Keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'place', '18501', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'appeared', 'end', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'president', '1861-1865', '2', 'talk', 'Confederacy', 'Confederacy', 'was', 'formed', '18613', 'General', 'Bouregard', 'untimely', 'demise', 'died', '1893', 'Have', 'fun', 'find', 'more', 'own.If', 'light', 'easy', 'watch', 'movies', 'buyIf', 'light', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'great', 'rentIf', 'want', 'serious', 'do', ""n't"", 'watchIf', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'forget', 'heard', 'movie']",N/A

I am a bitter, minority-American agnostic, and even *I* think the white-Christian bashing shtick is getting extremely, extremely tired.  ""The Lord's Work"" equals nothing but killing and driving out those of ""impure race"" for $$$ profit???  No wonder the conservatives are upset.  It's insulting and it's a lazy shorthand for ""villain."" Oh, but why give him motives and characteristics when you can give him a catchphrase?  Jeeze.  And sorry, ""Legend of Zorro,"" but you are nowhere near deep enough to have earned the right to take on THAT topic.A new plot device, please?(The film also chooses to utterly ignore the fact that there is no divorce in the Catholic church, which is jarring.)This sequel doesn't have the sparkle or chemistry of the original -- too many stock jokes and cliched ""married"" fighting. Zorro's inner journey isn't nearly as interesting this time around, much more sitcom-y.  The kid is a gem, though (even if his scenes require an amazing level of suspension-of-disbelief.  And if my kid behaved like that in school I would punish his disrespectful little tail -- I don't care if Daddy's a legendary populist hero.  I know and am related to enough teachers to realize that that is Not Funny -- the teacher is trying to teach, and using him as the allegorical stand-in for the oppressive government comes off as silly and over-the-top).If you're into nonstop, breakneck action scenes, this will be somewhat enjoyable (although if you are into that sort of thing you're not going to be happy with the level of the special effects -- shouldn't we be better at hiding the green-screen by now?)  If you like your action scenes to make sense (sweetie, ""hide in the cellar with the baby"" does NOT mean sneak out the back to beat on the bad guys, subsequently leaving your infant in a flaming trough so Zorro can rescue it dramatically while everything explodes, and why is your barn exploding anyway, you raising dynamite with that corn??) and advance the plot, you will not be quite so happy. There's some fun stuff with the horse, although a movie this length and with this level of star power should rely on animals and cute kids far less.Something else that has been bothering me for some time -- I'm a modern woman, and for campy fun, I'm all over Xena and Buffy and women who can kick some @$$.  But this rash of female characters who are excellent fighters FOR NO APPARENT REASON is disturbing to me a bit, because this is not reflective of reality and it's a little dangerous to get people complacent about thinking it is.  It is one thing when your heroine is magic, or has trained for aeons, or is some kind of genetically altered thing. But regular, everyday, untrained, average-sized women cannot spontaneously beat up five men (I am not referring to Zeta-Jones here). Which is why we should all take martial arts/self-defense classes, end of PSA :-).  A throwaway line would suffice. ""My parents trained me for years"" or ""I grew up on this harsh frontier"" -- something!All in all, not very subtle, and its portrayal of history is not exactly accurate (but you weren't expecting that, were you), and really doesn't make much sense. This one would not suffer from a viewing on video or TV (although I'm willing to allow that Catherine Zeta-Jones' heaving, corseted bosom is probably that much more impressive when it's 20 feet high. And any chance to see Banderas I cannot call a complete waste :-) Yum).  It's amusing on the level of ""Wild Wild West,"" but as with that film (and even accounting for my Banderas-love), I could have spent my time more profitably doing something else.",3,"Mediocre, but a few nice laughs.

That's impossible if the original was set, as it claimed to be, in 1846, because the very beginning of this installment sets it in 1850, just as the inhabitants of California are voting on whether to accept the new state Constitution.  And as the movie goes on, it keeps on getting confuseder and confuseder, with mention of the Confederacy and its army (neither existed till early 1861), croquet (which wasn't imported to the US till c. 1863), Henry rifles (not introduced till c. 1860), polo (not imported till the '80's), the Pinkertons (established 1850) operating for the Government (they didn't start doing that till Lincoln was elected), a railroad in California (I don't think there were any till later that decade), and ""bathrooms"" for toilets (the term simply wasn't used that way till indoor plumbing became common in the '80's and '90's).  There's also an assertion that the people of California were ""poor"" (by 1850 the Gold Rush was booming), and several of the American bad guys use swords (something Americans had pretty much ceased to do around the 1830's).  Still, the wild plot and wonderful fight scenes go a long way toward making up for all of this.  Alejandro has promised Elena he'll give up the mask once the US government is in a position to defend the rights of the people, but Zorro has become so much a part of who he is that he can't bring himself to do it.  Before he knows what's happening, Elena has served him with divorce papers (and would a good Catholic girl have done that back then?).  This leads him to embark on a three-month binge, but when he learns that Elena is being courted by a French newcomer (Rufus Sewell), it leads him to some startling revelations, and soon the Fox is riding again.Besides its gymnastic sword fights (it's clear that the director was familiar with Richard Lester's exuberantThe Complete Musketeers (The Three Musketeers / The Four Musketeers)), Elena's spitfire modernity (which modern feamle viewers will like), and a really slimy villain (Nick Chunlund as Jacob McGivens, a sadistic hypocrite who isn't described as a nativist--a species very common at that time--but clearly is one), the plot offers Alejandro and Elena's young son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso), who idolizes Zorro and has even mastered some of his moves, and the ""Knights of Aragon,"" a secret society said to be ""the power behind all the kings in Europe,"" who fear that America threatens their supremacy and are plotting to bring her down with tactics that will resonate nicely with old viewers ofThe Wild Wild West: The Complete Series.  As with its predecessor, then, the best thing to do is assume that everything is going on in an alternate Universe (and that the ""1850"" in the opening crawl is a typo), and just sit back and enjoy the fireworks (literal and figurative).",4,"Mangled history, bewildering continuity, splendid swashbuckling",1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,3244,"['supposedly', 'sequel', 'toThe', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'feature', 'two', 'same', 'characters', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'former', 'Alejandro', 'Murieta', 'now', 'known', 'Alejandro', 'la', 'Vega', 'perhaps', 'Don', 'Diego', 'adopted', 'perhaps', 'took', 'wife', 'name', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'wife', 'Elena', 'run', 'more', 'hour', 'up', 'when', 'Elena', 'Alejandro', 'been', 'Zorro', '10', 'years', 'impossible', 'original', 'was', 'set', 'claimed', 'be', '1846', 'very', 'beginning', 'installment', '1850', 'just', 'inhabitants', 'California', 'are', 'voting', 'accept', 'new', 'state', 'Constitution', 'movie', 'getting', 'confuseder', 'confuseder', 'mention', 'Confederacy', 'army', 'existed', 'till', 'early', '1861', 'croquet', 'was', ""n't"", 'imported', 'US', 'till', 'c.', '1863', 'Henry', 'rifles', 'not', 'introduced', 'c.', '1860', 'polo', 'not', 'imported', ""'80"", 'Pinkertons', 'established', '1850', 'operating', 'Government', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'doing', 'till', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'elected', 'railroad', 'California', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'till', 'later', 'decade', 'bathrooms', 'toilets', 'term', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'way', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'became', 'common', ""'80"", ""'90"", 'also', 'assertion', 'people', 'California', 'were', 'poor', '1850', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'was', 'booming', 'several', 'American', 'bad', 'guys', 'use', 'swords', 'something', 'Americans', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'ceased', 'do', '1830', 'Still', 'wild', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'fight', 'scenes', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'up', 'Alejandro', 'promised', 'Elena', ""'ll"", 'give', 'up', 'mask', 'US', 'government', 'position', 'defend', 'rights', 'people', 'Zorro', 'become', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'what', 'happening', 'Elena', 'served', 'divorce', 'papers', 'would', 'good', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'have', 'done', 'back', 'then', 'embark', 'three-month', 'binge', 'when', 'Elena', 'being', 'courted', 'French', 'newcomer', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'startling', 'revelations', 'soon', 'Fox', 'riding', 'gymnastic', 'sword', 'fights', 'clear', 'director', 'was', 'familiar', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'exuberantThe', 'Complete', 'Musketeers', 'Three', 'Musketeers', '/', 'Four', 'Musketeers', 'Elena', 'spitfire', 'modernity', 'modern', 'feamle', 'viewers', 'will', 'like', 'really', 'slimy', 'villain', 'Nick', 'Chunlund', 'Jacob', 'McGivens', 'sadistic', 'hypocrite', 'who', ""n't"", 'described', 'nativist', 'species', 'very', 'common', 'time', 'clearly', 'one', 'plot', 'Alejandro', 'Elena', 'young', 'son', 'Joaquin', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'who', 'Zorro', 'even', 'mastered', 'moves', 'Knights', 'Aragon', 'secret', 'society', 'said', 'be', 'power', 'kings', 'Europe', 'who', 'fear', 'America', 'supremacy', 'are', 'plotting', 'bring', 'down', 'tactics', 'will', 'resonate', 'nicely', 'old', 'viewers', 'ofThe', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Complete', 'Series', 'predecessor', 'then', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'assume', 'everything', 'going', 'alternate', 'Universe', '1850', 'opening', 'crawl', 'typo', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'fireworks', 'literal', 'figurative']",N/A

The film was notable for two other reasons- first, it was a very good film, even considering it was in the action-superhero vein, and two, it was America's introduction to the almost flawlessly gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones, a co-winner of the female genetic perfection sweepstakes, along with Halle Berry.Since that film, Jones has become a household name with her films, marriage to Michael Douglas, and an Oscar nomination. The rest of the Zorro crowd has not fared as well, and this 2005 sequel, The Legend Of Zorro, set a decade after the first film, is only a so-so follow up....If only the film had taken more advantage of the seven year hiatus. After all, it's not like they rushed a sequel into production. Yet, that's exactly what this film feels like, despite its good fun. Overall, I can give this film a marginal recommendation, especially as family fare, but I suspect that there will be no more sequels, at least not with Banderas and Jones, in this franchise's future.",2,Not good,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,1203,"['Mask', 'Zorro', 'was', '1998', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'saw', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', '19th', 'Century', 'Mexican-American', 'superhero', 'Zorro', 'Don', 'Alejandro', 'la', 'Vega', 'film', 'was', 'notable', 'two', 'other', 'reasons-', 'first', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'considering', 'was', 'action-superhero', 'vein', 'two', 'was', 'America', 'introduction', 'almost', 'flawlessly', 'gorgeous', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'co-winner', 'female', 'genetic', 'perfection', 'sweepstakes', 'Halle', 'Berry.Since', 'film', 'Jones', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'films', 'marriage', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'rest', 'Zorro', 'crowd', 'not', 'fared', 'as', 'well', '2005', 'sequel', 'Legend', 'Zorro', 'set', 'decade', 'first', 'film', 'only', 'so-so', 'follow', 'up', 'only', 'film', 'had', 'taken', 'more', 'advantage', 'seven', 'year', 'hiatus', 'not', 'rushed', 'sequel', 'production', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'feels', 'good', 'fun', 'Overall', 'can', 'give', 'film', 'marginal', 'recommendation', 'especially', 'family', 'fare', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'sequels', 'least', 'not', 'Banderas', 'Jones', 'franchise', 'future']",N/A
958524,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000CEXGAK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 7]","The Legend of Zorro is actually a great movie, one which I never expected to be so thoroughly entertaining.  I would have been content just looking at Catherine Zeta-Jones for a couple of hours, but this is a swashbuckling good time from beginning to end.  Sure, it stretches credulity at times and plays fast and loose with American history, but it succeeds admirably in its purpose to capture the viewer's imagination and show him/her one wild, action-packed adventure.  I must admit I haven't seen The Mask of Zorro, nor have I seen more than bits and pieces of old Zorro shows and movies over the years, so I can't put any of this in a proper Zorro context.  All I can do is tell you how much I liked the movie - and why.You can't complain about a weak or nonexistent storyline here, as The Legend of Zorro is packed to the gills with story; not counting the credits, the movie runs a good two hours, but it really doesn't seem that long - largely because the story never pauses long enough to start dragging.  There's always a dichotomy somewhere in the mind of any masked hero, and a ""when you come to a fork in the road, take it"" philosophy no longer works for Alejandro de la Vega (Antonio Banderas), the man behind the mask.  On the one hand, the people still need Zorro, particularly right now as the residents of California embrace the process of entering the United States as a free state.  On the other hand, he has a wife and son now, and his wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who used to fight alongside him, is not happy when he breaks his promise to put away the mask forever.  The people really do need Zorro, though, for an ill wind has blown into town in the form of a greedy, murderous preacher-man and, much more insidiously, a fancy-schmancy Frenchman who threatens to take away everything de la Vega/Zorro cares about - including Elena, who suddenly divorces him.  It's bad enough when you lose your wife, your son (not knowing your secret identity) thinks you're a coward, and you feel like you've lost the edge you need to be the people's champion.  It's hundreds of times worse to know that your possible downfall comes at the hands of a Frenchman.You can't keep a good, masked legend down, though, especially when you're wooing his ex-wife.  Suspicious of his motives (and clueless as to what Elena could possibly see in him), Zorro is determined to get to the bottom of Frenchie's secrets.  There's a lot going on he doesn't know about at first, but it all comes together to reveal a plot of national - nay, global - importance.  There are a number of things I would like to talk about in terms of the plot, but it's impossible to do so without giving too much away.  Let's just say that some of it is out deep in left field - yet it does all hold together, which is what's most important.  The action's important, too, of course, and there's plenty of it.  Rest assured that Z's will be carved into bad guys' shirts on more than one occasion, as Zorro's trademark swordsmanship is put on display fairly often.  Heck, everybody gets in to the fight at some point.  All the early battles, which are rather exciting in and of themselves, are mere skirmishes leading up to the extended fight scenes near the end (in, on, and around a speeding locomotive).  It's especially interesting to watch Catherine Zeta-Jones open a few cans of you know what - her mechanical fighting style isn't that impressive, but it's a hoot to watch all of her facial expressions as she fights.Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are really terrific in their roles, but young Adrian Alonso steals the show time and again as de la Vega's son Joaquin.  He's an impish little fellow who obviously has a healthy portion of Zorro blood running in his veins.  His restless, action-oriented nature gets him in trouble and even puts him in danger on occasion, but the lad has all 31 flavors of spunk.The Legend of Zorro just about has it all: swashbuckling action, adventure, gunplay, sword-fighting, explosions, romance, human drama, suspense, mystery, comedy, superb acting from top to bottom, etc.  It's just a well-paced, thoroughly entertaining film that I enjoyed immensely.

There was supposedly almost no swordplay. Everyone and his sister was purportedly an expert in self-defense. No visual attempt was made to hide the fact that stunts were performed by doubles. The spark between Zorro and Elena (Banderas and Zeta-Jones) had fizzled. And critics didn't like the fact that the two leads were divorced, thus ruining the cherished Zorro family. And so forth and so on.For a long time, I just assumed this was a bad sequel to a film I've always loved. But curiosity finally got the best of me, and, with low expectations, I ordered ""The Legend of Zorro."" But, as the title of this review states, I was pleasantly surprised! There are great action sequences. Its seriocomic tone is faithful to that of the original film. Although the swordplay may not be as brilliantly executed as in the first film, there is plenty of it, and it's particulary pleasurable to see Catherine Zeta-Jones deftly wielding a sword (as she did briefly in the original movie). Yes, a Catholic Father, a peasant lady, and Zorro's son are able to fend for themselves---but for a critic to say that everyone in town is Zorro-esque is a gross exaggeration. As for the stuntwork, it was excellent, and the special features bear witness to the fact that few doubles were actually used---and it was never obvious when they were. As for the relationship of the two leads, they glow when the story allows. As for the divorce, it's a plot device: this movie has a happy ending.

""The Legend of Zorro"", unfortunately, is another.Whereas the 1998 original was more along the lines of a blockbuster, this 2005 sequel has proven to be lackluster.Antonio Banderas, as Alejandro De la Vega,has taken his late father-in-law's name, and is now more at ease in his role as a nobleman of mid-19th-century California. He is still donning the mask and making sojourns to help the oppressed and dispossessed of the region. But he now has a wife and child to consider and the tensions between the swashbuckler and his equally daring young wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones)mount when she begins to fear for the safety of their son, Joaquin.As Joaquin, Adrian Alonso reveals that the genes for the spunk and cunning of the De La Vegas have not worn thin as he defies authority to help defeat the villians of the film. At intervals, the family become the 19th century's precursor to the animated Incredibles with the skills and technology available to them.As another reviewer noted, the story loses its credibility when Elena and Alejandro divorce due to her concerns for her son's safety. This would have been extremely rare  in the 19th century, and unheard of in a Catholic country at that time.Elena reunites with a former acquaintance she met during her years in Spain, a French nobleman named Armand(a piercing-eyed, striking Rufus Sewell) in whose house she and her son become guests, and whom Elena finds to have sinister designs on California, not unlike the abductor she had believed to be her father for many years.The ""Zorro"" franchise recycles Tony Amendola as a priest trying to teach students such as Joaquin, whereas he had been a devious henchman to Don Rafael in the 1998 film, and lets us glimpse Mary Crosby, a quarter century after the height of her popularity, in a non-speaking role as a Governor's wife, reassuring us that there are no small roles, only small actors.While it has a few impressive moments, the script is a tired rehash of the original theme, and the outcome is predictable, literally hinging on the ability to get on the right track.Young Adrian Alonso appears to have a bright future ahead of him, and I hope that Antonio and Catherine enjoyed their onscreen reunion.But generally, it simply does not have the sizzle of its 1998 predecessor, and there was a lot of time and money that could have been better spent.",2,19th Century Incredibles,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,2454,"['have', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'sequels', 'too', 'many', 'original', 'films', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'stellar', 'Legend', 'Zorro', 'unfortunately', '1998', 'original', 'was', 'more', 'lines', 'blockbuster', '2005', 'sequel', 'proven', 'be', 'lackluster.Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Alejandro', 'De', 'la', 'Vega', 'taken', 'late', 'father-in-law', 'name', 'now', 'more', 'ease', 'role', 'nobleman', 'mid-19th-century', 'California', 'still', 'donning', 'mask', 'making', 'sojourns', 'help', 'oppressed', 'dispossessed', 'region', 'now', 'wife', 'child', 'consider', 'tensions', 'swashbuckler', 'equally', 'daring', 'young', 'wife', 'Elena', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'mount', 'when', 'fear', 'safety', 'son', 'Joaquin.As', 'Joaquin', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'genes', 'spunk', 'cunning', 'De', 'La', 'Vegas', 'have', 'not', 'worn', 'thin', 'authority', 'help', 'defeat', 'villians', 'film', 'intervals', 'family', 'become', '19th', 'century', 'precursor', 'animated', 'Incredibles', 'skills', 'technology', 'available', 'them.As', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'story', 'credibility', 'when', 'Elena', 'Alejandro', 'divorce', 'due', 'concerns', 'son', 'safety', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'rare', '19th', 'century', 'unheard', 'Catholic', 'country', 'time.Elena', 'former', 'acquaintance', 'met', 'years', 'Spain', 'French', 'nobleman', 'named', 'Armand', 'piercing-eyed', 'striking', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'house', 'son', 'become', 'guests', 'whom', 'Elena', 'have', 'sinister', 'designs', 'California', 'not', 'abductor', 'had', 'believed', 'be', 'father', 'many', 'years.The', 'Zorro', 'franchise', 'Tony', 'Amendola', 'priest', 'trying', 'teach', 'students', 'such', 'Joaquin', 'had', 'been', 'devious', 'henchman', 'Don', 'Rafael', '1998', 'film', 'glimpse', 'Mary', 'Crosby', 'quarter', 'century', 'height', 'popularity', 'non-speaking', 'role', 'Governor', 'wife', 'reassuring', 'are', 'small', 'roles', 'only', 'small', 'actors.While', 'few', 'impressive', 'moments', 'script', 'tired', 'rehash', 'original', 'theme', 'outcome', 'predictable', 'literally', 'hinging', 'ability', 'get', 'right', 'track.Young', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'have', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'hope', 'Antonio', 'Catherine', 'enjoyed', 'onscreen', 'reunion.But', 'generally', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'sizzle', '1998', 'predecessor', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'time', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent']",N/A

Zorro's son does antics that out-Zorro Zorro himself. It was really silly. I didn't care at all for the bad guys-they weren't just corrupt, but downright evil (remember Disney's Commandante?-he was just overboard, not Darth Maul). Do all bad guys in today's movies need to be worse than the last?  The bad guy who was doing the dirty work really made me sick to look at and I think that's what the director had in mind.  Why?  His sidekick was so stupid and unbelievable that I laughed out loud.  He looked like some Chinese criminal from Hawaii Five-O. Even worse, he had some goofy knife thingy that looked like it was part of his hand.  Absolutely ridiculous!  By the time the final fight scene came, I wasn't sure I was watching Zorro or James Bond. All in all, it just didn't seem like a Zorro movie.  I didn't feel like rooting for anyone as much as I was rooting AGAINST someone.

It comes as no surprise that most movie-goers were skeptical at first, especially with the addition of a young boy to the primary cast.In the end, any doubts the critics had were not changed after the viewing of the film. That's quite odd, considering the fact that the movie is as good, if not better, than its predecessor.The comparison between the two films is uncalled for. It is not fair for any movie to be judged good or bad by only comparing it to another one it is related to.However, if you were to compare the ""Zorro"" movies, you would clearly see that the latest installment has kept all the important ingredients the first one had. So to classify it as more ""money making garbage from Hollywood"" is simply wrong.Hollywood, indeed, has been given a bad reputation about its overdose of formulaic movies. To say that ""The Mask of Zorro"" doesn't follow a formula is to lie.The plot, which involves the title character questioning the future of his superhero persona for reasons of the heart, is reminiscent of movies like ""Spiderman 2"", and even ""Superman 2"". But if you must compare, you should realize that the ""zero to hero"" aspect of the first film is probably the most common tale in Hollywood history.""If your stepfather could only see you now..."" is what Zorro's wife is told twice in the movie. The reference to the evil character is actually the only reference to the preceding film in the entire feature. It wouldn't make sense to say that the movie was trying to cash in on the success of its prequel, considering the fact that they were nearly a decade apart.The money the movie makes is rightfully earned by original material.""The Legend of Zorro"" is the exact movie you expect it to be. It is not promoted as something it is not. You get what you pay to see, and then some. Clocking in at 129 minutes, it is still shorter that the previous film, despite the popular critique of being ""too long"".The film separates itself from true Hollywood garbage by actually providing a story worth following.

THE MASK OF ZORRO was a sure-fire-hit-blockbuster when it first came out becuase it was something new, different, original, and fierce. I guess it's just hard to psyche up an audience that's been waiting for this sequel for almost a decade.But, Some of the wonderous elements that made Zorro such an idolized character got swept away in a new direction. Now, don't be alarmed. Both movies are directed by the same man, a msiter Martin Cambell who did well in introducing us to zorro the first time around.This time, we find that Zorro has been fighting the tyranny of crime for quite a while, now having a son that has the spirit of Zorro-filled adventures already leaping out of his small little heart. Zorro's wife, CATHRINE ZETA-JONES, is apparently fed up with her husband and demands that he hangs up the mask for good. And he does for a good long while, until forces are risen to destroy America with an explosive that none of them have ever seen before.Some 'Bad guy's' in this movie are your stereotypical, run of the mill, forgetable faces that leave no real lasting impression or have a long history but are introduced quickly to move the plot along. Watch for a cameo of the famous man responsible for bringing frankenstein's monster to life in VAN HELSING. He is none other than Shuller Hensly.This movie has the scent of a Zorro adventure but only lacks a little in the punch. Agreeably little to the point where the most I could subtract was only one star. This movie was done well but had a bit more special effects than the last one.

Though overlong in excess of two hours, and though the story line is pushed beyond tolerable limits, it is easy to forgive the many weaknesses of the film and just enjoy the verbal and physical jousting between Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.The story this time 'round concerns the broken promise Alejandro de la Vega (Banderas) made to his wife Elena (Zeta-Jones) at their marriage ten years ago: Alejandro would give up his dangerous life as the masked Zorro.  But the upcoming opportunity of statehood for California is at stake and so, of course, the five bells ring and Zorro is on his faithful steed Tornado to right the wrongs.  Elena informs him that if he goes on another mission, he may as well not come home, despite the fact that they now have a son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso).  But Zorro rides and gradually we discover the covert underpinnings of the cause to which Zorro is called.  There is a newcomer in town, one Frenchman Armand (Rufus Sewell) who is mysteriously tied to the worst of all possible deeds with the aid of the smarmy Jacob McGivens (Nick Chinlund)....  Elena, no slouch of a wimpy wife, joins in the action in a wily way, and ultimately with the help of good priests  Brother Ignacio (Alberto Reyes) and especially Frey Felipe (Julio Oscar Mechoso) good triumphs over evil (surprise!).There are some well staged duels and fighting episodes and some tender moments about family, especially father/son repartee, but the ingredient that makes these Zorro films work is the fact that Banderas and Zeta-Jones look like their have such a good time.  There are many hilarious lines in the most unexpected places.  No, this is not a great movie, and despite the fact that yet another sequel is probably planned, enough is enough.  But it is entertaining in its lighthearted way.

958549,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B000CEXGAK,Jessica Lux,"[42, 49]","This movie gets high marks from me in the ""PG"" category.  It can not truly be compared to 1998's Mask of Zorro, even though the characters are reprising their roles, because the original was a significantly darker ""PG-13.""  Don't go with expectations that it will match the original.When we revisit Don Alejandro de la Vega (aka Zorro, played by Antonio Banderas) and his charming wife Elena (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), ten years have passed since the original movie, and their son is a major player in their lives (he is masterfully and comically played by the young Adrian Alonso).  As married life as gone on, Elena has continually urged Alejandro to give up his secret life as Zorro, but he keeps feeling the tug of his people.  The two quarrel and separate, leading to separate lives amongst some major political upheaval and the arrival of a strange Frenchman who seems to have his own plans for the homeland.  There are a few stretches in the plot, but nothing too outrageous for an action/comedy, and there is plenty of witty banter and sight gags to make up for it.  (Of course, any history buff will find the plot laughable, but it's for entertainment, okay?)  Elena gets to do some excellent fighting and espionage-types scenes in this plot, really coming in to her own.As my review title states, this is a family movie.  The darkest moments are Alejandro's sad drunken sloven days.  Again and again, the values of family, fighting fair, not shooting anyone in the back, doing well in school, etc. are reinforced, but not in a preachy way.  The young son of Zorro is quite a troublemaker in school, and he learns a lot about ""doing the right thing"" throughout the movie, much to the comic delight of the audience.  See this with a younger audience and know that you are getting some good action/adventure, packed with comedy and romance, without anything vulgar.

To me though they are about as good as they were in the first film. They also knocked the length of the film, oh yes 2 1/2 hours of non-stop swashbuckling action is just awful. I'd rather see 2 1/2 hours of people arguining and crying like in the movies they give 2 big thumbs up to....... please!.  This is a fun movie, sure the plot is a lot weaker than the first film but the stunts are well done and they kept my attention. When Zorro chases the train full of bad guys, it reminded me of what we used to get in classic westerns. We don't get that much in films anymore, so you'd think Ebert would've appreciated that. When watching it I just couldn't see how it should be on any worse films of the year list. Rufus Sewell (Dark City, A Knights Tale) is also a fitting villian for Zorro to go up against.Now I'll say what I didn't like about it. First, they are like the worse parents in the world lol. They have only about 10 minutes or even less screen time with their child. They are off doing their own stuff when the kid is in some school beating up his teacher while acting like Zorro. Plus it will bug people that Jones kicks out Banderas and then all of the sudden has a b/f. That leads somewhere though and will bug you less when you find out why she's there. Although it's still messed up how she treats him. I mean they kiss passionatly in the beginning and then she flat leaves him to do her own stuff when  he says he still wants to be Zorro.

Surely Hollywood should learn by now that the endless rehashing of yesterday's successes (or in this case at least the day before yesterday)does not build a good customer base for the future. Clearly they have not.The movie adopts the device used so successfully in the Mummy Returns of having a young boy as an up and coming hero but without the same effect. He is more of a distraction than an asset.My entire family found the movie wanting, not only in the way American history is so casually flaunted as in the ease with which the Don's wife manages to divorce him (and they good Spaniards too) among many others but in the pace and quality of the movie. Whereas the first was saved by the foil of the skill of Anthony Hopkin's acting against the two lightweights together with a reasonable story and tight direction, this second is a sprawling mess to be perfectly frank.Most children will be bored long before the conclusion as will most adults. It is a shame too as this could have been a good franchise to develop had some quality time being spent on it's development. I fear that this will be the last of the Zorro movies but there again fear is the wrong word. Hope would be better.On a more general note, 2005 was a sparse year for good quality movies on DVD despite all of the expensive hype.

958559,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CEXGAK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 5]","When I watched ""The Legend of Zorro"" all I could think of was that I was the victim of a bait and switch.  The trailers for this film showed Zorro (Antonio Banderas) and Elena (Catharine Zeta-Jones) fighting side-by-side, using their swords to slash their initials into the trousers on some poor clown's backside.  This seemed like a logical progression to me because in ""The Mask of Zorro"" one of the best scenes is when these two go at each other with swords in the stable (You say ""The Mask of Zorro"" and I immediately think ""Vigorous...he was very vigorous, father"").  So given all the fun stunts and sword bits they came up with for the first Zorro film, and given that director Martin Campbell is back, I was looking forward to them giving Elena more to do as she fights by the side of her beloved husband.Granted, Elena does have more to do in this 2005 film, but it takes way to close to two hours to get to the point where she is doing it by Zorro's side.  That is because early on in the film Elena and Alejandro get divorced (yes, they are still Catholic, although Alejandro's priest is not inclined to forgive him his sins apparently).  As soon as this happened I thought that it was not only very, very wrong, but that it was a bad sign indicating that this film was going to try and be as much like the first one as they could get away with the second time around (Hollywood wants to believe imitation is the surest way to success).  Alejandro and Elena are once again apart, there is the question of a child finding out their father is Zorro, and political intrigue is the order of the day.The time is now 1850 and California is about to become a state.  This is not a good thing because that would help turn the United States into a super power, and for the sake of argument (and narrative conflict), there are those with power and position who think this would be a bad thing (upstart Yankees and all that).  So there are allegorical dimensions to this story that speak to problems in the world today, and explains, I suppose, why the villain, Armand (Rufus Sewell), is French.  Elena is dating the villain, Alexandro thinks yelling at her will win her back, and their son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso), is showing that he is a chip off the old block even if neither of his parents notice.  I guess it was just genetics, but I would prefer to think that maybe mom talks highly of Zorro or something that suggests human contact between the kids and his parents.There are some comparable stunts to what we saw in the previous film, but there is also a running gag with a pipe that makes you want to (run and/or gag, take your pick).  By the time we get everybody in this family on the same page for the last act of the film there is more than a little action, but I have spent so much of the movie being ticked off at the divorced couple that I get to stubbornly insist it is too late.  The secret that is revealed to explain what Elena knows that we do not know only ticks me off more and raises the question as to how a film can make an implicit attack against the Republican party at a point in history when it does not even exist yet.  Then again, the Republican Party was born a radical (yes, even liberal) political party bent on abolition.  Plus the Pinkerton Detective Agency was formed in 1850, so I doubt they were involved in working for the higher levels of the American government.  You mess up the character dynamic like they did in this film then I get to rant and rave about history and politics and anything else I do not like.The story for ""The Legend of Zorro"" comes from Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman (the duo that did ""The Island""), and Ted Elliott  & Terry Rossio (the team that did ""The Mask of Zorro"" and the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies), with the first couple getting the screenplay credit.  But whoever had the bright idea of divorcing the co-stars of this sequel needs to, oh, I don't know, strapped to the cow catcher of a steaming locomotive heading for the end of the line?  I want to think it was the Johnnies-come-lately given the resumes of the respective teams, but you can never tell with the way that Hollywood works.  Lois Lane and Clark Kent have their rough patches and Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker separated for a while, but they never got divorced!  Besides, if Zorro is Superman or Spiderman then Elena is Wonder Woman or the Black Cat: to wit, women that can stand by their man and fight alongside them.  Coming up with reasons to ignore this fact was not a smart move.",3,"I wanted to see Zorro and Elena fight side-by-side with swords, not watch them get divorced",1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,4532,"['When', 'watched', 'Legend', 'Zorro', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'victim', 'bait', 'switch', 'trailers', 'film', 'showed', 'Zorro', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Elena', 'Catharine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'fighting', 'side-by-side', 'using', 'swords', 'slash', 'initials', 'trousers', 'poor', 'clown', 'backside', 'seemed', 'logical', 'progression', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'when', 'two', 'go', 'other', 'swords', 'stable', 'say', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'immediately', 'think', 'Vigorous', 'was', 'very', 'vigorous', 'father', 'So', 'given', 'fun', 'stunts', 'sword', 'bits', 'came', 'up', 'first', 'Zorro', 'film', 'given', 'director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'back', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'giving', 'Elena', 'more', 'do', 'side', 'beloved', 'husband.Granted', 'Elena', 'have', 'more', 'do', '2005', 'film', 'way', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'doing', 'Zorro', 'side', 'because', 'early', 'film', 'Elena', 'Alejandro', 'get', 'divorced', 'yes', 'are', 'still', 'Catholic', 'Alejandro', 'priest', 'not', 'inclined', 'forgive', 'sins', 'apparently', 'As', 'soon', 'happened', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'very', 'wrong', 'was', 'bad', 'sign', 'indicating', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'try', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'second', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'believe', 'imitation', 'surest', 'way', 'success', 'Alejandro', 'Elena', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'apart', 'question', 'child', 'finding', 'out', 'father', 'Zorro', 'political', 'intrigue', 'order', 'day.The', 'time', 'now', '1850', 'California', 'become', 'state', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'would', 'help', 'turn', 'United', 'States', 'super', 'power', 'sake', 'argument', 'narrative', 'conflict', 'are', 'power', 'position', 'who', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'upstart', 'Yankees', 'are', 'allegorical', 'dimensions', 'story', 'problems', 'world', 'today', 'suppose', 'why', 'villain', 'Armand', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'French', 'Elena', 'dating', 'villain', 'Alexandro', 'yelling', 'will', 'win', 'back', 'son', 'Joaquin', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'showing', 'chip', 'old', 'block', 'even', 'parents', 'notice', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'genetics', 'would', 'prefer', 'think', 'maybe', 'mom', 'talks', 'highly', 'Zorro', 'something', 'human', 'contact', 'kids', 'parents.There', 'are', 'comparable', 'stunts', 'what', 'saw', 'previous', 'film', 'also', 'running', 'gag', 'pipe', 'want', 'run', 'and/or', 'gag', 'take', 'pick', 'time', 'get', 'everybody', 'family', 'same', 'page', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'more', 'little', 'action', 'have', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'being', 'ticked', 'off', 'divorced', 'couple', 'get', 'stubbornly', 'insist', 'too', 'late', 'secret', 'revealed', 'explain', 'what', 'Elena', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'only', 'ticks', 'more', 'question', 'how', 'film', 'can', 'make', 'implicit', 'attack', 'Republican', 'party', 'point', 'history', 'when', 'not', 'even', 'exist', 'yet', 'Then', 'again', 'Republican', 'Party', 'was', 'born', 'radical', 'yes', 'even', 'liberal', 'political', 'party', 'bent', 'abolition', 'Pinkerton', 'Detective', 'Agency', 'was', 'formed', '1850', 'doubt', 'were', 'involved', 'working', 'higher', 'levels', 'American', 'government', 'mess', 'up', 'character', 'dynamic', 'did', 'film', 'then', 'get', 'rant', 'rave', 'history', 'politics', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'not', 'like.The', 'story', 'Legend', 'Zorro', 'Roberto', 'Orci', 'Alex', 'Kurtzman', 'duo', 'did', 'Island', 'Ted', 'Elliott', 'Terry', 'Rossio', 'team', 'did', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'first', 'couple', 'getting', 'screenplay', 'credit', 'had', 'bright', 'idea', 'divorcing', 'co-stars', 'sequel', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'strapped', 'cow', 'catcher', 'steaming', 'locomotive', 'heading', 'end', 'line', 'want', 'think', 'was', 'Johnnies-come-lately', 'given', 'resumes', 'respective', 'teams', 'can', 'never', 'tell', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'works', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'have', 'rough', 'patches', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'separated', 'while', 'never', 'got', 'divorced', 'Zorro', 'Superman', 'Spiderman', 'then', 'Elena', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Black', 'Cat', 'wit', 'women', 'can', 'stand', 'man', 'fight', 'alongside', 'Coming', 'up', 'reasons', 'ignore', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'smart', 'move']",N/A

Keeping some of the tongue in cheek humor and swashbuckling sense of adventure that made the prequel such a hit, this film is simply a lot of fun to watch despite the somewhat convoluted plot. It is too bad, however,  that viewers had to wait seven years for this sequel.It is the mid-nineteenth century, and California lies on the brink of statehood. The handsome Don Alejandro De La Vega (Antonio Banderas), who is secretly Zorro), has been married to the beautiful Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) for the past ten years, and they have an adorable son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso). When California's plans for statehood are interrupted by some nefarious doings, Zorro steps up to home plate.Antonio Banderas was simply born to the role of Zorro. Looking every bit the aristocratic Hidalgo when he plays the role of Don Antonio De La Vega, he immediately steps into swashbuckling mode when he appears as Zorro. It seems, however, that he and the beautiful Elena are having some marital difficulties over Alejandro's attachment to appearing as Zorro. Moreover, Alejandro's Zorro persona has  caused him to remain a little distant from his son, Joaquin, who worships Zorro, not realizing it is his father.Catherine Zeta-Jones is a pleasure to watch as always. Not only is she simply gorgeous as Elena, but she can act, as well.  With her marriage on the rocks,  Elena is unwillingly drawn into a scheme that sees her form a relationship with Armand (Rufus Sewell), a former childhood friend, who is also a handsome and debonair French Count. It just so happens, however,  that Armand has something up his sleeve that will galvanize Zorro into action.Newcomer Adrian Alonso is simply adorable in the role of Joaquin,  Alejandro's and Elena's mischievous seven year old son,  who has a penchant for emulating his hero, Zorro. Joaquin's spirit for adventure manages to get him into some scrapes, and it soon becomes clear that the apple did not fall far from the tree. Joaquin, unaware of who Zorro really is,  is  somewhat disappointed in his seemingly meek and distant father for not being more like his action hero.The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent, with special kudos going to Alberto Reyes as Brother Ignacio, Joaquin's guardian angel on Earth, handling the role with laid back humor and warmth. Nick Chinlund also pulls out all the stops as the nefarious Jacob McGivens, the quintessential bad guy. Rufus Sewell is well-cast as the urbane and charming  French Count with a secret agenda, proving that looks can be deceiving.The only problem with the film is that it is simply not as good as the prequel. The plot is a little too contrived and convoluted. It suffers from some modern sensibilities that are jarring in a film that is supposed to reflect the past. It is also riddled with historical inaccuracies. Still, given these issues, it is still a fun film to watch. Fans of Zorro will not be too disappointed. I only hope that if there is yet another sequel, the studio will not make the viewers wait seven more years.",4,FINALLY...ZORRO RETURNS TO THE SCREEN...,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,3163,"['most', 'sequels', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'prequel', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'still', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'Keeping', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'swashbuckling', 'sense', 'adventure', 'made', 'prequel', 'hit', 'film', 'simply', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'too', 'bad', 'however', 'viewers', 'had', 'wait', 'seven', 'years', 'sequel.It', 'mid-nineteenth', 'century', 'California', 'brink', 'statehood', 'handsome', 'Don', 'Alejandro', 'De', 'La', 'Vega', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'who', 'secretly', 'Zorro', 'been', 'married', 'beautiful', 'Elena', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'adorable', 'son', 'Joaquin', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'When', 'California', 'plans', 'statehood', 'are', 'interrupted', 'nefarious', 'doings', 'Zorro', 'up', 'home', 'plate.Antonio', 'Banderas', 'was', 'simply', 'born', 'role', 'Zorro', 'Looking', 'bit', 'aristocratic', 'Hidalgo', 'when', 'role', 'Don', 'Antonio', 'De', 'La', 'Vega', 'immediately', 'swashbuckling', 'mode', 'when', 'Zorro', 'however', 'beautiful', 'Elena', 'are', 'having', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'Alejandro', 'attachment', 'appearing', 'Zorro', 'Moreover', 'Alejandro', 'Zorro', 'persona', 'caused', 'remain', 'little', 'distant', 'son', 'Joaquin', 'who', 'Zorro', 'not', 'realizing', 'father.Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'always', 'Not', 'only', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'Elena', 'can', 'act', 'well', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'Elena', 'unwillingly', 'drawn', 'scheme', 'form', 'relationship', 'Armand', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'former', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'handsome', 'debonair', 'French', 'Count', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'however', 'Armand', 'something', 'up', 'sleeve', 'will', 'galvanize', 'Zorro', 'action.Newcomer', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'simply', 'adorable', 'role', 'Joaquin', 'Alejandro', 'Elena', 'mischievous', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'penchant', 'emulating', 'hero', 'Zorro', 'Joaquin', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'manages', 'get', 'scrapes', 'soon', 'clear', 'apple', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'far', 'tree', 'Joaquin', 'unaware', 'who', 'Zorro', 'really', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'seemingly', 'meek', 'distant', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'action', 'hero.The', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'special', 'kudos', 'going', 'Alberto', 'Reyes', 'Brother', 'Ignacio', 'Joaquin', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Earth', 'handling', 'role', 'laid', 'back', 'humor', 'warmth', 'Nick', 'Chinlund', 'also', 'out', 'stops', 'nefarious', 'Jacob', 'McGivens', 'quintessential', 'bad', 'guy', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'well-cast', 'urbane', 'charming', 'French', 'Count', 'secret', 'agenda', 'proving', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving.The', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'prequel', 'plot', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'convoluted', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'jarring', 'film', 'supposed', 'reflect', 'past', 'also', 'riddled', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Still', 'given', 'issues', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'Fans', 'Zorro', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'disappointed', 'only', 'hope', 'yet', 'sequel', 'studio', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'viewers', 'wait', 'seven', 'more', 'years']",N/A

I cannot believe they actually got paid to produce this abomination/monstrosity of a script and what's even more amazing is that Antonia Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones went along with it!5) The 7-year old kid, Zorro Jr. got under the bad guys wagon, followed them to their hideout, and gave them a piece if his mind...6) As for the ending being ""Highly predictable,"" that is the understatement of the year!7) The Zena-like type of acting (silly-low quality) was another disappointment.8) Getting out of a series of impossible situations by the extreme uselessness of the villains.And the list goes on and on making it ridiculous all around.With such writers, the two Pinkerton Agency/U.S. government agents in the film are not that far off when they say: ""Zorro is a relic of the past.""So it's a terrible plot, below average dialogues, weak acting, an interesting setting, decent music, and a good (overall) cast, which when put together fail to take off.It's all about immigrants' integration in American society, and about how Mexicans should become ""good""/patriotic Americans. 1.2 Stars",1,What a let down/disappointment this film was!,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,2830,"['first', 'Zorro', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'second', 'film', 'combination', 'incompetence', 'propaganda', 'latter', 'much', 'Patriot', 'starring', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Peacemaker', 'starring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'starring', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Welcome', 'Sarajevo', 'starring', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Icon', 'starring', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'too', 'many', 'others', '.Where', 'one', 'start', 'How', 'plot', 'French', 'terrorist', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'knight', 'Spanish', 'crusaders', 'order', 'are', 'French', 'ones', 'known', 'knights', 'Aragon', 'who', 'blow', 'up', 'USA', 'Oh', 'god', 'have', 'mercy', 'PLEASE', 'major', 'setbacks', 'are:1', 'Zorro', 'horse', 'drinks', 'alcohol', 'smokes', 'tobacco', 'comment', '2', 'not-so-hidden', 'politics', 'movie', 'messages', 'are', 'finally', 'free', 'are', 'finally', 'Americans', 'etc', 'Give', 'break', 'course', 'presence', 'evil', 'European', 'conveniently', 'French', 'that/The', 'whole', 'ludicrous', 'French', 'Fries-Freedom', 'Fries', 'thing', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'also', 'nativist/evil', 'white', 'supremacist/bad', 'cowboy/religious', 'fundamentalist', 'villain', 'definitely', 'political', 'agenda', 'here', 'movie', 'film', 'coincidently', 'time', 'when', 'US', 'experienced', 'major', 'immigrant', 'demonstrations.3', 'southerners', 'are', 'traitors', 'always', 'Colonel', 'Beauregard', 'side', 'European', 'terrorists', 'preparing', 'pre-emptive', 'strike', 'Washington', 'DC', 'pathetic', '4', 'Mix-Ups/Confusion', 'Waking', 'up', 'sleeping', 'Giant', 'was', 'Japanese', 'Admiral', 'Yamamoto', 'quote', 'following', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'not', 'non-existent', 'knight', 'words', 'set', 'destroying', 'USA', 'mid-19th', 'Century', 'writers', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'allowed', 'write', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'actually', 'got', 'paid', 'produce', 'abomination/monstrosity', 'script', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'Antonia', 'Banderas', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'went', '5', '7-year', 'old', 'kid', 'Zorro', 'Jr.', 'got', 'bad', 'guys', 'wagon', 'followed', 'hideout', 'gave', 'piece', 'mind', '6', 'ending', 'being', 'Highly', 'predictable', 'understatement', 'year', '7', 'Zena-like', 'type', 'acting', 'silly-low', 'quality', 'was', 'disappointment.8', 'Getting', 'series', 'impossible', 'situations', 'extreme', 'uselessness', 'villains.And', 'list', 'making', 'ridiculous', 'around.With', 'such', 'writers', 'two', 'Pinkerton', 'Agency/U.S', 'government', 'agents', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'off', 'when', 'say', 'Zorro', 'relic', 'past', 'terrible', 'plot', 'average', 'dialogues', 'weak', 'acting', 'interesting', 'setting', 'decent', 'music', 'good', 'overall', 'cast', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'fail', 'take', 'off.It', 'immigrants', 'integration', 'American', 'society', 'how', 'Mexicans', 'should', 'become', 'good', '/patriotic', 'Americans', '1.2', 'Stars']",N/A

This was a fun movie, plain and simple.  Much has already been said--pro and con--about the story line, characters, etc., but a couple of red flags really went up for me as a history buff.This entire fictional story occurs in 1850 from voting on statehood through annexation of California as a state.  During the scenes in which Count Armand and the others are plotting against the United States, a couple of references are made to the Confederate States, which, of course, did not come into existence until 1861--11 years later.  The trouble that eventually led to the war was brewing by then, but the Confederacy just did not exist.  Also, near the end, Abraham Lincoln was present at the signing of the annexation.  Likewise, he was not inaugurated president until 1861 and was virtually unknown outside Illinois in 1850.  I am curious as to why such glaring historical errors were made.Nonetheless, the language is clean and the action is great:  No graphic blood and guts--just good cliffhanger action.  All in all, it's a great movie, with lots of humor included to give it a lighter side.

I've always enjoyed the first film, and this was cheap enough when I bought it, so I thought why the hell not? To be honest, apart from the overlong, padded running time, it was an above average, albeit unnecessary sequel. It's sorely missing Anthony Hopkins on-screen prescence (given that he died at the end of the first one), but apart from that it's not bad.It's great to see the re-teaming of Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones again, with their chemistry from the first film following to the second one - should their other halves be worried? And the introduction of their son, Joaquin, is welcome, although probably unnecessary again. It does make for some cool lines/scenes, but he does seem a little modern in 1850 compared to his parents.Some of the stunts are just a little bit over the top, I particularly found the horse on top of the train sequence very unbelievable. The horse would be going nuts. Also the scene near the end, where they're fighting at the front of the train, the fact that it's actually been filmed against a green screen is very, VERY obvious.Legend of Zorro has a PG-13 rating, and it shows. Zorro never uses his sword to kill, and there's very little blood shed, which seems to detract from the original a bit, and I don't understand why it was necessary to make it a PG-13.For once, I actually noticed the score a film. (It's so unlike me.) James Horner does an excellent score to both films, keeping some of the themes from the first one in the original, and it keeps the film going, when you hear the theme that is so well known from the first one.Over all, it's a good sequel, but the running time really got to me.

That's due in no small part to the abilities of its two stars, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  The chemistry that they brought to the table in the previous movie is still there, it's just that they were given a whole lot to work with.The story takes up about 10 or 12 years after the last movie.  California is about to join the Union, much to the disgust of a collection of a mysterious alliance of Europeans, cowboys and a Confederate General (never mind that the Confederacy was still 8 or 9 years away from existing, let alone raising an army or finding spiffy uniforms in which to dress its officers).  The son that Alejandro/Zorro (Banderas) and Elena (Zeta-Jones) is now a Zorro-worshipping little hellion bored with school.

How's that?

It is not nearly as violent (although there is still a lot of action and fighting, it is not as graphic as the first with heads and hands in jars.  The film definitely misses the presence of Anthony Hopkins and the father/authority figure he played in the first.This movie is set 10 years after the original, just before CA becomes a state.  Elena and Alejandro are at odds over his dedication to Zorro at the beginning of the movie, and that theme plays throughout most of the movie.  Rufus Sewell is the main bad guy in the movie and as usual excels at playing a jackass who you love to hate.  Like in the first movie there is a conspiracy to take down, and this time Elena is much more involved in thwarting it separately from Zorro.Like I said in the title, the movie is not as good as the original.  Even though some of the scenes were done to mirror some from the first movie (the opening sequence for example, and Elena facing off with bad guys in a stable), it does not have the same feel as the first.  That is good and bad.  It is good in that it is not a carbon copy of the first movie, but bad because it also does not have some of the things that worked well in the first.  It is really the trap that a lot of sequels fall into.  One thing I think the movie misses is the comedic elements between Alejandro and Elena that worked so well in the first one.  But because they spend a lot of the movie apart, and fighting when together the movie tries to get the comedy elements in via other ways that just do not work as well.As far as extras go, you do get more with this than from the first movie.

It is with this notion in mind that ""The Legend of Zorro"" is a fun film.  The action is very well choreographed and very enjoyable.  Zorro's stunts are breathtaking and far superior to the stunts and swordplay in the very enjoyable ""Mask of Zorro"" film.  I would even go so far as to say that the majority of the plot in ""Legend of Zorro"" is also superior to the storyline that takes place in Antonio's first turn as the masked, Zorro.The sole reason for this film's 3 star rating is Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Actually, that isn't even her fault.  Catherine's character, Elena, is absolutely repulsive in this movie.  She is whiney, she is rude, she is darn-near unbelievably difficult to tolerate.  For lack of a better word, she is absolutely a gigantic b****.  In spite of Elena's best attempts to make this movie no fun at all, Antonio's performance as Zorro and as a father are way fun and very enjoyable.Buy this movie only if you are a total completist (as I am) and feel the need to own it simply because you own the first.

Antonio Banderas would be returning as Don Alejandro de la Vega..... even more exciting.The film takes place long after when the first film ended (I believe it is 10 years), so Alejandro has been carving ""Z""s for quite some time now.  He and Elena have been married for the same span of time, and their baby, Joaquim, is now a 10 year old boy. The film opens with a vote being taken for California to join the United States.  One of our new villains - a scarred, self-righteous nutcase who claims to be doing God's work - and his henchmen show up determined to steal all of the votes.  Zorro then shows up and an absolutely fantastic swordfight ensues.  This is truly one of the visual highlights of the film, and anyone who enjoys swordfighting will love these scenes.  However, at the end of the swordfight Zorro loses his mask and two men hiding in the brush happen to see his face....The story that ensues is a classic one, but it is much different than ""The Mask of Zorro.""  This film is a PG film, so more comedy is present and the film has a much more lighthearted tone.  There is a lot of bantering present between Alejandro and Elena about his alter ego and their marriage is clearly struggling as a result.I truly appreciated this because if a man were to ride off into the night, night after night, to endanger his life for others only to lose time with his family and leave them constantly worrying about his safety - don't you think that the wife would start to get upset about it and resent him for it?  He has a selfless and incredible cause, of course, but he still has an obligation to his family.  Elena clearly struggles with this and she sort of wants a regular life.  This brings such an incredible realism to the story and a realism that is not often present in its genre.The acting is superb in the film.  Banderas does a fantastic job playing both de la Vega and Zorro, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is once again perfect in the role of Elena.  Rufus Sewell may be a little miscast, in my opinion, but he still manages to do a convincing job as the rich Frenchman, Armand, who mysteriously arrives in California and immediately begins wooing Elena.  Also, Adrian Alonso does a fantastic job creating a rambunctious, yet extremely likable, Joaquim.The plot is also very imaginative and effective.  Although it may not work as well as the writers may have hoped in some places, they manage to create a truly unique and realistic story that everyone can relate to.  We can really relate to Zorro and Elena; even though they are living fantastic lives, they are still real people with very common problems.While there is a lot of great action in this film, the heart of ""Legend"" is really in its honesty and realism.  And this is precisely where the movie really shines.",5,"Wonderfully action-packed, yet transcends the genre with its honesty",1136937600,"01 11, 2006",2006,2904,"['When', 'heard', 'were', 'finally', 'making', 'sequel', 'fantastic', '1998', 'film', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'was', 'simply', 'thrilled', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'would', 'be', 'returning', 'Don', 'Alejandro', 'la', 'Vega', '..', 'even', 'more', 'exciting.The', 'film', 'place', 'long', 'when', 'first', 'film', 'ended', 'believe', '10', 'years', 'so', 'Alejandro', 'been', 'carving', 'Z', 's', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'Elena', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'same', 'span', 'time', 'baby', 'Joaquim', 'now', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'film', 'vote', 'being', 'taken', 'California', 'join', 'United', 'States', 'One', 'new', 'villains', 'scarred', 'self-righteous', 'nutcase', 'who', 'be', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'henchmen', 'show', 'up', 'determined', 'steal', 'votes', 'Zorro', 'then', 'up', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'swordfight', 'ensues', 'truly', 'one', 'visual', 'highlights', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'swordfighting', 'will', 'love', 'scenes', 'However', 'end', 'swordfight', 'Zorro', 'mask', 'two', 'men', 'hiding', 'brush', 'happen', 'see', 'face', '.The', 'story', 'classic', 'one', 'much', 'different', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'film', 'PG', 'film', 'so', 'more', 'comedy', 'present', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'lot', 'bantering', 'present', 'Alejandro', 'Elena', 'alter', 'ego', 'marriage', 'clearly', 'struggling', 'result.I', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'man', 'were', 'ride', 'off', 'night', 'night', 'night', 'endanger', 'life', 'others', 'only', 'lose', 'time', 'family', 'leave', 'constantly', 'worrying', 'safety', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'wife', 'would', 'start', 'get', 'upset', 'resent', 'selfless', 'incredible', 'cause', 'course', 'still', 'obligation', 'family', 'Elena', 'clearly', 'sort', 'regular', 'life', 'incredible', 'realism', 'story', 'realism', 'not', 'often', 'present', 'genre.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'film', 'Banderas', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'de', 'la', 'Vega', 'Zorro', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'once', 'again', 'perfect', 'role', 'Elena', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'miscast', 'opinion', 'still', 'do', 'convincing', 'job', 'rich', 'Frenchman', 'Armand', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'California', 'immediately', 'wooing', 'Elena', 'Also', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'fantastic', 'job', 'creating', 'rambunctious', 'yet', 'extremely', 'likable', 'Joaquim.The', 'plot', 'also', 'very', 'imaginative', 'effective', 'may', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'may', 'have', 'hoped', 'places', 'manage', 'create', 'truly', 'unique', 'realistic', 'story', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'Zorro', 'Elena', 'even', 'are', 'living', 'fantastic', 'lives', 'are', 'still', 'real', 'people', 'very', 'common', 'problems.While', 'lot', 'great', 'action', 'film', 'heart', 'Legend', 'really', 'honesty', 'realism', 'precisely', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'shines']",N/A

Adrianus ""Courtesy Buster2000ad""","[6, 19]","After the first few minutes of ""the Legend of Zorro"" it became apparent that the film should have been titled ""the Legend of Sorrow"". The acting is terrible, the plot is retarded and the action sequences are as believable as the Bush administration. While watching the first scene where Zorro snatches back a chest from the evil priest I was awe-struck with the unrealistic physics relating to a movie. I couldn't understand what sort of Director would think that an audience would be ignorant enough to believe that a horse and carraige could so easily take out a brick pilar but in turn be so easily destroyed by a piece of rope. I found it to be most insulting to my intelligence that I am supposed to believe the character of Zorro (Sorrow) could be able to keep up with a carraige drawn by two horses while running atop a wall as wide as two bricks. I found the evil priest character to be insulting to religious people, and have not ruled out the fact that the cast must have been devil worshippers who probably started each day with a Satanic ritual before starting filming. That would certainly explain Sorrow's supernatural ability to be able to pull off the incredible (and most unbeliavable) acrobatics in this film, the dark lord must have granted him the power. Needless to say that I do not recommend this film to anyone unless they want to experience the feeling of having your brain cells melted away by a piece of cinematography that is guerunteed to lower your IQ. Disgusting, they have ruined the prospects of a Zorro franchise with this load of garbage, and the Director was obviously unaware of the fact that the character of Zorro is supposed to be more like an old-days James Bond that can get out of sticky situation using realistic solutions rather than the far-fetched overblown disaster that we have here before us.",1,What a stinker.

Zorro is one Latin lover who has been charming the ladies for decades. Who better to portray him in THE LEGEND OF ZORRO than the luscious Antonio Banderas, reprising his role from 1998's THE MASK OF ZORRO. For those of you who remember that film, Banderas was something of an anti-hero in that movie--a wisecracking ne'er do well recruited by Anthony Hopkins to don the infamous mask, defend the common man, and win the heart of Hopkins' winsome long-lost daughter Elena.In LEGEND, ten years have passed and Alejandro/Zorro is still married to his beloved Elena and is the doting papa of little Joaquin, a precocious budding Mini-Zorro. Taking a cue from SHREK II, the screenwriters amped up the romance in the movie by driving a wedge between Zorro and Elena at the very beginning of the movie. This sets the stage for several humorous and passionate encounters worthy of any historical romance with a feuding hero and heroine destined to end up in each others' arms.I'm happy to report that Antonio is still hot and even after bearing 2 of Michael Douglas's children, Catherine Zeta-Jones is still so beautiful it hurts your eyes to look at her. (And after seeing her in those gorgeous 1850's period costumes, I'm convinced she's the only actress working today who could actually do the role of Scarlett O'Hara justice.)If you're a sucker for an old-fashioned swashbuckler with delightful touches of humor and a sexy undercurrent of romance, I highly recommend you grab the family and take in THE LEGEND OF ZORRO.

958600,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,B000CEXGAK,Thor,"[4, 7]","I have been a fan of Zorro since a long time ago. I was always watching the television series starring Guy Williams and was thrilled back in 1998 by the film The Mask Of Zorro. Around January 2005 I found out that there was a sequel in the making, which made me absolutely happy. The trailers looked fantastic, the previews made my heart beat faster, but when I finally saw the film in the cinema in November 2005, I was a bit dissapointed.First of all, the cool Antonio Banderas and the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones are both back in this sequel. They are back, so is the chemistry from the first one which is fun to see. They both act fine and give you the luxery of fine acting once again. Zeta-Jones has a bigger part than in the first film, which is ok, but feels a bit to large at some points. It is defenitly no punishment to look at, she is a fine actress, but her role gets a bit too much and a bit over the top considering Zorro is the main hero. But still, it is nice to see a woman in such a part where danger is lurking around the cornors. And hey: it's Catherine Zeta-Jones. A new comer to the family is the young Adrian Alonso, who plays the son of the couple. I must say that he does a nice job, but the director has given him to much attention. This attention makes the movie feel like it is ""Zorro Kids"" or something. This gives the film, sadly, an atmosphere that is far away from the first film. Some moments of course give you that same atmosphere as in the first one, but less powerful and it's less present. Another thing that is making the film less powerful than it's predecessor is that the filmmakers have aimed at the younger audience for a PG rating in stead of a PG-13. This means again that the atmosphere from the first one is hard to find. Some scenes feel very hold back. Also, while in the first film the horsejokes were okay and nice, here they go a bit over the top.Now a positive aspect next to the fine Banderas and Zeta-Jones combination is the action. Seeing Zorro doing all that spectacular swordfighting and athletic jumping sure makes your heart beat faster. Well choreographed fights which are well captured on camera save the film from it's downfall. It gives a great feeling seeing Zorro back in action again. Also the locations and sets are truely splendid and jawdropping. You can really see that the filmmakers have worked hard in making the film its look absolutely delicious. Talking about delecious: Catherine Zeta-Jones once again looks enchanting and very sexy for the male audience. The female part of the audience can once again catch their breathe while seeing Banderas being handsome as the masked hero.Also James Hornor is back for the soundtrack of the film. People who love the music from the first film will hear some famous themes return which gives the film a good ol' feeling, like stepping in some good old comfortable shoes. The score is nice but also feels a bit hold back which is a pitty.So expect an highly entertaining film with nice moments and cool action sequences. But while the younger audiences might love this picture with their entire heart, the older audience might find this entertaining, but nothing more. Still, the Legend of Zorro is way better than the average sequel and keeps itself standing firmely on it's feet.3 and a half stars out of 5.",3,Entertaining? Yes. Legendary?

The Polls have just closed and he is informed that he will not be able to vote. This doesn't stop him and he decides to steal the box of ballots because he claims that if California joins the Union, the half breeds will take over. Naturally, Zorro can't let this man stop the democratic process and he swings into action. Harrigan, the henchman, is a small cog in the nefarious plan of a master criminal. Is this master criminal trying to destroy California? Will he set off a nuclear bomb in the San Andreas Fault and allow half of the state to fall into the ocean? Will he send a select group of people into space to start a new colony while every living creature on Earth is killed by poisonous orchids? Is this a James Bond film or ""Zorro"" set in California in 1850?At various points throughout the film, it is difficult to tell.If you think the story for a film like ""The Legend of Zorro"" is going to make sense, you are in for a rude awakening.Director Martin Campbell and the screenwriters do manage to paint this preposterous story against a real historical timeframe in the history of California, but beyond that, the film smells like bad James Bond. Actually, the analogy is more than a little appropriate. Campbell directed ""Goldeneye"", one of the better Bond pictures, and will direct the upcoming ""Casino Royale"", starring newly minted Bond Daniel Craig (""Layercake""). If ""Legend"" is any indication, the new Bond will have an uphill battle.As the story unfolds, many of the trademarks of the Bond genre become evident. The `Pre-credit' sequence involving great stunt work and a character who will later prove prominent in the ""mad villain's grand scheme"". The mad villain's attempt to take over the world. Seriously. The villain isn't intent setting his sights on California, he has designs on the world. When a Count (Rufus Sewell) moves to California, from France, to open a winery, he is either a man with a great deal of foresight, or a man with a diabolically clever plan. I say the former. No French winemaker is going to move to California, in 1850, to make wine. When it is revealed that the Count is developing nitroglycerin to prevent...Whoops. I'm doing it again. Putting too much thought into the story. But really, all they needed to complete the picture was to shave Sewell's head and give him a white cat completing the parody of the famous Bond villain, Blofeld. He is already the head of a large, villainous group intent on world domination. Just go the extra few steps, Martin. You're almost there anyway.One of the things that made the first film so much fun was the chemistry between Banderas and Catherine Zeta - Jones. ""Legend"" picks up ten years later. Alejandro and Elena, their character's names, although that is unimportant, have long since married and now have a young son who ""doesn't know who his father is"". Both a wink, wink nudge, nudge reference to his father's secret identity as Zorro and a foreshadowing of life for kids in modern day California. Naturally, because the two leads fell in love in the first film, the filmmakers came up with the great idea of breaking them up in the sequel. They actually get divorced! Who in the hell came up with this brilliant idea? The last thing we want to do in an action sequel is to watch the two sexy leads fight and glower at each other. Bad move.Their son, who I'll venture is about eight years old, is easily one of the most precocious children to appear in film in some time. He always sneaks out of the  house or runs away from his school mates during a field trip, and naturally, he always ends up in the middle of trouble.The ""Zorro"" films were initially conceived as an homage to the Saturday afternoon serials which used to play, along with a cartoon and newsreel, before the main feature. Kids like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas grew up admiring the adventures of these heroes, eventually leading to the creation of Indiana Jones. Later, Spielberg's company developed the first ""Zorro"". Apparently, they had little to do with the sequel, and it shows throughout. The first film was more successful because it worked harder to make everything seem legitimate. The acting was good. Anthony Hopkins was in the original. His character was killed in the first film, so unless he appears as some sort of ghostly apparition, he can't be in the sequel. So the sequel falls on the shoulders of Banderas and Zeta - Jones. Banderas is a handsome man but he has never been a good actor. In the sequel, his emotions seem to flick on and off like a light switch. He walks around glowering, or drunk, or both, slurring his words, making most of what he says unintelligible. Zeta - Jones is a better actor, but this is not the type of film that will showcase her ability, allowing her to get a second Oscar. In the first film, the story was exciting and the action thrilling. In ""Legend"", both suffer. The James Bond - like story even goes so far as to create a henchman with false, scary teeth, ala Jaws in the Roger Moore Bond films. Both Banderas and Zeta - Jones have great difficulty making us care for their fighting `lovers'.The one place the film almost succeeds is in the action scenes. The finale set aboard an out of control train is fun. But even this seems clich&eacute;d and overdone. Any finale featuring a train is going to be an ""out of control train""; it would be pretty boring if Zorro could walk up to the engine and calmly put on the brakes. But even these sequences are marred by the many instances when you can tell Banderas' double is riding the horse or, worse yet, they used CGI to complete a stunt. Both are pretty bad, but the whole point of CGI is to create something that we wouldn't be able to see otherwise, to make it believable. If we can tell CGI is being used, it isn't working. Spend a little more time, a little more money to make it work.Catch ""The Legend of Zorro"" on DVD.

958603,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000CEXGAK,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 10]","`The Legend of Zorro's starts with brilliant action sequence, in which Antonio Baderas' hero fights the villains with acrobatic stunts. He does a somersault on a wall, ducks under a rushing horse cart, and lightly jumps on the scaffold. Director Martin Campbell, however, suddenly stops this fast and good pace, throws away the simplicity of the good vs. the bad, and opts for more complicated, heavy-handed storytelling.What you see after the hair-raising opening action is this. Zorro comes back from his `work.' His wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is waiting for him at home, but soon she begins to complain that he is not spending enough time for their son. Zorro talks back, saying people need Zorro. Elena would not listen. Zorro leaves the house, again to do his work.I know, the film is making fun of our accepted hero image. But do you still find it funny when Zorro really receives a divorce paper, and starts to act like a child before Count Armand (Rufus Sewell) Elena's new friend, and gets drunk too? I know there will be explanation, but hearing explanation (and waiting for it to come) is no fun. After all everything depends on what you want to see in this sequel to `The Mask of Zorro,' which, I thought, was full of tongue-in-cheek actions, but always put stress on actions. The sequel has good actions, but they are with something else like bickering Mr. and Mrs. Zorro.But what I didn't like about `The Legend of Zorro' is the way they treat a new character - a kid. Zorro has a brave and clever boy Joaquin, who doesn't know his father's identity. Sorry, but I don't believe it. Why not make him Zorro's partner? (That's more interesting and probably more likely to happen if Zorro beats his enemies like everyday). Though the acting of the child actor Adrian Alonso is very good (perhaps better than Banderas and Zeta-Jones), Martin Campbell misses every chance to make use of his talent. Why silly sword-fight in schoolroom (with his teacher)? Only at the end of the story Campbell finally allows him to do something better, but not enough.I don't write about the principal actors. I only say that they are still both good-looking, but look less radiant and fresh than in the first `Zorro.' That's inevitable, you might say.Yes, I agree, that is inevitable, and the original was made seven years ago. According to the inevitable rules of Hollywood films, the sequel is made with bigger budget and bigger concept, but except the well-made action sequences (editing by Stuart Beard) and gorgeous productions, I am afraid that the money spent is nowhere to be seen, and the confusing story is far from the concept of family picture.",2,"(2.5 STARS) Well-Mounted Zorro Delivers Good Actions, But Not Enough Sparks",1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,2655,"['Legend', 'Zorro', 'starts', 'brilliant', 'action', 'sequence', 'Antonio', 'Baderas', 'hero', 'fights', 'villains', 'acrobatic', 'stunts', 'somersault', 'wall', 'ducks', 'rushing', 'horse', 'cart', 'lightly', 'jumps', 'scaffold', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'however', 'suddenly', 'fast', 'good', 'pace', 'away', 'simplicity', 'good', 'vs.', 'bad', 'opts', 'more', 'complicated', 'heavy-handed', 'storytelling.What', 'see', 'hair-raising', 'opening', 'action', 'Zorro', 'back', 'work', 'wife', 'Elena', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'waiting', 'home', 'soon', 'complain', 'not', 'spending', 'enough', 'time', 'son', 'Zorro', 'talks', 'back', 'saying', 'people', 'need', 'Zorro', 'Elena', 'would', 'not', 'listen', 'Zorro', 'house', 'again', 'do', 'work.I', 'know', 'film', 'making', 'fun', 'accepted', 'hero', 'image', 'do', 'still', 'find', 'funny', 'when', 'Zorro', 'really', 'divorce', 'paper', 'act', 'child', 'Count', 'Armand', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Elena', 'new', 'friend', 'drunk', 'too', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'explanation', 'hearing', 'explanation', 'waiting', 'come', 'fun', 'everything', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'sequel', 'Mask', 'Zorro', 'thought', 'was', 'full', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'actions', 'always', 'put', 'stress', 'actions', 'sequel', 'good', 'actions', 'are', 'something', 'else', 'bickering', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Zorro.But', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Legend', 'Zorro', 'way', 'treat', 'new', 'character', 'kid', 'Zorro', 'brave', 'clever', 'boy', 'Joaquin', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'father', 'identity', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'Zorro', 'partner', 'more', 'interesting', 'probably', 'more', 'likely', 'happen', 'Zorro', 'enemies', 'everyday', 'acting', 'child', 'actor', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'very', 'good', 'perhaps', 'better', 'Banderas', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'chance', 'make', 'use', 'talent', 'Why', 'silly', 'sword-fight', 'schoolroom', 'teacher', 'Only', 'end', 'story', 'Campbell', 'finally', 'do', 'something', 'better', 'not', 'enough.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'principal', 'actors', 'only', 'say', 'are', 'still', 'good-looking', 'look', 'less', 'radiant', 'fresh', 'first', 'Zorro', 'inevitable', 'might', 'say.Yes', 'agree', 'inevitable', 'original', 'was', 'made', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'According', 'inevitable', 'rules', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'sequel', 'made', 'bigger', 'budget', 'bigger', 'concept', 'well-made', 'action', 'sequences', 'editing', 'Stuart', 'Beard', 'gorgeous', 'productions', 'am', 'afraid', 'money', 'spent', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'confusing', 'story', 'far', 'concept', 'family', 'picture']",N/A
958604,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000CEXGAK,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","THE LEGEND OF ZORRO begins seven years after THE MASK OF ZORRO ended. Zorro, Alejandro De La Vega (Antonio Banderas), is still fighting off bad guys and standing up for the average people of Southern California. California is on its way to becoming a state and Alejandro has promised his wife, Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that he will put the mask of Zorro up for good once California is an official state. It seems easy enough, but there are many people who don't want California to achieve statehood. Not only that, but De La Vega isn't as sprite as he once was and he has a son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso),who seems to constantly get in trouble, partially because of his absence of involvement in his life. After the people of California vote to join the Union, Elena believes Alejandro will put Zorro to rest, but the territory isn't officially a state yet. After a feisty argument, Elena and Alejandro separate. She seems to become involved with a French Count who has recently moved into the area and it infuriates Alejandro. There's a worldwide plot afoot to prevent California statehood and it's up to Zorro and his family to stop it.THE LEGEND OF ZORRO is a decent action-packed film. There was quite a bit of action and the train fight at the end is rather thrilling. I also enjoyed the fact that THE LEGEND OF ZORRO is a family-based film, in that the De La Vega clan ends up fighting together as a family. Banderas and Zeta-Jones do their roles justice and Alonso as their son Joaquin is a good addition to the brood.However, THE LEGEND OF ZORRO doesn't feel as fresh as THE MASK OF ZORRO did. That is perhaps that it took seven years to make a sequel to the first Banderas and Zeta-Jones Zorro picture. Banderas and Zeta-Jones are always red-hot and their chemistry on screen is sizzling. It seems to take awhile for the actors to get back into their characters and that affects the pacing of the movie. It takes time for the movie to pick up its pace, but once it does it turns into a roller coaster of a ride. Zorro fans shouldn't be disappointed and those who like action movies and modern westerns will probably enjoy this film, too.",4,He's Still Zorro,1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,2148,"['LEGEND', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'seven', 'years', 'MASK', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'ended', 'Zorro', 'Alejandro', 'De', 'La', 'Vega', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'still', 'fighting', 'off', 'bad', 'guys', 'standing', 'up', 'average', 'people', 'Southern', 'California', 'California', 'way', 'becoming', 'state', 'Alejandro', 'promised', 'wife', 'Elena', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'will', 'put', 'mask', 'Zorro', 'good', 'once', 'California', 'official', 'state', 'easy', 'enough', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'California', 'achieve', 'statehood', 'Not', 'only', 'De', 'La', 'Vega', ""n't"", 'as', 'sprite', 'once', 'was', 'son', 'Joaquin', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'who', 'constantly', 'get', 'trouble', 'partially', 'absence', 'involvement', 'life', 'people', 'California', 'vote', 'join', 'Union', 'Elena', 'Alejandro', 'will', 'put', 'Zorro', 'rest', 'territory', ""n't"", 'officially', 'state', 'yet', 'feisty', 'argument', 'Elena', 'Alejandro', 'separate', 'become', 'involved', 'French', 'Count', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'area', 'Alejandro', 'worldwide', 'plot', 'afoot', 'prevent', 'California', 'statehood', 'up', 'Zorro', 'family', 'stop', 'it.THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'decent', 'action-packed', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'action', 'train', 'fight', 'end', 'rather', 'thrilling', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'family-based', 'film', 'De', 'La', 'Vega', 'clan', 'up', 'fighting', 'together', 'family', 'Banderas', 'Zeta-Jones', 'do', 'roles', 'justice', 'Alonso', 'son', 'Joaquin', 'good', 'addition', 'brood.However', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'OF', 'ZORRO', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'fresh', 'THE', 'MASK', 'OF', 'ZORRO', 'did', 'perhaps', 'took', 'seven', 'years', 'make', 'sequel', 'first', 'Banderas', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Zorro', 'picture', 'Banderas', 'Zeta-Jones', 'are', 'always', 'red-hot', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'sizzling', 'take', 'awhile', 'actors', 'get', 'back', 'characters', 'pacing', 'movie', 'time', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'once', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Zorro', 'fans', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'who', 'like', 'action', 'movies', 'modern', 'westerns', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'too']",N/A

All I have to do is think about ""The Lost World"", ""Back to the Future 2"", and ""The Temple of Doom"" to reassure me that I can spend my time and money more wisely. However, when the special edition of the original movie comes packed with a FREE ticket... can you really go wrong?The ''Legend of Zorro'' retains a lot of the energy, humor, and style from the first movie and that is more than enough to actually carry the film. I was worried going in to this that without Anthony Hopkins, the movie wouldn't have an anchor. I'm glad to report that Hopkins, while he is missed, is not an essential part of this new Zorro Universe and that is key.The villians and story are ""just good enough"" to make sure this boat stays afloat while Banderas and Zeta-Jones do all the rowing. I'm sorry, but if you give this movie 1 star and are so bitter about it, you really must have a heavy heart... it's a fun-popcorn-movie!!I did have my share of misgivings I hope can be righted in the next film.Firstly, the balance of the cast is so good at general hand to hand combat [ie; children, women, peasants] that it does seem to undercut the heroic acts of Zorro. While viewing this one starts to get the idea that if ANY of the people in this film were wearing the mask, they too could be Zorro!!Secondly, while I had a great time with the action scenes featuring Zorro, there were actually too few of them and again, the ones that were here were laced with other people kicking-butt.Lastly, the writers seemed to try a bit too hard with the family dynamic. While on the one hand I can see them broadening the characters but on the other, it came off stiff and sometimes hollow.Still, I cannot say this was a dissappointment.

There are the downtrodden but honest Mexican peasantry, hoping for a better life in the US (very topical, asof this writing) when California joins the union. There are the bad guys, trying to overthrow the democratic process for personal gain. There's marital strife and redemption. There's alienation of father and son, also with redemption. There's the tension of Old World aristocracy against New World egalitarian spirit. There's Zeta-Jones proving that a woman can swashbuckle as well as any man. There's the discouraged but plucky little boy. There's comedy. There's way more here than can fit comfortably into most two movies. As a result, it comes across as a bit ditzy, never quite sure where it's going or even what it was doing a moment ago.Bandeiras and Zeta-Jones work beautifully in their roles as Zorro and his wife, and work beautifully with each other. There could have been a little more spark between them, I suppose, but it's not that kind of movie.

958611,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000CEXGAK,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[8, 10]","I saw this film in Imax the weekend it first came out, and I have to say, it is as every bit as entertaining as the first film: THE MASK OF ZORRO. I do believe everyone from the original, including the director, came back for this second installment. Thankfully.The film has all the elements of the previous Zorro film which made it successful, swashbuckling action, humor, romance and family. The only thing lacking is the tragedies that was in MASK OF ZORRO.This time around, Alejandro dela Vega and Elena are having marital problems. Elena wishes that her husband retire from his swashbuckling ways and give more time to their son, Joaquin. As usual, forces beyond their control leave Alejandro no choice but to continue as the masked one. Even Elena fell into the trap of fate when she is forced to go undercover for the (SPOILER ALERT)u.s. secret service to investigate a french nobleman who has been wooed by her beaty in the past. She is forced to divorce Alejandro to protect him.The people of California is also holding elections to become a state of the United States which a cult plans on stopping. The movie is like a period James Bond flick/family film. Young Joaquin has no idea that his father is in fact Zorro which is why he had grown more and more distant towards his sire.The action is terrific! The sword fights are amazing and well-choreographed, and the script itself is not flawless but quite fitting to the movie. The train scene is the highlight of the film and builds up to its climax. I give this 3 1/2 stars or a weak 4 stars because I think the original movie is a strong 4 stars. In THE MASK OF ZORRO, the stakes were more personal.To sum things up, it is a very enjoyable movie that's worth a second look. It is very entertaining, I only wish it came out sooner as a follow up sequel. I think this is the only reason it didn't do as good as the MASK OF ZORRO in the box-office. The first one was a box-office smash, I believed it came up short because it was too late. There are only a few franchises that can go over 4 years for a follow up sequel and still be a blockbuster: naming a feW FRANCHISES: ALIEN, TERMINATOR, and they're all sci-fi flicks.All in all, THE LEGEND OF ZORRO is solid entertainment.
