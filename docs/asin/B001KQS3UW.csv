1208622,A23Y42R52F1LM9,B001KQS3UW,Arch,"[1, 2]","I had this dvd for a while, but decided to do it today. I'm not a beginner to exercise. This was my first time working out with these trainers - Michael Carson, Steve Maresca and Stephanie Vitorino. I have done a workout, where Stephanie wasn't the lead. All three trainers are good trainers. They instruct good.I believe that a beginner can do these workouts. They may have to modify some of the moves and that's okay. As I have stated above, I'm not a beginner to exercise and these workouts had me sweating. I've gotten a good strength workout from all three workouts. The trainers have done moves that I have never done before. Although, I have been exercising for a long time, I can't do a full push up. I do them on my knees. Michael Carson has shown an easy way for people, like myself who can't do full push ups, can learn how to do a push up. I will definitely be practing that move and using it during other workouts.The dvd also has a 10 minute bonus workout. I didn't do it, but I will one day.I recommend this dvd to anyone that likes to do strength workouts and/or have worked out to all or any of the trainers other workouts and want to have another workout of theirs in their collection.",5,Great Strength Workouts,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1203,"['had', 'dvd', 'while', 'decided', 'do', 'today', ""'m"", 'not', 'beginner', 'exercise', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'working', 'out', 'trainers', 'Michael', 'Carson', 'Steve', 'Maresca', 'Stephanie', 'Vitorino', 'have', 'done', 'workout', 'where', 'Stephanie', 'was', ""n't"", 'lead', 'three', 'trainers', 'are', 'good', 'trainers', 'instruct', 'good.I', 'believe', 'beginner', 'can', 'do', 'workouts', 'may', 'have', 'modify', 'moves', 'okay', 'have', 'stated', ""'m"", 'not', 'beginner', 'exercise', 'workouts', 'had', 'sweating', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'good', 'strength', 'three', 'workouts', 'trainers', 'have', 'done', 'moves', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'before', 'have', 'been', 'exercising', 'long', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'full', 'push', 'up', 'do', 'knees', 'Michael', 'Carson', 'shown', 'easy', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'full', 'push', 'ups', 'can', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'push', 'up', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'practing', 'move', 'using', 'other', 'workouts.The', 'dvd', 'also', '10', 'minute', 'bonus', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'will', 'one', 'day.I', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone', 'do', 'strength', 'workouts', 'and/or', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'trainers', 'other', 'workouts', 'want', 'have', 'workout', 'theirs', 'collection']",Ultimate Body: Lose Weight Fast
1208623,A1GCVRAL5OORY3,B001KQS3UW,"Cereallover ""Cereallover""","[6, 7]","These workouts whether done separately or combined don't really get your heart rate up or burn very many calories. I worked up a sweat only because I was making every move harder just so I could feel like I was working.. Even for beginners, this is really ""false advertising"" but most are. All 3 workouts are very low impact & very slow, you will not be huffin' & puffin' during any or all of these. The instructors are good-  they explain all the moves well & they try to motivate. I would probably not recommend this to anyone looking for a calorie burning workout- I would recommend this to someone who maybe has an injury or doesn't want any high impact.",3,Probably not losing any weight with this one,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,658,"['done', 'separately', 'combined', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'burn', 'very', 'many', 'calories', 'worked', 'up', 'sweat', 'only', 'was', 'making', 'move', 'harder', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'feel', 'was', 'working..', 'Even', 'beginners', 'really', 'false', 'advertising', 'most', 'are', '3', 'workouts', 'are', 'very', 'low', 'impact', 'very', 'slow', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'huffin', 'puffin', 'instructors', 'are', 'good-', 'explain', 'moves', 'well', 'try', 'motivate', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'calorie', 'burning', 'workout-', 'would', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'maybe', 'injury', ""n't"", 'want', 'high', 'impact']",Ultimate Body: Lose Weight Fast

1208625,A1JEUIIB4NGWDO,B001KQS3UW,Mini Marshmallow,"[8, 9]","That's also the title of my favorite workout lead by one of my favorite instructors, Stephanie Vittorino. Her workout has 10 combinations that are packed with fun, new moves.  Suitable for the intermediate.  Not too fast pace.  You begin standing and work down to the floor, so you'll need lightweight (3-5 lbs) and a mat.  My favorite move was the standing plie with the pass through. A challenging move was the single leg deadlift into a balance position where you are holding weights.  Stephanie is encouraging and has such a sweet & lovely personality.  It's amazing how much is packed into 20 minutes!  You begin with standing and end on the floor with 3 types of sit-ups that are new moves (for me).  The creative ""rock n' roll"" abs and a full sit-up, which most likely was borrowed from Pilates. After watching Stephanie, you'll become a fan of hers soon enough.Besides, her workout--I look forward to working out with Michael Carson's ""Cardio Blast"" for 20 minutes.  He always leads a killer workout. This is fast-paced. He begins slow, then moves up to tempo, which is a major ingredient to his killer workouts.  Michael offers helpful tips and his cuing is superb.  Unfortunately, he can look very sweaty, but he's a very good instructor.  You'll do many reps, so I use only 2-3 lbs, plus you'll do sit-ups, so a mat is required.Overall, these are the only two workouts I prefer and that are perfectly suitable for my needs. I am very satisfied with this DVD, it's quite a good value for the options it offers.",4,FULL BODY SLIM DOWN,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,1520,"['also', 'title', 'favorite', 'workout', 'lead', 'one', 'favorite', 'instructors', 'Stephanie', 'Vittorino', 'workout', '10', 'combinations', 'are', 'packed', 'fun', 'new', 'moves', 'Suitable', 'intermediate', 'Not', 'too', 'fast', 'pace', 'begin', 'standing', 'work', 'down', 'floor', ""'ll"", 'need', 'lightweight', '3-5', 'lbs', 'mat', 'favorite', 'move', 'was', 'standing', 'plie', 'pass', 'challenging', 'move', 'was', 'single', 'leg', 'deadlift', 'balance', 'position', 'where', 'are', 'holding', 'weights', 'Stephanie', 'encouraging', 'such', 'sweet', 'lovely', 'personality', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'packed', '20', 'minutes', 'begin', 'standing', 'end', 'floor', '3', 'types', 'sit-ups', 'are', 'new', 'moves', 'creative', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'abs', 'full', 'sit-up', 'most', 'likely', 'was', 'borrowed', 'Pilates', 'watching', 'Stephanie', ""'ll"", 'become', 'fan', 'hers', 'soon', 'enough.Besides', 'workout', 'look', 'forward', 'working', 'out', 'Michael', 'Carson', 'Cardio', 'Blast', '20', 'minutes', 'always', 'killer', 'workout', 'fast-paced', 'slow', 'then', 'up', 'tempo', 'major', 'ingredient', 'killer', 'workouts', 'Michael', 'helpful', 'tips', 'cuing', 'superb', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'look', 'very', 'sweaty', 'very', 'good', 'instructor', ""'ll"", 'do', 'many', 'reps', 'use', 'only', '2-3', 'lbs', ""'ll"", 'do', 'sit-ups', 'mat', 'required.Overall', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'workouts', 'prefer', 'are', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'needs', 'am', 'very', 'satisfied', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'value', 'options']",Ultimate Body: Lose Weight Fast
