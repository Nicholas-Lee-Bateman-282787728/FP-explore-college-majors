But then again, the guide lists mostly the more provocative and controversial movies. I happened upon this one a while back and it was a pretty good movie. By now you've read how its the story about a young girl who ends up alone and all the different things that happen to her.I would not put it in the same league as Little Lips but it has a great plot.",4,Interesting,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,491,"['Was', 'surprised', 'was', 'NOT', 'list', 'Amazon', 'Kindle', 'book', 'titled', 'THE', 'DEFINITIVE', 'GUIDE', 'TO', 'GIRLS', 'IN', 'COMING', 'OF', 'AGE', 'MOVIES', 'Carl', 'Wo', 'then', 'again', 'guide', 'mostly', 'more', 'provocative', 'controversial', 'movies', 'happened', 'one', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'now', ""'ve"", 'read', 'how', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'alone', 'different', 'things', 'happen', 'her.I', 'would', 'not', 'put', 'same', 'league', 'Little', 'Lips', 'great', 'plot']",N/A

By turns, the aunt ends up leaving the girl herself, going off to travel with her boyfriend. The girl (whose name is never given), then tells the handful of people she has contact with that her aunt is there and things are just fine .... and in this way, spends the summer without her family or any adult care whatsoever.The story's about the character of the girl and the various thing she goes through while spending time alone, and with a small handful of others. This includes quite an array of experiences, many of them quiet, some fun, some painful, and all interesting to witness. The actress portraying the girl, Blanca Engstrom, is phenomenal, expressing an amazing range of feeling, all very honestly, and very subtley. The film is shot beautifully as well, and is lovely to watch in any case, as it's set in the environs of an old farmhouse outside a small town. The pacing is great too - it's a portrait, and for that reason slows us down to pay attention much as the girl herself does, while being interspersed with moments of greater activity, interaction, and emotion. Lastly, there were many moments that I could identify with from when I was that age - catching tadpoles, friends and peers, learning to swim, etc - part of what makes the story feel so genuine.A great film, I hope to see more both from the director and the actress.",5,gorgeous and moody,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,1542,"['Girl', 'beautiful', 'moody', 'tale', '9', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'parents', 'have', 'left', 'home', 'care', 'aunt', 'summer', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'humanitarian', 'trip', 'Africa', 'turns', 'aunt', 'up', 'leaving', 'girl', 'going', 'off', 'travel', 'boyfriend', 'girl', 'name', 'never', 'given', 'then', 'handful', 'people', 'contact', 'aunt', 'there', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'way', 'summer', 'family', 'adult', 'care', 'story', 'character', 'girl', 'various', 'thing', 'spending', 'time', 'alone', 'small', 'handful', 'others', 'quite', 'array', 'experiences', 'many', 'quiet', 'fun', 'painful', 'interesting', 'witness', 'actress', 'portraying', 'girl', 'Blanca', 'Engstrom', 'phenomenal', 'expressing', 'amazing', 'range', 'feeling', 'very', 'honestly', 'very', 'subtley', 'film', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'as', 'well', 'lovely', 'watch', 'case', 'set', 'environs', 'old', 'farmhouse', 'small', 'town', 'pacing', 'great', 'too', 'portrait', 'reason', 'down', 'pay', 'attention', 'much', 'girl', 'herself', 'being', 'interspersed', 'moments', 'greater', 'activity', 'interaction', 'emotion', 'Lastly', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'could', 'identify', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'catching', 'tadpoles', 'friends', 'peers', 'learning', 'swim', 'etc', 'part', 'what', 'story', 'feel', 'so', 'genuine.A', 'great', 'film', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'director', 'actress']",N/A

At the least this is a tale of a 9 year-old left to her own devices for the summer after the rest of her family goes to Africa as aid workers. There are many small tales and adventures, none of which lead to any serious or tragic consequences, thankfully, but we see our heroine progress thru a world of adults that at best is tragic and at the very least is ambivalous to the maturing of a young girl, in particular. This summer of exploration, among other things, shows and does not take advantage of the many adult indiscretions (including her inability to ""poop"") that fall her way (with the exception of enriching herself to the tune of 50 krone). And there's a beautiful final shot as ""fleckan"" looks at herself in a mirror and then just slightly looking at and acknowledging the camera.",5,Beauty and Elegance,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2013,921,"['beauty', 'elegance', 'European', 'films', 'can', 'imbue', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'line', 'not', 'embrace', 'least', 'tale', '9', 'year-old', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'summer', 'rest', 'family', 'Africa', 'aid', 'workers', 'are', 'many', 'small', 'tales', 'adventures', 'none', 'lead', 'serious', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'thankfully', 'see', 'heroine', 'progress', 'world', 'adults', 'best', 'tragic', 'very', 'least', 'ambivalous', 'maturing', 'young', 'girl', 'particular', 'summer', 'exploration', 'other', 'things', 'shows', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'many', 'adult', 'indiscretions', 'including', 'inability', 'poop', 'fall', 'way', 'exception', 'enriching', 'tune', '50', 'krone', 'beautiful', 'final', 'shot', 'fleckan', 'mirror', 'then', 'just', 'slightly', 'looking', 'acknowledging', 'camera']",N/A

1395382,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B004BE436I,Paul Allaer,"[10, 10]","I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library here in Cincinnati and I fell upon this movie. I took a quick look at the (scant) information that is on the DVD jacket and decided to take a flyer on this. Glad I did.""The Girl"" (2009 release from Sweden; 95 min.) brings the story of a 9 yr. old girl who is inexplicably left behind by her family (who are off to Africa for aid work) in the care of the girl's aunt. Turns out the aunt is a no-good drug and alcohol addict who within days decides to take a side trip with her boyfriend, but without the girl, leaving her ""home alone"", literally, but of a very different kind than the comedy with Macaulay Culkin all those years ago. The girl has the opportunity to tell on her aunt but decides not to (perhaps by intimidation from the aunt). At this point, we are only 30 min. into the movie, and the girl, left to her own devices, tries to cope as best she can. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, the young girl (whose name we never learn) is played by Blanca Engstrom and she brings an astonishing performance that is out of this world. Had this been a US movie, surely she would have been in the conversations for an Oscar (similar to Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis being mentioned this year as a possible Oscar candidate for her performance in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild""). Second, I will admit that there was a sense of dread over me once the direction of the story line became clear, and if that was the intent of the movie makers, they certainly succeeded. Third, the photography of this movie, in particular of the Swedish landscapes, is pure eye-candy. Last, the title of the movie is a bit generic (although faithfully kept from the original Swedish title). I think a more appropriate title would've been ""One summer in Sweden"" or somthing like it. But that last point is a minor quibble. Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a quality foreign film, ""The Girl"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"A very different kind of ""home alone""",1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2088,"['was', 'recently', 'browsing', 'foreign', 'movie', 'section', 'local', 'library', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'fell', 'movie', 'took', 'quick', 'look', 'scant', 'information', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'decided', 'take', 'flyer', 'Glad', 'did', 'Girl', '2009', 'release', 'Sweden', '95', 'min', 'story', '9', 'yr.', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'left', 'behind', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'Africa', 'aid', 'work', 'care', 'girl', 'aunt', 'out', 'aunt', 'no-good', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addict', 'who', 'days', 'take', 'side', 'trip', 'boyfriend', 'girl', 'leaving', 'home', 'alone', 'literally', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'comedy', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'years', 'ago', 'girl', 'opportunity', 'tell', 'aunt', 'not', 'perhaps', 'intimidation', 'aunt', 'point', 'are', 'only', '30', 'min', 'movie', 'girl', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'tries', 'cope', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'young', 'girl', 'name', 'never', 'learn', 'played', 'Blanca', 'Engstrom', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'world', 'Had', 'been', 'US', 'movie', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'conversations', 'Oscar', 'similar', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'being', 'mentioned', 'year', 'possible', 'Oscar', 'candidate', 'performance', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'Second', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'sense', 'dread', 'once', 'direction', 'story', 'line', 'became', 'clear', 'was', 'intent', 'movie', 'makers', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'Third', 'photography', 'movie', 'particular', 'Swedish', 'landscapes', 'pure', 'eye-candy', 'Last', 'title', 'movie', 'bit', 'generic', 'faithfully', 'kept', 'original', 'Swedish', 'title', 'think', 'more', 'appropriate', 'title', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'One', 'summer', 'Sweden', 'somthing', 'last', 'point', 'minor', 'quibble', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'mood', 'quality', 'foreign', 'film', 'Girl', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

Films like this don't get made in the U.S. because producers see little financial advantage in doing so. I ran neighborhood video stores for almost twenty years. Only a third of my customers would watch foreign films (probably less). This is what you call a quiet character study. The little lead actress is amazing, but kudos must be given to the director for his clarity of vision. It is a personal venture, much like an Ingmar Bergman film. In fact, the cinematography, by the gentleman who shot ""Let The Right One In"", is worthy of being compared to, my hero, Sven Nykvist. I am purposely not explaining the plot because the synopsis is available on IMDB. Americans call this an independent film, but that's the kiss of death.
