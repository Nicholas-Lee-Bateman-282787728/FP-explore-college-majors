I found in watching the play (DVD) that the characters played by Christopher Williams and Clifton Powell were actually switched when I saw it in my city. (CW played Clifton Powell's part) but I guess that happens some time. Again this was a great play, I'm a HUGE Christopher Williams fan, so with him as part of the cast was enough for me (lol)!!! everyone else did good too (lol)!!!

This play kept me tuned in the whole way through. A very unexpected twist which shocked me since usually as the audience we can see things coming.The cast is phenomenal. Very good acting. No over-the-top circus shenanigans. Many crack-your-side moments!
