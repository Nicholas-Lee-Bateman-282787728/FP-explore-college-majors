The pace is very slow, she speaks slowly and softly, and the jazzy ""burlesque"" music in the background makes elevator music sound like heavy metal.There's no actual ""workout"" here, either. The DVD is divided into topics, like  ""struts,"" ""bumps,"" ""grinds, ""kicks,"" ""shimmies,"" etc., and she demonstrates each in an equally slow, methodical way. The only chapter that might get your heart rate up is the kicks, but that's just a few minutes. Dolphina also covers the topic ""Boa,"" and the cool-down utilizes big feather fans. (Likely you don't have those handy or could pick them up at your local Sports Authority.)There's a segment called ""Routine"" that puts most of the moves together, but again, it's very low-impact and slow-paced, so unless you're grievously out of shape, don't expect your heart rate to budge.It was all fun stuff and easy to do, but the one part I found grating was the segment called ""Performance,"" where she indulges herself with an overly-long burlesque routine that uses a lot of moves not shown in the instructional segments. (Even if it did, the camera cuts make it almost impossible to follow or imitate.) Nice for the hubby, but I could do very well without it.All in all, it was surprisingly dull, pedestrian, and a bit self-indulgent. I really wanted to like it, which made my disappointment that much greater.",2,Disappointing,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,1450,"['positive', 'side', 'Dolphina', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'playful.On', 'negative', 'side', 'DVD', 'sleep-inducing', 'pace', 'very', 'slow', 'slowly', 'softly', 'jazzy', 'burlesque', 'music', 'background', 'elevator', 'music', 'sound', 'heavy', 'actual', 'workout', 'here', 'either', 'DVD', 'divided', 'topics', 'struts', 'bumps', 'kicks', 'shimmies', 'etc.', 'equally', 'slow', 'methodical', 'way', 'only', 'chapter', 'might', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'kicks', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'Dolphina', 'also', 'topic', 'Boa', 'cool-down', 'utilizes', 'big', 'feather', 'fans', 'Likely', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'handy', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'local', 'Sports', 'Authority', 'segment', 'called', 'Routine', 'most', 'moves', 'together', 'again', 'very', 'low-impact', 'slow-paced', 'so', ""'re"", 'grievously', 'shape', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'heart', 'rate', 'budge.It', 'was', 'fun', 'stuff', 'easy', 'do', 'one', 'part', 'found', 'grating', 'was', 'segment', 'called', 'Performance', 'where', 'overly-long', 'burlesque', 'routine', 'lot', 'moves', 'not', 'shown', 'instructional', 'segments', 'Even', 'did', 'camera', 'cuts', 'make', 'almost', 'impossible', 'follow', 'imitate', 'Nice', 'hubby', 'could', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'it.All', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'dull', 'pedestrian', 'bit', 'self-indulgent', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'made', 'disappointment', 'much', 'greater']",The Goddess Workout: Cardio Burlesque - Striptease

There are parts where you aren't moving enough to get your heartrate up, but other times you are shaking your stuff so hard your heart starts pounding. Dolphina does a good job of encouraging you to let your inner sexy come out, and while you won't be a burlesque expert when your done you will learn some moves that will have you feeling sexy. Her cute comments like calling your arms and hand ""diamond recepticles"" will have you smiling. Maybe this isn't the dvd for you if you are in good physical condition looking for an intense cardio workout, but if you are like me and are trying to get rid of the extra pounds while having fun, and maybe need to feel a little sexy once in a while then you will enjoy this DVD.

1112303,A340KVMHSQ9FG5,B000WVPXC2,Lauren Noelle Clarke,"[0, 0]","This was a well-produced video with good New Orleans-style music.  Dolphina is a true California Barbie doll and while she is not the world' greatest dancer, she is a fun instructor to watch and dance with.  She's very cute and makes little jokes, although sometimes you feel cheesy doing some of the moves (I only did about 2 of the dozen butt-smacks in the routine).  I gave her points off for calling this a ""cardio workout""--it is not, you will not likely break a sweat unless you are seriously out of shape or you are standing next to a woodstove like me.  There really is only about 40 minutes of dancing and throwing in a second routine or more combinations would've been nice.  Don't expect to come away with a choreography at the end, she mostly teaches you basic moves and gives stylistic points (I liked the bonus lingerie 101 section).  Overall I enjoyed learning a bit of ""belly dance's naughty cousin.""  It makes me want to throw on some lingerie and some raunchy jazz and surprise my husband with a little routine when he comes home from work.",4,"Not much of a workout, but cute and fun",1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1058,"['was', 'well-produced', 'video', 'good', 'New', 'Orleans-style', 'music', 'Dolphina', 'true', 'California', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'not', 'world', 'greatest', 'dancer', 'fun', 'instructor', 'watch', 'dance', 'very', 'cute', 'little', 'jokes', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'cheesy', 'doing', 'moves', 'only', 'did', '2', 'dozen', 'butt-smacks', 'routine', 'gave', 'points', 'off', 'calling', 'cardio', 'workout', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'likely', 'break', 'sweat', 'are', 'seriously', 'shape', 'are', 'standing', 'next', 'woodstove', 'really', 'only', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'dancing', 'throwing', 'second', 'routine', 'more', 'combinations', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'come', 'away', 'choreography', 'end', 'mostly', 'basic', 'moves', 'stylistic', 'points', 'liked', 'bonus', '101', 'section', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'bit', 'belly', 'dance', 'naughty', 'cousin', 'want', 'throw', 'lingerie', 'raunchy', 'jazz', 'surprise', 'husband', 'little', 'routine', 'when', 'home', 'work']",The Goddess Workout: Cardio Burlesque - Striptease
1112304,A38PO1LWTZ3QCM,B000WVPXC2,Pamela,"[0, 0]","I'm torn on this DVD. You have to know what you're getting your self into. It's good for a core workout, as it works your midsection and hips. I don't think it should be considered a cardio workout though. It is easy to follow, which is nice. This DVD could definitely be used by beginners (as I am one). I would use this in conjunction with your regular work out.The music. VERY slow and bland. Dolphia can be annoying with her pronunciations and performance. I gave it 4/5 for the fact that I would use this again.

1112305,A127IROWZNM255,B000WVPXC2,Rebecca E. Ratliff,"[0, 0]","I tried this DVD for the first time today, and thought it was alright.  Let me just go over the pros and cons...Pros:-I love dance-oriented exercise, so this was fun for me.  She teaches a lot of basic burlesque moves, and it didn't feel like I was working out.  As another reviewer stated, you aren't watching the clock while doing this.-It's easy to follow.  For those of you who don't have a background in dance, you should still be able to follow along with all the moves.  She does a good job explaining everything.Cons:-It's not a great cardio workout.  I felt my heart rate elevate a little during the Shimmies and Kicks sections, but other than that, it was mostly a workout for your hips and abs, a little bit of arms at times.  It may give a better workout for someone just starting to exercise, but I'm already in fairly good shape.  Therefore, this will be a DVD I use on the days I don't feel like working out, but know that I should, because it's definitely better than nothing.-Dolphina is very cheesy, in my opinion.  I found I had to kind of tune out her comments and just focus on the moves otherwise it would have annoyed me quite a bit.-The cool down.  First of all, after doing the Routine where she puts all the moves together, it then cuts to her bonus performance.  This is not a part in which you're supposed to follow the moves, it's just her showing off.  Why they put this at the end of the workout instead of just keeping it in the special features, I don't know.  So, you have to wait for about three minutes of doing nothing before you get to the cool down.  What's annoying about the actual cool down is she uses huge feather fans.  A boa is pretty readily available to people, but giant feather fans?  Not so much.  It just would have been nice if she'd made it so the viewer could do exactly what she was doing.So if you're in the market for a fun dance exercise DVD, and you're a beginner with exercise, this will be good, as long as Dolphina's cheesiness doesn't bug you.",3,A cheesy but fun workout,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,2007,"['tried', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'thought', 'was', 'alright', 'Let', 'just', 'go', 'over', 'pros', 'cons', 'Pros', '-I', 'love', 'dance-oriented', 'exercise', 'was', 'fun', 'lot', 'basic', 'burlesque', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'clock', 'doing', 'this.-It', 'easy', 'follow', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'background', 'dance', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'moves', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'everything.Cons', '-It', 'not', 'great', 'cardio', 'workout', 'felt', 'heart', 'rate', 'elevate', 'little', 'Shimmies', 'Kicks', 'sections', 'other', 'was', 'mostly', 'workout', 'hips', 'abs', 'little', 'bit', 'arms', 'times', 'may', 'give', 'better', 'workout', 'someone', 'just', 'starting', 'exercise', ""'m"", 'already', 'fairly', 'good', 'shape', 'Therefore', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'use', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'working', 'out', 'know', 'should', 'definitely', 'better', 'nothing.-Dolphina', 'very', 'cheesy', 'opinion', 'found', 'had', 'kind', 'tune', 'comments', 'just', 'focus', 'moves', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'annoyed', 'quite', 'bit.-The', 'cool', 'down', 'First', 'doing', 'Routine', 'where', 'moves', 'together', 'then', 'bonus', 'performance', 'not', 'part', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'follow', 'moves', 'just', 'showing', 'off', 'Why', 'put', 'end', 'workout', 'instead', 'just', 'keeping', 'special', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'So', 'have', 'wait', 'about', 'three', 'minutes', 'doing', 'nothing', 'get', 'cool', 'down', 'What', 'annoying', 'actual', 'cool', 'down', 'huge', 'feather', 'fans', 'boa', 'pretty', 'readily', 'available', 'people', 'giant', 'feather', 'fans', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', ""'d"", 'made', 'so', 'viewer', 'could', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing.So', ""'re"", 'market', 'fun', 'dance', 'exercise', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'exercise', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'as', 'long', 'Dolphina', 'cheesiness', ""n't"", 'bug']",The Goddess Workout: Cardio Burlesque - Striptease
1112306,A2Z27YMFF4FOT2,B000WVPXC2,Roses,"[24, 26]","This is such a fun dvd that gives you a great workout and an attitude adjustment! I have been blissfully enjoying this DVD - it makes me feel glamorous like a Pin-Up. I have been seeing Dita von Teese all over the news and am so excited that here is a DVD that teaches all her moves. Amazon wrote me the reminder email to send a review and I am so glad they did. I saw the other reviews about this dvd and I have to set the record straight: this is an AMAZING CARDIO WORKOUT!! I can't imagine that the people that said that it wasn't a workout even did the dvd! I begin to get warm during the first few sections: struts, grinds, bumps - feeling sculpting and a bit of a burn when we go into plie during some of the bumps. Then it goes into full cardio with shimmies & kicks & the routine. I can't imagine anyone not getting their heart rate going in these sections!! She teaches four different kinds of shimmies - and though I havent mastered the milkshake yet, it is fun to try! During the kicks section, she teaches Rockette- style kicks that make me out of breath!! As for the reviews that wanted bellydance...Dolphina says Burlesque originated from bellydance, but no where does this say it is a bellydance dvd...so what are they talking about?? In my opinion...this is a great dvd, providing a terrific workout, fun new moves I have never seen anywhere else and I feel that my attitude has changed when I finish...I am happy and light-hearted.",5,AMAZING CARDIO WORKOUT!! & great for Dita von Teese fans!,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1448,"['such', 'fun', 'dvd', 'great', 'workout', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'have', 'been', 'blissfully', 'enjoying', 'DVD', 'feel', 'glamorous', 'Pin-Up', 'have', 'been', 'seeing', 'Dita', 'Teese', 'news', 'am', 'so', 'excited', 'here', 'DVD', 'moves', 'Amazon', 'wrote', 'reminder', 'email', 'send', 'review', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'saw', 'other', 'reviews', 'dvd', 'have', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'AMAZING', 'CARDIO', 'WORKOUT', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'people', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'workout', 'even', 'did', 'dvd', 'begin', 'get', 'warm', 'first', 'few', 'sections', 'struts', 'grinds', 'bumps', 'feeling', 'sculpting', 'bit', 'burn', 'when', 'go', 'plie', 'bumps', 'Then', 'full', 'cardio', 'shimmies', 'kicks', 'routine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'getting', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'sections', 'four', 'different', 'kinds', 'shimmies', 'havent', 'mastered', 'milkshake', 'yet', 'fun', 'try', 'kicks', 'section', 'Rockette-', 'style', 'kicks', 'make', 'breath', 'reviews', 'wanted', 'bellydance', 'Dolphina', 'Burlesque', 'originated', 'bellydance', 'where', 'say', 'bellydance', 'dvd', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'opinion', 'great', 'dvd', 'providing', 'terrific', 'workout', 'fun', 'new', 'moves', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'else', 'feel', 'attitude', 'changed', 'when', 'finish', 'am', 'happy', 'light-hearted']",The Goddess Workout: Cardio Burlesque - Striptease
