Its plot would seem impossible had I not been recently told by a friend of mine of two people in Oregon that used to have pet bears back in the days of real woodsmanship (he knew them).  I don't want to spoil it for you, so you might want to skip the rest.A teenage brother and his teenage sister are living with their recently widowed father, an airline pilot recently turned bush pilot, in southeast or southcentral Alaska.  The sister loves the Alaskan life, and likes a local ""native"" boy.  The brother would rather be back in Chicago watching professional baseball.  Then dad attempts to fly some Amoxicillin on his four-seater to someone in need as a storm is approaching.  He crashes, alive but with a broken leg.The siblings, alone at home and through most of the film not always getting along with each other, lose radio contact with him, and set out on a search in which they encounter an orphaned polar bear cub caged for illegal transport by a pair of poachers.  The plot thickens, but I don't want to ruin it for you.Ever see Heidi?  I think this is where the idea of the ending came from.

The daughter embraces the new adventures and activities of the area; kayaking with a native friend, learning the area and tracking her dad's flights on ham radio - while the son fights the change wanting nothing more than to return to Chicago.The dad pilots an urgent flight to deliver medical supplies and is caught in a storm and crashes in the mountains.  After some search attempts to find him prove fruitless, the 2 kids decide to take matters into their own hands and set out to find and rescue their dad themselves.  They stop at a poachers encampment and find the skin of a mamma polar bear and a caged baby polar bear. They let the bear loose and go on their way, but the bear seems to see them as it's new parents and tracks them.  Meanwhile the poachers return to camp to find their cub missing and set off to recapture it.  So, now the kids are dealing with perilous wilderness, a bear cub, and poachers (who are not on the kids side).This is a wonderful adventure filled with peril and BEAUTIFUL scenery.

But it is also good family viewing because the scenery is terrific and the polar bear cub is very cute. Since there was never a conspiracy to keep the demographic identity of the target audience a national secret, those complaining about its lack of sophistication were just too lazy to check it out before actually viewing it. The film delivers exactly what it promises so there is no real basis for that kind of criticism.The editing is first class; especially on the canoe down the rapids sequence where the second unit stuff is perfectly cut into tight shots of the two stars. Thora Birch turns in another excellent performance and Vincent Kartheiser shows that even before ""Angel"" he modeled his acting on William Shatner (this is not a complement).There are a number of plot holes but nothing that really matters. One interesting thing is the scene where the bear cub helps in the rescue effort by pulling the rope with his teeth. Seldom can you point to a ""single"" stupid detail that drastically dumbs down a film but that is the case here.

And it may sound a little &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;unrealistic&quot; to some people but it's a movie that most kids will enjoy...even adults. ALASKA is about a brother and a sister who's family moved to a tiny island in Alaska after their mother died. Their father becomes a delivery pilot and goes off one day to deliver toliet paper, not knowing that there's a huge storm coming up (this is, of course, after the son and father just had a huge fight and after the son told the father he wished his father had died instead of his mother). When his jet plane crashes into the Alaskan wildnerness -  actually into a huge mountain - and the kids realize that their father is missing. Even though the police say he's dead the next day because they can't find him, the son insists that his father is still alive and goes out to search for him...followed by his sister, who at first doesn't agree with his searching but goes after him anyway, claiming that she's the only one who knows how to survive out there. Anyway, while out searching, the two kids meet two poochers traveling alone. They find the poochers' camp site and find the polar bear cub, who's mother had been killed by the poochers. After they set the cub free, the baby cub starts following them as they go on in search for their father.ALASKA is a really great film, although like in many kids' movies, it's pretty predictable. Still, the casting is great with excellent acting. Also, the setting of the film looks very realistic...the scenary for the movie is amazing! (I don't know if they actually filmed the movie in Alaska...but it sure does look that way!) So even if you don't really care much for seeing this movie, you should at least check out the scenary of the movie because the scenary is incredible!

Remember how sad that scene makes little kids? Well, the scene at the beginning of this movie, where little polar bear ""Cubby"" loses his mom, is even MORE traumatic than the Bambi scene. The poachers are cruel, one of them taunting the sad baby polar bear with the severed head of his mother. It is really awful. I kept finding myself crying at random throughout the movie, just thinking about it -- and I am an adult! Then later is another scene where little Cubby gets shot. It turns out to be just a tranquilizer dart, but at first it seems as though he might have been killed. I don't think this movie is appropriate for younger viewers, even though that's the only demographic I think would appreciate it.It's also misleading. The harshness of that terrain, the youth and inexperience of the main characters, and the various troubles that befall them (head injury, lost kayak, etc.) would have caused far more risky and life-threatening situations in real life than were depicted in this movie. Children should absolutely be spending time learning the skills to survive in the wild (i.e., learning how to live on planet Earth), but this movie fails to teach anything meaningful about primitive skills. For example, when they need to build a fire to keep from freezing, one of them even makes a joke of the idea of ""rubbing two sticks together."" Children can and do learn to make fire from such materials as wood, grass, and rocks. Many of the most important skills are not difficult, they just take practice. If these two children had known how to make a bow drill fire and a debris hut, their success would not seem so contrived and like Hollywood nonsense. You can see videos of children doing these things easily enough on youtube, for example on the channel 'primitiveskills' and many others. For this movie to make light of such skills and then provide the kids with a zippo lighter was nothing but deus ex machina and an insult to those who do take the time to learn and teach to children these skills.",1,Traumatic and misleading,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2206,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'review', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'plot', 'terribly', 'sad', 'scene', 'beginning', 'Bambi', 'where', 'little', 'Bambi', 'mom', 'killed', 'hunter', 'Remember', 'how', 'sad', 'scene', 'little', 'kids', 'Well', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'little', 'polar', 'Cubby', 'mom', 'even', 'MORE', 'traumatic', 'Bambi', 'scene', 'poachers', 'are', 'cruel', 'one', 'taunting', 'sad', 'baby', 'polar', 'bear', 'severed', 'head', 'mother', 'really', 'awful', 'kept', 'finding', 'crying', 'random', 'movie', 'just', 'thinking', 'am', 'adult', 'Then', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'little', 'Cubby', 'shot', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'tranquilizer', 'dart', 'first', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'viewers', 'even', 'only', 'demographic', 'think', 'would', 'appreciate', 'it.It', 'also', 'misleading', 'harshness', 'terrain', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'main', 'characters', 'various', 'troubles', 'befall', 'head', 'injury', 'lost', 'kayak', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'far', 'more', 'risky', 'life-threatening', 'situations', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'depicted', 'movie', 'Children', 'should', 'absolutely', 'be', 'spending', 'time', 'learning', 'skills', 'survive', 'wild', 'i.e.', 'learning', 'how', 'live', 'planet', 'Earth', 'movie', 'teach', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'primitive', 'skills', 'example', 'when', 'need', 'build', 'fire', 'keep', 'freezing', 'one', 'even', 'joke', 'idea', 'rubbing', 'two', 'sticks', 'together', 'Children', 'can', 'do', 'learn', 'make', 'fire', 'such', 'materials', 'wood', 'grass', 'rocks', 'Many', 'most', 'important', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', 'just', 'take', 'practice', 'two', 'children', 'had', 'known', 'how', 'make', 'bow', 'drill', 'fire', 'debris', 'hut', 'success', 'would', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'contrived', 'like', 'Hollywood', 'nonsense', 'can', 'see', 'videos', 'children', 'doing', 'things', 'easily', 'enough', 'youtube', 'example', 'channel', 'many', 'others', 'movie', 'make', 'light', 'such', 'skills', 'then', 'provide', 'kids', 'zippo', 'lighter', 'was', 'nothing', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'insult', 'who', 'do', 'take', 'time', 'learn', 'teach', 'children', 'skills']",N/A
