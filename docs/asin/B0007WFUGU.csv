892240,A2POKYHCNHPG8S,B0007WFUGU,ashford,"[4, 4]","I loved watching TP again. Hard to explain the appeal; you will see some of the worst acting, worst sets, worst effects, bad telecine and dodgy chromo-key on display anywhere in the 1970s. And yet...sometimes it looks fantastic, the stories are often original and engaging and the good acting performances definitely outweigh the bad. Most indefineably of all it has charm. Although there are campy moments (which can be enjoyed as such) it is the stories and the characters that hold the attention.I am intrigued by the removal of the commentaries. The UK boxes describe these as the funniest commentaries on DVD. Quite a claim but I think I might just agree. They are hilariously bitchy and embittered (time was not terribly kind to the TP stars after the show finished, well at least as far as their acting careers went). The comments on other actors and the production team are unbelievably cruel (but hysterically funny); and yes, ribald is the word. They are also very non-PC. At one stage you hear the sound of beer cans being opened (which might explain much) and not infrequently someone says ""that will be edited out."" The worst of the expletives are bleeped out but it seems that's about as far as the editing went.

892243,AVD35CXK3YY76,B0007WFUGU,"Christopher A. Richards ""kohntarkosz""","[3, 3]","For the uninitiated: The Tomorrow People was a classic science fiction show that originally aired on ITV in the UK back in the 70's. It centers around a group of young people (teenagers and 20somethings) who represent the next stage of human evolution. They have various telepathic powers, which they use to battle various sorts of evil throughout the course of the show.Now, you'll hear reports about the bad acting (especially during the first series, the actor playing Kenny in particular, was awful, and in fact never really did much acting after he left the show) and the dodgy special effects. But I think the creativity and intentions of the show ring through clearly and outweigh the downside.I think anyone who likes stuff like Doctor Who would love this show, as I've always thought it was fantastic. My only complaint is that they left off most of the audio commentaries that appear on the region 0 DVD's that were released in the UK. These commentaries, which feature the show's stars Nicholas Young and Peter Vaughan-Clarke are incredibly hilarious and frequently quite ribald (the latter might be why only The Slaves Of Jedikiah was used on the American release).

892244,A82JF1PZ2W40O,B0007WFUGU,Christopher Carpenter,"[3, 3]","If you were a fan of The Tomorow People from back in the days when it was shown on Nickelodeon, there is a lot to like about this four disc set.  Granted, by today's standards the sets look cheap, the special effects look cheesey,  some of the acting  is poor (Kenny, anyone?) but The Tomorrow People is still a lot of fun, and at times can be just as enjoyable as vintage Dr. Who (which this very much resembles). If you liked it then, you'll like it now.  But  I have one problem with this set, and it is a big one.  When the series was released on  DVD in the UK, a cast commentary was included on every episode and  those in the know have been commenting on how fun and entertaining these commentaries are.  I purchased a few of the R2 discs myself and can attest to the fact that the commentary tracks alone are worth the cost of the DVDs.  Unfortunately, for some reason the folks at A&E; Home Video have opted to include only the commentary on Slaves of Jedikiah,  the series one opener, and have not included them on any of the other stories.  A poor decision,  and one that prevents me from giving this my whole-hearted recommendation.  In fact, if you are able to play them, I suggest looking into  getting the UK editions which are also much more attractively packaged, instead of the R1 releases.Summing up:  Worthwhile stuff,  but packaged by dunderheads.",4,"Great stuff, but... a disappointment.",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,1368,"['were', 'fan', 'Tomorow', 'People', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'Nickelodeon', 'lot', 'like', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'Granted', 'today', 'standards', 'sets', 'look', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'cheesey', 'acting', 'poor', 'Kenny', 'anyone', 'Tomorrow', 'People', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'vintage', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'very', 'much', 'resembles', 'liked', 'then', ""'ll"", 'like', 'now', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'set', 'big', 'one', 'When', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'UK', 'cast', 'commentary', 'was', 'included', 'episode', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'commenting', 'how', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'commentaries', 'are', 'purchased', 'few', 'R2', 'discs', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'cost', 'DVDs', 'Unfortunately', 'reason', 'folks', 'A', 'E', 'Home', 'Video', 'have', 'opted', 'include', 'only', 'commentary', 'Slaves', 'Jedikiah', 'series', 'one', 'opener', 'have', 'not', 'included', 'other', 'stories', 'poor', 'decision', 'one', 'giving', 'whole-hearted', 'recommendation', 'fact', 'are', 'able', 'play', 'suggest', 'looking', 'getting', 'UK', 'editions', 'are', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'attractively', 'packaged', 'instead', 'R1', 'releases.Summing', 'up', 'Worthwhile', 'stuff', 'packaged', 'dunderheads']",The Tomorrow People - Set 1

Loria,"[0, 1]","Finally Thames Television's The Tomorrow People, the science fiction series that upon airing on NICK (belatedly in the early 80's), immediately hooked American audiences having discovered Tom Baker's Dr. Who. Like the BBC's popular sci-fi series The Tomorrow People followed a similar cliffhanger formula the show's first two seasons make their dvd debut in this four-disc set. The effects are quite dated but the premise remains sound: Average teen Stephen Jameson (Peter Vaughn-Clarke) learns he isn't so average when he meets the Tomorrow People"" other teen with the powers he shares. The pilot ""Slaves of Jedikiah"" features Stephen's ""breakout"" or the extreme panic and shock that ""Tomorrow People"" undergo when becoming aware of the new powers, like hear others thoughts through telepathic contact (the other more experienced teens feel that transmitting the panicked teens name over and over into his head will have a claming effect as they attempt to aid Stephen's transition into the next stage of human evolution. The Tomorrow People are Homo superiors and as such are part of the galactic community, which is nurturing the Earth's first telepaths through a policy of strict non-interference.

892253,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B0007WFUGU,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[35, 36]","I love THE TOMORROW PEOPLE.  This, with DOCTOR WHO and YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON TELEVISION(Go Moose!)were the staples that kept my world together back in the 1980's.  As to why... that's hard to explain. Anyone looking at the series today may be a bit put off by its low budget, often off kilter effects (early ""jaunting"" seemed to come across more like some disco acid flashback), ""this and that"" writing style (it's very obvious when the writers are padding out the middle episodes - and for a show that was supposed to be a simple adventure, they seemed to go through some of the most complex escapes I've ever seen... really, instead of jaunting or just walking through the door marked EXIT they opt for digging their way out through the center of the Earth with a rusty butter knife - NOTE: this DOES NOT happen in the show - but gives you some idea of how they work around the problem), and (sometimes) uneven performances and wonder what the ""big deal"" was.I guess you could say that, like the X-MEN, THE TOMORROW PEOPLE got it right with their target audiences.  Young teens, both male and female, wondering if there was something, anything, that made them special... and this show spoke to that.  Special Powers, a living computer (TIM), space travel, hyper space, time travel, aliens, robots - you name it, this show managed somehow to pack it all in and make it work each and every week.  There a number of positives to take from this show... empowerment, equality, friendships, trust, truth, respect for life - the show was heavy with lessons and values... and to be honest, it is also lousy with attitude as well.  As advanced as THE TOMORROW PEOPLE were - they also were rather closed minded.  Normal humans were called ""Saps"" - short for Homo sapains, which is fine, but it did seem to put the Tomorrow People above us (John's attitude towards normal humans always seemed to be a bit cold - and whenever it might seem that the Tomorrow People might be found out, he drags out his ""we'll be put in cages"" speech, which is funny since a majority of the aliens they meet in the course of the show often end up putting them in actual cages - so maybe he had a point all along), not alongside us.  They erased minds at will, often to cover their tracks in their adventures, and sometimes seemingly because they can.  There's an air about the show that sometimes smacks of ""we're better... much better than you"" - its casual, and you have to look for it, and while it is a bit dark (because the Tomorrow People are the next step in human evolution - they will replace us, and they will colonize the universe), it rings true - it's just unusual for a show to have this air (watch for this in THE BLUE AND THE GREEN - watch the message on screen, but then push behind it and just compare it to how the Tomorrow People live and operate).  I can't say there's anything more than what you see on the screen - but, then again, they're might be.Finally - we get ripped off.  While the UK Edition (Region 2) sports commentary on all the episodes - we only get commentary on THE SLAVES OF JEDIKIAH.  And while it's great... it does grate.  I, for one, would love to have heard comments from all the cast on the whole set, not just what amounts to a big tease from the producers of this set.  Also, I'm not sure who put the graphics together for this collection - but they seemed to have gone out of their way to remove ANYTHING that smacks of the show.  No CLOSED FIST, no OPEN HAND, even the font is alien to the series.  I don't know why this was done (the UK sets represent the show much better), but it (I beleive) actually makes you not want to look at it.  There's nothing to catch the eye, nothing to make it stand apart or even give people an idea of the kind of show inside.  Poor work.Excellent show.  I love it... I just wish the people who released here loved it as much as I do and gave us the whole package... bloody Saps...",4,HIS SPECIAL POWERS,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",2005,3934,"['love', 'TOMORROW', 'PEOPLE', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'YOU', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'DO', 'THAT', 'ON', 'TELEVISION', 'Go', 'Moose', 'were', 'staples', 'kept', 'world', 'together', 'back', '1980', 'why', 'hard', 'explain', 'Anyone', 'looking', 'series', 'today', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'low', 'budget', 'often', 'off', 'kilter', 'effects', 'early', 'jaunting', 'seemed', 'come', 'more', 'disco', 'acid', 'flashback', 'writing', 'style', 'very', 'obvious', 'when', 'writers', 'are', 'padding', 'out', 'middle', 'show', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'simple', 'adventure', 'seemed', 'go', 'most', 'complex', 'escapes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'instead', 'jaunting', 'just', 'walking', 'door', 'marked', 'EXIT', 'opt', 'digging', 'way', 'center', 'Earth', 'rusty', 'butter', 'knife', 'NOTE', 'NOT', 'happen', 'show', 'idea', 'how', 'work', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'uneven', 'performances', 'wonder', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was.I', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'X-MEN', 'THE', 'TOMORROW', 'PEOPLE', 'got', 'right', 'target', 'audiences', 'Young', 'teens', 'male', 'female', 'wondering', 'was', 'something', 'anything', 'made', 'special', 'show', 'spoke', 'Special', 'Powers', 'living', 'computer', 'TIM', 'space', 'travel', 'hyper', 'space', 'time', 'travel', 'aliens', 'robots', 'name', 'show', 'managed', 'somehow', 'pack', 'make', 'work', 'week', 'number', 'positives', 'take', 'show', 'empowerment', 'equality', 'friendships', 'trust', 'truth', 'respect', 'life', 'show', 'was', 'heavy', 'lessons', 'values', 'be', 'honest', 'also', 'lousy', 'attitude', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'advanced', 'THE', 'TOMORROW', 'PEOPLE', 'were', 'also', 'were', 'rather', 'closed', 'minded', 'Normal', 'humans', 'were', 'called', 'Saps', 'short', 'Homo', 'sapains', 'fine', 'did', 'seem', 'put', 'Tomorrow', 'People', 'John', 'attitude', 'towards', 'normal', 'humans', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'cold', 'whenever', 'might', 'seem', 'Tomorrow', 'People', 'might', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'put', 'cages', 'speech', 'funny', 'majority', 'aliens', 'meet', 'course', 'show', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'putting', 'actual', 'cages', 'so', 'maybe', 'had', 'point', 'all', 'along', 'not', 'erased', 'minds', 'will', 'often', 'cover', 'tracks', 'adventures', 'sometimes', 'seemingly', 'can', 'air', 'show', 'smacks', ""'re"", 'better', 'much', 'better', 'casual', 'have', 'look', 'bit', 'dark', 'Tomorrow', 'People', 'are', 'next', 'step', 'human', 'evolution', 'will', 'replace', 'will', 'colonize', 'universe', 'true', 'just', 'unusual', 'show', 'have', 'air', 'watch', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'AND', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'watch', 'message', 'screen', 'then', 'push', 'just', 'compare', 'how', 'Tomorrow', 'People', 'live', 'operate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'then', 'again', ""'re"", 'might', 'be.Finally', 'get', 'ripped', 'off', 'UK', 'Edition', 'Region', '2', 'sports', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'only', 'get', 'commentary', 'THE', 'SLAVES', 'OF', 'JEDIKIAH', 'great', 'grate', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'heard', 'comments', 'cast', 'whole', 'set', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'big', 'tease', 'producers', 'set', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'put', 'graphics', 'together', 'collection', 'seemed', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'remove', 'ANYTHING', 'smacks', 'show', 'CLOSED', 'FIST', 'OPEN', 'HAND', 'even', 'font', 'alien', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'UK', 'sets', 'represent', 'show', 'much', 'better', 'beleive', 'actually', 'not', 'want', 'look', 'nothing', 'catch', 'eye', 'nothing', 'make', 'stand', 'apart', 'even', 'give', 'people', 'idea', 'kind', 'show', 'Poor', 'work.Excellent', 'show', 'love', 'just', 'wish', 'people', 'who', 'released', 'here', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'gave', 'whole', 'package', 'bloody', 'Saps']",The Tomorrow People - Set 1
