No deep thinking, no real surprises...just a romantic comedy about 3 couples who can't quite figure out what the heck they are doing or what they want. The acting was okay, especially the actress who played Abby. She was very good. It was not nearly as funny as I remember ""When Harry Met Sally"" being, but then again, these actors are not Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan!I would not rush out to get this DVD, but if it lands in your lap, watch it.",3,100 minutes of just entertainment,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,583,"['suppose', 'would', 'give', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'rating', 'were', 'available', 'movie', 'provided', '100', 'minutes', 'entertainment', 'deep', 'thinking', 'real', 'surprises', 'just', 'romantic', 'comedy', '3', 'couples', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'want', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'especially', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Abby', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'funny', 'remember', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'being', 'then', 'again', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'would', 'not', 'rush', 'out', 'get', 'DVD', 'lap', 'watch']",Ira & Abby
1119171,A1MJ682JQH816G,B000YDOOPU,Chad A. B. Wilson,"[7, 9]","Ira and Abbey started off promising. It's funny and well written with a decent main actor in Chris Messina who was featured in a few episodes of Six Feet Under. And the supporting cast is really impressive--Jason Alexander, Fred Willard, and Frances Conroy, also of Six Feet Under (Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift SetFor most people, it's like an updated version ofWhen Harry Met Sally.... A neurotic Jewish guy and an extremely nice white girl struggle with love. This time, however, the couple jumps immediately--and I do mean immediately--into marriage. Then the trouble begins.The movie tells us that what we may view as a perfect marriage is really a sham of lies and false impressions. What we see as a flawed marriage may really be quite healthy in its own sad, resigned way. And the kids of these marriages have no idea what to think. They jump into the institution and get embroiled in therapy to help themselves cope.What allows Ira and Abbey to finally save their relationship from all of this turmoil? Well, I can't say becuase that would give it away. Let's just say, however, that this really is a modern retelling of When Harry Met Sally. Watch that movie now, and it almost seems quaint. Ira and Abbey isn't quaint, but it's almost stupidly radical. The solution to everything is so ridiculous that I almost hope people do not watch this movie and resort to thinking the solution may work for them, too.I still give it three stars, however, because overall, it's a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it throughout, for it's almost a refreshingly smart romantic comedy.

1119178,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000YDOOPU,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","""Ira & Abby"" pairs Chris Messina from ""Humboldt County"" with Jennifer Westfeldt from ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""  Westfeldt wrote the screenplay and delivers a quirky offbeat performance as Abby, a woman who sees the world differently.  Messina's Ira is a guy who has a lot of ability, but can't quite put the pieces together.  Both sets of parents also play prominently.  Ira's mother Arlene is played by TV's ""Who's the Boss"" star Judith Light.  Arlene's classy elegance and ice queen exterior is given depth and shading by Light's performance, with the scene in the recording studio being her best moment.  Robert Klein plays Ira's dad Seymore, a bit of a putts for a professional guy.  The film's relationships kind of mirror TV's ""Dharma & Greg"" with Ira's parents being uptown, wealthy and professional and Abby's parents being more the free spirit/hippy types.  Fred Willard plays Abby's dad Michael who does voice-overs for a living.  Frances Conroy who worked with Chris Messina on the last year of TV's ""Six Feet Under"" plays the hippy mother Lynne.
