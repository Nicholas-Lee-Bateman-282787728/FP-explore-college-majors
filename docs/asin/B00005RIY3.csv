679822,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005RIY3,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 4/08, 7/11Rate: 104/08: Sound and Fury is a definite improvement over the idiotic In the Land of the Deaf. There are many reasons to like Sound and Fury. One, I get to see a very healthy debate between two polarizing opposite groups about cochlear implants. Secondly, it's very open, and different types of people are involved: hearing child of deaf parents, deaf son of hearing family and a hearing brother, kids who are deaf but too young to make effective decisions on their own, parents who are deaf, parents who are hearing, young and old of hearing and deaf backgrounds and experiences, and individuals with hearing aids, cochlear implants, or no aids. In the Land of the Deaf is extremely limited and misguided because it fails to include a wide spectrum of different types of deaf people. In Sound and Fury, the base is covered, and I get to see deaf people signing, talking, and/or both. I mean, that's great, and that's what a deaf film is supposed to be all about. The best part of the film Sound and Fury is the core of the debate. The twelve minute segment from 28th to 40th minute is brilliant and absolutely fundamental to what the debate over cochlear implants is about. I can't even think anything more basic than that. You have this side; you have this other side; and you have the third side...combine them all, what's the answer? Even worse, think about how the daughter feels. Ever consider about how her feelings are being hurt because others are making decisions for her, but she is rendered powerless to decide on her own? Whoever is right or wrong is not the point here. What is absolutely essential to the understanding of the overall picture comes down to parents deciding what the best is for their child. Whatever the reason for the decision, there is nothing that people can do about it. Of course, hearing people may find reasons made by the deaf parents misguided while applaud the rational approach of the hearing parents when it comes to implantation of cochlear devices. The debate goes for centuries, starting with what is the best method of communication. Is it oral communication? Is it manual code? Is it total communication? Is it cued speech? What comes first in learning: English or American Sign Language? What are the long term advantages and disadvantages? The net result, at the end of the line, is not pretty at all. That's why doctors are hopeful about the future of cochlear implants because it makes sense, and it ensures a future for deaf children in the hearing world. I actually can go on and on for this topic and never reach the end of it because I know exactly how it feels to be deaf. I understand exactly what everybody is saying during the debate, and really, I can't just say that this or that method is the end-for-all. The issue is just too complex and deep to derive a simple answer out of it. Hey, how about that scene when the mother reacts to her son after her cochlear implanted son hears for the first time? That's priceless. Overall, Sound and Fury is a wonderful documentary that really does come across beautifully with the debate of cochlear implants for the deaf. It's easily one of the best documentaries I've seen. A very gripping, involving picture, when you watch it, you'll participate with them. As a by side note, when the hearing mother was describing her struggles in justifying her decision, she remarked that others' reactions were similar to taking her baby away and protecting it in the deaf world where the baby belongs. Come on...think about it. Rosemary's Baby, rings a bell?7/11: Sound and Fury is a definite `10' picture because it perfectly describes the long standing conflict ever since Alexander Graham Bell clashed with Edward Miner Gallaudet during the 19th century as described in the book titled Never Shall the Twain Meet by Richard Winefield. Fast-forward to now, especially in the 70's and 80's cochlear implants was a new technology aimed to save the deaf children from wastefulness of opportunities in the hearing world. But at the same time, its success rate was very low compared to now, and it had acquired a bad reputation for leaving visible scars of failed cochlear implants. Looking at the deaf people's reactions about the cochlear implants, it is obvious that they are thinking of that period of time which led them to permanently form such opinions. But today, let's face facts, cochlear implants is the in, and anything related to deaf culture and deaf identity is out. As I can see, parents, deaf and hearing alike, are controlling the fate of their deaf children, and the further the debate and arguments go on, the more the children are getting hurt and robbed of the opportunities. Time has been wasted. As cute as Heather Artinian is, I feel bad for her, but good news...she eventually gets the cochlear implants, and she is a success story (Google her name) who will attend Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. this upcoming fall. Her path is much easier and less fraught with stupid and time-consuming obstacles that many of the deaf persons including me had faced most of 70's, 80's, and 90's as well as before that. Cochlear implants, although hearing aids can too, allow children to grab the opportunity to speak, listen, and interact with hearing individuals. Take that away, and you will see a mute, signing dependent person who is drastically limited in the hearing world. That means the chance to be a well-rounded person with a chance to be fully educated, to have greater language development and maturity, to have the ability to gain a meaningful employment, and to create a successful life in a balanced setting. I know the real difference, and it is all that worthwhile. It's these narrow-minded pro-deaf individuals who can't see beyond the trivial issues and refuse to escape the sheltered deaf world and try to experience the richness that the hearing world has to offer. Although I know that it hurts a lot being in the hearing world, taking in the ignorance and lack of equality and acceptance, they must absorb the trials and tribulations and press on. Eventually, at some point, they will become the winners, and that is what makes it all worth it. All in all, Sound and Fury is, without a question, a perfect example of what is really going on in the deaf world.",5,Tells It Exactly It Is.,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,6317,"['Viewed', '4/08',

679823,A2HOLM5I1ARX9J,B00005RIY3,"Carol C. ""ccjello""","[10, 11]","This show begins when a fiesty five year-old deaf girl asks her deaf parents for cochlear implants, so that she can communicate better with her hearing friends.  As a hearing person, it is difficult for me to imagine why any parent wouldn't leap at the opportunity for their child to experience sounds -- but the deaf parents, even though they are clearly bright &amp; loving parents, are not at all eager &quot;to implant&quot; their child.  In the end, they decide to move to a community with a large deaf population so their children can appreciate &quot;deaf culture.&quot;  The girl's father has hearing parents -- and the girl's paternal grandmother is a huge proponent of implants.  Interestingly, the father's brother is married to a woman with two deaf parents.  (So there are two brothers -- one deaf with a deaf family, one hearing with a hearing wife &amp; deaf inlaws).  The brother and his wife, both hearing, give birth to a deaf son, and despite protest from the deaf members of the family, they proceed with the cochlear implants.  The decision causes a huge rift in the family.  Even in the hospital, after the surgery, the baby's deaf grandmother asks her hearing daughter, with a look of disgust, whether she would implant again if she were to have another deaf child.  Almost across the board, hearing folks supported the implants and deaf folks were staunchly opposed to the implants.  It's as if the implants are a slap in the face to the deaf population and &quot;deaf culture&quot;.  One thing that came across from the deaf people depicted in this show is that deaf folks are almos proud of their deafness, and they are clearly proud of their beautiful, expressive language.  They do not generally view their deafness as a disability, so they don't understand the need to cure or alter the condition.  The deaf parents who elected against the implants come across as good, caring, loving parents -- in a way that is difficult for a hearing person to understand.",5,incredible glimpse into &quot;deaf culture&quot;,1040428800,"12 21, 2002",2002,1987,"['show', 'when', 'fiesty', 'five', 'year-old', 'deaf', 'girl', 'deaf', 'parents', 'cochlear', 'implants', 'can', 'communicate', 'better', 'hearing', 'friends', 'hearing', 'person', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'why', 'parent', 'would', ""n't"", 'leap', 'opportunity', 'child', 'experience', 'sounds', 'deaf', 'parents', 'even', 'are', 'clearly', 'bright', 'amp', 'loving', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'eager', 'quot', 'implant', 'quot', 'child', 'end', 'decide', 'move', 'community', 'large', 'deaf', 'population', 'children', 'can', 'appreciate', 'quot', 'deaf', 'culture.', 'quot', 'girl', 'father', 'hearing', 'parents', 'girl', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'huge', 'proponent', 'implants', 'Interestingly', 'father', 'brother', 'married', 'woman', 'two', 'deaf', 'parents', 'are', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'deaf', 'deaf', 'family', 'one', 'hearing', 'hearing', 'wife', 'amp', 'inlaws', 'brother', 'wife', 'hearing', 'give', 'birth', 'deaf', 'son', 'protest', 'deaf', 'members', 'family', 'proceed', 'cochlear', 'implants', 'decision', 'huge', 'rift', 'family', 'Even', 'hospital', 'surgery', 'baby', 'deaf', 'grandmother', 'hearing', 'daughter', 'look', 'disgust', 'would', 'implant', 'again', 'were', 'have', 'deaf', 'child', 'Almost', 'board', 'hearing', 'folks', 'supported', 'implants', 'deaf', 'folks', 'were', 'staunchly', 'opposed', 'implants', 'implants', 'are', 'slap', 'face', 'deaf', 'population', 'quot', 'deaf', 'culture', 'quot', 'One', 'thing', 'came', 'deaf', 'people', 'depicted', 'show', 'deaf', 'folks', 'are', 'almos', 'proud', 'deafness', 'are', 'clearly', 'proud', 'beautiful', 'expressive', 'language', 'do', 'not', 'generally', 'view', 'deafness', 'disability', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'need', 'cure', 'alter', 'condition', 'deaf', 'parents', 'who', 'elected', 'implants', 'come', 'good', 'caring', 'loving', 'parents', 'way', 'difficult', 'hearing', 'person', 'understand']",N/A
679824,A21VGNU5959O85,B00005RIY3,CaterpillarGirl,"[1, 2]","I worked at a YMCA camp for many years, and one week out of the summer it was ""Hearing impaired week"" That meant that 98% of the campers were deaf, and the other 2% were usually hearing siblings. There were interpreters provided if we wanted them, and Hearing impaired counselors as staff. I always opted for no interpreter because it's much more fun to learn on your own. I now have (thanks to 10 summers of winging it) an extensive knowledge of Sign Language and I also had an insiders look to the deaf community that not many get. I used to see the campers who had Cochlear Implants get shunned, and that confused the heck out of me. I mean wouldn't you want to hear if you were deaf?This documentary Sound and Fury tackles that question, providing all of the points of view needed to make an opinion of your own. We have:*The Artinian family composed of Mom (Nita), Dad (Peter), Heather (who is 6) and two little brothers. The whole family is deaf.*The Parents of Peter, grandparents of heather who are hearing* Chris (who is hearing and is the brother of Peter) and his wife Mari (also hearing) and their three kids, two of which are twins and one of them is Deaf.*Mari's Parents who are both Deaf.Its one giant family saga, full of passion and confusion and hard decisions. Mari has the unique perspective being a hearing child to deaf parents, she KNOWS the deaf community, and in fact she had to have speech therapy because she learned her speech by mimicking her parents. Her parents especially her mother feel like she is betraying them because she doesn't want her child to be deaf. Peter grew up a deaf child of hearing parents and they didn't sign very well, he has embraced the ""deaf culture"" and never let go, he does not want his daughter to be implanted. Peter's parents want their granddaughter to have every available opportunity in this life and want her to get the implant. Heather, the 6 year old, is psyched to get the implant so she can hear music, talk on the phone, and hear cars crash (apparently she saw a crash once and now wants to hear one)She is full of life, lively, cute as can be, you want to just hug her! Her parents, decide to research the implant and the schools which heather will attend. They see that the implanted kids in school do not sign, they use their voices and implants only(which I think is wrong, you should teach them both). To them that is criminal and after seeing that some children with the implant still don't speak well, they tell heather she isn't getting it (and convince her that it was also her decision which is crappy) Peters parents are furious at him, even calling him abusive for not getting heather implanted. I wouldn't go that far, but I would say that they are too close minded and sheltered to let their child spread her wings. You can't isolate yourself, and the deaf community is realizing that.Mari tells her parents, and other deaf friends about getting her twin implanted (which is super brave of her) and they react with such hatred and vitriol I am surprised she made it out alive. They all signed ""Implanted"" very much like a swinging arm knifing the air and talk of all the implanted children become robots because they have the device in their heads was pure ignorance. Her mother whines and cries about how much she is afraid that the kid will make fun of her later, and what a horrible daughter she is.In the end, Mari gets her son implanted and Heather is told it's not going to happen, much to her chagrin. In my opinion it is horribly selfish for the parents of deaf children to want to keep their children behind, Heathers own parents did not have good educations (her mother cannot read beyond 4th grade) and her father admits that he has a good job but will never move beyond his position into anything higher. They are scared of losing heather to the ""hearing world"" because they are scared of what it means to them, not because of any concerns for heather and that's selfish. I do know that 6 years after the documentary is filmed  Heather gets the implant, as does her mother and two brothers, the father is the only one that doesn't, they might have seen how Mari's son did so well and realized the benefits. Heather apparently has amazing speech and has one foot in both the hearing and deaf communities as it should be.I came away from this with a better realization as to why those campers were shunned, and what the deaf community is so scared of. They don't think that deafness is a disability and that nothing is wrong to be fixed. I argue that both parties need to embrace the philosophy of ""Manualism and oralism"" which is that the child who receives an implant be taught both sign language and speech instead of one or the other. It makes more sense that way.",4,The Sign of the Times,1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,4763,"['worked', 'YMCA', 'camp', 'many', 'years', 'one', 'week', 'summer', 'was', 'Hearing', 'impaired', 'week', 'meant', '98', '%', 'campers', 'were', 'deaf', 'other', '2', '%', 'were', 'usually', 'hearing', 'siblings', 'were', 'interpreters', 'provided', 'wanted', 'Hearing', 'impaired', 'counselors', 'staff', 'always', 'opted', 'interpreter', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'learn', 'own', 'now', 'have', 'thanks', '10', 'summers', 'winging', 'extensive', 'knowledge', 'Sign', 'Language', 'also', 'had', 'insiders', 'look', 'deaf', 'community', 'not', 'many', 'get', 'used', 'see', 'campers', 'who', 'had', 'Cochlear', 'Implants', 'get', 'shunned', 'confused', 'heck', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'were', 'deaf', 'documentary', 'Sound', 'Fury', 'tackles', 'question', 'providing', 'points', 'view', 'needed', 'make', 'opinion', 'own', 'have', '*The', 'Artinian', 'family', 'composed', 'Mom', 'Nita', 'Dad', 'Peter', 'Heather', 'who', '6', 'two', 'little', 'brothers', 'whole', 'family', 'deaf', '*The', 'Parents', 'Peter', 'grandparents', 'heather', 'who', 'are', 'hearing*', 'Chris', 'who', 'hearing', 'brother', 'Peter', 'wife', 'Mari', 'also', 'hearing', 'three', 'kids', 'two', 'are', 'twins', 'one', 'Deaf', '*Mari', 'Parents', 'who', 'are', 'Deaf.Its', 'one', 'giant', 'family', 'saga', 'full', 'passion', 'confusion', 'hard', 'decisions', 'Mari', 'unique', 'perspective', 'being', 'hearing', 'child', 'deaf', 'parents', 'KNOWS', 'deaf', 'community', 'fact', 'had', 'have', 'speech', 'therapy', 'learned', 'speech', 'mimicking', 'parents', 'parents', 'especially', 'mother', 'feel', 'betraying', ""n't"", 'want', 'child', 'be', 'deaf', 'Peter', 'grew', 'up', 'deaf', 'child', 'hearing', 'parents', 'did', ""n't"", 'sign', 'very', 'well', 'embraced', 'deaf', 'culture', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'not', 'want', 'daughter', 'be', 'implanted', 'Peter', 'parents', 'want', 'granddaughter', 'have', 'available', 'opportunity', 'life', 'want', 'get', 'implant', 'Heather', '6', 'year', 'old', 'psyched', 'get', 'implant', 'can', 'hear', 'music', 'talk', 'phone', 'hear', 'cars', 'crash', 'apparently', 'saw', 'crash', 'once', 'now', 'hear', 'one', 'full', 'life', 'lively', 'cute', 'can', 'be', 'want', 'just', 'hug', 'parents', 'decide', 'research', 'implant', 'schools', 'heather', 'will', 'attend', 'see', 'implanted', 'kids', 'school', 'do', 'not', 'sign', 'use', 'voices', 'implants', 'only', 'think', 'wrong', 'should', 'teach', 'criminal', 'seeing', 'children', 'implant', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'well', 'tell', 'heather', ""n't"", 'getting', 'convince', 'was', 'also', 'decision', 'crappy', 'Peters', 'parents', 'are', 'furious', 'even', 'calling', 'abusive', 'not', 'getting', 'heather', 'implanted', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'too', 'close', 'minded', 'sheltered', 'let', 'child', 'spread', 'wings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'isolate', 'deaf', 'community', 'realizing', 'that.Mari', 'tells', 'parents', 'other', 'deaf', 'friends', 'getting', 'twin', 'implanted', 'super', 'brave', 'react', 'such', 'hatred', 'vitriol', 'am', 'surprised', 'made', 'out', 'alive', 'signed', 'Implanted', 'very', 'much', 'swinging', 'arm', 'knifing', 'air', 'talk', 'implanted', 'children', 'become', 'robots', 'have', 'device', 'heads', 'was', 'pure', 'ignorance', 'mother', 'whines', 'cries', 'how', 'much', 'afraid', 'kid', 'will', 'make', 'fun', 'later', 'what', 'horrible', 'daughter', 'end', 'Mari', 'son', 'implanted', 'Heather', 'told', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'much', 'chagrin', 'opinion', 'horribly', 'selfish', 'parents', 'deaf', 'children', 'want', 'keep', 'children', 'Heathers', 'own', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'educations', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'read', '4th', 'grade', 'father', 'good', 'job', 'will', 'never', 'move', 'position', 'anything', 'higher', 'are', 'scared', 'losing', 'heather', 'hearing', 'world', 'are', 'scared', 'what', 'not', 'concerns', 'heather', 'selfish', 'do', 'know', '6', 'years', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'Heather', 'implant', 'mother', 'two', 'brothers', 'father', 'only', 'one', ""n't"", 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'how', 'Mari', 'son', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'realized', 'benefits', 'Heather', 'apparently', 'amazing', 'speech', 'one', 'foot', 'hearing', 'deaf', 'communities', 'should', 'be.I', 'came', 'away', 'better', 'realization', 'why', 'campers', 'were', 'shunned', 'what', 'deaf', 'community', 'so', 'scared', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'deafness', 'disability', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'be', 'fixed', 'argue', 'parties', 'need', 'embrace', 'philosophy', 'Manualism', 'oralism', 'child', 'who', 'implant', 'be', 'taught', 'sign', 'language', 'speech', 'instead', 'one', 'other', 'more', 'sense', 'way']",N/A
679825,A36DJJ4Q8WSWFM,B00005RIY3,--corinne--,"[22, 23]","Can I give this documentary six stars?  It's that good.  It's a provocative story with even-handed treatment and thoughtful portrayal.The idea of cochlear implants is amazing- that people deaf since birth can have a device implanted behind their ears that enables them to hear. You'd think that this device would be embraced by the deaf community, but the reality is not so simple.This documentary follows the families of two brothers, one deaf and one hearing, who are divided over whether to have cochlear implants implanted in their deaf children.The deaf brother and his wife passionately identify themselves with being deaf.  They can read lips but cannot speak.  Their  misgivings grow over the consequences for their family if their four-and-a-half year old daughter receives a cochlear implant and is able to hear and speak while they cannot.The second brother and his wife, both hearing, have newborn twin sons, one who hears and one who cannot.  They feel their deaf son's life will be easier if he has an implant.This documentary is most riveting when following the conflict between the two couples and their own parents as they debate whether or not to give their deaf children cochlear implants.Profound socio- and psychological issues come to light over deaf and hearing identity and culture.High praise goes to the &quot;Sound and Fury&quot; crew who found this family who have three generations of hearing and deaf members.  Their different perspectives created a wonderfully rich dialogue that was a joy to follow.And much thanks to the Artinian family for generously opening your homes to us and making us think about both sides of this intensely personal debate.From a person who is new to the issue of cochlear implants I couldn't take my eyes away from this story.

679826,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00005RIY3,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[11, 11]","SOUND AND FURY, directed by Josh Aronson, takes a good look at the deaf culture and the cochlear implant, a device that poses a great challenge and [even] a threat to their interconnectedness, as a community.  The implant, if implanted in a deaf child, has the power to bring them hearing.  Potentially, if an implant recipient receives it early enough, they can even grow up to speak and interact with the hearing world in a coherent and connected manner.  Though, this sounds like a great miracle that all parents would potentially want for their children (especially deaf parents), this is not that case at all.The film follows the Artinian family.  The two Artinian brothers live very different lives.  While Peter was born deaf, went on to marry a deaf woman and has a deaf five year old daughter, his brother can hear, married a woman whose parents are deaf, but she is also hearing.  Together, they have twin boys.  One can hear, but the other was born deaf.  When the option of the cochlear implant is presented, the brothers react very differently, as do sets of grandparents.  In the Artinian family's community in Long Island, New York, the cochlear implant is a very controversial medical phenomenon.  For starters, the question of deaf people's perceived inferiority in the eyes of of hearing people is a huge issue.  The cochlear implant poses even greater leverage in the favor of the hearing world's sustained stereotype--that is the feeling that Peter and many of his friends in the deaf community share.  Whereas, Mrs. Artinian, Peter's mother, believes that denying a deaf child the opportunity to hear is wrong and not giving their flesh and blood the best opportunity to integrate into the hearing world, to have better opportunities. These opportunities would otherwise be denied.The title of this documentary, alone, really made me anticipate a very fiery debate on the cochlear implant issue, and I was right.  The separation between the hearing world and the deaf world is a great and difficult one.  I am so glad that this film was made because it was sensitively done, and it also teaches the viewer a great deal about the intricacies of moving between the world of the hearing and the world of the deaf.  It really is a huge cultural difference--bigger than you would imagine.

I don't know if this was coincidence or something to do with my service, but still ironic.One of the things that stood out about this movie is how polarizing both cultures were. The hearing parents & grandparents wanted hearing kids & thought it was abuse not to give children these implants. And likewise the deaf parents & grandparents thought it was not valuing deaf culture treating it as something inferior.I don't think there was a right or wrong answer just desires. I could see children growing up either way to be happy & functional.There seemed no middle opinion. I don't know if the producers wanted it this way or it simply happened this way.I do think it was very interesting to see both worlds & it would be a great value if more people learned sign language. Not so they could necessarily relate to deaf people but to understand a dimension of language that could make them more well rounded.***Spoiler*** Also the vast majority of the movie was in sound. Only the last few seconds were without sound. I think they could have used this more especially when the deaf were talking. They could have relied on subtitles at those points. In this sense the film seemed more tilted towards the hearing. And just to make sure people know I'm being objective Ive had perfect hearing all my life.Finally Id be interested in seeing a follow up documentary of both these children to see if there was any better or worse quality of life because of their parents decisions.Personally I'd be wary of the surgery as they had to peel off half the skin on the one son's head. Also the anesthetic couldn't be too good for brain cells. Just something to think about.Fortunately it seemed the results were pretty good.

For one thing, its emphasis is on the drama - the family conflict that erupts over a disagreement about whether a deaf child should be assimilated into the hearing world at the very real risk of being cut off from the deaf community (deaf culture, as its advocates refer to it in the film), including deaf family members. The argument at the center of the debate in the film is whether deafness is in fact a disability or handicap. For a hearing audience, the deeply felt belief among the deaf that it need not be will be an eye-opener. Yet because the arguments for both sides come chiefly from the members of one close-knit family, we don't get a perspective that professionals with some objectivity and wider experience might bring to the subject.Another factor was the decision to ""dub"" through voice-overs all the signing by those who are deaf in the film. True, many viewers do not have the patience to read subtitles, but the result is that you don't get the feeling that the deaf in the film are really ""speaking for themselves."" It begs the question of their being handicapped and subtly undercuts their opinions. Finally, as another reviewer here has pointed out, the film seems too intent on championing implants without fully disclosing the risks, especially among those for whom the procedure has been delayed during a crucial developmental period of language acquisition. Worth seeing for the interesting ethical issues is raises about so-called disabilities.",4,Hear me out . . .,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,1718,"['engaging', 'documentary', 'docudrama', 'closer', 'right', 'term', 'could', 'be', 'representing', 'subject', 'fairly', 'are', 'signs', 'potential', 'bias', 'should', 'make', 'viewers', 'question', 'drawing', 'conclusions', 'cochlear', 'implants', 'one', 'thing', 'emphasis', 'drama', 'family', 'conflict', 'disagreement', 'deaf', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'assimilated', 'hearing', 'world', 'very', 'real', 'risk', 'being', 'cut', 'off', 'deaf', 'community', 'deaf', 'culture', 'advocates', 'refer', 'film', 'including', 'deaf', 'family', 'members', 'argument', 'center', 'debate', 'film', 'deafness', 'fact', 'disability', 'handicap', 'hearing', 'audience', 'deeply', 'felt', 'belief', 'deaf', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'eye-opener', 'arguments', 'sides', 'come', 'chiefly', 'members', 'one', 'close-knit', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'perspective', 'professionals', 'objectivity', 'wider', 'experience', 'might', 'bring', 'subject.Another', 'factor', 'was', 'decision', 'dub', 'voice-overs', 'signing', 'who', 'are', 'deaf', 'film', 'True', 'many', 'viewers', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'patience', 'read', 'subtitles', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'deaf', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'speaking', 'question', 'being', 'handicapped', 'subtly', 'opinions', 'Finally', 'reviewer', 'here', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'too', 'intent', 'championing', 'implants', 'fully', 'disclosing', 'risks', 'especially', 'whom', 'procedure', 'been', 'delayed', 'crucial', 'developmental', 'period', 'language', 'acquisition', 'seeing', 'interesting', 'ethical', 'issues', 'raises', 'so-called', 'disabilities']",N/A
