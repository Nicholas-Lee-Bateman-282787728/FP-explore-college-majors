1342806,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B003F3NDP8,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season is definitely a solid and enjoyable season. The thing about Desperate Housewives, the first half of the season is always stronger than the last half. I am not really sure why that is but I still think this campy show is loads of fun! I loved the unexpected chemistry between Bree and Carl, too bad things didn't end well for one them! I also liked the storyline with that sensitive but deeply troubled, Eddie. The way Lynnette took him under his wing was quite moving even though she couldn't save him from hurting others in the process. But the one storyline that I thought was quite strange was the emotional collapse of Katherine, parts were good and others were a head-scratcher. Overall, season 6 turned out to be better than I could've hoped for. Can't wait for Season 7!",5,The best season.,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,825,"['Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'definitely', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'thing', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'always', 'stronger', 'last', 'half', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'still', 'think', 'campy', 'show', 'loads', 'fun', 'loved', 'unexpected', 'chemistry', 'Bree', 'Carl', 'too', 'bad', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'one', 'also', 'liked', 'storyline', 'sensitive', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'Eddie', 'way', 'Lynnette', 'took', 'wing', 'was', 'quite', 'moving', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'hurting', 'others', 'process', 'one', 'storyline', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'strange', 'was', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'Katherine', 'parts', 'were', 'good', 'others', 'were', 'head-scratcher', 'Overall', 'season', '6', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'better', 'could', ""'ve"", 'hoped', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '7']",Desperate Housewives: Season 6
1342807,A32NMAK31RVPQ8,B003F3NDP8,BR,"[0, 0]","I have watched Desperate Housewives for the last few years and have tremendously enjoyed the episodes. In Season Six the inhabitants on Wisteria Lane are back to regale us with their quirky and idiosyncratic behavior.Ominous and evil characters - the Bolens move into Wisteria Lane and take up the house in which the previous inhabitant had committed suicide. Soon things become sinister and people start getting 'bumped' off apart from beautiful girls who suddenly vanish. Susan Mayer's daughter, Julie, is hospitalized and Susan is left to grieve - bringing out Teri Hatcher's acting ability that is as flawless as she considers everyone to be.Lynette and Tom are expecting the stock to visit them and their children find it strange that their parents are ""still at it"". Later when Angie Bolen is in danger the surprising life-saver is none other than Gabriel, who puts her own life on the line.Unfortunately the extras with this sixth season are very few, which leaves the viewer 'wanting more'- gasping for more. That apart: Too many new characters and story-lines seem to have drowned out the lives of the main players. Let's hope that Marc Cherry creates a better ""packaged"" and juicier storyline in Season Seven.I do strongly feel that something should - read MUST - be done about the packing of the DVDs in Season Seven. Season Six packing left a lot to be desired. The flimsy middle partition that contained DVDs on either side is certainly not the best way to package DVDs. That aside Desperate Housewives Season Six is series worth possessing on DVDs.",3,Wisteria Lane inhabitants are back........!!,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,1562,"['have', 'watched', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'tremendously', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Six', 'inhabitants', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'are', 'back', 'regale', 'quirky', 'idiosyncratic', 'behavior.Ominous', 'evil', 'characters', 'Bolens', 'move', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'take', 'up', 'house', 'previous', 'inhabitant', 'had', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Soon', 'things', 'become', 'sinister', 'people', 'start', 'getting', ""'bumped"", 'off', 'apart', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'who', 'suddenly', 'vanish', 'Susan', 'Mayer', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'hospitalized', 'Susan', 'left', 'grieve', 'bringing', 'out', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'acting', 'ability', 'as', 'flawless', 'everyone', 'be.Lynette', 'Tom', 'are', 'expecting', 'stock', 'visit', 'children', 'find', 'strange', 'parents', 'are', 'still', 'Later', 'when', 'Angie', 'Bolen', 'danger', 'surprising', 'life-saver', 'none', 'other', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'own', 'life', 'line.Unfortunately', 'extras', 'sixth', 'season', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'viewer', ""'wanting"", ""more'-"", 'gasping', 'more', 'apart', 'Too', 'many', 'new', 'characters', 'story-lines', 'seem', 'have', 'drowned', 'out', 'lives', 'main', 'players', 'Let', 'hope', 'Marc', 'Cherry', 'better', 'packaged', 'juicier', 'storyline', 'Season', 'Seven.I', 'do', 'strongly', 'feel', 'something', 'should', 'read', 'MUST', 'be', 'done', 'packing', 'DVDs', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Season', 'Six', 'packing', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'flimsy', 'middle', 'partition', 'contained', 'DVDs', 'side', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'package', 'DVDs', 'aside', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Season', 'Six', 'series', 'worth', 'possessing', 'DVDs']",Desperate Housewives: Season 6

Lynette has to deal with her pregnancy and Bree with her affair with Karl Meyer, Susan's ex-husband. Gabrielle, now mother from last season, has another child to take care of, Carlos's neice, Ana, a troublesome teenager from the start.Meanwhile, the most troubled housewife probably remains the one that isn't one: Katherine. Having to deal with Susan and Mike's relationship, and her own failed one, she isn't someone to be called stable in this season for those who are fans of her.The show also introduces a new family onto Wisteria Lane: Angie Bolen, and interesting, historical last, name, fitting to the fiery spirit this mother has when protecting her family. Also included in this seasons wild showings is a plane crash right in the middle of the lane, and the reprecussions from that, as well as a mysterious strangler who begins to kill and hurt many of our girls.Definitely a great season not to be missed.",5,These Ladies Are Just Not Kidding Around,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,1084,"['Overall', 'really', 'great', 'season.Susan', 'so', 'much', 'drama', 'terrible', 'experiences', 'finally', 'happiness', 'again', 'remarrying', 'Mike', 'Delfino', 'show', 'regular', 'beau', 'Lynette', 'deal', 'pregnancy', 'Bree', 'affair', 'Karl', 'Meyer', 'Susan', 'ex-husband', 'Gabrielle', 'now', 'last', 'season', 'child', 'take', 'care', 'Carlos', 'neice', 'Ana', 'troublesome', 'teenager', 'start.Meanwhile', 'most', 'troubled', 'housewife', 'probably', 'one', ""n't"", 'one', 'Katherine', 'Having', 'deal', 'Susan', 'Mike', 'relationship', 'own', 'failed', 'one', ""n't"", 'someone', 'be', 'called', 'stable', 'season', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'her.The', 'show', 'also', 'new', 'family', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'Angie', 'Bolen', 'interesting', 'historical', 'last', 'name', 'fitting', 'fiery', 'spirit', 'mother', 'when', 'protecting', 'family', 'Also', 'included', 'seasons', 'wild', 'showings', 'plane', 'crash', 'right', 'middle', 'lane', 'reprecussions', 'as', 'well', 'mysterious', 'strangler', 'who', 'kill', 'hurt', 'many', 'girls.Definitely', 'great', 'season', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Desperate Housewives: Season 6
1342809,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B003F3NDP8,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[7, 9]","All things hit their peaks and then start sliding downwards. My personal guess is that they probably should have ended this show with Edie's death. What we seem to be doing in this season is just dealing with ongoing ""more of the same"" in the neighborhood. The characters have all had their days in the sun and are well past those days. There have been some new characters added but they haven't really added anything to the show. It seems as if they are trying to breathe some new life into this but they can't. Drea Matteo from the SOPRANOS is one of these. Hers is basically a one note performance of someone hiding out in the neighborhood from criminal mistakes in her past. Another is the stripper with the heart of gold (I wish I were making this up). I wish Mike and Susan had stayed divorced. The two of them now irritate me constantly. Terri Hatcher has become positively grating. The last best story arc this show had was Dave, the neighbor, married to Edie, who was trying to kill Mike and then Susan for killing his wife and child in an auto collision. When that arc of the story ended, last season, the air just went out of this whole thing. Tom and Lynette are now having yet another baby and it isn't doing a thing for me. That couple has completely lost their drift. I enjoyed Gabby more when she was plotting against her mother in law and having it off with the teenage boyfriend, not to mention trying to jump start her haute couture career again. Bree and Orson are now beyond soap opera cliche with him in a wheelchair. I think this show needed to keep a few ""evil"" characters, like Edie and Gabby, the way she used to be, and Dave. Now everyone is kind of a nice person with the usual suburban problems and it is boring. Every series runs out of gas eventually and I believe this is one of them. I must add to this that I don't think all of these series shows taking long hiatuses this winter, for virtually all of December and February, did them any favors.

1342813,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003F3NDP8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","""Desperate Housewives"", the popular ABC drama series (created by Marc Cherry, ""The Golden Girls"", ""The Golden Palace"", ""Amas de casa despesperadas"") which started back in 2004 definitely has gone through some major ups and downs with its dark comedy storylines to its complex marriage or relationship problems but if there is one thing definite about the series... its that the the fans love it and to keep the fans interested, the series went through a significant change for its fifth season.""Desperate Housewives"" is a series that had so many complex storylines that to even explain what has happened in the last four seasons would be difficult but if there is one thing that remains the same, it's our housewives.The premise of the first season was based around the death of fellow housewife Mary Alice Young (played by Brenda Strong, ""Everwood"", ""The Help"", ""A Plumm Summer""). Mary Alice Young is the narrator of the series and every episode, she has setup the sequences of what is going on in the life of her friends. And its the housewives of Wisteria Lane who have lived complex lives full of love, betrayal, pain and sadness.For the sixth season of ""Desperate Housewives"", the housewives have new problems this time around.  Susan has married her second husband Mike, once again, but Katherine is not taking it quite well.  Bree is having an affair with Susan's first ex-husband behind her current husband, Orson's back.  Lynette is doing fantastic at her new career working for Carlos but as she is making her career dreams come true, now she and Tom face a new challenge as she is pregnant with twins.  As for Gabrielle, life as a mother is difficult, especially now that she has to watch over Carlos' teenage niece Ana but to make things even more complicated, a former flame comes back and she also has to deal with the pressures of being a parent.  We are also introduced to a new family who has moved into the neighborhood and a new housewife named Angie who has a major secret.  Meanwhile, a serial killer is on the loose and his victims hit the housewives of Wisteria Lane pretty hard.VIDEO:""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions. ""Desperate Housewives"" looks very good on DVD. Outdoor scenes are nice and vibrant, blacks and low-light scenes do not have the excessive noise problems that some series tend to exhibit on a DVD release.For the most part, cinematography for ""Desperate Housewives"" has been excellent and the editing top notch. The series looks great and I can only imagine how beautiful this series would look on High Definition (via Blu-ray).AUDIO:""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and pretty much, ""Desperate Housewives"" has always been a dialogue-driven television show and is primarily front and center channel driven. For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable. The show uses minimal music and nor is it the kind of series that utilizes a lot of sound effects (the final episode has a little). For the most part, the setting I preferred to watch the series was to set my receiver setting and have stereo on all channels.The series includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and in French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:* ABC Starter Kit - If you hit play all on disc 1, you will get the ABC Starter Kit which briefly explains about what happened in the previous seasons of ""Desperate Housewives"".DISC 5:* Miss Piggy Gets Desperate - (10:40) Miss Piggy arrives on the set of ""Desperate Housewives"" and wants to be part of the cast of ""Desperate Housewives"".* Desperate Housewives Master Class - (13:04) The crew talks about challenges that the cast of ""Desperate Housewives"" have to face.  The cast talks about working on the series and how they became interested in acting.* Cherry Picked: Marc Cherry's Favorite Scenes - Featuring optional commentary, series creator Marc Cherry talks about his favorite scenes of the sixth season: An Indomitable Will (5:02), Niffit (3:45), Guess Again Big Boy (4:09) and Blanking Off (1:40).* Bloopers - (4:34) ""Desperate Housewives"" season six outtakes.* Deleted Scenes - A total of seven deleted scenes.EXTRAS:""Desperate Housewives - The Complete Sixth Season"" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:Last season, I felt that the ""Desperate Housewives"" reboot was necessary in establishing a new beginning for the Housewives.  As each housewife deals with becoming parents and the story now benefiting from the five year advance, I felt that creator Marc Cherry did what he can to help jumpstart the series.Season four had the housewives dealing with a tornado, season five dealt with a new beginning for the housewives and now season six continues that storyline of the housewives learning about parenthood, others dealing with new loves, lost love and this time, with a new mysterious family moving to the neighborhood.  To make things even more crazy, there is a strangler on the loose and people are now ending up dead.I felt with the reboot last season, ""Desperate Housewives"" has a new fresh start and I liked how they had the storyline of Susan and Mike together (these two deserve each other and I can't see them with anyone else) but we also got that creepy feeling with Katherine going a bit crazy when she loses Mike and is unable to cope with the loss that well.Last season, the relationship between both Gabrielle and her daughters were hilarious to watch.  To watch Gabrielle and her daughters together is just fun to watch because she's not exactly sure how to be a good mother and her kids, especially little Juanita is also fun to watch as she has Gabrielle's attitude.  And the addition of Ana proves to be quite interesting as Gabrielle kind of sees herself in the teenager.  And as the rambunctious children of Lynette were always focused on in the first two seasons, it was great to see Gabrielle and Susan have these parenting contests against each other.As for Tom and Lynette, we tend to see how the couple has faced various challenges throughout the years and we have seen how Lynette had wanted to get back into a career and now she is very successful until she gets pregnant again and now scared to find out what would happen if Carlos finds out.  Especially since Carlos depends on her daily presence and even moreso as he promotes her to VP.And as for Bree, less focus on the actual business and more is focus on her infidelity with Karl, her relationship with Orson and finding out that her dead husband Rex has another child.Throw in another housewife who has her own set of skeletons in her closet and you have yourself an enjoyable sixth season of ""Desperate Houswives"".Saying anything more will spoil the series but I feel that those who were attracted to the dark but yet enjoyable and fun storyline of the first season, can find enjoyment with the sixth season. For the most part, I enjoyed the sixth season but I have to admit that I was expecting a little more from the strangler storyline (since the first episode kicked off with it) and something a bit more dark and sinister but for what it's worth, the way they ended things was OK.Especially with the Bolen storyline, at first it seemed that there was something rather significant and I liked how the storyline went, but somehow the urgency started to dissipate and I felt that the way the series ended with the family was fine.Usually, for ""Desperate Housewives"", I'm used to seeing a finale that is quite explosive or shocking but this year, it was an average season finale but for the whole season, I actually enjoyed this season.  The storylines were highly entertaining, I liked how the writers utilized the supporting characters such as Mrs. McClusky, Roy, Lee, Bob, Julie, Ana, Robin, Lynette's kids, etc. and incorporated them to the episodes and once again, I enjoyed each episode a lot.  It's just that if people were expecting something shocking and something that would have them in awe, the shock factor wasn't tremendous but it was good.  If anything, I felt that the buildup to the plane crash episode was more surprising but it will be interesting to see what the writers have in store for season seven.As for ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"", the DVD set is a pretty solid release. I wish there was audio commentary for certain episodes like last year but there are none with this latest season DVD box set. But for the most part, you do get a few entertaining special features included and overall, it's another solid ""Desperate Housewives"" DVD release.If you are a fan of ""Desperate Housewives"", then ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Sixth Season - The All Mighty Edition"" is definitely recommended!",4,"Another entertaining and fun season of ""Desperate Housewives""!",1285286400,"09 24,

Each episode also features a unique story and many plot twists. Things get pretty zany after several seasons.

As much as the cast has changed over the years, things pretty much stay the same on Wisteria Lane.  Through it all you see the same petty back biting, shifty characters and malevolence characteristic of soap operas.  The show had a relatively promising start with the mystery surrounding the death of Mary Alice.  Of course, there was only so far you could take this, and her voice no longer carries with it much concern as she continues to watch over her little enclave.  In a rather desperate gesture, the writers have resurrected Paul Young, but there never was anything particularly appealing about him.

Season 5 was probably the weakest in my opinion although it did feature some extraordinary episodes luckily Season 6 is an improvement. There is good and bad in this season. The new family is pretty interesting however I feel a lot of the storylines were recycled much like season 5 and the show ultimately suffers without Nicolette Sheridans character Edie. The actresses are likely the best of tv especially Marcia Cross, Felicity Hoffman, and Eva Longoria they all truly shine but without the fire and ice of Nicolette Sheridan there is no confrontation and crack up moments between the ladies and its a shame since Sheridans character brought a much needed and appreciated brutal honesty to the series.

1342821,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B003F3NDP8,Kasey G,"[0, 0]","**NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**When viewers last left Wisteria Lane at the end of Season Five of ""Desperate Housewives"", a new family was moving into the neighborhood.Drea de Matteo (""The Sopranos"") plays the new housewife on the Lane. Angie Bolen is a brash Italian New Yorker who brings with her to the suburbs her twitchy husband Nick and son Danny. What would new residents be without some dark secret? Well, it seems Angie and her two men are hiding out from the Feds because of some terrorist activity in their past.The Bolen clan's arrival coincides with a rash of stranglings in Fairview, and the most recent young female victim is Susan's daughter Julie Mayer!At first I didn't care for the Angie character, but when things start really cooking in the second half of the season, I was really rooting for her and was sorry she won't be back next season.It was great to see Angie bail Bree out of a jam, TWICE this season. Another fun moment occurs when Angie gets some news about the person blackmailing her. That slight grin of satisfaction in the hospital was priceless!It was a welcome change to have de Matteo replace Nicollette Sheridan, because I felt Edie's slutty ways were getting old.Speaking of old, as the season began I was praying it was NOT Susan under that bridal veil. For some reason the writers seem to think all viewers want to see is she and Mike. I wish the pair of them had been written out of the show along with Edie. I was sick of their on-and-off again romance by the end of Season Three.Although I wasn't thrilled with the reunion of Susan and Mike, the good thing that comes of that is that Dana Delany finally gets some decent material to work with after a dull Season Five. It was interesting to see Catherine slowly unravel and I kept wishing she'd have more screen time. The developments with Julie Benz' character Robin were a welcome surprise.The season definitely got better as it went along and the many plot threads began to connect.As always, Bree and Lynette get the most interesting storylines. Gabby didn't annoy me this season as much as she has in the past. She was crucial in the outcome of the Bolen storyline, which took a very interesting turn at the last moment. I loved it!The Xmas episode is this season's attempt at the annual ""disaster/crisis"" episode. This year we get a plane crash. Of course, the best part about these almost-annual ""disaster"" episodes is how it changes the course of the plot and the after-effects on certain characters, and this season is no exception. I particularly liked how it got Angie off the hook with her blackmailer and put Lynette back in Gabby and Carlos' good graces.One of my favorite aspects of this show is the fantastic casting of the female guest stars. Past seasons have included turns by great ladies of Hollywood's past (Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin, Polly Bergin), amazing talent from other TV classics (Dixie Carter, Laurie Metcalf, Frances Conroy) and underused or forgotten gems (Celia Weston, Lesley Boone, Valerie Mahaffey). Though there was less of it this year, in the finale we get an unrecognizable Patty McCormack (""The Bad Seed"") looking uncannily like Louise Latham.We get to see what the child actors who originally played the Scavo boys during Seasons 1-4 look like now during a brief clip and another former resident of Wisteria Lane makes a surprise return in the finale.I didn't care for the unneccesary overuse use of the ""P"" word every time a character expressed how angry they were. Writers, please keep it clean--this isn't a cable show. While that kind of language is becoming more prevalent in society, the show would be much classier without it.Though it took a while to get things cooking, this season was much better than Season 5. The last four episodes are amazing, once the strangler is revealed (he reminds me of a young Alice Cooper).The bonus features include the usual bloopers, some short interviews with Marc Cherry, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Doug Savant, about a half-dozen deleted scenes, and Cherry's commentary on his favorite scenes this season.",4,"Takes a While to Heat Up, But Sizzles in the End",1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,4104,"['**NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS**When', 'viewers', 'last', 'left', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'end', 'Season', 'Five', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'new', 'family', 'was', 'moving', 'neighborhood.Drea', 'Matteo', 'Sopranos', 'new', 'housewife', 'Lane', 'Angie', 'Bolen', 'brash', 'Italian', 'New', 'Yorker', 'who', 'suburbs', 'twitchy', 'husband', 'Nick', 'son', 'Danny', 'What', 'would', 'new', 'residents', 'be', 'dark', 'secret', 'Well', 'Angie', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'hiding', 'out', 'Feds', 'terrorist', 'activity', 'past.The', 'Bolen', 'clan', 'arrival', 'coincides', 'rash', 'stranglings', 'Fairview', 'most', 'recent', 'young', 'female', 'victim', 'Susan', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'Mayer', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Angie', 'character', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'really', 'cooking', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'rooting', 'was', 'sorry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'back', 'next', 'season.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Angie', 'bail', 'Bree', 'jam', 'TWICE', 'season', 'fun', 'moment', 'when', 'Angie', 'news', 'person', 'blackmailing', 'slight', 'grin', 'satisfaction', 'hospital', 'was', 'priceless', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'have', 'de', 'Matteo', 'replace', 'Nicollette', 'Sheridan', 'felt', 'Edie', 'slutty', 'ways', 'were', 'getting', 'old.Speaking', 'old', 'season', 'began', 'was', 'praying', 'was', 'NOT', 'Susan', 'bridal', 'veil', 'reason', 'writers', 'seem', 'think', 'viewers', 'want', 'see', 'Mike', 'wish', 'pair', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'show', 'Edie', 'was', 'sick', 'on-and-off', 'again', 'romance', 'end', 'Season', 'Three.Although', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'reunion', 'Susan', 'Mike', 'good', 'thing', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'finally', 'decent', 'material', 'work', 'dull', 'Season', 'Five', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'Catherine', 'slowly', 'unravel', 'kept', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'developments', 'Julie', 'Benz', 'character', 'Robin', 'were', 'welcome', 'surprise.The', 'season', 'definitely', 'got', 'better', 'went', 'along', 'many', 'plot', 'threads', 'began', 'connect.As', 'always', 'Bree', 'Lynette', 'get', 'most', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'Gabby', 'did', ""n't"", 'annoy', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'past', 'was', 'crucial', 'outcome', 'Bolen', 'storyline', 'took', 'very', 'interesting', 'turn', 'last', 'moment', 'loved', 'Xmas', 'episode', 'season', 'attempt', 'annual', 'disaster/crisis', 'episode', 'year', 'get', 'plane', 'crash', 'course', 'best', 'part', 'almost-annual', 'disaster', 'episodes', 'how', 'course', 'plot', 'after-effects', 'certain', 'characters', 'season', 'exception', 'particularly', 'liked', 'how', 'got', 'Angie', 'hook', 'blackmailer', 'put', 'Lynette', 'back', 'Gabby', 'Carlos', 'good', 'graces.One', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'show', 'fantastic', 'casting', 'female', 'guest', 'stars', 'Past', 'seasons', 'have', 'included', 'turns', 'great', 'ladies', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Polly', 'Bergin', 'amazing', 'talent', 'other', 'TV', 'classics', 'Dixie', 'Carter', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Frances', 'Conroy', 'underused', 'forgotten', 'gems', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'Lesley', 'Boone', 'Valerie', 'Mahaffey', 'was', 'less', 'year', 'finale', 'get', 'unrecognizable', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'looking', 'uncannily', 'Louise', 'Latham.We', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'originally', 'played', 'Scavo', 'boys', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'look', 'now', 'brief', 'clip', 'former', 'resident', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'surprise', 'return', 'finale.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'unneccesary', 'overuse', 'use', 'P', 'word', 'time', 'character', 'expressed', 'how', 'angry', 'were', 'Writers', 'please', 'keep', 'clean', ""n't"", 'cable', 'show', 'kind', 'language', 'becoming', 'more', 'prevalent', 'society', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'classier', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'things', 'cooking', 'season', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Season', '5', 'last', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'amazing', 'once', 'strangler', 'revealed', 'young', 'Alice', 'Cooper', '.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'usual', 'bloopers', 'short', 'interviews', 'Marc', 'Cherry', 'Marcia', 'Cross', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Doug', 'Savant', 'half-dozen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Cherry', 'commentary', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'season']",Desperate Housewives: Season 6

1342832,A1AST89AHN17O7,B003F3NDP8,Omnes,"[0, 0]","It's not easy deciding when it's time to leave a show that you've been involved in for several years. But after watching the sixth season of Desperate Housewives on DVD, which I think didn't live up to the potential that was there in its first seasons, I just think it's time for me to leave the Lane. For after seeing the downhill quality in term of plotlines and writing, I just don't want to buy the last two seasons of a tragicomedy-satire I think should have been finished since its fourth season instead of becoming this daytime soap opera.Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the actors. They all did the best job with what they got, even Teri whose storylines became dull after the first season and made me think that Susan should have been the one to die from Zachary's gun in the Second Season Premiere. But as Marc Cherry became more interested in delegating his writing to other people while organising TV pilots (the failed Hallelujah and the upcoming Devious Maids) or a mini-series called Another Housewife, which is nothing more than an uninspiring, ridiculous and self-satisfied cell phone plug, I just think Desperate Housewives became a joke with rehashed storylines. For once again, we have Housewives cheating their husbands with other men, secret children, people trying to bribe their neighbors to escape their frustrating lives, a mystery, and of course a big tragedy happening in the middle of the season. Now as for the tragedy episode, it worked well when it was the Supermarket shooting or the Tornado, but as for the plane landing on the street, I felt this was over the top and made me wonder what would happen in the next seasons. Would we have aliens, zombies, Mecha Streisand (wait they did it in South Park)? Because by the time we get to the fifth season, we find out that this accident episode becomes nothing more than a plot device to get rid of dangerous or secondary characters that have no more use in the show, and to bring bigger ratings.As for the two mysteries in this season, I found them the only things that made the show worth watching. But of them, I found the Bolen, which was good, to be too separated from the other Housewives lives and I think it should have been instead an original series rather than a ""one season"" mystery. As for the mysterious strangler, I thought it was all right, but it should have been finished at the middle of the season instead of the final episode. And as for other Housewives storylines, Bree's were probably the most terrible as she has to deal with an adultery relationship that looked too much like a conventional soap opera, and a second one involving Bree's new employee whose situation is too similar to Kayla and becomes nothing more than a plot device to reintroduce a first season plot line that should have been dealt seasons ago: Andrew running over Juanita Solis in season 1. Not only that, I think it should have been Orson Hodge who should have had the chance to act more viciously rather than some character who only appears in this season. As for Lynette, her baby storyline that only happened in the awful ""If"" episode should have been instead a major plotline for the rest of her show since it would have allowed her to see her life turn into a new perspective and make her grow.On another point, I think the main problem the show had is that the Housewives' lives became separated and dull compared to the mysteries that secondary characters always got to do. To me, what made Mary Alice'S mystery worked so well was that the Housewives were involved in her life and so there was the possibility that they could have witnessed something that they never got to see before. Personnally, I think it would have been great if that show's mystery had opened a Pandora Box that would have revealed dangerous secrets in the Housewives' lives that would have become the main focus in the seasons, that almost everybody would have found out, and that it would have brought forth consequences as major to them as to what Mary Alice had to live.But unfortunately, it didn't happen. And so, I have come to see a show go from a clever tragicomedy-satire on suburbia to a dull complacent, and self-satisfied, day-time soap opera. Of which I don't want to invest myself anymore.It was good while it lasted but for me...So long Wisteria Lane.",3,It was good while it lasted,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,4339,"['not', 'easy', 'deciding', 'when', 'time', 'leave', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'involved', 'several', 'years', 'watching', 'sixth', 'season', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'DVD', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'was', 'there', 'first', 'seasons', 'just', 'think', 'time', 'leave', 'Lane', 'seeing', 'downhill', 'quality', 'term', 'plotlines', 'writing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'tragicomedy-satire', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'finished', 'fourth', 'season', 'instead', 'becoming', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'have', 'nothing', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'job', 'what', 'got', 'even', 'Teri', 'storylines', 'became', 'dull', 'first', 'season', 'made', 'think', 'Susan', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'die', 'Zachary', 'gun', 'Second', 'Season', 'Premiere', 'Marc', 'Cherry', 'became', 'more', 'interested', 'delegating', 'writing', 'other', 'people', 'organising', 'TV', 'pilots', 'failed', 'Hallelujah', 'upcoming', 'Devious', 'Maids', 'mini-series', 'called', 'Housewife', 'nothing', 'more', 'uninspiring', 'ridiculous', 'self-satisfied', 'cell', 'phone', 'plug', 'just', 'think', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'became', 'joke', 'rehashed', 'storylines', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'Housewives', 'cheating', 'husbands', 'other', 'men', 'secret', 'children', 'people', 'trying', 'bribe', 'neighbors', 'escape', 'frustrating', 'lives', 'mystery', 'course', 'big', 'tragedy', 'happening', 'middle', 'season', 'Now', 'tragedy', 'episode', 'worked', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'Supermarket', 'shooting', 'Tornado', 'plane', 'landing', 'street', 'felt', 'was', 'top', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'seasons', 'Would', 'have', 'aliens', 'zombies', 'Mecha', 'Streisand', 'did', 'South', 'Park', 'time', 'get', 'fifth', 'season', 'find', 'out', 'accident', 'episode', 'nothing', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'get', 'rid', 'dangerous', 'secondary', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'use', 'show', 'bring', 'bigger', 'ratings.As', 'two', 'mysteries', 'season', 'found', 'only', 'things', 'made', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'found', 'Bolen', 'was', 'good', 'be', 'too', 'separated', 'other', 'Housewives', 'lives', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'instead', 'original', 'series', 'rather', 'one', 'season', 'mystery', 'mysterious', 'strangler', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'finished', 'middle', 'season', 'instead', 'final', 'episode', 'other', 'Housewives', 'storylines', 'Bree', 'were', 'probably', 'most', 'terrible', 'deal', 'adultery', 'relationship', 'looked', 'too', 'much', 'conventional', 'soap', 'opera', 'second', 'one', 'involving', 'Bree', 'new', 'employee', 'situation', 'too', 'similar', 'Kayla', 'nothing', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'reintroduce', 'first', 'season', 'plot', 'line', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'seasons', 'Andrew', 'running', 'over', 'Juanita', 'Solis', 'season', '1', 'Not', 'only', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Orson', 'Hodge', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'act', 'more', 'viciously', 'rather', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'season', 'Lynette', 'baby', 'storyline', 'only', 'happened', 'awful', 'episode', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'instead', 'major', 'plotline', 'rest', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'see', 'life', 'turn', 'new', 'perspective', 'make', 'grow.On', 'point', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'show', 'had', 'Housewives', 'lives', 'became', 'separated', 'dull', 'compared', 'mysteries', 'secondary', 'characters', 'always', 'got', 'do', 'what', 'made', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'mystery', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'Housewives', 'were', 'involved', 'life', 'so', 'was', 'possibility', 'could', 'have', 'witnessed', 'something', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'Personnally', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'show', 'mystery', 'had', 'opened', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'would', 'have', 'revealed', 'dangerous', 'secrets', 'Housewives', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'main', 'focus', 'seasons', 'almost', 'everybody', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'forth', 'consequences', 'major', 'what', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'had', 'live.But', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'so', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'show', 'go', 'clever', 'tragicomedy-satire', 'suburbia', 'dull', 'complacent', 'self-satisfied', 'day-time', 'soap', 'opera', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'invest', 'anymore.It', 'was', 'good', 'lasted', 'So', 'long', 'Wisteria', 'Lane']",Desperate Housewives: Season 6
