1012036,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000HC2M0C,Anton Ilinski,"[5, 9]","I have mixed feelings about ""The Gathering"". On one hand it looked like a decent religious thriller dwelling somewhere between ""The Omen"", ""Stigmata"" and ""The Body"". The premise was pretty nice and promising, on the other - unfortunately the implementation appeared rather lame.Cristina Ricci's character Cassie is hit by a car in a rural British town and stays for a while to recover in the house of a woman who had hit her. At the same time an ancient church is excavated just outside the city limits. Old altar is decorated with a crucifix and a bas-relief of many faces surrounding it - the so called Gathering - people who came to watch Christ die not to mourn or protest, just to stare idly. Soon Cassie starts seeing these faces on the streets of the town, and a local clergyman makes a discovery - he sees the same faces on old photographs and footage which depict most dramatic and tragic occurences in the history - World War 2, Ku Klux Klan executions, JFK assassination...I think you'll agree it sounds quite interesting, but the makers of the film couldn't squeeze everything that was possible out of this story. The movie lasts for about 80 minutes but the beginning is still pretty slow and I'd say even dull, seems like this story goes nowhere. Little by little it stars developing and goes a bit quicker, but still I can't say the action was all that thrilling and intense which is essential for this kind of flicks. Nevertheless I can't say the picture was totally ruined for me. It had its nice parts, no major scary moments though. In general there were some flaws that distracted my attention as a viewer - for example I was asking myself: why Cassie behaves like she's been friends with these people for years (I mean people whose house she's staying in) if she just lived there for two days? Questions like these emerge from time to time making the whole picture look pretty amateur although it's not.""The Gathering"" is professionally and beautifully shot, the settings are great and picturesque albeit the film's content doesn't quite live up to it. The acting was the second thing that disappointed me it was rather lame or careless I'd say. Cristina Ricci as a main attraction here is acting fine as always, on her usual level, only she's not that girl who had something to look at anymore :) After she lost weight she looks just like anybody else and that's a pity.",3,"NICE STORY, MEDIOCRE EXECUTION",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,2392,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Gathering', 'one', 'hand', 'looked', 'decent', 'religious', 'thriller', 'dwelling', 'somewhere', 'Omen', 'Stigmata', 'Body', 'premise', 'was', 'pretty', 'nice', 'promising', 'other', 'unfortunately', 'implementation', 'appeared', 'rather', 'lame.Cristina', 'Ricci', 'character', 'Cassie', 'hit', 'car', 'rural', 'British', 'town', 'stays', 'while', 'recover', 'house', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'hit', 'same', 'time', 'ancient', 'church', 'excavated', 'just', 'city', 'limits', 'Old', 'altar', 'decorated', 'crucifix', 'bas-relief', 'many', 'surrounding', 'so', 'called', 'Gathering', 'people', 'who', 'came', 'watch', 'Christ', 'die', 'not', 'mourn', 'protest', 'just', 'stare', 'idly', 'Soon', 'Cassie', 'seeing', 'streets', 'town', 'local', 'clergyman', 'discovery', 'same', 'old', 'photographs', 'footage', 'most', 'dramatic', 'tragic', 'occurences', 'history', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'executions', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'quite', 'interesting', 'makers', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'squeeze', 'everything', 'was', 'possible', 'story', 'movie', '80', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'still', 'pretty', 'slow', ""'d"", 'say', 'even', 'dull', 'story', 'nowhere', 'Little', 'little', 'developing', 'bit', 'quicker', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'action', 'was', 'thrilling', 'intense', 'essential', 'kind', 'flicks', 'Nevertheless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'picture', 'was', 'totally', 'ruined', 'had', 'nice', 'parts', 'major', 'scary', 'moments', 'general', 'were', 'flaws', 'distracted', 'attention', 'viewer', 'example', 'was', 'asking', 'why', 'Cassie', 'been', 'friends', 'people', 'years', 'mean', 'people', 'house', 'staying', 'just', 'lived', 'two', 'days', 'Questions', 'emerge', 'time', 'time', 'making', 'whole', 'picture', 'look', 'pretty', 'amateur', 'not', 'Gathering', 'professionally', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'settings', 'are', 'great', 'picturesque', 'film', 'content', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'acting', 'was', 'second', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'was', 'rather', 'lame', 'careless', ""'d"", 'say', 'Cristina', 'Ricci', 'main', 'attraction', 'here', 'acting', 'fine', 'always', 'usual', 'level', 'only', 'not', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'something', 'look', 'anymore', 'lost', 'weight', 'just', 'anybody', 'else', 'pity']",N/A

In ""The Gathering,"" it's the Church of England. So take THAT, Vicar of Dibley!Christina Ricci plays Cassie, an American-accented gal wandering around the English countryside for some reason, who pops out of a roadside hedgerow and gets plowed into by a BWM. Miraculously (or ominously?), Cassie survives with just a bump on her head - plus a plot-driving case of amnesia - and gets offered a job by the BMW's driver, who was probably terrified of getting sued if she didn't offer Cassie something. I suspect this is also how Christina Ricci landed her role in this movie. Down and out in Hollywood? Throw yourself in front of a BWM and hope there's a casting director at the wheel.In between not remembering stuff and taking care of the BWM lady's kids (her compensation for getting run over), Cassie has freaky premonitions, gets barked at by a spooky dog, makes friends with the stretchy guy from ""Fantastic 4"", and winds up intertwined with an ancient churchy cover-up which, coincidentally, is also being investigated by the BMW lady's art professor husband. Eventually, it all comes together in something resembling a twist ending. Spoiler alert! Oh-m'-gosh, Cassie's amnesia turns out to be important.In sum, I'd say that ""The Gathering"" is equal parts ""The Omen,"" ""The DaVinci Code,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" and pretty much every amnesia-themed movie ever made. And not the good parts, either. No, I'm talking about the hot-dog-makin' parts. The hooves and whatchamacallit-holes.""The Gathering"" isn't scary. It isn't sexy. It isn't provacative. I get the feeling that it could have been. Maybe. If the the filmmakers had tried harder. Or at all. But I suppose it wouldn't be very ""British"" then. Thrillers from Across the Pond seem to focus more on being eerie - fog and squeaking floors and duplicitous nannies - than on being bollocks-to-the wall scary. Sometimes that works for me (e.g. ""The Others"") and sometimes it doesn't.

1012043,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B000HC2M0C,Chip Kaufmann,"[0, 0]","I didn't quite know what to expect when I watched THE GATHERING. I wouldn't have known of the movie's existence had it not been for Jonathan Rigby's book ENGLISH GOTHIC which focuses on British horror films. I like Christina Ricci but she certainly has had a checkered career with a number of her films, like this one, coming and going without much fanfare. In the case of THE GATHERING that's a shame because it's an interesting little movie built around a fascinating premise but after watching it I can see how its commercial potential could be limited. In fact it sat on the shelf for 4 years before the Weinsteins bought it and decided to release it. Even then it went to DVD very quickly.The discovery of an underground church built in England shortly after the crucifiction of Christ creates a number of scenarios for the townspeople of nearby Ashby Wake. One of them, Marion Kirkman (Kerry Fox) accidentally hits a drifter named Cassie Grant (Ricci) with her car. After taking her to the hospital, it's discovered that she has only minor injuries but has suffered a memory loss. Marion's husband Simon (Stephen Dillane) is working on uncovering the church. They take the young woman to live with them in a renovated house that used to be an orphanage run by local church officials. Cassie begins seeing terrible visions concerning certain townspeople and the couple's young son. One of the churchman (Simon Russell Beale) discovers that a bas relief inside the church holds a terrible secret. He dies before he can reveal it. Meanwhile Cassie begins to see more and more visions including a singular group of people who watch what's going on but do nothing. What does it all mean?Think of THE GATHERING as an OMEN like movie but shot on a Hammer budget. There are certain discoveries related to Christianity and bad things happen to certain people but the tie-ins are much more complex and disturbing (much like THE DA VINCI CODE) and they deal with issues confronting the church today. In addition to a Hammer budget, it has the look and feel of a Hammer film especially one of the later ones like DEMONS OF THE MIND or one of the newer ones like WAKE WOOD. Like most thoughtful horror films, THE GATHERING takes time to build to its major revelation but it delivers once it gets there although not in the way you expect. Apparently this version is cut down from the original European release but it seems fine just the way it is.

1012044,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000HC2M0C,Cubist,"[15, 16]","Originally made in 2002 and mysteriously released on DVD in North America in 2007, The Gathering is a British horror film in the tradition of The Wicker Man and The Omen. The police uncover the remnants of a church built in the first century after a young couple discovered it and were killed for their troubles in a freak accident. During a rainy day, a mother (Fox) accidentally runs into Cassie Grant (Ricci), an American backpacker, with her car. Surprisingly, the young woman has only minor injuries and the guilt-ridden mother takes her in to her home in the small village of Ashby Wake.Christina Ricci does a fine job as an inquisitive woman plagued by nightmarish visions and she certainly fares better here than in the flawed Hollywood horror film, Cursed, playing a strong, proactive character who we join in piecing together the mystery of this long-buried church.Screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, a veteran of British television (including several episodes of Poirot and Murder in Mind), takes an old chestnut of people refusing to leave unpleasant things well alone (especially when it pertains to ancient evil) and conceptualizes it in a fresh, new way. There are lots of spooky premonitions, creepy townsfolk, atmospheric English countryside and a dark, secretive history that are staples of the British horror genre but they are presented by director Brian Gilbert (responsible for such fine fare as Tom & Viv and Wilde) in a straightforward way reminiscent of the classic Hammer horror films directed by Terence Fisher. At times, The Gathering does seem to be channeling The Omen, complete with a demonic looking dog and carefully orchestrated gruesome deaths brought on by the supernatural but where it deviates is in its intriguing concept. What happened to the people who witnessed Christ being crucified? Not the ones who looked in horror or sadness but with morbid curiousity? What if these people were condemned to spend eternity being present at other horrific moments in history? The Gathering takes this notion and runs with it in an entertaining and engaging way that sets it apart from most of the other horror films that have come out in the last year.",4,In the tradition of classic Hammer horror films...,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2178,"['Originally', 'made', '2002', 'mysteriously', 'released', 'DVD', 'North', 'America', '2007', 'Gathering', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'tradition', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'Omen', 'police', 'remnants', 'church', 'built', 'first', 'century', 'young', 'couple', 'discovered', 'were', 'killed', 'troubles', 'freak', 'accident', 'rainy', 'day', 'mother', 'Fox', 'accidentally', 'Cassie', 'Grant', 'Ricci', 'American', 'backpacker', 'car', 'Surprisingly', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'minor', 'injuries', 'guilt-ridden', 'mother', 'home', 'small', 'village', 'Ashby', 'Wake.Christina', 'Ricci', 'fine', 'job', 'inquisitive', 'woman', 'plagued', 'nightmarish', 'visions', 'certainly', 'better', 'here', 'flawed', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'film', 'Cursed', 'playing', 'strong', 'proactive', 'character', 'who', 'join', 'piecing', 'together', 'mystery', 'long-buried', 'church.Screenwriter', 'Anthony', 'Horowitz', 'veteran', 'British', 'television', 'including', 'several', 'episodes', 'Poirot', 'Murder', 'Mind', 'old', 'chestnut', 'people', 'refusing', 'leave', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'well', 'alone', 'especially', 'when', 'ancient', 'evil', 'fresh', 'new', 'way', 'are', 'lots', 'spooky', 'premonitions', 'creepy', 'townsfolk', 'atmospheric', 'English', 'countryside', 'dark', 'secretive', 'history', 'are', 'staples', 'British', 'horror', 'genre', 'are', 'presented', 'director', 'Brian', 'Gilbert', 'responsible', 'such', 'fine', 'fare', 'Tom', 'Viv', 'Wilde', 'straightforward', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'classic', 'Hammer', 'horror', 'films', 'directed', 'Terence', 'Fisher', 'times', 'Gathering', 'seem', 'be', 'channeling', 'Omen', 'complete', 'demonic', 'looking', 'dog', 'carefully', 'orchestrated', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'brought', 'supernatural', 'where', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'What', 'happened', 'people', 'who', 'witnessed', 'Christ', 'being', 'crucified', 'Not', 'ones', 'who', 'looked', 'horror', 'sadness', 'morbid', 'curiousity', 'What', 'people', 'were', 'condemned', 'spend', 'eternity', 'being', 'present', 'other', 'horrific', 'moments', 'history', 'Gathering', 'notion', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'way', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'year']",N/A

Boy was I wrong on that one!""The Gathering"" is not a fright-a-minute flick. It's not packed with tons of cheap scares, you aren't jolted out of your chair by something suddenly jumping onscreen as the music blares. ""The Gathering"" is more about eerie tone, setting a creepy mood, and packing an unusual but compelling story into its 90 minute running time. If you like a dark, slowly paced horror film that is more about atmosphere than blood, then you will enjoy ""The Gathering"".Cristina Ricci plays a young girl named Cassie. Cassie has an accident, and can't seem to remember why she is in the small town of Ashby Wake, she is taken in by the Kirkman family while she recovers. Simon Kirkman is an art historian who was called to the area to investigate a 1st century chuch that has recently been discovered, which features an unusual relief on its walls. Cassie befriends the Kirkman's two children and feels drawn to almost autistic young Michael. Cassie begins to have strange visions, visions of violence and bloodshed, and just why is she being followed by a strange group of men and women where ever she goes?As I stated earlier, the film is about tone and mood. Don't go into ""The Gathering"" looking for a thrills a minutes horror tale, this one is all about the build and anticipation.

It opens with the discovery of a buried church and a bas-relief of the crucifixion. There are several inconsistencies in this find and there starts the fun in this film. Adding to the mix is Cassie Grant (Christina Ricci), a girl who has been taken in by a family after being hit by a car and losing her memory. She has no idea why she was coming to this little village, but soon begins to have horrible visions that something bad is about to happen to the good folk in this town. She also shares a kinship with the small boy, Michael, in the family that she is staying with, and she is fiercely protectively of him against the horrible future that she sees for him.THE GATHERING doesn't have a lot of gore. It relies more on atmosphere, and (GASP) an intelligent plotline for the viewer involvement and I think the film was successful in this. THE GATHERING was another one of those movies that I'd never heard of, one that Hollywood sank straight to DVD with little or no fanfare. I think it's so sad that they don't ever try anymore to market these films to any audience anymore. After all, we desperately needed DUKES OF HAZZARD.

1012061,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000HC2M0C,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[10, 12]","While there have been a few other films in the past with some connections to this film's premise, I still found this to be a rather original film.  It focuses on the morbid quality many of us possess and that is our facination with death and tragedy.  Consider how much news we digest, the countless hours of reality TV we watch, and the number of times we slow down to view an accident.  What drives us to observe these tragic events?  Most of us don't stop to help or get very emotional about what we see.  So what is the attraction?  Morbid curiosity is the answer and this film offers up a Dante's Inferno-like punishment for those that engage in this cruel facination.Cruel?  Yes, it is.  While it may seem generally harmless behavior to witness a tragedy, consider our disconnection to the pain of others or our lack of genuine concern.  In addition, consider how some of us go out of our way to view tragedy in its many shapes and forms.  We are merely curious.  Notice how we rush to the TV when we hear something like ""a stuntman was killed on the set of a film today.  Be advised that the following pictures are graphic.""  Wow, we don't miss that do we?  Talk show tears notwithstanding, we have been disensitized to human suffering and this film explores that issue.  In fact, this film not only explores our morbid curiosity with tragedy, but also our often disconnections to those around us that if we connected with them, we could avoid a tragedy.  We will often witness the unpleasant, but do little stop or prevent it.The film starts out slow, but at a brief 80 minutes, it gets going quickly.  If you haven't read one of the spoiling reviews below, this film also has a nice mystery in it as well as Ricci's character can't recall who she is or why she is in this town.  She's had a bad accident on a back road and suffered severe memory loss.  Ironically, the person that hits her while driving on a rainy afternoon shows the most emotion in this film filled with emotionless rubberneckers and I don't think that was any accident by the writers.  Ricci's character is then cared for by the family that actually hit her on the road as they don't want her released from the hospital in no one's care as she can't recall who she is to see in this small town.  What a wonderful message about both the benefits and costs of altuism in this rather bleak film.The acting is generally okay, but lackluster in a number of places.  I think Christina Ricci is an odd person to cast in this role and one I would like to have seen played by someone a little more wholesome looking.  Ricci just comes across as strange here at times and out of place, but she does give an honest effort.  Ioan Gruffudd (Fantastic Four) is perfectly eerie as her aloof friend, but not quite boyfriend.The film is beautifully photographed and the climax is violent and very disturbing, but the score and direction is rather bland and unremarkable.  In spite of some obvious flaws this film is definitely worth a viewing, but it is one of those film that you aren't likely to revisit once you understand the whole story.  Once the mystery of who Ricci is is solved and we absorb the uncomfortable aspects of our own morbid curiosity, there isn't much left to keep our interest.",3,3 1/2 Stars for this moralistic little thriller,1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,3261,"['have', 'been', 'few', 'other', 'films', 'past', 'connections', 'film', 'premise', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'original', 'film', 'morbid', 'quality', 'many', 'possess', 'facination', 'death', 'tragedy', 'Consider', 'how', 'much', 'news', 'digest', 'countless', 'hours', 'reality', 'TV', 'watch', 'number', 'times', 'slow', 'down', 'view', 'accident', 'What', 'observe', 'tragic', 'events', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'help', 'get', 'very', 'emotional', 'what', 'see', 'So', 'what', 'attraction', 'Morbid', 'curiosity', 'answer', 'film', 'up', 'Dante', 'Inferno-like', 'punishment', 'engage', 'cruel', 'facination.Cruel', 'Yes', 'may', 'seem', 'generally', 'harmless', 'behavior', 'witness', 'tragedy', 'consider', 'disconnection', 'pain', 'others', 'lack', 'genuine', 'concern', 'addition', 'consider', 'how', 'go', 'way', 'view', 'tragedy', 'many', 'shapes', 'forms', 'are', 'merely', 'curious', 'Notice', 'how', 'rush', 'TV', 'when', 'hear', 'something', 'stuntman', 'was', 'killed', 'set', 'film', 'today', 'Be', 'advised', 'following', 'pictures', 'are', 'graphic', 'Wow', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'do', 'Talk', 'show', 'tears', 'notwithstanding', 'have', 'been', 'disensitized', 'human', 'suffering', 'film', 'issue', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'tragedy', 'also', 'often', 'disconnections', 'connected', 'could', 'avoid', 'tragedy', 'will', 'often', 'witness', 'unpleasant', 'do', 'little', 'stop', 'prevent', 'it.The', 'film', 'out', 'slow', 'brief', '80', 'minutes', 'going', 'quickly', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'one', 'spoiling', 'reviews', 'below', 'film', 'also', 'nice', 'mystery', 'as', 'well', 'Ricci', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'who', 'why', 'town', 'had', 'bad', 'accident', 'back', 'road', 'suffered', 'severe', 'memory', 'loss', 'Ironically', 'person', 'driving', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'most', 'emotion', 'film', 'filled', 'emotionless', 'rubberneckers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'accident', 'writers', 'Ricci', 'character', 'then', 'cared', 'family', 'actually', 'hit', 'road', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'released', 'hospital', 'one', 'care', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'who', 'see', 'small', 'town', 'What', 'wonderful', 'message', 'benefits', 'costs', 'altuism', 'rather', 'bleak', 'film.The', 'acting', 'generally', 'okay', 'lackluster', 'number', 'places', 'think', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'odd', 'person', 'cast', 'role', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'played', 'someone', 'little', 'more', 'wholesome', 'looking', 'Ricci', 'just', 'across', 'strange', 'here', 'times', 'place', 'give', 'honest', 'effort', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'perfectly', 'eerie', 'aloof', 'friend', 'not', 'quite', 'boyfriend.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'climax', 'violent', 'very', 'disturbing', 'score', 'direction', 'rather', 'bland', 'unremarkable', 'spite', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'one', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'likely', 'revisit', 'once', 'understand', 'whole', 'story', 'mystery', 'who', 'Ricci', 'solved', 'absorb', 'uncomfortable', 'aspects', 'own', 'morbid', 'curiosity', ""n't"", 'much', 'left', 'keep', 'interest']",N/A

While recuperating, she notices that some people stare at her in the streets.  Why?Meanwhile, the father of the family she's staying with is studying an early Christian church, recently unearthed. But why was it buried in the first place? To hide some evil?THE GATHERING is about the lookiloos who witnessed Christ's crucifixion -- now they are condemned to walk the Earth forever, lookiloos to every human tragedy. They must show up, and watch and stare.It's a creepy premise, unoriginal in its broad strokes, but original in its details. THE GATHERING evokes THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, a fine horror film about the mysterious ""mothman"" who appears in locales that are soon to experience tragedy. THE GATHERING also has shades of Ray Bradbury's ""The Crowd.""But the specifics of THE GATHERING -- tying its creepy crowd to Christ's crucifixion -- are original.  The photography is beautiful. And there are some good shocks.I've seen lots of jarring car accidents in horror films (e.g., THE DESCENT, DEVIL, some of the FINAL DESTINATION films, and 1983's Australian NIGHTMARES), and THE GATHERING delivers on that score.  Actually, it has two car accident scenes.  Car accidents have become a horror film clich&eacute;, but they're well done here, so no complaints.The ending is surprising, though hardcore horror fans may see it coming. I had guessed that it was one of several possible outcomes. But again, the ending's final revelation is well staged, so even if you saw it coming, it's still jarring to witness.Altogether, THE GATHERING is a creepy film, with some nice shocks and unexpected twists.

Considering the name of Christina Ricci who is obviously cast here for her marquee value, the film should have been released much earlier, but somehow they didn't, just as her ""Prozac Nation"" of which release was also delayed by four years in America. I don't know the real reasons for the delayed release of these films, but I can say that though Christina Ricci's fans would be pleased with ""The Gathering,"" others would find this occult thriller half-baked and disappointing.""The Gathering"" stars Christina Ricci as American backpacker Cassie, who is hit by a car driven by Marion (Kerry Fox) while walking near a small fictional village of Ashby Wake, England. Cassie suffers from short-term memory loss and starts to live with Marion's family.Cassie befriends a little boy named Michael while staying with the family, but begins to see ""horrible things"" (in her words) that keep annoying her. Not only that; Cassie also becomes closer to handsome Dan (Ioan Gruffudd) who seems to know something about her. In the meantime, Marion's husband Simon is asked to research an old church that was recently discovered, which was built in the first century.Well, for all one good idea in Anthony Horowitz's script, promising opening chapters and some good stylish camera from director Brian Gilbert (""Wilde"" and ""Tom and Viv""), `The Gathering' falls apart with sluggish pace and several gaping plot holes. The film tries to do too many things, but few of them are really original or interesting and many actually contradict each other. For example, Cassie loses her memory, but she does not look traumatized and is more concerned about Michael than herself. These strange points will be explained away in the final chapters, but before reaching them you will lose interest in the dull story that keeps introducing clues without making them intriguing.Christina Ricci does her best (she always does) trying to give Cassie credible personality, but even Ricci seems at a loss what to do with the underwritten character. The film itself has little surprise with the by-the-numbers execution in the second half, and though its American DVD jacket looks like that of `Omen,' there are few moments that are truly as spooky or shocking as the Richard Donner film.Note: My review is about the longer version of the film released in Japan that runs about 100 minutes. I could have given two stars to the film, but I didn't for the shorter version might be improved, and I gave it three.
