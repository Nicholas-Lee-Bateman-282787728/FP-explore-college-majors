1660356,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B00DPH7QCA,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[35, 36]","Having grown up with this album and being especially influenced by these artists as a young musician, I was both eager and skeptical of this release, but decided to pull the trigger and hope that ammo wasn't wasted. It far exceeded my expectations by a longshot, and all true aficionados of music should be required to own this DVD. Not just watch it, but give it repeated listenings - it's the best music DVD I've seen since 'Jeff Beck - Live at Ronnie Scotts' from a few years ago. Yup, it's that good.Both McLaughlin and Carlos are in top form, and instead of each playing a set with their own bands and unifying for an overbloated finale (like a lot of these concert pairings), both bands are blended (I'll refrain from using the word 'Fused') throughout the concert without the potentially disasterous clashing of musical egos and artistic overarching from guys of this caliber. Roles are established and egos kept checked until your space was allotted, at which point you could break loose and raise hell, which happened frequently.What also thrilled me was the selection of tracks - in addition to the classic 'Love, Devotion, Surrender' tracks and reprise, we're treated to compositions by John Coltrane, Bob Dylan, Miles, Led Zep, Pharoah Sanders, Wayne Shorter, Sonny Sharrock and Tony Williams Lifetime, which was the highpoint for me. Here, Cindy Blackman channeled Tony like no one else could (she was his student) and gave McLaughlin the kick in the ass he needed to resurrect some of the blistering, visceral psych-acid-jazzrock fretwork we don't always hear from him anymore. Two astonishing tracks worth the price alone. And don't get me started on Cindy's drum solo, another tribute to her mentor Tony Williams, who Santana calls ""probably the greatest drummer who ever lived"" - this said in front of his newlywed wife, the best female drummer on the planet (at least the one I live on)! I felt sorry for Dennis Chambers, another monsterous skinbasher, who was relegated to Cindy's shadow most of the night.I could go on, but 'There Comes A Time' when you no longer need to convert the musical mind - if you love great guitarists, virtuoso musicians, near-flawless vocabulary and execution, perfect pacing and performances by egoless giants, and just want to sit mesmerized with the cat-who-just-ate-the-canary look on your face, you need this, as in yesterday.

Whenever these two guitar maestros and searching souls meet a special kind of magic ensures.And here they are supported by a stellar cast mainly from Santana's regular band although McLaughlin bassist Etienne M'Bappe definitely plays a prominent role. On drums Cindy Blackman Santana and Dennis Chambers drives things forward with power and finesse together with conga legend Raul Rekow. And 'new' Santana keyboard player David Matthews really impresses with both versality and inventiveness.Even though the repertoire comprises 4 tracks from the classic ""Love, Devotion, Surrender"" album the atmosphere is far from their short legendary tour of 1973. Less fiery guitar-battles and more subdued, but sublime interplay. Among the highlights in this very diverse set is 2 tracks from Lifetime propelled by Cindy (as in her excelent 'tribute' bandSpectrum Road) and a rare chance to hear McLaughlin visiting his avantgardish (acidy) past. And some sublime acoustic guitar duets.As must be the case with a 'rehearsed jamsession' like this there are some miscues and warts but that only add to the charm of this highly recommendable concert that really lives up to it's name, inviting us to spiritual and musical illumination.",5,guitar blessings,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,1307,"['Finally', 'historic', 'performance', 'available', 'great', 'Live', 'Montreux', 'series', 'two', 'guitar', 'maestros', 'searching', 'souls', 'meet', 'special', 'kind', 'magic', 'ensures.And', 'here', 'are', 'supported', 'stellar', 'cast', 'mainly', 'Santana', 'regular', 'band', 'McLaughlin', 'bassist', 'Etienne', ""M'Bappe"", 'definitely', 'prominent', 'role', 'drums', 'Cindy', 'Blackman', 'Santana', 'Dennis', 'Chambers', 'things', 'forward', 'power', 'finesse', 'together', 'conga', 'legend', 'Raul', 'Rekow', 'Santana', 'keyboard', 'player', 'David', 'Matthews', 'really', 'versality', 'inventiveness.Even', 'repertoire', '4', 'tracks', 'classic', 'Love', 'Devotion', 'Surrender', 'atmosphere', 'far', 'short', 'legendary', 'tour', '1973', 'fiery', 'guitar-battles', 'more', 'subdued', 'sublime', 'interplay', 'highlights', 'very', 'diverse', 'set', '2', 'tracks', 'Lifetime', 'propelled', 'Cindy', 'excelent', ""'tribute"", 'bandSpectrum', 'Road', 'rare', 'chance', 'hear', 'McLaughlin', 'visiting', 'avantgardish', 'acidy', 'past', 'sublime', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'duets.As', 'must', 'be', 'case', ""'rehearsed"", 'jamsession', 'are', 'miscues', 'warts', 'only', 'add', 'charm', 'highly', 'recommendable', 'concert', 'really', 'up', 'name', 'inviting', 'spiritual', 'musical', 'illumination']",Invitation to Illumination: Live at Montreux 2011

Think about how complex some of the rhythms and textures are here, and you'll get what I'm saying. After all, most of it is John Coltrane's works, (you know &#34;Love, Devotion and Surrender&#34; was a historic album, don't you, when it came out! Well, this is the &#34;Live&#34; version! ) but other artists' compositions are treated well here, also.( Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, Pharaoh Sanders, Sonny Sharrock)  The songs are glorious. The rapport is genuine and healthy and everyone has a great time. Lots of smiling, laughter, even. Joy! Don't let off-putting 3 and 4-star folks try to sway you, although they are entitled to their say. For me, as a guitarist, seeing these two giants play together is astonishing. Having Etienne M'Bapp playing bass is a wonderment of grand imagination, as he is a star in his own right. Especially watch his solo near the end of this set. Take a look at the playing by Dennis Chambers and the young Cindy Santana on drums, the wonderful conga percussion by Paul Rekow, and superb keyboard playing by David K. Matthews. Vocalists Tony Lindsay and Andy Vargas are also there with Tommy Anthony on guitar and Benny Rietveld on bass to complete the band. The acoustic version of &#34;Naima&#34; is one of the prettiest tunes in all of jazz. Try to play it, if you can, like they do. Challenging, but so very nice. They offer a tribute to drummer Tony Williams that John played with and who died shortly before this set was filmed. Finally, they salute Claude Nobs, the founder of Montreux Jazz Festival, who has since passed away as well. They even let him jam on blues harp toward the end. I would have liked to have been there. I am so very glad I own this, and to see this is a real treat. Not to be missed and highly recommended.

1660362,A3H5L5RO8YMM07,B00DPH7QCA,Loren West,"[1, 3]","Sorry but I was very disappointed with this Blu-Ray. Perhaps my expectations were too high? Carlos and John are  two of the greatest guitarists of all time. I therefore expected to be blown out of my chair by this concert. Instead I watched them go through the motions and wondered what happened. It sounded as if they had met for the first time and decided to have a loosely structured jam session with no previous rehearsal. The performance is loose which in it itself is not a bad thing but it just sounds very uninspired and thrown together to me. I have seen both of these men in concert fairly recently and they both play as well as they ever did so why this DVD is so disappointing is a mystery to me.  Perhaps the material was part of the problem? Remember that scene in ""Wayne's World?""  No Stairway fellas! No Stairway!Anyway no harm no foul. I still love both of these master musicians and if I had a chance to see them play live together I would jump at the chance.  But my feeling about this particular performance was just kind of ""meh"".If I might make a suggestion to fans of jazz rock fusion there is a new band out there called ""The Aristocrats"".

This DVD concert recorded in 2011 is in most ways the equal of that first show, and in some ways better. I was a big fan of Mclaughlin and the Mahavishnu orchestra in the early 70s, he was in my opinion the finest guitarist on the planet, but I haven't been able to connect with anything he's done since. Here, in Montreux it's as if the spark has been relit and he plays with fire. From the first moments of The Life Divine you know that these two players haven't lost any of their talent; No one plays guitar like this any more. The interplay between the two virtuosos seems telepathic, supposed modern masters like Vai and Satriani couldn't begin to play at this level of power, emotion and fluidity. The Sonny Sharrock piece, Venus/Upper Egypt just soars and to me is the highlight of the performance.This band doesn't have Billy Cobham on drums like the 1973 touring band, Cobham really powered the band on; but Carlos's wife, Cindy Blackman Santana, is amazingly versatile and all over those drums. The rest of the band are all fine musicians and provide a solid backdrop for the fiery guitar leads. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show and anyone who enjoys jazz-rock fusion will love it.
