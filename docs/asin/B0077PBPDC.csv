1527616,A11D5TH3NT4CWG,B0077PBPDC,"H. Sansom ""huw_the_book""","[2, 10]","This was broadcast on PBS in April, 2012. The two narrators (husband and wife, the husband a long-time observer of wolf populations in Idaho) spent a year in the Frank Church-River of No Return wilderness in Idaho. They were outfitted with a Red One camera; the footage is at times absolutely phenomenal. It helps that the region they're in is not one overrun by tourists like Yellowstone or many others in the US.The sad drawback is that the two filmmakers' voiceover is atrocious. They have none of the ease of narration of David Attenborough (on the more formal, styled British side of nature narration) or Marty Stouffer (in a very easy-going, but still exceptionally well-informed American style). It's clear that the lead narrator is deeply interested in his subject, but little if any of that comes across in the voiceover. More often, he and his partner seem to striving for depth while coming across as trite or self-conscious.That said, some will find the personal quality and honesty engaging. I found the stiffness (or forced 'easy-going-ness') annoying after about 20 minutes.",2,"Beautiful visually, abysmal narration",1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,1089,"['was', 'broadcast', 'PBS', 'April', '2012', 'two', 'narrators', 'husband', 'wife', 'husband', 'long-time', 'observer', 'wolf', 'populations', 'Idaho', 'spent', 'year', 'Frank', 'Church-River', 'No', 'Return', 'wilderness', 'Idaho', 'were', 'outfitted', 'Red', 'One', 'camera', 'footage', 'times', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'region', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'overrun', 'tourists', 'Yellowstone', 'many', 'others', 'US.The', 'sad', 'drawback', 'two', 'filmmakers', 'voiceover', 'atrocious', 'have', 'none', 'ease', 'narration', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'more', 'formal', 'styled', 'British', 'side', 'nature', 'narration', 'Marty', 'Stouffer', 'very', 'easy-going', 'still', 'exceptionally', 'well-informed', 'American', 'style', 'clear', 'lead', 'narrator', 'deeply', 'interested', 'subject', 'little', 'voiceover', 'More', 'often', 'partner', 'seem', 'striving', 'depth', 'coming', 'trite', 'self-conscious.That', 'said', 'will', 'find', 'personal', 'quality', 'honesty', 'engaging', 'found', 'stiffness', 'forced', ""'easy-going-ness"", 'annoying', '20', 'minutes']",Nature: The River of No Return

The fact is that most of US watch great outdoors documentaries, at least I do, to calm down, relax and be in armchair ""contact with Mother Earth""Yet in my case as a barefooted hiker, runner, sun lover, sun gazer and vegetarian I enjoy, besides watching about it, almost daily practical contact with the outdoors.Yet I applaud the fact that by filming the majesty of one of roads, mining and civilization free largest wilderness areas they were sharing with us the grandeur of Church River of no Return and since Isaac and Bjornen spent a year with only a tent for mosquito, bears, and wintertime protection I have felt four stars for this documentary were deserved.",4,A Worthy Attempt At Wilderness Filming,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,1128,"['nature', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'too', 'short', 'second', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'great', 'narration', 'wanting', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'hired', 'professional', 'narrator', 'certainly', 'would', 'improve', 'quality', 'film.On', 'other', 'hand', 'pessimistic', 'remark', 'regarding', 'diagnosed', 'illness', 'hers', 'place', 'soothing', 'nature', 'documentary', 'may', 'also', 'trigger', 'fear', 'naive', 'viewers', 'fact', 'most', 'US', 'watch', 'great', 'outdoors', 'documentaries', 'least', 'do', 'calm', 'down', 'relax', 'be', 'armchair', 'contact', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'Yet', 'case', 'barefooted', 'hiker', 'runner', 'sun', 'lover', 'sun', 'gazer', 'vegetarian', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'almost', 'daily', 'practical', 'contact', 'outdoors.Yet', 'applaud', 'fact', 'filming', 'majesty', 'one', 'roads', 'mining', 'civilization', 'free', 'largest', 'wilderness', 'areas', 'were', 'sharing', 'grandeur', 'Church', 'River', 'Return', 'Isaac', 'Bjornen', 'spent', 'year', 'only', 'tent', 'mosquito', 'bears', 'wintertime', 'protection', 'have', 'felt', 'four', 'stars', 'documentary', 'were', 'deserved']",Nature: The River of No Return
1527619,A16GJQ27XTZLLE,B0077PBPDC,"Rick Seals ""Transplanted OKie""","[4, 4]","Nature: River Of No Return is one of the best documentaries the series has had in a long time that did not focus on a particular species or a particular type of animal. I loved it on PBS and bought it as fast as I could when it came out in HD.At a glance, the film is about Isaac Babcock, a biologist, and his wife Bjornen, with whom he travels into one of the few remaining pristine wilderness areas remaining in the United States - the Frank Church River Of No Return Wilderness Area. It contains just under 2.4 million acres of nearly untouched mountain wilderness. The Babcocks document their attempt to live in this wild area for a year with very little contact or assistance from the outside world. While doing so, they explore this amazing place and study the animals that dwell there while doing their best to leave the area as God intended it.The video quality is absolutely stunning, not only because of being HD but because the content is that eye-opening. The shots of wolves in their natural environment doing what they do best while barely even registering that humans are around by itself makes this documentary worth a look. The birds, coyotes, and other animals that are also caught in action make this a true journey into another time and place. And all the while you get a glimpse of what life is like without all the modern things that we have so thoroughly convinced ourselves are absolutely necessary in a given day.Anyone who even remotely values the wild places of the world will fall in love with this program. If you are someone who dreams of perhaps one day hiking to some of the places God created that we, the human race, have thankfully not destroyed yet, you too will love this documentary. If you are looking for a movie with which you can teach others about why the wild places in this world need protecting, than this is your movie. I recommend this documentary with the highest regards. I give it five stars and would give it more if I could.",5,"""Going To The Mountains Is Going Home"" - John Muir",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,1977,"['Nature', 'River', 'Return', 'one', 'best', 'documentaries', 'series', 'had', 'long', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'particular', 'species', 'particular', 'type', 'animal', 'loved', 'PBS', 'bought', 'as', 'fast', 'could', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'HD.At', 'glance', 'film', 'Isaac', 'Babcock', 'biologist', 'wife', 'Bjornen', 'whom', 'one', 'few', 'remaining', 'pristine', 'wilderness', 'areas', 'remaining', 'United', 'States', 'Frank', 'Church', 'River', 'No', 'Return', 'Wilderness', 'Area', 'just', '2.4', 'million', 'acres', 'nearly', 'untouched', 'mountain', 'wilderness', 'Babcocks', 'document', 'attempt', 'live', 'wild', 'area', 'year', 'very', 'little', 'contact', 'assistance', 'outside', 'world', 'doing', 'so', 'explore', 'amazing', 'place', 'study', 'animals', 'dwell', 'there', 'doing', 'best', 'leave', 'area', 'God', 'intended', 'it.The', 'video', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'HD', 'content', 'eye-opening', 'shots', 'wolves', 'natural', 'environment', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'barely', 'even', 'registering', 'humans', 'are', 'around', 'documentary', 'worth', 'look', 'birds', 'coyotes', 'other', 'animals', 'are', 'also', 'caught', 'action', 'make', 'true', 'journey', 'time', 'place', 'while', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'modern', 'things', 'have', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'convinced', 'ourselves', 'are', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'given', 'day.Anyone', 'who', 'even', 'remotely', 'wild', 'places', 'world', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'program', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'perhaps', 'one', 'day', 'hiking', 'places', 'God', 'created', 'human', 'race', 'have', 'thankfully', 'not', 'destroyed', 'yet', 'too', 'will', 'love', 'documentary', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'can', 'teach', 'others', 'why', 'wild', 'places', 'world', 'need', 'protecting', 'movie', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'highest', 'regards', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'could']",Nature: The River of No Return

On-screen promos, websites and station ID's customarily shown during broadcast were thoughtfully excised for the video release. This, coupled with our newlywed hosts' sometimes humorous candidness (particularly their rendition of ""This Land is Your Land"" on harmonica) makes their journey seem as though it is ours as well. So if you're looking for extreme nature (eg. the highest mountains or tallest waterfalls) you won't find it here, but you will get a true sense of the wilderness through some dazzling photography and the occasional mild touch of ethereal scoring, and a surround sound mix that is just enough to evoke a sense of fresh air without drawing attention to itself.
