706035,A34WKQ6TNI5PK1,B000068TQ7,A Fan,"[3, 3]","Released in 1961, Wild in the Country would be Elvis' last purely dramatic role for several years.  He gives what may be his finest acting performance as a troubled young man from a dysfunctional family whose passion is really writing.  This film was only moderately successful at the box office.  Elvis' next film, Blue Hawaii, a musical comedy would be a big hit so at the behest of Colonel Tom, his subsequent movies became formula musicals.  Unfortunately the quality of the scripts and soundtracks would decline over the years, leaving many fans to wonder what might have been had Elvis been give more of an opportunity to develop as a serious actor.",4,Possibly Elvis' finest acting performance,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,655,"['Released', '1961', 'Wild', 'Country', 'would', 'be', 'Elvis', 'last', 'purely', 'dramatic', 'role', 'several', 'years', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'acting', 'performance', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'passion', 'really', 'writing', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'moderately', 'successful', 'box', 'office', 'Elvis', 'next', 'film', 'Blue', 'Hawaii', 'musical', 'comedy', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'hit', 'so', 'behest', 'Colonel', 'Tom', 'subsequent', 'movies', 'became', 'formula', 'musicals', 'Unfortunately', 'quality', 'scripts', 'soundtracks', 'would', 'decline', 'years', 'leaving', 'many', 'fans', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Elvis', 'been', 'give', 'more', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'serious', 'actor']",N/A

What made me decide to buy it was the reviews by others who had seen it and their comments about Elvis and the movie. I was not disappointed, I thought it was a very good movie. Elvis played his role as small town, young man, wrongly accused in more than one instance, showing his lack of trust and faith in everyone around him. He had a father & brother who totally disliked him for some reason, other than they were poor folk and played by their own rules, and he was not a welcome member of the family. The movie plays out very well and shows that Love can come to us whether we want it to or not, and sometimes age makes no difference.I recommend if you haven't seen it, it is well worth watching or having. I've always believed if an actor can play his/her part so well that they bring out your feelings of the character they play (good, bad, evil, nieve, etc.)then they are truly very good actors. Then again, remember, you never know how much might have been cut from the original film, that might have made the movie even much better, before it hits the theater's.Wild in the Country",5,Elvis Presley in Wild in the Country,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,1140,"['purchased', 'movie', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'What', 'made', 'decide', 'buy', 'was', 'reviews', 'others', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'comments', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Elvis', 'played', 'role', 'small', 'town', 'young', 'man', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'more', 'one', 'instance', 'showing', 'lack', 'trust', 'faith', 'everyone', 'had', 'father', 'brother', 'who', 'totally', 'disliked', 'reason', 'other', 'were', 'poor', 'folk', 'played', 'own', 'rules', 'was', 'not', 'welcome', 'member', 'family', 'movie', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'Love', 'can', 'come', 'want', 'not', 'sometimes', 'age', 'difference.I', 'recommend', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'having', ""'ve"", 'always', 'believed', 'actor', 'can', 'play', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'bring', 'out', 'feelings', 'character', 'play', 'good', 'bad', 'evil', 'nieve', 'etc', 'then', 'are', 'truly', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Then', 'again', 'remember', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'original', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'much', 'better', ""theater's.Wild"", 'Country']",N/A

Elvis portrays Glenn Tyler, a southern boy from a rural, poverty-stricken background, who has just been released from juvenile hall. Central to the character of Glenn is that the brooding young man is at a crossroads in his life, and he must choose the path most suitable for him. His choices are represented by three women. Noreen (Tuesday Weld) is Glenn's cousin who urges him to stay with his own kind. Noreen offers passion and good times, but such a carefree existence allows little thought for the future. Betty Lee (Millie Perkins), who is Glenn's childhood sweetheart selflessly places Glenn's future above her own needs, urging him to leave town and attend college. She is prepared to lose him that he may have an education and a secure future. Hope Lange costars as Irene Sperry, the court-appointed psychiatrist assigned to Glenn's case, who recognizes in him the raw talent of a budding writer. She also encourages Glenn to attend college but causes scandal when she falls in love with him. Glenn ends up following Betty Lee's advice and asking her to wait for him.With a strong supporting cast including a young Tuesday Weld who was only 17 years old during the film's production. She was one of the hottest and wildest starlets in Hollywood and already had romances with two of of her costars in the film - Elvis and Veteran Actor John Ireland.Produced for Twentieth Century Fox by Jerry Wald.
