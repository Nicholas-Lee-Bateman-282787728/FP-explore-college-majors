482882,A1VKEVP3GO1G9R,6305907153,Aaron Amos,"[4, 8]","This movie is about a old boxer played by Kirk Douglas(Oscar,Greedy), and his son Dan Aykroyd(Blues Brothers 2000,Ghostbusters). The old boxer father  wants to give his sons some diamonds. They end up on a road trip from  Canada to Reno,Nevada. The grandpa takes along Aykroyd's son on the road  trip .Upon arriving they go to a brothel run by Lauren Becall)The Mirror  Has Two Faces). All of the men each have a girlin the brothel For fans of  Dan Aykroyd he is shirtless several time he displaying his hairy chest and  flabby stomach(should'nt he go on  diet? ) Then the party leaves after  Lauren Becall tells Kirk Douglas who and where the diamonds are. They get  the diamonds and go back home.The other brother played by Kurt Fuller is  mad about taking the dad on unauthorized trip! it has a happy ending and it  was a touching drama about family relationships and togetherness.  This  movie is rated PG-13 for nudity, swearing and sexual jokes.I do not why  this movie did make it to the mainstream theaers.It's was made by Miramax(a  divison of the Walt Disney Studios and owned by them!) . I know many people  will overlook this movie but at least we can see Kirk Douglas act after his  stroke!Jenny McCarthy(Scream3) also co-stars in this movie too!On the  plus side, the DVD is closed captioned,has bios about the star etc,scene  choices and docementary about Kirk Douglas!On the bad side to the DVD there  is now two or pan/scan or widescreen option like &quot;Reindeer  Games&quot;(another Disney movie) and no trailers for the movie or about  the movie!I liked it and I did not even see it on the big screen! Fans of  Kirk Douglas,Lauren Becall and Dan Aykroyd will be happy with this movie!",5,"Touching story about a father ,his son, &amp; his son's son",966816000,"08 21, 2000",2000,1705,"['movie', 'old', 'boxer', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Oscar', 'Greedy', 'son', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Blues', 'Brothers', '2000', 'Ghostbusters', 'old', 'boxer', 'father', 'give', 'sons', 'diamonds', 'end', 'up', 'road', 'trip', 'Canada', 'Reno', 'Nevada', 'grandpa', 'Aykroyd', 'son', 'road', 'trip', '.Upon', 'arriving', 'go', 'brothel', 'run', 'Lauren', 'Becall', 'Mirror', 'Has', 'Two', 'Faces', 'men', 'have', 'girlin', 'brothel', 'fans', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'shirtless', 'several', 'time', 'displaying', 'hairy', 'chest', 'flabby', 'stomach', ""should'nt"", 'go', 'diet', 'Then', 'party', 'Lauren', 'Becall', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'who', 'where', 'diamonds', 'are', 'get', 'diamonds', 'go', 'back', 'home.The', 'other', 'brother', 'played', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'mad', 'taking', 'dad', 'unauthorized', 'trip', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'touching', 'drama', 'family', 'relationships', 'togetherness', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'sexual', 'jokes.I', 'do', 'not', 'why', 'movie', 'did', 'make', 'mainstream', 'theaers.It', 'was', 'made', 'Miramax', 'divison', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'owned', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'overlook', 'movie', 'least', 'can', 'see', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'act', 'stroke', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'Scream3', 'also', 'co-stars', 'movie', 'too', 'plus', 'side', 'DVD', 'closed', 'captioned', 'bios', 'star', 'etc', 'scene', 'choices', 'docementary', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'bad', 'side', 'DVD', 'now', 'two', 'pan/scan', 'widescreen', 'option', 'quot', 'Reindeer', 'Games', 'quot', 'Disney', 'movie', 'trailers', 'movie', 'movie', 'liked', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'Fans', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Lauren', 'Becall', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'movie']",Diamonds

Even after his stroke, Kirk Douglas ""still has it!"" The role of his son in the movie was originally to have been his ""real son,"" Michael; however he turned down the role. Dan Akroyd is great in the role of Kirk's son.Diamonds is one of what I call ""feel good"" movies, which makes you want to watch it over & over again!This was a very hard movie to find, but as usual, Amazon ""came through!""

482885,A92XVSV8LADWZ,6305907153,Otto Yuen,"[3, 3]","This is not a story about diamonds but a beautiful story about the father and son's bonding. It begins with the old dad played by Kirk Douglas, who always brags about having a dozen of magic diamonds hidding somewhere, worth millions of dollars. None of his children believes him. Until someday, his grandson listens and excites about it. He drags his dad (played by Dan Aykroyd) to help his grandfather to find those diamonds. Adventure begins. Throughout the journey, they not only fix up but also strengthen their father-and-son relationship all together. And eventually, they find the magic diamonds but with a twist --- a $5 cubic zirconia necklace and a deck of card printed with grandma's picture. Yet, at the end of the film, there's another twist.Overall, this is a very good movie. It will make you laugh abit and cry abit. Just the DVD is lacking of some extra features, which only comes with closed captions, bios, and a bonus material ""The Life and Times of Kirk Douglas"".*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Diamonds ***1.
