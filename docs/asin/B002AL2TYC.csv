I was a little uncomfortable with the two unnecessary towel scenes but they were tastefully enough done that I could overlook it. I was thrilled to see it was on dvd and bought a copy immediately. Sometimes it's cool when they add deleted scenes back into the movie. Sometimes not. This DVD release had one of each instance. There's an added car scene with Jen and Morgan after they pick up the bike that was kind of sweet. The other added scene was of a definitely naked Jen getting into the shower. You don't see anything except her bare back (extending very low down her back) but unlike the towel scene where one could assume for filming she was actually wearing a strapless bathing suit, the shower scene is quite a bit more revealing and really completely unnecessary. I know there are many who will think I'm being silly but had I known about the shower scene I would not have purchased this dvd. This review is more to warn people like me.

Henry Winkler is perfect as a relative you'd like to have, The romantic male lead is exactly the guy you'd want as a friend, lover, dad, etc.  The situation, settings and people are all good light holiday fun.  The plot is an appealing tweak on one that's already worked for plenty of other Christmas movies.  Nothing wrong with following a formula if it's well done and the product is satisfying.  This is one I've seen enough times to want to buy it.  Highly recommended.As for previous comments about the two ""towel"" scenes, in which the leads encounter each other before or after a shower, Come, on!  The guy is SO covered with towels that you see no more than you would if he unbuttoned the top 3 buttons of his shirt.  The girl's back is no more than you would see if she wore a strapless dress or bathing suit.  Much ado about nothing.The reason I am returning the disc is: this is a relatively new movie, shot for TV with the new standard of 16x9 or 1.78 aspect ratio of today's flatscreen TVs.  That is the way it is broadcast, so that's what I expect from the DVD.  Two listings for this title, one indicates old square TV at 1.33, the one I ordered said 1.78 in Amazon's product details.  The box it comes in says the movie is 14x9 letterbox.  What it really is is Windowboxed, meaning there is a thick black border on all four sides of the picture, making the picture smaller than it is when broadcast on TV.

He's kind and strong and stable and he's solid!""- Uncle Ralph: ""Wow. He sounds like a bookcase.""Around Christmastime, TCM and Hallmark are the two cable channels I tune in for my fix of holiday flicks. There's always one or three that air that I haven't seen before. Case in point, Hallmark's terrific 2008 offering, THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR. It's so watchable I marvel that it's skipped my radar for the past four years. It'll now be on steady rotation in my household.Lovely Jennifer Cullen (Brooke Burns) has been cautious all her life, and I guess she's done okay with that. Today, she's a successful (if harried) corporate executive in Chicago. She's the single mom of an adorable little boy, and yet she's disenchanted with Christmas. She tends to make lists she never crosses off. This holiday season she's brooding over cooking the perfect Christmas day turkey meal for her boyfriend's parents and also over gratifying her kid's one lone Christmas wish: the very elusive ""Rocket Wheel"" bike. For Jennifer Cullen, it's the most stressful time of the year. And then her retired Brooklyn ex-cop uncle (Henry Winkler) arrives with a surprise guest: some stranger he'd befriended at the airport.Jennifer doesn't know what to make of Morgan Derby (Warren Christie). She can't fathom the way he lives his life. Morgan is a carefree globe trotter, a sort of Renaissance man with all the jobs he'd taken on during his travels (he's a chef, he's worked on a turtle farm, etc.). Except that now Morgan's decided it's time to put down roots. He's thinking of opening a restaurant in Denver with an old flame. Sharing a plane ride from New York to Chicago with Jennifer's uncle, Morgan learns that his continuing flight to Denver is canceled due to heavy Colorado snow. Jennifer's Uncle Ralph, rough-around-the-edges but really a softie, urges her to let him stay for the night. She welcomes Morgan... warily, resentfully. Uncle Ralph merrily cautions Morgan that Jennifer is savvy when it comes to business but ""when it comes to life, she's dumber than a bag of barber hair.""THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR is a clunky title, but don't let that dissuade you. This was a wonderful surprise for me. Yes, it's predictable as are most holiday films. But the execution and the warm performances eclipse that predictability. Burns and Christie are both irresistible and create a marvelous spark in their moments together; you immediately root for them to get together. The film satisfies the unrepentant romantic. Morgan rapidly impacts the Cullen household and right away gets under Jennifer's nerves. I love Morgan's Christmas spirit and how he establishes new traditions for the Cullens (my favorite touch is his absolutely made-up ""old Portuguese tradition based on the legend of the one red candle""). And maybe the most fun moment surfaces when Jennifer and Morgan try to procure the rare Rocket Wheel bike for Jennifer's kid. That alley scrap unfolds in awesome ways.And, of course, what's a romantic movie without a mad dash to the airport at the end? See? Predictable, but oh so much fun!

In fact, hers is the only house not decorated with white lights per the unspoken community block agreement (which her neighbor is more than happy to remind her).Even Jennifer's son, Brian, isn't sure if he believes in Santa (but he obviously wants to).Jennifer is engaged to an uptight, somber jeweler who throws money at everything and everyone, and she's clearly not very happy (even though he's a ""solid"" match).Enter Uncle Ralph, a retired policeman played by Henry Winkler (The Fonz!), who flies in for Christmas to stay with Jennifer and Brian. Winker is endearing (naturally) and happens to bring along a stranded (and handsome) fellow passenger.The rest of The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is rather predictable, but it's one of the more better-acted and better-written holiday romances. I admit to shedding a few tears at the ""down-to-the-wire"", triumphantly joyous ending. It's a feel good movie, for sure, and my whole family loved it (even my 13-year old).However, there's a two inexplicable sour notes in this movie: when Jennifer's syrupy neighbor encourages her to get her lights up for the umpteenth time, Jennifer says under her breath that she's a ""light Nazi"". I bristle at anyone trivializing the Holocaust, especially in such an inane setting.But later in the movie, Henry Winkler's character says to Jennifer's fianc&eacute;'s parents (who are apparently Jewish): ""Oh, I knew a few Jews. They were all thieves"". Considering Winker IS Jewish, I can't believe he agreed to speak those anti-Semitic lines!If you're not bothered by these two examples, then you'll probably love The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.

Olsen,"[4, 6]","Henry Winkler's portrayal of ""Uncle Ralph"" saves this from being just another one of many Christmas movies about a single parent struggling through the holiday and dating someone who isn't right for them. I won't summarize the story, as it has been well covered. I just want to give parents a ""heads up"" about a few things. There is plenty of humor in this movie, but there are some things portrayed as humorous or acceptable to which some parents might object.*Possible Spoilers*An earlier review mentioned the shower scene with the bare back and beyond (which was totally unnecessary). Some may also not appreciate that at different times Morgan and Jennifer each catch the other one wrapped in a towel after they have just stepped out of the shower (to me this was too contrived--once was funny, twice was obvious). There is some profaning of the Lord's name and there is deceit used by several characters and there are negative consequences only once. Morgan lies to an airport employee and threatens a lawsuit so that he and Uncle Ralph can avoid a long line and get bumped to first class. Uncle Ralph videotapes a weather forecast and plays it later to convince his niece that the airport in Denver is still snowed in, when it really isn't. Morgan sets off a locked toy store alarm and waits in the shadows when the police arrive. He surfaces after the owner arrives and police leave so that they can get a toy that was paid for but not picked up on time. (Though not involving deceit, I thought the scene where Morgan lays into the toy store owner with a metal garbage can was  presented as something justifiable and without consequences. Okay, so the store owner was asking for it, but the mother in me bristled. That isn't the kind of behavior I would have wanted my kids to see presented as acceptable--solving our problems with violence.) Jennifer's fiancee hides the letter Morgan leaves for her when he slips out and it isn't discovered until the next day by her son (this is the only time it seems the deceit doesn't achieve the desired result). And finally, Uncle Ralph removes Morgan's passport from his bag so that at the airport he has no form of government issued ID and they won't let him through security.The acting was fine, and the story was entertaining, though predictable.

Either way, I was not impressed with her acting and it totally took away from the story. I got what her character was suppose represent but it was almost like she was a spoiled, snotty brat...with a smile on her face and in her voice. It just didn't it. It seemed forced and unnatural.On the other hand, the actor that played the hero was great. I liked his character and felt his acting was done well. Smooth, natural, a character you can fall in love with. Which is really too bad that one character/actress had to ruin it for the entire movie.Good thing I'd purchased this movie in a two pack, along with ""Moonlight & Mistletoe"" Now that's a movie I could watch over and over.",3,IT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,913,"['Most', 'Wonderful', 'Time', 'Year-This', 'movie', 'sounded', 'great', 'something', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'heroine', 'ruined', 'Not', 'sure', 'was', 'actress', 'just', 'way', 'performed', 'part', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'acting', 'totally', 'took', 'away', 'story', 'got', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'suppose', 'represent', 'was', 'almost', 'was', 'spoiled', 'snotty', 'brat', 'smile', 'face', 'voice', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seemed', 'forced', 'unnatural.On', 'other', 'hand', 'actor', 'played', 'hero', 'was', 'great', 'liked', 'character', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'Smooth', 'natural', 'character', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'Which', 'really', 'too', 'bad', 'one', 'character/actress', 'had', 'ruin', 'entire', 'movie.Good', 'thing', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'movie', 'two', 'pack', 'Moonlight', 'Mistletoe', 'Now', 'movie', 'could', 'watch']",The Most Wonderful Time of the Year

Although the story is somewhat predictable, the scenes are played out with tenderness, sensitivity and yes, humor. Henry Winkler is wonderful as Uncle Ralph, the devoted father-figure to single mother, Jennifer Cullen (Brooke Burns). When Ralph, on his way to spend Christmas with his niece, runs into free-spirit wanderer, Morgan Derby (Warren Christie)at the airport, the two develop an immediate friendship. When Morgan's flight to Denver is cancelled, well, let's just say that's where the fun begins as Uncle Ralph talks Jennifer into letting Morgan stay at her house until another flight can be scheduled. The film's description decribes Jennifer as a ""Scroogette"", but I feel that is a bit of an overstatement. She is happy enough and tries hard to get in the spirit of the season...but she is overwhelmed with the ""shoulds"" and ""musts"" that are certain to sabotage her holiday cheer. To make matters worse she is dating a man whose pretentious and irritating demeanor are obvious to Uncle Ralph, who, by the way, makes no bones in expressing how he feels. The film unfolds with Morgan alternately helping and ticking off Jennifer, who feels his presence in the house ""looks bad"". Jennifer's son, Brian, forges a bond with Morgan and is upset when Christmas morning finds Morgan gone (I won't spoil your viewing experience by revealing the details). The film has a happy ending, though. Let's just say that Uncle Ralph has the satisfaction of knowing that he has played his cards quite well indeed! This is a lovely film...romance, sweetness and humor all rolled up into one little holiday package.

In particular, I've always like Henry Winkler, though he hasn't always been able to get the good roles that will make us want him to get lifetime achievement awards.  I almost was waiting for him to do something wacky in this movie, but fortunately, he played his matchmaker/uncle role very well.The Christmas season and Christmas magic will usually explain some of the way people fall in love in these movies, but I'd still like for there to be some chemistry or signs of interest.  I liked how the male protagonist gives clues that he likes the lady, but I really didn't see how she in turn, was even considering him.  So you can probably guess that they'll end up together by the end of the movie, but for me, it wasn't as magical and sentimental a journey as other movies since I felt like it was a bit contrived just to try to give this ""happy"" ending.  Even the guy she was dating wasn't exactly a horrible person (throughout the movie) to make us want to cheer about her getting together with the male lead.I still like it enough to watch every year as I go through my holiday collection, but it didn't really fill me with any sense of Christmas wonder that some other movies have done.Another disappointing part has to do with the DVD product itself.
