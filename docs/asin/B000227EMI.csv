821336,A2F1FP9DWAWMNB,B000227EMI,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I did regular cardio my first trimester but started this video in the second and mostly last trimester. It was great for toning arms, opening up the hips, getting the gluts strong, core work. I did the cardio section with 5 lb weights in hand and some times with leg weights. The cardio was sufficient but not quite enough for me but on noncardio days this was perfect. I especially loved the end exercise where you do arm circles for 5 min to mimic labor pain and learn to work through it. I admit it feels nowhere near what a contraction feels like but it is an exercise to teach you how to bear through a tough time .  It really tones the triceps. Also the leg section is great for inner and outer thigh and flexibility. She has a fake hair ponytail that looks silly but other than that I enjoy watching and doing this video and it definitely has the toning you will need to maintain your muscle and build some for labor day. My non pregnant friends did this video with me and they felt sore the next day.

821339,A2NYLGHJ9RNKGK,B000227EMI,bmkd,"[7, 7]","A couple of months before I got pregnant, I had started doing pilates trying to get in shape. Then, I got pregnant and I had a very shaky first trimester with bleeding, so I didn't exercise at all. Now, I'm well into my second trimester, and my doctor gave me the ok to exercise. I was searching for a pregancy workout DVD and came across this one. It got great reviews, although I was a little scared that the workout might be to hard for me, since I hadn't exercised in a while. But, let me tell you, I'm glad I took a chance with this DVD! The first time I did the workout, I had to pause the DVD 3-4 times to take a break, but I felt really good afterward. I was a little sore the next day, but in a good way. I did the workout again the next day, and I only had to pause the DVD once to take a brake. So, already I'm improving my shape. I even finished the ""Keep up"" exercise, which I couldn't do the first time around. I really love this workout. All the major muscle groups in the body are being worked. Best of all, throughout the whole workout, my belly felt safe and comfortable. The warm up section is very relaxing but leaves you warm all over. The workout is well explained and the instructor is not the least bit annoying. Her voice is very pleasant. Seeing her toned, pregnant body really motivates me to get in shape. There are no silly dance moves to follow, and no jerky movements or sudden change of direction. Just a good toning all over. The cool down section feels great and leaves you stretched and relaxed. I'm complementing this workout with walking and riding my stationary bike for cardio. Some people commented about the dark background and the music, but you really stop noticing those once you get into the workout. The equipment needed to do the workout is simple: a chair, some pillows, hand weights (optional), and a step stool (optional). I also like that there are three levels, beginners, intermediate, and advanced, so the workout can grow with your increasing level of fitness. Before starting the workout, do yourself a favor and watch the instructional segment. It really explains all the upcoming exercises in detail, how to do them safely, and which muscles are being targeted. It also shows you how to use the equipment correctly. It even includes a test to check for separation of the abdominal muscles. I know this DVD costs a little more than some of the other ones, but it's worth every penny. I really love this workout, and I'm looking forward to it every day. After the baby is born, I will get myself back into shape with ""The Perfect Postnatal Workout,"" which also features Karyne Steben.",5,Great workout DVD,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,2640,"['couple', 'months', 'got', 'pregnant', 'had', 'started', 'doing', 'pilates', 'trying', 'get', 'shape', 'Then', 'got', 'pregnant', 'had', 'very', 'shaky', 'first', 'trimester', 'bleeding', 'did', ""n't"", 'exercise', 'Now', ""'m"", 'well', 'second', 'trimester', 'doctor', 'gave', 'ok', 'exercise', 'was', 'searching', 'pregancy', 'workout', 'DVD', 'came', 'one', 'got', 'great', 'reviews', 'was', 'little', 'scared', 'workout', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'had', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'while', 'let', 'tell', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'had', 'pause', 'DVD', '3-4', 'times', 'take', 'break', 'felt', 'really', 'good', 'afterward', 'was', 'little', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'good', 'way', 'did', 'workout', 'again', 'next', 'day', 'only', 'had', 'pause', 'DVD', 'once', 'take', 'brake', 'So', 'already', ""'m"", 'improving', 'shape', 'even', 'finished', 'Keep', 'up', 'exercise', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'love', 'workout', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups', 'body', 'are', 'being', 'worked', 'Best', 'whole', 'workout', 'belly', 'felt', 'safe', 'comfortable', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'very', 'relaxing', 'warm', 'over', 'workout', 'well', 'explained', 'instructor', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'annoying', 'voice', 'very', 'pleasant', 'Seeing', 'toned', 'pregnant', 'body', 'really', 'get', 'shape', 'are', 'silly', 'dance', 'moves', 'follow', 'jerky', 'movements', 'sudden', 'change', 'direction', 'Just', 'good', 'toning', 'cool', 'down', 'section', 'feels', 'great', 'stretched', 'relaxed', ""'m"", 'complementing', 'workout', 'walking', 'riding', 'stationary', 'bike', 'cardio', 'people', 'commented', 'dark', 'background', 'music', 'really', 'stop', 'noticing', 'get', 'workout', 'equipment', 'needed', 'do', 'workout', 'simple', 'chair', 'pillows', 'hand', 'weights', 'optional', 'step', 'stool', 'optional', 'also', 'like', 'are', 'three', 'levels', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'workout', 'can', 'grow', 'increasing', 'level', 'fitness', 'starting', 'workout', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'instructional', 'segment', 'really', 'upcoming', 'exercises', 'detail', 'how', 'do', 'safely', 'muscles', 'are', 'being', 'targeted', 'also', 'how', 'use', 'equipment', 'correctly', 'even', 'test', 'check', 'separation', 'abdominal', 'muscles', 'know', 'DVD', 'little', 'more', 'other', 'ones', 'worth', 'penny', 'really', 'love', 'workout', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'day', 'baby', 'born', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'Perfect', 'Postnatal', 'Workout', 'also', 'Karyne', 'Steben']",The Perfect Pregnancy Workout VHS

821341,A2HH7M22508OV8,B000227EMI,Carlos,"[4, 4]","I was working out regularly before becoming pregnant (this is my 4th pregnancy), but the first trimester morning sickness kept me from doing anything (I just threw up all the time and laid on the couch or in bed). Once I started feeling better and was eating enough again to have energy, I was ready to challenge my muscles and strengthen my body. I could tell I was really weak and I was gaining more weight at that point in my pregnancy than in my others. I bought this DVD and it has been a lifesaver! It stretches and relaxes the parts of my 22-week-pregnant body that just need a little extra attention. It works my muscles that have been unused for too long and it's helping curb the too-quick weight gain I was worried about. I like that she incorporates kegels into the workout and I think I will be the strongest post-pregnancy that I've ever been if I keep with this workout. You can push yourself as much as you like with the different levels, and even pause the DVD and add a few more sets if you eventually feel it's not enough. It's nothing fancy--just a woman in a gym (not even a nice-looking backdrop) with kind of funky music, but she's mellow and much better than some really peppy aerobics instructor. I'm really glad I found this workout. I tried some other pregnancy yoga videos and they were so easy and did nothing--even with my weakened muscles.

I was an advanced exerciser before this pregnancy However, I hadn't exercised in over a month so I felt out of shape. As my strength increased and my ""muscle memory"" returned this DVD got way too easy.  I added more weight and was doing the advanced positions (most of them) and just didn't feel like I was really getting a good workout.  This was just after the 1st week of doing this DVD.  I quickly switched to something else that would give me a better workout.I know now why.  You only have one set of each exercise.  After much reading about exercise and what is the most effective type, 2-3 sets is recommended to gain the most strength, important for labor and delivery.  It doesn't matter if you're pregnant, you can continue your same routine during pregnancy just lower the intensity, impact, make a few modications, and take more frequent breaks if necessary.  Not to mention keep well hydrated and cool.This is my 2nd pregnancy and I have read a couple pregnancy fitness books + I worked with a trainer 2 years ago and I was told some invaluable information.  I know what I'm saying.This DVD is fine if you're an intermediate, just make sure you listen to your body as I question some of the exercises safety and form.I think the instructor seems very nice and pleasant, but she is not a trainer and doesn't know proper exercise technique.  She's an acrobat for cirque de soleil.If you want a decent toning prenatal DVD check out the one by Summer Sanders.

Stempien,"[1, 1]","I order the Perfect Pregnancy Workout because I wanted to stay active in my pregnancy (besides hiking and walking) but could not find any prenatal fitness classes in the area that fit my schedule and budget. So after going through review I decided to try this one.It is a toning and strengthening exercise that takes 45 minutes, but covers everything from labor squats to tricep dips to kegels. I really like it. Karyne offers a variety of exercise levels for some of the exercises from beginner to intermediate to advance. The intermediate and advance will do variations of the exercises using a step or hand-weights. I started out with the intermediate, thinking I am pretty active, but quickly had to go to beginner. That actually made me happy knowing that while the exercises were difficult and frustration (they are actually simple moves), they are challenging and I can grow with the DVD for the remaining 22 weeks of pregnancy.The production quality is not high end, it is simply her in a gymnastic studio completing the exercises. However I feel like the camera shows how she is doing the movements and her verbal descriptions are clear, which is what I prefer over elaborate designs and camerawork. My only &#34;criticism&#34; is that in the DVD menu the description of the movements is after the Play Workout tab. For the first time I made the mistake of just hitting play and went right into the workout and got lost and flustered with some of the moves, but when I actually went through the movement instructions first the second workout went a lot better.",4,Great workout to start with and advance with.,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,1569,"['order', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'wanted', 'stay', 'active', 'pregnancy', 'hiking', 'walking', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'prenatal', 'fitness', 'classes', 'area', 'fit', 'schedule', 'budget', 'So', 'going', 'review', 'decided', 'try', 'one.It', 'toning', 'strengthening', 'exercise', '45', 'minutes', 'covers', 'everything', 'labor', 'squats', 'tricep', 'dips', 'kegels', 'really', 'Karyne', 'variety', 'exercise', 'levels', 'exercises', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advance', 'intermediate', 'advance', 'will', 'do', 'variations', 'exercises', 'using', 'step', 'hand-weights', 'started', 'out', 'intermediate', 'thinking', 'am', 'pretty', 'active', 'quickly', 'had', 'go', 'beginner', 'actually', 'made', 'happy', 'knowing', 'exercises', 'were', 'difficult', 'frustration', 'are', 'actually', 'simple', 'moves', 'are', 'challenging', 'can', 'grow', 'DVD', 'remaining', '22', 'weeks', 'pregnancy.The', 'production', 'quality', 'not', 'high', 'end', 'simply', 'gymnastic', 'studio', 'completing', 'exercises', 'However', 'feel', 'camera', 'how', 'doing', 'movements', 'verbal', 'descriptions', 'are', 'clear', 'what', 'prefer', 'elaborate', 'designs', 'camerawork', 'My', 'only', '34', 'criticism', '34', 'DVD', 'description', 'movements', 'Play', 'Workout', 'tab', 'first', 'time', 'made', 'mistake', 'just', 'hitting', 'play', 'went', 'right', 'workout', 'got', 'lost', 'flustered', 'moves', 'when', 'actually', 'went', 'movement', 'instructions', 'first', 'second', 'workout', 'went', 'lot', 'better']",The Perfect Pregnancy Workout VHS

If you don't have much time, and/or have another kid or kids who may wake up while you're trying to work-out, then it's much better to have a dvd that is in shorter sections (like Leeza Hardt).

I really can't say enough about how much I like this.  The instructor is cute and not annoying at all.  She's also in great shape and very pregnant, which is good motivation!  There's a great tutorial section to help you know how to do the exercises and what ones to expect.  I don't ever feel like I'm hurting something or worried about injuries, again unlike some other prenatal workouts I've tried.  This is my second pregnancy, and I've bought/tried two other workouts on top of the one I had from my first pregnancy.  This is by far my favorite.  To give you an idea on level, I'd say this is at least intermediate.  Although, she gives modifications for beginner, intermediate, and advanced, so it's easy to adjust as needed.  I run 3-4 times a week and do yoga or strength twice a week. I do the advance or intermediate options for all the exercises.

Before I became pregnant, I exercised quite a bit, and was in moderate shape. I've miscarried twice in the past and both times always exercised during the pregnancies. So, this time around, I guess you could say I've been a little paranoid about working out. Up until the 3rd trimester I took long walks but that was it. Anyway, I had ordered this DVD months back and at about 29 weeks decided to give it a go. I didn't push myself at all, stuck to beginner levels, and still it was extremely challenging for me. Later that night I had Braxton Hicks contractions and the baby was moving, kicking, stretching like crazy. My muscles and joints were in a lot of pain, but NOT the good kind of pain.

821375,A35AZI8ZY6FC6R,B000227EMI,SublimeLife,"[4, 4]","I have 4 prenatal videos so I'll mention them and compare them to this one. Skip the end of this review for my favorite to least favorite ranking.These are my videos listed in the order they were purchased:- Prenatal yoga - shiva rea- Perfect Pregnancy Workout- Neice Pachenka's Pilates while Pregnant- Leisa Hart's Fit MamaI started the Prenatal workouts in my 7th week, I'm a competitive cyclist and workout regularly. I had an injury and modified my workouts to Yoga Shakti with Shiva Rea -- a wonderful DVD by the way. When I learned I was pregnant I was looking for something to challenge me gently and safely. So I boughtPrenatal Yoga With Shiva Reaand then stumbled uponThe Perfect Pregnancy Workoutbased on reviews. It's much better than the Prenatal Yoga DVD in terms of feeling like an actual workout. Prenatal Yoga is well done but extremely gentle. So if that's what you're looking for, it's got yoga, kegels, lots of great stretching and soothing music, and candles. **Note**  there are NO yoga mats used in this video, all the work is done on carpet with blankets and chairs. I used my yoga mat and felt more grounded, carpet is quite slippery when barefoot. I'm not sure why Shiva chose to skip the yoga mats, seems risky for the 2nd & 3rd trimester women. Also, my copy did not have the partner massage, which is one reason why I bought it. Overall, I'd give this one 2 stars.I'm in my 3rd month now and have moved to weight training and walking outside, but plan to resume doing this DVD soon. I grew bored and needed a change. My advice is to find several DVDs that you like and use them in rotation. I liked this one so much I did it too often and finally switched toPilates During Pregnancyfor a month or so. I found Neice's DVD easy to follow and handy to use the way it's split between abs and legs(hips). I brought it with me when I traveled and was able to do the workout anywhere I had my laptop. It's a 4 star DVD, you definitely feel it in your lower half -- but there's no addressing your arms, shoulders, and back, something I really needed and missed.One word of warning, as much as I enjoyed the Perfect Pregnancy workout I had some trouble shifting from one exercise to the other. I had to stop the  DVD to pull out my chair and my step and sometimes had to rewind. I also had a tough time seeing the advanced exercises. The DVD shows both regular and advanced in the same window so it can get confusing if you're not used to it. Best to watch it all the way through first -- maybe a few times -- and be prepared to stop and rewind if you need to.Perfect Pregnancy focuses on arms, back, and shoulders quite a bit. Many of the other prenatal videos do not. It's tank top season so I need all the help I can get! Their are 2 types of dips for triceps, shoulder push-ups that I've never seen before -- but wow do they work! There's a swimming type exercise that can be done with hand weights, this one works shoulders, triceps,lats, and deltoids. As others have mentioned the incorporation of kegels at  multiple points throughout the DVD is excellent. Overall, it does seem to be the ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" that I've found so far. I happily give it 5 stars.Leisa Hart's Fit Mama Prenatal Workoutis not what I had hoped for. She starts with dance steps that feel a bit lame to me, I love to dance so maybe it's what she's saying about being sexy or it's the repetitive nature of the moves. I dance during that time but I don't follow her steps. I enjoy the yoga fat burn section a lot, it focuses on thighs and glutes and I really feel it. The stretches and kegels that follow are also quite good. I'd place this DVD above Prenatal Yoga in terms of it's intensity and feeling like a workout. I'd give this one 3 stars.Here's my order of preference, favorite (& most effective) to least favorite of all 4 of these videos.1) Perfect Pregnancy Workout *****2) Neice Pachenka's Pilates while Pregnant ****3) Leisa Hart's Fit Mama ***4) Prenatal yoga - shiva rea **(Shiva Rea - Yoga Shakti is wonderful if you're not pregnant)If you really want a solid exercise plan, you can't go wrong with Perfect Pregnancy Workout. It's well produced with lots of information and detail about what happens to your body while your pregnant as well as what to be aware of when working out.
