1412382,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004KO1ONO,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[4, 4]","Sarah's Choice & Hidden Secrets are without a doubt FAITH BASED movies. It is the content's intent to promote a specific lean on what are often controversial issues. So without attempting to delve into the pros and cons of any social, religious, or political issues, this pair of movies do provide entertainment, with a mix of good performances with some stars as well as lesser known actors. Both films are also available individually, or used, having been previously released in 2009 and 2008 respectively. The religious tendency is toward a Christian point of view, but the issues are personal and often confronted by many of different faith persuasions.SARAH'S CHOICE is led by singer, Rebecca St. James, as Sarah. She's not new to faith based movies, and even has more in the works as supporting and lead actress. She does a believable job as a young advancing female businesswoman who becomes pregnant and has to consider how it might influence her life/career. She considers ALL choices, including abortion. Actually the film presents arguments on both sides of the issue, but obviously favors the Christian perspective. Dick Van Patten plays his first clergy role, perhaps better known for his late 70s TV series ""Eight is Enough"". Funny man Brad Stein has some funny lines, but actually plays more of a straight serious uncle here, especially as compared with his role inChristmas with a Capital C.Sarah's colleague Megan is played by Logan White, has also co-produced herself in ""Hidden Secrets"". Her husband, David A.R.White, produced in both films in this combo DVD set, as well as acted & wrote in ""Hidden Secrets.""HIDDEN SECRETS also stars John Schneider (yes, from Dukes of Hazard) who is a bit of the successful bad guy in this film. It's an interesting story with plenty of comedy as well as some very serious moments. It leaves the viewer entertained as well as thinking on some important issues of life. It is one of White's better roles. The plot is about friends gathering to bury a member of their `gang' of long ago. Of course lives have changed, secrets between them have to be re-encountered, and personalities begin to unfold, sometimes in conflict. It's a masterful mix of subplots and a wonderfully made film. A step ahead of most faith based films. They are getting better; they have to, to compete with the likes of ""Fireproof"" andCourageous.Both films are worth the time of viewing. But expect a Christian influenced direction in the outcomes of characters in both movies. It IS the reason for producing them.",5,Some life issues faced in both films.

Good movie for familes and youth groups alike.Hidden Secrets was also good.  I won't go into details about the story line since it has already been throughly covered.
