The first movie was a cute romantic comedy and left viewers to use their imagination as to what might happen later.  They then made the second one and it has different actors and is not at all as expected.  Paige went home to finish her studies so why is she suddenly studying in a different county?  Why has so many of the actors changed (because they had sense enough to realize this was a stupid movie) and why does Paige still want this guy when he so quickly decides to marry the other girl just because she hasn't learned the language?  (I know it was only suppose to be a few years later but her parents really changed - older actors who were overweight from the younger trim farmers in the first movie)  I actally watched the second movie even though I didn't like it and decided to give this one a try.  I have to be honest and say that I have never sat through this complete movie at one time.  I fall asleep or just give up and walk out of the room.

It seems like soap opera acting, with typecast characters. Neither the king nor the queen exude the charisma one would expect from royalty. Much of the storyline is simply unbelievable (does anybody think the ""evil"" prime minister would really whip out a sword and attack the king?). Furthermore, the film looks like it was made on a budget - rather than showing HD-quality scenes of wildlife with the actors, the movie appears to use older footage of wildlife from documentaries that was simply spliced into the movie (at some points, the lighting and tone of the snow in the wildlife shots are slightly different than the rest of the scenes).The saving grace for this movie is that it is not entirely predictable and the plot takes some twists and turns (some for the worse). I also appreciated that the king and queen were depicted as having a relatively mature relationship - not dramatically breaking up for a year over a silly miscommunication, as seems so prevalent in romantic comedies (for example, ""Baby on Board"").

The major positive difference was that the actor playing the King appeared to actually want to be there. In The Prince and Me 2 it was fairly obvious that Luke Mably did NOT want to be in the film.The major negative difference was the terrible, awful, worst I have ever seen actor they found to play the Scott character. I can't think of another actor (and here I use the word actor loosely) that came near the swfulness of this guy. Where did they find this guy? He had no sense of the flow of the movie. He most reminded me of someone whose idea of acting was to stand in front of a camera and say his lines.Without the actor playing Scott this movie would have stood a chance. Not even close to the original Prince and Me with Julia Stiles but still much better than the second one.
