1150507,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B0015PT8P2,D.P.,"[0, 0]","This was one of those ""under the radar"" releases that WWE always releases around WrestleMania time as it originally came out in 2008 showcasing some of the top names of the past & present in one of their most memorable or significant recent encounters while doing a small highlight package on the superstar before the match.Matches Include:Hulk Hogan vs. WWE Champion Sgt. Slaughter - This was during the time that the U.S.A. was in the first ""Gulf War"" against Iraq so WWE decided to play off it with Hogan playing the American Hero & Sgt. Slaughter turning heel being a sympathizer to Iraq & also making it clear that he had no issues getting disqualified or counted out in order to regain his title. Hogan showed his power advantage early powering Slaughter down shoving him down & shoulderblocks while showing no effect of distractions by Gen. Adnan or an attempt at using a chair as he just kept taking it right to him to the point where it seemed like he was more concerned about beating up Slaughter than winning the match. Hogan went out of his element for a moment opening the door for Slaughter to finally take control using tactics like choking using the cable cords, using Adnan for distractions & extra advantage, and using the chair various times including busting Hogan open while also trying to humiliate Hogan putting the Iraq flag over his body. This was your typical Hogan performance here but Slaughter did play the part well of a heel who used every dirty tactic in the book knowing that he would keep his title if he got caught.WrestleMania VII[Hulk Hogan: Ultimate Anthology]Batista vs. World Champion Triple H - Motorhead performed Triple H to the ring while he also had Ric Flair in his corner. Batista showed his power advantage early with impactful moves like a high back body drop & powerslam causing Flair to keep getting involved for Triple H to get the advantage. Triple H proceeded to show why he's the ""cerebral assassin"" by focusing on Batista's back using the guardrail along with other moves like the suplex, backbreaker, and spinebuster. The action spilled over the floor where the steel steps came into play for both men to the point where Triple H was busted open as a result with Batista just continuing to just pound on his bleeding head. Flair again attempted to get involved only for Batista to take him out & continued to ""unleash the animal"" as he was able to power out of the pedigree & dominate his way to his first World Championship.WrestleMania 21[Batista: I Walk Alone]Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho - Shawn's WrestleMania return here didn't start off well as two of this pyro guns didn't go off & were duds. Both men exchanged wrestling early on with headlocks & armlocks Shawn attempted to work over Jericho's leg with moves like a figure four while Jericho worked over his back with various moves like a vertical suplex, the Walls Of Jericho on the outside, and ramming Shawn's back into the ringpost twice. Jerry Lawler made the comment that ""both men are so similar that it's almost like wrestling yourself"" which we saw apply to Jericho various times such as using Shawn's trademark moves like his flying forearm & Sweet Chin Music while Shawn pulled out some tricks of his own like the countering a suplex into a crossbody. This was definitely a quality match fitting of Shawn's reputation of ""Mr. WrestleMania.""WrestleMania XIX[Shawn Michaels: Mr. WrestleMania; Shawn Michaels: My Journey; Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - ""The Legend Killer"" was out to end the legend of Undertaker's streak as Orton kept trying to go for quick covers early to no avail. Both men would go on to exchange punches with Taker attempting his Dragon Sleeper submission that was countered into a DDT & later countering the chokeslam into an RKO as both men traded momentum causing Randy to resort to desperate tactics including an appearance from his father using his trademark cast on his arm before Orton's overconfidence at one point came back to haunt him & cost him the match. Orton came into this match with an injury that would eventually have him out of action throughout the spring & summer so this was as good as it could be taking that into consideration as they would go on to have better matches throughout the rest of the year.WrestleMania 21[Undertaker: The Streak]Hardcore Match: Edge vs. Mick Foley - Edge went on the offense right away using a cookie sheet & even executing a baseball slide into a road sign but it was when he attempted a spear that for some reason hurt himself more than Foley & causing his shoulder to bleed in the process as he revealed a strand of barbed wire wrapped around his waist underneath his flannel shirt. Foley continued to whip Edge across his bare back with the wire with Lita getting involved only for Foley to do his famous Cactus clothesline over the top rope with Lita on his back going over as well. They started to brawl on the outside with Foley thrown into the steps more than once & head whipped back onto the ramp before Foley own weapon of ""Barbie"" was used against him. Edge ended up taking more punishment of his own when he took a drop onto thumbtacks, a barbed wire ""Mr. Socko"" that Lita even felt the effects of, and ""Barbie"" resulting in Edge bleeding before he was able to give a spear to Foley that resulted in not only such a visual but also Mick Foley finally getting his ""WrestleMania Moment.""WrestleMania 22[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: Hardcore Edition; Edge: Decade Of Decadance; O.M.G.: Top 50 Moments]Bret Hart vs. WWE Champion Yokozuna - A couple of notes here in that ""90210"" star Jenny Garth was the special guest timekeeper, Burt Reynolds was the special guest ring announcer, Roddy Piper was the special guest referee, and this was both men's second match of the night.  Bret was still showing effects of his previous match against his brother Owen earlier in the night as he was limping to the ring before Yoko attacked him coming into the ropes & dominated with various hard strikes such as a headbutts & chops that knocked Bret down while Bret kept trying to come back with various strikes to knock Yoko down including a headbutt that ended up knocking down men down as both men traded momentum as Yoko kept trying to rely on his size while Bret was attempting to use his speed to keep knocking Yoko off his feet.  This wasn't their best encounter but told a good story with Piper only adding to the match as a referee showing that he wasn't going to take anything from anyone in or outside of the ring.WrestleMania XThe Rock vs. Hulk Hogan - Despite Hogan's actions going into this match, he was clearly the crowd favorite from the start which helped build his momentum as Hogan kept knocking Rock down showing his strength which caused Rock to rebound with his athleticism as he knocked Hogan down with a running flying clothesline & punched Hogan out the ring as they kept trading momentum with one man taking the other down & beating on each other in the corner only for the other to return the favor right afterwords. Hogan was able to gain the advantage with his power using a chokeslam to power Rock down before using dirty tactics such as choking with the wrist tape, a low blow, using his weight belt, and stealing Rock's own Rock Bottom but The Rock recovered using the belt against Hogan along with his Rock Bottom before Hogan did his classic ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & leg drop which the Rock kicked out of & came back with two back to back Rock Bottom & People's Elbow. Jerry Lawler had the one line after this match that perfectly describes this match, ""It did more than live up to the hype, it surpassed it"" as Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Hogan & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild. The audience reacted to every move they made from picking the side that wasn't planned before going into this match to how they went crazy for everything that happened after the match as everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.WrestleMania X-8[The Rock: The Most Electrfying Man In Sports Entertainment; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; History Of WWE: 50 Years Of Sports Entertainment; True Story Of WrestleMania]John Cena vs. WWE Champion J.B.L. - J.B.L. had a great entrance with the Presidential limo & police escort into the arena but it goes downhill from there as it was basically J.B.L. beating down Cena throughout the whole match only for Cena hits three strong moves, the F.U., and wins the match. This was definitely one of the worst WWE Championship matches in history & a horrible way (even foreshadowing on some people's opinions) to begin the first of many title reigns of John Cena & his beginning of being the top guy in the company.WrestleMania 21Rey Mysterio vs. World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - P.O.D. performed Rey Mysterio to the ring as Orton attacked Kurt with the belt right from the start with Angle responding with not only a german suplex on Orton but another one on him & Mysterio at the same time before giving an assist to Rey lifting him up in the air for a top rope frankensteiner allowing Rey to take control as he was able to roll through a sunset flip attempt into a knockout kick followed by a head scissor takeover however Angle was able to counter an attempted 6-1-9 attempt into the anklelock & later catching Orton in the anklelock with the referee distracted both times as he kept deliver impactful german suplexes & an Angle Slam that sent one challenger over the top rope only for each man to come back with a big move from Orton's RKO to Angle's top rope belly to belly suplex & Rey delivering a 6-1-9 around the ring post before it came down to come man being able to ""divide & conquer"" long enough to get the victory. This was what a triple threat was designed to be in that it was non-stop action from all three men delivering one big move after another with each man looking like they had a chance but the major downfall of this (depending on how you want to look at it) is that this match was under 10 minutes when you would expect more from a World Championship match at WrestleMania.WrestleMania 22[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man; Top 50 Superstars]Triple H vs. WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho - Both men came into this WrestleMania main event switching roles from what they've had in the past against each other as Chris Jericho was the champion & accompanied by HHH's ex-wife Stephanie McMahon while Triple H walked into this match as the challenger & fan favorite looking for revenge for not only Jericho injuring his quad almost a year earlier but also getting his revenge on Stephanie for all the problems she put him through for weeks. Triple H had his knee wrapped up from a previous attack with the sledgehammer a week earlier on RAW as Jericho kept trying to attack it while Triple H ended up hurting it himself when he did a high knee yet still was able to get some offense in such as launching Jericho off the top rope into the front row before suplexing him back ringside & working over his leg with a figure four. Stephanie was able to cause a distraction allowing Jericho to once again target the leg using the ringpost along with drilling the leg into the match causing Triple H to heavily favor the leg as he kept hurting it when he went on the offense including the fight on the announce table that left an opening for Jericho to turn the tables on Triple H & eventually apply the Walls Of Jericho. This match had a lot of issues going into it such as the buildup itself revolved about Triple H's issues with Stephanie more than Chris Jericho as Jericho was booked as a secondary figure despite being the Undisputed Champion (you'll see evidence of this if you watch the highlight package as he was walking Stephanie's dog & cleaning up it's poop) so it was all about when he going to finally get his hands on Stephanie while another factor was that this match went on last when Hogan vs. Rock went on two matches earlier & completely exhausted the crowd to the point where nobody was able to follow it as the crowd was dead for a majority of the match. They told a good story in regards to Triple H's leg & made up for this match months later with a Hell In A Cell match but the match had so much going against it going in that it wasn't going to live up to the hype of a WrestleMania main event.WrestleMania X-8[Triple H: That Damn Good]Steve Austin vs. WWE Champion The Rock - Austin came out in a t-shirt instead of his usual vest & took the fight to The Rock quickly as they brawled through the crowd to the stage area back to ringside with Austin dropping two elbow drops on Rock through the spanish table. A chair was put into play that caused the referee to accidentally get hit while Rock later used the chair to attack Austin all over his body before another referee was taken out. With Vince McMahon making his way to ringside along with the original special guest referee for this match, this was a match that lived up to the hype.WrestleMania XV[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment; Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]Now the superstars who were & weren't showcased along with the match selection will always be questionable but a majority of the matches on here were quality encounters in their own right (with the exception of the John Cena match).  In the end, those who are hardcore collectors should already have all of these matches in their collection & aren't missing anything here but this is a nice collection that I only recommend for those who are casual DVD collectors.",4,"Past & Present Superstars Of The ""Showcase Of The Immortals""",1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,13957,"['was', 'one', 'radar', 'WWE', 'always', 'WrestleMania', 'time',

1150508,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0015PT8P2,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[4, 4]","THE GREATEST SUPERSTARSOF WRESTLEMANIAThe Greatest Superstars of Wrestlemania is yet another flawed WWE release that really does not live up to the title, simply because they left out some people. I believe with all my heart that of all people Randy Savage deserved to be on this collection no matter what is going on between him and Vince. Another person who needed to be on here was Ric Flair, in fact take out Taker's fight with Orton and add the Taker vs Flair match would have showcased both and since Orton is also on the Rey Mysterio match that would have worked out perfect. Also where is Piper he really needed to be on here, I believe he is the reason the first Wrestlemania was so successful more so then Hogan could have ever been. He was the heel to Hogan's baby face but he was also a huge star because of his interactions with Mr.T. Before each  match they have some cool little mini documentaries about the person they are highlighting.DISC 11.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP]-HULK HOGAN VS SGT. SLAUGHTER-I hate the fact that Hogan comes out second, the champ always comes out second in my mind. With that said I must say that I have never been a Hogan fan, ever. I won't go into a rant about why but just know I never liked that guy and with that said I will also never take any thing away from what he has done. So yes I absolutely agree that he needed to be on this set, not for his wrestling because he has never been a great wrestler but he was always a great entertainer. The dude could entertain and bring in the people and when paired with a great wrestler [Savage, Piper, Flair, Hart, Michaels & so on] he could have a good match., so lucky for him he was up against Sgt. Slaughter who helped make this a good match for Hogan. This was a good match between these two as both played to the crowd real well, Hogan hammed it up as the baby face and Slaughter played it up as the turncoat heel. There is a lot of good action and suspense that make this an enjoyable bout, but it is the psychology of the match that really makes this match shine. Still the typical Hogan ending brings the rating down, boot then leg drop eh.3.8/52.[WWE CHAMPIONSHIP]-BATISTA VS TRIPLE H-again why does the challenger come out second, what is that all about? Any way this was right after Batista refused to go to Smackdown [even though he was heading there any way not to long after] and went up against fellow stable mate Triple H. This is really not a classic match and not as great as some would think, this is a better showcase for Batista [good choice then] but Triple H has had much better. The action is pretty good and goes back and forth but when one has the upper hand they keep it for a while, much like the first match this one runs better off of the psychology of the match, Triple H sells the ending very well.4/53.SHAWN MICHAELS VS CHRIS JERICHO-some people have said that this match is overrated while others have said it was a classic, I tend to agree with the latter. I remember watching this and thinking man this feels like Wrestlemania, unlike the last match that felt like it could have been at any other pay-per-view this one felt like a big time match. For any one who watches these knows that Wrestlemania is the one event where even the under card feels like big time matches, not every time but they are supposed to. This match is great and has a lot of near falls as both these superstars go at it, their story line going into this was great and it showed in the pay off. Their styles in this match were similar but it made for a very interesting story and some classic moments. Both deliver a lot of punishment threw out the match that seems like it could end it, I thought Jericho had it at one point. But luckily HBK pulls it off in a way I have to admit I did not see ending this match, classic.5/54.UNDERTAKER VS RANDY ORTON-these two had a really good rivalry going for a while over on Smackdown, a real living legend against the legend killer.  There is a lot of great action in this match between these two heated rivals; Taker really brings it Orton even throwing over the top after an RKO attempt. Taker really controls most of the match although Randy does take charge at times. This is the most dramatic match up to this point with a lot of close calls, and even the cowboy comes into play. This is a great match and on this set it makes an almost classic rating.4.5/55.[HARDCORE MATCH]-EDGE VS MICK FOLEY-this is probably one of the most enjoyable matches to ever take place at wrestlemania, at least to me. I enjoy this bout every time I watch it and happen to think that it is one of the best matches I have seen, don't know but I like this match. There is a lot to love about this match like it is Foley in a hardcore match, and that the top heel right now Edge is the opponent. But if that is not enough just look to the violence with all the weapons and of course the classic ending involving a flaming table and a beautiful spear. This is a classic in my mind and will live on as one of the best Mania matches in my mind.5/5DISC 26.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP]-BRET HART VS YOKOZUNA-now I have to agree that they could have picked a better match for his Wrestlemania spot on this DVD, but hey Yoko is always cool to see [R.I.P.]. I really think the best choice would have been his classic with Roddy Piper [who is the guest referee] and that could have showcased both of them, especially since Piper deserved to be on here. Also the match he had with his brother Owen from this very same Wrestlemania would have been great. This neither the best match these two ever had at Wrestlemania or from other matches these two had together. But contraire to what people say this is not a terrible match. There is a lot to like about this match like the psychology of the match and the sense that Bret has no chance since because of his earlier match and injury. Plus there are a few good moments of action. Bret pulls off the up set and all the wrestlers from the back come out to congratulate him, look at Luger's face, he hates it.3.5/57.THE ROCK VS HULK HOGAN-now I remember when I watched this one up in Maryland all I could do was wish The Rock would destroy Hogan and send him home. What I got was one of the most memorable clashes of all time, the fans that night made that match what it is. It was because of the fans emotion that they felt in the arena that night that match became timeless, that shot of them two face to face looking at the fans at opposite directions is classic. The start of this match is brilliant as ever time Hogan knocks down The Rock he starts his posing which puts the fans in a frenzy, The Rock doing the same thing is great. Action wise The Rock controls this match obviously since Hulk is a bit older, but Hogan holds his own in there. The Rock comes out on top when the thing end and shakes hands with Hogan afterwards, the emotion alone makes this a classic.5/58.[WWE CHAMPIONSHIP]-JOHN CENA VS JBL-once again why is the champion coming out first, what is this all about? I have always been a fan of both of these guys and yes that includes JBL, Texas baby. I remember when this match was taking place the people just wanted JBL to loose the title, they were ready for a new champ. This match is a little short for a man that held the title as long as JBL did, still I guess that makes it good. There was some good action in this match with JBL dominating much of the match until the surprise end, which really wasn't a surprise. I think this was pretty good match and worth watching.4/59.[WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP]-REY MYSTERIO VS KURT ANGLE VS RANDY ORTON-now this match right is off the hook and like others have said it is very TNA like in its style. To any one who has not seen this match you are missing out. These three go at like only they can each bringing a very different style just destroying each other. The action is fast paced and moves along nicely with Rey coming out on top since he was the emotional favorite to do so. But I still feel that Angle should have won this match with his outstanding performance, Orton as well did a great job.5/510.[UNDISPUTED CHAMPIONSHIP]-TRIPLE H VS CHRIS JERICHO-I thought this match was pretty good even though some people disagree with me. Triple H had just returned and won the Royal Rumble and was after Y2J's undisputed title. The action was pretty good and the two had good chemistry but the pacing was a little slow. Still Hunter's wife being against him added to the match, and it looked at times like he was going to lose. But in the end Triple H pedigrees his wife and wins the title.4/511.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP]-STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN VS THE ROCK-I think this was an excellent match right here. Multiple refs were laid out and there was a nice breaking of a table. Still I think my favorite  part was when they fought threw out the crowd, only adding to the fan frenzy. The action between the two as always was picture perfect, these two had a great chemistry together. Vince interfering is great and Mankind coming out added to the atmosphere, great stuff. Austin takes this one after a stunner.5/5This was a decent collection of matches from some of the best at Wrestlemania, if you can find cheap or used I would recommend it.",4,"NEEDS SAVAGE, PIPER,

I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)The Greatest Superstars of WrestlemaniaAt first glance, you may think this is just WWE trying to make some extra profit off of Wrestlemania this year. This is true, but this is still a DVD worth checking out. If you are one of the people that don't own every single Wrestlemania, like me, you will get to see a lot of Wrestlemania matches. The matches range from greatness, to being classic gems, to being down right horrible. Still, most of this DVD is great and worth your time. This DVD isn't in chronological order; instead it highlights superstar's matches in random orders. This is a nice change from recent WWE DVD sets. You get no Superstar's comments; instead you get a narration to lead you through the DVD. It tells you about the Superstars career briefly before discussing the match; it even features some rare OVW footage. All of the matches are in full.-Disc 1-Hulk HoganWWE Championship (Wrestlemania VII)Sgt. Slaughter(c) VS Hulk HoganAs far as Hogan's matches go, this match is very good. The match seems to drag on a bit too long and not much really is done as far as wrestling goes. Still, the crowd was into it as Slaughter had pledged loyalty to Iraq and the fans hated him.RATING- 7/10BatistaWorld Heavyweight Championship (Wrestlemania 21)Triple H(c) VS BatistaThese two work really well together and always put on great matches. Triple H has his entrance done by Motorhead, which was pretty cool. The match itself sees both men getting good amounts of offence. Triple H bleeds considerably and Batista hits one of the best Powerbombs I've ever seen.RATING- 8.5/10Shawn MichaelsShawn Michaels VS Chris Jericho (Wrestlemania XIX)I would have preferred Michaels/Diesel fromWWE WrestleMania XI, but this is a good choice as well. This is a strong match that shows each superstar well. Jericho is obsessed with beating HBK and proving that he is the better man. There are lots of near falls and classic moments.RATING- 9/10UndertakerLegend VS Legend Killer (Wrestlemania 21)Undertaker VS Randy OrtonOrton turns again and starts his hunt for his next Legend; he finds The Undertaker. The match is fairly slow, but the action doesn't really stop at any point. Orton hits a great RKO from the Chokeslam. Look for appearances from ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton.RATING- 8/10EdgeHardcore Match (Match of the DVD)Mick Foley VS EdgeThis is a masterpiece of a match. Mick Foley wanted a Wrestlemania moment and he's got one now. Barbwire, chairs, cookie sheets, stairs, and even fire all come into play in this match. Both men take a beating and after this match are bloody messes. Mick has had some great Hardcore matches with Triple H (WWE Royal Rumble 2000) and Randy Orton (WWE Backlash 2004) recently, but this match is the best out of all of them.RATING- 10/10-Disc 2-Bret ""Hit Man"" HartWWE Championship (Wrestlemania X)Yokozuna(c) VS Bret HartThis is our first horrible match on the set. Not bad considering this is a cheap exclusive (which oddly enough has made it's way to Amazon). There isn't much except a bunch of slow punches and kicks. Bret was beating by Owen Hart in a much better contest, and now takes on Yokozuna for the WWE Title. This match has good pacing; it's just boring to watch. The horrible ending doesn't help this match either. One thing I can say about this match though is that it's a gem that's not really remembered often.RATING- 4/10The RockThe Rock VS Hollywood Hulk Hogan (Wrestlemania X8)I considered giving this a 9.5, but this match is a perfect ten. It had the crowd interaction that gives it a very special edge. Hogan is getting cheered like crazy despite being in the now; The Rock is getting boos despite being the good guy. This match is filled with close falls and finishers galore.RATING- 10/10John CenaWWE Championship (Wrestlemania 21)JBL(c) VS John CenaThis is our third stop at Wrestlemania 21, and it was an unnecessary stop. This is going to be the worst match on the set. Cena gets pounded for the entire match before he hits a few moves at the end and finally a F-U. The other reviewers aren't lying it's the truth. I would've preferred any of his other Wrestlemania matches to this one.RATING- 2.5/10Rey MysterioWorld Heavyweight Championship (Wrestlemania 22)Kurt Angle(c) VS Rey Mysterio VS Randy OrtonAnother reviewer related this match to something you would find onTNA Wrestling: The Best of the X Division Volume 1. I absolutely agree with him. This match was much too short but it was very fast paced and well done. Angle is the star of this match. The crowd is into Angle the entire match.RATING- 9/10Triple HUndisputed Championship (Wrestlemania X8)Chris Jericho(c) VS Triple HHere we are at our last horrible match. Drowning Pool does the entrance of Triple H. The match was paced weird and the crowd never really got into it. The best part is Triple H pedigreeing his wife, Stephanie McMahon.RATING- 4.5/10Stone Cold Steve AustinWWE Championship (Wrestlemania XV)The Rock VS Stone Cold Steve AustinThis was the worst of their Wrestlemania matches, but it's still an awesome confrontation. They brawl through the crowd and up the entrance ramp to start things off. Austin ends up breaking the announce table after 2 elbow drops on it. 3 referees get knocked out before Mankind provides his services as a referee.RATING- 9/10",4,Not bad for what was intended for a
