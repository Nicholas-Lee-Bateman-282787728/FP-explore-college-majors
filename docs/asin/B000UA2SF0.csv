You'd think at least they'd edit out the closeups. And he doesn't have the voice he used to.

I've been a fan forever, so it's not hard to sell me on Meat Loaf.  He's a man who polarizes people though - you either love him or hate him; there's no middle-crowd.  That said, I think this is the DVD that is capable of the widest appeal to date.Meat Loaf's voice was destroyed years ago by his own reckless overuse and abuse.  I've seen concerts where you'd swear somebody took a mixmaster down his throat and shredded his vocal cords.  You just have to know that you're not going to get a vocally pristine performance from the man these days.  That said, 3 Bats Live offers Meat in quite strong vocal form.  Not perfect by any stretch, but what's important about Meat Loaf isn't that he hits the notes like Celine Dion, it's that he is more invested in singing them to his audience than any other performer in the business today.  He gives 100% into every single performance and really makes you believe that rock, sex, and having a good time are the only important things in the universe.  His connection to and appreciation for his audience is absolutely genuine and one has to respect that he pushes himself on stage right to the bleeding edge and beyond.The tracklist is quite good covering all the high points of the 3 Bat albums with a few covers tossed in for good measure (the Stones' ""Gimmie Shelter"" being the highlight).  ""Blind As A Bat"" comes off as the album's shining moment for me; I thought it was an astounding performance of a great song.  The joy of things is that there aren't any skip-over songs... Meat makes everything interesting.The cinematography is astoundingly good.  The picture is crisp and reflective of the HD mastering that was used.  The colours are intense and the camerawork is first-rate.  The greatest part of the DVD (and the part that sets this concert apart and above the Melbourne DVD) is the DTS audio mix which is phenomenal.  This is a disc that you can pop in to show off your 5.1 system.  The Melbourne concert was a profound disappointment in terms of the surround mix and that mistake has been dramatically fixed here.If you're looking for a concert of perfect, flawless vocals sung by pretty young things that don't have a clue what they're singing about then this is not the disc for you.  If you want to see one of the great rock performers of all time put in an ridiculously intense 2-and-a-half hours of recklessly-abandoned pure rock and roll in a beautifully mastered concert, then add this in to your collection.",5,A study in the intensity of rock.,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,2593,"['DVD', 'was', 'released', 'very', 'quietly', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'HDNet', 'showing', 'cable', ""'d"", 'have', 'never', 'known', 'existed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'forever', 'not', 'hard', 'sell', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'man', 'who', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'middle-crowd', 'said', 'think', 'DVD', 'capable', 'widest', 'appeal', 'date.Meat', 'Loaf', 'voice', 'was', 'destroyed', 'years', 'ago', 'own', 'reckless', 'overuse', 'abuse', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'concerts', 'where', ""'d"", 'swear', 'somebody', 'took', 'mixmaster', 'down', 'throat', 'shredded', 'vocal', 'cords', 'just', 'have', 'know', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'vocally', 'pristine', 'performance', 'man', 'days', 'said', '3', 'Bats', 'Live', 'Meat', 'quite', 'strong', 'vocal', 'form', 'Not', 'perfect', 'stretch', 'what', 'important', 'Meat', 'Loaf', ""n't"", 'notes', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'more', 'invested', 'singing', 'audience', 'other', 'performer', 'business', 'today', '100', '%', 'single', 'performance', 'really', 'believe', 'rock', 'sex', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'only', 'important', 'things', 'universe', 'connection', 'appreciation', 'audience', 'absolutely', 'genuine', 'one', 'respect', 'stage', 'right', 'bleeding', 'edge', 'beyond.The', 'tracklist', 'quite', 'good', 'covering', 'high', 'points', '3', 'Bat', 'albums', 'few', 'covers', 'tossed', 'good', 'measure', 'Stones', 'Gimmie', 'Shelter', 'being', 'highlight', 'Blind', 'A', 'Bat', 'off', 'album', 'shining', 'moment', 'thought', 'was', 'astounding', 'performance', 'great', 'song', 'joy', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'skip-over', 'songs', 'Meat', 'everything', 'interesting.The', 'cinematography', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'picture', 'crisp', 'reflective', 'HD', 'mastering', 'was', 'used', 'colours', 'are', 'intense', 'camerawork', 'first-rate', 'greatest', 'part', 'DVD', 'part', 'concert', 'apart', 'Melbourne', 'DVD', 'DTS', 'audio', 'mix', 'phenomenal', 'disc', 'can', 'pop', 'show', 'off', '5.1', 'system', 'Melbourne', 'concert', 'was', 'profound', 'disappointment', 'terms', 'surround', 'mix', 'mistake', 'been', 'dramatically', 'fixed', 'here.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'concert', 'perfect', 'flawless', 'vocals', 'sung', 'pretty', 'young', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', ""'re"", 'singing', 'then', 'not', 'disc', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'great', 'rock', 'performers', 'time', 'put', 'ridiculously', 'intense', '2-and-a-half', 'hours', 'recklessly-abandoned', 'pure', 'rock', 'roll', 'beautifully', 'mastered', 'concert', 'then', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

I'm astonished that reviews claim this to be Meat Loaf at his best when it clearly is far from it to anyone without talent deafness.

1093768,A2E59ENPEQUMVN,B000UA2SF0,G. Pearson,"[0, 2]","I will begin by saying that I bought this DVD then read the comments by reviewers on Amazon. If I had read the reviews first, I probably wouldn't have bought it and that would have been a huge mistake.Comments relating to singing off key or not singing in time, are inaccurate and if they were correct, this concert would have not been for me. Like many artists at live concerts, Meat Loaf interprets the songs differently to what we are used to hearing on the original studio albums. Artists do this to stop boredom setting in, I believe. Some artists like The Eagles, The Doobies etc. still perform the songs exactly the way they used to in the beginning. Meat Loaf is always in control of what he is doing and is singing the notes he wants to. If his interpretations of the songs constitute singing out of tune to some people, then that is their view and possibly a bit of an insult. We must remember that Bat III was recorded not too long before this concert was, and that album is one of his best !!! He hasn't lost anything !The introductory number (All Revved Up) is very short and Meat Loaf actually doesn't appear at all in this - that's why it is just the intro. Some people have commented that some songs are shorter than the originals - I do not have a problem with this after seeing the DVD. Full versions of all the songs in this mighty programme would see the concert go on for another half an hour !Nice to see CC in the show. Yes, Patti Rousso is not there, but the new female artists do a more than adequate job. They are exellent singers and are not too hard on the eye either - they are not a Patti Rousso but nor is anyone else !The duet ""It's All Coming Back To Me Now"" is simply beautiful and sung with incredible feeling.My two favourite songs off Bat III sound terrific - Blind As A Bat and Bad For Good.It is hard to compare this to the Melbourne concert with the orchestra - both are good and both are different. Having the orchestra in Melbourne meant different arrangements for some numbers. In this concert, arrangements are closer to the album versions.The band is exellent as always. Being a modern recording, the sound and picture quality are superb as you would expect.The 1.5 hour documentary on the second DVD is superb, giving us a look at the build up to the recording of this concert. Even with his experience, Meat Loaf still gets nervous and stressed out.I rate this concert highly and am thrilled to see Meat Loaf perform numbes from Bat III.(Go back to white gum Meat Loaf, the yellow-green material on display here doesn't look quite so good).",5,Meat Loaf Can Still Turn It On !,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,2587,"['will', 'begin', 'saying', 'bought', 'DVD', 'then', 'read', 'comments', 'reviewers', 'Amazon', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'first', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'mistake.Comments', 'relating', 'singing', 'off', 'key', 'not', 'singing', 'time', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'were', 'correct', 'concert', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'many', 'artists', 'live', 'concerts', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'songs', 'differently', 'what', 'are', 'used', 'hearing', 'original', 'studio', 'albums', 'Artists', 'do', 'stop', 'boredom', 'setting', 'believe', 'artists', 'Eagles', 'Doobies', 'etc', 'still', 'perform', 'songs', 'exactly', 'way', 'used', 'beginning', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'always', 'control', 'what', 'doing', 'singing', 'notes', 'interpretations', 'songs', 'constitute', 'singing', 'tune', 'people', 'then', 'view', 'possibly', 'bit', 'insult', 'must', 'remember', 'Bat', 'III', 'was', 'recorded', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'concert', 'was', 'album', 'one', 'best', ""n't"", 'lost', 'anything', 'introductory', 'number', 'Revved', 'Up', 'very', 'short', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'actually', ""n't"", 'appear', 'why', 'just', 'intro', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'songs', 'are', 'shorter', 'originals', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'Full', 'versions', 'songs', 'mighty', 'programme', 'would', 'see', 'concert', 'go', 'hour', 'Nice', 'see', 'CC', 'show', 'Yes', 'Patti', 'Rousso', 'not', 'there', 'new', 'female', 'artists', 'do', 'more', 'adequate', 'job', 'are', 'exellent', 'singers', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'eye', 'are', 'not', 'Patti', 'Rousso', 'anyone', 'else', 'duet', 'Coming', 'Back', 'Me', 'Now', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'sung', 'incredible', 'feeling.My', 'two', 'favourite', 'songs', 'Bat', 'III', 'sound', 'terrific', 'Blind', 'A', 'Bat', 'Bad', 'Good.It', 'hard', 'compare', 'Melbourne', 'concert', 'orchestra', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'different', 'Having', 'orchestra', 'Melbourne', 'meant', 'different', 'arrangements', 'numbers', 'concert', 'arrangements', 'are', 'closer', 'album', 'versions.The', 'band', 'exellent', 'always', 'Being', 'modern', 'recording', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'superb', 'would', 'expect.The', '1.5', 'hour', 'documentary', 'second', 'DVD', 'superb', 'giving', 'look', 'build', 'up', 'recording', 'concert', 'Even', 'experience', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'still', 'nervous', 'stressed', 'out.I', 'rate', 'concert', 'highly', 'am', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'perform', 'numbes', 'Bat', 'III', 'Go', 'back', 'white', 'gum', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'yellow-green', 'material', 'display', 'here', ""n't"", 'look', 'quite', 'so', 'good']",N/A

Five stars for video, all the way.Although the audio is also five stars (great bass, crisp cymbols, everthing in between), it's the AUDIO MIX that takes all the bang out of this concert for me.

1093772,AI6GZ3K0QRQ0X,B000UA2SF0,Sidney L. Vaught,"[17, 20]","I have been a Meat Loaf fan for a very long time.  I too am a performer,  and I have even played Eddie and Dr. Scott in ""The Rocky Horror Show"" which Meat Loaf played in the original Roxie cast. I just want to make it clear I have a deep love and respect for this artist before I continue.This DVD is not Meat Loaf at his best, but his band and back up vocalists are totally awesome.  I had to overlook many aspects of Meat Loaf's performance on this DVD because he is mostly flat, has problems with tempo and he is obviously struggling with some of the higher notes.He is however; solid on lyrics.It about broke my heart to see Meat Loaf struggling through the repertoire.  It is very obvious his support band are helping him all they can.  All the band members are extremely young and have more energy to perform these songs.As an afterthought, I am not sure if Meat Loaf was having problems singing or he was having problems hearing.  I know a faulty monitoring system will throw off a performance.  Plus when I record, I only listen to the playback with one ear piece and not two.  Trying to listen to yourself over a system can direct you to sing flat.  It's good to have one ear open so you can hear yourself as you actually sound.  Meat Loaf on this DVD has two ear pieces.  He sometimes uses only one. He sounds better when he does this.  Meat Loaf does fiddle with an ear piece a bit which led me to believe he may have been having a technical difficulty.  I still feel external monitors are best...call me old fashioned.The ""Bat Out of Hell"" songs are extremely difficult to perform and listening to the albums is a much better way of enjoying these challenging songs.This DVD is good to keep as a perspective piece but not as a keepsake of great performances.  It almost should have been billed as ""Meat Loaf's Band and Meat Loaf"".
