184794,A141HP4LYPWMSR,1567301622,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 1]","Note: Farsi with English subtitles.Synopsis: While an old couple sit by the side of a stream washing a carpet (gabbeh), an attractive woman named Gabbeh (Shaghayeh Djodat) appears and begins to tell the story of her life. Before the tale comes to a conclusion you've learned not only about the young girl, but the meaning of life itself.Released in '97, 'Gabbeh' is one of the most non-linear, intoxicating films I've ever seen. The colors are so intense, the landscape so exotic and the customs so vibrate one fills as though they've moved beyond the mundane world and entered into a another world of mythic proportions. There is so much to digest from this film; insights into the life and culture of a nomadic society, the magnificent cinematography and the manner in which filmmaker Mohsen Makhamalbaf blends the mundane with the sacred, accepting the cycles of life and the beauty of creation itself.Be forewarned, this is one of those films that demands your full attention from beginning to end. Look away for a moment and you'll be completely lost. So make sure you're prepared to invest the time and effort before pushing the play button. This is probably not a film that you'll watch over and over again. But when your in the mood to be absorbed in color and texture this is what you'll reach for.",5,The Importance of Color In Weaving The Tapestry Of Life,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,1307,"['Note', 'Farsi', 'English', 'subtitles.Synopsis', 'old', 'couple', 'sit', 'side', 'stream', 'washing', 'carpet', 'gabbeh', 'attractive', 'woman', 'named', 'Gabbeh', 'Shaghayeh', 'Djodat', 'tell', 'story', 'life', 'tale', 'conclusion', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'not', 'only', 'young', 'girl', 'meaning', 'life', 'itself.Released', ""'97"", 'one', 'most', 'non-linear', 'intoxicating', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'landscape', 'so', 'exotic', 'customs', 'so', 'vibrate', 'one', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'mundane', 'world', 'entered', 'world', 'mythic', 'proportions', 'so', 'much', 'digest', 'film', 'insights', 'life', 'culture', 'nomadic', 'society', 'magnificent', 'cinematography', 'manner', 'filmmaker', 'Mohsen', 'Makhamalbaf', 'mundane', 'sacred', 'accepting', 'cycles', 'life', 'beauty', 'creation', 'itself.Be', 'forewarned', 'one', 'films', 'full', 'attention', 'beginning', 'end', 'Look', 'away', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'So', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'invest', 'time', 'effort', 'pushing', 'play', 'button', 'probably', 'not', 'film', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'mood', 'be', 'absorbed', 'color', 'texture', 'what', ""'ll"", 'reach']",N/A

I found it heavy-handed, obvious, and absurd.  I don't think they had much of a story, much of a budget, and -- worst of all -- many insights about the human condition.Perhaps part of the problem is that a lot of the movie's eloquence is predicated on the use of Farsi during certain scenes.I'm not sure I agree with that, but in any case that ain't gonna help you if you're reading the subtitles.I watched this twice -- carefully -- because of its reputation, but I am forced to conclude that the thing is pretentious and disorganized.  The filmmakers were certainly on to something that the public would be interested in watching:  the story of a forbidden love among a nomadic tribe.  Fine.But the film was confusing from beginning to end.  Even after two viewings, I'm still uncertain who the old woman and man were supposed to be?  Old versions of the young lady?  Was the young lady a phantom, a dream, or a memory?  An alternative life that could have been?I'm sure the filmmakers would be happy to suggest that ""She could be all of those things!  That's for the viewer to decide!""Bollocks.  You can't simply make a disorganized film and then grandly assert that whatever meaning people strive to see in it is as valid as anything you could have come up with.  It's a kind of cheating, as an artist.Leastways, the whole thing would have been much mroe successfuly without shoehorning all that bosh about color into it.

I say racist, because much of 'Gabbeh''s symbolic texture was obscure to me, and concentrating on aesthetics may seem to rob a film of its political force.  That it is political is shown by its being banned in Iran - Makhmalbaf's hiding behind 'allegory' cannot disguise his impassioned look at poverty, the oppressiveness of tradition, and the loneliness of women.  This is a film full of nature's marvel, that shows how 'nature' is too often used to justify social repression - as the teacher's lesson demonstrates, if the creation of the carpet (the gabbeh) is the equivalent of an act of nature, than those systems justified as natural (e.g. patriarchy, the family) are merely created.",5,- Gasp - !,987724800,"04 20, 2001",2001,768,"['racist', 'insist', 'most', 'beautiful', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'say', 'racist', 'much', ""'Gabbeh"", 'symbolic', 'texture', 'was', 'obscure', 'concentrating', 'aesthetics', 'may', 'seem', 'rob', 'film', 'political', 'force', 'political', 'shown', 'being', 'banned', 'Iran', 'Makhmalbaf', 'hiding', ""'allegory"", 'can', 'not', 'disguise', 'impassioned', 'look', 'poverty', 'oppressiveness', 'tradition', 'loneliness', 'women', 'film', 'full', 'nature', 'marvel', 'how', ""'nature"", 'too', 'often', 'used', 'justify', 'social', 'repression', 'teacher', 'lesson', 'creation', 'carpet', 'gabbeh', 'equivalent', 'act', 'nature', 'systems', 'justified', 'natural', 'e.g', 'patriarchy', 'family', 'are', 'merely', 'created']",N/A

184798,A1CDFQ1NBCS34X,1567301622,Jamie,"[0, 0]","The film Gabbeh is one that stands out to me. The story is interesting because it keeps the audience wondering who the characters are and where they are coming from. The story surrounds an elderly couple who has gone to wash their run in a stream. When a beautiful young girl appears and begins to help wash the rug, the film gets very interesting. The young girl proceeds to tell the couple about her life and her family. She is heartbroken because she is in love with a man that her father does not approve of. Because of other family obligations, her father will not let her be married. So the girl tells the man and woman about her heartaches. They try to console her and tell her that it will be all right. One of the reasons that this film is so good is the use of color throughout the film. From the clothes to the rug, the film is full of vibrant color. Color is used so much through out the film that is would be impossible to notice the intentionality of the use of color. In a time when the people of Iran were not supposed to wear vibrant colors, this film definitely stood out. One of my favorite scenes is when a teacher is explaining to his students about how plants grow. He reaches to the side and suddenly has flowers in his hand. He reaches to the sky and suddenly his hand is blue. This was not strictly for artistic purposes, though. The film is riddled with symbolism that the Iranian government probably was not too happy with. Overall, I think this film is quite interesting. Simply the use of color is enough to make this film worth watching. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys beautiful movies.",3,Gabbeh,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,1627,"['film', 'Gabbeh', 'one', 'out', 'story', 'interesting', 'audience', 'wondering', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'story', 'elderly', 'couple', 'who', 'gone', 'wash', 'run', 'stream', 'When', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'help', 'wash', 'rug', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'young', 'girl', 'proceeds', 'tell', 'couple', 'life', 'family', 'heartbroken', 'love', 'man', 'father', 'not', 'approve', 'other', 'family', 'obligations', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'be', 'married', 'girl', 'man', 'woman', 'heartaches', 'try', 'console', 'tell', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'One', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'use', 'color', 'film', 'clothes', 'rug', 'film', 'full', 'vibrant', 'color', 'Color', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'notice', 'intentionality', 'use', 'color', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'Iran', 'were', 'not', 'supposed', 'wear', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'film', 'definitely', 'stood', 'out', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'when', 'teacher', 'explaining', 'students', 'how', 'plants', 'grow', 'side', 'suddenly', 'flowers', 'hand', 'sky', 'suddenly', 'hand', 'blue', 'was', 'not', 'strictly', 'artistic', 'purposes', 'though', 'film', 'riddled', 'symbolism', 'Iranian', 'government', 'probably', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'Overall', 'think', 'film', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Simply', 'use', 'color', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'watching', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'beautiful', 'movies']",N/A

Carpenter ""Mettle""","[4, 16]","As a fan of foreign films from the Near East, I was quite surprised that I enjoyed GABBEH so little.GABBEH's downfall is its story.  The oral tradition of storytelling doesn't survive the translation to film intact.  The fable retains its simplicity, but unfortunately it's so simple a tale that it can't come close to fulfilling the time and plot requirements for a feature film.  So, instead of being pulled into an interesting story, the viewer has to entertain himself with exotic eye candy for unsuitably long stretches until the skimpy (often obscure) plot picks up again.Admittedly this is a visually beautiful film.  Djodat's characters exclaim &quot;life is color,&quot; and, in this film, that &quot;life&quot; is everywhere. The cinematography is breathtaking, with sunlit fields of green-yellow grain swirling in the wind and scores of bright handwoven rugs laying by a muddy river.  But, pretty pictures alone do not a great film make.  Pretty pictures of natives and their country only make a National Geographic special about the nomadic tribes of the wilds of Iran.Throw in the additional hurdle of reading subtitles and I would say it's safe to say that most audiences would hit fast-forward, if they didn't just go ahead and eject the tape.",1,"Colorful film, dull story",973468800,"11 6, 2000",2000,1258,"['fan', 'foreign', 'films', 'Near', 'East', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'enjoyed', 'GABBEH', 'little.GABBEH', 'downfall', 'story', 'oral', 'tradition', 'storytelling', ""n't"", 'survive', 'translation', 'film', 'intact', 'fable', 'simplicity', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'simple', 'tale', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'fulfilling', 'time', 'plot', 'requirements', 'feature', 'film', 'So', 'instead', 'being', 'pulled', 'interesting', 'story', 'viewer', 'entertain', 'exotic', 'eye', 'candy', 'unsuitably', 'long', 'stretches', 'skimpy', 'often', 'obscure', 'plot', 'up', 'again.Admittedly', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Djodat', 'characters', 'exclaim', 'quot', 'life', 'color', 'quot', 'film', 'quot', 'life', 'quot', 'everywhere', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'sunlit', 'fields', 'green-yellow', 'grain', 'swirling', 'wind', 'scores', 'bright', 'handwoven', 'rugs', 'laying', 'muddy', 'river', 'pretty', 'alone', 'do', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'make', 'Pretty', 'pictures', 'natives', 'country', 'only', 'make', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'nomadic', 'tribes', 'wilds', 'Iran.Throw', 'additional', 'hurdle', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'would', 'say', 'safe', 'say', 'most', 'audiences', 'would', 'hit', 'fast-forward', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'eject', 'tape']",N/A

Gabbeh is  another gem by the renowned Iranian film maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Gabbeh is a persian rug hand woven by women of Iranian tribes. The film tells the story of one such gabbeh(rug) and the story depicted in its colorful weaves about a woman, also named Gabbeh. The film tries to show her sufferings and how she fails to unite with her lover who has been following her for years and seasons.Gabbeh is a beautifully simple yet deceptively complex film and i would rather recommend more than one viewings to get in depth of the story and the characters. First viewing is bound to confuse the audience. Whether this girl ""Gabbeh"" really exists?? Or is it just a fantasy of the old man and woman washing the rug?? These are few of the questions that will be answered once you delve deeper in the breathtakingly beautiful world of Gabbeh!!Gabbeh is a must see for any film buff looking for meaningful and great cinema.

184801,A1Q6RZYVEA6MXP,1567301622,SBishop,"[0, 0]","Gabbeh is a stunning film. Prior to this film, I had never seen an Iranian film. After seeing this film I plan to watch as many films as I can by Makhmalbaf. The film does wonders as it parallels the lives of an elderly couple to a young couple. I think the most poignant element of the film is the art of rug making and the symbolism in rugs. The foreshadowing Makhmalbaf incorporates in the film really gives the film more meaning and worth in that when the film closes, the audience feels as though they've gone on a journey and have realized the true message of the film. The film was so very frustrating at times, I kept wanting the girl to run away from her family, from her clan and marry the mysterious guy. I knew that this couldn't be a reality due to the immeasurable protection the girl was put under and also due to the rules of their society. How strange it must be, though, to live in so strict a society/family. I found it really interesting that so intimate a film could be made in modern day Iran. The cinematography and the humor that is embedded throughout the film really make this film a gem to watch and to study. I could definitely see this film made into a children's book or a play. The representation of life and the importance of color to the people of Iran is magnificent. I don't know if this is the type of film to be watched again and again, but it is definitely a must-see film. There are elements that seem to interrupt the film (the playing with color and imagery, i.e. the scene in which the uncle plays with colors and the sea, sky, and fields), but I think these elements really help the film take shape with the message. This film is also a great example of how much can be done in film with so little a budget.
