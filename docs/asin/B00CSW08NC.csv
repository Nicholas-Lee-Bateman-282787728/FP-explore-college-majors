1650712,A2Z5450HXNEXZU,B00CSW08NC,BrendaMarie,"[0, 0]","Well, not for sure if this was fun because I live in Seattle and it was fun to connect with known scenery.  Or - if it was another disaster film, this time placed in Seattle.  There was a different spin but it didn't seem plausible as far as such quick outcomes.  It would be fun for the teens and preteens though, because young people make major contributions in survival.  It doesn't push the brain or stress much... so why not?  Enjoy while conversing and having fun with friends over popcorn.",3,Playing off Seattle,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,496,"['Well', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'fun', 'live', 'Seattle', 'was', 'fun', 'connect', 'known', 'scenery', 'was', 'disaster', 'film', 'time', 'placed', 'Seattle', 'was', 'different', 'spin', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'plausible', 'as', 'far', 'such', 'quick', 'outcomes', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'teens', 'preteens', 'young', 'people', 'make', 'major', 'contributions', 'survival', ""n't"", 'push', 'brain', 'stress', 'much', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'Enjoy', 'conversing', 'having', 'fun', 'friends', 'popcorn']",Seattle Superstorm

Well acted, even the creepy guy who was convinced he knew what was going on and knew better than anyone.  So sad when he died. yawn.

USSR, heavy water, virus, flood water. Oh and by the way sinister government involvement, everything but the kitchen sink.

1650716,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B00CSW08NC,G. Teslovich,"[2, 2]","1. Really bad science - not even up to middle school level. All of it and there was a lot just thrown in for no reason other than sound bites.2. Stilted, robotic acting. A lot of unemotional read a line; cut and edit; read another line, etc. No more than a line at a time; sounded like memorized moments before. Stupid dialogue only possible from script writers who have no clue about real life conversations at any level.3. Really bad visual effects/graphics; seemed more cartoonish than real. Especially the missile launched; falling debris; smoke columns; fake electrical storm; fake tornado.4. Produced out of B.C. and probably filmed there with a few, repeated over and over, boring cut scenes taken from a Seattle tourist promo.5. The usual fake few people running in a panic dropping groceries (cheap to drop) and locking as if they're really posing for the cameras. Usual fake debris flying about.6. Predictable ending with the stereotypical teen coming up with an idea to save the world and it works.7. In the credits it seemed as if every other person was an assistant to someone (brave of them to agree to have their names listed), even one called &#34;Best boy&#34;.
