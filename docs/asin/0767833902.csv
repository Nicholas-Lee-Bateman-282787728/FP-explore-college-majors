Uses same plot of demented chainsaw family terrorizing a hapless group (this time teens on prom night). More like a remake than a sequel,  unpleasent instead of scary, and a surprising lack of chainsaw action (once  or twice i think, i dare not watch again to find out). But all of that is  nothing compared to the ludicrous government conspiracy (which is the  closet thing to a merit that this film has). Forget fearing the original  this is the movie to be afraid of; avoid at ALL costs. What do you expect  for a flick that collected dust on the selves for 4 yrs. before seeing  video release? This version (original called The Return of the Texas  Chainsaw Massacre), unfortunately, restores about 10 min. of cut footage. A  travesty to the original, that surprising was written &amp; directed by Kim  Henkel co-writer &amp; producer of the 1st film!!

20080,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,0767833902,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","This film went down as one of the most hated entries in a film franchise of all time. Ranging from this site's poor 2.5 star average, to IMDB's 2.6 out of 10, to its 15% Fresh rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, this film has earned some truly appalling ratings... yet I like it for how bad it is. On the back of the box, it claims that this is a ""hilarious bone-chilling remake if the horror classic."" Yet the narration at the beginning of the film, clearly seems to note that this is a sequel because it mentions incidents from the previous three films. Somehow, the filmmakers, which included Kim Henkel; who helped create the original TCM film; decided that this should perhaps be a parody of sorts. This film, quite simply, is incomprehensible and completely ridiculous. From Leatherface being a transvestite, to Matthew McConaughey having a robotic leg and being a wife-beater in the film, this TCM flick makes no sense whatsoever.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a high school prom night goes awry for two couples, in an angry rage, one of the girlfriends decides to drive erratically and go to the woods where they get into an accident. Then the group decides to go and find help for the injured driver in the other vehicle and a tow truck, but they realize that are being pursued by a crazy family of cannibalistic serial killers. Now the group must survive, and find a way out.MUSIC: The music is a bit goofy, but overall it does fit the mood of a horror flick with some comedy elements. Overall, it fits the mood as it should.ACTING: This area is terrible, but in a funny way. The dialogue in this film is absurd and the actors are simply not convincing. One part of the film is where Renee Zellweger's character has been kidnapped, thrown in a trunk, and has a garbage bag covering her head and her kidnapper is going through a drive-thru: ""Quit kickin' around back here!"" ""Okay, but I can't breathe."" ""If I poke a hole in the bag, will you stop kickin' and screamin'?"" ""Yes."" When it comes to Renee Zellweger's acting, she can't seem to remember when she's supposed to be terrified. One moment she might be screaming or crying, but then the next moment she seems calm and acts like a dumb blonde. She simply cannot compete with the legendary performance of Marilyn Burns who was in the original TCM. As usual, Matthew McConaughey is a terrible actor and you really aren't scared of him as a serial killer, even with his stupid psycho-babble and constant yelling along with some wife-beating. I couldn't help but laugh at the fact Leatherface was a transvestite and he wasn't scary at all, especially at the parts when you see him intentionally avoid trying to hit Renee Zellweger. You especially aren't scared of him when Zellweger's character starts walking out of the house, Leatherface; decked out in full female clothing; starts screaming and she shouts, ""You sit the f*** down! And shut up!"" And he does. Simply put, these actors are really bad, but they are hilariously bad.ACTION: This film isn't particularly violent, it's just really stupid. Unlike the original, this film has nothing disturbing or horrifying. This is mostly a film you laugh at the entire way through thanks to the cheesy action and violence. There are no scares, it's just a really dumb horror film. But that's why I enjoyed it for the most part.OVERALL: Extreme cautionary rental. I pointed out the terrible reviews this film received earlier, so that's why it receives a rental. If you can laugh at films for how bad they are and enjoy them for that, you might like this film. If you're an absolute die-hard fan of the TCM series, you're going to hate it.THE GOOD: It's so bad it's hilarious.THE BAD: It's so bad it's hilarious.",3,"IS THIS A REMAKE, A PARODY, OR A SEQUEL? 7 OUT OF 10",1250208000,"08 14, 2009",2009,3714,"['film', 'went', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'hated', 'entries', 'film', 'franchise', 'time', 'Ranging', 'site', 'poor', '2.5', 'star', 'average', 'IMDB', '2.6', '10', '15', '%', 'Fresh', 'rating', 'critics', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'film', 'earned', 'truly', 'appalling', 'ratings', 'yet', 'like', 'how', 'bad', 'back', 'box', 'hilarious', 'bone-chilling', 'remake', 'horror', 'classic', 'narration', 'beginning', 'film', 'clearly', 'note', 'sequel', 'incidents', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'Somehow', 'filmmakers', 'included', 'Kim', 'Henkel', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'original', 'TCM', 'film', 'decided', 'should', 'perhaps', 'be', 'parody', 'sorts', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'incomprehensible', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'Leatherface', 'being', 'transvestite', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'having', 'robotic', 'leg', 'being', 'wife-beater', 'film', 'TCM', 'flick', 'sense', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'night', 'awry', 'two', 'couples', 'angry', 'rage', 'one', 'girlfriends', 'drive', 'erratically', 'go', 'woods', 'where', 'get', 'accident', 'Then', 'group', 'go', 'find', 'help', 'injured', 'driver', 'other', 'vehicle', 'tow', 'truck', 'realize', 'are', 'being', 'pursued', 'crazy', 'family', 'cannibalistic', 'serial', 'killers', 'Now', 'group', 'must', 'survive', 'find', 'way', 'out.MUSIC', 'music', 'bit', 'goofy', 'overall', 'fit', 'mood', 'horror', 'flick', 'comedy', 'elements', 'Overall', 'mood', 'area', 'terrible', 'funny', 'way', 'dialogue', 'film', 'absurd', 'actors', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'convincing', 'One', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'character', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'thrown', 'trunk', 'garbage', 'bag', 'covering', 'head', 'kidnapper', 'going', 'drive-thru', 'Quit', 'kickin', 'around', 'back', 'here', 'Okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'poke', 'hole', 'bag', 'will', 'stop', 'kickin', 'screamin', 'Yes', 'When', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'acting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'terrified', 'One', 'moment', 'might', 'be', 'screaming', 'crying', 'then', 'next', 'moment', 'calm', 'acts', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'legendary', 'performance', 'Marilyn', 'Burns', 'who', 'was', 'original', 'TCM', 'usual', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'terrible', 'actor', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'scared', 'serial', 'killer', 'even', 'stupid', 'psycho-babble', 'constant', 'yelling', 'wife-beating', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'fact', 'Leatherface', 'was', 'transvestite', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'especially', 'parts', 'when', 'see', 'intentionally', 'avoid', 'trying', 'hit', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'especially', 'are', ""n't"", 'scared', 'when', 'Zellweger', 'character', 'walking', 'house', 'Leatherface', 'decked', 'out', 'full', 'female', 'clothing', 'screaming', 'sit', 'f***', 'down', 'shut', 'up', 'Simply', 'put', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'are', 'hilariously', 'bad.ACTION', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'violent', 'just', 'really', 'stupid', 'original', 'film', 'nothing', 'disturbing', 'horrifying', 'mostly', 'film', 'laugh', 'entire', 'way', 'thanks', 'cheesy', 'action', 'violence', 'are', 'scares', 'just', 'really', 'dumb', 'horror', 'film', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part.OVERALL', 'Extreme', 'cautionary', 'rental', 'pointed', 'out', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'film', 'received', 'earlier', 'why', 'rental', 'can', 'laugh', 'films', 'how', 'bad', 'are', 'enjoy', 'might', 'like', 'film', ""'re"", 'absolute', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'TCM', 'series', ""'re"", 'going', 'hate', 'it.THE', 'GOOD', 'so', 'bad', 'hilarious.THE', 'BAD', 'so', 'bad', 'hilarious']",N/A
20081,AGSMIZ6BT53YF,0767833902,"Adrian Paul Neary ""gorehound and splatter punk""","[4, 7]","This is no more a Sequel than Part3.  For some inexplicable reason, people who want to make a TCM film always want to remake the original.  That really can't be done.  I suppose technically speaking it could...but it wont have what the original did.  Back when the original came out, Horror films weren't really about people killing people.  It was always monsters of some sort. The first TCM was so shocking because, without reason...a maniac just started to attack these kids.  In 74 this was an unthinkable atrocity.  Skip ahead a decade or two, after the world has been saturated with Jasons, Freddys, and Michael Meyers, and the first TCM is pretty tame.  I think this may have been the reason certain people thought they might need to remake it...to freshen it up a bit for the new audience.  Dismal failures abound.Now, as a sequel...this thing of a movie makes no sense.  No continuity with ANY of the first three.  Not that part3 had any with the first two.  Suddenly, there are women in the family...two more brothers who are very different than the originals...And Leatherface is....well...a bit different, but not at all improved.  I think the Leatherfaces of Prt3 and the 2003 remake are improvements on the original, but only because they are slightly more menacing.  Good old Gunnar is still awesome though.  This one is a fat slob, a fat slob with a shrill voice too.  Leatherface went from being menacing and evil to fat and annoying.What happened to the body art?  What happened to the Cannibalism?(Although they never really come out and say they're cannibals until part 3.  Grandpa is just on a liquid diet, but you never see any of the Brothers eat people meat.) And why in heavens name did they go from being dangerouse back water hill billies to Quote spilling...Socialogical ranting...cross dressing buffoons?Now the ending...Maybe I'm just a moron, but I don't get it.  What does this ""shadow"" group have to do with anything?  They supposedly hired this family to cause terror or something.  To what end?  And why out in the middle of Texas?  I get the distinct impression that I missed something, or something vital was cut out.Thank goodness Tobe made the original with Kim's help and not visa versa..otherwise the Slasher genre may have never really taken off the way it did.Although I have to say...Aside from Poltergiest, the original TCM was probably the only good movie Tobe has made.

20082,AZSN1TO0JI87B,0767833902,A. Estes,"[22, 27]","""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" (or ""The Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as it is also known) sits in my DVD collection, along with the other ""T.C.M."" movies, for one simple reason: It is easily the most vexing and confusing horror movie in the entire history of cinema. Think about it. Co-scribe of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" Kim Henkel, sat behind the director's chair and made the complete opposite of what fans want from these movies. It makes no sense. Is this some sort of afterbirth from the original movie? Or is it just a very twisted and comedic remake? No one knows. I don't know. You don't know. I pray everyday that they will release a DVD edition of this movie with commentary from Henkel himself, just so we can all know what this movie was supposed to be. Because we know it isn't scary. You can't watch this movie and be scared, it just doesn't work. And it's only funny in the ""so bad it's good"" vein. There is not one single moment where you fear for a character's life, and when we are supposed to care, the people in peril don't care -- one character, being pursued by a member of Leatherface's clan stops to catch his breath and says something to the effect of ""Please stop, you're scaring me."" And don't even get me started on the portrayal of Leatherface himself in this one. The story revolves around a group of good looking teens who get lost in the woods on prom night. Eventually, as it always goes, they end up in Leatherface's house, which is again, full of a brand new family of half-wits and psychotics, lead by Matthew McConaughey (you heard me), who is one of the few saving graces of this film, as he piles on the cheese to his character. Renee Zellweger (yes, again, you heard me) plays the typical role, the innocent teen who inexplicably survives as her friends get slaughtered. Zellweger hits all the right notes, as the frumpy, yet attractive, frightened teenage girl. However, nothing else in this movie works. There is little to no gore to speak of, and just when you think things can't get worse, a limousine arrives and...well...I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. You just have to see this trainwreck for yourself. It's so horrible that you just can't look away. It's too bad the ""franchise"" had to end with this entry, and it's so baffling that someone who created the original story couldn't have done any better. Watch it only out of morbid curiousity.

While it wouldn't be released in theaters for another three years due to the mindful hesitation from the film's distributor, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION was born. Touted to be a remake of the original by TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE co-writer Kim Henkel, THE NEXT GENERATION follows all of the same action beats, but misses the point entirely. It isn't that people just don't 'get' TEXAS CHAINSAW 4, which is typically the case with the second film. It just really is as bad as everyone says. The so-called dark humor is completely lost on the audience. If there is anything worse than the unintelligible script, it is the atrocious acting. No one in the entire cast gives a s*** about what they are doing. It often feels as if they were drugged and forced to act against their will, although the teens' ambivalence towards the horror that is unfolding around them earns the only guilty laugh. The hope would be that Henkel would make up for his artless production by splattering the screen with some gratuitous gore, but THE NEXT GENERATION is even more bloodless than the third film.

I ran to Blockbuster Video, rented a copy of the movie, ran back home, and watched it then and there. I cannot believe how disappointed I was in the results of this film.A group of teenagers, HEATHER (played by Lisa Marie Newmyer), her boyfriend, SEAN (played by John Harrison), and their geeky friend, JENNY (played by Renee Zellweger) decide to leave their prom a little early and end up getting into a car accident. They end up at an insurance office in the middle of nowhere, and meet up with a seemingly normal woman named, DARLA SAWYER (played by the sexy Tonie Perensky), who offers to have her husband tow their car. Unfortunately for the teens, this woman is married to a psychopath named VILMER SAWYER (played by Matthew McConaughey) whose brother is the cannabalisic serial killer, LEATHERFACE (played by Robert Jacks). The teens are taken to a secluded, old farmhouse where the previously cannibalistic family of the earlier films live.As I said before, this film was a major disappointment to me, as well as other TCM fans. After watching this film, you all might want to run out to buy the 2003 remake of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, as well as its 2006 prequel, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING.It should be noted that this film is often labeled as either a remake or semi-remake of the original 1974 film.

20107,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,0767833902,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 1]","""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" is the second of THREE reboots in the entire franchise: the first one being ""Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3"" with isn't a sequel to anything, and the latest one being the straight-up periodic remake with Jessica Biel's incongruous low-rise jeans.  Jeez, that's one more than ""The Punisher"" movies (although a thousand less than ""A Christmas Carol"").  Technically, this is more of a semi-remake as it acknowledged events from the 1970s, but it heavily borrows elements from the first movie that it's almost the same film.Since this is a carbon-copy of the first movie, there's no point in talking about the story.  Seriously, the comparisons are uncanny: the four teenagers were off on the woods; they found a wounded nameless victim along the way; they went into a farmhouse, where they'll be attacked by Leatherface; a character got locked into a storage bin and later got hanged by a meat hook; the only survivor was forcefully invited to a family dinner of psychos, and a couple of corpses were sitting on the table; the psycho family proceed to tongue-torture the victim; the survivor escaped from the house, and Leatherface was chasing her in broad daylight; the survivor hiked a large vehicle while Leatherface is scratching the vehicle with his weapon; and the film ends with Leatherface doing a chainsaw pirouette.  Actually, this movie ended with showing a mysterious old lady, which didn't explain anything, so the conclusion didn't serve any purpose.  The only differences between this and the Tobe Hooper classic is that it takes place in the '90s and it has new characters: the good guys representsBridget Jones, a prom couple and a pothead, and the Leatherface family consists of a redneck who speaks in famous quotes, a woman who once took off her top, and Matthey McConaughey with a crippled leg (and proving how little his acting evolved ever since).It's an unimpressive recreation, with the actors who look like they took Xanax and the horror elements lacking the grit and shock to make the film intense.  ""The Next Generation"" does make itself intriguing by being progressively weird; not as weird as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"", but it has its share of oddities.  The major player of bizarre is Leatherhead finding his feminine side and wore women's clothing for the feast; I have to admit he scared the crap out of me, him being in drag and flashing a low-cut booby cleavage, the latter likely 'borrowed' from one of his corpses.  In another truly bizarre moment, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's character asserted herself in front of psychos and yelled at Leatherface to sit down and shut up (which he did); a lowly victim told a chainsaw-wielding maniac to stay put, such hubris. Some scenes aren't just weird, some are just lazy: one chase scene had a small aircraft from out of nowhere and sliced a bad guy's face with a propeller before flying away; it's like the director had no idea how to get the victim out of danger, so he pulled a flying Deus ex Machina.Those oddball scenes alone are worth viewing for curious seekers, but as a whole, ""The Next Generation"" is boring tripe.

What really scares me is some of the people who are giving this four or five stars and trying to make this into an artsy, high-minded movie.  ""Parody""?!!  Parodies are supposed to be genuinely comedic, not merely cliche-ridden.  And sure there was a conspiracy thing thrown in near the end in order to make it seem more intelligent than it was, but it was still poorly executed.  The ""boss man"" chiding the family for not inspiring horror into people and his spheel about ""spiritual matters"" near the end came off as ridiculous attempts at high-minded commentary with no depth whatsoever into them whatsoever.  I notice the people who try to ""rationalize"" only end up making up things in order to fill out gross inconsistencies to cover up that this was just a bad movie.  The pussification of Leatherface is truly saddening.  He only picks up and chases people with a chainsaw twice, the rest of the time whining like a little girl.  I agree with some of the other reviewers here that there was no suspenseful buildup to the entrance of the villains whatsoever.  When Leatherface in this one just walks to the girl and she reacts by trying to run away with him grabbing her, I felt like if I were in that situation, I would have just push-kicked ol' Leatherface.  In the original, you felt that senes of dread when the kids found their old abandoned house and the one guy when to the house next door, went through the door, walking down the hallway, and then stumbeled to the doorway just as Leatherface stepped from the side, and the camera angle panned up just as Leatherface brought down his hammer on the poor guy's head.  Now that was terror.  Here, there is made no attempt to build up that suspense.  Probably because of the ... acting.  This film lacks the cinematography and picture quality that made the original work so well.  The only good thing about this one was the performances of Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger.  Matthew was great as the head psycho and Renee exited me as the nerdy girl who finally summoned up the courage to stand up to the family, debase them, insult them, and threaten them just before the ""big boss"" came and she began to tremble down again upon realizing that the conspiracy that the lady talked about might have been true after all.

Mathew M played a great villian, I would have truly believed he was insane and was doing this for kicks had the illuminati not stepped in (not that they added anything at all to the movie except a rather convenient means of escape for renee zellweger, only to have the police not believe her and sees a patient at the hospital that noone will recognize) and his robotic leg was probably the funniest part of the movie. Renee Zellweger played her part well, honestly between her and mathew i thought the film was going to grade a bad, but she especially added to the whole feel of the film. Her highlight was telling the cross dressing leatherface to sit down and he obeyed without question. This film works as a sequel if you think of it as the next generation, maybe some sadistic offspring of leatherface and the rest of the sawyer clan continuing the family buisness. This does not work as a remake because for one its actually resembles the third film much more than the original and it didnt have the door. That was what made the original so scary was the door he throws open, reves up the chainsaw and starts slicing his victims up before pulling them into his lair. I say this film deserves to be atleast watched, but if your a collector or completionist like me, buy a cheap copy and dont expect a movie to come with.",3,"Leatherface, just shut up...,",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1843,"['was', 'debating', '2', '3', 'stars', 'when', 'rating', 'product', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'bad', 'horror', 'comedy', 'texas', 'chainsaw', 'massacre', 'film', 'prove', 'worthy', 'having', 'name', 'saw', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Leatherface', 'crossdressing', 'was', 'line', 'dont', 'forget', 'did', 'do', 'begginning', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'constant', 'whining', 'screeching', 'only', 'got', 'worse', 'when', 'dawned', 'dress', 'disgusting', 'boobs', 'even', 'chainsaw', 'couldnt', 'drown', 'out', 'earpeircing', 'squeals', 'Mathew', 'M', 'played', 'great', 'villian', 'would', 'have', 'truly', 'believed', 'was', 'insane', 'was', 'doing', 'kicks', 'had', 'illuminati', 'not', 'stepped', 'not', 'added', 'anything', 'movie', 'rather', 'convenient', 'means', 'escape', 'renee', 'zellweger', 'only', 'have', 'police', 'not', 'believe', 'patient', 'hospital', 'noone', 'will', 'recognize', 'robotic', 'leg', 'was', 'probably', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'played', 'part', 'well', 'honestly', 'mathew', 'i', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'grade', 'bad', 'especially', 'added', 'whole', 'feel', 'film', 'highlight', 'was', 'telling', 'cross', 'dressing', 'leatherface', 'sit', 'down', 'obeyed', 'question', 'film', 'sequel', 'think', 'next', 'generation', 'maybe', 'sadistic', 'offspring', 'leatherface', 'rest', 'sawyer', 'clan', 'continuing', 'family', 'buisness', 'not', 'work', 'remake', 'one', 'actually', 'third', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'original', 'have', 'door', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'original', 'so', 'scary', 'was', 'door', 'open', 'up', 'chainsaw', 'slicing', 'victims', 'up', 'pulling', 'lair', 'say', 'film', 'be', 'atleast', 'watched', 'collector', 'completionist', 'buy', 'cheap', 'copy', 'dont', 'expect', 'movie', 'come']",N/A

20135,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,0767833902,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[7, 11]","This is one of the all-time worst horror movies I've had the misfortune to rent and the stupidity to sit through.  And that is saying A LOT. I have seen over 500 horror films, and this is probably one of the three worst.I saw TCM 1, 2, and 3. It would be insulting to even begin to compare the original with this, so I'm not gonna try (though the main survivor in the first film has an unbilled cameo in this). TCM 2 was great. TCM 3 was lame but this...this...thing made it look like Re-Animator in comparison! The &quot;plot&quot; involves 2 couples on prom night who run into Leatherface and his family. That's about it.Why was it so bad?  Well, let's see. Here's the main ones I can list:1.  Leatherface and other villains simply wander casually into camera range to make their entrance with no pretense at any kind of suspense or buildup.2. Extraordinarily bad acting, even for a B-horror flick, even from Renee Zellweger and McConaughey.3. They must have spent their entire FX budget on a shot of a rotting corpse in a bathtub, because there is NO gore at all, not even blood, even when someone gets hit in the head with an axe. There's a scene where a bad guy runs over some kid--after he's been chasing him in his tow truck, and the dumb kid just runs ahead of him the whole time, like in a road-runner cartoon, when he could have easily gone into the woods and escaped--and all you see is a shot of Bad Guy sitting in the cab of the truck, backing over him and going &quot;yeee-HAW!&quot; about 20 times. No body, no nothing. Not even a sound when he runs over him.4. All the victims are unusually stupid, even for a horror movie. Yeah, I know they're supposed to do stupid stuff and end up getting killed, but this went so far I wanted to slap the screenwriter (if there was one--most of it seems improvised). Characters on the run from killers hide in houses to escape and DO NOT EVEN CLOSE THE FRIKKIN' DOOR. NO matter how freaked out you would be, even forms of plant life would be smart enough to know enough to do that. There's the obligatory TCM scene where the victim is forced to sit at the dinner table with the rest of the cannibalistic family while they torment her, but in this case she is not tied to the chair--all she had to do was get up and stroll out. It gets to the point where even a viewer with a speed-limit IQ would have their intelligence insulted by this.5.  Leatherface has been turned into a whining, wimpy cross-dresser who is scared of everyone else in his family.  I don't think I need to explain why this is a flaw to anyone who has seen the original. Actually, I probably don't need to explain it to anyone, period. 'Nuff said.Those are just the reasons I can think of off the top of my head. In fact, I'm getting all worked up again over how amazingly idiotic and insulting this movie was when I'm just writing about it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Yes, I know it is a B-movie. Yes, I know it was probably intended to be funny as well as scary. Yes, I know some of it may have been intended as parody, though that is probably giving everyone involved too much credit. No, I did not expect it to be as good as the original, or the sequels. However, none of the above matters when the movie is so completely wretched that it has no entertainment value whatsoever.My recommendation- Do not pay to rent this movie.  Go take the money you were going to spend on the rental fee, put it in a small pile, and set fire to it. It will be better use of your money and more entertaining.  Do not even sit through this movie if someone pays YOU to watch it. And this isn't one of those 'so bad it's good' movies that are fun to laugh at, either. If you've seen more than 10 horror movies, I'm sure you know the difference.  Don't rent it just to see how bad it is--if you do, you'll hate yourself after sitting through 3 minutes of it.

It didn't succeed. It was made on a micro-budget ($600,000). Matt & Renee blocked a wide release (probably a wise decision on all accounts). McConaughey's acting wasn't bad (he plays the crazy very well) but Zellweger was forgettable. Overall, it is pretty silly, minimalistic and nonsensical. It could be a cult collector's item one day with the casting of two young stars. Amazon reviewers give it a lowly 2.5 stars.Columbia Pictures originally released the film as The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a small number of cinemas in 1994. That version was later pulled from theatres, and the film was re-released in 1997 under the title Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. The original, unedited cut of the film features a few differences, including: a subplot that involves Jenny's stepfather abusing her in the opening scene, more dialogue between Heather and Barry in the car, and a longer conversation between Jenny and Darla in the bath-room. The original cut also featured different musical effects, a handful of different transitional shots, as well as a few scenes feature different tinted colors. The Canadian DVD release of the film through Lions Gate Entertainment remains the only known home-video release as of 2009 that includes all of the cut footage from the original version of the movie.

20140,A2T0NNNZHWTOFJ,0767833902,Marcus,"[7, 9]","There are movies that are so bad they're good, part 2 was like that. This movie is more like part 3 though, so bad that it surpasses good and finds its way back to bad again. It starts out like a paint by numbers horror film then tuns into a pathetic homage to the original that has no continuity with the series. I'd say they were trying to forget part's 2 and 3 ever happened, but they're acknowledged in the opening sequence, so forget that idea. We know Renee Zellweger is capable of better than this, but a bad director can't even get much out of the most talented actors. When she says things like ""There's a guy out there with a chainsaw"" or ""Don't hurt her."" She says it with about as much passion as one might say, ""pass the remote."" Then there's Matthew McConaughey's character which seems to be a return of the hitchhiker, I don't know for sure if that's their intention or how they can do that but whatever. He's just this annoying guy who'd you'd wish would just shut up. Of course, what would a TCM movie be without leatherface, who's now a gender bending transvestite. An idea that hit the cutting room floor of the original that's back in full force of this one. Too bad his chainsaw never incised into any human flesh, can you really call it a chainsaw massacre when blade and flesh don't meet? What's even worse yet is that they don't even appear to be cannibals anymore. All you see them eat is pizza, vegetarian pizza even, that's just so wrong. The ending is totally derivative of the original, but can someone tell me how someone can get run over by an airplane in the middle of nowhere? I hope the next generation is the last generation if this is what the future holds.

Hitchiker in pt.1 & Chop top in pt.2), & who also posses a bizzare (usually metal) body part & uses a truck to terrorize people (like other Sawyers Alfredo/Gas station owner in pt.3, Chop top & Tinker/Hook in 3).

The story soon focuses on Jenny (Renee Zellweger), who I guess is the smartest of the troubled teens, as she is tormented and tortured by the psychotic Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey, who sports an electronic leg brace here), his masochist girlfriend, dim-witted W.E., and the legendary Leatherface, who is all dolled-up for this one. Much of it plays the same old ""stumbled into a house of crazies"" game that has lost some of its scare power over the years (onscreen at least), and losing the cannibal aspect doesn't help, but a new conspiracy twist adds a certain something that, in my opinion, makes it far more interesting than the boring remake. Though, I'm sure it's part of the reason this particular sequel is so despised by TCM fans.The first thing one notices about this film is that it stars Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, and if you're fans of theirs, that's definitely reason enough to check this out. Made in 1994, this is one of their earlier films (it's also known as ""Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). In general, the acting isn't that impressive (some is pretty awful). I'm not a McConaughey fan, but I do have to give him credit. He gives this role his all, unless he's just playing himself... Zellweger has good and bad moments, but she clearly stands out among the group of kids who get lost in the woods with her. In fact, you're practically cheering for the other three to get killed, which is one of the problems with this flick. Like with a lot of horror films now, it's hard to really get scared when you don't feel for the victims. They're either unlikable and you start rooting for the villain, or they're too good looking or recognizable, so you can't forget you're watching a movie. In addition, there's the lack of the cannibal thing, Leatherface is a sissy in this one, the whole thing is just a tad campy when compared to the gritty realism of the original (which I do love and is actually scary). And there's this weird twist I mentioned before too. So, yeah, there are lots of reasons to not like this one, but one could find it enjoyable for those reasons too. For example, I find the bizarre conspiracy situation interesting and at least different from the other films of this kind. And like, say, ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" (yeah, I know that one is better), this disturbed little flick is a fun ride of a horror film. Okay, it's not scary, but it's decent entertainment. I mean, if you think this is one of the worst horror films out there, you haven't seen much, and I personally get more enjoyment out of it than I do from the remake. I did like the prequel to the remake though.The DVD is apparently a slightly edited down version. It reads as 87 minutes on the box, while the uncut version is supposed to be 95 minutes. The disc is double sided, widescreen on one, fullscreen on the other, and the only extras are some text bios and horror trailers that include the trailer for this film. If you love a wide variety of horror, including slightly over the top stuff purely for the thrill ride, this is worthwhile if you can find it really cheap, like I did. It's not disturbing or all that scary, but it would probably be a fun movie to pop in with a group on Halloween or something!",4,"Hey, c'mon, this was more interesting than the remake!",987379200,"04 16, 2001",2001,3483,"['When', 'two', 'couples', 'leave', 'prom', 'early', 'get', 'lost', 'woods', 'then', 'car', 'accident', 'soon', 'find', 'mixed', 'up', 'deadly', 'Sawyer', 'family', 'still', 'crazy', 'years', 'seem', 'prefer', 'pizza', 'human', 'flesh', 'now', 'story', 'soon', 'Jenny', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'guess', 'smartest', 'troubled', 'teens', 'tormented', 'tortured', 'psychotic', 'Vilmer', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'sports', 'electronic', 'leg', 'brace', 'here', 'masochist', 'girlfriend', 'dim-witted', 'W.E.', 'legendary', 'Leatherface', 'who', 'dolled-up', 'one', 'Much', 'same', 'old', 'stumbled', 'house', 'crazies', 'game', 'lost', 'scare', 'power', 'years', 'onscreen', 'least', 'losing', 'cannibal', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'help', 'new', 'conspiracy', 'twist', 'certain', 'something', 'opinion', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'boring', 'remake', ""'m"", 'sure', 'part', 'reason', 'particular', 'sequel', 'so', 'despised', 'TCM', 'fans.The', 'first', 'thing', 'one', 'film', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', ""'re"", 'fans', 'theirs', 'definitely', 'reason', 'enough', 'check', 'out', 'Made', '1994', 'one', 'earlier', 'films', 'also', 'known', 'Return', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'general', 'acting', ""n't"", 'that', 'impressive', 'pretty', 'awful', ""'m"", 'not', 'McConaughey', 'fan', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'role', 'just', 'playing', 'Zellweger', 'good', 'bad', 'moments', 'clearly', 'out', 'group', 'kids', 'who', 'get', 'lost', 'woods', 'fact', ""'re"", 'practically', 'cheering', 'other', 'three', 'get', 'killed', 'one', 'problems', 'flick', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'now', 'hard', 'really', 'get', 'scared', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'victims', ""'re"", 'unlikable', 'start', 'rooting', 'villain', ""'re"", 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'recognizable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'addition', 'lack', 'cannibal', 'thing', 'Leatherface', 'sissy', 'one', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'tad', 'campy', 'when', 'compared', 'gritty', 'realism', 'original', 'do', 'love', 'actually', 'scary', 'weird', 'twist', 'mentioned', 'too', 'So', 'yeah', 'are', 'lots', 'reasons', 'not', 'one', 'one', 'could', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'reasons', 'too', 'example', 'find', 'bizarre', 'conspiracy', 'situation', 'interesting', 'least', 'different', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'say', 'House', '1,000', 'Corpses', 'yeah', 'know', 'one', 'better', 'disturbed', 'little', 'flick', 'fun', 'ride', 'horror', 'film', 'Okay', 'not', 'scary', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'mean', 'think', 'one', 'worst', 'horror', 'films', 'there', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'personally', 'get', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'do', 'remake', 'did', 'prequel', 'remake', 'though.The', 'DVD', 'apparently', 'slightly', 'edited', 'down', 'version', '87', 'minutes', 'box', 'uncut', 'version', 'supposed', 'be', '95', 'minutes', 'disc', 'double', 'sided', 'widescreen', 'one', 'fullscreen', 'other', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'text', 'bios', 'horror', 'trailers', 'include', 'trailer', 'film', 'love', 'wide', 'variety', 'horror', 'including', 'slightly', 'top', 'stuff', 'purely', 'thrill', 'ride', 'worthwhile', 'can', 'find', 'really', 'cheap', 'did', 'not', 'disturbing', 'scary', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'fun', 'movie', 'pop', 'group', 'Halloween', 'something']",N/A

Marketed as a comedy and spoof of horror films it's neither funny or clever. Or scary for that matter. What is frightening is how bad the acting is by anyone not named Matt or Renee. Leatherface is a fat drag queen who spends the entire film either crying in the corner or reapplying his lipstick. Two high school couples (one of which includes Zellweger) ditch their prom and get into a car accident. Stranded in the middle of the woods without a flashlight they go off in search of a phone. The joke is that Zellweger is the ""ugly"" girl yet her friend sticks up for her by telling her obnoxious boyfriend that she's tougher than she looks. With that kind of praise you know Renee is going to  spend the rest of the movie running for her life. Run she does, barefoot even, but for what reason? The killers are a sorry bunch that includes a somewhat attractive real estate agent, an idiot with a taser who likes to quote Machiavelli and Grant for no reason, and a tow truck driver with a mechanical leg (McConaughey).

20161,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0767833902,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (Kim Henkel, 1994)Everything about Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation points to it not only being a huge underground success, but achieving some mainstream notoriety as well, just as its grandpappy did twenty years previous. The original writer comes back to helm the flick in his directorial debut, and the casting folks manage to land a few stars who look like they're on their way up. And my, did they strike a goldmine: two of the movie's stars are Renee Zellweger (Chicago, Bridget Jones' Diary) and Matthew McConaughey (Reign of Fire, Amistad). I mean, this has every necessary Hallmark of underground reverence.It has gotten exactly the opposite. Listed near the bottom of IMDB's bottom 100 and universally reviled by the reviews posted there. Why everyone's hatin' on Leatherface is beyond me. My best guess is that a whole bunch of people who had never heard of any of the films, but were Renee Zellweger fans, rented it as a kind of completist thing. Because really, it's not that bad. I've seen at least five films that make this look like Doctor Zhivago in the past year alone (and one of them was nominated for a few Oscars).If you've seen, or heard about, any of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre flicks, you know what to expect. The main differences is the bevy of teenagers are out on prom night; the brainless jock-type Barry (Tyler Cone [The War at Home]) and his equally annoying girlfriend Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer [The House on Todville Road]), and the geek, Sean (John Harrison [The Substitute Wife]), with the plucky heroine (Zellweger). Following an accident with another teen (listed in the credits, amusingly, as ""I'm Not Hurt""), various members of the bunch, trying to find help, meet up with various townsfolk at various times, and realize there's something very odd going on...There was great potential here (unlike the other films, Leatherface's house this time is located close to a decent-sized commercial area) to have some real fun with the concept, but instead Henkel and company went with the same straight horror-comedy mix that the whole series works with. (Only the recent remake of the original takes itself at all seriously, which is not necessarily a bad thing.) The comedy is as mean-spirited and ugly as it is in the first film, which some people are going to hate and some will take as a welcome return to form (one figures Henkel was probably responsible for most of the original film's gallows humor). As usual, there's a lot going on that makes no real sense within the story (McConaughey's Rube Goldberg-esque prosthetic leg, the insane CIA agent played by a chilling John Gale, etc.), but again, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Some of the acting really sucks, but you expect that from a B-grade horror flick. But it succeeds at what it attempts, in a gruesome, low-budget sort of way, and doesn't deserve anywhere near the amount of revilement it has received.Don't expect greatness, but you'll chuckle a few times. **",2,Not nearly as bad as I was led to believe.,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,3025,"['Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Kim', 'Henkel', '1994', 'Everything', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Next', 'Generation', 'points', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'huge', 'underground', 'success', 'achieving', 'mainstream', 'notoriety', 'well', 'just', 'grandpappy', 'did', 'twenty', 'years', 'previous', 'original', 'writer', 'back', 'helm', 'flick', 'directorial', 'debut', 'casting', 'folks', 'manage', 'land', 'few', 'stars', 'who', 'look', ""'re"", 'way', 'did', 'strike', 'goldmine', 'two', 'movie', 'stars', 'are', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Chicago', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'Amistad', 'mean', 'necessary', 'Hallmark', 'underground', 'reverence.It', 'gotten', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'Listed', 'bottom', 'IMDB', 'bottom', '100', 'universally', 'reviled', 'reviews', 'posted', 'there', 'Why', 'everyone', 'hatin', 'Leatherface', 'best', 'guess', 'whole', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'films', 'were', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'fans', 'rented', 'kind', 'completist', 'thing', 'really', 'not', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'five', 'films', 'make', 'look', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'past', 'year', 'alone', 'one', 'was', 'nominated', 'few', 'Oscars', '.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'flicks', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'main', 'differences', 'bevy', 'teenagers', 'are', 'out', 'prom', 'night', 'brainless', 'jock-type', 'Barry', 'Tyler', 'Cone', '[', 'War', 'Home', ']', 'equally', 'annoying', 'girlfriend', 'Heather', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'Newmyer', '[', 'House', 'Todville', 'Road', ']', 'geek', 'Sean', 'John', 'Harrison', '[', 'Substitute', 'Wife', ']', 'plucky', 'heroine', 'Zellweger', 'Following', 'accident', 'teen', 'listed', 'credits', 'amusingly', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Hurt', 'various', 'members', 'bunch', 'trying', 'find', 'help', 'meet', 'up', 'various', 'townsfolk', 'various', 'times', 'realize', 'something', 'very', 'odd', 'going', 'was', 'great', 'potential', 'here', 'other', 'films', 'Leatherface', 'house', 'time', 'located', 'close', 'decent-sized', 'commercial', 'area', 'have', 'real', 'fun', 'concept', 'instead', 'Henkel', 'company', 'went', 'same', 'straight', 'horror-comedy', 'mix', 'whole', 'series', 'Only', 'recent', 'remake', 'original', 'seriously', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'comedy', 'mean-spirited', 'ugly', 'first', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'will', 'take', 'welcome', 'return', 'form', 'one', 'Henkel', 'was', 'probably', 'responsible', 'most', 'original', 'film', 'gallows', 'humor', 'usual', 'lot', 'going', 'real', 'sense', 'story', 'McConaughey', 'Rube', 'Goldberg-esque', 'prosthetic', 'leg', 'insane', 'CIA', 'agent', 'played', 'chilling', 'John', 'Gale', 'etc', 'again', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'acting', 'really', 'sucks', 'expect', 'B-grade', 'horror', 'flick', 'what', 'gruesome', 'low-budget', 'sort', 'way', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'anywhere', 'amount', 'revilement', 'received.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'greatness', ""'ll"", 'chuckle', 'few', 'times', '**']",N/A
20162,A2OP21WUY8L3WL,0767833902,Robert Meeks,"[2, 3]","In a contest for the worst sequel to 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', what saves this movie over TCM2 is its sense of humor. This is almost a remake. It apes a good bit of the plot of the original. A group of teens take a drive (I would call it a country drive, but they did not have to go very far); their vehicle runs out of gas (I believe; it has been a while); they go in different directions looking for help and individually run into the family of killers. A few of the family members are changed; the gas station now becomes a real estate office; a conspiracy plot involving the Russians (something like that) is thrown in; and instead of a semi the guy gets hit by an airplane (I am not kidding). As a whole the movie is not very good. The first half moves along at a pretty good pace. Then they apparently decided they needed some character development; the family head decides to philosophize about killing and life and libido and Scooby-Doo (just kidding); and a conspiracy is thrown in (apparently world government is behind serial killing families). Although one could credit them for trying to develop a story and perhaps put more depth into it, it does not work. The additional elements drag the movie down. The art direction in this movie hurts it as well, it is chaotic not thematic. If they were looking for chaos in the script and art direction, they found it. The one thing that does help this movie is its sense of humor. It pretty much verges on black comedy, even, at times, irony. There is a scene at the end of this movie which takes place in a hospital.

After many years agreeing with that notion, I find it has aged well. TCM 2 still shines to me as THE over-the-top slasher-satire. And TCM3 was a cheap New Line rock n roll Jason-knock off, that I still embrace. In the wake of the horrible Hollywood remakes, this one works when far removed from the other sequels. When it borrows from the original its not due to lack of originality. It suggests the family's massacres are ritualistic and have some metaphysical formula. The fact that they eat pizza and don't kill a single victim with a chainsaw is Henkel's comment that the family is evil without the brutal motif of the other films. This film blends the intense psychotic values of the family with pitch-black comedy pretty well, but nothing close to the original. But it has some art to it: a full-on transvestite Leatherface, an fresh and surreal Illumanati plot, alien conspiracy!, Matthew McConaughey head squashing a teenage girl with his cybernetic leg, and a thousand dumb horror quotables. I see this entry in the series as the ultimate misunderstood sequel and a good watch for the true (jaded) horror buffs out there.
