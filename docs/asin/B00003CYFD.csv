544216,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00003CYFD,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","This review is dedicated to Natasha Richardson. (God Rest Her Soul)This is an interesting movie in that it may APPEAR to be a simple low comedy. But, but, as we get to know these characters more, we see how deep and profound they really are. And there ARE a lot of moral lessons in this film.The movie starts where we see that Charlize Theron (wife of Patrick Swayzee) and Billy Bob Thorton (husband of Natasha Richardson) have been having an affair with each other. But we also see that they regret their actions, and both want to save their marriage. The 2 married couples plan to go on a vacation to Reno. (As of yet, Natasha and Patrick do NOT know about the affair between Charlize and Billy.)As they continue on their road trip to Reno, we are gradually introduced to the problems with the marriages (and of course what may have contributed to the Charlize/Billy affair.) Simply put, the passion between Natasha and Billy has disappeared in the daily struggles of their lives. Billy is trying to reawaken it, but he is burdened with a cold nature that naturally turns Natasha off. (If we wanted to defend Billy, we may say that perhaps, he doesn't know how he sounds.)Another interesting angle is that Natasha and Patrick have an interesting similarity. They are both kind and compassionate, but they don't know how to assert themselves. This leads to them being hurt.There are well placed moments of comic relief that release the tensions. But there is a 'predictable' but still abrupt moment of discovery which leads to a MAJOR explosion. But what is interesting is that we see Natasha and Patrick suddenly assert themselves.Tony Orlando is good in his small role.Overall, it's a great film that offers great comedy, but at the same time, it offers us true pictures of the human condition that can strike close to home.FINAL NOTE: If you are reading this Liam Neeson, I am very sorry for your loss.",4,We Love You Natasha,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1906,"['review', 'dedicated', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'God', 'Rest', 'Her', 'Soul', 'interesting', 'movie', 'may', 'APPEAR', 'be', 'simple', 'low', 'comedy', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'more', 'see', 'how', 'deep', 'really', 'are', 'ARE', 'lot', 'moral', 'lessons', 'film.The', 'movie', 'where', 'see', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'wife', 'Patrick', 'Swayzee', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'husband', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'other', 'also', 'see', 'regret', 'actions', 'want', 'save', 'marriage', '2', 'married', 'couples', 'plan', 'go', 'vacation', 'Reno', 'yet', 'Natasha', 'Patrick', 'do', 'NOT', 'know', 'affair', 'Charlize', 'Billy', 'continue', 'road', 'trip', 'Reno', 'are', 'gradually', 'introduced', 'problems', 'marriages', 'course', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'Charlize/Billy', 'affair', 'Simply', 'put', 'passion', 'Natasha', 'Billy', 'disappeared', 'daily', 'struggles', 'lives', 'Billy', 'trying', 'reawaken', 'burdened', 'cold', 'nature', 'naturally', 'Natasha', 'off', 'wanted', 'defend', 'Billy', 'may', 'say', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'interesting', 'angle', 'Natasha', 'Patrick', 'have', 'interesting', 'similarity', 'are', 'kind', 'compassionate', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'assert', 'being', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'moments', 'comic', 'relief', 'tensions', ""'predictable"", 'still', 'abrupt', 'moment', 'discovery', 'MAJOR', 'explosion', 'what', 'interesting', 'see', 'Natasha', 'Patrick', 'suddenly', 'assert', 'themselves.Tony', 'Orlando', 'good', 'small', 'role.Overall', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'comedy', 'same', 'time', 'true', 'pictures', 'human', 'condition', 'can', 'strike', 'close', 'home.FINAL', 'NOTE', 'are', 'reading', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'am', 'very', 'sorry', 'loss']",Waking Up in Reno

Patrick Swayze takes on a role most of us have never seen him in - soft and somewhat dim-witted, gentle, and quite lovable. Charlize Theron plays the wife he is trying to impregnate. Billy Bob Thornton is a car salesman, and somewhat of a jerk in the film - but manages to remain oddly likable anyhow. Thornton's wife is portrayed by Natasha Richardson - a housewife with some issues of her own. These four quirky redneck friends decide to take a trip to Reno for a monster truck show and some much-needed vacation time. Along the way there are side-splitting laughs galore and a very dysfunctional good time. This is Jerry Springer meets Road Trip and the result is a ball of fun!

She has sex with her hubby Roy Kirkendall (Patrick Swayze) both in and outdoors. Roy is as dumb as they come, honestly, he cant even see her own cheating habits on him with his best friend, Lonnie Earl (Billy Bob Thornton) when the truth comes out.Billy Bob though gives the best acting here, playing a loney husband whose wife doesnt want to give him the love he so desires.

However, much supposed `hilarity' ensues as it all goes wrong, not least because Billy Bob has been sleeping with Theron - how hilarious!  Thornton plays a thoroughly unlikeable used car salesman so convincingly we just don't feel any of the sympathy we are supposed to feel for him at his wifes aloofness, Richardson makes the only discernible character arc as she loses the dungarees and frumpy look at the end to reveal the 'new her' (yawn), and Theron plays the confused sexpot figuring out if she did the right thing getting married to an idiot.  By the end you'll be convinced she didn't, but the movie would have you think otherwise.  There is not a sympathetic character among them except perhaps for Swayze's character, who could be sympathetic if he was not played so dumb that we just don't care any more by about half way through.  Perhaps there is some satire going on here, revealing this trashy side to the American dream.. but if that's what it is, the message is very confused.  It seems to be saying - ""Hey, has your husband gone and cheated on you?  Well throw a tantrum then make up because it was all your own fault for not giving him enough sex"" - very dubious.Needless to say, they reach Reno, much shouting, revelations and would-be side-splitting antics follow as all is revealed and we wonder who will forgive who.How such a cast ended up in this empty farce I can't imagine... Hey, if all you want to see is Theron in her undies - go right ahead, but don't go looking for depth or substance, or even a few guilty laughs... this turkey is devoid of all of those.

Billy Bob Thornton is perfect as a southern used car dealer, Natasha Richardson as his overall-wearing passive wife.  Charlize Theron plays ""the mistress""; in fact she is trying to be a good best friend to the woman she is cheating and a good wife to her husband, whom she loves. Patrick Swayze plays the victim husband, a really nice guy, but way too nave and totally unable to stand up for himself.The movie is the story of the two couples' red-neck vacation to Reno.  There are many funny moments, and overall it is very enjoyable.  As you can imagine, the acting is good.  It's far from a terrific movie, and it is a ""guilty pleasure"" in a way because the subject is so serious and sad that it feels odd to be watching a comedy about it.

Lonnie Earl's the kind of man who plans vacations to Reno in January for the rates and a monster truck rally - with a stop at a steak-eating competition along the way - while Darlene suffers as an art. Candy and Roy don't seem well matched, but they are trying to have a baby; the trip to Reno is, in fact, a working vacation.""Reno"" makes no secret that Lonnie Earl and Candy sleep together - though their hearts aren't in it - and their infidelity figures heavily an hour into the movie, after the four have wandered all over the Southwest. Writers Brent Briscoe and Mark Fauser - Thornton buds - intend to poke fun at Southerners, but only Thornton, who's spent half his career on the bottom of double bills, squeezes out a half-dozen laughs - he's seen awful scripts before and he knows how to milk them. Candy is target for satire, but Theron, brimming with tears as usual, plays her dead straight. Richardson's performance is an absolute catastrophe and Swayze's just Swayze - staring blankly, stammering, flinching.
