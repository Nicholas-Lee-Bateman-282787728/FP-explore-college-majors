555274,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00004WGC7,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[37, 37]","""Freely adapted"" from the Bible, this film takes huge liberties with the stories of Saul, David, and their battle with the Philistines, but is very watchable nonetheless, and for many reasons, one of them just the fascination of its incongruities. The script is in ""Olde English"", with the ""thees and thous"" often coming from mouths that are speaking another language (the dubbing is hopeless), with two exceptions: The magnificent speaking of both Orson Welles, who makes a superb tormented Saul, and Edward Hilton as Samuel; it is a pleasure to listen and watch both these actors.The rest of the cast is somewhat uneven, but the dubbing is partly at fault. Among the best are Ivo Payer, a handsome Croatian actor as David, Massimo Serato as a scheming Abner, and Eleonore Rossi Drago and Giulia Robini as Saul's daughters Merab and Michael. Italian circus muscle man giant Kronos plays Goliath, enjoying every minute of his screen time as he is seduced into action by a bevy of dancing girls.The score uses Ernest Bloch's glorious ""Shelomo"" theme for the titles, and Carlo Innocenzi incorporates the melody into parts of the rest of the soundtrack (especially when David is romancing Michael), the scenic design uses Nineveh as its inspiration for Jerusalem, and the location shots were filmed in Israel, and Yugoslavia, where the desert turns into lush green fields as far as the eye can see for the final battle sequence.I'm a big sword and sandal epic fan, and this 1960 film gets the award for being the most peculiar of the genre. A great curiosity piece for Welles aficionados, who will love his performance; his bloodshot eyes peer from behind the palace columns, a pasty faced mountain of paranoia, a character that is a joy to watch repeatedly.

Orson Wells did the best he could using what material he had. The one bright spot in the film was the actor who played David. a Croatianactor named Ivo Payer. Very handsome and very muscular. a fitting ideal of David.This must have been his first acting role, for his acting was very intense.Of coarse they omitted any reference to the very close and affectionate relationshipbetween David and Prince Jonathan, King Saul's youngest son. Instead they chose tohave David fall in love with Michael, Saul's younger daughter. In the story, Davidmarries Michael to legitimize his accent to the throne of Israel.

That's typical in this one. The Bible is badly revisited in an episode that is not that particularly thrilling because too much known. The film more or less understands some political questions and sees in the attack of the Philistines against Israel an allusion to the menace against Israel from its Arab neighbors. But all that is nave. The stone civilization against the metal civilization from the north as Solomon will put it later is hardly seen. A sling and a stone against spears and a sword. This symbolism is present but unexploited. That also means The Semites (and that is a lot more than just the Jews) against those from the North, those who speak the Indo-Iranian languages of Mesopotamia, of Babylon, of Persia. All that is missed, and a lot more. The harp is also present but not used to its tremendous meaning. The oldest harp we know in this region is Sumerian and not Israeli or whatever. Israeli music is derived from that Sumerian music of some fifteen centuries before, and it is David who is going to establish the music school of the Temple, of the Levites, and also ,the singing school that will produce the prosody and the psalmody of the Ancient Testament, two musical forms that are both the results of older traditions and the root of twenty centuries to come. Apart from that the film is nave and primitive.

If the had let him direct and edit, maybe . . .This is a late 1950's-ish biblical epics that rode the wake of ""Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur.""  But is is really a pale comparison.I am not a grump, so here are the films good points.1. They try. (Don't worry-this list gets better!)2. They are smart enough to put Orson Welles in a movie.  Admittedly, this is the ""Fat Orson"" that you see in ""The Trial (Le Process)"" and ""Touch Of Evil,"" but it is kind of fun to see his largish blue eyes in color.3. They use the King James English, so it has the pseudo-Shakespearian fell to the dialogue.  My denomination uses the King James Bible so I appreciated the poetry and flow of the language.  It gives a sense of importance to what is being said, like Yoda's backwards-speak.4. To their credit, they use the camera correctly, and try (that word again) to do a ""deep focus"" approach to cinematography.  So it is fun to look at.5. I like casting Ivo Payer as David.  He looks like the early Second Century depictions of Jesus Christ.  Not like the pious olive complexioned and rather effeminate figure we see nowadays, but more like the robust Apollo.  Good job!Bad points:1. This film has horrible pacing.  It is long and drawn out in all the wrong areas.  They could have cut 30 minutes off this film, and it would be fine.2. The copy is bad and scratchy, so it looks like the old reel-to-reels I used to watch in kindergarten.3. They spend a lot of time focusing on Goliath, but to not point.  It is more to show off special effects.  I'm fine with minimal liberties taken with a story, but then need to have a reason for being in a movie.4. Orson Welles is severely restrained: he is practically asleep as he delivers his lines.  For crying out loud!  He is the greatest Shakespearian actor America has produced!  Can't you do something with him?So, only if you have a severe like of Orson Welles (like me), or are a poor Sunday school teacher (like me), I don't recommend this film..

If you're looking for a better rendition of the story of David and Goliath, though, I'm not sure what to tell you.  There aren't many to choose from.  I think Orson does okay for Saul and the guy playing Goliath is a giant, but not ridiculously huge.  He still looks human, but acts retarded.  David, on the other hand does much to ruin the movie as he looks more like an aspiring body builder than a shepherd or musician as he flaunts his way through the film.  Also I think it's trite the way he practically becomes Jesus on his first trip to Jerusalem with his persecuted sadness at the sins of the capitol city.  The daughters of Saul are pretty and almost make the film interesting as one coaxes Abner to villainy while the other coaxes David to righteousness.

I can hear Welles's magnificent voice coming from what's meant to be King Saul but the makeup he's wearing says bloated, window-peeper.  I'd categorize David and Goliath more on the side of cheesy sword & sandal rather than biblical epic and given the genre It's more than a bit distracting when they try to treat Holy Scripture like Shakespeare; in fact the screenplay sounds like something from an amateur church pageant (thee's and thou's flow like cheap wine).Apparently the director thought a story loosely based on scripture and lavish sets would carry throwing together a group of actors, ranging from legendary to lame, and having them just recite their lines.  Hilton Edwards, the veteran of so many religious and historical films, plays the prophet Samuel but unfortunately looks more like one of those big, slow-moving muppets from the Dark Crystal, randomly quoting unrelated clips of scripture like some sort of a nickel-operated fortune-telling machine.  Listening to the characters David and Eglah (sounding like corny dialogue from bad anime) I almost giggled when she was struck by lightning which just goes to show how detached I was from this terrible film.  Goliath (the main antagonist and half of the title) is obviously a person in a body suit from a distance and a furry, sweaty sort-of caveman close up and his sidekick Cret (meant to be the only comic relief) reminds me more of a goofy claymation character.The real tragedy of this movie is that it obviously had a decent budget but I can't emphasize enough how lame it is overall and the poor transfer quality makes it even more difficult to watch.  It's not my intention to be irreverent with this review, I just think such a beloved story deserves better treatment not to mention that Amazon will usually list this stinker in the recommendations when looking up true religious classics like The Robe, Ben-Hur, Quo-Vadis, etc.  :o)",2,Oh How the Mighty have Fallen,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1983,"['How', 'earth', 'did', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'ever', 'end', 'up', 'dud', 'mean', 'can', 'hear', 'Welles', 'magnificent', 'voice', 'coming', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'King', 'Saul', 'makeup', 'wearing', 'bloated', 'window-peeper', ""'d"", 'categorize', 'David', 'Goliath', 'more', 'side', 'cheesy', 'sword', 'sandal', 'rather', 'biblical', 'epic', 'given', 'genre', 'more', 'bit', 'distracting', 'when', 'try', 'treat', 'Holy', 'Scripture', 'Shakespeare', 'fact', 'screenplay', 'something', 'amateur', 'church', 'pageant', 'thee', 'thou', 'flow', 'cheap', 'wine', '.Apparently', 'director', 'thought', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'scripture', 'lavish', 'sets', 'would', 'carry', 'throwing', 'together', 'group', 'actors', 'ranging', 'legendary', 'lame', 'having', 'just', 'recite', 'lines', 'Hilton', 'Edwards', 'veteran', 'so', 'many', 'religious', 'historical', 'films', 'prophet', 'Samuel', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'one', 'big', 'slow-moving', 'muppets', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'randomly', 'quoting', 'unrelated', 'clips', 'scripture', 'sort', 'nickel-operated', 'fortune-telling', 'machine', 'Listening', 'characters', 'David', 'Eglah', 'sounding', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'anime', 'almost', 'giggled', 'when', 'was', 'struck', 'lightning', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'detached', 'was', 'terrible', 'film', 'Goliath', 'main', 'antagonist', 'half', 'title', 'obviously', 'person', 'body', 'suit', 'distance', 'furry', 'sweaty', 'sort-of', 'caveman', 'close', 'up', 'sidekick', 'Cret', 'meant', 'be', 'only', 'comic', 'relief', 'more', 'goofy', 'claymation', 'character.The', 'real', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'obviously', 'had', 'decent', 'budget', 'ca', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'enough', 'how', 'lame', 'overall', 'poor', 'transfer', 'quality', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'not', 'intention', 'be', 'irreverent', 'review', 'just', 'think', 'beloved', 'story', 'deserves', 'better', 'treatment', 'not', 'mention', 'Amazon', 'will', 'usually', 'list', 'stinker', 'recommendations', 'when', 'looking', 'up', 'true', 'religious', 'classics', 'Robe', 'Ben-Hur', 'Quo-Vadis', 'etc', 'o']",N/A

555299,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00004WGC7,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","Orson Welles gets the top billing in this 1960 movie adaptation of the classic Biblical story, but Welles doesn't portray either one of the title characters.  Instead he portrays (and perhaps fittingly so) Saul, the first King of Israel who disobeyed God so many times and lived with a divided heart.  In some ways, Welles' life as the wunderkind of cinema parallels that of the life of King Saul.  Whatever the case, it is Welles' performance that makes this 1960s sword-and-sandal-epic-wannabe worth watching.The story is based upon the Biblical story, but except for the names of the characters, the film strays a great deal from the Bible story.  Everyone knows that David was a shepherd boy who slain the giant Goliath with a slingshot and some stones and David did sing and play songs for Saul to sooth his troubled spirit.  With one or two other exceptions, though, that's about the only thing DAVID AND GOLIATH that's accurate with Biblical writings.  For instance, though David had served Saul, he wasn't an emissary to the Philistines at the time he killed Goliath.  In fact, when David killed Goliath, Saul didn't even have a recognition of who he was.  Also, Saul didn't slay Abner (Abner was later slain by Joab in revenge for his brother's death) and neither did David give Goliath's sword to Saul; he gave it to the priest instead.Despite these discrepancies, DAVID AND GOLIATH isn't too bad of a film.  The acting is decent and includes some excellent performances from both Welles and Hilton Edwards as the prophet Samuel.  Samuel supposedly was the only person in all of Israel that Saul feared and in the movie Edwards seems to be the only actor that Welles fears.  The movie does a decent job at giving some characterization and back story to the famed giant Goliath as well as fleshing out the character of David a bit (he once loved a woman who died tragically).Yet, even with all the positives that it has going for it, DAVID AND GOLIATH doesn't live up to being a Biblical epic or a true swords-and-sandals film.  Some of the characters are just miscast, for instance Ivo Payer seems more like a Greek god rather than a shepherd boy and future great king of Israel.  Also, the movie leads up to the climatic battle between the forces of Israel and the forces of Palestine, but when the battle finally erupts there really isn't much of a battle.  I realize part of this is because of the film code, but the climatic scene of the movie should last longer and be more exciting than a bunch of horses running around and a few men seeming to have a fist fight with bendable weapons.DAVID AND GOLIATH isn't a terrible movie.  Fans of sword-and-sandal pieces might enjoy it because it is a different type of movie in that genre.  People who enjoy Bible stories might enjoy it, though some will not like it at all because it so freely adapts the Bible and roves from the source material.  I do highly recommend it for Welles' fans, though.  He delivers a fine performance and though he shows signs of the behemoth he was to become, he also displays through his performance why he was one of the greatest American actors to grace a stage, screen, or studio.",3,"Decent, But Not an Epic.",1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,3172,"['Orson', 'Welles', 'top', 'billing', '1960', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'Biblical', 'story', 'Welles', ""n't"", 'portray', 'one', 'title', 'characters', 'Instead', 'perhaps', 'fittingly', 'so', 'Saul', 'first', 'King', 'Israel', 'who', 'disobeyed', 'God', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'lived', 'divided', 'heart', 'ways', 'Welles', 'life', 'wunderkind', 'cinema', 'parallels', 'life', 'King', 'Saul', 'Whatever', 'case', 'Welles', 'performance', '1960s', 'sword-and-sandal-epic-wannabe', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'story', 'based', 'Biblical', 'story', 'names', 'characters', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'Bible', 'story', 'Everyone', 'David', 'was', 'shepherd', 'boy', 'who', 'slain', 'giant', 'Goliath', 'slingshot', 'stones', 'David', 'did', 'sing', 'play', 'songs', 'Saul', 'sooth', 'troubled', 'spirit', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'exceptions', 'though', 'only', 'thing', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'GOLIATH', 'accurate', 'Biblical', 'writings', 'instance', 'David', 'had', 'served', 'Saul', 'was', ""n't"", 'emissary', 'Philistines', 'time', 'killed', 'Goliath', 'fact', 'when', 'David', 'killed', 'Goliath', 'Saul', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'recognition', 'who', 'was', 'Also', 'Saul', 'did', ""n't"", 'slay', 'Abner', 'Abner', 'was', 'later', 'slain', 'Joab', 'revenge', 'brother', 'death', 'did', 'David', 'give', 'Goliath', 'sword', 'Saul', 'gave', 'priest', 'instead.Despite', 'discrepancies', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'GOLIATH', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'acting', 'decent', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Welles', 'Hilton', 'Edwards', 'prophet', 'Samuel', 'Samuel', 'supposedly', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'Israel', 'Saul', 'feared', 'movie', 'Edwards', 'be', 'only', 'actor', 'fears', 'movie', 'decent', 'job', 'giving', 'characterization', 'back', 'story', 'famed', 'giant', 'Goliath', 'as', 'well', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'David', 'bit', 'once', 'loved', 'woman', 'who', 'died', 'tragically', '.Yet', 'even', 'positives', 'going', 'DAVID', 'AND', 'GOLIATH', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'being', 'Biblical', 'epic', 'true', 'swords-and-sandals', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'miscast', 'instance', 'Ivo', 'Payer', 'more', 'Greek', 'god', 'rather', 'shepherd', 'boy', 'future', 'great', 'king', 'Israel', 'Also', 'movie', 'up', 'climatic', 'battle', 'forces', 'Israel', 'forces', 'Palestine', 'when', 'battle', 'finally', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'battle', 'realize', 'part', 'film', 'code', 'climatic', 'scene', 'movie', 'should', 'last', 'longer', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'bunch', 'horses', 'running', 'around', 'few', 'men', 'seeming', 'have', 'fist', 'fight', 'bendable', 'weapons.DAVID', 'AND', 'GOLIATH', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'movie', 'Fans', 'sword-and-sandal', 'pieces', 'might', 'enjoy', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'genre', 'People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Bible', 'stories', 'might', 'enjoy', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'so', 'freely', 'Bible', 'roves', 'source', 'material', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Welles', 'fans', 'though', 'fine', 'performance', 'signs', 'behemoth', 'was', 'become', 'also', 'performance', 'why', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'actors', 'grace', 'stage', 'screen', 'studio']",N/A
