An aptly told story with shooting and stuff blowing up, all for some very good reasons.  I was glad to see Denzel Washington doing something so far removed from his many other roles.Keeping in mind all DW's previous roles, which are all very highb row, this film and ""MOF"" make the very well-timed transitional roles between everything else and TRAINING DAY, which was just totally over the top, in a good way!

787163,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0000VJG72,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 4]","`Out of Time', a Denzel Washington thriller showcase directed by Carl Franklin is an object lesson in how to put a character into a bad situation, then turn up the heat until it seems he cannot escape his predicament, and he feels the pressure all the more so because it was created to a great extent through his own mistakes. It is easy to put heroic people into desperate situations, subject to terror and the brink of death, yet their entire predicament is for a just cause. The feeling you have, for example, for Frodo and Samwise on the slopes of Mount Doom surrounded by lava is quite different from the feelings you have for Washington's character. This is true not the least because it is so much easier to associate with a person bound in a web of his own mistakes than it is with a hobbit bound in the web of a giant spider.This is the stuff that tragedies are made from, except that instead of being destroyed by the situation of his own making; the hero does manage to make it out in the nick of time. The best part of his ultimate liberation is that it is brought about by the help of a very good friend who covers for him on two critical points in the story without even being asked and with an assist from his estranged wife who also happens to be a police officer working on the case which drives the plot.Washington is the chief of police for a small town on a small Florida key island, very similar to his role in his earlier movie `The Mighty Quinn'. His recently separated wife is a homicide lieutenant in some much larger, overlapping jurisdiction, possibly the Miami / Dade police force. Washington's best friend is the local medical examiner. In the opening of the movie, it is revealed that Washington is having an affair with an extremely attractive local dental technician married to a former NFL football player who is currently employed as a security guard at the local hospital. It is also revealed that Washington has about 450 thousand dollars in cash in his office safe confiscated from a recent drug bust.The main action of the story is set in motion when Washington's mistress talks Washington to accompany her to her oncologist who reveals that an earlier malignancy has reoccurred and is in an incurable state. After the expected distress, compounded by what is believed to is an abusive husband, the woman signs a 1 million-dollar life insurance policy over to Washington as beneficiary. Washington, thinking the drug money will be tied up in court procedures for months, turns it over to his girlfriend in order to get expensive experimental treatment for cancer. Shortly thereafter, bodies of girlfriend and husband are found in the ruins of their house set on fire by arson shortly after a witness sees Washington running away from the victims' house.All this easily adds up to evidence against Washington, giving him clear means, motive, and opportunity. The pressure mounts as Washington's wife is assigned the case and sets up shop in the town's little police station, right outside Washington's office. The pressure gets turned up as the head of the Miami DEA office calls Washington for the drug money and wants it `yesterday'. So, the second act is largely Washington desperately working at staying one step ahead of both his wife and the DEA.The average viewer will figure out part of the mystery with little trouble, but I won't spoil the fun by revealing it here. The full story, however, is not revealed until the very end. And, the construction of the problem for Washington and his being able to resolve it at the very last minute makes great entertainment spiced up by the very believable situation. There is an almost dreamlike quality to Washington's predicament. No matter what he does, things just seem to get worse, without quite catching up to him.The resolution between Washington and his wife after the case is closed seems a bit improbable, but I can live with that. This is by far the most excitement I have experienced with a PG-13 movie in quite a long time. The writers were even able to keep the body count down, limited to the immediate perps of the crime.Highly recommended for all with reasonably good nerves.",4,"Gripping Thriller.

Washington is Cheif Matt Whitlock who at the beginning makes some very bad mistakes that come back to haunt him.  As he and alex (eva mendes) were on the verge of getting a divocere, he has an affair with ex-girlfriend Ann (sanaa lathan who has been in flicks like (blade, love and basketball, and Brown Sugar).  This was Matt first mistake.  His second mistake was when Ann went to the doctor and supposedly has cancer, decides to become the beneificary for her life insurance policy.  His third mistake was stealing money for a sting operation to help pay for Ann to have surgery.  Chris Harrison (Dean Caine) who was a mean and suspicious husband used this cancer situation to his advantage and get back at Matt.  How does he do it?  Supposedly, the Harrison's house was set on fire and they were supposedly killed.  Matt last mistake was when he and Ann were supposed to meet to pick up the drug money when over to the house, where some people saw him and believed he was the culprit for this act of arson.  Just like the Negotatior (the movie where Samuel L. Jackson had to prove he did not kill his partner and find out who did), Matt was indeed running out of time before all sources were to point toward him.  Of course his soon to be ex-wife who involved in the case.  Matt found out some interesting things concerning Ann.  He found out the doctor that she saw with him is not a real doctor and that her real doctors have reported that she has always been in good health.  While Matt was at the station, he lied, evade and did everything a deseperate man would do to save himself.  He does have a confortation with the fake doctor and does find the Harrisons.  He then finds out what all was going on. Chris might have been behind the whole plan but Ann did some role in it as well.  Alex ends up coming to the aid to keep him from being killed by both Harrison's and they do get back together.

Whitlock (Denzel Washington) has taken $500,000 in drug money from the evidence room at police headquarters and given it to a woman he's been having a passionate affair with, Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan). Harrison has learned that she has aggressive cancer of the lungs and liver; a trip to Europe for expensive alternative therapy is her only hope. Her husband, Chris Harrison (Dean Cain), is a thug who's a security guard for the town's hospital. Ann Harrison works out a $1 million life insurance policy on herself and names Whitlock the beneficiary. He is sure that one way or another he can replace the money before the drug case will ever come to trial. Then three things happen. Both Ann and Chris Harrison are burned to death, beyond recognition, when an arsonist sets fire to their house. Second, Whitlock's estranged wife, Alex (Eva Mendes), who is divorcing him and is a homicide detective, is given the double murder. And third, the drug case becomes active and Federal agents want all the evidence, including the money. Everything starts to point at Whitlock as the probable murderer. It's only a matter of time before his wife lines in the dots. To prove his innocence he has to stay one step ahead of his wife and one step ahead of the Feds. And he has to move a lot faster than the real bad guys, once he figures out who they are.This is a movie that has a lot going for it. The locale looks great. Banyan Key is a place with big trees down main street, seedy houseboats and crab shacks. It's a place that's hot in the daytime and sweaty at night. Denzel Washington as usual turns in a performance that's shrewd and likable. The plot is nicely convoluted, even though it relies on some things falling into place a little too conveniently.What's not to like about it? For starters, the screenplay. There's too much exposition and too little energy. It took a long time, it seemed to me, before the plot started cooking. None of the characters, even Washington's Matt Whitlock, grabbed me sufficiently to care much about them, and the villains weren't very engaging. The casting also, for me, had a major flaw. Eva Mendes is a good looking woman, but at least in this movie she shows a limited acting range. She just couldn't make her character the kind of smart, skeptical, strong woman who might have given Washington a run for his money. Their scenes together seemed to me to be conventionally Hollywood stuff.To see Washington play a first rate police chief in a movie with a lot of charm and energy, check out The Mighty Quinn. To see a movie starring Washington and directed by Carl Franklin that hits all burners, check out Devil in a Blue Dress. Out of Time, for me, is pleasant to watch, but maybe not one to keep. The DVD has a number of typical extras such as outtakes, screen tests, ""making of"" feature and so on. The DVD picture looks great.",3,"Good, But It Had Even Better Potential",1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,2973,"['Matt', 'Whitlock', 'chief', 'police', 'sleepy', 'little', 'south', 'Florida', 'town', 'Banyan', 'Key', 'big', 'problem', 'Whitlock', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'taken', '500,000', 'drug', 'money', 'evidence', 'room', 'police', 'headquarters', 'given', 'woman', 'been', 'having', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Ann', 'Harrison', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Harrison', 'learned', 'aggressive', 'cancer', 'lungs', 'liver', 'trip', 'Europe', 'expensive', 'alternative', 'therapy', 'only', 'hope', 'husband', 'Chris', 'Harrison', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'thug', 'who', 'security', 'guard', 'town', 'hospital', 'Ann', 'Harrison', 'out', '1', 'million', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'names', 'Whitlock', 'beneficiary', 'sure', 'one', 'way', 'can', 'replace', 'money', 'drug', 'case', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'trial', 'Then', 'three', 'things', 'happen', 'Ann', 'Chris', 'Harrison', 'are', 'burned', 'death', 'recognition', 'when', 'arsonist', 'sets', 'fire', 'house', 'Second', 'Whitlock', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Alex', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'divorcing', 'homicide', 'detective', 'given', 'double', 'murder', 'third', 'drug', 'case', 'active', 'Federal', 'agents', 'want', 'evidence', 'including', 'money', 'Everything', 'point', 'Whitlock', 'probable', 'murderer', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'wife', 'lines', 'dots', 'prove', 'innocence', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'wife', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Feds', 'move', 'lot', 'faster', 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'once', 'out', 'who', 'are.This', 'movie', 'lot', 'going', 'locale', 'great', 'Banyan', 'Key', 'place', 'big', 'trees', 'down', 'main', 'street', 'seedy', 'houseboats', 'crab', 'shacks', 'place', 'hot', 'daytime', 'sweaty', 'night', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'usual', 'turns', 'performance', 'shrewd', 'likable', 'plot', 'nicely', 'convoluted', 'even', 'things', 'falling', 'place', 'little', 'too', 'conveniently.What', 'not', 'like', 'starters', 'screenplay', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'too', 'little', 'energy', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'seemed', 'plot', 'started', 'cooking', 'None', 'characters', 'even', 'Washington', 'Matt', 'Whitlock', 'grabbed', 'sufficiently', 'care', 'much', 'villains', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'engaging', 'casting', 'also', 'had', 'major', 'flaw', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'good', 'looking', 'woman', 'least', 'movie', 'limited', 'acting', 'range', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'character', 'kind', 'smart', 'skeptical', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'Washington', 'run', 'money', 'scenes', 'together', 'seemed', 'be', 'conventionally', 'Hollywood', 'stuff.To', 'see', 'Washington', 'play', 'first', 'rate', 'police', 'chief', 'movie', 'lot', 'charm', 'energy', 'check', 'out', 'Mighty', 'Quinn', 'see', 'movie', 'starring', 'Washington', 'directed', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'burners', 'check', 'out', 'Devil', 'Blue', 'Dress', 'Time', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'maybe', 'not', 'one', 'keep', 'DVD', 'number', 'typical', 'extras', 'such', 'outtakes', 'screen', 'tests', 'making', 'feature', 'so', 'DVD', 'picture', 'great']",Out Of Time

What follows is a series of desperate attempts by the Chief to cover up any and all involvement with the deceased--and it certainly doesn't help matters that the homicide investigation is being run by his soon-to-be ex-wife--who has recently been promoted to detective.Stellar performances are delivered by Sanaa Lathan--who plays the married woman with whom the Chief is having an affair--and Eva Mendes, who plays Whitlock's wife.  A fair amount of humor is injected into this intriguing suspense drama by the town's Medical Examiner, played by John Billingsley, who's unwaivering loyalty to the Chief is key throughout.

I guess I was expecting more since Denzel was in it, but this goes to show you that every great actor has a less than great movie every once and a while.This movie really didn't bring out the best in Denzel, or the supporting cast for that matter.  Let me get started on Eva Mendes, she was mediocre at best in the role she played basically because she didn't have any chemistry with Denzel.  She seemed more like his little sister than his estranged wife, and because of that, the movie was kind of ruined for me in the end when they got back together.  I think the character would have been better if someone like Angela Bassett or somebody closer to Denzel's age would have played his wife.  I've only seen Eva in this movie and 2 Fast 2 Furious and so far she hasn't really impressed me, maybe she just needs some better roles.  Dean Cain was alright in his role, he played off of Denzel pretty good in the few scenes they had together.  Sanaa Lanthan did pretty good, but I would have liked to see her be a little more manupulative and evil, but I guess I have to blame that on the script.  I thought she actually had chemistry with Denzel and were a lot more convincing than Denzel and Eva.  But what ruined it for me was when they said they were supposed to be high school sweethearts, again they were stretching it because of the obvious age difference between the two actors.Well like I've said in the beginning it was alright, not what I expected at all.

787185,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0000VJG72,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[2, 4]","'Out of Time' tells the story of a police chief in a small town in Florida.  Chief Matt Whitlock, played by Denzel Washington, is in the middle of a divorce and also in the middle of an affair with a married woman stricken with cancer.  Whitlock has a pristine reputation, but when his girlfriend's seemingly only chance to beat cancer slips away for financial reasons, he makes a morally questionable and illegal decision to help her.  Shortly thereafter, his girlfriend and her husband turn up dead in a house fire, and all signs point to Whitlock as the culprit.The real strength of the movie comes from the characters and Whitlock's attempt to stay one step ahead of the investigation.  Washington, as usual, is excellent.  His performance makes the viewer want to like him and pity him for the mess he has gotten himself into.  John Billingsly, as Whitlock's sidekick medical investigator, is also excellent.  His character is a little more willing to bend the rules, and 100% loyal to Whitlock.  Eva Mendes, as Whitlock's estranged wife that is investigating the murders, Sanaa Lathan, as Whitlock's girlfriend, and Dean Cain, and Whitlock's girlfriend's husband, also turn in decent performances.This is a suspense movie.  As Whitlock raced to stay one step ahead of the investigation, I found myself on the edge of seat to see if he could pull it off.  Washington really sold the suspense with a wonderful portrayal of a man that was cool and collected, but on the verge of a nervous wreck at the same time.  Whitlock's tricks were clever and made sense (you'd probably find yourself doing many of them in a similar situation).There are a few problems with the movie.  One, the setup for the movie takes entirely too long.  It takes about thirty to forty minutes to really get into the plot.  A few people I watched the movie with had given up on it by then.  Second, the movie does seem a little implausible on the whole.  The scheme that surrounds the problems Whitlock finds himself in seem overly complicated and elaborate for the scope of the crime.

787189,A4FAPQKQQLJY1,B0000VJG72,Elite,"[8, 11]","""Out Of Time"" is a good thriller. Simply put, it's a 'who-dunit' movie with good acting, good story, decent script, great locations, and pretty good directing.Like in my title of this review, this movie isn't going to win any awards or anything. But, it is definately worth the price of admission. Denzel Washington plays a cop that is sleeping with this high school sweetheart behind her husband's back. To complicate matters, his soon-to-be ex-wife is back in town. She works for the FBI. After he is framed for the murder of his mistress and her husband, she is put on the case. At this time, nobody even thinks to imagine the police chief would be involved in such a crime. And not only is he being framed for the murders, but the drug-bust money that he gave his mistress the night she died (she needed it for cancer treatments) has come up missing and the DEA wants their money. The problem is he can't explain what happened to it.I know that sounds complicated and convuluted, but it's not a bad plot. It has many twists and turns that keep you guessing....most of the time. Basically, Denzel runs around the whole movie trying to stay one step ahead of the FBI and the invistagtors all the while trying to find proof of his innocence. He has to try to solve the crime himself, while at the same time trying to keep the FBI off his tail.It does keep you on the edge of your seat at times. And it is interesting to see how he can play both sides of the fence while actually keeping his sanity. The pacing of the movie is a bit slow at times, espcially at the beginning. The whole movie has a bit of a sexy feel to it and it definately has the steamy Florida thing down. The problem I had with the story was that it was too obvious to me what the ending was going to be. I saw it coming a mile away, which usually kills movies like this. But the acting was so good, it made up for the shortcomings of the script.Denzel is the man. I have always said that. He picks some stinker movies sometimes, but he is always good in them. ""Out Of Time"" is no exception. He just plays the role perfectly. He is constantly going against the clock in this flick and portrays a constant sense of urgency. He is just a guy who made the wrong decision and tried to help someone and is now getting screwed because of it. You never really think, ""Well, this guy is technically cheating on his wife while sleeping with someone else's wife....."". He is that good.Eva Mendes really proved to me that she can act with this role. I haven't seen her in many movies before this, but I was impressed by her. She plays well opposite Denzel and owns the screen when she is on it. Sanaa Lathan is pretty good here, as well. The two ladies steam up the screen and take some of the heat off the lead. John Billingsly plays a perfect side-kick to Denzel's character. He is the comic-relief, and has very clever diologue and gives the movie a light-harted tone it needs. He was my favorite character in the movie.The one actor that surprised me the most was Dean Cain. He plays a 'badguy' role here and does it quite well. Like the women of the picture, when he is on screen, you just watch. It's such a different role than he has previously played, that it may shock some people. I would definately like to see him in future movies and I still think he would make the perfect Superman in the newer, upcoming movies.I liked this movie, but it just felt like it was missing something. The pacing was a bit slow and the ending was predictable, but I enjoyed the flick. If you can get this DVD for under $15, I would snatch it up and enjoy a good thriller. You won't be disappointed.Special Features: There is a boring, but informative audio commentary from the director, Carl Franklin. Most of the time he just talks about the locations of what is on screen and some technical stuff. It's not the most entertaining I have heard, but it's informative. Then you get the usual crappy promotional featurette. I hate those things. Basically it's the actors just raving about each other and the director. There are outtakes and screen tests, and the trailer. I know this has ""special edition"" written at the top of the box, but I didn't find it all that special.",3,"It won't win any awards, but...........",1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,4224,"['Time', 'good', 'thriller', 'Simply', 'put', ""'who-dunit"", 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'story', 'decent', 'script', 'great', 'locations', 'pretty', 'good', 'directing.Like', 'title', 'review', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'anything', 'definately', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'cop', 'sleeping', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'husband', 'back', 'complicate', 'matters', 'soon-to-be', 'ex-wife', 'back', 'town', 'FBI', 'framed', 'murder', 'mistress', 'husband', 'put', 'case', 'time', 'nobody', 'even', 'imagine', 'police', 'chief', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'such', 'crime', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'framed', 'murders', 'drug-bust', 'money', 'gave', 'mistress', 'night', 'died', 'needed', 'cancer', 'treatments', 'come', 'up', 'missing', 'DEA', 'money', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'it.I', 'know', 'complicated', 'convuluted', 'not', 'bad', 'plot', 'many', 'twists', 'keep', 'guessing', '.most', 'time', 'Basically', 'Denzel', 'whole', 'movie', 'trying', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'FBI', 'invistagtors', 'while', 'trying', 'find', 'proof', 'innocence', 'try', 'solve', 'crime', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'keep', 'FBI', 'tail.It', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'times', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'play', 'sides', 'fence', 'actually', 'keeping', 'sanity', 'pacing', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'times', 'espcially', 'beginning', 'whole', 'movie', 'bit', 'sexy', 'feel', 'definately', 'steamy', 'Florida', 'thing', 'down', 'problem', 'had', 'story', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'obvious', 'what', 'ending', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'usually', 'movies', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'made', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'script.Denzel', 'man', 'have', 'always', 'said', 'stinker', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'always', 'good', 'Time', 'exception', 'just', 'role', 'perfectly', 'constantly', 'going', 'clock', 'flick', 'constant', 'sense', 'urgency', 'just', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'wrong', 'decision', 'tried', 'help', 'someone', 'now', 'getting', 'screwed', 'never', 'really', 'think', 'Well', 'guy', 'technically', 'cheating', 'wife', 'sleeping', 'someone', 'else', 'wife', '..', 'good.Eva', 'Mendes', 'really', 'proved', 'can', 'act', 'role', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'was', 'impressed', 'well', 'opposite', 'Denzel', 'screen', 'when', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'pretty', 'good', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'ladies', 'steam', 'up', 'screen', 'take', 'heat', 'lead', 'John', 'Billingsly', 'perfect', 'side-kick', 'Denzel', 'character', 'comic-relief', 'very', 'clever', 'diologue', 'movie', 'light-harted', 'tone', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie.The', 'one', 'actor', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'Dean', 'Cain', ""'badguy"", 'role', 'here', 'quite', 'well', 'women', 'picture', 'when', 'screen', 'just', 'watch', 'such', 'different', 'role', 'previously', 'played', 'may', 'shock', 'people', 'would', 'definately', 'like', 'see', 'future', 'movies', 'still', 'think', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'Superman', 'newer', 'upcoming', 'movies.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'pacing', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'can', 'get', 'DVD', '15', 'would', 'snatch', 'up', 'enjoy', 'good', 'thriller', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Special', 'Features', 'boring', 'informative', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'Most', 'time', 'just', 'talks', 'locations', 'what', 'screen', 'technical', 'stuff', 'not', 'most', 'entertaining', 'have', 'heard', 'informative', 'Then', 'get', 'usual', 'crappy', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'hate', 'things', 'Basically', 'actors', 'just', 'raving', 'other', 'director', 'are', 'outtakes', 'screen', 'tests', 'trailer', 'know', 'special', 'edition', 'written', 'top', 'box', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'special']",Out Of Time

His talent has made every movie (he has starred in) a classic. However ""Out of Time"" is a very bad example of this. Don't get me wrong...it's a good movie, however the first hour is just dull. His character is having an affair with a woman...and is caught up with her current husband (who is being very abusive). This continues throughout 75% of the movie. It's great acting but it just had me trying to figure out where it was all headed. Then suddenly the suspense begins! Finally...From this point on the movie gets very good...in which it continues to pull you in every direction, shocking you when something wrong is about to happen to Denzel's character. I very much enjoyed the final 25% of the movie...that's why it got a 3 Star rating from me. I fully feel that if the first 75% of the movie had been deleted and I was just handed the final part of the movie with no begining...I would be fully satisfied.

Denzel of course gives another good performance, but this movie is horrible!It ends out being a lame, PREDICTABLE (HITCHCOCK MOVIES AREN'T PREDICTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), and plain bad executed movie. Eva Mendes does a nice job also and she's always nice to look at.As for the plot, it's about a cop (Washington) having an affair with a woman. He illegally gives her money when she has a health probelm. Then she dies mysteriously as well as her mean husband. And somehow, all of the evidence is pointing towards the cop. Guess what. DENZEL IS OUT OF TIME!!!!!!!!!Anyway, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, PERIOD. So, whatever you do, please ignore this trash. I only fear I'm too late. So, please, don't do the same mistake I did, by wasting away 2 hours of my life. So do something else productive with those hours, even spending all of that time eating one pretzel is better than watching this.

The setting is Banyon Key, Florida and Matt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is the chief of police.  He is having a rather torrid affair with Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan), a woman who is married to a former football player Chris Harrison (Dean Cain).  Ann has long since told Matt that Chris hits her, and naturally Matt is angry about this, but because he is keeping the affair secret he can't exactly confront Chris about the hitting.It turns out that Ann has cancer and that she cannot afford any treatment.  Matt tries to help get her the money, including a scheme that would permit her to cash in on her life insurance policy while she is still alive.  These schemes don't work so Matt decides to steal money from the police station that was captured in a drug raid.  Ann changes her life insurance policy to now list Matt as the beneficiary.  Matt tries to give Ann the money late one night and is seen going to her house.  With the way the film is edited as Matt walks away we see the house now in flames before Matt reappears back at his home.  Both Ann and Chris are believed dead (there are two charred skeletons in the house, and Matt knows that he will be the number one suspect if any hint of his connection to Ann leaks out.The rest of the film is Matt playing damage control, trying to hide his involvement as well as figure out what happened.  Matt's ex wife Alex (Eva Mendes) is the lead federal investigator on the case and perhaps because of how close she used to be to Matt, she is able to see that Matt is acting a little strangely when nobody else even has a clue.  As the movie progresses, there are twists upon twists (especially at the end) and some things begin to be a stretch in credulity.This is a decent enough movie, but the way Matt is able to get away with so many things in this movie stretches the bounds of how believable the action is.  Unfortunately, when that happens I get taken out of the movie and start analyzing.  That is never a good thing.  ""Out of Time"" is a bit on the predictable side and when the final and biggest twist happens at the end I thought, ""Well, of course, why wouldn't [that person]?"".  What you get out of this movie depends on what you are looking for.  If you want a fairly fun piece of entertainment with an extremely talented lead actor...this is for you.

His wife Alexandra (Eva Mendes), a Miami homicide gumshoe, has moved out and is getting the divorce papers processed. In the meantime, the sheriff finds solace in the bed of Ann (Sanaa Lathan), the abused wife of jealous Chris (Dean Cain), a local morgue security guard. Paradise begins to unravel when Ann reveals that she has terminal cancer and six months to live. After an unsuccessful attempt to convert a million dollar life insurance policy into the cash needed to fund experimental cancer treatment in Switzerland, Ann makes Matt the beneficiary, and the latter &quot;loans&quot; her five-hundred grand in impounded drug money, evidence in a stalled criminal investigation, that's currently on ice in the sheriff's safe. The night after Ann takes possession of the swag, she and her husband are apparently murdered in their home, which is then torched. Alexandra is assigned to the case. Meanwhile, the cash has disappeared; Matt is identified by a non-reliable witness as the suspicious person skulking outside his paramour's home the night of the crime; and the local DEA chief has phoned to say that he's sending two of his heavies over to take possession of the drug money. Fancy dancing is in order if Matt is to stay out of Deep Bandini.The plot becomes more incredible with a compressed time frame that demands that Matt extricate himself from his mess over two 8-hour work shifts. Alexandra doesn't even have the time to change out of a gloriously short and tight miniskirt and high heels, in which outfit she manages to kick down a locked door. (At that point, my wife leaned over to whisper, &quot;Do you know what would happen if one really tried that?&quot; Perhaps she has a secret life I don't know about?)This isn't Washington's most memorable performance. But, since Denzel is one of Hollywood's most appealing actors, who cares? Matt spends the entire latter half of the film looking like a deer mesmerized by approaching highbeams while teetering on the edge of an abyss. Alexandra is constantly giving him that hard look familiar to guilty husbands everywhere that implies the question, &quot;Is there something you want to tell me?&quot; The Final Confrontation, which takes place in the familiar milieux of rain, darkness, and a creepy abandoned structure, does benefit from a satisfying plot twist.OUT OF TIME is a better than average entertainment vehicle more cost effectively viewed as a DVD rental on the small screen.",4,Pesky libido gets cop into hot water,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,2665,"['OF', 'TIME', 'predicament', 'familiar', 'most', 'men', 'i.e', 'when', 'good', 'sense', 'subverted', 'promise', 'genital', 'happiness', 'pretty', 'woman.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Matt', 'Whitlock', 'Sheriff', 'Banyon', 'Key', 'FL', 'wife', 'Alexandra', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'Miami', 'homicide', 'gumshoe', 'moved', 'out', 'getting', 'divorce', 'papers', 'processed', 'meantime', 'sheriff', 'solace', 'bed', 'Ann', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'abused', 'wife', 'jealous', 'Chris', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'local', 'morgue', 'security', 'guard', 'Paradise', 'unravel', 'when', 'Ann', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'six', 'months', 'live', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'convert', 'million', 'dollar', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'cash', 'needed', 'fund', 'experimental', 'cancer', 'treatment', 'Switzerland', 'Ann', 'Matt', 'beneficiary', 'latter', 'quot', 'loans', 'quot', 'five-hundred', 'grand', 'impounded', 'drug', 'money', 'evidence', 'stalled', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'currently', 'ice', 'sheriff', 'safe', 'night', 'Ann', 'possession', 'swag', 'husband', 'are', 'apparently', 'murdered', 'home', 'then', 'torched', 'Alexandra', 'assigned', 'case', 'Meanwhile', 'cash', 'disappeared', 'Matt', 'identified', 'non-reliable', 'witness', 'suspicious', 'person', 'skulking', 'paramour', 'home', 'night', 'crime', 'local', 'DEA', 'chief', 'phoned', 'say', 'sending', 'two', 'heavies', 'take', 'possession', 'drug', 'money', 'Fancy', 'dancing', 'order', 'Matt', 'stay', 'Deep', 'Bandini.The', 'plot', 'more', 'incredible', 'compressed', 'time', 'frame', 'Matt', 'extricate', 'mess', 'two', '8-hour', 'work', 'shifts', 'Alexandra', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'time', 'change', 'gloriously', 'short', 'tight', 'miniskirt', 'high', 'heels', 'outfit', 'kick', 'down', 'locked', 'door', 'point', 'wife', 'leaned', 'whisper', 'quot', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'one', 'really', 'tried', 'quot', 'Perhaps', 'secret', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""n't"", 'Washington', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'appealing', 'actors', 'who', 'Matt', 'entire', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'looking', 'deer', 'mesmerized', 'approaching', 'highbeams', 'teetering', 'edge', 'abyss', 'Alexandra', 'constantly', 'giving', 'hard', 'look', 'familiar', 'guilty', 'husbands', 'everywhere', 'question', 'quot', 'something', 'want', 'tell', 'quot', 'Final', 'Confrontation', 'place', 'familiar', 'milieux', 'rain', 'darkness', 'creepy', 'abandoned', 'structure', 'benefit', 'satisfying', 'plot', 'twist.OUT', 'OF', 'TIME', 'better', 'average', 'entertainment', 'vehicle', 'more', 'cost', 'effectively', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'rental', 'small', 'screen']",Out Of Time

It has a plot where you are wondering how the Chief of Police from a small town of 1800 can get himself into such a big mess and try to cover his tracks while his estranged wife is investigating the supposed murder of the chiefs girl friend.Chief Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is constantly on the move, whether he is shacking up with his high school sweetheart or running after the money she connived him out of.There are a few twists in the movie, enough to surprise you.  Whitlock attempts to stay one step ahead of his Detective Whitlock (Mendes) and you sometimes are left wondering how he did it.  There is interplay with these two characters, she still has feelings for her husband, yet, you are left wondering why she left him in the first place.There are some interesting plays between characters, Chae, Whitlocks Medical examiner and friend.  For some reason, everyone is loyal to Whitlock.  You wonder if this is the first time he has been in trouble and what he has done to maintain the loyalty of his friends and co-workers.I would recommend seeing the Profiles of the Characters before you see the DVD.  The profiles are a good introduction to the movie and gives a good foundation to build on.This movie is worth viewing, however, the scenes between Washington and Lathan were a little too drawn out and could have been aluded to in order to broaden the range of viewers and viewer appeal.The trailers did not give the story away, so I was surprised at the plot and movie overall.

Jump,"[34, 35]","&quot;Out of Time&quot; is the story of Banyan Keys chief of police Whitlock (Denzel Washington), a man in the middle of a divorce he does not want.  Whitlock turns to his old high-school sweetheart, Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan) for solace, only to learn that she has terminal cancer and cannot afford the alternative treatment that might be her only hope.  Whitlock can't just watch Ann die, so he steals a large chunk of money he bagged in a drug bust from his own department and lets her have it.  But then Ann and her abusive husband Chris (Dean Cain)go up in smoke in an apparent arson, triggering a legal fallout that leaves Whitlock struggling to tie up all the loose ends as his life unravels around him.&quot;Out of Time&quot; is a somewhat formulaic but still successful mystery/suspenser that slowly pulls the viewer into the web along with Chief Whitlock until there's no escape.  Fans of this kind of movie will see a lot of familiar set-ups and plot devices, but the strong cast makes the story work as a whole even if you think you've got it all figured out.  Washington's hapless cop is unfailingly appealing, even if he is guilty of some terrible lapses in judgment (but then aren't we all from time to time?).  Cain and Lathan likewise do well with their roles, and Eva Mendes is a standout as Whitlock's estranged wife, a homicide detective in her own right who slowly discovers more than she wants to about her husband's role in the Harrison case. Will Whitlock be able to put the puzzle together in time to save his skin from a looming murder rap?  And will Mendes help pull him out of the fire, or push him all the way under?  You can't stop watching til you know the answers.The film's seedy, noirish atmosphere is a great plus as well, and if it's not original &quot;Out of Time&quot; is still entertaining.  Overall it's worth 3.5 stars, and certainly a movie you want to watch at least once if you like mystery or suspense films. Like many of its kind, however, it may not hold up to multiple viewings once you've learned the secrets, so it may be one to rent rather than buy.

The only reason I took one star off of this movie is the predictability of the overall plot.  Despite that predictability, &quot;Out of Time&quot; is a movie that is well worth your time for the intensity of the suspense factor alone; is he guilty, will he be found out; which way is this going to go, are just some of the things that goes through your mind when watching this wonderful film that is well worth taking the time to watch and enjoy!Denzel Washington performs brilliantly in this film, as he does with every film he shows up in.  This is probably the first film I've watched that had Dean Cain in it and for the role he's in, he does a very good job.  I believe the only other film that I've seen Eva Mendes in is &quot;Training Day,&quot; another exceptional Denzel Washington film, and her performance was dead on the mark for the role in which she plays.  Another newcomer, Sanaa Lathan, an actress whose work I've never seen before, proves with this movie that she's one to look out for in future films.  For &quot;Star Trek Enterprise&quot; fans, John Billingsley shows up in this film and performs quite well, in a role that seems extremely befitting for his personality.This is the first film that I've watched with Carl Franklin as the director and I would definitely have to say that I was impressed with the film, despite the predictability factor and any future work by this director should be looked forward to.  The score works perfectly for the film, greatly enhancing the dramatic feel of this thriller.The Premise:Welcome to small town America, Banyan Key, Florida where Police Chief Matt Lee Whitlock (Denzel Washington) finds himself in a sordid relationship with Ann Harrison (Sanaa Lathan), who just happens to be &quot;married&quot; to Chris Harrison (Dean Cain).  The intensity of the film heats up pretty soon as there is what &quot;appears&quot; to be a murder and the most likely murderer seems to be the chief of police himself...What follows from there is a film that is somewhat predictable but still quite intense and enjoyable as you follow Denzel Washington's character going through the motions caused by the situation he's found himself in.I would definitely recommend this film to any and all who are fans of fairly well scripted, suspenseful thrillers and for the fact that one of Hollywood's best actors in Denzel Washington is in the lead role.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Audio Commentary by Director Carl Franklin-&quot;Out of Time:  Crime Scene&quot; Featurette-Character Profiles-Outtakes-Screen Tests:  Sanaa Lathan &amp; Dean Cain-Photo Gallery_Original Theatrical Trailer",4,Out of Time - A fairly good suspense/thriller film!,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,2755,"['quot', 'Out', 'Time', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'truthfully', 'very', 'rare', 'case', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'bad', 'script', 'only', 'reason', 'took', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'predictability', 'overall', 'plot', 'predictability', 'quot', 'Out', 'Time', 'quot', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'intensity', 'suspense', 'factor', 'alone', 'guilty', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'way', 'going', 'go', 'are', 'just', 'things', 'mind', 'when', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'film', 'up', 'probably', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'had', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'role', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'believe', 'only', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'quot', 'Training', 'Day', 'quot', 'exceptional', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'film', 'performance', 'was', 'dead', 'mark', 'role', 'newcomer', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'actress', 'work', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'one', 'look', 'out', 'future', 'films', 'quot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'quot', 'fans', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'up', 'film', 'performs', 'quite', 'well', 'role', 'extremely', 'befitting', 'personality.This', 'first', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'director', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'impressed', 'film', 'predictability', 'factor', 'future', 'work', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'forward', 'score', 'perfectly', 'film', 'greatly', 'enhancing', 'dramatic', 'feel', 'thriller.The', 'Premise', 'Welcome', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'Banyan', 'Key', 'Florida', 'where', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Matt', 'Lee', 'Whitlock', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'sordid', 'relationship', 'Ann', 'Harrison', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'quot', 'married', 'quot', 'Chris', 'Harrison', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'intensity', 'film', 'up', 'pretty', 'soon', 'what', 'quot', 'quot', 'be', 'murder', 'most', 'likely', 'murderer', 'be', 'chief', 'police', 'What', 'film', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'still', 'quite', 'intense', 'enjoyable', 'follow', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'character', 'going', 'motions', 'caused', 'situation', 'found', 'in.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'fairly', 'well', 'scripted', 'suspenseful', 'thrillers', 'fact', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'lead', 'role', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Audio', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Carl', 'Franklin-', 'quot', 'Out', 'Time', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'quot', 'Featurette-Character', 'Profiles-Outtakes-Screen', 'Tests', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'amp', 'Dean', 'Cain-Photo', 'Gallery_Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer']",Out Of Time

787220,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0000VJG72,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 2]","I found it odd that Denzel Washington, an actor rarely linked with romance in films, has romantic relationships with two 20-somethings in ""Out of Time"" and is supposed to play someone in his mid-30s. This was only the first plot twist that fractured my concept of suspended reality in this flick.To put it more directly, I could not believe much of what was occurring on screen in this film. I enjoyed the movie and agree it is a good thriller, but I cannot lend much credibility to the overall film. I'd like to say this movie is a great work of art, but it isn't. It has many very entertaining moments but its weaknesses outnumber its strengths, in my opinion. The end product is it is not a very memorable film, although it could have been with more appropriate casting and direction.There were too many coincidences, too many plot twists that could never occur in real life, and too many miscast characters, the first being Washington's wife that was a police investigator but looked and dressed like she was a model throughout the film. Her lipstick and eyebrows were so beautiful and so artistically done that...well, I couldn't believe she was a cop. She exhibited about as much police acumen and investigative imagination as a supermodel, too. This was a ridiculous piece of casting done obviously to show off a beautiful person.The Amazon review said this movie was, ""Partly inspired by 1948's 'The Big Clock' and its nominal 1987 remake 'No Way Out', the Denzel Washington thriller Out of Time is quite enjoyable if you ignore its implausible plotting."" That is very generous praise, indeed. I see a relationship between Kevin Costner's remake of ""No Way Out"" and this film but none between the classic ""The Big Clock"" with Ray Milland.If you order those films in terms of their place in Hollywood legend, ""The Big Clock"" is up among the top 200, ""No Way Out"" is among the bottom half of the film's of its decade and this movie is even lower than that.

Bernabo,"[2, 2]","Having Denzel Washington as the star of this 2003 film is a saving grace because for the most part the audience is way ahead of the main character in &quot;Out of Time.&quot;  Washington plays Matt Lee Whitlock, the chief of police in the small town of Banyan Key, Florida, and gets himself in a situation where if the water is not over his head he has to be breathing through his eyelids.  All of the trailers I saw for this movie had emphasized the idea that Whitlock is being framed, so with that much of a heads up it is impossible not to see this freight train coming down the tracks on top of the chief.  But you can discover the details for yourself.Once it hits the fan there are only two questions.  The first is whether Whitlock can figure everything out and do something about it before he gets nailed by homicide detective Alex Diaz Whitlock (Eva Mendes), who just happens to be the chief's estranged wife and who serves him with a divorce petition before things get really interesting.  The second has to do with the actual level of involvement in the proceedings of one key player (again, this will be obvious when you watch the movie).  Even though the set up is clear, the mystery is how Whitlock is going to get himself out of this one, assuming, of course that he will (but he is played by Denzel Washington, so are assumptions are leaning that way).  Again, I was ahead of the curve on a couple of key points, but then I have become so adept at picking up the clues screenwriters use to set things up in their films.&quot;Out of Time&quot; is one of those films where the star and his performance are enough to forgive a lot of the film's shortcomings.  This is not to say that Washington is alone in his efforts.  I liked the relationship between Whitlock and Chae (John Billingsley), the local medical examiner and resident oddball who becomes the one person the chief can trust; they have some pretty good shtick going at several points in this film.  Then there is Dean Cain, who turns in Superman's cape to play a bad guy; he and Washington have a great scene in a bar where they tell each other everything but admit nothing (compare it to the second audition scene of Cain's to see what choice bits of dialogue were added to the final version).  The end result is enjoyable enough for a one time viewing, but not a keep unless you have everything Washington has ever done all the way back to &quot;Carbon Copy.&quot;",4,Denzel Washington fills in the holes for this thriller,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,2441,"['Having', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'star', '2003', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'most', 'part', 'audience', 'way', 'ahead', 'main', 'character', 'quot', 'Out', 'Time.', 'quot', 'Washington', 'Matt', 'Lee', 'Whitlock', 'chief', 'police', 'small', 'town', 'Banyan', 'Key', 'Florida', 'situation', 'where', 'water', 'not', 'head', 'be', 'breathing', 'eyelids', 'trailers', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'emphasized', 'idea', 'Whitlock', 'being', 'framed', 'so', 'much', 'heads', 'impossible', 'not', 'see', 'freight', 'train', 'coming', 'down', 'tracks', 'top', 'chief', 'can', 'discover', 'details', 'yourself.Once', 'fan', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'questions', 'first', 'Whitlock', 'can', 'figure', 'everything', 'do', 'something', 'nailed', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Alex', 'Diaz', 'Whitlock', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'chief', 'estranged', 'wife', 'who', 'divorce', 'petition', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'interesting', 'second', 'do', 'actual', 'level', 'involvement', 'proceedings', 'one', 'key', 'player', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'Even', 'set', 'up', 'clear', 'mystery', 'how', 'Whitlock', 'going', 'get', 'one', 'assuming', 'course', 'will', 'played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'so', 'are', 'assumptions', 'are', 'leaning', 'way', 'Again', 'was', 'ahead', 'curve', 'couple', 'key', 'points', 'then', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'adept', 'picking', 'up', 'clues', 'screenwriters', 'use', 'set', 'things', 'up', 'films.', 'quot', 'Out', 'Time', 'quot', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'star', 'performance', 'are', 'enough', 'forgive', 'lot', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'not', 'say', 'Washington', 'alone', 'efforts', 'liked', 'relationship', 'Whitlock', 'Chae', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'local', 'medical', 'examiner', 'resident', 'oddball', 'who', 'one', 'person', 'chief', 'can', 'trust', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'shtick', 'going', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'Then', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'who', 'Superman', 'cape', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'Washington', 'have', 'great', 'scene', 'bar', 'where', 'tell', 'other', 'everything', 'admit', 'nothing', 'compare', 'second', 'audition', 'scene', 'Cain', 'see', 'what', 'choice', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'were', 'added', 'final', 'version', 'end', 'result', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'not', 'keep', 'have', 'everything', 'Washington', 'ever', 'done', 'way', 'back', 'quot', 'Carbon', 'Copy.', 'quot']",Out Of Time

This is a respectable body of work.&quot;Out of Time&quot; is excellent because of the fine performances turned in by Denzel, Dean Cain and Sanaa Lathan.  Denzel gives a depth of character to all of his roles.  It was nice to see him as the good guy again after &quot;Training Day.&quot;  Dean Cain is amazing in his role as the husband.  This performance has to be a career high for him.  Sanaa as Ann gives an edgy performance that is convincing.The many plot turns and twists kept me surprised.  I bought the cancer scare completely, but was a bit puzzled that Washington was going to compromise his job by making an off-the-books loan.  The ending with the money was not particularly satisfying; I wanted him to get the girl and the money.  The deleted scenes were interesting, but very quick.

She is later told that she can go out the country for an expensive treatment that may give her several additional years.  She tells Washington she can't possibly afford the treatment so she will just accept what fate has dealt her.Washington decides to ""give"" her a large sum of ""evidence"" cash that nobody will miss so she can have the experimental treatment.  Apparently, the case is over and nobody will look for the cash for a number of years.Things go totally wrong for Washington after that as the wife and her husband are killed in a ""suspicious"" house fire of which a neighbor spotted Washington outside the house just before the fire started.  Additionally, just prior to her death the woman was changing her life insurance beneficiary to Washington (giving him motive) and then the DEA all of a sudden demands the evidence money because it can be tied to another case.

So Whitlock has an affair with an old school friend, Anne-Merai (Sanaa Lathan), who is now married to an abusive former pro athlete (Dean Cain). But his attempts to help Anne-Merai turn to disaster when it appears that she has been murdered and Whitlock's estranged wife Alex (Eva Mendes), now a homicide detective, is assigned to the case.&quot;Out of Time&quot; is director Carl Franklin's latest foray into the quasi-noir genre. His earlier noirs include 1995's &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, which also starred Denzel Washington, and 2002's tepid &quot;High Crimes&quot;. &quot;Out of Time&quot; is good-looking and reasonably entertaining, but too predictable to be anything more. It has a rehashed noir plot. And the story's conclusion becomes obvious as soon as the murder has been committed. Every twist and turn the film takes is immediately recognizable, because it borrows so much from so many noirs, going all the way back to 1944's &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. Like &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, this film's plot elements resemble the pre-1958 noirs more than those of neo-noirs. Unlike &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, &quot;Out of Time&quot; doesn't have brilliant cinematography, political intrigue, or period allure...or Don Cheadle. And our protagonist, Police Chief Whitlock, does stupid things. Thrillers are always more effective and intriguing when the hero plays it smart. What &quot;Out of Time&quot; does have to admire is a very effective middle act. The scenes in which Whitlock senses that he will be blamed for the murder and tries to conceal his involvement with Anne-Merai create real tension. There's a great scene in the police station in which Whitlock frantically attempts to hide his cell phone activity. And Denzel Washington effectively conveys his character's panic when he realizes what has actually happened and how much trouble he is in. So this isn't a bad film. There's just nothing special and certainly nothing original about it. It has an attractive cast and locations. And it has a few edge-of-your-seat moments. Recommended as a rental.The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by director Carl Franklin, a &quot;making of&quot; documentary with interviews, character profiles, 2 outtakes, screen tests for Sanaa Lathan and Dean Cain, an image gallery, and a theatrical trailer. The audio commentary  is decent although Franklin gets off topic sometimes, and I wish he had included more about the film's production design. The &quot;making of&quot; documentary is average, and I would skip the rest of the extras if you are not a hard-core fan. Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.

You have the flawed man unjustly accused. You have a femme fatale who may or may not be dead. Thorny relationships with women. Atmosphere by the bucketload. Sexy, slightly violent, a tad morbid, bundles of wit and humor.This was a sadly ignored film during its' theatrical run. Denzel does his canon proud with another strong performance. While it's not flashy or subtle, it's exactly what the film demands. It fits.The women are, putting it bluntly, absolutely smoking hot. Eva Mendes and Sanaa Lathan are fine actresses, and do nice work here. But in often skimpy clothes in that Miami wet heat, they could recite the phone book and most males would be entranced.Dean Cain is terrific as ""the bad guy"". His scenes with Denzel show him stepping up to the plate admirably. You'd expect Washington to blow him off the screen...and he doesn't. At all.The screenplay has some nice twists and turns. A veteran moviegoer will recognize or anticipate a few of them, but I guarantee there will be several scenes or lines that'll raise everyone's eyebrows. It's not perfect; there are some clunky lines sprinkled here and there.Carl Franklin is a talented director, no question, and this simply will add to his reputation. Again, not flashy, but this story will perfectly told.A special mention is necessary on behalf of John Billingsley. This movie will have people sitting up saying, ""who IS this guy?"" He's an absolute laugh riot. Every time he's on the screen he's hysterical.

It is what I think of as ""sunny noir"" - a standard film noir story taken out of the gritty city streets and moved to a sunny beach community.  In this case, it involves Denzel Washington as a small town police chief whose estranged from his homicide detective wife and sleeping with his old girlfriend, who is in turn still married to her abusive husband.When Washington finds out his girlfriend has cancer, and that the only treatment is an expensive experimental treatment in Switzerland, he steals some evidence money to help her.  Then, she and her husband are apparently killed in a fire, but that quickly turns out to be a con.  Suddenly, Washington is stuck in a perilous place; on the one hand, he must evade his wife, who is investigating the crime and on the other, he must retrieve the money (which the DEA wants).As stated before, this is an utterly routine movie, with little to distinguish it from a dozen or more movies that seem to cover the same ground.  Washington's performance is good but nothing special; the action scenes are only moderately exciting, and in general, the writing is bland, with no real plot twists (even the ""twist"" of the fake deaths can be seen a mile away).

787251,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B0000VJG72,Patrick L. Randall,"[1, 1]","I have always thought very highly of Denzel Washington as an actor.  His Oscar-winning roles in ""Glory"" and ""Training Day"" are quite compelling.  Some of his roles where he failed to win an Oscar (or even be nominated), such as ""Malcolm X"", ""Courage Under Fire"", and ""The Hurricane"" are even more impressive.  Yet, though there are many actors who, given good material, can perform quite well, the true mark of a great actor is their ability to elevate a bad material and lousy script and make it a totally watchable movie.  Denzel is just such an actor.  As many times in his career as he has delivered tour-de-force performances in excellent movies, he has also managed to make a number of poor films enjoyable.  Some of the turkeys he has been a part of include ""Ricochet"", ""Virtuosity"", ""The Preacher's Wife"", and this 2003 entry ""Out of Time"".  In each case, these films contain laughable characters, wildly over-the-top plot twists, and poor dialogue.  Yet, Washington manages to elevate these films (he did have an assist from Russell Crowe in ""Virtuosity"") to a level of campy, popcorn fun.Denzel's latest, ""Out of Time"", would be an utter failure in the hands of a lesser actor.  The generic title and wildly implausible script could easily assign this to most critics' and moviegoers' non-descript pile.  Yet, the presence of Denzel Washington makes this film very enjoyable and allows the audience to overlook flaws in the film.The film takes place in a sleepy Florida town where Matt Lee Whitlock (Denzel Washington) serves as its police chief.  Aside from a very notable drug bust that he was involved in, the only other drama in Whitlock's life comes in the form of his impending divorce from his wife Alex (the sexy Eva Mendes), a federal agent, and his affair with the wife, Anne Marie Harrison, (Sanaa Lathan) of a former NFL quarterback and current wife-beater, Chris Harrison (Dean Cain in a sleazy turn that will stun the fans of ""Lois and Clark"").  While Matt laments the ending of his marriage, he seems to be pleasurably distracted by his involvement with Anne Marie until she tells him that she has cancer and may only have a few months to live.  She needs a radical medical procedure involved in Europe, but doesn't have the money to pay for this expensive procedure.  Matt, in a moment of emotional weakness decides to pull the evidence money from the drug bust from his safe and give it to her to pay for the procedure.  Of course, not long after he does that, the Harrison's house goes up in flames as a result of arson and both Anne Marie and Chris are presumed dead.  Now, with the money gone and feds unexpectedly breathing down his neck for that evidence, Matt's soon-to-be ex, Alex, returns to town to investigate the arson.  Realizing that almost all of the evidence points to him, Matt begins a panicky race against time to find out what really happened while covering the clues that could indict him.""Out of Time"" has quite a bit working for it.  The South Florida atmosphere, very attractive female leads, and white-knuckle tension give this film a lot in its favor.  It should be mentioned that Matt's sidekick, medical examiner Chae (played by John Billingsley of ""Star Trek: Enterprise""), provides wonderful comic relief to prevent this film from overdosing on the tension.  Of course, the implausible scam concocted to defraud Matt of the evidence, the ludicrous plot twists at the end, and dialogue that is slightly less than Shakespearean are strikes against the film.  As alluded to before, had this been in the hands of a lesser actor, this movie would not have been worth seeing.  Fortunately, Denzel once again rides to the rescue of a film and, in this case, elevates it to a four-star thriller.",4,Denzel turns laughable plot into a white-knuckle thriller,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",2003,3743,"['have', 'always', 'thought', 'very', 'highly', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'actor', 'Oscar-winning', 'roles', 'Glory', 'Training', 'Day', 'are', 'quite', 'compelling', 'roles', 'where', 'failed', 'win', 'Oscar', 'even', 'be', 'nominated', 'such', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'Hurricane', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'are', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'given', 'good', 'material', 'can', 'perform', 'quite', 'well', 'true', 'mark', 'great', 'actor', 'ability', 'elevate', 'bad', 'material', 'lousy', 'script', 'make', 'totally', 'watchable', 'movie', 'Denzel', 'just', 'such', 'actor', 'many', 'times', 'career', 'delivered', 'tour-de-force', 'performances', 'excellent', 'movies', 'also', 'managed', 'make', 'number', 'poor', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'turkeys', 'been', 'part', 'include', 'Ricochet', 'Virtuosity', 'Preacher', 'Wife', '2003', 'entry', 'Time', 'case', 'films', 'contain', 'laughable', 'characters', 'wildly', 'over-the-top', 'plot', 'twists', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'Washington', 'elevate', 'films', 'did', 'have', 'assist', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Virtuosity', 'level', 'campy', 'popcorn', 'fun.Denzel', 'latest', 'Time', 'would', 'be', 'utter', 'failure', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'generic', 'title', 'wildly', 'implausible', 'script', 'could', 'easily', 'assign', 'most', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'non-descript', 'pile', 'presence', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'audience', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'film.The', 'film', 'place', 'sleepy', 'Florida', 'town', 'where', 'Matt', 'Lee', 'Whitlock', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'police', 'chief', 'Aside', 'very', 'notable', 'drug', 'bust', 'was', 'involved', 'only', 'other', 'drama', 'Whitlock', 'life', 'form', 'impending', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Alex', 'sexy', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'federal', 'agent', 'affair', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Harrison', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'former', 'NFL', 'quarterback', 'current', 'wife-beater', 'Chris', 'Harrison', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'sleazy', 'turn', 'will', 'stun', 'fans', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Matt', 'ending', 'marriage', 'be', 'pleasurably', 'distracted', 'involvement', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'cancer', 'may', 'only', 'have', 'few', 'months', 'live', 'radical', 'medical', 'procedure', 'involved', 'Europe', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'pay', 'expensive', 'procedure', 'Matt', 'moment', 'emotional', 'weakness', 'decides', 'pull', 'evidence', 'money', 'drug', 'bust', 'safe', 'give', 'pay', 'procedure', 'course', 'not', 'long', 'Harrison', 'house', 'up', 'flames', 'result', 'arson', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Chris', 'are', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Now', 'money', 'gone', 'feds', 'unexpectedly', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'evidence', 'Matt', 'soon-to-be', 'ex', 'Alex', 'town', 'investigate', 'arson', 'Realizing', 'almost', 'evidence', 'points', 'Matt', 'panicky', 'race', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'covering', 'clues', 'could', 'indict', 'Time', 'quite', 'bit', 'working', 'South', 'Florida', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'attractive', 'female', 'leads', 'white-knuckle', 'tension', 'give', 'film', 'lot', 'favor', 'should', 'be', 'mentioned', 'Matt', 'sidekick', 'medical', 'examiner', 'Chae', 'played', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'relief', 'prevent', 'film', 'overdosing', 'tension', 'course', 'implausible', 'scam', 'concocted', 'defraud', 'Matt', 'evidence', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'dialogue', 'slightly', 'less', 'Shakespearean', 'are', 'strikes', 'film', 'alluded', 'had', 'been', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Fortunately', 'Denzel', 'once', 'again', 'rides', 'rescue', 'film', 'case', 'four-star', 'thriller']",Out Of Time

handling a pen sitting on this doctors desk and takes it for fingerprints.It turns out the fellow is an ex morgue employee,who Sanaa's boyfriend knew very well.Denzel tracks the man down to an

Denzel,Sanaa waves a gun at him and even shoots him in the leg.She apparently had been the mastermind behind it all and now she wants the money and/or Denzel dead.Just as Denzel is about to get his,his wife arrives and shoots Sanaa dead.The DEA arrives to collect their drug money,which Denzel has been trying to avoid for the entire day.The coroner and friend who had helped Denzel all the way,arrives(purposely)late saying he couldn't find the DEA building.The DEA reps go off in disgust,but at least ask no tough questions.The film ends as Denzel and Eva have reconciled.The film starts out very slowly,and one wonders where the thing is going.This,I believe,was purposely done,which almost backfires,considering the length of time it takes to get there.Also Denzel is playing a less than apathetic character which works against things too.However comes the moment when the house burns down""killing""his girlfriend and her boyfriend,that the intensity and flow of the movie change on a dime.From that point you become glued to the film wondering if Denzel can somehow outwit the authorities,especially his wife,in order to remain free and clear.And just when you think the pressure can't get any heavier,he learns that the whole thing has been a set up with the discovery of the ex morgue worker who was posing as Sanaa's doctor when she was fatally diagnosed with cancer.The film doesn't stop the roller coaster ride until just after Denzel's final confrontation with Sanaa.Then we breathe a little easier until the end fade out.John Billingsley as Denzel's friend the coroner,does a great job in his role.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include the trailer,commentary,two outtakes,a featurette,screen tests and more.All in all a good thriller that doesn't pick up steam until well into its journey.It is almost the films' fatal flaw until the plot suddenly changes drastically and then it is hold onto your seats time as it shifts into high gear.A flawed but decent flick.3 1/2 stars.",4,Good thriller that satisfies....in the end.,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,4662,"['Time', 'released', 'Oct/03', 'Denzel',

Zwick,"[2, 6]","In ""John Q,"" Denzel Washington played an uninsured man so desperate to get medical treatment for his ailing child that he took over an entire hospital emergency room, precipitating a full-blown hostage crisis in the process.  Now, in ""Out of Time,"" Washington plays a chief-of-police in Florida so desperate to get medical treatment for his terminally ill girlfriend that he steals over $400,000 in impounded drug money, resulting in a great deal of trouble for himself when she turns up mysteriously murdered.  Do we note a pattern here?""Out of Time"" takes its cue from ""Charade"" and any number of Hitchcock films in which an innocent person becomes enmeshed in a complex scheme perpetrated by people who are not what they pretend to be.  Though we can never take ""Out of Time"" seriously even for a single moment, the film does do a good job spinning out its story, making us empathize with a man whose entire career is on the line should the finger of suspicion alight on him.  It is Washington's job here to make sure he stays two steps ahead of everyone else to prevent that from happening, and it is in watching him frantically do so that we derive our pleasure.  It is, however, imperative that we suspend our disbelief for the duration of the film in order to enjoy it.Washington isn't required to do a great deal of acting here and one wishes that he would choose roles with a bit more substance and meat to them.  But ever since he won his Oscar for ""Training Day,"" he seems to be content to kill time appearing in efficient but soulless exercises such as this one (""Antwone Fisher"" being the obvious exception).

787260,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000VJG72,Samuel McKewon,"[20, 27]","""Out of Time"" is a nice little exercise of the crackerjack plot, an entirely forgettable wrong-guy-accused yarn fit for its day in court some HBO Saturday night. But what is it doing as a big budget thriller? And what is Denzel Washington doing within 100 yards of it?Not that Washington, now with two Oscars, hasn't slummed before - ""Fallen"" and ""John Q"" come to mind - but Dave Collard's script is too thin and Carl Franklin's direction too hurried for the movie to be anything more than a passing thought. And the casting is something else: Washington is forced to play love interest to Sanaa Lathan and Eva Mendes, women 17 and 20 years his junior. Washington has impressive range, but who knew the Ralph Macchio role was part of it?The plot in a quickie: Washington is Matt Whitlock, a newly separated, small-town Florida cop in an affair with his high school sweetheart Anne Marei (Lathan) whose abusive husband (Dean Cain) is a former quarterback out of cash. During one afternoon tryst, Anne Marei takes Matt to the doctor with her, where he learns she has terminal cancer. After some stomach churning, Matt steals a half-million in confiscated drug money to help her pay for the alternative treatment in Switzerland.The night she's to pick it up, she doesn't show. The next morning her house has burned down. And Matt's slated as beneficiary to her life insurance policy. Another complication: Matt's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Alex (Mendes), is the lead homicide detective on the case.""Out of Time"" then shifts into a game of Matt eliminating clues that point to his guilt, tracking the source of the setup - a shiny nickel if you can guess that one - and taking an afternoon siesta to reminisce with Alex. Franklin zips through the material in an attempt to gloss over a criminal plan that not only doesn't hold up but never made sense in the first place.In what is essentially an asexual role, Washington generates no heat with Mendes or Lathan. Mendes is naturally likable and good-looking in a Jennifer Lopez kind of way, but Alex and Matt's marriage is built on moviesphere, nothing more.Beyond that, when it is ever good to take the smartest guy in the picture and figure him for a mark? If that actor is, say, Nicolas Cage, who can play loose and goose, that one's thing. But Washington sweats smarts, and while ""Out of Time"" shows Matt as light on his feet, it first must establish him as a dope - and a heel.",3,Not worthy of Denzel's presence,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,2420,"['Time', 'nice', 'little', 'exercise', 'crackerjack', 'plot', 'entirely', 'forgettable', 'wrong-guy-accused', 'yarn', 'fit', 'day', 'court', 'HBO', 'Saturday', 'night', 'what', 'doing', 'big', 'budget', 'thriller', 'what', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'doing', '100', 'yards', 'Not', 'Washington', 'now', 'two', 'Oscars', ""n't"", 'slummed', 'Fallen', 'John', 'Q', 'come', 'mind', 'Dave', 'Collard', 'script', 'too', 'thin', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'direction', 'too', 'hurried', 'movie', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'passing', 'thought', 'casting', 'something', 'else', 'Washington', 'forced', 'play', 'love', 'interest', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Eva', 'Mendes', 'women', '17', '20', 'years', 'junior', 'Washington', 'impressive', 'range', 'who', 'knew', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'role', 'was', 'part', 'plot', 'quickie', 'Washington', 'Matt', 'Whitlock', 'newly', 'separated', 'small-town', 'Florida', 'cop', 'affair', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Anne', 'Marei', 'Lathan', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'former', 'quarterback', 'cash', 'one', 'afternoon', 'tryst', 'Anne', 'Marei', 'Matt', 'doctor', 'where', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'stomach', 'churning', 'Matt', 'half-million', 'confiscated', 'drug', 'money', 'help', 'pay', 'alternative', 'treatment', 'Switzerland.The', 'night', 'pick', 'up', ""n't"", 'show', 'next', 'morning', 'house', 'burned', 'down', 'Matt', 'slated', 'beneficiary', 'life', 'insurance', 'policy', 'complication', 'Matt', 'soon-to-be-ex-wife', 'Alex', 'Mendes', 'lead', 'homicide', 'detective', 'case', 'Time', 'then', 'game', 'Matt', 'eliminating', 'clues', 'point', 'guilt', 'tracking', 'source', 'setup', 'shiny', 'nickel', 'can', 'guess', 'one', 'taking', 'afternoon', 'siesta', 'reminisce', 'Alex', 'Franklin', 'material', 'attempt', 'gloss', 'over', 'criminal', 'plan', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'never', 'made', 'sense', 'first', 'place.In', 'what', 'essentially', 'asexual', 'role', 'Washington', 'heat', 'Mendes', 'Lathan', 'Mendes', 'naturally', 'likable', 'good-looking', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'kind', 'way', 'Alex', 'Matt', 'marriage', 'built', 'moviesphere', 'nothing', 'more.Beyond', 'when', 'ever', 'good', 'take', 'smartest', 'guy', 'picture', 'figure', 'mark', 'actor', 'say', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'loose', 'goose', 'one', 'thing', 'Washington', 'smarts', 'Time', 'shows', 'Matt', 'light', 'feet', 'first', 'must', 'establish', 'dope', 'heel']",Out Of Time

Nevertheless, it succeeds in providing enough suspense and subtle plot twists that keep the rhythm going and the interest of the audience alive.Denzel Washington plays Matt Whitlock, a police chief in Banyan Keys, FL who has been abandoned by his wife recently and is involved in a relationship with Ann, a married woman. Everything goes well until Matt finds out that Ann has cancer, which was in remission but has come back with a vengeance and she has only six months left to live. The only option to prevent this is to try experimental procedures that are extremely expensive. In the meantime, Ann finds out that her husband has increased the life policy they had bought for her to $1,000,000. The final piece of the story is that Matt made a bust of a drug dealer and has $485,000 sequestered for evidence in the safe in his office.In this setting, one imagines that the story will develop according to one of the usual formulas, and it surely does. The movie, however, is very well done, with passages of high intensity and great performances, which compensate in part for the plot ""defects"". One final aspect that I liked is the photography; I usually do not expect to find high quality in this area in a thriller, but in this case the scenery makes this task easy to accomplish.

Even his ex-wife/wife, Alex (played by the beautiful Eva Mendes) seemed rather stiff in this movie. Mathias and Alex are in the middle of a divorce even as they are paired together in this action packed suspence drama.I must say though that Dean Cane who played Anne-Marie's husband Chris, did a stand out performance.  He and Denzel played off of each other extremely well.  I saw an interview where Denzel even commended Dean on his performance. Believe it our not, Denzel had never heard of him before. The scenes they have together are really intense and adds much needed depth to this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if Dean is in another movie starring Denzel.

Denzel Washington stars as the sheriff of a small and idyllic Florida town who's faced with an ethical dilemna when his love is diagnosed with a fatal disease that's potentially curable, but only at an extremely high cost that her insurance won't cover.  The sheriff can get his hands on the money needed easily enough - it's in the form of the ill-gotten gains of Florida drug dealers, sitting indefinately in the evidence safe at the local police station.  He works out a plan he can live with that would provide the needed treatment without trampling on his integrity and principles more than would be bearable, but what seems workable gets a lot more complicated when some very unexpected events begin occuring.  Scams and cons, ethical shades of grey, double-crosses and plot twist after plot twist crank up the suspense and action to uncanny levels, and ample doses of comedic content that could have been sorely out of place manage to fit in perfectly and just make the whole show better and more fun.  Spearheaded by Washington, the whole cast turns in excellent performances and complete the job of taking this stunner into the upper reaches of moviedom.

It is pure entertainment with no particular social message (and that's not a bad thing to me), supported by good acting all around and the humid atomosphere of Florida.The story reminds you of Kevin Costner thriller ""No Way Out,"" but Denzel Washington's character, police chief Matt Lee Whitlock is more convincing than the other.  He just wants to do his jobs well and have some happy time with his love Ann, though he knows he cannot forget his (now estranged) wife (and homicide detective) Alex played by Eva Mendes.Then, a murder happens in his town.  Matt starts to investigate the case, but somehow every evidence points to the most unexpected person -- himself!  While dodging the investigations from his suspecting wife and unfriendly FBI guys, Matt almost single-handedly has to find out the truths behind the complicated case.The script by David Collard (for the first time for feature film) has nothing special in it, but director Carl Franklin helms the film with assured hand, and seldom stops the motion.  The suspence is created tactfully, but if you are a kind of person who does not believe in the police chief (who should be wise enough) relying on the incredible ruses, well, then, Denzel Washington would make you do with his good acting, as usual.  (Of course, that does not mean this is his best, though.)Other actors are also good; ever-gorgeous Eva Mendes is much better here (than in ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), as a credible and energetic detective, and Dean Cain also gives us surprisingly good acting as a bullying husband (though his fans may not like it).  The best prize, however, goes to John Billingsley, who plays the coroner (and the only ally to Denzel Washington), whose disarming humor is another added charm to the otherwise ordinary sketches of characters.""Out Of Time"" is a pure entertainment, and pretty good at that.
