1514048,ACT23DA95IX31,B0069RWAL0,Book-Movie-Music Lover,"[10, 10]","There are a lot of Christian movies that have Christian beliefs as the main theme, and then develop plots around those themes. What is nice about this movie is that it focuses on a main theme and adds a few (thankfully subtle) Christian elements to support that theme, but elements that can actually be considered universal. In other words, you don't have to be Christian to appreciate the movie, and the movie certainly doesn't attempt to get you to become a Christian. It is really just a good, solid, movie that holds one's interest from start to finish. It has some really powerful scenes, and it has an important, universal message that will speak to people of all faiths. It is a movie that everyone in the family can - and should - watch, particularly people who question the value and purpose of their lives. In sum, this movie can really make a difference in people's lives - regardless of their faith (or lack of it).",5,Inspiring Without Being Preachy,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,927,"['are', 'lot', 'Christian', 'movies', 'have', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'main', 'theme', 'then', 'develop', 'plots', 'themes', 'What', 'nice', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'few', 'thankfully', 'subtle', 'Christian', 'elements', 'support', 'theme', 'elements', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'considered', 'universal', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Christian', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'get', 'become', 'Christian', 'really', 'just', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'one', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'really', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'important', 'universal', 'message', 'will', 'speak', 'people', 'faiths', 'movie', 'everyone', 'family', 'can', 'should', 'watch', 'particularly', 'people', 'who', 'question', 'value', 'purpose', 'lives', 'sum', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'make', 'difference', 'people', 'lives', 'regardless', 'faith', 'lack']",Me Again

The plot was a little bizarre at times - shades of Freaky Friday meets It's a Wonderful Life.  The hero who starts out the movie as a zero, learns some valuable lessons as do the viewers, if they don't already know them. The number one cause of unhappiness is our lack of gratitude to God for the life we have, focusing on the things we don't have instead of the blessings we do possess. Having lost my wife and children to a divorce, I can relate to the pain the hero was going through as he faced the possibility of that disaster striking his life. Divorce is a very painful and destructive decision. People planning to get married should see movies like this before they say I do. And they should get regular booster shots to remind them.",4,God hates divorce.

I think he could do this kind of comedy blindfolded.  However, the script was kinda pitiful, and even the content was way out and the Mr.Limpet fish thing was just terrible.  Everything about this film was just low budget and corny.  Now, it wasn't awful, and had some cute parts but the editing was choppy, and for the most part, it was really slow moving.

This movie is also about a man who doesn't like his life (or himself) and finds out, instead, what life is like for others by becoming them. &#34;Me Again&#34; is a very funny, clever twist on &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;, but while that movie is a drama, this one is definitely a comedy. I giggled and belly laughed throughout it (the parts where he lives life as his daughter's boyfriend are especially hilarious), but there are very profound and serious messages in it as well.The main character is a pastor who is ineffective (and possibly harmful) as a counselor to the marriage of a young couple with a baby, a wimpy father (his children throw food at him and he barely notices, and he breaks promises to them making them mistrustful of him), an emotionally checked out husband, and an overall wishy-washy person. Living life as others gives him drastically new perspectives about how he sees others and himself as well as how God sees people.Although this movie is very funny, and I laughed during most of it, I was in tears (the kind most of us experience when we hear Truth spoken) by the end of it. What he tells the young couple with the baby is something every new parent should hear, and what he tells his congregation is what everyone should hear.
