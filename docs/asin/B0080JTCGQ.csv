1540609,A11LRVWS3OTF87,B0080JTCGQ,"George Allen Papapetrou ""Allen""","[17, 18]","Richard Martini's Flipside the Film (the DVD and Instant Video both available from Amazon) is a follow up to his Flipside the Book (available in print and Kindle formats from Amazon).As a talented film maker Martini is also a talented story teller. Reading his book was like listening, riveted, while a friend tells the story of his amazing adventures while discovering new lands.In the film Martini shows his documentary skills by clearly and simply progressing through all the salient points about the life's work of Psychologist and Hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton. In just an hour and a half.Dr. Newton's life's work was focused ""by accident"" upon the reporting by his clients about their experiences in a ""Soul Space"" between and during their human incarnations. With 7000+ case studies over 30 years Newton summarise his studies as ""Life Between Lives"" or LBL.Dr. Newton's tool for helping his clients and exploring LBLs was very deep hypnotherapy. As Martini progresses through his documentary he interviews Dr. Newton and other LBL Hypnotherapists. He also shows excerpts from a number of LBL sessions including his own.When I read Martini's Flipside book in the fall of 2011 the only other literature I read covering the same territory as Dr. Newton was Seth's three novels called The Oversoul Seven Trilogy (1973, 1979, and 1984). Seth's told his stories from the Oversoul's point of view - learning lessons at once from several of his incarnations in different centuries - who didn't know of his existence through most of the series.Martini, in the book and the film, shows Dr. Newton staunchly determined not to read anything which may have biased his research. He didn't know about Seth. His client's point of view was from the view point of an incarnated soul who only experienced his or her ""oversoul"" in deep hypnosis.Martini, Newton, and I describe ourselves as very skeptical. I come from a strong science background in Astronomy and Physics, Mathematics and Statistics, and Psychology. I'm not skeptical about Dr. Newton's research.Although, I have slightly different (yet augmenting) perspectives, I believe that 1000 years from now Michael Newton could be more famous than Issac Newton.I only have one technical critique of Martini's documentary. As I got absorbed in the action of the video, some of the captions disappeared before I finished reading them. Fortunately, pause and rewind saved me.Watching Martini's film could well improve the positive feelings you have about yourself, the universe, and everything.Aloha..

I had to use a set of good wireless headphones in order to hear the dialog, and even then it sounded like an old worn-out phonograph record.  The sound kept moving from one ear to the other, and all interviews are heavily edited.Next, throughout the length of the film they are constantly throwing text at you on the screen while they talk through it in the background.  Sometimes the text matches the spoken part, sometimes it does not.  I had to frequently freeze-frame the picture in order to read the speedy texts.  In any event, it made concentration difficult, and I had to hit replay constantly.The premise here is that reincarnation is absolutely real because 4,000 (or was it 7,000?) test subjects all report ""exactly the same experiences ""between"" lives"".  This is patently absurd.  That plus the fact that people such as Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, J.D. Salinger, Walt Whitman, and the Dalai Lama say so.When the host asks near the end , if we are all choosing each ""re-born life"" continually....why we have not been more aware of this until now, he can only come up with two lame excuses: density of communities due to overpopulation and modern drug usage.  I guess he never heard of places like North Dakota or Alaska, and isn't aware of mind-altering drug usage in primitive cultures going back before recorded history.I have always been interested in first-hand accounts of near-death experiences, but this is NOT what we have here.
