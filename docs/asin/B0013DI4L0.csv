A jade plaque that when assembled lets them there evil critters in from another world.Archeologist/teacher Danny Freemont (Casper Van Dien) is in the process of finding the plaque quadrants from the far corners of the earth.Morgan Sinclair (Jonathan Hyde) competing archeologist/teacher and member of that popular cabal ""Hell Fire"" is in the process of pilfering jade plaque pieces from never learning and unsuspecting Danny Freemont.Now here comes the Hallmark part. Danny loves Dr. Azelia Barakat (Leonor Varela), who loves Government Official Yunan Heikal (Parvin Dabas) who is in love with Egypt. Will anyone get together?Will the bad guys finally win or is this just another save the world at the last minute movie?This is supposed to be Egypt however, it is filmed in India.

If it actually was a mini-series on some channel it's good that it ended after 170 minutes, because this is 170 minutes of pure misery!.I don't mind watching a B movie here or there, but WHO IN THE WORLD WANTS TO WATCH ALMOST 3 HOURS OF CRAP??!!!  This movie would have been much easier to tolerate if it were 1 1/2 hours or less, like a typical B movie.I couldn't make it through this movie; I had to escape from hell.

I must say that the special effects and scenery is excepitional and worth the three hours viewing. Malcomb McDowell & Jonathan Hyde give this movie a big boost. They play he parts to the fullest& meanest. Unfortunately thats were it stops. Casper wants so much too be Harrison Ford, but comes up on the short end. Really short!

There is nothing scary in this except how much they borrowed from other movie themes. Can't anyone think of something original?? This guy is a archaeologist...and wants to throw the other team off the track of the find...so he plants a artifact in loose sand, and expects the other team to fall for it....Idiot! They also find King Tut's tomb under like 5 inches of sand...WOW...that was hard!  This movie is very well written...for a High School kid...actually, I take that back, as my daughter (16) and I were laughing through the whole thing.  Very silly movie. If you take it seriously, as a horror movie, you will be dissapointed.
