424726,A10NKOMJ8D2OBC,6304479786,Ivan Closhnovitz XVIII,"[5, 8]","Elvis is ultra-hip in this, one of the last of his long list of mondo-60's cheesy celluloid musical romps. This film makes an attempt to be a departure from the more family-oriented technicolor Elvis movies of the mid and early 60s and tries to offer up a more adult story line. The King is a swinging freelance photographer cruising the streets of L.A., in his dune buggy,  from downtown to the beaches of Malibu in search of subjects for his camera. This Elvis character is an avowed bachelor and ladies man (as are most of Elvis's characters) who freely and openly drinks, says ""damn"" and ""hell"" several times throughout the movie, does photo shoots of nude girls for men's magazines and is a devotee of the free love movement. He is forced, against his will, to shack up in a Malibu beach house with his leading lady and her enormous Great Dane Albert, after she drugs him with hallucinogens of some type (the insinuation is that it's LSD, as he goes on a colorful mindtrip resembling a bad fever dream)and he goes into a three day coma that results in him losing his job at the local newspaper. The rest of the movie centers around him trying to get his life back together as he manages to hoodwink two magazine publishers into hiring him as their exclusive in house photographer and tries to get away from the creepy girl and her big dog, as she continually insinuates herself back into his life. As crazy as it all sounds and as incongrouros and cheesy as it really is, there's something extremely cool about Elvis in this movie. It just goes to prove that Elvis was so cool, you could have stood him on a pile of horse dung and he would still look cool. The highlight of the movie is the pool party scene in which the King offers up his original performance of the now-popular ""A Little Less Conversation"" immortalized with the charttopping remix a few years back and in ""Oceans 11"".",3,Cheesy but cool!,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,1891,"['Elvis', 'ultra-hip', 'one', 'last', 'long', 'list', 'mondo-60', 'cheesy', 'celluloid', 'musical', 'romps', 'film', 'attempt', 'be', 'departure', 'more', 'family-oriented', 'technicolor', 'Elvis', 'movies', 'mid', 'early', '60s', 'tries', 'offer', 'up', 'more', 'adult', 'story', 'line', 'King', 'swinging', 'freelance', 'photographer', 'cruising', 'streets', 'L.A.', 'dune', 'buggy', 'downtown', 'beaches', 'Malibu', 'search', 'subjects', 'camera', 'Elvis', 'character', 'avowed', 'bachelor', 'ladies', 'man', 'are', 'most', 'Elvis', 'characters', 'who', 'freely', 'openly', 'drinks', 'damn', 'hell', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'photo', 'shoots', 'nude', 'girls', 'men', 'magazines', 'devotee', 'free', 'love', 'movement', 'forced', 'will', 'shack', 'up', 'Malibu', 'beach', 'house', 'leading', 'lady', 'enormous', 'Great', 'Dane', 'Albert', 'drugs', 'hallucinogens', 'type', 'insinuation', 'LSD', 'colorful', 'mindtrip', 'resembling', 'bad', 'fever', 'dream', 'three', 'day', 'coma', 'results', 'losing', 'job', 'local', 'newspaper', 'rest', 'movie', 'centers', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'hoodwink', 'two', 'magazine', 'publishers', 'hiring', 'exclusive', 'house', 'photographer', 'tries', 'get', 'away', 'creepy', 'girl', 'big', 'dog', 'continually', 'back', 'life', 'As', 'crazy', 'sounds', 'incongrouros', 'cheesy', 'really', 'something', 'extremely', 'cool', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'just', 'prove', 'Elvis', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'pile', 'horse', 'dung', 'would', 'still', 'look', 'cool', 'highlight', 'movie', 'pool', 'party', 'scene', 'King', 'up', 'original', 'performance', 'now-popular', 'A', 'Little', 'Less', 'Conversation', 'immortalized', 'charttopping', 'remix', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Oceans', '11']",Live a Little Love a Little VHS
424727,A240QB45BSMDAN,6304479786,Josh P.,"[5, 7]","""Live A Little, Love A Little"" is as close to '60s themed as it can get. This picture finds Elvis juggling between two magzine photographer jobs, and it looks sort of compliacted. He takes his leisure time out especially later for girls and Michele Cary. This film is a little cautionary to younger viewers. ""Live A Little, Love A Little"" focuses more on sex and tries to keep up with the ever-changing times. ""Live A Little, Love A Little"" features the low ""Edge Of Reality"" sequence which is very psychadelic in a sense, and ""A Little Less Conversation"" which became a hit this summer.

For some reason I didn't rent this one till recently- I think it's because I had it confused with ""The Trouble With Girls"", which I have no desire to see. Anyway, we rented this because we saw it had ""A Little Less Conversation"" in it and liked it so much we ended up buying it.Elvis plays Greg Nolan, a photographer who..ok, there's not much of a plot to describe here. The storyline consists of a girl he meets who keeps changing her name (Bernice/Betty/Suzie/Alice) and personality, spending most of the movie alternately messing with Elvis' mind and coming on to him. Meanwhile, Elvis gets two jobs for girlie-type magazines in the same building- one of them is called ""Classic Cat Magazine"" (or maybe it's Classy Cat) being a photographer and pretends at both that he only works for that magazine, while he literally runs back and forth between the two jobs, changing clothes and trying not to have one boss find out about the other. Red West makes his usual cameo as a guy in a fight scene who Elvis ends up [fighting] (always fun to watch).This is a pretty fun Elvis movie, and since it was filmed in '68, right around the time Elvis did the comeback special, the King was in great shape, looking pretty sharp with his sideburns and tan. He also looks like he's having fun, and doesn't feel too stupid. ""Spinout"" is entertaining, but half the time Elvis looks pretty unhappy. One of my Elvis trivia-type books said this movie has the distinction of being the only one he ever has sex in (offscreen, of course) but I think the only way you could tell this is by him waking up in a girl's bed. His co-star, who looks like a cross between Sharon Tate and how Liz Taylor looked in the 60's, was kind of annoying (though not as bad as some of the actresses he's worked with, and at least she has a great wardrobe.) It was mainly the fact that she had this kind of whispery voice like Taylor. The clothes and hair are all really cool.There are only 4 songs in the movie, but two of them are especially good. I loved ""The Edge of Reality""-Elvis has this trippy dream because Bernice/Betty/Suzie/Alice has been messing with his mind so much. The song is great, and Elvis wears this tailored set of pajamas that look more like a blue sharkskin suit. I think whoever designed and choreographed the dream sequence might have paid a little visit to Dr. Nick's, if you know what I mean, but it's pretty cool. The highlight of the movie for me was definitely ""A Little Less Conversation"", which Elvis sings to a hot babe at a swinging cocktail party as he's getting her to leave with him. Watch for the male red-haired go-go dancer that they pass who dances so furiously and wildly that his gyrations actually make him upstage Elvis for a few seconds, which is no small feat. As he and the chick are leaving, they pass other go-go dancers, saunter out the door of the cool 60's pad, and hop in Elvis' Cadillac that the valets just happened to have pulled up in front at that second, while Elvis smoothly never misses a beat and manages to make the whole thing look like he does it every night. Now THAT'S how you leave a party!One of Elvis' better flicks from the 60's, and definitely my favorite movie of his to watch from the late 60's.",5,"A little less conversation, a little more action, babe...",976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,3311,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Elvis', 'fan', '10', 'years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', '60', 'movies', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'rent', 'one', 'till', 'recently-', 'think', 'had', 'confused', 'Trouble', 'Girls', 'have', 'desire', 'see', 'Anyway', 'rented', 'saw', 'had', 'A', 'Little', 'Less', 'Conversation', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'it.Elvis', 'plays', 'Greg', 'Nolan', 'photographer', 'who..ok', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'describe', 'here', 'storyline', 'girl', 'who', 'changing', 'name', 'Bernice/Betty/Suzie/Alice', 'personality', 'spending', 'most', 'movie', 'alternately', 'messing', 'Elvis', 'mind', 'coming', 'Meanwhile', 'Elvis', 'two', 'jobs', 'girlie-type', 'magazines', 'same', 'building-', 'one', 'called', 'Classic', 'Cat', 'Magazine', 'maybe', 'Classy', 'Cat', 'being', 'photographer', 'pretends', 'only', 'magazine', 'literally', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'jobs', 'changing', 'clothes', 'trying', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'boss', 'find', 'out', 'other', 'Red', 'West', 'usual', 'cameo', 'guy', 'fight', 'scene', 'who', 'Elvis', 'up', '[', 'fighting', ']', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', '.This', 'pretty', 'fun', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', ""'68"", 'right', 'time', 'Elvis', 'did', 'comeback', 'special', 'King', 'was', 'great', 'shape', 'looking', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'sideburns', 'tan', 'also', 'having', 'fun', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'stupid', 'Spinout', 'entertaining', 'time', 'Elvis', 'pretty', 'unhappy', 'One', 'Elvis', 'trivia-type', 'books', 'said', 'movie', 'distinction', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'sex', 'offscreen', 'course', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'tell', 'waking', 'up', 'girl', 'bed', 'co-star', 'who', 'cross', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'how', 'Liz', 'Taylor', 'looked', '60', 'was', 'kind', 'annoying', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'actresses', 'worked', 'least', 'great', 'wardrobe', 'was', 'mainly', 'fact', 'had', 'kind', 'whispery', 'voice', 'Taylor', 'clothes', 'hair', 'are', 'really', 'are', 'only', '4', 'songs', 'movie', 'two', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'loved', 'Edge', 'Reality', '-Elvis', 'trippy', 'dream', 'Bernice/Betty/Suzie/Alice', 'been', 'messing', 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'song', 'great', 'Elvis', 'tailored', 'set', 'pajamas', 'look', 'more', 'blue', 'sharkskin', 'suit', 'think', 'whoever', 'designed', 'choreographed', 'dream', 'sequence', 'might', 'have', 'paid', 'little', 'visit', 'Dr.', 'Nick', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'pretty', 'cool', 'highlight', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'A', 'Little', 'Less', 'Conversation', 'Elvis', 'sings', 'hot', 'babe', 'swinging', 'cocktail', 'party', 'getting', 'leave', 'Watch', 'male', 'red-haired', 'go-go', 'dancer', 'pass', 'who', 'so', 'furiously', 'wildly', 'gyrations', 'actually', 'make', 'upstage', 'Elvis', 'few', 'seconds', 'small', 'feat', 'chick', 'are', 'leaving', 'pass', 'other', 'go-go', 'dancers', 'saunter', 'out', 'door', 'cool', '60', 'pad', 'hop', 'Elvis', 'Cadillac', 'valets', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'pulled', 'up', 'front', 'second', 'Elvis', 'smoothly', 'never', 'beat', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'look', 'night', 'Now', 'THAT', 'how', 'leave', 'party', 'One', 'Elvis', 'better', 'flicks', '60', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'movie', 'watch', 'late', '60']",Live a Little Love a Little VHS

Otherwise, it's a badly scripted romantic comedy.
