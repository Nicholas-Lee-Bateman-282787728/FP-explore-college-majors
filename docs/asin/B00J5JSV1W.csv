In sum, it is an unsuccessful blend of several genres, mainly sci-fi, action, and romance. It was either pitched to the studios as having ""a little bit of everything for everyone,"" or it was revised from a great script into what somebody at the studio thought would draw in an audience (with Depp thrown in for good measure). A little bit of everything for everyone means that very few will be fully satisfied after viewing.PROs+ brings up ponderous philosophical questions relevant to the 21st century+ Rebecca Hall was absolutely the right pick for the central character she portrays+ as you might expect, the CGI is excellentCONs- technology aside, it is one unlikely scenario after another- switches gears from philosophical sci-fi to action/adventure and back again- tries appealing to too many crowds: Jack of a few trades, master of none- what could have been a reasonable and potentially outstanding plot took too many liberties- where have I seen this before? In numerous sci-fi films of the past 32 years sinceTRON The Original Classic (1982)and even back into the 60s with2001: A Space Odyssey(1968) andAlphaville (The Criterion Collection)(1965)The defining feature of Transcendence (its redeeming quality?) is its capacity to stir the intellect. It brings up questions curious minds will latch on to, and in this respect it stands out among its peers. That said, the studio obviously didn't think you'd be clever enough to see through the film's absurdity. I suppose in an age where outlandish superhero flicks are king, it's somewhat difficult to blame the studios for accepting an ""anything goes"" attitude. Problem is, this film did not take place in a Matrix or ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.""

1695610,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B00J5JSV1W,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[1, 2]","From the trailers, critical panning and instant death at the box office, I was expecting something along the lines of Jack Sparrow meets The Lawnmower Man. With such low expectations, I was surprised at the relatively thoughtful and unusual film that unfolds, despite its many flaws and problems. It's the sort of movie that's going to leave everybody slightly unhappy from Johnny Depp fans to action movie junkies and technophiles, like it's the committee result of a great concept trying not to offend anyone.Drawing on many popular science ideas especially those in The Singularity Is Near, Transcendence is neither a technology nor an action film and treads a difficult line between technobabble and trying to engage the audience with a concept that's hard to portray on film. The lead into the topic with Depp's character getting shot by a anti-AI terrorist probably isn't the best way to get the story started and the first 20 minutes is full of voiceover and exposition just to get the thing moving. As it continues, it struggles the find the heart of a story in a compelling idea, playing more to the dramatic cords of Frankenstein's monster than  finding something new.For anyone with more of a passing interest in the transcendence idea, the leap between Depp's physical death and his conscience reemerging in a machine is horribly glossed over. It's simply assumed that once Depp has downloaded his brain and engaged in a couple of days of language training that his mind magically appears in the computer when he passes. This is a shame since perhaps the biggest question of our time gets swept under the carpet for the convenience of having enough screen time left to show the audience some neat CG tricks.On the plus side, visually it's excellent, with Pfister's background helping enormously in framing each shot. Thrown into the director's chair no doubt with Christopher Nolan's help, it would be easy to mistake this for a Nolan film from the look though the weaker storytelling belies who's calling the shots. Surprisingly the usual Nolan cast don't add much here (Rebecca Hall is flat and Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy misused). Johnny Depp is a surprisingly weak casting choice too and isn't convincing as the brilliant computer scientist behind the software.Transcendence eventually has to ditch the story of the benevolent God-like force and tread familiar territory in act 3 when Depp gets taken down. His downfall will have eyes rolling throughout the theater, especially as it starts to work in some vague environmental message way too late into the flick, and the ending will be confusing for many.

1695611,A3JBLXCH954NMV,B00J5JSV1W,"Jared M. Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[27, 32]","Transcendence is the directorial debut from acclaimed cinematographer Wally Pfister about what would happen if a human mind were to be transferred into a supercomputer, and in this case, the consciousness of Dr. Will Caster, after he is shot by a member of the radical group RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology).The film really isn't bad, and I think many mistake the bad reviews as critics actually panning the film. Most critics didn't hate the film, but the majority of them (as well as myself) hated the story's pacing and structure. The thing was, if you split the film in half, the first half jumps all over the place. Now, i wouldn't have minded this if they gave us a timeline to work with, but they didn't. They jumped a full year without even saying, and then when two years went by, they decided ""what the heck."" But, the second half was pure brilliance. It ended the way it should have, and the questions it raised were both creepy and intriguing. Now i would say the best part of the film was not the visuals, but Wally Pfister's direction. After working with Christopher Nolan for so long, I was pretty sure he picked up some tricks, and he did. His eye for visuals, the eye-popping scenery and flow of the film was grand and glorious. There's even a scene where slow motion is used on something as insignificant as a truck driving through a puddle of water, but the way it was captured, the sparkling liquid thrown into the air; breath-taking. The acting was good, but sadly nothing award-winning. Johnny Depp was good, and played his character well, going from a normal person to a lifeless AI, but in the third act, he was suddenly filled with emotion and life. Rebecca Hall was great as Will's wife, Evelyn Caster. A researcher who wanted to change the world, but is torn between caring for her husband or seeing what he's becoming. But it's Paul Bettany who steals the show as Max, Will's and Evelyn's best friend, as well as a fellow researcher. He knows there's something wrong with this ""thing"" that Will became, but he also sees his friend, and it creates a deeply personal conflict. I did a review for the musical score separately on the official page, but on other parts of the film, the cinematography was beautifully haunting (and award-worthy), the editing was good, and the visual effects were great. But, if anything in this movie were to win an award, I'd say the production deserves it, or at least a nomination. It was truly impressive, and happily not overlooked.Overall, Transcendence is a really good thriller with some very intelligent inquiries about human life and technology, but sadly due to poor pacing and structure, the film falls short from greatness. Still, a must-see; a must-own if you love Christopher Nolan's style (Pfister really brought it here). But don't let the critics keep you from seeing it, because most of them liked the movie, but despised the script.",4,"A Taut, Intelligent Thriller That Falls Short of Greatness",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,2925,"['Transcendence', 'directorial', 'debut', 'acclaimed', 'cinematographer', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'human', 'mind', 'were', 'be', 'transferred', 'supercomputer', 'case', 'consciousness', 'Dr.', 'Will', 'Caster', 'shot', 'member', 'radical', 'group', 'RIFT', 'Revolutionary', 'Independence', 'From', 'Technology', '.The', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'think', 'many', 'mistake', 'bad', 'reviews', 'critics', 'actually', 'panning', 'film', 'Most', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'majority', 'as', 'well', 'hated', 'story', 'pacing', 'structure', 'thing', 'was', 'split', 'film', 'half', 'first', 'half', 'jumps', 'place', 'Now', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'gave', 'timeline', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'jumped', 'full', 'year', 'even', 'saying', 'then', 'when', 'two', 'years', 'went', 'decided', 'what', 'heck', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'ended', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'questions', 'raised', 'were', 'creepy', 'intriguing', 'Now', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'visuals', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'direction', 'working', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'picked', 'up', 'tricks', 'did', 'eye', 'visuals', 'eye-popping', 'scenery', 'flow', 'film', 'was', 'grand', 'glorious', 'even', 'scene', 'where', 'slow', 'motion', 'used', 'something', 'as', 'insignificant', 'truck', 'driving', 'puddle', 'water', 'way', 'was', 'captured', 'sparkling', 'liquid', 'thrown', 'air', 'breath-taking', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'sadly', 'nothing', 'award-winning', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'good', 'played', 'character', 'well', 'going', 'normal', 'person', 'lifeless', 'AI', 'third', 'act', 'was', 'suddenly', 'filled', 'emotion', 'life', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'was', 'great', 'Will', 'wife', 'Evelyn', 'Caster', 'A', 'researcher', 'who', 'wanted', 'change', 'world', 'torn', 'caring', 'husband', 'seeing', 'what', 'becoming', 'Paul', 'Bettany', 'who', 'show', 'Max', 'Will', 'Evelyn', 'best', 'friend', 'as', 'well', 'fellow', 'researcher', 'something', 'wrong', 'thing', 'Will', 'became', 'also', 'friend', 'deeply', 'personal', 'conflict', 'did', 'review', 'musical', 'score', 'separately', 'official', 'page', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautifully', 'haunting', 'award-worthy', 'editing', 'was', 'good', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'anything', 'movie', 'were', 'win', 'award', ""'d"", 'say', 'production', 'least', 'nomination', 'was', 'truly', 'impressive', 'happily', 'not', 'overlooked.Overall', 'Transcendence', 'really', 'good', 'thriller', 'very', 'intelligent', 'inquiries', 'human', 'life', 'technology', 'sadly', 'due', 'poor', 'pacing', 'structure', 'film', 'short', 'greatness', 'Still', 'must-see', 'must-own', 'love', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'style', 'Pfister', 'really', 'brought', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'critics', 'keep', 'seeing', 'most', 'liked', 'movie', 'despised', 'script']",N/A

I knew it had great actors in it.  I also knew it had a sci-fi type of story.  So, we decided to check it out.It starts out interesting.  Something happens to a man that ends his life.  The lady he is with decided to put his mind into a machine.  The man, or at least his mind loose control and things start going bad.  That is it, the story as it were.Now, this could have been a very interesting movie.  But, it was not.  The way they did it, it just drug on and on.  There seemed to be so many things happening that were not important.  I do not think anything that happened had a chance to really get into your mind, before they started adding other stuff.  Maybe the things had a purpose.  They just did not get a chance to fully develop.  I kind of liked the movie.  But, when the guy started taking over peoples bodies and there voices sounded like his, on top of there mouths not even syncing right to the speech, that was it for me.  I almost asked my mom if she wanted to leave, but to much time had gone by for us to get our $16.50 back.They just took the story to far.  I mean, imagine if such a thing existed.  Your thoughts could be completely put into a machine.  Well, while the lady he was with was still in love with the man, though he now in a machine, it would simply be a machine, software or whatever else that was programmed to react to things and do things the way that man would have.  Not the man.  The fact that the system sounded like him when it talked seems a bit odd.  There is something even more ridiculous that happens later on.  It has to do with the man.

Johnny Depp plays Dr. Will Caster, a scientist interested in creating A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Before he can realize his dream, he (and a lot of other techno-philes around the nation) are brutalized in a coordinated attack by a group of Neo-Luddite terrorists who feel that human reliance on technology will naturally end with humans gone and technology left behind to reign supreme. With his life at stake, Dr. Caster's mind is downloaded into a computer (with the assistance of his wife and best friend). Now fully uploaded, Dr. Caster's consciousness expands across the globe and begins to make some amazing advancements and discoveries. But is it really Doctor Caster in that computer? Or is it something that is more mind than heart?This movie tries to ask a lot of complicated questions, but it fails to ask them very well. Filmed with an incompetent sense of dramatics, both sides of the conflict -- our grubby anti-techies and the nano-roboticized techno-hippies -- come across as equally vacuous and just as devoid of emotion. Not a whole lot of ideas are explored in the debate, either through dialogue or action, as the terrorists take it as a given that this new computer consciousness is bad, and the Computerized Caster -- a dry-as-dirt Depp shown mostly on computer screens -- takes progress and world-wide unification as a given good. There are a few tiny cases to be made on either side -- Caster develops some amazing regenerative abilities to heal both humans and the world; there is a sense (not completely explored or explained), though, that they require the sublimation of a human's personality or self -- but the movie isn't concerned about any of the fine points here. All it wants is a long, loopy plot of people versus machine, and it gives you two hours of it without once giving you any real reason to care about either side.The closest you get to a sympathetic character is Caster's wife, who rejoices through his research, struggles through his death, perseveres through his rebirth, and then agonizes through life as the wife to a computer program. She's probably the best part of this film, although she constantly seems as bewildered and unmoored as the audience. And since she's got the only emotional heartstrings worth holding onto for the movie, that means any right-thinking viewer is going to be left equally alienated by this philosophical mess of a movie. By refusing to take a stance -- heck, by refusing to even show the passionate arguments to be made on both sides of the issue, instead just showing how dehumanizing they both can be -- the movie turns the possible death and/or evolution of all of humankind into one of the most muddled and uninteresting things since jumbled software code.",2,A.I. = Artificial Intelligence or Authentic Inanity?,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,2812,"['TRANSCENDENCE', 'techno-think', 'piece', 'limits', 'technology', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dr.', 'Will', 'Caster', 'scientist', 'interested', 'creating', 'A.I', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'can', 'realize', 'dream', 'lot', 'other', 'techno-philes', 'nation', 'are', 'brutalized', 'coordinated', 'attack', 'group', 'Neo-Luddite', 'terrorists', 'who', 'feel', 'human', 'reliance', 'technology', 'will', 'naturally', 'end', 'humans', 'gone', 'technology', 'left', 'reign', 'supreme', 'life', 'stake', 'Dr.', 'Caster', 'mind', 'downloaded', 'computer', 'assistance', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'Now', 'fully', 'uploaded', 'Dr.', 'Caster', 'consciousness', 'globe', 'make', 'amazing', 'advancements', 'discoveries', 'really', 'Doctor', 'Caster', 'computer', 'something', 'more', 'mind', 'heart', 'movie', 'ask', 'lot', 'complicated', 'questions', 'ask', 'very', 'well', 'Filmed', 'incompetent', 'sense', 'dramatics', 'sides', 'conflict', 'grubby', 'anti-techies', 'nano-roboticized', 'techno-hippies', 'come', 'equally', 'vacuous', 'just', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'Not', 'whole', 'lot', 'ideas', 'are', 'explored', 'debate', 'dialogue', 'action', 'terrorists', 'take', 'given', 'new', 'computer', 'consciousness', 'bad', 'Computerized', 'Caster', 'dry-as-dirt', 'Depp', 'shown', 'mostly', 'computer', 'screens', 'progress', 'world-wide', 'unification', 'given', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'tiny', 'cases', 'be', 'made', 'side', 'Caster', 'amazing', 'regenerative', 'abilities', 'heal', 'humans', 'world', 'sense', 'not', 'completely', 'explored', 'explained', 'though', 'require', 'sublimation', 'human', 'personality', 'self', 'movie', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'fine', 'points', 'here', 'long', 'loopy', 'plot', 'people', 'versus', 'machine', 'two', 'hours', 'once', 'giving', 'real', 'reason', 'care', 'side.The', 'closest', 'get', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Caster', 'wife', 'who', 'research', 'death', 'rebirth', 'then', 'through', 'life', 'wife', 'computer', 'program', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'constantly', 'bewildered', 'unmoored', 'audience', 'got', 'only', 'emotional', 'heartstrings', 'holding', 'movie', 'right-thinking', 'viewer', 'going', 'be', 'left', 'equally', 'alienated', 'philosophical', 'mess', 'movie', 'refusing', 'take', 'stance', 'heck', 'refusing', 'even', 'show', 'passionate', 'arguments', 'be', 'made', 'sides', 'issue', 'instead', 'just', 'showing', 'how', 'dehumanizing', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'possible', 'death', 'and/or', 'evolution', 'humankind', 'one', 'most', 'muddled', 'uninteresting', 'things', 'jumbled', 'software', 'code']",N/A

1695625,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00J5JSV1W,M. Oleson,"[4, 6]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.My teenage son, also a lover of movies, was bugging me to go with him to see this purported sci-fi thriller the week-end it opened. Events precluded that from happening but I finally gave in and off we went the next week. Something about the trailer, which I had seen numerous times, just put me off.After seeing it, I think it was the Johnny Depp out of his comfort zone playing a brilliant researcher on the cutting edge of sentient science. My son, with his high expectations was disappointed. I, with my initial misgivings combined with poor reviews, was pleasantly surprised. Well pleasantly is perhaps too strong a word. I thought the film was pretty much OK, even if I shared my son's opinion that the film often dragged. It did and I believe first time director, Wally Pfister, just went overboard loading up the film with gobs of techno-babble.My biggest issue however had to do with the illogical time jumps. After Will Castor (Depp) is shot by a member of a secret group of anti-artificial intelligence activists, his consciousness is uploaded into a giant computer that he created with the help of his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and his best friend, Max Waters (Paul Bettany). So here's what I don't get. Will's body is turned to ash and his now widow is in charge of the company. She goes off the grid and relocates to some broken down town in the desert. Her company gets flush with cash thanks to Will's brain hacking into the stock market. She uses the money to convert the town into a huge underground laboratory. This all happens over two years and yet no one can figure out where she went. Huh? And the logistics of the construction is, well, illogical.Putting that aside, Max is kidnapped by the A-I terrorists and over time converts to their way of thinking. Without the terrorist aspect. Putting logic aside, I found the film titillating in the ideas being offered. Certainly not anything necessarily new, the ideas of the human brain merging with a computer is always interesting. Aside from Depp, the acting is very good as is the photography. And some of the special effects were mind boggling. If the subject matter interests you, it's worth a look.",3,3 1/2 stars.

Having said that Transcendence is a very boring movie even for me and I am a hardcore Sci-Fi fan. I must say the premise is semi-ludicrous mainly because once a mind evolves that far it certainly wouldn't be looking to kill off the human species as these paranoid nut jobs in the film believe. Infact he explains clearly what he was doing and why, attempting to clean the junk humanity left (waste, pollution, etc.) because his wife wanted the Earth to be healthy again. It just so happens that nobody bothers to ask him what his main goals are and even spend a brief time talking with him, they condemn him on fear alone.Personally I see no reason everyone should've feared him except that maybe they were jealous or control freaks. As the story progresses we learn what sort of bored radicalists these people are and it's laughable. They have no real lives or anything meaningful to contribute to society so go chasing down phantom ideas and worries all to cause harm. I really disliked them as you can tell!In the end I think he and his wife lived on in the garden somehow but I am unsure. Also it needs to be mentioned at that point the nanites could've just spread his consciousness over the entire planet they shouldn't have needed a main power station or anything else, they could just replicate endlessly and draw solar/organic power. Hence a huge hole in the plot IMO along with 1 virus shutting down the entire internet which is IMPOSSIBLE. I am actually glad his wife dies because she was annoying beyond belief and caused him to give up on helping the Earth and humanity because she was a worry wort.

This is the most under-rated movie I am aware of ... I suspect it will become a quiet cult classic and I look forward to watching it again.After watching the movie, I read a handful of critical reviews to see what the problems were.  Mostly, critics panned ""plot holes"" and ""logical errors,"" but every specific complaint I read was actually addressed within the movie.  (Explicitly even, through dialogue.)I suspect the problem is this: the movie is a slow-burn drama and open to several channels of interpretation.  One of the central questions of the story is whether or not Dr. Caster was successfully ""uploaded,"" or if the machine is something else altogether.  The movie provides a couple of suggestions, and it does favor one over the other, but it allows you to draw your own conclusions.Such is the nature of a lot of the plot points.  You get to decide who the villains are and who the good guys are (if there are any).  You get to decide how a machine can (or can't) reconcile love.  You get to decide the meaning of the ""religious"" imagery that enters the movie partway through.  The film is brilliantly nuanced, and it seems to have compelling arguments for both sides on pretty much every issue it presents -- which bothered a lot of the people in the theatre.  My interpretation of the movie was satisfying, yours may not be.  I've read a lot of comments on the internet as to why someone hated the ""message"" or the ""plot"" and almost every single time I find myself thinking, ""But that's not the way I saw it.""Even if you go into this movie not caring so much about the philosophical aspects, it functions as a beautiful, yet oh-so-messed-up, love story that brought a tear to my eyes.The movie does have a couple of failings ... there are exactly two moments that come across as cheesy.  One of these moments is at the beginning (this won't spoil anything): a student asks Dr. Caster if he's basically trying to create his own ""god"" through technology.  The line itself was a bit cheesy, but the acting was so over-the-top, I don't understand why the studio didn't mandate a re-shoot.Some of the technology may seem a bit ""fantastic"" to those who have never picked up the tech section of the New York Times, and I'm hoping that a second viewing will answer a question I had about the nature of an injection that happens in the third act of the film.  Be warned: this is NOT an action film, and you will have to pay attention to the dialogue and form your own opinions as you go along to have a pleasant viewing experience.  Even then, your opinions will be continually challenged, and it's a fun back-and-forth if you like that sort of thing.  (I do.)UPDATE: The quality of the Blu-Ray itself is a disappointment.  It appears they've applied a fair amount of DNR to the image, which *does* affect the level of detail, contrary to what you may read elsewhere.  It's especially disappointing, because the detail and grain were part of what made the image so intriguing in theatres.The audio mix is excellent, so no complaints there.  But the special features are essentially non-existent -- you'll get through everything in 15 minutes.  (Literally.)  The ""viral"" videos are included, which is nice.  A commentary with the writer would have been a fantastic addition, but I suppose you can't fault Warner for not wanting to spend time/money on a film that flopped in the box office.With that in mind, I'll step down the recommendation to ""worth a buy, but make sure you get a good price for it.""",4,Give it a shot if you like idea-oriented science fiction,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,3628,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'probably', 'skipped', 'theaters', 'wonder', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'most', 'under-rated', 'movie', 'am', 'aware', 'suspect', 'will', 'become', 'quiet', 'cult', 'classic', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'again.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'read', 'handful', 'critical', 'reviews', 'see', 'what', 'problems', 'were', 'Mostly', 'critics', 'panned', 'plot', 'holes', 'logical', 'errors', 'specific', 'complaint', 'read', 'was', 'actually', 'addressed', 'movie', 'Explicitly', 'even', 'dialogue', 'suspect', 'problem', 'movie', 'slow-burn', 'drama', 'open', 'several', 'channels', 'interpretation', 'One', 'central', 'questions', 'story', 'not', 'Dr.', 'Caster', 'was', 'successfully', 'uploaded', 'machine', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'movie', 'couple', 'suggestions', 'favor', 'one', 'other', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.Such', 'nature', 'lot', 'plot', 'points', 'get', 'decide', 'who', 'villains', 'are', 'who', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'are', 'get', 'decide', 'how', 'machine', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reconcile', 'love', 'get', 'decide', 'meaning', 'religious', 'imagery', 'movie', 'partway', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'nuanced', 'have', 'compelling', 'arguments', 'sides', 'pretty', 'much', 'issue', 'bothered', 'lot', 'people', 'theatre', 'interpretation', 'movie', 'was', 'satisfying', 'yours', 'may', 'not', 'be', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'comments', 'internet', 'why', 'someone', 'hated', 'message', 'plot', 'almost', 'single', 'time', 'find', 'thinking', 'not', 'way', 'saw', 'Even', 'go', 'movie', 'not', 'caring', 'so', 'much', 'philosophical', 'aspects', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'oh-so-messed-up', 'love', 'story', 'brought', 'tear', 'eyes.The', 'movie', 'have', 'couple', 'failings', 'are', 'exactly', 'two', 'moments', 'come', 'cheesy', 'One', 'moments', 'beginning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'student', 'Dr.', 'Caster', 'basically', 'trying', 'create', 'own', 'god', 'technology', 'line', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'mandate', 're-shoot.Some', 'technology', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'fantastic', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'picked', 'up', 'tech', 'section', 'New', 'York', 'Times', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'second', 'viewing', 'will', 'answer', 'question', 'had', 'nature', 'injection', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'Be', 'warned', 'NOT', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'go', 'along', 'have', 'pleasant', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Even', 'then', 'opinions', 'will', 'be', 'continually', 'challenged', 'fun', 'back-and-forth', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'do', 'UPDATE', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'disappointment', ""'ve"", 'applied', 'fair', 'amount', 'DNR', 'image', '*does*', 'affect', 'level', 'detail', 'contrary', 'what', 'may', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'especially', 'disappointing', 'detail', 'grain', 'were', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'image', 'so', 'intriguing', 'theatres.The', 'audio', 'mix', 'excellent', 'complaints', 'there', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'essentially', 'non-existent', ""'ll"", 'get', 'everything', '15', 'minutes', 'Literally', 'viral', 'videos', 'are', 'included', 'nice', 'commentary', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'addition', 'suppose', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Warner', 'not', 'wanting', 'spend', 'time/money', 'film', 'flopped', 'box', 'office.With', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'step', 'down', 'recommendation', 'worth', 'buy', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'good', 'price']",N/A

Not only that, but a human in digital form could theoretically process information at the same speed as the fastest computers, plus utilize human-style reasoning and problem-solving skills - which computers have not previously achieved. The inevitable and shockingly fast jumps in technologies, including physical human evolution - and the fears and doubts that accompany it - are explored emotionally and intellectually with engaging performances by the actors. The performance that stands out most in my mind is that of Rebecca Hall who plays Evelyn, the wife of main character, Will (Johnny Depp's character). It was easy to feel what seemed like her genuine emotions - conflict, relief, love, grief, fear, uncertainty - you name it. Her performance reminds me of the enthralling work of Olivia Williams as Anna in The Sixth Sense.

The poor script - specifically its free-floating cardboard cut-out characters - proves to be the movie's main problem. The script also fails in terms of conveying the science involved.  Scientist characters say stuff that sounds-like-science but is actually really dumb (if you known anything about science). The script gives no one - not the scientists, the lone FBI guy, or the terrorists - any real believability.  These are all supposed to be intelligent highly educated people, driven by passions and ideas.  Pitted against a super-intelligent AI. Instead we get a script that seems like some third-rate romance writer's idea of a thriller, but put on the screen at the cost of $100m. Everything is made to come a poor third to the central love story, with the huge cracks in the science pasted over with the occasional nice special effect and some mumbo-jumbo dialogue.  It's just about bearable until half way through.  Then the movie just gets really silly, and it tails off into a ludicrous and disappointing ending.  Maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe all the movie-going public wants is a rather crude mix of three ideas vaguely explained in 'pop science' terms, and predictably presented in the context of a fairly standard-issue love story. But I don't believe that - there's now a proven and huge market for really intelligent and challenging movies. This certainly isn't one of those movies, and doesn't even come close to its obvious inspirations (2001 and Contact).  The central actors all do their job well, the set design and lighting is strong, the cinematography and sound is all workmanlike.  The music stays well in the background, but does its job.  But the weak script, with its uniformly wooden characterisation and its dumb science, just drags the whole movie down.",2,"Looks great, but let down by a poor script",1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,1951,"['Transcendence', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'seeing', 'discounted', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'should', 'expect', 'fairly', 'low-key', 'movie', 'rather', 'blockbuster', 'poor', 'script', 'specifically', 'free-floating', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'characters', 'be', 'movie', 'main', 'problem', 'script', 'also', 'terms', 'conveying', 'science', 'involved', 'Scientist', 'characters', 'say', 'stuff', 'sounds-like-science', 'actually', 'really', 'dumb', 'known', 'anything', 'science', 'script', 'one', 'not', 'scientists', 'lone', 'FBI', 'guy', 'terrorists', 'real', 'believability', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'intelligent', 'highly', 'educated', 'people', 'driven', 'passions', 'ideas', 'Pitted', 'super-intelligent', 'AI', 'Instead', 'get', 'script', 'third-rate', 'romance', 'writer', 'idea', 'thriller', 'put', 'screen', 'cost', '100m', 'Everything', 'made', 'come', 'poor', 'third', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'huge', 'cracks', 'science', 'pasted', 'occasional', 'nice', 'special', 'effect', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'dialogue', 'just', 'about', 'bearable', 'half', 'way', 'Then', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'silly', 'off', 'ludicrous', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Maybe', 'movie-going', 'public', 'rather', 'crude', 'mix', 'three', 'ideas', 'vaguely', 'explained', ""'pop"", 'science', 'terms', 'predictably', 'presented', 'context', 'fairly', 'standard-issue', 'love', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'now', 'proven', 'huge', 'market', 'really', 'intelligent', 'challenging', 'movies', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'one', 'movies', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'obvious', 'inspirations', '2001', 'Contact', 'central', 'actors', 'do', 'job', 'well', 'set', 'design', 'lighting', 'strong', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'workmanlike', 'music', 'well', 'background', 'job', 'weak', 'script', 'uniformly', 'wooden', 'characterisation', 'dumb', 'science', 'just', 'drags', 'whole', 'movie', 'down']",N/A

Will connects to the Internet and unlocks secrets of nanotechnology.

What are the limits we will allow robots to control our lives?The film utilizes nanotechnology, perhaps beyond its limits.
