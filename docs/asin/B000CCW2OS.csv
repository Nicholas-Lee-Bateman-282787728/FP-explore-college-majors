956733,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000CCW2OS,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a naughty party girl. We first meet her when she's throwing up in the rest room of a nightclub, a young hunk hovering over her in disgust. Insecure and neglected, she's been coasting through life basically on her looks. But time is steadily catching up with her; she can no longer rely on her tarty beauty and her ability to beguile men as much as she used to.Her more introverted sister Rose (Toni Collette) is Maggie's mirror opposite: She's superficially a mess - a slightly overweight workaholic who settles for finding love in the pages of romance novels. She buys shoes because they are the only item of clothing that fits her properly, and marvels at her handsome boss' presence in her bed, even taking a photo of him to prove that he is actually there.Both these sisters are insecure, but in different ways and about different things. With Maggie passed out drunk, Rose needs to come pick her up. When she tries to take Maggie back to their father's house, however, she's barred at the door by their evil stepmother, who insists Rose take her sister home with her. Maggie steals from and betrays Rose, she helps herself to her sister's expensive shoes, ice cream, and other stuff that she knows she's no supposed to take.Rose is obviously angry with her sister's laziness and lack of ambition, yet she is reluctant to evict her, when Maggie betrays Rose in a moment of thoughtlessness, a gigantic rift is caused between them. Finally evicted, she boards a bus to Florida without a word to anyone, hooking up with her long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine). Ella helps Maggie get back on track, finding her a job as a hospice worker and helping her start a business as a personal shopper for the assisted-living set. Rose meanwhile comes to terms with her insecurities by quitting her job and becoming a part-time dog walker and even gaining a new boyfriend (Mark Feuerstein) in the process.In Her Shoes is all about the ups and downs of sibling love between injured and self-doubting opposites. And while this issue has obviously been movingly explored in other movies, rarely has it been tackled with such emotional honesty. Although In her Shoes may be earnest, and contemporary, and it certainly highlights the needs and insecurities of women; the film is not that ironical - apart from the fact that Maggie and Rose are apprehensive about different things, and it's interestingly un-cynical; there's definitely no room for cutting-edge, or clever hipness in director Curtis Hanson's world.Instead we have a heart felt and well acted drama that is more interested in flirting around the mysteries of a love-hate relationship and selling the message of the importance of family and that everything's probably going to turn out alright in the end. For Rose, salvation and deliverance comes in the form of exotic food and a man who disregards her propensity to put on the pounds and can finally love her for whom she is, and for Maggie it comes in the form of newly found confidence, insight, responsibity, and even poetry!The acting is generally top-notch, with the incredible Ms. Collette, with her horsy laugh and wide, puppy dog eyes proving that she's one of the most versatile actors around. And Shirley MacLaine does a nicely understated turn as Grandma Ella, but it is Cameron Diaz who is the real find here, giving one of her best performances in years as the irresponsible, good for nothing vamp Maggie.In Her Shoes lacks originality and is fairly formulaic fare, but it builds to a surprising level of emotional power, and makes up for its shortcomings with its understated intelligence, sensitivity and finely attuned sense of character. Hanson is a restrained but confident director who knows that an audience will remain engaged to a story, no matter how prescribed, as long as people they care about populate it.

If it had stuck to the formula of being a comedy about two very different sisters, the result would have fallen flat.  To the extent that it also makes a careful study of human relations and how the generations can and do drift apart, the film rises above the dreary and pursues a path less travelled.The two sisters are played by Toni Collette as the stuffy and less than beautiful one and Cameron Diaz as the ditzy blonde.  Their differences only serve to antagonise the other.  Indeed, the differences do ultimately reach breaking point and they go their separate ways.  Their eventual reconciliation is touching.

956739,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000CCW2OS,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","It may seem on the outset to be nothing more than another chick-flick, but `In Her Shoes' is not only smart and entertaining but it's complex in many ways.  It tells us the story of two very different sisters, Maggie and Rose, who love one another deeply despite the fact that they rarely get along.  Rose is the successful `plain looking' one who can never seem to find the right man and Maggie is the unstable `pretty' one who bounces from one man to the next.  After an explosive argument where each party says things they really don't mean the two girls separate, disbanding their relationship.The beauty of `In Her Shoes' is that it delicately and affectionately relates each girls side of the story.  While Rose is successful in her own way she wishes she had half of the gusto and spunk her sister Maggie possessed, and while Maggie may have a way with people, she lacks self confidence in her own abilities.  She gives herself away because she doesn't realize she deserves more than that.  Rose thinks that she is ugly, Maggie thinks that she is stupid; both girls pick themselves apart yet find a way to blame their own insecurities on their sister.As the film progresses; Maggie moving in with their estranged Grandmother Ella, Rose actually finding a man who loves her for who she is; it continues to grab us and connect to us.  It never falls apart or dives into overly sympathetic or in other words `pathetic' territory.  Sure, it grabs at your heartstrings and may even bring a tear or two to your eyes but its all legitimate emotions.The acting is particularly splendid here as well.  Toni Collette is always a delight (how is it again that she has but ONE Oscar nomination) and here she is flawlessly on point.  She really helps the audience to understand Rose.  Shirley MacLaine proves yet again that her talent is never-ending.  As Ella she is moving and affectionate and truly outstanding.  To me though, this movie belongs to Cameron Diaz.  I'm really dying to see this girl fully embraced by the awards circuit.  I don't understand how she has gone this long without a single Oscar nomination.  As Maggie she really fleshes out this girl's strengths and weaknesses.  She makes her three dimensional, relatable and sympathetic.  The scene where she auditions for MTV alone made me cry; it's so real and raw and believable.In the end `In Her Shoes' is well worth the time.  It's an elevated chick-flick with heart and soul; a film that really understands what it's aiming for and truly delivers in the end.  It's not what I was expecting and I'm sure you'll get more than you bargained for as well.  Director Curtis Hanson has a nice way of approaching his projects, and while `In Her Shoes' is a far cry from Hanson's Oscar winning `L.A. Confidential' it has a level of maturity we've come to expect from a man who continues to hand us cinematic gems.",4,These shoes fit just fine...,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,2871,"['may', 'seem', 'outset', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'chick-flick', 'Shoes', 'not', 'only', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'complex', 'many', 'ways', 'story', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'sisters', 'Maggie', 'Rose', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'deeply', 'fact', 'rarely', 'get', 'along', 'Rose', 'successful', 'plain', 'looking', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'find', 'right', 'man', 'Maggie', 'unstable', 'pretty', 'one', 'who', 'one', 'man', 'next', 'explosive', 'argument', 'where', 'party', 'things', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'two', 'girls', 'separate', 'disbanding', 'relationship.The', 'beauty', 'Shoes', 'delicately', 'affectionately', 'girls', 'side', 'story', 'Rose', 'successful', 'own', 'way', 'had', 'half', 'gusto', 'spunk', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'possessed', 'Maggie', 'may', 'have', 'way', 'people', 'confidence', 'own', 'abilities', 'away', ""n't"", 'realize', 'more', 'Rose', 'thinks', 'ugly', 'Maggie', 'stupid', 'girls', 'pick', 'apart', 'yet', 'find', 'way', 'blame', 'own', 'insecurities', 'sister.As', 'film', 'Maggie', 'moving', 'estranged', 'Grandmother', 'Ella', 'Rose', 'actually', 'finding', 'man', 'who', 'who', 'grab', 'connect', 'never', 'apart', 'overly', 'sympathetic', 'other', 'words', 'pathetic', 'territory', 'Sure', 'heartstrings', 'may', 'even', 'bring', 'tear', 'two', 'eyes', 'legitimate', 'emotions.The', 'acting', 'particularly', 'splendid', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'always', 'delight', 'how', 'again', 'ONE', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'here', 'flawlessly', 'point', 'really', 'audience', 'understand', 'Rose', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'yet', 'again', 'talent', 'never-ending', 'Ella', 'moving', 'affectionate', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', ""'m"", 'really', 'dying', 'see', 'girl', 'fully', 'embraced', 'awards', 'circuit', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'gone', 'long', 'single', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Maggie', 'really', 'out', 'girl', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'three', 'dimensional', 'relatable', 'sympathetic', 'scene', 'where', 'MTV', 'alone', 'made', 'cry', 'so', 'real', 'raw', 'end', 'Shoes', 'well', 'time', 'elevated', 'chick-flick', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'aiming', 'truly', 'delivers', 'end', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'as', 'well', 'Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'nice', 'way', 'approaching', 'projects', 'Shoes', 'far', 'cry', 'Hanson', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'level', 'maturity', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'man', 'who', 'hand', 'cinematic', 'gems']",N/A

However, this evening it was the only thing available so I decided to get it, figuring that at least Cameron Diaz is hot, and I'm glad I did.  The script is excellent.  An interesting drama with interesting characters, but with comedy moments that really bring laughs.  Complimenting the great story are the performances...they are superb.  Shirley Maclaine has been playing goofy stereotypical characters for quite awhile now, so it's nice to see her in a movie where she is playing a ""real"" person, and she does it very effectively.  Toni Collette is great as the ugly sister and surprisingly, Cameron Diaz is not only hot as the pretty sister, but she turns in a very strong performance too.  I was totally engrossed in the story because the performances were that good.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought the movie was just a little too long.  I think they could have trimmed some fat and had just as good a movie.  One more thing: much of the movie was shot in a retirement community in Florida.

And I would like to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how charming this movie was.It is the story of two sisters. Cameron Diaz plays the spunky getting-drunk-sex-in-the-bathroom sister. While Toni Colette plays the plain jane successful sibling. Sounds like a over-used plot, right ?It is indeed so. But this movie is evidence that in the hands of a good director even the simplest of plotlines can produce standout movies. Curtis Hanson (""8 Mile"" , ""LA Confidential"") does a superlative job of ensuring that the movie doesn't walk the cliched lines (pun intended).One of the best scenes in the movie, is when a blind professor gets the slightly dyslexic Diaz to read a beautiful poem by Elizabeth Bishop and explain what it means. The beautiful way in which he prods and coaxes Diaz into doing this, goes to show the amount of skill and patience required for teaching.Most people would be quick to label this as a chick flick. Well, if having two female leads makes a movie a chick flick, so be it.

So there were several things about the movie that  bothered me.Toni Collette is much too polite as Rose when she's kicking Maggie out of the apartment, although that's probably partly the fault of the scriptwriter, who drastically cut what Rose actually said at this point, and made it much more politically correct.  This was where I wanted to hear Rose vent a lifetime's worth of resentment and anger, just as she did in the novel. Plus, they left out the bit about the shoes at this point, which injected a note of humor even into this most fraught part of the book.  Plus this skewed the balance between the two characters.  Although, somehow, in the movie version of anything, it always ends up being about whoever is the most photogenic.  Not so in the book, which is really about both sisters equally.But my main problem with this movie is, where are all the Jews?  Somehow we're supposed to believe that Cameron Diaz (who despite her name, actually looks Swedish), Shirley MacClaine, and Ken Howard are all Jewish.  I think Toni Collette does the best job of seeming Jewish, and of the actors playing major characters, I think Mark Feuerstein is the only one who actually IS Jewish. The rest of them don't quite manage it--I got no sense that these other actors either grew up speaking Yiddish (for the ones of the appropriate ages for this) or had immediate ancestors who did, that they felt the wrench of being automatic aliens because they practice a different religion than most of the rest of the country, or the automatic constant second-guessing of oneself that comes with a religious tradition entirely based on the Golden Rule.Gotta have that yiddishe kvetch. . .",3,Yiddishe kvetch. . .,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,1877,"['whole', 'pretty', 'good', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'often', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'novels', 'simply', 'reader', 'control', 'reading', 'least', 'one', 'hear', 'head', 'were', 'several', 'things', 'movie', 'bothered', 'me.Toni', 'Collette', 'much', 'too', 'polite', 'Rose', 'when', 'kicking', 'Maggie', 'apartment', 'probably', 'partly', 'fault', 'scriptwriter', 'who', 'drastically', 'cut', 'what', 'Rose', 'actually', 'said', 'point', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'politically', 'correct', 'was', 'where', 'wanted', 'hear', 'Rose', 'vent', 'lifetime', 'worth', 'resentment', 'anger', 'just', 'did', 'novel', 'left', 'out', 'bit', 'shoes', 'point', 'injected', 'note', 'humor', 'even', 'most', 'fraught', 'part', 'book', 'skewed', 'balance', 'two', 'characters', 'somehow', 'movie', 'version', 'anything', 'always', 'up', 'being', 'whoever', 'most', 'photogenic', 'Not', 'so', 'book', 'really', 'sisters', 'equally.But', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'where', 'are', 'Jews', 'Somehow', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'name', 'actually', 'Swedish', 'Shirley', 'MacClaine', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'are', 'Jewish', 'think', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'best', 'job', 'seeming', 'Jewish', 'actors', 'playing', 'major', 'characters', 'think', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'IS', 'Jewish', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'got', 'sense', 'other', 'actors', 'grew', 'up', 'speaking', 'Yiddish', 'ones', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'had', 'immediate', 'ancestors', 'who', 'did', 'felt', 'wrench', 'being', 'automatic', 'aliens', 'practice', 'different', 'religion', 'most', 'rest', 'country', 'automatic', 'constant', 'second-guessing', 'oneself', 'religious', 'tradition', 'entirely', 'based', 'Golden', 'Rule.', 'Got', 'ta', 'have', 'yiddishe', 'kvetch']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","For those who've read any of my previous film reviews, you probably know that dysfunctional family stories aren't my favorite genre. They tend to be too psychologically dark if not downright depressing (THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is a prime example). I don't mind dark themes; in fact, I enjoy them, but they need to have more substance than just dark qualities. There needs to be character studies that go deep and delve into people as a whole, not just their black side. And that's why IN HER SHOES works ...Some might see this as a chick flick, but it isn't. Although all of the prime players are women, they just as easily could've been men (brothers and a grandfather). But here, it just happens to be strong female leads that pull us into the story. The premise is simple: two grown-up sisters (played by Toni Collette and Cameron Diaz) are at odds with each other. One is a responsible attorney while the other remains a sexy playgirl, and a damaging evening involving one of their boyfriends rips them apart. But as time goes by, both learn that being the ""other"" sister isn't such a bad thing; they are both equal parts of the other, and this comes into focus when they learn the truth about their mother's death and discover that they still have a living grandmother (the excellent Shirley MacLain).Tears and laughter are mixed throughout the film as we learn more and more about this wily family and how one sister's shoes (both figuratively and literally) might well fit the other ...and vice versa. The title of the movie is absolutely perfect in that we see early on Toni Collette's character's affinity for footwear and how the sisters fight over shoes and life, and how sometimes life doesn't always nuzzle-up to us in a comfortable way but shoes (family/sisters) always do.This is an excellent film to cozy up with next to your favorite (or embittered) sibling and take a voyage of discovery down Family Lane.",4,Don't You Wish That Family Always Fit As Well As Shoes?,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,1923,"['who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'previous', 'film', 'reviews', 'probably', 'know', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'genre', 'tend', 'be', 'too', 'psychologically', 'dark', 'not', 'downright', 'depressing', 'THE', 'SQUID', 'AND', 'THE', 'WHALE', 'prime', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dark', 'themes', 'fact', 'enjoy', 'need', 'have', 'more', 'substance', 'just', 'dark', 'qualities', 'be', 'character', 'studies', 'go', 'deep', 'delve', 'people', 'whole', 'not', 'just', 'black', 'side', 'why', 'IN', 'HER', 'SHOES', 'works', 'might', 'see', 'chick', 'flick', ""n't"", 'prime', 'players', 'are', 'women', 'just', 'easily', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'men', 'brothers', 'grandfather', 'here', 'just', 'be', 'strong', 'female', 'leads', 'pull', 'story', 'premise', 'simple', 'two', 'grown-up', 'sisters', 'played', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'are', 'odds', 'other', 'One', 'responsible', 'attorney', 'other', 'sexy', 'playgirl', 'damaging', 'evening', 'involving', 'one', 'boyfriends', 'apart', 'time', 'learn', 'being', 'other', 'sister', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'are', 'equal', 'parts', 'other', 'focus', 'when', 'learn', 'truth', 'mother', 'death', 'discover', 'still', 'have', 'living', 'grandmother', 'excellent', 'Shirley', 'MacLain', '.Tears', 'laughter', 'are', 'mixed', 'film', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'wily', 'family', 'how', 'one', 'sister', 'shoes', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'might', 'well', 'fit', 'other', 'vice', 'versa', 'title', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'see', 'early', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'character', 'affinity', 'footwear', 'how', 'sisters', 'fight', 'shoes', 'life', 'how', 'sometimes', 'life', ""n't"", 'always', 'nuzzle-up', 'comfortable', 'way', 'shoes', 'family/sisters', 'always', 'do.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'cozy', 'up', 'next', 'favorite', 'embittered', 'sibling', 'take', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'Family', 'Lane']",N/A

956753,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000CCW2OS,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[6, 6]","One of the best date films of 2005, In Her Shoes is a dramatic relationship comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. Directed by Curtis Hanson, the hand behind such films as 8 Mile (2002), LA Confidential (1997), and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992), the film is successful in a genre where so many of its peers have miserably failed. The casting is superb, and the onscreen interaction between the various characters creates a realistic impression of wavering love and conflict. Based on the novel by Jennifer Weiner, it weaves a tale of two sisters with differing lifestyles and a lifetime of personal baggage...In Her Shoes begins with the latest installment of an ongoing personality clash between sisters Rose (Toni Collette) and Maggie (Cameron Diaz) Feller. When the shy and reserved Rose is approached by the most eligible bachelor in her law firm, the two hit it off quite nicely. But Maggie ruins the affair when she shows up on Rose's doorstep and steals the man away with her unrelenting flirtations. After constant feuding, Rose kicks Maggie out while contemplating her own future. She takes a leave of absence from her law firm and contemplates dog walking as an alternative career path. Along the way, she encounters another colleague from the firm, Simon Stein (Mark Feuerstein). The two strike up a romantic relationship, but Rose's past threatens to ruin the whole thing.Meanwhile, Maggie discovers the two have a long-lost grandmother, Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine), who lives in Florida. With no one left to leech off of, Maggie heads straight for Ella's retirement community. But Ella has no intention of being a human punching bag, and for the first time in her life, Maggie meets someone who won't put up with her perpetual self-centeredness and grossly inconsiderate behavior. It's a stand-off certain to change the lives of everyone involved...Toni Collette is outstanding in the role of the responsible and untrusting sister, Rose. She portrays an overachieving, yet somewhat socially awkward, individual sick of playing the part of parent to her wild and rebellious sister. Her actions are understandable and believable; her reluctance to see Maggie in a new light is well-paced. On an equal note, Cameron Diaz fits the part of the irresponsible, yet likeable, Maggie. Yearning for approval, her arrested development transitions to adulthood in the face of unconditional love.The strength of In Her Shoes is almost solely attributable to the various performances of the cast and the screenplay itself. This isn't a plot-driven movie, and the slightest bit of awkwardness between cast members or the least bit of forced dialogue could wreck the whole film. Luckily, the audience experiences neither, and most viewers will walk away satisfied with their experience. Kudos to screenwriter Susannah Grant whose portfolio includes box office hits like Erin Brockovich (2000), Ever After (1998), and Pocahontas (1995). Grant's vast expertise in manufacturing high quality scripts provided the cast with a firm foundation from which to deliver their lines. Overall, In Her Shoes is not a blockbuster titan of the big screen. It has few memorable one-liners, but from an entertainment standpoint, it works well.

There are some very touching scenes, especially with Diaz and an old man in a nursing home whom she befriends.There a few flaws here and there, like one too many plot coincidences, and an over-the-top portrayal of the mother-in-law, but nothing bad enough to make a difference.

Sort of a Holly Go-Not-So-Lightly, she ruins borrowed clothes, parks in tow-away zones, is far better at consuming liquor than holding it and has a bad tendency to cozy up to the wrong guys.Lawyer Rose, on the other hand, has her act together but isn't much better off. Lonely and scrunched up, she reads romance novels through stark glasses and has a smile that's a little disconcerting. When she finds herself in bed with a co-worker, she sneaks a snapshot of him just to preserve a rare moment.Obviously, the sisters are both going through kind of a sad phase and when they have to move in together, they mix like bleach and ammonia. Their toxic conflict, however, nudges them in good directions.Director Curtis Hanson doesn't rush the story -- one thing happens, then the next -- but it's surprisingly enjoyable to watch as Rose and Maggie eventually try to fix themselves. It could've been slow going, or corny, but it isn't. The writing (by Susannah Grant, who adapted Jennifer Weiner's novel) is so natural, and the performances so assured, ""Shoes"" is easy to settle into.

Both were unhappy and after a bitter quarrel split apart abruptly.Came to their rescue was grandma Ella (Shirley Maclaine) - a healer who helped Maggie stand on her feet (a job and a home), reunite the two sisters and consequently found herself reconciliated with her son-in-law.Although the movie had a slow and depressing start, it lighted up with hope when Shirley Maclaine showed up and graced the screen with her intelligence, subtleness and worldliness. The movie provided us a glimpse of an active community for retirement in Florida and it was here that Maggie found her worth and career. Cameron Diaz, as Maggie, looked very much in the role - she was so unattractive before her life was transformed by Maclaine but radiant with purpose afterwards, so much so she could rescue Toni Corette's fallen apart engagement. Toni Corette (Mauriel's wedding) was the one to watch. She was not very beautiful yet she was real and unpretentious. She had far less scenes with Shirley Maclaine than Cameron Diaz did, but she alone could deliver her own struggle with her feelings for and against her sister fluidly and capture attention. Towards the end, there were warm moments that could evoke an overflow of emotions and sentiments.Blood is thicker than water.

Her sister, Rose Feller (Toni Collette) is a self conscious, workaholic lawyer who is dating her boss and indulges in her one passion, fashionable dress shoes.

Both sisters lost their psychologically impaired mother to a supposed car accident that affected their family over the years. One day Maggie is thrown out of her house by her step mother and dad.  Finding refuge with her sister, Rose, she proceeds to make life miserable with her carefree attitude and interference that ends in embarrassment and anger for both.  As Rose's romantic and professional life is turned upside down, Maggie is sent packing and turns to one last hope, her maternal grandmother she never knew, namely Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine).  Ella works in a retirement community in Florida, and Maggie's appearance causes quite a stir.  When she lost her daughter, Ella lost touch with her granddaughters, and Maggie's `visit' serves as a catalyst for reconnection.  Maggie's visit becomes a reawakening of sorts for herself and a chance for Ella to rediscover her lost family.  Meanwhile, Rose is at a crossroads in her life and decides to change course in her job and finds romance from an unlikely source.  Anxious to reunite her granddaughters, Ella resorts to extreme measures to bridge an emotional gap as her two girls begin to discover their own identities in unique and unexpected ways.This is a gem of a film.  It says something when you realize early on that you are watching something special.  Curtis Hanson (L.A.Confidential, Wonder Boys) has struck gold with Susannah Grant's (Erin Brokovich) adaptation of the best seller by Jennifer Weiner.  The film is really about the secrets and lies that cripple a family over time and how a strange course of events revisit the relationships or lack thereof.  Hanson and the company do a marvelous job of balancing some very funny dialogue with more serious, dramatic scenes.  There are some great, memorable lines, some of which are funny and smart without losing sight of the context of the story.  A number of scenes are touching and affecting in their sensitive handling of real emotions without becoming clich&eacute;d.  It's nice to see real people who change over time and how seemingly inconsequential supporting characters gradually come to the forefront.The acting by the entire cast is strong and you appreciate the little nuances in facial expression and inflection of dialogue that enrich each character.  This may be Cameron Diaz's best performance.  That's saying something as the glamorous model has been more star than actress in her most popular films (Charlie's Angels, There's Something About Mary) and she is given a juicy role with sharp direction.  Toni Collette has always been a solid actress in any film (Sixth Sense, The Hours) but she has found a wonderful character in Rose and makes the most of it.  Shirley MacLaine (Terms of Endearment, The Turning Point) is terrific in what is a change of pace role where she eschews makeup to look her age and shows a maternal wisdom that is the stuff of Supporting Oscars.  You wish there were more of her in the film, but what's there is delicious.  It's nice to see an old pro like Norman Lloyd still displaying his acting chops in what is a minor role of a bed-ridden patient who has a profound influence on Diaz's character.The performances are complemented by seamless editing which not only captures the right reactions, but effortlessly switches back and forth between the two sisters especially during key scenes that are thematically linked.  Although the running time goes over two hours, the pacing is good, and everything seems integral to the storyline.  The musical score by Mark Isham is quite effective in complimenting the emotional moments without ever being intrusive.Despite its strong script, the film never fully explores Maggie's transformation which, while uplifting and remarkable, is never totally convincing given her origins and tendencies.  Things get wrapped up in a dreamy sendoff which is perhaps too good to be true, but those same qualities also make for a more upbeat film.Hanson displays a very keen eye in relating what is essentially a woman's film.  Yes, this may be considered a woman's film in its theme and target audience, but considering the fact it is also a well made, funny, and heart rending film about love and family, the women ought to bring along the men.  In Her Shoes is not just about rival sisters but rather it is about a family yanked apart and slowly brought together again in ways that are not altogether apparent at the start.  How these lost souls meld together is the stuff of high entertainment and substance.",4,IN HER SHOES Stands Tall,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,5232,"['Having', 'previously', 'tackled', 'wide',

I expected a comedy, somthing trivial and just ordinary to pass the time...but what I got was a delightful dramedy that touched my heart and made me laugh, cry and smile almost as much as this years 'The Family Stone'.  This story, adapted from Jennifer Weiner's novel of the same name, revolves around two sisters.  Rose (Toni Collette) is the smart succesful lawyer with low self esteem due to a little extra weight and not so much of a love life (in the first few scenes we see her take a picture of a man in her bed because she wants proof she actually slept with someone).  Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is the funny, ditzy, trampy one who deep down has low self esteem because of her illiteracy.  These two sisters love to hate each other and after one too many fights they part their ways.  What happens next is a great look at family and life and life without family.  Maggie, upon discovering they have a grandmother they never knew, or at least thought was dead, decides to take a bus to Florida to stay with her.  Her grandmother Ella (Shirley McLaine) lives in a ""retirement home for active seniors,"" and offers to help Maggie get back on her feet.  With Maggie out of the picture Rose starts to grow, socially and actually gets a boyfriend, a serious boyfriend who in turn proposes.  At the same time, Maggie goes from trampy mooch to respectable, responcible and reliable.  It almost seems as if these girls are better off apart, but as they soon realize without each other they don't make sense.  As the girls finally come to terms with each other and, with the help of their 'newfound' grandmother, come to terms with the early death of their mother, we see them grow and mature, each in their own ways.  What's so great about this film is that is aproaches each charactor with care and compassion helping you too sympatize with each one.  You feel for Rose when blows up at Maggie because you understand how crazy Maggie must make her, but you also feel for Maggie when she fails a job interview because of her illiteracy.  In the beggining you'll want to cry, by the middle you'll start to laugh, and in the end you break a smile.  This is a great, underrated and swept under the radar type film that should be enjoyed by everyone with a heart.  Performances were great across the board, most notibly by Cameron Diaz who stole my heart with every frame.

The only real change to her is that she finds a good relationship, but that takes place completely externally, not on the inside.Other plotlines and relationships are strewn across the stage haphazzardly--each of the sisters' relationship with their grandmother, with their father, with their stepmother, with their stepsister, with their deceased mother.

956774,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000CCW2OS,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","With its predictable situations and stock characters, I am genuinely surprised that I ended up liking this 2005 movie, the epitome of a chick-flick with its veneer of Lifetime TV banalities. However, after a slow set-up, a closer look yields a frequently perceptive, often touching film that exceeds expectations on several levels. First, director Curtis Hanson, not known as a women's director given his previous works include ""LA Confidential"" and ""8 Mile"", has an idiosyncratic eye for the overriding themes of self-esteem, caretaking and inextricable sisterly bonds. Adapted from a popular chick-lit novel by Jennifer Weiner, the story focuses on two sisters, a study in physical and behavioral contrasts - Rose, a workaholic Philadelphia attorney who falls into the trap of an office affair with her slick boss, and Maggie, a seductive, dyslexic and ethically marginal party girl who cannot keep a steady job or a place to live.Their can't-live-with-her, can't-live-without-her relationship has an authentic feel, even if at the beginning, their increasing polarization smacks of stereotype. They have an explosive blow-out at which point the movie tracks their evolving lives on parallel paths. This is where the film's strongest section begins, as Hanson and screenwriter Susannah Grant do a nice job of showing how Rose and Maggie have similarities beyond their mutual fondness for designer shoes. Rose hesitantly starts a relationship with a former colleague unconditionally smitten with her, while Maggie journeys to Florida to meet and  live with Ella, the grandmother neither sister knew even existed, at a senior citizen community. Fulfilling the film's coy title, Rose and Maggie eventually merge paths toward an inevitable conclusion by ending up in each other's shoes. The emotional pay-off gratefully resonates as Rose becomes more free-spirited and outgoing, Maggie becomes more introspective and respectful, and both like themselves much more for the change.Hanson sometimes veers too far into soap opera but ultimately taps into the emotional honesty of the characters by eliciting three superbly rendered performances. As she has proven in films as diverse as ""Dinner With Friends"", ""The Hours"" and ""Japanese Story"", Toni Collette manages to get to the core of her characters with minimum fuss, and her Rose is an intelligently observed, warts-and-all performance. Tearfully pushing Maggie out of her life, she viscerally handles the plot's turning point like a wounded hyena. Collette also provides the film's funniest scene when responding to a humiliating slideshow, she wields a kitchen knife in front of her venomous stepmother Sydelle (played to the hilt by Candice Azzara). As Maggie, Cameron Diaz does unexpectedly strong work here as she demonstrates how far more resourceful she is than her fun-loving personality would indicate. Unafraid to lose viewer sympathy, she paints a rich portrait of a self-deluded young woman who gradually discovers that her self-worth extends beyond her obvious beauty.In an even more dramatic change-of-pace, Shirley MacLaine does not play Ella with the predictable bluster which mark her performances since ""Terms of Endearment"" but rather in restrained shadings that represent some of her most subtle work. It's a commendable turn by an actress entering the sixth decade of her illustrious film career. Not too surprisingly, the male actors are completely overshadowed, but given that, there is nice work from Mark Feuerstein as Rose's supportive boyfriend Simon, Norman Lloyd as the kindly blind professor who makes Maggie realize her inner strength, and Ken Howard as the sisters' resentful father. Brooke Smith plays Rose's cynical friend in a manner almost identical to the character she plays in Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"", and Francine Beers is on Estelle Getty autopilot as opinionated Mrs. Lefkowitz.The DVD includes three surprisingly good featurettes. The obligatory making-of short, ""The People in Their Shoes"", actually provides insightful comments by Hanson, Grant, co-producer Carol Fenelon and the principal cast on what motivates the characters and why the story evolves the way it does. The funniest piece is ""A Retirement Community for Acting Seniors"", which comically profiles the non-professionals who took part in the senior center scenes of the movie, while ""From Death Row to the Red Carpet: The Casting of Honey Bun"" provides a sincere look at how shelter animals are used in films, such as the puppy that plays Maggie's dog, Honey Bun 2. Surprisingly, there is no alternative audio commentary by Hanson or the cast.",4,Surprising Plot Evolution and Affecting Performances Greatly Buoy Standard-Issue Chick Flick,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,4613,"['predictable', 'situations', 'stock', 'characters', 'am', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', '2005', 'movie', 'epitome', 'chick-flick', 'veneer', 'Lifetime', 'TV', 'banalities', 'However', 'slow', 'set-up', 'closer', 'look', 'frequently', 'perceptive', 'often', 'touching', 'film', 'expectations', 'several', 'levels', 'First', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'not', 'known', 'women', 'director', 'given', 'previous', 'works', 'include', 'LA', 'Confidential', '8', 'Mile', 'idiosyncratic', 'eye', 'overriding', 'themes', 'self-esteem', 'caretaking', 'inextricable', 'sisterly', 'bonds', 'Adapted', 'popular', 'chick-lit', 'novel', 'Jennifer', 'Weiner', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'study', 'physical', 'behavioral', 'contrasts', 'Rose', 'workaholic', 'Philadelphia', 'attorney', 'who', 'trap', 'office', 'affair', 'slick', 'boss', 'Maggie', 'seductive', 'dyslexic', 'ethically', 'marginal', 'party', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'steady', 'job', 'place', 'live.Their', ""can't-live-with-her"", ""can't-live-without-her"", 'relationship', 'authentic', 'feel', 'even', 'beginning', 'increasing', 'polarization', 'smacks', 'stereotype', 'have', 'explosive', 'blow-out', 'point', 'movie', 'evolving', 'lives', 'parallel', 'paths', 'where', 'film', 'strongest', 'section', 'Hanson', 'screenwriter', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'have', 'similarities', 'mutual', 'fondness', 'designer', 'shoes', 'Rose', 'hesitantly', 'relationship', 'former', 'colleague', 'unconditionally', 'smitten', 'Maggie', 'journeys', 'Florida', 'meet', 'live', 'Ella', 'grandmother', 'sister', 'knew', 'even', 'existed', 'senior', 'citizen', 'community', 'Fulfilling', 'film', 'coy', 'title', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'eventually', 'merge', 'paths', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'ending', 'up', 'other', 'shoes', 'emotional', 'pay-off', 'gratefully', 'Rose', 'more', 'free-spirited', 'outgoing', 'Maggie', 'more', 'introspective', 'respectful', 'like', 'much', 'more', 'change.Hanson', 'veers', 'too', 'far', 'soap', 'opera', 'ultimately', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'characters', 'eliciting', 'three', 'superbly', 'rendered', 'performances', 'proven', 'films', 'as', 'diverse', 'Dinner', 'Friends', 'Hours', 'Japanese', 'Story', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'get', 'core', 'characters', 'minimum', 'fuss', 'Rose', 'intelligently', 'observed', 'warts-and-all', 'performance', 'Tearfully', 'pushing', 'Maggie', 'life', 'viscerally', 'plot', 'turning', 'point', 'wounded', 'hyena', 'Collette', 'also', 'film', 'funniest', 'scene', 'when', 'responding', 'humiliating', 'slideshow', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'front', 'venomous', 'stepmother', 'Sydelle', 'played', 'hilt', 'Candice', 'Azzara', 'Maggie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'unexpectedly', 'strong', 'work', 'here', 'how', 'far', 'more', 'resourceful', 'fun-loving', 'personality', 'would', 'indicate', 'Unafraid', 'lose', 'viewer', 'sympathy', 'rich', 'portrait', 'self-deluded', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'gradually', 'self-worth', 'extends', 'obvious', 'beauty.In', 'even', 'more', 'dramatic', 'change-of-pace', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'not', 'play', 'Ella', 'predictable', 'bluster', 'performances', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'rather', 'restrained', 'shadings', 'represent', 'most', 'subtle', 'work', 'commendable', 'turn', 'actress', 'entering', 'sixth', 'decade', 'illustrious', 'film', 'career', 'Not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'male', 'actors', 'are', 'completely', 'overshadowed', 'given', 'nice', 'work', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'Rose', 'supportive', 'boyfriend', 'Simon', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'kindly', 'blind', 'professor', 'who', 'Maggie', 'realize', 'inner', 'strength', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'sisters', 'resentful', 'father', 'Brooke', 'Smith', 'Rose', 'cynical', 'friend', 'manner', 'almost', 'identical', 'character', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'Francine', 'Beers', 'Estelle', 'Getty', 'autopilot', 'opinionated', 'Mrs.', 'Lefkowitz.The', 'DVD', 'three', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'featurettes', 'obligatory', 'making-of', 'short', 'People', 'Shoes', 'actually', 'insightful', 'comments', 'Hanson', 'Grant', 'co-producer', 'Carol', 'Fenelon', 'principal', 'cast', 'characters', 'why', 'story', 'way', 'funniest', 'piece', 'A', 'Retirement', 'Community', 'Acting', 'Seniors', 'comically', 'non-professionals', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'senior', 'center', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Death', 'Row', 'Red', 'Carpet', 'Casting', 'Honey', 'Bun', 'sincere', 'look', 'how', 'shelter', 'animals', 'are', 'used', 'films', 'such', 'puppy', 'Maggie', 'dog', 'Honey', 'Bun', '2', 'Surprisingly', 'alternative', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Hanson', 'cast']",N/A

956781,A23KDYA7YGPEWW,B000CCW2OS,Gil,"[5, 5]","I won't go into great detail here, as some excellent reviews have been written. I do want to share my thoughts briefly, though.I decided I wanted to see a movie after work, not just for entertainment's sake, but for some end of the week therapy as well. I looked at 4 movies, one of which was pretty violent, and I wasn't up for that. I read reviews for the remaining 3, and while I normally don't pre-judge a film by reviews, after reading extensively on these, I decided I would just wait until they are released on video.Discouraged,it looked like I wouldn't be going after all, not until I stumbled upon a promising synopsis for ""In Her Shoes"", starring Cameron Diaz Toni Collette and Shirley McClaine. I then read some reviews, and decided to take a chance. I am glad I did!Cameron plays ""Maggie"", an irresponsible and unstable, yet stunningly attractive girl who lives for the moment, and has no stability as far as a home or career are concerned. Kicked out of her home by her lurid step mother, Maggie temporarily moves in with sister her ""Rose"", portrayed by Toni Collette. Rose is a seemingly bland, but high achiever, and very talented Princeton educated attorney who works for one of Philadelphia's top law firms. The differences between the two are indeed evident upon their first interaction in the film; Maggie, despite her perpetul failures, has self confidence and zeal, while Rose is insecure in herself and has very low self esteeem. However, they both make a subtle effort to at least co-exist peacefully. Due to a chain of many unsettling circumstances that present themselves in time, though, this arrangement will eventually crumble and the two become bitterly separated. Rose not only bainshes Maggie from her home, but her life as well. Despite the ups and downs between the two sisters, one cannot seem to live without the other.Maggie then  heads to Florida, where she calls on her estranged grandmother ""Ella"" played by none other than Shirley McClaine, who is living comfortably in a retirement community. There is an initial underlying coldness between the two, and it is evident that Maggie would rather not be there, but has nowhere else to go right now. Eventually, Maggie slowly blends into the community, and despite her age, she is well revered by it's elderly residents, especislly the men, lol!Maggie soon gets a job at the community hospital and begins to feel a sense of purpose. There, she is befriended by an older gentleman who was once a professor, and he encourages her to read to him. Though he is bedridden, his wit and intellect are very sharp. She initially shuns the offer to read to him, which could be interpreted as rude, but later we see why, since she has dislexia and is fearful of confronting it. In time, Maggie and the gentleman form a friendship, and he relentlessly forces her to deal with her problem. One day Maggie comes in to check on him, when she is told by his grandson that he just died. This was indeed a very sad and emotinal part of the movie for me, and I'm sure others as well. Soon, Rose takes a trip to Florida put together by Ella, and the 3 re-unite. Many other events occur and unfold, then the film proceeds towards a very happy, but emotional ending.While it may appear to to be your run-of-the mill ""chick flick"", it's not that at all..In fact, I would HIGHLY recommend this to almost anyone. This movie has style, substance and all of the other elements that a quality film should contain. I walked away feeling a sense of happiness and fulfillment, a feeling I haven't had for a long time after watching a movie. frankly, this is one of the few films of 2005 that I will see again.

956783,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CCW2OS,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","It must take courage to wade through an overstuffed yet flimsy novel such as Jennifer Weiner's IN HER SHOES and find that without all the paraphernalia bruising the essential message there is a fine story to be told.  Such is the case of director Curtis Hanson (8 Mile, LA Confidential, The Wonder Boys) who consistently pares down stories and focuses on significant human issues.  He is greatly aided by Susannah Grant's fine screenplay and by a cast of actors who are at their peak. For all the PR that ruined this film in the theaters (the Magnum Opus 'chick flick', about shoes, silly graphics, etc), this is in truth a fine drama about sibling rivalry and sibling devotion and the cruel effects self-loathing bifurcated parents unwittingly have on their offspring.Rose Feller (Toni Collette) is a bright but dumpy lawyer, successful in her career but miserable in her social life. Her sister Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is her opposite: a silly, shallow, drunken, dishonest party girl who has never been able to hold down even the most menial job for her obsession with men and inappropriate sexual situations.  Moving in with Rose out of desperation, Maggie turns Rose's life into chaos: the two fight, loathe each other, split and yet each of the disparate sisters also acknowledges that they are, in the end, all that each has.  When Rose finally throws Maggie out, Maggie moves to Florida to mooch off the grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) neither sister has ever known because of a long standing parental riff that has altered their lives more than they appreciate. The separation of the sisters by space offers each the chance to discover each other's value and the manner in which the two rejoin is the results of tough lessons learned.Collette, Diaz, and MacLaine each offer wholly professional, fully realized performances.  The supporting cast is likewise fine and the keen directorial leadership by Hanson is evident.  The film is grossly overlong (130 minutes filled with far too much repetitive excess) and the opting for sentimentality as the film moves toward the finish is a bit off-putting, but the surprise here is that this is really a good movie!

956795,A2OD8XUHGTKWZO,B000CCW2OS,Karen Hertzberg,"[4, 8]","My problem with ""In Her Shoes"" was that I read the witty and touching novel, a respectable bit of chick lit by Jennifer Weiner, not long before I saw the movie. The book made me laugh, mostly due to Rose's biting sense of humor; the movie didn't. (Although, in its defense, it's considered a drama and perhaps wasn't supposed to.)Normally, I like Toni Colette as an actress. I thought she was brilliant as the the mother of the troubled ""I see dead people"" kid in The Sixth Sense. But I didn't like her as Rose Feller, one of the two sisters whose disagreements and unshakeable bond form the core of this story. The acting is fine; it's the casting and writing I take issue with. First of all, Rose is overweight in the book, and this lies at the heart of her self-esteem issues. While Toni Colette did gain (and consequently lose) 25 pounds for the role, an oversized butt does not a serious weight issue make. And Colette's part in the movie is far too serious to do the Rose Feller of the book justice. The ""real"" Rose compensated for her low self-image with a truly charming and self-deprecating sense of humor. This just didn't show in the film.Cameron Diaz, while not one of my favorite actresses, makes a decent Maggie. Brook Smith (you might remember her as the serial killer's captive in Silence of the Lambs) does a great job as Rose's best friend, Amy, although I think her part could have been played up a bit more. Mark Feuerstein is charming as Simon Stein, although perhaps he's a little too charming. The Simon in the book was short and portly--not exactly Rose's ideal guy--and his efforts to win Rose over endear him to the reader. Feuerstein's portrayal of Simon makes him so cute you wonder why Rose didn't go for him in the first place.The actress who truly shines in this movie is Shirley MacLaine as the girls' estranged grandmother, Ella Hirsch. Her dignified and decidedly low-key performance shows more poise and control than many of her more flamboyant roles of the past. MacLaine marvelously handles Ella's well-concealed grief over the loss of her mentally ill daughter (Rose and Maggie's mother) and her the resulting distance that loss placed between herself and her granddaughters.There was some essential rewriting done in the novel-to-screenplay conversion, but overall it isn't too jarring. Instead of Maggie running away and hiding out on the Princeton University campus before heading off to find her long-lost grandmother in Florida, Maggie cuts right to the chase and heads to Miami immediately after a falling out with Rose. Instead of getting some smarts due to squatting in the campus library and attending lectures so she can blend in by pretending to be a student, Maggie discovers poetry via an elderly professor in the Miami nursing home for which she works. I found myself not minding this change, and Maggie's relationship with the aged professor was actually more touching than her skulking around Princeton could have been.Overall, I think those who haven't read the book will find In Her Shoes a respectable chick flick. It hit its mark and left me sniffling and dabbing my eyes. What was missing, though, was the laughter. Jennifer Weiner's books will make you laugh, despite dramatic subject matter--the movie, unfortunately, will not.",3,A Decent Story...But Some Casting Issues,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,3288,"['problem', 'Shoes', 'was', 'read', 'witty', 'touching', 'novel', 'respectable', 'bit', 'chick', 'lit', 'Jennifer', 'Weiner', 'not', 'long', 'saw', 'movie', 'book', 'made', 'mostly', 'due', 'Rose', 'biting', 'sense', 'humor', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'defense', 'considered', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'Normally', 'like', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'actress', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'mother', 'troubled', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'kid', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Rose', 'Feller', 'one', 'two', 'sisters', 'disagreements', 'unshakeable', 'bond', 'form', 'core', 'story', 'acting', 'fine', 'casting', 'writing', 'take', 'issue', 'First', 'Rose', 'overweight', 'book', 'heart', 'self-esteem', 'issues', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'did', 'gain', 'consequently', 'lose', '25', 'pounds', 'role', 'oversized', 'butt', 'not', 'serious', 'weight', 'issue', 'make', 'Colette', 'part', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'serious', 'do', 'Rose', 'Feller', 'book', 'justice', 'real', 'Rose', 'compensated', 'low', 'self-image', 'truly', 'charming', 'self-deprecating', 'sense', 'humor', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'film.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'decent', 'Maggie', 'Brook', 'Smith', 'might', 'remember', 'serial', 'killer', 'captive', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'great', 'job', 'Rose', 'best', 'friend', 'Amy', 'think', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'charming', 'Simon', 'Stein', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'charming', 'Simon', 'book', 'was', 'short', 'portly', 'not', 'exactly', 'Rose', 'ideal', 'guy', 'efforts', 'win', 'Rose', 'endear', 'reader', 'Feuerstein', 'portrayal', 'Simon', 'so', 'cute', 'wonder', 'why', 'Rose', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'first', 'place.The', 'actress', 'who', 'truly', 'movie', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'girls', 'estranged', 'grandmother', 'Ella', 'Hirsch', 'dignified', 'decidedly', 'low-key', 'performance', 'more', 'poise', 'control', 'many', 'more', 'flamboyant', 'roles', 'past', 'MacLaine', 'marvelously', 'Ella', 'well-concealed', 'grief', 'loss', 'mentally', 'ill', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'mother', 'resulting', 'distance', 'loss', 'placed', 'herself', 'granddaughters.There', 'was', 'essential', 'rewriting', 'done', 'novel-to-screenplay', 'conversion', 'overall', ""n't"", 'too', 'jarring', 'Instead', 'Maggie', 'running', 'away', 'hiding', 'out', 'Princeton', 'University', 'campus', 'heading', 'off', 'find', 'long-lost', 'grandmother', 'Florida', 'Maggie', 'right', 'chase', 'heads', 'Miami', 'immediately', 'falling', 'out', 'Rose', 'Instead', 'getting', 'smarts', 'due', 'squatting', 'campus', 'library', 'attending', 'lectures', 'can', 'blend', 'pretending', 'be', 'student', 'Maggie', 'poetry', 'elderly', 'professor', 'Miami', 'nursing', 'home', 'found', 'not', 'minding', 'change', 'Maggie', 'relationship', 'aged', 'professor', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'touching', 'skulking', 'Princeton', 'could', 'have', 'been.Overall', 'think', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'will', 'find', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'respectable', 'chick', 'flick', 'hit', 'mark', 'left', 'sniffling', 'dabbing', 'eyes', 'What', 'was', 'missing', 'though', 'was', 'laughter', 'Jennifer', 'Weiner', 'books', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'dramatic', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'will', 'not']",N/A

956799,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B000CCW2OS,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 3]","I'd truly enjoyed both experiences, reading the book as well as getting a chance to see the movie. It doesn't really matter which you do first so if you've happened to see the movie, you'll still enjoy reading the book - or vice versa (read the book, see the movie). I admit I lead toward reading the book first.The basic story seems simple but is richly layered, showing the complexities of sisters trying to connect when their personalities are so different. It also reveeals how family secrets can cause damage for years (I won't divulge the particular family secret - it is a whopper). I WILL reveal this much - the tragic secret not only damages the entire family (father, daughters, sisters and stepmother) but, even worse,divides the sisters, motivating one (played by Toni Collette) to become an obsessively controlled person as well as a caretaker type. She doesn't feel attractive but she DOES feel competent.In contrast, her sister (Cameron Diaz) is absolutely gorgeous but thinks very little of herself, willing to try and coast by on her good looks, whatever jobs come her way and the kindness of men who are all too willing to pay her bar tabs for a chance of bedding her. She relys on her sister to save her when she drinks too much, to rescue her from herself. The strain is taking its toll on the already tense relationship between the two.I think Camerson Diaz is stunning in her role as the perpetual ""screw up"", putting on a good face while feeling like an idiot underneath. Instead of being a goofy sexpot, this time she allows some genuine vulnerability and pain to come through and she pulls it off. She engages the viewer and elicits sympathy (something that isn't always so easy to do for someone who seems so genetically blessed). In short, Diaz comes across as a very real, flawed person who eventually (but slowly, tenuously) gains hope that she can do better.While I found the film to be worth at least one viewing, it had some flaws. It dragged at certain points and even though it wasn't a long film, somehow it seemed to go forever. Still, I was eager to see how the sisters worked through their anger and pain to try and reconnect. Along the way, they encounter a grandmother they'd never known and who is a major factor in resolving their differences.The girl's grandmother is played by Shirley MacClaine, a woman whose personality is so forceful, so simply and completely PRESENT, that it is hard to pay attention to anyone else when she is on screen. At times, her role of eccentric older woman was a bit much for me, almost stereotypical, but she seems to approach every role with complete conviction so I can easily forgive any apparent excesses. Besides, she isn't afraid to be unpleasant on screen. She is willing to show that getting older isn't this wonderful experience, that there are good days and bad along the way. I imagine there might have been some pressure to soft pedal that approach. I'm glad she didn't.This movie is also about stepping outside one's usual routine, of taking chances and moving towards a middle ground, one where both sisters become (a bit) more like each other. Finding peace with one another isn't easy because one sister betrays the other early on in a particularly painful way. But find peace they do and I was left with the reminder that maintaining family bonds is worth quite a bit, including some assaults to pride and dignity. No one else shares quite the same memories and history as one's sister.Toni Collette, an actress I really  enjoy watching on screen, just didn't seem to hit her stride in this film, while Cameron Diaz went far beyond my expectations.",4,"I read the book and then saw the movie - I""d recommend both",1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,3640,"[""'d"", 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'experiences', 'reading', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'do', 'first', 'so', ""'ve"", 'happened', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'book', 'vice', 'versa', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'movie', 'admit', 'lead', 'reading', 'book', 'first.The', 'basic', 'story', 'simple', 'richly', 'layered', 'showing', 'complexities', 'sisters', 'trying', 'connect', 'when', 'personalities', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'also', 'how', 'family', 'secrets', 'can', 'cause', 'damage', 'years', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'particular', 'family', 'secret', 'whopper', 'WILL', 'reveal', 'much', 'tragic', 'secret', 'not', 'only', 'damages', 'entire', 'family', 'father', 'daughters', 'sisters', 'stepmother', 'even', 'worse', 'sisters', 'motivating', 'one', 'played', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'become', 'obsessively', 'controlled', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'caretaker', 'type', ""n't"", 'feel', 'attractive', 'feel', 'competent.In', 'contrast', 'sister', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'very', 'little', 'herself', 'willing', 'try', 'coast', 'good', 'looks', 'jobs', 'come', 'way', 'kindness', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'willing', 'pay', 'bar', 'tabs', 'chance', 'bedding', 'relys', 'sister', 'save', 'when', 'too', 'much', 'rescue', 'strain', 'taking', 'toll', 'already', 'tense', 'relationship', 'two.I', 'think', 'Camerson', 'Diaz', 'stunning', 'role', 'perpetual', 'screw', 'up', 'putting', 'good', 'face', 'feeling', 'idiot', 'underneath', 'Instead', 'being', 'goofy', 'sexpot', 'time', 'genuine', 'vulnerability', 'pain', 'come', 'off', 'viewer', 'elicits', 'sympathy', 'something', ""n't"", 'always', 'so', 'easy', 'do', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'genetically', 'blessed', 'short', 'Diaz', 'across', 'very', 'real', 'flawed', 'person', 'who', 'eventually', 'slowly', 'tenuously', 'gains', 'hope', 'can', 'do', 'better.While', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'had', 'flaws', 'dragged', 'certain', 'points', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'film', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'go', 'forever', 'Still', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'sisters', 'worked', 'anger', 'pain', 'try', 'reconnect', 'way', 'encounter', 'grandmother', ""'d"", 'never', 'known', 'who', 'major', 'factor', 'resolving', 'differences.The', 'girl', 'grandmother', 'played', 'Shirley', 'MacClaine', 'woman', 'personality', 'so', 'forceful', 'so', 'simply', 'completely', 'PRESENT', 'hard', 'pay', 'attention', 'anyone', 'else', 'when', 'screen', 'times', 'role', 'eccentric', 'older', 'woman', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'almost', 'stereotypical', 'approach', 'role', 'complete', 'conviction', 'can', 'easily', 'forgive', 'apparent', 'excesses', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'be', 'unpleasant', 'screen', 'willing', 'show', 'getting', 'older', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'experience', 'are', 'good', 'days', 'bad', 'way', 'imagine', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pressure', 'soft', 'pedal', 'approach', ""'m"", 'glad', ""didn't.This"", 'movie', 'also', 'stepping', 'outside', 'one', 'usual', 'routine', 'taking', 'chances', 'moving', 'towards', 'middle', 'ground', 'one', 'where', 'sisters', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'other', 'Finding', 'peace', 'one', ""n't"", 'easy', 'one', 'sister', 'other', 'early', 'particularly', 'painful', 'way', 'find', 'peace', 'do', 'was', 'left', 'reminder', 'maintaining', 'family', 'bonds', 'worth', 'quite', 'bit', 'including', 'assaults', 'pride', 'dignity', 'one', 'else', 'shares', 'quite', 'same', 'memories', 'history', 'one', 'sister.Toni', 'Collette', 'actress', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'screen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hit', 'stride', 'film', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'went', 'far', 'expectations']",N/A

956801,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000CCW2OS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 3]","The first impression of In Her Shoes might come across like a melodramatic story, but with a director such as Curtis Hanson, the final product should be something else.  After all Hanson directed the brilliant thriller L.A. Confidential (1994) and the terrific film with the pot smoking college professor who could not finish his book in Wonder Boys (2000).  In 8 Mile, he caringly displays the tough upbringing of the infamous rapper Eminem, and how his efforts paid off after years of misery.  Thus, it is not without reason to expect that Hanson could pull off something extraordinary while the title plays directly towards the allusions of something trite and common.Even though, Hanson generously applies stereotypical females through Cameron Diaz's portrayal, as the typical long-legged blond bimbo Maggie.  Then there is Toni Collette, with several admirable performances since her roll as Muriel in Muriel's Wedding (1994), who reveals a counter-opposite character to Diaz through her excellent personification of the overachieving sister with strong type-A and anal-retentive tendencies.  Maggie, on the other hand, is the kind of girl men turn their heads after while Rose disappears in the masses.  The differences between the two sisters cause much friction between the girls, as Maggie's beauty enhances Rose's insecurity about her looks and her ability to date and Maggie internalizes her insecurity through Rose's driven and self-made success, as she lacks knowledge, wisdom, and skill.  The only thing that Maggie possesses is beauty, which she scandalously uses to her advantage to gain what she desires.  However, time is catching up with Maggie, which only increases her own insecurities.Through Maggie neediness for constant attention have formed this helpless woman that barely knows how to drive a car.  The only thing that Maggie seems capable of is to put together a sexy or fashionable outfit.  It often means when she runs out of money or place to stay she returns to Rose.  These moments are very difficulty for Rose, as does not have the heart to throw Maggie out, even though she is fully aware that Maggie will end up hurting her by using her for the moment.  Rose even makes effort to help Maggie stand on her own feet, and not be dependent on others by trying to find a job for her, which proves to be a far more difficult task that expected.  One of the best scenes in the film takes place when Maggie stays with Rose and it is when Maggie is trying on Rose's expensive shoes.  During this scene they talk about the purpose of having these luxurious footwear, which subtly enhances the distinct difference in their existence.The insecurities and personalities that Maggie and Rose hold stem from their childhood, which seems to have strong ties with their mother who passed away while they still were children.  Meanwhile, their father has remarried the stepmother from hell who does everything possible, both consciously and unconsciously, to make both sisters lives extremely difficult to deal with.  On top of this, Maggie discovers that their grandparents are not dead, as their father has said.  Instead, some hidden letters indicate that their grandparents live in Florida.  To make things even worse, Maggie crosses the line of no return, as she sleeps with Rose's boyfriend and gets caught in the act by her sister.  In this complicated situation, Maggie flees to Florida to use her unaware grandmother Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine), as a resort where she can heal her wounds.To this point In Her Shoes seems to present a rather usual set up for a melodramatic drama, however, it is also at this point where Hanson throws in a wrench into the melodramatic machinery.  Instead of turning it to a typical romantic comedy, or sappy drama, Hanson transcends the film beyond the superficial anticipation of a silly over-the-top comedy of broken hearts and retribution.  The film brings the audience on a journey through the agonizing memories of distant and recent past, which allows the story to bring forth moving qualities such as forgiveness, understanding, and an opportunity for second chances.  The story occasionally feels a little too sentimental, however, Hanson incorporates these elements of the story with delicate touch in such a way that it feels natural and acceptable.  Thus, Hanson meets the expectations again, as In Her Shoes proves to be a poignant tale of two sisters' relationship issues that requires much change and wisdom.",4,Transcendently Fascinating Drama of Sisterly Love and Agony...,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,4485,"['first', 'impression', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'might', 'come', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'director', 'such', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'final', 'product', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'Hanson', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'thriller', 'L.A', 'Confidential', '1994', 'terrific', 'film', 'pot', 'smoking', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'finish', 'book', 'Wonder', 'Boys', '2000', '8', 'Mile', 'caringly', 'tough', 'upbringing', 'infamous', 'rapper', 'Eminem', 'how', 'efforts', 'paid', 'off', 'years', 'misery', 'Thus', 'not', 'reason', 'expect', 'Hanson', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'title', 'directly', 'allusions', 'something', 'trite', 'common.Even', 'Hanson', 'generously', 'stereotypical', 'females', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'portrayal', 'typical', 'long-legged', 'blond', 'bimbo', 'Maggie', 'Then', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'several', 'admirable', 'performances', 'roll', 'Muriel', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', '1994', 'who', 'counter-opposite', 'character', 'Diaz', 'excellent', 'personification', 'overachieving', 'sister', 'strong', 'type-A', 'anal-retentive', 'tendencies', 'Maggie', 'other', 'hand', 'kind', 'girl', 'men', 'turn', 'heads', 'Rose', 'disappears', 'masses', 'differences', 'two', 'sisters', 'cause', 'much', 'friction', 'girls', 'Maggie', 'beauty', 'enhances', 'Rose', 'insecurity', 'looks', 'ability', 'date', 'Maggie', 'insecurity', 'Rose', 'driven', 'self-made', 'success', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'skill', 'only', 'thing', 'Maggie', 'beauty', 'scandalously', 'advantage', 'gain', 'what', 'However', 'time', 'catching', 'up', 'Maggie', 'only', 'own', 'insecurities.Through', 'Maggie', 'neediness', 'constant', 'attention', 'have', 'formed', 'helpless', 'woman', 'barely', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'only', 'thing', 'Maggie', 'capable', 'put', 'together', 'sexy', 'fashionable', 'outfit', 'often', 'when', 'money', 'place', 'stay', 'Rose', 'moments', 'are', 'very', 'difficulty', 'Rose', 'not', 'have', 'heart', 'throw', 'Maggie', 'even', 'fully', 'aware', 'Maggie', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'hurting', 'using', 'moment', 'Rose', 'even', 'effort', 'help', 'Maggie', 'stand', 'own', 'feet', 'not', 'be', 'dependent', 'others', 'trying', 'find', 'job', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'task', 'expected', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'place', 'when', 'Maggie', 'Rose', 'when', 'Maggie', 'trying', 'Rose', 'expensive', 'shoes', 'scene', 'talk', 'purpose', 'having', 'luxurious', 'footwear', 'subtly', 'distinct', 'difference', 'existence.The', 'insecurities', 'personalities', 'Maggie', 'Rose', 'hold', 'stem', 'childhood', 'have', 'strong', 'ties', 'mother', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'still', 'were', 'children', 'Meanwhile', 'father', 'remarried', 'stepmother', 'hell', 'who', 'everything', 'possible', 'consciously', 'unconsciously', 'make', 'sisters', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'deal', 'top', 'Maggie', 'grandparents', 'are', 'not', 'dead', 'father', 'said', 'Instead', 'hidden', 'letters', 'indicate', 'grandparents', 'live', 'Florida', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'worse', 'Maggie', 'line', 'return', 'Rose', 'boyfriend', 'caught', 'act', 'sister', 'complicated', 'situation', 'Maggie', 'Florida', 'use', 'unaware', 'grandmother', 'Ella', 'Hirsch', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'resort', 'where', 'can', 'heal', 'wounds.To', 'point', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'present', 'rather', 'usual', 'set', 'up', 'melodramatic', 'drama', 'however', 'also', 'point', 'where', 'Hanson', 'wrench', 'melodramatic', 'machinery', 'Instead', 'turning', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sappy', 'drama', 'Hanson', 'film', 'superficial', 'anticipation', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'broken', 'hearts', 'retribution', 'film', 'audience', 'journey', 'agonizing', 'memories', 'distant', 'recent', 'past', 'story', 'bring', 'forth', 'moving', 'qualities', 'such', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'opportunity', 'second', 'chances', 'story', 'occasionally', 'little', 'too', 'sentimental', 'however', 'Hanson', 'elements', 'story', 'delicate', 'touch', 'such', 'way', 'natural', 'acceptable', 'Thus', 'Hanson', 'expectations', 'again', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'be', 'poignant', 'tale', 'two', 'sisters', 'relationship', 'issues', 'much', 'change', 'wisdom']",N/A

956806,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000CCW2OS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette) are sisters.  When they were children their mother died, their father became catatonic, and all they had is each other.  Rose grew up to be a lawyer in Philadelphia, and Maggie became beautiful without bothering to grow up.  Tossed out of the house of her father (Ken Howard) by her shrewish stepmother (Candice Azzara), Maggie moves in for Rose and completely takes advantage of the situation.  No number of post-it notes will stop Maggie from taking her sister's jewelry, money, and shoes.  We know from early on that Maggie is not a good person, and then she does something so horrific that Rose throws her up against the wall and screams, ""Get out of my life!""  Rose is right to do so, but given that after their mother's death Rose gave up her childhood to ensure that Maggie had one of her own, her sister's absence is a void that cannot be filled.It seems obvious early on that this is going to be one of those movies where each sister is going to learn to be a bit more like the other, but surprisingly that proves not to be the case.  This makes sense because while Maggie is a failure who needs to ""grow up"" and become somebody different, Rose's fault is in not being happy with who she is; some modifications are necessary, but not the radical overhauling that Maggie needs to undergo.  The Maggie we meet richly deserves her ""F,"" but at worst Rose is but a ""D.""  There is the sense in which the two sisters are opposites, since Maggie likes herself more than she should and Rose likes herself less than she deserves, but Rose is clearly the one more sinned against.  Then fate throws Maggie a life preserver in the discovery of her maternal grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine), who was shut out of her life by her father, and who lives in Florida.  So Maggie disappears and Rose tells no one that she does not know where her sister has gone.I found ""In Her Shoes"" to be much better than I expected.  This is one case where the trailer for a film proves to be deceptive (rather than serving up all of the good parts), because the film is darker than the comic moments we see would indicate.  I like that the cruel twist of fate that brings Rose together with another lawyer at her firm, Simon Stein (Mark Feurestein), who turns out to have the charming ability to make ordering from a menu a romantic occasion.  Simon will attempt to do for Rose what Ella is trying to accomplish with Maggie, but in the end it is only the sisters who can complete the healing process.  The insight comes when Ella reveals that after her daughter's funeral she received what was obviously a suicide note.  What it says explains why Ella cannot be content simply to try and get Maggie to grow up, and why other things must take place.  Whether the credit goes to novelist Jennifer Weiner or screenwriter Susannah Grant (""Ever After,"" ""Erin Brockovich""), the key thing is that the writing is what matters here.Maggie's transformation actually begins before she arrives on her grandmother's doorstep, because it hurting Rose to the point where her sister turns on her, Maggie has finally sees herself for what she is, which is not much.

Although she is now surrounded by a retirement community of active seniors, where the women look down their noses at her and the men look over their sunglasses, it is a blind English professor (Norman Lloyd), who gives Maggie reason to think for the first time in her life that she is not just a stupid tramp who has nothing to offer anybody but her looks.

One is a career-focused workaholic lawyer, Rose Feller (Toni Collette),  who is drab and slightly plump.  Rose has one weakness of wonderful, colorful expensive shoes she can always fit, but never wears outside her apartment.  She also likes to fill her fridge with delicious Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream.She has a younger sister, Maggie (Cameron Diaz) who is blond, tall, shapely, beautiful, dyslexic, binge drinker, and seductress.  Her sister Ruth is constantly rescuing her from parties, high school reunions, and one night stands.  Maggie also likes to borrow Rose's shoes - and wears them outside the home.The movie opens with a rescue by Rose returning her to her parent's home.  The stepmother has had enough of Maggie's irresponsible behavior and throws her out of the house.  Rose takes her to her home.Rose soon tires of Maggie's behavior, irresponsibility and failure to find a steady job.  The last straw is a heart-wrenching betrayal . Maggie seduces Rose's new and only love in many years.  He also was her immediate supervisor at the law firm.  Rose throws Maggie out of her home.  She is also so traumatized she quits the law firm she had dedicated her life to.  She survives and learns who really cares for her.  She also falls into a dog-walking job and finds true love with another lawyer she used to work with.Maggie, looking for money to survive goes through her father's drawer and finds a bunch of hidden letters from her grandmother.  She thought the grandmother did not care about her or her sister so opens each one - a birthday card with notes of love and hope to see her.Because she has no where else to go, she travels to Florida to see her maternal grandmother (Shirley McClain) in a Florida Retirement Community.  She wants to milk her for financial help but finds a new view on life.  It is amazing how Maggie learns to grow into a mature woman and the retirement community is a hoot.The grandmother also wants to see Rose and finds Maggie is hesitant - so looks through her purse and contacts Rose to come visit as well.  The family secret of how and why their mother died is revealed and faced as the sisters remember the fun they had together.  After the grandmother and sisters  reunite they realize how they need and love each other and how important facing the harsh truth and forgiving is..It is a good story for both men and women.

956812,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000CCW2OS,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[76, 91]","""In Her Shoes"", the book,  was decent chick lit; a sophomore effort by author Jennifer Weiner.  Of note is that Weiner's books will no doubt get a fresh breath in sales after a ton of American women openly weep for this movie!  I'm not sure how the studio (Fox) got Curtis Hanson to direct the film.  Hanson, who's scored big with ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Wonder Boys"" and ""8 Mile"" seems an unlikely choice, but it is he who wisely emphasizes what is real about the film; the relationships, sibling rivalry, difficulty for a family to deal with a member who is outwardly normal, but who suffers from a psychological trauma; generation gaps and the expectations for people to be what they look like, and not who they really are.Hanson beefed up his chances for more that just fleeting commercial success by securing Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, About a Boy) for the really central role in the film, and surrounding her with Diaz, MacLaine, and a solid cast of performers in lesser roles.  (This is not to take anything away from Mark Feurstein, who plays Simon.  As always he exudes charm and vulnerability in his roles that makes him a favorite of nearly every woman who sees him on the screen).Hanson takes Collette, as Rose, from disgust at having to deal with messy, drunken, inconsiderate sister Maggie (Diaz) when all she really wants to do is focus on a new love affair, to angry lashing out when Maggie betrays her.  He allows her to show the sense of loss she has when she doesn't know what happened to Maggie, self-discovery when she gets away from being a workaholic lawyer, sweet charm when she discovers love under her nose and begins to enjoy it, to self-loathing.  And back again!  He allows us to see Diaz as someone at her worst - uncontrollable, inconsiderate, a woman chock-full of destructive behaviors who slowly, slowly begins to find herself when faced with a woman who won't just give her what she wants so she'll go away.  Diaz is at once her most beautiful and her most cheap and tawdry in this role.  MacLaine, as Ella, a caricature of every character she's played in the last 10 years, has the dubious distinction of making Maggie decide to get real and have a real life, crazy as it seems, in a Florida senior citizen community.In the journey of self-discovery that is Rose's and Maggie's, at the same time, but in different states, Hanson fills us with the longing they both have, and the need they have to be together.  For all their opposite traits, for all their mistakes, Rose and Maggie, above all, are two sisters whose lives are so entwined, they cannot be torn apart.In the quintessential scene from the film, where MacLaine, (who has been shut out from the girls' lives because she interfered too often with their mother, her own mentally unbalanced daughter) takes out a photo album, the two reminisce about the ""best day"" with their mom.  Two days before her death she withdrew them from school, took them to Manhattan, and attempted to sell her fudge to department stores ala Mrs. Field's cookies.  Spurned, she bought Rose a Nancy Drew book and Maggie a puppy.  She returned home to her husband, who was frantic with worry....he has closely guarded the girls, since she is so unstable, and he feels she needs to be hospitalized. (Manic depressive?  We learn she has not been taking her meds).  It is remarkable to see Maggie (Diaz) learn for the first time what that day really meant; that it caused their mother to commit suicide (Maggie thought it was a car accident) and that from that day forward, Rose protected and sheltered her from the ugliness of what their mother had done and why.  It's a powerful scene, made more powerful by the information as elicited by Ella, over the old photos.There are more well-nuanced scenes in this film, and there are also places where it attempts to play too much on your emotions, such as Maggie's insistence at picking out Rose's wedding dress.In her shoes, of course, is metaphoric for the same shoe size that both the sisters wear, the incongruity of a closet-full of beautiful designer shoes purchased by Rose, and unworn...that Maggie dips into and takes whenever she feels like it.  You never really know what life is like for a sister or a friend until you've walked in her shoes.All in all, Hanson does a remarkable job with the material, Collette is spectacular, Diaz shines, and the film has both power and light touches that will make it memorable for women from all walks of life.  Men?  I daresay the handful of men that see it will like it, but most should wait and watch the DVD as a favor to their significant others!",4,Walk a mile In Her Shoes.,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,4618,"['Shoes', 'book', 'was', 'decent', 'chick', 'lit', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'author', 'Jennifer', 'Weiner', 'note', 'Weiner', 'books', 'will', 'doubt', 'get', 'fresh', 'breath', 'sales', 'ton', 'American', 'women', 'openly', 'weep', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'studio', 'Fox', 'got', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'direct', 'film', 'Hanson', 'who', 'scored', 'big', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Wonder', 'Boys', '8', 'Mile', 'unlikely', 'choice', 'who', 'wisely', 'what', 'real', 'film', 'relationships', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'difficulty', 'family', 'deal', 'member', 'who', 'outwardly', 'normal', 'who', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'generation', 'gaps', 'expectations', 'people', 'be', 'what', 'look', 'not', 'who', 'really', 'are.Hanson', 'beefed', 'up', 'chances', 'more', 'just', 'fleeting', 'commercial', 'success', 'securing', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'Boy', 'really', 'central', 'role', 'film', 'surrounding', 'Diaz', 'MacLaine', 'solid', 'cast', 'performers', 'lesser', 'roles', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Mark', 'Feurstein', 'who', 'Simon', 'always', 'charm', 'vulnerability', 'roles', 'favorite', 'nearly', 'woman', 'who', 'screen', '.Hanson', 'Collette', 'Rose', 'disgust', 'having', 'deal', 'messy', 'drunken', 'inconsiderate', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'Diaz', 'when', 'really', 'do', 'focus', 'new', 'love', 'affair', 'angry', 'lashing', 'out', 'when', 'Maggie', 'show', 'sense', 'loss', 'when', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Maggie', 'self-discovery', 'when', 'away', 'being', 'workaholic', 'lawyer', 'sweet', 'charm', 'when', 'love', 'nose', 'enjoy', 'self-loathing', 'back', 'again', 'see', 'Diaz', 'someone', 'worst', 'uncontrollable', 'inconsiderate', 'woman', 'chock-full', 'destructive', 'behaviors', 'who', 'slowly', 'slowly', 'find', 'when', 'faced', 'woman', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'what', 'so', ""'ll"", 'go', 'away', 'Diaz', 'once', 'most', 'beautiful', 'most', 'cheap', 'tawdry', 'role', 'MacLaine', 'Ella', 'caricature', 'character', 'played', 'last', '10', 'years', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'making', 'Maggie', 'decide', 'get', 'real', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'crazy', 'Florida', 'senior', 'citizen', 'community.In', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'same', 'time', 'different', 'states', 'Hanson', 'longing', 'have', 'need', 'have', 'be', 'together', 'opposite', 'traits', 'mistakes', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'are', 'two', 'sisters', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'entwined', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'torn', 'quintessential', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'been', 'shut', 'out', 'girls', 'lives', 'interfered', 'too', 'often', 'mother', 'own', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'daughter', 'out', 'photo', 'album', 'two', 'reminisce', 'best', 'day', 'mom', 'Two', 'days', 'death', 'withdrew', 'school', 'took', 'Manhattan', 'attempted', 'sell', 'fudge', 'department', 'stores', 'ala', 'Mrs.', 'Field', 'cookies', 'Spurned', 'bought', 'Rose', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'book', 'Maggie', 'puppy', 'returned', 'home', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'frantic', 'worry', '.he', 'closely', 'guarded', 'girls', 'so', 'unstable', 'be', 'hospitalized', 'Manic', 'depressive', 'learn', 'not', 'been', 'taking', 'meds', 'remarkable', 'see', 'Maggie', 'Diaz', 'learn', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'day', 'really', 'meant', 'caused', 'mother', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Maggie', 'thought', 'was', 'car', 'accident', 'day', 'forward', 'Rose', 'protected', 'sheltered', 'ugliness', 'what', 'mother', 'had', 'done', 'why', 'powerful', 'scene', 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'information', 'elicited', 'Ella', 'old', 'photos.There', 'are', 'more', 'well-nuanced', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'places', 'where', 'play', 'too', 'much', 'emotions', 'such', 'Maggie', 'insistence', 'picking', 'out', 'Rose', 'wedding', 'dress.In', 'shoes', 'course', 'metaphoric', 'same', 'shoe', 'size', 'sisters', 'wear', 'incongruity', 'closet-full', 'beautiful', 'designer', 'shoes', 'purchased', 'Rose', 'unworn', 'Maggie', 'whenever', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'life', 'sister', 'friend', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'shoes.All', 'Hanson', 'remarkable', 'job', 'material', 'Collette', 'spectacular', 'Diaz', 'shines', 'film', 'power', 'light', 'touches', 'will', 'make', 'memorable', 'women', 'walks', 'life', 'Men', 'daresay', 'handful', 'men', 'see', 'will', 'like', 'most', 'should', 'wait', 'watch', 'DVD', 'favor', 'significant', 'others']",N/A

956817,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B000CCW2OS,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[4, 6]","In Her Shoes"" has all the makings of a terrific film. It is based on the best-selling ""chick-lit"" novel by Jennifer Weiner. It consist of a terrific cast (Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine) and a fantastic director (Curtis Hanson of ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Wonder Boys"" and ""8 Mile."") Although it has its flaws, it definitely was not disappointing. It is also one of the better movies I have seen this year.Diaz plays irresponsible, unemployed Maggie, who still lives at home with her father and evil stepmother. She is Cinderella gone wrong, but still manages to get through life thanks to her remarkable looks and lack of scruples.When we first meet her, she is making out with a stranger in a bathroom stall at her high school reunion, before throwing up all over him.Toni Collette is Rose, her straight-laced, plain-Jane older sister, who is also a successful lawyer. She is the one called in the middle of the night to pick up drunken Maggie, and we know she has been through this many times before.The two have absolutely nothing in common except their shoe size.When Maggie's stepmother evicts her, she lands herself in Rose's apartment. The sisters seem to be getting along relatively well until Maggie betrays Rose by seducing her boss' boyfriend. This prompts Rose to kick her out and Maggie to track down their long-lost grandmother (MacLaine). The plot might sound like a bad soap opera, but what follows is a chain of events that are hilarious, touching and heartbreakingly real.Director Hanson does not rush the story, but the writing (adapted by Susannah Grant, who wrote the script for ""Erin Brockovich"") is so natural, and the performances are so assured, that ""In Her Shoes"" is easy to settle into.Although Diaz tends to be cast as the beautiful ditz and Colette the geeky, ""overweight"" oddball (even though she is only overweight by Hollywood standards) way too often, neither actress plays the stereotype.Diaz convincingly inverts her bubbly persona into something with dimensions far beyond ""Charlie's Angels,"" while Colette is a refreshingly sympathetic loner, and perhaps a grown-up version of the lovable character she played in ""Muriel's Wedding."" Both actresses bring their characters to life in surprising and sometimes unexpected ways.On the surface, ""In Her Shoes"" may seem like an odd choice for Hanson, whose previous efforts have been ""guy flicks,"" but it is ultimately not that far off from the relationships portrayed in his other films.This is not a ""chick flick"" by any standards. It is a movie about women, but not necessarily only for women. This is a rare film I think anyone can appreciate and relate to regardless of gender.""In Her Shoes"" feels so real, and the characters so authentic, you actually forget you are watching a movie and feel a part of these people's lives.This is a movie for any moviegoer wanting something a little meatier, spicier and with more emotional depth than the standard Hollywood fare.I became so emotionally invested in each character's lives that I did not even realize how involved I was becoming until the story was wrapping itself up. At a length of two hours and 10 minutes, this is not a short film by any standards, but the minutes flew by and I realized that I cannot wait to see the film again.Although it is not perfect, this is a terrific film in every possible way. It consists of a superb cast, a compelling story, interesting characters and just the right blend of drama and comedy that makes ""In Her Shoes"" a great place to be.I highly recommend it.",4,In Her Shoes was a good fit,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,3547,"['Shoes', 'makings', 'terrific', 'film', 'based', 'best-selling', 'chick-lit', 'novel', 'Jennifer', 'Weiner', 'consist', 'terrific', 'cast', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'fantastic', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'Wonder', 'Boys', '8', 'Mile', 'flaws', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'disappointing', 'also', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'year.Diaz', 'irresponsible', 'unemployed', 'Maggie', 'who', 'still', 'home', 'father', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'Cinderella', 'gone', 'wrong', 'still', 'get', 'life', 'thanks', 'remarkable', 'looks', 'lack', 'scruples.When', 'first', 'meet', 'making', 'out', 'stranger', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'throwing', 'up', 'him.Toni', 'Collette', 'Rose', 'straight-laced', 'plain-Jane', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'also', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'one', 'called', 'middle', 'night', 'pick', 'up', 'drunken', 'Maggie', 'know', 'been', 'many', 'times', 'before.The', 'two', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'common', 'shoe', 'Maggie', 'stepmother', 'Rose', 'apartment', 'sisters', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'along', 'relatively', 'well', 'Maggie', 'betrays', 'Rose', 'seducing', 'boss', 'boyfriend', 'prompts', 'Rose', 'kick', 'out', 'Maggie', 'track', 'down', 'long-lost', 'grandmother', 'MacLaine', 'plot', 'might', 'sound', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'what', 'chain', 'events', 'are', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'heartbreakingly', 'real.Director', 'Hanson', 'not', 'rush', 'story', 'writing', 'adapted', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'so', 'natural', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'assured', 'Shoes', 'easy', 'settle', 'into.Although', 'Diaz', 'be', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'ditz', 'Colette', 'geeky', 'overweight', 'oddball', 'even', 'only', 'overweight', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'actress', 'stereotype.Diaz', 'convincingly', 'bubbly', 'persona', 'something', 'dimensions', 'far', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Colette', 'refreshingly', 'sympathetic', 'loner', 'perhaps', 'grown-up', 'version', 'lovable', 'character', 'played', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'actresses', 'bring', 'characters', 'life', 'surprising', 'sometimes', 'unexpected', 'surface', 'Shoes', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'choice', 'Hanson', 'previous', 'efforts', 'have', 'been', 'guy', 'flicks', 'ultimately', 'not', 'far', 'relationships', 'portrayed', 'other', 'films.This', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'standards', 'movie', 'women', 'not', 'necessarily', 'only', 'women', 'rare', 'film', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'relate', 'regardless', 'gender', 'Shoes', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'characters', 'so', 'authentic', 'actually', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'feel', 'part', 'people', 'lives.This', 'movie', 'moviegoer', 'wanting', 'something', 'little', 'meatier', 'spicier', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare.I', 'became', 'so', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'character', 'lives', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'realize', 'how', 'involved', 'was', 'becoming', 'story', 'was', 'wrapping', 'up', 'length', 'two', 'hours', '10', 'minutes', 'not', 'short', 'film', 'standards', 'minutes', 'flew', 'realized', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'terrific', 'film', 'possible', 'way', 'superb', 'cast', 'compelling', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Shoes', 'great', 'place', 'be.I', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

All of them were a fairly box office success at their release. Yet none of them may anticipate Hanson's incursion on a ""Family Conflict"" genre movie.Wow! What a debut in this area! IMHO ""In Her Shoes"" (2005) may be compared with such remarkable films as Woody Allen's Interiors (1978), Robert Redford's wonderful, four Oscar winners ""Ordinary People"" (1980) and also five Oscar winners ""Terms of Endearment"" (1983).The story is about two sisters.Rose, the elder one, is a successful lawyer with an unsuccessful love record. She compensates this frustration buying wonderful dresses and lots of shoes.Maggie the younger and amazingly beautiful sister is unable to keep a job and be an independent person. Nevertheless she is able to seduce whichever male she decides to. Things start to get messed up when Rose gives shelter to Maggie.The young cute uses her sister's shoes, car and dresses and eventually seduces her recent lover. Obviously Rose expels Maggie.Fate let Maggie discover that she has a loving Grandma living in Florida and there she goes trying to profit from her.Grandma Ella and her senior friends prove to be smarter than Maggie and start to re-educate her.The film follows both sisters living in far apart cities and their spiritual and intellectual growth.Ella will reunite them and ""family secrets"" will be discovered and solved one by one.Play acting is outstanding. Australian actress Toni Collete as Rose gives a very convincing characterization, showing with subtlety her internal changes. One more detail: she had to gain weight (25 pounds) for the first part of the story and then lose them.Cameron Diaz is more, much more, than a pretty woman. She gives deepness to her character and let the audience know little by little of her internal suffering.What to say about Shirley MacLaine?  She IS a great actress and always gives some uniqueness to her character. Her Ella is full of tender wisdom and at the same time steel stubbornness.Mark Feuerstein as Simon (Rose's fianc&eacute;), Ken Howard as girl's father and Jerry Adler as Ella's pretender are solid and true to life.Thumbs up for this movie!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Sisters: Love & Hatred.,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2291,"['Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'filmed', 'many', 'remarkable', 'films', 'Hand', 'Rock', 'Cradle', '1992', 'LA', 'Confidential', '1997', '8', 'Mile', '2002', 'were', 'fairly', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'release', 'none', 'may', 'anticipate', 'Hanson', 'incursion', 'Family', 'Conflict', 'genre', 'movie.Wow', 'What', 'debut', 'area', 'IMHO', 'Shoes', '2005', 'may', 'be', 'compared', 'such', 'remarkable', 'films', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Interiors', '1978', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'wonderful', 'four', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Ordinary', 'People', '1980', 'also', 'five', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Terms', 'Endearment', '1983', '.The', 'story', 'two', 'sisters.Rose', 'elder', 'one', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'unsuccessful', 'love', 'record', 'frustration', 'buying', 'wonderful', 'dresses', 'lots', 'shoes.Maggie', 'younger', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'sister', 'unable', 'keep', 'job', 'be', 'independent', 'person', 'Nevertheless', 'able', 'seduce', 'whichever', 'male', 'Things', 'start', 'get', 'messed', 'up', 'when', 'Rose', 'shelter', 'Maggie.The', 'young', 'cute', 'sister', 'shoes', 'car', 'dresses', 'eventually', 'recent', 'lover', 'Obviously', 'Rose', 'expels', 'Maggie.Fate', 'let', 'Maggie', 'discover', 'loving', 'Grandma', 'living', 'Florida', 'trying', 'profit', 'her.Grandma', 'Ella', 'senior', 'friends', 'prove', 'be', 'smarter', 'Maggie', 'start', 're-educate', 'her.The', 'film', 'sisters', 'living', 'far', 'apart', 'cities', 'spiritual', 'intellectual', 'growth.Ella', 'will', 'reunite', 'family', 'secrets', 'will', 'be', 'discovered', 'solved', 'one', 'one.Play', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'Australian', 'actress', 'Toni', 'Collete', 'Rose', 'very', 'convincing', 'characterization', 'showing', 'subtlety', 'internal', 'changes', 'One', 'more', 'detail', 'had', 'gain', 'weight', '25', 'pounds', 'first', 'part', 'story', 'then', 'lose', 'them.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'pretty', 'woman', 'deepness', 'character', 'let', 'audience', 'know', 'little', 'little', 'internal', 'suffering.What', 'say', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'great', 'actress', 'always', 'uniqueness', 'character', 'Ella', 'full', 'tender', 'wisdom', 'same', 'time', 'steel', 'stubbornness.Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'Simon', 'Rose', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ken', 'Howard', 'girl', 'father', 'Jerry', 'Adler', 'Ella', 'pretender', 'are', 'solid', 'true', 'life.Thumbs', 'up', 'movie', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

956821,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000CCW2OS,Melissa Niksic,"[4, 4]","The movie ""In Her Shoes"" is based on Jennifer Weiner's novel with the same name. I read the book several months ago and really enjoyed it, but I never had any desire to see the film because I couldn't picture Cameron Diaz as Maggie. That was a big mistake on my part. Diaz gets a bad rap because she's starred in a lot of crappy movies (""Charlie's Angels,"" anyone?) and is dating a former Backstreet Boy. However, when presented with a good script, Diaz proves that she can actually act. She was amazing in ""Being John Malkovich"" and delivers an outstanding performance in ""In Her Shoes.""This movie is about two sisters, Maggie Feller and her sister Rose (Toni Collette). Rose is a successful attorney and is the stereotypical boring, responsible older sister. Younger sister Maggie spends her days and nights drinking and partying, sleeping with whatever random guys happen to be around, and never being able to hold a job for more than a couple of weeks. Being the kind sister that she is, Rose allows Maggie to crash on her couch for what seems to be the millionth time. The two women argue about their respective life choices, and eventually have a big fight. Rose demands that Maggie vacate the apartment, and Maggie retaliates by seducing Rose's coworker/lover, Jim (Richard Burgi). Rose catches Maggie and Jim and the act, and Maggie suddenly finds herself with nowhere to go. Her only option is to track down a mysterious grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) who has been out of the picture since the Feller girls were very young. Maggie travels down to Florida and learns some important lessons from her grandmother Ella, who lives in a senior retirement community. Meanwhile, Rose goes through some personal transformations of her own back home. In spite of everything that has happened between them, Rose and Maggie are unable to sever the bond that has always tied them together, and with the help of their grandmother, the girls are finally able to appreciate each other and enjoy a satisfying reconciliation.I really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. I was impressed at how true the film was to Weiner's novel. There are several things in the film that differ from the book, most notably the fact that Maggie's entire experience hiding out at the university is omitted from the movie. That was a real disappointment at first because I always thought that aspect of the story was one of the most interesting parts of the book. However, Weiner's novel is pretty long and not everything could make it to the big screen. Some material had to be cut for the screenplay and it made sense to cut out the university. Besides, the screenplay incorporates several themes from the university section of the book by creating a relationship between Maggie and a retired Italian professor who lives at the retirement center, which was incredibly moving and well done.The entire cast of ""In Her Shoes"" is phenomenal. Diaz and MacLaine steal the show, but the supporting cast is spectacular. I especially Mark Feuerstein's performance as Simon. (By the way, the character of Simon is much more attractive and overall appealing in the film than he is in the book!) The one performance that didn't thrill me was Collette's. For some reason, I just couldn't warm up to the character of Rose at all. I thought that Collette's portrayal of the character was way too edgy, resulting in Rose coming across as extremely unlikable. When I read the novel, I was instantly sympathetic toward Rose and hated Maggie...then Maggie underwent her slow character transformation and I eventually warmed up to her as well. While watching the movie, I was able to sympathize with Maggie's character almost right off the bat, even though she was such a brat. I never really felt sympathetic toward Rose, even though all these terrible things were happening to her. Collette's interpretation of the role was too stuffy and cold, which was extremely unfortunate. I wish someone else had been cast in the part.In spite of Collette ruining the character of Rose for me, I still think that ""In Her Shoes"" is a great adaptation of Weiner's excellent novel.

Toni is a responsible attorney with a low self-image when it comes to men, while Cameron is a flaky, flirty, uneducated party girl who detests work and leaches off of her sister.  The girls have a major falling out when Toni discovers Cameron in bed with her (Toni's) boy friend.Out on the street, Cameron discovers that she has a long lost grandmother (MacLaine) living in a Florida retirement community, so she heads South, figuring that she'll mooch off the old lady for awhile.Shirley, however, is not that easily taken in and she forces her newly-found granddaughter to not only turn her life around, but also effects a reconciliation with her sister.IN HER SHOES is a joyful, very  human film; one that can be enjoyed over multiple viewings.  The supporting cast includes Mark Feuerstein as Toni's fiance', Ken Howard as her and Cameron's father, and Norman Lloyd as an ailing college professor who touches Cameron's heart.The above average ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes include one about the Florida seniors who played small roles in the movie and another about how a dog was saved from the pound to play a key part in the film.

By the time we watch the movie, we have a keener observation and appreciate it even more.  The director does play a pivotal role in ensuring that the actors and actresses conveyed their scenes by not overplayed their characters and all of them didn't disappoint.  The storyline never condescended any people in particular but it simply rolled on smoothly to see how people deal with their inner demons, self-esteem, and subsequently, finding a way to know be in touch with their inner selves and thus, learning to forgive and reconcile with themselves and their loved ones and moving on with their lives.

The book is really long and a lot had to be trimmed and condensed to make the movie, which still ended up being two hours and eleven minutes long. I thought the choice to leave out Maggie going to Princeton was a good one - I found that part of the book to be unrealistic anyway.I agreed with most of the casting choices. The main casting choice I didn't like was Cameron Diaz as Maggie. The scenes where she is trying to read a book to a man in the nursing home she works in are awful. I didn't find her believable as someone who has a learning disability. Actually, I don't think she's that great of an actress in general.  I know that some people thought Toni Collette was too thin to play Rose, but I wouldn't have expected them to cast a plump actress. Unfortunately that's just not how Hollywood movies work. Shirley MacLaine was wonderful of course - she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Ella Hirsch.Incidentally, when Jennifer Weiner spoke at the BEA Bloggers convention, she mentioned that she was really happy with how the movie had turned out.

Confidential"" to the gritty urban drama of ""8 Mile"" with rapper Eminem. So it comes as no surprise to find him handling a family drama about the strained relationship between two sisters who are poles apart.Cameron Diaz is Maggie Feller, the gorgeous, severely dyslexic party animal who can never hold down a job because she's too busy having a good time. Toni Collette is her elder sister Rose, the plain, Princeton-educated straight arrow lawyer with an almost non-existent love life.Matters come to a head when Maggie is thrown out her father's home and moves in with Rose, only to end up bedding the man her sister is seeing.Thrown out of Rose's home just after she becomes aware of the existence of long-lost grandmother Elle (Shirley MacLaine), Maggie heads off to Miami to touch base with her and maybe shake her down for some money.Rose, disillusioned with her life, decides to give up her high-profile job with a law firm and become a ""part-time dog walker"" and errand runner while she discovers herself.Oh yes, there are some other skeletons in the Feller family closet - turns out the sisters' mother committed suicide and their father never got along with Elle.Thereafter, the movie settles into tracking the parallel lives of the two sisters - Rose as she finds romance with former colleague (Mark Feuerstein) and Maggie as she learns about real life from inhabitants of the retirement community that Elle is a part of.If all of the above makes you think ""chick flick"", perish the thought. Curtis Hanson is far too smart a filmmaker to craft anything like that, and he is helped tremendously by Susannah Grant's smart and literate script.Witty repartee and one-liners come thick and fast, especially from the two sisters.There is also a good turn by veteran actor Norman Lloyd as a dying old man who helps Maggie learn to read.But ""In Her Shoes"" is too languorously paced for its own good, and some of its relaxed moments meant to establish the characters could easily have been trimmed. There also isn't enough of MacLaine, who perfectly nails her role as the guilt-ridden grandmom.",3,"Witty and smart, 'In Her Shoes' is no chick flick",1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2188,"['Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'easily', 'flitted', 'genres', 'going', 'film', 'noir', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'gritty', 'urban', 'drama', '8', 'Mile', 'rapper', 'Eminem', 'surprise', 'find', 'handling', 'family', 'drama', 'strained', 'relationship', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'poles', 'apart.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Maggie', 'Feller', 'gorgeous', 'severely', 'dyslexic', 'party', 'animal', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'too', 'busy', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'elder', 'sister', 'Rose', 'plain', 'Princeton-educated', 'straight', 'arrow', 'lawyer', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'love', 'life.Matters', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Maggie', 'thrown', 'out', 'father', 'home', 'moves', 'Rose', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'bedding', 'man', 'sister', 'seeing.Thrown', 'Rose', 'home', 'just', 'aware', 'existence', 'long-lost', 'grandmother', 'Elle', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Maggie', 'Miami', 'touch', 'base', 'maybe', 'shake', 'down', 'money.Rose', 'disillusioned', 'life', 'give', 'up', 'high-profile', 'job', 'law', 'firm', 'become', 'part-time', 'dog', 'walker', 'errand', 'runner', 'herself.Oh', 'yes', 'are', 'other', 'skeletons', 'Feller', 'family', 'closet', 'out', 'sisters', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'father', 'never', 'got', 'along', 'Elle.Thereafter', 'movie', 'tracking', 'parallel', 'lives', 'two', 'sisters', 'Rose', 'romance', 'former', 'colleague', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'Maggie', 'real', 'life', 'inhabitants', 'retirement', 'community', 'Elle', 'part', 'above', 'think', 'chick', 'flick', 'perish', 'thought', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'far', 'too', 'smart', 'filmmaker', 'craft', 'anything', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'smart', 'literate', 'script.Witty', 'repartee', 'one-liners', 'come', 'thick', 'fast', 'especially', 'two', 'sisters.There', 'also', 'good', 'turn', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Norman', 'Lloyd', 'dying', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'Maggie', 'learn', 'read.But', 'Shoes', 'too', 'languorously', 'paced', 'own', 'good', 'relaxed', 'moments', 'meant', 'establish', 'characters', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'also', ""n't"", 'enough', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'perfectly', 'role', 'guilt-ridden', 'grandmom']",N/A
956840,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000CCW2OS,Richard Ross,"[3, 3]","Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette star as the Feller sisters: Rose and Maggie. Rose (Collette), is a lawyer with severe body issues. She has no self esteem and resorts to  sleeping with her boss since she doesn't  think any man could possibly be attracted to her. Maggie (Diaz), Rose's unemployed little sister doesn't have these sexual hangups. She think nothing of sleeping with men in exchange for drinks or expensive gifts. When the girls were younger their mother, who suffered from mental illness, took her own life leaving them to be raised by their father. The lack of a mother affected them in ways not  fully comprehended. Rose has made it her mission to protect Maggie since childhood,  so when Maggie gets kicked out of the house she lives in with her father and disapproving stepmother Rose takes her in and lets her sleep on her couch. All Rose wants is to help Maggie get a job and start living an independent life. The only thing stopping Maggie is her dyslexia and inability  to read. When she does go on a job interview, to be a V.J. on MTV she is horribly embarrassed. Things come to a head  when Rose returns home to discover Maggie in bed with Rose's boss. Devastated she kicks her sister out and the two don't speak for months. Rose doesn't even know where Maggie is living. Before she was kicked out of both homes, Maggie discovered letters from a Grandma she never knew she had. Ella (Shirley MaClaine) lives in a retirement community in Miami and  is surprised when Maggie shows up and asks to move in. Maggie hopes to get paid off by Ella, and Ella is indeed suspicious of her. However since she looks so much like the daughter Ella lost she agrees to let her live there.  The two women start to learn about each other over time  and Ella makes Maggie a deal: If she gets a job at the local hospital she will match her wages penny for penny. The pleasure of this film is watching Rose and Maggie re invent themselves and embark on new relationships. Rose quits the firm and becomes a freelance dog walker. The benefits of her new job are daily exercise and more free time. When a former coworker catches her in the middle of a walk one day he asks her out. The two start dating and Rose learns to accept male attention and feel she's worthy of it. Maggie goes to work at the hospital and ends up being tutored by one of her patients. As a side project she becomes a personal shopper for Ella's friends. In exchange for her giving them fashion advice they give her advice for mending her strained relationship with Rose. When Ella secretly invites Rose down to Miami the three women make up for lost time and get to know more about each other and the mother and daughter that they lost. Diaz does an admirable job while Collette and MaClaine give great and touching performances. They would be the best thing about this film if it weren't for the feisty active seniors they are surrounded by.

956843,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000CCW2OS,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","""In Her Shoes"" features Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette as two of the unlikeliest sisters imaginable.  One (I'll let you guess which) is a promiscuous, perpetually unemployed alcoholic who is drifting aimlessly through life, while the other is an uptight Plain Jane who spends most of her time working at her job or finding her fulfillment in cheap romance novels largely because she doesn`t believe she deserves to be loved.  Even though they were apparently close as children, the two have grown apart of late, separated by the vast differences in their personalities and views on life.  When Rose (Collette) finally kicks Maggie (Diaz) out of her house, Maggie travels to Florida to stay with the grandmother (played by Shirley Maclaine) whom she hasn't heard from since the suicide of the girls' mentally ill mother many years before.  (One perplexing inconsistency in the screenplay involves the fact that Maggie, the younger sister, somehow knows she has a grandmother living in Florida, while Rose, the older, has no knowledge of the woman's existence at all).Although it is overlong and occasionally languid in its pacing, ""In Her Shoes"" is a fun movie to watch, primarily for the rich performances of the three leading ladies, who throw their hearts and souls into the characters.  They help to compensate for a certain contrivance in the plotting and the lack of conflict that results from Rose and Maggie being, for long stretches of time, in different parts of the country.  During the course of the story and through their interactions with others, the two young women eventually wind up acknowledging the hopeless direction their lives have taken and set out to rectify the situation, ultimately coming to embrace the indissoluble bond they share as sisters.Based on the novel by Jennifer Weiner, the film, written by Susannah Grant and directed by Curtis Hanson (""LA Confidential,"" ""8 Mile""), feels too artificial at times to be taken very seriously, but the actresses, professionals all, bring it home anyway.",3,fine performances rescue somewhat uneven film,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,2024,"['Shoes', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'two', 'unlikeliest', 'sisters', 'imaginable', 'One', ""'ll"", 'let', 'guess', 'promiscuous', 'perpetually', 'unemployed', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'life', 'other', 'uptight', 'Plain', 'Jane', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'working', 'job', 'finding', 'fulfillment', 'cheap', 'romance', 'novels', 'largely', 't', 'believe', 'be', 'loved', 'Even', 'were', 'apparently', 'close', 'children', 'two', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'late', 'separated', 'vast', 'differences', 'personalities', 'views', 'life', 'When', 'Rose', 'Collette', 'finally', 'Maggie', 'Diaz', 'house', 'Maggie', 'Florida', 'stay', 'grandmother', 'played', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'whom', ""n't"", 'heard', 'suicide', 'girls', 'mentally', 'ill', 'mother', 'many', 'years', 'One', 'perplexing', 'inconsistency', 'screenplay', 'fact', 'Maggie', 'younger', 'sister', 'somehow', 'grandmother', 'living', 'Florida', 'Rose', 'older', 'knowledge', 'woman', 'existence', 'overlong', 'occasionally', 'languid', 'pacing', 'Shoes', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'primarily', 'rich', 'performances', 'three', 'leading', 'ladies', 'who', 'throw', 'hearts', 'souls', 'characters', 'help', 'compensate', 'certain', 'contrivance', 'plotting', 'lack', 'conflict', 'results', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'being', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'different', 'parts', 'country', 'course', 'story', 'interactions', 'others', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'eventually', 'wind', 'up', 'acknowledging', 'hopeless', 'direction', 'lives', 'have', 'taken', 'set', 'out', 'rectify', 'situation', 'ultimately', 'coming', 'embrace', 'indissoluble', 'bond', 'share', 'sisters.Based', 'novel', 'Jennifer', 'Weiner', 'film', 'written', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'LA', 'Confidential', '8', 'Mile', 'feels', 'too', 'artificial', 'times', 'be', 'taken', 'very', 'seriously', 'actresses', 'professionals', 'bring', 'home', 'anyway']",N/A

Drunk at her high school reunion, with no where else to turn, she calls her sister, Rose (Toni Collette), a successful, but lonely attorney. Rose grudgingly allows Maggie to move in, crashing on her couch. A few weeks later, Maggie has officially overstayed her welcome. She can't go home to her father, his wife won't allow Maggie to live there. So Maggie travels to Florida to visit her grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine), a woman she didn't know was still alive. In Florida, Maggie gradually learns about her place in life. Back at home, Rose deals with a conniving co-worker and falls in love with Simon (Mark Feuerstein). Eventually, distraught over Maggie's disappearance, Rose gets a letter from Ella.""In Her Shoes"", directed by Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"", ""8 Mile"") is a film filled with good and great performances. Ultimately, the performances help this ""chick flick"" overcome a story that is not the most original or interesting. It's all about the performances.Curtis Hanson has consistently demonstrated his range and provided evidence of his skill as a director. His body of work can not be categorized as simply ""drama"", ""comedy"" or ""mystery"". Each film has shown that he has a good handle on the conventions of the genre; in some cases, he shows mastery (""L.A. Confidential"", ""Wonder Boys""), in others, a good understanding (""The River Wild"", ""8 Mile""). With each film, I have found myself more and more appreciative of his talent as a skilled director. Few directors working today are as adept at moving from one genre to the next. If they do this, they are not skilled enough to make each and every film enjoyable on some level. Curtis Hanson has proven that he has the skill and I eagerly anticipate his new films.""In Her Shoes"" is a ""chick flick"", whether the studio, Cameron Diaz or anyone else wants us to believe otherwise. Instead of trying to downplay this angle, and lose potential viewers, why not embrace it? Was it really necessary for Diaz to go on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" and repeatedly mention how ""human"" the story was? Stewart picked up on this and it was one of his funniest interviews in a while. If you embrace what the film is, the woman will flock to the theaters with their sisters, mothers, aunts, boyfriends, etc. in tow. Tell the women to bring a box of tissue, their boyfriends and husbands can dole it out as needed.The relationship between Maggie and Rose is the key to the film and it is remarkably balanced. Maggie, the beautiful, but dumb party girl has always used her looks to get her dates, drinks and ""companionship"". Rose is the studious, hard worker who spends every available hour at the firm, working. She also buys a lot of expensive shoes, even though she doesn't use them. Even though they get on each other's nerves, and drive each other crazy, they are still sisters and love each other. When Maggie travels to Florida, she doesn't tell anyone where she is, more to spite Rose for kicking her out. But her sister becomes concerned and scared about what has happened to Maggie. As Maggie begins to appreciate life with her grandmother, she doesn't feel it necessary to tell anyone. In fact, when Rose finds out, Maggie becomes a bit jealous, momentarily, until they begin to share things as sisters again.Of the two younger actresses, Toni Collette's performance is better. Collette is simply a better actress and it shows in the way she reveals so many different layers to her character. Rose, always concerned about her looks, is the stronger, smarter sister. Yet, just because she is stronger and smarter, doesn't mean that she doesn't feel loneliness and make dumb decisions. When a partner at her firm gives her the eye, she immediately falls for the attention and begins a short-lived relationship. Throughout the film, we learn more and more about the contradictions in her character making the performance always interesting to watch.This is not to say that Cameron Diaz is bad. She is very good in this film, perhaps her best performance ever. But her character is not as multifaceted as that of Rose. Basically, Maggie is a party girl and she is perceived as dumb. When she arrives in Florida, these conventions are put to the test and her character evolves. As she begins to challenge herself, Maggie becomes a stronger woman and Diaz makes this transformation more subtle than you might imagine.Shirley MacLaine is also great as Ella, the long-lost grandmother of Maggie and Rose. Maggie initially decides to visit her grandmother for a couple of reasons; she didn't know she was still alive and she wants to bilk her grandmother for any available cash she possibly can. Ella is a smart woman and recognizes this. Because she has a lot of mixed emotions about her relationship with her grandchildren, she lets Maggie stay with her but won't give her or let her steal money from her. She makes Maggie an offer that works for both of them.Throughout, the supporting characters are very strong. Mark Feuerstein as Simon, Rose's potential suitor is very good. Persistent and, ultimately, charming, he wins Rose over. Yet, the relationship has more depth than this as well. Most films would be content to let the relationship stay at this level. Hanson takes it even further, adding a lot of depth to the story. As the story shifts to Ella's life at the retirement community, we meet a number of the people who live there. This is, perhaps, the best part of the film. The seniors are portrayed as real people, rather than the usual stereotypes. Each of the people is a different, unique person, simply older. As the main characters interact with this group, we learn about them, both young and old, and what they have to offer each other and the world. Ella is courted by another widower at the community, Louis, and they begin a relationship. A friend of Ella's, Mrs. Lefkowitz, uses a motorized wheel chair and Ella's help to get around, but she has a lot to offer and ultimately helps Maggie find her true calling. It is a remarkably even handed portrayal of a demographic so often stereotyped.The story veers towards the soap opera-ish at times and the film is too long. But the performances more than make up for these two problems.All in all, ""In Her Shoes"" is a surprisingly good film. Actually, I am not sure why I was surprised at how good the film was. Director Curtis Hanson hasn't let me down yet.",4,"Surprisingly Good ""Chick Flick""",1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,6489,"['Maggie', 'Feller', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'party', 'girl', 'who', 'tested',

It is a pity that not many people have seen this film because for all its flaws, `In Her Shoes' is a sweet, heart-warming film with good acting from the three ladies - Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley Maclaine. Well, probably people thought the film is so-called `Chick-Flick.' (words I hate to use). It is, perhaps, but that does not mean a bad thing.The story is about two sisters -- Cameron Diaz's Maggie and Toni Collette's Rose. While Rose is very serious-minded and a little frumpy lawyer, Maggie is easy-going, fashionable, beautiful, but utterly self-centered and irresponsible. When Maggie is evicted from the house of her father, she goes to Rose's apartment, in which she `borrows' her sister's desinger clothes and expensive shoes without permission. And finally Maggie steps on the toes of Rose, by doing what you can predict in the first ten minutes by watching sexy Diaz roaming in the room.Again evicted from her sister's room In Philadelphia, Maggie heads for the south to seek for comfortable life, after finding that she has a grandmother she had never met. The grandma Ella (Shirley Maclaine), living in Florida's home for the old, welcomes Maggie, but she is also wise to detect the true purpose of her granddaughter's visit. In the meanwhile, Rose starts to have a date with a handsome but slightly geekish co-worker Simon (Mark Feuerstein), but it doesn't take long for her (and us) to realize that the presence (or absence) of Rose is the obstacle for her to begin a new life with him.It must be said that the script of Susannah Grant shows few unexpected developments in story itself. The film goes where you think it goes, and Curtis Hanson refrains from using obtruding skills in telling this simple story. Perhaps the film is too long (more than 2 hours), and perhaps the three ladies are typecast. Perhaps, and this is the most important, `In Her Shoes' wears its heart on its sleeve.However, I liked the film because it does wear its heart on its sleeve. And when the film moves us emotionally, it does so with complicated characters supported by the intelligently written dialogues. Flawed as they are, the characters, even minor ones like the charming old folks, come to be more and more endearing.`In Her Shoes' is a kind of film of which content you think you know before watching it. In a sense you are right. But that doesn't change the fact that this is a well-made, feel-good drama with the attractive cast and sophisticated line. It is sweet, maybe too sweet at times, but delightful all the same.",4,Being In My Sister's Shoes: Charming Drama with Good Acting of Three Ladies,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,2669,"['When', 'theatrically', 'released', 'America', 'Shoes', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'Then', 'came', 'Japan', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'pity', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'flaws', 'Shoes', 'sweet', 'heart-warming', 'film', 'good', 'acting', 'three', 'ladies', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'Well', 'probably', 'people', 'thought', 'film', 'so-called', 'Chick-Flick', 'words', 'hate', 'use', 'perhaps', 'not', 'mean', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Maggie', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Rose', 'Rose', 'very', 'serious-minded', 'little', 'frumpy', 'lawyer', 'Maggie', 'easy-going', 'fashionable', 'beautiful', 'utterly', 'self-centered', 'irresponsible', 'When', 'Maggie', 'evicted', 'house', 'father', 'Rose', 'apartment', 'borrows', 'sister', 'desinger', 'clothes', 'expensive', 'shoes', 'permission', 'finally', 'Maggie', 'steps', 'toes', 'Rose', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'predict', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'watching', 'sexy', 'Diaz', 'roaming', 'room.Again', 'evicted', 'sister', 'room', 'Philadelphia', 'Maggie', 'heads', 'south', 'seek', 'comfortable', 'life', 'finding', 'grandmother', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'grandma', 'Ella', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'living', 'Florida', 'home', 'old', 'Maggie', 'also', 'wise', 'detect', 'true', 'purpose', 'granddaughter', 'visit', 'meanwhile', 'Rose', 'have', 'date', 'handsome', 'slightly', 'geekish', 'co-worker', 'Simon', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'presence', 'absence', 'Rose', 'obstacle', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'him.It', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'script', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'few', 'unexpected', 'developments', 'story', 'film', 'where', 'think', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'using', 'obtruding', 'skills', 'telling', 'simple', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'more', '2', 'hours', 'perhaps', 'three', 'ladies', 'are', 'typecast', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'Shoes', 'heart', 'sleeve.However', 'liked', 'film', 'wear', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'when', 'film', 'emotionally', 'so', 'complicated', 'characters', 'supported', 'intelligently', 'written', 'dialogues', 'Flawed', 'are', 'characters', 'even', 'minor', 'ones', 'charming', 'old', 'folks', 'come', 'be', 'more', 'more', 'endearing.', 'Shoes', 'kind', 'film', 'content', 'think', 'know', 'watching', 'sense', 'are', 'right', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'well-made', 'feel-good', 'drama', 'attractive', 'cast', 'sophisticated', 'line', 'sweet', 'maybe', 'too', 'sweet', 'times', 'delightful', 'same']",N/A

It's about family and about discovering the individuality within that family while keeping both intact.The film centers on a rather tumultuous relationship between sisters Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette). Each sister is a complete opposite of the other yet bound by ties that run far deeper than surface appearances. Rose is the mousey responsible sister who tries to rescue Maggie, the flakey beautiful one, from self-destruction. As with all relationships complications arise, feelings get hurt and an inevitable split occurs. Into the picture arrives a long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine) and everything is up for grabs. But it's the way the storytellers reveal each character's nuances that make this movie so special. It covers the ages with insecurities and doubts but heals the wounds with subtle intention.Cameron Diaz is truly wonderful in her role as Maggie and she brings to the role a depth she has rarely been able to delve into in her prior films. Toni Collette steals the show with her tremendous acting ability and Shirley MacLaine is given the chance to be the films stabilizing force. So there may be a closet full of beautiful shoes in this movie but they really aren't what it's all about. Beneath all the expensive heels and fancy slides lurks the truth of this family's hidden treasures.

I guess it's what used to be called a melodrama. It's a word that seems out of use today but fits this movie perfectly.It's about two sisters who are very different from each other. Cameron Diaz plays Maggie, who enjoys a life of dalliances and trifling experiences. Her sister Rose is played by Toni Collette. She is a serious lawyer who used to make herself feel better by food and has turned to shoes. Both Maggie and Rose are trying to fill a void in their lives. But it's Rose that has to bail Maggie out of trouble and is tired of it. She wants a real life. Their fragile relationship is damaged when Maggie has a fling with Rose's suitor...or at least Rose wants him to be a suitor. They lose touch with each other when Maggie decides to go to her long lost grandmother.This is a great rainy afternoon movie that maybe some sensitive guys can get into as well (but I wouldn't count on it!).

956866,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B000CCW2OS,William,"[2, 2]","IN HER SHOES is hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.  It explores the relationship between two sisters, their father and stepmother and then the grandmother they never knew as children.Toni Colette is brilliant as the successful sister who seems to have everything worked out right in her life except for a personal relationship.  Her biggest dilema is her useless sister (Cameron Diaz) who keeps drifting into her life and using her.  Toni is  one of the best actors out there, and it is a pleasure to see her continue to impress with each new role.Cameron Diaz is also very appealing in the film.  While her character is easy to dislike, it is interesting to watch as her character goes full circle.Shirley Maclaine plays the grandmother of the two girls, and there are some very special scenes that highlight why she is one of the greats.While some reviewers have called it a chick flick, I would call it a film for anyone who has experienced the ups and downs of having a sister or a brother.IN HER SHOES runs for over 2 hrs & 30 mins.

956867,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000CCW2OS,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[4, 4]","In Her Shoes is not intended to be a conventional chick flick nor romantic comedy, but it actually works better as a family dramedy. There is plenty of funny and touching moments in this film to make it worthwhile watching, especially the the three leads perfectly fit their roles in this film that deals with dysfunctional sisterhood, history of family feuds, forgiveness, and reconcilation. I must say that initially I was drawn to seeing this film for Shirley MacLaine and my favorite Austrilian actress Toni Collette, but I was quite impressed by Cameron Diaz whom I had little expectation for as a serious actress. To my surprise, this is probably her most striking performance since Being John Malkovich. Guys will get to see enough of her wearing skimpy outfits, underwears, and bikinis. I guess that's part of the whole commercial selling point, no wonder she receives top billing and she's the only one on the poster.The movie starts with Maggie Feller(Cameron Diaz) in the middle of a foreplay scene with a former classmate at her high school reunion. She was too drunk to even have sex in the first place, and ended up passing out in the washroom. Her sister Rose(Toni Collette) was summoned to pick her up and take her back to her father's house, but ended up getting kicked out by the mean stepmother. So it was Rose' turn to take her in as her new roomate, but they ended up gettting on each other's nerves since they had nothing in common. At one point, Maggie says,""I'll do your makeup if you do my resume."" Rose is overweight and could care less about her image, and she's a total workaholic. One would wonder how the heck does Rose' sexy and hunky boss Jim(Richard Burgi) was interested in her in the first place. She's so inexperienced sexually and romantically, which is the opposite of her promiscuous sister. Richard Burgi is somewhat wasted with minimal screentime, but he did get to show off his ultra-muscular body. The breaking point between the sisters take place when Jim cheats on Rose with Maggie. That's where they verbally and physically attack each other.The homeless and jobless Maggie went back to her father's house for one more time to steal some cash and accidently discovered letters written from her obsentee grandmother Ella(Shirley MacLaine) whom she thought had died years ago. She then headed to Miami to track down her uninformed grandmother. Ella was very delighted and surprised by her visit. She eventually shared with Maggie the secrets, lies, and feuds between her daughter, son-in-law, and her before she had to abandon the family. At this point, Maggie starts to reflect on life and makes changes to improve herself. She had to move beyond her imature and crazy old self and take life more serious. She takes the job as a caretaker for the seniors and for the first time she's sober and clean. Meanwhile, Rose is falling in love with her ex-collegue from the law firm. Her first official boyfriend Simon Stein(Mark Feuerstein) had a crush on her since day one. She had no idea where Maggie had gone and she starts to worry and miss her. Then she receives an unexpected letter from her grandmother.......Cameron Diaz looks very sexy and beautiful in this film and she had the most amount screentime, but her role is not as dramatic and challenging as Toni Collette's. I guess one gets to deliver serve as the eye-candy and the other gets to be emotionally affecting. I really enjoyed their fight scenes together, because I can totally relate to what it's like to not get along with your siblings. Shirley MacLaine's role is somewhat low-key, and she had merely a few funny and touchy moments opposite Diaz and Collette. Her performance was so subtle and believable that I just wished she had more screentime to work with. The verdict: this film did make me laugh a lot, it almost make me cry, and it made me smile in the end.",4,"""You are my sister, and you are calling Me a fat pig!?""",1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,3876,"['Shoes', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'conventional', 'chick', 'flick', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'actually', 'better', 'family', 'dramedy', 'plenty', 'funny', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'especially', 'three', 'leads', 'perfectly', 'fit', 'roles', 'film', 'deals', 'dysfunctional', 'sisterhood', 'history', 'family', 'feuds', 'forgiveness', 'reconcilation', 'must', 'say', 'initially', 'was', 'drawn', 'seeing', 'film', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'favorite', 'Austrilian', 'actress', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'whom', 'had', 'little', 'expectation', 'serious', 'actress', 'surprise', 'probably', 'most', 'striking', 'performance', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Guys', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'enough', 'wearing', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'underwears', 'bikinis', 'guess', 'part', 'whole', 'commercial', 'selling', 'point', 'wonder', 'top', 'billing', 'only', 'one', 'poster.The', 'movie', 'Maggie', 'Feller', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'middle', 'foreplay', 'scene', 'former', 'classmate', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'was', 'too', 'drunk', 'even', 'have', 'sex', 'first', 'place', 'ended', 'up', 'passing', 'out', 'washroom', 'sister', 'Rose', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'was', 'summoned', 'pick', 'up', 'take', 'back', 'father', 'house', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'kicked', 'out', 'mean', 'stepmother', 'was', 'Rose', 'turn', 'take', 'new', 'roomate', 'ended', 'up', 'gettting', 'other', 'nerves', 'had', 'nothing', 'common', 'one', 'point', 'Maggie', ""'ll"", 'do', 'makeup', 'do', 'resume', 'Rose', 'overweight', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'image', 'total', 'workaholic', 'One', 'would', 'wonder', 'how', 'heck', 'Rose', 'sexy', 'hunky', 'boss', 'Jim', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'was', 'interested', 'first', 'place', 'so', 'inexperienced', 'sexually', 'romantically', 'opposite', 'promiscuous', 'sister', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'somewhat', 'wasted', 'minimal', 'screentime', 'did', 'get', 'show', 'off', 'ultra-muscular', 'body', 'breaking', 'point', 'sisters', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'Jim', 'Rose', 'Maggie', 'where', 'verbally', 'physically', 'attack', 'other.The', 'homeless', 'jobless', 'Maggie', 'went', 'back', 'father', 'house', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'steal', 'cash', 'accidently', 'discovered', 'letters', 'written', 'obsentee', 'grandmother', 'Ella', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'whom', 'thought', 'had', 'died', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'headed', 'Miami', 'track', 'down', 'uninformed', 'grandmother', 'Ella', 'was', 'very', 'delighted', 'surprised', 'visit', 'eventually', 'shared', 'Maggie', 'secrets', 'lies', 'feuds', 'daughter', 'son-in-law', 'had', 'abandon', 'family', 'point', 'Maggie', 'reflect', 'life', 'changes', 'improve', 'herself', 'had', 'move', 'imature', 'crazy', 'old', 'self', 'take', 'life', 'more', 'serious', 'job', 'caretaker', 'seniors', 'first', 'time', 'sober', 'clean', 'Meanwhile', 'Rose', 'falling', 'love', 'ex-collegue', 'law', 'firm', 'first', 'official', 'boyfriend', 'Simon', 'Stein', 'Mark', 'Feuerstein', 'had', 'crush', 'day', 'one', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'Maggie', 'had', 'gone', 'worry', 'miss', 'Then', 'unexpected', 'letter', 'grandmother', '.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'very', 'sexy', 'beautiful', 'film', 'had', 'most', 'amount', 'screentime', 'role', 'not', 'dramatic', 'challenging', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'guess', 'one', 'deliver', 'serve', 'eye-candy', 'other', 'be', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'together', 'can', 'totally', 'relate', 'what', 'not', 'get', 'siblings', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'role', 'somewhat', 'low-key', 'had', 'merely', 'few', 'funny', 'touchy', 'moments', 'opposite', 'Diaz', 'Collette', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'subtle', 'believable', 'just', 'wished', 'had', 'more', 'screentime', 'work', 'verdict', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'lot', 'almost', 'make', 'cry', 'made', 'smile', 'end']",N/A
