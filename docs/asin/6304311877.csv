I scour the internet and local library for fun movies that are entertaining for adults but funny and/or have a great lesson in them.I saw this movie at the library and the Amazon reviews looked pretty good. I really like Michelle Trachtenburg so I thought it looked like a good fit for our family.  Well my daughters liked it but my husband and I thought it was terrible.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it only got worse.  Wish I would have just turned it off.It was very mean spirited and just didn't flow at all.  Harriet at one point carves the names of her classmates into the top of her desk and then crosses them off (with a sharp object again)one at a time as she gets her revenge on them.  When her classmates are angry at her they harass her in a lot of disturbing ways and it seems to go on forever. If there is a lesson in this movie it is lost in the ridiculous story line and stupid acting kids and adults.

414572,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6304311877,Gregor von Kallahann,"[6, 7]","I first read HARRIET THE SPY in a Children's Literature course in college.  I had been vaguely aware of the title for a while, but I don't think it ever would have occurred to me to read it.  But I found it surprisingly good, with a fair amount of honest insight into childhood relationships, what it means to be a bit different, and some truths about growing up in an urban environment that made it a compelling read.  I started recommending to other adult readers--especially those who (unlike me) had grown up in New York.I seldom expect adult-level movies to be as good or better than the book, so I wasn't too surprised to find that the 1996 film version was, in many respects, lacking.  This visually hyped-up version (you can tell this is a post-MTV product)is actually jarring. at times.  And it drops(or virtually reduces to nothing) the book's many subplots.  And would it have been SO terrible to actually set the film in the early 1960s, the era of the original's action?  Of course, plots for ""grown up"" movies get updated too, and sometimes it works.  But usually it's just an attempt to appeal to the ""contemporary"" audience and often violates the spirit of the original.The notion that kids can't identify with children from other times and places is a pretty condescending one.  And speaking of places, there seems to be little attemptin this film to capture any of the flavor of life in New York (in any era).  Sure there are immigrant families, some urban eccentrics, and in fact, the film is much more racially and ethnically diverse than the novel  But it could be Any City, USA.  And while the notion of ""spying"" has a certain attraction for kids of any era, it had a special resonance in the Cold War years that would have been nice to see captured in the film somehow.Having said all that, I would have to admit that--as some other reviewers mention--that this film will likely appeal to its target audience, contemporary pre-adolescents.  A film doesn't have to be ""truly great"" to be entertaining, and that's true for any age level.  And kids generally like to see their issues and concerns dramatized.  The film makes its points about kindness and consideration vs. honesty and frankness well enough.  In that sense, it really is good ""family viewing,"" in that it can get parents and kids to discuss matters that concern almost any 11-year old.But that's true of almost any ""After School Special"" or ""very special episodes"" of a given TV series.  What really makes for great family viewing in my book is a film that is well scripted, acted and produced.  It can be entertaining for kids AND adults.  In fact, it should be as entertaining for adults who originally saw the film as kids.  That's probably the ultimate test.  Would a young adult of, say, 23 or 24 who saw this film when it was released 12 years ago, still enjoy it--or more than just a nostalgic level?  I could be wrong, but I think any number of such viewers would come away from a viewing of this film today at least a LITTLE disappointed.",3,Harriet The Post Cold-War Spy,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,3033,"['first', 'read', 'HARRIET', 'THE', 'SPY', 'Children', 'Literature', 'course', 'college', 'had', 'been', 'vaguely', 'aware', 'title', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'occurred', 'read', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'fair', 'amount', 'honest', 'insight', 'childhood', 'relationships', 'what', 'be', 'bit', 'different', 'truths', 'growing', 'up', 'urban', 'environment', 'made', 'compelling', 'read', 'started', 'recommending', 'other', 'adult', 'readers', 'especially', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'New', 'York.I', 'seldom', 'expect', 'adult-level', 'movies', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'surprised', 'find', '1996', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'many', 'respects', 'lacking', 'visually', 'hyped-up', 'version', 'can', 'tell', 'post-MTV', 'product', 'actually', 'jarring', 'times', 'virtually', 'reduces', 'nothing', 'book', 'many', 'subplots', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'SO', 'terrible', 'actually', 'set', 'film', 'early', '1960s', 'era', 'original', 'action', 'course', 'plots', 'grown', 'up', 'movies', 'get', 'updated', 'too', 'usually', 'just', 'attempt', 'appeal', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'often', 'spirit', 'original.The', 'notion', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'children', 'other', 'times', 'places', 'pretty', 'condescending', 'one', 'speaking', 'places', 'be', 'little', 'attemptin', 'film', 'capture', 'flavor', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'era', 'Sure', 'are', 'immigrant', 'families', 'urban', 'eccentrics', 'fact', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'racially', 'ethnically', 'diverse', 'novel', 'could', 'be', 'Any', 'City', 'USA', 'notion', 'spying', 'certain', 'attraction', 'kids', 'era', 'had', 'special', 'resonance', 'Cold', 'War', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'captured', 'film', 'somehow.Having', 'said', 'would', 'have', 'admit', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mention', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'appeal', 'target', 'audience', 'contemporary', 'pre-adolescents', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'truly', 'great', 'be', 'entertaining', 'true', 'age', 'level', 'kids', 'generally', 'like', 'see', 'issues', 'concerns', 'dramatized', 'film', 'points', 'kindness', 'consideration', 'vs.', 'honesty', 'frankness', 'well', 'enough', 'sense', 'really', 'good', 'family', 'viewing', 'can', 'get', 'parents', 'kids', 'discuss', 'matters', 'concern', 'almost', '11-year', 'old.But', 'true', 'almost', 'School', 'Special', 'very', 'special', 'episodes', 'given', 'TV', 'series', 'What', 'really', 'great', 'family', 'viewing', 'book', 'film', 'well', 'scripted', 'acted', 'produced', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'AND', 'adults', 'fact', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'who', 'originally', 'saw', 'film', 'kids', 'probably', 'ultimate', 'test', 'Would', 'young', 'adult', 'say', '23', '24', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'enjoy', 'more', 'just', 'nostalgic', 'level', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'think', 'number', 'such', 'viewers', 'would', 'come', 'away', 'viewing', 'film', 'today', 'least', 'LITTLE', 'disappointed']",N/A

The movie description is a bit simple and complicated at the same time Its about an 11 yr old that wants to be a writer but her spying is her writing actually its more like shes exploring and writing everything she sees. You cant just read reviews about the movie you have to see it cause some of the reviews dont do this great movie any justice.

The cover is tattered and torn now (my dad, not me), but it's been well loved.I've had the DVD on my wishlist for ages! My dad claimed I'd seen it before, but upon watching, it was obvious to both of us that neither of us had seen it.First of all, most of the characters didn't quite match what I had in my head reading the book, and some characters & things had been changed. For starters, Harriet had glasses, and short hair. In this, the glasses are virtually gone, and her hair's very long. The Italians that she spied on in their restaurant in the book, are now Chinese. And Eartha Kitt as the fabulous Agatha Plummer makes only 1 main appearance, and 1 very brief appearance, whereas in the book she was a regular character almost!Of course, it's open to interpertation, but when you're a child, if you have an imagination that is, you get to 'see' the story unfolding in your head, and when I saw this film after so many years, I was so disappointed to see that some of my favourite scenes had been completely dropped (the section where she builds a town in the mud at the bottom of the tree was a particular favourite). Golly was described as being tall, thin, and not a very pretty person - in the film she was turned into Rosie O'Donnell which actually worked. Sport (Gregory Smith who also appeared in Small Soldiers) was the only other character who matched the image in my head to in the film.Michelle Trachtenberg, although she has the best name in the world, just didn't work for me as Harriet. (Although she did remind me of myself at that age.) There was something that didn't click, and it brought the film down a whole for me.Most of the kids who appeared in this, didn't amount to much, although Michelle has recently reappeared in Ice Princess. Gregory Smith has of course appeared in Small Soldiers. Vanessa Lee Chester, who played Janie, hasn't done much recently, although she did appear in Lost World, A Little Princess, and She's All That, although if you check out her pic on IMDB, my, hasn't she grown up! The aptly named character in the film, Boy With The Purple Socks (played by Dov Tiefenbach) has appeared in Jason X and Get Over It. Alisha Morrison, who played Laura Peters, also had a small role in Mean Girls.The film can be quite upsetting when Harriet becomes an outcast in her class, and I found it quite hard to watch at this point.

The book's Janie Gibbs was a smartmouthed redhead with lots of freckles, and I hated seeing her look altered for the sake of all those politically-correct ninnies out there.

I was 16 then, and I had read the book a few times.  Quite frankly, I didn't like the book that much.  I thought it ended badly and Harriet was a bit too mean in the book.  But when I saw the movie, I fell in love with Harriet as played by Michelle Trachtenberg.  She was positively wonderful in the role, and made Harriet likable and believable.Harriet learns some important lessons about friendship and the power of words.  She also learns to deal with growing up and living with parents who love her but are often absent.  I think many kids can relate to this movie.  Harriet's classmates are real kids and we see Harriet having to decide whether to cater to the popular kids or stay true to herself.  We also see her take responsibility for her actions and win back her true friends.I think Harriet is a positive role model in many instances.  Of course, some could take issue with her spying on people, but she usually does not do so in an illegal manner!  After all, this isn't a totally real story!  The only thing I didn't like about the movie is when Harriet's nanny tells her she has to lie in order to win back her friends.  Because really, she does not, she simply has to not be so harsh with the truth.  But this is a minor point.The music in this movie is great, and I have tried for years to find a soundtrack without success.  If anyone knows where the soundtrack is, please let me know!I also loved the scenes where Harriet does some crazy and fun things like going with her friends to the lady's garden made out of found objects, or fencing with Golly's boyfriend at the movie theater.  Harriet and Golly's relationship is beautifully portrayed.  It made me want my own lovable nanny!At any rate, sorry for the long review, but I think this movie is fun and great and I highly recommend it for kids ages 9-13 or so.

My daughter has liked this movie for years and I think I like it even more than her.  Nickelodeon has produced something special here.  Before SPY KIDS there was HARRIET!  This is a great adventure with some emotional themes (peer pressure, honesty) for youngsters.  Through hip hand-held style camera shooting and a festive funky soundtrack to boot, I like the movie simply for the execution.  The fact that Rosie O'Donnel was pregnant (in disquise) during the making is also an interesting obstacle they had to work with.  At any rate, Harriet the Spy is a fun, and rather different movie.  When I say different I mean not like typical movies today filled with special effects and scenes so crammed with action and expository dialog that you can't even enjoy a scene.  Harriet the Spy has some calm moments that cinematically shine (unique camera angles, color choices).  The subtle sound effects and many humorous moments make this story fun for everyone.The only reason I give this movie 4 and not 5 stars is because the DVD version the Paramount has put together offers a FALSE widescreen representation of the movie.  If you compare to the earlier VHS edition, you'll notice that they actually CROPPED this movie for DVD to give it the APPEARANCE of widescreen, rather, you're actually seeing LESS of the picture which was originally cropped on the VHS version for full-screen adaptation to begin with!  That and NO bonus features to speak for whatsoever (is it so hard to add at least the original TRAILER?)
