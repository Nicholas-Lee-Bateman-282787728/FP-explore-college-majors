Nobody expects movies to be completely faithful to historical fact, but when the basic premise of your movie is totally false to begin with, it can only go downhill.  The only redeeming feature of this movie is the music, and it doesn't even really do justice to Warlock's many compositions.The idea that Warlock/Heseltine were two distinct split personalities, utterly unaware of each other's true existence, is just a load of nonsense.  Phillip Heseltine may not have been the most stable character in history, but he was a far cry from Sybil, for crying out loud.  There has been plenty of good scholarship done on him, and the most that can be suggested is that the Warlock/Heseltine split represented some unresolved personality conflicts.  His suicide was the result of numerous factors, none of which are addressed in this goofy movie.Making the whole production even more unbearable is a positively stupid love triangle, wholely concocted for the purposes of this movie.  In fact, Heseltine had married and had a son by the time of his death.  One wonders what Nigel Heseltine makes of this leaden mishmash purporting to be his father's story.I am only glad that I saw this on TV, rather than in the theatre or after having rented it.  This way, the only thing wasted was about 2 hours of my life, rather than my precious dollars.  Do yourself a favor; instead of renting or buying this video, save your money and buy one of the many quality CDs featuring Warlock's music.  You will find that the music is much more innovative and engaging than this silly movie.",1,Utter Rubbish,1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,1614,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'oh', 'sure', 'Nobody', 'movies', 'be', 'completely', 'faithful', 'historical', 'fact', 'when', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'totally', 'false', 'begin', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'downhill', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'movie', 'music', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'Warlock', 'many', 'compositions.The', 'idea', 'Warlock/Heseltine', 'were', 'two', 'distinct', 'split', 'personalities', 'utterly', 'unaware', 'other', 'true', 'existence', 'just', 'load', 'nonsense', 'Phillip', 'Heseltine', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'stable', 'character', 'history', 'was', 'far', 'cry', 'Sybil', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'been', 'plenty', 'good', 'scholarship', 'done', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'suggested', 'Warlock/Heseltine', 'split', 'represented', 'unresolved', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'suicide', 'was', 'result', 'numerous', 'factors', 'none', 'are', 'addressed', 'goofy', 'movie.Making', 'whole', 'production', 'even', 'more', 'unbearable', 'positively', 'stupid', 'love', 'triangle', 'wholely', 'concocted', 'purposes', 'movie', 'fact', 'Heseltine', 'had', 'married', 'had', 'son', 'time', 'death', 'One', 'Nigel', 'Heseltine', 'leaden', 'mishmash', 'purporting', 'be', 'father', 'story.I', 'am', 'only', 'glad', 'saw', 'TV', 'rather', 'theatre', 'having', 'rented', 'way', 'only', 'thing', 'wasted', 'was', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'rather', 'precious', 'dollars', 'Do', 'favor', 'instead', 'renting', 'buying', 'video', 'save', 'money', 'buy', 'one', 'many', 'quality', 'CDs', 'featuring', 'Warlock', 'music', 'will', 'find', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'innovative', 'engaging', 'silly', 'movie']",N/A

Not to say that the true story wasn't intriguing in itself (very mysterious actually), but they had little in common with the screenplay.However, taken as an individual work of art, the film was brilliantly done, and the music hauntingly beautiful (I'm still waiting for a soundtrack release). Jeremy Northam was sleek and chaotic, charming and gruff, gentile and maniacal - ingenious wouldn't be too strong a word in this instance. The plot spoiler comes fairly early, but it becomes quickly clear that this movie was made to showcase Jeremy's exceptional acting talent.I highly recommend ""Voices"" to any and every Northam fan or to anyone who loves the intrigue of a good psychodrama, but would advise history buffs to rethink watching it or the inaccuracies may ruin it for you.",5,"More fiction than fact, but brilliant just the same.",1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,997,"['movie', 'had', 'so', 'engrossed', 'researched', 'quite', 'bit', 'Philip', 'Heseltine', 'Peter', 'Warlock', 'relationship', 'basis', 'story', 'discovered', 'most', 'film', 'details', 'were', 'fabricated', 'Not', 'say', 'true', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'intriguing', 'very', 'mysterious', 'actually', 'had', 'little', 'common', 'screenplay.However', 'taken', 'individual', 'work', 'art', 'film', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'music', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'soundtrack', 'release', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'was', 'sleek', 'chaotic', 'charming', 'gruff', 'gentile', 'maniacal', 'ingenious', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'word', 'instance', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'fairly', 'early', 'quickly', 'clear', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'showcase', 'Jeremy', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'talent.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Voices', 'Northam', 'fan', 'anyone', 'who', 'intrigue', 'good', 'psychodrama', 'would', 'advise', 'history', 'buffs', 'rethink', 'watching', 'inaccuracies', 'may', 'ruin']",N/A

Lily, concerned and wanting to avert any disaster between the two, hunts down and confronts Peter Warlock, only to be shocked when she meets him and realizes that there is a strange and bitter struggle taking place of which she was previously unaware.This is an intriguing psychological thriller that will keep the viewer riveted.
