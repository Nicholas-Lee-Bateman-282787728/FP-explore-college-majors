HOWEVER why do only customers who have Blue Ray systems get the opportunity to see the Smile effect version.  The superb documentary featured on Disc 3 of the standard DVD release shows just how much viewing of the main feature would be improved by seeing the movie this way.Picture size is much bigger than the stretched out 2:89 version and the curved effect gives a wonderful impression of the actual Cinerama experience.  Seeing all the excerpts from original Cinerama movies included in the Documentary makes one hopeful that these may also get a release at some point in the future.  In the meantime can we poor customers who have not yet upgraded to Blue Ray PLEASE have a Smile vision copy issued on standard DVD.,5,Why no Smilevision version on DVD,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,835,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'Cinerama', 'even', 'travelogues', ""'m"", 'delighted', 'finally', 'get', 'fully', 'restored', 'version', 'DVD', 'HOWEVER', 'why', 'do', 'only', 'customers', 'who', 'have', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'systems', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Smile', 'effect', 'version', 'superb', 'documentary', 'featured', 'Disc', '3', 'standard', 'DVD', 'release', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'viewing', 'main', 'feature', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'seeing', 'movie', 'way.Picture', 'size', 'much', 'bigger', 'stretched', '2:89', 'version', 'curved', 'effect', 'wonderful', 'impression', 'actual', 'Cinerama', 'experience', 'Seeing', 'excerpts', 'original', 'Cinerama', 'movies', 'included', 'Documentary', 'one', 'hopeful', 'may', 'also', 'get', 'release', 'point', 'future', 'meantime', 'can', 'poor', 'customers', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'upgraded', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'PLEASE', 'have', 'Smile', 'vision', 'copy', 'issued', 'standard', 'DVD']",How the West Was Won

142347,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,0792839072,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[9, 10]","My son and I have just seen the Cinerama (3 strip) re-release at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood.  I've grown up on the movie, but my 24 year old son was seeing it for the first time.  Believe it or not, this was the first time I have seen it in the full, Cinerama (3 strip film) format.  Some people lament that no video transfer can capture the true Cinerama image, and ask MGM to release a  &quot;proper widescreen&quot; version.  Being Cinerama, no video release can ever truly capture the ultra-wide screen format of three separate pictures running simultaniously.  I was surprised to see the &quot;seams&quot; in it's original format.  In fact, one engineer's sole job during projection is to keep these seams straight!  I noticed that, even in it's original format, there is actually a slight distortion of the image on the very outer edges of the deeply curved screen.  It is no wonder that the various directors correctly kept their actors framed within the center of the screen, leaving the edges (with a few exceptions) for &quot;fill&quot; - to expand the screen in an attempt to create the normal range of vision of the human eye.  After HOW THE WEST WAS WON, Cinerama changed to a single lens system primarily because the wide-eyed lenses used for Cinerama could not be used for close-ups, which are consipictiously missing in true Cinerama.  The Cinerama company (and the studios) still wanted the aspect ratio that the Cinerama process achieved, so they went to Super Panavision 70 or Ultra-Panavision.  The problem was that, when these 70mm  films were initially released, the advertising stated that they were presented &quot;in Cinerama,&quot; which may have confused patrons who thought they were seeing the original, 3-strip process.  That's why I've always insisted that I saw a &quot;Cinerama&quot; version of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  That Kubrick film was not made in true Cinerama but in Super Panavision 70.  As far as the aspect ratio is concerned, the various video transfers of HOW THE WEST WAS WON are probably as good as we can get.",3,It is Cinerama and that's it,1064620800,"09 27, 2003",2003,2061,"['son', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'Cinerama', '3', 'strip', 're-release', 'Cinerama', 'Dome', 'Hollywood', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'movie', '24', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'Believe', 'not', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'full', 'Cinerama', '3', 'strip', 'film', 'format', 'people', 'lament', 'video', 'transfer', 'can', 'capture', 'true', 'Cinerama', 'image', 'ask', 'MGM', 'release', 'quot', 'widescreen', 'quot', 'version', 'Being', 'Cinerama', 'video', 'release', 'can', 'ever', 'truly', 'capture', 'ultra-wide', 'screen', 'format', 'three', 'separate', 'pictures', 'running', 'simultaniously', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'quot', 'quot', 'original', 'format', 'fact', 'one', 'engineer', 'sole', 'job', 'projection', 'keep', 'seams', 'straight', 'noticed', 'even', 'original', 'format', 'actually', 'slight', 'distortion', 'image', 'very', 'outer', 'edges', 'deeply', 'curved', 'screen', 'wonder', 'various', 'directors', 'correctly', 'kept', 'actors', 'framed', 'center', 'screen', 'leaving', 'edges', 'few', 'exceptions', 'quot', 'quot', 'expand', 'screen', 'attempt', 'create', 'normal', 'range', 'vision', 'human', 'eye', 'HOW', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WAS', 'WON', 'Cinerama', 'changed', 'single', 'lens', 'system', 'primarily', 'wide-eyed', 'lenses', 'used', 'Cinerama', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'close-ups', 'are', 'consipictiously', 'missing', 'true', 'Cinerama', 'Cinerama', 'company', 'studios', 'still', 'wanted', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'achieved', 'went', 'Super', 'Panavision', '70', 'Ultra-Panavision', 'problem', 'was', 'when', '70mm', 'films', 'were', 'initially', 'released', 'advertising', 'stated', 'were', 'presented', 'quot', 'Cinerama', 'quot', 'may', 'have', 'confused', 'patrons', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'seeing', 'original', '3-strip', 'process', 'why', ""'ve"", 'always', 'insisted', 'saw', 'quot', 'Cinerama', 'quot', 'version', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'true', 'Cinerama', 'Super', 'Panavision', '70', 'As', 'far', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'concerned', 'various', 'video', 'transfers', 'HOW', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WAS', 'WON', 'are', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'get']",How the West Was Won

But the letterboxing on the How the West Was Won DVD is not as severe as it is on the Ben Hur DVD.The sound is great, as well. In the documentary we learn that Cinerama music track recordings were done in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York, of all places, using a who's who of New York City-area orchestra members.During each theatrical Cinerama screening a sound engineer mixed the seven tracks on the spot, taking into account the number of people in the house, whether or not they had coats, things like that.How the West Was Won--the last true Cinerama film--has been given a restoration worthy of the whole remarkable Cinerama enterprise.",5,excellent DVD release,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,1334,"['three', 'disc', 'set', 'movie', 'two', 'discs', 'trailer', 'second', 'one', 'third', 'disc', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'called', 'Cinerama', 'Adventure', 'documentary', 'price', 'set', 'trailer', 'not', 'restored', 'handy', 'three-panel', 'source', 'compare', 'new', 'seamless', 'realese.How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'fabulous', 'lines', 'are', 'indeed', 'gone', 'picture', 'w-i-d-e', 'So', 'wide', 'documentary', 'states', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'directly', 'other', 'shooting', 'side', 'bit', 'so', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'facing', 'other', 'Cinerama', 'screen.The', 'field', 'view', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'much', 'greater', 'instance', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'letterboxing', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'DVD', 'not', 'as', 'severe', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'DVD.The', 'sound', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'learn', 'Cinerama', 'music', 'track', 'recordings', 'were', 'done', 'Oyster', 'Bay', 'Long', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'places', 'using', 'who', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City-area', 'orchestra', 'members.During', 'theatrical', 'Cinerama', 'screening', 'sound', 'engineer', 'mixed', 'seven', 'tracks', 'spot', 'taking', 'account', 'number', 'people', 'house', 'not', 'had', 'coats', 'things', 'that.How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'last', 'true', 'Cinerama', 'film', 'been', 'given', 'restoration', 'worthy', 'whole', 'remarkable', 'Cinerama', 'enterprise']",How the West Was Won

142353,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,0792839072,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[38, 43]","[I wrote this DVD review of ""How the West Was Won"" a while ago, but I have added this paragraph to account for a third DVD, released 22 May 2007, as part of a set called ""The John Wayne Collection.""  This third DVD by Warner is the same as MGM's 1998 release.  There has been no DVD re-mastering effort.  All three DVDs have precisely the same content, and so all the information within my following review about the 2000 Warner release can be applied to ""The John Wayne Collection"" DVD of Warner in 2007.  Of special importance is how it wrongly states the disc is an anamorphic DVD.  It is not anamorphic.]There are two [three] DVDs of ""How the West Was Won"" (1962) available in the U.S.MGM Video's earlier disc (released on 28 July 1998) and Warner Video's second disc (released 12 Sept. 2000) [and Warner's third disc of 22 May 2007] have EXACTLY THE SAME DISC CONTENT!  Even the menus are the same!  They both contain the film's theatrical trailer and contain the same ""Making Of"" documentary with a run time of 15:30.  The only difference is the earlier MGM release also includes an 8-page booklet with large essays filling all but the cover pages, including a section about the ""800 pounds"" of Cinerama camera equipment used for this spectacle; that plus a plastic DVD box.  The later Warner release uses the cardboard case, but even its cover art does not match the disc menu screens as does the earlier MGM release.This movie with its Cinerama glory deserves a place on the shelf of video collectors involved with American cinema culture.  If one wants to buy this movie on DVD, opt for the earlier edition with the booklet.  I noticed the DVDs (having the same exact imagery) have four negatives: the extremely wide screen image is only letterboxed and not anamorphic DVD, the theatrical 7-track audio has been degraded to 4-channel matrix-encoded Dolby audio, the DVD picture image suffers from film scratches and dirt, and Ted Turner's logo appears BETWEEN the prologue overture and the beginning of the film.  Nevertheless, the great music is worth the price, alone.  I was never a fan of the movie, but it was one of the single most ambitious film projects ever and cost a fortune!  This film is a crucial landmark of a cultural evolution in American cinema and any collector serious about American film culture needs this DVD.  Of course, the great John Ford directed one segment, but also the famous Henry Hathaway and George Marshall directed their segments of this film.An interesting part of the documentary focuses on the ideas and investments behind the three-camera Cinerama format and three-screen Super Cinerama theater used for this film.  Despite the success, only two fictional films used the three-, angled-screen Cinerama format: this movie and ""the Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" (1962), the George Pal stop-motion extravaganza.  Cinerama was next re-formulated into a single camera process for a curved screen using a 65mm image on Ultra Panavision 70 film, and these newer camera processes weighed a lot less than the original Cinerama cameras.  The first film made in the latter process was a comedy, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963) and, according to that DVD, the carpet had been laid in the first of the new single curved-screen Super Cinerama theaters only three days before this comedy's release.  The re-formulated Cinerama/Ultra Panavision 70 cameras were so light, Director John Frankenheimer had them mounted onto Formula Three racecars (dressed as Formula One cars) for his 1966 film, ""Grand Prix.""The most critically acclaimed and remembered film made for Cinerama three-screen OR curved-screen theaters was ""2001: a Space Odyssey"" (1968).  Read Roger Ebert's website reviews of this movie.  Both, Ebert's original review from 1968 and the review from its re-release of 1997 appear on his website.Movies made before 1952 were predominantly black and white.  Because studios blamed theater ticket sale diminishment on television, film studios either invented new technologies or reinvented existing ones such as Cinerama, which at least appears very similar to Abel Gance's use of three camera images during the battle scenes of his 1927 silent epic, ""Napoleon.""  Some of the fads blossoming during the `50s and `60s and remaining today are the use of Cinemascope anamorphic lenses, wide-screen panoramic films, color photography, epic plots, large-budget movies, multi-track stereophonic audio, and other artistic special effects.  Some of the fads not quite permanent were stop motion animation like the works of Ray Harryhausen, loud musicals, ""3-D"" movies, and Cinerama.However, some ideological remnants of the Super Cinerama remain with another distant format: IMAX.  Both processes use curved screens about 110-feet wide although an IMAX screen is dome-shaped because it is twice as high, they both use at least 6 discrete tracks of audio, and they both use theaters specifically designed for exhibitions using their processes.One of Cinerama and IMAX's fundamental differences is that IMAX's fictional movies are usually transferred from pre-existing wide-screen movies into the IMAX format whereas, unlike IMAX, the fictional movies in Cinerama were made FOR their Super Cinerama theaters.  For instance, the IMAX production of ""Apollo 13"" cropped the original Super 35 film images having a length-to-width ratio of 2.39:1 down into a ratio of 1.66:1 enlarged, according to Ebert's website.  Although ""How the West Was Won"" was mostly shot in its system of three images, some of it was actually shot in Ultra Panavision 70, the second Cinerama format, and optically converted into three-image Cinerama, according to Widescreen Review's website.  This means that, even when Cinerama originally meant three screens, it still utilized Ultra Panavision 70 photography for part of ""How the West Was Won,"" the first of the two fictional films using three-screen Super Cinerama Theaters.The studio had researched volumes for ""How the West Was Won"" and the Cinerama process, which was one of the many efforts to re-invent the cinema during the 1950s and '60s.  In 1963, when ""How the West Was Won"" released into Cinerama theaters, it was a huge hit and played for nearly two years.Today, no three-screen Super Cinerama theater remains, and almost all (if not yet all) single-, curved-screen Super Cinerama theaters have vanished.  For the sake of American culture, the government should do something to protect at least one of these theaters.  America needs some history of culture to protect and a Super Cinerama theater seems worth saving since the cinema provides the largest venue of American entertainment today.  The Super Cinerama theater is a landmark of American culture.",3,DVD Comparative Review and Re-Inventing the American Cinema Culture,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,6740,"['[', 'wrote', 'DVD', 'review',

142354,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,0792839072,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[5, 5]","I remember seeing How the West Was Won at the Cooper Cinerama Theater in Minneapolis when I was in my teens, so for me this was high nostalgia.  I enjoyed the color, the setting, the action, the musical score and the popular stars of my childhood.  Debbie Reynolds was pretty and full of youthful energy;  Gregory Peck was still young enough to be considered handsome; and Thelma Ritter, a popular character actress from the 40s and 50s, was still her curmudgeonly self.  However my husband, who is considerably younger than I, found the plot plodding and predictable, the introduction of song into the story intrusive and manipulative (to quote: &quot;I can see why musicals died out, and not a minute too soon in my opinion!&quot;), and the mismatched &quot;screens&quot; of the cinerama projection method a great disappointment.  I have to admit that the film wasn't quite as impressive in video form as it had been on the big curved screen of the Cooper Theater.I think more than anything How the West Was Won captures a sense of the time during which the film was first made and enjoyed.  1962, when cinerama was a new &quot;high tech&quot; entertainment, was still a time when everything seemed possible.  The adults of middle class USA had the laurels of WWII to bolster their sense of control, and they were still young enough to enjoy life, their families, and their careers.  Now they are most of them in their 70s and 80s, retired, elderly, frail adults no longer in control of their own lives.  In the early 60s, the rebellious youth of the Rock and Roll era were still naive enough to believe that good will and good intentions could fix what was wrong with the world.  Now many of them are themselves older adults, disappointed in the world's unwillingness to be &quot;fixed,&quot; concerned about their own future, gradually losing control over the events of which they are a part, and facing a world that changes not yearly or even monthly but weekly and even daily.Although I know I wouldn't be happy to go back in time to the 1960s, that today in fact is as good as the &quot;old days&quot; get, I can't help enjoying a brief visit to those hopeful, energetic, and more innocent times.  Sometimes I just need to get off of the Merry-go-round that high tech life has created.  I have, however, given up on expecting my husband to share my sentiments.  He wasn't there, so he just can't share them.  Definitely more of a film for those who were young in the 60s!",4,High nostolgia value,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,2478,"['remember', 'seeing', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'Cooper', 'Cinerama', 'Theater', 'Minneapolis', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'so', 'was', 'high', 'nostalgia', 'enjoyed', 'color', 'setting', 'action', 'musical', 'score', 'popular', 'stars', 'childhood', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'pretty', 'full', 'youthful', 'energy', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'considered', 'handsome', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'popular', 'character', 'actress', '40s', '50s', 'was', 'still', 'curmudgeonly', 'self', 'However', 'husband', 'who', 'considerably', 'younger', 'found', 'plot', 'plodding', 'predictable', 'introduction', 'song', 'story', 'intrusive', 'manipulative', 'quote', 'quot', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'musicals', 'died', 'out', 'not', 'minute', 'too', 'soon', 'opinion', 'quot', 'mismatched', 'quot', 'screens', 'quot', 'cinerama', 'projection', 'great', 'disappointment', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'impressive', 'video', 'form', 'had', 'been', 'big', 'curved', 'screen', 'Cooper', 'Theater.I', 'think', 'more', 'anything', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'sense', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'enjoyed', '1962', 'when', 'cinerama', 'was', 'new', 'quot', 'high', 'tech', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'was', 'still', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'seemed', 'possible', 'adults', 'middle', 'class', 'USA', 'had', 'laurels', 'WWII', 'bolster', 'sense', 'control', 'were', 'still', 'young', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'life', 'families', 'careers', 'Now', 'are', 'most', '70s', '80s', 'retired', 'elderly', 'frail', 'adults', 'no', 'longer', 'control', 'own', 'lives', 'early', '60s', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'era', 'were', 'still', 'naive', 'enough', 'believe', 'good', 'will', 'good', 'intentions', 'could', 'fix', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'world', 'Now', 'many', 'are', 'older', 'adults', 'disappointed', 'world', 'unwillingness', 'be', 'quot', 'fixed', 'quot', 'concerned', 'own', 'future', 'gradually', 'losing', 'control', 'events', 'are', 'part', 'facing', 'world', 'not', 'yearly', 'even', 'monthly', 'weekly', 'even', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'go', 'back', 'time', '1960s', 'today', 'fact', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'old', 'days', 'quot', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoying', 'brief', 'visit', 'hopeful', 'energetic', 'more', 'innocent', 'times', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'get', 'Merry-go-round', 'high', 'tech', 'life', 'created', 'have', 'however', 'given', 'up', 'expecting', 'husband', 'share', 'sentiments', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'share', 'Definitely', 'more', 'film', 'who', 'were', 'young', '60s']",How the West Was Won

142356,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0792839072,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","This is a big movie, full of stars. It follows the story of one family primarily, with Debbie Reynolds playing the central character, Gregory Peck her lover and/or husband. But most of Hollywood got into this act: Carrol Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden, George Peppard, James Stewart, Eli Wallach, John Wayne, and a host of other favorites, such as Andy Devine and Henry Morgan, who incongruously plays U.S. Grant.Starting with the Erie Canal, much of the story is the transportation methods used to get west, and most of the rest is fighting Indians and outlaws. There are mountain men, river pirates, shooting white-water rapids on a home-made raft (not intentionally; they took the wrong fork of the river), St. Louis, of course. A major segment involves a wagon train westward, but there are gold miners, civil war scenes, railroad builders, buffalo hunters, San Francisco mansions, Arizona red rocks, and a thrilling train robbery finale. This movie has it all, including Debbie Reynolds singing and dancing in some pretty tough houses in some pretty scanty costumes.The music is grand, the scenery and costumes are well done, and with all those stars, you'd think it would be a huge hit. Well, it was. But there's only so much you can put into a single movie, even a rather long one (155 minutes).

142357,AO37T54VEP0JQ,0792839072,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[5, 7]","Not the sweeping chronicle of historical events as the title might suggest to you, but rather the story of one family's move to the West and the effects and changes that shape each member through three generations.  The movie is heavily peppered with an All-Star cast, but that isn't necessary as the story is good on it's own terms.  With the exception of George Peppard and Debbie Reynolds everyone else appears in what could be best classified as a 'glorified cameo'.  Peppard makes the strongest impression as Zeb Rawlings, veteran of the Civil War who later serves as the military liaison officer for the railroad, which is moving ever westward.  Reynolds is Lily Prescott who continually overcomes the odds against her and survives into old age.  Other cast members that stand out include Karl Malden as the Prescott family patriarch who begins the family's move west; Carroll Baker as Malden's daughter and Reynolds's sister Dora; and especially Henry Fonda as the practical and durable plainsman Jethro Stuart featured in ""The Railroad"" sequence of the film.A stampeding buffalo herd that tramples a pioneer settlement under its hooves and a hairy and sensational shootout on a rapidly moving train are the action highlights, but they don't come until the final 25 minutes of the movie.  There are other rousing scenes such as the Prescott's wild ride down the river rapids and a little while later an Indian attack but they come off as fairly routine, having that sense of 'd&eacute;j&agrave; vu' to it.  Reynolds adds some great punch to the film in several musical numbers that she performs periodically throughout, working as a showgirl to support herself in different venues.Ironically, the Western genre's larger-than-life icon, John Wayne, receives barely five minutes of screen time - and he doesn't even appear as a Westerner.  He plays General Sherman to Henry Morgan's General Grant in ""The Civil War"" sequence of the film.  The entire scene is inconsequential to the rest of the movie, showing the two generals lamenting over their battlefield decisions, which have caused an incredible loss of life at Shiloh.  It serves only to allow Union soldier Peppard to act as a hero, preventing a would-be assassin from taking either of the two's lives.A major drawback to 'How The West Was Won' is its ethnocentric view of history.  The Native Americans played a huge part in the successful settlement of the Western US but they receive only the standard Hollywood treatment.  Not until the final ""The Railroad"" sequence do they get any substantial screen time, but even so this is for the purpose of establishing Peppard's character as a friend of the Indians, the Arapahos in this case.  One other slight disadvantage is the lack of dramatic continuity, which is due to the film's efforts to provide its big name cast with screen time.'How The West Was Won' was filmed in a technique that employed three cameras to capture each shot and was presented in theaters that same way.  Unfortunately it doesn't transfer to DVD too well and it is clear to see the seams or separate frames often throughout the film.  To truly appreciate this movie it should be seen on the big screen when possible, it is as visually impressive as many of the Hollywood action oriented mega blockbusters of today.",4,How The West Was Won...in the standard Hollywood tradition,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,3303,"['Not', 'sweeping', 'chronicle', 'historical', 'events', 'title', 'might', 'suggest', 'rather', 'story', 'one', 'family', 'move', 'West', 'effects', 'changes', 'shape', 'member', 'three', 'generations', 'movie', 'heavily', 'peppered', 'All-Star', 'cast', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'story', 'good', 'own', 'terms', 'exception', 'George', 'Peppard', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'everyone', 'else', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'classified', ""'glorified"", 'cameo', 'Peppard', 'strongest', 'impression', 'Zeb', 'Rawlings', 'veteran', 'Civil', 'War', 'who', 'later', 'military', 'liaison', 'officer', 'railroad', 'moving', 'ever', 'westward', 'Reynolds', 'Lily', 'Prescott', 'who', 'continually', 'odds', 'old', 'age', 'Other', 'cast', 'members', 'stand', 'out', 'include', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Prescott', 'family', 'patriarch', 'who', 'family', 'move', 'west', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Malden', 'daughter', 'Reynolds', 'sister', 'Dora', 'especially', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'practical', 'durable', 'plainsman', 'Jethro', 'Stuart', 'featured', 'Railroad', 'sequence', 'film.A', 'stampeding', 'buffalo', 'herd', 'pioneer', 'settlement', 'hooves', 'hairy', 'sensational', 'shootout', 'rapidly', 'moving', 'train', 'are', 'action', 'highlights', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'final', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'rousing', 'scenes', 'such', 'Prescott', 'wild', 'ride', 'river', 'rapids', 'little', 'later', 'Indian', 'attack', 'come', 'off', 'fairly', 'routine', 'having', 'sense', ""'d"", 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'Reynolds', 'great', 'punch', 'film', 'several', 'musical', 'numbers', 'periodically', 'working', 'showgirl', 'support', 'different', 'venues.Ironically', 'Western', 'genre', 'larger-than-life', 'icon', 'John', 'Wayne', 'barely', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'Westerner', 'General', 'Sherman', 'Henry', 'Morgan', 'General', 'Grant', 'Civil', 'War', 'sequence', 'film', 'entire', 'scene', 'inconsequential', 'rest', 'movie', 'showing', 'two', 'generals', 'lamenting', 'battlefield', 'decisions', 'have', 'caused', 'incredible', 'loss', 'life', 'Shiloh', 'only', 'allow', 'Union', 'soldier', 'Peppard', 'act', 'hero', 'preventing', 'would-be', 'assassin', 'taking', 'two', 'lives.A', 'major', 'drawback', ""'How"", 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'ethnocentric', 'view', 'history', 'Native', 'Americans', 'played', 'huge', 'part', 'successful', 'settlement', 'Western', 'US', 'receive', 'only', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'Not', 'final', 'Railroad', 'sequence', 'do', 'get', 'substantial', 'screen', 'time', 'even', 'so', 'purpose', 'establishing', 'Peppard', 'character', 'friend', 'Indians', 'Arapahos', 'case', 'One', 'other', 'slight', 'disadvantage', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'continuity', 'due', 'film', 'efforts', 'provide', 'big', 'name', 'cast', 'screen', 'time', ""'How"", 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'was', 'filmed', 'technique', 'employed', 'three', 'cameras', 'capture', 'shot', 'was', 'presented', 'theaters', 'same', 'way', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'DVD', 'too', 'well', 'clear', 'see', 'seams', 'separate', 'frames', 'often', 'film', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'possible', 'visually', 'impressive', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'oriented', 'mega', 'blockbusters', 'today']",How the West Was Won
142358,A1QN17E9RNFDYB,0792839072,"Beacon Light ""keeper""","[3, 7]","I remember seeing this film when it was first released many years ago.  At that time I found it extremely boring; but then there was a great cast with the likes of James Stewart, Carol Baker (known back in the day), Debbie Reynolds, Henry Fonda (very small part), Karl Malden, even the great Agnus Moorhead, and others.  I remembered that but forgot just why I thought it boring.  I have matured considerably since that time so thought I would give it another go.Same thing only more so.  Now I know why.  This is a film which could have been a great epic; but it is disjointed and at times hard to follow.  Lots of action sometimes and slow as molassas others.  It lacks much in historical flavor as some do today with inserted folk and other songs done by Debbie Reynolds.  You believe  she was great in Vegas but in this epic..no way.  And the romances seem to dominate compared to any vestige of authenticity. Very Hollywoodish!Jimmy Stewart was hardly believeable as the mountain man turned  farmer for the love of a much younger Carol Baker.  Probably the best player was George Peppard as their son who ages to become a sheriff married to Carolyn Jones. And Robert Preston stands out (as he always did) but is extremely miscast as the wannabee husband of Debbie Reynolds.  Obviously though he was inhibited in this tale by some very bad dialogue with Reynolds. Gregory Peck, the gambler who showing no effort wins the heart of Reynolds, mainly plays Gregory Peck and that not very well.And a pop corn role for Raymond Massey as Abe Lincoln in a scene really not necessary.  All was easily forgotten and all will again be such.  John Ford directed the Civil War sequence which, of course, meant John Wayne had a small part in that (as General Sherman) but what was it he said?All I can see is that the cinematography for that day is excellent.

Add to this one of the most entertaining, informative Audio Commentary tracks I've ever listened to, and you have a DVD that is truly worth owning!Taking a moment to reflect on the Commentary...I am disappointed that no 'Making of...' video has been made, as ""How the West Was Won"", with it's stellar cast, legendary directors, and massive production, certainly deserves one. But the Audio Commentary makes a sincere effort to make up for it, offering information on the locations, how the extraordinary shots were created, and backstories about casting and the production. A surprising bit of HTWWW trivia: Did you know that Bing Crosby was originally slated to narrate the film, with Spencer Tracy to portray Ulysses S. Grant? (The reason Tracy switched to narrating isn't explained in the Commentary, but I am familiar with what happened; Tracy collapsed at his home, prior to filming, and had to be rushed by ambulance to the UCLA Hospital; under doctor's orders to rest, he was unable to perform in a role, but still wanted to participate in some manner, so Crosby, graciously, gave up the narration to him). A health issue created another change, as well; Dimitri Tiomkin, the contracted composer of the musical score, broke his leg, and had to be replaced by Alfred Newman, who did a magnificent job. Another surprising fact: Hope Lange was originally cast to play George Peppard's wife, with a long subplot revealing she was Henry Fonda's daughter, first seen working as a showgirl at the railroad camp, where she was courted by both Peppard and Richard Widmark. Despite some scenes being filmed, it was decided the subplot took too much time from the main storyline, so her scenes were cut, and reshot to remove any reference to her, with Carolyn Jones cast in a far shorter version of her role, for the final sequence of the film.Much more is included in the Commentary, which really encourages a viewer to watch the film at least twice!The third DVD in the collection (the first two discs are of the film, itself), is devoted to a long history of the Cinerama process, from it's roots during the silent era, it's value during WWII as a training tool, the spectacular, and once, tragic, Cinerama travelogues, through the decision to scrap the 'three-camera' process in favor of a less difficult 70mm 'single-camera' process (HTWWW would be the last film using the original format), and it's ultimate demise, in favor of less costly formats. As someone whose first Cinerama experience was the 'single-camera' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", the documentary makes me wish I'd experienced the superior 'three-camera' films, with full stereophonic sound, on a giant curved screen!Lots of reproductions of original release promotional materials are included in the package, as well, which are fun to browse through, while you're watching the film.Entertaining, educational, fun...""How the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition)"" is all this, and MUCH more!",5,Superb Remastering Job and Audio Commentary Highlight Edition...,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,3346,"[""'ve"", 'avoided', 'purchasing', ""'Cinerama'-formatted"", 'widescreen', 'DVDs', 'past', 'irritating', 'lines', 'indicating', 'camera', 'often', 'blurry', 'images', ""'re"", 'treat', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'removed', 'lines', 'restored', 'depth', 'detail', 'richness', 'color', 'superb', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'lacking', 'previous', 'edition', 'Add', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'tracks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'listened', 'have', 'DVD', 'truly', 'worth', 'owning', 'Taking', 'moment', 'reflect', 'Commentary', 'am', 'disappointed', ""'Making"", 'video', 'been', 'made', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'stellar', 'cast', 'legendary', 'directors', 'massive', 'production', 'certainly', 'one', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'sincere', 'effort', 'make', 'up', 'offering', 'information', 'locations', 'how', 'extraordinary', 'shots', 'were', 'created', 'backstories', 'casting', 'production', 'surprising', 'bit', 'HTWWW', 'trivia', 'Did', 'know', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'narrate', 'film', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'portray', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'reason', 'Tracy', 'switched', 'narrating', ""n't"", 'explained', 'Commentary', 'am', 'familiar', 'what', 'happened', 'Tracy', 'collapsed', 'home', 'prior', 'filming', 'had', 'be', 'rushed', 'ambulance', 'UCLA', 'Hospital', 'doctor', 'orders', 'rest', 'was', 'unable', 'perform', 'role', 'still', 'wanted', 'participate', 'manner', 'so', 'Crosby', 'graciously', 'gave', 'up', 'narration', 'health', 'issue', 'created', 'change', 'well', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'contracted', 'composer', 'musical', 'score', 'broke', 'leg', 'had', 'be', 'replaced', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'who', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'surprising', 'fact', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'was', 'originally', 'cast', 'play', 'George', 'Peppard', 'wife', 'long', 'subplot', 'revealing', 'was', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'daughter', 'first', 'seen', 'working', 'showgirl', 'railroad', 'camp', 'where', 'was', 'courted', 'Peppard', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'scenes', 'being', 'filmed', 'was', 'decided', 'subplot', 'took', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'main', 'storyline', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'reshot', 'remove', 'reference', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'cast', 'far', 'shorter', 'version', 'role', 'final', 'sequence', 'film.Much', 'more', 'included', 'Commentary', 'really', 'viewer', 'watch', 'film', 'least', 'twice', 'third', 'DVD', 'collection', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'are', 'film', 'devoted', 'long', 'history', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'roots', 'silent', 'era', 'value', 'WWII', 'training', 'tool', 'spectacular', 'once', 'tragic', 'Cinerama', 'travelogues', 'decision', 'scrap', ""'three-camera"", 'process', 'favor', 'less', 'difficult', '70mm', ""'single-camera"", 'process', 'HTWWW', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'using', 'original', 'format', 'ultimate', 'demise', 'favor', 'less', 'costly', 'formats', 'someone', 'first', 'Cinerama', 'experience', 'was', ""'single-camera"", '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'documentary', 'wish', ""'d"", 'experienced', 'superior', ""'three-camera"", 'films', 'full', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'giant', 'curved', 'screen', 'Lots', 'reproductions', 'original', 'release', 'promotional', 'materials', 'are', 'included', 'package', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'fun', 'browse', ""'re"", 'watching', 'film.Entertaining', 'educational', 'fun', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'Ultimate', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'MUCH', 'more']",How the West Was Won

I'm glad I sat through it, as the story is impressive and very enjoyable.  It's not for everyone, but if you're into sorta-kinda-historical movies about the early US, this is a great choice.I'd love to see a digitally-restored version of this, as it wouldn't be too difficult to fix the alignmnent issues.  But I suspect that it would be fairly expensive to do--not only are there three separate pieces of film to have to deal with, but it's a very long movie... and the film has obviously deteriorated quite a bit over the years.I'll give it three stars just because it's a great movie, but as other folks have pointed out--it's simply not a good transfer.

142369,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,0792839072,Byron Kolln,"[8, 8]","MGM's mammoth, Cinerama epic HOW THE WEST WAS WON has never looked or sounded better than in this new state-of-the-art High Definition digital restoration, eliminating the ""join lines"" to create an impressive vista screen; which is even more scrumptious on Blu Ray.HOW THE WEST WAS WON was one of two Cinerama movies released by MGM in 1962 (the other being ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"").  Covering the years 1838 through 1889, the story revolves around the fates and fortunes of the Prescott family as they attempt to tame the wilds of the western frontier.  The first half of the movie focuses on daughter Lilith (Debbie Reynolds), whose journey takes her across the Erie Canal, then along the great wagon-train migration and finally into the arms of handsome gambler Cleve van Valen (Gregory Peck).In the second act, we meet Lilith's nephew Zeb (George Peppard), who leaves the small Prescott farm to fight in the Civil War; going on to become a marshall in peace-time.  The historical sweep of HOW THE WEST WAS WON is the main reason why it's still so incredibly entertaining all these years later; and miraculously--despite being directed by no less than four great filmmakers (John Ford, Henry Hathaway, George Marshall and Richard Thorpe)--it does feel like one unified piece.Despite it's reputation as a star-studded extravaganza, in truth the film quite rightly belongs to Debbie Reynolds and George Peppard who play the key roles in both acts of the story; but the supporting gallery of players--very impressive even by today's standards--boasts Carroll Baker, John Wayne, Karl Malden, Robert Preston, Eli Wallach and Richard Widmark.The Blu Ray release includes a bonus 'Smilebox' print of the film, which replicates the curved Cinerama screen experience--quite a treat!  The Cinerama process involved using three 35mm cameras to capture a scene and then projecting them side-by-side onto a louvered 3-panel screen; making it larger than most other 'scope' processes.

I saw this movie when it was first released in 1962 at the Ambassador theater in St. Louis, Missouri. Interestingly enough the same place the documentary mentions at it's beginning. It was an experience I will never forget. This movie has been restored so well you will rarely know this was filmed with three cameras. But the vistas of the West will truly amaze you for a 46 year old movie. The movie has a very well known cast for that period and the story is compelling. A family heads West down a river in Ohio and ends up in California and then Arizona. How they live and die over the course of a lifetime is inspiring. Fans of movie history will especially get a kick out of this movie and the documentary on Cinerama. The process rivals IMAX even today. I highly recommend this piece of cinematic history. The Blu-ray version is magnificent quality and has plenty of replayability.

142371,AKV2BGUT50B1X,0792839072,Carl Robinson,"[0, 0]","How the West was Won is an epic movie with an all star cast of actors as well as directors that shows the winning of the west by Americans.The story starts in the late 1830s-the flag shown in the River Pirate's lair has 26 stars thus the start is sometime around 1837.  The story ends in the late 1880s.Central to the story are the lives and loves of two sisters, Eve and Lilith Prescott. Both women seek their husbands and their fortunes in the wilderness, and in the process they and their families become essential to taming the west.  Eve's son in particular goes on to fight in the Civil War, protect the railroad until Gilded Age business ethics become too much for him, and then carve out a niche for himself and his family in Arizona Territory.In many ways the movie is beyond the normal Western genre of White Hats and Black Hats.  It is a profoundly deep history lesson with riveting, witty, and truthful dialogue.What makes this movie so moving, so forward and beyond other westerns is the music of Alfred Newman (1901-1970.)  Indeed Newman is quite possibly one of the greatest composers ever to have graced Hollywood.  His music has the touch of King David and his Lyre.  Each note of the musical score is perfect.  The music is in every way expressive, running across all the  emotions of humanity in its struggle on this Earth.Five Stars!",5,A Great Western Epic,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1353,"['How', 'West', 'was', 'Won', 'epic', 'movie', 'star', 'cast', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'directors', 'winning', 'west', 'Americans.The', 'story', 'late', '1830s-the', 'flag', 'shown', 'River', 'Pirate', 'lair', '26', 'stars', 'thus', 'start', 'sometime', '1837', 'story', 'late', '1880s.Central', 'story', 'are', 'lives', 'loves', 'two', 'sisters', 'Eve', 'Lilith', 'Prescott', 'women', 'seek', 'husbands', 'fortunes', 'wilderness', 'process', 'families', 'become', 'essential', 'taming', 'west', 'Eve', 'son', 'particular', 'fight', 'Civil', 'War', 'protect', 'railroad', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'business', 'ethics', 'become', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'carve', 'out', 'niche', 'family', 'Arizona', 'Territory.In', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'normal', 'Western', 'genre', 'White', 'Hats', 'Black', 'Hats', 'profoundly', 'deep', 'history', 'lesson', 'riveting', 'witty', 'truthful', 'dialogue.What', 'movie', 'so', 'moving', 'so', 'forward', 'other', 'westerns', 'music', 'Alfred', 'Newman', '1901-1970', 'Indeed', 'Newman', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'greatest', 'composers', 'ever', 'have', 'graced', 'Hollywood', 'music', 'touch', 'King', 'David', 'Lyre', 'note', 'musical', 'score', 'perfect', 'music', 'way', 'expressive', 'running', 'emotions', 'humanity', 'struggle', 'Earth.Five', 'Stars']",How the West Was Won

142376,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,0792839072,Chrijeff,"[8, 9]","...I'd give it five stars.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the onscreen &quot;seams&quot; left over by the three-camera Cinerama project are distracting, and of course the film loses something by transfer to a small TV screen.  But otherwise it is both a classic and a family epic.  (If you can find the souvenier program book, it's well worth a look; mine, among other things, tells me that the costumes--literally thousands--were all sewn by hand because the Cinerama cameras picked up on machine sewing.  And Louis L'Amour's novelization, which may still be available secondhand, both follows the script closely and expands upon some of the information given on-screen.)  Beginning c. 1830 with Zebulon Prescott (Malden), his wife and four children (two nubile daughters, a near-grown son and an ailing smaller one) on their way &quot;down the O-hi-o,&quot; it continues through elder daughter Eve's (Baker) love-at-first-sight meeting with eastbound mountain man Linus Rawlings (Stewart), younger sister Lilith's (Reynolds) trek West during the Gold Rush and her eventual union with gambler Cleve Van Valen (Peck), the service of Eve's elder son Zeb (Peppard) in the Civil War and later in the Cavalry guarding the transcontinental railroad a-building, and finally his reunion with widowed Aunt Lilith, who wants him to take over as foreman of her ranch in Arizona Territory, and a confrontation with old nemesis outlaw Charley Gant (Wallach) that climaxes in a heart-in-your-mouth gun duel aboard a runaway train.  Indeed, each of the five major divisions of the movie includes one or more edge-of-the-seat sequences--a brawl with river pirates and a deadly raft trip through rapids in the first, a running battle between Cheyenne raiders and a westbound wagon train in the second, battle sequences full of cannonades and cavalry charges in the third, and a buffalo stampede through the railroad construction camp in the fourth.  Like &quot;Around the World in 80 Days,&quot; another favorite of mine, it also seethes with Big Names in cameo roles, among the best of them being Fonda as buffalo hunter and ex-mountain-man Jethro Stuart, Ritter as the man-hungry lady blacksmith Aggie Clegg, Brennan as the leader of the pirate gang, Preston as wagonmaster Roger Morgan, and Widmark as heartless rail construction boss Mike King.  (Spencer Tracy's rich-voiced narration is another plus.)  By relating the westward movement to the experiences of a single family, it succeeds as a drama (though necessarily an episodic one) and makes the history seem more accessible.  The whole family should enjoy it.",4,If only they could smooth out the picture...,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,2608,"[""'d"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'onscreen', 'quot', 'quot', 'left', 'over', 'three-camera', 'Cinerama', 'project', 'are', 'distracting', 'course', 'film', 'something', 'transfer', 'small', 'TV', 'screen', 'classic', 'family', 'epic', 'can', 'find', 'souvenier', 'program', 'book', 'well', 'look', 'mine', 'other', 'things', 'tells', 'costumes', 'literally', 'thousands', 'were', 'sewn', 'hand', 'Cinerama', 'cameras', 'picked', 'up', 'machine', 'sewing', 'Louis', ""L'Amour"", 'novelization', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'available', 'secondhand', 'script', 'closely', 'information', 'given', 'on-screen', 'Beginning', 'c.', '1830', 'Zebulon', 'Prescott', 'Malden', 'wife', 'four', 'children', 'two', 'daughters', 'near-grown', 'son', 'ailing', 'smaller', 'one', 'way', 'quot', 'O-hi-o', 'quot', 'elder', 'daughter', 'Eve', 'Baker', 'love-at-first-sight', 'meeting', 'eastbound', 'mountain', 'man', 'Linus', 'Rawlings', 'Stewart', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lilith', 'Reynolds', 'trek', 'West', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'eventual', 'union', 'gambler', 'Cleve', 'Van', 'Valen', 'Peck', 'service', 'Eve', 'elder', 'son', 'Zeb', 'Peppard', 'Civil', 'War', 'later', 'Cavalry', 'guarding', 'transcontinental', 'railroad', 'a-building', 'finally', 'reunion', 'widowed', 'Aunt', 'Lilith', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'foreman', 'ranch', 'Arizona', 'Territory', 'confrontation', 'old', 'nemesis', 'outlaw', 'Charley', 'Gant', 'Wallach', 'climaxes', 'heart-in-your-mouth', 'gun', 'duel', 'runaway', 'train', 'Indeed', 'five', 'major', 'divisions', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'sequences', 'brawl', 'river', 'pirates', 'deadly', 'raft', 'trip', 'rapids', 'first', 'running', 'battle', 'Cheyenne', 'raiders', 'westbound', 'wagon', 'train', 'second', 'battle', 'sequences', 'full', 'cannonades', 'cavalry', 'charges', 'third', 'buffalo', 'stampede', 'railroad', 'construction', 'camp', 'fourth', 'quot', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'quot', 'favorite', 'mine', 'also', 'Big', 'Names', 'cameo', 'roles', 'best', 'being', 'Fonda', 'buffalo', 'hunter', 'ex-mountain-man', 'Jethro', 'Stuart', 'Ritter', 'man-hungry', 'lady', 'blacksmith', 'Aggie', 'Clegg', 'Brennan', 'leader', 'pirate', 'gang', 'Preston', 'wagonmaster', 'Roger', 'Morgan', 'Widmark', 'heartless', 'rail', 'construction', 'Mike', 'King', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'rich-voiced', 'narration', 'plus', 'relating', 'westward', 'movement', 'experiences', 'single', 'family', 'drama', 'necessarily', 'episodic', 'one', 'history', 'seem', 'more', 'accessible', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'enjoy']",How the West Was Won

142386,AECVYXIL9791R,0792839072,David C. Read,"[3, 5]","By the late 1950s, everyone had a television, and they were staying home to watch it, rather than going out to the theater.  Movie attendance was way down from what it had been in the 1940s.  Moviemakers tried various gimmicks to make theater attendence an ""event"" and thereby draw people out of their living rooms and into movie theaters.  One of these gimmicks was Cinerama, which was a type of widescreen presentation that wrapped around the audience on the edges of the screen.  The process used three cameras and three projectors to achieve the effect.  At first, only travelogs were shot using the 3 camera process, but someone had the idea to shoot a feature film.  So they approved a big budget (at the time) of $15,000,000, and gathered a cast of thousands, including some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, Richard Widmark, John Wayne, etc.You need to see this in a Cinerama theater to really appreciate it.  Although there are many good performances in the movie, it feels gimmicky.  First of all, the seams between the cameras are very obvious.  Throughout the movie, you will see two vertical bars dividing the screen real estate into three tracts.  Also, because TV has a flat screen, and the middle panel is not recessed as it was in Cinerama, some of the action close to the camera in the middle panel jumps out, freakishly, at the viewer.  There are also dots and scratches galore.  Obviously, no attempt was made to digitally clean up the film.Moreover, it feels like the film's plot was made to be the servant of the action sequences it wanted to show off using the Cinerama process.  There's a trip down the rapids on a raft, an indian charge on a wagon train, a wagon race away from the indians, a buffalo stampede, and a running gunfight on a train.  All of this was designed to be viewed in a Cinerama theater, giving the audience a thrill ride that simply could not be matched at home in front of small (probably black and white) Television.  So, I can appreciate why this was a big event movie in 1962.  And you can understand why it is not quite an event as a DVD watching experience in 2005.

142387,A3A79TR2BYC1AK,0792839072,"David Joachim ""TV Dave""","[4, 4]","Wide screen movies (for that matter, widescreen TV) owe their existence to Cinerama, an odd format that premiered in 1952. The high def film process required three cameras for filming and three projectors for exhibition on a deeply curved screen. It was a cumbersome, unwieldy method of moviemaking more appropriate for travelogues in the 1950s. Hollywood struggled with the process when they made two narrative films using the system. HOW THE WEST WAS WON was the better of the two. For years it was poorly served when shown on conventional television. The standard 4x3 aspect ratio and diminished resolution couldn't begin to showcase the power of a movie that once sparkled on 96 foot screens with surround sound and gut-wrenching visuals. Along comes BluRay technology with its superior resolution and sound reproduction, and Cinerama finally gets a chance to demonstrate why it was so revolutionary in post World War 2 moviemaking. This version of the movie has a second disc that offers a new letterbox version called Smilebox. The film is presented in the same curvature that moviegoers experienced in the early 1960s, when they were engulfed by the enormous curved screen. New computer technology is put to even better use with the virtual elimination of the once-visible lines that separated the three panels.

As a young spud, how I remember what a big, big deal it was to take in a movie filmed in what was then state-of-the-art virtual technology.  Yesterday's Cinerama was today's Imax; only back then Cinerama was available in such limited theaters and locations it was an extra special event just to experience it.  And of the handful of Cinerama productions, the film most closely associated with the process was the 1962 epic HOW THE WEST WAS WON.  And this ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITION is grand entertainment. . .but not necessarily because of the movie itself.The movie.  Of course, the visuals were, and are, impressive, but the story of two families settling (and taming) the West over some 50 years in the mid-19th Century suffered from what so many other films of that period suffered from:  gushy melodrama; cliches and stereotypes; grandiose overacting.  Is it grand fun to watch, say, Henry Fonda and George Peppard share a scene?  Sure.  But you also are guaranteed to experience a handful of cliches and maybe one or two more ""gosh darn it!""s that make the scene come across as somewhat contrived and artificial.  But again, merely a product of the times.  I was surprised to learn this film did win an Academy Award for best original screenplay--especially when the viewer is treated to such lines as this (from Richard Widmark):""That ain't cryin'.  That's just new life goin' on!""No, the real entertainment value of this edition resides in the special commentaries presented by filmmaker David Strohmaier; by director of Cinerama, Inc., John Sittig; by film historian Rudy Behlmer; by music historian Jon Burlingame; and by stuntman Loren James.  Their commentary as the film is shown contains a wealth of facts, nostalgia, interesting tidbits, and priceless information.  In particular, the commentary by James, who advises he performed around 80 percent of the stunts in the movie, is absolutely spellbinding.  Also very enjoyable were the comments regarding the discomfort the actors and directors experienced when filming in the Cinerama format--when three cameras, or panels, were used to film each shot.  Unless the two actors were in the same camera panel--and because the three-camera shot was so wide--the actors could not look directly at one another, but instead had to look off to the side, pretending they were seeing each other.  Upon learning this, if you'll go back and look at the movie, you can discern this is indeed the case; the actors are looking over one another's shoulders.Fascinating stuff.And another treasure can be found in the third disc, a documentary entitled ""Cinerama Adventure.""  This feature explores the development and history of how the Cinerama process came to be, the dynamic and colorful people who brought the format to the public, and the absolute cultural craze Cinerama brought to the entire world during the 1950s and early 1960s.  During the presentation, the viewer is treated to remarkable clips from Cinerama travel features that mesmerized millions of theater goers.  Alas, HOW THE WEST WAS WON was the last feature filmed in Cinerama (the studios realized the three-camera process was too cumbersome, problematic, and expensive), yet the format caused the entire motion picture industry to go to 70mm cameras, thereby ushering in cinematic widescreen still going strong today.  This documentary is delightful and engaging.Finally, this ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITION includes nifty replicas of the press booklets actually handed out to the media when the film was released, along with black-and-white and color photos taken while the film was in production.

Sony HDMI cables $150 and HD Screen paint and kit $180 for my 108"" viewing wall screen.  With this 1080p system I've created a HD Home Theater presentation sight and sound equal to an IMAX (on a smaller scale) experience.The 1080p Blu-ray showing blows your minds eye, period.  Their are 2 discs and 2 versions.  Whats incredible is watching the SmileBox transfer replicating the CINERAMA wraparound theatrical experience right in your own home.  By curving the flat 2D picture (disc 1) into a smile simulates the 146 degree 3D image (disc 2)of CINERAMA.

Lopez,"[8, 9]","I saw this film in Cinerama in Hollywood at least 3 times and will never forget the spectacluar panarama effects, something I know DVD cannnot entirely capture, yet, even still, the ratio on DVD is all wrong.  Characters are left out of some shots. Complete action not included.  Why!  We purchase wide screen additions specifically for the FULL SCREEN effect  yet many of the scenes are cropped. Parts of the sound track are fuzzy in  tone, too, which distracts from an otherwide great epic.  Why do  manufacturer's do this to us? the technonogy today can correct these  mishaps. Two still photgraphs, one during the Overture and the other during  the intermission music...  Da! Boring shots  any amature could capture.  Why not include the fine art work, the splendid posters that indentified  this great film at the time.  We film buffs want to see How The West Was  Won paraphernalia.  The film is a history lesson in itself which I shared  with my 11 y.o. son. But the concept of such a remarkable film, the story  telling, and the actors that are no longer with us today, deserve a better  version than what this DVD produces.  Yet, again, the film is awesome, and  Alfred Newman's score is dramatic and powerful and beautiful. One of his  best.

That is why I was so overjoyed to discover a new edition to be released this August.  As this is one of my 10 favorite films and a film that continues to bring warm memories of my childhood, as I originally saw the film at age 13 with my father, I had hoped for years for a new release of this film.  I will be purchasing it on Blu-ray.This film case out duting a wonderful time of movie epics that we will never see again (at least without the use of CGI.)

142416,A1VWHBVNS1P2N3,0792839072,George Redding,"[1, 2]","What can you say about a movie which was one of the most outstanding in the history of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films, and probably the greatest for CINERAMA? It can easily speak for itself. It excludes no one; it is enjoyable for people of all ages and types, be they history teachers or people who like just ""good ole westerns"" that in the late 50's were popular, especially in small towns, on Saturday afternoons; this 1962 production did remind me of my ""favorite western"" days. (I definitely did fit in the latter category.) For people who like love stories, there was also some warm romance.One of the most outstanding casts in the history of Hollywood was found in this one, to state it mildly. Karl Malden (as Zebulun Prescott) and Agnes Morehead made a ""perfect pair"" as the sodbuster and his wife. Lillith Prescott (excellently done by Debbie Reynolds) and Cleve van Valen (the role of the tinhorn which suited Gregory Peck picture-perfectly) made a lovely couple. James Stewart did a good job at being the mountain man, the part of the marshall, (done my Lee J. Cobb), was a job that required virtually no acting for the experienced veteran actor, and George Peppard was versatile as Zebulun Rawlings, a farm-boy-turned-soldier and later a tough, determined, unrelenting lawman himself. Robert Preston, the ex-""music man"", was a high-spirited wagon master. From seeing Harry Morgan as General Grant, I can easily see how the Union general appeared during the time of the War Between the States; the same can be said of John Wayne in his role as General John Tecumseh Sherman.You were pushed to hate Mike King (played by Richard Widmark,) the egotistical, unbearable man who would not let anything-not even a buffalo stampede-impede him from having a railroad built. And you also wanted to see killed the desperado Charlie Gant.(That role was just right for Eli Wallach.) Again, the cast was outstanding.The scenery was beautiful, all the way from the Ohio River to the Sierras; the deserts of California and Arizona were also scenic.Each of the five stories in the movie spoke for itself. I personally would like to have seen it win the Best PictureAward of 1963. It should have been, as it was, recommended by the NEA. (I am speaking as a former teacher myself.) I saw it for the first time as a high school senior in March of 1964, and only a few years ago bought the video for it; I have watched it many times, and have not become bored from doing so.

142419,A7Y6AVS576M03,0792839072,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","HOW THE WEST WAS WON is not only one of my Westerns but is one of my favorite films. Somehow I feel that to really appreciate the scope of this film you probably had to see it on the big screen when you were a kid growing up. It was awe inspiring when I saw it those many years way back when. Even if you didn't see it in true Cinerama, the composite prints were still impressive because you got the three depths of field, which still conveyed the grandeur of the panoramic outdoor vistas of the West as no other process ever, did. The film is a sprawling epic, episodic in structure, but remains one of the great cinematic examples of true Americana. You get a genuine feel of the westward movement of nineteenth century America. This is made greatly possible by Alfred Newman's inspired score, utterly breathtaking cinematography by William H. Daniels, Milton Krasner, Charles B. Lang, Jr. and Joseph LaShelle and screenwriter James R. Webb's earthy dialogue. James Stewart as Linus Rawlings and Henry Fonda as Jethro Stuart have effective and interesting yet separate scenes (the film was divided into five segments) that are linked together by George Peppard as Zeb Rawlings (Stewart's son) in Peppard's telling coming-of-age performance. Stewart's Linus Rawlings is our first contact with a character that embodies the spiriting of winning the West. Fonda's Jethro Stuart seen much latter in the fourth segment gives a reflective performance and ponders on what was really won in the conquering of the West. Debbie Reynolds as Lilith Prescott embodies the romanticism, prosperity and lure of what the West held for those adventurous individuals and dreamers who yearned for what those far off and distant hills held for those with the willing spirit. Russ Tamblyn also has a brief but effective role as a Confederate soldier who shares reflections during the evening with a Union soldier (Peppard) on a riverbank pink with blood from the day's fighting. Also memorable and effective was Spencer Tracy's voice as the Narrator, which tied together the five story segments along with the beautiful prose of the prologue and touching epilogue. For me there are many touching moments in this film about the human spirit and our capacity to want and love. I think this is a great and important film about the American spirit.",5,An Epic of Americana,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,2324,"['HOW', 'WEST', 'WAS', 'WON', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Westerns', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Somehow', 'feel', 'really', 'appreciate', 'scope', 'film', 'probably', 'had', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'when', 'saw', 'many', 'years', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'true', 'Cinerama', 'composite', 'prints', 'were', 'still', 'impressive', 'got', 'three', 'depths', 'field', 'still', 'conveyed', 'grandeur', 'panoramic', 'outdoor', 'vistas', 'West', 'other', 'process', 'ever', 'did', 'film', 'sprawling', 'epic', 'episodic', 'structure', 'one', 'great', 'cinematic', 'examples', 'true', 'Americana', 'get', 'genuine', 'feel', 'westward', 'movement', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'America', 'made', 'greatly', 'possible', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'inspired', 'score', 'utterly', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'William', 'H.', 'Daniels', 'Milton', 'Krasner', 'Charles', 'B.', 'Lang', 'Jr.', 'Joseph', 'LaShelle', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'R.', 'Webb', 'earthy', 'dialogue', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Linus', 'Rawlings', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Jethro', 'Stuart', 'have', 'effective', 'interesting', 'yet', 'separate', 'scenes', 'film', 'was', 'divided', 'five', 'segments', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'George', 'Peppard', 'Zeb', 'Rawlings', 'Stewart', 'son', 'Peppard', 'telling', 'coming-of-age', 'performance', 'Stewart', 'Linus', 'Rawlings', 'first', 'contact', 'character', 'spiriting', 'winning', 'West', 'Fonda', 'Jethro', 'Stuart', 'seen', 'much', 'latter', 'fourth', 'segment', 'reflective', 'performance', 'ponders', 'was', 'really', 'won', 'conquering', 'West', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Lilith', 'Prescott', 'romanticism', 'prosperity', 'lure', 'what', 'West', 'held', 'adventurous', 'individuals', 'dreamers', 'who', 'yearned', 'what', 'far', 'off', 'distant', 'hills', 'held', 'willing', 'spirit', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'also', 'brief', 'effective', 'role', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'who', 'shares', 'reflections', 'evening', 'Union', 'soldier', 'Peppard', 'riverbank', 'pink', 'blood', 'day', 'fighting', 'Also', 'memorable', 'effective', 'was', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'voice', 'Narrator', 'tied', 'five', 'story', 'segments', 'beautiful', 'prose', 'prologue', 'touching', 'epilogue', 'are', 'many', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'human', 'spirit', 'capacity', 'want', 'love', 'think', 'great', 'important', 'film', 'American', 'spirit']",How the West Was Won

It opened with all of the fanfare of a ""Cleopatra"" and ""Ben Hur"", and it does belong in that category.  It used an obsolete filming technique, Cinerama, where three cameras to create a wrap around effect.  It was only shown in specially equipped theatres.It is the story of a single family starting with the father and mother pressing out on the Erie Canal and follows the lives of the children through the years until the end of the Old West.  Epic movies sometimes fail because they take themselves too seriously.  This movie never does that.First, this is an extremely well known movie, and anyone interested in film must see it.  It won Oscars for story and screenplay.  Secondly, it is a very stirring film and anyone interested in history will be affected by, perhaps quite deeply affected.  It does have problems as a film in the same way that ""Gettysburg"" or ""Gods and Generals"" do.  Perhaps it underplays the drama and expects the audience to understand too much.It does have a problem with the lines between the three cameras not being seamless.  This was also true in the theatrical release, but I don't remember it being as bad.  I would hope that a future release can improve this.

I saw Debbie Reynolds come off a train and she played an older lady.  So I had to see the whole movie and I saw it on DVD.Right away you will notice the film has three creases in it.  Look at it long enough and it looks like a folded postcard.The lines mean the film was so big that it fit a three-screen CinemaScope theatre.Turner Classic Movies and this DVD release present this film in Wide-Screen format so all three-screens can be seen.If you only saw it in its Full-Screen version, it would just be the middle screen you would see with the edges of the left and right screen.The start of the film might remind you of the former Disneyland Circle-Vision ""Scenes of America"" attraction.This is a good 'ole American Western Epic filmed in South Dakota. You might spot the Devil's Tower.The film starts with Mountain Man, Linus Rawlings (Jimmy Stewart) trying to make it to Pittsburgh.  Along the way in a canoe, he comes across he Prescott family (Karl Malden, Agnes Moorehead, Debbie Reynolds, Carroll Baker) and they quickly like each other. Linus hasn't been with a good women in a long time. She got a kiss out of him, but the next day he left.  Destiny will bring them together again.After dealing with some bad guys at a trading outpost, he was pushed into a pit and escaped back into the water now floating on a log. He caught up with the Prescott family and helped them be rid of the bad guys at the outpost. Linus decides he must go his way and godspeed to Eve.After the Prescott family goes through the terrible river rapids on their raft, Linus received word of the family and finds them downstream.  He continuously thought of Eve. He asks her to go to Pittsburgh with him, but now she believes God put her family there and that is where the farm should be. Will she go with him?Suddenly the other daughter, Lily, has her prayers answered. She does see a paddle steamboat. We assume she did make it to the boat as the film takes us on the long journey of her life.Also in the cast: Gregory Peck, Robert Preston, Thelma Ritter, Walter Brennan, Andy Devine, George Peppard, Henry Morgan, John Wayne, Russ Tamblyn, Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark, Eli Wallach, Lee J.

This Blu-Ray digitally doctored version certainly comes closest to that experience.  Most older films don't look any better in HD than the regular DVD.  This one is an exception.  In Blu-Ray it gets me very close to the original AND the missing lines between the cameras is a huge improvement from the previous DVD and LaserDisc incarnations.Others have covered the plot and cast and the lore behind the film.  There is NOTHING to compare, these days, with the visceral impact of Cinerama back in the day.

142436,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0792839072,Jeffrey Leach,"[27, 38]","I like westerns. My favorite entries in the genre are spaghetti westerns, those cheap, ultra low budget Italian takes on the American West. I always try to fit some of these movies into my viewing schedule, and when the day came where I considered it time to watch Sergio Leone's epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West,&quot; I headed out to rent it. Imagine my surprise when I got home and saw that I inadvertently checked out &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; instead. I scratched my head, not familiar at all with the title. After all, I like westerns but I don't know a lot about the genre or the films I have yet to see. When I saw the cast list for this 1962 movie, I decided not to take it back without watching and seeing if I liked it. I think I would be remiss to have skipped this one on initial impression alone; the cast list reads like a &quot;who's who&quot; of mid twentieth century Hollywood. You've got Carroll Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Agnes Moorehead, Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, George Peppard, Debbie Reynolds, Eli Wallach, John Wayne, Richard Widmark, Walter Brennan, Karl Malden, Carolyn Jones, Harry Morgan, Raymond Massey, and Robert Preston filling the roles. Spencer Tracy voices the narration. Howard Hawks and John Ford directed specific segments of the film. What a list of talent! Couldn't go wrong with a movie like this one, right? Wrong.As amazing as it seems, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is not a very good experience. The movie runs for an eternity as it attempts to describe the different experiences in settling the American West. At the beginning of the film, the Prescott clan heads out to the West in search of farmland and a new beginning. Zebulon Prescott (Karl Malden), his wife Rebecca (Agnes Moorehead), and two daughters Eve (Carroll Baker) and Lilith (Debbie Reynolds) travel down the recently completed Erie Canal and travel out into what Illinois or Missouri. Along the way, they encounter a traveling fur trapper named Linus Rawlings (Jimmy Stewart), who stays with the family for a day or so, just long enough to fall in love with one of the daughters. After Zeb and Rebecca perish in an unfortunate rafting accident, Rawlings reemerges to take care of Eve and eventually establish a farm at the sight of the accident. These two will have children-one named Zebulon Rawlings (George Peppard)-who will eventually fight in the Civil War. Zeb Rawlings then leaves the family property to his brother as he moves further west fighting Indians for the railroads and working as a law officer. He ends up thwarting a nasty train robbery in Arizona some fifty years after his grandparents expired on that raft.The other daughter, Lilith, ends up in St. Louis working as a dancer and actress when she learns that she inherited a gold mine in California. As she prepares to head west, a slick card shark named Cleve Van Valen (Gregory Peck) convinces Lily to take him along. There's a minor competition for Lily's affections between Van Valen and Roger Morgan (Robert Preston), another guy on the wagon train. The gold mine doesn't pan out in the end, so Lilith and Cleve end up falling in love and marrying, eventually going on to build and lose several huge family fortunes. Of course, Lily's travels to the coast are fraught with perils, such as an Indian attack on the wagon train and a song and dance number at a campsite. I kept hoping the filmmakers would insert a Donner Party type situation that would require Gregory Peck to consume either Robert Preston or Debbie Reynolds, but no such luck. In any event, the movie seems to focus more on the Rawlings clan than it does on Lily's experiences.Sadly, many of the great actors in the movie rarely appear. Raymond Massey plays Abraham Lincoln, John Wayne and Harry Morgan are General William Tecumseh Sherman and General Ulysses S. Grant respectively, and Lee J. Cobb is a Marshal in Arizona. Even Eli Wallach as an outlaw is a ghostly shadow of the villain he played in Leone's &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.&quot; The huge cast list highlights the central problem of the film, namely that the filmmakers tried to do too much. Very few of the characters we see receive proper development. The focus here is on shock and awe photography and scenery, not the individuals taking part in the events. &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; was the first film shot in Cinerama, and, I think, a prime example of how Hollywood abuses a new technology. We see the same thing going on today with the CGI effects in those top-heavy special effects bonanzas. Everyone wants to use a new cinematic technique, so much so that they rely solely on the effect and lose sight of the human element. A bit less spectacle and a lot more interaction between the cast would have helped this movie succeed.I hate to say it, but the DVD version of this film could use a lot of work. You can literally see the two lines dividing the picture into three segments in the transfer. Not only is this enormously annoying, it's completely unacceptable. I can't believe the studio techs couldn't release a seamlessly restored version of this film. The disc does contain a short documentary detailing the Cinerama process along with a few bits about the stunts in the film, but the shoddy picture quality of the movie will dampen your enthusiasm for any extras. I imagine some people would like the actual movie better than I did though no one should settle for the poor transfer. I suggest waiting for a special edition disc.",2,Middling story and atrocious transfer,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,5492,"['like', 'westerns', 'favorite', 'entries', 'genre', 'are', 'spaghetti',

142440,AX6GG8U1HDSZZ,0792839072,J. M. Jaco,"[7, 8]","One of my all-time favorites, with a terrific all-star cast, this film covers in a broad sweep the final three-quarters of the nineteenth century in America starting with the era of the Erie Canal. Some may complain that big names have short screen times, but that's what makes it all the more fun watching it throughout.  Debbie Reynolds appears in four of the five segments, which is probably the most of all the actors, but brief screen times for great actors is the norm throughout the film. For example, at the beginning we see Jimmy Stewart, Karl Malden, Agnes Moorehead, Debbie Reynolds, Carroll Baker, Tudor Owen, then Lee Van Cleef, Walter Brennan, and Brigid Bazlen in the first segments, but only one of these is seen beyond the intermission.  Throughout the movie, you can try to spot brief appearances by others such as Ken Curtis, Harry Dean Stanton, Raymond Massey, and Barry Livingston.As others have stated, this movie was shot in Cinerama format (with three cameras) that required special viewing in Cinerama theaters with curved screens and properly oriented triple projectors.  It was an experimental/novelty format, much like IMAX is today, and most of the films shot in Cinerama format were intended simply to promote the format - which is why the extremely ambitious ""How the West Was Won"" is particularly noteworthy. The only other full-length, supposedly Cinerama film with a large all-star cast was ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" a comedy that also was meant to promote the Cinerama theater experience even though it was shot in Ultra Panavision (single-camera). Nevertheless, it was another memorable film.Beyond the acting and directing rosters (""How the West Was Won"" has five sections directed by three famous directors - Ford, Hathaway, and Marshall), and the amazing imagery, however, is perhaps one of the most beautiful movie scores ever written.  This was Alfred Newman's crowning work and, besides having his own rousing and recurring theme motifs throughout, he weaves numerous American folk melodies into the score in ways that modern film composers would do well to emulate.  It is a musical masterpiece that can easily stand on its own without the movie.  The Civil War sequence, for one, has a poignant foreshadowing moment that combines ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" with ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again"" that still puts a lump in my throat.This is a long movie, and, in accord with common practice of the day, includes an intermission (in which people usually got up and went out to the lobby to get more snacks, etc.)  Newman's score offers some interesting mood music for this intermission, but, again as part of the promotion of Cinerama theaters which were among the first to feature state-of-the-art sound systems, he also wrote substantial prelude music that was designed to aurally set the mood for theater patrons as they waited for the movie to start.  Having been fortunate to attend the golden Cooper Cinerama Theater in Minnesota back in the day to see this movie four different times(!) in 1962-63, I can tell you the effect was magical.I've included this movie on my Listmania list of movies worth watching again and again for young and old.Side note: If you watch this movie on anything but Smilebox format, you'll notice that some scenes look very strange, and I'm not talking about the vertical lines that defined the seams between the three cameras.  For example, when Zeb travels up to the high country to see Jethro, the intended Cinerama theater screen showed Zeb on the left third of the screen and Jethro on the right third, and because the screen curved so much, the effect was that they looked like they were actually facing each other across the stage.  When this is seen on a flat screen, however, it just looks confusing.  Please don't fault the film for these flaws but try to see it on a big screen in Smilebox format.

Instead, it is a collection of loosely related vignettes dealing with America's westward expansion in the 19th century. These little stories involve a number of characters but they are loosely tied to one family. Various people wander in and out of it through the course of the film. Most of the actors are major names but each plays just a small role.As an example, the opening of the Eerie Canal is briefly spoken of. From there, we get a segue into a group of settlers who want to head west where the land is. They cannot afford transportation along the Mississippi so they build their own rafts. While underway, the meet a mountain man, pirates and another settler family. Throughout the rest of the film, various members of this family will appear in a vignette that directly concerns him or her. This may be about the gold rush in California, the building of the transcontinental railway, dealing with hostile Indians, the Civil War or any one of other bits of western Americana.The driving force behind this film is the pioneer spirit and a willingness to overcome adversity in order to make a success of one's self.

Although it is definitely a sanitized look at the ""winning"" of the Old West, it holds up today for its successful portrayal of pioneers as real people who braved an unknown frontier to realize their dreams of a new life.The Blu-ray ""Smilebox"" transfer, which tries to mimic the Cinerama experience, is interesting and provides a somewhat-accurate recreation of the Cinerama curved screen, although for maximum impact one should probably view it on a huge television or projection screen. In contrast, the flat letterbox version looks rather odd, since many shots include very prominent objects and sets on the left and right sides of the screen, which were designed for the Cinerama format but often seem to overpower the actors in the flat version.For the most part the ""lines"" in the 3-camera Cinerama image are not visible, except during some shots of blue sky.This is probably the best this film will look, at least for the forseable future, and Warner is to be commended for preserving this important and historic film in its original format.",4,The West in Hi-Def.,1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,1314,"['One', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'big', 'epics', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'classic', 'tale', 'heroics', 'heartbreak', 'filmed', 'now-defunct', 'Cinerama', 'process.While', 'light', 'cohesive', 'story', 'film', 'chock-full', 'Hollywood', 'melodrama', 'amazing', 'time', 'camera', 'work', 'definitely', 'sanitized', 'look', 'winning', 'Old', 'West', 'up', 'today', 'successful', 'portrayal', 'pioneers', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'braved', 'unknown', 'frontier', 'realize', 'dreams', 'new', 'life.The', 'Blu-ray', 'Smilebox', 'transfer', 'mimic', 'Cinerama', 'experience', 'interesting', 'somewhat-accurate', 'recreation', 'Cinerama', 'curved', 'screen', 'maximum', 'impact', 'one', 'should', 'probably', 'view', 'huge', 'television', 'projection', 'screen', 'contrast', 'flat', 'letterbox', 'version', 'rather', 'odd', 'many', 'shots', 'include', 'very', 'prominent', 'objects', 'sets', 'left', 'right', 'sides', 'screen', 'were', 'designed', 'Cinerama', 'format', 'often', 'seem', 'overpower', 'actors', 'flat', 'version.For', 'most', 'part', 'lines', '3-camera', 'Cinerama', 'image', 'are', 'not', 'visible', 'shots', 'blue', 'sky.This', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'will', 'look', 'least', 'forseable', 'future', 'Warner', 'be', 'commended', 'preserving', 'important', 'historic', 'film', 'original', 'format']",How the West Was Won

Perhaps, as one critic (I forget who) remarked about the film, 'the parts are better than the sum', the reason for this would have to be the fact that several directors worked on it. John Ford, who loathed the Cinerama format even more than CinemaScope, oddly enough, was inspired to direct the most memorable scenes in the film. For him, the Civil War was a broad canvass; a theatre-in-the-round, if you will. Ford elicits memorable performances from Carol Baker, George Peppard and Claude Johnson in his film debut.

142451,A26X2TG93OTXVU,0792839072,Justin Heath,"[0, 0]","James R. Webb's original screenplay for the screen won an Oscar in 1962 and it involves an episodic account of the Prescott family and their contribution to settling the American west in the 19th century. We first meet the Prescott's, Karl Malden and Agnes Moorehead going west on the Erie Canal and later by flatboat on the Ohio River. They have two daughters, dreamy romantic Carroll Baker and feisty Debbie Reynolds. The girls meet and marry mountain man James Stewart and gambler Gregory Peck eventually and their adventures and those of their children are what make up the plot of How the West Was Won.Three of Hollywood's top directors did parts of this film although the lion's share by all accounts was done by Henry Hathaway. John Ford did the Civil War sequence and George Marshall the sequence about the railroad.The Civil War piece featured John Wayne and Harry Morgan in a moment of reflection at the battlefield of Shiloh. Morgan did a first rate job as Grant in his brief cameo and Wayne was playing Sherman for the second time in his career. He'd previously played Sherman in a cameo on his friend Ward Bond's Wagon Train series. I'm surprised Wayne never did Sherman in a biographical film, he would have been good casting.If any of the stars could be said to be THE star of the film it would have to be Debbie Reynolds. She's in the film almost through out and in the last sequence where as a widow she goes to live with her nephew George Peppard and his family she's made up as a gray haired old woman and does very well with the aging. Debbie also gets to do a couple of musical numbers, A Home in the Meadow and Raise A Ruckus both blend in well in the story. Debbie's performance in How the West Was Won must have been the reason she was cast in The Unsinkable Molly Brown.Cinerama was rarely as effectively employed as in How the West Was Won. I well remember feeling like you were right on the flatboat that the Presscott family was on as they got caught in the Ohio River rapids. The Indian attack and the buffalo stampede were also well done. But the climax involving that running gun battle between peace officers George Peppard and Lee J. Cobb with outlaw Eli Wallach and his gang on a moving train even on a formatted VHS is beyond thrilling.There is a sequence that was removed and it had to do with Peppard going to live with buffalo hunter Henry Fonda and marrying Hope Lange who was Fonda's daughter.

Up to now, the only way to see it was either on TV or VHS tape. No matter how much you wanted to enjoy the views and large scale action, the pictures were given short shrift by the method of filming used: Cinerama.  To get most of the action on screen, the studio used multi-cameras simultaneously. BUT! The process left two very visible vertical lines 1/3 of the distance from the film edges. Very noticible and very distracting!I am EXTREMELY happy that they were able to almost totally eliminate these annoyances in the DVD copy here. Now, instead of the lines taking center screen, the story, sound, color and landscapes have their rightful spots.When I popped the first DVD in to play, I was astounded! The color and clarity! It was like watching an entirely different feature.The story itself follows a pioneer family called the Prescotts from their trek through the Erie Canal and westward to new lands. Along the way, mountain men, river pirates, gamblers, indians, stampedes and death have an big influence on their lives, but not on their spirit or desires to make a new life and home in the west.The generations of Prescotts and their off-shoots,the Rawlins & Van Valens survive to demonstrate another look at the settling of the west.Sit down, curl up with a bowl of popcorn and watch for yourself to see - &#34;How the West Was Won.&#34;",5,It's about time ...,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,1429,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'first', 'saw', '30+', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'was', 'either', 'TV', 'VHS', 'tape', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'enjoy', 'views', 'large', 'scale', 'action', 'pictures', 'were', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'method', 'filming', 'used', 'Cinerama', 'get', 'most', 'action', 'screen', 'studio', 'used', 'multi-cameras', 'simultaneously', 'BUT', 'process', 'left', 'two', 'very', 'visible', 'vertical', 'lines', '1/3', 'distance', 'film', 'edges', 'Very', 'noticible', 'very', 'distracting', 'am', 'EXTREMELY', 'happy', 'were', 'able', 'almost', 'totally', 'eliminate', 'annoyances', 'DVD', 'copy', 'here', 'Now', 'instead', 'lines', 'taking', 'center', 'screen', 'story', 'sound', 'color', 'landscapes', 'have', 'rightful', 'spots.When', 'popped', 'first', 'DVD', 'play', 'was', 'astounded', 'color', 'clarity', 'was', 'watching', 'entirely', 'different', 'feature.The', 'story', 'pioneer', 'family', 'called', 'Prescotts', 'trek', 'Erie', 'Canal', 'westward', 'new', 'lands', 'way', 'mountain', 'men', 'river', 'pirates', 'gamblers', 'indians', 'stampedes', 'death', 'have', 'big', 'influence', 'lives', 'not', 'spirit', 'desires', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'home', 'west.The', 'generations', 'Prescotts', 'off-shoots', 'Rawlins', 'Van', 'Valens', 'survive', 'demonstrate', 'look', 'settling', 'west.Sit', 'down', 'curl', 'up', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'see', '34', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won.', '34']",How the West Was Won

I have watched it many many times & went to the picture show to see it way back when it first came out in the early sixties. The price of $ 41.99 is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion.

142455,A30TK6U7DNS82R,0792839072,Kevin Killian,"[2, 4]","I love the movie, longueurs and all, for John Ford's segment on THE CIVIL WAR makes up for a lot of the movie's shortcomings.  It is sometimes slighted as being among the least of Ford's films, but I like it a lot and never fail to be moved by the poetic distillation of those years of bloodshed and terror.  George Peppard is pretty nmediocre in other parts of the movie but in this sequence he shines, together with young Russ Tamblyn.  Their little duet reminds me of the sadness of Pozzo and Lucky in Beckett's WAITING FOR GODOT.  And beyond them, representing the enlisted men, loom the great generals meeting, John Wayne as Sherman brooding, haunted, late into the night, Harry Morgan as Grant trying to steal the show from the Duke, sorry no chance.  I also enjoy the part where Peppard finally comes home from the war and his poor mother is worn out trying to make ends meet.  It always brings tears to these eyes of mine, tears of identification.  The look on her face is luminous, like one of those black and white photographs of Dust Bowl women by Dorothea Lange, whose influence hangs over the cinematography of HTWWW's quieter and more dignified moments.In general the movie goes from ebullient and jubilant, filled with adventure and fun, to more somber and reflective moments.  The beginning of the movie has a fair amount of comedy in it, even when Moorehead and Brennan come to grief in a flash flood, the mood is still buoyant--well, it would have to be with Debbie Reynolds always finding something to sing about.  The Civil War and the Reconstruction sequences, and the coming of the Railroad, are grim, grim, grim, and having Carolyn Jones play such a prominent part in the last half is sort of a downer--sorry, Jones fans.  She's a unique and irreplaceable presence in postwar US film, but I think she was wrong for Julie.Of course the whole movie is miscast in many ways, but I never found much of a problem with it, except in this one case.  However, imagine a HTWWW filmed even five years later, the cast would have shifted considerably, and probably Ann-Margret would have played Lilith, someone like Terence Stamp would have played Jeb, and Raquel Welch could have played Julie Rawlings, stopping the railroad with her breasts alone.",5,Consider the alternative,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,2260,"['love', 'movie', 'longueurs', 'John', 'Ford', 'segment', 'THE', 'CIVIL', 'WAR', 'up', 'lot', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'sometimes', 'slighted', 'being', 'least', 'Ford', 'films', 'like', 'lot', 'never', 'fail', 'be', 'moved', 'poetic', 'distillation', 'years', 'bloodshed', 'terror', 'George', 'Peppard', 'pretty', 'nmediocre', 'other', 'parts', 'movie', 'sequence', 'together', 'young', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'little', 'duet', 'sadness', 'Pozzo', 'Lucky', 'Beckett', 'WAITING', 'FOR', 'GODOT', 'representing', 'enlisted', 'men', 'loom', 'great', 'generals', 'meeting', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Sherman', 'brooding', 'haunted', 'late', 'night', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'Grant', 'trying', 'steal', 'show', 'Duke', 'chance', 'also', 'enjoy', 'part', 'where', 'Peppard', 'finally', 'home', 'war', 'poor', 'mother', 'worn', 'out', 'trying', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'always', 'tears', 'eyes', 'mine', 'tears', 'identification', 'look', 'face', 'luminous', 'one', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'Dust', 'Bowl', 'women', 'Dorothea', 'Lange', 'influence', 'cinematography', 'HTWWW', 'quieter', 'more', 'dignified', 'moments.In', 'general', 'movie', 'ebullient', 'jubilant', 'filled', 'adventure', 'fun', 'more', 'somber', 'reflective', 'moments', 'beginning', 'movie', 'fair', 'amount', 'comedy', 'even', 'when', 'Moorehead', 'Brennan', 'come', 'grief', 'flash', 'flood', 'mood', 'still', 'buoyant', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'always', 'finding', 'something', 'sing', 'about', 'Civil', 'War', 'Reconstruction', 'sequences', 'coming', 'Railroad', 'are', 'grim', 'grim', 'grim', 'having', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'play', 'prominent', 'part', 'last', 'half', 'sort', 'downer', 'sorry', 'Jones', 'fans', 'unique', 'irreplaceable', 'presence', 'postwar', 'US', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'wrong', 'Julie.Of', 'course', 'whole', 'movie', 'miscast', 'many', 'ways', 'never', 'found', 'much', 'problem', 'one', 'case', 'However', 'imagine', 'HTWWW', 'filmed', 'even', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'shifted', 'considerably', 'probably', 'Ann-Margret', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'Lilith', 'someone', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'Jeb', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Julie', 'Rawlings', 'stopping', 'railroad', 'breasts', 'alone']",How the West Was Won

Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[4, 7]","Once again, Amazon can't keep their database straight and they have mixed together reviews for previous editions of this movie. Anything written before September 9, 2008 cannot be referring to the newly restored version of How The West Was Won.Warners did a lot of work to spruce up this film. Unfortunately, it was designed and shot to be shown on a curved screen, one that occupied a full third of a circle. It was never meant to be shown on a flat screen, and it just looks ridiculous when it is. Without the screen curvature, people seem to change direction as they move from center to side. Worse, when people are on either side of the screen, they appear to be staring into space when they are supposed to be looking at the main action in the center of the screen. What are supposed to be vast vistas end up looking like they were filmed through a fisheye lens. It's all very distracting and more than a bit hard on the eyes.All the effort to preserve the entire picture is not really worth it, either, because most of the time the action is carefully constrained to the middle third of the picture. You end up with the paradox of a vast widescreen image that feels very claustrophobic in its composition.Maybe if the script was more interesting these visual problems wouldn't matter so much. But it's not that great a movie. It was designed to show off the 3-projector Cinerama technology and it remains a prisoner of that technology. When you lose the ""wow"" factor of a Cinerama theater, and have the visuals mangled onto a flat screen, HTWWW becomes just a minor curiosity.The Blu-Ray edition is said to have a ""Smilebox"" version of the movie--Smilebox is supposed to correct for the problems of smashing a curved screen presentation down to a flat screen. I don't know how well that works--Blu-Ray is still too expensive and still has very little depth of catalog, so it's not on my horizon. There is no good reason why the standard DVD version could not have been in Smilebox if it really does solve the severe visual distortions.",3,This really is a review of the new release.,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,2041,"['Once', 'again', 'Amazon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'database', 'straight', 'have', 'mixed', 'together', 'reviews', 'previous', 'editions', 'movie', 'Anything', 'written', 'September', '9', '2008', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'referring', 'newly', 'restored', 'version', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won.Warners', 'did', 'lot', 'work', 'spruce', 'up', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'designed', 'shot', 'be', 'shown', 'curved', 'screen', 'one', 'occupied', 'full', 'third', 'circle', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'shown', 'flat', 'screen', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'screen', 'curvature', 'people', 'seem', 'change', 'direction', 'move', 'center', 'side', 'Worse', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'side', 'screen', 'appear', 'be', 'staring', 'space', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'main', 'action', 'center', 'screen', 'What', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'vast', 'vistas', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'were', 'filmed', 'fisheye', 'very', 'distracting', 'more', 'bit', 'hard', 'eyes.All', 'effort', 'preserve', 'entire', 'picture', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'either', 'most', 'time', 'action', 'carefully', 'constrained', 'middle', 'third', 'picture', 'end', 'up', 'paradox', 'vast', 'widescreen', 'image', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'composition.Maybe', 'script', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'visual', 'problems', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'show', 'off', '3-projector', 'Cinerama', 'technology', 'prisoner', 'technology', 'When', 'lose', 'wow', 'factor', 'Cinerama', 'theater', 'have', 'visuals', 'mangled', 'flat', 'screen', 'HTWWW', 'just', 'minor', 'curiosity.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'said', 'have', 'Smilebox', 'version', 'movie', 'Smilebox', 'supposed', 'correct', 'problems', 'smashing', 'curved', 'screen', 'presentation', 'down', 'flat', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'Blu-Ray', 'still', 'too', 'expensive', 'still', 'very', 'little', 'depth', 'catalog', 'not', 'horizon', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Smilebox', 'really', 'solve', 'severe', 'visual', 'distortions']",How the West Was Won

Previous releases were either pan-and-scanned or flat letterbox, leaving annoying lines between the three panels.  (The film was shot with three separate cameras and originally projected by three synchronized projectors.  I saw this film in Cinerama and you could see the lines.)This new HD release has been extensively restored, and mostly it looks spectacular.  Unfortunately, they did not remove all the lines.  During several sequences, including the railroad sequence and the closing shots, the center panel is a big dark smudge, which is really disappointing, since most of the film looks astonishingly good.  The previous DVD release was ludicrously bad, and this is a 1000% improvement, but it still falls short.I watched the ""Smilebox"" version, which attempts to simulate a curved screen.  This works well, although the center panel has to be smaller, and since that's where the actors are most of the time, there aren't many close ups.  However, this movie is all about the spectacular set pieces:  the raft on the rapids, the buffalo stampede, the train robbery.  Most of these come through intact, but it's frustrating that the picture couldn't look that good for the *whole* film.  To be immersed in brilliant Blu-Ray, and then suddenly see a big dark smudge across the center of the screen is a bringdown.The movie itself is a cheesy piece of fluff; I saw it when I was nine and absolutely adored it, so it's fun to see it every once in a while.

If only they had spent a little longer... The entire film is shot with a super wide angle lens. There are no closeups.This film is extraordinarily corny and wholesome. There are several musical numbers that add little to the plot. John Wayne is hopelessly miscast as George Tecumseh Sherman. He should have been given a more important part. Duke is only on screen for a minute. He was after all, the king of the American western.

Granted our history of western culture really only lasted about 60 years, this movie however did a very good job of covering that time frame.. Of all the stars who acted in this film are to best of my knowledge gone, only two or three are still are with us. This movies has been re mastered the color is vibrant. The nasty lines dividing the screen in thirds for most part have been removed. The movie is so clear now, it doesn't take a person long when watching it to find yourself in the middle of the Ohio river, racing down the rapids or prospecting for gold in 1848. Then on to the traveling west with a wagon train. We see a glimpse of the Civil War and the Hell known as Shiloh and a man who entered the war as a boy returns home as a man. The expansion and taming of the west is then covered. The final part covers the bandits and a very accurately done train wreck. I worked for the railroad for years and when a train wreck happens you just go with the flow and ride it out. The staging of this sequence was very well done. This is a movie that should be in every ones Library. I have owned this movie for years, I just bought this one only because it has been re mastered. If you haven't seen this movie you will enjoy it. By todays standards it might not hold up to the computer graphics they are using now, but there is one thing you can say about this film, it is one that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.",5,This movies has to be the best Western ever,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1538,"['When', 'was', 'boy', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'fascinated', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'very', 'believable', 'Granted', 'history', 'western', 'culture', 'really', 'only', 'lasted', '60', 'years', 'movie', 'however', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'time', 'frame..', 'stars', 'who', 'acted', 'film', 'are', 'best', 'knowledge', 'gone', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'are', 'still', 'are', 'movies', 'been', 're', 'mastered', 'color', 'vibrant', 'nasty', 'lines', 'dividing', 'screen', 'thirds', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'movie', 'so', 'clear', 'now', ""n't"", 'take', 'person', 'long', 'when', 'watching', 'find', 'middle', 'Ohio', 'river', 'racing', 'down', 'rapids', 'prospecting', 'gold', '1848', 'Then', 'traveling', 'west', 'wagon', 'train', 'see', 'glimpse', 'Civil', 'War', 'Hell', 'known', 'Shiloh', 'man', 'who', 'entered', 'war', 'boy', 'home', 'man', 'expansion', 'taming', 'west', 'then', 'covered', 'final', 'part', 'bandits', 'very', 'accurately', 'done', 'train', 'wreck', 'worked', 'railroad', 'years', 'when', 'train', 'wreck', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'ride', 'out', 'staging', 'sequence', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'ones', 'Library', 'have', 'owned', 'movie', 'years', 'just', 'bought', 'one', 'only', 'been', 're', 'mastered', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'todays', 'standards', 'might', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'computer', 'graphics', 'are', 'using', 'now', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'together']",How the West Was Won

142463,AIVS4I2Q8Y90V,0792839072,"L.G. Pioneer ""David - K3DAV""","[3, 3]","I bought ""This Is Cinerama"", ""Windjammer"" and ""How The West Was Won"" together from Amazon for a weekend of Cinerama viewing.  All of these movies were awe inspiring in the Smilebox format on BluRay disc.  But ""HTWWW"" was the most breathtaking.  The cinematography is overwhelming with sceens of the best locations of America.  The deserts, the rivers, the old towns.... are beautiful and awesome to take in.The 3 camera angles across the Smilebox screen is as realistic as it can get without actually seeing it in a real Cinerama theater.  The 3 camera angles adds a quality of depth and perspective that no other widescreen format can come close to showing.  Then adding the Smilebox format just enhances that depth so much more.  This BluRay Package comes with both the flat 70mm widescreen version, and the Smilebox version on separate BluRay discs.  You get to directly compare both versions.  The flat 70mm WS version is very good and shows off the depth and color very nicely.  But the Smilebox version has no competition for awesomeness.The restoration of this movie makes the Hi-Def picture really shine with clarity, color and contrast that equals movies made today in HD.  They also stayed true to the unique 7 channel effect of the sound.  Your ears can follow your eyes as the sounds seem to move across the screen with the objects and people making the sounds.  The 7 separate soundtracks was also digitally restored and rivals the quality of todays movie soundtracks in both quality and placement of the Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound speakers.My own dream is that movie companies of today would start releasing their recent films in a Cinerama or Smilebox presentation for the theater and home screens.  I enjoyed the Cinerama effect so much, I decided to do a tribute to this wonderful movie format that rocked the world.  My tribute can be seen on my website at k3dav.comThis is a must see movie for any fan of the western movies and especially for Cinerama fans.  It is worth buying at any price.

142464,A38RO46GVRD56P,0792839072,"Linda ""Mom of 5""","[2, 2]","I'd never heard of cinerama before I saw this movie and the two permanant lines of demarkation and the accompanying distortion of angles bugged me at first.  But after I watched the ""making of"" special feature, all my questions were answered.Sure it's silly in spots and historically inaccurate in many parts - like the wagon train where every wagon was pulled by horses instead of oxen.  But then oxen drawn wagons running from attacking Indians wouldn't make for much of a chase - a massacre and quick end to the movie would have resulted.  And the shot locations don't always mesh with the storyline - like when Karl Malden bit it on a raft that was supposed to be floating lazily down an Ohio river tributary but magically turned into a Colorado River type whitewater experience complete with mountain backdrop.But enough of being nitpicky, it's a fun ride the whole way.  I love a movie full of big names even if one or two of them are miscast.  However, my favorite characters are Karl Malden's farmer/father character at the beginning of the film and Thelma Ritter's desperate spinster character later on.  They are both hilarious.The theme music is wonderful - a Hollywood classic.  Try turning the sound up and sit back and enjoy with your eyes closed during the opening credits.  I also like the ending rendition with lyrics that plays over aerial shots of the modern day west.If you want a serious western, watch Costner's brilliant ""Dances With Wolves.""

142465,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0792839072,magellan,"[0, 0]","Please note that I saw this on HBO so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.This is an exciting and visually stunning move in many ways. It broke new ground in video: the Cinerama process involved three cameras, producing an absurdly wide-screen image. I once read that even in the early 60s a wide-screen multi-element movie camera lens could cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars--that was more than an average house in the U.S. back then. So one can only wonder what this process cost for this movie when all was said and done.Everything about the movie is bigger than life--the amazingly stellar cast, the directorial talent (of which several were involved), the huge budget, and even as I said, the camera technology. And at three hours, it's truly a movie as big and sweeping as the country it tries to depict. As far as westerns go, there may never have been another to match the scale and scope of HTWWW, although Cimarron does come to mind, but even Cimarron isn't as ambitious as HTWWW, or as good a movie, in my humble opinion.But therein lies one of the problems with such a big, ambitious movie. Although a great movie in many ways, trying to maintain continuity during it's 50-year timeline and with such a diverse cast of characters and subplots proved to be a monumental, and not entirely successful, task. But the script was first-rate, the entire cast was superb, the scenes are memorable and dramatic, and the action sequences are some of the best ever done.I'll just mention one of these. Especially memorable was the gun fight on the train near the end of the movie between George Peppard and Lee J. Cobb, and Eli Wallach and his gang, where the train is literally falling apart as it speeds down the track, finally derailing. I'm no expert on movie stunts, but this looked very risky to do and even dangerous. And it's one of the most spectacular action sequences in any movie. Not all of the movie has such heart-stopping action--which is probably a good thing. :-)One final note on the camera optics, because wide-screen lenses produce serious optical distortions, you can see that edges and straight lines, if they're long enough, are often markedly curved in the movie, especially in the final scenes where the two ends of the Golden Gate Bridge seem to curve away at almost right angles from each other. :-)Finally, the movie has a rousing sound track that melds perfectly with the action on screen. Overall, a truly historic and groundbreaking movie that's still worth your time.",4,Epic & groundbreaking,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,2545,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'HBO', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'quality', 'video', 'transfer', 'features.This', 'exciting', 'visually', 'stunning', 'move', 'many', 'ways', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'video', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'involved', 'three', 'cameras', 'producing', 'absurdly', 'wide-screen', 'image', 'once', 'read', 'even', 'early', '60s', 'wide-screen', 'multi-element', 'movie', 'camera', 'lens', 'could', 'cost', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'was', 'more', 'average', 'house', 'U.S.', 'back', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'process', 'cost', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done.Everything', 'movie', 'bigger', 'life', 'amazingly', 'stellar', 'cast', 'directorial', 'talent', 'several', 'were', 'involved', 'huge', 'budget', 'even', 'said', 'camera', 'technology', 'three', 'hours', 'truly', 'movie', 'big', 'sweeping', 'country', 'depict', 'As', 'far', 'westerns', 'go', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'match', 'scale', 'scope', 'HTWWW', 'Cimarron', 'come', 'mind', 'even', 'Cimarron', ""n't"", 'as', 'ambitious', 'HTWWW', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'humble', 'opinion.But', 'therein', 'one', 'problems', 'big', 'ambitious', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'trying', 'maintain', 'continuity', '50-year', 'timeline', 'such', 'diverse', 'cast', 'characters', 'subplots', 'proved', 'be', 'monumental', 'not', 'entirely', 'successful', 'task', 'script', 'was', 'first-rate', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'scenes', 'are', 'memorable', 'dramatic', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'ever', 'done.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'mention', 'one', 'Especially', 'memorable', 'was', 'gun', 'fight', 'train', 'end', 'movie', 'George', 'Peppard', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'gang', 'where', 'train', 'literally', 'falling', 'apart', 'down', 'track', 'finally', 'derailing', ""'m"", 'expert', 'movie', 'stunts', 'looked', 'very', 'risky', 'do', 'even', 'dangerous', 'one', 'most', 'spectacular', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'Not', 'movie', 'such', 'heart-stopping', 'action', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'camera', 'optics', 'wide-screen', 'lenses', 'produce', 'serious', 'optical', 'distortions', 'can', 'see', 'edges', 'straight', 'lines', ""'re"", 'long', 'enough', 'are', 'often', 'markedly', 'curved', 'movie', 'especially', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'two', 'ends', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'seem', 'curve', 'away', 'almost', 'right', 'angles', 'other', 'Finally', 'movie', 'rousing', 'sound', 'track', 'perfectly', 'action', 'screen', 'Overall', 'truly', 'historic', 'groundbreaking', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'time']",How the West Was Won
142466,A3NX4X0E3JQ4JS,0792839072,Magic Fingers,"[5, 11]","I'm afraid that I must agree with some of the less popular and more critical assessments of this newly remastered edition of ""How the West Was Won"" in that it's just not all that great. While the action sequences are spellbinding, most of this movie is tedious and difficult to watch. Somebody dumped a pile of cash on this picture to demonstrate what can be done with Cinerama but, unfortunately, not much can really be done, outside of the 'roller-coaster' shots.This is a 'restored' version and it is miles better than previously released renditions of HtWWW; eliminating all dirt and scratches found on the old prints (what some here have described as 'dirt' spots in the opening ariel scene are just water droplets on the window); eliminating the 'join' lines between panels (except for a couple of pan shots where they are hard to ignore); also, color has been corrected and carefully matched between panels. Sound is very good, for the most part, but at times a bit distorted and the dialog volume is uneven and could benefit from some better equalization.I would have given this 2 stars, except for the inclusion, on the third disc, of Dave Strohmaier's excellent documentary, ""Cinerama Adventure"".There are a few big problems with this new DVD collection that bother me: First, there is some kind of digital ""smoothing"" that has been applied to the finished product, which may help to make visual discrepancies less noticeable during the transfer to disc, but makes the image a little less sharp than it could be, and really needs to be, for this movie. I've seen sharper digital transfers from WB and MGM on many other standard definition videos, and unfortunately, the documentary also suffers this fate. I know because I saw it in a theatre. Secondly; Don't get hung up over the ""Smilebox"" idea. You can see how it works in the documentary and, although it's suppose to give you an idea of what Cinerama would look like in a theater, it gets to be a bit too much after a while. This brings me to my third complaint: That (as others have already said here) the whole movie looks 'fisheyed' and is very distracting to watch, especially actor's faces where the nose is exaggerated and eyes and mouth are small. Rather unflattering that these gorgeous movie stars look like they're in a bad high school yearbook photo! Everything looks VERY far away, as though you are viewing through a distant keyhole, and I think the Smilebox effect accentuates this, making it look even farther away, as though you are in the back of the audience (which works well for the documentary, but not the feature). I kept reaching for my binoculars, even though I'm 6 feet away from a 120-inch screen! Maybe the Blu-Ray edition is sharper and bigger, but Cinerama was designed to be viewed on a very large, deeply curved screen, and there's just no way to make it look natural on a flat surface. Even close-up shots, which there are not many, feel distant and contribute to the 'big nose' problem. Making this issue even worse, the top and bottom edges of the frame has been cropped a bit (not the sides, as in previous versions) so the aspect ratio is up to 2.9, not 2.55 as it says here, or even 2.7, which Cinerama would be if projected flat. Talk about looking through a keyhole!Problem #4: It's really a lousy movie. It's way too long; there's very little continuity and can often be rather confusing, even with a narrator to tie it together (somewhat). The script is terrible; the actors are doing the best they can with lousy dialog but are completely wasted in this picture; little is done with the camera compared to any other dramatic film - it just sits there most of the time, as if you are supposed to be a distant bystander (""distant"" being the operative word here). Except for the very few extreme closeup shots (big noses) and one or two single-lens-camera shots inserted into the action sequences, it is impossible to see facial expressions. The major action scenes are great, but also suffer in continuity and can be confusing. How did the water tower sequence get into the trailer and not the movie???The only reason to buy this title is for the documentary, a handful of action sequences, and the picture-postcard panoramas. The commentary tracks offer a lot of nice-to-know information but once you know it, better to turn it off and listen to the music.

Narrator, Spencer Tracy: [speaking about the Civil War] ""After Shiloh, the South never smiled.""The monumental undertaking of building the transcontinental railroad is a sight to see, coupled with the dusty wagon trains and hostile Indians, plus a few scenes of lousy treatment the American Indians received at the hands of unscrupulousness, ruthless land grabbing rouges and many of the railroad men. One railroad builder, Richard Widmark, always great in westerns, plays Mike King, who although a hard man of the West, finally sees the light in one respect, and says the Indians are getting ""railroaded.""This diverse western drama also includes riverboat men, high rolling gamblers, and of course quick draw gunmen plus low life outlaws like Eli Wallach.Each evolving adventure, spanning from the 1830's through the 1890's, is shown as tragedy separates the Prescott's in stunning, sweeping panoramic history lessons, of how America's wild West was eventually explored and settled, while always focusing on the trials and tribulations of the separated members of the Prescott family.When this motion picture was released on February 20th, 1963, it was distributed only to Cinerama movie theaters (semi-wrap-around wide screen), thus drawing very large crowds due to the edge-of-your-seat, roller-coaster-ride feeling the amazed audience got while watching big budget pictures filmed in the then, state-of-the-art tri-projection Cinerama process.The crisp, big screen photography vistas seen in this western masterpiece are simply breathtaking.The other paramount reason the public flocked to see this picture was the all star cast of very famous actors and actresses: John Wayne, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey, George Peppard, Robert Preston, Eli Wallach, Carroll Baker, Andy Devine, Walter Brennan, Debbie Reynolds, Jay C. Flippen, and even Lee Van Cleef who played a cold blooded as always, uncredited, river pirate.This epic film offered something for everyone's movie going preference in leading men and ladies of the early 1960's.A motion picture living legend narrated this fine film, Mr. Spencer Tracy. ""The West, it had to be won from nature and from primitive man.""Mr. Alfred Newman. one of Hollywood's greatest musical conductor's beginning was chosen to produce triumphant thundering score. Mr. Newman won more Oscars for musical scoring of movies than any other composer in the history of the Academy Awards, a total of (9)! MGM picked the right man.A historical sample of over 250 orchestral suites Mr. Newman either directed or conducted, placed him at the top of his profession.Here is a very short listing: The Grapes of Wrath (1940), I Cover the Waterfront (1933), Wuthering Heights (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939),The Song of Bernadette (1943), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), Call Northside 777 (1948), Twelve O'Clock High (1949), The Robe (1953), The King and I (1956), The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), Firecreek (1968) and Mr. Newman last movie score being Airport (1970).How The West Was Won is massive screen pure Americana. If possible always best viewed in the breathtaking original format of Cinerama. Reportedly there are two remaining Cinerama theaters in America. One is listed as being in Hollywood and the other Dayton, Ohio.How The West Was Won recalls the regrettable ending of an happier moving going era, in the busy heart of downtown, as a family, was always a grand, exciting experience, from the lavish lobby entrance to the double and sometimes triple elegant looking balconies with their plush seating, while you anticipated those long, red velvet movie screen curtain slowly draws open, for the magnificent, Oscar awarded motion picture which has just been reviewed.",5,The West!

The 3-70mm camera Cinerama experience was far more important than the actual movie but it was fantastic! Actually, I went back and saw this movie three times, all because of Cinerama.I love westerns, always have, but this one, from a pure movie standpoint, is not great. You can easily see the different director's styles as the film moves from era to era and sometimes the acting and writing is, to be charitable, weak. Nonetheless, the scope and beauty is undeniable.Now, this digital transfer is here and it's outstanding in every way. Blu Ray really does it justice and anyone who considers older films unworthy for HD release should see this. It's not pristine but it's up there with the best and the ""lines"" separating the three camera screens, so evident in the original, has been nearly eliminated . Surprisingly, the ""Smilebox"" format works very well, simulating the original three camera experience. I found myself sitting on the floor in front of my usual sofa seating position and creeping closer and closer to my 60"" Sony. It brought back fond memories of the original viewings at the Uptown.In fact, I'm going back to see it again tomorrow night!arkiedan",5,A terrific transfer!,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,1267,"['saw', 'movie', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Uptown', 'Theater', 'only', 'true', 'Cinerama', 'theater', 'town', '3-70mm', 'camera', 'Cinerama', 'experience', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'actual', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Actually', 'went', 'back', 'saw', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'Cinerama.I', 'love', 'westerns', 'always', 'have', 'one', 'pure', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'not', 'great', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'different', 'director', 'styles', 'film', 'moves', 'era', 'era', 'sometimes', 'acting', 'writing', 'be', 'charitable', 'weak', 'Nonetheless', 'scope', 'beauty', 'undeniable.Now', 'digital', 'transfer', 'here', 'outstanding', 'way', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'really', 'justice', 'anyone', 'who', 'older', 'films', 'unworthy', 'HD', 'release', 'should', 'see', 'not', 'pristine', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'lines', 'separating', 'three', 'camera', 'screens', 'so', 'evident', 'original', 'been', 'nearly', 'eliminated', 'Surprisingly', 'Smilebox', 'format', 'very', 'well', 'simulating', 'original', 'three', 'camera', 'experience', 'found', 'sitting', 'floor', 'front', 'usual', 'sofa', 'seating', 'position', 'creeping', 'closer', 'closer', '60', 'Sony', 'brought', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', 'original', 'viewings', 'Uptown.In', 'fact', ""'m"", 'going', 'back', 'see', 'again', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'arkiedan']",How the West Was Won

I first saw it as a child in Philly when it first came out, a family event in going to the movies. Even then, I was engrossed in the images and in the music (I'm a classical musician).As an adult, I have come to realize that the script is one of the worst in a major movie (some lines are completely incoherent or completely cliche and dialogue flow that makes no sense).  Many plot devises are of B-movie caliber; Its amazing that the script won the Oscar that year! And, of course, there's Debbie Reynold's music numbers...The film has an all-star cast--many of the greats of Hollywood.  Most of them are giving embarressing performances--as if they just phoned it in--or getting into cliche stereotype performances to capture the cliche western figure they represent.And the last segment--glorifying the urbanization and modern destruction of much of the land--well, that was done prior to any type of environmental awareness and is hoot to watch today.With all of this, this movie stongly effected me (as a child) with western images that really stuck.

It might not be a history lesson on how the U.S. developed, but it certainly reflects and sums up, some of the values and faults that still pervade American society today.It's a sincere expression of love for one's Country and as such it is a true love declaration.Despite being just a buggled up product, spanning the early 1820sto the ""the fight against outlaws"" in the late 1890s, taking one family of settlers as an example, all in it, is America as we know it.Although naive in scope, I love this spectacle, probably because there is something for everybody's taste in it.I can only hope that the people at MGM or at Warners come finally to their senses and will finally release the full widescreen edition of the movie.For the rest, what can I say?

142501,A1YANPSNHCKRYW,0792839072,"Philip Smith, Bookseller","[4, 4]","This new restoration of ""How the West Was Won"" is certainly a significant improvement over previous video releases (and is also superior to a 35mm anamorphic print I have seen). The color here may be a bit too red, but in general the picture looks very good and the compositing and color regularization of the three Cinerama panels is nothing short of miraculous.There is also an excellent 90 minute documentary on the Cinerama process that I found even more engaging than the film.I won't go into the intricacies of the aspect ratio question, but the resolved widescreen image appears to include the entire screen image (which is, I think, somewhat wider than the original Cinerama presentation would have been, on account of the optical correction of the screen curvature). Amazon currently lists this as ""1.33:1,"" which is of course incorrect (even the supplementary documentary is anamorphic widescreen).Sadly, though, the DVD release does not contain the additional ""SmileBox"" transfer that is included with the Blu-ray release.  This provides a simulation of the deep screen curvature of Cinerama and, from the looks of the many clips included in the supplemental documentary that are in this format, it provides a much closer approximation of the intended theatrical experience than a flattened transfer, no matter how optically scrupulous.  For this reason, I would discourage anyone from buying the DVD version who expects to make the switch to Blu-Ray in the foreseeable future.A nice transfer, but the absence of the SmileBox version left me feeling less than satisfied with this release.",4,"Impressive 2008 Restoration, but DVD Lacks SmileBox Version Included with Blu-ray Release",1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,1599,"['new', 'restoration', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'certainly', 'significant', 'improvement', 'previous', 'video', 'releases', 'also', 'superior', '35mm', 'anamorphic', 'print', 'have', 'seen', 'color', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'red', 'general', 'picture', 'very', 'good', 'compositing', 'color', 'regularization', 'three', 'Cinerama', 'panels', 'nothing', 'short', 'also', 'excellent', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'engaging', 'film.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'intricacies', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'question', 'resolved', 'widescreen', 'image', 'include', 'entire', 'screen', 'image', 'think', 'somewhat', 'wider', 'original', 'Cinerama', 'presentation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'account', 'optical', 'correction', 'screen', 'curvature', 'Amazon', 'currently', '1.33:1', 'course', 'incorrect', 'even', 'supplementary', 'documentary', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '.Sadly', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'contain', 'additional', 'SmileBox', 'transfer', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'simulation', 'deep', 'screen', 'curvature', 'Cinerama', 'looks', 'many', 'clips', 'included', 'supplemental', 'documentary', 'are', 'format', 'much', 'closer', 'approximation', 'intended', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'flattened', 'transfer', 'matter', 'how', 'optically', 'scrupulous', 'reason', 'would', 'discourage', 'anyone', 'buying', 'DVD', 'version', 'who', 'make', 'switch', 'Blu-Ray', 'foreseeable', 'future.A', 'nice', 'transfer', 'absence', 'SmileBox', 'version', 'left', 'feeling', 'less', 'satisfied', 'release']",How the West Was Won

The movie takes us through the early days of western settlement to post civil war days.  The cast is full of Hollywood legends including Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden, Debbie Reynolds and Gregory Peck.  George Peppard and Richard Widmark also have roles. It's fun to see so many stars in one movie, though most of time they don't appear together on screen. One complaint is that the film was the first to be filmed with a three camera method and in certain scenes, you can see seams in the print where the film was spliced together.  That is a minor complaint as the film itself is a compelling story and is beautifully filmed, with lush Old West settings.

Like many other films of the period, ""How the West Was Won"" was made to directly compete with the burgeoning television audience by presenting a theater experience that could not be duplicated at home.  With stunning locations, exquisitely choreographed wagon train journeys, a thrilling train robbery attempt, and a heart-stopping ride down the rapids, the film gave new meaning to THE BIG SCREEN.Alfred Newman's score is on-the-mark, breathtakingly assisting the story line of settlers moving west and the dangers/problems they encountered.As mentioned earlier, the cast is huge, but one can say the Debbie Reynolds carries most of the picture, for her character is pivotal to the story developments and she is seen throughout the film's running time.Also, character acting legend Thelma Ritter gets a chance to get in a few well-placed sarcastic ""zingers"" that she delivered so well in her long and respected career.The featurette includes stuntman Loren Janes reflecting on the contribution that he and others of his craft made to the making of this film.The main complaint, as mentioned by other reviewers, is that the print from which this DVD was transfered is not the best.  A movie of this magnitude deserves a ""restored"" version with clearer picture and less ""squiggles"".In addition to the aforementioned shortcoming, the DVD widescreen presentation is unable to reproduce the CINERAMA experience, yielding scenes where characters, though obviously in the scene, were not visible to the viewer, with only their voices being heard or parts of their bodies being visible.Moreover, the film's producers should have been aware of a changing America and, at least, inserted some people of color somewhere in the film.  Fleeting glimpses of Chinese train workers are shown but not enough to show their contributions to the development of the West.Of course, Native Americans are portrayed in the typical manner of the past, either as hollering marauders descending on ""hapless"" settlers or ignorant ""savages"" fascinated by ""civilized"" technology.And buffalo are shown but no BUFFALO SOLDIERS!",4,"Where were Heston, Lancaster, and Douglas?",1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,2202,"['Charlton', 'Burt', 'Kirk', 'were', 'only', 'big', 'names', 'were', 'not', 'involved', '1963', 'release', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'period', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'was', 'made', 'directly', 'compete', 'burgeoning', 'television', 'audience', 'presenting', 'theater', 'experience', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'duplicated', 'home', 'stunning', 'locations', 'exquisitely', 'choreographed', 'wagon', 'train', 'journeys', 'thrilling', 'train', 'robbery', 'attempt', 'heart-stopping', 'ride', 'rapids', 'film', 'gave', 'new', 'meaning', 'THE', 'BIG', 'SCREEN.Alfred', 'Newman', 'score', 'on-the-mark', 'breathtakingly', 'assisting', 'story', 'line', 'settlers', 'moving', 'west', 'dangers/problems', 'encountered.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'cast', 'huge', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'most', 'picture', 'character', 'pivotal', 'story', 'developments', 'seen', 'film', 'running', 'time.Also', 'character', 'acting', 'legend', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'chance', 'get', 'few', 'well-placed', 'sarcastic', 'zingers', 'delivered', 'so', 'well', 'long', 'respected', 'career.The', 'featurette', 'stuntman', 'Loren', 'Janes', 'reflecting', 'contribution', 'others', 'craft', 'made', 'making', 'film.The', 'main', 'complaint', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'print', 'DVD', 'was', 'transfered', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'magnitude', 'restored', 'version', 'clearer', 'picture', 'less', 'squiggles', '.In', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'shortcoming', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'unable', 'reproduce', 'CINERAMA', 'experience', 'yielding', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'though', 'obviously', 'scene', 'were', 'not', 'visible', 'viewer', 'only', 'voices', 'being', 'heard', 'parts', 'bodies', 'being', 'visible.Moreover', 'film', 'producers', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'aware', 'changing', 'America', 'least', 'inserted', 'people', 'color', 'somewhere', 'film', 'Fleeting', 'glimpses', 'Chinese', 'train', 'workers', 'are', 'shown', 'not', 'enough', 'show', 'contributions', 'development', 'West.Of', 'course', 'Native', 'Americans', 'are', 'portrayed', 'typical', 'manner', 'past', 'hollering', 'marauders', 'descending', 'hapless', 'settlers', 'ignorant', 'savages', 'fascinated', 'civilized', 'technology.And', 'buffalo', 'are', 'shown', 'BUFFALO', 'SOLDIERS']",How the West Was Won

First that came to mind was ""How the West Was Won"". It's loads of fun, and was Oscar winner for Sound and Editing and...er...Best Original Screenplay (?). That silly Academy. Who knows who voted for what back then, or why... Still, it's very entertaining. Acting, I guess was supposed to be hammy, but I did enjoy George Peppard and Carroll Baker. Debbie Reynold had moments of ingenuity, perhaps she was auditioning for ""Molly Brown"" when she made this. Gregory Peck, just off his Oscar win as Atticus, approached Debbie in a love scene like he was still in the courtroom, pleading his case. That was silly, too. Who cares?! I saw this in the Cinerama theatre back in 1963 as a teenager, and I was moved and entertained. One previous reviewer compained about the splicing of the 3 cameras, but it was a small distraction. This version (1998) has a 2.65:1 ratio which shows almost all of the Cinerama screen. Perhaps the wise men at the Academy didn't understand Fellini's ""8 ""; I didn't either, back then. Everyone hated Kazan, so ""America America"" had no hope of winning.  The other nominees were the Italian ""Four Days of Naples"" and the very good ""Love With the Proper Stranger"". Hmm.

That was just the process. For the audience, it was shire pleasure seeing this giant curved wrap-a-round screen of technology.But the sound is another story. In Cinerama the sound was magnetic and offered lots of stereo channels to follow the voices of the cast, special sound effects and the wonderful music score.

Grimm"" and ""How the West Was Won"" is why the DVD release has unavoidably two lines running down the middle, and the strange effect of, say, a wagon rolling horizontally seeming to be constantly riding in a warped circle. This is because of the three screens being flattened back onto a straight surface.One more thing: Alfred Newman's great score for ""How the West Was Won"" is truly one of the greatest western film scores in history (even quoted in other films as a quintessential western score -- check out the Western fantasy sequence in ""Romancing the Stone"") and to hear it in true 5.1 sound is worth the price alone!",4,Incorrect info,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,2671,"['admirer', 'original', 'film', 'seeing', 'original', 'three-screen', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'hate', 'inform', 'released', 'Europe', 'first', 'was', 'NOT', 'first', 'narrative', 'feature', 'film', 'three-screen', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'was', 'last', 'George', 'Pal', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1962', 'three-screen', 'process', 'still', 'have', 'original', 'road-show', 'souvenir', 'book', 'clearly', 'Bros.', 'Grimm', 'was', 'first', 'How', 'West', 'was', 'Won', 'was', 'second', 'then', 'so', 'much', 'revenue', 'being', 'generated', 'ordinary', 'theatrical', 'release', 'company', 'was', 'forced', 'make', 'compromise', 'single-lens', 'single-curved', 'screen', 'process', 'future', 'Cinerama', 'productions', 'was', 'initiated', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'followed', 'such', 'films', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'John', 'Sturges', 'Hallelujah', 'Trail', 'just', 'needed', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'admirer', 'original', 'film', 'seeing', 'original', 'three-screen', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'hate', 'inform', 'released', 'Europe', 'first', 'was', 'NOT', 'first', 'narrative', 'feature', 'film', 'three-screen', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'was', 'last', '.George', 'Pal', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1962', 'three-screen', 'process', 'still', 'have', 'original', 'road-show', 'souvenir', 'book', 'clearly', 'Bros.', 'Grimm', 'was', 'first', 'How', 'West', 'was', 'Won', 'was', 'second', 'then', 'so', 'much', 'revenue', 'being', 'generated', 'ordinary', 'theatrical', 'release', 'company', 'was', 'forced', 'make', 'compromise', 'single-lens', 'single-curved', 'screen', 'process', 'future', 'Cinerama', 'productions', 'was', 'initiated', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'followed', 'such', 'films', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'John', 'Sturges', 'Hallelujah', 'Trail', 'just', 'needed', 'get', 'facts', 'straight', 'here.Incidentally', 'three-lens', 'three-screen', 'process', 'Bros.', 'Grimm', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'why', 'DVD', 'release', 'unavoidably', 'two', 'lines', 'running', 'down', 'middle', 'strange', 'effect', 'say', 'wagon', 'rolling', 'horizontally', 'seeming', 'be', 'constantly', 'riding', 'warped', 'circle', 'three', 'screens', 'being', 'flattened', 'back', 'straight', 'surface.One', 'more', 'thing', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'great', 'score', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'western', 'film', 'scores', 'history', 'even', 'quoted', 'other', 'films', 'quintessential', 'western', 'score', 'check', 'out', 'Western', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'Romancing', 'Stone', 'hear', 'true', '5.1', 'sound', 'price', 'alone']",How the West Was Won

The fully restored classic American film, the top box office hit of 1962, is stunning.And the Blu-ray hi-def transfer is truly breathtaking.  I literally gasped when I saw it.  And so have special preview audiences of the hi-def DVD.Warner -- which owns the pre 1986 MGM library -- has spent a ton of dough getting this right.  Six years, hundreds of people, thousands of hours and millions of dollars have been invested in creating and applying new technology that has virtually erased the ""join lines"" that marred the earlier -- rather hideous -- video transfers.  Not only that, but every frame has been restored.  That's the equivalent of restoring three 35 MM films -- the original was exposed using three alligned cameras.  The final aspect ratio is 2.89:1 (that's nearly three times as wide as it is high).  And it is a wondrous sight to behold.Seeing this new version is like experiencing the film for the first time.  The familiar story -- based on a series in Life magazine -- follows three generations of a typical pioneer Ohio Valley family from 1839 to 1889.  A myriad of stars shine in this great American adventure -- John Wayne, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb and Carrol Baker are among the many recognizable faces.Three accomplished directors (including John Ford) helmed this rousing epic that does not degrade the Native American experience even as it allows for the conflicts the westward movement created.The absolutely stunning Blu-ray version inlcudes a ""smilebox"" transfer that mimics the original Cinerama experience of a giant curved screen.  On a large video display -- especially if projected on a big pull down screen -- this version is jaw-dropping.The extras include Rudy Strohmaier's much acclaimed documentary ""Cinerama Adventure.""  And there's a wonderful commentary by filmmaker Strohmaier, John Sittig (director of Cinerama, Inc.), film historian Rudy Behlmer, music historian Jon Burlingame and stuntman Loren James.  But why no Debbie Reynolds?The only other narrative three camera Cinerama film is ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" and  the stored negative has suffered water damage so there are no plans for a full restoration at this time.As a kid I saw this film at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood.  The impact of the big sound and images swept me away and I remember the experience vividly.  The rousing music, the involving heartland American story still works.  And thanks to cutting edge technology, it's better than ever.This is one for the digital library.",4,"RESTORED  BLU-RAY ""WEST"" IS BREATHTAKING",1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,2696,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'Cinerama', 'big', 'screen', 'release', 'only', 'know', 'previous', 'video', 'versions', 'HTWWW', 'are', 'big', 'treat', 'fully', 'restored', 'classic', 'American', 'film', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'hit', '1962', 'stunning.And', 'Blu-ray', 'hi-def', 'transfer', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'literally', 'gasped', 'when', 'saw', 'so', 'have', 'special', 'preview', 'audiences', 'hi-def', 'DVD.Warner', 'pre', '1986', 'MGM', 'library', 'spent', 'ton', 'dough', 'getting', 'right', 'Six', 'years', 'hundreds', 'people', 'thousands', 'hours', 'millions', 'dollars', 'have', 'been', 'invested', 'creating', 'applying', 'new', 'technology', 'virtually', 'erased', 'join', 'lines', 'marred', 'earlier', 'rather', 'hideous', 'video', 'transfers', 'Not', 'only', 'frame', 'been', 'restored', 'equivalent', 'restoring', 'three', '35', 'MM', 'films', 'original', 'was', 'exposed', 'using', 'three', 'alligned', 'cameras', 'final', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.89:1', 'nearly', 'three', 'times', 'as', 'wide', 'high', 'wondrous', 'sight', 'behold.Seeing', 'new', 'version', 'experiencing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'familiar', 'story', 'based', 'series', 'Life', 'magazine', 'three', 'generations', 'typical', 'pioneer', 'Ohio', 'Valley', 'family', '1839', '1889', 'myriad', 'stars', 'shine', 'great', 'American', 'adventure', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Lee', 'J.', 'Cobb', 'Carrol', 'Baker', 'are', 'many', 'recognizable', 'faces.Three', 'accomplished', 'directors', 'including', 'John', 'Ford', 'helmed', 'rousing', 'epic', 'not', 'degrade', 'Native', 'American', 'experience', 'even', 'conflicts', 'westward', 'movement', 'created.The', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'smilebox', 'transfer', 'original', 'Cinerama', 'experience', 'giant', 'curved', 'screen', 'large', 'video', 'display', 'especially', 'projected', 'big', 'pull', 'down', 'screen', 'version', 'jaw-dropping.The', 'extras', 'include', 'Rudy', 'Strohmaier', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'documentary', 'Cinerama', 'Adventure', 'wonderful', 'commentary', 'filmmaker', 'Strohmaier', 'John', 'Sittig', 'director', 'Cinerama', 'Inc.', 'film', 'historian', 'Rudy', 'Behlmer', 'music', 'historian', 'Jon', 'Burlingame', 'stuntman', 'Loren', 'James', 'why', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'only', 'other', 'narrative', 'three', 'camera', 'Cinerama', 'film', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'stored', 'negative', 'suffered', 'water', 'damage', 'so', 'are', 'plans', 'full', 'restoration', 'time.As', 'kid', 'saw', 'film', 'Cinerama', 'Dome', 'Hollywood', 'impact', 'big', 'sound', 'images', 'swept', 'away', 'remember', 'experience', 'vividly', 'rousing', 'music', 'involving', 'heartland', 'American', 'story', 'still', 'thanks', 'cutting', 'edge', 'technology', 'better', 'ever.This', 'one', 'digital', 'library']",How the West Was Won

As a story it is badly flawed. Probably it was desperate last attempt to entice more people back to the theaters as the  movie studios so feared TV, the production added a couple of dozen top stars to the super expensive Cinerama process. In the theater, Cinerama is spectacular; on the flat screen if has a strange prospective, such as a scene where the wagons seem to be traveling in half circles.  The &#34;smile&#34; process that attempts to simulate the curved screen does not look as good as the flat screen version.  Don't waste your money on buying the book packaging with the &#34;smile&#34; disc.The best part of this movie is the music and Debbie Reynolds singing. The plots of the separate stories are terrible and some of the setups laughable; examples: After going through rapids and loosing a raft a surviving daughter decides to homestead this section of the river as a steamboat is shown in the background going up the broad, flat stream. Then there is a shot of three men in an settler's wagon shooting at Native Americans--the wagon, supposed to hold all the worldly family goods, is bare. In the outlaw story the hero is supposed to be a federal marshall and in at least one shot is wearing his badge, but the local sheriff, his friend not only tries to run him out of town but to disarm him with the excuse that the marshall is &#34;making trouble;&#34; I couldn't believe this story line.I didn't see any Blacks in the movie and there may have been a 1 second shot of someone wearing a coolie hat at the gold claim to represent the Chinese--this was a whites only depiction of our history.The Southwest story is partly set in Monument Valley; not only a cliche by this time but the setting is hardly taken advantage of.",2,Over rated Hollywood monster,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1888,"['movie', 'marvel', 'technology', 'complexity', 'making', 'actual', 'plots', 'are', 'incredible', 'viewing', 'experience', 'TV', 'weird', 'story', 'badly', 'flawed', 'Probably', 'was', 'desperate', 'last', 'attempt', 'entice', 'more', 'people', 'back', 'theaters', 'movie', 'studios', 'so', 'feared', 'TV', 'production', 'added', 'couple', 'dozen', 'top', 'stars', 'super', 'expensive', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'theater', 'Cinerama', 'spectacular', 'flat', 'screen', 'strange', 'prospective', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'wagons', 'seem', 'be', 'traveling', 'half', 'circles', '34', 'smile', '34', 'process', 'simulate', 'curved', 'screen', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'flat', 'screen', 'version', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'book', 'packaging', '34', 'smile', '34', 'disc.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'music', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'singing', 'plots', 'separate', 'stories', 'are', 'terrible', 'setups', 'laughable', 'examples', 'going', 'rapids', 'loosing', 'raft', 'surviving', 'daughter', 'decides', 'homestead', 'section', 'river', 'steamboat', 'shown', 'background', 'going', 'up', 'broad', 'flat', 'stream', 'Then', 'shot', 'three', 'men', 'settler', 'wagon', 'shooting', 'Native', 'Americans', 'wagon', 'supposed', 'hold', 'worldly', 'family', 'goods', 'bare', 'outlaw', 'story', 'hero', 'supposed', 'be', 'federal', 'marshall', 'least', 'one', 'shot', 'wearing', 'badge', 'local', 'sheriff', 'friend', 'not', 'only', 'run', 'town', 'disarm', 'excuse', 'marshall', '34', 'making', 'trouble', '34', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'story', 'line.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Blacks', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', '1', 'second', 'shot', 'someone', 'wearing', 'coolie', 'hat', 'gold', 'claim', 'represent', 'Chinese', 'was', 'whites', 'only', 'depiction', 'history.The', 'Southwest', 'story', 'partly', 'set', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'not', 'only', 'cliche', 'time', 'setting', 'hardly', 'taken', 'advantage']",How the West Was Won

First of all, the three-camera angle image is NOT completely erased...you can still see it when scenes change. It looks like it was airbrushed out and you can even notice a difference in the Technicolor print.  Second of all, the sound in not much better than the original one-disc version in 5.1 Surround and there is a slight pause or muting of the sound at the very end of the first two chapters, which is very noticeable. The best scoring of the film is at the beginning during the credits and should be more powerful, but it is not...it sounds different right from the beginning and a little distorted...Also the sticker on the outside of the shrink wrap says"" over 4 hours of bonus feature content""..this is totally false..all it has is a documentary ""Cinerama Adventure"" on the third disc, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes...the rest is commentaries over the film and a theatrical trailer on the first disc.  They even had to chop this film in half and put it on two discs...it is only 2 hours and 44 minutes...give me a break! This completely ruins the continuity of the film. It could have fit intact on one complete disc, which would in turn kept the price down. If TITANIC fit on one disc and several other films, this should have too.

It's a great film though . . .There are essentially five acts or interlocking stories based on western themes, bound together via the saga of a pioneer family through three generations. The storylines are realistic, the actors familiar and wonderful (even in 'minor' roles), and the action sequences especially well crafted. If the drama is a bit uneven at times, well . . . maybe so was life. Though essentially reassigned from an acting role at the last moment, Spencer Tracy ties everything together nicely through his comfortable narration.'How The West Was Won' was filmed using a three-camera process designed for projection onto a giant 146 degree curved screen in order to increase depth perception and audience inclusiveness to presentation. Film from the three cameras was formatted and synchronized into aligned panels, which worked spectacularly well when viewed as intended. The aspect ratio therefore was very wide--2.55:1.  Cinerama was the rage of the 1950s and into the early 60s. The Dimension 150 craze of the late 60s and into the 70s was a pale imitation of the true three-camera process; so sorry, 2001 fans.Because of design parameters and the necessary curved screen, the film has never translated adequately to television. By cutting to center (older model televisions), many very important visual elements to either end of the original were often not seen, though you can often hear the dialogue and other goings-on otherwise. And for years you could see the joined camera segments as major distortions.The three-disc special edition is a significantly improved version of this great classic. The film (two discs) has been cleaned up, removing much of more blatantly translated panel lines, in addition to the washout and blurring that's been incurred since the advent of VHS. Even so, be aware that when presented on a flat screen--especially the large monitors we have available to us today--you will still perceive the images as being sometimes `wonky.' Even knowing these limitations, one can enjoy the history of it all plus the end-product.The original seven-channel (!) stereophonic sound has been re-mixed and formatted to Dolby 5.1; it's really quite beautifully done. The 1997 reissue of the soundtrack is readily available today.The third disc is a comprehensive documentary of the development of Cinerama from its origins to the more familiar 70mm wide-screen films.How The West Was Won is one of those bits of classic film that should be on any Western aficionado's video shelf.Five StarsRussell de Ville18 June 2013",5,Excellent Portrayal of the West!,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2724,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'television', 'years', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'Big', 'Screen', 'certainly', 'not', 'original', 'Cinerama', 'format', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'essentially', 'five', 'acts', 'interlocking', 'stories', 'based', 'western', 'themes', 'together', 'saga', 'pioneer', 'family', 'three', 'generations', 'storylines', 'are', 'realistic', 'actors', 'familiar', 'wonderful', 'even', ""'minor"", 'roles', 'action', 'especially', 'well', 'crafted', 'drama', 'bit', 'uneven', 'times', 'well', 'maybe', 'so', 'was', 'life', 'Though', 'essentially', 'reassigned', 'acting', 'role', 'last', 'moment', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'ties', 'everything', 'together', 'nicely', 'comfortable', 'narration', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'was', 'filmed', 'using', 'three-camera', 'process', 'designed', 'projection', 'giant', '146', 'degree', 'curved', 'screen', 'order', 'increase', 'depth', 'perception', 'audience', 'inclusiveness', 'presentation', 'Film', 'three', 'cameras', 'was', 'formatted', 'synchronized', 'aligned', 'panels', 'worked', 'spectacularly', 'well', 'when', 'viewed', 'intended', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'therefore', 'was', 'very', 'wide', '2.55:1', 'Cinerama', 'was', 'rage', '1950s', 'early', '60s', 'Dimension', '150', 'craze', 'late', '60s', '70s', 'was', 'pale', 'imitation', 'true', 'three-camera', 'process', 'sorry', '2001', 'fans.Because', 'design', 'parameters', 'necessary', 'curved', 'screen', 'film', 'never', 'translated', 'adequately', 'television', 'cutting', 'center', 'older', 'model', 'televisions', 'many', 'very', 'important', 'visual', 'elements', 'end', 'original', 'were', 'often', 'not', 'seen', 'can', 'often', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'other', 'goings-on', 'otherwise', 'years', 'could', 'see', 'joined', 'camera', 'segments', 'major', 'distortions.The', 'three-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'significantly', 'improved', 'version', 'great', 'classic', 'film', 'two', 'discs', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'removing', 'much', 'more', 'blatantly', 'translated', 'panel', 'lines', 'addition', 'washout', 'blurring', 'been', 'incurred', 'advent', 'VHS', 'Even', 'so', 'be', 'aware', 'when', 'presented', 'flat', 'screen', 'especially', 'large', 'monitors', 'have', 'available', 'today', 'will', 'still', 'perceive', 'images', 'being', 'sometimes', 'wonky', 'Even', 'knowing', 'limitations', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'history', 'end-product.The', 'original', 'seven-channel', 'stereophonic', 'sound', 'been', 're-mixed', 'formatted', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'really', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'done', '1997', 'reissue', 'soundtrack', 'readily', 'available', 'today.The', 'third', 'disc', 'comprehensive', 'documentary', 'development', 'Cinerama', 'origins', 'more', 'familiar', '70mm', 'wide-screen', 'films.How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'one', 'bits', 'classic', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'Western', 'aficionado', 'video', 'shelf.Five', 'StarsRussell', 'de', 'Ville18', 'June', '2013']",How the West Was Won

Not even all of the featured Hollywood stars could rescue this Disneyesque look at America's westward expansion. The most interesting thing was the documentary extra on the Cinerama process and how it influenced all subsequent films. This is how widescreen was born. But the use of Cinerama for this film makes many scenes look awkward, as the characters eyes don't quite meet in a number of scenes, since the camera used three lenses and the actors had to ""guesstimate"" where, exactly, the other actor would appear on the curved Cinerama screen. Closeups were also impossible. Cinerama was made for big, expansive scenes, of which HTWWW has many. The directors actually had to compose their shots based upon the camera's unique characteristics. While some scenes were gorgeous, even displaying it in HD on my 106"" projection screen looked awkward, because it was made for Cinerama's curved screen.

The two ""un-seam-ly"" overlap lines that marred ALL previous showings, releases, and formats are almost totally and miraculously unnoticeable on both blu-ray discs!

This film may not fully correct this, but it does provide an idea of what the United States' cultural roots have been.The story begins tracing the story of a family migrating from the eastern states to the frontier of the time, and of a mountain man, a trapper who interacted with western American Indians well beyond the explored lands.  The family meets tragedy, with one of the daughters and the mountain man falling in love, and the other daughter -- a free spirit of the time -- living a wilder life as a singer and entertainer.From the post-revolutionary world through the Civil War and beyond, the stories of the two branches of the family are shown, covering the sweep of historic events until the close of the 19th Century, not counting a rapid epilog.The film was sjot in Cinerama, using the original three-camera process, so thwere is a discernable jiggle at the two joins between the photos, and naturally, the scope of the original is literally minimized on the average video screen.  Yet this is counterbalamced by really striking scenes of the untamed wiorld of the pioneers.The film is also more honest than many is the dealings between the settlers and the American Indians, showing cases of how treaties were broken, and the natural reaction for such actions.The film has formidible star power, with many of the top stars from the time it was shot present in significant roles.Hardly a perfect film, but it does provide some perspective of how the nation developed.",4,Historic Panorama,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,1585,"['days', 'American', 'history', 'been', 'minimized', 'schools', 'guise', 'cultural', 'diversity', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'fully', 'correct', 'provide', 'idea', 'what', 'United', 'States', 'cultural', 'roots', 'have', 'been.The', 'story', 'tracing', 'story', 'family', 'migrating', 'eastern', 'states', 'frontier', 'time', 'mountain', 'man', 'trapper', 'who', 'interacted', 'western', 'American', 'Indians', 'well', 'explored', 'lands', 'family', 'tragedy', 'one', 'daughters', 'mountain', 'man', 'falling', 'love', 'other', 'daughter', 'free', 'spirit', 'time', 'living', 'wilder', 'life', 'singer', 'entertainer.From', 'post-revolutionary', 'world', 'Civil', 'War', 'stories', 'two', 'branches', 'family', 'are', 'shown', 'covering', 'sweep', 'historic', 'events', 'close', '19th', 'Century', 'not', 'counting', 'rapid', 'epilog.The', 'film', 'was', 'sjot', 'Cinerama', 'using', 'original', 'three-camera', 'process', 'so', 'discernable', 'jiggle', 'two', 'joins', 'photos', 'naturally', 'scope', 'original', 'literally', 'minimized', 'average', 'video', 'screen', 'counterbalamced', 'really', 'striking', 'scenes', 'untamed', 'wiorld', 'pioneers.The', 'film', 'also', 'more', 'honest', 'many', 'dealings', 'settlers', 'American', 'Indians', 'showing', 'cases', 'how', 'treaties', 'were', 'broken', 'natural', 'reaction', 'such', 'actions.The', 'film', 'formidible', 'star', 'power', 'many', 'top', 'stars', 'time', 'was', 'shot', 'present', 'significant', 'roles.Hardly', 'perfect', 'film', 'provide', 'perspective', 'how', 'nation', 'developed']",How the West Was Won

It has been fully restored to full clarity 1080P HD with no artifacts or distortion of any kind and 98% of the film has been digitally fixed so the joint lines from the three strips of the cinerama version are vertially undetectable in this movie. In earlier home video releases the left and right parts of the screen were left the way the film was shot causing the characters to suddenly look stretched out a tiny bit due to the cinerama version being shown on a flat screen and not curved like it was in theaters originally. But Warner Brothers studio took and curved the end of the screen upward and then took and made the film straight all the way across so the film looks like it was filmed with only one camera and not three. So now the film looks the way it is supposed to for a flat screen. And the three parts of the film have been carefully restored so they all match up in quality. This is the best version of this film to date. It truly does look like something Warner Brothers spend millions even billions of dollars to restore. And I have never an old film like this look so breathtaking in it's restoration than this blu-ray version. The only other film that looks as good in it's restoration is BEN HUR. This is the way all classic movies should look when restored properly. My hat goes off to Warner Bros. for their wonderful restoration!

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[0, 0]","Though it lacks the austere B&W; artistry and thematic complexity of Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946) or Hawks' RED RIVER (1948), the all star HOW THE WEST WAS WON (1963, MGM) may be the most enjoyable western of all time and something wholly suitable for family viewing.  But for heaven's sake get the letterboxed VHS tape or DVD version that does justice to the vast three-strip Cinerama photography.  The pan/scan tape cuts off 60% of the movie!  You can still see where the vertical seam lines are, which someone else here really complained about.  They did not bother me at all and they help explain the fluctuating color within a scene.James R. Webb's Oscar-winning screenplay is divided into five segments: ""The River"", ""The Plains,"" ""The Civil War"", ""The Railroad,"" and ""The Outlaws.""  The movie employs the talents of three distinguished western filmmakers.  John Ford directed ""The Civil War"", which mostly focuses on the bloody Battle of Shiloh.  George Marshall did ""The Railroad"", about the building of the Transcontinental railroad in the late 19th Century.  And Henry Hathaway directed everything up to the intermission, plus the last segment.  And this baby needed five of Hollywood's best cinematographers:  Joseph LaShelle (THE APARTMENT), Charles Lang Jr. (SOME LIKE IT HOT), William Daniels (Greta Garbo's favorite), and Milton Krasner.  A movie that starts along the Erie Canal in 1830 takes us, over a sprawling and engrossing 165 minutes, to the Pacific Ocean in the 1960's.  It is a stupendous filmmaking achievement.The cast is just wonderful and full of fun cameos.  But basically we follow the Prescott family over three generations as they marry and move across the continent.  Mom and Dad Prescott (Agnes Moorehead and Karl Malden) drown while river rafting, which is one awesome scene in Cinerama.  Their daughters, Eve (Carroll Baker) and Lilith (Debbie Reynolds) survive.  This may be Baker and Reynolds' finest performances. Eve gets romantically involved with mountain man Linus Rawlings (James Stewart), while Lilith gravitates between wagon train boss Robert Preston and riverboat gambler Gregory Peck.  Intermission.Eve gets married to Linus, and their son Zeb (George Peppard) fights in the Civil War--and survives to help build the Transcontinental railroad.  We are four-fifths of the way through the almost-three hour movie, with Richard Widmark in a vivid supporting role as an unsympathetic railroad building boss and Henry Fonda as mountain man Jethro Stewart.  A buffalo stampede was filmed in South Dakota and again seems designed for Cinerama.  It comes at you from all sides.Let's leave part five a secret because I don't want to give away the whole plot, just enough of it to make you want to buy this masterpiece on letterboxed DVD.  I will say that Alfred Newman's music score is maybe his best ever, blended with the evocative Whiskeyhill Singers singing ""Shenandoah,"" the title song, and especially ""Home in the Meadow.""  Debbie Reynolds also does some lovely singing in one of my all-time favorite music scores.  The DVD includes a good fifteen minutes of Newman's glorious roadshow overture, entr'acte, and exit music.Then there is the final scene, which takes us to the opposite end of the American continent.  It just might be my very favorite final scene in movie history, though THE SOUND OF MUSIC and PEYTON PLACE and CITY LIGHTS are close.

A bonafide epic, the film features an all-star cast that never disappoints, and there are a variety of moments in the film that are truly inspiring and magnificent.  What damages viewing enjoyment is a combination of a washed-out print and the attempt to retain the film's original aspect ratio by leaving in vertical lines where the Cinerama process would have allowed the image to ""wrap"" wider than a normal movie screen.  Both of these problems could have been fixed with some relatively simple computer processes, but it appears that the DVD manufacturer simply found an old print of the film and digitized it as is.  (I've noticed, too, that the DVD doesn't always play well in my player, skipping quite a bit.)  That's a shame because ""How the West Was Won"" is a grandiose exercise--an attempt to tell the story of European expansion into the West through the eyes of several generations of a single family.  Narrated by the great Spencer Tracy and starring the likes of Gregory Peck, Debbie Reynolds, Karl Malden, Jimmy Stewart, and others, it's a treat for anyone who enjoys ""classic"" cinema.  It certainly was good enough for Ron Howard and Kevin Costner to rip off, er, be inspired by its scenes for some of their films.  What the manufacturer did do correctly, however, was retool the sound, so that Alfred Newman's (not the Mad magazine character) magnificent score sounds as robust and haunting as its supposed to.  True, the film glorifies a chapter in American history defined as much by greed, racism, and violence as it was by pioneerism, bravery, and sacrifice, but there's enough about the human spirit in ""How the West Was Won"" to temper its fairly narrow point-of-view about who really built this country and why.  If nothing else, it certainly reinforces the sense of community among mainstream Americans, as it taps into the typical mores, but squint hard enough and you might even see some people of color.",3,Good Story and Performances But a Cheesy DVD,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,2083,"['agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'poor', 'quality', 'image', 'DVD', 'not', 'quality', 'content', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'bonafide', 'epic', 'film', 'all-star', 'cast', 'never', 'disappoints', 'are', 'variety', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'magnificent', 'What', 'damages', 'viewing', 'enjoyment', 'combination', 'washed-out', 'print', 'attempt', 'retain', 'film', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'leaving', 'vertical', 'lines', 'where', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'image', 'wrap', 'wider', 'normal', 'movie', 'screen', 'problems', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'relatively', 'simple', 'computer', 'processes', 'DVD', 'manufacturer', 'simply', 'found', 'old', 'print', 'film', 'digitized', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'too', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'always', 'play', 'well', 'player', 'skipping', 'quite', 'bit', 'shame', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'grandiose', 'exercise', 'attempt', 'tell', 'story', 'European', 'expansion', 'West', 'eyes', 'several', 'generations', 'single', 'family', 'Narrated', 'great', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'starring', 'likes', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'others', 'treat', 'anyone', 'who', 'classic', 'cinema', 'certainly', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'rip', 'off', 'er', 'be', 'inspired', 'scenes', 'films', 'What', 'manufacturer', 'did', 'do', 'correctly', 'however', 'was', 'retool', 'sound', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'not', 'Mad', 'magazine', 'character', 'magnificent', 'score', 'robust', 'haunting', 'supposed', 'True', 'film', 'chapter', 'American', 'history', 'defined', 'much', 'greed', 'racism', 'violence', 'was', 'pioneerism', 'bravery', 'sacrifice', 'enough', 'human', 'spirit', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', 'temper', 'fairly', 'narrow', 'point-of-view', 'who', 'really', 'built', 'country', 'why', 'nothing', 'else', 'certainly', 'sense', 'community', 'mainstream', 'Americans', 'typical', 'mores', 'squint', 'hard', 'enough', 'might', 'even', 'see', 'people', 'color']",How the West Was Won
142534,AK61LQI92GTCH,0792839072,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[21, 59]","I kind of figured television was responsible for this... movie.  HOW THE WEST WAS WON dvd comes with a featurette on the making of the movie, in which we learn that the movie studios developed the Cinerama process (three cameras shot the movie which was projected onto three specially designed screens.  Think IMAX) to present an alternative ""viewing experience"" to compete with television.Watching this on television, even in a letterbox edition, is excruciating.  There are visible bars where the three screens meet.  Often the color in one screen doesn't jibe with that of the adjoining screen.Those defects could be corrected by digital manipulation, I suppose, but what's the point?  The Cinerama screen was meant to wrap around the audience and a television screen is flat.  What can't be corrected is the lack of close-ups and a surplus of dead space.Almost all the action takes place in the center panel, and the closest we get to the action is in a medium shot.  Most of the time there's nothing happening on the edge panels. Two-thirds of the screen is dead.  The only time Cinerama seemed to shine was when chaotic action was swiftly coming at the audience, which is why we are so often treated to onrushing trains and galloping horses and stampeding buffalo shot from a camera in the ground.  I think it would have taken a visual genius the likes of a Busby Berkeley to exploit Cinerama's potential without having to open the paddock.The featurette also tells us HTWWW had a cast of 12,000.  I guess maybe a dozen of them weren't miscast, but that's just a guess.  The movie opens with Jimmy Stewart, out of character as mountain man Linus Rawlings, canoeing along a river while Spencer Tracy narrates over the action: `(The land) known only to the lonely trappers wandering its vastness in search of beaver...' One and a half scenes later Linus skids his bark next to the Prescott campsite and gives Carroll Baker a pelt to stroke....Okay.  I was bored.  What can I say?  At least I was paying attention.  When Debbie Reynolds delivers a rousing rendition of  `Raise a Ruckus' for the despondent members of the wagon train I wasn't paying much attention at all.  By the time Eli Wallach was glaring daggers at George Peppard's kids I was wondering whether or not one should fill in that little hole in the middle of a dvd when you make it into a coaster.",1,Wake me when it's over,1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,2367,"['kind', 'figured', 'television', 'was', 'responsible', 'movie', 'WEST', 'WAS', 'WON', 'dvd', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'learn', 'movie', 'studios', 'developed', 'Cinerama', 'process', 'three', 'cameras', 'shot', 'movie', 'was', 'projected', 'three', 'specially', 'designed', 'screens', 'Think', 'IMAX', 'present', 'alternative', 'viewing', 'experience', 'compete', 'television.Watching', 'television', 'even', 'letterbox', 'edition', 'excruciating', 'are', 'visible', 'bars', 'where', 'three', 'screens', 'meet', 'color', 'one', 'screen', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'adjoining', 'screen.Those', 'defects', 'could', 'be', 'corrected', 'digital', 'manipulation', 'suppose', 'what', 'point', 'Cinerama', 'screen', 'was', 'meant', 'wrap', 'audience', 'television', 'screen', 'flat', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'corrected', 'lack', 'close-ups', 'surplus', 'dead', 'space.Almost', 'action', 'place', 'center', 'panel', 'closest', 'get', 'action', 'medium', 'shot', 'Most', 'time', 'nothing', 'happening', 'edge', 'panels', 'Two-thirds', 'screen', 'dead', 'only', 'time', 'Cinerama', 'seemed', 'shine', 'was', 'when', 'chaotic', 'action', 'was', 'swiftly', 'coming', 'audience', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'treated', 'onrushing', 'trains', 'galloping', 'horses', 'stampeding', 'buffalo', 'shot', 'camera', 'ground', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'visual', 'genius', 'likes', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'exploit', 'Cinerama', 'potential', 'having', 'open', 'paddock.The', 'featurette', 'also', 'HTWWW', 'had', 'cast', '12,000', 'guess', 'maybe', 'dozen', 'were', ""n't"", 'miscast', 'just', 'guess', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'character', 'mountain', 'man', 'Linus', 'Rawlings', 'canoeing', 'river', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'action', 'land', 'known', 'only', 'lonely', 'trappers', 'wandering', 'vastness', 'search', 'beaver', 'One', 'half', 'scenes', 'later', 'Linus', 'skids', 'bark', 'Prescott', 'campsite', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'pelt', 'stroke', '.Okay', 'was', 'bored', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'paying', 'attention', 'When', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'rousing', 'rendition', 'Raise', 'Ruckus', 'despondent', 'members', 'wagon', 'train', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'time', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'was', 'glaring', 'daggers', 'George', 'Peppard', 'kids', 'was', 'wondering', 'not', 'one', 'should', 'fill', 'little', 'hole', 'middle', 'dvd', 'when', 'make', 'coaster']",How the West Was Won

The music is hauntingly good.I just wanted to comment on all the criticism of the film to DVD transfer. Lighten up!I saw this film in a grand theater on a deeply curved Cinerama screen when it was released in the early 1960s.It was a phenomenal experience.  The young folks who complain about the vertical lines have a pointbut they are forgetting that they are looking at a short-lived, experimental technology developed in 1952!Superior anamorphic lenses and bigger format film ultimately made the 3 camera/3 projector Cineramaprocess unnecessary to capture wide screen spectacles.Widescreen TVs are 16:9 aspect ratio.Full blown 3 screen Cinerama almost 3:1.There are going to be black bars on the top and bottom of an HDTV no matter what.No, Cinerama doesn't compare to today's IMAX technology or Ultra High Def TV which most people haven't even seen yet.  But so what - there's a big story going on here in HOW THE WEST WAS WON.At least it exists in some form that we can enjoy at home - even if the technical quality of the transfer leaves something to be desired.It would cost a fortune to digitally correct it for DVD and I doubt that it could be made perfect considering the multitude of variables involved and the long length of the film.Technicalities aside, it's still a very worthwhile film and much better by far than most of what Hollywood is grinding out today.*******UPDATE FEB 2010:As of late 2008, HTWWW was reworked for DVD and the dividing lines and color variance across the 3 screens has been miraculously erased or dramatically minimized in almost every scene.

142538,A4FEX6OT16DEA,0792839072,The Keeper Of The Celluloid,"[12, 13]","If the legendary creators of Cinerama could speak from the heavens, they would surely want to praise the efforts of David Strohmaier. He has not only led the crusade to save and preserve the artform of three strip exhibition but through his determination has defined a new and better way to see what Cinerama was like for those not available to see it in all its theatrical glory.Smilebox is the creation and it is used to wonderful effect in the new DVD presentation of How The West Was Won.  Through new and complicated technology, the curved look of Cinerama can be seen on the television screen.  A Strohmaier creation, this duplicates the appromimate look and feel as if you were in a Cinerama theater, sans the curved screen.The presentation of this classic western also removes the join lines of the three strips of film, well, almost removes them.  Purists will debate their removal but if they could have been taken out from the beginning, they would have.  I believe Lowell Thomas and Cooper would approve.As wonderful as the film is, it's the documentary, Cinerama Adventure that is the real prize here.  Not since the days of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill has there been such a rich and loving look at a film genre.  Told with footage from other Cinerama films, rare behind the scenes footage, photos and with interviews from those who were there, this is the fastest ninety minute ride a film fan can have.  The early experiments of multi strip projection are fascinating.  The sequence of going through a live volcano while the plane stalls in mid air is riviting.  With music by the prolific John Morgan, the man who has reconstructed classic film scores, this is a film to be viewed again and again.Make no mistake, this is the DVD event of the year.  The transfer (all new) of How The West Was Won is fabulous.  The documentary is included as a bonus piece but, believe me, once you see it, you will want to know everything else there is to know about CInerama.

The video transfer, while beautiful with the Cinerama lines diminished, is presented as a flat stripe across the screenThe Blu-Ray edition includes a smilebox option for viewing the film.  This is where the image is curved at the edges to truly simulate a Cinerama in the theater. Those documentary excerpts in smilebox with Debbie Reynolds and Robert Preston speaking directly to the three cameras were stunning.  The train sequences when they discussed the stuntman's major accident were unbelievable.  The shot of the curtain opening over the titles with the simulated audience gave me goosebumps.  Finally, I thought, an opportunity to at least approximate the grandeur of an actual Cinerama screening.The color is superb and the 5.1 sound is magnificent.  The flat image on the DVD version that still has distorted wide images is, at the very least, disapointing.I hope I don't appear ungrateful for the efforts that went into restoring this classic western, but come on.  Where is the ""wow"" factor we were all anticipating?This is how I felt when I bought the restored version of The Harder They Come.

The battle scenes are so perfect, it almost looks like they were recently shot and added to the old footage.The movie is beautiful and the sound is very clear. Even though it's 5.1, most of the sound is from the center so it almost feels like the original mono. That's good because I almost always hate simulated 5.1 on old movies.I found the Smilebox version unique and interesting, but it was very distracting on moving/panning shots. You can see where the cameras overlap on scenes with blue skies (there are plenty of them) but it's not horribly annoying. I find myself so involved in the story that I soon forget about it.The Cinerama shooting method does cause a few optic issues: People on opposite sides of the screen don't seem to actually be looking at each other and just walking a few steps away from the camera seems to move them far into the distance. Minor exposure differences might bother you a bit (it did me), but it's no deal breaker.The letterbox format has its own issues, but these can't be helped when playing what was meant to be seen on a giant curved screen on a small flat screen.

142544,A220FJEQNGMSRN,0792839072,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 2]","How the West Was Won seems to become more of an endurance task every year. While it throws in everything - injun attacks, shooting the rapids, stampedes, train wrecks, the Civil War, wagon trains - except a good old fashioned gunfight, the characterization and linking narrative wrapped around Richard Talmadge's impressive action scenes are a long way from the best of the West. Whether it's Karl Malden, Carol Baker, Robert Preston or Gregory Peck hamming it up or Debbie Reynolds raising yet another ruckus in another painfully gratuitous musical number, the squirm factor is high. Although John Ford's Civil War section (aided by plentiful stock footage from Raintree County) is the best remembered, the film doesn't really pick up until Reynolds is sidelined out of the picture and George Marshall takes over the directorial reins for the impressive railroad section, where it really starts to confront a few of the darker aspects of the price of progress and allows George Peppard, Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda to shine. Unfortunately by then fatigue is beginning to set in, and for all the beauty of the color the transfer from three-panel Cinerama to letterboxed DVD on the original release left the film with some very jarring distortion problems that leaves much of the film looking like it's being played in a semi-circle. And the film's exultant ending that sees the magnificent scenery buried under miles of highways and skyscrapers now seems more tragedy than triumph. At the end of the day it's pure popcorn fodder, but it has its moments and Alfred Newman's score at least has the dynamism that the majority of the film lacks.As others have mentioned, the quality of the disc left quite a bit to be desired but WHV's 2008 three-disc DVD is something of a mixed blessing. Thanks to some very impressive digital restoration work the infamous lines between the three screens are almost completely invisible in all but a few shots, though there's still some distortion that comes from presenting a film intended for a curved screen in a horizontal format (not a problem for the Blu-Ray edition, which includes a `smileboxed' version not available to regular DVD buyers). While the film for the most part looks great, the extras are definitely lacking. Pride of place goes to 93-minute documentary Cinerama Adventure which covers the history of the format in depth and the making of How the West Was Won in passing - not stinting on the problems the format gave actors - but for some reason the other Cinerama `story' film, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, is all but completely ignored. While the new audio commentary on the main feature is welcome, the featurette about the making of HTWWW from the previous issue featuring copious amounts of home movie footage from the set has been dropped and only the general release trailer has been included (even though the roadshow trailer heralding Cinerama as the greatest step forward in the evolution of film is still missing, despite clips being used in Cinerama Adventure.

Now the curve is perfect.(incidentally, this is the reason Stanley Kubrick declined the 3 camera process for 2001...)The soundtrack is the most perfect I have ever heard, it's sonically brilliant save for a little clipping on a few of the heavily modulated high levels.(from the original soundtrack)The previously missing correct rear channel information is all there.The only minor critique, as one other has pointed out, is the really obvious opening scene 'ball of fluff' which was obviously on the cinerama lenses.

Rice Jr.,"[13, 13]","When high-quality, low-speed Kodachrome slide film became available many years ago, that product was a justification for photographers to invest in the best 35-mm. cameras available, such as Leica.  Kodachrome film shot with a Leica camera became a reference.The TV western classic of the late 1950's and 1960's, ""Bonanza"", with its wonderful color photography, provided many an American family with justification to invest in the emerging technology of color television.  ""Bonanza"" was the reference TV show that displayed what color televisions of the time could do.""How the West was Won"", a contemporary along with ""Bonanza"", went to great lengths to show how beautiful the American West was, using the three-camera process of Cinerama to demonstrate to the public this cutting-edge method of cinematography.  Today, Cinerama still remains the best process ever invented to film a Hollywood epic, surpassing even that of IMAX.  It is too bad that it was a cumbersome and expensive process to work with, and did not meet with the full approval of the three directors involved with the filming of HTWWW.  But what visual magnificence is evident in this film!  Thank goodness that Time-Warner went back to the original Eastman negative and developed technology to eliminate or minimize the disconcerting film joins of the three Cinerama projectors in transferring this classic to DVD and Blu-Ray.  The results of their efforts are evident, and based on the other Blu-Ray movies I have and have seen, HTWWW can justifiably be considered as a Blu-Ray reference!Other reviewers critical of the ""Smilebox"" process transferring HTWWW onto a second disc that mimics the Cinerama curved screen should give it a second view.  The reason I say this is because I've noticed that object movement on the right and left panels of the 3-camera film joins is less distorted in the Smilebox transfer than on the normal screen transfer.  Give the same scenes another look in both versions (such as the river raft sequence) and compare.Regardless of your age and film content preferences, if you are just starting into Blu-Ray, make this film one of your ""must-purchase"" items!

Directed by three directors (John Ford, Henry Hathaway and George Marshall with a fourth Richard Thorpe providing uncredited linking pieces)""How the West Was Won"" was produced during the twilight of the western as the most popular type genre.Warner has done a painstaking job of restoring this classic film and although it isn't perfect, it's an exceptional job that deserves kudos. The film has never looked this good with colors that pop and accurate fleshtones. More important the seams that one could see for the separate cameras aren't quite as glaring as before. The image quality is exceptionally crisp with terrific detail. Audio sounds extremely good with a nice 5.1 mix.The film is spread over two discs with the original Overture and Alfred Newman's marvelous score included as part of the package. We get a terrific feature length commentary track from  ""West"" stuntman Loren James who provides plenty of background details about the physical shooting of the film, filmmaker David Strohmaier, film scholar Rudy Behlmer, Cierama's John Sittig and music historian Jon Burlingame. My only complaint is that Burlingame will make a comment about listening to Newman's marvelous score and then whomever edited his comments continues to play them right over the music cue we should be listening to without interruption.The only other complaint that I have is that while the dirt and grit has been removed making the film look marvelous, there's one sequence that has always bugged me--there is a bit of dirt right in the middle of the frame of the opening fly over sequence that I wish they could have figured out how to remove. Other than that, it's pretty smooth looking throughout the presentation despite an occasiona bit of image unsteadiness as characters move across the screen and span of the three cameras lenses.We also get a terrific hour and a half documentary on the Cinerama process on the third disc.There are three different versions of the film in re-release: the first is a three disc DVD edition with just the film; the second is the three disc set postcards, a reproduction of the original press book, souvenir book and photos as part of the package;there is no equivalent for this SCE in the Blu-ray edition although it does have a booklet as part of that package.The image and sound quality in this restored edition improves on the original single disc edition of the film with a terrific commentary track and documentary to round out the set.

142554,ARFCORBCTKX1J,0792839072,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[8, 13]","Before getting to the review proper... The Blu-ray of this film, made from the camera negatives, with the three panels (almost) seamlessly spliced together, is nothing short of jaw-dropping. It simply looks better -- far better -- than it does in the theater. (Ignoring, of course, the impact of a huge image on a huge screen.) The included Smilebox version makes better use of the screen's area, and presents the film in a way that is subjectively more like Cinerama presentation -- it better stimulates one's peripheral vision. It's highly recommended.In a remarkable coincidence, the same day I saw ""How the West was Won"" at the Seattle Cinerama (03/01/03), the History Channel aired a program on the history of the wheel. One of the talking-head experts opined that the wheel's invention marked a fundamental change in human thought -- not only was there a technological solution to every problem, but nature could be bent to human will, forced to reveal her secrets and serve us.This is the theme of ""How the West was Won."" It starts with the title, and extends to nearly everything in the film. The narration tells us that the land had to be wrested from nature and from the ""primitive people"" who inhabited (and by implication, infested) it. The chorus is continually singing about how ""we're headed for the promised land"" and those who are willing to work hard will be richly rewarded (except the Chinese railroad laborers, of course). We were justified in overrunning the continent because we are actually ""doing something"" with it -- as opposed to the Indians, who merely lived there in harmony with nature. Not having invented the wheel, they saw no further possibilities.James Webb's script &lt;does> acknowledge the culture clash between the Americans and the native peoples, recognizing that the latter will have to eventually change or be destroyed. But this is peripheral to the celebration of the industry, hard work, and sacrifice of the Americans, who ""tamed"" the wilderness. The film ends with a nausea-inducing flyover of the California freeways (I sat next to a guy who'd taken Dramamine in anticipation of such scenes), followed by a flight under the Golden Gate bridge, firmly and unambiguously driving the point home.""How the West was Won"" is social propaganda, plain and simple. It's the kind of film that could change Osama Bin Laden's mind about destroying the US. (Maybe the State Department could arrange a screening...)As a movie, there's no denying ""How the West was Won"" is wildly entertaining. Simply as cinematic spectacle, it works magnificently. There are films (such as ""2001"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"") that even the finest video transfer cannot do justice to, and this is one of them. Sitting in the first few rows, you're so close to the screen that you can't take in all of it at once. When the camera tracks into a scene, the sense of physical motion is uncanny. (Can you say ""stimulation of peripheral vision""? Sure you can.) And if you haven't seen a buffalo stampede, or a train crash, or a row of cannons firing in sequence on a (roughly) 30' by 90' screen -- well, you haven't lived, cinematically-wise.Story-wise, there's so much material to cover the script cannot begin to do it justice, even in a film lasting 2 hours. Characters are more types than individuals, and almost every performer is cast to type. (Eli Wallach, in particular, gets to do his ""crazy Mexican outlaw"" shtick, though without an accent.) It's only the efficiency and focus of the script that keeps the actors from looking altogether foolish. Other than (perhaps) Karl Malden, no one gives what would be considered a ""real"" performance.The plot (which follows the Prescott family and its descendents over 50 years) is concocted to make Debbie Reynolds' character the sort of farm girl who wants to run off to the big city to become rich, so we're treated to several (mercifully brief) song-and-dance numbers. Her sister is played by Carol Baker, who falls head over heels in love with Jimmy Stewart's ""aw-shucks"" mountain man, and later ""tames"" him (as the film's conceit requires). The rest of the film rehashes just about every clich&eacute; of westerns and Civil War movies -- though entertainingly. The final sequence posits the ""conquest"" of the West as occurring when ""the law"" (in the form of George Peppard's marshal) arrives, to establish justice. But Peppard -- who says he wants to bring the bad'un to justice in court -- shoots him to death, anyway.My five-star rating acknowledges this is a classic film -- not necessarily a great one.I can't pass up the opportunity to trash Pauline Kael, who was not so much a hard-nosed-but-movie-loving critic as she was an empty-headed, loudmouthed [female canine]. Note how she uses the artistic limitations of a single sentence to craft a thoughtful, insightful commentary that will help the reader better understand this film...""'How the West Was Lost' would be a more appropriate title for this dud epic, since, as conceived by the writer, James R. Webb, the pioneers seem to be dimwitted bunglers who can't do anything right.""Hello? Were we watching the same movie? ""How the West was Won"" might be politically incorrect, dramatically shallow, and little more than agit-prop -- but it's no dud. The Seattle audience -- which included many people sporting ""No Iraq War"" buttons -- just ate it up. ""How the West was Won"" is Hollywood middlebrow-populist entertainment at its best.One final question...
