1027827,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000JLQQ7Q,Brian E. Erland,"[9, 9]","Synopsis: What happens when a beautiful American girl on vacation in Mexico awakens one morning with no recollection of what happened the night before? This may not be such a big deal unless that girl happens to wake up and herself married to a handsome, naked Mexican male laying beside her. Quite a intolerable predicament when you consider that it's just twenty-four hours before she is scheduled to marry another man!So the tale begins of bewildered and hung over Melissa (Laura Prepon from the `That 70's Show') and the good looking Mexican local Carlos (Matt Cedeno from the `El Pollo Loco' commercial) begin their madcap adventure to discover what happened the night before and what they intend to do about it.Critique: This is one of those made-for-television movies predicated on the belief that matching two young, attractive and popular personalities in a light, romantic comedy is always a good thing. Well, they got it half right. Matt Cedeno is quite charming and likeable, but conversely Laura Prepon tends to be somewhat boorish as she continually rants and raves about how this unexpected situation may ruin her otherwise perfectly planned life. This film is definitely not for someone looking for a little sustenance in their evening entertainment. But, if you're a teenage girl stuck home for the night Matt Cedeno just might fit the bill.",3,"""A Mythic Drink, A Forgotten Night"" ~ 'That 70's Show' Meets 'El Pollo Loco'",1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,1358,"['Synopsis', 'What', 'when', 'beautiful', 'American', 'girl', 'vacation', 'Mexico', 'one', 'morning', 'recollection', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'girl', 'wake', 'up', 'married', 'handsome', 'naked', 'Mexican', 'male', 'laying', 'intolerable', 'predicament', 'when', 'consider', 'just', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'scheduled', 'marry', 'man', 'tale', 'bewildered', 'hung', 'Melissa', 'Laura', 'Prepon', '70', 'Show', 'good', 'looking', 'Mexican', 'local', 'Carlos', 'Matt', 'Cedeno', 'El', 'Pollo', 'Loco', 'commercial', 'begin', 'madcap', 'adventure', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'what', 'intend', 'do', 'it.Critique', 'one', 'made-for-television', 'movies', 'predicated', 'belief', 'matching', 'two', 'young', 'attractive', 'popular', 'personalities', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'Well', 'got', 'half', 'right', 'Matt', 'Cedeno', 'quite', 'charming', 'likeable', 'conversely', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'be', 'somewhat', 'boorish', 'rants', 'raves', 'how', 'unexpected', 'situation', 'may', 'ruin', 'otherwise', 'perfectly', 'planned', 'life', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'someone', 'looking', 'little', 'sustenance', 'evening', 'entertainment', ""'re"", 'teenage', 'girl', 'stuck', 'home', 'night', 'Matt', 'Cedeno', 'just', 'might', 'fit', 'bill']",Romancing the Bride

How does a bride to be wake up with a man in her bed who claims to be her husband on the day before her ""real"" wedding?

As she scurries to return to her hotel and clear up the mishap and get annulled so she can marry longtime fiance Brian, every thing that can go wrong, does. From being chased by the police to accidentally burning down the records hall, Carlos insists that he won't let her annul their union until she realizes why she eloped with him in the first place.
