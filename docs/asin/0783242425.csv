71507,A1JJ2MHN7S4QQH,0783242425,John V,"[2, 2]","I remember seeing these two movies on Cartoon Network at one point as a kid. These two movies are fantastic (and that's saying a lot for two direct-to-video films). Of course, I'd take this over the live-action films any day.-I thought ""Alvin & the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein"" was a great movie. As usual, the beginning shows Alvin acting like a spoiled brat and treating his brothers like dirt go figure (that's noticed during the Dragonland scene). However, I loved the fact that they change Frankenstein (or ""Frankie"" as Theodore calls him) from a monster to this lovable guy. It teaches us that you can't always judge a book by it's cover. And also, I loved the songs in the film, the animation was great. I also liked that instead of being a spoiled brat, Alvin had a change of heart after Theodore found Frankie.-""Alvin & the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman"" was just as good. It even stars the Chipettes as well. This is when Alvin brings his monster-obsession to the test when Theodore turns into a werewolf. Also, I liked how Alvin actually cares about his brother and helps Simon out with research and other stuff to help change Theodore back to his normal self. And, once again, I loved the songs.-Now the reason why I keep bringing up Alvin being a spoiled brat is because of another animated Chipmunks film I've seen called ""The Chipmunk Adventure."" It shows how much of an egotistical, greedy, selfish brat he can be, when he disobeys his elders, treats his brothers like dirt, and listens to these two strangers who let him take off on a hot-air balloon to race around the world, just to get $100,000.These two films completely change Alvin's personality (in a good way).

71510,A3N48NHTSIIJ1,0783242425,Mark Ebert,"[8, 9]","This DVD contains two movie-length ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" monster adventures.  The first, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein"".  Originally released in 1999 this is a wonderful animated film that will delight adult fans who grew up with the chipmunks (there's even a roller-coaster scene that shows the Chipmunks as they appeared in the 1950's and 1960's) and will also be fast-paced and contemporary enough for twenty-first century kids.  Parents need not worry about language, there is cartoon violence, and some scenes may be too scary for very young children (especially the opening sequence in black and white).  On the upside there are nice lessons about friendship and not judging by the cover.  I give this one five stars.The second monster mash, entitled ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman"", features three lively songs, but the story doesn't move quiet as well and the appeal for an older audience isn't as strong as the first feature.  Nevertheless, parents and adult fans will be able to make it through without resenting it.  This one is probably a bit more scary for young children and even elementary school kids may need to rehear ""there's no such things as monsters"" after viewing.  This one gets three stars.As for the DVD itself, there are no bonus features, but the upside is there are no previews, which means kids won't be begging for other titles.  The picture and sound are excellent.On a personal note, I grew up watching ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" in the 1980's and enjoyed the 2007 motion picture, but had never viewed these features until recently.  I find that they compared well to the mid-1980's series and are something of a bridge between that show and the live-action movie.",4,A Fun Halloween Treat,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,1724,"['DVD', 'two', 'movie-length', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'monster', 'adventures', 'first', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'Meet', 'Frankenstein', 'Originally', 'released', '1999', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'film', 'will', 'delight', 'adult', 'fans', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'chipmunks', 'even', 'roller-coaster', 'scene', 'Chipmunks', 'appeared', '1950', '1960', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'contemporary', 'enough', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'kids', 'Parents', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'language', 'cartoon', 'violence', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'especially', 'opening', 'sequence', 'black', 'white', 'upside', 'are', 'nice', 'lessons', 'friendship', 'not', 'judging', 'cover', 'give', 'one', 'five', 'stars.The', 'second', 'monster', 'mash', 'entitled', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'Meet', 'Wolfman', 'three', 'lively', 'songs', 'story', ""n't"", 'move', 'quiet', 'as', 'well', 'appeal', 'older', 'audience', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'feature', 'Nevertheless', 'parents', 'adult', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'resenting', 'one', 'probably', 'bit', 'more', 'scary', 'young', 'children', 'even', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'may', 'need', 'rehear', 'such', 'things', 'monsters', 'viewing', 'one', 'three', 'stars.As', 'DVD', 'are', 'bonus', 'upside', 'are', 'previews', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'begging', 'other', 'titles', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'personal', 'note', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', '1980', 'enjoyed', '2007', 'motion', 'picture', 'had', 'never', 'viewed', 'features', 'recently', 'find', 'compared', 'well', 'mid-1980', 'series', 'are', 'something', 'bridge', 'show', 'live-action', 'movie']",N/A

71512,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0783242425,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","In the year 2000, Alvin and the Chipmunks premiered their latest film to date, the direct-to-video animated feature ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman,"" and, for Chipmunk fans all over, it was a long overdue treat!In the film, we catch up with our favorite 80's pop star, Alvin Seville, in the middle of a run for his life. His pursuer? None other than the legendary Universal Studios horror icon, the Wolfman! Though he actually looks nothing like the Universal Studios Wolfman (a particular fave of mine), he still looks pretty cool and plenty ferocious. We eventually come to find that this black and white chase was all a dream, and Alvin is, in fact, suffering from such nightmares on a repeat basis thanks to his obsession with watching horror movies late at night. It's a problem that none of his family is very happy about, especially the boys' adoptive father, Dave.When Alvin's problem worsens, a problem he blames on the Sevilles' new neighbor, a suspicious Mr. Lawrence Talbot, Dave decides to take action. Alvin is put on a monster-free diet, including having to give up the starring role in his school theatrical production of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" To little brother Theodore's dismay, Principal Milliken insists Drama teacher Mr. Rochelle give the lead role to him in an effort to build the boy's confidence. Theodore has been taking far too much guff from school bully Nathan lately, and everyone has been noticing.As Alvin laments the loss of his Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde role AND his monster hobby, Theodore takes small comfort in knowing that brother Simon will be taking over the harder end of the character. As Simon plays Dr. Jekyll, Theodore will play Mr. Hyde. Now, Theodore just needs to learn how to be ""evil."" Dave encourages him to think the way Nathan does, which sets Theodore on the right track and fills him with confidence; enough confidence to run over to Chipette Eleanor's house and present her with a gift for helping him learn his lines. Meanwhile, Alvin, who has become convinced that next-door neighbor Mr. Talbot is actually a werewolf, breaks his monster fast and cracks open his ""Monster Book of Monster Facts"" that just arrived in the mail from the Madame Raya late-night monster movie show! With this new weapon in his arsenal, Alvin sets forth to prove his case against Mr. Talbot and teams with his brother Simon, who is on a mission to disprove Alvin. Simon's disbelief in werewolves won't last long, however, when the boys learn that Theodore was bitten by one on his way back from the Chipettes' house the night he gave Eleanor her gift! Not only do they still have Mr. Talbot to deal with, but now they have a werewolf little brother too!Released on vhs in 2000 from Universal, and now available on DVD as well in a DVD ""Monster Pack"" that also includes several other monster `toons (perfect for the Halloween season), ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman"" is excellent monster fun for the whole family, especially those of us who grew up with Chipmunk adventures every Saturday morning in the 80s! Despite being direct-to-video, the animation quality of this film is excellent throughout, above that of the animated series, even if not quite at the level of their theatrical feature. In fact, aside from the theatrical ""Chipmunk Adventure"" feature film, this is Alvin and the gang's best work yet! There was no slacking off in the writing department, with a thorough and involved plotline and plenty of Chipmunk-style humor throughout that should work for any age group. Plus, it's got the Chipettes! Who doesn't love them? The regulars' voices haven't changed a bit, nor have their personalities, hilarious new characters are voiced by some of the best actors in the business, the three new songs performed in the film are original and wonderful, and the whole experience is just fun, fun, fun! If you haven't seen this one yet, I definitely recommend you go out and pick it up today!

This is a double feature, and to me, their squeaky high pitched voices can slowly become like listening to fingers across a blackboard.The Frankenstein feature starts out quite good with the trio engulfed inside a theme park tour with them as a park headliner. For some reason, this feature loses steam, as well as humor. A lot of action, a lot of noise, a lot of growling from Frankie, but very low on cartoon humor, for some reason, which tends to make it drag.The Werewolf feature is more in keeping with a solid feature for this chipmunk trio as Talbot is featured as a real menace rather than the Frankie dolt.

It is well-worth it with two Halloween features that are engaging and fun to watch. Each movie is about 75 mins long (approximately). In the first feature, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein"", the trio are performing at a theme park and Alvin decides he absolutely has to go on the Dragonland ride. All three chipmunks soon find themselves not only lost but locked in the theme park after closing. They make their way to Frankenstein's castle, unaware that the evil Dr. Frankenstein has taken up residence and is attempting to revive his monster! It is spooky enough to delight young fans without being scary.In the second feature, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman"", Alvin has a monster ban imposed on him since he is not only scaring himself silly, but terrifying poor Theodore as well. The three get cast in a school production of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, where the Chippettes also get roles, and shy Theodore is given a part as Dr. Hyde to boost his self-esteem. Well, Theodore gets a boost of a different kind when he is bitten by a werewolf! Soon, Alvin and Simon must race against time to restore Theodore back to his usual self before it is too late!The two productions have some cute songs that have become a trademark of the shows. I personally loved this cartoon as it reminded me of the older show back in the 80s.
