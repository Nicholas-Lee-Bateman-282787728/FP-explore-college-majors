1607830,ANJJDIL1N8HP4,B00AEF8BC0,AG,"[18, 21]","I liked this DVD. It was like a mix between Jillian Michaels Fastfix and Bill Banks Tae Bo. It was nonstop movement and definitely tires you out. If I had to order the three DVDs from most liked to least liked it would be: Jillian Michaels, Jeanette Jenkins, then Billy Banks. Jillian Michaels teaches you particular kickboxing movements and does combinations which I like. She also has a bigger variety of kicks and punches. Hers is more realistic boxing. Jeanette Jenkins DVD is more about getting you to sweat which she does successfully. I just wish it had a little bit more variety when it came to the kickboxing portion and was a more realistic kickboxing. I still think this is an excellent DVD and would suggest it to anybody that wants to work up a sweat.",4,pretty good,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,764,"['liked', 'DVD', 'was', 'mix', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Fastfix', 'Bill', 'Banks', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'was', 'nonstop', 'movement', 'definitely', 'tires', 'out', 'had', 'order', 'three', 'DVDs', 'most', 'liked', 'least', 'liked', 'would', 'be', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'then', 'Billy', 'Banks', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'teaches', 'particular', 'kickboxing', 'movements', 'combinations', 'like', 'also', 'bigger', 'variety', 'kicks', 'punches', 'Hers', 'more', 'realistic', 'boxing', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'DVD', 'more', 'getting', 'sweat', 'successfully', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'variety', 'when', 'came', 'kickboxing', 'portion', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'kickboxing', 'still', 'think', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'would', 'suggest', 'anybody', 'work', 'up', 'sweat']",Jeanette Jenkins/ The Hollywood Trainer: Cardio Kickboxing

I mostly utilize group exercise classes at my local YMCA but I wanted some options for working out at home.  I tried it for the first time today.  Holy Cow!  It didn't make it through the whole 90 minutes.  I originally thought it was only a 50 minute dvd and didn't realize it was 90 minutes until about 5 minutes before I was supposed to start.  That's ok because I skipped the last 2 segments which made it 50 minutes.I like how you can pick what you're going to do to change up your workout.  You can do the whole 90 minutes or you can skip to segments that you want to do.  It's very easy to change it up within this one DVD.  Which is awesome if you get bored with the same thing over and over again.Keep in mind this is NOT a dvd for beginners.  I have been working out consistently for years now and I have lost 100lbs over the past few years and I would consider myself an intermediate exerciser.  This DVD is very challenging, you are constantly moving and working up a sweat!Jeanette is very motivating and encouraging.  She provides constant instruction throughout the workout which is good because she reminds you to maintain proper form so you don't hurt yourself.I really liked this dvd and I'm getting ready to see what other dvds she has available!",5,Hardcore workout!,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1354,"['DVD', 'hardcore', 'heard', 'alot', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'wanted', 'give', 'try', 'mostly', 'utilize', 'group', 'exercise', 'local', 'YMCA', 'wanted', 'options', 'working', 'out', 'home', 'tried', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'Holy', 'Cow', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', '90', 'minutes', 'originally', 'thought', 'was', 'only', '50', 'minute', 'dvd', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', '90', 'minutes', '5', 'minutes', 'was', 'supposed', 'start', 'ok', 'skipped', 'last', '2', 'segments', 'made', '50', 'minutes.I', 'how', 'can', 'pick', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'change', 'up', 'workout', 'can', 'do', 'whole', '90', 'minutes', 'can', 'skip', 'segments', 'want', 'do', 'very', 'easy', 'change', 'up', 'one', 'DVD', 'Which', 'awesome', 'get', 'bored', 'same', 'thing', 'again.Keep', 'mind', 'NOT', 'dvd', 'beginners', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'consistently', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'lost', '100lbs', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'would', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'DVD', 'very', 'challenging', 'are', 'constantly', 'moving', 'working', 'up', 'sweat', 'Jeanette', 'very', 'motivating', 'encouraging', 'constant', 'instruction', 'workout', 'good', 'maintain', 'proper', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'yourself.I', 'really', 'liked', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ready', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'dvds', 'available']",Jeanette Jenkins/ The Hollywood Trainer: Cardio Kickboxing

I'm a 55 year old female and consider myself an intermediate exerciser.  This workout gives you a great total body workout.  Jeannette combines cardio, weights, and toning.  The workout is fun, challenging and never boring.  I have to be careful not to harm my knees and the exercises were easy to modify to prevent any injury. I enjoy kickboxing and tae bo and this will definitely go into my weekly rotation.

I like that the majority of her moves are not too complicated. There are a few in there that I could not do due to my lack of coordination but I could follow about 98% of the moves.  I like a few things about this video: 1) that you can listen w or w/o music 2) that you can watch it all the way through or pick segments to do. I like the segment option for days I have less than 90 minutes to work out.This is a great addition to Jillian Micheals, Jackier Warner and Barre workout routines. I really feel that by adding this to my rotation of about 9 videos (from various trainers) I have a good range of options and variety to have great workouts w/o gym costs.
