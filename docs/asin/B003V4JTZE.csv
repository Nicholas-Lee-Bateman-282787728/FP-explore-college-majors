1366704,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B003V4JTZE,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","Another one of those goofy Bob Hope and Hedy Lamarr comedies that never make much sense but don't really have to. This time, Bob Hope plays Peanuts White, a burlesque comedian who looks exactly like international spy and crook, Eric Augustine. Augustine was known to be heading for Tangier to pick up what the movie calls microfilm. It's actually just a very small roll of film, as from a secret camera, not the little black dots that we know from later technology.Anyway, Augustine was injured in a shoot-out with the FBI, and Peanuts is recruited by President Truman himself to impersonate Augustine and go to Tangier with a million dollars in a money belt to buy the film, which is of some critical importance to the government.Hedy Lamarr plays Lily, a spy and crook Augustine had worked with and betrayed before, in Cairo, Paris and etc. Of course, Peanuts does not know the things Lily assumes he knows, such as her favorite drink and ""their song.""There's a good bit of slapstick humor, there are lots of bad guys that all seem to want to kill each other as well as Augustine and/or Peanuts, and a thoroughly outrageous ending. A lot of fun, especially if you don't let Bob Hope's famous quick lines get past you.",4,A Classic of Bob Hope Humor,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1219,"['one', 'goofy', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'comedies', 'never', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'time', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Peanuts', 'White', 'burlesque', 'comedian', 'who', 'exactly', 'like', 'international', 'spy', 'crook', 'Eric', 'Augustine', 'Augustine', 'was', 'known', 'be', 'heading', 'Tangier', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'movie', 'microfilm', 'actually', 'just', 'very', 'small', 'roll', 'film', 'secret', 'camera', 'not', 'little', 'black', 'dots', 'know', 'later', 'technology.Anyway', 'Augustine', 'was', 'injured', 'shoot-out', 'FBI', 'Peanuts', 'recruited', 'President', 'Truman', 'impersonate', 'Augustine', 'go', 'Tangier', 'million', 'dollars', 'money', 'belt', 'buy', 'film', 'critical', 'importance', 'government.Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'Lily', 'spy', 'crook', 'Augustine', 'had', 'worked', 'betrayed', 'Cairo', 'Paris', 'etc', 'course', 'Peanuts', 'not', 'know', 'things', 'Lily', 'such', 'favorite', 'drink', 'song', 'good', 'bit', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'are', 'lots', 'bad', 'guys', 'seem', 'want', 'kill', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'Augustine', 'and/or', 'Peanuts', 'thoroughly', 'outrageous', 'ending', 'lot', 'fun', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'famous', 'quick', 'lines', 'get']",N/A

It's among Bob Hope's best, brimming with Hope's trademark wisecracks about cowardism & his supposed prowess with women, all set against an atmospheric backdrop of menace (in this case, spy business) which served Hope well. Gorgeous brunette Hedy Lamarr is his leading lady here; but of course, it's really Hope's movie all the way.This is one of those rarely seen comic gems which vanished from the movie landscape years ago.

Having no idea just how far below the average Joe their would be hero is they send him off to Tangiers to do battle with the likes of Hedy Lamarr (the bane of Harvey Korman in Blazing Saddles) and one of the screens sexiest sirens.
