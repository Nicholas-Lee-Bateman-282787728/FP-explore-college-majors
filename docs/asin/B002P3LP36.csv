I was informed by their marketing dept that the release of season 3 is slated for November 2011 !!!!!!!!!! Why the long dely I asked? Their response was that ""I don't quite really know""? This TV series finished airing several years ago in Australia and even 'Pay for TV' has also has run it several times (all seasons) and no longer air any of the show's. I for one cannot understand why Warners are so reticent in making this show more readily available, it staggers belief as there is such an enormous following world wide for it as it is one of the few absolutly excellent TV series that transcends all cultures, genders and groups of interest. No matter your age (except those of more tender years), many of us have grown up enjoying the gripping story lines, excellent acting and very realistic scenes that the shows were shot at. Third Watch is one of those few shows that when watching it, it feels as if you, the watcher, could just step right into the TV and become a part of the show itself. Many times I was left awed and stunned at what transpired in a show, several times emotional enough to even shed a tear, and I am 48 year old male not usually prone to such expressions of emotions. There is little available on TV or movies of this calibre, so to the DVD many of us must go - please Warners, please, Please, PLEASE release all the remaining seasons forthwith and season 3 A.S.A.P.  Can I suggest a world wide demonstration of all interested Third Watch 'addicts' and we all contact Warner Brothers simultaneously requesting for them to get their collective 'acts' together and supply the consumer with a product that we all quite clearly desire and dare I even say it - DEMAND ????",5,Too Long The Wait !!!!!!!!,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,1840,"['have', 'contacted', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'when', 'third', '3rd', 'season', 'awesome', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'contacted', 'August', '2010', 'was', 'informed', 'marketing', 'dept', 'release', 'season', '3', 'slated', 'November', '2011', 'Why', 'long', 'dely', 'asked', 'response', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'really', 'know', 'TV', 'series', 'finished', 'airing', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Australia', 'even', ""'Pay"", 'TV', 'also', 'run', 'several', 'times', 'seasons', 'longer', 'show', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'Warners', 'are', 'so', 'reticent', 'making', 'show', 'more', 'readily', 'available', 'belief', 'such', 'enormous', 'following', 'world', 'wide', 'one', 'few', 'absolutly', 'excellent', 'TV', 'series', 'cultures', 'genders', 'groups', 'interest', 'No', 'matter', 'age', 'more', 'tender', 'years', 'many', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'enjoying', 'gripping', 'story', 'lines', 'excellent', 'acting', 'very', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'shows', 'were', 'shot', 'Third', 'Watch', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'when', 'watching', 'watcher', 'could', 'just', 'step', 'right', 'TV', 'become', 'part', 'show', 'Many', 'times', 'was', 'left', 'awed', 'stunned', 'what', 'transpired', 'show', 'several', 'times', 'emotional', 'enough', 'even', 'shed', 'tear', 'am', '48', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'not', 'usually', 'prone', 'such', 'expressions', 'emotions', 'little', 'available', 'TV', 'movies', 'calibre', 'so', 'DVD', 'many', 'must', 'go', 'please', 'Warners', 'please', 'Please', 'PLEASE', 'release', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'forthwith', 'season', '3', 'A.S.A.P', 'Can', 'suggest', 'world', 'wide', 'demonstration', 'interested', 'Third', 'Watch', 'contact', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'simultaneously', 'requesting', 'get', 'collective', ""'acts"", 'together', 'supply', 'consumer', 'product', 'quite', 'clearly', 'desire', 'dare', 'even', 'say', 'DEMAND']",Third Watch: Season 3

I've been waiting forever for the rest of the seasons but nothing is happening. You can get dvds for all of the seasons of shows...some seasons are released right after the season finales, some released after the show is cancelled, and even dvds have been released for TV shows that haven't been on in years. I can go to the store right now and get all of the seasons for I Love Lucy, Three's Company, etc. but can't get all of the seasons for Third Watch and not to mention that it went off the air in the mid 2000's, but shows that went off the air back in the 70's, 80's and 90's are easy to find!!I mean by the time the 3rd season of Third Watch is released I'm going to want to go back and look at Seasons 1 & 2 first!! I wonder if we can contact NBC since they were the channel that ran Third Watch through all of the seasons and see if someone there knows or at least have an idea of when the other seasons will be released!! This RIDICULOUS!!Oh and for those of you who have never seen Third Watch...trust me..it was one of the BEST police, crime, drama shows on TV!! It was really popular and that's why so many people (including myself) are upset that we're waiting so long for seasons 3-6 to be released!!",5,Seriously...THIS IS FREAKIN' CRAZY!!,1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,1276,"['have', 'been', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'got', 'Season', '2', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'forever', 'rest', 'seasons', 'nothing', 'happening', 'can', 'get', 'dvds', 'seasons', 'shows', 'seasons', 'are', 'released', 'right', 'season', 'finales', 'released', 'show', 'cancelled', 'even', 'dvds', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'years', 'can', 'go', 'store', 'right', 'now', 'get', 'seasons', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Three', 'Company', 'etc', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'seasons', 'Third', 'Watch', 'not', 'mention', 'went', 'air', 'mid', '2000', 'went', 'air', 'back', '70', '80', '90', 'are', 'easy', 'find', 'mean', 'time', '3rd', 'season', 'Third', 'Watch', 'released', ""'m"", 'going', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'first', 'wonder', 'can', 'contact', 'NBC', 'were', 'channel', 'ran', 'Third', 'Watch', 'seasons', 'see', 'someone', 'least', 'have', 'idea', 'when', 'other', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'RIDICULOUS', 'Oh', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Third', 'Watch', 'trust', 'me..it', 'was', 'one', 'BEST', 'police', 'crime', 'drama', 'shows', 'TV', 'was', 'really', 'popular', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'are', 'upset', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'seasons', '3-6', 'be', 'released']",Third Watch: Season 3

Since it's last run, I've missed watching it on television amd really wish they'd put all the seasons out on dvd.

It deserves to be on DVD. If anyone has any ideas, anything we could try please share, I'm up for anything. Petitions, a kickstarter campaign, befriending a billionaire getting them into the series and then having them pay off the copyrighted stuff, there has to be SOMETHING we can do.Third Watch is one of the greatest shows ever. The rest of the series being held back from DVD release is a great injustice to everyone involved. How do these awful reality shows and one season wonders get DVD releases yet a wonderful, completed show isn't being shown the same care? Change/delete the music, we don't care! This isn't Glee, it's not going to mess up anything if you replace now expensive songs with something else.We have to keep letting them know we want these DVDs, we can't give up. And please Warner Bros, don't release one season and then wait several years to do the rest.
