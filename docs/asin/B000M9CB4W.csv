1044348,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000M9CB4W,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Surprisingly, Let's Go to Prison contains a ton of humor.  While it's basically funny in a really silly and often times mindless kind of way, I don't really mind.  Dax Shepard goes in and out of prison frequently, and he's been doing this since his teenage years for a variety of crimes.  He just can't stay out of trouble.. or maybe trouble finds him!  When Will Arnett gets into trouble for a ""crime"" involving an asthma inhaler (you'll understand why I put ""crime"" in parenthesis when you watch the movie) he too is sent to jail and becomes ""buddies"" with Dax Shepard.Little does Will know that his very own father is actually responsible for PUTTING Dax in jail, and Dax makes it his own personal mission to torment Will's character as much as he can since the two share the same jail cell.  Odd how Dax *wants* to go to jail to torment Will, but I guess for movie storyline purposes we need something far-fetched like that to occur.  Hilarious how Dax is considered the cool one in jail (because he's been in and out of jail so many times everyone knows who he is and what kind of cigarettes and illegal things he can do for the prisoners perhaps).  Sometimes I think HE would have fit the role better as the one getting tortured!  But I suppose Will is slightly better in the torture role.Of course the majority of the laughs come in the fact that Will Arnett is not cut out for prison.  He's too weak-minded, scrawny, and doesn't understand how the thugs and criminals function so of course he gets pushed around all the time.  The part where he rats someone out for starting a fight is a big ""Uh oh!"" moment for sure.  Meanwhile Dax is loving it!  Chi McBride from Boston Public provides a good portion of the laughs with his ""cuddly little ducky"" and his admiration and affection for Will Arnett's body.  Watch out in the shower room Will, haha.  Also the situations where Will gets involved with the tough guys and the killers provides even funnier laughs.  Those forks jammed into Will's legs has to hurt!The ending is pretty good too.  It's somewhat of a surprise since I had no idea how THIS crazy ordeal was going to wrap up.  Turns out Chi McBride plays an equally important role without spoiling what happens.Overall well it's probably more on the immature side of the comedy spectrum... okay it most certainly IS immature!  But it's written in a way that's really fun and keeps your attention so I absolutely recommend it.  What has Will Arnett done that HASN'T been good?  Everything he touches, especially Arrested Development, is just fantastic it seems!",5,let's not go to prison,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2574,"['Surprisingly', 'Let', 'Go', 'Prison', 'ton', 'humor', 'basically', 'funny', 'really', 'silly', 'often', 'times', 'mindless', 'kind', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'prison', 'frequently', 'been', 'doing', 'teenage', 'years', 'variety', 'crimes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'trouble..', 'maybe', 'trouble', 'When', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'trouble', 'crime', 'involving', 'asthma', 'inhaler', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'put', 'crime', 'parenthesis', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'too', 'sent', 'jail', 'buddies', 'Dax', 'Shepard.Little', 'Will', 'know', 'very', 'own', 'father', 'actually', 'responsible', 'PUTTING', 'Dax', 'jail', 'Dax', 'own', 'personal', 'mission', 'torment', 'Will', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'two', 'share', 'same', 'jail', 'cell', 'Odd', 'how', 'Dax', 'go', 'jail', 'torment', 'Will', 'guess', 'movie', 'storyline', 'need', 'something', 'far-fetched', 'occur', 'Hilarious', 'how', 'Dax', 'considered', 'cool', 'one', 'jail', 'been', 'jail', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'everyone', 'who', 'what', 'kind', 'cigarettes', 'illegal', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'prisoners', 'perhaps', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'HE', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'role', 'better', 'one', 'getting', 'tortured', 'suppose', 'Will', 'slightly', 'better', 'torture', 'course', 'majority', 'laughs', 'come', 'fact', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'not', 'cut', 'out', 'prison', 'too', 'weak-minded', 'scrawny', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'thugs', 'criminals', 'function', 'so', 'course', 'pushed', 'time', 'part', 'where', 'rats', 'someone', 'starting', 'fight', 'big', 'Uh', 'oh', 'moment', 'sure', 'Meanwhile', 'Dax', 'loving', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'Boston', 'Public', 'good', 'portion', 'laughs', 'cuddly', 'little', 'ducky', 'admiration', 'affection', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'body', 'Watch', 'out', 'shower', 'room', 'Will', 'haha', 'Also', 'situations', 'where', 'Will', 'involved', 'tough', 'guys', 'killers', 'even', 'funnier', 'laughs', 'forks', 'jammed', 'Will', 'legs', 'hurt', 'ending', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'THIS', 'ordeal', 'was', 'going', 'wrap', 'up', 'out', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'equally', 'important', 'role', 'spoiling', 'what', 'happens.Overall', 'well', 'probably', 'more', 'immature', 'side', 'comedy', 'spectrum', 'most', 'certainly', 'immature', 'written', 'way', 'really', 'fun', 'attention', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'What', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'done', 'HAS', ""N'T"", 'been', 'good', 'Everything', 'especially', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'just', 'fantastic']",N/A

But not Nelson IV or John who found themselves in Rossmore Prison at the same time.  John was an experienced repeat offender who had been in and out of correctional institutions since the age of seven.  Now, in his thirties, he has just finished his fourth session as a convict and decided it is time to take out his vengeance on the judge who put him through so much time locked up with worthless scum.He sets out for revenge against Nelson B. III, who had died just three days prior to his release.  Upon hearing this news, he shot up the phone booth.  He had to take his frustration out on something.  For years he had planned and looked forward to making the judge suffer.  Instead, fate steps in and N. B. IV takes out his grief for his dead father in a strange way and is incarcerated; and thus he becomes John's target for all of his hate.  It seemed as if fate and destiny were pre-arranged as John purposely sold some weed to undercover cops knowingly and requested Rossmore because that is where N. B. was headed.  On the bus, he conned the judge's son into thinking he will be his friend.  There are no friends among convicts.The convict mail deliverer looked like Bill Spano.  It was an unpleasant, confining ""great melting pot"" of humanity.  John, tough and experienced, helped Nelson to learn the rules and jargom of prison life.  It was clearly a culture shock for the son of a judge as his fall from grace living the good, wealthy lifestyle to the indignities of being low-man on the totem pole of heathens.His first mistake was to tell who had started a fight in the cafeteria.  John told  him that  he didn't mean for him to tell the truth when he nodded to the aggressor.  He had to learn the hard way not to tell the truth to evade it completely, and never ever trust anyone (Number 1 rule in prison).  John had connived to make Nelson dependent upon him but still he didn't try to protect him from the corruptness of imprisonment.  John, the back-stabber, gave packs of cigarettes to other prisoners as bribes to hit Nelson and to threaten him with worse than that.  There was a Barry White imitator who initiated him into the underground crudeness of men locked up together.  It was serendipity and I do hope that John and Nelson became friends when his plan for revenge backfired.How could prison be as nasty as they showed it in this movie?  How could released convicts lead a halfway normal life on the outside of the walls?  It appeared at first that I would have a private showing of this movie, but the local movie critic, a crude, raunchy obese woman took her place a couple of rows in front of me just as the feature commenced.  Vulgar, low-class Betsy Pickle ruined this movie for me with her distasteful manner and filthy verbosity, so much so that I got up and walked out.  She was out of control with her response to the obsenities and gross language and continued to act as if she were Queen of the Convicts.  Perhaps she was acting out of actual experience and not vicariously like Elsie Dykes used to do in her fantasies.",3,To Seek Revenge For Your Own Sins Never Works.,1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,3206,"['Destiny', 'havoc', 'one', 'emotions', 'when', 'find', 'bad', 'situation', 'never', 'expected', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'up', 'walk', 'out', 'not', 'Nelson', 'IV', 'John', 'who', 'found', 'Rossmore', 'Prison', 'same', 'time', 'John', 'was', 'experienced', 'repeat', 'offender', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'correctional', 'institutions', 'age', 'seven', 'Now', 'thirties', 'just', 'finished', 'fourth', 'session', 'convict', 'decided', 'time', 'take', 'out', 'vengeance', 'judge', 'who', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'locked', 'up', 'worthless', 'scum.He', 'out', 'revenge', 'Nelson', 'B.', 'III', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'just', 'three', 'days', 'prior', 'release', 'hearing', 'news', 'shot', 'up', 'phone', 'booth', 'had', 'take', 'frustration', 'out', 'something', 'years', 'had', 'planned', 'looked', 'forward', 'making', 'judge', 'suffer', 'Instead', 'fate', 'steps', 'N.', 'B.', 'IV', 'out', 'grief', 'dead', 'father', 'strange', 'way', 'incarcerated', 'thus', 'John', 'target', 'hate', 'seemed', 'fate', 'destiny', 'were', 'pre-arranged', 'John', 'purposely', 'sold', 'weed', 'undercover', 'cops', 'knowingly', 'requested', 'Rossmore', 'where', 'N.', 'B.', 'was', 'headed', 'bus', 'conned', 'judge', 'son', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'friend', 'are', 'friends', 'convicts.The', 'convict', 'mail', 'deliverer', 'looked', 'Bill', 'Spano', 'was', 'unpleasant', 'confining', 'great', 'melting', 'pot', 'humanity', 'John', 'tough', 'experienced', 'helped', 'Nelson', 'learn', 'rules', 'jargom', 'prison', 'life', 'was', 'clearly', 'culture', 'shock', 'son', 'judge', 'fall', 'grace', 'living', 'good', 'wealthy', 'lifestyle', 'indignities', 'being', 'low-man', 'totem', 'pole', 'heathens.His', 'first', 'mistake', 'was', 'tell', 'who', 'had', 'started', 'fight', 'cafeteria', 'John', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'tell', 'truth', 'when', 'nodded', 'aggressor', 'had', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'evade', 'completely', 'never', 'ever', 'trust', 'anyone', 'Number', '1', 'rule', 'prison', 'John', 'had', 'connived', 'make', 'Nelson', 'dependent', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'protect', 'corruptness', 'imprisonment', 'John', 'back-stabber', 'gave', 'packs', 'cigarettes', 'other', 'prisoners', 'bribes', 'hit', 'Nelson', 'threaten', 'worse', 'was', 'Barry', 'White', 'imitator', 'who', 'initiated', 'underground', 'crudeness', 'men', 'locked', 'up', 'together', 'was', 'serendipity', 'do', 'hope', 'John', 'Nelson', 'became', 'friends', 'when', 'plan', 'revenge', 'backfired.How', 'could', 'prison', 'be', 'as', 'nasty', 'showed', 'movie', 'How', 'could', 'released', 'convicts', 'lead', 'halfway', 'normal', 'life', 'outside', 'walls', 'appeared', 'first', 'would', 'have', 'private', 'showing', 'movie', 'local', 'movie', 'critic', 'crude', 'raunchy', 'obese', 'woman', 'took', 'place', 'couple', 'rows', 'front', 'just', 'feature', 'commenced', 'Vulgar', 'low-class', 'Betsy', 'Pickle', 'ruined', 'movie', 'distasteful', 'manner', 'filthy', 'verbosity', 'so', 'much', 'got', 'up', 'walked', 'out', 'was', 'control', 'response', 'obsenities', 'gross', 'language', 'continued', 'act', 'were', 'Queen', 'Convicts', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'acting', 'actual', 'experience', 'not', 'vicariously', 'Elsie', 'Dykes', 'used', 'do', 'fantasies']",N/A

Adapted from a novel 'You Are Going to Prison' by Jim Hogshire by screenwriters Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon and Michael Patrick Jann and directed by Bob Odenkirk, this light film seems to be a 'boys night out' venture and should be viewed with a heavy dose of good humor.John Lyshitski (a hunky and very funny Dax Shepard) has a rotten childhood, having been caught in funky 'crimes' always facing the courtroom of on Judge Biederman (David Darlow) who consistently sentences him to time in reform school then prison. After multiple terms behind bars Lyshitski seeks revenge on the judge only to discover the judge has died! BUT the judge left a cocky son as heir - Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett) - and Lyshitski stalks him and ultimately is able to get Nelson locked up in prison, and then manages to get himself locked up simultaneously to be Nelson's cellmate. The point of the caper is to put Nelson through the cruel events of prison life, but as the two live in the same cell, Lyshitski's best ideas for revenge and backfire, leaving the once terrified Nelson in the hands of a Black gang leader Barry (Chi McBride) with whom Nelson ultimately bonds and thwarts all the plans for revenge that Lyshitski penned. The ending is a funny twist of events that is good for a chuckle as well as lesson about guy bonding.The film is no great shakes of a movie, but made on an obviously low budget it does benefit from the antics of the three excellent leads and the result is a 'different kind of prison movie' that is light, silly, and entertaining.

So, he decides to get revenge on the judge's son by sending him to jail.

It's subtext and deep philosophical underpinning moves the viewer to an emotional apex.  Okay, so I'm pulling your leg.I didn't laugh much during this DVD.  Director Bob Odenkirk who won an Emmy for ""The Ben Stiller Show"" probably will not win an award for this little turkey.  Will Arnett who is currently wowing audiences as the pretentious dastardly skater Stranz Van Waldenberg who picks on Will Ferrell in ""Blades of Glory"" plays Nelson Biederman IV in this pic.  He probably won't receive any awards nominations like he did for ""Arrested Development,"" but he tries his best to transition from spoiled rich boy to white supremacist who is feared as the worst badguy on the cellblock.  Unfortunately, although he does his best, getting shampooed in the outtakes by Chi McBride, it's just not that funny.  Dax Shepard was on the ""Punk'd"" TV show and starred in ""Idiocracy"" & ""Employee of the Month.""  As John Lyshitski, he has a megawatt-size chip on his shoulder on the judge who locked him away.  Not able to avenge the deceased judge, he decides to pay back the judge's son.  Shepard looks hard-edged, like he probably should be in prison.  While he started out in improv with the Groundlings, this project just isn't funny.  Chi McBride plays Barry.  After the ""Boston Public"" TV series & parts in films like ""The Terminal,"" ""Annapolis"" & ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" he fares the best as the macho inmate who wants to curl Biederman's hair.  The candles and music set the ambiance in his cell.  But it's a sad movie where the set designer is funnier than the script.

From the exterior of the box and previews (which no one saw anyways) you'd expect this movie to be like a direct to video American Pie installment that attracts it's audience by making fun of midgets and showing boob. You'd be wrong.The movie is actually very good, and in many ways, very bold. The movie makes light of scenarios that are actually quite scary. One of the prison inmates, Leonard, is played straight by Michael Shannon. He's as sadistic and remorseless as you'd expect, he's even given a very somber and serious backstory where he kills his father with a hammer. His character probably would've fit right in on the show OZ. A truly well developed and unique character for a comedy.The two main characters played by Will Arnett and Dax Sheppard have good chemistry. Dax attempts to seek revenge on Will Arnett's character because Arnett's father in the film is responsible for Dax's many trips to prison. While the environment plays off Dax's revenge as almost college style hazing, it is very brutal. Dax pimps out Will to a rather large and deluded inmate played by Chi McBride. As Will Arnett's psyche breaks down, he and Chi McBride form a very awkward and sexual father-son relationship. The movie definitely uses the surreal nature of being imprisoned to it's benefit, and doesn't pull it's punches.The end of the movie is a bit rushed. It seems as though the writers have an excellent plan for how to develop Will's character once in prison but were unaware of how to bring him back into the 'real world'. The film would benefit immensely from a tighter ending. Aside from that it's definitely worth checking out if you can appreciate the film's twisted sense of humor.
