This is strictly a ""guy"" movie and an action movie junkies dream come true!!  Tom Doty as Cash is one mean, intimidating S.O.B. that does not play well with others.  The only time he has a sense of humor is when he's inflicting pain or about to send some poor punk to the other side!! This movie is reminiscent of the 80's action genre that I love!!

But if you're looking for a kick-ass black comedy reminiscent of the earlier work of Robert Rodriguez and Guy Ritchie, this is a must-watch.When I read other positive reviews about this movie, shot with a budget of only $50,000, I was convinced that people were paid to compare it to Tarantino's first movies.  Now, I'm a true believer in Director Sam Akina, who was in his late 20's when shooting Ca$h.I think all of us are used to being let down with low-budget movies a la Redbox.  But keep in mind that El Mariachi, the film that launched the career of Robert Rodriguez, was shot for only $7,000 back in 1992.  Ca$h has the same visual style as El Mariachi, including the well-choreographed gunplay scenes.  It also reminds me of character-driven movies like Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Mexican bosses, Vietnamese gangsters, Mafioso and Jewish wiseguys create a fun tapestry of characters.For you to enjoy this movie, leave your Oscar award expectations at the door.  Tom Doty's acting is wooden as vengeful ex-convict Cash, who looks like a real-life version of Marv from Sin City.  There are plot holes, a few bad special effects, and the production quality isn't perfect.  But the movie is simply a guilty pleasure, it's over the top on so many levels that you can't help but enjoy it.  If someone ever gives Sam Akina a serious budget and experienced actors, he's destined for big things.So if you like the earlier work of Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado), Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs) and Guy Ritchie (Lock Stock, Snatch), give this movie a shot.  For all of it's faults, it's still an entertaining movie that men will enjoy.",5,Most Fun Low-Budget Movie in Years,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,1757,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'acting', 'amazing', 'dialogue', 'movie', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'looking', 'kick-ass', 'black', 'comedy', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'work', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'must-watch.When', 'read', 'other', 'positive', 'reviews', 'movie', 'shot', 'budget', 'only', '50,000', 'was', 'convinced', 'people', 'were', 'paid', 'compare', 'Tarantino', 'first', 'movies', 'Now', ""'m"", 'true', 'believer', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Akina', 'who', 'was', 'late', '20', 'when', 'shooting', 'Ca', 'h.I', 'think', 'are', 'used', 'being', 'let', 'down', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'la', 'Redbox', 'keep', 'mind', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'film', 'launched', 'career', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'was', 'shot', 'only', '7,000', 'back', '1992', 'Ca', 'h', 'same', 'visual', 'style', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'including', 'well-choreographed', 'gunplay', 'scenes', 'also', 'character-driven', 'movies', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'Mexican', 'bosses', 'Vietnamese', 'gangsters', 'Mafioso', 'Jewish', 'wiseguys', 'create', 'fun', 'tapestry', 'characters.For', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'leave', 'Oscar', 'award', 'expectations', 'door', 'Tom', 'Doty', 'acting', 'wooden', 'vengeful', 'ex-convict', 'Cash', 'who', 'real-life', 'version', 'Marv', 'Sin', 'City', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'few', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'production', 'quality', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'movie', 'simply', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'top', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'someone', 'ever', 'Sam', 'Akina', 'serious', 'budget', 'experienced', 'actors', 'destined', 'big', 'things.So', 'like', 'earlier', 'work', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'Desperado', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Snatch', 'give', 'movie', 'shot', 'faults', 'still', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'men', 'will', 'enjoy']",Ca$h

One large muscular gangster named Cash, who was shot many times and survived, is seeking revenge against a gang leader who arranged to have him shot during a bank robbery so that he would not have to give him money, killed his girl friend, and made sure that he was arrested for the robbery. He spent ten years in jail. Now upon release, he single-mindedly goes after the gang leader without bothering to think who he hurts and kills along the way. Complicating the adventure is the fact that another gang leader tried to kill this gang leader, and the latter is seeking revenge against him and his gang. Complicating it further is the existence of three gangs: Italian, Oriental, and Spanish. When another criminal sends an unintelligent man to deliver a different box to each of the three gangs, the man mixes up the boxes. When he delivers the wrong boxes to each gang, they become enraged and decide to kill the other gangs.

There's action, blood, explosions, and stuff: the things guys love.  Still, this is nothing new and very low-quality.  Cash kills a bartender in front of a room full of people, doesn't wipe his fingerprints off the rifle and throws the rifle in the street where any cop could pick it up.  Still, he's never punished for murdering someone in broad daylight.  The movie is filled with poorly thought-out stuff like that.  Yes, the cash character has a delicious body.

Meanwhile Gonzales is in a turf war with other syndicates.Cash stops at nothing to get his revenge, killing and destroying everything in his way. The acting was typical grindhouse with the usual fun tough guy statements such as ""What are you going to do? Kill us all?"" The film includes plenty of killing, blood, and a decapitation. For those who like inane grindhouse action, this one has it. Doty has the toughness of Seagal, but the delivery of Austin. How tough?

1291466,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002VD5MQG,trebe,"[0, 0]","One man's relentless quest to get even, is the driving force in CA$H (aka Bullets, Blood, And A Fistful Of Cash) (2006), where an ex-con named Cash (Thom Doty) is looking to settle the score with Hector Gonzales (Jerry Lloyd), the man responsible for the death of his wife.  This is an extremely brutal tale of unrelenting violence, that also involves various underworld factions vying for territory.  Into this cesspool of vice comes Cash, dealing death, and crushing whoever gets in his way.Ten years ago, Cash was part of a gang robbing a bank, when he was betrayed by Pablo Valdez (Rodrigo DeMedeiros), under orders from Gonzales.  After finding his wife dead, Cash is arrested and spends the next ten years in the slammer.  Upon his release, Cash immediately begins his quest to locate Hector Gonzales, blowing away petty crooks, and snuffing the life out of Valdez.  Gonzales, once a petty crook, is now a major criminal.  Well aware of what Cash is capable of, Gonzales asks his criminal associate Abe Shanks (Phil Randoy) for help, and Shanks sends out his goon squad, as well as some crooked cops to try and kill Cash.  Due to some miscommunication, a gang war is ready to explode between Shanks, the Italian mob, and an Asian gang.  Although more people are in the picture, Cash is prepared to kill them all, in order to get to Gonzales.The minimalistic story provides just enough of a framework, for Cash to go berserk and destroy everything in his path.  The violence is stylized, without much realism, as Cash should easily be dead a dozen times over.  Thom Doty is a fearsome hulk of a man, though he isn't big on dialog, speaking most of his few lines, in a low threatening tone.  His acting skills may be limited, but in this role, they are more than adequate.  With the gangs in competition, there is plenty of collateral violence to go around.  The movie concludes with a massive shootout between the rival groups, which leaves Cash severely wounded, and barely able to move, although his mind is thinking far ahead.  With his bones broken and on the verge of death, Cash demonstrates why overconfidence can be fatal.Writer/director Sam Akina's gritty tale of violence isn't meant to be taken seriously, and certainly isn't for everyone.  With subpar acting and one dimensional characters, CA$H is mostly to be enjoyed as a satisfying tale of destruction and revenge.  While the violence is excessive, it doesn't escalate to levels beyond the context of the story, and Cash is like a big lovable shotgun wielding teddy bear.  Although grim, the finish is wet, warm, and ultimately satisfying.  Rating: 3.5 stars, for stylish brutal violence.",4,a relentless revenge fantasy that gets down to the bone ...,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,2659,"['One', 'man', 'relentless', 'quest', 'get', 'even', 'driving', 'force', 'CA', 'H', 'aka', 'Bullets', 'Blood', 'Fistful', 'Cash', '2006', 'where', 'ex-con', 'named', 'Cash', 'Thom', 'Doty', 'looking', 'settle', 'score', 'Hector', 'Gonzales', 'Jerry', 'Lloyd', 'man', 'responsible', 'death', 'wife', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'tale', 'unrelenting', 'violence', 'also', 'various', 'underworld', 'factions', 'vying', 'territory', 'cesspool', 'vice', 'Cash', 'dealing', 'death', 'crushing', 'whoever', 'way.Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Cash', 'was', 'part', 'gang', 'robbing', 'bank', 'when', 'was', 'betrayed', 'Pablo', 'Valdez', 'Rodrigo', 'DeMedeiros', 'orders', 'Gonzales', 'finding', 'wife', 'dead', 'Cash', 'arrested', 'next', 'ten', 'years', 'slammer', 'release', 'Cash', 'immediately', 'quest', 'locate', 'Hector', 'Gonzales', 'blowing', 'away', 'petty', 'crooks', 'snuffing', 'life', 'Valdez', 'Gonzales', 'once', 'petty', 'crook', 'now', 'major', 'criminal', 'Well', 'aware', 'what', 'Cash', 'capable', 'Gonzales', 'criminal', 'associate', 'Abe', 'Shanks', 'Phil', 'Randoy', 'help', 'Shanks', 'out', 'goon', 'squad', 'as', 'well', 'crooked', 'cops', 'try', 'kill', 'Cash', 'Due', 'miscommunication', 'gang', 'war', 'ready', 'explode', 'Shanks', 'Italian', 'mob', 'Asian', 'gang', 'more', 'people', 'are', 'picture', 'Cash', 'prepared', 'kill', 'order', 'get', 'Gonzales.The', 'minimalistic', 'story', 'just', 'enough', 'framework', 'Cash', 'go', 'berserk', 'destroy', 'everything', 'path', 'violence', 'stylized', 'much', 'realism', 'Cash', 'should', 'easily', 'be', 'dead', 'dozen', 'times', 'Thom', 'Doty', 'fearsome', 'hulk', 'man', ""n't"", 'big', 'dialog', 'speaking', 'most', 'few', 'lines', 'low', 'threatening', 'tone', 'acting', 'skills', 'may', 'be', 'limited', 'role', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', 'gangs', 'competition', 'plenty', 'collateral', 'violence', 'go', 'around', 'movie', 'massive', 'shootout', 'rival', 'groups', 'Cash', 'severely', 'wounded', 'barely', 'able', 'move', 'mind', 'thinking', 'far', 'ahead', 'bones', 'broken', 'verge', 'death', 'Cash', 'why', 'overconfidence', 'can', 'be', 'fatal.Writer/director', 'Sam', 'Akina', 'gritty', 'tale', 'violence', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'subpar', 'acting', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'CA', 'H', 'mostly', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'satisfying', 'tale', 'destruction', 'revenge', 'violence', 'excessive', ""n't"", 'escalate', 'levels', 'context', 'story', 'Cash', 'big', 'lovable', 'shotgun', 'wielding', 'teddy', 'bear', 'grim', 'finish', 'wet', 'warm', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'Rating', '3.5', 'stars', 'stylish', 'brutal', 'violence']",Ca$h
