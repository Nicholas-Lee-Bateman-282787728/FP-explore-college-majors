It is a relatively workman-like and relatively low-cost series of 'Charlie's Angels' vignettes.  Unlike the original TV series with Jaclyn Smith and Farrah Fawcett, VIP lacks the brief bits of humor, pathos and drama that made the Angels watchable.VIP is almost strictly for the visuals.  I will not say it can be watched with the sound muted, but my new TV has 1/2 mute and I often use it.Pamela Anderson almost made a science of looking good; if seeing her, at times briefly, in the context of a 'drama' is your cup of tea, then this series is for you.  If you actually demand some semblance of a plot and a script, well then, goto Amazon and get the original Charlie's Angels (the TV series, not the movies, to be avoided).

Then when Val announces her next guest, Ben Hale, an employee of the NSA (National Security Agency) all hell breaks loose when the remaining members of the Black Ops Commando Unit open fire on him. Turns out they wanted him more than Beeman.

Good Val Hunting 1/23/99Eric Collier, America's answer to Richard Branson, hires V.I.P. to protect him when he puts a bounty on his head.

Back at V.I.P. headquarters Kay is watching a movie on TV when her cable goes out. She finds out that they were the only ones who lost the cable. Which means that the message was meant to be seen only by V.I.P. Once Tasha learns this Collier introduces them to the people who tried to ""kill"" him.

Escape From Val-catraz 1/30/99V.I.P. is hired for the wedding of Cynthia Murdock, her mother is very rich and her father is behind bars at Cyrus Rand Federal Penitentiary in Los Angeles, California for having stolen 17 million dollars of police money. When he finds out about the wedding he says he'll reveal the location of where he hid the money on two conditions. One is that he is allowed to attend his daughter's wedding and the second is to have V.I.P. to protect him. The Feds agree but he has to lead them to the money first. On the way to the money one of the agents has a friend shoot at their truck to take out the other agent so the two of them can keep the money for themselves. With Val and Tasha following behind they see the whole thing and try to rescue Harry Murdock. Having succeeded, Val, Tasha and Harry Murdock are now fugitives because what one of the agents in on it said to the media. Having stopped by the roadside the two corrupt agents catch up to them and try to get Murdock but he escapes with Val. Tasha following behind takes care of the agents and jumps into the agents car with Val and Murdock. The agents find out that he's going to his daughter's wedding so they go there. Harry, waiting to see his daughter, goes out through the window and to the well in the backyard to retrieve a duffel bag filled with the 17 million dollars of stolen police money. When they get to the wedding the corrupt agents tell everyone that they're looking for Harry Murdock and then open fire which starts a fight between them and V.I.P.

He's now wanted by Hong Kong police for questioning in the 1997 death of the stuntman and by the Hong Kong mob for knowing the truth about his death. V.I.P. is hired by Jay Chesler now that his bodyguard (Johnny Loh) is on the lam. While doing her rounds Nikki sees someone is in the garage and goes to investigate. The person in the garage turns out to be Johnny Loh and he knocks her out and kidnaps her. He later returns to the scene of the crime with Nikki as insurance to get what he had earlier tried to get, his laptop with the truth about the stuntman's death on it. When he gets his laptop back a few members of the Hong Kong mob break in and try to get the computer, which they don't succeed in. Val and Nikki hide Johnny at Val's and Maxine asks Johnny to show her a move that includes handcuffs. She volunteers Val and just when Val and Johnny are handcuffed more mobsters enter and kidnap Val and Johnny. Johnny creates a diversion and escapes from the mobsters grasp. Finding out that the info they requested is in Emily Chesler hands they go after her at school where she works as a nude model.

Val must now locate Simon Wirth as he is the one the terrorists want. She finds him but he refuses to come so she takes him at gunpoint. The terrorists want Simon because he has the codes for the U.S. treasury, or so they think. He hasn't developed a new code for the treasury in over a year. The terrorists mad decide to open gunfire and a fight ensues leaving V.I.P. the winners.15.) Val on the Run 2/20/99A key witness in a video piracy case is being followed so he calls Val. She sends V.I.P. and they arrive just in time but the assailants manage to escape from V.I.P.

He decides to have V.I.P. as his bodyguards, with Val at his side at all times. While the agents and the rest of V.I.P. are waiting outside Val and Steve are in the hot tub. Then one of his housekeepers comes in and shoots Steve in the head. Agent Lampert informs Val that she's the target now because she now knows what Steve was killed for knowing. Then we see agent Lampert paying Helga, the housekeeper who killed Steve. Agents Lampert and McCoy then inform V.I.P. that Val ran away from them. Val and Maxine are at Maxine's mother's, then all of a sudden the bad guys show up and Val manages to keep them at bay until V.I.P. shows up. The bad guys escape making V.I.P. chase after them but the bad guy's car blows up. Tasha finds out that agent Lampert bailed out Helga which leads them to believe that agent Lampert is the leak. Val then receives a phone call from agent Lampert and he says he wants to meet her alone at a safehouse.

Steve then appears and some fake agents show up and try to really kill him but they don't succeed.16.)

While making their escape with the toxin on a sea-doo Val notices them grabs a sea-doo and follows them. She pulls ahead of them and shoots a harpoon into a lifeboat sending Tina and Angel into the water and the toxin into the air which Val manages to catch just in the nick of time.17.)

When Dr. Lonnie thinks the stalker might be a co-worker Val accompanies her to work. While on the air she gets threatened again so Kay tracks the call and Nikki goes after the stalker. Turns out he was only a messenger. Nikki warns him to step out of his car because there's a bomb under it but he doesn't listen and his car blows up with him in it. While on a break Dr. Lonnie hears a threatening message from inside the building. It turns out to be a co-worker who was playing a cruel joke on her. Dr. Lonnie is getting real worried now and asks Val to take over the show for her. Val agrees and does it with Dr. Lonnie right next to her. Back at V.I.P. headquarters Kay is going through a list of people who called the Dr. Lonnie show and got on the air. She finds the name of an ex-marine who might have gone mercenary. So Quick goes to pay him a visit but he attacks Quick. Then two women in uniform join in but Quick takes care of all three. Turns out the guy is also another messenger. Tasha goes to see her friend Badger to help her find out who the voice on the tapes threatening Dr. Lonnie belongs to.

Hearing that his cover might be blown Roy escapes with Jeremy, Dr. Lonnie's son, through the secret exit. Tasha follows and explains to Roy that she knows his plan.

Jeremy appears behind Roy and distracts him so Tasha can catch him off guard and disarm him.19.) Mudslide Val 5/1/99Val gets a call from Dr. Richard D. Gold saying that he needs protection. It seems that a certain car has been following him all week. The next thing we know, just as V.I.P. arrives, he's dead from an apparent heart attack. Kay looks through his laptop for clues and she discovers that someone tried to erase one of his files just before he was killed. Dr. Gold had mentioned that someone else's life was in danger before he was killed. She retrieves the file, it's an entry in an address book, The Red Oaks Health Spa. They go there undercover. Tasha as a masseuse, Nikki as a fitness instructor, Kay and Quick as guests and Val stays with the owner of the health spa. Then a suspicious van pulls up and a woman steps out retrieving buckets of sulfuric acid from the van. Nikki notices the van and the empty buckets and calls for back up. The acid was dumped into the owner's private hot tub. The rest of V.I.P. arrive just in time to save the owner and Val from stepping into the hot tub. It's clear now who the second target is. The owner's name is Bob Porter and until two years ago he was a federal agent in deep cover after a drug dealer named Adam Banta. Now Adam Banta is back along with Karen Rite. He wants revenge because he's now disfigured and Bob Porter had testified against the cartel in court. Kay then receives an e-mail from detective Grispy. It seems that Dr. Gold was murdered. He was injected with a mixture of insulin and pentothal. Karen and Adam steal the identities from a couple and stay at the spa. Val and Bob go into the sauna but Karen passes by and locks them in and puts the steam to the limit. While Val and Bob try stopping the steam Nikki, Tasha and Quick have a gunfight with Adam and Karen. Karen runs into the tanning room and Nikki follows her in. Karen tries to shove Nikki into a tanning bed and closes the lid. She misses the first time but gets it the second time. Then she gets the water bottle from the water cooler and tries to electrocute Nikki but Nikki gets out and shoves Karen into the tanning bed. The bottle falls in with her and Karen is electrocuted to death. They then go and rescue Bob and Val who have passed out are lying on the floor of the sauna room. They then go into the room where Adam and Karen were staying and find a suitcase containing insulin and pentothal. They also find two glasses with fingerprints belonging to Adam and Karen. Adam was believed to be dead but he's apparently still alive and gunning for Bob Porter and V.I.P. The spa is closed because of Adam. Instead of the telling the members the real reason and creating a panic they tell them that there was chemical spill. Another gunfight with Banta and his cohorts ensues but Banta escapes. Val and Bob go to her apartment. Kay calls to tell Val that Banta was tracking them. Val turns on the TV and sees that Banta and some of his cronies are coming. Val and Bob booby-trap the apartment but Banta catches them off-guard. He forces them onto the balcony where he plans to throw Bob over the balcony but his plan is thwarted by the rest of V.I.P.'s arrival.20.)
