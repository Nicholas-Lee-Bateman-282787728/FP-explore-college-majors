The play tells how a black woman should stop settling and giving a man her milk for free. Often hearing that phrase when I was growing up by my elders, it just meant so much more as you watch this play. It gives so many examples of how we as couples take from the very ones that love us so much and even knowingly in the process of doing it, continue. It shows how we have to push and convince our men to do the right things for us and how lack of a push can so easily end our relationships. Definitely a great theme for our younger generation of men and woman. This play does not back off off, so sit down and really listen to it. It teaches you something.

Denise's mother is constantly at their house giving both Stuart & Denise a hard time about why they aren't married yet. Denise is living with the milkman & why should he marry her when he's getting the milk for free. Stuart's assistant is out sick & the temp agency places Cynthia, Stuart's baby momma of his 5 year old daughter Tyler, in her place. Cynthia & Stuart's coworker Michael further complicate Stuart's life. Between stress at work, problems at home, and baby momma drama, things are bound to be popping! Afterall, ""This is Stuart Banks"" we're talking about here.This play was 2 thumbs up good! The acting is great, the storyline is great.

I stayed up till 2 in the morning watching this and his play Mr. Right Now. Every minute was a treat.  I especially loved the part where he finally realizes what he has and what he stands to lose by letting his lady walk out the door.  I was surprised by his singing voice.  I think he should release a CD so we can get the full range of his voice.  What I appreciated most about this play was that there was no gun.  I'm quite tired of every gospel play having a gun in it.  If I see one more character get shot I'm going to scream.  I loved this play and all his other plays.  I think you should buy them.  I know I'm looking forward to his next play coming out on DVD.,5,Two Thumbs Way up for David Talbert,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,788,"['got', 'play', 'watching', 'three', 'other', 'David', 'Talbert', 'plays', 'Malik', 'Yoba', 'was', 'was', 'excellent', 'stayed', 'up', 'till', '2', 'morning', 'watching', 'play', 'Mr', 'Right', 'Now', 'minute', 'was', 'treat', 'especially', 'loved', 'part', 'where', 'finally', 'what', 'what', 'lose', 'letting', 'lady', 'walk', 'door', 'was', 'surprised', 'singing', 'voice', 'think', 'should', 'release', 'CD', 'can', 'get', 'full', 'range', 'voice', 'What', 'appreciated', 'most', 'play', 'was', 'was', 'gun', ""'m"", 'quite', 'tired', 'gospel', 'play', 'having', 'gun', 'see', 'one', 'more', 'character', 'get', 'shot', ""'m"", 'going', 'scream', 'loved', 'play', 'other', 'plays', 'think', 'should', 'buy', 'know', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'play', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A
