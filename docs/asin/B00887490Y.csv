1548259,A3ITYWFTPW71H2,B00887490Y,Brett Talley,"[0, 3]","Movies about monsters that prey on children are as old as time. There&#8217;s something particularly horrifying about the death of our most precious, and The Tall Man, a movie starring Jessica Biel (and Lance Henrikson, one of my favorites), plays on that fear.Whether intentionally or not, The Tall Man presents itself as a movie about the slender man, one of the great folk tales of this or any era, the first to come completely from the mind of internet denizens. We are introduced to the town of Cold Rock, a former mining village that is falling in on itself. Poverty grips it, but worse than that, children are disappearing by the droves. Dozens have simply vanished without explanation, with speculation falling on what the townfolk call The Tall Man, a boogey creature that hunts for innocents. But is the Tall Man real, or just a pedophile in disguise?So that&#8217;s how the movie is set up. And if that had been the movie we had seen, I think it would have been a great film. But then things simply go crazy. The movie completely goes off the rails in a direction one would never suspect. It&#8217;s bizarre. It&#8217;s nonsensical. I can&#8217;t decide whether it makes a good movie or not, but it is certainly not what you expect.And then comes the denouement, the reveal. It happens after the longest ending sequence this side of The Return of the King. Spoilers ahead&#8230;As simply impossible as it is to believe, basically the Tall Man is a member of an international organization that kidnaps children from poor families and gives them to rich ones. Jessica Biel is one of their agents. Now, this is all presented as a good thing. A positive thing. It&#8217;s perhaps the most pretentious, ridiculous, condescending, insulting ending I have ever seen. And it&#8217;s presented as this deep social commentary on the state of the world.In any event, I do not recommend The Tall Man to much of anyone. Stay very far away.

Pascal Laugier, writer and director of the controversial shocker MARTYRS, returns with THE TALL MAN, a suspense thriller that marks a dramatic shift in style and tone from the director's previous film. THE TALL MAN echoes the writings of Stephen King in many ways, but mainly in its small town setting, the monster of legend that plagues the town, and in the narration that is provided by one of the town's young children. Jessica Biel stars as Julia Denning, a nurse whose selfless attempts cannot save the dying community from itself. Biel's performance carries the film, but despite her best efforts, her character simply isn't compelling enough to garner our sympathy or support. While the final reveal may seem like a cheat to the many viewers who set their sights on the supernatural, Laugier still surprises with an altruistic message of hope that few could have anticipated.

I went into it with the worst of expectations, assuming it was some kind of slasher flick with a name actor who needed the money. Nothing could be further from the truth as I was quite literally blown away by the quality of the story, the acting, the photography, every bit of it the equal of films with ten times the budget. This is a movie worth owning. Why? If for no other reason, it's one to have friends over to watch, or to loan out, and when you hear from them how big this little movie was, you can then take some of the credit. Just a suggestion. Take me up on it and you won't be sorry. Well, unless you're one of those who thought they saw the movie but obviously didn't.

It's the sort of film you come away from either really liking or really hating. I enjoyed the movie and found it to be a unique little thriller.A nurse (Jessica Biel) takes over the duties of her deceased husband in a small mining town. Her son (Jakob Davies) is kidnapped and she believes it's the work of the Tall Man. Local legends tell of a man who comes out of the woods and abducts their children. Can the citizens track down the abductor before he strikes again?Director / writer Pascal Laugier put together a smart indie thriller that looks like a slasher / torture porn movie from the outside but upon closer examination is much more intricate and elaborate. It's a great movie that keeps the viewer wondering what's happening all the way to the end.Jessica Biel gives a convincing performance as the nurse and single-mother of missing child David. This is a role like none I've ever seen her in. Biel's no longer the teen she was in ""7th Heaven."" It's hard to wipe the memory of her as Mary Camden from your mind and accept her in the role of a mother and nurse but she pulls it off quite well.Jodelle Ferland plays a girl named Jenny who claims to have seen the Tall Man. She does an impressive job of portraying her as a mute. Ferland displays different emotions with just the use of her facial expressions which can be hard for any actor.The high-definition transfer of the movie gives audiences a clean picture which thoroughly captures the gloomy ghost town it takes place in.

The soundtrack startles you when it needs to and all the creepy sounds are here to make your skin crawl just the way horror fans like it.There are a few special features but not the ones I was looking for. The story leaves one with questions you would love to hear director Pascal Laugier address through an audio commentary or featurette. Unfortunately, we don't always get what we want. It does contain visual concepts, deleted scenes, and a trailer.""The Tall Man"" takes the familiar elements of mainstream thrillers and the genre horror and slasher films we all love and blends them together to serve up an enthralling film that will leave you muttering, ""What's going on?"" to yourself. There are some predictable moments, but the end justifies the means in this situation. Just don't buy the Blu-ray version hoping for answers or insight into the story or characters' motivations.

1548272,A11IEVWTVBKW2J,B00887490Y,Femvamp,"[0, 0]","There are three facts made perfectly clear almost the moment the movie starts. The first is that when the mines closed in Cold Rock the town died. The second is that there are no schools for the children to attend. The third is less told to the audience and more told to what is believed to be the main character. A young girl gives birth and a nurse is told by her mother who the father is; it is her husband and the girl (her daughter) is not even eighteen years old yet. Three facts. Plain as day. A dead town. No Schools. No hope. And we are not even 15 minutes into the movie.This is a very dark and yet very beautiful movie that debates a very controversial topic. I've read some reviews that say that the movie condones the removal of children from poor families to richer ones but it does not. What it does do is bring to light three varying points of view. A poor but loving mother who fights to the bitter biter end for her child, a young mute girl who sees her life following the same brutal and hopeless path her mother has taken, and a young nurse who tries to change the fate of children by changing their circumstances. Which point of view is correct? The movie never answers that and that is what I like about movies. They don't spoon feed answers. But hey I know a lot of people like to be given the answers. To each is own I guess.Now there is one point I will contend low ratings and anger for the movie. I've seen the trailers for the movie and they do kinda trick you a little. It makes the movie seem like one thing but this movie turns out to be another. That I will give to the detractors; but it is a minor nitpick. This is not the first time I have gone into a movie expecting one thing and getting something completely different and loving what I have gotten. It all depends on your personal feelings on manipulation. I don't mind it; if it works.This is a fine movie if you give it a chance to work and if you understand that it is not trying to persuade you to give up your children. What it is doing is tell a story. That is all. Sometimes all it is is a story. A beautiful; sad story about a monster. A very human monster.

The cover alone was enough to pull me in. usually a purchase based on a cover means a bad flick but not here thankfully. Although I will admit that this movie was nothing like what I thought it would be. Still it was a really good flick that surprised me a bit. This is for sure a thriller but it looks and was marketed as a horror film.Cold Rock Washington has a problem, kids seems to go missing taken by a thief in the night. This thief is an urban legend called The Tall Man. Julia [Jessica Biel] is a woman in this town who has a son of her own. One night at home she hears something down stairs and goes to investigate. She finds the nanny bound and gagged and her son missing. She pursues the abductor that looks just like what the legends describe. Now with her son taken she must do all she can to find him. But not all is what it seems and people are not who they seem, there is a bigger picture that some do not yet see.This was a really good movie and may be Biel&#8217;s best performance of her career. She gives multiple layers to her character here, and she as to with the type of character it is. The changes that happen in this film are crazy and I was surprised by how many twists this thing took. I in all honesty did not guess them all but it was a fun ride watching them all play out.

Martyrs was so gory and extremely hard to watch, yet I will admit that it presented an idea so fresh and new that it shocked millions of people. The Tall Man, however, achieved nothing but the attempt at TRYING way too hard.  Trying to be a thriller; trying to be a social dissection; trying to be much too intelligent for it's own good; trying to be a twist on the typical whodunnit mystery; trying to make the audience ""think"" by giving actors these (cheesy) theatrical solo moments on camera about ""saving the children"". The only result of all this TRYING was failure at keeping my attention. *SEMI-SPOILER* The ending basically leads you to believe that a poor town should not be allowed to have children. Apparently, according to The Tall Man, only people with lots of money who live in busy cities should be given the privilege of having children. Doesn't matter if you molest your own children or love & try to protect your children with all of your heart: if you are poor, The Tall Man will take your children away from you.

1548276,ARMUEUP5JKC0U,B00887490Y,"Gigi Fuerte ""Child of the World""","[3, 4]","This is an excellent work that straddles the line between tense drama and psychological suspense. It starts off slow and almost seems cliche at first, but that's just to lull you into a false sense of having seen this whole act before. Hang in there because it becomes a taught thriller with clever twists and turns all the way to the end. About 30 minutes in I found myself thinking, ""Wow, what the heck is going on here?!"" and, soon thereafter, ""Holy cow, I can't figure this thing out!"" I was wracking my brain trying to figure out which of the many red herrings might lead to the correct conclusion.As mentioned, during the first 30 minutes the acting seems almost wooden and TV-movie-of-the-week-esque, but there's a reason for that. In truth and in retrospect, the acting is superb, the dialog exceptional, and the script pretty well thought-through. Looking back, I realize there are many neat details that add to the believability of the primary story. Admittedly, there are a few moments that aren't presented or fleshed out particularly well--e.g. the flashback scenes in the diner. Although these gave me pause for thought and caused me to drop suspension of disbelief momentarily, they didn't ruin the overall experience of the film.What's key is that this film isn't just about entertaining or getting your blood pressure up--both of which it does well--it's also deeply thought-provoking social commentary.There really isn't much gore to speak of (it really is psych suspense and not horror). The cursing is minimal and there is no nudity. I'd advise against reading too many reviews prior to watching this movie, by the way. Part of the fun of this flick is trying to figure out what the dickens is going on. For me, this one is worth a second watch.If you like your movies brain-busting, head-scratching, high-blood-pressure-inducing, and thought-provoking, this is one not to be missed.---A related aside: I think the movie's marketing team really made a mistake by making this appear to be a horror film. People looking for a true horror romp will be disappointed by this movie. I suspect that may be why there are so many poor reviews here. Those interested in a horror movie are expecting gore and death and not necessarily brain-jarring twists and turns and subtleties that have to later be analyzed and thought through--something that is required in order to really appreciate this film. Those who liked ""Red Lights"" or ""The Life of David Gale""--both movies with twists--will dig this movie. Those looking for traditional horror will be sorely disappointed by The Tall Man.",5,"No, it's not a horror movie.

That's my take on the mixed reactions to The Tall Man -- a film that actively defies horror conventions in multiple ways.  I'd guess that the negative reviews for The Tall Man here largely stem from horror fans expecting yet another trip into familiar territory and having those expectations upended.This is not to say that the film doesn't deliver on many of the standard promises of a horror film; it provides the requisite action, suspense and scares (and it also delivers on the requirements of any film with solid writing, acting, cinematography and direction).  But it also radically departs from the standard horror movie formula, landing finally in entirely unfamiliar territory that even the most seasoned movie vets won't see coming.  It's meant to make you think, not just to provide standard horror film escapist fare (and I say that as someone who's watched and enjoyed many standard escapist horror films).So if you want another iteration of the tried and true horror formula and won't be satisfied otherwise, you should probably look elsewhere -- this film is not for you.  But if you'd like to see something different and are willing to set aside your expectations and accept the film on its own terms, you may be pleasantly surprised.",4,"Not what you think it is, no matter what you think it is",1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,1403,"['[', 'No', 'spoilers', ']', 'unusual', 'film', 'horror', 'genre', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'not', 'unusual', 'film', 'so', 'experience', 'backlash', 'take', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'Tall', 'Man', 'film', 'actively', 'horror', 'conventions', 'multiple', 'ways', ""'d"", 'guess', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Tall', 'Man', 'here', 'largely', 'stem', 'horror', 'fans', 'expecting', 'yet', 'trip', 'familiar', 'territory', 'having', 'expectations', 'upended.This', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'many', 'standard', 'promises', 'horror', 'film', 'requisite', 'action', 'suspense', 'scares', 'also', 'requirements', 'film', 'solid', 'writing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'also', 'radically', 'standard', 'horror', 'movie', 'formula', 'landing', 'finally', 'entirely', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'even', 'most', 'seasoned', 'movie', 'vets', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'meant', 'make', 'think', 'not', 'just', 'provide', 'standard', 'horror', 'film', 'escapist', 'fare', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'standard', 'escapist', 'horror', 'films', '.So', 'want', 'iteration', 'tried', 'true', 'horror', 'formula', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'otherwise', 'should', 'probably', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'not', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'are', 'willing', 'set', 'aside', 'expectations', 'accept', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'may', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",N/A

At least, this is the first half of the film. Soon, the audience is thrown twist after twist after twist.First, technically speaking, I really liked the film. It's beautifully shot in a great location for a film with such a dark subject matter. The acting was decent, and the music was great. (although I'm almost positive I've heard some of it before.) Now, the first half of the film was great. We are introduced to the Tall Man and his legend through effective news clips and town talk. Then, we witness a thrilling abduction filled with tension and some jump-scares. But what starts off as a promising thriller/horror film eventually turns into a conspiracy/mystery/drama film. To be honest, I feel like it quickly loses its focus and foolishly throws its chance away to create an iconic horror character. (I really think the Tall Man could've easily worked as a horror character movie, just imagine a giant man creeping through your home and abducting your child.) It does have some great twists, but some of them are just too far out or predictable. Also, there's a scene where Julia rants about how the system doesn't work and about politics, which I felt was unnecessary although it does slightly relate to the film. My final complaint is that it drags on at times; when you think it's over, it actually packs in more. I did like the actual ending and the touching monologue, though.Overall, although it starts off well, The Tall Man is ultimately unfocused; and, personally, I feel like it doesn't effectively use the Tall Man (he's barely seen or used) and misses a crucial chance to create a horror icon.

All these townsfolk are the usual cliches and whatnot, the drunks, the small time diner owner, some mysterious suited guy who keeps searching for the kidnapper and there's Julia (Jessica Biel, ""Stealth"") who doesn't seem to believe the Tall Man tale. That is until her son is taken by him and she then tries to get him back and find out who this man is, if he's a man at all.The first 25-30 minutes of the film are the best part, there's the set up, there's brief descriptions from people talking about the tall man, then one night Julia wakes up and finds her son David gone. She sees 'The Tall Man' with her son on his shoulder and he runs off, she gives chase and manages to find his big delivery type truck rolling down the road. So she does the logical thing and runs after it, she ends up getting put in the vehicle, frees herself from being tied up and tries to choke out the tall man as he's driving with her son asleep at his side, which crashes the truck but this tall man still gets away with David.Unfortunately this movie really goes off the tracks after Julia gets back to town, suddenly everyone is against her and she doesn't understand why. The film starts to layer ""twist"" on top of ""twist"" in an attempt to drum up continued interest, the false finishes and eventual ""conclusion"" are pretty umm.... bad shall we say. Biel gets props for playing a different role than she normally has as she wears virtually no make-up and gets beat up a good amount of the movie.The idea behind ""The Tall Man"" isn't a bad one and with some actual thought and effort this might've been far better and more interesting than it was.

There never was a viable suspect and no bodies were ever found. Terrified local residents nick named the person or THING behind those appearances ""The Tall Man"". A local nurse, Julia Dening, will finally become extremely concerned by the question ""Who, or WHAT, is The Tall Man"". A mute young girl, Jenny (Jodelle Ferland), who is the only one to really have seen ""The Tall Man"" with her own eyes, holds maybe some clues to solve the riddle...This is a very clever, very surprising thriller which manages to preserve the suspense for a very long time. I managed to understand what is going on a little bit earlier than it was openly revealed, but still, it was only 10 minutes before the end...Actors are doing great. Jessica Biel is here excellent and as always extremely beautiful. Joelle Ferland proves once again her great talent - she will be a great star one day! William B. Davis, the ""Smoking Man"" from X-Files, plays the role of the local old and slightly hapless sheriff - or is he really so hapless? Stephen McHattie, a Canadian veteran actor, does a great job as a tenacious detective, Lieutenant Dodd (he is mostly known from second roles, but his threatening face is rather unforgettable...). Last but not least, there is Colleen Wheeler, who plays Ms. Johnson, a local crazy woman - Ms Johnson is a secondary but important character and Colleen Wheeler played her perfectly.I would advise to NOT read more detailed reviews or even watch the trailers, so you can go see this film like I did, without knowing anything else other than what we can guess from the poster at the cinema entry.

1548295,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00887490Y,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[49, 57]","THE TALL MAN is a social morality play disguised as a thriller disguised as a horror. It takes place in Cold Rock, a Washington mining town that has been devastated by the economy. Most of the citizens are dysfunctional hicks and rednecks who seem content to scrabble among the woods, getting drunk, fighting, or just rocking in front of the diner and watching it all waste away. Everyone, that is, except for Julia (Jessica Biel), the widowed nurse/wife of the town's only doctor (""He held this community together,"" more than one persons says). She is beautiful, poised, and has the determination and grit of a Terminator-era Linda Hamilton as she saves the lives of illegitimate babies in her ramshackle clinic (which used to be a school), or confronts abusive molesters in their trash-strewn front lawns.Big problem with the town: kids are disappearing. No one knows how, but the kidnappings happen so rapidly -- sometimes in broad daylight -- that people have invested the events with a supernatural fear, believing they are done by a shadowy figure that they call The Tall Man. When Julia's own son, David, is kidnapped by the figure, she goes on a relentless pursuit for the child. What follows is a tense and also baffling series of events as the movie yanks one rug after another out from beneath its unsuspecting audience. The movie, in other words, isn't about what you think it's about.It certainly keeps you on your toes. Even seasoned viewers who are good at figuring most movies out will probably need two or three guesses to put their finger on the secret of The Tall Man. In this sense, it keeps the film from feeling stale or too melodramatic, and the story's air of mystery lasts until the final moments. The end result isn't quite as amazing or deep as the preceding events wish it was, but it does offer the audience a sticky philosophical question that may or may not prompt discussion. This question might have been more tantalizing if the film had given us more exposition -- shown us more of the town and its families, both before and after the abductions, as well as given us a clearer sense of Julia's character -- but so much energy is expended on the thrilling start to Act Two, as well as on keeping the audience guessing, that by the time all is revealed, it is done so with an exhausted, nearly half-hearted sigh. In fact -- nearly unforgivably -- the movie delivers its final moralistic question mark directly to the audience three times in a row. The last shot may as well have been a screen shot with the words ""DISCUSS"" written on it.It's not done poorly, but the movie doesn't parcel out every answer that it should. It's worth a watch if you're sick of the traditional thriller formula.",4,Three Masks And A Movie,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,2723,"['TALL', 'MAN', 'social', 'morality', 'play', 'disguised', 'thriller', 'disguised', 'horror', 'place', 'Cold', 'Rock', 'Washington', 'mining', 'town', 'been', 'devastated', 'economy', 'Most', 'citizens', 'are', 'dysfunctional', 'hicks', 'rednecks', 'who', 'seem', 'content', 'scrabble', 'woods', 'getting', 'drunk', 'fighting', 'just', 'rocking', 'front', 'diner', 'watching', 'waste', 'away', 'Everyone', 'Julia', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'widowed', 'nurse/wife', 'town', 'only', 'doctor', 'held', 'community', 'together', 'more', 'one', 'persons', 'beautiful', 'poised', 'determination', 'grit', 'Terminator-era', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'lives', 'illegitimate', 'babies', 'ramshackle', 'clinic', 'used', 'be', 'school', 'confronts', 'abusive', 'molesters', 'trash-strewn', 'front', 'lawns.Big', 'problem', 'town', 'kids', 'are', 'disappearing', 'one', 'how', 'kidnappings', 'happen', 'so', 'rapidly', 'sometimes', 'broad', 'daylight', 'people', 'have', 'invested', 'events', 'supernatural', 'fear', 'believing', 'are', 'done', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'call', 'Tall', 'Man', 'When', 'Julia', 'own', 'son', 'David', 'kidnapped', 'figure', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'child', 'What', 'tense', 'also', 'baffling', 'series', 'events', 'movie', 'one', 'rug', 'beneath', 'unsuspecting', 'audience', 'movie', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'what', 'think', 'about.It', 'certainly', 'toes', 'Even', 'seasoned', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'figuring', 'most', 'movies', 'out', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'two', 'three', 'guesses', 'put', 'finger', 'secret', 'Tall', 'Man', 'sense', 'film', 'feeling', 'stale', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'air', 'mystery', 'lasts', 'final', 'moments', 'end', 'result', ""n't"", 'quite', 'amazing', 'deep', 'preceding', 'events', 'wish', 'was', 'offer', 'audience', 'sticky', 'philosophical', 'question', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'prompt', 'discussion', 'question', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'tantalizing', 'film', 'had', 'given', 'more', 'exposition', 'shown', 'more', 'town', 'families', 'abductions', 'as', 'well', 'given', 'clearer', 'sense', 'Julia', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'expended', 'thrilling', 'start', 'Act', 'Two', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'audience', 'guessing', 'time', 'revealed', 'done', 'so', 'exhausted', 'nearly', 'half-hearted', 'sigh', 'fact', 'nearly', 'unforgivably', 'movie', 'final', 'moralistic', 'question', 'mark', 'directly', 'audience', 'three', 'times', 'row', 'last', 'shot', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'screen', 'shot', 'words', 'DISCUSS', 'written', 'it.It', 'not', 'done', 'poorly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'parcel', 'out', 'answer', 'should', 'watch', ""'re"", 'sick', 'traditional', 'thriller', 'formula']",N/A

Not since viewing ""The Watchmen"" have I ever been so upset after sitting down to watch a movie. This movie is about nothing but wasting 1hr and 30minutes of your life. I actually stopped the video to check and see how much longer it was going to be and my heart sank to see another 39 minutes on the players clock.Why would an innocent movie starring Jessica Biel be so bad? Well I'll just say it as best as I can without providing any spoilers for those interested in punishing themselves by watching this film. The movie is on the same level as The 6th sense, The Others, Willy Wonka (ok I'm kidding about that one) where you watch the movie and at some point it's like ""haha I fooled you, you thought it was going to be like this but it's really like this"". Pretty much it's like an M.Night Shyamalan mind ""screw"" film. Except the twist isn't needed because the story never made any sense to begin with.The movie is about a poor town recovering from the Post Bush/Mid Obama era and for whatever reason children have been disappearing from the town over the years. Legend has it that someone called ""The Tall Man"" takes them. However you can forget the ""tall man story"" because that plot ends about half an hour into the film when it turns into a crime drama, and then at the end some kind of poetic notion to make you think (think about why did you just waste your time watching this nonsense).Honestly you just feel cheated watching this flick. Why you asks? Because you expect to see a horror film and this is not a horror film. It's like some type of ""horror""film a hipster would make before it went mainstream. In this movie ""Society"" is supposed to be the monster and the ""children"" are the innocent victims supposed to be the ones that need to be saved so they don't become corrupted by society. This isn't a horror movie, it's some type of political statement and it's a pointless one.Some people complained about the ending of this movie. I'm not sure what they were expecting. Me personally I was expecting to see ""Congratulations You Have Made It To The End Of This Movie"" flashing across the screen. As I'm sure many others stopped halfway through it as I wish I did. I still will never understand why terrible movies are always LONGER than they need to be.**********Edit Update****************I called this one of the worst movies I have watched and I would like to retract that statement.

Whether it be Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, or now Jessica Biel, those who find fame in music or modelling first and then jump into acting often get panned by the critics.  For Jessica Biel, this is unfortunate as she has tackled a wide variety of acting roles since joining the big screen as a teenager.  And most of them did not emphasize her good looks.  Whether it be Ulee's Gold, Next, A-Team, or The Illusionist, her acting chops are always spot on.  This again is the case with The Tall Man.

1548316,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00887490Y,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Tall Man (Pascal Laugier, 2012)The first thing to know about The Tall Man, the third feature from French wunderkind Pascal Laugier, is that unlike his first two films, it is not in any way a horror movie. I was as shocked by this as everyone else seems to have been, but then upon reflection it's not outside the realm of the probable; Laugier's first two features, while both superlative, were about as diametrically opposed as it's possible to be and still both be horror films (Saint Ange is a stylish, lushly-shot haunted-asylum picture, while Martyrs is a claustrophobic torture porn film with a studied absence of atmosphere). Unfortunately, it has been marketed as such, probably to cash in on Laugier's name, so a lot of people have been a lot more disappointed in this than they should have been had it been marketed as the mystery/thriller that it is. That said, it's not up to par with Laugier's earlier movies, but that's a relative thing; it's still better than at least 85% of what you will see this year. Laugier, after all, set his own bar very, very high over the past decade.Plot: Julia Denning (Blade: Trinity's Jessica Biel) runs a free clinic in the economically devastated mining town of  Cold Rock, Washington. She lives in a big, rambling house with her son David (Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules' Jakob Davies); her husband, as pretty much everyone who comes into contact with her during the opening half of the film lets us know, died at some point in the past, and the townsfolk are still measuring her up, not sure she can fill the shoes left by her husband--the town doctor. That's just one small drama in a town that has an overarching problem--the Tall Man, an urban legend-style figure who has abducted dozens of children and who supposedly lives in the abandoned mines.And that's all the more I can tell you, because exactly halfway through this movie, you are likely to shout ""LAUGIER, YOU BASTARD!"" at the screen and throw popcorn. Which, I rush to add, is in no way a bad thing, especially because the Big Reveal(TM) is then followed by the next ten or twenty minutes making you question whether you actually heard what you thought you heard, or whether the character who said it was simply trying to humor a psychopath, or... what. And even once that question is resolved, well, there are a lot more layers to this onion.All of this is not to say the movie doesn't have its flaws, though they are minor, if really annoying; this was Laugier's first picture solely in English, and there are some places where it would have been a great idea for Laugier (who also wrote the script) to hire a consultant equally fluent in French and English to help with the translation; there are places where the language simply doesn't flow in the way it does in his earlier pictures (and language is a very important part of all of them). Especially in the first montage--but I'm getting ahead of myself (though not far).We're getting well out of review territory here, but lemme tell you: if you're going to ""get"" this movie, at least in the sense of Laugier's filmic language, I will (briefly) break down the first four sequences for you, because they encapsulate everything I love about this guy and this movie.The first scene doesn't require any trickery. You put Stephen McHattie and William B. Davis on the screen together and I'm amazed cinemas don't implode with that much talent in that small a space.Then comes the second sequence, where we're introduced to both Jessica Biel's character and that of her sidekick/wannabe pal Jenny (Jodelle Ferland from the Twilight franchise). Jenny's sister is being rushed to the free clinic because she's in labor, and there's all sorts of small-town drama surrounding that that we get into that does a pretty good job of setting up the town itself, but that's secondary here. The baby is born not breathing, and Jenny and her mother wheel the confused new mother out of the delivery room (which is actually a classroom in an old schoolhouse, and how's that for the small things?). The door closes and we see the rest of the scene through that frosted glass that was in your principal's window. Which, in the language film film, is the same as ""let's show the naked chick taking a shower, but without actually giving the audience what they're really looking for."" It's a tease, but here it's applied to Julia Denning attempting to save the life of a newborn baby. Now, pause for a moment and think about the way this scene is set up--Laugier, very deliberately, has taken a setting that screams ""this is cheesecake"" and given it life-or-death implications. As well, when it's a naked-girl-in-the-shower picture, unless it's one that's going to come equipped with a soundtrack heavy on the wah-wah pedal, the only sound you hear is...the shower (and maybe the killer's knife clicking against the tiles). Here, you've got Julia begging this baby to breathe, and for the love of pete. It's one of the best-constructed sequences I can remember seeing in a movie in recent memory.Third sequence is the first half of the main title. It's inventive but nothing we haven't seen before (Laugier borrowed a bit from the way Fringe does place names, but of course put his own spin on it).Fourth is how we get introduced to the Tall Man urban legend--through a montage of news footage. Seriously, I can hear you groaning through the screen, but bear with me here. First off is the attention to detail--there's that ""small things"" argument again (and if I kept doing this, you'd hear it a lot). Melodrama directors will attempt something like this and then fade it into some godawful tear-jerking sequence of a fake-sympathetic new reporter nodding and looking sage while interviewing the latest victim's parents. Which saves on budget because you're no longer having artists create fake news graphics, you can stop casting all those extras, etc. But no--Laugier takes that sequence out to its logical conclusion, and it's masterful. I'm even willing to forgive him the whole ""kids vanishing in a puff of smoke"" trope, which he takes far too literally here (it's repeated later in the film to much, much greater effect, which also gets him a pass).If you look at scenes like that and say ""hey, this is a director who knows what he's doing,"" I can guarantee you a good time with this flick, as long as you remember that this is not the horror movie the trailers tried to sell you. It is something very different, and it is the better for that. *** ",4,"Laugier survives the transition to Hollywood, but not without some bruising.",1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,6510,"['Tall',

There are the cars up on blocks in front yards full of junk - the suspicious, careful exchanges among the patrons of the local diner - and the general bitterness that's settling like volcanic ash over the town.After some twists and turns, this movie does provide a resolution to the mystery, albeit a rather improbable and partial one. Along the way, you're sometimes not sure if you're being projected into a dream or if you've just been taken to another level of stark reality.However, it's not the overall plot that's really important here. It's the atmosphere that draws you in, and individual harrowing scenes, such as the town nurse's grueling pursuit of the snatcher's van.Above all, I appreciated ""Tall Man"" for its courage in photographing women as they look in real life, rather than as the finished products of Hollywood make-up departments.

The sad thing is I loved the first three quarters of the movie.  It was sad and spooky and scary.  Jessica Biel plays Julia Denning, a nurse and widowed mother in a small, down on its luck mining town.  Her husband was THE respected town doctor and she is trying, mostly in vain, to earn the love of the community that he had.Over several months, more than a dozen of the town's children have vanished without a trace.  People are blaming a local urban legend called the Tall Man, whom they say is the devil himself.When Julia sees a shadowed tall man take her son, David, it starts her on a thrilling chase to get him back.  This is where the movie makes several exciting plot twists that had me on the edge of my seat.  Is there really a Tall Man?  Is there a conspiracy of silence in the town?  Is Julia really David's mother?Up to this point, I was thinking, what a great movie this is.  Then the big reveal...ruined everything.  I'm sorry, but I cannot accurately explain my disgust of the ending without spoiling it, so if you haven't seen the movie, STOP HERE.Where do the writers/producers/director get off saying that rich people are naturally better parents than poor people just because they have more money?

I didn't despise watching it, and I loved the twist, but I couldn't understand why the suspense is taking so long until the very last minutes, when I realized the story is so controversial that they had to do it that way. If you have seen the movie, feel free to read my sympathetic opinion regarding why someone ""sane"" might've come up with such a story at the end of my mini-review.Other than the story, the suspense is really overkill. I was getting very tired towards the end. The ending didn't help either, and I ended up being more blue for a while. I read a few reviews here and there, and I realized it is a major theme regarding this movie ;)Third problem: despite the advertisements, this is NOT a ""horror"" movie. It is more of a thriller, maybe one of those psychological ones. So if you are looking for a good horror movie, you will end up with some regret.Despite all the problems, this movie has a good cast and great acting. The shots and camera work are made beautifully, and the setting is nice. Obviously the director has taken his time. If it was not because of the story and the long suspense, it could be a major hit.Pros:- Engaging- Interesting (first half)- Great Acting- Good CastCons:- Long Suspense (seriously overkill)- Controversial (not in a good way)- Advertised As Horror (but it is thriller)*** SPOILER ALERT ***Regarding the story, I think the only reason someone in the right mind would ever write such a story is grief.

Parts of this film reek with King's influence, but I don't think he'd be all that thrilled about it. When the film first started I thought it was a pretty good movie, but by the end I was just confused. The story follows a local resident in the town of Cold Rock, who has taken over her husband's medical practice after he passed away. That resident is played by Jessica Biel, whose performance and looks are really the only reason to watch this movie. In the town of Cold Rock, the children have been disappearing without a trace and the only thing people have seen is a tall man, dressed in black, leaving the scene. Some people say he's an urban legend, while others claim to have witnessed his abductions, and the whole town is terrified. I found it kind of funny that in a town crippled by fear, not knowing whose child could be next, the kids parents, let them ride their bikes to the store and let them play alone in the fields, it's just one of many parts of this film that just off. As I said, the beginning of this film is terrific, but then it gets weirder and weirder and builds to a conclusion that doesn't make any damn sense! I know this must of have been someone's passion and that they spent years developing it, but before you released it to the public, did you bother to watch it? Jessica Biel is sexy and a terrific actress who is way too good to be doing s***** b-movies like this.

When a nurse and loving mother hears a loud sound in the night coming from her son's room she is horrified to find him missing. She has joined the long list of people in the small town who's children have gone missing. Going in I was expecting this to be a horror movie. The first part of the movie was horror-like. Then a twist happened that made it more disturbing then horrorifying. Be the time the movie ended I was almost disgusted by the twists that I found myself wishing I had never seen it. All that said this is not a bad movie at all but I would compare this to ""The Lovely Bones"" more then any type of horror. If you have seen ""The Lovely Bones"" then you know what I mean by that. For some reason the latest string of movies are dealing with this idea (this is the third new one I have seen in the last week) and I really hope they stop making movies about this. On the other hand it may bring about more awareness. I don't want to disclose the twist because that will give away the movie but be prepared to be disturbed.

A French-Canadian production ""The Tall Man"" centers on Julia Dunning (Jessica Biel), a widowed nurse respected in the community, whose young boy David is abducted by a hooded stranger in the middle of the night.Without giving anything away, ""The Tall Man,"" set in a small Washington State ex-coalmining town, is less about the titular person and the truth behind the missing kids, than about the community's people trapped in this dying town - including Jenny (Jodelle Ferland), a lonely young girl Julia likes - and how the ""truth"" will be revealed to us in an unconventional way.Written and directed by Pascal Laugier (""Martyrs""), ""The Tall Man"" is suspenseful throughout, with enough surprises to keep us interested, though those who expected more orthodox-type horror might find it disappointing. Like Daniel Stamm's ""The Last Exorcism,"" much of the film's appeal lies in the flaunting, or disregard, of genre conventions.I am impressed with the way the film, without using fragmented narrative, tantalizes the audience's curiosity as to what is really going on, and Jessica Biel's fine performance.

In truth, it starts off great, has a really nice who-is-the-bad guy question attached to its murky, cold cinemtaic breath. But two thirds of the way through (and after a seemingly brilliant twist!), it suddenly veers into unknown, questionable territory.Allow me to explain without giving the (end) game away - which, in truth would be wildly imaginative of me to be able to as I have no idea what the f**k happened come the end anyway!Children are missing from a small town called Cold Rock. Once a thriving mining town, when it shut down they started vanishing, one by one.

What unfolds then for the next 50 minutes is your better-than-average whodunnit, but when her son is kidnapped by the ""Tall Man,"" suddenly the whole town is sent out on a murderous man hunt - but not for him, for her!You see, and again, not to (try) and give it away, this is where we have to try and figure out the plot for ourselves! I'm not kidding here either for it's as if the director quit one hour in (don't blame him!) and said film whatever you want, add it to the end of the movie, and put it in the stores! I can guess as to what it was all meant to mean, but some pieces just don't fit.

Nothing however is how it seems this film which has some fascinating twists and turns but is, ultimately, absurd. First thing that we need to get out of the way is the fact that &#34;The Tall Man&#34; despite the advertising and the first 40 or so minutes is NOT a horror film nor is it really a supernatural film. If you temper your expectations with this in mind you might enjoy the film but, more than likely, you'll find &#34;The Tall Man&#34; a mildly interesting failure.SPOILERS:Julia Benning (Jessica Biel) serves as a nurse in the dying mining town of Cold Rock unfortunately the town is best known now as a town where most of its children go missing. Local legend suggests that the children are being taken by a mysterious entity nicknamed The Tall Man. When David is taken Benning desperately pursues the attacker to retrieve the child.MAJOR SPOILER:As the story progresses we discover that Julia has been abducting the children feeding them to a secret network headed by her husband who places these kidnapped children from impoverished backgrounds to &#34;deserving&#34; families (largely upper and middle class from what we can tell in the movie). When the town's people find out she refuses to divulge what, exactly, happened to the children suggesting that she killed them to protect the children and their new families.END OF SPOILERS:&#34;The Tall Man&#34; begins as one type of thriller and quickly shifts gears into another type. It's rare that a director can pull of this slight-of-hand (The Prestige [Blu-ray], Stage Fright and Vertigo: Special Edition (Universal Legacy Series) are three that largely succeed at turning genres inside out)and, despite his ambition and talent, Pascal Laugier (Martyrs [Blu-ray]) doesn't have the skills to pull it off with &#34;The Tall Man&#34;; he can't pull the threads together to make this thriller either compelling. Laugier's glacial pacing does the film no favors either as the few moments of suspense that he is able to generate quickly dissipates leaving a thriller with no thrills. Laugier also does the film no favors by allowing the film to continue for 15 minutes after it should have ended. The points revealed could and should have been revealed in other ways (it could easily have been cross cut with the scene of the confession and would have worked better).That's too bad as the film is packed with strong supporting performances including well known faces from TV shows such as Stephen McHattie (Fringe: The Complete First Season), Sammantha Ferris (Supernatural: The Complete Fifth Season) and William B. Davis (The X-Files: The Complete First Season) doing a nice job. Even with the best performances from a supporting cast their roles are underwritten and Biel just doesn't have the depth as a performer to carry the film.&#34;The Tall Man&#34; looks decent if you keep in mind that the the intentional gloomy look of the film. The image doesn't have much depth.The audio sounds quite nice with a nice mix although if you listen in stereo you will find that the dialogue gets lost.As far as special features go we get a single deleted scene, the trailer and the Blu-ray has a compilation of conceptual artwork for the film.&#34;The Tall Man&#34; has ambition, an unusual concept and the director wants to turn the conventions of suspense thrillers on its head. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details (to use a cliche) and there's no devil truly here. Viewers have little tolerance for bait-and-switch movies (witness the mixed reaction to (The Cabin In The Woods [Blu-ray + UltraViolet Digital Copy]) and unless the director can skillfully pull off the project, it's not going to work. Unfortunately &#34;The Tall Man&#34; fails to live up to its potential.I would recommend a rental first to see if this is to your taste based on the mixed reviews.",2,"Abducted children, a mysterious stranger in a thrill less, convoluted film",1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,3928,"['Tall', 'Man', '34', 'interesting', 'premise', 'playing', 'traditional', 'conventions', 'thriller', 'Nothing', 'however', 'how', 'film', 'fascinating', 'twists', 'turns', 'ultimately', 'absurd', 'First', 'thing', 'need', 'get', 'way', 'fact', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'advertising', 'first', '40', 'so', 'minutes', 'NOT', 'horror', 'film', 'really', 'supernatural', 'film', 'temper', 'expectations', 'mind', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'find', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'failure.SPOILERS', 'Julia', 'Benning', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'nurse', 'dying', 'mining', 'town', 'Cold', 'Rock', 'unfortunately', 'town', 'best', 'known', 'now', 'town', 'where', 'most', 'children', 'go', 'missing', 'Local', 'legend', 'children', 'are', 'being', 'taken', 'mysterious', 'entity', 'nicknamed', 'Tall', 'Man', 'When', 'David', 'taken', 'Benning', 'desperately', 'attacker', 'retrieve', 'child.MAJOR', 'SPOILER', 'story', 'discover', 'Julia', 'been', 'abducting', 'children', 'feeding', 'secret', 'network', 'headed', 'husband', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'children', 'impoverished', 'backgrounds', '34', 'deserving', '34', 'families', 'largely', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'When', 'town', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'divulge', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'children', 'suggesting', 'killed', 'protect', 'children', 'new', 'families.END', 'SPOILERS', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'begins', 'one', 'type', 'thriller', 'quickly', 'shifts', 'gears', 'type', 'rare', 'director', 'can', 'pull', 'slight-of-hand', 'Prestige', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Stage', 'Fright', 'Vertigo', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Universal', 'Legacy', 'Series', 'are', 'three', 'largely', 'succeed', 'turning', 'genres', 'ambition', 'talent', 'Pascal', 'Laugier', 'Martyrs', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', ""n't"", 'have', 'skills', 'pull', 'off', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'threads', 'together', 'make', 'thriller', 'compelling', 'Laugier', 'glacial', 'pacing', 'film', 'favors', 'few', 'moments', 'suspense', 'able', 'generate', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'thriller', 'thrills', 'Laugier', 'also', 'film', 'favors', 'allowing', 'film', 'continue', '15', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'points', 'revealed', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'other', 'ways', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cross', 'cut', 'scene', 'confession', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', '.That', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'packed', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'including', 'well', 'known', 'TV', 'shows', 'such', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Fringe', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Sammantha', 'Ferris', 'Supernatural', 'Complete', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'William', 'B.', 'Davis', 'X-Files', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'doing', 'nice', 'job', 'Even', 'best', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'roles', 'are', 'underwritten', 'Biel', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', 'performer', 'carry', 'film.', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'decent', 'keep', 'mind', 'intentional', 'gloomy', 'look', 'film', 'image', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'depth.The', 'audio', 'quite', 'nice', 'nice', 'mix', 'listen', 'stereo', 'will', 'find', 'dialogue', 'lost.As', 'far', 'special', 'features', 'go', 'get', 'single', 'deleted', 'scene', 'trailer', 'Blu-ray', 'compilation', 'conceptual', 'artwork', 'film.', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'ambition', 'unusual', 'concept', 'director', 'turn', 'conventions', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'head', 'Unfortunately', 'devil', 'details', 'use', 'cliche', 'devil', 'truly', 'here', 'Viewers', 'have', 'little', 'tolerance', 'bait-and-switch', 'movies', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'Cabin', 'Woods', '[', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', ']', 'director', 'can', 'skillfully', 'pull', 'off', 'project', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'Unfortunately', '34', 'Tall', 'Man', '34', 'fails', 'live', 'up', 'potential.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'rental', 'first', 'see', 'taste', 'based', 'mixed', 'reviews']",N/A

Although this film has similarities in directing, this is not a horror movie so do not anticipate graphic gore as you will be left disappointed.

Jessica Biel gives one of her best performances, as the tortured emotional soul, who draws us into a story that could end, frankly anywhere.Laugier is an exceptional director, whose focus on themes of self sacrifice run through many of his films, leaving us questioning our moral opinions and emotions. He has successfully produced two very different genre films, and yet can instil a unique mark on both. So stick with this film until the end, it leaves you reeling (not retching) and thinking for days.Another thoughtful plot that is sure to leave you feeling slightly less queasy than the self-sacrifice shown in his previous work... this is a promise.[...]",2,Horror Trunk Review: Tall Tales,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,1180,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'appreciate', 'film', 'should', 'forget', 'name', 'director', 'Pascal', 'Laugier', 'Martyrs', 'film', 'similarities', 'directing', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'anticipate', 'graphic', 'gore', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'disappointed', 'film', 'slowly', '45', 'minutes', 'feel', 'were', 'cheated', 'mystery', 'been', 'resolved', 'too', 'early.Then', 'suddenly', 'twists', 'start', 'flying', 'storyline', 'left', 'right', 'got', 'centre', 'once', 'again', 'game', 'back', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'tortured', 'emotional', 'soul', 'who', 'story', 'could', 'end', 'frankly', 'anywhere.Laugier', 'exceptional', 'director', 'focus', 'themes', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'run', 'many', 'films', 'leaving', 'questioning', 'moral', 'opinions', 'emotions', 'successfully', 'produced', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'genre', 'films', 'yet', 'can', 'instil', 'unique', 'mark', 'stick', 'film', 'end', 'reeling', 'not', 'retching', 'thinking', 'days.Another', 'thoughtful', 'plot', 'sure', 'leave', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'less', 'queasy', 'self-sacrifice', 'shown', 'previous', 'work', 'promise.', '[', ']']",N/A

Don't listen to the naysayers on this website, they most likely didn't understand or don't agree with the final question the movie asks at the very end as the titles role..The action takes place in a small mining town in Washington state in the middle of the woods. The plot is poorly described on the cover of the blu ray. I will do my best to describe it without spoiling the story for you.Jessica Biel is a nurse (Julia Denning) who lives in this small town. She was married to the town's doctor who died and now tries to take care of everybody in this small town. This was a booming town with everybody working at the mine. Everybody was prosperous and happy. The mine is closed now for some time and the town is loaded with jobless poor people and a lot of young kids running around aimlessly while their parents drink, smoke, fight, and make more kids (...wonder where all the money comes from, for cigarettes, food and alcohol). The kids grow old and then they get married and make more kids on their own, while sitting in a bar drinking, complaining about how hard life is, and smoking all day long. After the mine closed and the town started deteriorating, young kids started disappearing. Everybody talks about a tall man who is most likely responsible for the abduction of the children. While everybody is uptight about the tall man, the kids are still out playing while their parents seat around in the town's small restaurant drinking, eating, and doing nothing. The movie starts when already 17 young kids are missing and Jessica Biel's son (David) is abducted too. She is chasing down the person who stole her son, and ....I am going to leave it here because I don't want to give you the really interesting plot and the unexpected ending of the movie. Unlike other movies that let you guess at the end or create your own ending (...sic!), there is a full explanation at the very end of the movie (last 2-3 minutes) and a question that begs for a discussion and an answer. It is difficult to give a straight answer. The director wants to make sure that we know exactly where he is going with the movie. After watching the movie please come back here if you want, and let's have a philosophical discussion about the story and its purpose. Do we need to break the cycle?Jessica Biel is outstanding and the supporting cast provides a great performance. Five stars all around for the very clever plot and the acting, and remember...""knowledge is the key that opens all the doors"".",5,Need to break the cycle!,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,2627,"['Outstanding', 'movie', 'lot', 'questions', 'Please', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'NOT', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'social', 'thriller', 'Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'naysayers', 'website', 'most', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'final', 'question', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'titles', 'role..The', 'action', 'place', 'small', 'mining', 'town', 'Washington', 'state', 'middle', 'woods', 'plot', 'poorly', 'described', 'cover', 'blu', 'ray', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'describe', 'spoiling', 'story', 'you.Jessica', 'Biel', 'nurse', 'Julia', 'Denning', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'married', 'town', 'doctor', 'who', 'died', 'now', 'take', 'care', 'everybody', 'small', 'town', 'was', 'booming', 'town', 'everybody', 'working', 'mine', 'Everybody', 'was', 'prosperous', 'happy', 'mine', 'closed', 'now', 'time', 'town', 'loaded', 'jobless', 'poor', 'people', 'lot', 'young', 'kids', 'running', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'parents', 'drink', 'smoke', 'fight', 'make', 'more', 'kids', 'wonder', 'where', 'money', 'cigarettes', 'food', 'alcohol', 'kids', 'grow', 'old', 'then', 'get', 'married', 'make', 'more', 'kids', 'own', 'sitting', 'bar', 'drinking', 'complaining', 'how', 'hard', 'life', 'smoking', 'day', 'long', 'mine', 'closed', 'town', 'started', 'deteriorating', 'young', 'kids', 'started', 'disappearing', 'Everybody', 'tall', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'likely', 'responsible', 'abduction', 'children', 'everybody', 'uptight', 'tall', 'man', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'playing', 'parents', 'seat', 'town', 'small', 'restaurant', 'drinking', 'eating', 'doing', 'nothing', 'movie', 'when', 'already', '17', 'young', 'kids', 'are', 'missing', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'son', 'David', 'abducted', 'too', 'chasing', 'down', 'person', 'who', 'stole', 'son', '.I', 'am', 'going', 'leave', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'really', 'interesting', 'plot', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'movie', 'other', 'movies', 'let', 'guess', 'end', 'create', 'own', 'ending', 'sic', 'full', 'explanation', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'last', '2-3', 'minutes', 'question', 'discussion', 'answer', 'difficult', 'give', 'straight', 'answer', 'director', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'going', 'movie', 'watching', 'movie', 'please', 'come', 'back', 'here', 'want', 'let', 'have', 'philosophical', 'discussion', 'story', 'purpose', 'Do', 'need', 'break', 'cycle', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'performance', 'Five', 'stars', 'very', 'clever', 'plot', 'acting', 'remember', 'knowledge', 'key', 'doors']",N/A
