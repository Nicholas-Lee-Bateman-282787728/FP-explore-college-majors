I agree with the other customers reviews that this was a good creepy movie. I remember telling some friends the best good part of movie when Ronald forgets to cover up one of his peep holes from his hidden room and one of the girls living there notices a stream of light coming from it. When she goes closer to peek in she sees a eye looking back her it's Ronald looking at her,as she starts backing up and screaming her head off Ronald busts out,breaks down the wall in slow motion which makes it more dramatic.

Not sure what that means, but it somehow captures the wrongness of this era, which was tame in terms of graphic violence (thankfully; I think gore is gross) by today's standards, but captures psychological terror very well. Or perhaps it's just my childhood memories talking. This era was very unique as the 70s had all that post-60s counterculture fall-out--- Manson, one cult after another, the weird juxtaposition of cultural ultra-wholesomeness of the Osmonds and the Carpenters alongside the decadence of glam and later punk. If memory serves, people seemed to be freaking out left and right in new and different ways..anyhow, this tale is a classic yarn about a sequesterd disturbed kid who lives under the stairs in a secret cubby and voyeuristically lives through the people he watches. There are nice little visual touches, like the 'peephole' camera framing. Also, I recall his room, with its demented art, being especially disturbing.

I didn't like it the first time I saw it but watching it again I enjoyed it a lot. I changed my opinion on the movie entirely. Ronald accidentally kills a neighbor and his mother hides him in the house to protect him from the police. When his mother dies Ronald is left to fend for himself and deal with the emotional trauma he has suffered over the accidental killing and his mother's death. This movie is very suspenseful. I found the movie extremely creepy. They was a very creepy scene between Ronald and the new tenant. It was scary in a psychological way which is effective. This is not Friday the 13th. It's not a gorey movie. One of the good things about this movie is it makes you feel conflicted about the character. I think it's a great thing in a movie where you are unsure how you feel about the character. I think Bad Ronald is a good movie and gets better with more viewings.

904730,A1RI3XMZHQXPD2,B0009FTOEY,C. Taylor,"[13, 15]","I hate to give ""Bad Ronald"" one star. It was an above average telemovie from the 70s that had a pretty good gimmick. A teenager wanted for murder is hidden behind the walls in his house by his overprotective mother. After she passes away he remains in his secret room. As he slowly goes insane, a new family moves into the house, unaware someone else is living behind their walls. This certainly could have been a better film. The premise had a lot of potential that was never capitalized on, thanks to the micro-budgets and two week shooting schedule these made for television movies were given. It also has it's logical flaws. Like how could a smart young boy destined for a medical scholarship cause the accidental death of not one, but two different neighbors, and in both cases panic and bury the bodies making it look like murder. Or how he could live for months behind a wall without the new family smelling his body odor from not bathing. But taken for what it is, a 70s telemovie, it has it's appeal, and was worthy of it's cult status.The problem here is not the movie, but Warner's DVD release. I can not even begin to review this film because it is an edited version. Some other reviewers here have commented on how three minutes are missing. That is not true. Nearly a half hour is missing. Furthermore this is not a DVD quality remaster, but a video tape master meant for the VHS market, and it shows.Let me start at the beginning. The original ""Bad Ronald"" would have been 95-100 minutes long, depending on how many promos for upcoming moves were edited on to the end of the film. Back in the 70s network shows ran 50 minutes per hour allowing for 10 minutes of commercials and network ID's ( commercials for other television shows ). This was heavily regulated by the FCC. Local stations were allowed more time for commercials per hour. This is why syndicated reruns were often edited, cutting out scenes to allow for more commercials.After it's initial broadcast, ""Bad Ronald"" was edited down to 74 minutes to be shown as part of ABC's daily 90 minute afternoon movie block called ""The 4:30 Movie"". This was the same time slot that occasionally aired ""The After School Special"", 90 minute films made for preteens that often taught valuable moral lessons. Unlike the other network programming, The 4:30 Movie did not air over the network, but rather ABC would send cans of film to their affiliates and allow them to pick and choose which films aired on which days. This was in the days when stations were still making the transition from film to video, and since some of ABC's affiliates still did not have video equipment, the decision was to distribute ""Bad Ronald"" on film, but of lower quality stock than the original print.When ""Bad Ronald"" was put on VHS for the home video market, USA Home Video who had no access to the original source material, instead found a print from one of the local stations who aired The 4:30 Movie. This same print had been used several times, was full of scratches and embedded dirt, and worse of all, the soundtrack had gradually grown muddy. But this was the early days of home video, and no one seemed to care about picture or sound quality. Furthermore, USA Home Video sped up the credits and made a few minor edits so that many of the fade outs for the commercial breaks were removed. This cut the film further from 74 minutes down to 71 minutes.Now nearly three decades later and Warner Brothers elects to release Bad Ronald on DVD as part of their archive collection. But do they remaster the film from the original film prints? No. Instead they use the USA Video VHS master. One that apparently was not stored properly because there are a few moments during the film where you can see where the tape began to erase. So basically, the copy released on DVD today is of lesser quality than the copy released on VHS back in the 80s. THE WHOLE FREAKING POINT TO BUYING A MOVIE ON DVD IS THAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE AN UPGRADE OF THE SAME MOVIES WE ALREADY OWN ON VHS.I have seen bootleg VHS tapes of better quality than this. The colors are all washed out, the picture is never crisp, and when characters go someplace dark, like a basement, they become invisible, as does the entire set, because the original video transfer makes everything dark look black. And the sound, horrible. There are several sections of the film where even on repeated viewing you can not figure out what characters are saying.And then there is that stupid 4:30 Movie editing. I have no idea what was cut from the 30 minutes, but it seems as if most of it had to do with the new family. Most of the version on the DVD is the set up with Kim Hunter, while most of the later scenes with Ronald behind the wall spying on the family that moved in are missing. The whole point of this movie was suppose to be the later. In fact, the entire second act of the movie seems abrupt. Also apparently missing is more of Ronald's relationship with Duane, with no explanation as to why Ronald hates him so much. I suspect the original cut of the film had more of Ronald being teased by Duane prior to the murders. With so much missing, I have no idea how better the original movie played.Shame on you Warner Brothers. Shame on you for selling an inferior print of this film on DVD. This should be recalled immediately and the proper, uncut and remastered version should be released in it's place.But judging how they never properly remastered the ""Kung Fu"" television series when they screwed that release up, it looks like this will never happen. We will have to wait until the rights to this film pass to a home video company that actually gives a crap.",1,Shame On You Warner Brothers,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",2013,5668,"['hate', 'give', 'Bad',

Ostensibly a horror movie but one could also view it as a dark comedy.  The first third of the movie is probably it's strongest thanks to the work of Kim Hunter as Ronald's clinging mother who could give Carrie's mother a run for the money.  Scott Jacoby has his moments as Ronald at times referencing Robert Mitchum in ""The Night of the Hunter"" in his performance.  The film kind of slags off in it's latter moments becoming a more conventional horror movie.  Not classic but not bad.

My sisters and I saw it when it originally aired back in the day and it affected us to the point that whenever we'd encounter young men who exhibited behaviors like the title character, that person was automatically dubbed ""Bad Ronald"" by us.This movie is not so much a horror movie as it is just creepy & sad - our house was kind of like the house in the movie & the thought of someone living behind the walls of your home while you go about your day-to-day is the aspect of the movie that haunts me to this day.The title character is a shy, socially inept mama's boy who tries to fit in with other kids but is rebuffed and teased until one day he accidentally kills a young neighborhood girl.  His terrified mother hides him away in a secret room in the house and leads the police to believe that Ronald has run away.  This temporary measure becomes permanent after his mother undergoes surgery & dies shortly thereafter (one of the most powerful scenes of the movie is when the character overhears the realtor stating that his mother has passed).Ronald has no way to support himself and is now mentally unbalanced & paranoid due to having to live in this manner until a new family (complete with 3 daughters) moves into his home.  He becomes fixated on one of the daughters and begins to take dangerous risks until he is eventually discovered.I'm not saying the movie is Oscar worthy but it took me back to a time when network movies sometimes rivaled those in the theatres.

Well, what happens when your mother is a little too clingy and practically worships the ground you walk on? Bad Ronald! After visiting some neighborhood stuck up teens in the hope they will accept him into their snooty club, Ronald slinks off only to be confronted by the bratty younger sister of a boy Ronald secretly envies. Well, she makes the mistake of verbally bashing his mommy and all heck breaks loose, Before you know it, the brat is dead, Ronnie goes into hiding with mommy's help, and tries to evade the authorities who soon come knocking. The movie has that gritty '70s feel of dark, muted colors and green paint. UGH! What was with drab olive green, anyway? Here, the house almost takes on the soulless personality of murderous Ronald. He spends his days cowering in a converted shelter in the downstairs bathroom while mommy waits on him hand and foot. She's so deluded, she actually thinks he'll become a doctor and cure her of her deadly gall bladder! Yikes! Soon, mommy (played to the creepy hilt by Kim Hunter) is off to the doctor and if you don't know what happens by now, you've been living under a rock!Ronald keeps expecting mommy to come back and pines away drinking powdered milk and getting lost in deluded fantasies of a make-believe world of &#34;Atranta&#34; that he draws on butcher paper and the walls of his self-induced prison. It's not long before the nosy neighbor next door comes snooping around and wouldn't you know it, Ronald chose that exact moment to come out of his lair to raid the fridge! You almost feel sorry for the little wretch and soon he finds out about his mother's death and continues to cower in his makeshift prison, growing more isolated and psychotic by the day. The house is soon sold and bought by a family with three pretty daughters. Ronald soon makes plans to snatch the youngest to live out his pathetic fantasy life in his deluded kingdom. It's all very cliche, creepy, and very sad. Pop it in on Saturday night and watch it in the dark. You'll be checking under beds and cupboards in no time.

He is constantly being picked on. In a bizarre set of circumstances, a neighborhood favorite is accidentally killed while Ronald is fleeing from yet another seven-against-one type streetcorner fight.In mortal fear, Ronald runs home to his paranoid Mommy, who is convinced that (of course) Ronald will undoubtedly be blamed for the death of the most popular kid in school and will definitely be sent to the electric chair. She decides to hide him, and builds a secret room inside their house for Ronald to stay in when people come to visit.Not long afterward, Mom goes to the hospital for some routine surgery, with a warning to Ronald not to leave the ""lair"" until she returns. Mom very inconveniently dies on the table, and Ronald remains hidden in his secret room even after a new family moves into his house.The new owners have a pretty teenage daughter, and lonely, warped, fantasy-ridden Ronald begins to drill spyholes in the walls of the house so he can peep at her. He then forms a twisted plan to kidnap her and keep her in the lair with him forever, a plan which is spoiled when she discovers the lurking Ronald.BAD RONALD is an unforgettable chestnut of a movie that is not very available, but is well worth tracking down, especially if you remember it from its showing as the Movie of the Week.

They had some really good suspense / horror movies on ABC back then. Neighborhood misfit Ronald Wilby (Scott Jacoby) is constantly scoffed at and ridiculed by the kids at his school and in the surrounding area. He accidentally kills a younger neighbor girl and fears that no one will believe that it was completely unintentional. His loving mother (Kim Hunter) hides him out in their home's hidden room to protect her beloved son. Soon there after, Mrs. Wilby goes in for an operation and unfortunately dies during the surgery. Shortly following her death, another family with three daughters move into the Wilby house. After what appears to be a couple of weeks, Ronald manages to hide and co-exist inside of the hidden room without the family knowing it.

904749,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B0009FTOEY,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[4, 5]","Disclaimer:This is a fictitious news report that serves as my movie review. The names of characters, and description of events, have not been changed in order to respect the authenticity of the film this is based on.In what is turning out to be one of the most bizarre news stories in recent memory, a teenage boy suspected of murdering an adolescent girl was arrested late last night after he broke out from iniside of the walls of an occupied house. Apparently he had been living behind these walls for several months entirely undetected by the new residents of the home. Police Officer Sergeant Carter said that the teenage boy Ronald Wilby, had disappeared in the hours fallowing the murder of a neighborhood girl Carol Matthews, who's body was uncovered in a shallow grave next to an alley way behind The Hastings Place less then a day after she was reported missing. All the clues pointed to Ronald Wilby, but when the police came by his house to arrest him, all they found was the torn jacket that linked him to the crime scene, and a hand written note saying that he had ran away. His mother Elaine Wilby, swore that she had no idea where he had run off to. Unknown to the police, Elaine Wilby had devised a plan to have her son cover over the existence of a downstairs bathroom with spare sheetrock and wallpaper that they had kept in their attic. He had done such a fine job of hiding this entry way, that any sign at all that a bathroom had ever existed in that location of the house was entirely undetectable to the naked eye. This sealed over bathroom had now become Ronald Wilby's new living quarters."" Apparently Ronald Wilby was very handy with tools."" Police Officer Sergeant Carter said.Throughout the fallowing month, Elaine Wilby kept her sons whereabouts a secret from nosey neighbors and police dragnets by feeding him through a specially designed trap door hidden in the bottom of their walk in kitchen pantry. It is said that Eliane Wilby would use a series of knocks to signal when their was danger, and when it was safe for him to make all the normal noises of daily lving. For close to a month Ronald Wilby stayed safely hidden away under his mothers care, but then his mother unexpectedly passed away during routine gallbladder surger. This left her fugitive son to fend for himself while living behind the walls of a now unoccupied house. But the house wouldn't remain unoccupied for long.It is the opinion of many that Ronald Wilby's father was an atypical deadbeat dad. He had been divorced from Elaine Wilby for an undetermined amount of time and was living in a different residence ever since. It is also reported that MR. Wilby had not bothered to contact his son for a very long time prior to these tragic occurrences. MR. Wilby now seemed to have sold the property to the first bidder as quickly as possible as a way of distancing himself from the shame of having a child murderer as a son. Unknown to The Wood family who just bought the house, Ronald Wilby was not only living inside the very framework of their new dream home, but he had also drilled various peep holes to spy on their three teenage daughters. Worse still, it is clear from the artifacts found in Ronald Wilby's secret room, that his mental state had been deteriorating rapidly for some time."" I guess The Wood family purchased more then they had bargained for!"" One area man remarked.It has been said that Ronald Wilby has retreated into a psychological fantasy world which he called Antranta. He covered the walls and ceiling of his tiny living area with images that he drew of a prince, castles, and an evil duke which he had angrilly attacked with splotches of blood red paint. He had also filled the spaces in between these various drawings with other nonsensical quotes and phrases such as "" Evil, bad, mad."" "" Why can't no one see but me?"" and "" Ronald loves his princess."" Though every member of The Wood family seemed to have noticed that some of their food went missing from time to time, no one but their youngest daughter, Babs Wood, suspected that something more sinister might be going on inside the very walls of their new home. Unknown to the discontented youngest daughter however, this hidden stranger had zeroed in on her believing her to be the princess of his fantasy world."" Even rats in a cage will go crazy if they're kept there too long."" Babs Wood told reporters."" Since Ronald Wilby had been living behind the walls in dead silence all this time, his now highly trained sense of hearing had picked up every detail of what The Wood family was up to."" Police Officer Sergeant Carter said."" He waited until the parents where out of town, and Babs Wood was all alone before showing himself to another person in the outside world.""It is reported that when Babs Wood had come home from playing tennis earlier in the day, that she had found her bedroom mirror covered with a large drawing that look like an odd oversized playing card. Confused, she had walked over to inspect this mysterious drawing when the bedroom door suddenly slammed shut behind her. Babs Wood had found herself in the presence of a soot covered wild eyed teenage fugitive. Before she had time to scream, he had covered her mouth with his filthy hands and warned her to keep quiet or else. Which she did out of fear for her life. News reports state that Ronald Wilby then told her that she was Princess Fansetta of Antranta, and that he was her Prince Norburg. It is also reported that Ronald Wilby told her that her family had been spending too much time with the evil duke. It is also now a known fact that The Wood family had just learned from their oldest daughter's boyfriend Duane Matthews, that his little sister Carol Matthews, had in fact been murdered by the last occupant of The Wood's new home. Babs Wood had suddenly realized that she was now face to face with the actual killer himself."" I said to him, you're Ronald Wilby aren't you?"" Babs Wood told police. "" But he just kept yelling back at me. I told you my name's Prince Norburg!""Though the events that fallowed are still not entirely known to the media, it is known that Babs Wood had somehow ended up locked inside the basement of her next door neighbors house MRS. Schumocker. It has also been stated that Duane Matthews had been bludgeoned, kidnapped, and found hogtied and gagged inside of Ronald Wilby's secret room. Duane Matthews even told police that Ronald Wilby had called him an intruder, a transient, and said that he was going to banish him. Realizing then that he might die at any second, Duane Matthews began to struggle, and it was his struggles that finally alerted the two oldest Wood daughters that someone or something was indeed living behind their downstairs walls. Ronald Wilby had then burst through the living room wall to elude discovery. It is said that Ronald Wilby then ran outside in a vein attempt to escape, only to be apprehended by the police on The Wood's front lawn."" We had been watching The Wood house because The Wood girls filed a report earlier that evening stating that their little sister Babs Wood had gone missing."" Police Officer Sergeant Carter said.It is reported that Babs Wood had managed to escape from MRS. Schumocker's basement and was actually in police custody at the time of Ronald Wilby's arrest. Police Officer Sergeant Carter has told the media that Ronald Wilby has remained unresponsive, and will not talk about his crimes."" All he does is just sit there nibbling on candy bars like a rat, while making these odd little whistling squeaking noises."" Police Officer Sergeant Carter has said.It has also been reported that MRS. Schumocker has not been seen by anyone for over a week, and it is now presumed that she is Ronald Wilby's second murder victim.This has been a Krakatoa1883 news report.",4,Rat Boy found in

904752,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B0009FTOEY,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[9, 9]","""Bad Ronald"" is one of those movies that, even today, seems admirably daring and creepy.  In short, Ronald has accidentally killed a neighbor girl and his mother walls him up in a guest bathroom until ""the whole thing blows over.""  Well ... mommy dies and a new, very attractive family moves in, and along with some of the furnishings, they get a Bad Ronald in the deal.  The kid has begun vacationing from reality and believes the youngest of the three daughters of the newly moved-in family is a princess he has to rescue.  Lots of genuine creepiness ensues.  What's great about this TV movie is that it takes its time building up to a climax.  In an era where TV movies and shows are cut to produce a stobe effect, Ronald is like a leisurely walk through a particularly quiet graveyard on a sunny afternoon.  Something is gonna pop out of the grave and get you, but you'll have to wait for it.  And it'll be worth the wait.  Bad Ronald is a mood that builds to a satisfying climax.  It is a movie that still holds up well today.

904753,A34HYQ9BQZPE78,B0009FTOEY,William Dorfer,"[1, 1]","Having heard about this movie, I decided to check it out and was fortunate to find it in separate pieces on Youtube. ""Bad Ronald"" is certainly an interesting watch and one of the horror films that made the diversity of '70s horror what it is. If you don't know about the plot, it's about a guy named Ronald who just celebrated his birthday (18th I think) and accidentally killed a neighbor girl. To keep him safe from the police, whom she doesn't think will believe that it was an accident, Ronald's mom hides him in the walls of their house, and that's where he stays throughout the film. The movie is well-balanced between what happens in the house in general, and Ronald's perspective of being stuck in the hideaway shelter he's in. This gave the movie a lot of its charm, it's got the sort of exciting, claustrophobic element that you get when you're a kid going about your tomfoolery and hiding from something in your imagination. It was suspenseful, and quite charming in its combination of suspense and youthful fun. For a '70s horror film, it really isn't that extreme in any manner, but what it lacks for in Italian cannibal exploitation or schizophrenic men in masks with giant power tools, it makes up for in all the great qualities I previously mentioned.
