Any who expects it to be, will be disappointed.Like the cartoon Eternia is a world where science and sorcery thrive. The action sequences involve both. Many of the classic characters are here, plus new character are introduced - good and evil ones.This is a live movie. Where He-Man, Man-at-Arms, and Teela are hunted and on the run. Where Skeletor is hours away from finally steeling the Power of Grayskull. Through Dimensional Portals the Eternian forces of good and evil come to Earth and battle. Then return to Eternia where Skeletor's forces are driven from Grayskull. The finale is an impressive duel between He-Man and Skeletor.",5,He-Man Live,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,694,"['adaptation', 'series', 'not', 'cartoon', 'who', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'cartoon', 'Eternia', 'world', 'where', 'science', 'sorcery', 'thrive', 'action', 'sequences', 'involve', 'Many', 'classic', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'new', 'character', 'are', 'introduced', 'good', 'evil', 'ones.This', 'live', 'movie', 'Where', 'He-Man', 'Man-at-Arms', 'Teela', 'are', 'hunted', 'run', 'Where', 'Skeletor', 'hours', 'away', 'finally', 'steeling', 'Power', 'Grayskull', 'Dimensional', 'Portals', 'Eternian', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'come', 'Earth', 'battle', 'Then', 'return', 'Eternia', 'where', 'Skeletor', 'forces', 'are', 'driven', 'Grayskull', 'finale', 'impressive', 'duel', 'He-Man', 'Skeletor']",N/A

Wishman ""Broadway Bound""","[63, 73]","While I was reading the other customer reviews of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; on this page, I was shocked at how many negative reviews there were. I absolutely love this movie! It is one the most fun movies you could ever see, and has been one of my favorites ever since I was a kid. When I was little, I had all of the toys, and watched the cartoon series religiously. Now I know that the movie doesn't stay true to the cartoon series, but you have to think of it as a seperate entity of a central idea. The makers of this film were trying to appeal to hardcore fans of the series, and also to attract new viewers to the series. In one review by Access Hollywood in the 80's this movie was hailed as &quot;The Star Wars of the 80's&quot; I believe that this movie is as good as Star Wars when you compare them as fantasy films. The special effects are great in this movie, when you consider the time that this movie was made. And they make a stunning transfer to DVD! This movie looks as gorgeous as it did when I first saw it in the theatre as a kid. I also love the acting in this movie. Frank Langella as Skeletor is simply fantastic. He gives a very theatrical quality to the character, and has just the right amount of sinister evil, and operatic intensity that he captures the character perfectly, without going over the top. In my opinion Langella deserved an Oscar nomination for his role, he was brilliant. As far as casting He-Man, the film makers had a quite a task on their hands, because He-Man is the ultimate super hero. Dolph Lundgren was a great choice. He had the ripped, muscular body, but could also do the fight scenes, and act as well. Other great casting was Courtney Cox, now Courtney Cox-Arquette from &quot;Friends&quot; where her character Monica Gellar is my favorite! Cox plays the Earth girl Julie, who becomes entangled in this battle of the cosmos. Also Meg Foster was brilliant as the evil warrior goddess Evil-Lyn. She was absolutely spellbinding. She captured the icy wickedness, and also sultry, seductive, evil beauty of the character. If I were a member of the Academy, I would have also given Cox and Foster nominations for Best Supporting Actress. Unfortunately until the recent 11 Oscar wins for the most deserving &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; the Academy did not honor fantasy films. &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; was just a little ahead of its time. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews on this sight, this is truly one of the greatest fantasy films of our time!",5,"Pure Fun For Fans Of The Series, Or Fans Of Fantasy!",1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,2552,"['was', 'reading', 'other', 'customer', 'reviews', 'quot', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'quot', 'page', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'were', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'movies', 'could', 'ever', 'see', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'ever', 'was', 'kid', 'When', 'was', 'little', 'had', 'toys', 'watched', 'cartoon', 'series', 'religiously', 'Now', 'know', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stay', 'true', 'cartoon', 'series', 'have', 'think', 'seperate', 'entity', 'central', 'idea', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'appeal', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'series', 'also', 'attract', 'new', 'viewers', 'series', 'one', 'review', 'Access', 'Hollywood', '80', 'movie', 'was', 'hailed', 'quot', 'Star', 'Wars', '80', 'quot', 'believe', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Star', 'Wars', 'when', 'compare', 'fantasy', 'films', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'when', 'consider', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'make', 'stunning', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'movie', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'theatre', 'kid', 'also', 'love', 'acting', 'movie', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Skeletor', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'very', 'theatrical', 'quality', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'sinister', 'evil', 'operatic', 'intensity', 'character', 'perfectly', 'going', 'top', 'opinion', 'Langella', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'was', 'brilliant', 'As', 'far', 'casting', 'He-Man', 'film', 'makers', 'had', 'quite', 'task', 'hands', 'He-Man', 'ultimate', 'super', 'hero', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'had', 'ripped', 'muscular', 'body', 'could', 'also', 'do', 'fight', 'scenes', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'Other', 'great', 'casting', 'was', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'now', 'Courtney', 'Cox-Arquette', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'where', 'character', 'Monica', 'Gellar', 'favorite', 'Cox', 'Earth', 'girl', 'Julie', 'who', 'entangled', 'battle', 'cosmos', 'Also', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'was', 'brilliant', 'evil', 'warrior', 'goddess', 'Evil-Lyn', 'was', 'absolutely', 'spellbinding', 'captured', 'icy', 'wickedness', 'also', 'sultry', 'seductive', 'evil', 'beauty', 'character', 'were', 'member', 'Academy', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'given', 'Cox', 'Foster', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Unfortunately', 'recent', '11', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'most', 'deserving', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'quot', 'Academy', 'did', 'not', 'honor', 'fantasy', 'films', 'quot', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'ahead', 'time', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'negative', 'reviews', 'sight', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'fantasy', 'films', 'time']",N/A

But for those who think this blu-ray re release has much more to offer than the dvd, save your money.I did not watch the credits till the end so i can not say who did the 35 file to digital conversion, but it was OK. I always thought this movie had the potential to do so much more, but was cut sharp in the FX department. I mean, you had the talent, you had the script, you had a whole universe to draw from, you had the right producers, the right director, and the right studio. But you had all the wrong in the special effects and it made this into a expensive b rated movie. When i first saw this movie at the movie house i was really disappointed by the special effects. Maybe even ten years later, Star Wars and the ones that followed still told my mind what special effects should look like, anyway, this one fell short.One of my biggest gripes is that Dolph Lundgren left out a really big piece of the movie when he grabbed his sword, he simply said i have the power, and he should have said &#34;By the power of Grayskull...&#34; Once the transformation was complete, he should have continued with &#34;...I have the power!&#34;Frank Langella's performance as Skeletor was nothing more than awesome.But the digital conversion was not really much on this movie, just simple video noise reduction.

ago which very sad to say only has an Audio commentary by Director Gary Goddardthere is no making of featurette or any other extras which is very sad from a fans point of viewthis film definitely deserves a making of featurette or an interview with Gary Goddard, but no extrasjust an audio commentary by Gary Goddard, His commentary is excellent actuallyhe talks about the Production of the film which was by Cannon back in 1987he talks about Dolph Lundgren and Frank Langella, the special effects, the make uppretty much everything about the film, very interesting commentary, no Doubt about it.the film is in Widescreen, the picture and audio is very Good quality for DVDin my opinion,Cannon at the time tried their best to make a Live action adaptation of this classic animated seriesthe storyline and the characters is as faithful as it's ever going to be back in 1987mainly cause there were no Digital effects back then, so cannon had to make do with what they had.also to cut the costs cannon changed the plot to have present day Earth involvedGary Goddard explains everything in the commentary.Frank Langella gives an outstanding performance as Skelator, Frank Langella steals the whole filman Academy award performance in my opinioni've seen the film so many times that i know how Frank Langella portrays SkelatorFrank Langella portays as skelator who is addicted to unlimited power and control and shows no mercyvery frighteningDolph Lundren plays He man excellent aswell along with the other characters in the filmbut Frank Langella is on top in every sceneBill conti's score is fantastic, he did a fantastic score in this filmespecially when Skelator comes through the massive Door to Earth, chilling scoreit's like Skelator was showing off how powerfull he was coming through the Huge big Door to Earth.but everyone has opinions you might see the scene differently to me.Warner bros who now owns the rights to this filmreleased this film on blu-ray as a 25th Anniversary release which is an insult to any He-man fanthis blu-ray release is exactly the same as the DVD release from years agothere is no new featurette on the making of this film, no Deleted scenes or outtakes, if there is any.just the same Audio commentary by Gary Goddardso this shameful blu-ray release is probably a DVD transfer with the Audio commentary includedthere is a new Documentary i have seen on youtubeabout the He-man/Masters of the universe Legacy, excellent Documentarythere's interviews with Gary Goddard and the producers from the 1987 filmfor some reason this Doco was not put on this blu-ray releasethis Doco can only been seen on youtube as far as i knowso this blu-ray release is an insult for sure, a waste of money.i would love to give this film a 5 star rating, it deserves itbut this review is about this blu-ray release which is an insult to the fans of the animated seriesjust an audio commentary that's all it is which the DVD release has anywayso

338357,AX08QJGPHH149,6302815673,Ben Riddle,"[5, 10]","I loved He-Man and the Masters of the Universe growing up.  When his sister, She-Ra, arrived on the scene, my little sister got to join in the fun as well.But that was at least seventeen years ago. I finally had the opportunity to watch the movie, and I'm giving it four stars for special effects, but that's it.  &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; is an excellent example of how cheesy action/adventure movies could get in the 1980's.  The blasters that everyone appears to using throughout the movie, as well as Skeletor's black stormtroopers, look like they've been ripped off from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies.  For that matter, Bill Conti's Main Title theme sounds like it's been ripped off from the &quot;Superman&quot; movies.  I don't think Dolph Lundgren's performance as He-Man made my spine tingle as much as it should have, which would be partially explained by the fact that I almost expected  him to act like the Punisher or Ivan Drago (&quot;Rocky IV&quot;.)The movie is helped along, however, by the comic relief of the red-haired dwarf our heroes meet, who looks as though he was clearly intended to be Orko the wizard but circumstances may not have permitted it.Finally, since he has longer hair, you'll have to look closely at Courtney Cox's boyfriend to recognize actor Robert Duncan McNeil, who later become known to my fellow Star Trek fans as Lt.

Well, I feel the movie was a MAJOR IMPROVEMENT! Generally speaking, I don't like it when people try to make cartoons into movies. (It usually doesn't look right.) But here they avoided the misake of trying to make everyone look exactly like the cartoon. Also, while they brought back some familiar figures like He Man, Man At Arms, and Skeletor, they added some new characters like Blade.While this is a fantasy environment, somehow we accept it as real when Skeletor marches into Grey Skull. Frank Langella (formerly Dracula) is PHENOMENAL as Skeletor. He makes him evil, intelligent, and scary. Yet through Langella's great acting, we still like him in a way.We then meet our heroes He Man, Teela, and Man at Arms. They are not the stiff invulnerable characters they were in the cartoon. He Man is strong, but he does get injured from time to time. Dolph will probably always be known for his role as Ivan Drago. (The evil Russian Boxer in ""Rocky IV"" who killed Apollo and inflicted brain trauma that ended Rocky's boxing career.) However, in this movie, Dolph shows his abilities as an actor more. He gets the 1st end of the circle in motion when he tells Skeletor: ""It was always between us.""Skeletor gains the upperhand, and our heroes escape by going back in time where they make friends. (one is a girl who lost her parents in a plane accident.) The movie drags at times, but not too often.When an effort to capture He Man fails, Skeletor puts Evil Lynne into action. In a typically evil moment, Evil Lynne manipulates a girl's most vulnerable emotion.  Evil Lynne is an interesting character. While she stands up to Skeletor at times, she knows how to manipulate the fact that he likes her.Moving on, Skeletor's powers increase, and despite his evil, he is really likable. There is a huge climactic moment when He Man's and Skeletor's forces clash. While we probably know who will come out on top, there is something memorable about how He Man restates: ""It was always between us,"" to which Skeletor responds: ""Yes! Let this be our final battle!"" While I feel it could have lasted longer, the final fight between He Man and Skeletor is well worth the wait.While not a masterpiece, it is really well done.",4,Ivan Drago Meets Dracula,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,2328,"['child', 'watched', 'cartton', 'felt', 'Man', 'was', 'too', 'powerful', 'Skeletor', 'was', 'not', 'smart', 'strong', 'enough', 'Well', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'MAJOR', 'IMPROVEMENT', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'people', 'try', 'make', 'cartoons', 'movies', 'usually', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'here', 'avoided', 'misake', 'trying', 'make', 'everyone', 'look', 'exactly', 'cartoon', 'Also', 'brought', 'back', 'familiar', 'figures', 'Man', 'Man', 'Arms', 'Skeletor', 'added', 'new', 'characters', 'Blade.While', 'fantasy', 'environment', 'somehow', 'accept', 'real', 'when', 'Skeletor', 'Grey', 'Skull', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'formerly', 'Dracula', 'PHENOMENAL', 'Skeletor', 'evil', 'intelligent', 'scary', 'Langella', 'great', 'acting', 'still', 'way.We', 'then', 'meet', 'heroes', 'Man', 'Teela', 'Man', 'Arms', 'are', 'not', 'stiff', 'invulnerable', 'characters', 'were', 'cartoon', 'Man', 'strong', 'get', 'injured', 'time', 'time', 'Dolph', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'role', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'evil', 'Russian', 'Boxer', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'who', 'killed', 'Apollo', 'inflicted', 'brain', 'trauma', 'ended', 'Rocky', 'boxing', 'career', 'However', 'movie', 'Dolph', 'abilities', 'actor', 'more', '1st', 'end', 'circle', 'motion', 'when', 'Skeletor', 'was', 'always', 'Skeletor', 'gains', 'upperhand', 'heroes', 'escape', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'make', 'friends', 'one', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'parents', 'plane', 'accident', 'movie', 'drags', 'times', 'not', 'too', 'often.When', 'effort', 'capture', 'Man', 'Skeletor', 'Evil', 'Lynne', 'action', 'typically', 'evil', 'moment', 'Evil', 'Lynne', 'girl', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'emotion', 'Evil', 'Lynne', 'interesting', 'character', 'up', 'Skeletor', 'times', 'how', 'manipulate', 'fact', 'her.Moving', 'Skeletor', 'powers', 'increase', 'evil', 'really', 'likable', 'huge', 'climactic', 'moment', 'when', 'Man', 'Skeletor', 'forces', 'clash', 'probably', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'something', 'memorable', 'how', 'was', 'always', 'Skeletor', 'Yes', 'Let', 'be', 'final', 'battle', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'final', 'fight', 'Man', 'Skeletor', 'well', 'wait.While', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Who better to play He-Man, then the talented (and hugely popular, at the time) Dolph Lundgren?  I couldn't wait to see the movie in the theaters.Well, leave it to the &quot;big-shots&quot; in Hollywood to ruin a perfectly good movie.Before I begin my diatribe on everything wrong with this movie, I'll start by saying that Teela (played by the delightful Chelsea Field) is absolutely breath-taking.  Her charisma and stunning costume shine brighter than all those who surround her.Now, it is my unfortunate duty to inform you Earthlings that &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; is a real stinker.  The tagline for this movie was &quot;A Battle Fought In The Stars. Now... Comes To Earth.&quot;  Why, why, why?!  Taking He-Man and Skeletor out of Eternia, and putting them on Earth, was a huge mistake.  The only reason why I think the writers chose to do this, was so they could save on budget by not having to create elaborate sets of Eternia.  By taking the gang out Eternia, you also drastically limit the number of characters that can make an appearance in the movie.Where's King Randor?Where's Man-E-Faces?Where's Buzz Off?Where's Leech?Where's Webstor? (Emmanuel Lewis, he's not!)Where's Battlecat?Where's Kobra Kahn?Where's Clawful?And where's my personal favorite, Manteena?The list goes on and on.When we are introduced to Kevin and Julie (a pre-&quot;Friends&quot; Courtney Cox) - the helpless kids who need He-Man and friends to save them - you can't help but shake your head in disappointment.  Why must the Earthlings meddle in the battle for Eternia?  And James Tolkan's &quot;Detective Lubic&quot; character (who isn't much of a stretch from his Mr. Strickland character in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies), doesn't help the cause.  It's sad that the most colorful characters in a He-Man movie are the humans.The plot of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; is laughable - music saves the day?  Come on!If that's not enough to deter you from watching this movie, there's always the characters:* He-Man acts like a bumbling fool most of the movie.* Man-At-Arms looks like a grandpa wearing a stupid costume* Gwildor... where did this guy come from, and how can we send him back there?* Skeletor has lips, you can clearly see them in close-ups.  Lips?  He's a skeleton!?* Blade &amp; Karg are last minute additions to the cast who do nothing but taint the creativity of the original character creations.&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; had endless potential, but it failed on too many levels for me to recommend this to any fans of the original He-Man cartoon.

338376,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,6302815673,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[1, 1]","A wave of nostalgia for movies from the 1980's led me to this  movie. I had never seen ""Masters Of The Universe"" but I had  heard about it over the years. And most of what I had heard about it wasn't particularly good. I recently read about it in a magazine article titled ""Bad Movies We Just Can't Stop Watching."" That seems a bit harsh and unfair. ""Masters"" is not a bad movie at all. It is, instead a fun fantasy movie (far better than a movie based on a cartoon and toy series should be), with plenty of fun, campy value-- and that is how this movie should be watched and enjoyed. No, it isn't great cinema art, but it is a lot of fun. I have never seen the cartoon series, so I could just enjoy this live-action adaptation for what it is. If ""Masters"" hasn't yet achieved ""Cult Film"" Status, it definitely deserves to.Evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) seeks to rule over the Planet Eternia. To this end, he has captured Castle Greyskull and inprisoned the good Sorceress (Christina Pickles). He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) and some freedom fighters  including  Jon Cypher, seek to free the Sorceress and stop Skeletor. During the initial battle, He-Man and friends are accidentally transported to Earth by means of a Cosmic Key, invented by the rather bumbling, Goblin-like Gwildor (Billy Barty; looking more frightening/ creepy in his Goblin-like make-up than Frank Langella as Skeletor).  On Earth, teenagers Julie and Kevin (Courtney Cox in her film debut, long before ""Friends"" and the ""Scream""  movies; and Robert Duncan McNeill; best known for his roles on ""All My Children"" and ""Star Trek: Voyager"") are quickly caught up in the He-Man/Skeletor battle.Dolph Lundgren isn't required to do much as He-Man except fight and run around nearly naked in leather underwear. Yet, Lundgren is a perfect embodiment of the perfectly heroic He-Man. Let's face it: Lundgren has a hot body!! Frank Langella  ""(Amadeus"",  ""Dracula"", ""Frost/Nixon"") as Skeletor is the real star of this movie. Langella, wearing great make-up designed by Michael Westmore, goes deliciously, delightfully over-the-top but, by also taking the role and the material seriously, he gives a certain gravitas to the entire film. Popular 1970's-1980's actress Meg Foster as Evil-Lyn also brings an air of sinister dignity to the film. Evil-Lyn is always anxious to do Skeletor's bidding. Skeletor, while craving absolute power, seems equally anxious to have He-Man as his slave; which brings an interesting homoerotic subtext to the film.  Don't worry-- little kids will never notice it). But when the action moves back to Eternia for the climax, Skeletor takes obvious delight in having an  even more almost naked He-Man whipped and down on his knees before him.Director Gary Goddard provides a surprisingly lively audio commentary. Goddard describes, in detail, the difficulties and compromises involved in shooting a supposedly $17 Million fantasy film on a tight schedule with an increasingly tighter financial budget. The movie mostly takes place at night because, as Goddard explains, He-Man, Gwildor, Skeletor, Evil-Lyn and all the characters of Eternia  would look ridculous parading down California streets in broad daylight. Skeltor's ""surprise"" after the closing credits hints at a planned sequel that was never filmed.",4,SKELETOR WANTS HE-MAN!!!!!,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3289,"['wave', 'nostalgia', 'movies', '1980', 'led', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'had', 'heard', 'years', 'most', 'what', 'had', 'heard', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'recently', 'read', 'magazine', 'article', 'titled', 'Bad', 'Movies', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Watching', 'bit', 'harsh', 'unfair', 'Masters', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'instead', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'based', 'cartoon', 'toy', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'plenty', 'fun', 'campy', 'value', 'how', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'No', ""n't"", 'great', 'cinema', 'art', 'lot', 'fun', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'series', 'could', 'just', 'enjoy', 'live-action', 'adaptation', 'what', 'Masters', ""n't"", 'yet', 'achieved', 'Cult', 'Film', 'Status', 'definitely', 'to.Evil', 'Skeletor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'rule', 'Planet', 'Eternia', 'end', 'captured', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'inprisoned', 'good', 'Sorceress', 'Christina', 'Pickles', 'He-Man', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'including', 'Jon', 'Cypher', 'seek', 'free', 'Sorceress', 'stop', 'Skeletor', 'initial', 'battle', 'He-Man', 'friends', 'are', 'accidentally', 'transported', 'Earth', 'means', 'Cosmic', 'Key', 'invented', 'rather', 'bumbling', 'Goblin-like', 'Gwildor', 'Billy', 'Barty', 'looking', 'more', 'frightening/', 'creepy', 'Goblin-like', 'make-up', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Skeletor', 'Earth', 'teenagers', 'Julie', 'Kevin', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'film', 'debut', 'long', 'Friends', 'Scream', 'movies', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'best', 'known', 'roles', 'My', 'Children', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'are', 'quickly', 'caught', 'up', 'He-Man/Skeletor', 'battle.Dolph', 'Lundgren', ""n't"", 'required', 'do', 'much', 'He-Man', 'fight', 'run', 'around', 'nearly', 'naked', 'leather', 'underwear', 'Lundgren', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'perfectly', 'heroic', 'He-Man', 'Let', 'face', 'Lundgren', 'hot', 'body', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Amadeus', 'Dracula', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Skeletor', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'Langella', 'wearing', 'great', 'make-up', 'designed', 'Michael', 'Westmore', 'deliciously', 'delightfully', 'over-the-top', 'also', 'taking', 'role', 'material', 'seriously', 'certain', 'gravitas', 'entire', 'film', 'Popular', ""1970's-1980"", 'actress', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'Evil-Lyn', 'also', 'air', 'sinister', 'dignity', 'film', 'Evil-Lyn', 'always', 'anxious', 'do', 'Skeletor', 'bidding', 'Skeletor', 'craving', 'absolute', 'power', 'equally', 'anxious', 'have', 'He-Man', 'slave', 'interesting', 'homoerotic', 'subtext', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'little', 'kids', 'will', 'never', 'notice', 'when', 'action', 'back', 'Eternia', 'climax', 'Skeletor', 'obvious', 'delight', 'having', 'even', 'more', 'almost', 'naked', 'He-Man', 'whipped', 'down', 'knees', 'him.Director', 'Gary', 'Goddard', 'surprisingly', 'lively', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Goddard', 'detail', 'difficulties', 'compromises', 'involved', 'shooting', 'supposedly', '17', 'Million', 'fantasy', 'film', 'tight', 'schedule', 'increasingly', 'tighter', 'financial', 'budget', 'movie', 'mostly', 'place', 'night', 'because', 'Goddard', 'He-Man', 'Gwildor', 'Skeletor', 'Evil-Lyn', 'characters', 'Eternia', 'would', 'look', 'ridculous', 'parading', 'down', 'California', 'streets', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Skeltor', 'surprise', 'closing', 'hints', 'planned', 'sequel', 'was', 'never', 'filmed']",N/A

Although it's the perfect example of low-budget sci-fi goofiness, it does hold a certain level of charm for lovers of the Mattel toy line. You have to give director Gary Goddard credit for doing what he could with the money he was given to work with. What can you do when there's not enough cash to throw at fantastical otherworldly sets? You take the fantasy characters and put them on Earth in practical locales that don't cost as much money to build. That's what we get with ""Masters of the Universe.""He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) and his band of warriors are accidentally transported to Earth by a powerful key which will give Skeletor (Frank Langella) the ultimate power to rule Eternia. Skeletor sends his evil henchmen and army to find the key before He-Man does. Things get more complicated when the key is found by two teenagers (Courteney Cox and Robert Duncan McNeill) who think it's a musical instrument. They soon find themselves in the middle of a universal battle between good and evil.The high-definition transfer of ""Masters of the Universe"" cleans the film up and guarantees an easier viewing experience on Blu-ray. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything for the limited special effects used. They don't look too bad, but ""Star Wars"" this isn't. A clearer picture also makes the less-than-stellar makeup, prosthetics, and costumes used more evident.Warner Bros. Home Entertainment cut corners when it comes to the audio presentation for this 25th Anniversary Blu-ray edition. They didn't even give the movie a proper 5.1 surround sound upgrade. Instead we're left with a 2.0 stereo mix which sounds fine but doesn't deliver the same sort of dynamics fans with home theaters are going to want when looking to trade in their old DVD or VHS copies of the movie for the newest format.He-Man enthusiasts aren't going to be very happy with the special features included. There's rather interesting audio commentary by director Gary Goddard and a theatrical trailer. That's all you get with this edition. Where's a making of featurette or any sort of reflection by the cast or crew about the production of the film? Surely a few of the filmmakers and cast members from the film would sit down with an interviewer and talk about the experience.The 25th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition of ""Masters of the Universe"" gives consumers the best visual version of the film ever seen but drops the ball when it comes to the audio. A lack of more special features also depreciates the release. If you're intent on converting your home entertainment library to Blu-ray this is your only hope. If you already have it on DVD and aren't too concerned about picture quality, this probably isn't going to convince anyone to buy it again.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""Masters of the Universe""",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,2879,"['being', 'epic', 'failure', 'eyes', 'Cannon', 'Films', 'live-action', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'movie', 'built', 'cult', 'following', 'past', '25', 'years', 'perfect', 'example', 'low-budget', 'sci-fi', 'goofiness', 'hold', 'certain', 'level', 'charm', 'lovers', 'Mattel', 'toy', 'line', 'have', 'give', 'director', 'Gary', 'Goddard', 'credit', 'doing', 'what', 'could', 'money', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'not', 'enough', 'cash', 'throw', 'fantastical', 'otherworldly', 'sets', 'take', 'fantasy', 'characters', 'put', 'Earth', 'practical', 'locales', 'do', ""n't"", 'cost', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'build', 'what', 'get', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'He-Man', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'band', 'warriors', 'are', 'accidentally', 'transported', 'Earth', 'powerful', 'key', 'will', 'give', 'Skeletor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'ultimate', 'power', 'rule', 'Eternia', 'Skeletor', 'evil', 'henchmen', 'army', 'find', 'key', 'He-Man', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'key', 'found', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'who', 'think', 'musical', 'instrument', 'soon', 'find', 'middle', 'universal', 'battle', 'good', 'evil.The', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'film', 'up', 'easier', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Blu-ray', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'limited', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'bad', 'Star', 'Wars', ""n't"", 'clearer', 'picture', 'also', 'less-than-stellar', 'makeup', 'prosthetics', 'costumes', 'used', 'more', 'evident.Warner', 'Bros.', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'cut', 'corners', 'when', 'audio', 'presentation', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'movie', 'proper', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'upgrade', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'left', '2.0', 'stereo', 'mix', 'fine', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'same', 'sort', 'dynamics', 'fans', 'home', 'theaters', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'when', 'looking', 'trade', 'old', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'copies', 'movie', 'newest', 'format.He-Man', 'enthusiasts', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'rather', 'interesting', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Gary', 'Goddard', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'get', 'edition', 'Where', 'making', 'featurette', 'sort', 'reflection', 'cast', 'crew', 'production', 'film', 'Surely', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'cast', 'members', 'film', 'would', 'sit', 'down', 'interviewer', 'talk', 'experience.The', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray', 'Edition', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'consumers', 'best', 'visual', 'version', 'film', 'ever', 'seen', 'ball', 'when', 'audio', 'lack', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'also', 'release', ""'re"", 'intent', 'converting', 'home', 'entertainment', 'library', 'Blu-ray', 'only', 'hope', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'concerned', 'picture', 'quality', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'convince', 'anyone', 'buy', 'again']",N/A

Filmation's contributions to the toyline (Orko, Prince Adam, King Randor, Cringer, and Queen Marlena) are gone for obvious reasons, and the new characters are even less inspiring than what Mattel was coming up with for He-Man and She-Ra. While the producers could have still done the Barbarian He-Man treatment, they obviously went for the quick and dirty ""Star Wars ripoff"" route that has doomed tons of movies before and since.The plot (such as it is) is completely destroyed by the super-cheap shift to Earth (specifically Southern California, no less), and downright poor acting.

While on Earth they team up with two teenagers, Julie (Courtney Cox), who has recently lost her parents in a plane crash, and her boyfriend, aspiring musician Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill).I saw this film for the first time when I was about 6 and it was on in cinemas. At that time I religiously watched the He-Man cartoon series and had a collection of He-Man action figures, and thought the film was pretty cool, although, I remember being disappointed by the omission of many of the characters from the cartoon series, including He-Man's pet tiger, and it annoyed me that Skeletor didn't really look like his animated counterpart. Over 20 years later, I purchased this film on DVD just to see if I liked it as much as I did when I was a kid, and I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it wasn't anywhere near as terrible as I expected it to be.For kids who grew up watching well written, big-budget adventure films such as ""The Mummy"", this film might seem a bit lame, but given the fact that it does have a relatively low budget and a cast essentially comprised of B-list (and C-list) actors, it makes the best of what it has. The writing's not great, but it's a fun film and the action scenes are pretty good. Not to mention the fact that it is interesting to see Courtney Cox as a ""teenager"" (although she was in her twenties when this film was made) and the whole idea of He-Man wearing little more than his underwear and a cape had me laughing for long after the film was over. Another advantage of this film is that it has PG rating, something that is very rare now days. There is very little in this film that could possibly offend, but it is also exciting and interesting enough so that parents won't fall asleep if watching it with their children. It's sort of like a kiddie Conan with a Dr Who budget.Overall, ""Masters of the Universe"" has held up pretty well over the years, and should be enjoyed by both the children of the 21st century and nostalgic twenty-somethings.",3,Kiddie Conan with a Dr Who budget,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,2351,"['He-Man', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'friends', 'Duncan', 'Jon', 'Cypher', 'Teela', 'Chelsea', 'Field', 'supposedly', 'comical', 'gnome-like', 'creature', 'must', 'travel', 'alternative', 'universe', 'Eternia', 'Earth', 'order', 'find', 'cosmic', 'key', 'multi-dimensional', 'skeleton', 'key', 'will', 'allow', 'rescue', 'Sorceress', 'evil', 'Skeletor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'save', 'Eternia', 'Earth', 'team', 'up', 'two', 'teenagers', 'Julie', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'parents', 'plane', 'crash', 'boyfriend', 'aspiring', 'musician', 'Kevin', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', '.I', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'about', '6', 'was', 'cinemas', 'time', 'religiously', 'watched', 'He-Man', 'cartoon', 'series', 'had', 'collection', 'He-Man', 'action', 'figures', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'remember', 'being', 'disappointed', 'omission', 'many', 'characters', 'cartoon', 'series', 'including', 'He-Man', 'pet', 'tiger', 'annoyed', 'Skeletor', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'animated', 'counterpart', '20', 'years', 'later', 'purchased', 'film', 'DVD', 'just', 'see', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'as', 'terrible', 'expected', 'be.For', 'kids', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'well', 'written', 'big-budget', 'adventure', 'films', 'such', 'Mummy', 'film', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'lame', 'given', 'fact', 'have', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'cast', 'essentially', 'comprised', 'B-list', 'C-list', 'actors', 'best', 'what', 'writing', 'not', 'great', 'fun', 'film', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'interesting', 'see', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'teenager', 'was', 'twenties', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'whole', 'idea', 'He-Man', 'wearing', 'little', 'more', 'underwear', 'cape', 'had', 'laughing', 'long', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'advantage', 'film', 'PG', 'rating', 'something', 'very', 'rare', 'now', 'days', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'possibly', 'offend', 'also', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'enough', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', 'watching', 'children', 'sort', 'kiddie', 'Conan', 'Dr', 'Who', 'budget.Overall', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'held', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'years', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'children', '21st', 'century', 'nostalgic', 'twenty-somethings']",N/A

There is a perfunctory commentary track from director Gary Goddard and a well preserved theatrical trailer and that is it. The lack of extensive extra material might be excusable if this was a first rate high def transfer but unfortunately it never manages to look very good.  I suspect this is the same transfer used for the previous DVD release.  The colors are bright and well saturated but there is an enormous amount of grain and noise throughout the film (and not just in the effects shots where you might expect it) and there is a fair amount of wobble and instability in the print.  They have not even bothered to put art on the disc itself, just plain black (a more and more frequent occurence with major studio releases).  The disc comes in a thin, ultra cheap eco case.  Warner did nothing special whatsoever for this disapointing ""25th Anniversary"" edition and if you already have the DVD you might want to save your money.  This disc IS a bit of an improvement but it is definitely not the dream edition fans of the film have probably been hoping for.  They didn't even bother with a 5.1 mix for the soundtrack.  You get stereo and thats it.  It seems the major studios have lost all interest in putting out quality editions of catalog titles on bluray disc.  This one is about as ho hum as they get.  A great fun film, with a cult following deserved better treatment than this for its (barely) high def debut.  At least the retail price is cheap.

Both the toyline and the series are more fun than this dull mess.  Practically the only redeeming feature of this film is a powerful performance by Frank Langella(""Frost/Nixon"") as the villain Skeletor.Dolph Lundgren is suitably musclebound as He-Man, but it is a part which does require more overall acting ability than Mr. Lundgren shows here, and the scripts for the animated series are more intriguing than the story for this movie.  Involving an interplanetary key, an appropriate amount of heroes and villains, and two Earth kids the movie's screenplay is nothing we haven't seen before and gets old quickly.Also featuring Meg Foster in the movie's other best performance as Evil-Lyn, Billy Barty, and a young Courtney Cox, ""Masters of the Universe"" just isn't very good.

338389,A1ASXZQL80PX28,6302815673,"James Mason ""IrishWriter34""","[7, 8]","This was the premise of a classic toy line and the classic cartoon that emerged from it: When the planet Eternia-think a futuristic Camelot-comes under attack by the demon sorcerer Skeletor in an attempt to abscond with the mythical Castle Grayskull and thus conquer the universe, Prince Adam, teenage son of Eternia's King Randor and Queen Marlena, discovers that he has been chosen by destiny to bear Grayskull's power against all who would threaten Eternia's safety. By raising the enchanted Sword of Grayskull aloft and shouting ""By the Power of Grayskull,"" Adam is transformed into the superheroic swashbuckler He-Man, and proceeds to do battle with Skeletor...and to try and prove himself to his demanding father.From that premise, Filmation created a terrific cartoon that, even though it had its share of `80s cheese, was rich and complex, deftly mixing Arthurian legend with sci-fi. At its essence, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE was a coming-of-age story set against a high-tech sword and sorcery backdrop. As such, it had the makings of a great movie. Unfortunately, the low-budget Golan-Globus team (which destroyed SUPERMAN IV) got their hands on it, and we the viewers got cheated. The essence of MOTU was trashed; the Adam/He-Man duality and everything it entailed was tossed away. Several critical characters, like Randor, Marlena, Cringer/Battle Cat (Adam's pet tiger), and the like were ignored. And finally, 90% of the character and set designs immortalized by the toys and cartoon were changed as to be unrecognizable. Only Man-At-Arms, Skeletor, and Skeletor's lover/servant Evil-Lyn emerged on film as being visually recognizable as their cartoon counterparts.So what did we get in return? We got a shameless, low-budget STAR WARS rip-off. Instead of the myriad beasts, demons, and cyborgs that Skeletor employed in the cartoon/toy line, we got three beasts and a bunch of armored stormtroopers. Instead of getting a He-Man who captured the feel of the character, we got a wooden Conan wannabe who relied more on laser guns than on his sword. Instead of a story that spanned Eternia and carried the appropriate sci-fi/fantasy feel of the series, we got a story that took place primarily on Earth, complete with a crabby cop and two ditzy teens. Instead of having a skilled, experienced director at the helm, we got unsteady, pedestrian direction from novice filmmaker Gary Goddard (whose day job was designing amusement parks). Sure, we got some excellent FX work, a great Bill Conti score, and a terrific Castle Grayskull throne room set, but we also got bad costumes, a stupid Grayskull exterior that looks like a pirate ship, a plotless script that's all noise and no depth, substandard fight choreography, and really bad acting. Only Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher), Skeletor (Frank Langella), and Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) are well-acted in this film; Langella's theatrical performance in particular is the film's saving grace, and deserved to be in a much better movie. Otherwise everyone else in the cast stinks. Dolph Lundgren is a perfect physical match for He-Man, but the guy can't act and his awkward Swedish accent has been the butt of fan jokes for years. Everyone else is just too vapid, too bland, and just too unsuited for the roles to be any good. This film needed to be a big-budget affair with top-rate actors and a script that followed the cartoon closely, not a STAR WARS wannabe that fails on most levels. THE BEASTMASTER with Marc Singer was far closer to the spirit of MOTU than this film (and Singer's Dar looked and acted far more like He-Man than Lundgren's hero did), and is a vastly superior movie. Pretty sad that the actual MOTU movie didn't even come close to matching that level, isn't it?To be fair, I initially saw this film when I was 9 and enjoyed it, but over time I realized how weak it really was, and how it could have been so much more. While I don't HATE the film, I don't like it too much, either, and it hasn't aged well. This summer, Mattel will relaunch MOTU with a brand-new cartoon series and toy line that retells the story of Prince Adam/He-Man from the beginning. Hopefully, if Hollywood decides to make another go at a He-Man movie, they'll use the cartoon as the baseline and get it right this time. As it stands, the 1987 film is an OK way to kill a few hours, but as a He-Man film and as a fantasy film, it just doesn't cut it.",2,"Oh, what might have been....",1018310400,"04 9, 2002",2002,4388,"['was', 'premise', 'classic', 'toy', 'line', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'emerged', 'When', 'planet', 'Eternia-think', 'futuristic', 'Camelot-comes', 'attack', 'demon', 'sorcerer', 'Skeletor', 'attempt', 'abscond', 'mythical', 'Castle', 'Grayskull', 'thus', 'conquer', 'universe', 'Prince', 'Adam', 'teenage', 'son', 'Eternia', 'King', 'Randor', 'Queen', 'Marlena', 'been', 'chosen', 'destiny', 'bear', 'Grayskull', 'power', 'who', 'would', 'threaten', 'Eternia', 'safety', 'raising', 'enchanted', 'Sword', 'Grayskull', 'aloft', 'shouting', 'Power', 'Grayskull', 'Adam', 'transformed', 'superheroic', 'swashbuckler', 'He-Man', 'proceeds', 'do', 'battle', 'Skeletor', 'try', 'prove', 'demanding', 'father.From', 'premise', 'Filmation', 'created', 'terrific', 'cartoon', 'even', 'had', 'share', '80s', 'cheese', 'was', 'rich', 'complex', 'deftly', 'mixing', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'sci-fi', 'essence', 'MASTERS', 'THE', 'UNIVERSE', 'was', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'set', 'high-tech', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'backdrop', 'such', 'had', 'makings', 'great', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'low-budget', 'Golan-Globus', 'team', 'destroyed', 'SUPERMAN', 'IV', 'got', 'hands', 'viewers', 'got', 'cheated', 'essence', 'MOTU', 'was', 'trashed', 'Adam/He-Man', 'duality', 'everything', 'entailed', 'was', 'tossed', 'away', 'Several', 'critical', 'characters', 'Randor', 'Marlena', 'Cringer/Battle', 'Cat', 'Adam', 'pet', 'tiger', 'like', 'were', 'ignored', 'finally', '90', '%', 'character', 'set', 'designs', 'immortalized', 'toys', 'cartoon', 'were', 'changed', 'be', 'unrecognizable', 'Only', 'Man-At-Arms', 'Skeletor', 'Skeletor', 'lover/servant', 'Evil-Lyn', 'emerged', 'film', 'being', 'visually', 'recognizable', 'cartoon', 'counterparts.So', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'return', 'got', 'shameless', 'low-budget', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'rip-off', 'Instead', 'myriad', 'beasts', 'demons', 'Skeletor', 'employed', 'cartoon/toy', 'line', 'got', 'three', 'beasts', 'bunch', 'armored', 'stormtroopers', 'Instead', 'getting', 'He-Man', 'who', 'captured', 'feel', 'character', 'got', 'wooden', 'Conan', 'wannabe', 'who', 'relied', 'more', 'laser', 'guns', 'sword', 'Instead', 'story', 'spanned', 'Eternia', 'carried', 'appropriate', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'feel', 'series', 'got', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'primarily', 'Earth', 'complete', 'crabby', 'cop', 'two', 'ditzy', 'teens', 'Instead', 'having', 'skilled', 'experienced', 'director', 'helm', 'got', 'unsteady', 'pedestrian', 'direction', 'novice', 'filmmaker', 'Gary', 'Goddard', 'day', 'job', 'was', 'designing', 'amusement', 'parks', 'Sure', 'got', 'excellent', 'FX', 'work', 'great', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'score', 'terrific', 'Castle', 'Grayskull', 'throne', 'room', 'set', 'also', 'got', 'bad', 'costumes', 'stupid', 'Grayskull', 'exterior', 'pirate', 'ship', 'plotless', 'script', 'noise', 'depth', 'substandard', 'fight', 'choreography', 'really', 'bad', 'acting', 'Only', 'Man-At-Arms', 'Jon', 'Cypher', 'Skeletor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Evil-Lyn', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'are', 'well-acted', 'film', 'Langella', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'particular', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'deserved', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'stinks', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'perfect', 'physical', 'match', 'He-Man', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'awkward', 'Swedish', 'accent', 'been', 'butt', 'fan', 'jokes', 'years', 'Everyone', 'else', 'just', 'too', 'vapid', 'too', 'bland', 'just', 'too', 'unsuited', 'roles', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'big-budget', 'affair', 'top-rate', 'actors', 'script', 'followed', 'cartoon', 'closely', 'not', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'fails', 'most', 'levels', 'BEASTMASTER', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'was', 'far', 'closer', 'spirit', 'MOTU', 'film', 'Singer', 'Dar', 'looked', 'acted', 'far', 'more', 'He-Man', 'Lundgren', 'hero', 'did', 'vastly', 'superior', 'movie', 'Pretty', 'sad', 'actual', 'MOTU', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'level', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'initially', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', '9', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'realized', 'how', 'weak', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'HATE', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'either', ""n't"", 'aged', 'well', 'summer', 'Mattel', 'will', 'relaunch', 'MOTU', 'brand-new', 'cartoon', 'series', 'toy', 'line', 'story', 'Prince', 'Adam/He-Man', 'beginning', 'Hopefully', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'go', 'He-Man', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'use', 'cartoon', 'baseline', 'get', 'right', 'time', '1987', 'film', 'OK', 'way', 'kill', 'few', 'hours', 'He-Man', 'film', 'fantasy', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut']",N/A

(he-man/gi-joe/thundercats/silverhawks/transformers/go-bots)they just don't mske cartoons like they used to and most of todays cartoons are junk compaied to those i grew up with! the funny thing is...they are still making crappy movies based on either cartoons/t.v.shows/comics/video games still. of course back in 1987 i was one of the many who went to see this in the theater (the same theater i saw jedi/e.t. and tons of other classics in...which sadly is no longer there!)i recall being picked up from my grandmothers after school and all day i was imitating this new guy called blade from the movie! back then this movie was amazing and still is entertaining but now i realize that it's not what i grew up on! sure it's a good sc-fi fantasy movie but it's only connection to the cartoons/action figures (which came before the cartoon)was the names of the beloved charcters! the best part now is how amazing skeletor is/was in this film! creepy and a movie stealer was frank langella! but of coure there were tons of flaws! he-man didn't look like that in the cartoon and he didn't carry a laser gun or look like arnold in red sonja or conan, man-at arms costume was totally off,teela looked like she was wearing some workout gear from the future, beast man looked cool and scary wasn't like a wearwolf in the cartoon and was clumsy and funny,evil lynn had the attitude down but not the costume,the sorceress was wrong as was eternia and greyskull! of course they went for a star wars thing (the box says the star wars of the 80's)and they totally screwed up! i do recall asking my mom where orko/mer-man/trap jaw/battle cat was but she couldn't tell me! just imagine if they made it today and with all the internet rumors around you found out battle cat wouldn't be in it or orko wouldn't be either! this movie wouldn't make any money at all! taking battle cat out of it is just like taking professer x out of a x-men movie! some of the battle scenes were great as was the make-up but the story wasn't masters of the the universe and the charcters weren't really either! the new charcters were awful except for blade/surrod (i misspelled that!)gwildor and krag were dumb and not needed (krag didn't even get his own action figure and he was the only new one without a figure!)it's amazing that they got away with this film but who would be mad? i mean the audience were kids mainly under 14 and they wouldn't throw a fit really about it until they were old enough to understand that they were screwed out of a good he-man movie! just imagine if they re-did this right and had all the old charcters in it! imagine a live action movie with mer-man,orko,battle cat etc.! of course he-man is now making a comeback in a way with the re-relase of the 1st line of action figure replicas for $11.99 (which are great!)and the release of the he-ro:son of he-man bible (a cartoon series that was created and never aired-there is a link from the he-man.org site with pictures/story from the series that are amazing! i'd really love to know the masters creator thoughts on this film and why it was made like this without the main cast of charcters we grew up with! of course when this film came out he-man was gone from the airwaves so i was kinda wondering back then why it was made and was curious if they were bringing he-man back (which they did with a crappy line of toys called he-man with he-man and skeletor being the only original charcters left!)for the real he-man movie that hit theaters check out he-man and she-ra:the secret of the sword (which hopefully will get re-released along with the old cartoons on dvd/video-hey transformers,gi-joe are on dvd so why not he-man?)he-man was a huge part of my life and i'm glad some interest in masters is coming

338398,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,6302815673,jude pepper,"[2, 3]","no question about it, the film suffers from weaknesses. three, to be precise...1: BAD TIMING. the film came along well after the popularity of the toy line and cartoon series had peaked. they hadn't even made any new episodes of the cartoon for a couple of years. so it would inevitably be comparable, at least on one level, to one of those '60s sitcom cast reunion telefilms that were in vogue in the '80s.(this much is mercifully easy to overlook in this day and age. it does seem to be one of those films which needed a couple of decades to build up some steam.)2: LIMITED BUDGET. i daresay i need say no more here than that the distributor was Cannon, a company a few years away from going conspicuously belly-up. Cannon Films might almost be called the Edsel of film production companies.3: LIMITED FAITHFULNESS TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL. it takes liberties, to say the least. the most surreal difference is that He-Man is He-Man the whole picture through, with no sight or even mention of his established Prince Adam secret identity. according to director Gary Goddard, the most heated criticism he gets from the die-hard fans is that he didn't use a character called Orko, and that the character of Gwildor, who was clearly designed to serve a similar function within the ""company,"" is a rather lackadaisical substitute.but of course, it does have to be kept in mind that film technology could not yet replicate exactly a given cartoon's zeitgeist. so they had to create anothere version of this world - a parallel universe, if you will - which would be compatible with what the cinematic process was capable of at the time. in other words, Orko was ""unfimable,"" and modifications had to be made. to this end they managed, against most of the odds, to fashion an engaging (if admittedly unexceptional) ""popcorn"" movie experience. the story may be off the rack, but the cast and crew know how to wear it.in the proverbial nutshell, you should compare it not with the recent films of Spider-Man, Iron Man, etc., so much as with the '50s tv series starring George Reeves as Superman. they too were prevented by the limitations of The Real World from replicating the feel of the comic book, and too a much greater extent. but what both productions could do was concentrate on the characters. you'll notice that George Reeves and Company have developed a cult following despite the fact that their adventures don't exactly mirror the originals' comic book exploits. that's because the series was faithful to the feel of the characters, and that more than made up for the sort of fantasy spectacle they were simply unable to attain.indeed, if nothing else, the film is noteworthy for the chemistry of it's excellent cast. like every good villain, Frank Langella's Skeletor and Meg Foster's Evil-Lyn steal every scene they inhabit. Courtney Cox may not be bragging about her involvement lately, but she did manage to launch an impressive career from here, so she must've done something right. James Tolken brings his tried-and-true hard-ass authority figure shtick to the character of a hapless police officer. and that's before we even mentioned that names like Billy Barty, Chelsea Field, Jon Cypher, and Christina Pickles fill out the credits. oh yes, and the MY THREE SONS fan in me just can't let this review pass without mentioning that Barry ""Ernie"" Livingston gives an oft overlooked but delightfully quirkly performance.and yes, Dolph Lundgren is as close to the living embodiment of He-Man as any flesh-and-blood person could ever get. i grant you he's not exactly an Olivier-calibre actor, but then He-Man isn't exactly an Olivier-calibre part, either.the bottom line is that it was an imperfect product of which they did indeed manage to make the best. one of the few favorable critics dubbed it ""Star Wars of the '80s."" that's going a bit overboard, but it does fit in quite nicely with films like KRULL, LOGAN'S RUN, THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8TH DIMENSION, FORBIDDEN PLANET, THE ICE PIRATES. you can say MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE is straight off the assembly line, but it was a smoothly functional assembly line that particular day.",4,By

So, they finally put this on DVD huh? I was wondering if they would ever do that, infact I was somewhat in doubt. Anyway, I used to watch the cartoon all the time and I remember how excited I was when I found out there was going to be a movie. Yes, my fellow reviewer is correct, He-Man's faithful pet and sidekick Cringer/Battle-Cat was absent from this movie. If only we had the technology we have today back then. Then He-Man could have graced the big screen with a CGI Battle-Cat, much like Azlan the lion in the new version of Narnia. I think Dolph Lundgren was the perfect choice for the role of He-Man, he looks just like our favorite barbarian right down to the chiseled face, long blonde hair and of course huge pectoral muscles. Why can't I have a body like that? Skeletor on the other hand was alot scarier in the movie than on TV. A fleshless face that actually looks like real bone, a big black Emperor Palpatine like cloak, and a deeper voice make him seem more like the Grimm Reaper compared to his hokier cartoon counter part. And instead of Orko, the little floaty wizard guy, they had a short Yoda like scientist named Gwindor who created the so called ""Cosmic Key"", which held...well, the key to cosmic power. You may have also noticed that most of the movie took place on Earth. That's because the movie's budget couldn't allow too much of it to take place on He-Man's war torn home world of Eternia. In fact they didn't even show the exterior of Castle Grayskull, only the tunnels underneath it. The Masters Of The Universe movie is not entirely based on the series but it's good for nostalgia and reliving your childhood if you grew up with the show. It's worth at least one look. (Update 1/17/08) I made a mistake, they did show the outside of Grayskull (which is pretty crazy looking by the way), in the movie as well as some of the landscape of Eternia, and we never saw the inside of the caves beneath the castle. Looks like I did it backwards, sorry about that. I finally got my copy of the DVD and am enjoying it thus far, a pretty good action based movie as well as a jump back in time. Also, the picture and sound transfer is awsome and Frank Langella's portrail of Skeletor still gives me shivers twenty years later.

Unlike most nostalgic impulse buys, this one was rather unfulfilling. It was nice to see it on DVD quality, given, but overall story and script  leave less to be desired. But who REALLY is watching this to consider if it was snubbed from the academy awards 20 some odd years ago. For now, it does what it can do best which is remind us of a time when movie technology was only so advanced, but all of us 7 year old boys ate it up. If you are a HE-MAN affecianado this is a definite buy. Courtney Cox fans may want to watch to see her scream in the movie...just the way she does seems to pay homage in some part to Horror  and Thriller movies of the last 40 years. If you want to see the small vestiges of GOOD acting, pay attention to Frank Langella's politically minded and diabolical portrayal of Skeletor. While other actors in the film have a difficult time acting themselves out of a hat, the likes of Langella and surprisingly, Dolph Lundgren, are worth the few dollars trip down memory lane. For all to TREK fans you get an early look at Robert Duncan McNeil pre-next gen and, most importantly, pre-voyager. You will notice that not much changed in his ability in the 7 years between this movie and Voyager's beginnings. Overall the movie is, as I have said, good for nostalgic purposes only, anything more, and I doubt viewers will be as forgiving when it comes to obvious flaws in production and shots.

Almost anyone who lived through the 80's heard something about ""He-Man"" and ""Skeletor""... and likely heard the phrase ""I have the powwwweeeer!"". That's Masters of the Universe for those not in the know.This is the motion picture version of the franchise that brought us a hot selling line of toys, a hit cartoon series, and practically invented the modern notion of using a series franchise to sell toys and other offshot products. ""Masters of the Universe has a simple enough plot. The Evil Skeletor has used a device called the cosmic key to teleport his forces into, and subsequenlty capture Castle Greyskull - and the vast cosmic powers which it somehow holds (why it has this sort of significance is unexplained). his arch enemy, the heroic He-man, has been teleported with his friends to the far off world of earth during the fighting and Skeletors forces now pursue them to capture the key and seal once and for all, skeletors place as supreme ruler of the land of Eternia.But this is not a movie you will watch for the story of course. Even those who were fans of He-man may be dismayed to know that the movie doesnt hold firm AT ALL to the sorce material. Heman's famous tiger is missing. And his powerful sword is just a sword in the movie. Much of it indeed was thrown together and altered. You'll see bits and pieces of everything that was sucessful in 80's cinema throughout this movie. Many times it feels like you're watching a really bad version of Star Wars. Skeletor is made to resebmle the emperor from that more sucsessful franchise, and anyone who doesnt think gwildor looks like yoda is kidding themselves. The end scene of the movie practically mirrors the end of Return of the Jedi! Skeletor shooting lighting from his fingers telling heman to kneel, and finally being tossed down some sort of shaft to a firey demise... Im surprised the dont get sued! Not to mention the hover boards are certainly inspired from back to the future 2!No you wont be intellectually or emotionally involved. What you WILL watch this movie for, is 1) Nastalgia, and 2) fun. The movie is full of fairly effective comedy and decent action. As far as cheesy 80's movies I loved as a kid go, this one doesnt make me ask myself how stupid I must have been to enjoyed it. The acting is also quite decent, although lundrin is no oscar winner. The character of Skeletor is given a very powerful voice and performance for a movie of this type (which was obviously aimed at young teen boys).of course the problem is you cant take this movie serious... any movie with charcters named ""he-man"" and ""man-at-arms"" and has bad costumed man-creatures running around wearing plastic looking armor and fake looking weapons is bound to have problems keeping an adult audience from chuckling. This is compounded by the fact that Lundrin, while he at times puts forth a noble effort, cant deliver a very effective presence in a lead role. Not to mention everything seems a lot sillier when seen in the context of a subburban USA battleground.But if you can let go of that and just watch this movie with a light heart for fun and for nostalgia, you'll probably enjoy it and find it to be a lot of fun and find a basic tale of good and evil, action, comedy and a half-way-decent attempt to make it a sort of ""almost epic"".",4,Dolph Lundrin Has the Power?,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,3368,"['Masters', 'Universe', 'sort', 'lost', 'classic', '80', 'Almost', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', '80', 'heard', 'something', 'He-Man', 'Skeletor', 'likely', 'heard', 'phrase', 'have', 'powwwweeeer', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'not', 'know.This', 'motion', 'picture', 'version', 'franchise', 'brought', 'hot', 'selling', 'line', 'toys', 'hit', 'cartoon', 'series', 'practically', 'invented', 'modern', 'notion', 'using', 'series', 'franchise', 'sell', 'toys', 'other', 'offshot', 'products', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'simple', 'enough', 'plot', 'Evil', 'Skeletor', 'used', 'device', 'called', 'cosmic', 'key', 'teleport', 'forces', 'subsequenlty', 'capture', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'vast', 'cosmic', 'powers', 'why', 'sort', 'significance', 'unexplained', 'arch', 'enemy', 'heroic', 'He-man', 'been', 'teleported', 'friends', 'far', 'world', 'earth', 'fighting', 'Skeletors', 'forces', 'now', 'pursue', 'capture', 'key', 'seal', 'once', 'skeletors', 'place', 'supreme', 'ruler', 'land', 'Eternia.But', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'story', 'course', 'Even', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'He-man', 'may', 'be', 'dismayed', 'know', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'hold', 'firm', 'AT', 'ALL', 'sorce', 'material', 'Heman', 'famous', 'tiger', 'missing', 'powerful', 'sword', 'just', 'sword', 'movie', 'Much', 'indeed', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'altered', ""'ll"", 'see', 'bits', 'pieces', 'everything', 'was', 'sucessful', '80', 'cinema', 'movie', 'Many', 'times', ""'re"", 'watching', 'really', 'bad', 'version', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Skeletor', 'made', 'resebmle', 'emperor', 'more', 'sucsessful', 'franchise', 'anyone', 'who', 'think', 'gwildor', 'looks', 'yoda', 'kidding', 'end', 'scene', 'movie', 'practically', 'end', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'Skeletor', 'shooting', 'lighting', 'fingers', 'telling', 'heman', 'kneel', 'finally', 'being', 'tossed', 'down', 'sort', 'shaft', 'firey', 'demise', 'Im', 'surprised', 'dont', 'get', 'sued', 'Not', 'mention', 'hover', 'boards', 'are', 'certainly', 'inspired', 'back', 'future', '2', 'No', 'wont', 'be', 'intellectually', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'What', 'WILL', 'watch', 'movie', '1', 'Nastalgia', '2', 'fun', 'movie', 'full', 'fairly', 'effective', 'comedy', 'decent', 'action', 'As', 'far', 'cheesy', '80', 'movies', 'loved', 'kid', 'go', 'one', 'doesnt', 'make', 'ask', 'how', 'stupid', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'also', 'quite', 'decent', 'lundrin', 'oscar', 'winner', 'character', 'Skeletor', 'given', 'very', 'powerful', 'voice', 'performance', 'movie', 'type', 'was', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'young', 'teen', 'boys', '.of', 'course', 'problem', 'cant', 'take', 'movie', 'serious', 'movie', 'charcters', 'named', 'he-man', 'man-at-arms', 'bad', 'costumed', 'man-creatures', 'running', 'around', 'wearing', 'plastic', 'looking', 'armor', 'fake', 'looking', 'weapons', 'bound', 'have', 'problems', 'keeping', 'adult', 'audience', 'chuckling', 'compounded', 'fact', 'Lundrin', 'times', 'puts', 'forth', 'noble', 'effort', 'cant', 'deliver', 'very', 'effective', 'presence', 'lead', 'role', 'Not', 'mention', 'everything', 'lot', 'sillier', 'when', 'seen', 'context', 'subburban', 'USA', 'battleground.But', 'can', 'let', 'go', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'light', 'heart', 'fun', 'nostalgia', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'find', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'find', 'basic', 'tale', 'good', 'evil', 'action', 'comedy', 'half-way-decent', 'attempt', 'make', 'sort', 'almost', 'epic']",N/A
338410,A24H35U47VPA9P,6302815673,Lord Darkseid,"[0, 0]","As a huge fan of He-man and She-ra, I was disappointed with this movie. The big problem- the setting! It was a big mistake to go with Earth. Personally, I wanted to see how the people live on Eternia. We could have also seen interesting creatures and learned about a new world. Some might want to claim lack of technology, but there were plenty of special effects films made prior to the computer animation we know today. If Yoda could be brought to life back in the first trilogy from 1981 surely someone could have made a realistic Orko. But back on the subject of MOTU on earth, they could have also made a more interesting storyline if they insisted using Earth. He-man's mother, Queen Marlena, is FROM earth! The movie team obviously had no problem making this a more ADULT oriented film by adding more violence and drama, so they should have gone all the way and made it even more dramatic. It would have been interesting to see had Marlena been with the group how she'd react to being reunited with her old family on Earth. It would have been a nice sub-plot. Another thing I hated was the costumes. He-man with a cape? Yuck. And don't get me started on Teela's outfit. Then there's the introduction of new characters as opposed to using our favorite ones from the cartoon. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking there were leftover toys that Mattel needed to sell so they pushed for the film to use these new guys.Anyways, as a fan, I'll watch the movie sometimes when its on cable, but it was a disappointment then and its still a disappointment as an adult. The dialogue is cheesy and not in a good 80s way. The storyline lacks imagination, and one other thing to complain about...the laser guns! The people who made this film obviously didn't pay attention to the title--MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. There are good and evil warriors with specific skills and techniques they use for combat as any MOTU fan knows and for the characters to constantly use laser guns was just a slap in the face.

338413,AWZTPHA81PZDG,6302815673,MalachiX,"[1, 1]","Masters of the Universe really could have been a great film.  There are several points where the film comes quite close to being and immersive fantasy experiance.  Unfortunatly it falls short in so many areas that it can't be considered much more than a decent live-action version of the cartoon.The real problem with Masters of the Universe is that it can't make up it's mind whether it wants to be an interesting fantasy or set in the real world.  The film makes a stylish start with Skeletor kidnapping the Sorcoress and He-man going to rescue her.  The opening is nicely done and does a good job of creating a fanciful display of good vs. evil.  The film's climactic ending is equally well-done.  Unfortunatly, most of the middle of the film is spent in the &quot;real world&quot; with He-man and his friend trying to find a key.  Perhaps the writers thought that the film would do better if they had our heros team up with some typical 80s teen-agers.  Needless to say, they were terribly mistaken.The cast is a mixed bag.  Dolph Lundgren may look the part of He-man but that doesn't change the fact that he can't and never will be able to act.  Lundgren doesn't go so far as to embarass himself to the point of idiocy (which he has in many films) but he's certainly wooden and boring.  The rest of the cast is fairly bland as well.  The one bright spot is Frank Langella as Skeletor who arguably saves the whole cast.  Unlike the writers and the rest of the actors, Langella seems to understand this movie as a battle between good and evil and is a presence in the film.Still, Masters of the Universe is a disapointment.  Langella may be enough to save the cast but he's not enough to save the film.  A strong opening and climax are dilluted with an incredibly tedious middle.  It's worth watching but viewers looking for a fantasy or Sci-Fi epic should look elsewhere.",3,"Decent, but it could have been better.",1001030400,"09 21, 2001",2001,1875,"['Masters', 'Universe', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'points', 'where', 'film', 'quite', 'close', 'being', 'immersive', 'fantasy', 'experiance', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'areas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'much', 'more', 'decent', 'live-action', 'version', 'cartoon.The', 'real', 'problem', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'be', 'interesting', 'fantasy', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'stylish', 'start', 'Skeletor', 'kidnapping', 'Sorcoress', 'He-man', 'going', 'rescue', 'opening', 'nicely', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'fanciful', 'display', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'film', 'climactic', 'ending', 'equally', 'well-done', 'Unfortunatly', 'most', 'middle', 'film', 'spent', 'quot', 'real', 'world', 'quot', 'He-man', 'friend', 'trying', 'find', 'key', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'thought', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'had', 'heros', 'team', 'up', 'typical', '80s', 'teen-agers', 'Needless', 'say', 'were', 'terribly', 'mistaken.The', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'may', 'look', 'part', 'He-man', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'never', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'act', 'Lundgren', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'embarass', 'point', 'idiocy', 'many', 'films', 'certainly', 'wooden', 'boring', 'rest', 'cast', 'fairly', 'bland', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Skeletor', 'who', 'arguably', 'whole', 'cast', 'writers', 'rest', 'actors', 'Langella', 'understand', 'movie', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'presence', 'film.Still', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'disapointment', 'Langella', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'save', 'cast', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'strong', 'opening', 'climax', 'are', 'dilluted', 'incredibly', 'tedious', 'middle', 'worth', 'watching', 'viewers', 'looking', 'fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'epic', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere']",N/A

I did the see the movie when it premeried back in the 80's and have owned it on VHS for a long time. I was glad when I saw it on DVD two years ago and I'm so glad I own it.Masters of the Universe tells the story of He-Man. He-Man is the champion of Grayskull and it's up to him to stop Lord Skeletor and his armies from Snake Mountain from destroying the lands of Grayskull.Dolph Lundgren was the perfect He-Man. He wasn't the original choice as He-Man as Orion wanted the part to be played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. I'm glad Arnold didn't get the part because Dolph was so perfect. He looked like the cartoon He-Man. He had the hair, the swagger, and the build. Dolph has always been a great action actor. This is one of the better films he has ever made.Frank Langela is a perfect Skeletor. The make up and effects they used to make him look like Skeletor are fantastic. He has the swagger and personality that Skeletor protrayed in the cartoon and it's great to see it by a real person. It's a great sign of great acting.I liked Courtney Cox a lot in the film. It was like love at first sight for me. It was great seeing her become one of the biggest stars in Hollywood and it's awesome seeing her humbling start in a film like this. Julie is a great character for her and I can't think of anybody else I would have rather seen play the part.I like the score from Masters of the Universe a lot. It was done by Bill Conti and it is good enough to rival a John Williams score. The brass in the score is fantastic. I'm a trumpet player and as one I dream about playing something like that medley.The special effects in Masters of the Universe are great. They remind a lot of Star Wars. A lot of people have been critical about how much the blasters and stuff compare to Star Wars. To be a realist though why wouldn't you want to copy Star Wars one of the greatest special effect movies of all time. The ships and gateways and explosions are great in Masters of the Universe. If you like special effects it's definetly a movie for you.I love this film. It's one of my all-time favorite films. I loved it as a child and I love it as a 19 year old young adult. It's a great film. It has action, humor, special effects and a great story. It's a must see for all He-Man fans.

Not a single one of which I agree with. For one thing in this movie you will see a lot of ray guns.  Something you never would see in the cartoon. He-Man is not Star Wars.  Although they tried to make Masters of the Universe the movie more like  Star Wars then the actual cartoon. Seeing He-Man with his ray gun was  rather dissapointing. I found this film to be ok. OK acting. OK story. OK  effects. Although I do like how they did the Skeletor mask. Meg Foster is  very attractive as Evil-Lyn and Dolph Lundgren looks just like a real life  He-Man would look. This film stars a young Courtney Cox from TV's  &quot;Friends&quot; as the young girl the Masters must save.

Dolph Lundgren was a pretty good choice for He-Man, and Frank Langella as Skeletor couldn't have been better. The story begins when the evil Skeletor and his army on Snake Mountain defeat the army of Castle Grayskull, capturing the sorceress and taking POW's. The realm of Eternia now belongs to Skeletor! However, that is not enough. An odd little Dwarf named Gwildor has a powerful device called 'The Key' which is capable of inter-dimensional travel. When Skeletor vows to capture He-Man, Gwildor is sought out by Eternia's greatest heroes. He-Man, Duncan 'Man-at-Arms', and his daughter Teela go to Gwildor, who activates the key.Enter: Earth. With He-Man and his friends now on Earth, they enlist the help of a young girl(Courteney Cox) who lost her parents in a plane crash, who along with her boyfriend get into their own fair share of trouble with the forces of evil. But when skeletor becomes fed up with his warrior's failure to capture He-man,he invades, and all heck breaks loose, with a climactic battle scene in Skeletor's throne room!Ok...if it sounds cheesy, well....it is! But thats why it is such a great movie. It is funny, but at the same time very entertaining to watch. With recognizable bad-guys, whose costumes were recreated with incredible detail, and some rather good special effects, He-Man fans will probably enjoy it, even though it is quite different from the He-Man: And The Masters of the Universe storyline, as I mentioned earlier.Rip-offs of other movies become noticeable right away. You will see Star Wars similarities more often than anything else, and some Back to the Future similarities too. The ending is right out of Star Wars also, but nevertheless, is to be expected. Some of the lines are very memorable. As a movie that I loved as a kid, and now enjoy laughing about as an adult, my friends and I took great joy in picking some of the finer lines out of the movie. 'The sword of Greyskull....MINE!' says Skeletor at one point. And I don't care who you are, how old you are, whether you like the movie or not, but when He-Man holds up his sword and shouts 'I HAVE THE POWER!' you will jump out of your seat and cheer! The Soundtrack is suprisingly good and fits the movie quite well.All in all: A bad movie, but a bad movie that I grew up with and still love to this day. I give it 4 stars because it is one of my favorite movies, not because it is particularly good. If you want to see a cheesy action movie so you can laugh and have a good time, then get it! If you were a He-man fan as a kid and want it for sentimental value, then get it!

I'd always had this on VHS until a few years back when VHS was replaced by DVD, and I never bothered to get this movie on DVD until now.PLOT: Dolphy Lungren plays He-Man, a soldier for Castle Greyskull who fights for the Sorcerer on the side of good. But the evil Skeletor has taken over Greyskull and has the Sorcerer as his prisoner.He-man teams up with surviving good guys, Leela and whatever her fathers name is, and they rescue a small dwarf alienish guy named Gwildor who they find out is an inventor of the cosmic key. A device that can open a portal tp anywhere in the universe.They wind up trying to rescue the Sorcerer from Skeletor but find they must retreat or be defeated, they end up using the portal device to flee and find themselves on Earth.They run into Kevin and Julie (Cortney Cox, her first movie) who accidently find the cosmic key thinking it is a musical instrument but not knowing that when they use it, Skeletor and his army are hot on the trail looking to steal it back.Then the rest of the plot is trying to get the thing back, avoid Skeletors henchmen and get back home before Skeletor inherits the powers of Greyskull forever.Overall, when I look at this movie now, it seems pretty corny and lame in so much of it, but yet, fun at the same time. If I had not have grown up watching this, then I'm not sure what I would think of it today, but I enjoyed this as a kid, and still have a guilty pleasure to watch it today.The make up effects are pretty good, i'd say they had someone who was involved with Star Wars doing the effects to this. There not the best effects you have ever seen, but at the time, they where probably the best it could get.It really reminds me of Star Wars and cough.. Suburban Commando alot. Fans of those movies may get a kick out of this one. As long as your not a twit who keeps saying, ""oh those effects are so lame"" well, it was the 80's and the effects are not what you are supposed to pay every bit of attention to.I never really questioned this movie compared to the cartoon, so many reviews do, but I think i watched this more then I ever watched the cartoon, and when you think about it, how the heck could you pull off riding around on lions and a floating ghost back in the 80's anyway, it would have been way too expensive and looked lame anyway.The bonus features are not much, i'd have loved to see deleted scenes and whatever else could be dished up.

Skeletor picks up where he left off in the cartoon. He is looking to rule Eternia and possess Castle Greyskull. The hitch is that Skeletor is actually victorious in taking the Castle. The sorceress is taken prisioner and Skeletor demands He-man to surrender as well. Skeletor was able to take the scorceress by suprise with the help of a magical key that was created by Gwildor (Billy Barty). Gwildor was seduced by Evil-Lyn who can change into whatever she wants as she is an evil scorceress. He-man was able to intercept Gwildor and he agrees to help He-man to right what went wrong. Skeletor finds out that Gwildor has another key (""the little worm has another key"", said by Evil Lyn). He-man, Teila, Man-at-arms, and Gwildor try to rescue the Scorceress in Castle Greyskull until they get cornered. Gwildow activates the key and escape into the gate-----appearing on Earth.  He-man and the Eternians try to locate the key that left their possession in transit and save Eternia before the scorceress is drained of all her power. Skeletor would be victorious.On earth you meet Kevin who stumbles upon the key that the Eternians lost. Skeletor sends a ""pitifull quartet"", as he describes his soldiers (Beastman and other mercenaries). Will Kevin keep believing the key is nothing more than a keyboard full of musical tones? Will He-man and the Eternians be able to get back to their world and save the scorceress? Will Skeletor finally be victorious by taking over Eternia and  enslaving He-man?All of this equals great action and a pretty good storyline. The acting was great. Many critics slammed Frank Langella's performance as Skeletor but he made a terrific villian (remember Dracula 1979??). Meg Foster was as usual gorgeous yet dangerous. James Tolkan was pretty good as the comedic detective looking for Kevin (kevin called the police when Julie was missing). Detective Lubic didnt believe a word from Kevin until he meets up with He-man and the Eternians as well as Skeletors soldiers armed to the teeth. All in all this was a great movie that mixes action, sci-fi, and fantasy. It's not the blockbuster type but its a great cult classic for anyones DVD collection.",5,"""Good Journey""",1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,3042,"['grew', 'up', 'He-Man', 'cartoons', 'used', 'be', 'early', 'mornings', 'went', 'school', 'then', 'would', 'change', 'afternoons', 'even', 'use', 'have', 'action', 'figures', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'original', 'cartoon', 'He-man', 'Masters', 'Universe.In', 'movie', 'have', 'He-man', 'role', 'Adam', 'played', 'Dolph', 'Lungren', 'played', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'Rocky', '4', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'enchanting', 'deep', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Live', 'Evil-Lyn', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Dracula', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Skeletor', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'Friends', 'Scream', 'Julie', 'earthling', 'James', 'Tolken', 'Mr.', 'Strickland', 'Back', 'Future', 'police', 'detective', 'Eternians', 'tale', 'Julie', 'boyfriend', 'Kevin.The', 'movie', 'out', 'He-man', 'homeworld', 'Eternia', 'Skeletor', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'cartoon', 'looking', 'rule', 'Eternia', 'possess', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'hitch', 'Skeletor', 'actually', 'victorious', 'taking', 'Castle', 'sorceress', 'taken', 'prisioner', 'Skeletor', 'He-man', 'surrender', 'as', 'well', 'Skeletor', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'scorceress', 'suprise', 'help', 'magical', 'key', 'was', 'created', 'Gwildor', 'Billy', 'Barty', 'Gwildor', 'was', 'seduced', 'Evil-Lyn', 'who', 'can', 'change', 'evil', 'scorceress', 'He-man', 'was', 'able', 'intercept', 'Gwildor', 'help', 'He-man', 'right', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Skeletor', 'out', 'Gwildor', 'key', 'little', 'worm', 'key', 'said', 'Evil', 'Lyn', 'He-man', 'Teila', 'Man-at-arms', 'Gwildor', 'try', 'rescue', 'Scorceress', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'get', 'cornered', 'Gwildow', 'key', 'escape', 'gate', '-appearing', 'Earth', 'He-man', 'Eternians', 'try', 'locate', 'key', 'left', 'possession', 'transit', 'save', 'Eternia', 'scorceress', 'drained', 'power', 'Skeletor', 'would', 'be', 'victorious.On', 'earth', 'meet', 'Kevin', 'who', 'key', 'Eternians', 'lost', 'Skeletor', 'pitifull', 'quartet', 'soldiers', 'Beastman', 'other', 'mercenaries', 'Will', 'Kevin', 'keep', 'believing', 'key', 'nothing', 'more', 'keyboard', 'full', 'musical', 'tones', 'Will', 'He-man', 'Eternians', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'world', 'save', 'scorceress', 'Will', 'Skeletor', 'finally', 'be', 'victorious', 'taking', 'over', 'Eternia', 'enslaving', 'He-man', 'equals', 'great', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'storyline', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Many', 'critics', 'slammed', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'performance', 'Skeletor', 'made', 'terrific', 'villian', 'remember', 'Dracula', '1979', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'was', 'usual', 'gorgeous', 'yet', 'dangerous', 'James', 'Tolkan', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'comedic', 'detective', 'looking', 'Kevin', 'kevin', 'called', 'police', 'when', 'Julie', 'was', 'missing', 'Detective', 'Lubic', 'didnt', 'believe', 'word', 'Kevin', 'up', 'He-man', 'Eternians', 'as', 'well', 'Skeletors', 'soldiers', 'armed', 'teeth', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'mixes', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'type', 'great', 'cult', 'classic', 'anyones', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

338423,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,6302815673,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[1, 2]","Masters of the Universe was a much beloved film of mine when I was a kid because like most viewers of this movie, I was a fan of the cartoon and dolls.  But now...my heavens, is this movie a total shambles.  ...  What could've been a fascinating movie, with an interesting plot and characters, turns into this circus that becomes a joke.  Poor dialogue, with cliches every where, and a poor choice of setting for this fantasy movie.OK, Lundgren is fine as He-man and I didn't mind Evil Lynn and some of the other characters recreated from the cartoon.  But the problem was the movie created these other characters like Karg and this little dwarf thing with pimples that I don't ever remember on the show.  They left out a lot of the more popular characters on the cartoon show and replaced them with these not so familiar things.  Where's Orko?  Where's He-man tiger?  Where's Merman or Tri-Clops or the Evil Horde?  All missing in the film yet huge aspects with the story of He-Man.  This made it kinda frustrated for life long fans of the cartoon show like me.But even with these new unheard of characters, this film could've still survived, but no they make another monsterous error.  Instead of the plot taking place in Eternia, a land of intrigue they choose Earth, a planet that's had enough films about it.  I guess they wanted the storyline to relate to us, but that's what made Masters of the Universe, the cartoon show, so enjoyable.  It was in a different world, with different creatures, and powers and suddenly that gets wiped away because the director is an idiot.I suppose it's humorous how the He-man characters have to interract with people on Earth, but that's not what we want to see. It made the film very awkward by doing this, rather than learning of a new world with new plots and conflicts, the director tries to take a short cut and use Earth as the battle ground of He-Man's battles. Which, as a matter of fact, involves a bunch of stupid cheesy and stereotypical teenagers in the mix.These are symptoms of what I call ""low budget movies.""  They stink because they don't have the budget to make a good movie.  Naturally, directors of low budget films lack imagination in finding ways around a low budget.  Instead, they aim for a quick buck by stealing an idea formed by a cartoon series and turn it into some macho movie, knowing it will sell because it shares the same name as a popular cartoon series, even though there is no comparison to which one does the better job.I give the film two stars because it has a plot, just not a very good one.  And it is entertaining and still worth seeing just for the hell of it.  But it is so disappointing and there is so much potential with this film if it had just stuck to the cartoon series and didn't stray into the typical trap of trying to make it relate to us.  Please, the setting isn't going to help us relate, the characters are the key to helping us relate.  Not to mention Skeletor has moving lips and the guy is supposed to be a skull face.  Skulls have no lips.Masters of the Universe?  Ha!  Losers of the Universe because the movie has to come to over-used Earth for its battles with half the characters unknown to those of us who followed the cool cartoon series.

338438,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302815673,Reviewer,"[1, 1]","It's a classic confrontation between good and evil, and a struggle to save the Universe from the dark side, when a villain rises up and threatens all who oppose him with slavery or destruction in the 1987 offering ""Masters of the Universe,"" directed by Gary Goddard.  The evil Skeletor (Frank Langella) has captured the good Sorceress of Castle Greyskull (Christina Pickles) and is awaiting the moment when the Moon is at it's zenith, at which time he will be able to absorb all the powers of the cosmos and become Master of the Universe and omnipotent Ruler of their land, Eternia.  But everything is not yet right; though he has the Sorceress in his clutches, his formidable opponent and champion of the people, the indomitable He-Man (Dolph Lundgren) is still at large, and Skeletor knows he must bring him to his knees if he is to succeed.  Besides which, the ""Cosmic Key"" that will make it all possible for him is not yet in his possession.  So his task is two-fold:  He must enslave He-Man and find the Cosmic Key in order to effect his plans.  And the secret of the Key lies with the peaceable locksmith and inventor, Gwildor (Billy Barty), a trusting soul, who betrayed by the beautiful Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster) has gone into hiding.  Now it's up to He-Man to foil Skeletor and save Eternia and the Universe from his unscrupulous grasp and restore power to the Sorceress and Castle Greyskull.Though the make-up, costumes and special F/X are a bit cheesy, and overall the acting is bad, Goddard has put together a movie that is fun and exciting, and by lightening up on the menace has made it accessible to the whole family, including the younger set-- and, of course, since it's based on the children's animated TV series, it's just what you would expect, or should I say, hoped for, going in.  Goddard moves it all along at a crisp pace, never allowing it to get bogged down unnecessarily, and the ideals and principles to which the story adheres-- loyalty, honesty, trust, love of family-- all make this a worthwhile endeavor and a film to embrace.  Call it a poor man's ""Star Wars"" (from which it draws heavily, with the plethora of laser blasts and the ersatz ""storm troopers"" of Skeletor's army); the scale, perhaps, is not nearly as grand, but the sense of adventure and the overall feeling of Lucas's monumental film are certainly present.Hidden behind the bony skull mask, Langella brings Skeletor to life with flair, successfully conveying the evil at the core of his soul.  This is a creature cloaked in darkness, ruthless and intimidating, effectively sinister, but less daunting than say, Darth Vader.  He's scary, but it's not a character that's going to drive the little ones out of the room shrieking in terror.  Langella makes him a fun kind of evil presence, which keeps it upbeat and creates the necessary sense of evil without taking the viewer to the brink of despair or bad dreams.  It allows that unsettling feeling within an atmosphere of hope, and the realization that in the end all will be well in Eternia.  It's a strong performance by Langella, and without question the best in the movie.Another good performance is turned in by Meg Foster, as Evil-Lyn, Skeletor's right-hand woman.  Like Langella, Foster manages to convey evil without too much menace, and few actors have such absorbing, riveting eyes, which she uses to great effect here.  With her flowing cape, meaningful stride and a glance from those mesmerizing eyes, Foster makes Evil-Lyn a force to be reckoned with; she's a formidable opponent for He-Man, and one of the most memorable characters of the film.As He-Man, Lundgren certainly looks the part, which is no doubt what put him in the role to begin with.  But can he act?  Let's just say this is a fantasy, and as such, what Lundgren brings to the part is good enough.  When he raises his sword and exclaims, ""I have the power!"" it's a rush; He-Man lives-- embodied by Dolph Lundgren, and for this movie, it works.Fans of the TV series ""Friends"" will be interested in seeing the young Courteney Cox (twenty-three when this movie was filmed) here in her motion picture debut.  As Julie Winston, a high school girl who unwittingly gets drawn into the fray, she comports herself well enough, though her performance is a far cry from anything that would earn an Oscar nomination.  She does make Julie believable, however, which is the important thing.  Again, this is a fantasy, and as such it doesn't take a lot to keep you in the story.  Suffice to say that Cox has come a long way since making this one.James Tolkan, on the other hand, does not fare as well as some of the others here.  A talented character actor, he nevertheless gives an embarrassingly bad performance as Detective Lubic.  A stereotype if ever there was one, Tolkan still can't seem to get a handle on who Lubic is or where he fits in.  This is a role just about any actor could've walked through without missing a beat, but Tolkan manages to muck it up so badly he becomes a distraction at times.  It may have been a case of trying to make too much out of something that simply wasn't intended to be anything other than what it was; and it's understandable that as an actor Tolkan would want to make the most of what he was given.  In this case, however, it was unnecessary, and just didn't work.The supporting cast includes Jon Cypher (Man-at-Arms), Robert Duncan McNeill (Kevin) and Barry Livingston (Charlie).  Enjoyable family fare, ""Masters of the Universe"" may not be the best movie of all time, but it is what it is and offers a fun and satisfying evening's entertainment.  It's the magic of the movies.",3,He-Man Comes To Life,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,5631,"['classic', 'confrontation', 'good', 'evil', 'struggle', 'save', 'Universe', 'dark', 'side', 'when', 'villain',

What easily could have been a standard-setting movie for entertaining the whole family was allowed to degenerate into an overblown and overhyped production.Lundgreen does look physically stunning as the protagonist, but looks alone fail to save this film from the dreaded early morning b-movie status it has since accumulated.

There is only so much the actors can attempt to improve in this script.Recognizing that the studio attempted to make the adventure pleasing for adults and teens as well as children, I never less feel saddened that the premise of the cartoon (which is how most people came into contact with the He-Man  franchise) was dumped in favor of a less successful storyline and characterization. The losers were of course the fans of all ages who expected to see an awesome movie staring one of their cartoon favirotes.Perhaps it was never destined to be in the ranks of Gone With the Wind and Casablanca, but it would not have hurt to excercise a little more quality control over the creation and production of this product.If there is some small consolation to be pulled from all of this, it is that the She-ra spin-off was not included in the production because it likely would have been saddled with the same camp and cheese characterizing this film.",1,Stunk then and now,1007251200,"12 2, 2001",2001,1754,"['went', '1987', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'figuring', 'would', 'see', 'reasonable', 'fascimille', 'one', 'favirote', 'cartoon', 'show', 'reincarnated', 'live', 'action', 'big', 'screen', 'production.WrongAttributing', 'first', 'disappointment', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'rented', 'movie', 'young', 'adult', 'found', 'was', 'still', 'unbelievably', 'campy', 'dense', 'What', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'standard-setting', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'allowed', 'degenerate', 'overblown', 'overhyped', 'production.Lundgreen', 'look', 'physically', 'stunning', 'protagonist', 'alone', 'fail', 'save', 'film', 'dreaded', 'early', 'morning', 'b-movie', 'status', 'accumulated', 'costumes', 'are', 'generally', 'well', 'done-but', 'dialouge', 'construction', 'delivery', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'terms', 'quality', 'content', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'actors', 'can', 'attempt', 'improve', 'script.Recognizing', 'studio', 'attempted', 'make', 'adventure', 'pleasing', 'adults', 'teens', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'never', 'less', 'feel', 'saddened', 'premise', 'cartoon', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'came', 'contact', 'He-Man', 'franchise', 'was', 'dumped', 'favor', 'less', 'successful', 'storyline', 'characterization', 'losers', 'were', 'course', 'fans', 'ages', 'who', 'expected', 'see', 'awesome', 'movie', 'staring', 'one', 'cartoon', 'favirotes.Perhaps', 'was', 'never', 'destined', 'be', 'ranks', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Casablanca', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'hurt', 'excercise', 'little', 'more', 'quality', 'control', 'creation', 'production', 'product.If', 'small', 'consolation', 'be', 'pulled', 'She-ra', 'spin-off', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'production', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'saddled', 'same', 'camp', 'cheese', 'characterizing', 'film']",N/A

But, I feel obligated to point out that it is a lot better than most of the recent stuff I have looked at. Some movies give us all effects and no story; this gives us some effects and a decent amount of story. Often  new movies give us slapstick humour and an overdose of profanity. This movie gives us some comical wit and explains the characters' frustrations without the use of profanity. Some movies try to force feed us what is supposedly politically correct; this movie just gives us a story. Many new movies lack a story and just give a soundtrack; this movie allows the music to flatter the story. Many new movies give us an overdose of blood and guts; this story shows us confrontations without worrying about the blood. Now to be sure, this is not one of my favorite movies, but the fact that it does not fall into any of the above increases my opinion of it. He Man, Man At Arms, and Teela show themselves as heroes with at least some human weaknesses. (Good!) Evil Lynn, Blade, and Beastman are worth a fair amount of attention. But in my opinion, it is Frank Langella as Skeletor who really steals the movie. (Just as in his &quot;Dracula,&quot; he is VERY evil, but he is drawn with such energy that he is more fascinating than repulsive.) So while this was never my favorite movie, the quality of most modern media has increased my opinion of this film quite a bit. Watch it.

338453,A34U3YP0DGBJ79,6302815673,"""tee-vee-stevie""","[0, 0]","Cast your mind back to the early-mid eighties when He-man was every child's hero.  Birthdays and christmas presents were adorned with action figures, books and various other spin-offs from the cartoon. Afternoons  were filled with the excitement of watching, what to me was, the greatest  show on earth. School playtimes were passed by battling your He-man with  your best friends Skeletor and your dreams were filled of the magical  Eternia.  But it all had to end, we grew up, new cartoons such as the Ninja  Turtles were favored by the new kids, Donatello and leaonardo replaced  He-man, Orko and the rest of the Masters of the Univers Crew.  And today,  he-man is almost forgotten by the majority.But in 1987, Warner gave us  something to remeber the great man, with the theatrical release of Masters  of the Universe.  The film can be enjoyed by (supposed) adults like me,  without the scorn of immaturity accusations that would be hailed at you if  you were to reclaim your He-man collection from the attic,  dust off your  figures and start fighting them.Masters of The Universe was a good  attempt at bringing to life the cartoon, however it could have been better  had it stayed a little closer to the original scipts.  Dolph Lundgren is an  inspired choice to play He-man and Frank Langella is equally suited in his  role as Skeletor.  However, with the exception of the Sorceress, Teela, Man  of Arms and Evil Lyn, there really are few of the original characters.  I  was extremely dissapointed when I first saw this, that my personal  favourite character, Orko (that little alien Jester thing) wasn't in it.  Also He-man doesn't flit between being the normal human prince Adam and  then turning into He-man as was the case in the cartoon, remember the  immortal phrase &quot;by the power of Greyskull&quot; animated by Adam  holding up his sword and then becoming He-man.  I also felt that not enough  effort was put into Eternia, there is little evidence of the fantastic  landscapes and castles that the cartoons and books portrayed Eternia as  having.  The film, for the majority is set on Earth, after a key which  enables time and location travel is stolen by Skeletor.  A battle ensues on  Earth between He-man and Skeletor and is then continued back in Skeletors  lare in Eternia, where Skeletor is holding the sorceress prisoner.  It is  up to He-man to defeat Skeletor, the Lord of Destruction and save the  sorceress.The film may not have an Oscar winning script, but the actors  do a good job (look out for Courtney Cox in an earley role).  The plot is  simple, but this is what you would expect and even want from such a film,  after all it is based on a childrens cartoon.  The movie is, despite the  few minor criticisms that I made, extremely enjoyable, all eighties kids  will enjoy this nostalgic trip.

He'd be a perfect He-Man!"" The error lay, of course, in not realizing the differences between the two: one is a lifeless, two-dimensional caricature of masculinity; the other is a cartoon character.So instead of a faithful adaptation of the cartoon series, the producers offered this stripped-down rendition (scaled back, one would suppose, to accomodate the limited thespian abilities of its star). Lundgren -- blond, brawny and with a set of pecs that would give Dolly Parton pause -- plays the superhero locked in an eternal, epic battle with Skeletor, a power-crazed supervillain played by scenery-shredding ""superham"" Frank Langella. They move through the story, such as it is, as statically as their counterparts in the afternoon kiddie cartoon.Langella, (made up to look like Jack Palance with leprosy), aims to take over the planet Eternia, a war-torn paradise ruled by the Sorceress of Greyskull Castle (""St. Elsewhere's"" Christina Pickles, wearing what appears to be a chandelier on her head), but her champion He-Man opposes him with his mighty sword. The titanic battle is brought to Earth when a brilliantly grating little troll (Billy Barty) magically transports them to Colby, Calif., via his Cosmic Key.Actually they were headed for another planet, but a stray power bolt (or perhaps a chintzy producer) altered their orbit. Why build an out-of-this-world set when you can just go down to the mall and shoot off sparklers? So Earth waitress Courteney Cox and her boyfriend Robert Duncan Mitchell are drawn into the otherworldly warfare when they happen to find the key, mistaking it for some sort of Japanese stereo speaker.Director Gary Goddard had previously created mythical kingdoms for Universal Studios -- ""Kong on the Loose"" and ""Conan."" And let's just say he hadn't quite made the leap from tourist traps to feature films. The actors are basically on their own -- either hamming it up behind a mask ( Langella), or nearly numb (Lundgren). It sounds as if the Scandinavian-born muscleman had been studying under Stallone's diction coach, but he has a sort-of-sweet, shining charisma, grinning and glistening, wearing thongs and things and accentuating his hunkiness with plenty of grease. (It takes a lot of Wesson Oil to make a movie like Masters of the Universe.)

I'm saddened to say I was fairly disappointed with this live action version. The plot line was alright, scattered at best but okay. Some of the new characters brought in were atrocious. Gwildor I am sorry to say could have been left out of it. But considering back when this version was made, the special effects and the budget just wouldn't allow for the inclusion of Orko. Blade was cool in the fact it gave He-Man another swordsman to duel with. Karg should have been left out of it.He-Man was definitely not a role meant for Dolph Lundgren I'm sorry again. Lundgren did fine in Rocky 4 but when it came to something like this where He-Man's speech should have been constant throughout the movie, just dimmed it. Lundgren spoke little if nil throughout the picture.Frank Langella stole the whole show as Skeletor and rightly so. It's fairly disconcerting when I actually dug the bad guy more than my favorite good guy. A great choice by director Gary Goddard not to hinder Langella's acting by making him wear a flat out mask. Incorporating the prosthetics into his facial features was monument in making Skeletor a memorable baddie.Meg Foster, whom folks may recognize from Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, I thought did exceptional as Evil Lyn. My only complaint about the Evil Lyn character was that she never that I could see, showed her powers in the movie. Skeletor at least got to perform that sick looking wound thing as well as his ""Godlike"" powers towards the end of the movie, but nothing for Evil Lyn??? For shame Goddard, for shame!Of course we have Courtney Cox Arquette now, who just recently gained fame for her role as Monica on Friends, debuting as Julie Winston. James Tolkan who people saw in Top Gun, playing Det. Lubic. Robert Duncan Macneill who folks remember as Tom Paris in Star Trek Voyager, playing Kevin Corrigan. Chelsea Field who folks saw in movies such as Andre, playing Teela. Christina Pickles, whom we saw in George Of The Jungle and The Wedding Singer, played the Sorceress. And of course Billy Barty, whom we saw in movies such as Legend and the Weird Al movie UHF.In other aspects I must say the Power Sword looked brilliant, the laser effects and the final duel between He-Man and Skeletor had a decent amount of zing. And the graphics and music that were associated with the Cosmic Key were interesting and appropriate I think. Kudos to Bill Conti of Rocky fame who contributed to the orchestral soundtrack and themes for the movie.All in all with a movie like this I can understand why studios and distributors now tend to shy away from a more updated telling of the He-Man lore. With the re-release of the cartoons on DVD and the popular demand that followed, the reigniting flame for the He-Man film has never been more warranted. This movie is still no matter what worth purchasing because of it's part in the He-Man movie/cartoon legacy and collection, but it's not an extremely good movie in my opinion. Maybe he should have gotten a few more pointers from Superman director and savior Bryan Singer.Does Dolph Lundgren truly have the power????

We used to practice the He-Man roll in the backyard; that was the coolest gymnastic stunt around. My brother's favorite character was Orko and Tela was everything I thought a woman should be. The toys were dropping in popularity, the cartoon was no longer being produced, and in some places all reruns had stopped by the time MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE was released in 1987. The franchise was dying and the film was a last ditch effort to revitalize things. Unfortunately it did the opposite and buried the He-Man Universe in oblivion for awhile.MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE is a really cheesy film that lacks any charm and totally rips off several other films, but without being original. Very few characters from the He-Man cartoons make it to the big screen. The acting is pretty bad, the scenery and sets dull, and the special effects lame. The score is a rip off of the SUPERMAN score and much of the plot is directly stolen from the STAR WARS trilogy.Besides being a He-Man fan, the film is worth watching for two reasons. One: it is a great example of bad 80's action movies; plus it dives into one of the more memorable parts of the 80's pop music scene--the synthesizer. The other reason the movie is worth watching is to see a pre-star Courtney Cox; she is as hot then as she is now.Other than that, I would watch the new He-Man cartoons and wait another 6-9 months for the release of the original He-Man cartoons on DVD and video",2,Losers of the Universe,1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,1512,"['He-Man', 'was', 'cartoon', 'just', 'kid', 'age', 'watched', 'growing', 'up', 'used', 'practice', 'He-Man', 'roll', 'backyard', 'was', 'coolest', 'gymnastic', 'stunt', 'around', 'brother', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Orko', 'Tela', 'was', 'everything', 'thought', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'toys', 'were', 'dropping', 'popularity', 'cartoon', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'produced', 'places', 'reruns', 'had', 'stopped', 'time', 'MASTERS', 'THE', 'UNIVERSE', 'was', 'released', '1987', 'franchise', 'was', 'dying', 'film', 'was', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'revitalize', 'things', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'opposite', 'buried', 'He-Man', 'Universe', 'oblivion', 'awhile.MASTERS', 'THE', 'UNIVERSE', 'really', 'cheesy', 'film', 'charm', 'totally', 'rips', 'off', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'being', 'original', 'Very', 'few', 'characters', 'He-Man', 'cartoons', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'scenery', 'sets', 'dull', 'special', 'effects', 'lame', 'score', 'rip', 'SUPERMAN', 'score', 'much', 'plot', 'directly', 'stolen', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'being', 'He-Man', 'fan', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'two', 'reasons', 'One', 'great', 'example', 'bad', '80', 'action', 'movies', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'parts', '80', 'pop', 'music', 'scene', 'synthesizer', 'other', 'reason', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'pre-star', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'hot', 'then', 'now.Other', 'would', 'watch', 'new', 'He-Man', 'cartoons', 'wait', '6-9', 'months', 'release', 'original', 'He-Man', 'cartoons', 'DVD', 'video']",N/A
338463,A2FW5HFTKNR9ZT,6302815673,tygra86,"[0, 0]","First off, why are alot of you reviewers upset about this film taking most of its place on Earth. I mean, if not Earth, we'd be seeing nothing but people fighting in the desert. Becuase, that's pretty much what Eternia is, it's a desert type of land. So, in saying that, I think that Earth was a cool idea. Also, the interior and exterior of Castle Greyskull were very nicely done. The acting is a bit ""meh,"" but the action is awesome, especially the whole hoverboard scene. Also, one reviewer was saying how the hoverboard scene was taken from Back to the Future Part 2, but, you're actually mistaken. I watched an episode of He-Man on Masters of the Universe Season 1 Part 1, and the bad guys were riding around on hover-like devices. So, I'm pretty sure the hoverboards were from the cartoon, not from BTTF 2. Also, the special effects were nicely done. EX: That laser-like whip that Blade had, the plasmic energy stuff that came out of Skeletor's hands, the cosmic key, the laserss from the guns, etcetera. Another thing, He-Man, Man-At-Arms, Skeletor, Evil-Lynn and Beastman all did a good job looking like their cartoon counterparts. The Sorceress and Teela's costumes were a bit altered, but, still, they looked cool also. So, all-in-all if you really think about it, this movie did stay true enough to the cartoon, though it did have some alterations to it. The score, also, was amazing. That theme to this film really  gives a heroic promise. I loved it. And, when Eternia was filmed, it looked like that of the cartoon. And, lastly, watch this movie on DVD, not on television or VHS, because the picture and sound quality are at its greatest when watched on DVD. I mean, it makes Masters of the Universe a 10X's better film when the pic. and sound quality is this awesome. But, even if you have the VHS, it's still an awesome film.

Corse ""OldOneEye""","[4, 4]","I often watched the He-Man cartoon series with my kids as they were growing up, and I fell in love with the characters and the wonderful stories, some of which had some strong adult truths buried just beneath the  surface.  Unlike &quot;Transformers&quot;, He-Man and She-Ra were about  fighting evil for a higher purpose, without getting preachy about it.  The movie takes the main characters from the series - He-Man, the loyal  Man-at-Arms and his warrior daughter, Skeletor and Evil-Lynne - and brings  them to 20th-Century Earth in a very convincing way.  The dwarf-gnome  character in the movie serves as a stand-in for Orko, but is obviously  based more on the Hobbits from &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;  This bit of  artistic license grounds the movie in our reality by providing a character  that the human teenagers can interact with as the story unfolds to its  obvious, but very exciting conclusion.Dolph Lundgren looks the part of  He-Man and he swings a mean sword, but it's obvious that his dialogue was  kept to a bare minimum.  Still, the other characters pick up the slack, and  Frank Langella is marvelous as Skeletor - as in many of the animated shows,  he's the one who drives the action.  The opening scene where Skeletor  marches triumphantly into Castle Greyskull (which is rendered very  authentically) sends a genuine chill down your spine, and the final battle  between He-Man and Skeletor is worth the wait.  One touch I really  appreciated was the theme of music as the key to the universe.  The film's  music score is top-notch and paces the storyline very well.  Kudos also to  Meg Foster (is that right? you'll know her when you see her) who gives  Evil-Lynne some real depth and a truly sharp edge not seen in the series.  The entire cast was wonderful; it's a shame they could not put together a  sequel using the same people.  It's not quite Star Wars, but you'll enjoy  this fun adventure film for many years to come.",4,Good live-action rendering of the animated series.,931737600,"07 12, 1999",1999,1954,"['often', 'watched', 'He-Man', 'cartoon', 'series', 'kids', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'fell', 'love', 'characters', 'wonderful', 'stories', 'had', 'strong', 'adult', 'truths', 'buried', 'just', 'surface', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Transformers', 'quot', 'He-Man', 'She-Ra', 'were', 'fighting', 'evil', 'higher', 'purpose', 'getting', 'preachy', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'He-Man', 'loyal', 'Man-at-Arms', 'warrior', 'daughter', 'Skeletor', 'Evil-Lynne', '20th-Century', 'Earth', 'very', 'convincing', 'way', 'dwarf-gnome', 'character', 'movie', 'stand-in', 'Orko', 'obviously', 'based', 'more', 'Hobbits', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings.', 'quot', 'bit', 'artistic', 'license', 'movie', 'reality', 'providing', 'character', 'human', 'teenagers', 'can', 'interact', 'story', 'obvious', 'very', 'exciting', 'conclusion.Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'part', 'He-Man', 'swings', 'mean', 'sword', 'obvious', 'dialogue', 'was', 'kept', 'bare', 'minimum', 'Still', 'other', 'characters', 'pick', 'up', 'slack', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'marvelous', 'Skeletor', 'many', 'animated', 'shows', 'one', 'who', 'action', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'Skeletor', 'triumphantly', 'Castle', 'Greyskull', 'rendered', 'very', 'authentically', 'genuine', 'chill', 'down', 'spine', 'final', 'battle', 'He-Man', 'Skeletor', 'wait', 'One', 'touch', 'really', 'appreciated', 'was', 'theme', 'music', 'key', 'universe', 'film', 'music', 'score', 'top-notch', 'storyline', 'very', 'well', 'Kudos', 'also', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'right', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'who', 'Evil-Lynne', 'real', 'depth', 'truly', 'sharp', 'edge', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'wonderful', 'shame', 'could', 'not', 'put', 'together', 'sequel', 'using', 'same', 'people', 'not', 'quite', 'Star', 'Wars', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'fun', 'adventure', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'come']",N/A
