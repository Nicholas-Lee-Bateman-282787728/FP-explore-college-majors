1670530,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00F6SAMTA,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","So I went into watching the first season of this series with a bit of trepidation. I'll admit that I wasn't in the mood to watch it and that I didn't expect much. I mean haven't we already had enough idiocy after watching numerous years of JACKASS? Did we really need another show that had guys doing stupid guy things that were funny when we were in high school or college?Imagine my surprise to discover myself laughing as each episode played. Seriously, there were moments when I had to pause the disc so that I wouldn't miss what was said or done next I was laughing so hard. Now, that isn't to say that everything you will see here is hilarious or that it might not be offensive to some, but for the most part it is really funny.If you've never watched the show we have four friends (Sal, Joe, Q and Murr) who challenge each other with new tasks each week. As a matter of fact they try out several tasks with each episode. As each one either succeeds or fails their task they accumulate points until the end of the show when one is designated the loser who must then perform a task given them by the winner, almost always something totally embarrassing for most people. All tasks are done out in public and as with most shows of this kind you can either get a sympathetic ear from some folks or a belt from others. It's a risk they take but one they do with the hopes of getting laughs and thus viewers each week.The &#34;dares&#34; that each one of these friends comes up with involve some setting up and in some cases the participation of various businesses that will allow them to pretend to be working there. For instance one event takes place in a White Castle where each member must pretend to be a waiter at the counter. The problem is that while doing so they wear an ear bud that the other three are talking into, giving them instructions as to what to say or to do. They can either choose to follow those instructions or ignore them completely thus losing that round. More often than not they follow through.Another event had them shopping out of other people's carts in a grocery store. One of them goes so far as to take a shopper's entire cart when they aren't looking. They take food off of other people's plates at a buffet, teach a karate class, try to raise money for some odd charities and many other antics. As I said, not all work but most do and the end result is hilarious at times.So is this series one that you'll want to buy and keep on the shelf? If you had asked me before watching it I would have said no. If you had asked me while I was watching it I'd have said maybe but let me watch some more. At the moment though I think this is a series I'd hold on to. Maybe you'll come home one night, down in the dumps and ready to just kick back. Pop this one in the DVD player and my guess is you'll be smiling shortly after the credits kick in. It will provide some stupid laughs that won't require you to think much or to be too involved.

1670531,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00F6SAMTA,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 24]","Can someone tell me what is so funny about 4 annoying morons, overly happy to dare each other to do stupid things like walk into a grocery store, pluck food from other customers shopping carts and walk off like nothing happened? How is this any different to other lame practical joke shows of the past? In the past, they did not have commentary or microphones attached to the person doing the dare. That's all the difference is between this show and the billion others.At least the other ones you could see prank/skit/dare piled up one after the other. But now you have to sit there and watch their before, during and after thoughts of the prank/dare they pulled off? This trend started with &#34;The Weakest Link&#34; when some moron thought it would be entertainment to film a post video of the person eliminated saying, &#34;Duhhh, I was not smarts enough to win, I feel sad now, boo hoo&#34; and it's been rammed down our throat's in so many more shows since. The bottom line is... WHO CARES???????This show is a waste of time and space. Throwing in the boring interviews, voice overs and social commentary of 4 guys doing things that are not funny to begin with should be a recipe for disaster. Yet somehow it's gone on for 3 seasons? What is going on here? Brain Washing? Cast and Crew have made their own reviews here and elsewhere? Because I can't for the life of me understand how anyone can watch this for more than 2 minutes and not be sickened by how lame what they are seeing and switch over to something more entertaining, like watching paint dry.These guys do nothing but pretend to have the time of their lives, which I hate, because it's so obviously fake. Then they do a dare that is clearly set up to begin with. Then they talk and pat each other on the back for coming up with their dumb ideas. Fake mock each other in way's that even a preschooler wouldn't be put off by their lame insults..... I can't write about this show anymore. It's just sickening that people could consider this to be good TV.I expect now I will be flooded by illogical comments saying I must not have a sense of humor? If I said I didn't like Kobe Bryant, I'm sure someone will reply with I must hate basketball, or sports all together? So think before you waste everyones time with replies to this and accept the fact that there are people who don't find this show the slightest bit funny.

1670533,A30ZHC0AUR04LF,B00F6SAMTA,SAH,"[1, 1]","Impractical Jokers is one of the funniest shows I've seen. I'd rate the later seasons 5 stars easily. The only reason this season is rated 4 stars, is that there is a lot of dumb sexual humor in this one. I have a feeling that the producers weren't sure who their target demographic was when they first came out with the show, so they probably told the guys to use a lot of suggestive jokes. In the first episode alone, they talk about hand jobs several times. It's heavy handed. It's just not as funny as when they are being themselves and doing the weird/random stuff that makes the show so great.For those who haven't seen the show; the premise is four friends put each other in embarrassing and funny situations and whoever can't pull off the required prank has to do something the other three set up at the end of the episode. They usually have a hidden head set on and are required to do weird things in a grocery store or in a park, whatever the other three are telling them to do. For example they have to eat things off of strangers plates in restaurants without saying anything (think the Chinese Restaurant episode of Seinfeld). They have to do seemingly impossible things like &#34;kiss a stranger's abs&#34; or clip a stranger's toe nails. Sometimes they have to get people to sign petitions for causes they aren't allowed to see until they lift the paper that the person is supposed to sign, and they have to convince the person to sign it and of course the causes are ridiculous. The punishment for the loser at the end of the show has been for example; being a human pinata, having to open the door of a public bathroom while on the toilet and ask for people in the restaurant to hand them toilet paper, and giving a slide show presentation during which they have no idea what is on the slides because the other three friends have prepared it.The show is funny because what they are doing isn't just pissing people off, it's confusing people and embarrassing the four guys. Half of what's great is anticipating the person having to go through with a particular challenge. It's also surprising to see how much people will put up with and how rare it is for someone to actually object to the weird stuff they do. Watching unsuspecting people deal with their antics is entertaining.Generally, the later seasons are ones you could watch with younger family members. I'm glad I didn't try showing my pre-teen cousins this first season though, because I was really caught off guard by the lewd jokes. Glad the guys were allowed to eventually be themselves and tone it down.Because everyone's sense of humor is different I'll say, I love this show and the humor I like is: Seinfeld, South Park, In Living Color, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Office, An Idiot Abroad, Kids In The Hall, Arrested Development, Trailer Park Boys, Mad TV, sometimes old Family Guy, Tosh.O, sometimes Jackass (or for the original fans..CKY2K), Big Bang Theory.",4,"Hilarious, but raunchier than later seasons",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,2942,"['Impractical', 'Jokers', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'d"", 'rate', 'later', 'seasons', '5', 'stars', 'easily', 'only', 'reason', 'season', 'rated', '4', 'stars', 'lot', 'dumb', 'sexual', 'humor', 'one', 'have', 'feeling', 'producers', 'were', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'target', 'demographic', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'show', 'probably', 'told', 'guys', 'use', 'lot', 'suggestive', 'jokes', 'first', 'episode', 'alone', 'talk', 'hand', 'jobs', 'several', 'times', 'heavy', 'handed', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'when', 'are', 'being', 'doing', 'weird/random', 'stuff', 'show', 'so', 'great.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'premise', 'four', 'friends', 'put', 'other', 'embarrassing', 'funny', 'situations', 'whoever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'required', 'prank', 'do', 'something', 'other', 'three', 'set', 'up', 'end', 'episode', 'usually', 'have', 'hidden', 'head', 'set', 'are', 'required', 'do', 'weird', 'things', 'grocery', 'store', 'park', 'whatever', 'other', 'three', 'are', 'telling', 'do', 'example', 'have', 'eat', 'things', 'strangers', 'plates', 'restaurants', 'saying', 'anything', 'think', 'Chinese', 'Restaurant', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'have', 'do', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'things', '34', 'kiss', 'stranger', 'abs', '34', 'clip', 'stranger', 'toe', 'nails', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'get', 'people', 'sign', 'petitions', 'causes', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'see', 'lift', 'paper', 'person', 'supposed', 'sign', 'have', 'convince', 'person', 'sign', 'course', 'causes', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'punishment', 'loser', 'end', 'show', 'been', 'example', 'being', 'human', 'pinata', 'having', 'open', 'door', 'public', 'bathroom', 'toilet', 'ask', 'people', 'restaurant', 'hand', 'toilet', 'paper', 'giving', 'slide', 'show', 'presentation', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'slides', 'other', 'three', 'friends', 'have', 'prepared', 'it.The', 'show', 'funny', 'what', 'are', 'doing', ""n't"", 'just', 'pissing', 'people', 'confusing', 'people', 'embarrassing', 'four', 'guys', 'Half', 'what', 'great', 'anticipating', 'person', 'having', 'go', 'particular', 'challenge', 'also', 'surprising', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'will', 'put', 'up', 'how', 'rare', 'someone', 'actually', 'object', 'weird', 'stuff', 'do', 'Watching', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'deal', 'antics', 'entertaining.Generally', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'ones', 'could', 'watch', 'younger', 'family', 'members', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'showing', 'pre-teen', 'cousins', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'lewd', 'jokes', 'Glad', 'guys', 'were', 'allowed', 'eventually', 'be', 'tone', 'everyone', 'sense', 'humor', 'different', ""'ll"", 'say', 'love', 'show', 'humor', 'like', 'Seinfeld', 'South', 'Park', 'Living', 'Color', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'Office', 'Idiot', 'Abroad', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Trailer', 'Park', 'Boys', 'Mad', 'TV', 'sometimes', 'old', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Tosh.O', 'sometimes', 'Jackass', 'original', 'fans..CKY2K', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory']",Impractical Jokers: S1 (DVD)

These four very funny, very human comedians have been friends a lifetime and they delight in publicly embarrassing each other in this unique reality/comedy series.  Part ""Candid Camera"" part ""Punk'd,"" there are not a whole lot of taboo subjects these guys won't try to make a joke out of.  Various stunts, set-ups and uncomfortable situations called challenges must be endured and instructions must be followed to a tee or that Joker gets a loss.  At the end of each show the joker with the most losses must complete a ""punishment.""  There has not been an episode I've seen in any season in which I have not been in stitches.  If you like to laugh, Impractical Jokers will deliver!A side note- this is the first time I've purchased a complete season with Amazon on demand streaming.

The show is always amusing and invariably contains moments that are completely hilarious. While at times it may seem the hosts are called upon to act rudely to unsuspecting victims, no one is seriously harmed, other than the hosts themselves. It is some of these moments in which the hosts fail to complete their assigned pranks and is still amusing even in their failures.",5,A hidden camera show for a modern era.,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,443,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'show', 'original', 'twist', 'hidden', 'camera', 'humor', 'show', 'always', 'amusing', 'invariably', 'moments', 'are', 'completely', 'hilarious', 'times', 'may', 'seem', 'hosts', 'are', 'called', 'act', 'rudely', 'unsuspecting', 'victims', 'one', 'seriously', 'harmed', 'other', 'hosts', 'moments', 'hosts', 'fail', 'complete', 'assigned', 'pranks', 'still', 'amusing', 'even', 'failures']",Impractical Jokers: S1 (DVD)
