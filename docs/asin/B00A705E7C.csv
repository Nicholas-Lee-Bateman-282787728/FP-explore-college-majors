1606183,A1NUDHU6HSLVEY,B00A705E7C,Peazfool,"[6, 6]","Just wow. This movie is a masterpiece.(Spoilers) I have never seen a film that tackled sexuality like this one has. A perfect blend of love, forbiddance, sex, mystery, drama, and murder all in one with a dark twisted undertone. This movie at the beginning is a murder mystery, but builds to be one of the best movies of 2012 - and believe me I have seen a LOT of movies in 2012 -  The King's Speech, Lincoln, Safety Not Guaranteed, Wreck-it Ralph, Dark Knight Rises. I actually could not control my emotions at the end because I, for one, finally understood all the ridicule and torment that homosexuals have to go through. (super spoiler alert) That a person would have to change his sexuality just to be with the person he loved, because society forbid it so much - could anything else be more of a testament to love? Could anyone out there say ""I think I have found my soul mate"" and simply let go? I found myself, a straight male, identifying with the pain and the anguish of the gay characters in the film, in not just one of the best love/drama/mystery films of 2012, but a masterpiece that forced a change in my perspective.",5,Wow,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,1131,"['Just', 'wow', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'Spoilers', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'tackled', 'sexuality', 'one', 'perfect', 'blend', 'love', 'forbiddance', 'sex', 'mystery', 'drama', 'murder', 'one', 'dark', 'twisted', 'undertone', 'movie', 'beginning', 'murder', 'mystery', 'builds', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2012', 'believe', 'have', 'seen', 'LOT', 'movies', '2012', 'King', 'Speech', 'Lincoln', 'Safety', 'Not', 'Guaranteed', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'actually', 'could', 'not', 'control', 'emotions', 'end', 'one', 'finally', 'ridicule', 'torment', 'homosexuals', 'have', 'go', 'super', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'change', 'sexuality', 'just', 'be', 'person', 'loved', 'society', 'forbid', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'anything', 'else', 'be', 'more', 'testament', 'love', 'Could', 'anyone', 'there', 'say', 'think', 'have', 'found', 'soul', 'mate', 'simply', 'let', 'go', 'found', 'straight', 'male', 'identifying', 'pain', 'anguish', 'gay', 'characters', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'love/drama/mystery', 'films', '2012', 'masterpiece', 'forced', 'change', 'perspective']",Rainbow Eyes

It then slowly begins to morph in to a tale of forbidden sexual inclinations, guilt-trips and cover-ups.
