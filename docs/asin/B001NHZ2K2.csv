The crew of a spaceship is playing a virtual reality game while on a journey to a distant outpost in an effort to save our planet. However the line between reality and fantasy becomes blurred for the crew and someone is suspected of foul play. This is an interesting science fiction offering with good special effects and performances.

That is why I think it was unnecessary to copycat2001 - A Space Odysseyin regard to the captain's ""accidental"" death, what a lack of originality.

1220074,A5BX1XWLCDBMP,B001NHZ2K2,"E. Sterling ""Sterling""","[5, 14]","Virtuality was going to be a TV show on Fox, but they passed on it. I didn't know that when I bought it, or else I wouldn't have. Being made for TV, it's full of bad acting and akward pauses that were meant for commercial time. And the ending does not cap off the story at all, because it was meant to continue. The story itself has a cool premise about Earth becoming inhabitale and the crew of a ship being diverted to search for a new home in a distant star system. But all that is just briefly touched on. The movie is more of a soap opera set in space than a true Science fiction film. Little science and lots of drama. The charaters are a bunch of good looking twenty somethings. (that always cracks me up)  In the ship the crew has a virtual reality device that is meant for training and recreation (nothing original here). There is a glitch or a virus in the software that messes with several of the crew and blurs the lines between reality and the vr device. They all argue about it for an hour and a half before the dumb ending. If you are looking for a good space film that is well acted and has an original story, I suggest watching Sunshine, directed by Danny Boyle.",2,Failed TV show makes for bad film...Duh,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,1179,"['Virtuality', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'TV', 'show', 'Fox', 'passed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'bought', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'Being', 'made', 'TV', 'full', 'bad', 'acting', 'akward', 'pauses', 'were', 'meant', 'commercial', 'time', 'ending', 'not', 'cap', 'off', 'story', 'was', 'meant', 'continue', 'story', 'cool', 'premise', 'Earth', 'becoming', 'inhabitale', 'crew', 'ship', 'being', 'diverted', 'search', 'new', 'home', 'distant', 'star', 'system', 'just', 'briefly', 'touched', 'movie', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'set', 'space', 'true', 'Science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Little', 'science', 'lots', 'drama', 'charaters', 'are', 'bunch', 'good', 'looking', 'twenty', 'somethings', 'always', 'cracks', 'up', 'ship', 'crew', 'virtual', 'reality', 'device', 'meant', 'training', 'recreation', 'nothing', 'original', 'here', 'glitch', 'virus', 'software', 'several', 'crew', 'lines', 'reality', 'vr', 'device', 'argue', 'hour', 'half', 'dumb', 'ending', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'space', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'original', 'story', 'suggest', 'watching', 'Sunshine', 'directed', 'Danny', 'Boyle']",Virtuality

1220077,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B001NHZ2K2,MadMacs,"[1, 2]","Intended as the pilot for a new series, this tv movie tested very poorly and wasn't picked up; not even as a mid-season replacement, which is telling.Opens as a 12-person crew is set to attempt humanity's first interstellar voyage, traveling to the star nearest our own sun. The catch: The spaceship Phaeton and its associated costs have been ""sponsored"" by a global consortium of corporations and businesses. To help defray their investment, the crew, a mix of scientists and cultural specialists, have agreed to be filmed reality-television style; their ten-year journey captured, edited and broadcast for a weekly show dependent on ratings and advertising.As they approach the final countdown to their go/no-go decision, a bizarre multitude of problems suddenly crop up - culminating in the death one of the crew. Was he the victim of circumstance a.k.a. bad luck, or is there something more sinister behind it? Can the remaining members continue under the scrutiny of the cameras, stuck in space for a decade with nowhere to go or escape, all while balancing the fear that one of their mates might be a psychopathic murderer?Sound silly? Sort of, because it's a bit like one of the 'Airport' movies.Would I have followed the show? No. For the exact same reason why I detest the unreality of Big Brother = contrived drama and the participation of self-indulgent narcissists. To be fair, the fictional crew of space travelers in 'Virtuality' aren't made up of the typical conniving megalomaniacs that normally populate such programs. But that's small comfort since, in some ways, they're worse.Reason: I can't begin to understand or imagine how most of the crew were selected. As many as a third have noticeable personality disorders, the others seem borderline incompetent. Would anyone really stock such a dangerous journey with these kinds of people? Would you invest so much effort and funds on a formula destined to fail?Or was that the point? And was the Commander's final scene a reference to a 'Total Recall' twist?Additionally, I question the producers and their thought processes: What market were they hoping to tap into? I'm actually more curious about whether or not research indicated that scifi fans also watch worthless shows like Big Brother or The Housewives Of Fill-In-The-Blank?Would dismiss the suggestion outright as pure absurdity, if I hadn't seen wrestling on the SciFi Channel. Which I can honestly say is one of the most surreal moments of so-called entertainment I have ever experienced.Clearly some freakishly twisted Venn diagram suggests the scifi/fantasy community and wrestling fans share some commonality. But I honestly cannot imagine what it could be.Seriously - wrestling?!&lt;shrug>So perhaps there was the tiniest iota of an idea here after all. But I can't conceive of what that might be.And even though the character clich&eacute;s were numerous, I did enjoy the production values, which were really good. No surprise as I'm a fan of Ronald Moore and Michael Taylor, the guys behind the rebooted 'Battlestar Galactica' and 'Caprica'. But I can't in good conscience say ""I liked the show"" just because it looked nice.Overall, one can see the pair attempting a similar effort as BSG, but most of the characters of Virtuality were not accessible, too damaged, or flat-out too abrasive to engage. Could they have turned it around, smoothed out the edges? Maybe. If so, the cast deserved at least that chance.Note:- Cast member Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (as the Mission Commander) would find much greater success in the past. You might've heard of this show, 'Game of Thrones'.",2,Cast Too Damaged Or Just Ignorantly Abrasive,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,3611,"['Intended', 'pilot', 'new', 'series', 'tv', 'movie', 'tested', 'very', 'poorly', 'was', ""n't"", 'picked', 'up', 'not', 'even', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'telling.Opens', '12-person', 'crew', 'set', 'attempt', 'humanity', 'first', 'interstellar', 'voyage', 'traveling', 'star', 'nearest', 'own', 'sun', 'catch', 'spaceship', 'Phaeton', 'associated', 'costs', 'have', 'been', 'sponsored', 'global', 'consortium', 'corporations', 'businesses', 'help', 'defray', 'investment', 'crew', 'mix', 'scientists', 'cultural', 'specialists', 'have', 'agreed', 'be', 'filmed', 'reality-television', 'style', 'ten-year', 'journey', 'captured', 'edited', 'broadcast', 'weekly', 'show', 'dependent', 'ratings', 'advertising.As', 'approach', 'final', 'countdown', 'go/no-go', 'decision', 'bizarre', 'multitude', 'problems', 'suddenly', 'crop', 'up', 'culminating', 'death', 'one', 'crew', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'a.k.a', 'bad', 'luck', 'there', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'Can', 'remaining', 'members', 'continue', 'scrutiny', 'cameras', 'stuck', 'space', 'decade', 'nowhere', 'go', 'escape', 'balancing', 'fear', 'one', 'mates', 'might', 'be', 'psychopathic', 'murderer', 'Sound', 'silly', 'Sort', 'bit', 'one', ""'Airport"", 'movies.Would', 'have', 'followed', 'show', 'No', 'exact', 'same', 'reason', 'why', 'detest', 'unreality', 'Big', 'Brother', '=', 'contrived', 'drama', 'participation', 'self-indulgent', 'narcissists', 'be', 'fair', 'fictional', 'crew', 'space', 'travelers', ""'Virtuality"", 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'typical', 'conniving', 'megalomaniacs', 'normally', 'populate', 'such', 'programs', 'small', 'comfort', 'ways', ""'re"", 'worse.Reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'understand', 'imagine', 'how', 'most', 'crew', 'were', 'selected', 'As', 'many', 'third', 'have', 'noticeable', 'personality', 'disorders', 'others', 'seem', 'borderline', 'incompetent', 'Would', 'anyone', 'really', 'stock', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'kinds', 'people', 'Would', 'invest', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'funds', 'formula', 'destined', 'fail', 'was', 'point', 'was', 'Commander', 'final', 'scene', 'reference', ""'Total"", 'Recall', 'twist', 'Additionally', 'question', 'producers', 'thought', 'processes', 'What', 'market', 'were', 'hoping', 'tap', ""'m"", 'actually', 'more', 'curious', 'not', 'research', 'indicated', 'scifi', 'fans', 'also', 'watch', 'worthless', 'shows', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Housewives', 'Fill-In-The-Blank', 'Would', 'dismiss', 'suggestion', 'outright', 'pure', 'absurdity', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'wrestling', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'Which', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'surreal', 'moments', 'so-called', 'entertainment', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced.Clearly', 'freakishly', 'twisted', 'Venn', 'diagram', 'scifi/fantasy', 'community', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'share', 'commonality', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'what', 'could', 'be.Seriously', 'wrestling', 'lt', 'shrug', '>', 'So', 'perhaps', 'was', 'tiniest', 'iota', 'idea', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'conceive', 'what', 'might', 'be.And', 'even', 'character', 'clich', 'eacute', 'were', 'numerous', 'did', 'enjoy', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'No', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Ronald', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Taylor', 'guys', 'rebooted', 'Galactica', ""'Caprica"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'say', 'liked', 'show', 'just', 'looked', 'nice.Overall', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'pair', 'attempting', 'similar', 'effort', 'BSG', 'most', 'characters', 'Virtuality', 'were', 'not', 'accessible', 'too', 'damaged', 'flat-out', 'too', 'abrasive', 'engage', 'Could', 'have', 'turned', 'smoothed', 'out', 'edges', 'Maybe', 'so', 'cast', 'deserved', 'least', 'chance.Note', 'Cast', 'member', 'Nikolaj', 'Coster-Waldau', 'Mission', 'Commander', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'greater', 'success', 'past', 'might', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'show', ""'Game"", 'Thrones']",Virtuality
