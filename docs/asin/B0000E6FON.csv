To me it seems the monarchy has been long overthrown, something about 500 years (even though the cars, clothing and so on are unchanged- you don't really see much of that world)and Japan is an isolated country with a repressive government that sounds to me something like what Cuba has these days. The assassins are out after the rebels (who seem to use a lot of violence although you won't see it)who oppose the government.I found the movie to be very depressing, a couple of characters even saying, ""Let's leave this country and find someplace to be happy"". The action/violence comes in spurts- most of it suprisingly not very bloody. Yumiko Shaku (who in her interview says she had no experience and only a week or so of practice before filming to get it) seems to be the best of the actors and have the best scenes in my opinion, without her work I don't know that I'd even want to see this movie again.When I played my copy I noticed that it seems to be set for English (the dubbing is very well done) but can be set for Japanese with English subtitles, there's no closed captioning but you can use the subtitle function with the English dubbing if you need it as a substitute. The extras include some bloopers and behind the scenes things and some cast/ crew interviews. Most of these are in Japanese with English subtitling although Donnie Yen (the action choreographer) does his bit in English with Japanese subtitling.",3,It's interesting but I won't watch it often,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1483,"['did', ""n't"", 'story', 'be', 'quite', 'way', 'Amazon', 'monarchy', 'been', 'long', 'overthrown', 'something', '500', 'years', 'even', 'cars', 'clothing', 'so', 'are', 'unchanged-', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'much', 'world', 'Japan', 'isolated', 'country', 'repressive', 'government', 'something', 'what', 'Cuba', 'days', 'assassins', 'are', 'out', 'rebels', 'who', 'seem', 'use', 'lot', 'violence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'who', 'oppose', 'government.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'depressing', 'couple', 'characters', 'even', 'saying', 'Let', 'leave', 'country', 'find', 'someplace', 'be', 'happy', 'action/violence', 'spurts-', 'most', 'suprisingly', 'not', 'very', 'bloody', 'Shaku', 'who', 'interview', 'had', 'experience', 'only', 'week', 'so', 'practice', 'filming', 'get', 'be', 'best', 'actors', 'have', 'best', 'scenes', 'opinion', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'even', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'again.When', 'played', 'copy', 'noticed', 'be', 'set', 'English', 'dubbing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'be', 'set', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'closed', 'captioning', 'can', 'use', 'subtitle', 'function', 'English', 'dubbing', 'need', 'substitute', 'extras', 'include', 'bloopers', 'scenes', 'things', 'cast/', 'crew', 'interviews', 'Most', 'are', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitling', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'action', 'choreographer', 'bit', 'English', 'Japanese', 'subtitling']",N/A

781532,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B0000E6FON,Duane Thomas,"[12, 15]","The Princess Blade is a homage to an infinitely better movie, 1973's Lady Snowblood. It's not like they try to hide that fact - it's a homage, not a rip-off. The Japanese name of both films, Shurayuki-hime, is identical, and the two main characters even have the same name, Yuki. In Japanese, ""Shura"" is a Buddhist term very like ""Hell"" or ""netherworld,"" a place of violence and carnage. ""Yuki"" mean ""snow"" and is a common girl's name. ""Hime"" means ""princess"" or ""lady."" ""Shurayuki-hime"" is also a play on ""Shirayuki-hime,"" the Japanese name for Snow White. All this according to the movie notes on the Lady Snowblood DVD.In Lady Snowblood, in Meiji Japan the titular character is the child of a woman whose husband and son are murdered by a band of thugs. After the murders, the wife is raped and tortured by the killers for three days. Surviving that ordeal, she dedicates herself to tracking and killing the people responsible. She offs the first one but is then captured and jailed. Dying in prison in childbirth, she charges - some would say curses - her infant daughter to finish the job when she's old enough. For what it is, this is an extraordinarily well done film. Even with all the extreme violence and second-rate actors overdoing their death throes as they spurt buckets of fake blood we'd expect from a Seventies Japanese samurai flick, there are also moments in Lady Snowblood that are eerily beautiful.In The Princess Blade, in that unspecified near-future time so beloved of low-budget sci-fi, Yuki's mother is the leader of a gang of assassins. Betrayed by one of her own, she's also tortured for three days, but in this case doesn't survive the experience. The daughter, unaware how her mother died - she's only two years old at the time - becomes a member of the gang herself. Not until she's almost 20 does she discover the gang leader is also her mother's murderer. After trying and failing to kill him, she runs for her life and the movie proceeds from there.If I may be allowed to seemingly digress for a moment: I believe that most people - unless they absolutely hate a particular type of movie - will enjoy any film, of any genre, as long as it's well done. Look at all the people not previously fans of anime who loved Ghost In the Shell. The Princess Blade is low-budget, hyper-violent, Japanese chop-socky. It's well enough done that if you're already a fan of such movies, you'll probably enjoy it. However, unlike Lady Snowblood, The Princess Blade is not well enough done to have crossover appeal, i.e. it just won't do it for people not already predisposed to like this sort of film.If you're a genre fan, I'd say of The Princess Blade, go for it. If not, and you just have an idle interest in watching a good low-budget Japanese flick with a sword-wielding female assassin as the main character, I suggest passing on The Princess Blade and watching Lady Snowblood instead (now available in an absolutely superb DVD transfer, by the way). You'll enjoy the experience immensely more.",2,This Lady Snowblood Doesn't Fly,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,3017,"['Princess', 'Blade', 'homage', 'infinitely', 'better', 'movie', '1973', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'not', 'try', 'hide', 'fact', 'homage', 'not', 'rip-off', 'Japanese', 'name', 'films', 'Shurayuki-hime', 'identical', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'even', 'have', 'same', 'name', 'Yuki', 'Japanese', 'Shura', 'Buddhist', 'term', 'very', 'Hell', 'netherworld', 'place', 'violence', 'carnage', 'Yuki', 'mean', 'snow', 'common', 'girl', 'name', 'Hime', 'princess', 'lady', 'Shurayuki-hime', 'also', 'play', 'Shirayuki-hime', 'Japanese', 'name', 'Snow', 'White', 'according', 'movie', 'notes', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'DVD.In', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'Meiji', 'Japan', 'titular', 'character', 'child', 'woman', 'husband', 'son', 'are', 'murdered', 'band', 'thugs', 'murders', 'wife', 'raped', 'tortured', 'killers', 'three', 'days', 'Surviving', 'ordeal', 'tracking', 'killing', 'people', 'responsible', 'offs', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'captured', 'jailed', 'Dying', 'prison', 'childbirth', 'would', 'say', 'curses', 'infant', 'daughter', 'finish', 'job', 'when', 'old', 'enough', 'what', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'Even', 'extreme', 'violence', 'second-rate', 'actors', 'overdoing', 'death', 'throes', 'spurt', 'buckets', 'fake', 'blood', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Seventies', 'Japanese', 'samurai', 'flick', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'are', 'eerily', 'Princess', 'Blade', 'unspecified', 'near-future', 'time', 'so', 'beloved', 'low-budget', 'sci-fi', 'Yuki', 'mother', 'leader', 'gang', 'assassins', 'Betrayed', 'one', 'own', 'also', 'tortured', 'three', 'days', 'case', ""n't"", 'survive', 'experience', 'daughter', 'unaware', 'how', 'mother', 'died', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'member', 'gang', 'Not', 'almost', '20', 'discover', 'gang', 'leader', 'also', 'mother', 'murderer', 'trying', 'failing', 'kill', 'life', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'there.If', 'may', 'be', 'allowed', 'seemingly', 'digress', 'moment', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'particular', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'genre', 'as', 'long', 'well', 'done', 'Look', 'people', 'not', 'previously', 'fans', 'anime', 'who', 'loved', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Princess', 'Blade', 'low-budget', 'hyper-violent', 'Japanese', 'chop-socky', 'well', 'enough', 'done', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'such', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'However', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'Princess', 'Blade', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'done', 'have', 'crossover', 'appeal', 'i.e', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'people', 'not', 'already', 'predisposed', 'like', 'sort', 'film.If', ""'re"", 'genre', 'fan', ""'d"", 'say', 'Princess', 'Blade', 'go', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'idle', 'interest', 'watching', 'good', 'low-budget', 'Japanese', 'flick', 'sword-wielding', 'female', 'assassin', 'main', 'character', 'suggest', 'passing', 'Princess', 'Blade', 'watching', 'Lady', 'Snowblood', 'instead', 'now', 'available', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'way', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'experience', 'immensely', 'more']",N/A

The sound was pretty clear in all the fight scenes, lots of squishing, swishing, and bone crunching.  The picture was crystal clear and absolutely lovely.  The cinematography was a bit confusing, as characters appeared to move from mine to forest to lake to desert to urban industrial region all within the space of one camera-fade, running no less.  Some of the forest scenes could have been filmed in the exact same place, even though they were supposed to be different.  It was disorienting, and led to this spacial disconnection while watching.The first scene of this movie mesmerized me.  The first strike of this assasin clan was violent, but the violence was slick and stylized.  The use of blades rather than guns was really sexy.  The rest of the fight scenes, about four, were also really well done, exciting and tense, and much less stylized.  They ranged from just violent to flat out gory.  Extremely impressive coreography! After that moment, however, The Princess Blade lost momentum.  So many plot points remained cloudy and confusing, as did the character relationships.  Who was Takashi, and what was he doing in this movie besides providing a gratioutous appearance by Hideaki Ito (not that I didn't appreciate his appearance).  Ito did a good job, but Takashi's character seemed superflous to me, as did his whole subplot.  Terrorism?  Cause? What did that have to do with anything else in this movie?

Having been a long time fan of samurai films, anime, sci-fi and martial arts films this just seemed almost too good to be true. The story is set in a nameless country in a desolate war torn future that acts somewhat like a bridge between George Orwell''s ""1984"" and feudal Japan. In this isolated country ruled by a facist government rebels are delt with by one of the last remaining houses of nobles, a clan of assassins, that hold loyalty only to money. The last heir to this house is a young girl whom is soon to turn 20 (the age of adulthood in Japan), at which point she must choose between succeding to head of the house or to leave and disolve the house. When she learns that sensei had her mother and father murdered she tries to flee, only to be hunted by her former friends and household. Wounded and alone she finds refuge with a man whom leads a double life as a terrorist against the government.What ensues is a vibrant display of wild swordplay, dramatic character development, bittersweet romance, tragedy, and the coming to terms with ones' self. In this regaurd the ""Princess Blade"" nearly hits every mark. My only complaint is with the ending, while poetic I still thought it should have been diffrent. Fine preformances on all parts. And a energetic, if not a tad repetitive, musical score.If you are expecting the same calibure as Akira Kurosawa than this film will only serve to dissipoint you.

Now maybe these movies are like really common, but I need a story that is at least explainable. But the good news is that the drama is great.  The comedy is really funny even though sparingly used.  The action is done in a very hong kong type of style.  Not what I swas expecting, cuause that is like what I always watch, but good none the less.  I could have used a lttle more action, btu man was it spectacular.  The wire work is noticeable, but not to make that actors look better, rather to show what happens when you get REAL athletes on wires.  The fighting is VERY real throughout the whole film, and even though I like really bloody stuff, I thought this just hit the spot, but went a tad too extreme midway through.  Not complaining, just warnign people it is rated R for a reason.  But seriosly this movie is a 5/5.  The story just needed to be A LOT better.  Great acting, just no story.  But I remember one scene in particular where the princess is taking on like 7 people all by herself, and the action is just seriously second to none.  Add in like 5 other scenes that almost, just almost match that one.  Wow what a violently spectacular film.  WHEW, now that I got that point across, I can discuss the actual movie.  OH BTW, I did see AT LEAST one of donnie's kicks in here, so look closely:)So the story is about a japanese girl who is part of a team of assasins.  I guess that assasins rule the world by killing people who are uprising or something in this.  But anyway, the girl in this movie is like the last of her blood line and once she rebels, the other assasins want to kill her.  It talks briefly how she is descended form like LONG ago and this is of great importance.  But the part that captured me was the dark mood of the movie.  the story is not good, but the huuman conflict going on is a very good movie watchign experience for anyone.  There is a subplot which turn even darker at teh end.  But overall, a wonderful movie.  Also the music is great and really helps to capture the mood.Now I have the adv films dvd and have to disagree with the pervious reviewer and say that the english dub sucks.  The japanese track is AWESOME and is full of all types of emotion.  If he would haev said it was better than most, I would have agreed, cause it certainly was!

781543,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B0000E6FON,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[33, 35]","The Princess Blade is a decent film, and packs a fair punch into the modern Samurai style film genre.The film centers around a young woman, Yuki, who starts off as an assasin for the House of Takemikazuchi.(a clan of X royal guards turned assasins for money)  She turns on her house however, when she discovers that her mother was killed by the House years earlier. Yuki's mother had been a royal figure in a disbanded kingdom, which leaves Yuki as the only remaining aire and the title of Princess. (Thus the reason for the flims name)  Yuki soon finds herself hunted by her former comrades, and she must battle them to save herself, as well as get revenge for her mother.At one point Yuki is wounded in one of the skimishes, and is befriended by Takashi, a young man who is in an insurrectional movement to overthrow the goverment that funds the Takemikazuchi.  Takashi shares Yuki's peril of having a tragic history, which is revealed during the film. He also has a sister who is in a post tramatic state which causes her to be detached somewhat from reality.  Yuki hides out with the two for awhile and begins to discover that she can again find happiness in her life.  Eventually however, she is tracked down by the Takemikazuchi, and must fight them in one final showdown.The Princess blade was a good film both in story and in character development.  The sword fights are well choregraphed, and the actors performances bring a genuine concern for the characters in the story.  Also, there are a lot of similarities to Kill Bill, which was based in part on modern Japanese Smaurai style cinema.The film does have a tragic ending however, and leads me to believe that a sequal was in mind when this film was made.(it may not be the ending the viewer is rooting for)  Also, like in many Japanese films, the stroy slows down quite a bit during the middle, which left me begging for a few more sword fights.  That being the main reason for a 4 instead of a 5 star rating.  The film is not as action packed as Versuses, but it's less gorey, and takes itself much more seriously.The tech aspects include both a Japanese and English dubbed language track,(ADV does a nice job on the dub) trailers of other films and that's about it.Overall I enjoyed THe Princess Blade, and would watch it again. But I doubt it's a movie that I would want to watch frequently.  My advice is that renting it will suffice for most people, but hard core fans of Japanese cinema and modern Samurai style films might consider purchasing it.

At least Segal's movies have better plots and better storylines.I hate the way Princess Blade tricks the audience during the opening scene. In the opening, a man shoots bullets at her and she dodges the bullets by doing a slow motion, Martrix style, somersault flip. BUT THAT IS THE SINGLE ONLY TIME SHE DOES THAT TYPE OF MOVE ! In the rest of the movie, she does regular fighting without any special camera effects ! So don't be fooled by what you see in the beginning, this is just another very low budget kung-fu movie.Another complaint of mine, is a scene where she had been injured and started to bleed (a lot).

781550,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0000E6FON,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 3]","THE PRINCESS BLADE (a.k.a. Shirayuki Hime) is based on the manga by Kazou Koike with the same name.  The film is not a remake of the Japanese classic; ""Lady Snowblood"" (Lady Snowblood greatly influenced Tarantino's Kill Bill) but rather a tribute film to that classic. The film is a post-apocalyptic vision of the future; however, it does successfully preserve the essence and motif of Japanese samurai films. Director Shinsuke Sato's vision on the manga is very interesting as his execution deals with typical samurai films in a futuristic vision of an industrialized Japan.The House of Takemikazuchi is a clan of assassins. Due to modernization and the majority of people with undesirable lives, these once noble warriors are now assassins for hire who will kill anyone for the right price. There is no way one may relinquish ties to the clan. Yuki (Yumiko Shaku, SKY HIGH), an orphan who was raised by the clan is among the best killers among them. Unbeknownst to her, she is the true heir to the Takemikazuchi bloodline. One day, she was told by a stranger that her mother; Princess Azora was killed by Byakurai, the current clan leader. She tries to kill him but fails. Forced to flee, and to fight for her survival against her brethren; Yuki comes across Takashi, a young activist leader and finds comfort in his company. Meanwhile, her past threatens to catch up to her as Byakurai plots to hunt her and down and kill her.At first impression, one may think that ""Princess Blade"" is a Jidai Geki swordplay spectacle but in truth, this film is a bit slower paced than most Japanese action flicks such as Versus. There is a hint of existentialism in its plot; this film carries more of the ""samurai"" essence in past films and focuses more in its humanity. ""Hime"" does give a hint of the samurai philosophy and characteristics; such as nobility, loyalty, allegiance and honor. When watching ""Hime"", please consider a modern feudal Japan with characters seeking isolation. Samurai usually are willing to die for his beliefs/ideals with honor as the road to glory, Yuki, upon her discovery of the truth and her betrayal finds something more worthwhile to live for; she discovers something more to her life than her past killing ways. Her meeting with Takashi (Hideaki Ito) after an attack, allows Yuki to appreciate a peaceful existence as they discover each other's lives. Takashi serves as a conscience for Yuki as he once performed some assassinations in the form of terrorism against the state; he questions her moral beliefs when he finds out her links to the House of Takemikazuchi. I believe this approach is a nice touch since it takes the film from a simple revenge premise to a warmer one of one's desire to escape their past choices to happier and warmer pastures.The action/swordplay choreography by Donnie Yen raises the expectations of the action fanatic. His choreography is quite inventive as he mixes in almost anime-like posturing with the usual chaotic swordplay. The Donnie Yen touch is omnipresent in each duel with each ascending and sliding sword strokes; grappling is even used in close quarters with superb execution that shows ferocity. However, even with the sheer intensity of the action footages, one may notice and give comparison to previous samurai films; the KATANA sword is NOT a one-handed sword. Yen choreographs the scenes with the usual wire-fu at times and the mentioned Katana swords are sometimes wielded like a one-handed flat TAI-CHI sword whose concept is to wound an opponent before a kill. This presents a little inaccuracy in the sequences. However exciting the swordplay sequences may be, they aren't without fault and I've definitely seen better ones executed in other modern chambara films such as AZUMI and ARAGAMI.""Princess Blade"" may not be a perfect film but it does offer interesting concepts of redemption and gives homage to past samurai period films. The director may have become a bit over-ambiguous with his views of way too many topics and philosophical issues that the proceedings seem to lose their intensity and the film almost stops to a crawl around the middle. With its darker setting and the post-apocalyptic atmospheric feel, the themes of samurai films by Kurosawa and Inagaki are still the main ingredients. Fans expecting a non-stop action spectacle may be a bit disappointed; as with most Japanese films it leans more towards its humanity and focuses on its philosophy. Still, the gorgeous visuals with the action choreography do create a unique experience for samurai aficionados.RECOMMENDED! [3  stars]I have the region-3 release from IVL with Anamorphically Enhanced picture transfer. The U.S. release is Letterboxed and carries a Japanese Language track as well as an English Dubbed track.
