1677290,A3T0A0NM8636JW,B00G7QPXAI,"Amazon Customer ""Book lover and illustrator""","[1, 1]","This movie does focus on ""Pride and prejudice"", but if you are a period drama aficionado ( guilty as charged !!! )  you will find it  hilarious as it parodies the production of all those mini series we adore so much.Some critics have ripped this movie to shreds claiming it had huge potential for deep social satire and profound look into the nature of human beings and so on, a potential that was missed with the film being a mere romanic comedy . Perhaps, but when looking on this film as a romantic comedy, and not expecting it to be a ""life changing"" experience, you end up with a delightful, refreshing re-telling of pride and prejudice.One might claim that Austen's writing is basically the 19 century romantic comedy - we have two people destined to be in love -they may not see it at first, all sorts of osbtacles may delay their happily ever after, but true love and wedding bells are waiting for them at the end of their novel. Is that so deep, insightful and life changing? No, And yet Austen is one of the most popular authors ever, and people still enjoy and appreciate her work. The beginning is a bit slow and awkward, but don't stop watching - it gets better.  And As far as romantic comedy goes there were a  few very surprising plot twists, which I TOTALLY DID NOT SEE COMING.( no spoilers )  Surprise is a sensation one seldom experiences when watching  rom com,  so I was doubly delighted and surprised to the extent that I needed to watch the film again.Jane Hayes (  the Lovely Keri Russell )  is 30 something single woman, unlucky in love, mainly because she is obsessed with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy from ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Unsatisfied with modern romance, Jane spends her entire savings on a ""life changing"" vacation at an Austen themed resort, complete with the  English Manor house setting,  regency era costumes and manners, and ,of course, trained  actors to play the gentleman for every guest's Austen's fantasy. Jane arrives to Austenland, brimming with excitement, but quickly discovers that the authenticity of her Austen experience is somewhat over what she would have liked - due to the fact that she could afford only the basic package and other guests have paid much more for the deluxe one, she is treated in a snobbish way by the resort proprietor, presented as a poor orphan with no prospects, and is given a rather drab wardrobe while the others wear fabulous gowns.And Thus - our story begins: we have the poor, yet beautiful and worthy heroine, strolling along beautiful English gardens. We're just missing our Mr. Darcy - This is when the fun begins and we're introduced to the resort's staff and guests, bad actors with outrageously fake upper class manners and accents, pretending to be part of fantasy world of proper ladies and gallant gentleman. I found that part to be so amusing, how they parody OTHER ACTORS in those type of productions. Most Notable is  the dashing Mr. Nobley's ( JJ Field ) over the top boredom and disgust with the human race as he totally ripped off Firth's iconic performance. Bravo :)  A very clever use of Modern soundtrack accentuate the absurd clash between our ordinary world and the pompousness of the fantasy world. Keep watching the closing titles for a last bit of comedy :)",4,"A feast for ALL period drama fans, not just Jane Austen's",1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,3261,"['movie', 'focus', 'Pride', 'prejudice', 'are', 'period', 'drama', 'aficionado', 'guilty', 'charged', 'will', 'find', 'hilarious', 'production', 'mini', 'series', 'adore', 'so', 'much.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'ripped', 'movie', 'shreds', 'claiming', 'had', 'huge', 'potential', 'deep', 'social', 'satire', 'profound', 'look', 'nature', 'human', 'beings', 'so', 'potential', 'was', 'missed', 'film', 'being', 'mere', 'romanic', 'comedy', 'Perhaps', 'when', 'looking', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'end', 'up', 'delightful', 'refreshing', 're-telling', 'pride', 'prejudice.One', 'might', 'claim', 'Austen', 'writing', 'basically', '19', 'century', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'have', 'two', 'people', 'destined', 'be', 'love', '-they', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'first', 'sorts', 'osbtacles', 'may', 'delay', 'happily', 'ever', 'true', 'love', 'wedding', 'bells', 'are', 'waiting', 'end', 'novel', 'so', 'deep', 'insightful', 'life', 'changing', 'No', 'yet', 'Austen', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'authors', 'ever', 'people', 'still', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'work', 'beginning', 'bit', 'slow', 'awkward', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'better', 'As', 'far', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'were', 'few', 'very', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'TOTALLY', 'DID', 'NOT', 'SEE', 'COMING', 'spoilers', 'Surprise', 'sensation', 'one', 'seldom', 'experiences', 'when', 'watching', 'rom', 'com', 'was', 'doubly', 'delighted', 'surprised', 'extent', 'needed', 'watch', 'film', 'again.Jane', 'Hayes', 'Lovely', 'Keri', 'Russell', '30', 'something', 'single', 'woman', 'unlucky', 'love', 'mainly', 'obsessed', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Unsatisfied', 'modern', 'romance', 'Jane', 'entire', 'savings', 'life', 'changing', 'vacation', 'Austen', 'themed', 'resort', 'complete', 'English', 'Manor', 'house', 'setting', 'regency', 'era', 'costumes', 'manners', 'course', 'trained', 'actors', 'play', 'gentleman', 'guest', 'Austen', 'fantasy', 'Jane', 'Austenland', 'brimming', 'excitement', 'quickly', 'discovers', 'authenticity', 'Austen', 'experience', 'somewhat', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'due', 'fact', 'could', 'afford', 'only', 'basic', 'package', 'other', 'guests', 'have', 'paid', 'much', 'more', 'deluxe', 'one', 'treated', 'snobbish', 'way', 'resort', 'proprietor', 'presented', 'poor', 'orphan', 'prospects', 'given', 'rather', 'drab', 'wardrobe', 'others', 'wear', 'fabulous', 'gowns.And', 'Thus', 'story', 'have', 'poor', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'worthy', 'heroine', 'strolling', 'along', 'beautiful', 'English', 'gardens', ""'re"", 'just', 'missing', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'when', 'fun', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'resort', 'staff', 'guests', 'bad', 'actors', 'outrageously', 'fake', 'upper', 'class', 'manners', 'accents', 'pretending', 'be', 'part', 'fantasy', 'world', 'proper', 'ladies', 'gallant', 'gentleman', 'found', 'part', 'be', 'so', 'amusing', 'how', 'parody', 'OTHER', 'ACTORS', 'type', 'productions', 'Most', 'Notable', 'dashing', 'Mr.', 'Nobley', 'JJ', 'Field', 'top', 'boredom', 'disgust', 'human', 'race', 'totally', 'ripped', 'off', 'Firth', 'iconic', 'performance', 'Bravo', 'very', 'clever', 'use', 'Modern', 'soundtrack', 'accentuate', 'absurd', 'clash', 'ordinary', 'world', 'pompousness', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Keep', 'watching', 'closing', 'titles', 'last', 'bit', 'comedy']",N/A

1677297,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00G7QPXAI,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 9]","I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a Jane Austen aficionado or anything, but I enjoy her stories.  Not all of them, and there is a moment when they all start to blend into one another and I can&#8217;t tell them apart, but in the hands of a strong directorial voice, they can become something special.  That being said, I know some people who are obsessed with her.  In fact, I know more than some.  I know a couple that has a room in their home dedicated to her work, with paintings of her on the wall, all her books on the shelf (multiple versions and editions, hard and soft, mint condition and tattered) as well as costumes on dress hangers in the corner of the room.  They also attend those Jane Austen festivals every year (I can&#8217;t remember the name of them) in full garb, and despite being as American as they come, they try their hardest to pull off an English accent while in character.I&#8217;ll never get it, but then again, I secretly envy their fearless desire for fun.&#8216;Austenland&#8217; kind of pokes fun at people like them, exposing their cluttered obsessions and then trying to berate their need for a true fantasy romance, and yet at the other end it kind of panders to them as well, providing a happy ending we all saw coming (sort of) and making the obsession kind of rewarding.When my wife and I saw the preview for this months ago while waiting for &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; to start we both knew that we would see it.  I mean, my wife is kind of in love with Jane Seymour, and we both agree that Jennifer Coolidge should be in every comedy.  Besides, the outlandish nature of the subject just seemed ripe for comedy.  Look at &#8216;Best in Show&#8217;.  Making fun of human obsessions can really pay off in the end.This is no &#8216;Best in Show&#8217;.I kind of knew that going in, but a boy can dream.  That isn&#8217;t to say that &#8216;Austenland&#8217; doesn&#8217;t have some sort of payoff, and it did make me laugh, but the end result isn&#8217;t as satisfying as I would have wished for.  Instead of taking the risk of actually playing out like a straight up parody of the Austen world, &#8216;Austenland&#8217; suffers from turning itself into a modern-day adaptation of her work, and is so concerned with appearing clever in that shift that it winds up deflating its sails a bit and coming across kind of flat.The film tells the story of Jane Hayes, a desperate woman approaching the end of her child bearing years that is still single and searching for her Mr. Darcy.  The reason she is still single is because her bedroom is a shrine to Jane Austen and she&#8217;s kind of a freak (more on that in a minute).  So, at the peak of her desperation, she decides to blow her life savings on a trip to Austenland, a place that promises a true Austen experience complete with a fairytale romance and &#8216;engagement&#8217; at the end.  Upon arriving, her dreams are crushed by the snobbish Mrs. Wattlesbrook, the owner of Austenland.  She is obviously disgusted with Jane&#8217;s lack of funds (Jane purchased the Copper Package, not the Platinum Package) and because of this she is treated like dirt.  She almost instantly sees the ridiculousness of her personal dreams, finding the antics unfulfilling and seeking solace in her doodling and the arms of the help, Martin, who seems to find the whole thing pretty dumb as well.But then there is the illusive Mr. Henry Nobley, Jane&#8217;s dream man and the essential &#8216;Mr. Darcy&#8217; of the establishment.  He&#8217;s handsome, reserved, snarky and strangely charming and he seems to strike up real chemistry with Jane.But is any of it real?The knock to reality television and delusional obsessions is obvious, and yet it is never explored deeply enough to be a good character study.  Sadly, the film doesn&#8217;t do anything well enough to be anything more than confused.  It isn&#8217;t romantic enough to be a Jane Austen adaptation and it isn&#8217;t funny enough to be a remarkable comedy or parody.  Instead, it does all things moderately well and becomes an uneven film that could have been something more but settled for being acceptably mediocre.  The supporting cast is pretty great though, with Coolidge, Seymour and Georgia King delivering some hilarious portraits of women caught up in the act.  Coolidge plays the same character in every film, but she does it so well!  King&#8217;s whole &#8216;come hither&#8217; scene is the best in the film, and that ridiculous outdoor play is a true highlight.  Still, I can&#8217;t help but feel that the film&#8217;s resolve is a tad obvious in retrospect, and the film&#8217;s inability to decide what it wants to be makes it feel underwhelming.And I have a serious issue with the normality of Jane Hayes.  She&#8217;s far too normal to be portrayed as that obsessive.  It doesn&#8217;t make sense.  It isn&#8217;t believable at all.  Her room is utterly ridiculous and all the Austen paraphernalia doesn&#8217;t jive with who she is, which is nothing more than a shy bookworm.  It was obvious that the screenwriter, Jerusha Hess, was unsure of how far she wanted to go with this.For me, she didn&#8217;t go far enough.",3,Halfway there...,1392768000,"02 19,

I own multiple versions of every Jane Austen movie -- Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, Emma, Mansfield Park, Northhanger Abbey;  iterations like Miss Austen Regrets. And I've seen most of the modernized versions like Clueless & Bridget Jones' Diary. As an English lit major & Jane Austen movie mega-fan who watches them over & over & over again, I enjoyed this movie. Was it silly? Yes. Over the top? Yes. But I seriously laughed out loud numerous times until tears were streaming down my face. This film is a parody of Jane Austen films; it's making fun of the drama, the costumes, the high brow language, the formal rituals, the balls. The main character owns a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr. Darcy & spends her life savings to go to Austenland to find romance -- a real Mr. Darcy. Throughout the film, the funny dialogue and ridiculous scenes like &#34;couldn't you use a handkerchief?!&#34; when the guy tears off his shirt to assist the fair lady are fun to watch. This is NOT a high-quality romantic drama like the other Jane Austen films (especially the exceptional BBC versions/Masterpiece Theater collection). If you don't really know Jane Austen books & movies, you won't &#34;get this&#34; and will just think it's badly acted and possibly dumb. But that's the point. That women fall in love with Mr. Darcy & want it all to be real. Could it be real? We find out what it might be like if we tried to reenact a Jane Austen movie today.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[8, 10]","Unlike a lot of women, I don't really hold up Mr. Darcy as the absolute perfect dream guy -- Mr. Tilney is more my speed.But there's a breed of Austen fans (call them Darcy Fetishists) hold up Darcy and the Regency world as the ultimate standard of romance. One such is the lead of ""Austenland,"" a romcom about a place where people can fulfill their Regency fantasies... and it's too bad the clunky middle section and cartoonishly illogical characters drag it down.Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) is allegedly the biggest Austen freak in existence, although she seems uninterested in everything Austen except romance and Mr. Darcy (as depicted by Colin Firth). Forget the social commentary, proto-feminism and all non-Darcy men! She is so obsessed that every relationship she has comes up short... so unsurprisingly, she jumps at the chance to go to a theme resort known as Austenland.And at first it seems like a dream come true -- guests wear period clothing, do period activities, and even get a staged romance. Then she becomes the focus of a love triangle with the shy, gruff Mr. Nobley (JJ Feild) and the charming servant Martin (Bret McKenzie). The lines between fantasy and reality begin to blur, and Jane begins to realize that her ideal man must be one in the REAL world.""Austenland"" has a cute premise, albeit one as light and fluffy as meringue. It's fairly obvious how some parts of it are going to play out -- really, does anyone expect Jane NOT to find her dream guy in this resort? -- but the amusement comes from watching Jane discover that playing at Regency romance is not as satisfying as the real thing, and her bumbles along the way. For instance, she discovers that being a Regency-era lady was kinda boring, since they were expected to sit indoors and sew.Unfortunately, Jerusha Hess's direction is mediocre. The entire movie grinds to a crawl in the second act, where we're treated to the characters just meandering around, not doing anything. There are a few clever nods to Austen's books (the play, the old naval flame) which seem to go completely over Jane's head (since those books didn't star Mr. Darcy), but the cleverness drowns in a sea of much more obvious, crude humor.Keri Russell is fairly likable as Jane, and adds an earnest likability to the role... which is good, because Jane herself has the intellectual capacity of a clever cabbage. But JJ Feild and Bret McKenzie are very charming, both as a stern, awkward Darcy-type and as a handsome gardener -- although if you've EVER seen ""Pride and Prejudice,"" you will see the twist coming several miles away.The problem is, everybody who ISN'T in the love triangle is an idiotic cartoon, devoid of the slightest hint of depth. Jennifer Coolidge is utterly wasted as a crude, man-hungry bimbo who doesn't know the first thing about Austen (raising the question of WHY she came there), and the other characters have exactly one character trait and nothing more -- the closeted gay man, the pervert, the stuck-up owner, the vindictive blonde. It's as if Hess can only make Jane likable if she makes everyone else a blithering moron or a jerk.""Austenland"" is only saved from being awful by a solid central cast, despite wasting the supporting one -- watch it for JJ Feild and Bret McKenzie in breeches, and try to ignore everyone else.",3,"Or, Memoirs of a Darcy Fetishist",1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,3311,"['lot', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'absolute', 'perfect', 'dream', 'guy', 'Mr.', 'Tilney', 'more', 'speed.But', 'breed', 'Austen', 'fans', 'call', 'Darcy', 'Fetishists', 'hold', 'up', 'Darcy', 'Regency', 'world', 'ultimate', 'standard', 'romance', 'One', 'such', 'lead', 'Austenland', 'romcom', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'fulfill', 'Regency', 'fantasies', 'too', 'bad', 'clunky', 'middle', 'section', 'cartoonishly', 'illogical', 'characters', 'drag', 'down.Jane', 'Hayes', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'allegedly', 'biggest', 'Austen', 'freak', 'existence', 'uninterested', 'everything', 'Austen', 'romance', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'depicted', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Forget', 'social', 'commentary', 'proto-feminism', 'non-Darcy', 'men', 'so', 'obsessed', 'relationship', 'up', 'short', 'so', 'unsurprisingly', 'chance', 'go', 'theme', 'resort', 'known', 'Austenland.And', 'first', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'guests', 'wear', 'period', 'clothing', 'do', 'period', 'activities', 'even', 'get', 'staged', 'romance', 'Then', 'focus', 'love', 'triangle', 'shy', 'gruff', 'Mr.', 'Nobley', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'charming', 'servant', 'Martin', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'lines', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'begin', 'blur', 'Jane', 'realize', 'ideal', 'man', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'REAL', 'world', 'Austenland', 'cute', 'premise', 'albeit', 'one', 'light', 'fluffy', 'meringue', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'how', 'parts', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'really', 'anyone', 'expect', 'Jane', 'NOT', 'find', 'dream', 'guy', 'resort', 'amusement', 'watching', 'Jane', 'discover', 'playing', 'Regency', 'romance', 'not', 'as', 'satisfying', 'real', 'thing', 'bumbles', 'way', 'instance', 'being', 'Regency-era', 'lady', 'was', 'kinda', 'boring', 'were', 'expected', 'sit', 'indoors', 'sew.Unfortunately', 'Jerusha', 'Hess', 'direction', 'mediocre', 'entire', 'movie', 'crawl', 'second', 'act', 'where', ""'re"", 'treated', 'characters', 'just', 'meandering', 'around', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'are', 'few', 'clever', 'nods', 'Austen', 'books', 'play', 'old', 'naval', 'flame', 'seem', 'go', 'completely', 'Jane', 'head', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'star', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'cleverness', 'drowns', 'sea', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'crude', 'humor.Keri', 'Russell', 'fairly', 'likable', 'Jane', 'earnest', 'likability', 'role', 'good', 'Jane', 'intellectual', 'capacity', 'clever', 'cabbage', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'are', 'very', 'charming', 'stern', 'awkward', 'Darcy-type', 'handsome', 'gardener', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'seen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'will', 'see', 'twist', 'coming', 'several', 'miles', 'away.The', 'problem', 'everybody', 'who', ""N'T"", 'love', 'triangle', 'idiotic', 'cartoon', 'devoid', 'slightest', 'hint', 'depth', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'crude', 'man-hungry', 'bimbo', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'Austen', 'raising', 'question', 'WHY', 'came', 'there', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'exactly', 'one', 'character', 'trait', 'nothing', 'more', 'closeted', 'gay', 'man', 'pervert', 'stuck-up', 'owner', 'vindictive', 'blonde', 'Hess', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'Jane', 'likable', 'everyone', 'else', 'blithering', 'moron', 'jerk', 'Austenland', 'only', 'saved', 'being', 'awful', 'solid', 'central', 'cast', 'wasting', 'supporting', 'one', 'watch', 'JJ', 'Feild', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'breeches', 'try', 'ignore', 'everyone', 'else']",N/A

Jerusha Hess, 2013, 97 minutes, based on the novel by Shannon Hale) ~There can be no better, deeper or more profound comedy than that which forces us to peer into our deepest dreams ... only to force us to laugh heartily at them. There is no better comedy than a masterpiece of satire, done so delicately that feelings are real even when nothing else is. This film is IT.In this marvelously witty remake of ""Pride & Prejudice"", Keri Russell plays New Yorker Jane Hayes, a bigger Austen-head than me and my wife put together. Naturally she focuses on the beautifulPride and Prejudice (Restored Edition), fantasizing about actually finding and marrying a real-life Mr. Darcy (or is that Colin Firth she wants, and who can blame her if so?).Stumbling onto Austenland, a sort of theme park set in what is obviously a true English estate just outside London (it's the same estate that was Hanbury inCranford), Jane spends her last penny to go. It is her ultimate fantasy ... or is it? For that matter, is this movie throwing in nods toPersuasionor am I crazy?In the rancid, horrible place, a crazy old woman (a wonderful Jane Seymour) pushes her fantasy-seeking guests into the deepest crevices of the Regency Period. She hires the ""best actors"" to play Austen-type characters and promises every lady a proposal of marriage by the end of their stay. It was the funniest, tackiest thing I have seen since I saw my first John Waters film. The problem is, as one character says, there is danger in this kind of role-playing.What I find amazing is the way the role-playing professionals are actually parodying genuine actors ... which after all, everyone in this film is in real life! It's INSANE!!! And I will spoil this no further because you MUST not only see it but also own it. It is historic. The hilarious Jennifer Coolidge alone makes this worthwhile, but then so do the ""absent cameos"" by Colin Firth. (One is obvious but I defy you to catch the second.)I never saw actors have so much fun. I never thought anyone could parody the love for Jane Austen while simultaneously complementing her to the heavens--but AUSTENLAND does it with its queer, dopey characters and Goon Show style humor.

In this PG-13 cringe-worthy calamity, our fixated sweet thing finds a British theme tour devoted to All Things Austen, so thither she goes! In my personal opinion, this dame has a screw loose.Writer/director Jerusha Hess (&#34;Napoleon Dynamite&#34;) has assembled a sterling cast (numerous awards and honors), then subjected them (and us) to this lame offering.I blushed for:* Keri Russell (&#34;August Rush&#34;) is Jane, ready to spend her life savings just to experience a Jane Austen moment. Problem is, she can't afford the premium tour, so is assigned a small room in the servants' wing at Pemberly.* JJ Feild (&#34;Northanger Abbey&#34;) is Mr. Henry Nobley, who immediately starts giving off antagonistic vibes to our heroine (hint, hint). As you can see, Mr. F. already has credibility in an Austen story.* Jennifer Coolidge (Lots of TV) is Miss Elizabeth Charming, a daffy, obscenely rich guest at Pemberly. Not even Coolidge with her considerable talent could save this thing.* Jane Seymour (&#34;The Family Tree&#34;) is Mrs. Wattlesbrook, the proprietress of this ridiculous venture.

But impatient me decided to delay my reading, put the book down and watch the movie instead. If you have read the book, then be prepared for changes. That said, if you go in without expecting this to be exactly like the book, then you won't be disappointed.As a long time Austen fan, the story line instantly got me hooked. Jane Hayes, a 30-something, is obsessed with ""Pride & Prejudice,"" Jane Austen books and Mr. Darcy. Honestly, to the ladies who have seen the Colin Firth version from 1995, who could blame her? Jane decides to spend her savings on a fantasy-fulfilling vacation to ""Austenland"" - a place where she could transport herself to the Regency era and live like Elizabeth Bennet for a few weeks. She travels to England where she meets her hostess, Mrs. Waddlesbrook (Jane Seymour), and fellow guests Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge) and Amelia Heartwright (Georgia King).  Other members of their party are Col. Andrews (James Callis), Henry Nobley (JJ Feild) and Capt. East (Ricky Whittle). As Jane develops friendships with those in her party, she initially forms an attraction to the carefree and easygoing Martin the groomsman (Bret McKenzie). However, she also finds it difficult to avoid the attraction to Henry Nobley, who cuts a dashing and brooding Darcy-like figure. With this fantasy-world then comes a price - what happens when your fantasies become reality? And how do you know if it is real or a pretense?Fortunately, the movie ""Austenland"" adeptly balances Jane's growing romantic dilemma with some hilarious, laugh-out-loud comedy. There is the ""fish out of water"" element as American newbies Jane and Elizabeth (a nod to P&P;, for sure) dive into the pool of British Regency manners and customs, not to mention juggling the accents. This is where Jennifer Coolidge, James Callis and Georgia King often steal the scenes. There are many, many funny moments when any one of them are around.As the lead, Keri Russell does a great job as Jane. When she first arrives at Austenland, she is a hopeful young woman looking for her Mr. Darcy after one-too-many failed relationships. With the help of Elizabeth and her new friends, her confidence and self-worth grows and she learns to take charge of her fate. The romantic leads, JJ Feild and Bret McKenzie, are equally memorable. I have been a fan of JJ since his supporting role in James D'Arcy's version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" (my favorite version) and he earns extra kudos having played Henry Tilney in ITV's adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Northanger Abbey."" Bret will be familiar to ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" fans having played one of Elrond's elves and is also a musician. The rest of the supporting cast are excellent and I loved the costumes and beautiful locations with the grand English country house and gorgeous landscapes.The real draw for me is the story of a die-hard Austen fan having the opportunity to live out that fantasy life. There are those of us out there (who have read the books, seen the film adaptations dozens of times and think Mr. Darcy is dreamy) who probably wouldn't mind having a real ""Austenland"" in England somewhere.  The fact that the movie is also hilarious, well made and well cast is a big bonus. This is a comedy that is at times unapologetically over-the-top (thank you, Jennifer Coolidge). After all, it came from the same people who brought us ""Napoleon Dynamite."" That said, if you like Jane Austen's works and/or want a good laugh, then ""Austenland"" is a must see.",5,A big hit with this Austen fan.

1677376,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00G7QPXAI,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Face it; the chances of a romantic comedy ever winning an Oscar are almost non-existent. Sure they can be a lot of fun and provide plenty of entertainment (as well as making the choice of a date movie easy) but comedies in general are often overlooked and romantic comedies are considered the red headed step child when it comes to films (no offense to all you redheads or step children out there). The thing is though that some of the most entertaining movies are romantic comedies and such is the case with the DVD release of AUSTENLAND.Keri Russell stars as Jane Hayes, a young woman obsessed with the books of Jane Austen and all they involve. She dreams of having that one great romance some day where she will be swept off her feet by the perfect gentleman she seeks. The problem is that she is completely over the top with this obsession, so much so that her bedroom is decked out in period pieces and a cardboard cut out of Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Then Jane decides she's tired of waiting and takes matters into her own hands. She takes her life savings and goes on a trip to Austenland, a theme park in England based around the author and her books.When she arrives in England she meets Mrs. Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge), another hopeful going to Austenland. They set out and arrive only for Jane to discover that her vacation package was the copper package and Elizabeth's the platinum. In other words Elizabeth's gets her the best of the best while Jane is sent to the servant's quarters. Run by Mrs. Wattlebrook (Jane Seymour), the ladies are taken to the manor where they seem to have gone back in time. They aren't allowed any modern conveniences (except a toilet) and dress for that time period.Various events are scheduled and included in the package are several actors portraying men as if they were from one of Austen's novels. Some are forward, some snooty, but all are paid to make the fantasies of these ladies come to life. Along with Elizabeth and Jane is Lady Amelia Heartwright (Georgia King) who seems intent on taking center stage whenever possible.As the days pass it becomes apparent that Jane is not meeting her expectations of the vacation. Then she meets Martin (Bret McKenzie), the stable hand. They become confidants and grow close, something Jane appreciates since his role is not the same as the actors portraying love interests for the ladies. Has Jane found true love?The vacation moves forward, the ladies all three become close and the actors do their jobs. Eventually Jane tires of the package she's been assigned and starts flirting with all the actors. One in particular, the stand offish Henry Nobley (JJ Field) begins to change his opinion of Jane. He actually begins to take an interest in her. Just what is going on behind the scenes as much as out front makes for a complicated romance here. Just who will Jane end up with by the final reel, Martin or Henry? Or perhaps no one?The movie is a delight from start to finish. It moves along at a steady pace and never gets boring. The concept of the theme park and the extent to which they go to bring these ladies dreams to fruition is hilarious at times and sweet at others. There isn't a bad performance in the lot but stand outs are Russell who we don't see enough of these days and Coolidge who is absolutely hilarious in this role.

1677380,A20ULCEMNXPWLM,B00G7QPXAI,mel,"[1, 2]","I LOVE Jane Austen and was a HUGE skeptic of this movie. I had never read the book it was apparently loosely based on, and followed the advice of a few fellow Jane Austen aficionados and skipped it when it came out. After stumbling upon a brilliant review on Amazon by a male reviewer, I decided to give it a try. I was absolutely blown away. It is hilarious, sweet, entertaining, and fabulous. The acting was brilliant. The story, writing, comedic timing, and drama was great. I repeatedly laughed so hard I cried. There was a scene during a play that had me in stitches. Had I known that it was going to be as good as it was, I would have definitely have seen this in the theater. To be fair, this isn't the run of the mill period movie with elegant, proper, and refined ladies and gentlemen. Jennifer Coolidge's character was a perfect example. She relentlessly pursued the men, and was hilariously improper. The protagonist Jane herself was often defiant, and willful. The movie is realistic, refreshing, and complicated. It clearly separates fiction from reality and brilliantly showcases the differences between the ages, sexes, and classes. The movie perfectly challenges and ultimately changes the romantic notions of the protagonist pertaining to the era itself. It also reaffirms her belief in love and faith and devotion. Frankly, if you are not familiar with the Austen stories, the era that it takes place in, appreciate or understand satires, or British humor, then you will probably not like this movie. I would classify this as a satirical homage to the Austen stories. It's not exactly a spoof, but it's relatively close to one. Anyone that fails to understand that this is a satire is a fool. From the first few scenes to the end of the movie, they repeatedly reinforce that fact. That being said, this is definitely worth watching, and buying. I do not recommend this for younger, impressionable, or immature audiences however. I for one, will definitely include this in my Christmas gift list.",5,"A Fabulous, Entertaining and Hilarious Movie!",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,2013,"['LOVE', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'was', 'HUGE', 'skeptic', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'apparently', 'loosely', 'based', 'followed', 'advice', 'few', 'fellow', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'aficionados', 'skipped', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'stumbling', 'brilliant', 'review', 'Amazon', 'male', 'reviewer', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'was', 'absolutely', 'blown', 'away', 'hilarious', 'sweet', 'entertaining', 'fabulous', 'acting', 'was', 'brilliant', 'story', 'writing', 'comedic', 'timing', 'drama', 'was', 'great', 'repeatedly', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'cried', 'was', 'scene', 'play', 'had', 'stitches', 'Had', 'known', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'have', 'seen', 'theater', 'be', 'fair', ""n't"", 'run', 'mill', 'period', 'movie', 'elegant', 'proper', 'refined', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'character', 'was', 'perfect', 'example', 'relentlessly', 'pursued', 'men', 'was', 'hilariously', 'improper', 'protagonist', 'Jane', 'herself', 'was', 'often', 'defiant', 'willful', 'movie', 'realistic', 'refreshing', 'complicated', 'clearly', 'fiction', 'reality', 'brilliantly', 'differences', 'ages', 'sexes', 'classes', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'ultimately', 'romantic', 'notions', 'protagonist', 'pertaining', 'era', 'also', 'belief', 'love', 'faith', 'devotion', 'Frankly', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Austen', 'stories', 'era', 'place', 'appreciate', 'understand', 'satires', 'British', 'humor', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'classify', 'satirical', 'homage', 'Austen', 'stories', 'not', 'exactly', 'spoof', 'relatively', 'close', 'one', 'Anyone', 'understand', 'satire', 'fool', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'end', 'movie', 'repeatedly', 'reinforce', 'fact', 'being', 'said', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'buying', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'younger', 'impressionable', 'immature', 'audiences', 'however', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'include', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'list']",N/A

Oleson,"[0, 0]","Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) is a 30-something unmarried woman, presumably holding out for a real Mr. Darcy given her unhealthy obsession with Jane Austen and her ""Pride and Prejudice"" novel in particular.  Seizing on an opportunity to travel to England and spend a week at Austenland, off she goes.  Jane who is on a limited budget opts for the ""bronze"" or was it ""copper"" package, which is the lowest price option.Austenland is acres of 19th century countryside splendor with a large mansion, stables and all the accoutrements of the bygone era.  Mrs. Watt (Jane Seymour) is in charge of the place.  She hires the staff, including the actors who ""attend"" to the guests.  Nothing overtly sexual of course.  In fact guests and staff are not to touch each other except in appropriate ways, such as dancing or help out of a carriage.  Stephanie Meyer (""Twilight"") gets her first producing opportunity and Jerusha Hess directed and co-wrote the screenplay along with Shannon Hale.  And well, it's all terrible.Billed as a romantic comedy, the movie isn't funny or romantic.  Jennifer Coolidge plays Elizabeth Charming, one of the 3 guests (Georgia King as Lady Amelia is the other), tries to inject some humor into the events but alas she has nothing to work with.  With Jane's bottom of the barrel package she's given dowdy clothes to wear, as if she is one of the servants.  Still, she begins to draw attention from the actors especially the one playing a Darcy-like character (JJ Field).  Jane, often shunned, thanks to Mrs. Watt's obvious displeasure of not going for the ""gold"" package, sneaks off on her own and strikes up a flirtation with Martin (Bret McKenzie), the stable master.  So we have to guess what's real and what is just acting.  And is Jane playing along or getting played.  I'm not sure why I was drawn to this mess.  I guess the idea of Keri Russell playing a character so different from her nasty Russian spy on ""The Americans"" had me interested.  A mistake.Now the Blu ray disc I watched is not a mistake.  In fact, the picture is gorgeous.  It comes in a 1080p transfer with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are vibrant, flush with greens, blues and browns, the look is authentic (excellent sets).  Detail is excellent.  I could find nothing wrong with the picture.  The audio is equally as good.  A strong DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is the way to go.  Clarity is very good, surrounds have a natural variety and the sound is solid from beginning to end.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Korean, Thai and Mandarin.  Extras include a commentary track with Meyer and Hess along with a Q & A session with some of the actors, a trailer and some previews.",2,"(BLU RAY REVIEW) An unromantic, unfunny romantic-comedy",1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,2718,"['Jane', 'Hayes', 'Keri', 'Russell', '30-something', 'unmarried', 'woman', 'presumably', 'holding', 'out', 'real', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'given', 'unhealthy', 'obsession', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'novel', 'particular', 'Seizing', 'opportunity', 'travel', 'England', 'spend', 'week', 'Austenland', 'Jane', 'who', 'limited', 'budget', 'opts', 'bronze', 'was', 'copper', 'package', 'lowest', 'price', 'option.Austenland', 'acres', '19th', 'century', 'countryside', 'splendor', 'large', 'mansion', 'stables', 'accoutrements', 'bygone', 'era', 'Mrs.', 'Watt', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'charge', 'place', 'staff', 'including', 'actors', 'who', 'attend', 'guests', 'Nothing', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'course', 'fact', 'guests', 'staff', 'are', 'not', 'touch', 'other', 'appropriate', 'ways', 'such', 'dancing', 'help', 'carriage', 'Stephanie', 'Meyer', 'Twilight', 'first', 'producing', 'opportunity', 'Jerusha', 'Hess', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'Shannon', 'Hale', 'well', 'all', 'terrible.Billed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'funny', 'romantic', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Elizabeth', 'Charming', 'one', '3', 'guests', 'Georgia', 'King', 'Lady', 'Amelia', 'other', 'inject', 'humor', 'events', 'alas', 'nothing', 'work', 'Jane', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'package', 'given', 'dowdy', 'clothes', 'wear', 'one', 'servants', 'Still', 'draw', 'attention', 'actors', 'especially', 'one', 'playing', 'Darcy-like', 'character', 'JJ', 'Field', 'Jane', 'often', 'shunned', 'thanks', 'Mrs.', 'Watt', 'obvious', 'displeasure', 'not', 'going', 'gold', 'package', 'own', 'up', 'flirtation', 'Martin', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'stable', 'master', 'have', 'guess', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'just', 'acting', 'Jane', 'playing', 'along', 'getting', 'played', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'drawn', 'mess', 'guess', 'idea', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'playing', 'character', 'so', 'different', 'nasty', 'Russian', 'spy', 'Americans', 'had', 'interested', 'mistake.Now', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'watched', 'not', 'mistake', 'fact', 'picture', 'gorgeous', '1080p', 'transfer', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'flush', 'greens', 'blues', 'browns', 'look', 'authentic', 'excellent', 'sets', 'Detail', 'excellent', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'picture', 'audio', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'strong', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'way', 'go', 'Clarity', 'very', 'good', 'surrounds', 'have', 'natural', 'variety', 'sound', 'solid', 'beginning', 'end', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'Indonesian', 'Korean', 'Thai', 'Mandarin', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Meyer', 'Hess', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'actors', 'trailer', 'previews']",N/A

Would they really put a maid in the carriage and a guest in the back like luggage? Hated all the raunchy jokes. Really?

1677402,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B00G7QPXAI,Rissi,"[90, 101]","Comedy is never just black and white. There is a certain talent to getting it ""right."" Some movies go for the classy sort and in turn, earn viewer's gratitude. Others shoot for the wild and crazy, the sort that is lumped into the slaphappy. This Austen-inspired comedy of errors opts for the latter and the question on everyone's mind is, does it work?Being a 30-something who lives a mundane existence and cannot keep herself from loving Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is not something that endears Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) to the game of dating. Her friend is concerned Jane just wants the fantasy. But really, her love of all things Darcy isn't that bad... okay, so it is a bit obsessive which prompts Jane to strike a bargain with Molly. First she books a trip to Austenland an all-inclusive Jane Austen experience run by Mrs. Wattlesbrook (Jane Seymour), and if, upon her return she realizes regency life is just that, a fantasy, she'll give up her dreams of finding her own Darcy. With ticket in hand, Jane books a flight to London and lands smack dab in the middle of every girl's dream.Once there, Jane befriends Elizabeth Charming (Jennifer Coolidge) and strikes up a friendship with the groundskeeper, Martin (Bret McKenzie). When she's thrown together with the moody and arrogant, Henry Nobley (JJ Field), Jane sees the faux in her childhood dreams. Ever since she set foot on Austenland's grounds, everything about being the heroine in her own Austen story has been an act... or has it?Right up front, let me say that I had conflicting thoughts on this book-to-screen adaptation. Only my love of all things Austen-at-the-cinema kept me glued to theater openings related to 'Austenland.' Unfortunately, it didn't open at the most convenient of theaters, however we made a day out of it - and oh, my, what a fun adventure it was. Put thoughts of a proper, regency saga out of your mind; unlike the dialogue Jane Austen would have penned, this comedy is awkward and amusing over how funny it tries to be. Jane wove some subtle albeit wickedly good humor into her stories - satire with class, whereas this contemporary script makes many concessions to adapt to its 21st century characters. You've been warned. With that being said, I can in no way fault 'Austenland' terribly much since it inserts a modern girl into a world she only thought was her ""perfect"" ideal.While this was setting itself up, one of the first things that stood out was the warp speed at which the script unfolded. We were barely given time to process Jane's addiction before she was jetting off to England. Little explanation is given as to the ""why"" behind neither Jane's shy, comfortable life nor the way she immerses herself in all things 1800s. Secondly, I cannot say how impressed I was with the cast. Initially, it may line up as a mish-mash of talent - veteran actors, unknowns and British talent, it's in the actual watching of the film that we quickly learn how well they work together. The entire cast doesn't just create some fun chemistry none of them seem uncomfortable with the fun dialogue or acting silly to make the audience laugh with glee - something the people in the showing I saw did plenty of! This wouldn't be a complete assessment of thoughts if I was negligent in mentioning the ending; I lovelovelove the ending (preceding the closing titles) of this film. Not because it was unique or any different than the ordinary script, but because it was sweet and the actors played it so charming, it created its own brand of special.Bottom lining it, 'Austenland' is a delightful film that I look forward to re-visiting on DVD. Between some catchy, terrific music, throwbacks to well-known Austen scenes or dialogue  (like a humorous caught-in-the-rain scene) and its refreshing cast, the movie is hard not to like. It's a refreshing turn after so many end-of-the-world box office picks - its part study in a contemporary woman, part whimsical and outrageous comedy. As I've yet to read the novel of the same name (it has suddenly moved up on my TBR pile), I cannot say how well the screen transfer was, however I quite adored everything about the film. There is more good to it than merely feeding Austen obsessions; the story is also careful to help us realize that even the best-laid fantasy is not necessarily better than reality - and it's admirable to see Jane standing up for herself, distinguishing between fiction and fact is necessary to keep ones sanity and she does it well. When we see the change in Jane at the end - a more confident person, it makes even the silly moments worth it.From the crazy shenanigans to the absurd playacting and accents (courtesy of Georgia King and Jennifer Coolidge, respectively), 'Austenland' was a joyous journey, from beginning to end!Copyright  * Dreaming Under the Same Moon",5,Fabulous Fun,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,4818,"['Comedy',

Just to find out it really isn't a dream but a whole lot of different things. It became a reality she was unprepared for. Imagine going from cars and cellphones to horse and carriage, dressing for the 1800's, trying to adopt the manners of the 1800's. Jane steps into that world with a planned vacation and meets up with a handsome stable man who may or may not be her Mr. Darcy. Meanwhile, the guy who plays the role of Mr. Darcy isn't as he seems either. Actors hired to play characters from Pride and Prejudice. Contrast the actors  in one scene to another involving a swimming pool.  Toss in a raunchy tune and some raunchy reading (Jennifer Coolidge) here and there and you'll wonder if you weren't somehow caught in the twilight zone. Somehow, it all works out. The script is brilliant and all of it is very well played. Be prepared to laugh at yourself if you are a Jane Austen fan. Most women will probably enjoy this movie. Don't worry guys... others of the male gender also found themselves laughing as well.  Congratulations and thank you  to the writer, director, and actors of this brilliant movie.

We meet Jane Hayes played wonderfully by Keri Russell (`August Rush' and `Mission Impossible III'). She is completely obsessed with Jane Austen and all her works; she even sports a `I Love D'arcy' bag - he is fictional don't ya know. And has a cardboard cut-out of Colin Firth in her flat - dressed as D'arcy.Well she decides to blow her life savings on a `life changing' trip to theme park extraordinaire, `Austenland'. As the name would indicate this is a total immersion event where you get to live the life of one of Austen's characters for a whole week. This means a trip to England (actually filmed down the road from me in West Wycombe Park). On arrival she discovers that her accompanying guest is fellow American Miss Elizabeth Charming (an Austenland given name) played with over the top brilliance by the excessively talented Jennifer Collidge - `Gentleman Broncos' where she is superb too. She is brash, loud and wants to dress in the costumes so she can have a cleavage to die for - and she steals every scene.Anyway the week will have its ups and downs - social faux pas and consorting with `the help' from `below stairs' no less. There is also a real live Mr D'arcy and the Mistress of ceremonies is played with measured stuffiness and snobbery by Jane Seymour. Of course all the extras are actors and the lines between reality and fiction are sometimes too blurred to tell apart. As this is based on Jane Austen there is always going to be romance, trouble, heartache and in this case some real gut, laugh humour.Yes this is a rom com but I absolutely loved it.

Her dream, of course, is to be transported back into time by living in an English manor house, filled with Regency era characters, costumes, and lifestyles.  Unable to find her perfect Mr. Darcy in life, she hopes to at least find him in a short, fantasy-filled vacation.Unlike the series Lost in Austen, she acclimates fairly well to her surroundings.  Of course, everyone is really in the 21st century, though they are encouraged to live in the early 19th century.  The ladies pay to stay in a house full of actors from the footmen to the other guests, in the hopes that at their last night they have received a proposal of marriage from one of the cast.Jennifer Coolidge, as usual, plays a rather ditzy blonde.  JJ Feild is the resident snobbish Darcy-type.  Bret McKenzie is the servant help, though he comes across as just another modern employee taking care of the horses and landscape. Keri Russell, who plays Jane (of course) Hayes, is the modern woman looking to fulfill her Austen fantasies.Even though Jane arrives filled with anticipation, she seems to teeter between reality and fantasy. She has purchased the &#34;cheap&#34; package and is relegated to the servant quarters for her room upon arrival. The other guests are lodging in the opulent surroundings. During her stay she becomes attached to what she thinks is the real-life help, rather than being attracted to the snobbish Darcy-type actor.  As the story plays out, each character falls for someone either in their fantasy world or in reality.  However, I won't tell you who is who.The movie is mildly entertaining and not as good as Lost in Austen.  Probably the best part is when the man she eventually falls in love with declares his feelings. When she balks they are still living a fantasy, he says in his dreamy English accent, &#34;But Jane, don't you understand. You are my fantasy.&#34;  (Or something along those lines.)
