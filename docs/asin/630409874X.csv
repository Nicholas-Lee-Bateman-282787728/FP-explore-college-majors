Smith,"[0, 0]","Based on a play by the guy who plays the hitman in this short movie, this doesn't have a lot of action, though it does have a few mildly entertaining plot twists. The movie format allows for a few flashbacks to be fleshed out. None of the characters are very sympathetic. Cher, in 1996 when this was made, had just had her lips plumped. Ryan O'Neill still looked less bloated than he was to become. I had to pause this at least half a dozen times and go do other things because I got bored by the tedium of the script.

Paper flat direction by Paul Mazursky is the real let down with this play turned film. No sweat!! Cher and Chazz Palminteri hold things together. Palminteri's script makes many good points, but some how shoots for a degree of shock value that makes for some dialogue that can be a little more hardcore than one might of expected. Thats cool though I haven't heard Cher talk like that since &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987). Some traditional married folk may find themselves offended. This movie was often halarious and insane in it's honesty.

400925,AQXTK3B1SUZVN,630409874X,P. Ambrose,"[18, 18]","I would love to rate this 5 stars but I'm an equal opportunity Cher fan.  To begin with as other reviewers have remarked, this film - originally produced off Broadway by Palmienteri (who at the time was hot from &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;) does not translate as well to the screen.  The wordy script, however, gives Cher some great lines and she really carries the film.  It is a very interestingly written screenplay (it varies drastically from the original show) and once again there were rumours of trouble on the set between Cher and Mazursky, the director.  The ending and last shot is so obviously stapled on - something Cher was so angry about you can actually see her seething in the scene while she is in the car.  And she has good reason - the film reaches a crescendo and then BOOM just falls flat.  Cher's performance is wonderful and emotive; unfortunately her recently &quot;touched up lips&quot; shall I say - are hard to ignore in many scenes.  (I don't know what she did, however I rode up in an elevator with her back in February and she looked amazing).  Ryan O'Neal, as well, is bloated - so there is a desperation of the aging Hollywood actor feel about the film.  However, in an odd sense that all actually works very well with the theme of &quot;out with the old&quot; that is O'Neal's character's motivation and Cher's character's desperation as well.  A very enjoyable and underrated film.",4,FAITHLESS?  NO!

400926,A1TVP6C06M6ZKX,630409874X,"Paul Papadopoulos ""Kinky Greek""","[0, 0]","I agree with several other Amazon  reviewers this movie is underrated.  I cannot understand why for example, Leonard Maltin's  professional reviewer  accords it only two stars.The title tells all:  it is a film that  is basically about  what does it take to label somebody as being unfaithful? At one point Margaret -Cherilyn Sarkisian  or ""Cher""- challenges the  mafia's hit man Tony -Chazz Palminteri- whom somebody has hired to kill her when he admits to be ""rather unfaithful"" with  ""What do you mean? You are either  faithful or unfaithful?"". "" Tony's definition of  not having sex  in a sexual relationship  is similar  to Bill Clinton's.Unlike Moonstruck, however, Faithful  is not Oscar material (although I can easily  think of some Oscar winners of poorer quality than this movie) but strangely enough  Cher does a better job  as Margaret in this film  than even  in her outstanding performance in Moonstruck  in which she co-starred with a rather blah Nicholas Cage. Perhaps because her role and lines here  are better despite  the  movie being much  less skilfully structured than in Moonstruck. The criticism that it is based on a stage  play that doesn't translate so well on the screen is invalid. Films such as Kenneth Branagh's  Henry V and Al Pacino's The Merchant of Venice,  as well as the older ""The Importance of Being  Ernest"" of Anthony Asquith were all originally stage dramas but  still went well when adapted to the screen.I first saw a bit of this film on TV some years ago when we were set to go out for dinner and it was already well in progress so there was no point in taping it. A few days ago it came up on TV again  I  recorded it in case we got drowsy (like most good films shown on  Greek TV channels it began at 11 pm). However, we managed  to stay awake and I am certainly going to see it again now I have the tape. Warning: the film is rather flat for the first 30 or so minutes with Cher doing a good job but Chazz Palminteri taking rather long to ease  into his role as the reluctant  neurotic hit man.  ( Incidentally surely Amazon has erred in not listing Chazz as one of the actors despite his key role  in Faithful but has several  comparatively unknown persons shown who only briefly appear? I mean Chazz not only co-stars with Cher and O'Neal  but was a co-writer and co-producer of the movie!)  From then on the film builds up with several twists, turns and red herrings  in the plot. I agree with one remark that the  tacked on epilogue is blah and unnecessary, it should be edited out for the next DVD release and relegated to the deleted scenes  part of the bonus material.Yes this is not an action movie. So if you have had a bad day in the office and need to relax with  a good no-brainer don't watch it tonight. The film's value is mainly in the word exchanges  in a very  dry humour suitable for  a black melodrama (comedy is a bit misleading). We laughed at many points,- much more times  than in many a so-called  screen comedy-  but not to the extent that we were rolling on the floor. A pure light and  absurd  comedy such as Danny Kaye's in The Court Jester classic  is needed to produce that result in our household. Earlier the  same evening I'd watched the constant and rather comic action film Red Heat starring Arnold  Schwarzennegger  and  James Belushi,  so we needed to view something  somewhat more cerebral  late at night. I agree with some other  Amazon reviewers that  the film merits a second viewing once the plot is unravelled by the first screening  to really appreciate what is going on in the Cher-Palminteri-O'Neal triangle. If you want to watch an enjoyable movie  that demands your attention and respects your intelligence, this is it. But be relaxed first. It's like enjoying a  fine wine or single malt whiskey, and has to be taken and savoured  sip by sip.",4,Faithful?To be or not to be with fatal possibilities,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,3841,"['agree', 'several', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'underrated', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'example', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'professional', 'reviewer', 'accords', 'only', 'two', 'stars.The', 'title', 'film', 'basically', 'what', 'take', 'label', 'somebody', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'one', 'point', 'Margaret', '-Cherilyn', 'Sarkisian', 'Cher', 'mafia', 'hit', 'man', 'Tony', '-Chazz', 'Palminteri-', 'whom', 'somebody', 'hired', 'kill', 'when', 'be', 'rather', 'unfaithful', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'are', 'faithful', 'unfaithful', 'Tony', 'definition', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'similar', 'Bill', ""Clinton's.Unlike"", 'Moonstruck', 'however', 'Faithful', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'can', 'easily', 'think', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'poorer', 'quality', 'movie', 'strangely', 'enough', 'Cher', 'better', 'job', 'Margaret', 'film', 'even', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Moonstruck', 'co-starred', 'rather', 'blah', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Perhaps', 'role', 'lines', 'here', 'are', 'better', 'movie', 'being', 'much', 'less', 'skilfully', 'structured', 'Moonstruck', 'criticism', 'based', 'stage', 'play', ""n't"", 'translate', 'so', 'well', 'screen', 'invalid', 'Films', 'such', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Henry', 'V', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Merchant', 'Venice', 'as', 'well', 'older', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Ernest', 'Anthony', 'Asquith', 'were', 'originally', 'stage', 'dramas', 'still', 'went', 'well', 'when', 'adapted', 'screen.I', 'first', 'saw', 'bit', 'film', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'set', 'go', 'out', 'dinner', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'progress', 'so', 'was', 'point', 'taping', 'few', 'days', 'came', 'up', 'TV', 'again', 'recorded', 'case', 'got', 'drowsy', 'most', 'good', 'films', 'shown', 'Greek', 'TV', 'channels', 'began', '11', 'pm', 'However', 'managed', 'stay', 'awake', 'am', 'certainly', 'going', 'see', 'again', 'now', 'have', 'tape', 'Warning', 'film', 'rather', 'flat', 'first', '30', 'so', 'minutes', 'Cher', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'taking', 'rather', 'long', 'ease', 'role', 'reluctant', 'neurotic', 'hit', 'man', 'Incidentally', 'surely', 'Amazon', 'erred', 'not', 'listing', 'Chazz', 'one', 'actors', 'key', 'role', 'Faithful', 'several', 'comparatively', 'unknown', 'persons', 'shown', 'who', 'only', 'briefly', 'appear', 'mean', 'Chazz', 'not', 'only', 'co-stars', 'Cher', ""O'Neal"", 'was', 'co-writer', 'co-producer', 'movie', 'then', 'film', 'up', 'several', 'twists', 'turns', 'red', 'herrings', 'plot', 'agree', 'one', 'remark', 'tacked', 'epilogue', 'blah', 'unnecessary', 'should', 'be', 'edited', 'out', 'next', 'DVD', 'release', 'relegated', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'part', 'bonus', 'material.Yes', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'So', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'office', 'need', 'relax', 'good', 'no-brainer', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'tonight', 'film', 'value', 'mainly', 'word', 'exchanges', 'very', 'dry', 'humour', 'suitable', 'black', 'melodrama', 'comedy', 'bit', 'misleading', 'laughed', 'many', 'points', 'much', 'more', 'times', 'many', 'so-called', 'screen', 'comedy-', 'not', 'extent', 'were', 'rolling', 'floor', 'pure', 'light', 'absurd', 'comedy', 'such', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Court', 'Jester', 'classic', 'needed', 'produce', 'result', 'household', 'Earlier', 'same', 'evening', ""'d"", 'watched', 'constant', 'rather', 'comic', 'action', 'film', 'Red', 'Heat', 'starring', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzennegger', 'James', 'Belushi', 'needed', 'view', 'something', 'somewhat', 'more', 'cerebral', 'late', 'night', 'agree', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'once', 'plot', 'unravelled', 'first', 'screening', 'really', 'appreciate', 'what', 'going', ""Cher-Palminteri-O'Neal"", 'triangle', 'want', 'watch', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'attention', 'intelligence', 'be', 'relaxed', 'first', 'enjoying', 'fine', 'wine', 'single', 'malt', 'whiskey', 'be', 'taken', 'savoured', 'sip', 'sip']",Faithful VHS
