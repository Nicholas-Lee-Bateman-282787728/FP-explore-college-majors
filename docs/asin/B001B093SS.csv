While I haven't watched the originalSkeleton Key, I found that I really didn't need to. The movie follows the protagonist from the first film as he returns to the town of Nilbog, a town that has been overrun by zombies. Once there, he has to figure out how to survive & save his friends!OK, let's be honest here. This film wasn't great. It was downright hokey overall. But then... it isn't supposed to be good. The movie looks to be an out & out parody of other horror movies. The feel I got from this film was that it reminded me of some of the independent films that might have come out from Troma. If you know what to expect, the film isn't that horribly bad. If I liked this sort of film, I probably would have rated it higher. I just don't really like horror & comedy mixed together. Plus I thought that the film would have been better if it was shorter. The one liners & stuff didn't really make the 2 hour film that bearable. If it was a half hour shorter, it would have been far better served & I would have given this 3 stars rather than 2.If you just want to watch a schlocky horror film, go get this film from your video store & rent it first. If you've seen the original & want to buy it, I assume that you know what you are getting yourself in for. If you are looking for a sequel to the Kate Hudson film, you won't find it here.

I can only speak on 10 minutes because I literally couldn't stomach letting the dvd play any further and watching an hour of my life wasted, and that speaks volumes because I usually give every movie a chance no matter how corny.  Cinematically, the filming was horrible; it looked like an average joe took a moderate quality video cam and decided to play director/starring actor and record his weekday morning.  I mean it was just that horrible that I couldn't continue.  If any of you has ever had the unfortunate displeasure of viewing a film called ""Woods of Evil"", this has the same picture quality and cheese content. The part that upset me the most is that I rented this film thinking that it would be a sequel or continuation of the original theater film ""Skeleton Key"", and it definitely has no relation to the movie whatsoever.
