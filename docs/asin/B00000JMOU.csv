506587,A32P27HTF7XEW1,B00000JMOU,Brendan Klein,"[7, 7]","I picked up this VHs awhile ago on a CYF whim. The film had been critically hated, and bashed on most of the review sites I had seen. However the cover with chow yun fat in the long coat twirling in a  leonesque standoff on the front cover, I had to have it. It couldn't be  that bad...and it wasn't.The problem with this film is it tries to hard  to show all sides of Chow Yun Fat's persona as a HK superstar, The film  goes from Heroic Bloodshed, to slapstick comedy, to Meladramatic touching  love story all in the span of two hours. I am a HUGE Chow Yun Fat fan, and  can consider myself somewhat of an authority, and even I in no way hated  this film!Chow Yun Fat plays Ah Ching, an American CIA agent in HK who  is hired by the USA government to return a stolen national treasure from a  Shaolin Temple. The treasure turns out to be a sweet young woman gifted  with supernatural powers (why she is a national treasure is never really  explained). That being said, Chow Yun Fat falls in love with her, and  protects her from other Vengeful CIA agents who want to sell her to the  highest bidder.What I didn't like about this film was some of the  comedy, some. I enjoyed most of it, which is very unusual for me becuase I  am not a fan of most Hk comedy. But it is just too funny. From Chow's  interaction with the Shaolin Monks, to the Foul Mouthed Cabbie who used to  be a Shaolin Master, to the fat little monk named &quot;priestling  grasshopper&quot;, no matter how many times i watch it, it is still  funny.The film is also a very touching love story, Yun Fat and Lin have  a real chemistry. The ending always has me in tears no matter how cheesy it  is and predictable. I have shown this film to many of my friends, and i  watch as they laugh at the funny parts and hide their tears at the  ending.All in all if you are looking for a hardcore John Woo, Ringo Lam  bulletfest, you may wanna give this one a skip. But if you are interested  in a cute romantic drama with action thrown into the mix, then you have to  see this movie. I would try to rent it first though- it depends on your  taste.Also- beware of the tacked on happy ending. HK audiences started  to hate unhappy endings after the 1990's, so one was tacked on at the end  of this film. When the train leaves in the distance, that is the directors  original ending.",4,It's not as bad as everyone says! at all!,949363200,"02 1, 2000",2000,2339,"['picked', 'up', 'VHs', 'awhile', 'ago', 'CYF', 'whim', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'critically', 'hated', 'bashed', 'most', 'review', 'had', 'seen', 'However', 'cover', 'chow', 'yun', 'fat', 'long', 'coat', 'twirling', 'leonesque', 'standoff', 'front', 'cover', 'had', 'have', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', ""wasn't.The"", 'problem', 'film', 'hard', 'show', 'sides', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'persona', 'HK', 'superstar', 'film', 'Heroic', 'Bloodshed', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'Meladramatic', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'span', 'two', 'hours', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'fan', 'can', 'consider', 'somewhat', 'authority', 'even', 'way', 'hated', 'film', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Ah', 'Ching', 'American', 'CIA', 'agent', 'HK', 'who', 'hired', 'USA', 'government', 'return', 'stolen', 'national', 'treasure', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'treasure', 'out', 'be', 'sweet', 'young', 'woman', 'gifted', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'why', 'national', 'treasure', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'being', 'said', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'love', 'other', 'Vengeful', 'CIA', 'agents', 'who', 'want', 'sell', 'highest', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'was', 'comedy', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'very', 'unusual', 'becuase', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'most', 'Hk', 'comedy', 'just', 'too', 'funny', 'Chow', 'interaction', 'Shaolin', 'Monks', 'Foul', 'Mouthed', 'Cabbie', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'Shaolin', 'Master', 'fat', 'little', 'monk', 'named', 'quot', 'priestling', 'grasshopper', 'quot', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'i', 'watch', 'still', 'funny.The', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Lin', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'ending', 'always', 'tears', 'matter', 'how', 'cheesy', 'predictable', 'have', 'shown', 'film', 'many', 'friends', 'i', 'watch', 'laugh', 'funny', 'parts', 'hide', 'tears', 'ending.All', 'are', 'looking', 'hardcore', 'John', 'Woo', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'bulletfest', 'may', 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'one', 'skip', 'are', 'interested', 'cute', 'romantic', 'drama', 'action', 'thrown', 'mix', 'then', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'try', 'rent', 'first', 'taste.Also-', 'beware', 'tacked', 'happy', 'ending', 'HK', 'audiences', 'started', 'hate', 'unhappy', 'endings', '1990', 'one', 'was', 'tacked', 'end', 'film', 'When', 'train', 'distance', 'directors', 'original', 'ending']",Treasure Hunt

Next, a conflict of western/eastern mores and values. Then, becomes a love story with a lot of very cheesy jokes. And, increasingly, becomes a mystery, fantasy. Almost none of the characters including Chow Yun Fat maintain any kind of consistency in their behavior. Some are cruel, then kind or vice versa. Some are silly and then become very clever. Mr. Fat is all of the above. There are some nice visuals occaisionally. The major climactic scene involves a massive shootout that is totally unbelievable.

506590,A3JFI33X3W9SNI,B00000JMOU,James C. Dascoli,"[4, 4]","I've enjoyed Chow Yun Fat in both Action and Romantic films, so my disappointment in this movie is not because there wasn't enough action.  The weakness of the film is in the meamdering plot and lack of focus of the story.  At first the movie starts off in typical Hong Kong gangster violence and gun play.  But it shifts to a romantic (somewhat comedic) genre only to fall back into the gangster ending.  In such it leaves neither audience satisified.The plot, such as it is, revolves around Chow Yun Fat, a CIA operative, trying to return a Chinesse natural treasure, which is of course a beautiful pyschic nut case woman.  Maybe parts of the plot were lost in translation or when I was dozing off, but if she is a Chinese treasuer - why is he trying to 'bring' her back to the US.  And if she is a US citizen how did she get kidnapped in China.  Then in the end out of nowhere the Head Priest at the Temple she is hiding at is kidnapped.  Suffice to say this leads us back to the typical mayhem and destruction of most Hong Kong action movies, which seems incongrous to the previous hour of the movie.Chow Yun Fat does an admirable job, as would be expected, and if the movie had focused almost exlusively on the romance and mysticism of the story or on the stubbornness of leaders of the Shaolin Temple the movie would have been a lot better and more interesting.  The ending (after the gun play) has a nice touch about it.  The movie is a rental and you can actually see a little of Crouching Tiger in it, but don't go into it with high expectations.  And you wouldn't be missing much if you skipped over the first 20 minutes and just started the movie when he goes to Chine.",2,Unfocused Chow Yun Fat Romance,995760000,"07 22, 2001",2001,1680,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Action', 'Romantic', 'films', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'weakness', 'film', 'meamdering', 'plot', 'lack', 'focus', 'story', 'first', 'movie', 'typical', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'gangster', 'violence', 'gun', 'play', 'romantic', 'somewhat', 'genre', 'only', 'fall', 'back', 'gangster', 'ending', 'such', 'audience', 'satisified.The', 'plot', 'such', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'CIA', 'operative', 'trying', 'return', 'Chinesse', 'natural', 'treasure', 'course', 'beautiful', 'pyschic', 'nut', 'case', 'woman', 'Maybe', 'parts', 'plot', 'were', 'lost', 'translation', 'when', 'was', 'dozing', 'off', 'Chinese', 'treasuer', 'why', 'trying', ""'bring"", 'back', 'US', 'US', 'citizen', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'kidnapped', 'China', 'Then', 'end', 'nowhere', 'Head', 'Priest', 'Temple', 'hiding', 'kidnapped', 'Suffice', 'say', 'back', 'typical', 'mayhem', 'destruction', 'most', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'movies', 'incongrous', 'previous', 'hour', 'movie.Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'admirable', 'job', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'movie', 'had', 'focused', 'almost', 'exlusively', 'romance', 'mysticism', 'story', 'stubbornness', 'leaders', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'ending', 'gun', 'play', 'nice', 'touch', 'movie', 'rental', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'little', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'high', 'expectations', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'much', 'skipped', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'just', 'started', 'movie', 'when', 'Chine']",Treasure Hunt
506591,APIW11UEPKIC2,B00000JMOU,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 1]","The movie starts out pretty weird.  There are a lot of things that are thrown at you pretty quickly.  But, if you have ever seen a Jeffrey Lau movie before this mon't come as a surprise.  Chow Yun-Fat is on a mission for the CIA and is told to stay at a Shaolin Temple.  Being a huge kung fu fan I was more than happy to see Gordon Liu as one of the senior monks.  So Chow doesn't really fit in but meets a girl who just happens to show up to Shaolin.  Chien-lien Wu and Chow have amazing chemistry in this movie and with literally NO action other than a pole fight and a couple of quick shootouts, they had to fill a lot of screen time and they did very well.So Chow and the girl fall in love and we learn that the girl has supernatural powers.Phillip Kwok('5 Deadly Venoms', 'Hard-boiled' is the action choreographer and really doesn't get to do much in that department but does have a great role as a taxi driver you will love to hate.  He is such a smartass that you can't help but like him.  Out of nowhere he shows up at Shaolin and Gordon Liu says that the head abbot said for him not to come back.  WHAT!?!?!?!!?  Like I said, Jeffrey Lau directs this movie and it is all the better for it.  Phillip Kwok doesn't appreciate Gordon talking down to him and challenges him to a fight.  So this of course was the highlight of the movie for me but the relationshipo between Chien-lien Wu and Chow was almost as good.  I would of liked more action and the finale wasn't spectacular what so ever but the movie still had a very good ending.The Mei Eh version of this movie is pretty good picture quality and the subttiles are pretty good.",3,Monk fight between the Lizard from 'The Five Deadly Venoms' and Master Killer himself!!!!!,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,1638,"['movie', 'out', 'pretty', 'weird', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'thrown', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Jeffrey', 'Lau', 'movie', 'mo', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'mission', 'CIA', 'told', 'stay', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'Being', 'huge', 'kung', 'fu', 'fan', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'see', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'one', 'senior', 'monks', 'So', 'Chow', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'Shaolin', 'Chien-lien', 'Wu', 'Chow', 'have', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'literally', 'NO', 'action', 'other', 'pole', 'fight', 'couple', 'quick', 'shootouts', 'had', 'fill', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'did', 'very', 'well.So', 'Chow', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'learn', 'girl', 'supernatural', 'powers.Phillip', 'Kwok', '5', 'Deadly', 'Venoms', ""'Hard-boiled"", 'action', 'choreographer', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'much', 'department', 'have', 'great', 'role', 'taxi', 'driver', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'such', 'smartass', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'nowhere', 'up', 'Shaolin', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'head', 'abbot', 'said', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'WHAT', 'said', 'Jeffrey', 'Lau', 'movie', 'better', 'Phillip', 'Kwok', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Gordon', 'talking', 'down', 'fight', 'course', 'was', 'highlight', 'movie', 'relationshipo', 'Chien-lien', 'Wu', 'Chow', 'was', 'almost', 'good', 'would', 'liked', 'more', 'action', 'finale', 'was', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'movie', 'still', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'ending.The', 'Mei', 'Eh', 'version', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'subttiles', 'are', 'pretty', 'good']",Treasure Hunt

People are right when they accuse it of &quot;genre hopping.&quot;  One minute a bloody gunfight will lead into some corny cop jokes.  Then some supernatural acts will lead into a love story which is then followed by quirky Asian comedy.  Some might chafe at the thought of such a stew, but it does work.So, if you already have A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, Hard Boiled, City On Fire, Full Contact, City War, etc. and are looking to branch out into CYF's less-action more-light fare, this would be a great first stop.

506593,A2SQZC62UZCZ7B,B00000JMOU,Zenith,"[0, 0]","While Chow Yun-Fat is one of the biggest action stars in Chinese cinema, it must be remembered that he is also an established actor in both serious dramas and zany comedies. This film seemed to want to blend Chow's charisma as a hardened action hero with his abilities to give a strong dramatic performance and deliver a punchline; sadly, it fails.The primary reason for this is that the movie doesn't blend the different moods very well. The tone jumps from a John Woo wannabe shoot-'em-up, to a piece of wacky slapstick, to what they were trying to pass off as an intense romance with all the grace of a boulder striking a moving train.At about the halfway point, Chow, who was the only person consistently trying, seems to simply give up. One can't blame him when he's trying to play in a straight cop drama, and out of nowhere, a woman with magical powers takes him flying through the treetops. The fact that half the team of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' worked on this is blatantly obvious. It's this lack of commitment by Chow and his female co-star that makes the romance, which becomes the driving force of the plot, utterly devoid of emotion.Even at its best, 'Treasure Hunt' is a movie that just reminds you of how much better work all involved have done in their careers.",2,More than a bit weak,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,1286,"['Chow', 'Yun-Fat', 'one', 'biggest', 'action', 'stars', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'must', 'be', 'remembered', 'also', 'established', 'actor', 'serious', 'dramas', 'zany', 'comedies', 'film', 'seemed', 'want', 'blend', 'Chow', 'charisma', 'hardened', 'action', 'hero', 'abilities', 'give', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'deliver', 'punchline', 'sadly', 'fails.The', 'primary', 'reason', 'movie', ""n't"", 'blend', 'different', 'moods', 'very', 'well', 'tone', 'jumps', 'John', 'Woo', 'wannabe', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'piece', 'wacky', 'slapstick', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'intense', 'romance', 'grace', 'boulder', 'striking', 'moving', 'train.At', 'halfway', 'point', 'Chow', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'consistently', 'trying', 'simply', 'give', 'up', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'when', 'trying', 'play', 'straight', 'cop', 'drama', 'nowhere', 'woman', 'magical', 'powers', 'flying', 'treetops', 'fact', 'team', ""'Crouching"", 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'worked', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'lack', 'commitment', 'Chow', 'female', 'co-star', 'romance', 'driving', 'force', 'plot', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'emotion.Even', 'best', 'Hunt', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'work', 'all', 'involved', 'have', 'done', 'careers']",Treasure Hunt
