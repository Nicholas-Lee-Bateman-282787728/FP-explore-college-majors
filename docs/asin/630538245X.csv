The police come to the house and talk to Mikey. He gives the police a very convincing and fabricated story of an intruder he saw running from the house after his family was murdered. Soon after, Mikey sees a psychologist who deems him 'normal'. He then is placed up for adoption once again and ends up with the Trenton family.During this whole process Mikeys teacher ' Ashley Lawrence ' becomes suspicious after seeing some pictures Mikeys been coloring and tries to warn the parents of his odd behavior. They dont listen and they end up the victim of Mikeys madness along with almost every other person he encounters.Its amazing how sweet this kid could be then the next minute hes like a little monster. You love him to death when hes good but then when hes bad hes really evil.Ive seen many thrillers/horror films and I'd have to say id rank this one at about a 3.5 out of 5.

462738,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,630538245X,A. Pierre,"[0, 1]","I remember reading the tagline for the movie when I was younger and always wanted to see it. This film came out when horror was dead but the movie is pretty good. The trailer shows every kill in this movie, a first for a horror movie.It starts off with little Mikey getting slapped by his mother and he kills his sister (because she didnt stick up for him), his mother, and then his father. Mikey videotaped the killings, which I thought would have come into play later in the film but it doesnt. After the murders, he's adopted by a new family. The film then shows little hints of Mikey being a psycho until the very last part of the film. While the acting was good, I thought the ending just sucked and it probably would have had a sequel if this film did anything at the box office. This is a lost gem in an era where horror films were all but forgotten. I paid 30 for a authentic copy and I see a seller selling one forn only ten bucks, I recommend picking it up.
