Still, good watch.After checking out the features, understanding that this is an East German film, produced when The Wall was still well in place, the handling of the story made more sense.Well worth being included in any WW2 film collection.",4,Since when were the Soviets the nice guys post WW2?,1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,491,"['Watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'found', 'handling', 'German', 'Boy', 'Turned', 'Soviet', 'Soldier', 'Comes', 'Home', 'story', 'line', 'interesting', 'thought', 'someone', 'boots', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'far', 'more', 'harshly', 'even', 'protected', 'Soviets', 'Still', 'good', 'watch.After', 'checking', 'out', 'features', 'understanding', 'East', 'German', 'film', 'produced', 'when', 'Wall', 'was', 'still', 'well', 'place', 'handling', 'story', 'made', 'more', 'sense.Well', 'worth', 'being', 'included', 'WW2', 'film', 'collection']",N/A

I wasn't fully aware that this was actually an East German propaganda film, although I did find myself wondering why all of the Russians in this movie were highly moral, heroic, friendly, and physically attractive.

1093759,A698LG4SWVUDR,B000U95NAI,"Eric Gannon ""Etgreat""","[24, 27]","This film is truly unique in the film-making world, it is the only film that i have ever seen or dealt with that advances the plot and tells important parts of the story in TWO languages. I have a copy of this film that is from Germany with no subtitles. Since i speak both german and russian and am familiar with this point in history, i am very impressed with the realistic portrayal of the last days of WW2. Young Gregor Hecker, who is technically a german, but has grown up a russian and deals with trying to find out what it actually means to be ""german"", but the situations he faces and his experiences really can translate to just about anyone trying to find out what it means to be ""american"" or ""russian"" or ""french"" or anyone's nationality. He learns some very interesting lessons about himself and also about dealing with other individual people, and that one should never have any pre-concieved notions about groups of people. The most fascinating thing about this movie, is that it is a telling story of individuality and humanity, while the larger story of war is all around. I recommend this film to anyone (since it has subtitles) interested in WW2, because it will give a very accurate and interesting perspective of this time period.",5,Finally on DVD!,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,1251,"['film', 'truly', 'unique', 'film-making', 'world', 'only', 'film', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'dealt', 'plot', 'tells', 'important', 'parts', 'story', 'TWO', 'languages', 'have', 'copy', 'film', 'Germany', 'subtitles', 'i', 'speak', 'german', 'russian', 'am', 'familiar', 'point', 'history', 'i', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'last', 'days', 'WW2', 'Young', 'Gregor', 'Hecker', 'who', 'technically', 'german', 'grown', 'up', 'russian', 'deals', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'be', 'german', 'situations', 'experiences', 'really', 'can', 'translate', 'just', 'anyone', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'american', 'russian', 'french', 'anyone', 'nationality', 'very', 'interesting', 'lessons', 'also', 'dealing', 'other', 'individual', 'people', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'pre-concieved', 'notions', 'groups', 'people', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'movie', 'telling', 'story', 'individuality', 'humanity', 'larger', 'story', 'war', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'subtitles', 'interested', 'WW2', 'will', 'give', 'very', 'accurate', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'time', 'period']",N/A

Perhaps some of us in North-America are aware of it, but there was never much information here, about Germans that fought in the Soviet Army, to fight against fascism. This movie tells an autobiographical story of one of those soldiers, that just reached the age of 19, when he crossed the border with his Red Army comrades, to help to put an end to Hitlers regime. A very puzzled young men, he witnesses carnage and tragedy. Growing up in the Soviet Union, he meetsthe ""other Germans"" for the first time, asking soldiers to surrender, and civilians to cooperate with the new Soviet authorities. Those interactions you are gonna witness are priceless, you haven't seen anything like that in other movies.One of the Concentration Camps his army is about to liberate,comes not only as a shock to him, but also as an important lesson. It's not a combat war movie, this movie does has a few combat scenes, but the focus is on the human tragedy, and how our protagonist deals with it. The scenes are sometimes gut-wrenching, and I caught myself sometimes being moved to tears. Interesting also, how he releases himself from the experience, with his self dialogues. I can not see any other actor but Jackie Schwartz pulling off the act of this soldier. He's still a big star in Germany today, doing mostly TV movies and series.I would have loved it, seeing him in some Hollywood movies, like his compatriot Armin Mueller Stahl.

As such, there is almost no plot or story, just a string of incidents going in one general direction. The cinematography is great, the acting fabulous all around, production values excellent, and the soundtrack is clear, with subtitles. It is an interesting, gripping, and at times exotic adventure in film.

1093762,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000U95NAI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Set in the waning days of the war as the Russians and Americans were traversing Germany, ""I Was Nineteen"" takes a distinctly realistic and unsentimental look at one man's personal experience.  Jaecki Schwarz plays a young soldier in the Red Army whose German-born lineage places him in some unusual circumstances.  Playing the German, he rises through the ranks with his communication skills and becomes increasingly disillusioned by the senselessness of the violence that continues even after the war has ended.  In 1968, this clearly played as a bit of propaganda painting the Russians in a very favorable light--as champions to a certain extent.  It ignores the documented atrocities committed by these same soldiers to concentrate on a more humane story.  There are a couple of great sequences--trying to talk a Nazi stronghold into surrendering and establishing a camp for evacuating German soldiers.  It is very methodical and matter-of-fact in its presentation which makes the final scenes more compelling.
