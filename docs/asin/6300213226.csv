Now he makes me laugh. William Campbell has fun playing the fop who happens to have extraordinary powers.But he has no sense of substance, and that is the key to his charm. He is simultaneously all-knowing and hopelessly naive. It's quite entertaining, even though the ending could have been done better. I always prefer that the crew of the Enterprise solve their problems without outside help.All-in-all, a light hearted, amusing episode.",4,Light hearted entertainment,989280000,"05 8, 2001",2001,566,"['younger', 'days', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'episode', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'Squire', 'Trelane', 'childishness', 'got', 'nerves', 'Now', 'William', 'Campbell', 'fun', 'playing', 'fop', 'who', 'have', 'extraordinary', 'powers.But', 'sense', 'substance', 'key', 'charm', 'simultaneously', 'all-knowing', 'hopelessly', 'naive', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'even', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'always', 'prefer', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'solve', 'problems', 'outside', 'help.All-in-all', 'light', 'hearted', 'amusing', 'episode']",N/A
207769,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213226,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","The first time you watch this episode, it plays as a traditional (though excellent) story. Kirk and Spock solve a puzzling mystery and overcome an alien who has trapped them.But watching it again recently (and knowing the ending) I was able to see it completely differently. Trelane -- the super-powerful alien in human form who has detained the senior Enterprise officers -- is not the villain at all but is actually the most sympathetic character! Over and over, Trelane eagerly invites the Enterprise officers to ""play"" and makes them his honored guests. Each time, they refuse him rudely and treat him with fear and contempt (although their actions are completely logical from their point of view). All Trelane's reactions make sense once you know what he's really up to.That's the genius of the episode. The actions of Kirk and co. make sense, but the more you watch it, the more sympathetic Trelane becomes. There's a subtlety here: Trelane threatens the crew, but only after they treat him meanly and break his toys. It's arguable that he was never going to hurt anyone despite all his raving. In the end, I suspect he would not have stabbed Kirk -- or if he did, he would have fully repaired Kirk so that the captain could ""play"" again. I believe he really LIKES the humans, so why don't they like him? The answer of course is that intelligent creatures don't like their lives disrupted... but isn't that a lesson that we humans need to learn as well?The acting and writing are first-rate. Shatner has never been better. But Bill Campbell, as Trelane, steals the show. Watch the ending and ask yourself if you are not moved to tears feeling sorry for Trelane. Throughout the episode, watch Campbell's reactions closely. Except when they break his toys or manage to escape, his face shows delight and amusement. This is a powerful clue as to what's really going on.Trek never got better than this. Trelane was so terrific a chararcter that the TNG tried to do something similar with Q, but the Q episodes don't cut it by comparison. Was there ever a better line in Trek than this: ""You broke my sword! You cheated! You're not playing the game right!""",5,The Alien Who Just Wanted to Have Fun,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,2157,"['first', 'time', 'watch', 'episode', 'traditional', 'excellent', 'story', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'solve', 'puzzling', 'mystery', 'overcome', 'alien', 'who', 'trapped', 'watching', 'again', 'recently', 'knowing', 'ending', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'completely', 'differently', 'Trelane', 'super-powerful', 'alien', 'human', 'form', 'who', 'detained', 'senior', 'Enterprise', 'officers', 'not', 'villain', 'actually', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Trelane', 'eagerly', 'Enterprise', 'officers', 'play', 'honored', 'guests', 'time', 'refuse', 'rudely', 'treat', 'fear', 'contempt', 'actions', 'are', 'completely', 'logical', 'point', 'view', 'Trelane', 'reactions', 'make', 'sense', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'up', 'to.That', 'genius', 'episode', 'actions', 'Kirk', 'co.', 'make', 'sense', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Trelane', 'becomes', 'subtlety', 'here', 'Trelane', 'crew', 'only', 'treat', 'meanly', 'break', 'toys', 'arguable', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'raving', 'end', 'suspect', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'stabbed', 'Kirk', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'fully', 'repaired', 'Kirk', 'captain', 'could', 'play', 'again', 'believe', 'really', 'humans', 'so', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'answer', 'course', 'intelligent', 'creatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lives', 'disrupted', ""n't"", 'lesson', 'humans', 'need', 'learn', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'writing', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Shatner', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Bill', 'Campbell', 'Trelane', 'show', 'Watch', 'ending', 'ask', 'are', 'not', 'moved', 'tears', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Trelane', 'episode', 'watch', 'Campbell', 'reactions', 'closely', 'when', 'break', 'toys', 'manage', 'escape', 'face', 'shows', 'delight', 'amusement', 'powerful', 'clue', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'never', 'got', 'better', 'Trelane', 'was', 'so', 'terrific', 'chararcter', 'TNG', 'tried', 'do', 'something', 'similar', 'Q', 'Q', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'comparison', 'Was', 'there', 'ever', 'better', 'line', 'Trek', 'broke', 'sword', 'cheated', ""'re"", 'not', 'playing', 'game', 'right']",N/A
207770,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213226,Charles Ashbacher,"[3, 3]","There are two ways in which this is one of the best episodes in the original Star Trek series. The first is that the crew of the Enterprise encounters a creature (Trelane) that can command great power, and that considers the Enterprise crew to be playthings.  This premise is a very interesting one, because it is so plausible. We humans are culturally conditioned to consider ourselves to be higher level beings, but the law of averages as played out in the universe dictates that we are most certainly not. Our foibles, nature and actions could very likely be a source of amusement for beings capable of easily moving planets.The other way is that it sets the table for some of the best episodes of Star Trek, The Next Generation, as the Q character is obviously modeled from Trelane. ""Encounter At Farpoint"", the first episode of TNG, involves humanity being placed on trial, much like Trelane's placing Captain Kirk on trial in this episode. Trelane has studied Earth history, but somehow doesn't quite get it right. Q and the members of the continuum also never seem to quite be able to accurately solve the human equation, despite their ability to treat time and space like some of us use a television remote.I went back and watched this episode again after viewing the TNG episodes that involved Q. The episode is so well acted and the repartee dialog so well written that I found myself enjoying it more than I ever had before. I found myself wishing that Trelane had made a second appearance in the original series.",5,One of the best of the original series and a harbinger,1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,1524,"['are', 'two', 'ways', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'first', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'creature', 'Trelane', 'can', 'command', 'great', 'power', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'be', 'playthings', 'premise', 'very', 'interesting', 'one', 'so', 'plausible', 'humans', 'are', 'culturally', 'conditioned', 'consider', 'be', 'higher', 'level', 'beings', 'law', 'averages', 'played', 'out', 'universe', 'are', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'foibles', 'nature', 'actions', 'could', 'very', 'likely', 'be', 'source', 'amusement', 'beings', 'capable', 'easily', 'moving', 'other', 'way', 'table', 'best', 'episodes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Q', 'character', 'obviously', 'modeled', 'Trelane', 'Encounter', 'Farpoint', 'first', 'episode', 'TNG', 'humanity', 'being', 'placed', 'trial', 'much', 'Trelane', 'placing', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'trial', 'episode', 'Trelane', 'studied', 'Earth', 'history', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'right', 'Q', 'members', 'continuum', 'also', 'never', 'seem', 'quite', 'be', 'able', 'accurately', 'solve', 'human', 'equation', 'ability', 'treat', 'time', 'space', 'use', 'television', 'remote.I', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'episode', 'again', 'viewing', 'TNG', 'involved', 'Q', 'episode', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'repartee', 'dialog', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'found', 'enjoying', 'more', 'ever', 'had', 'found', 'wishing', 'Trelane', 'had', 'made', 'second', 'appearance', 'original', 'series']",N/A

I didn't come up with this idea but read about it or actually read a novel which says that Trelane is just a &quot;baby&quot; or infant in the Q.This makes sense to me, because Trelane has absolute power to command anything he wants in the universe, however he just dosen't understand why he can't make humans bend to his will obediantly.  The more I saw this episode the more it makes sense to me that Trelane is a member of the Q which has alot of power in the known universe.Anyhow, this is not one of the &quot;classic&quot; episodes of the original series but I believe it introduces the Q earlier than the Next Generation.",4,Trelane...A preview of the Q?,999734400,"09 6, 2001",2001,861,"['good', 'episode', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'important', 'think', 'Trelane', 'antagonist', 'episode', 'could', 'be', 'member', 'Q', 'introduced', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Series', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'read', 'actually', 'read', 'novel', 'Trelane', 'just', 'quot', 'quot', 'infant', 'Q.This', 'sense', 'Trelane', 'absolute', 'power', 'command', 'anything', 'universe', 'however', 'just', 'dose', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'humans', 'bend', 'will', 'obediantly', 'more', 'saw', 'more', 'sense', 'Trelane', 'member', 'Q', 'alot', 'power', 'known', 'universe.Anyhow', 'not', 'one', 'quot', 'classic', 'quot', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', 'believe', 'Q', 'earlier', 'Next', 'Generation']",N/A

This was the first episode I ever saw and it is in my top ten, I cannot believe so many other reviewers found so many faults with it. It has humor, action and one strange alien with a twist.
