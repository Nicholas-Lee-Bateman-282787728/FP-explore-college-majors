This is an absorbing subject, carefully handled about the officer who piloted and drooped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.Even I think Taylor wasn't the most appropriate actor for this role, ( I just can think in three names for that moment: Robert Donat, Fredric March and Michael Redgrave) and the film surely would have elevated to a major status.The only default to my mind is the real nightmare derived from this action; the awful sequels that surrounded the mind and personality of Tibbets are simply absent. There was a very long introduction showing the backgrounds.A well supporting cast accompanied him.

355356,AAW58LG72PG7I,6303091962,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 6]","ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen.",3,Docudrama of Limited Power,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,1825,"['ABOVE', 'AND', 'BEYOND', 'quasi-documentary', 'true', 'life', 'account', 'role', 'Colonel', 'Paul', 'Tibbets', 'played', 'pilot', 'B-29', 'Superfortress', 'dropped', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'Hiroshima', '1945', 'start', 'finish', 'focus', 'squarely', 'pressures', 'placed', 'Tibbets', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'who', 'must', 'endure', 'many', 'months', 'separation', 'while', 'never', 'knowing', 'true', 'objective', 'Taylor', 'Tibbets', 'basically', 'decent', 'sort', 'who', 'confront', 'early', 'will', 'be', 'finger', 'will', 'drop', 'bomb', 'killing', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Japanese', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'key', 'scene', 'when', 'Tibbets', 'commanding', 'officer', 'button', 'push', 'tells', 'more', 'one', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'will', 'perish', 'Tibbets', 'pushing', 'tone', 'movie', 'Tibbets', 'be', 'hard', 'war', 'may', 'end', 'sooner', 'brutal', 'paradox', 'war', 'thousands', 'people', 'live', 'equal', 'number', 'enemy', 'must', 'die', 'wife', 'course', 'not', 'have', 'luxury', 'knowing', 'what', 'reaction', 'resentment', 'eminently', 'understandable', 'ABOVE', 'AND', 'BEYOND', 'not', 'plot', 'driven', 'film', 'more', 'straightforward', 'recording', 'pressures', 'faced', 'one', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'sacrifices', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'win', 'war', 'problem', 'movies', 'Tibbets', 'wife', 'are', 'essentially', 'static', 'characters', 'room', 'growth', 'Taylor', 'emotion', 'growing', 'surly', 'wife', 'becomes', 'stressed', 'out', 'war', 'little', 'more', 'backdrop', 'one', 'family', 'out', 'series', 'squabbles', 'tragedy', 'war', 'films', 'general', 'such', 'squabbles', 'are', 'often', 'inevitable', 'result', 'much', 'greater', 'carnage', 'occurring', 'discretely', 'offscreen']",Above & Beyond VHS

Dad had fond memories of it from seeing it on the big screen in 1952.It seems to me that the movie was designed (maybe inadvertently) to appeal to men AND women. The primary emphasis is how Tibbetts' job of getting a squadron ready to drop the first atomic bombs affected his marriage. That looks pretty dumb in print, but it's true.Much is made of how long the Tibbetts were separated during the war and how the stress of Paul's job and the need for secrecy (even where his wife was concerned) almost caused their marriage to fail.The acting is typical for the era: melodramatic. This aspect of old movies probably turns off more people than black and white does. The characters don't seem real. I don't think anyone talked that way even in World War II.The only actor who seemed the least bit natural was the infant playing the Tibbetts youngest son.This last bit is minor compared to my major gripes, but no other reviewer mentioned it so here goes:After the bomb has exploded the crew of the Enola Gay use binoculars in the cockpit to see fires burning on the ground in Hiroshima.
