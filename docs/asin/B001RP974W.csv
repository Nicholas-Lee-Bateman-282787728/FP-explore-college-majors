1233564,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B001RP974W,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[3, 4]","Legally Blondes was a belated attempt to milk the Legally Blonde franchise for one last time. It was released in 2009 as a made for dvd film rather than for cinema release. Unfortunately no Reese Witherspoon in this one - the nearest she got to it was as Producer.There are attempts to link this film to the previous two Legally Blondes in various ways. The twins, Izzy and Annie, who star are Elle Wood's cousins who share her liking for pink, cute dogs etc. As a piece of trivia, one of the chihuahua's in this film is Bruiser who was also in the original Legally Blonde film. The twins are English and move to California to live in Elle's house with their widowed father. They attend a private school and get involved in cheating allegations in a school test and seek to clear Izzy's name.Quite a light weight offering, clearly directed more at younger viewers than the previous two Legally Blonde films were. It probably works for this audience but adults may well find it disappointing. If you want this film the Legally Blonde Boxset [DVD], containing all three Legally Blonde films probably represents better value.",2,Not in the Same Class as the Previous Films,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,1122,"['Legally', 'Blondes', 'was', 'belated', 'attempt', 'milk', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'franchise', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'released', '2009', 'made', 'dvd', 'film', 'rather', 'cinema', 'release', 'Unfortunately', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'one', 'nearest', 'got', 'was', 'Producer.There', 'are', 'attempts', 'link', 'film', 'previous', 'two', 'Legally', 'Blondes', 'various', 'ways', 'twins', 'Izzy', 'Annie', 'who', 'star', 'are', 'Elle', 'Wood', 'cousins', 'who', 'share', 'liking', 'pink', 'cute', 'dogs', 'etc', 'piece', 'trivia', 'one', 'chihuahua', 'film', 'Bruiser', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'original', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'film', 'twins', 'are', 'English', 'move', 'California', 'live', 'Elle', 'house', 'widowed', 'father', 'attend', 'private', 'school', 'get', 'involved', 'cheating', 'allegations', 'school', 'test', 'seek', 'clear', 'Izzy', 'name.Quite', 'light', 'weight', 'offering', 'clearly', 'directed', 'more', 'younger', 'viewers', 'previous', 'two', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'films', 'were', 'probably', 'audience', 'adults', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'disappointing', 'want', 'film', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'Boxset', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'containing', 'three', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'films', 'probably', 'better', 'value']",Legally Blondes

Never I expected this movie would be this LIGHT (well, they don't have 0 point something)!I think the story is far from original. If there are many people who want to see this, it must be because it's title and how it mentions Elle Woods (who didn't appear for the whole movie)! So unfair!The dialogs between the twins were like a joke. The acting was awful and the play itself didn't help much. The movie was just too full of exaggerations (and most of them are not so enjoyable to see).The DVD ended in my trash after some fast forwards. What a waste of my time and money.

1233567,A4KJTS5P78ICU,B001RP974W,K. Futrell,"[21, 24]","Legally Blondes is a really good movie. Granted it's not as good as the original Legally Blonde movie but hey it's still really good.This movie is about Elle Woods twin cousins (Annabelle and Isabelle Woods) who come to town from the UK. Their father just got a teaching job in California. Elle Woods does NOT make an appearance in the film BUT she is talked about a lot in the film. In fact the twins and their dad stay in Elle Woods house and there are a lot of paintings of Elle Woods and Bruiser displayed in the house. The girls go to the same Prep school as Elle so they are well known by the principal and not well liked by her and some of their classmates. One of the girls gets accused of cheating (I think it is Isabelle) so Annabelle and their friends have to present a case and evidence to prove that Isabelle is innocent. Watch the movie to see if the girls and their friends can save the day.There are some similarities about the Legally Blonde movies and the Legally Blondes movie.  Elle, Annabelle, and Isabelle all love pink, they all have chihuahua's as pets (in fact Elle buys her cousins the dogs), and all three movies involve law type cases.Legally Blondes is aimed towards kids and teens but I am a young adult and I found it to be a really good movie.

Simply, I didn't find a single actor to act well in this movie, although it was not a low budget movie. My boyfriend just said that they wrote ""Looking for low budget actors"" for the casting. If you liked ""Legally Blonde"" don't watch this one, they have nothing in common. By the way the camera guy shooting during the landscape scenes is great, but the one that shoots during people talk obviously doesn't know how to hold the camera.

It tells of their misadventures with a jealous schoolmate as they try to fit into the clique-obssessed elite school culture.
