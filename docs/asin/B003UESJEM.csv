1364391,A1X9RGY6D98LHO,B003UESJEM,"adiadv ""adiadv""","[4, 5]","I think this story delivers an important message in a way that is easily relatable for many people. It's a modern-day take on the age old ""rags-to-riches-to-rags"" theme. The main characters, who have worked their way up the corporate ladder to a life of luxury that others only dream of, are suddenly faced with the cold, hard reality that it can all be taken away in no time at all, no matter who you are. What a crushing blow to learn that years of time and dedication are no longer of value thanks to the almighty to the bottom line. Greed is a powerful force that thrives on gaining more with no regard for the destruction left in its wake.One of the most significant events during my childhood was that of my father losing his job in 1970 and the impact it had on our lives. It was a major blow to his self esteem. He worked for the same mega-corporation that both of my grandfathers had retired from after decades of hard work. He had planned to do the same. He was part of a generation that grew up believing in the benefits of dedicating yourself to a good company and therefore being respected and rewarded for your effort.He was blindsided by a massive downsizing layoff and was distraught at suddenly being unable to support our single-income family. Jobs were scarce because so many other men were in the same situation, and ultimately my parents were forced to sell our newly built home - the dream house they had worked and saved for over the years. They bought a mobile home and we lived on the corner of a relatives property. He found a job at a small manufacturing plant where he was miserable but nonetheless busted his back for 30+ years ... and then was ultimately screwed out of his promised retirement package when the company later went under.I think it's because of that I realized early in my career that business is a game involving players who are driven by their own particular motivation. Some people are team players whose goal is working for the greater good of everyone involved, while others have no true concern for anyone but themselves and will step on everyone who gets in their way. You've got to play the game to succeed, but I believe it's the honest, empathetic and hard-working people who are the winners no matter how many dollar signs are on their paycheck.",5,The higher you get the harder you fall,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,2301,"['think', 'story', 'important', 'message', 'way', 'easily', 'relatable', 'many', 'people', 'modern-day', 'take', 'age', 'old', 'rags-to-riches-to-rags', 'theme', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'way', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'life', 'luxury', 'others', 'only', 'dream', 'are', 'suddenly', 'faced', 'cold', 'hard', 'reality', 'can', 'all', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'time', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'What', 'crushing', 'blow', 'learn', 'years', 'time', 'dedication', 'are', 'longer', 'value', 'thanks', 'almighty', 'bottom', 'line', 'Greed', 'powerful', 'force', 'gaining', 'more', 'regard', 'destruction', 'left', 'wake.One', 'most', 'significant', 'events', 'childhood', 'was', 'father', 'losing', 'job', '1970', 'impact', 'had', 'lives', 'was', 'major', 'blow', 'self', 'esteem', 'worked', 'same', 'mega-corporation', 'grandfathers', 'had', 'retired', 'decades', 'hard', 'work', 'had', 'planned', 'do', 'same', 'was', 'part', 'generation', 'grew', 'up', 'believing', 'benefits', 'dedicating', 'good', 'company', 'therefore', 'being', 'respected', 'rewarded', 'effort.He', 'was', 'blindsided', 'massive', 'downsizing', 'layoff', 'was', 'distraught', 'suddenly', 'being', 'unable', 'support', 'single-income', 'family', 'Jobs', 'were', 'scarce', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'men', 'were', 'same', 'situation', 'ultimately', 'parents', 'were', 'forced', 'sell', 'newly', 'built', 'home', 'dream', 'house', 'had', 'worked', 'saved', 'years', 'bought', 'mobile', 'home', 'lived', 'corner', 'relatives', 'property', 'found', 'job', 'small', 'manufacturing', 'plant', 'where', 'was', 'miserable', 'nonetheless', 'busted', 'back', '30+', 'years', 'then', 'was', 'ultimately', 'screwed', 'promised', 'retirement', 'package', 'when', 'company', 'later', 'went', 'under.I', 'think', 'realized', 'early', 'career', 'business', 'game', 'involving', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'driven', 'own', 'particular', 'motivation', 'people', 'are', 'team', 'players', 'goal', 'working', 'greater', 'good', 'everyone', 'involved', 'others', 'have', 'true', 'concern', 'anyone', 'will', 'step', 'everyone', 'who', 'way', ""'ve"", 'got', 'play', 'game', 'succeed', 'believe', 'honest', 'empathetic', 'hard-working', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'winners', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'dollar', 'signs', 'are', 'paycheck']",N/A

Whereas ""Margin Call"" is told from the business owners'/crooks' side of the economic fallout, ""The Company Men"" shows what happens on both sides of the coin, especially to the ""little guy"" -- the guy who was let go because of the mistakes and greed of company bigwigs. Ben Affleck, who has often been a punching bag for critics when he first started acting -- has now really honed his craft, whether it be acting or directing (The Town). In this film, he portrays a mid-sized bigwig who gets fired and has to work -- any way he can -- to keep his life and family together. Of course, along the way, he learns that there's more to life than he thought. However, from that description and the look of the trailer, don't immediately think this is a sappy feel-good film.

The Company Men is such a movie as it explores the effects of job loss, privilege and the subsequent problems that dog the once very powerful men and their eventual humbling because of that. The film features three men who are high level executives in GTX Corporation and are laid off because the CEO is resisting a buyout offer from a rival and the only way that he could successfully resist this hostile takeover is by boosting the stock price. Stock markets generally react positively to news of cutbacks and these cutbacks would be trimming the workforce. These men are, Ben Affleck, a man who once dreamt of becoming a CEO but forced to move in with his parents and work with his brother in law (Kevin Costner) in construction. Tommy Lee Jones, one of the founding members of this company and one of the few people who still worries about letting people go in the name of cutbacks. Finally there is Chris Cooper, a man who has difficulty fitting in the workforce after spending much of his adult life working for the same corporation.Although most of the proceedings focus on Ben Affleck and his attempt to cope with his job loss. While on the topic of the lives of the once mighty, we also have Kevin Costner who is relegated to playing a side role. This is still a great film about the harsh realities and broken dreams a job loss could bring.

1364397,A2IPC51HL9UUYF,B003UESJEM,"Amy Y. ""Tell me, what is it you plan to do wi...","[1, 2]","For me, this movie was sort of a swing and a miss in the whole feel-good-pull-ourselves-up-by-our-own-bootstraps genre.The movie opens with Bobby(Ben Affleck)going through his usual morning routine- putting on his expensive watch and shiny shoes, leaving his sprawling suburban mcmansion in his PorscheAfflecks character is not particularly sympathetic in the beginning.  He's the guy living in the suburbs in his Mcmansion, loaded down with all the trappings of the 'good life'- wife, kid, expensive watch, shiny shoes, porsche, club membership...  their family is certainly 'keeping up with the Joneses'.  The movie opens with him going into the office on a typical day, only to find he's been downsized.  The upside?  Some enthusiastic life coaching and a job search service provided in his severance.  It's not long before he's lost his house, waves bye-bye to the porsche that he found so pathetically difficult with which to part and moves in with his parents.Kevin Costner is a bright light in this overall depressing film- he plays Bobby's brother-in-law who gives him a job on his construction crew.  Jack is one of the more likable(and believable) characters in the film and helps Bobby shed some of that corporate veneer so we can see his underlying work ethic.Chris Cooper plays an older manager who is also downsized.  Pressure builds throughout the film as we follow both men struggling to hold onto, not just their homes and families, but their identities.Tommy Lee Jones plays an executive who was part of 'building the company from the ground up'- somehow his idealism is a little hard to swallow given that he's living the cushy executive life until he, too, is downsized.These and a few other minor characters converge in the midst of tragedy and some small triumphs(like Bobby finally earning his tool belt).  Jones' character has a vision of starting over- rebuilding what he built in the first place.The movie tries to end on an up note and it seems like the movie was intended to inspire and instill hope.  There is some heavy-handed moralizing on the evils of corporate greed, executive pork and disregard for everything and everyone but the bottom line.  The whole 'Can we build it? Yes we can!' message seems a bit trite and sophomoric.  I'm not entirely sure if we are meant to sympathize that the guys at the top were hit just as hard with losing their luxury cars and big houses, or extrapolate that this country can fix itself in the time it takes to watch an episode of ""Bob the Builder"", or is this just a lets-see-these-guys-pull-themselves-up-by-their-bootstraps-YAY! movie gone wrong.  I found it depressing overall.I'm giving it three stars because I did find myself rooting for Tommy Lee Jones' character, despite his unrealistic rose-colored glasses.  Kevin Costner was excellent in his role.  I probably would have even given it four stars if Ben Affleck wasn't playing.... da da dum HIMSELF! yet again.I don't know who I would recommend this movie to... maybe the guy that handed me my severance in 2008?

Men come to be defined by their jobs and when the job is taken away from them, they are lost.  Their world as they understand it simply collapses.At a high level, ""The Company Men"" covers the lives of several executives of the ship building division of GTX Corporation, an American conglomerate.  Profitability and growth seems to be eluding the division and the only response of management is downsizing and, when this fails, more downsizing.  Each man is thrown into a whirlpool.  Their lives of debt and over-consumption come to a screeching halt.  If there is one message from this film it is that too many people assume that things won't change.  Too little attention is paid to saving for a rainy day.  Consumption is king.There are excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Ben Affleck.  Both end up being ""let go"" and both struggle with the consequences.  However, eventually, reality must be faced.  This is not an easy row to hoe.  In the case of Ben Affleck's character, his life style is forced to undergo big changes.  His house is sold, his family moves back to living with his parents, his wife gets a part time job and he takes a job of manual labour from his brother in law.Without spoiling the plot, there is a somewhat happier ending.

Did anyone else just KNOW right away that the character played by Chris Cooper (Phil) would commit suicide? I watched it alone so I can't provide sworn testimony, but within 3 minutes of seeing Phil I said (probably aloud), ""He's going to kill himself."" Either I'm quite prescient or he WAAAAY telegraphed his hand. Not good in Texas Hold'em, or early in a movie, for that matter. Surprised the director didn't do something to disguise the obvious. Kind of wasted the whole 2 minutes leading up to the act.Overall, pretty good flick. Tommy L Jones was his usual self...comme ci, comme a. Affleck was a great choice for the lead. As good as I've seen him. The other players were more than adequate. Unless this movie sat on the shelf for a coupla years, I have to wonder why they had it set with Bush as Prez.

The movie primary focus is on three employees; a sales manager making over $160K a year, a founding member of the company who has stock options worth well over $500K alone, and a director who makes well over $200K.  Yep, this reviewer has a son who joined the National Guard and is on tour #2 in Iraq, another son in the US Navy and he hopes to make it through the tour to go to college, and I was voluntarily recalled from retirement to support military operations for Iraq.  Sorry, folks, I didn't feel a bit of sympathy for people who were never close to starvation, real homelessness, or danger.  Cripes, they were actually griping that they would have to eat out less.  Oh, the tragedy of missing meals from a five star restaurant.Is the movie compelling?  Yes, if you feel that people who have fantastic pay, benefits, and status now have to face a little uncertainty in their lives.  Most of us would merely say ""welcome to the real world, pal.""  Since these men are not getting shot at I would have merely told them to ""suck it up and drive on.""  Really, the movie show's Ben Affleck's character of losing his beloved Porsche 911 sports car.  Got that?  It's a traumatic event that he had to sell it.  O.K.?  Now, this isn't some poor soldier who enlisted in the Army to get education benefits for college and has to dodge explosives in Afghanistan like in the movieRestrepo.  This is an Ivy League educated man with an MBA who gave up his beloved Porsche and has to drive a station wagon.  Oh, the tragedy.Was the movie well acted?  Yes, all the actors were pretty good.  It's a little weird to see how long-in-the-tooth Tommy Lee Jones has become.  He looks old, worn, and should have taken the company buy out.  Kevin Costner gives a belivable performance as a working man and good brother-in-law.  Chris Cooper reprises his role fromThe Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition); he is a mid-level manager trying to protect himself.  Craig Nelson, who was an A list actor at one time, does not seem evil as the company owner.  Why?  In his words, ""it's a company and not a charity organization.""  Ben Affleck is Ben Affleck; the package says it all.  And I felt no sympathy for a man who made over $180K a year and is now carrying plywood to help his working brother-in-law.The movie has a good story, it has competent actors, and the mood is consistent.

1364403,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003UESJEM,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[3, 4]","FILM RATING: 3.5 starsThe Company Men (2010) is a gripping 21st century drama about white collar men loosing their jobs and a part of themselves in our recent (and still current) Great Recession. This movie has been mostly overlooked, which is too bad, because this is a very good film that deserves to be seen. I can see why people wouldn't want to see it, because it hits very close to home. But hopefully it will find its audience on Blu-ray and DVD. I saw it in the theater back in January when it was finally released after several postponements.Screenwriter and first time feature film Director John Wells has crafted a movie that really speaks to me and my predicament these past 4 years...as I'm sure it does for millions of Americans. I for one escape into film not only to avoid the reality of my life and to be entertained, but also to find solace and sympathy in knowing that I'm not alone in what I'm experiencing or have experienced. There's a cathartic healing that film brings my psyche and emotional soul when it powerfully connects its stories and characters to my own life's journey. I can see I'm not alone. I know you know what I'm talking about. So I really don't have to say anything more.The story of The Company Men is simple: It follows the lives of 3 men who lose their jobs due to a failing economy. But they find out that their jobs were more than just jobs. As men, we have a built-in programming that we tend to define ourselves by our work, our titles, our income, our family, our accomplishments, and everything else that we do and get. What happens when all of that is taken away? Who are we then? And what do we do with our lives? How do we define ourselves without our work and our material belongings? What do we tell other people when they ask who we are and what we do? These are just some of the questions and ideas that The Company Men explores, but unfortunately doesn't really answer the way I think it should have. One of my disappointments in The Company Men is how the movie spends 90% of its time showing us the intricate complexities, paradoxes and lack of answers for everything I've mentioned, but then rushes to wrap it all up into a nice, relatively happy Hollywood ending where everyone ultimately goes back to their original jobs in a new form. I've gone through pretty much all of the same experiences over the past 4 years as The Company Men do. I lost my job (as an Architect), which then turned into a feeling of losing my career since I couldn't find another job in the same field for years. I lost most of, if not all, my income. I had to sell many of my belongings, face losing my home and everything that defined me, and discover who I really am in the face of real adversity. I've downsized to a quarter-sized lifestyle of my previous one. And it still hasn't ended ""happy"" per se. I'm still not working again as an architect. I do believe things have worked out by me redefining myself and that I'm on a better foundation now than the shaky one I had built, ironically, as only an architect. But I don't feel like The Company Men shows enough of that struggle and forced redefinition. Granted, my situation is unique to me, so maybe I'm too close to this story and not unbiased enough to evaluate it. Maybe most people will go back to what they were doing before. Hard to answer right now.My point to this discussion is that what I really like about The Company Men is its willingness to look at these ideas and explore them from a number of points of view. Even if I don't totally agree with how these ideas and characters get resolved in this movie. Anyone who  has had to rethink things and redefined themselves due to the Great Recession, should find something in The Company Men that they can relate to. And I'm grateful that a film like this is out there for each of us to seek out, whether its now or in the future when things are good again or people are ready to look at these stories. Or maybe things will never go back to the way they were? We will see.Ben Affleck, Chris Cooper, and Tommy Lee Jones lead the fantastic ensemble cast here, which includes Kevin Costner, Maria Bello, and Craig T. Nelson. All of these actors bring their A-game to The Company Men and make it a very good study on character acting. I can see why they all signed on to this project...it was an opportunity to bite into some juicy dialogue and serious storytelling. If it weren't for the subject matter, I think they would all be receiving more praise for their work here.The filmmaking craft is solid in The Company Men, with good cinematography and production design, good editing, music that works for the most part to convey the film's emotional content, and writing that works through most of the film in telling its story and keeping my interest. In a lesser year for film, The Company Men would probably have made my Top 10 movies of the year, but there were just too many very good 3.5 star films in 2010. I've got at least a dozen of them. The Company Men is one of that pack that  should show up in your home theater at some point.",4,A movie that captures my own predicament in the Great Recession,1300492800,"03 19,

1364406,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B003UESJEM,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[0, 0]","The Company Men explores the very contemporary issues of the effect of redundancy during a recession and its specific effect on the personal lives of the people at the receiving end of the dreaded layoff notice. There are several stages to the process. Firstly, from the corporate perspective the company, in this case a company in shipbuilding, is under enormous pressure to perform for its stockholders as the economic slump bites and orders fall off. The all too predictable response is to cut costs and since payroll is the biggest cost, this means cutting jobs.The axe cuts deep and the company is forced to make difficult decisions to terminate long serving and loyal staff. The film focuses on three of these people and explores the various personal issues involved. There is initial incredulity and some bitterness that they could have been treated in this way, but optimism about finding a new job. Then realisation that it is difficult in a harsh economic climate for someone of 37 to find employment, let alone someone nearing retirement. People react in different ways to both the emotional issues of being out of a job and the economic implications and most of the film focuses on these aspects.This an interesting and absorbing film, but in many ways depressing as the situation it describes is one which many people will be able to relate to or will have experienced at some stage in their lives. Ben Affleck plays a confident Sales Director, Chris Cooper is the older, senior executive, who has worked his way up from the shop floor and Tommy Lee Jones is one of the company's founders and a senior statesman. Affleck is particularly outstanding and his reaction to the economic reality of his new status is quite revealing as the trappings of his middle class life style are impacted. You may not feel a lot of sympathy for the plight of these guys as they are obviously well off, but expenditure grows to the level of income and when the income stops............So to summarise, a worthwhile film which explores important and real life issues, but certainly not a light hearted way to while away an hour or two.",4,Serious Film Exploring Real Life Issues,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,2129,"['Company', 'Men', 'very', 'contemporary', 'issues', 'effect', 'redundancy', 'recession', 'specific', 'effect', 'personal', 'lives', 'people', 'receiving', 'end', 'dreaded', 'layoff', 'notice', 'are', 'several', 'stages', 'process', 'Firstly', 'corporate', 'perspective', 'company', 'case', 'company', 'shipbuilding', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'perform', 'stockholders', 'economic', 'slump', 'bites', 'orders', 'fall', 'off', 'too', 'predictable', 'response', 'cut', 'costs', 'payroll', 'biggest', 'cost', 'cutting', 'jobs.The', 'axe', 'cuts', 'deep', 'company', 'forced', 'make', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'terminate', 'long', 'serving', 'loyal', 'staff', 'film', 'three', 'people', 'various', 'personal', 'issues', 'involved', 'initial', 'incredulity', 'bitterness', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'way', 'optimism', 'finding', 'new', 'job', 'Then', 'realisation', 'difficult', 'harsh', 'economic', 'climate', 'someone', '37', 'find', 'employment', 'let', 'alone', 'someone', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'People', 'react', 'different', 'ways', 'emotional', 'issues', 'being', 'job', 'economic', 'implications', 'most', 'film', 'interesting', 'absorbing', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'depressing', 'situation', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'will', 'have', 'experienced', 'stage', 'lives', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'confident', 'Sales', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'older', 'senior', 'executive', 'who', 'worked', 'way', 'shop', 'floor', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'one', 'company', 'founders', 'senior', 'statesman', 'Affleck', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'reaction', 'economic', 'reality', 'new', 'status', 'quite', 'revealing', 'trappings', 'middle', 'class', 'life', 'style', 'are', 'impacted', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'lot', 'sympathy', 'plight', 'guys', 'are', 'obviously', 'well', 'expenditure', 'level', 'income', 'when', 'income', 'stops', 'So', 'summarise', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'important', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'certainly', 'not', 'light', 'hearted', 'way', 'while', 'away', 'hour', 'two']",N/A

Society is often quick to be critical about big business and unfairly uncritical of the poor; yet, no one is willing to ask, ""how did ""the Poor"" become poor?""  They didn't become that way overnight, and society never wants to put the blame on the poor.  Why work when the government is willing to give you money free?  The Company Men was a real eye-opener.",5,The Company Men film,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,733,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'informative', 'giving', 'different', 'perspective', 'corporations', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'people', 'bash', 'corporations', 'thinking', 'are', 'merely', 'businesses', 'however', 'film', 'see', 'people', 'actually', 'make', 'up', 'corporation', 'Seeing', 'real', 'people', 'how', 'suffering', 'economy', 'little', 'light', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'Society', 'often', 'quick', 'be', 'critical', 'big', 'business', 'unfairly', 'uncritical', 'poor', 'yet', 'one', 'willing', 'ask', 'how', 'did', 'Poor', 'become', 'poor', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'way', 'overnight', 'society', 'never', 'put', 'blame', 'poor', 'Why', 'work', 'when', 'government', 'willing', 'give', 'money', 'free', 'Company', 'Men', 'was', 'real', 'eye-opener']",N/A

Velasquez,"[0, 0]","A time will come in which the current crisis caused by the sharks of Wall Street and the banks, among others, is going to be examined in more detail by Hollywood. We need a strong testament about how greed is always a cause for so much misery - even if we don't learn from it. Perhaps the riveting and unforgettable ""The Company Men"" will suffice for now. It is a warning call for those who watch it and those who have been suffering due to our present economic mess.Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is a young, successful high-profile executive at GTX (Global Transportation Systems). Just when everything is going well for him, he is informed that there has been a consolidation at the corporation, and that his position has become redundant. Because of this, he is fired. As you can imagine, everything down spirals for him from then on. He lives in a big house, drives a fancy car and has a beautiful wife and two children. With time, pressure begins mounting and he can not make payments anymore. He tries to look for jobs, but has no success. Eventually, Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), one of his co-workers, is also fired, as well was Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), who happened to be their boss. Curiously, Gene, together with James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), were two of the original employees of GTX. Salinger eventually becomes the owner of the company and begins consolidating his power, guided by greed and corporate sharing. He uses Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) as his henchwoman, who is in charge of downsizing personnel. The film guides us through the lives of Walker, McClary, and Wood ward, as they desperately try to survive.""The Company Men"" is honest and eye-opening. It tells us that we are all together in the current state of things - in this particular case, the movie focuses on extremely highly-paid employees, including a millionaire. It shows the evolution of despair in great detail, and how it affects the family and the self-respect of the individuals who are victims of downsizing. It also shows the role of wives in sharing the pain. The film also stars Kevin Costner as Bobby's brother-in-law. The way the movie ends, I won't be surprised if there is a sequel - it screams for one. ""The Company Men"" is a great companion to ""Wall Street,"" and Ben Affleck's character will remind you to the one that he played in ""Jersey Girl.""

1364412,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJEM,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 9]","""The Company Men"" tells the story of people caught in the economic downturn that began in September of 2008. It's a timely and well-crafted film, although I suspect the intention was less about thoughtful examination and more about appealing to the masses. Many films are intentionally designed to garner sympathy, but few are this forthcoming about it; scenes and characters are so perfectly in tune with real events that we're basically required to see things from their point of view, and if we don't, we might as well move to another planet. I have no doubt that many people will leave the theater feeling as if the film spoke directly to them, that it understood their plight, that it said the things few have been willing to say. It's a satisfying experience, but keep in mind that satisfaction can be the result of manipulation.The working characters in this film have built their lives around a Boston-based shipbuilding corporation called GTX. As a result of the bad economy, the company has been downsizing. One of its casualties is Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck), who had grown accustomed to the Porsche, the golf games, and the expensive suburban house his six-figure income allowed him. His severance package includes temporary placement at a job search center, where he will learn how to improve his resume, listen to motivational speeches, and sit in a cubical all day making calls to companies he feels qualified to work for. Despite these efforts, he's unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle, for he wants to maintain his image. His wife, Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt), lovingly but firmly reminds him that an image is far less important than providing for his family.Bobby is consistently sneered at by his brother-in-law, Jack (Kevin Costner), who owns a small construction company and swears by honest manual labor. He and his crew are building a house, and despite his misgivings, he offers Bobby a job. This means, of course, that Bobby will have to swallow his pride and actually join the working class, which he has always felt was beneath him. With this in mind, it seems clear to me that Jack, while a decent and competent character, is little more than a tool at the mercy of the plot, a way to make Bobby understand and appreciate the value of hard work. I had a much better response to Bobby's teenage son, Drew (Anthony O'Leary); Bobby's intention is to set a good example for his son, but it's ultimately Drew who sets a good example for his father.Another casualty is Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), who quickly learns that few companies are interested in an unemployed executive pushing sixty. It's strongly suggested that he dye his hair. He's warned against including jobs prior to the 1990s on his resume, for those are considered ancient history. He's told to avoid making specific references to Vietnam when listing his military experience. As the months go by, he begins to realize how much his life was defined by his work, which essentially boiled down to making money for GTX. He believed he was valued; he didn't know his worth was in direct proportion to the status of his company. He learns the hard way that, once you've been fired from an executive position, it's a little too late to discover you're no good at anything else.Yet another casualty is Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), who started GTX with James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson). They're both of a time and place in which corporations served a purpose and its employees were honest and treated with respect. Gene maintains a belief in those ideals. The same cannot be said of James - he believes that companies exist primarily to capitalize on profits, and if that requires many of its employees to lose their jobs, then so be it. Gene is so embroiled in this aspect of the story that I can't help but wonder why it was deemed necessary to include a subplot with his wife (Patricia Kalember), who he leaves for his mistress, Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello), who just happens to be the same woman responsible for firing Bobby.I responded to these characters, and I certainly responded to the story. Still, ""The Company Men"" never quite becomes the illuminating masterpiece it was so clearly intended to be. It deftly addresses current economic issues, but the plot feels manufactured for mass consumption. Perhaps I was hoping for another version of ""Up in the Air,"" which was both considerate and heartbreaking in its examination of a man whose life is his job, which is nothing more nor less than relieving other people of their jobs. That movie humanized the economic downturn far more effectively, and it also managed to tell a thoroughly absorbing story. ""The Company Men"" is decent overall, but it's more like wish fulfillment, a story designed with the sole purpose of winning over an audience.",3,Casualties of the Economy,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,4791,"['Company', 'Men', 'story', 'people', 'caught', 'economic', 'downturn', 'began', 'September', '2008', 'timely', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'suspect', 'intention', 'was', 'less', 'thoughtful', 'examination', 'more', 'about', 'appealing', 'masses', 'Many', 'films', 'are', 'intentionally', 'designed', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'few', 'are', 'forthcoming', 'scenes', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'tune', 'real', 'events', ""'re"", 'basically', 'required', 'see', 'things', 'point', 'view', 'do', ""n't"", 'might', 'as', 'well', 'move', 'planet', 'have', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'leave', 'theater', 'feeling', 'film', 'spoke', 'directly', 'understood', 'plight', 'said', 'things', 'few', 'have', 'been', 'willing', 'say', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'keep', 'mind', 'satisfaction', 'can', 'be', 'result', 'manipulation.The', 'working', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'built', 'lives', 'Boston-based', 'shipbuilding', 'corporation', 'called', 'GTX', 'result', 'bad', 'economy', 'company', 'been', 'downsizing', 'One', 'casualties', 'Bobby', 'Walker', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'Porsche', 'golf', 'games', 'expensive', 'suburban', 'house', 'six-figure', 'income', 'allowed', 'severance', 'package', 'temporary', 'placement', 'job', 'search', 'center', 'where', 'will', 'learn', 'how', 'improve', 'resume', 'listen', 'motivational', 'speeches', 'sit', 'cubical', 'day', 'making', 'calls', 'companies', 'qualified', 'work', 'efforts', 'unwilling', 'scale', 'back', 'lifestyle', 'maintain', 'image', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'lovingly', 'firmly', 'image', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'providing', 'family.Bobby', 'consistently', 'sneered', 'brother-in-law', 'Jack', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'small', 'construction', 'company', 'swears', 'honest', 'manual', 'labor', 'crew', 'are', 'building', 'house', 'misgivings', 'Bobby', 'job', 'course', 'Bobby', 'will', 'have', 'swallow', 'pride', 'actually', 'join', 'working', 'class', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'mind', 'clear', 'Jack', 'decent', 'competent', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'tool', 'mercy', 'plot', 'way', 'make', 'Bobby', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'value', 'hard', 'work', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'response', 'Bobby', 'teenage', 'son', 'Drew', 'Anthony', ""O'Leary"", 'Bobby', 'intention', 'set', 'good', 'example', 'son', 'ultimately', 'Drew', 'who', 'good', 'example', 'father.Another', 'casualty', 'Phil', 'Woodward', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'quickly', 'few', 'companies', 'are', 'interested', 'unemployed', 'executive', 'pushing', 'sixty', 'strongly', 'suggested', 'hair', 'warned', 'including', 'jobs', 'prior', '1990s', 'resume', 'are', 'considered', 'ancient', 'history', 'told', 'avoid', 'making', 'specific', 'references', 'Vietnam', 'when', 'listing', 'military', 'experience', 'months', 'go', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'was', 'defined', 'work', 'essentially', 'boiled', 'down', 'making', 'money', 'GTX', 'believed', 'was', 'valued', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'worth', 'was', 'direct', 'proportion', 'status', 'company', 'hard', 'way', 'once', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fired', 'executive', 'position', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'discover', ""'re"", 'good', 'anything', 'else.Yet', 'casualty', 'Gene', 'McClary', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'started', 'GTX', 'James', 'Salinger', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', ""'re"", 'time', 'place', 'corporations', 'served', 'purpose', 'employees', 'were', 'honest', 'treated', 'respect', 'Gene', 'belief', 'ideals', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'James', 'companies', 'exist', 'primarily', 'capitalize', 'profits', 'many', 'employees', 'lose', 'jobs', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'Gene', 'so', 'embroiled', 'aspect', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'deemed', 'necessary', 'include', 'subplot', 'wife', 'Patricia', 'Kalember', 'who', 'mistress', 'Sally', 'Wilcox', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'same', 'woman', 'responsible', 'firing', 'Bobby.I', 'responded', 'characters', 'certainly', 'responded', 'story', 'Still', 'Company', 'Men', 'never', 'quite', 'illuminating', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'so', 'clearly', 'intended', 'be', 'deftly', 'current', 'economic', 'issues', 'plot', 'feels', 'manufactured', 'mass', 'consumption', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'hoping', 'version', 'Up', 'Air', 'was', 'considerate', 'heartbreaking', 'examination', 'man', 'life', 'job', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'relieving', 'other', 'people', 'jobs', 'movie', 'humanized', 'economic', 'downturn', 'far', 'more', 'effectively', 'also', 'managed', 'tell', 'thoroughly', 'absorbing', 'story', 'Company', 'Men', 'decent', 'overall', 'more', 'like', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'story', 'designed', 'sole', 'purpose', 'winning', 'audience']",N/A

It isn't difficult to feel some sympathy watching a six figure executive interview (and be rejected) for a job at half his former salary, losing his home, moving back with his parents, and enduring multiple humiliations.  I applaud the film for addressing age discrimination.  Not only for those in their 50s and 60s, but even the key role being turned down for a job at age 37 because ""new college graduates will work 90 hours a week at less pay"".  The personal coach tells an unemployed 50 something, that he needs to dye his hair, eliminate any reference to Vietnam, and all the ""ancient pre-90s"" items from his resume.  Sound familiar to anyone?  You leave out dates and some of your key accomplishments because it was too long ago, but what happens when they look at you during the interview - you'll need more than hair dye.  The movie also pointed out the realities of co-worker reactions to a layoff - they ask if their position will be cut, rather than showing any compassion for the poor guy packing his personal items from his desk in a box.  It also focuses on the fact that, since the U.S. essentially gave up on production, we've lost decent, honest jobs that provided a living wage to hundreds of thousands of workers.

Far from it.  Its fundamental flaw is that its makers don't understand the real world of American business well enough to create a compelling drama about the impact a threatened, downsizing company has on its workers and their families, which is the film's goal.The film's main characters, besides being unappealing, are all simple stereotypes.  Ben Affleck is far too perfect and glib as a golfing, Porsche-driving yuppie who has to discover what it means to do an honest day's work with his hands.  Tommy Lee Jones, I fear, has lost it as an actor - he looks, sounds and acts very old in this film, and the fact that he gets to bed a fairly good-looking blonde boggles the mind.

Ben Affleck plays a well-paid salesman for a big corporation who is laid off without warning and within moments, we are deep into cliche land. He refuses to believe he will be jobless for long. He is snappy with his kids. He won't admit he has to sell his nice car. His saintly wife, as interesting and complex as a sheet of tissue paper, says she has faith in him. Affleck's two immediate bosses at the firm keep their jobs for the time being but are very hard to tell apart and my wife and I kept asking each other ""So which one is that?"" Other characters make so minor an impression that we couldn't figure out whether the nasty human resources woman who keeps firing people was having an affair with one of the senior bosses or not. Back in cliche land, Affleck is forced to take a building job offered to him by his brother-in-law and -- drum roll as we plunge deep into the dire heart of the movie -- he discovers there is more to slaving away for a corporation. He reconnects with his wife. He comes home early enough to play basketball with his disaffected son. He goes for a walk around the deserted ship yard his firm once ran and listens to one of his bosses talking about how great it was to actually make something. And before you know it, that boss has bought the yard, and gives Affleck and all his pals their jobs back.

1364423,A2QX49LS3Y3ANI,B003UESJEM,Dienne,"[1, 2]","I'll admit up front that I'm more of a book reviewer and not the greatest movie critic.  I'm not always good at distinguishing good or bad writing from good or bad acting, and I have never been able to figure out what impact the director has.  Furthermore, I know next to nothing about cinematography, so I won't be discussing things like camera angles or lighting design.  That said, in my decidedly inexpert opinion, this is a valiant attempt on the part of some very good actors to breathe life into a rather clich&eacute;d and flat movie.Ben Affleck plays a 37-year-old rising star salesman, Bobby Walker at a company called GTX which used to build ships, but now doesn't build much of anything.  He strolls confidently into a meeting, both on top of his golf game and on top of his world, only to find that he's greeted as one of the walking dead.  Maybe he shouldn't have blown off Sally Wilson (Maria Bello) from HR.Bobby is blind-sided by the unexpected blow and the only response he seems capable of is utter denial.  His experience with ""outplacement services"" should have told him something - the ridiculous orientation exercises wherein participants are told directly, ""we are not an employment agency"", the cramped and already filled cubicles filled with people who have been there for months.  But Bobby isn't deterred.  He is, after all, a hot commodity.  He's worth $160,000.  He'll have a job in no time.  At least, in his own mind.His practical (and practically saintly) wife Maggie sees it a bit differently and wants to make some changes.  Put the house on the market, give up the club, maybe sell the Porsche.  But Bobby won't have it.  Bobby is not a likable character - he's full of himself, spoiled, entitled and arrogant.  We're not supposed to like him.  The more he pities himself (when reality finally breaks through at all), the less we do.  But he's a reflection of the young up-and-coming professionals who were, in some ways, hit hardest by the crash of 2008.  They were people who thought that they were on top of the world and untouchable.  They thought the dream would never end, so they never saw a reason to behave as though it would.  Maintaining the image needed to constantly get ahead was more important than saving for a rainy day that would never come.  That is, until it did.All the characters are basically stereotypes of characters commonly found in the business world:  the ruthless, heartless CEO (Craig T. Nelson) who turns his back on even his closest friend; the caring but largely inert boss (Tommy Lee Jones) who stands helplessly by while workers are cut off by the thousands; Maria Bello, the cold and calculating HR witch; Chris Cooper, the epitome of the ""company man"" who's given his life to the company and has nothing else left.As I mentioned, the movie is rather flat and clich&eacute;d throughout, but it becomes moreso the more it attempts to redeem Bobby (and the other characters).  Bobby gradually makes the hard choices and we revel in his fall as he moves in with family, stoops to doing construction work for his brother-in-law.  But Bobby also becomes more human as he finally accepts the reality laid out before him.  He becomes a better husband.  He reconnects with his wife.  He finds time for his troubled son.  And (cue the Hallelujah Chorus here), he finally finds another job.  Sure, it pays about half what he was making, but dear Bobby has learned his lesson and all is right with the world again.  Sigh.The movie is enjoyable enough to watch.  It does reflect a number of brutal truths of life in the corporate world and especially about the kinds of people who inhabit (and even live for) that world.  The ending, trite though it is, gives a brief if empty uplift.  The actors turned in performances ranging from decent to excellent, especially Tommy Lee Jones.But, precisely because of the ""feel good"" nature of the ending, it is ultimately unsatisfying.  It's a fantasy of the way most of us would probably like the world to work, but it's certainly not the world most of us live in.  A more realistic film would have been more depressing to watch but would have the potential to be more rewarding.  It could have pointed the way toward a world beyond the corporate-controlled work-a-day world.  It could have told more truths about human nature, the state of life in this country, and the stark choices we face as a society.",3,"Like popcorn:  satisfying, but only temporarily",1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,4408,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'up', 'front', ""'m"", 'more', 'book', 'reviewer', 'not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'critic', ""'m"", 'not', 'always', 'good', 'distinguishing', 'good', 'bad', 'writing', 'good', 'bad', 'acting', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'impact', 'director', 'Furthermore', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'cinematography', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'discussing', 'things', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'design', 'said', 'decidedly', 'inexpert', 'opinion', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'breathe', 'life', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'flat', 'movie.Ben', 'Affleck', '37-year-old', 'rising', 'star', 'salesman', 'Bobby', 'Walker', 'company', 'called', 'GTX', 'used', 'build', 'ships', 'now', ""n't"", 'build', 'much', 'anything', 'confidently', 'meeting', 'top', 'golf', 'game', 'top', 'world', 'only', 'find', 'greeted', 'one', 'walking', 'dead', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'blown', 'off', 'Sally', 'Wilson', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'HR.Bobby', 'blind-sided', 'unexpected', 'blow', 'only', 'response', 'capable', 'utter', 'denial', 'experience', 'outplacement', 'services', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'orientation', 'exercises', 'wherein', 'participants', 'are', 'told', 'directly', 'are', 'not', 'employment', 'agency', 'cramped', 'already', 'filled', 'cubicles', 'filled', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'months', 'Bobby', ""n't"", 'deterred', 'hot', 'commodity', 'worth', '160,000', ""'ll"", 'have', 'job', 'time', 'least', 'own', 'mind.His', 'practical', 'practically', 'saintly', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'bit', 'differently', 'make', 'changes', 'Put', 'house', 'market', 'give', 'up', 'club', 'maybe', 'sell', 'Porsche', 'Bobby', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'Bobby', 'not', 'likable', 'character', 'full', 'spoiled', 'entitled', 'arrogant', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'like', 'more', 'when', 'reality', 'finally', 'less', 'do', 'reflection', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'professionals', 'who', 'were', 'ways', 'hit', 'hardest', 'crash', '2008', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'top', 'world', 'untouchable', 'thought', 'dream', 'would', 'never', 'end', 'never', 'saw', 'reason', 'behave', 'would', 'Maintaining', 'image', 'needed', 'constantly', 'get', 'ahead', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'saving', 'rainy', 'day', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'stereotypes', 'characters', 'commonly', 'found', 'business', 'world', 'ruthless', 'heartless', 'CEO', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'who', 'back', 'even', 'closest', 'friend', 'caring', 'largely', 'inert', 'boss', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'helplessly', 'workers', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'thousands', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'cold', 'calculating', 'HR', 'witch', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'epitome', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'life', 'company', 'nothing', 'else', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'rather', 'flat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'more', 'redeem', 'Bobby', 'other', 'characters', 'Bobby', 'gradually', 'hard', 'choices', 'revel', 'fall', 'family', 'doing', 'construction', 'work', 'brother-in-law', 'Bobby', 'also', 'more', 'human', 'finally', 'reality', 'laid', 'out', 'better', 'husband', 'wife', 'time', 'troubled', 'son', 'cue', 'Hallelujah', 'Chorus', 'here', 'finally', 'job', 'Sure', 'what', 'was', 'making', 'dear', 'Bobby', 'learned', 'lesson', 'right', 'world', 'again', 'Sigh.The', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'watch', 'reflect', 'number', 'brutal', 'truths', 'life', 'corporate', 'world', 'especially', 'kinds', 'people', 'who', 'inhabit', 'even', 'live', 'world', 'ending', 'trite', 'brief', 'empty', 'uplift', 'actors', 'turned', 'performances', 'ranging', 'decent', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones.But', 'precisely', 'feel', 'good', 'nature', 'ending', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'fantasy', 'way', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'world', 'work', 'certainly', 'not', 'world', 'most', 'live', 'more', 'realistic', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'depressing', 'watch', 'would', 'have', 'potential', 'be', 'more', 'rewarding', 'could', 'have', 'pointed', 'way', 'world', 'corporate-controlled', 'work-a-day', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'more', 'truths', 'human', 'nature', 'state', 'life', 'country', 'stark', 'choices', 'face', 'society']",N/A

1364428,A2EDTVVR9IFNLW,B003UESJEM,Doug Hibbard,"[0, 0]","This movie provides a glimpse, Hollywood-style, into what happens to the white-collar workers when the downsizing moves to their jobs. It is presented in the middle of what I've seen a few other films do: some films simply vilify the wealthy men and show them getting their just desserts of financial collapse. Others push for the mythical view of chivalrous wealth.The Company Men tries to shoot down the middle. One character is troubled by the damage caused to attain his wealth, but his solution is hardly self-sacrificing. There's the one who can't cope, there's the one who just doesn't care, and the one who survives because he's got a great wife. What else? Of course, the hard-working folks who aren't living in the upper-class lifestyle who go back and forth between sympathy and near-gloating.In all, the mainline of this film is that life at the top may be well-compensated but it's still empty. It's easy to lob stones up the line, that with all that money they should have been happy and all that, to think how much better off they were than others, but the truth is, the crisis is just as real.

1364429,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003UESJEM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","THE COMPANY MEN (2010, but not released until 2011, 105 minutes, do not confuse with the other comedyCompany Man [HD], see my review or withCompany Man [HD]) is probably one of the most important movies of this era. In the near future I wager it will be considered a downright unequalled classic. I cannot say I feel that way about it now ... but it has a vital symbolism that I would not have wanted to miss. What attracts my curiosity is why this film seems to have been buried and ignored.Corporate monster GTX, based in Gloucester, Massachusetts and responsible for the rape of New England, is downsizing suddenly and savagely. The depression we keep pretending is a recession is hitting hard and fast. Ben Affleck, who does not deserve the top billing or any special attention yet receives it, portrays the young sales manager who is fired. In a way, we see this mostly through his eyes as he descends the levels of the Hell of Job Loss.Tommy Lee Jones and Craig T. Nelson portray the corporate bigwigs of GTX, though Nelson is the soulless owner while Jones is just his 'partner' going back to the company's beginnings. Jones worries like an old lady about the employees being fired while Nelson laughs. Soon Jones is fired, along with Chris Cooper, who symbolizes the too-old-to-hire, out-of-work corporate 'wise man'. It is only Cooper's character who meets his appointment with death by his own hand, and I can't say I liked that but I knew someone had to commit suicide in this.In a way, this film treats with a world I know not. It is not familiar to me, nor is it understandable. I know such men as ""corporate monsters"" or the less offensive ""bigwigs"", ""stiff suits"" and my own term ""executroids"". Tommy Lee Jones' character admits who he is: ""Hell I like $500 lunches and $5,000 hotel suites!"", and this after he's been fired and is a bit hopeless.Guess that is the real 'enterprising spirit'. That is the world I will never, ever understand. My father always always said, ""We're all the same, and everyone's just trying to make a living."" So I tried to look at it like that - and I have my father to thank for my being able to appreciate this film in full. Before thinking of Pop's wise observation, all I could see was the leering, nasty faces of Craig T. Nelson on one side and Ben Affleck on the other.There is lots to see and hear in this film. While I felt a kind of sad disgust with it at first, I warmed to its importance. This film speaks loudly to anyone, everyone, who has ever struggled on the way up, lost a job or is floundering in a jobless economy. A special appearance by Kevin Costner as Affleck's brother-in-law symbolizes hard-working labor. As owner of a mid-level construction company, he takes pity on Affleck and hires him. What I really liked here is Costner's job is to build modest homes.The shots are crabbed and claustrophobic yet lovely and meaningful: the multi-million dollar houses representing the mortgage crisis ('McMansions'), with FOR-SALE signs in the front yards. The shots of certain desolate parts of Gloucester, including the dead, boatless harbor. This has meaning since Jones' character began as a shipwright as did Cooper.In fact the character with the least meaning (for me, anyhow) is Affleck; he represents the resentful, young hard worker who fought his way out of a working-class neighborhood he despised, and really believed he was better than everyone else. Sad.As my father might have asked, who is responsible for what? Who cheated the worker out of his work, who slammed all the doors then laughed all the way to the bank? I say Affleck more than Nelson represents that evil glibness, that corporate zombie mentality, that has cost this nation everything. In fact, Nelson seems to be Affleck-in-the-future, only Affleck learns his lessons at the construction site where he works for his brother-in-law.In other words, he has his glibness torn from him savagely. I kept saying, ""Good."" There was no way I would ever feel sorry for Affleck's character.Get this and watch it at least twice. Aside from possibly catching all the stupidly mumbled dialogue which you'll surely miss on the 1st viewing, you'll catch a great deal more. Aside from Affleck's unending lack of acting talent, you will discover that every line spoken here is a lesson. This film - without the ""f-bombs"" and the ""mo-fo bombs"" which can be edited out in a cinch - should be shown in schools.Craig T. Nelson to a fired Tommy Lee Jones: ""My shares are worth $600 million. How much are yours worth?""And I thought, THAT is a profound and challenging question to America. Watch this great film (in spite of Affleck, whom I always jokingly call ""Ben Affect"" as in ""lack of affect""). Find out just what Jones' ""shares"" are worth.

I'm a dinosaur.  Luckily, I'm very good at what I do.""  A decade later, he plays a thirty something who gets fired from his high powered salesman job and faces a bleak economy, along with colleagues Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper.  Downsizing these days means moving in with your parents, having to dye your hair and quit smoking, and - the ultimate indignity, having your spouse start working more hours in order to make ends meet.  Luckily, for Affleck, he gets a job doing manual labor with his brother-in-law, played by Kevin Costner, who passes along a few Life Lessons, along with instructions on how to put up drywall.  Other movie characters aren't as fortunate.In eighties' cinema, greed was good, or at least acceptable.  In the nineties, there were a spate of movies about yuppies getting blindsided by trauma and having to reevaluate their priorities.  In ""Regarding Henry,"" Harrison Ford plays a lawyer who becomes a better person by getting shot in the head and suffering brain damage.  He realizes that his colleagues are amoral sleazebags and takes his daughter out of boarding school.  It may have been good that Henry's daughter didn't want to attend in the first place because with Henry's newfound ethics, he probably wouldn't have a job much longer.  But the film didn't explore that.Nowadays, even movie characters can't afford spontaneous job quitting.  This is a grim movie, with few answers to the current economic crisis.

1364432,A2EZTM9WY5B5IL,B003UESJEM,Frank J. DeFelice,"[1, 2]","Those of you who have been terminated will relate to this film. First, the acting is very good. Ben Affleck plays a laid off MBA-type executive who has to face the reality of being terminated. He thinks he'll get another job in a few days but spends months going to interviews, and getting rejected. This film resembles real life -- getting terminated and having to leave immediately. Usually a guard escorts you out. In this film,  jobs are not out sourced; the company is downsized so it will appear more profitable than it is. This makes it a good takeover target. (Outplacement helps you re-write your resume and teaches you how to present yourself to a prospective employee. Most valuable is, they teach you how to do a 2-minute drill: ""tell me about yourself"". Most executives are sent to outplacement services.) The scenes in outplacement are true to life, where they tell you to put only the last ten years on your resume, how to have a positive attitude, let everyone know you're looking for a job.  This is painful, because you don't want your friends to know you've been terminated. The writer/director is making a statement about jobs lost that are not coming back. Steel mills have been shuttered, shipbuilding gone overseas. It's a film about transitions, most of them painful. Ben's wife, an RN, sticks with him, props him up during difficult times, when Ben felt worthless.  Kevin Costner does a terrific job as a building contractor, who hires Affleck as a carpenter. The film makes this point: in business, friendships come second. If you have to terminate a close friend, then do it. (Dreadful, but true.)

1364435,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003UESJEM,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","THE COMPANY MEN is very difficult to watch if you are among the millions of people who have been laid off by the current economic recession/meltdown in this country. Writer/Director John Wells understands the grave aspects of losing a job as corporations and businesses downsize in response to the current economic disaster - depression, humiliation, loss of self-worth and pride, fear of failure in finding new employment, the effects of job loss on marriages and families, loss of hope - it is all here in this very well made film. If the first part of the film causes a reactive tachycardia and an urge to simply stop watching the story, then the closing moments of the film bring at least a little redemption in the faith that man can actually survive and reassess and stop being a victim of a situation over which few of us have any control.GTX is a shipbuilding empire in Boston, the brainchild of Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) who brought a simple ship building business to a wealthy corporation now run by CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson): McClary is a billionaire with a wife  concerned with shopping sprees using the corporate jet and a lover Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello), the HR director of the corporation. The year is 2008 and the stock market and the economy in general have dipped to a new low and terrifying point. The result: downsizing and one of the first to go is sales manager Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) who is shocked and then hurt and then overcome with a feeling of failure and humiliation.  Bobby's wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) at first responds with desperation but adjusts by taking on work as an ER nurse, coaxing their son to not lose hope in Bobby.  Bobby tries to find work but is the victim of the joblessness of the country: he finally accepts Maggie's brother Jack's (Kevin Costner) offer to to work as a simple carpenter.  Meanwhile the downsizing includes Gene and longterm employee Phil (Chris Cooper) who is overcome with anger and humiliation at being unemployable because of his advanced age.  The manner in which each of these three men cope with the loss of job and income weaves a story that is complete with tragedy as well as  a demonstration of the indomitability of the human spirit.THE COMPANY MEN  contains many messages about coping with change, preparing for a realistic financial future, and the delicate line that separates each day's stance on the tightrope of existence.  While the story is difficult to watch, the performances by this exceptional cast are excellent, not only among the Oscar winning stars but by the finely wrought cameos by Anthony O'Leary as Bobby's son Drew, Cady Huffman, and Eamonn Walker (so well remembered from the TV series OZ), among many others.This is tough medicine but necessary views on contemporary society.

Ben Affleck's character can't make payments on his porsche or pay his golf club fees. Crisis! Chris Cooper's character might not be able to pay his daughter's tuition at Brown. He commits suicide!

Affleck's only problem is his pride as a job is waiting right there for him. Do you know how many people in my own town would kill for that job? How many in my father's town? These men don't consider selling off their homes or cars as they are so married to their symbols of wealth and power that the one man who loses everything does it to run away with his mistress who was only into him for his status symbols.

Without really getting to know Ben Affleck's character, Bobby Walker, we see him go to work and get fired within about the first ten minutes of the movie. He then spends some time bitterly adjusting to unemployment as his funds dry up, he sells his house, has to move in with his parents and finally ends up working construction with his brother-in-law, played by Kevin Costner with a so-so Boston area accent.Chris Cooper's director level character also loses his job. Issues of ageism arise as one employment coach tells him to color his hair and remove anything over twenty years old from his resume. Ultimately, he copes with his challenge by turning to the bottle and worse.Tommy Lee Jones VP level character is perhaps the most complex, an idealist who helped found the company with a friend played by Craig T. Nelson (in full coldly brutal ""I'm just trying to save the company"" mode) who sees his entire department decimated by the down-sizing movement. Rather than deal with his wife, who we get the impression will have a hard time adjusting to a reduced spending lifestyle, he simply moves in with his mistress, the corporate lawyer played by Maria Bello.The story attempts to be relevant but I imagine that many people will have a difficult time feeling sorry for these guys when they represent, if not the upper 1% then perhaps at least the upper 5-10%. Others may well be able to place themselves in this position. The last three years have been tough in different areas of the country and for various industries.Ultimately, Jones' character makes a move to reinvent himself and provides Affleck's Bobby another chance as well.

That is what makes it a bit depressing for some - a colleague of mine in his 50's told me that's what the movie did for him, since he'd lost his previous job unexpectedly a few years back.  But yet the ultimate message is one of endurance.  Both of individuals and of the American Spirit.  The greatest lessons we can learn from ourselves and each other is when times are the worst and how we respond to them as individuals and as a community.

It is a definite must-see movie.  The cast was excellent--Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee-Jones, Ben Affleck, etc. You can't get much better than that--kind of made me wonder what the cost of making this movie was.  But more than that, it deals with an issue that is so germane to our lives and important. Something that each and every one of us thinks about if not in the front of our minds then definitely in the back of our minds---what were to happen if we were to get laid off.  I thought the movie dealt with it in both a very realistic and sensitive manner. It showed the reality of people who couldn't pay their bills and others who were less immune to that reality? It showed the need to always be thinking about how importnat it is to save for a rainy day and to manage your expenses wisely.  And it also showed the ties that bind family during difficult times.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","With the recent state of the economy, many people have been devastated from the change of circumstances while almost everyone has felt the affects. It's a painful and difficult situation--one not inherently lending itself to the classification of entertainment. But movies can be essential in illustrating the important moments of the real world within a social context. ""The Company Men"" takes on the financial crisis head on--and while its goals are admirable, whether or not individual viewers will connect with the film's protagonists is largely going to be determined on a case by case basis. Certainly, people of status and means were negatively and irreperably affected by lay-offs and closings--and ""The Company Men"" highlights the trials and tribulations of three such wealthy men. Their problems may not seem as insurmountable and dire, however, to the millions of people who lack all their material advantages and still face the same economic dilemma. So while there are many, many reasons to recommend this movie--I still think some will be unable to sympathize with this particular pack of characters.Set amidst a struggling transportation division, the film centers around Ben Affleck as a hotshot sales executive who becomes a victim of corporate downsizing. Affleck, filled with bravado and entitlement, is refreshingly hard edged while his plight is paralleled to the struggles of two more senior executives played by Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones. As concurrent waves of lay-offs affect them all in very intimate ways, each is left to reevaluate their role in the world when everything they've known is taken away. Of course, they are hardly left on the street--what with the trappings of investments and wealth that they might have accumulated through the years but the film treats Affleck, especially, as a hard luck case. Before you can say ""let's cash in some stock options or our 401K,"" Affleck moves from super wealthy to absolutely destitute. Yes, after 12 years at 160K, his family is immediately broke after three months when his final check arrives (he's even got a 3 month full pay compensation package!). I mean selling his kid's X-box and moving in with his parents broke--not just moving into more affordable accomodations.It is in these moments that lack subtlety that the film falters. But it's trying to make a point, and what better way than to have Affleck work construction with his salt-of-the-earth brother in law (Kevin Costner). Getting his hands dirty, befriending others in similar circumstances, and reconnecting with family--he is really starting to see the errors of his ways. The wish fulfillment ending further distances this film from the real life struggles that millions of people are dealing with on a daily basis. So fanciful and perfect--if only! Through it all, though, the film features bright and lively performances from its stars. Aside from the bigger names, Rosemarie Dewitt serves up a nice and needed dose of relatability as Affleck's wife. I appreciated the story that this film attempts to tell and think, for the most part, that it is successful. Despite some plot shortcuts, it is a smart film that attempts to dramatize a real life tragedy. But it is a bit removed from the man on the street (most workers don't spend half a day playing golf on the company dime). My guess is that viewers will either wholeheartedly embrace ""The Company Men"" or be somewhat alienated by its limited character perspective. I liked it overall, but it's not without movie moments that serve to undermine the human drama.

1364454,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B003UESJEM,"L P ""lilip""","[1, 2]","This film makes a significant statement about corporate morals or lack thereof and how corporations view as acceptable the devaluing and discarding of the men and women whose life's blood made them what they are while only caring about the bottom line and shareholder interests. It begs the question of whether it is enough to merely compensate such people with mere wages and benefits, or is respect and honor, and thus the acknowledgement that their wisdom and experience make them INDISPENSABLE to a company's continued future, due as well.It also quite expertedly showcases the immense greed that takes place in all of these places where on the one hand the executives who sit in their cushy  400 square feet corner offices with ceiling to floor windows and mahogany desks talk about cutting down and casually and without compunction lay off thousands of people while at the same time somehow having found the funds to buy a brand new building whose entire floor they retrofit to house three hot shot executes each pulling 15 million a year in cash plus about half of that in stocks and securities. They lay off hard working, middle class mind you, folks who have put in decades and endless hours into their jobs and who have mortgages to pay, kids to send to college and lives to live while in the same breath planning their exclusive winter getaway in some luxury resort with $500 dinners and $5000 a night suites. And these very men have gotten this rich not by actually producing something, or building something tangible, but by pushing figures on a sheet.Too many of America's companies have gotten quite cozy with this callous arrangement whereby actual people and their lives have stopped mattering, while greed and the bottom line have fully taken over. One example in this movie is the CEO who fires his best friend (Jones) who helped him build the company from the ground, without a trace of irony and compunction and even a smile on his face because hey, &#34;business is business&#34; and apparently nothing else matters. Friendship, loyalty, devotion and honor are secondary when it comes to amassing wealth.Companies today seldom strive for a higher standard of value that extends beyond the dollar and this movie does a great job at showing that.That said, if you are into movies where for some of the characters the idea of being poor is that they are no longer multi millionaires but just regular millionaires or whose idea of being broke is that the wife cannot take the company jet to go traveling or that you may have to do the unspeakable, which is rent a townhome instead of living in an estate with 12 gardeners, then this is the movie for you. Have at it. Try feeling bad for people who went from 180k a year to half that. Try feeling bad for people who own 10 million dollar mansions, who wont be eating filet mignon and lobster every night anymore cause they got canned;  try feeling bad for people who commit suicide because they can't send their kid to a senior trip to Italy or whose monthly mortgage is just as high as one year's tuition at Brown. Try feeling really sorry for people who no longer get to start their work days at 11 because they just spent the last 3 hours on the golf course;  feel heartbroken that some rich puke had to sell his overpriced sportscar or could, god forbid, not buy his kid a 400 dollar xbox.I personally found it hard to feel entirely too sorry for them because real struggle post recession for many was facing card board boxes as an alternative to a home, bankruptcy, loss of their entire life savings and retirements, not to mention chronic unemployment with sustenance level unemployment insurance (which ran out),  the inability to feed their children and themselves and generally having to navigate a tedious existence stuck in trenches of destitution without any real prospects in sight, thanks to a host of middle class busting policies by both of our parties and a practically non existent soclal safety net.It is amazing how the architects of the Ownership Society and Hard Work  - people who carelessly assert that those who don't have everything they need just aren't trying hard enough or are lazy mooches and and who tell those very same people to &#34;live within their means&#34; -  themselves fall into a deep emotional and existential crisis when they are tasked with the unspeakable act of having to navigate life not as a semi millionaire, but as an ordinary person, and thus like hundreds of millions of others, who rent instead of owning and who drive one car instead of housing six in a garage the size family townhome. These people expect poor people to not complain about being poor and low wages, no benefits and exploitative employers, but they themselves arent even willing to LIVE even for one second with non-wealthy and, in fact, commit suicide when all the luxuries, emphasis on luxuries,  are taken away from them.Objectively, none of the people in this movie, even after they lost their jobs, was in such a bad shape and, in fact, they were better off than most Americans today. it's just that they no longer could spend $600 a month on dry cleaners or thousands of dollars on the country club membership.As mentioned above, one of the characters commits suicide because he cannot pay for his kid's tuition and his mortage at the same time and i am sitting there thinking: really? You are willing to throw your life away because your head is so high up in the clouds that you cant even CONCEIVE to oh, i dont know, maybe get a student loan for your kid and rent? You'd rather be dead than take out a student loan and rent the roof above your head? Laughable.Watching members of the 1% hit hard times - which really just means not living in obscene wealth they mostly cheated others out of (hence the economic meltdown), is not interesting and it does not evoke my sympathy. Yes it really is bothersome to go from a almost 200k salary to a 90k one, but not as troublesome as going from a 50k salary to 0 without a job in sight and unemployment running out. Halfway through the movie i realized that these people dont know what real struggle is. What it means to only have 5 dollars left in your checking until payday.

KEVIN COSTNER: it was good to see you, Kevin...and you were right on Kevin, which I don't think all the time; I'm not a fan; but in this movie you were masculine, real and even sexy.  So, stay in front of the camera Kevin if you're going to do this kind of real work.SOME YEARS BACK...maybe in the 70s, last century, the Japanese developed a company-employee model and made Toyota a household name.  The Japanese model basically said: (a) If people love working for you they will love coming to work for you, and (b) if the employees are brought in as a part of your company they will care about the company; they will have lifelong customers and generational repetitive customers and you will have less enemies of the company and your company will be cared about and become a part of the national landscape.  That was then, back in the day when SEARS seemed like home and a member of everybody's family.TODAY THE CORPORATE CULTURE IS DIFFERENT and American business is suffering.  Today's model is: Work For Us and we could downsize you next week or in 35 years, two years before your retirement and you'll be lucky if some 40-year-old grads from Ivy League U.S.A. hasn't bet the entire retirement fund money on an offshore oil well.

1364459,A129YBX5BVNW2,B003UESJEM,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[2, 3]","Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) knots his silk tie, jumps into his silver Porsche Convertible, speeds out of the leafy drive of his seven-figure suburban mansion and heads off into his job as Regional Sales Manager for GTX - an $11 billion dollar ship-building  conglomerate based in the plusher part of Boston who employ over 60,000 people nationwide...In a less conspicuously wealthy  part of town Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) - a man whose been to Vietnam and then worked himself up from a 60-hour week doing dangerous riveting on the propeller shafts of oil-tankers to a distinguished 30-year managerial career - fixes his dapper cufflinks - albeit a little more wearily.Out by the waterfront in a palatial monolith too gross for mere adjectives, the Executive Vice President of Global Transportation Services (GTX) Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) looks down at a machine that polishes his leather shoes to a mirror-like shine. All three then look into their home mirrors with the faintest whiff of insufferable smugness.Little do any of them know that Black Friday is about to bring a particularly cruel and detached word into their vocabulary - 'downsizing'...""The Company Men"" deals with the American bank collapses of September 2008 and their devastating knock-on effect on US heavy-manufacturing industries and their already constricting workforces. As you can see from the principal actors outlined above - the cast is to die-for - and John Well's Script and Direction gives them real substance to work with. Another weapon in the movie's favor is the cinematography of the legendary ROGER DEAKINS (""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""True Grit""). Not only is the Blu Ray image immaculate throughout (he can make a car driving down a snowy road look like poetry) - the pristine sheen of home interiors and top floor offices strewn with Degas Paintings and iMacs is both beautiful and menacing - because beneath all that money, veneer and polish is a very real unspoken threat - poverty is only a corporate axe-swing away.The story begins by putting all three 'company men' in the firing-line - forcing each to reassess themselves and the promises of people they once thought they could trust. Tommy Lee Jones - an actor with as much gravitas as the Lincoln Memorial - does a stunning job of portraying Gene McClary. You can literally 'feel' his treacle-like slide into the abyss. His lifelong friendship with his boss Jim Salinger (a typically excellent Craig T. Nelson) is poisoned beyond repair as corporate greed callously axes 5000 jobs to meet shareholder's needs - and keep the big boys and their moneyed lifestyle intact (Bobby Walker is the first of these casualties). As the monetary noose tightens - another 5000 job cuts are called for and the blade comes closer to home. In a brilliantly written scene where they're deciding who goes and who stays - a lawyer tells Gene ""...We're breaking no laws here..."" to which Gene replies ""...I guess I always assumed we were trying for a higher standard than that..."" And is doesn't help either that Gene is sleeping with Sarah Wilcox (Maria Bello) - an upper-coming executive who does all the firing in a sexy dress with a concerned look...Chris Cooper too brings the film some badly-needed heart with a brilliant and unnerving portrayal of a man of a certain age losing his job - and by extension what defines him. In a particularly brutal scene - a tough female Career's Officer (Cady Huffman) tells Phil how it really is (her dialogue titles this review) and she doesn't mince her words ""You're pushing sixty and you look like Hell..."" She outlines what has to be axed and what has to be massaged in his old fart's resume. Sat there in a suit that no longer feels right and with his body crouched forward in an already defeated way, Cooper's look of puppy-dog bewilderment combined with a barely contained rage is so good that it's palpable. His disintegration later is both sad and painfully believable. He's a great actor and such an asset to this movie...But the whole thing pivots on Ben Affleck's character Bobby Walker and the arc of his painful journey. He starts out as an insufferable motormouth earning $120,000 a year plus incentives with a golf-club membership and eating-out expenses of $600 a month. His wife and two kids want for nothing and have every electrical gadget that screams 'we've arrived'. And when he joins the Jobseeker's club he cockily tells Danny (a huge presence in Eamonn Walker) that he'll have a job in a few days - he completely believes it. Three months later - with his car and possessions gone - their home foreclosed on - 100% of his phonecalls not returned and his severance pay running out - he's beginning to look and sound like a 37-year old loser who can't support his family. Luckily his wife Maggie (a superlative Rosemary DeWitt) keeps him and their world from falling apart with a practicality that her husband so clearly lacks (they rediscover each other in the process).Affleck is often accused of being too pretty boy and too lightweight to be taken seriously, but with his two excellent directorial works ""Gone Baby Gone"" (see review) and ""The Town"" and past performances in ""Hollywoodland"" and ""State Of Play"" - once again he shows here that he can easily stand up with the big boys. There's a scene in Jack's house (a wonderfully held-back performance by Kevin Costner - a working man who is incensed at the mere presence of this upstart he clearly feels deserves his comeuppance) when Bobby is looking around the room at the dinner table. He sighs - he's anticipating lectures about responsibility and prayers for hope - his eyelids weigh about 2000 tons. The slide of despair has begun - but there's still that arrogance there. It's a spot-on performance by Affleck for his character at that particular moment. By the time his Bobby gets to huffing sheets of timber about on a construction site for his hated brother-in-law - his dirty-faced blister-handed appreciation of having 'any' job is real and complete. It's impressive stuff...Niggles - despite the A-list cast, the beautiful presentation of the print, the often exceptional writing and the slick direction, there's a gnawing feeling that you're being asked to care about smug pricks with too much money - people you want to hit over the head repeatedly with a cricket bat. And worse - the movie slyly concentrates too much on the 'young' jobless type and not the men of 40, 50 and 60 who can be all but destroyed by such a loss. But luckily the script is smarter than all that and despite a rather pat happy-ending - the sheer quality of the cast and the material win out.""The Company Men"" probably isn't going to trouble any Oscar Nominations List or fire up critics into spilling out orgasmic soliloquies - but like a good night in with friends where way too many drinks have been taken - what was said in liquered-up truth the night before stays with you for days afterwards. Mostly it'll make you think about 'work' - how it traps/frees us - how it even gives us life itself. And if ""The Company Men"" makes us appreciate what we have and value it - then it's a job well done...A good movie really. Put it high on your rental list.",4,"""...You're Gonna Have A Rough Time Out There...""",1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,7230,"['Bobby', 'Walker', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'knots', 'silk', 'tie', 'silver',

1364460,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003UESJEM,Mark Turner,"[3, 3]","There are movies that are made that are noted as being timely. These movies take on the day to day stories that many of those viewing them are going through and turn them into stories with compelling characters, events that viewers can relate to and that touch the heart all at the same time. THE COMPANY MEN is just such a movie.Ben Affleck is Bobby Walker, a sales director for a global transportation company, GTX. He walks into a meeting one morning after a great golf game only to discover that not only has part of his staff been let go but his position is no longer in existence as well. The company, in an attempt to show itself as more profitable, has let go a number of people as well as two departments.Given severance pay and the assistance of a job placement service, Bobby hopes to find a new job within days. The reality of the matter is that this is not the only company going through downsizing and he is not the only person with the same qualifications. While his wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt in a fantastic performance) supports him in his search, she has a more realistic viewpoint. As Bobby continues to search for that elusive dream job, Maggie is the one that makes the tough decisions and keeps the family together.But that's only one story going here. Another involves Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), a long time employee in his fifties who began with the company on the manufacturing end when they built cargo ships. Phil starts fearful that he will be let go next. With a daughter in college and a luxury home to care for, Phil's fears begin running his life.The third story, thus making it company ""men"", revolves around Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), another long time employee and Bobby's supervisor. It's Gene's departments that have been eliminated and he feels for the workers under him. Having started the company with long time friend James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), Gene thinks the company should be more than just figures. It should have an ethical responsibility to its employees as well. Needless to say the company disagrees.The movie weaves back and forth with these three businessmen, showing that it's not just those on a factory floor that are damaged when a company changes its focus. As with most things the trickle down effect touches all, starting at the top. It doesn't just affect the company itself or the lives of those it employs but the lives of their families as well.The paths that these three characters take from the start of the film to its conclusion touch the viewer on an emotional level more so than most films I've seen of late. You worry about each of them but not the same way. Each one touches you on a different level and the story telling done here is remarkable in the way that it moves you. Be it the young man early in his career or the elderly statesman past retirement age, you feel a concern for each and watch wondering just what they will do next.All of the actors here do a remarkable job. You feel the pain of Affleck, a man who feels he's become a loser in every respect of the word as he finds difficulty taking care of his family. Cooper's despair as he does all he can to hold onto his job can bring tears to your eyes. And Jones' depiction of a man who thought his company would be different than the rest only to find himself on the outside of the decision making process is one that offers a resilience to all that happens to these three. Kevin Costner as a hard working construction owner and Affleck's brother in law who sees the worth of work in a hands on basis only does a great job as well whether he's needling Bobby for not being a working man or giving him a job to help him get by. But the stand out performance to me was DeWitt. You truly believe her character and sympathize with her being there to handle the bills and to help her husband find his way.This movie does not set out to be a feel good movie and yet by the end it becomes just that. Not in a neat and tidy here's a big rescue sort of way but in the idea that just when things look their worst a glimmer of hope might just happen. It shows a world in which company men, often portrayed as unfeeling money grubbing millionaires, can also be touched by the necessities of the business world.

1364462,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B003UESJEM,M. Hill,"[1, 2]","The Company Men is a solid character study reflecting our current work world. What matters most is money. It is a depressing subject and the film accurately portrays the shock, sadness, denial, desperation, humiliation and eventual adaptation, in one form or another, of the victims of a downsizing. It also examines the arrogance and often, indifference of those making and executing the decisions. This is made all the harder to watch by the excellent performances of the entire cast.No matter the industry, this is a situation many people are experiencing at their work place. Being thirty with a record of success doesn't guarantee a new position exists for you. Whether financially able to retire, or not, if laid-off at fifty, with years of loyalty and accomplishment, there may be no jobs in the future. Even those that were there at the inception of a company, people who fostered its growth and are largely responsible for its success, may find themselves out of work if they voice opinions contrary to the CEO.The story is about big money and greed, and the fact that often the actual staff of a company is considered a disposable part of the equation. It's just business. Their jobs will be cut, long before the upper echelon feels any financial pain, and the decisions that affect their lives so profoundly, are sometimes made because someone at the top wants to construct a building with a better view. The counterbalance is provided by the small businessman who quietly takes on unprofitable projects so he can keep his crew working through the winter. He silently worries about their needs, and his responsibility to them. These are the people who don't make headlines.This isn't a perfect film. In places it is predictable, and the urge to tack on a too happy ending should have been suppressed, but the excellent cast helps to overcome the shortcomings. The obvious problem for the movie's future success rests with finding a large enough audience willing to pay to see the film. The reality portrayed is something people are living with every day at work, and it is often difficult to leave the troubles at the office. So, although The Company Men is a worthy project, the challenge will be finding people living this reality, willing to watch it in their free time.",4,The Company Men,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,2284,"['Company', 'Men', 'solid', 'character', 'study', 'reflecting', 'current', 'work', 'world', 'What', 'most', 'money', 'depressing', 'subject', 'film', 'accurately', 'shock', 'sadness', 'denial', 'desperation', 'humiliation', 'eventual', 'adaptation', 'one', 'form', 'victims', 'downsizing', 'also', 'arrogance', 'often', 'indifference', 'making', 'executing', 'decisions', 'made', 'harder', 'watch', 'excellent', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast.No', 'matter', 'industry', 'situation', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'experiencing', 'work', 'place', 'Being', 'thirty', 'record', 'success', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'new', 'position', 'exists', 'financially', 'able', 'retire', 'not', 'laid-off', 'fifty', 'years', 'loyalty', 'accomplishment', 'may', 'be', 'jobs', 'future', 'Even', 'were', 'there', 'inception', 'company', 'people', 'who', 'fostered', 'growth', 'are', 'largely', 'responsible', 'success', 'may', 'find', 'work', 'voice', 'opinions', 'contrary', 'CEO.The', 'story', 'big', 'money', 'greed', 'fact', 'often', 'actual', 'staff', 'company', 'considered', 'disposable', 'part', 'equation', 'just', 'business', 'jobs', 'will', 'be', 'cut', 'long', 'upper', 'echelon', 'feels', 'financial', 'pain', 'decisions', 'affect', 'lives', 'so', 'profoundly', 'are', 'sometimes', 'made', 'someone', 'top', 'construct', 'building', 'better', 'view', 'counterbalance', 'provided', 'small', 'businessman', 'who', 'quietly', 'unprofitable', 'projects', 'can', 'keep', 'crew', 'working', 'winter', 'silently', 'needs', 'responsibility', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'headlines.This', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'places', 'predictable', 'urge', 'tack', 'too', 'happy', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'suppressed', 'excellent', 'cast', 'overcome', 'shortcomings', 'obvious', 'problem', 'movie', 'future', 'success', 'rests', 'finding', 'large', 'enough', 'audience', 'willing', 'pay', 'see', 'film', 'reality', 'portrayed', 'something', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'day', 'work', 'often', 'difficult', 'leave', 'troubles', 'office', 'So', 'Company', 'Men', 'worthy', 'project', 'challenge', 'will', 'be', 'finding', 'people', 'living', 'reality', 'willing', 'watch', 'free', 'time']",N/A

THE COMPANY MEN (2010) is such a film.Exquisitely written and directed by John Wells, THE COMPANY MEN is a sad chronicle of our times.  It yearns for an earlier period, not that long ago, when Americans made ""things"" that they could point to and be proud of (e.g. cars, ships), rather than just ""make money"".The story deals with America's economic downturn and the devastating effect it has on three men, all highly successful and in upper management or executive positions, who are the victims of corporate downsizing.  Once they finally comprehend the realities of their dire circumstances, each of these men deal with their individual situations in completely different, even tragic, ways.The cast of this film is superb, not a false note among them.  They include Ben Affleck, Chris Cooper, Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Maria Bello, Rosemarie Dewitt and Craig. T. Nelson.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment has a number of extras, including audio commentary by Wells, a ""Making of"" featurette, several deleted scenes and an ""Alternate Ending,"" which, frankly, I think works better than the one used in the final film.THE COMPANY MEN may deal with a painful subject, but it is an excellent movie.

1364464,A3A15L96IYUO6V,B003UESJEM,Michael Smith,"[0, 0]","It's pretty obvious in the first 20 minutes of the film (as well as by reading the back cover of the DVD) that a bunch of well to do folks are going to lose their jobs, and they're going to have trouble finding new ones. While the film does expand on a few more themes (the standard husband/wife/kids relationship, parents, blue vs. white collar, etc.), unfortunately, there's really nothing overly unique about the film. The main character, Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is this family man -- while we see shadows and the toils of tribulations of other higher level corporate types (Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones.) At this point, you realize you're pretty much seeing microcosm of the 2010 financial crisis in the United States -- and that corporations are out to increases profits as much as possible, perhaps without the regard of the status of (formerly) successful employees. If you've been reading the news headlines of the past few years, the plot is quite predictable.The middle of the film stagnates a bit -- we quickly know that Bobby is not going to find another similar position in the corporate world, but does find another opportunity in a vastly different industry. While embracing this new lifestyle, Bobby re-evaluates the world around him and finally takes stock in the change around him. Some of the other characters have a much harder time doing so, and there are significant consequences for them and their families -- reaching the denouement of the film. Craig T. Nelson's character, as the main antagonist, plays a good corporate president and shows little remorse towards those let go.The ending is formulaic yet provides limited closure. Nonetheless, at the time I write this review the 2010 economic crisis still isn't resolved and hangs in the balance, much like this movie's conclusion. I've seen worse dramas and I've seen better -- the acting and casting is above average, it's just the story line that needs work, even though I didn't expect a happy ending.",3,Predictable plot but good acting,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,1988,"['pretty', 'obvious', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'reading', 'back', 'cover', 'DVD', 'bunch', 'well', 'do', 'folks', 'are', 'going', 'lose', 'jobs', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'new', 'ones', 'film', 'expand', 'few', 'more', 'themes', 'standard', 'husband/wife/kids', 'relationship', 'parents', 'blue', 'vs.', 'white', 'collar', 'etc', 'unfortunately', 'really', 'nothing', 'overly', 'unique', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Bobby', 'Walker', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'family', 'man', 'see', 'shadows', 'toils', 'tribulations', 'other', 'higher', 'level', 'corporate', 'types', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'point', 'realize', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'seeing', 'microcosm', '2010', 'financial', 'crisis', 'United', 'States', 'corporations', 'are', 'increases', 'profits', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'perhaps', 'regard', 'status', 'formerly', 'successful', 'employees', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'news', 'headlines', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'plot', 'quite', 'predictable.The', 'middle', 'film', 'bit', 'quickly', 'know', 'Bobby', 'not', 'going', 'find', 'similar', 'position', 'corporate', 'world', 'find', 'opportunity', 'vastly', 'different', 'industry', 'embracing', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'Bobby', 'world', 'finally', 'stock', 'change', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'much', 'harder', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'significant', 'consequences', 'families', 'reaching', 'denouement', 'film', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'character', 'main', 'antagonist', 'good', 'corporate', 'president', 'little', 'remorse', 'towards', 'let', 'go.The', 'ending', 'formulaic', 'yet', 'limited', 'closure', 'Nonetheless', 'time', 'write', 'review', '2010', 'economic', 'crisis', 'still', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'hangs', 'balance', 'much', 'movie', 'conclusion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'acting', 'casting', 'above', 'average', 'just', 'story', 'line', 'work', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happy', 'ending']",N/A

It may be impossible for me to take a giant step backwards and access this film without emotion. The current mindless slavery of the corporate suits to the next quarter's bottom line and the wrath of the stock holders was presented in all its ugliness in this film;  A true mirror of today's sad state of life in the ivory tower.At first it was hard for me to feel any sympathy for the characters depicted in this film as those on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder often sense that justice is being served when the goons at the top end up taking the walk of shame.  The actors, though, nailed these rolls so dead-on you begin to relate to their lives even if it is Tommy Lee Jones's $500 lunches & $5,000 hotel suites.  How sad that in the slash & burn mentality we sometimes find the people with the most heart and sense of justice are the ones found most expendable.  Hum mm, Interesting....I found the mindless and insulting pep-talks by the corporate assigned transition teams both laughable and tragic at the same time.  Spouting corporate-speak jargon like ""Faith, Courage, and Enthusiasm"" to a room of recently laid-off depressed individuals couldn't be the career goal they dreamed of.  I've run into these people and they truly get caught up in their own shtick.  They think they are building the egos of the pathetic flock mandated to attend their workshops.  In reality they are actually creating a certain ""Esprit de corps"" but sadly, only in uniting the group to conjure unique methods of murdering them - a 9 to 5 Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;.All in all, this movie is a sad testament to our times.

1364467,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B003UESJEM,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 0]","The sobering tale about a group of company people at a big manufacturing firm who lose their jobs during the Great Recession. The focus is mostly on Ben Affleck's character who thinks he can find another job but soon finds himself struggling to secure a job at half his salary and failing that he finds he has to work for his brother-in-law fixing houses. Over time he loses his house and car and many other things but especially his dignity. In the meantime there are some subplots as an older higher up exec finds himself in trouble because he's pushing 60 and one of the owners finds himself torn between his broken duty to his ex employees and the fact that his stock has shot up. It's a tale about how a lot of us were let down by the Big Whigs and we're the ones mostly suffering for it. It's also about how we as a culture put a lot of our identity into our jobs and toys and find ourselves sinking into depression when we lose those things. It's also about the humiliating process for some who have to take whatever job they can find but on a brighter note it's about the American Spirit and how we spring back up when we're supported by our loved ones. The cast is overly impressive: Tommy Lee Jones, Chris Cooper, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner, Rosemarie DeWitt, Craig T. Nelson, Maria Bello and some other great supporting actors. It cost $15M to make but has yielded only a bit under $5M at the box office. Why did it yield so little if it's a great film? It had a limited exposure at theaters to begin with and it's a topic Americans don't want to encounter at the movies. That said, it's mirror of our times for many and it's also well done. Directed by John Wells in his feature film debut. I suspect a lot of the actors and actresses were moved by the script and offered to do it for far less. That says something about the picture even if it didn't yield bling bling at the box office.

Usually the movies castigate the people who make the decisions (for the stockholders of course), but the people affected are the workers or the people well down the company hierarchy.  The reality is that many of the white collar workers are equally affected.  This movie addresses 3 men who are fired including one of the company's founders (Tommy Lee Jones).  Ben Affleck is Bobby Walker a 37 year old, $120K a year sales manager who struggles to find work in today's economy.  The third man is a 60 year old head of a division who started in the factory.  He is played by the great Chris Cooper.  The movie isn't groundbreaking but does a good job with the twist noted above.

1364477,A1ADEVDXQLIUXB,B003UESJEM,"Patrick S. Dorazio ""Author of The Dark Trilogy""","[0, 0]","I had seen previews for ""The Company Men"" on the net last year and was interested in checking it out when it hit theaters, but apparently, I missed it entirely.  Seeing that the date on the box indicated that it was produced in 2009, my guess is that it had some difficulties getting released and ended up in limited release or went straight to DVD, which is a shame, because it was an entertaining movie once I got to see it.There are some very recognizable names in this cast, including a couple of academy award winners.  I felt that the emotions they portrayed were believable and the story made sense, especially since this film hit at the right time, with unemployment running rampant and the economy in the toilet.  Virtually everyone out there knows plenty of people who are unemployed or are (or have been) themselves, and can relate to what happens in this tale.  I was one of the unemployed when I saw the preview, so I was even more intrigued by the story than I might have otherwise been.  I wanted to see if what the characters went through would compare with what I was coping with and if the film offered any insights to give me hope that things would eventually get better.  I'm not sure I got that out of it, but it was still a film that had a sense of realism in a lot of ways that I could appreciate.Certainly, this isn't a story about the everyman who is just scraping by and gets laid off from his factory job.  Instead, it is a story about executives who are taken off their successful perches and brought down to reality that many of us have been facing over the past few years.Ben Affleck, the main character, is a Sales Executive who makes about $160k a year and spends like he makes twice that much, with a Porche in the driveway and a house that is probably worth close to a million in a good market.  Chris Cooper is one step above Ben on the job food chain at the same company, a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps, coming from the factory floor all the way up to a director level position within his company.  Despite having thirty years in, he too finds himself out the door with the latest cuts and is having even a harder time coming to grips with this new jobless existence than Ben.  The fact that no one seems to notice that his life ""is over"" as he puts it, is the worst part of it.  His wife makes him stay out of the house until six at night so none of their neighbors realize he is unemployed and he is still trying to figure out how to pay for his daughter's senior trip to Italy even though if he pays for that, he won't be able to make the mortgage.  Tommy Lee Jones is a VP in the same company and the boss of Ben and Chris's characters.  As one of the founders of the company, he is only person who can tell the CEO, played by Craig T. Nelson, that he is wrong for cutting all the jobs just to appease the stock holders, until he too is cut.  His post job loss struggles are not of a financial sort, but more related to the revelation that he had lost his way as a ""creator"" of tangible things, like the ships his company used to build-something that he and the people who worked for him could point at and be proud of.As I mentioned, I was unemployed when I saw the preview for this movie and am now thankfully employed again.  Despite the fact that the people in this film were executives who make more than the vast majority of people out there, their story still resonates because of the realization that we aren't all that different when it comes to losing a job.  Denial, anger, rejection, the sense of abject failure, and pondering your true worth in the world and to your family all play a role in the process.  Accepting that you are not too good to accept any job as long as it pays and supports the people you love is also something that came to light in this film that I appreciated as real and genuine.Overall, this isn't a ""fun"" film, and is probably not for everyone.  I think it does show how hard a place the world is and how ruthless it can be, but that there can be hope, but you have to be willing to fight for it, and while you feel like giving up, you have to keep fighting no matter what, and appreciate what you do have, even if all seems lost.",4,"Solid performances, believable story",1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,4223,"['had', 'seen', 'previews', 'Company', 'Men', 'net', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', 'when', 'hit', 'theaters', 'apparently', 'missed', 'entirely', 'Seeing', 'date', 'box', 'indicated', 'was', 'produced', '2009', 'guess', 'had', 'difficulties', 'getting', 'released', 'ended', 'up', 'limited', 'release', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'shame', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'once', 'got', 'see', 'are', 'very', 'recognizable', 'names', 'cast', 'including', 'couple', 'academy', 'award', 'winners', 'felt', 'emotions', 'portrayed', 'were', 'believable', 'story', 'made', 'sense', 'especially', 'film', 'hit', 'right', 'time', 'unemployment', 'running', 'rampant', 'economy', 'toilet', 'Virtually', 'everyone', 'there', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unemployed', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'tale', 'was', 'one', 'unemployed', 'when', 'saw', 'preview', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'intrigued', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'went', 'would', 'compare', 'what', 'was', 'coping', 'film', 'offered', 'insights', 'give', 'hope', 'things', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'better', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'got', 'was', 'still', 'film', 'had', 'sense', 'realism', 'lot', 'ways', 'could', 'appreciate.Certainly', ""n't"", 'story', 'everyman', 'who', 'just', 'scraping', 'laid', 'off', 'factory', 'job', 'Instead', 'story', 'executives', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'off', 'successful', 'perches', 'brought', 'down', 'reality', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'facing', 'past', 'few', 'years.Ben', 'Affleck', 'main', 'character', 'Sales', 'Executive', 'who', '160k', 'year', 'spends', 'twice', 'that', 'much', 'Porche', 'driveway', 'house', 'probably', 'worth', 'close', 'million', 'good', 'market', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'one', 'step', 'Ben', 'job', 'food', 'chain', 'same', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'pulled', 'up', 'bootstraps', 'coming', 'factory', 'floor', 'way', 'up', 'director', 'level', 'position', 'company', 'having', 'thirty', 'years', 'too', 'door', 'latest', 'cuts', 'having', 'even', 'harder', 'time', 'coming', 'grips', 'new', 'jobless', 'existence', 'Ben', 'fact', 'one', 'notice', 'life', 'over', 'worst', 'part', 'wife', 'stay', 'house', 'six', 'night', 'so', 'none', 'neighbors', 'realize', 'unemployed', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'pay', 'daughter', 'senior', 'trip', 'Italy', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'make', 'mortgage', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'VP', 'same', 'company', 'boss', 'Ben', 'Chris', 'characters', 'one', 'founders', 'company', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'CEO', 'played', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'wrong', 'cutting', 'jobs', 'just', 'appease', 'stock', 'holders', 'too', 'cut', 'post', 'job', 'loss', 'struggles', 'are', 'not', 'financial', 'sort', 'more', 'related', 'revelation', 'had', 'lost', 'way', 'creator', 'tangible', 'things', 'ships', 'company', 'used', 'build-something', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'could', 'point', 'be', 'proud', 'of.As', 'mentioned', 'was', 'unemployed', 'when', 'saw', 'preview', 'movie', 'am', 'now', 'thankfully', 'employed', 'again', 'fact', 'people', 'film', 'were', 'executives', 'who', 'make', 'more', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'there', 'story', 'still', 'realization', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'different', 'when', 'losing', 'job', 'Denial', 'anger', 'rejection', 'sense', 'abject', 'failure', 'pondering', 'true', 'worth', 'world', 'family', 'play', 'role', 'process', 'Accepting', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'accept', 'job', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'love', 'also', 'something', 'came', 'light', 'film', 'appreciated', 'real', 'genuine.Overall', ""n't"", 'fun', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'everyone', 'think', 'show', 'how', 'hard', 'place', 'world', 'how', 'ruthless', 'can', 'be', 'can', 'be', 'hope', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'fight', 'feel', 'giving', 'up', 'have', 'keep', 'fighting', 'matter', 'what', 'appreciate', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'even', 'lost']",N/A

The lie CEO's tell about corporate loyalty is that it is really only a one way street: you should be loyal to the company no matter what is asked of you, but it will only be loyal to you as long as it is convenient for the company. Some have criticized the movie for its focus on the higher level employees, and those critics sadly miss the point: those people, especially Chris Cooper's ill-fated 30 year veteran, invested large amounts of time and effort to reach the levels they were at. Yet, in the end they were just as expendable as the base line secretary.  The great achievement of the movie comes out the ending and the options people face when abruptly put into an unemployed situation after years of service and sacrifice for the company that just fired them: You can try applying to another ungrateful behemoth in hopes of landing a similar job, give up and end your life, or take the entrepreneurial approach and start your own business.

It wasn't even released nationwide, or at least not at a theater near me, and very little promotion was given to it. I think that's a shame because it's an enjoyable film that actually explores not just the recent economy and downsizing in Corporate America but the North American situation (obsession with property, possessions and passing pleasures rather than true happiness). That said, I understand that films involving the recent economy haven't done well and I can see why many people wouldn't be eager to get out only to sit in a theater and watch what can be seen as a very depressing story that has a lot of truth to it.Outside of that fact I still say this is a good film if not entirely great. Ben Affleck is well cast and likable as a man who has it all until his company is hurt by the economy and he finds himself included in the list of recent layoffs, the last thing he expected given his position at the company. He is eager to find a new job and believes he'll have no problem given his credentials but he soon finds the only positions he can attain are those that he considers beneath him. Soon his termination package runs out and he and his wife (excellently played by Rosemarie Dewitt) have to face some realities about their nice house and many possessions including a beautiful sports car. Dewitt and Affleck do a great job of playing a couple under a lot of stress who still clearly love each other.The film isn't as depressing as it sounds based on that synopsis, from there Ben Affleck's character slowly realizes that when all else fades family remains constant and his parents and brother in law (Kevin Costner) help him make it through to the other side.While this goes on Tommy Lee Jones plays a higher business executive at the same company who is very upset with the way the company is being run. When he is eventually let go despite suggestions that could help the company he finds himself dissatisfied with his life and looking to find new meaning. Craig T. Nelson plays the head of the company who causes more issues by taking jobs out of the industrial end of the company to keep investors happy. Chris Cooper does an excellent job playing a man in the same position as Affleck only with much less fortunate results when he doesn't have the same support group (truly the most tragic aspect of the film).Economy films are a lot like films about the Iraq war, not many want to hear anymore about these issues with the media already bombarding us. However, I would say this isn't so much an economy film as it is a film about a very specific aspect of the current human condition that just happens to use the recent economy issues as a starting point (much like how The Hurt Locker wasn't specifically about Iraq).To me the film wasn't as depressing as others are painting it to be because the message wasn't about how bad things can get, it was about how good we can make things. Everything is a choice, if we stop becoming obsessed with things we have no control over in hopes of stability, if we stop building things up and acting as if they can never fall down, if we accept that nothing is permanent other than the happiness we give ourselves then we might move past all this and be in a better place, a place that can't be taken away from us.The ending keeps it from being a truly great film, leaving things wrapped up almost too neatly too suddenly despite attempting to be openended and leaving Affleck's character with a mountain to climb. Still, if you liked last year's Up In The Air you'll enjoy this and if your interested in how business's wind up in trouble or if you like films that show the strength of family then this may be for you, give it a try. I hope this film finds a larger audience on Blu-Ray and DVD, I will certainly be adding it to my collection for repeat viewings.* I hope this release has a director's commentary.",5,"""You can probably skip the diet cokes.

The acting was wonderful with some heavy-hitting stars like Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner and Chris Cooper. As much as I was happy to see them, I was just as delighted to see Eamonn Walker, who did a beautiful job of playing Howlin' Wolf in ""Cadillac Records."" And what a team the entire cast made, including the people I didn't mention.This film is a sobering look at how a company's greed with bonuses lead to a group of successful, wealthy businessmen being fired. The scenes that were cut, especially the pizzeria, can almost make you want to cry. The film definitely doesn't hold back when it comes to the issues of ageism and being overqualified. There was even a scene that hit a little too close to home with a guy flying out of state for a job interview. I won't say what happened to him there, but that same thing actually happened to me about eight years ago so while Affleck was acting, his reaction was very similar to mine.I don't know if people can truly enjoy the film considering today's job market (it may hit too close to home), but viewers should certainly respect it. It was an outstanding film that should've gotten far more publicity. I do wonder if the reason it may have slipped under the radar is because people just couldn't see paying to watch their own reality on the big screen. Either way, it was one helluva film.

Although some say that their socioeconomic status makes the characters hard to relate to (since they aren't everyday, average men)I believe that the screenwriter used ""wealthy men"" to show that the job loss crisis is affecting all American groups. No one is spared, and there is little, if any loyalty left in Corporate America.  In fact, it is ironic that Walker is let go, since he is responsible for downsizing and getting rid of other employees at the company for cost-saving measures. (This is hinted at by Jack Dolan (a character played convincingly by Kevin Costner).Like many Americans, although Walker is living the facade of a rich, easy life -- he is, in fact, is living paycheck to paycheck  -- having to worry about meeting higher house payments (after a mortgage reset) and other expenses.

Nelson)--who cares only about the stockholders, a new corporate headquarters, and his salary and stock options--cuts divisions and lays off thousands of workers--some of whom have been with him and the firm for decades. It's not that they aren't hardworking and dedicated, it's just ""business.""One of the men who is laid off is in his thirties (Ben Affleck); the other is twenty years older (Chris Cooper). Another (Tommy Lee Jones) roomed in college with the CEO and helped him build the company from the ground up, concentrating on shipbuilding in the Boston area. All three men live lavishly, with fancy houses, furnishings, and cars.Affleck is great as the proud, bitter, and then humbled white-collar executive, who has to sell his million-dollar home (in the depressed housing market) and Porsche, and then move in with his parents and work for his brother-in-law (played nicely by Kevin Costner) constructing someone else's mega-house. Cooper is also good--downtrodden and desperate, forced to dye his hair, and grovel at job interviews and with associates. And Jones is wonderful--a man with a conscience in the business world, who cares about the people who work at GTX. He also starts to reevaluate his life, both professionally and personally, in middle age.The film--written and directed by John Wells--hits home. Most of us know people like the ones we see in The Company Men. They can be vain, pushy, and full of themselves; but when things don't go their way, they can be depressed and helpless. Yes, people need to make a living, but they also need to think about what's really important--family, friends, and self-fulfillment.

Disillusioned, he tells his supportive wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) the bad news and she goes back to work. Meanwhile, the CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) keeps his high salary and plans to buy a new building, much to the voiced objections of his partner Gene McLary (Tommy Lee Jones). Walker tries acting as if he's still living the good life, playing golf with his buddies and is offered a drywalling job by his brother in law (Kevin Costner) which at 1st he turns down. Few people who've reviewed this have mentioned the character of Danny, a friendly black (I did not say African American as the actor, Eamonn Walker, is English) whom Bobby meets at the job placement center. Walker does a great job as Danny and at the job placement office exhorts Bobby to ""do the tiger."" Meanwhile, Sally Wilcox (HR director, bearer of bad news and mistress to McLary) has some more names to add to the list... those of co-founder McLary who has enough money to currently survive and Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), who's put in several years into the company and due to his age, has a harder time starting anew (""I suggest you dye your hair"").John Wells has done a great job with this movie. The language is strong and the character of Bobby Walker comes across as arrogant but likable. Wells does a good job explaining the story and how everything was put together in the commentary (he had a relative of his lose his job). Other extras include deleted scenes, an alternative ending and a special Making The Company Men (pretty generous, considering how many DVD's nowadays leave most of the extra's on Blue-Ray's, as if anyone could afford them).

His division was shipbuilding which is one of the last industries to recover from a recession. Ben tells his wife who goes immediately into the downsize frugal mode. Affleck is in denial and doesn't want to do anything to change their life, i.e. maintain the $600 a month eating out and dry cleaning bill.Tommy Lee Jones plays Affleck's former boss. He was ""out of the loop"" when Affleck got laid off. He feels bad about it, but like everyone else at the company they fear more for their own job than give sympathy. The movie smartly shifts back and forth juxtaposing Tommy Lee's life drinking unblended scotch, and Affleck trying to get a job while telling no one he is unemployed. He breaks all the rules in the book by not networking with friends.Affleck's former company is wanting to lay more people off in order to increase the stock price. They are worried about a takeover all the while they are building a new office building in downtown Boston. Affleck is not doing well with anger management at his job interviews as job offers require relocation and his salary reduced to that of my own...I almost feel bad for the guy who may have to sell his Porsche. Affleck is finding out a lot of people lost their job and those looking for jobs are more qualified than him. He is also too proud to ask his blue collar family for help. Tommy Lee is having an affair with a woman at work, Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) who provides us with some gratuitous down sized brief nudity.I really have no pity for Affleck. He has 12 weeks pay and he could have been working during that time for his BIL. His Massachusetts unemployment benefits (which is never mentioned) is more than what most of my neighbors make. He didn't downsize his life in a timely manner.

1364502,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003UESJEM,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 7]","Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck), the star salesman at a ship builder, arrives at work one day to find he has been laid off. He searches for his boss and mentor, Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), the number two man and learns he is away at a conference. Returning home, he tells his wife, Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) the news. She is shocked but puts on a game face and immediately starts making plans; they can sell the house, she can go back to work, Bobby can sell his Porsche. But Bobby is confident he can find another six-figure sale position very quickly. Gene returns to home base and learns of the lay offs. Confronting Salinger (Craig T. Nelson), his long time friend and the head of the company, he learns the lay offs were done in an attempt to boost the company's flagging stock value. Gene doesn't agree with the business plan but stays to try to stem the flow of blood. Soon, his friend Phil (Chris Cooper) is laid off. Both men have great difficulty adjusting. Eventually, Bobby is forced to make his last choice move; he must go to work for his brother-in-law Jack (Kevin Costner), a contractor restoring an old house. Bobby doesn't like him or get along with him, but he needs the work.""The Company Men"", the new film from writer-director John Wells, one of the people behind ""ER"", ""LA Law"", ""Shameless"" and many other television hits, is a timely, prescient film featuring an impressive cast. And it has many good points. But ultimately, I failed to connect with the film to the degree I was expecting.Ben Affleck plays Bobby, the cocky young salesman who is very good at his job. He also enjoys spending the money he earns on a fancy house and all the things his family could need; a Porsche and golf club membership for him, his wife doesn't need to work. Life is good. And it's better because they are living beyond their means. When Bobby gets laid off, he is shocked, but also confident it is a temporary thing. He must not watch the news much.Bobby feels betrayed by Gene, his boss. And as he realizes the job market is a lot scarier that he thought, his frustration becomes almost palpable. We witness an interview he has for a potential job and can identify with his anger with the overworked, supercilious human resources executive. Then, he finally gets a lead and travels to Chicago for an interview.It is difficult to call Bobby the central character of the film, Gene seems to have almost equal screen time, but he is meant to be our guide into this narrative. Because of this, we identify with and have empathy for him. His life is like most of ours. We work, we have families, and we live beyond our means. When something bad happens, the world self-destructs.Affleck is perfectly cast in this role and deftly portrays Bobby. It is interesting to watch the resurgence of Affleck's career. After a string of particularly bad films, he resurfaced a few years ago and directed the well-made and well-praised ""Gone Baby Gone"", ending a few year long sabbatical from Hollywood. He proved that ""Gone"" was not a fluke with ""The Town"", also featuring one of his best performances. Now, he adds another impressive star turn to his IMDB profile.Gene McClarey is meant to be the conscience of the company and he is clearly willing to question and fight every one of Salinger's decisions. They have known each other for decades and worked together for almost as long. When the company decides to lay off ""thousands"" and leaves the HR people to come up with a list of possible redundancies, he realizes something is wrong. He certainly enjoys the benefits of his salary and position; he and his wife live in a beautiful house on the water, his wife thinks nothing of spending $16,000 on an antique side table. But Gene also wants to do everything he can do to save the jobs of the employees. They are real people. There has to be an alternative. There must be and he won't stop until he finds it.Tommy Lee Jones is also expertly cast. When Gene doesn't get what he wants, he feels betrayed and you can see the pain etched in his face. This helps us understand why he is trying so hard to help so many.Chris Cooper plays Phil, a former shop foreman who has worked long and hard to get to the executive office. Once there, he enjoys the fancy lunches and other aspects of his life too much. When he gets laid off, he has the most difficult time adjusting because people take one look at him and dismiss him.Each of the three men are representative of two different generations and three different types of people hurt by massive lay offs at large corporations. They are meant to illustrate the problems happening everywhere all over the country.Maria Bello plays Sally, the HR person who is in charge of making all of these layoffs happen. You can see a dead quality in her eyes. She doesn't enjoy the job, but she does it because it is her job. Also, Sally must know that at some point she is also going to have to deliver a severance package to herself.And Costner's Jack is meant to be the everyman, the man who is doing everything right. Living modestly, and within his means, he has a large, happy family and helps his employees, guys who also have large happy families.""The Company Men"" is really a lot more subtle than my synopsis of each man's plight might lead you to believe. But it isn't subtle enough. There is a strange disconnect in this film. Yes, it's subtle, but because everyone is so clear-cut, each character has a clear mission in the story. Because Jack is so clearly the one we should be emulating, the narrative almost seems a little preachy. This is what you should have done and because you didn't, you're now in this mess. And this ultimately becomes annoying, rising to the surface, obscuring any of the good, honest performances. I think we understand the problem after watching hours of newscasts and reading hundreds of pages of articles. To have Wells address this issue through Jack and Bobby's performances just seems to be rubbing it in. And this really left a bad taste in my mouth.Which is a shame because each of the actors is very good and their performances seem custom fit for each of their personas.""The Company Men"" is an Oscar worthy film in many ways. All of the performances are very good and each of the actors is very Oscar-friendly. The studio apparently agrees because they released the film for a one-week limited engagement in December. All films must play for at least a week before December 31 in order to qualify for the Academy Awards. I think they expected at least a couple of nominations to help provide them with a marketing tool when the film was ultimately released 'wide' in January. Unfortunately, the film received no nominations for either the Golden Globes or the Oscars. Perhaps the Academy voters felt the same way and recognized the film was not subtle enough to deserve such recognition.Now, if the Academy voters would only agree with me about all films.",3,"Affleck

He has a great job at a conglomerate company, a pretty neat boss, Gene (Tommy Lee Jones), a good wife and two kids in a fabulous New England home. Then the crash of 2008 occurs and Bobby's job, despite twelve years at GTX (a transportation company of some sort), wasn't so valuable after all. Soon he has to figure out what his measure of a man truly is, and it's not pretty. ""The Comapny Men"" focuses mostly on Bobby's struggle, but it is an ensemble film with strong support from Chris Cooper, who struggles with the realization that a man pushing 60 in this job market is paddling upstream against younger and cheaper help, Kevin Costner, a contractor who is (IMHO) written into a cliched part, Craig T Nelson, the CEO making 22 million as he downsized left and right, and Mario Bello as the HR director who begins to doubt her ethics.This is not an easy movie to watch, as it probably cuts a bit too close to the bone in a country facing 9% unemployment. Bobby and Phil (Cooper) soon finding that there are sacrifices both intentional and unintentional that have to be made for the sake of survival. There's also underlying messages about being prepared for the future and just how much we've thrown away for ""kids working for a dollar a day"" (as Costner's character unsubtly jibes Bobby incessantly). People are losing their cars, homes, families and lives in reality; ""The Company Men"" holds up an unflinching camera to this world.

However, I wish that the movie wasn't so predictable or depressing.The movie starts with snapshots of media coverage from the 2008 financial crisis and then follows the life of top executives at a publicly-held company.  A few of these men lose their jobs while the others remain employed.  Each handles their predicament and the fate of their colleagues differently.Although the movie has an upbeat ending, the rest of the movie is quite predictable.

1364505,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003UESJEM,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","The Company Men was a sobering watch, and though it is not without its flaws, the excellent cast makes this a worthwhile watch. The movie focuses on a couple of white men holding white-collar jobs and how the economic downturn affects them and their personal lives. Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) plays a hotshot executive at a major corporation and at the beginning of the movie appears to be living the American dream - he owns a McMansion, has a Porsche, a stay-at-home wife, and two kids, oh, and a country club membership. Walker's world comes crashing down when he is laid off as part of his company's downsizing. He spends a third of the movie in denial, arrogantly assuming he will be re-employed in no time, refusing to downsize his life of luxuries (snapping at his wife when she refuses to pay the overdue country club membership), and basically refuses to accept the new reality of his life. His practical wife on the other hand goes back to her nursing job and convinces Walker to sell the house and move the family in with his parents to save costs. A large chunk of the movie deals with Walker's coping during this tough period, and how he eventually comes to accept his circumstances. Kevin Costner plays Walker's builder bro-in-law, Jack Dolan, who despite his own financial difficulties, reaches out to help his sister's family.Then there's Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) who is at loggerheads with friend and company CEO, James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson). Salinger embodies corporate greed, choosing to lay off as many workers as he can to satisfy his stock holders and maintain his 22 million salary. When McClary is inevitably let go, the former top executive does some deep soul-searching about where he wants to go next. Another company man, Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) does not fare as well. In his fifties and set in his ways, Phil takes the lay-off the worst - he is at his wits' end trying to figure out where he fits in the world, given that all his working life has been devoted to Salinger's company.The movie is not without flaws. Walker is portrayed as earning 160 K, and yet has this lavish lifestyle. In reality, that salary would never be able to afford Walker such a luxurious lifestyle in the Northeast (the writers may need a reality check here). Then there's the weak sub-plot of McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) having an extramarital affair with the HR lady (Maria Bello). There is no real credibility in this relationship and their intimate scenes fall flat and cold.However, the movie is sobering because it shows how even the upper middle class did not remain unscathed by the downturn, and serves as a wake-up call of sorts. Walker's character undergoes a sort of evolution as the movie progresses, learning the familiar lessons of sacrifice, endurance, perseverance, compromise, and above all, about what really matters. It also shows how some families learn to survive despite the odds, and some crumble in the face of difficulties. It was not a pleasant watch, but the strong performances by the three main actors makes this a compelling movie.",3,Sobering movie about three white-collar men dealing with the downturn,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,3082,"['Company', 'Men', 'was', 'sobering', 'watch', 'not', 'flaws', 'excellent', 'cast', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'movie', 'couple', 'white', 'men', 'holding', 'white-collar', 'jobs', 'how', 'economic', 'downturn', 'personal', 'lives', 'Bobby', 'Walker', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'hotshot', 'executive', 'major', 'corporation', 'beginning', 'movie', 'be', 'living', 'American', 'dream', 'McMansion', 'Porsche', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'oh', 'country', 'club', 'membership', 'Walker', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'laid', 'off', 'part', 'company', 'downsizing', 'third', 'movie', 'denial', 'arrogantly', 'assuming', 'will', 'be', 're-employed', 'time', 'refusing', 'downsize', 'life', 'luxuries', 'snapping', 'wife', 'when', 'pay', 'overdue', 'country', 'club', 'membership', 'basically', 'accept', 'new', 'reality', 'life', 'practical', 'wife', 'other', 'hand', 'back', 'nursing', 'job', 'convinces', 'Walker', 'sell', 'house', 'move', 'family', 'parents', 'save', 'costs', 'large', 'chunk', 'movie', 'deals', 'Walker', 'coping', 'tough', 'period', 'how', 'eventually', 'accept', 'circumstances', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Walker', 'builder', 'bro-in-law', 'Jack', 'Dolan', 'who', 'own', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'out', 'help', 'sister', 'family.Then', 'Gene', 'McClary', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'loggerheads', 'friend', 'company', 'CEO', 'James', 'Salinger', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Salinger', 'corporate', 'greed', 'choosing', 'lay', 'off', 'many', 'workers', 'can', 'satisfy', 'stock', 'holders', 'maintain', '22', 'million', 'salary', 'When', 'McClary', 'inevitably', 'let', 'go', 'former', 'top', 'executive', 'deep', 'soul-searching', 'where', 'go', 'next', 'company', 'man', 'Phil', 'Woodward', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'not', 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'fifties', 'set', 'ways', 'Phil', 'lay-off', 'worst', 'wits', 'end', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'world', 'given', 'working', 'life', 'been', 'devoted', 'Salinger', 'company.The', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'Walker', 'portrayed', 'earning', '160', 'K', 'yet', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'reality', 'salary', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'Walker', 'luxurious', 'lifestyle', 'Northeast', 'writers', 'may', 'need', 'reality', 'check', 'here', 'Then', 'weak', 'sub-plot', 'McClary', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'having', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'HR', 'lady', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'real', 'credibility', 'relationship', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'fall', 'flat', 'cold.However', 'movie', 'sobering', 'how', 'even', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'did', 'not', 'remain', 'unscathed', 'downturn', 'wake-up', 'call', 'sorts', 'Walker', 'character', 'sort', 'evolution', 'movie', 'learning', 'familiar', 'lessons', 'sacrifice', 'endurance', 'perseverance', 'compromise', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'also', 'how', 'families', 'learn', 'survive', 'odds', 'crumble', 'face', 'difficulties', 'was', 'not', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'strong', 'performances', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'compelling', 'movie']",N/A
