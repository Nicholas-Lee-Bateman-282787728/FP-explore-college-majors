This is a great story of love and loss.  Ross Poldark arrives home after years in the British army in the America (How often do we Americans see a redcoat as a hero?) to find his father dead and his beloved Elizabeth engaged to his cousin Francis.  Ross endures intense depression, then finds two new loves, his future wife Demelza and his copper mines.  He defends both and comes close to losing both in one scheme after another.  All the time his unrequited love for Elizabeth hangs over him and his family.The Poldark story is a good picture of late eighteenth century England as the old gentry, represented by the Poldarks, struggles for control against the up and coming new commercial elite, represented here by the Warleggan family.

352539,A26KIF01GEUXBT,6303042562,Kyle Pratt,"[2, 2]","The Poldark miniseries is an excellent BBC adaptation of the first four novels by Winston Graham, published in the 1950's.Created for the BBC in mid-1970, it was clearly made for television.  The production budget was adequate but not lavish.  Interiors were obviously video taped on a sound stage.  But, despite those drawbacks it remains a compelling story.Winston Graham set his novel just a bit earlier than the writing of Jane Austen, the late eighteenth century.  As the story opens the protagonist, Ross Poldark, from a prominent Cornish family, has just returned from fighting the colonists in America.  But reports that he has died proceeded his return and Ross learns, his father has, in fact, died leaving the family estate in near financial ruin.  Finally, believing that Ross, has died in the war, Elizabeth, the woman he had courted before his departure, has engaged herself to a cousin of Ross Poldark.  All of that in the opening minutes of the first episode.This is an excellent miniseries for fans of the genre.  Unfortunately, it is no longer available new but you can still buy the VHS version used on Amazon.com or borrow it from the library.  I don't believe that it has ever been released in DVD format for North America.Kyle Pratt",5,An Excellent BBC Miniseries,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1254,"['Poldark', 'miniseries', 'excellent', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'first', 'four', 'novels', 'Winston', 'Graham', 'published', ""1950's.Created"", 'BBC', 'mid-1970', 'was', 'clearly', 'made', 'television', 'production', 'budget', 'was', 'adequate', 'not', 'lavish', 'Interiors', 'were', 'obviously', 'video', 'taped', 'sound', 'stage', 'drawbacks', 'compelling', 'story.Winston', 'Graham', 'set', 'novel', 'just', 'bit', 'earlier', 'writing', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'late', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'story', 'protagonist', 'Ross', 'Poldark', 'prominent', 'Cornish', 'family', 'just', 'returned', 'fighting', 'colonists', 'America', 'reports', 'died', 'proceeded', 'return', 'Ross', 'learns', 'father', 'fact', 'died', 'leaving', 'family', 'estate', 'near', 'financial', 'ruin', 'Finally', 'believing', 'Ross', 'died', 'war', 'Elizabeth', 'woman', 'had', 'courted', 'departure', 'engaged', 'cousin', 'Ross', 'Poldark', 'opening', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode.This', 'excellent', 'miniseries', 'fans', 'genre', 'Unfortunately', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'new', 'can', 'still', 'buy', 'VHS', 'version', 'used', 'Amazon.com', 'borrow', 'library', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ever', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'format', 'North', 'America.Kyle', 'Pratt']",Poldark 1 VHS
352540,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6303042562,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","My sister has always raved about the Poldark series that was shown on Masterpiece Theatre in the mid nineteen seventies. When it first became available on video, though it was expensive, she promptly bought the first set of six tapes and has yet to tire of watching them. Knowing how much I love period pieces, she urged me to watch it, telling me that she was sure that I, too, would love it. Well, she was right.This is a first rate period piece, set in late eighteenth century Cornwall. It focuses on Ross Poldark, scion of a well known Cornish family. He is a member of the established gentry and a gentleman. Having been gone from Cornwall for a time to fight against the colonists, he returns battle scarred only to find that his father has died and left the family estate in ruins and in debt. He also finds that the love of his life, Elizabeth, believing that Ross had been killed in battle, has become engaged to his first cousin, Francis Poldark. He also discovers to his dismay that the upstart but wealthy Warleggan family, for whom Poldark has no love, is trying to buy the Poldark family mine. This mightily upsets Ross, as the Poldarks represent old money and the established gentry, while the Warleggans represent new money and are social upstarts.As Ross Poldark tries to rebuild his estate and family fortune, he takes in a red headed, feisty, young street urchin who turns out to be a hoyden with the unlikely name of Demelza. Firmly ensconcing herself on the Poldark estate, she helps Poldark rebuild his estate, scrubbing. cleaning, all while falling in love with the brooding Ross, as he moons for Elizabeth and fends off the Warleggans who appear to conspire to ruin Poldark at every turn. A night of passion, however, finally finds Poldark looking at Demelza with new eyes, and his sense of honor compels him to marry her, little knowing that he would be getting the bargain of his life in doing so.This is the story of Ross Poldark and Demelza, their families and friends, their loves and enemies. It is a story of sweeping proportions and a fine dynastic saga. It is also a story of the intense rivalry between the Poldarks and the Warleggans, a rivalry that would pit the scions of each of these families, Ross Poldark and George Warleggan, in a life long personal battle that nearly destroys them both. Based upon a series of books by Winston Graham, the Poldark series does honor to the author's work.Robin Ellis is outstanding as the honorable, though brooding, Ross Poldark. When the viewer first sees him, the viewer wonders what on earth all the fuss is about. Within minutes, however, the viewer finds oneself half falling in love with his character. Angharad Rees is delightful as the feisty, impish little red head and is guaranteed to win the heart of every viewer. Robert Bates gives an affecting performance as Poldark's enemy, George Warleggan, a despicable yet, at the same time, curiously touching, individual. Jill Townsend is appropriately cool and aloof as the ever unattainable Elizabeth of Ross' dreams. Richard Morant gives a stellar performance as the kind and compassionate Dr. Enys, a close friend of Ross Poldark. The rest of the supporting cast is also quite strong and contributes to the success of this tale of romance and adventure in the Cornish countryside.This is a video set well worth having in one's personal collection.

352542,A24ZSL01CO4BBG,6303042562,"Robert M. Collette ""rcollette""","[29, 30]","This excellent series was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater back in 1975 and is based on the novels by Winston Graham.  It plays out much like an 18th Century soap opera.  Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) is the story's  central character; after being injured during the Revolutionary War, he  returns to his home in England (Cornwall).  What he discovers ignites a  chain of events that is brilliantly designed to grab and hold the viewer's  attention until the very end.  You do not need an elaborate understanding  of England's history during this time-period to follow or enjoy the Poldark  series...it is no more than an countless string of captivating subplots  complete with daring rescues and dangerous liaisons, each carefully woven  to support but never overshadow the story's crux: a complex, intricate love  triangle that would stupefy Pythagoras himself.Overall, I found the  series to be more entertaining than Graham's books, which at times were  slow and uninvolving.  However, the story does not end with Poldark 2:  Graham continues the saga with several more books (including ""The Loving  Cup,"" which is currently out of print), but alas, except for ""Stranger from  the Sea,"" these were never adapted to the small screen.  If nothing else, I  suggest you watch the series to get to know Demelza (Angharad Rees), one of  the most stunningly beautiful women I have ever seen.",5,"An Astonishing, Largely Unknown Series",963792000,"07 17, 2000",2000,1391,"['excellent', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'broadcast', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'back', '1975', 'based', 'novels', 'Winston', 'Graham', 'out', 'much', '18th', 'Century', 'soap', 'opera', 'Ross', 'Poldark', 'Robin', 'Ellis', 'story', 'central', 'character', 'being', 'injured', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'home', 'England', 'Cornwall', 'What', 'chain', 'events', 'brilliantly', 'designed', 'grab', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'very', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'elaborate', 'understanding', 'England', 'history', 'time-period', 'follow', 'enjoy', 'Poldark', 'series', 'more', 'countless', 'string', 'captivating', 'subplots', 'complete', 'daring', 'rescues', 'dangerous', 'liaisons', 'carefully', 'woven', 'support', 'never', 'overshadow', 'story', 'crux', 'complex', 'intricate', 'love', 'triangle', 'would', 'stupefy', 'Pythagoras', 'himself.Overall', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Graham', 'books', 'times', 'were', 'slow', 'uninvolving', 'However', 'story', 'not', 'end', 'Poldark', '2', 'Graham', 'saga', 'several', 'more', 'books', 'including', 'Loving', 'Cup', 'currently', 'print', 'alas', 'Stranger', 'Sea', 'were', 'never', 'adapted', 'small', 'screen', 'nothing', 'else', 'suggest', 'watch', 'series', 'get', 'know', 'Demelza', 'Angharad', 'Rees', 'one', 'most', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'women', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",Poldark 1 VHS
