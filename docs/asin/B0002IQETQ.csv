It didn't hold my interest for 5 mins.  I was shopping on Amazon through most of the movie however, I was completely aware of what wasn't taking place in this, (I don't even want to classify this as a film) travesty.  Acting, special effects, & makeup were all atrocious.  This doesn't even rate 1 star.  Very disappointed.  I expected it to be @ the very least good.  One of the worst zombie flicks ever attempted.",1,A travesty!!!,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,540,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'finally', 'ended', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', '5', 'mins', 'was', 'shopping', 'Amazon', 'most', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'completely', 'aware', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'classify', 'film', 'travesty', 'Acting', 'special', 'effects', 'makeup', 'were', 'atrocious', ""n't"", 'even', 'rate', '1', 'star', 'Very', 'disappointed', 'expected', 'be', 'very', 'least', 'good', 'One', 'worst', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'ever', 'attempted']",N/A

No, this isn't a comedy. A journalist runs into a local man in a town that she seeks a story. He tells two bogus tales of terror. A man does exercise for 15 minutes in the first story. BORING. The sound, editing, acting, and over all product is BAD. I am a big fan of gore and bloody zombie effects. This had nothing to offer me.

The gore is weak, the zombies aren't impressive in the least, the acting is abominable even for B-movie fare, the stories aren't interesting at all. There's just nothing here. I saw the 3D version, and some of the interesting little 3D bits were the only good thing at all. But a few cool 3D shots are not near enough to save a movie. Not at all. Just avoid this one. The only reason my friend picked it up is because we're major zombie fans. And we were sorely disappointed.

The man tells her two tales of zombies before we get to the all too easy foreseeable ending.First off in these ""Creep Show"" type stories, there has to be three tales. Two doesn't make it. As far as a low budget zombie films go, this is one of the better ones that utilize some decent make-up, rubber hands, and well, okay the eyes were pretty bad. I didn't like the guy with the Vietnam syndrome. It is not something you make fun of. The acting and plot were better than normal for a home made film.Also I watched this on a Sterling DVD set and the quality was bad, stopping and skipping. It was a new DVD too. I only mention this because I had quality issues with them before. The Russian guy at the flea market who takes a video camera into theaters does a better job. I would suggest if you plan on making a purchase, buy a USED DVD, one that has been watched by the owner and you know works.Parental Guide: F-bomb, tent sex scene, no nudity. 3 1/2 stars",4,NIXON IS DEAD!,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,1051,"['woman', 'up', 'lover', 'whiskey', 'way', 'Scopesboro', 'library', 'research', 'story', 'man', 'two', 'tales', 'zombies', 'get', 'too', 'easy', 'foreseeable', 'ending.First', 'off', 'Creep', 'Show', 'type', 'stories', 'be', 'three', 'tales', 'Two', ""n't"", 'make', 'As', 'far', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'films', 'go', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'utilize', 'decent', 'make-up', 'rubber', 'hands', 'well', 'eyes', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'guy', 'Vietnam', 'syndrome', 'not', 'something', 'make', 'fun', 'acting', 'plot', 'were', 'better', 'normal', 'home', 'made', 'film.Also', 'watched', 'Sterling', 'DVD', 'set', 'quality', 'was', 'bad', 'stopping', 'skipping', 'was', 'new', 'DVD', 'too', 'only', 'mention', 'had', 'quality', 'issues', 'Russian', 'guy', 'flea', 'market', 'who', 'video', 'camera', 'theaters', 'better', 'job', 'would', 'suggest', 'plan', 'making', 'purchase', 'buy', 'USED', 'DVD', 'one', 'been', 'watched', 'owner', 'know', 'works.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'tent', 'sex', 'scene', 'nudity', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A
835633,A2CO0TBEGUZCZP,B0002IQETQ,"Tom Goryssimo ""xploitation poet""","[16, 20]","ZOMBIES CHRONICLES is a low budget flick from Brad Sykes ( CAMP BLOOD 1 and 2, DEATH FACTORY... )and the crew from STERLING ENTERTAINMENT. And yeah..., you also got the legendary GORE FX from  JOE CASTRO involved.Now,if you know a litle bit about the B.Movies world, You know what to expect : gore, nudity and a really cool campy movie. Yeah... it's shot on video and maybe all the actors are not that good. But who cares ? If you do, stay away from anything that looks like a B.Movie.I mean, sure that's nothing like ROMERO's holy dead trilogy or even the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD's. Hell, I even agree with the other rewiewer who says that REDNECK ZOMBIES is better than that flick. Still ZOMBIE CHRONICLES delivers the goodies.You got great looking FLESH EATING ROTTEN ZOMBIES, NUDITY, BLOOD and GUTS. So if you're an GOREHOUND and a ZOMBIE fan like I am and don't mind the film being cheap, just spend a few bucks.
