1127068,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0010X740U,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[0, 0]","With the Olympic Games grabbing their share of the headlines these days, let's look at a film about an athlete ""coming out"" in another country ... Iceland.""Eleven Men Out"" (Iceland, 2005) is about a soccer star on one of the best amateur teams in that country, who abruptly decides to ""come out"" as gay, much to the surprise and complete shock of his teammates, father (who is apparently the head coach of the team), mother, siblings, ex-wife and teenage son. It doesn't go well, with his son ashamed of him, his ex-wife using it as an excuse to relapse with an alcohol problem, and the team trustees benching him until they eventually decide he can no longer play there.  A friend who coaches a lesser-known (and apparently much more diverse, with several openly gay members) team invites him to join, and the ""Pride"" - which becomes almost 100% gay as others hear about it - starts to rack up victories, eventually taking on his old team, in a sold-out game on Gay Pride Day in Iceland.It's a pleasant coming-out story, but seems more like a documentary than a film with characters and a plot.  We never really get to know Ottar (the player who ""outs"" himself) beyond the facts that he has a past and is somewhat self-centered in not considering (and preparing others for) the possible implications of his announcement to the press, as well as in dealing with a teammate he starts dating.  Some of the dialogue seems ad-libbed and frivilous, but that could be due to the fact that I was following English subtitles (The film is in Icelandic).  Several seemingly gratuitious shots of the players in the shower make this seem almost like a ""Full Monty"" remake at times, and the ending - though perhaps realistic - is too abrupt.  Similar stories have been told better, and this could have been too.DVD includes several featurettes about gay amateur athletes. I give it three stars out of five.",3,"Somewhat pleasant, but lacks substance to be really good.",1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,1893,"['Olympic', 'Games', 'grabbing', 'share', 'headlines', 'days', 'let', 'look', 'film', 'athlete', 'coming', 'out', 'country', 'Iceland', 'Eleven', 'Men', 'Out', 'Iceland', '2005', 'soccer', 'star', 'one', 'best', 'amateur', 'teams', 'country', 'who', 'abruptly', 'come', 'out', 'gay', 'much', 'surprise', 'complete', 'shock', 'teammates', 'father', 'who', 'apparently', 'head', 'coach', 'team', 'mother', 'siblings', 'ex-wife', 'teenage', 'son', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'son', 'ashamed', 'ex-wife', 'using', 'excuse', 'relapse', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'team', 'trustees', 'benching', 'eventually', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'play', 'there', 'A', 'friend', 'who', 'lesser-known', 'apparently', 'much', 'more', 'diverse', 'several', 'openly', 'gay', 'members', 'team', 'join', 'Pride', 'almost', '100', '%', 'gay', 'others', 'hear', 'rack', 'up', 'victories', 'eventually', 'taking', 'old', 'team', 'sold-out', 'game', 'Gay', 'Pride', 'Day', 'Iceland.It', 'pleasant', 'coming-out', 'story', 'more', 'documentary', 'film', 'characters', 'plot', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Ottar', 'player', 'who', 'outs', 'facts', 'past', 'somewhat', 'self-centered', 'not', 'considering', 'preparing', 'others', 'possible', 'implications', 'announcement', 'press', 'as', 'well', 'dealing', 'teammate', 'dating', 'dialogue', 'ad-libbed', 'frivilous', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'following', 'English', 'subtitles', 'film', 'Icelandic', 'Several', 'seemingly', 'gratuitious', 'shots', 'players', 'shower', 'make', 'seem', 'almost', 'Full', 'Monty', 'remake', 'times', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'realistic', 'too', 'abrupt', 'Similar', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'too.DVD', 'several', 'featurettes', 'gay', 'amateur', 'athletes', 'give', 'three', 'five']",Eleven Men Out

1127070,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0010X740U,Jeffery Mingo,"[6, 12]","You may want to see the special features about gay, American athletes before watching the film.  See, the US has ""Personal Best"" and ""Breaking the Waves"" about athletes in individual sports, but this Icelandic film breaks new ground by focusing on team sports.  Still, there is a wide golf between professional sports in the US and intramural stuff.  I guess ""leagues"" are more popular in Europe and having a league player come out won't translate as much here.  There are whole gay sports leagues in the US, whereas few athletes, of any sexual orientation, will ever make the professionals and get nationwide attention.That being said, this film does touch upon so many important point.  If one player comes out, how will his straight teammates respond?  How will the opponents respond?  Does having one out player make a team ""gay""?  Will it attract more openly gay players?  Will straight fans disappear and will gay fans mitigate that loss?As needed as this film is, it also felt rushed in so many areas.  The athlete comes out for a dumb reason at the start of the film and does not calculate things in his head the way any reasonable, closeted person would do.  He gets introduced to another gay athlete one second, and BOOM!, they are getting down with each other the next.  The main character's son walks in on his father getting busy and any reasonable parent would have locked the door or their Spidey sense would have told them their child could show up.  Of course, all of this is done to keep up the tension and conflict and get the ball rolling, but it is still highly unrealistic.I saw this film using a certain red-envelope service.  It said the film was in English with English subtitles; it is actually in Icelandic with English subtitles.  (I heard that many Northern Europeans speak English, so the first scenario sounded plausible.)  Obviously, there are cultural gaps here.  The son is called ""Maggi,"" which I later learned was short for ""Magnus.""  However, ""Maggi"" sounds like a girl's name to my American ears.  Think about Maggie Simpson, for example.  One minor character seems to be into Black American hip-hop culture.  He uses some slang and has African-American film posters on his wall.  However, he wears a cowboy hat and many hip-hop B-boys would think of themselves as the antithesis of cowboys.  As a side note, the main character and his ex-wife look WAY too young to be the parents of a teenaged boy.The film fights the image of Iceland as homogenous by showing people of color.  There's a Black, gay man on the team.  (How many brothas live in Iceland!?)  The film seems to be dedicated to a late, biracial male.  The film tries to be bisexual-friendly by having the main character get with his ex.  Like many a gay film, the straight characters often find romantic partners of their own, thus sending the tacit message that gays don't stop straights from getting lucky.  On a possible PC note, one man is seen in a wheelchair using oxygen.  Unfortunately, he says close to no lines, makes no movements, and thus his character may be static, in a problematic way.The film does have a shower scene, for us horny viewers.  Still, parents in Iceland must not get a certain procedure done for newborn sons that American parents usually choose, if you know what I mean!",3,Spectacular and Second-Rate,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,3302,"['may', 'want', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'gay', 'American', 'watching', 'film', 'See', 'US', 'Personal', 'Best', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'athletes', 'individual', 'sports', 'Icelandic', 'film', 'breaks', 'new', 'ground', 'focusing', 'team', 'sports', 'Still', 'wide', 'golf', 'professional', 'sports', 'US', 'intramural', 'stuff', 'guess', 'leagues', 'are', 'more', 'popular', 'Europe', 'having', 'league', 'player', 'come', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'translate', 'much', 'here', 'are', 'whole', 'gay', 'sports', 'leagues', 'US', 'few', 'athletes', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'professionals', 'get', 'nationwide', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'touch', 'so', 'many', 'important', 'point', 'one', 'player', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'straight', 'teammates', 'respond', 'How', 'will', 'opponents', 'respond', 'Does', 'having', 'one', 'player', 'make', 'team', 'gay', 'Will', 'attract', 'more', 'openly', 'gay', 'players', 'Will', 'straight', 'fans', 'disappear', 'will', 'gay', 'fans', 'mitigate', 'loss', 'As', 'needed', 'film', 'also', 'felt', 'rushed', 'so', 'many', 'areas', 'athlete', 'out', 'dumb', 'reason', 'start', 'film', 'not', 'calculate', 'things', 'head', 'way', 'reasonable', 'closeted', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'introduced', 'gay', 'athlete', 'one', 'second', 'BOOM', 'are', 'getting', 'down', 'other', 'next', 'main', 'character', 'son', 'walks', 'father', 'getting', 'busy', 'reasonable', 'parent', 'would', 'have', 'locked', 'door', 'Spidey', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'child', 'could', 'show', 'up', 'course', 'done', 'keep', 'up', 'tension', 'conflict', 'get', 'ball', 'rolling', 'still', 'highly', 'unrealistic.I', 'saw', 'film', 'using', 'certain', 'red-envelope', 'service', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'English', 'English', 'subtitles', 'actually', 'Icelandic', 'English', 'subtitles', 'heard', 'many', 'Northern', 'Europeans', 'speak', 'English', 'first', 'scenario', 'sounded', 'plausible', 'Obviously', 'are', 'cultural', 'gaps', 'here', 'son', 'called', 'Maggi', 'later', 'learned', 'was', 'short', 'Magnus', 'However', 'Maggi', 'girl', 'name', 'American', 'ears', 'Think', 'Maggie', 'Simpson', 'example', 'One', 'minor', 'character', 'be', 'Black', 'American', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'slang', 'African-American', 'film', 'posters', 'wall', 'However', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'many', 'hip-hop', 'B-boys', 'would', 'think', 'antithesis', 'cowboys', 'side', 'note', 'main', 'character', 'ex-wife', 'look', 'WAY', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'parents', 'teenaged', 'boy.The', 'film', 'image', 'Iceland', 'homogenous', 'showing', 'people', 'color', 'Black', 'gay', 'man', 'team', 'How', 'many', 'brothas', 'live', 'Iceland', 'film', 'be', 'dedicated', 'late', 'biracial', 'male', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'bisexual-friendly', 'having', 'main', 'character', 'get', 'ex', 'many', 'gay', 'film', 'straight', 'characters', 'often', 'find', 'romantic', 'partners', 'own', 'thus', 'sending', 'tacit', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'straights', 'getting', 'lucky', 'possible', 'PC', 'note', 'one', 'man', 'seen', 'wheelchair', 'using', 'oxygen', 'Unfortunately', 'close', 'lines', 'movements', 'thus', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'static', 'problematic', 'way.The', 'film', 'have', 'shower', 'scene', 'horny', 'viewers', 'Still', 'parents', 'Iceland', 'must', 'not', 'get', 'certain', 'procedure', 'done', 'newborn', 'sons', 'American', 'parents', 'usually', 'choose', 'know', 'what', 'mean']",Eleven Men Out

1127074,A283RV05QVUTVI,B0010X740U,"Michael L. Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[29, 29]","This is a slick film coming from an interesting place, Iceland, filled with sorta cute people (of both genders) and some interesting family dynamics, and the main plot circles around a sports star.  This film had lots of potential.In a nutshell, the central figure, an Icelandic soccer (""football"") star, Ottar, decides to come out as gay in order to be on the ""front page"" of a magazine.  This leads to problems, as the Icelandic people are evidently quite homophobic, and Ottar is sent packing, his family is enraged/horrified, his son ostracized, and his wife/girlfriend/son's mother is driven further into her liquor-induced semi-coma.Fortunately, there is another soccer team which is more accepting, and Ottar decides to give it a try on a new team, essentially forming a team of gay and gay-friendly men who become quite successful, mostly because nobody else will play them.This film fails, mostly, because of a flaw in the story.  You never get the chance to know or like Ottar beyond the plain facts that he is an attractive, spoiled, self-centered egotistic dummy who does whatever he wants without really thinking his actions or their consequences through.  As such, it's hard to generate much emotional investment in his welfare or the conflicts in the story.  The supporting characters are equally shallow, and you are left with little to watch.Beyond this flaw, the story wanders all over the place, the resolution is still-born, the dialog is filled with witty banter like ""shut up,"" and the sum of the parts is unspectacular.Ironically, there is a trailer for ""Guys & Balls,"" on this DVD, which is a German film with a very similar plot, done with much more style and grace (and humor) which is far more worth your time.
