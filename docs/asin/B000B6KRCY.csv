I finally found what I was looking for when I discovered Patrick's Body Design dvd.  I loved it so much I promptly bought his Hard Work Conditioning I and II  dvds.  I just love Patrick's positive energy...it helps me get through those tough workouts.  I have to confesss I never tried his dvds before because I thought they were all very complex and advanced. I have two left feet and no coordination and so the dance and step dvds are beyond me.  But his conditioning dvds really work for me. Of course, I do modify them somewhat (I'm 52 years old with creaky knees) but I love them. I feel a real sense of accomplishment every time I sweat through one of his workouts. Great workout and I highly recommend it for anyone who is up to the challenge.  I'll be looking for more Patrick conditioning dvds.",5,A great workout!!!!,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,886,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'total', 'body', 'combines', 'conditioning', 'cardio', 'finally', 'found', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'when', 'discovered', 'Patrick', 'Body', 'Design', 'dvd', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'promptly', 'bought', 'Hard', 'Work', 'Conditioning', 'II', 'dvds', 'just', 'love', 'Patrick', 'positive', 'energy', 'get', 'tough', 'workouts', 'have', 'confesss', 'never', 'tried', 'dvds', 'thought', 'were', 'very', 'complex', 'advanced', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'coordination', 'so', 'dance', 'step', 'dvds', 'are', 'conditioning', 'dvds', 'really', 'work', 'course', 'do', 'modify', 'somewhat', ""'m"", '52', 'years', 'old', 'creaky', 'knees', 'love', 'feel', 'real', 'sense', 'accomplishment', 'time', 'sweat', 'one', 'workouts', 'Great', 'workout', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'up', 'challenge', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'more', 'Patrick', 'conditioning', 'dvds']",Body Design Workout with Patrick Goudeau

As far as the workout itself, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not difficult (exercise moves wise).  I am not a fan of step aerobics because they tend to be a bit too complicated and I feel like I am wasting more time figuring out what is going on than actually getting workout.  A step is requred for this workout, but thankfully, the moves are not complicated at all.  The moves mostly consist of stepping on and off of the step, combined with some of the bar exercises.  I did not have a bar so I used weights, but I think the bar would have been a easier to use.The workout itself consists of about a five minute warmup.  The warmup was good in that it got my heartrate up, but this workout is very leg intensive so I felt I really needed a better leg stretch before going right into all the squats etc.  The entire workout is 85 minutes long, which is a bit long, but it is broken into sections so that you can pick and choose what you want to do if you don't want to do the entire 85 minute workout.  There is about a 10 minute ab section at the end that is very good.I really like Patrick as an instructor.  He is very energetic and you can just tell that he has a great postive attitude.  He does like to say ""oh my gosh"" alot and he does have a funny little laugh (throughout the workout).  I didn't get bored with this workout because Patrick does not stay on any one exercise for very long.  The workouts themselves consist of using the step but then also using the bar for sculpting. The ab section is about 10 minutes long and is very intense and effective.  Patrick also does a very good job of explaining all the moves.Overall this is a great cardio workout and not too complicated with fancy moves.  The only negatives I have is that it is very leg intensive (squats etc) with not much of a strech warmup.  I also felt like some of the routines could be a bit dangerous for a person's knees (ie one exercise involved sitting down on the step and then standing up from sitting position (knees in front of toes that every fitness instructor warns about).  But I felt that these moves could be easily modified so that my knees were not compromised.Overall, I really like this workout and Patrick!",4,Energetic fun workout,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2341,"['Cardio-wise', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'workout', 'Definitely', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'starting', 'get', 'shape', 'As', 'far', 'workout', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'difficult', 'exercise', 'moves', 'wise', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'step', 'aerobics', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'complicated', 'feel', 'am', 'wasting', 'more', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'actually', 'getting', 'workout', 'step', 'requred', 'workout', 'thankfully', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'complicated', 'moves', 'mostly', 'consist', 'stepping', 'step', 'combined', 'bar', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'bar', 'so', 'used', 'weights', 'think', 'bar', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'use.The', 'workout', 'five', 'minute', 'warmup', 'warmup', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'heartrate', 'up', 'workout', 'very', 'leg', 'intensive', 'felt', 'really', 'needed', 'better', 'leg', 'stretch', 'going', 'right', 'squats', 'etc', 'entire', 'workout', '85', 'minutes', 'long', 'bit', 'long', 'broken', 'sections', 'can', 'pick', 'choose', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'entire', '85', 'minute', 'workout', '10', 'minute', 'ab', 'section', 'end', 'very', 'good.I', 'really', 'like', 'Patrick', 'instructor', 'very', 'energetic', 'can', 'just', 'tell', 'great', 'postive', 'attitude', 'say', 'oh', 'gosh', 'alot', 'have', 'funny', 'little', 'laugh', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'workout', 'Patrick', 'not', 'stay', 'one', 'exercise', 'very', 'long', 'workouts', 'consist', 'using', 'step', 'then', 'also', 'using', 'bar', 'sculpting', 'ab', 'section', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'very', 'intense', 'effective', 'Patrick', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'moves.Overall', 'great', 'cardio', 'workout', 'not', 'too', 'complicated', 'fancy', 'moves', 'only', 'negatives', 'have', 'very', 'leg', 'intensive', 'squats', 'etc', 'not', 'much', 'strech', 'warmup', 'also', 'felt', 'routines', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'dangerous', 'person', 'knees', 'ie', 'one', 'exercise', 'involved', 'sitting', 'down', 'step', 'then', 'standing', 'up', 'sitting', 'position', 'knees', 'front', 'toes', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'felt', 'moves', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'modified', 'knees', 'were', 'not', 'compromised.Overall', 'really', 'workout', 'Patrick']",Body Design Workout with Patrick Goudeau

It's my third dvd of Patrick's and my third review of his stuff and it's really good and yet tough and enjoyable and challenging all at the same time.He uses very very high energy aerobic intervals with different muscle targeting body bar moves.  The entire workout is over an hour, but for about a full hour, you just won't stop.  It really is for advanced exercisers; not the faint of heart.  At the end of the workout, there is a tough core workout done on the floor.  You will need to have a body bar obviously, and a bench too, and do this a couple of times a week and you'll be fit and slim in no time.  He's an outgoing instructor so he makes it fun to do.

936737,A1RX0ZNCG2COZY,B000B6KRCY,wildblueamn,"[3, 3]","Time goes by fast doing this workout!  The workout can be done consequetively or you can select segments on your own.  Leg, triceps, chest, shoulders, and abs.  This is not a stand-curl weight-stand-curl weight rep workout.  Patrick emphasizes functional fitness where you implement somewhat every day moves and 2-body parts together in one move.  He ensures there are bursts of cardio between muscle sections (and there are multi sections in each segment)  The DVD reads 85min and I think thats about right on the money.My '4' is for the amount of leg work (more than 90 degree sit down squats, lunges, and other types of squats) which can be modified but there are many of them for sure! If you dont have the body bar (and I dont right now) you can use dumb bells but you may have to fumble a bit to get the right weight/ones between uses.  You need a step generally, but could do it all on the floor if you dont right now- work up to it.The accompanying women are well-dressed and actually look healthy- not stick thin.Patrick is funny, sometimes he gets off beat and plays it off (but his friends dont) and really enjoys what he's doing too!Enjoy!",4,Time goes by fast!,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,1151,"['Time', 'fast', 'doing', 'workout', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'consequetively', 'can', 'select', 'segments', 'own', 'Leg', 'triceps', 'chest', 'shoulders', 'abs', 'not', 'stand-curl', 'weight-stand-curl', 'weight', 'rep', 'workout', 'Patrick', 'functional', 'fitness', 'where', 'implement', 'somewhat', 'day', 'moves', '2-body', 'parts', 'together', 'one', 'move', 'are', 'bursts', 'cardio', 'muscle', 'sections', 'are', 'multi', 'sections', 'segment', 'DVD', '85min', 'think', 'thats', 'about', 'right', 'money.My', '4', 'amount', 'leg', 'work', 'more', '90', 'degree', 'sit', 'down', 'squats', 'lunges', 'other', 'types', 'squats', 'can', 'be', 'modified', 'are', 'many', 'sure', 'dont', 'have', 'body', 'bar', 'dont', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'use', 'dumb', 'bells', 'may', 'have', 'fumble', 'bit', 'get', 'right', 'weight/ones', 'uses', 'need', 'step', 'generally', 'could', 'do', 'floor', 'dont', 'right', 'now-', 'work', 'up', 'it.The', 'accompanying', 'women', 'are', 'well-dressed', 'actually', 'look', 'healthy-', 'not', 'stick', 'thin.Patrick', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'beat', 'off', 'friends', 'dont', 'really', 'what', 'doing', 'too', 'Enjoy']",Body Design Workout with Patrick Goudeau
