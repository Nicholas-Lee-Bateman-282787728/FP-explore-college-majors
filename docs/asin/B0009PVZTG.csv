910743,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0009PVZTG,David Bower,"[2, 2]","This movie tries to have something for everyone. Take one cup of ""The Exorcist"", add one cup of ""The Ghost Whisperer"", combine with two cups of ""Dante's Peak"" mix and bake and voila, you have ""Volcano Disaster."" If you're a dedicated disaster flick fan you'll probably find this one mildly entertaining.It takes reasonably predictable disaster film elements and combines them with unexplained supernatural elements which results in a less than usual predictability for the overall film. The movie was good enough that I watched the entire movie without giving up in despair. In all honesty I'll have to admit I give disaster films more latitude as I am a fan of disaster flicks.It will probably be a long time before I watch this one again and I would recommend you see it before you buy it. If you're an avid collector of disaster flicks you'll probably want to add this to your collection.",3,The Exorcist Meets the Ghost Whisperer Meets Volcano,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,891,"['movie', 'have', 'something', 'everyone', 'Take', 'one', 'cup', 'Exorcist', 'add', 'one', 'cup', 'Ghost', 'Whisperer', 'combine', 'two', 'cups', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'mix', 'bake', 'voila', 'have', 'Volcano', 'Disaster', ""'re"", 'dedicated', 'disaster', 'flick', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'one', 'mildly', 'entertaining.It', 'reasonably', 'predictable', 'disaster', 'film', 'elements', 'combines', 'unexplained', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'results', 'less', 'usual', 'predictability', 'overall', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'watched', 'entire', 'movie', 'giving', 'up', 'despair', 'honesty', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'give', 'disaster', 'films', 'more', 'latitude', 'am', 'fan', 'disaster', 'flicks.It', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'watch', 'one', 'again', 'would', 'recommend', 'see', 'buy', ""'re"", 'avid', 'collector', 'disaster', 'flicks', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'add', 'collection']",The Volcano Disaster

910745,A2ZUNJ2N8EANO3,B0009PVZTG,"Jim Liftin ""Jim""","[12, 16]","I expected this to be a disaster movie in the Irwin Allen tradition. Instead, I find a movie too bizarre for words. I taped this movie off the Sci-fi channel and I missed the first 10 minutes, and I ""came in"" as a man and his wife were helping victims (which I'm guessing) of a volcanic eruption in Italy. She is killed as he loses his grip on her hand hovering over a lava stream. He continues to see her in his dreams and is haunted by his memory of her. He then proceeds to the Italian province where she'd grown up (before moving to the states) in search of her records, which I'm guessing is for closure. Instead he encounters a mute young girl who has been declared as ""disturbed,"" who seems terrified of him -- and yet, seems drawn to him and pursues him -- and leaves him dead animals as ""gifts."" Everyone he meets warn him to stay away from her and the area where she is staying and offering no explanation. He follows her to a cave where, after experiencing a swarm of bats that drop dead out of the air as they reach him, he sees she has candles lit and she draws circles everywhere. And after chasing her to someplace else, he sees that she has drawn a detailed picture of his late wife. After demanding from her how she knows her, she flees. He is then told by others that after a traumatic event in her young life, she became mute, communicates only with the dead and feels a possible connection to the Devil. At this point, I turned off this movie and watched no more of it, even though I was at the half-way mark. What all this has to do with a volcano is beyond me. At least the movie ""Nature Unleashed: Earthquake"" had that Irwin Allen feel to it as it focused on the disaster; here I wasted about an hour out of my life, scratching my head after the first 45 minutes. My advice: avoid this movie and read a book.",1,Too bizarre for words,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,1831,"['expected', 'be', 'disaster', 'movie', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'tradition', 'Instead', 'find', 'movie', 'too', 'bizarre', 'words', 'taped', 'movie', 'Sci-fi', 'channel', 'missed', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'came', 'man', 'wife', 'were', 'helping', 'victims', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'Italy', 'killed', 'grip', 'hand', 'hovering', 'lava', 'stream', 'see', 'dreams', 'haunted', 'memory', 'then', 'Italian', 'province', 'where', ""'d"", 'grown', 'up', 'moving', 'states', 'search', 'records', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'closure', 'Instead', 'mute', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'declared', 'disturbed', 'who', 'terrified', 'yet', 'drawn', 'dead', 'animals', 'gifts', 'Everyone', 'warn', 'stay', 'away', 'area', 'where', 'staying', 'offering', 'explanation', 'cave', 'where', 'experiencing', 'swarm', 'bats', 'drop', 'dead', 'air', 'reach', 'candles', 'lit', 'circles', 'everywhere', 'chasing', 'someplace', 'else', 'drawn', 'detailed', 'picture', 'late', 'wife', 'demanding', 'how', 'then', 'told', 'others', 'traumatic', 'event', 'young', 'life', 'became', 'mute', 'only', 'dead', 'possible', 'connection', 'Devil', 'point', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'watched', 'more', 'even', 'was', 'half-way', 'mark', 'What', 'do', 'volcano', 'least', 'movie', 'Nature', 'Unleashed', 'Earthquake', 'had', 'Irwin', 'Allen', 'feel', 'focused', 'disaster', 'here', 'wasted', 'hour', 'life', 'scratching', 'head', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'advice', 'avoid', 'movie', 'read', 'book']",The Volcano Disaster

A young volcanologist (well played by Chris William Martin) loses his wife in a volcano eruption.  He had promised her on the day of her death that he would accompany her on a trip to her homeland in Italy, which he does after her untimely demise.  Once there, he meets a strange girl who has some kind of mystical connection to his dead wife.  The villagers think she's demented, but it seems she may have some kind of warning for the young widower.  The supernatural overtones help fill out the otherwise routine plotting, but the volcanic eruption at the end is well staged and involving.

So I was not misled, myself, by the title and cover when I saw them.  However, I do agree that volcanoes are a marginal even irelevant) part of this and it is definitely not a disaster film.  Kind of a strange supernatural themed weak love story, perhaps.  Not a terrible movie, but not really good either.  At least, not something I liked.  I didn't feel I could give it a '2' just because it was not to my liking because it wasn't flat out bad.  So I've given it a '3' since I think the atmosphere and somewhat clever idea behind it is better than a '2' (ignoring the general irrelevance of the volcano bits).",3,Misleading title and cover,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,707,"['did', 'know', 'movie', 'seeing', 'title', 'cover', 'actually', 'SciFi', 'channel', 'was', 'not', 'misled', 'title', 'cover', 'when', 'saw', 'However', 'do', 'agree', 'volcanoes', 'are', 'marginal', 'even', 'irelevant', 'part', 'definitely', 'not', 'disaster', 'film', 'Kind', 'strange', 'supernatural', 'themed', 'weak', 'love', 'story', 'perhaps', 'Not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'either', 'least', 'not', 'something', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'could', 'give', '2', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'liking', 'was', ""n't"", 'flat', 'out', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'given', '3', 'think', 'atmosphere', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'idea', 'better', '2', 'ignoring', 'general', 'irrelevance', 'volcano', 'bits']",The Volcano Disaster
