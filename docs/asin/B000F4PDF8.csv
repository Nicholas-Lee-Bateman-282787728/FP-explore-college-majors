982751,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F4PDF8,A Customer,"[8, 10]","Although the doggie picture Eight Below gets off to a bit of a slow start, the film is still a lovely evocation of survival against the odds and one man's determination to save his dearly beloved four legged friends. Eight Below is also an easy film to watch, thanks to the eye candy of Paul Walker and also to the splendors of its frozen and frosty scenery.The story is simple. The setting is a research base in Antarctica, where expedition guide Gerry Shepherd (Walker) learns he has to lead Dr. Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood) on a quest for a unique meteorite lodged somewhere in the rime along Mount Melbourne. But it's late January, and the ice is thin, and there are giant low-pressure systems brewing.Gerry determines that they'll have to take a sled led by his group of dogs. There's old guy Jack, ""best girl"" Maya, new boy Max, plus Dewey, Truman, Shadow, Shorty and Buck. They're all adorable and cute and totally resilient and the intrepid eight pull Gerry and Davis to their destination, where Davis finds his rock. However, while on their way back, Davis falls through the ice and breaks his leg.The group returns to base just as the entire population has the order to evacuate. Although Jerry wants to stay with the dogs, his boss won't let him, telling him that his frostbite is just too bad. The dogs are eventually left on their own to fend for themselves in this frozen underworld, whilst Gerry returns to the United States unable to shake his guilt over leaving the dogs.Obviously, the bulk of the film is showing us how these dogs survive for almost six months in the Antarctic winter. But the story also juxtaposes the dogs' plight with that of Jerry as he tries frantically to raise money so that he can return to Antarctica to save them.  Walker is nicely understated in this role - giving a gruff almost stern performance - and you really come to believe that he dearly loves his four-legged friends.At times, the movie is frustrating to watch, especially when Jerry is faced with the blind nonchalance of the base commanders and even his friends to the dogs' fate. No one is the slightest bit interested in taking a risk and returning to pick them up. The dogs are gorgeous and delightfully expressive and when director Frank Marshall focuses on this part of the story, the movie succeeds in bringing tears to one's eyes.Some of scenes centering on Jerry and his romance with a pilot (Moon Bloodgood), and his bantering with a co-worker (Jason Biggs) leaves a bit to be desired. The script is often trite and corny and somewhat clich&eacute;d but the gorgeous scenes with the dogs as they fight for survival and care for each other are marvelous, so expressively are they shot amidst the amazingly desolate and deathly environment.Their segments are really more engaging than the segments of human drama and more than make up for any of the film's apparent shortcomings.

982755,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000F4PDF8,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","It's hard to recall any recent Disney movie more compelling than this one. Frank Marshall has created an action film--without violence--but including tons of suspense and a great moral.The movie was inspired by a real historical event, although the credits don't give the details. According to Wikipedia (and linked sources), in 1958, three Japanese scientists (including a geologist) took an 800 kilometer Antarctic expedition with Sakhalin Huskies named ""Taro"" and ""Jiro."" From East Ongul Island, they reached their mountain destination, 400 kilometers away.But in ensuing foul weather, they lost their way back. The scientists set up camp and released Taro and Jiro, who made it to Ongul and returned with a rescue party in tow. Then severe weather forced the expedition's end, altogether. The scientists left for Japan aboard an icebreaker, without the dogs. A year later, they returned to East Ongul-- and were greeted by Taro and Jiro, who had survived. A 1983 hit Japanese movie memorialized the story.In Disney's fictionalized version, wilderness guide Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) lives with his eight well-trained dogs at the National Science Foundation's Weather Station during Antarctica's warm season, to lead scientists to remote areas ""nearby."" He fawns over his eight dogs (six huskies, two malamutes), each featuring an almost-human personality.The dog-in-training, Max, and lead dog, Maya, give command performances, but about-to-retire Old Jack, Shadow, the rambunctious Buck, Dewey and Truman also have remarkable characteristics, of both physical and behavioral varieties. Also hanging out in the frozen South is Shepard's pal, cartographer Cooper (Jason Biggs), who fears the dogs and hates to fly.One crisp, sunny morning, in flies pilot Katie (Moon Bloodgood), Shepard's sometime girlfriend, carrying UCLA Professor McLaren (Bruce Greenwood) along with replenishments of station supplies. McLaren wants to find a rare meteorite in a mountainous region impassible by snowmobiles, which Shepard hasn't checked lately for safety. But the base commander insists that Jerry head out with McLaren by dog sled. Like the Japanese, these fictional guys reach their mountain-top destination, crossing a perilous glacier to get there.But the night before Shepard and McLaren plan to search for the meteorite, Katie radios them to head back at once, to avoid a giant storm, even worse than most Antarctica blows. Despite Shepard's desire to leave immediately, McLaren talks him into staying half the next day. They actually find a piece of the rock in question, but Shepard and McLaren run into big trouble as the storm descends on their return: McLaren spills over a cliff and through the ice below, suffering a broken leg and hypothermia. The dogs save McLaren, but Shepard's fingers are severely frostbitten when they finally reach the Weather Station.Then, the McMurdo base radios that Weather Station must be abandoned. The ferocity of the storm requires that all stations clear out early for the coming winter. Katie's plane can hold all hands, but not the dogs. She promises to come back for them.The rest of the story belongs to the dogs, whom Shepard had left chained outside Weather Station, in expectation of their swift retrieval. The director cuts in scenes of Shepard stressing over the dogs' welfare.But their camaraderie in their impossible predicament, and the ways in which most ultimately survive is what drives this marvelous tale. The dogs hunt for one another, nurse one another, feed one another, rescue one another. To find out how, and to experience the incredible scenery and cinematography, take your kids (or borrow some) to see this instant classic.--Alyssa A.

982765,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B000F4PDF8,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[5, 8]","I enjoyed ""Eight Below"" a great deal, and would recommend it for 'Family Viewing Night' wholeheartedly, as long as the parents are prepared to discuss frostbite, hypothermia, and death (not intended as a 'spoiler', but all the dogs don't survive). The dogs are simply magnificent, brave, resourceful, and, honestly, more trustworthy than the humans in the film!Several reviewers have pointed out, correctly, that no provisions or protection is provided for the dogs, during the emergency evacuation that begins their ordeal. The explanation, ""Someone will be right back for them"", is pretty lame, considering what the team already knew of the impending weather conditions. Indeed, Paul Walker even chains them more tightly, to prevent their getting free (which, ultimately, creates the first tragedy). While I'll concede that there was no room on the plane for the dogs, I'd have anticipated the worst, not the best, as we're talking Antarctica, and done my utmost to provide a 'survival window' for them (leaving food, even leaving a hut open and accessible, if necessary), even with an 'immediate' return planned. That's what preparation is all about (although there wouldn't have been a movie, if the humans had 'done the right thing').There was criticism that Walker and Company, upon finally reaching the surviving (and very hungry) dogs, didn't feed them, but just loaded them up, and left...I'm sure the animals were fed, in the vehicle; it was a 'movie' decision to end the film on the 'high' note of the rescue...I was more disturbed by how flippantly he said that Maya would be fine, considering she had been badly bitten by the leopard seal, and could possibly lose a leg. Again, I understand that, because of the film's length, everything had to be tied up, as neatly and quickly as possible, but that dog needed medical attention, pronto!I know that these comments may seem odd for a film I have recommended for the whole family, but I want to prepare you for questions that may come up, while you watch the film.

Okay, now don't you feel better about admitting that?Disney knows what sells. It's either action/adventure (Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest) or fuzzy animal stories (Eight Below). And here we get a bit of both. The action takes place in the Antarctic (although the film itself was never shot there) and focuses on eight dogs left behind at an outlying station for months and months. Their owner, Jerry Shepherd (Paul Walker, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS) is forced to leave his mushing team behind after an accident and a freak snow storm. Months pass and he's still unable to return to the base and he soon realizes the dogs must be dead. But he wants to return and give them a proper burial. The film wanders back and forth between Jerry and the dogs as we watch Jerry fight to return to them while witnessing the dogs break free of their chained collars and survive in one of the most desolate climates the world has to offer. But can all of them survive? Some are old and others inexperienced. Jerry won't realize how resilient his team is until his return.Based on a true story, Disney has ""Disneyfied"" the events, of course. In the original Japanese film based on actual facts (titled Nanyoku Monogatari), only two of the fifteen dogs survived. But we can't have that in a Disney film now can we?The thing that bugs me most about the movie isn't the fact that Disney changed the death-to-survival ratio but that they felt the need to change it from a Japanese telling to an American one. Why? Are we afraid to expose our children to other cultures? Or do we think they won't understand various cultural differences?Even though I'm bothered about that, I found the film heartwarming (&lt;sarcastic> big surprise) and well filmed. The story did feel a bit forced, though, especially when its makers gave human qualities to the dogs (altruism, bravery, etc.).But still, it's a great way to draw your audience into the story, and is really the only way to make the movie watcher empathize with nonhuman characters.",3,A Disneyfied Flick But Still A Tear-Jerker,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,2123,"['Raise', 'hand', 'cried', 'when', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'got', 'shot', 'Come', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'shy', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'Okay', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'better', 'admitting', 'Disney', 'what', 'action/adventure', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Chest', 'fuzzy', 'animal', 'stories', 'Eight', 'Below', 'here', 'get', 'bit', 'action', 'place', 'Antarctic', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'shot', 'there', 'eight', 'dogs', 'left', 'behind', 'outlying', 'station', 'months', 'months', 'Their', 'owner', 'Jerry', 'Shepherd', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'THE', 'FAST', 'AND', 'THE', 'FURIOUS', 'forced', 'leave', 'mushing', 'team', 'accident', 'freak', 'snow', 'storm', 'Months', 'pass', 'still', 'unable', 'return', 'base', 'soon', 'dogs', 'must', 'be', 'dead', 'return', 'give', 'proper', 'burial', 'film', 'wanders', 'back', 'forth', 'Jerry', 'dogs', 'watch', 'Jerry', 'fight', 'return', 'witnessing', 'dogs', 'break', 'free', 'chained', 'collars', 'survive', 'one', 'most', 'desolate', 'climates', 'world', 'offer', 'can', 'survive', 'are', 'old', 'others', 'inexperienced', 'Jerry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'resilient', 'team', 'return.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Disney', 'Disneyfied', 'events', 'course', 'original', 'Japanese', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'facts', 'titled', 'Nanyoku', 'Monogatari', 'only', 'two', 'fifteen', 'dogs', 'survived', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Disney', 'film', 'now', 'can', 'thing', 'most', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Disney', 'changed', 'death-to-survival', 'ratio', 'felt', 'need', 'change', 'Japanese', 'telling', 'American', 'one', 'Why', 'Are', 'afraid', 'expose', 'children', 'other', 'cultures', 'do', 'think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'various', 'cultural', 'differences', 'Even', ""'m"", 'bothered', 'found', 'film', 'heartwarming', 'lt', 'sarcastic', '>', 'big', 'surprise', 'well', 'filmed', 'story', 'did', 'feel', 'bit', 'forced', 'though', 'especially', 'when', 'makers', 'gave', 'human', 'qualities', 'dogs', 'altruism', 'bravery', 'etc', '.But', 'still', 'great', 'way', 'draw', 'audience', 'story', 'really', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'watcher', 'empathize', 'nonhuman', 'characters']",N/A

It is true they are often much kinder than the real world, but I prefer their outlook. This story is loosely based on a true story of a 1958 Japanese expedition and a movie, Nanyoku Monogatari released as Antarctica in the US, made in 1985. It is about the two Japanese scientist and their sled dogs. In the true story the dogs are actually left behind and and only a couple survive for sure out of 15, several died and so it is fairly certain the rest did not survive. An exceptionally emotional film with incredible music. In the original movie the two scientist are both heart broken as they have an attachment to the dogs and would have risked their lifes to save them had they been allowed. Disney's take on this story is to in fact allow a rescue with some slight changes on the people involved and they have the dogs make a good deal of the survival journey. Be aware not all the dogs will make it in this Disney movie. Disney has always been good at animal movies and this one is one of the best I have ever seen. Be prepared though as this movie is more closely true to life like ""Old Yeller"" or the original ""Incredible Journey"" which show that nature can be cruel sometimes. If you enjoy Disney animal movies you should love it, but it may be to intense for small children. If I have a slight complaint it is they could have reduced the time of what was happening with the people back in civilization while the dogs were on their own. I would have loved to seen more of the dogs interaction during that time. The demise of two is poignant and they have the good fortune to be with their fellow dogs to watch over them. Although the guide will beat himself up about it, it teaches us we can't always be there for our loved ones, which includes animals, as much as we may like so just be good to them when you can. Things go wrong which we have no control over and there is no point in blaming yourself. I lost two cats that died to young but one was bitten by a snake and the other got cancer. Most of us know what it is like to lose a pet. This movie makes me remember why I seriously considered getting a Husky as a young man. Just remember as I did, dogs deserve and require a good deal more time than other pets. I ended up passing because I lived in an apartment in the city and my college classes and part-time job would not have allowed enough time for a dogs care. Anyone that likes animals will be glad they see it. I recommend it and that you check out ""Duma"" too.

A love letter to dogs starring Paul Walker, how could I not like it? At times it gave me reason to dislike it, it was too long, too polished, too corny, but who cares when a movie is this much fun. Of course as a dog lover anytime dogs show up on screen I become reluctant. Nothing can stir up my emotions like killing off a dog, and filmmakers and studios know this all too well. This being a Disney film made me all the more reluctant as you cannot walk into a Disney movie and not expect them to manipulate your emotions. That said, this film nearly ripped my heart out.  The dogs are amazing and the characters are believable (with the exception of the Jason Biggs character who was overdrawn and overacted). Movies don't exist in a bubble, so I bring my love of dogs to this movie just as I bring my political beliefs with me when I go to see ""Why We Fight."" So when these dogs are abandoned in the middle of Antarctica during a wicked storm I can't but help imagine my dog in that horrible situation. Obviously, if a man left his girlfriend in the middle of nowhere for 200 days we would have a significantly different movie on our hands, but dogs are different creatures than women. Dogs will be loyal to you until the day they die simply for the cost of a place to sleep and dried dog food (or in my dog's case gummi bears), girls. . .not so much. Dogs are so loyal they don't mind being left for dead in Antarctica, and this film uses this fact to its advantage. This film has many strong points, but the highlight to me was the battle with the seal over the right to eat the killer whale. It is a superb scene that mixes survival action was straight up horror all involving characters we actually care about, how many films are so lucky? I also enjoyed the fact that its morality was not black and white. Money is not seen as inherently good or evil, but it does play a role in this story, just as it plays a role in every story. Paul Walker's character is determined to get his dogs, but he never delves into maniacal behavior simply to oversimplify his devotion to the audience. Yes, the movie does also have its faults.  The scene in which all the dogs break free at once was way too much for my critical sensibilities,  as was the scene where the dogs were seen chasing the Northern Lights (or whatever they were). But for every problem there was something there to redeem it, such as the minor joke involving the Fresca which was unexpected and funny. This film is a great time and packs a real punch for anybody who finds their dogs more important than their hands.

982788,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000F4PDF8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","Eight Below is an absolutely fantastic film, but those who, like me, are hypersensitive animal lovers should know up front that this is a tear-jerker.  You've got the veritable wringer going both ways here; I cried out of grief, I cried out of joy, and - well, I'm just glad I watched this movie by myself.  The twelve minutes of ending credits actually make sense - theatre goers might have needed that much time to get themselves settled so they could get up and leave.  (And don't go thinking twelve minutes of credits means the movie is short, as it runs close to two hours before it gets to those end credits.)  The whole cast and crew really are fantastic - this couldn't have been an easy film to make.  They didn't actually film in Antarctica, of course, but all these guys still endured some incredibly harsh conditions (in Norway, Greenland, and Canada) during the shoot.  Of course, as good as the human actors are, the dogs - six Siberian Huskeys and two malamutes - are the heart and soul of this movie.  De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Al Pacino - these are all great actors, but there's no greater actor than a truly talented canine actor.  I was extremely happy to see the canine actors' actual names appear in the credits - but they really should have earned top billing (although, admittedly, it's hard to fit 16 names - two dogs portrayed each canine character - in a marquee).  In this film, you'll witness some of the most incredibly selfless acts imaginable, not to mention ample proof that dogs absolutely know, feel, and understand a vast variety of emotions.Here's the deal.  Thanks to a bad early winter storm and a scientist who just had to find his precious little Mercury rock, guide Jerry Shepherd (Paul Walker) is forced to abandon his team of beloved sled dogs as his Antarctic research station is evacuated post-haste.  His friend and potential love interest Katie (Moon Bloodgood) promises to fly right back and get them, so Jerry secures their collars, leaving them securely bound to a chain out in the snow.  When Katie is unable to return, the dogs are basically left to die a sure and awful death.  Jerry, as you would expect, is in anguish over the dogs' fate, blaming himself (when he should have been blaming Katie) for the tragedy.  Desperate to get back to them, he tries to raise money from anyone and everyone, including the scientist who would be perpetually frozen under the Antarctic ice were it not for those dogs.Months pass as we watch the dogs struggle to survive on their own in the most inhospitable of conditions.  Freeing themselves from their chains is just the first of many obstacles the dogs face.  As you can imagine, finding food and staying warm are also extremely difficult - and they face some external threats, as well.  There are some incredibly tragic moments the sensitive viewer will have to endure, one of which is going to haunt me for some time, but the bond between these dogs is phenomenal, and it is fascinating to watch the hierarchy of this group change over time.  These poor creatures go through so much together, and I'm telling you that you will just melt in the baby blue eyes of young Max as he epitomizes the kind of humanity that we humans can no longer call our own.Obviously, I think this is a terrific film, and an especially touching family film, but I also think parents should consider whether or not they want their youngsters to watch it.  There are some real tragedies in this film, scenes that had me crying like a baby, and this film might be somewhat traumatic in spots to the sensitive child.  These scenes aren't strung out or sensationalized, but they are there.  Any good parent, though, should know his/her child well enough to know how he/she might react to this kind of thing.  I hope legions of people will watch Eight Below, though, as it is an exceedingly touching film.",5,Both heartbreaking and heartwarming -- and utterly superb,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3871,"['Eight', 'Below', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'hypersensitive', 'animal', 'lovers', 'should', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'tear-jerker', ""'ve"", 'got', 'veritable', 'wringer', 'going', 'ways', 'here', 'cried', 'grief', 'cried', 'joy', 'well', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'watched', 'movie', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'ending', 'credits', 'actually', 'make', 'sense', 'theatre', 'goers', 'might', 'have', 'needed', 'much', 'time', 'get', 'settled', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'up', 'leave', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'thinking', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'credits', 'movie', 'short', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'end', 'credits', 'whole', 'cast', 'crew', 'really', 'are', 'fantastic', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'film', 'make', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'film', 'Antarctica', 'course', 'guys', 'still', 'endured', 'incredibly', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'Norway', 'Greenland', 'Canada', 'shoot', 'course', 'as', 'good', 'human', 'actors', 'are', 'dogs', 'six', 'Siberian', 'Huskeys', 'two', 'malamutes', 'are', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'De', 'Niro', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'greater', 'actor', 'truly', 'talented', 'canine', 'actor', 'was', 'extremely', 'happy', 'see', 'canine', 'actors', 'actual', 'names', 'appear', 'credits', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'top', 'billing', 'admittedly', 'hard', 'fit', '16', 'names', 'two', 'dogs', 'portrayed', 'canine', 'character', 'marquee', 'film', ""'ll"", 'witness', 'most', 'incredibly', 'selfless', 'acts', 'imaginable', 'not', 'mention', 'ample', 'proof', 'absolutely', 'know', 'feel', 'understand', 'vast', 'variety', 'emotions.Here', 'deal', 'Thanks', 'bad', 'early', 'winter', 'storm', 'scientist', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'find', 'precious', 'little', 'Mercury', 'rock', 'guide', 'Jerry', 'Shepherd', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'forced', 'abandon', 'team', 'beloved', 'sled', 'dogs', 'Antarctic', 'research', 'station', 'evacuated', 'post-haste', 'friend', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Katie', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'fly', 'right', 'back', 'get', 'so', 'Jerry', 'collars', 'leaving', 'securely', 'bound', 'chain', 'out', 'snow', 'When', 'Katie', 'unable', 'return', 'dogs', 'are', 'basically', 'left', 'die', 'sure', 'awful', 'death', 'Jerry', 'would', 'expect', 'anguish', 'dogs', 'fate', 'blaming', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'blaming', 'Katie', 'tragedy', 'Desperate', 'get', 'back', 'raise', 'money', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'including', 'scientist', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'perpetually', 'frozen', 'Antarctic', 'ice', 'were', 'not', 'dogs.Months', 'pass', 'watch', 'dogs', 'struggle', 'survive', 'own', 'most', 'inhospitable', 'conditions', 'Freeing', 'chains', 'just', 'first', 'many', 'obstacles', 'dogs', 'face', 'can', 'imagine', 'finding', 'food', 'staying', 'warm', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'face', 'external', 'threats', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'incredibly', 'tragic', 'moments', 'sensitive', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'endure', 'one', 'going', 'haunt', 'time', 'bond', 'dogs', 'phenomenal', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'hierarchy', 'group', 'change', 'time', 'poor', 'creatures', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'together', ""'m"", 'telling', 'will', 'just', 'melt', 'baby', 'blue', 'eyes', 'young', 'Max', 'kind', 'humanity', 'humans', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'call', 'own.Obviously', 'think', 'terrific', 'film', 'especially', 'touching', 'family', 'film', 'also', 'think', 'parents', 'should', 'consider', 'not', 'want', 'youngsters', 'watch', 'are', 'real', 'tragedies', 'film', 'scenes', 'had', 'crying', 'baby', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'traumatic', 'spots', 'sensitive', 'child', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'strung', 'out', 'sensationalized', 'are', 'there', 'Any', 'good', 'parent', 'should', 'know', 'his/her', 'child', 'well', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'he/she', 'might', 'react', 'kind', 'thing', 'hope', 'legions', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'Eight', 'Below', 'though', 'exceedingly', 'touching', 'film']",N/A

982792,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000F4PDF8,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[2, 7]","Disney has perfected the animal-in-peril genre where one or more creatures battle for survival in absence of the humans who are supposed to protect them.  A sled dog team of eight huskies is left alone in Antarctica when their owner, young scientist and team trainer Jerry (Paul Walker), must evacuate, in the midst of a severe storm, with his colleagues and the seriously injured professor who has funded the trip.  Jerry intends to return the next day to rescue the dog team; however, the snowstorm and impending winter cancels all expeditions to Antarctica until the following spring.  Jerry is haunted by the knowledge that the dogs have probably died while secured in their collars and chains.  Of course, the dogs are more resourceful than the humans expect, and the film chronicles their survival as well as Jerry's determined attempts to find a way to return despite the moratorium on Antarctic travel.Thankfully, the dogs are not given voices, although their personalities become apparent through live action.  While nothing truly surprising occurs in this standard Disney fare, the situation is tense enough to keep the viewer's interest.  Paul Walker makes for a good, though not entirely memorable, human protagonist while Moon Bloodgood, as flight pilot Kate, provides a likeable love interest.  Bruce Greenwood is perhaps the most convincing as the funding scientist Dr. McClaren.Parents of young children should be forewarned that not all the dogs survive and that there is a particularly intense scene with a ferocious seal.

982802,A34CQFE2ZR3GCO,B000F4PDF8,"Dr Lim Michael ""thetravellinggourmet""","[2, 4]","MOIST tears of joy and inspiration flowed from my eyes at the end of this movie. This is a classic to be. A remake like 'The Magnificent 7' was; this is a remake of the Japanese movie with the same storyline. The star is the dog sled guide Paul Walker while the bad guy turned good is the ambitious scientist who is willing to take chances for what he believes in. Unfortunately, the bad scientist doesn't care if he risks others' lives or the 8 wonderful dogs who make up the sled team. Risks are OK especially when it is at others' expense and cost. His recklessness and foolish behaviour has serious consequences and compels the guide and his super dogs have to save him multiple times at great danger to themselves. Is he grateful? No way Jose! He is a blamer type and even blames the guide for giving in to his boss, and agreeing to bring him to where he wants to find a meteorite from Mercury for his own personal advancement and glory. ""If you thought it was too dangerous you should not have backed down!"" he says vehemently. Some gratitude when the courageous sled dog has so cleverly put a safety rope over his head when they are all on thin ice - literally. Later, the scientist jeopardises the mission again and yes, 'Nice Guy' Walker, the guide, is too weak and gives in to the 'mad' scientist's manipulative request for more time to search for his Mercury rock despite the pending huge and hazardous blizzard. Yes, sometimes weak and too accomodating leaders have no place in remote areas of the world leading life and death missions. Walker would never make it in the Special Forces. If he did, brave men would die because of his weakness and poor decison making under stress. Walker pays for his 'Mr. Nice Guy' act with frost bitten fingers and frostbitten face and nose. The scientist gets a broken leg which heals (I would have liked to see him lose it - literally). The guide's old flame with an uncanny resemblance to Hawaiian born star Tia Carera tricks him in the typical female way by saying she'll go back for the dogs. She doesn't. As kids, how many of us remember Mom saying, ""We'll see the movie tomorrow"". We never saw the movie the next day, did we? The dogs are abandoned at the station to die in the freezing cold of the Antarctic. It reminded me of real life events like the hasty Evac from VN in 1975. Classified data was not properly destroyed so people who supported the US ended up abandoned, to die slowly in re-education camps. Here, there is a happy ending. The hero perseveres against all odds and the bad scientist goes good after seeing his son's card with the words:  'to the heroes - the dogs who saved my dad' As Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet I love dogs and cats too, and anyone who loves animals will fall in love with this movie. It is that good. The rescue mission succeeds. Paul Walker is the SNAG (Sensitive New Age Guy) personified. Ladies with strong maternal instincts will not be able to stop themselves falling in love with him. Please see this movie with your kids and family. I don't want to give away too much, but the happy ending will touch your heart...and bring tears of joy to your eyes, unless you have no feelings at all. Who dares wins!

982807,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B000F4PDF8,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 3]","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSTITLE: Eight BelowRELEASE DATE: 2006PLOT: Inspired by a true story: during a horrific snow storm in Antarctica, Jerry Shepard is forced to leave his eight snow dogs behind due to no room for the trip back home. So now Shepard does all he can to rescue the worthy canines who try to survive in the southern most part of the Earth. 10/10CHARACTERS/PERFORMANCES: Paul Walker as ""Shepard"" and Bruce Greenwood as ""McClaren"" are outstanding, while Jason Biggs as ""Cooper"" can be a bit of an irritant sometimes as the comedic sidekick. Having two of the dogs die wasn't really that heartbreaking to me, but maybe it was because of the way it was filmed. 8/10THE SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: Dialogue is never over-exaggerated, but a few parts are still sappy. 8/10DIRECTOR: Frank Marshall did a splendid job with avoiding any over-the-top mumbo jumbo. However, his handling of conflicts on screen and crafts of character development needed some work. Not to say that it was all ridiculous, but that some scenes involving suspense between characters and other characters, or characters and Mother Nature, weren't very strong. The dog trainers for this film were excellent in showing and telling the dogs what to do. 8/10PACING: The film drags during the second half, when Shepard is away from Antarctica. The canines' journey makes up for it, though. 9/10CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenes that were shot on location are particularly beautiful. All the snow and ice and frozen water make me want to visit Antarctica (even though the film was shot in Greenland, Norway, and Canada instead of in Antarctica). 10/10SETS AND COSTUMES: Good; nothing special but still good. 10/10MUSIC: Much of the music sounded too melodramatic. I didn't like it that much. 5/10VISUAL EFFECTS: The leopard seal swimming underwater is probably the only computer-generated creature that looks very unrealistic. Otherwise, all the other computer-generated shots and figures are spectacular. 9/10DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: The deleted scenes are wonderful to look at, and the Making-of documentary is not good but not enough to grab the viewer's attention. 8/10CONCLUSION: ""Eight Below"" is very entertaining for people of all ages. Just don't judge it by its irritating comedy or slow progress toward the climax and resolution.OVERALL GRADE: 8.5/10",4,"""Payback's a Dish Better Served Cold.""",1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2334,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'MAJOR', 'SPOILERSTITLE', 'Eight', 'BelowRELEASE', 'DATE', '2006PLOT', 'Inspired', 'true', 'story', 'horrific', 'snow', 'storm', 'Antarctica', 'Jerry', 'Shepard', 'forced', 'leave', 'eight', 'snow', 'dogs', 'due', 'room', 'trip', 'back', 'home', 'So', 'now', 'Shepard', 'can', 'rescue', 'worthy', 'canines', 'who', 'try', 'survive', 'southern', 'most', 'part', 'Earth', '10/10CHARACTERS/PERFORMANCES', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Shepard', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'McClaren', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Cooper', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'irritant', 'sometimes', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'Having', 'two', 'dogs', 'die', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'heartbreaking', 'maybe', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', '8/10THE', 'SCRIPT/DIALOGUE', 'Dialogue', 'never', 'over-exaggerated', 'few', 'parts', 'are', 'still', 'sappy', '8/10DIRECTOR', 'Frank', 'Marshall', 'did', 'splendid', 'job', 'avoiding', 'over-the-top', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'However', 'handling', 'conflicts', 'screen', 'crafts', 'character', 'development', 'needed', 'work', 'Not', 'say', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'involving', 'suspense', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'characters', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'strong', 'dog', 'trainers', 'film', 'were', 'excellent', 'showing', 'telling', 'dogs', 'what', 'do', '8/10PACING', 'film', 'drags', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'Shepard', 'away', 'Antarctica', 'canines', 'journey', 'up', 'though', '9/10CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'location', 'are', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'snow', 'ice', 'frozen', 'water', 'make', 'want', 'visit', 'Antarctica', 'even', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Greenland', 'Norway', 'Canada', 'instead', 'Antarctica', '10/10SETS', 'COSTUMES', 'Good', 'nothing', 'special', 'still', 'good', '10/10MUSIC', 'Much', 'music', 'sounded', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'that', 'much', '5/10VISUAL', 'EFFECTS', 'leopard', 'seal', 'swimming', 'underwater', 'probably', 'only', 'computer-generated', 'creature', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'Otherwise', 'other', 'computer-generated', 'shots', 'figures', 'are', 'spectacular', '9/10DVD', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'look', 'Making-of', 'documentary', 'not', 'good', 'not', 'enough', 'grab', 'viewer', 'attention', '8/10CONCLUSION', 'Eight', 'Below', 'very', 'entertaining', 'people', 'ages', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'irritating', 'comedy', 'slow', 'progress', 'climax', 'resolution.OVERALL', 'GRADE', '8.5/10']",N/A

982815,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000F4PDF8,Grady Harp,"[21, 24]","EIGHT BELOW is a satisfying film on every level: the story is excellent (based on fact), the script is good, the direction by Frank Marshall is tight and fast paced for a two hour film, the scenery is spectacular and the cast is committed and well chosen. But the real stars of this film are the eight wondrous dogs who for much of the film carry the entire story of being on their own in the Antarctica winter for five plus months - and for the most part surviving through bonding and obvious devotion to each other.  They are splendid - beautiful to watch in action and touching to observe in their interaction.  But the dogs alone could not have made this happen without the other true stars of the picture - the dog trainers.  They deserve mention, so here they are: Michael Alexander and Sally Jo Sousa are the main trainers and are well supported by Tammy Blackburn, Tracy Gardhouse, Thomas L. Gunderson, Rowan Harland, Trish Judd, Dea Valentin Kristensen, Grace McLeod, Scott Rowe, Andrew Simpson, Cherie Smith and Tim Williams.  There!  The kudos go to them and their names are buried in the credits.The story is one of dedication and devotion of a group of sledders in the Antarctica who take researchers, such as Doctor McLaren (Bruce Greenwood) who is looking for a meteorite from Mercury, on their missions.  The main dog lover and trainer is Jerry (Paul Walker in one of his best performances) and he is assisted by Katie (Moon Bloodgood) and Coop (Jason Biggs).  When Jerry is out with the eight dogs taking Doctor McLaren to fine his meteorite, a major storm arises and the dogs and the two men barely make it back to the station, McLaren suffering a broken leg and saved by the bravery of the dogs and Jerry.  The crew must evacuate and Jerry insists the dogs be taken out with them, but he is promised that the pilot Katie will return for them, a deed which goes unkept because of the severe weather.  The dogs are left to fend for themselves and Jerry is heartbroken, making every feasible attempt to rescue them.  By films ends we have witnessed the miracle of survival of the dogs and a demonstration of the profound bonding between man and animal.This film may seem slight from the photo on the DVD, but it is one of those family oriented films that breaks barriers and delivers on a grand scale some very important emotional content. The cast is excellent (the dogs of course being the main characters).  The production values are superb except for a strangely mawkish score by Mark Isham.  Well worth your time and attention.

Incredibly well trained, they DO steal the movie, as everyone has said. In your wildest dreams, you cannot imagine the depth of the devotion they exhibit when told to ""wait"" by their master, ""that he will return for them"". They end up waiting in the most severe conditions for almost six months.The interesting thing to me is that the devotion they display is just as profoundly reflected by their trainer, guide ""Jerry"".This movie has a terrific sweep to the photography as well. It is supposedly set in Antarctica, but the sets were a variety of places which are just darn COLD looking. It offers appealing, sincere acting by the lead, Paul Walker, in particular, who is especially believable as the kind of outdoorsy person who WOULD be a sled dog guide and who displays incredible experience and resourcefulness when taking scientists and researchers to far flung areas which require dog teams and his specific abilities.Jerry manages to save the life of a scientist who won't leave without a certain piece of meteorite and, although an intelligent man, ""makes bad choices"" because he doesn't know the 'hood. Don't people like that drive you nuts? One of the dogs, the lead female, Maya, literally saves his life. This becomes a key aspect in the plot later.When everyone has to leave  base camp because of bad weather conditions without the dogs the situation suddenly goes from bad to worse. Guide Jerry Shepherd (note his last name) refuses to give up on his dog team however, and the movie cuts from shots of people to shots the dogs, waiting and surviving and, strangely, communicating with each other as well, utilizing their team abilities to the maximum.I felt as if there was a reality to their faith in their master.If you love animal movies, give this one a try.

982834,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000F4PDF8,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[4, 6]","This great movie, based on actual events, chronicles the lives of eight sled dogs and their struggle to survive in the Antarctic wilderness.  Paul Walker stars as Jerry Shepherd, a sled dog guide based in Antarctica. Bruce Greenwood stars as Dr. Davis McClaren, a University professor who has come to Antarctica to search for a meteorite from the planet Mercury which landed in the vicinity of Jerry's camp.  The only way to reach the meteorite impact area is by sled dog team.  This is where Jerry and his group of dogs comes in.Despite the lateness of the season, Jerry and Dr. McClaren head off in search of the meteorite.  While en route, Jerry and Dr. McClaren are radioed by Katie (Moon Bloodgood) that a severe storm is headed in their direction.  Jerry wants to turn around immediately, but Dr. McClaren persuades him to continue on just a little while longer.  Their persistance pays off, as they are able to locate the meteorite.  Satisfied, the two begin to head back to camp, but Dr. McClaren suffers a harrowing accident which leaves him with a broken leg.  He wouldn't have survived if not for the efforts of Jerry and his dogs.  Facing rapidly diminishing weather conditions, the group makes it back to the compound safely, only to find that the compound is being evacuated.  The personnel all board a plane to leave, but Jerry wants to stay with the dogs, as there is no room for them on the plane.  Eventually, he's talked out of it by Katie, and the dogs are chained up with the promise that the plane will be back for them immediately after dropping off the passengers.  However, once at the aid station, the base commander informs Jerry that it will be impossible to go back to get the dogs.  This decision sets in motion an odyssey that will last for six monts and transpire several continents.  The dogs are alone and must fend for themselves.For Jerry, the decision to leave the dogs is agonizing.  He blames himself for not staying with them, and he tries every conceivable manner to get back to them, including fund raisers and appealing to the news media.  All of these efforts lead no where.  Jerry decides to appeal to his friend Dr. McClaren for help.  Dr. McClaren suggests that Jerry has done everything possible, and must accept that rescue is impossible.  Meanwhile, the dogs have been surviving on birds and trying to stay together.  Finally, Dr. McClaren realizes that he still has grant money left from his meteorite funding, so he, Jerry, Katie, and Cooper (Jason Biggs) set out for Antarctica and the dogs.  Will they arrive in time, or will the dogs have succumbed to the harsh conditions by now?This is a very uplifting movie.  The acting is first-rate and the story is fantastic.  The viewer immediately forms a bond with the dogs as they are forced to struggle to survive, and there are a couple of tear-jerking moments along the way.  Driven by unwavering bonds of friendship, enormous belief in one another, and tremendous courage, Jerry and the dogs make an incredible journey to reunite with each other.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  It is appropriate for both children and adults, and you'll find yourself cheering for the dogs and encouraging Jerry.

Based on a real case where dogs were left at a Japanese base on the coast this version takes far too many liberties. Dealing with just the most obvious: What would the dogs have eaten for 6 months? There is an Emperor penguin colony at Coulman Island up the coast from Mount Melbourne but except for the odd Weddell seal no other living creatures come ashore in the Antarctic winter. from May to August it is constantly dark, (we are shown broad daylight in June!!), and the dogs could not have caught live food. Temperatures fall to 60 below along the coast with ferocious winds. They might have found a dead orca as depicted but for it to have been washed ashore in this way is highly improbable. Leopard seals usually feed on other seals and penguins and all penguins except the emperors have long since gone to sea. In the early part of the film the scientist and his carer move over dangerous ice without roping up - fatal! The scientist and the map maker are just too idiotic and weak to be credible and the cute young female super pilot seems to be licenced for twin otters, helicopters and can land uninvited on ice breakers at sea in the Southern Ocean! Must be on loan from the Navy Seals! They steal a snow mobile from the Terra Nova Italian base in the area etc. etc. The dogs were tremendous but spare us the humans and the incompetent story line. To imply that the summer season ends in late January / early February is nonsense. In fact the twin otters are usually the last to either fly out up through the peninsula to Chile or go into winter storage in April / May. They can indeed land on a pin, I have made a blind landing on an icefield in a whiteout just using an altimeter so they could easily have gone back for the dogs - yes it is just a story but at least make it a bit more believable!

It starred Paul Walker, who, in my opinion, sucks the life out of any role he's handed.  I figured that this movie would play up the cuteness of the dogs for the kids and the looks of Walker for the moms in the crowd.I was wrong.This is a very good film.  Although Walker is billed as the star, he and every other human in this film play second fiddle to the sled dogs in this movie.  This tale is about the struggles and dangers faced by eight sled dogs when they are left behind in Antarctica when a storm forces the humans out of the science base they are at.  Walker is the guide of the group, and is responsible for the safety of the dogs.  When he has to leave them behind, he vows to return for them later.  The weather, and funding, have different plans for him.As the story rolls along, we get to follow the adventures of Maya, Max, Old Jack, and the rest of the sled team as the fend for themselves in the brutal winter of Antarctica.  There is a slight lull in the film when the focus is shifted from the dogs and to the attempts of Walker to raise funds to get back to them.  Not that Walker or anyone else did a poor job, it just slows the movie down too much.The human cast does an excellent job despite their limited roles.  Along for the ride with Walker are Jason Biggs, Moon Bloodgood, and the ever dependable Bruce Greenwood.  All of them give solid, albeit brief, performances that enhance the emotional tone of the film.*Potential Spoilers*When you boil down to it, this is an excellent family movie.  It does have a couple of scares in it, but nothing most children can't handle if they're above the age of four.  In fact, if you and your children watched the recently released ""Happy Feet"" and survived the seal encounter, there's one scene in particular that might be very scary to the kids in ""Eight Below.""  However, I'd let my five-year-old watch ""Eight Below"" many times more than ""Happy Feet.""  I think that there's only one cuss word uttered in the flick, and it's nothing too terrible.

982844,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000F4PDF8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Well, I've got to be honest right off the bat. A Disney movie headlining Paul Walker and a bunch of dogs would not be my first filmgoing choice. Call me a skeptic, if you will, but much ""family fare"" runs a bit sweet for my taste. However, I was pleasantly surprised with ""Eight Below."" While there is some definite ""sweetness"" and a few unnecessarily cutesy moments, the film is a relatively compelling story of survival and commitment.Based on a real-life incident, the story revolves around an Antarctic research station. Paul Walker plays a dogsled guide who is devoted to his team of eight dogs. With the winter season about to close the post, Walker and his team take one last expedition with a major storm fast approaching. While they are able to outrace the storm for the mandated evacuation, there is not room to take the dogs. Expecting to be able to come back and get them, everyone abandons the station. But the incoming storm prevents any possible return and the eight dogs are left stranded and tied up. The remainder of the film plays out in two concurrent stories--one with Walker trying to mount a rescue and one with the dogs trying to survive.The success of the film comes from the great locale, interesting story, and effective action pieces. With the wintry backdrop, ""Eight Below"" is certainly a beautiful movie to look at--the cinematography and music compliment the sweeping scenery. The action bits are well staged and exciting. Particularly good is the last mission before the storm, as well as a bit where the dogs encounter one nasty seal! While the tale of survival is largely sanitized for family audiences, there are still real consequences to keep things compelling for more adult viewers. The Walker storyline is certainly the lesser element, but it is a nice lesson in commitment and perseverance.I wasn't crazy about the station's cartographer, played by Jason Biggs of ""American Pie."" Inserted for obvious comedic relief, his character rarely rang true (he doesn't like to be licked by a certain dog--pause for laugh). I, also, felt that much of the dogs' interaction with each other and nature was ""humanized"" instead of real. But these were actually relatively minor points, because I enjoyed ""Eight Below."" A nice entry for a live action Disney film, it's a film I would recommend for animal lovers and those interested in the exotic location. About 3 1/2 stars, I'll round up for it being a refreshing surprise.

The cinematography and scenes with the dogs and how they manage to survive the Antarctic winter are terrific; it's the human scenes that lack interest and are really just there for filler. Every time the movie switches to the human actors, you find yourself counting the seconds to get back to the dogs' story. The movie tries to whip up some human interest such as with the nascent romance between Paul Walker, the guide, and Moon Bloodgood, the female pilot, but the script and acting by the human actors just can't compete with the amazing story of the dogs' quest for survival.

This modernized version of the story is an emotionally heart-wrenching saga that will leave true dog lovers wiping their eyes. EIGHT BELOW left me very angry. Angry, not so much that the dogs had to be left behind in the first place, that is understandable; but the conditions in which they were left. No food and staked to a chain in the open elements in Antarctica.Seven of the eight dogs are able to get loose from their tether, while we watch the oldest of the Huskies die a slow and miserable death. We then see another of the canines suffer internal injuries after a fall. Your heart will ache watching the remainder of the pack display their compassion to their wounded and dying companion.The movie does have many ""feel good"" moments mixed in, such as seeing the lead dog, Maya, scold one over zealous and not too smart malamute for scaring off dinner, then making him stay back while the others successfully hunt the flock. The same malamute later gets separated from the pack when he refuses to leave the side of his dying companion, only to be later reunited with the pack. The malamute then proves himself to be not so dumb after all as he quickly learns the art of arctic survival.The human element of this movie could have been better. There are the usual Hollywood hunting's of a love story, desperation on the part of the dogs' master to organize a rescue, and even a few shallow attempts at humor.The movie is clean and is recommended for children, but parents should be prepared for some emotional episodes with children who may have difficulty dealing the harsh realities of this movie.",4,"Dog lovers, BEWARE!",1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1715,"['movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'account', 'team', 'sled', 'dogs', 'left', 'behind', 'emergency', 'evacuation', 'modernized', 'version', 'story', 'emotionally', 'heart-wrenching', 'saga', 'will', 'leave', 'true', 'dog', 'lovers', 'wiping', 'eyes', 'EIGHT', 'BELOW', 'left', 'very', 'angry', 'Angry', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dogs', 'had', 'be', 'left', 'first', 'place', 'understandable', 'conditions', 'were', 'left', 'food', 'staked', 'chain', 'open', 'elements', 'Antarctica.Seven', 'eight', 'dogs', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'loose', 'tether', 'watch', 'oldest', 'Huskies', 'slow', 'miserable', 'death', 'then', 'see', 'canines', 'suffer', 'internal', 'injuries', 'fall', 'heart', 'will', 'ache', 'watching', 'remainder', 'pack', 'display', 'compassion', 'wounded', 'dying', 'companion.The', 'movie', 'have', 'many', 'feel', 'good', 'moments', 'mixed', 'such', 'seeing', 'lead', 'dog', 'Maya', 'scold', 'one', 'zealous', 'not', 'too', 'smart', 'malamute', 'scaring', 'off', 'dinner', 'then', 'making', 'stay', 'back', 'others', 'successfully', 'hunt', 'flock', 'same', 'malamute', 'later', 'separated', 'pack', 'when', 'leave', 'side', 'dying', 'companion', 'only', 'be', 'later', 'reunited', 'pack', 'malamute', 'then', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'dumb', 'quickly', 'art', 'arctic', 'survival.The', 'human', 'element', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'hunting', 'love', 'story', 'desperation', 'part', 'dogs', 'master', 'organize', 'rescue', 'even', 'few', 'shallow', 'attempts', 'humor.The', 'movie', 'clean', 'recommended', 'children', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'emotional', 'episodes', 'children', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'harsh', 'realities', 'movie']",N/A

However, Disney states that Eight Below was inspired by true events.  There is a difference between a movie intended to document actual events (aka, a ""Documentary"") and a movie which was ""inspired"" by true events.  An inspiration is just that--an inspiration--meant to provide motivation to do something.  In this case, the inspiration motivated Disney to produce a wonderful movie about love, devotion, struggle, regret, redemption, and a host of other emotions you will surely recognize and experience while watching this movie.Moreover, Disney never claimed it was a documentary, which gave them literary license to write it however they saw fit.  Even if that meant using eight dogs instead of seven (the horror of it all); or filming it in the daylight so us viewers could actually see the characters and not have to use our imagination about what they were up to.Sure a movie is more poignant when it is accurately based on a true story.  But it doesn't have to be an exact duplicate of the true story in order to derive equal meaning from it.  The poignancy of this movie is how strong love exists between man and animal, and between animals themselves.Just like in real life, the characters had to make tough decisions based on the circumstances they were in.  Sometimes, the best we can do is all we can do.  And, as in real life, sometimes that effort is not enough to produce a desired outcome.  But that's life, and that's what this movie is about.The only dastardly thing I can say about this movie is that I began watching it thinking I was in for a light-hearted treat, having no idea that in so watching I would end up feeling more sadness and elation than I had felt in quite some time from a movie.

982889,AE3R22OUWRDP4,B000F4PDF8,"Rebecca J. Carlson ""The Highly Unlikely""","[4, 8]","First of all, let me say that this film had some beautiful moments. The final scene where the dogs are at last reunited with their human friends is almost worth all the absurdity we had to go through in order to get there.Why doesn't anybody do any research anymore? So there is this scientist who is going to Antarctica to look for a meteorite from Mercury. He wants to go look on this particular mountain, which our intrepid guide is loathe to take him to because it is on the other side of a melting ice shelf. Just let me say that there is no way to know where you are going to find a meteorite in Antarctica. Going out and wandering around in the snow around base camp would be just as good a bet as anything. But this scientist just has a good feeling about this particular mountain, I guess. The guide says that they'll have to take the dog team because the ice is too thin for snowmobiles.Of course the scientist almost falls down a crevasse in the glacier. The dogs pull him to safety. Dogs 1, Humans 0. Next thing we know, base camp radios in that a huge storm is coming and they have to turn around and go home right away. The scientist talks the guide into staying just a little longer so he can look for his meteorite.Now this, for me, was really, really funny. They start looking for a meteorite IN A PILE OF EXPOSED ROCK! The REASON you look for meteorites in Antarctica is because any rock you find lying out there in the middle of the frozen ice MUST HAVE COME FROM OUTER SPACE! Instead, they figure the meteorite was lonely and crawled over to where the other rocks were, I guess.So the scientist actually finds his meteorite. It's a meteorite, all right, a nice iron meteorite with ablation pits, sitting there on top of the snow, near a large pile of rocks. Now, iron meteorites do not come from the surfaces of other planets. They come from asteroids with metal cores that got broken up in collisions in the asteroid belt. I guess I'm one of the few humans on the planet that know this, and they didn't figure on me watching the movie. This scientist, however, can tell instantly that this rock is a basalt from the surface of Mercury. I guess I should be happy they at least got a meteorite for the movie, even if it couldn't possibly have been what the scientist said it was.Before they get back to base camp the scientist manages to break his leg and fall through thin ice. The dogs pull him to safety. Dogs 2, Humans 0. If scientists were always so much trouble they wouldn't allow them at research bases, now would they? This mishap delays their return to camp so much that they have to leave the dogs behind all winter. Somehow. I'm a little foggy on that point.The rest of the film is about how the dogs survive by learning to catch CG seagulls, and about how the guide tries to get back to Antarctica to rescue them in spite of beaurocrats, girlfriends, annoying cartographers, and ungrateful meteorite hunting scientists.But Siberian huskies look beautiful running around in the snow!

982894,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000F4PDF8,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 11]","**1/2""8 Below"" is the ultimate ""a boy and his dog story,"" only, in this case, the ""boy"" is a 32-year-old expedition leader in Antarctica named Jerry Shepherd, and the ""dog"" is actually six huskies and two malamutes he uses to pull his sled.  When he is forced by circumstances to abandon the pooches to a harsh winter in the South Pole, the dogs do their best to battle the elements, while Shepherd moves heaven and earth to get back there to rescue them.The film is really divided up into several different parts, making the movie seem unduly fractured and less dramatic than it might otherwise have been.  We have the scenes at the beginning where Shepherd, with the help of his ""friends,"" aids a scientist in finding a meteorite from Mercury that has supposedly crash landed right smack in the middle of Antarctica (and how does one determine that a particular rock is from Mercury anyway?); the scenes involving the struggle of the abandoned dogs to survive alone in the harsh wintry environment; the scenes showing Shepherd back in the states trying to get some sort of rescue operation going; and the final scenes of Shepherd and his band of fellow merry adventurers fighting their way through the elements to save the pooches.Those with a fondness for animal stories will probably be enraptured by this film, but those with only a cursory interest in the subject matter may find a lot of this to be rather heavy sledding.  Although the film is ostensibly derived from a true story, the scenes involving the dogs out on their own must be based in large part on pure speculation since no human being could have witnessed what it was the dogs actually did.  At any rate, these are probably the best scenes in the movie, mainly because the humans who share center stage with the animals have far less personality than the dogs.  The canines have obviously been well trained, but couldn't anything have been done with the actors?  Paul Walker is all teary-eyed grimaces as the man desperate to re-connect with his four-legged pals, and Moon Bloodgood is bland and innocuous as his on-again, off-again love interest and helicopter pilot extraordinaire.On the positive side, the movie is beautiful to look at, and there are a number of very impressively choreographed and mounted scenes involving near-death experiences (involving animals of both the two-legged and the four-legged variety) out there on the ice.  However, one should note a few anachronisms that make the viewer question the movie's overall commitment to verisimilitude.  In one scene, Shepherd flies to Washington D.C. to plead with some government official to finance a mission to rescue the dogs.  The caption on the screen tells us that it is early February, yet all the trees are in full bloom and the pedestrians are obviously dressed for warm weather.

Although Jason Biggs of American Pie is in it, this time he's the usual goofball but without any stupid humor and not one bad word anywhere in the film. It's safe family entertainment. The story is about a scientific post in Antartica that uses eight Huskies to get around with selds in the snow-barren wilderness of the South Pole. Trouble starts for the dogs when Winter arrives early and the dogs have to survive by themselves which is documented in the film as is also the human aspect of leaving the dogs behind to fight for themselves. The scenery and photography is breathtaking and it is a well-made Disney movie. It is based on a true story and that makes it even more interesting. Don't compare this film to Snow Dogs as this film is not a comedy and the location, storyline and premise are completely different. Aside from the dogs as heros, Paul Walker plays the human hero and he plays the role of an expedition guide very believably. Some concepts of the human psyche which may have been intended to be communicated in this flick, clearly miss the mark as these are not communicated, but it doesn't matter ... it's a clean family movie which the juniors as well as dog lovers will really appreciate and enjoy. Also, a lot about the behavior and kindness/faithfulness of the four-legged friends is shown. My wife liked this film very much and she said the DVD once released is a definite buy.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","After I told a relative that I cried nonstop through ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"" she recommended seeing this film. Now I'm not usually the type of person who cries through films but I have a very HUGE soft spot for dogs. Compared to ""Hachi,"" this film was almost upbeat, but I did shed a couple tears through the ending of this film, too. Paul Walker is gorgeous, and when a man can have frostbite fingers, goggle burns and look like he's absolutely freezing and STILL look good, that's a major perk. But as nice as Paul was on the eyes, it was the dogs that stole the film for me. These were some of the most beautiful Alaskan Huskies, and I just liked watching them in action. I watched the behind the scenes to see how they stayed in character so well and agree with the guy from ""American Pie"" who talked about how good the dogs' ""acting"" is.Considering this story is inspired by a true story, I was incredibly annoyed with the scientist's nonchalant attitude about saving the dogs after he pushed to continue this expedition over a stupid rock. There's not a piece of science in this world (minus disease cures) that I'd compare to a dog's life so I was irritated that he seemed so blahzay about going back to get dogs. At one point, I didn't even want to see how long the dogs had been in Antarctica. It was painful watching them try to survive. Honorable. Respectable. But painful.I cheered on Paul Walker's character for being so determined to get his dogs, and anybody who is a dog lover will understand why he couldn't just ""forget"" them. I never did figure out why he was adamant about tying the dogs up before they left. What difference did it make if they got loose during a snowstorm? That didn't make any sense to me, and I watched the film twice to see if I missed the reason for that.I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes animal movies. You may have to watch it a couple times to memorize the dogs' names and what the results of each of them were.

982906,A3J7QJP2L47GDR,B000F4PDF8,Shilohbloo,"[12, 14]","The four stars is for the incredible dogs, and the strong bond Jerry Shepherd (Paul Walker) holds with them (as well as for both commentaries on the DVD, which holds some very cool info about the dogs, and interesting facts, such as to why One's breath does not show in below zero weather, like so many tend to believe it should).  They actually deserve the highest of all star ratings, but I can not even think to give this movie five stars for all the rest of it.  The rest of it deserves less than zero!  This movie pulled, ripped, and shredded all my heart strings and left me absolutely drained.  At the end -- kindly overlooking the obvious fact that no way would any guide ""forget"" to wear his gloves under any circumstances in such freezing weather, therefore forcing him to leave his dogs for fear of losing his fingers to frostbite -- I couldn't help but focus on the fact that first they chose to take the equipment out before the dogs, thus beginning the whole tragedy in motion, and second that all Dr. Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood) had to do was make up his mind to help when initially asked, and Old Jack and Dewey would have been saved.  And did the girlfriend even once try to buck the system to get the dogs in the beginning, even if futile?... No.  Everyone except for Jerry were about letting them go and moving on.  Gee, if it were their loved ones, their children, would it have been so easy?  I think most definitely not.  And it was made clear that the love held by Jerry for these magnificent animals was as strong as this.  And it was only through the heartbreaking persistence of Jerry -- and the luck of a child's eye-opening drawing of the hero dogs that saved his daddy's life (that of Dr. McClaren's) -- that Dr. McClaren and the rest finally, most hesitatingly, hopped on board -- a whopping six months later.  Unbelievable.  It felt as if they were finally giving in to a child's whim, so to shut him up already.  When Jerry apologized to Dr. McClaren, saying that he shouldn't have put his problems on him, this simply astonished me.  Not only did the dogs save Dr. McClaren's life once, but twice, and all through his own stubbornness of pushing forward despite Jerry's warnings of danger; and it was because of this very idiocy that the dogs were hastily abandoned in the first place, in order to get the injured doc back, so to save his sorry legs, as well as to save Jerry's fingers from the frostbite that he got from saving the unworthy doc.  I do believe that not only made it his problem, but put him in the position of a life-long indebtedness to the dogs and Jerry.  To him, though, the dogs weren't worth the leftover money to reciprocate, and he did not feel he owed Jerry anything.  Amazing.  And let me reiterate, this was LEFTOVER money!!!  He wouldn't have gotten his stupid rock or grand award, not to mention have had a life to get these things, if it hadn't been for them.  In fact, I do believe their saving him twice would more than make that money theirs for some kind of reward, don't you think?  But instead of a reward they got tragic betrayal instead.  Makes my blood boil.  Sure, he finally gave in way later, but even then it felt like he was inching his way to it, through guilt alone, begrudgingly doing Jerry and the dogs a FAVOR instead of finally understanding that HE OWED THEM ALL and was doing what he should have done from the start, saving them all -- as he should have Dewey and Old Jack -- as they had saved him time and again.  God help the surviving dogs had it not been leftover money, but instead his being asked to put his own cash in.  No doubt he would never have gone the extra mile then.  Even now, it annoys me to no end that Jerry didn't pull the ""they saved your life twice"" and ""You owe us all"" cards when he was first asking Dr. McClaren for his help.  If ever a time to bring it up, this was it!  Put his problems on him?  Ridiculous!  He didn't even get started!!!  The only true heart through it all was from the dogs and Jerry.  No one else cared enough or tried enough, which made Jerry's declaration to his girlfriend, near the end, that he owed her for always understanding how important getting back to the dogs was, very confusing to me.  There was a great lacking of support, all around, emotional or otherwise, to Jerry and the dogs, and this chickie was definitely no different.  She always had some sort of sly smile on her face, even in the beginning when giving condolences over having to leave the dogs... this happy glow... Really disconcerting.  Just felt like, ""So sorry, so sad, but must move on now!""  If the intention of her character was to be understanding throughout the movie, her part was sorely lacking.  At best, she came off as patronizing and just barely patient through his worrying so much over something that she made very clear should be let go of, even though the dogs were at that very moment starving, lost, lonely, and dying.  It wasn't a year later... or even six months yet... but this was her attitude at the beginning until they finally decided to go back.  Did she not get that you don't get past something WHILE IT IS STILL HAPPENING???!!!  Only after you understand that it is over, truly done with, do you even start to think about the journey of learning to live with it.  But out of sight out of mind, right?!!!  So, that scene, and the fact that no one ever actually apologized or made some motion that they were responsible with their lack of previous action, made me sick at heart.  The fact is that even if this movie wasn't based on a true story it would irk me and make my heart ache... but the sad truth is that not only was there one dog (Old Jack) that died through starvation, alone and immobile in the snow... but in real life, there were actually SEVEN -- and SIX more unaccounted for!!!  In real life there were 15 dogs and only two known to have survived.  So, I don't even get the comfort of, ""Well, at least this was just a movie"".  Needless to say, this is the movie that finally outdid the one other movie that ripped my heart to shreds as a little girl -- Old Yeller -- but at least that one was truly ""just a movie"".  So, yes, this movie is a spectacular viewing, the dogs are beyond awesome, Paul Walker is fantastic, a true hero (An avid dog lover in real life, as well!), with a considerable joyous relief in the end for the dogs that did survive... but I just can't get past the absolutely avoidable TRAGIC deaths of those other loyal, loving, trusting dogs... betrayed... and the fact that the ones that did survive were no doubt scarred for life.  So many are heralding this movie as a human bonding, growing thing.  While I do say that it is a lesson of the true love and loyalty that dog holds for man, and that man should hold for dog... for the rest of it, it's a painful reminder of all the dogs left behind (ex:The heroic Vietnam War dogs; the K-9 Katrina victims; the no longer interested family leaving their pup in the woods), an acknowledgment of the ungratefulness and insufferable selfishness of so many out there, and the heartbreaking destruction that too often comes from it.  **View this movie so to let the haunting images fill you, and then never allow such a horrific thing to happen again.  NO ANIMAL LEFT BEHIND!  These dogs story needs to be told, so that their deaths are never, ever in vain and such tragedy is never allowed to ever happen again.",4,Beloved and Betrayed,1151452800,"06 28,

He believes the rock from space is located on a nearby mountain. The problem is, he hasn't told the team that, telling them he wanted to go to a completely different place, to protect the whereabouts of the rock. He needs the help of Gerry Shepherd (Paul Walker), the guide, and the rest of the team at the station. Gerry hasn't scouted and tested the area for safety and is very concerned about the trip. After some discussion, the guide agrees and gives the professor an introduction to his dog sled team, a group of eight dogs he has grown very attached to. The lead dog, Maya, is his pride and joy and the rest of the team is very cute, very furry and equally responsive to their trainer and handler, Gerry. The rest of the humans, including Cooper (Jason Biggs, ""American Pie""), the cartographer and comic relief and Kate, Gerry's ex-girlfriend and the pilot, stay behind to await his return. During the journey, they run into trouble and an impending storm further hampers the expedition's travels. They return to the base camp just as they have to evacuate. The only problem? They can't take the dogs with them. Kate promises she will return right away for them. Gerry learns they can't return for the dogs. Will they be able to survive on their own through the harsh Antarctic winter? Can Gerry get anyone to help him go back and look for them?""8 Below"", directed by Frank Marshall, producer of many successful films and director of films like ""Arachnophobia"" and ""Congo"", is a good live-action film, suitable for the entire family. Not too cute or too scary, the film should appeal to and entertain just about everyone who must accompany the children who want to see the adventures of the cute dogs.As they say ""Everything old is new again."" Disney used to make a fair number of live action films involving humans and animals. ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"", ""Greyfriar Bobby"", ""The Bear and I"" and ""Dad, Can I Borrow the Car?"" all featured animals interacting, to a certain extent, with humans; horses, dogs, cougars, bears and more exotic animals befriended by children and adults and vice versa. If anyone can actually remember these films by title, it isn't because of the acting of the humans; it is because of the photography capturing these animals in the wild, showing them in their natural beauty, their natural elements. Often, the stories became excuses for a lot of great wildlife photography with people like Fess Parker appearing in the beginning and end of the film, to help tie everything together. In this new film, the animals have almost as much screen time as Paul Walker and Jason Biggs and this allows some of the animals to become real characters to us. When the story separates the two groups, and we begin to follow their separate journeys, the film essentially becomes two separate stories. The part with the dogs works better.Each of the dogs has a distinct personality, with Maya, the leader, and Max, the brash new addition to the crew, leading the pack, both literally and figuratively. As they find themselves stranded in the harsh landscape, they band together to help each other survive. They hunt, following the ideas of Maya, garnering some seagulls for much needed protein. When they find a beached whale, Max attempts to lure a Leopard Seal away so the rest of the dogs can feast. They help each other when one becomes injured. During the initial journey with the professor, Walker's character identifies them and helps to introduce each of their characters, serving us well when they become stranded. Because we know them a little, when they are on their own, we recognize them and travel the journey with them.The film is best when following the plights of the dogs. A couple of them become real characters, animals we care for, and their journey is interesting. The fact they band together and help one another makes them all the more interesting. When one of the dogs becomes injured, they wait for them, feeding them to help them become well, they sleep next to them, providing heat, and more.The film is less successful following Walker during his attempts to get funding to return to the dogs, to rescue them. A series of scenes depict his ongoing efforts, and his dead ends, to get back to the dogs. He returns to Astoria, Oregon. He begins teaching young kids to kayak. Then Kate comes to visit. Walker begins to feel guilty again. He visits the man who trained the dogs, who (conveniently) lives close by. Then, just as it seems he will never get back to the dogs, he receives a surprise which might help him save his beloved friends. Because this is essentially a series of dead ends and terse conversations, it doesn't mesh or flow as smoothly as the rest of the film. In fact, it almost seems like these scenes were added to give us a breather from the better footage featuring the dogs. Or maybe as filler, to make the film feature length.The second part of the film, featuring the less interesting human actors, is only notable because of the people appearing in the film. Paul Walker, Jason Biggs and Bruce Davison have all appeared in a fair number of films. The younger actors could certainly appear in sexier, more `Hollywood' projects, so it seems a little odd that they would agree to appear in half of a film. Biggs is essentially a supporting character in that half of a film. Maybe they are trying to prove their range and increase their audience by taking part in this family film. They are certainly pleasant enough, but in the last few years, a number of live action films featuring humans have featured better performances, including ""Duma"" and ""Two Brothers"". These films were little seen. Why? Because they didn't have the Disney Marketing Machine behind them.At the end of the film, when Walker's character is reunited with the dogs (oh, come on, like you didn't know that was going to happen!) is a very moving moment. But it is moving because we care for the dogs, not the humans. The film has a great deal of trouble making us care for the humans and suffers because of it.""8 Below"" is a good family film, worthy of a bargain matinee if you have kids. But I suspect it will suffer the same fate as the earlier Disney live action films featuring animals. Forgotten, except as ""that film with the sled dogs."" Then when the kids see the animated films right next to this, they will choose the animated films. As they should.",3,Those Darn Dogs,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,6611,"['8', 'new', 'live', 'action', 'family', 'film', 'Disney', 'really', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'varying', 'quality.A',

That was my perspective when my six-year-old daughter requested that I put it at the top of my Netflix list. Just by sheer luck I was there when she started watching it.  I was immediately transfixed, and that continued the entire time.  This is an instant adventure classic that will keep both kids and grown-ups intrigued from beginning to end.  The story is great and you really come to care about the characters.  And, importantly, the scenery is breath-taking, just stupendous.The performances are likewise all first-rate.  Moon Bloodstone, who I was not familiar with, is a beautiful young pilot who reminds me of Maggie from Northern Exposure. She has a history with the lead character, who is a guide to scientists in the antarctic.  Both of these actors are great and totally believable in their roles with meaningful displays of courage and loyalty.  The scientist, who somewhat creates all the problems, reminds me of Harrison Ford, and his performance was good as well. He ultimately shows a display of conscience in a competitive academic environment where that can be inconvenient. And then there is the funny side-kick, who is there when the going gets rough for his antarctic co-workers and friends.  And, perhaps most importantly, there are the amazing dogs.  You will wonder throughout how they were able to make the dogs cooperate so convincingly. Not to mention a raging sea lion!  How did they get that footage??!!

982925,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F4PDF8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","The original story about the Antarctic expedition team that had to leave their dogs because of the severe weather condition is very famous in Japan. It is no surprise that `Antarctica' (`Nankyoku Monogatari'), more faithful filmic re-creation of the event that happened 1958, became an instant mega-hit when released in 1983, then the highest grossing film in Japanese box-office history (until 1997 the year when Hayao Miyazaki's `Princess Mononoke' was released).[LOVE THESE DOGS] Disney's version `Eight Below' changes the situation surrounding the humans entirely, but the core of the story about the dogs that survived the winter of Antarctica remains intact. People rightly point out that the real stars of the film are these dogs, but you don't have to be dog-lovers to enjoy this film. Their story about the survival among the ice and snow is a very strong and engrossing one, which can be appreciated by both children and adults. It takes a heart made of ice to dislike it.Compared with these lovely and smart dogs, humans in `Eight Below' are less interesting. Four characters played by Paul Walker, Jason Biggs, Bruce Greenwood, and Moon Bloodgood consist the story about the humans who had to leave the dogs on the cold, icy field. I don't write here about how they are forced to abandon the dogs in Antarctica. Some part of it is contrived, but not so bad as to damage the authenticity of the moving story.Though the acting (of humans, I mean) is all decent, it is inevitable that the scene-stealing dogs are always more convincing. Though Bruce Greenwood's character as natural scientist who seeks meteorites is plausible, the love story between Paul Walker and Moon Bloodgood's characters is weak and perhaps unnecessary, as is the comic relief by Jason Biggs.Frank Marshal is so far best known for `Alive' as director, another survival story based on real-life event. `Eight Below' is not as gut-wrenching as the grim reality of the airplane crash survivors, but some part is still sad to see. But thanks to the beautiful photography of the film by Don Burgess (`Forrest Gump'), and these cute dogs especially Maya and Max, `Eight Below' is a success as both entertainment and drama just like Jack London stories.",4,Hope Survives: Moving and Entertaining Story About Eight Dogs,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,2229,"['original', 'story', 'Antarctic', 'expedition', 'team', 'had', 'leave', 'dogs', 'severe', 'weather', 'condition', 'very', 'famous', 'Japan', 'surprise', 'Antarctica', 'Nankyoku', 'Monogatari', 'more', 'faithful', 'filmic', 're-creation', 'event', 'happened', '1958', 'became', 'instant', 'mega-hit', 'when', 'released', '1983', 'then', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'Japanese', 'box-office', 'history', '1997', 'year', 'when', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'was', 'released', '[', 'LOVE', 'THESE', 'DOGS', ']', 'Disney', 'version', 'Eight', 'Below', 'changes', 'situation', 'surrounding', 'humans', 'entirely', 'core', 'story', 'dogs', 'survived', 'winter', 'Antarctica', 'intact', 'People', 'rightly', 'point', 'out', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'dogs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'dog-lovers', 'enjoy', 'film', 'story', 'survival', 'ice', 'snow', 'very', 'strong', 'engrossing', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'children', 'adults', 'heart', 'made', 'ice', 'dislike', 'it.Compared', 'lovely', 'smart', 'dogs', 'humans', 'Eight', 'are', 'less', 'interesting', 'Four', 'characters', 'played', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'consist', 'story', 'humans', 'who', 'had', 'leave', 'dogs', 'cold', 'icy', 'field', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'here', 'how', 'are', 'forced', 'abandon', 'dogs', 'Antarctica', 'part', 'contrived', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'damage', 'authenticity', 'moving', 'acting', 'humans', 'mean', 'decent', 'inevitable', 'scene-stealing', 'dogs', 'are', 'always', 'more', 'convincing', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'character', 'natural', 'scientist', 'who', 'meteorites', 'plausible', 'love', 'story', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Moon', 'Bloodgood', 'characters', 'weak', 'perhaps', 'unnecessary', 'comic', 'relief', 'Jason', 'Biggs.Frank', 'Marshal', 'so', 'far', 'best', 'known', 'Alive', 'director', 'survival', 'story', 'based', 'real-life', 'event', 'Eight', 'Below', 'not', 'as', 'gut-wrenching', 'grim', 'reality', 'airplane', 'crash', 'survivors', 'part', 'still', 'sad', 'see', 'thanks', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'film', 'Don', 'Burgess', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'cute', 'dogs', 'especially', 'Maya', 'Max', 'Eight', 'Below', 'success', 'entertainment', 'drama', 'just', 'Jack', 'London', 'stories']",N/A

But he proves himself admirably, with the help of screenwriter David DiGilio.They weave two equally interesting plots together: one following the lives of the human characters and the other the lives of the dogs. In the beginning, the two are joined in a wonderful relationship that involves work, play, survival and rescue in one of the coldest regions of the world. But when the dogs are left behind, the two plots separate, and could have caused problems if they both hadn't held our interest. But they do - and how!In Antarctica, the dogs fight to survive on their own - for six months! Meanwhile, Walker's character, Jerry Shephard, searches desperately for a way back in order to save them. Walker is the perfect outdoorsman-guide, and his relationship with the dogs is totally believable and the crux of the film. He also has wonderful relationships with his fellow workers: Katie, his love interest, played by Moon Bloodgood; and Charlie, who provides the comedy relief, played by Jason Biggs. Bruce Greenwood plays the scientist who causes a lot of the problems for the team in the beginning. The entire supporting cast is excellent.Based on the ""making of"" feature, very little if anything in this film is CGI. It is all live-action and was shot, in part in Vancouver, part in Greenland, and a small part - the scene with the leopard seal - on a soundstage. In addition, there are some non-Antarctic scenes. About that leopard seal: that is one of the scariest scenes ever filmed, in my opinion - right up there with any in Jaws. The seal itself is mechanical, rather than CGI - except, perhaps, in the underwater sequence, which is handsomely done. As a matter of fact, the cinematography by Don Burgess is some of the best location shooting I've ever seen.It's hard to understand how a film in which the canine actors carry half the action could not lag, but it never does. From beginning to end, it is interesting, exciting, inspiring, entertaining, heart-warming and everything else a family film should be. This is due to the concerted effort of the entire cast and crew. It is the rare case when everyone on a film production does his job and does it well; but that seems to be the case with Eight Below.

As shown - well, the lady in the row in front of me spent a lot of time dabbing her eyes.Antarctica isn't a brutal place, but it demands everything and forgives nothing. Mishaps on a research trip put the lives of the scientists at risk. Then the first storm of the Antarctic winter arises suddenly, threatening the entire research station. They have to evacuate, fast, with no time for a second planeload out. There's no time to save the sled dogs - they are left, chained together, to the polar winter. There is only one possible end for them.This is a Disney movie, so the ending has to be a [mostly] happy one. The powerful huskies break free of their chains and survive the six months of frozen hell on their own. From this point on, until weather allows the researchers to come back, the scriptwriters pull all the stops on their imaginations. The dogs learn team tactics for hunting, defense, and doggy friendship, with plenty of touching moments to go around.Eight Below might not be for the kid who can't take endings that are only 90% happy, or who would shrink from the harsh realities of carnivores getting food.

Countless Japanese films have been re-made with American versions, in genres from horror (Ringu/The Ring) to romance (Shall We Dance?/Shall We Dance?) to westerns (Yojimbo/A Fistful of Dollars).""Eight Below"" is another American re-make, from the original 1983 Japanese filmAntarctica(Original title ""Nankyoku Monogatari"" or ""Antarctica Story"").  ""Antarctica"" is a true story of a failed 1958 expedition that was forced to retreat due to bad weather conditions, abandoning fifteen Sakhalin huskies chained to a pole.  When they returned the following year, they were amazed to find two of the huskies, Taro and Jiro, were still alive.  The film was a major hit in Japan, and is still remembered fondly.Disney's version is much more uplifting.  ""Eight Below"" follows the same basic plot, except this time the lucky dogs fare much better than in real life.  The film splits between the human and canine story, following the attempts of guide and dog-handler Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) desperately trying to gather funds and a crew to go back for the abandoned dogs, and at the same time showing the dogs survival on the frozen continent, doing battle with monstrous leopard seals and playing with the Southern Lights.Science-minded folks are going to be driven crazy by this flick.  A meteorite (from Mercury!) is recovered with little effort in a snowfield, just in time.  Antarctica is balmy and bright in the middle of winter, and the dogs happily share food with wounded comrades instead of...well, eating them.  But, ""Eight Below"" is a Disney kid's flick, and so we have to forgive these kinds of things.  And everyone likes a happy ending, right?I liked ""Eight Below.""  It feels good to watch this kind of ""feel good"" film, knowing that everything is going to come out right, and will end with hugs and kisses all around.  But it is interesting to compare it to the original Japanese version.  In Japan, the ""dog film"" exists as a genre to teach children about life, of which death is very much a part.  Films such asQuillendear children to the animals, but prepare them for reality.  The Japanese film ""Antarctica"" is about life's sometimes-harsh reality, and how to overcome that with courage and perseverance.
