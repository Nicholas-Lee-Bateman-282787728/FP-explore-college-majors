John Ritter's character is an incredibly likeable guy who finds that the adage is true that &quot;no good deed goes unpunished&quot; as he allows his scruples to be corrupted by Convy's movie-producer role.  Really a great film, and definitely one to add to your movie collection.",5,Excellent film,973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,419,"['remember', 'seeing', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'HBO', 'getting', 'hooked', 'years', 'being', 'print', 'good', 'see', 'available', 'again', 'John', 'Ritter', 'character', 'incredibly', 'likeable', 'guy', 'who', 'adage', 'true', 'quot', 'good', 'deed', 'unpunished', 'quot', 'scruples', 'be', 'corrupted', 'Convy', 'movie-producer', 'role', 'Really', 'great', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'add', 'movie', 'collection']",N/A
281087,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301969480,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","I saw this flick in the Winter of '80 on a double-bill with ""Fatso"".  It didn't register much with me and the reasons are two-fold.  Firstly, the flick's complex themes were probably over my sixteen year old head.  Secondly, I wasn't a big fan of John Ritter's or more precisely I had an aversion to ""Three's Company"" the smarmy sit-com that he starred in at the time.  I viewed that show as one as I had to slog through to get to ""Taxi"".  That said ""Hero At Large"" is a great film probably ahead of it's time.  If it came out today it would be akin to ""My Super Ex-Girlfiend""(just kidding).  Ritter's character creates an interesting dichotomy.  He's an actor who can't draw flies.  As his ""Captain Avenger"" alter ego he becomes an urban legend but to be effective as a crusader he must maintain his anonymity.  When he's finally outed as the caped crusader he's met with indifference and outright hostility.  All's well that ends well and ultimately the film's central theme that heroism is within all of us and one doesn't have to don a cape and tights to project it.  ""Hero At Large"" is a film for thinking audiences and maybe in the wake of the success of ""Superman"" the public wasn't ready for a film of this nature.  Of note Kevin Bacon makes a blink and you missed him appearance at a screening of the Captain Avenger flick.

Steve is hired by a publicity firm to dress up as Captain Avenger at a cinema to promote the release of the film and build the hype.  He's one of many different actors hired to do the same thing at several locations.  While visiting a small grocery store on his way home after one of his Avenger gigs, he foils an attempted robbery.  Steve's a real nice guy and though is glad he could help, doesn't think much about what he did.  However, the media eats the story up and the public is soon clamoring to know who the secret identity of this real life Captain Avenger is.  Thrilled at the prospect of being able to use his acting abilities to really help people, Steve goes out as Captain Avenger again to stop another big crime.  Eventually, the publicity firm is able to uncover Steve's identity and want to use him in a stunt to further publicize the Captain Avenger movie.  It's a conflict of conscience as Steve has to decide whether to cash in and give his career a boost or follow his morals.HERO AT LARGE was released in the middle of Ritter's run on THREE'S COMPANY and the movie was really the first feature film starring Ritter as the lead role.  The movie was a perfect fit for Ritter and allowed him to display his range as a dramatic actor.  The film is rather cheery and upbeat, but doesn't stray away from struggles and sadness that we are all familiar with.  For instance, Steve feels great joy when he finally thinks he's won the girl he's been wooing, J. Marsh (portrayed by the lovely Anne Archer). However, his joy suddenly evaporates when he realizes that J. doesn't completely share his feelings and leaves to spend time with her boyfriend.Yet, Steve doesn't give up or let his disappointment or failures keep him down for long.  Like good old Charlie Brown, he just gets back up and begins again.The movie has very little foul language and no nudity. It has some great messages and is a great movie that everyone can watch together as a family. Also, though it's a bit cheesy, the speech that Steve delivers at his public appearance is a great one to listen to.The only real extra on the DVD is the trailer for HERO AT LARGE.",4,Real Heroes Are Just Ordinary People,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2295,"['Released', '1980', 'HERO', 'AT', 'LARGE', 'John', 'Ritter', 'portraying', 'Steve', 'Nichols', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'trying', 'break', 'big', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Steve', 'hired', 'publicity', 'firm', 'dress', 'up', 'as', 'Captain', 'Avenger', 'cinema', 'promote', 'release', 'film', 'build', 'hype', 'one', 'many', 'different', 'actors', 'hired', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'several', 'locations', 'visiting', 'small', 'grocery', 'store', 'way', 'home', 'one', 'Avenger', 'gigs', 'attempted', 'robbery', 'Steve', 'real', 'nice', 'guy', 'though', 'glad', 'could', 'help', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'what', 'did', 'However', 'media', 'eats', 'story', 'up', 'public', 'soon', 'clamoring', 'know', 'who', 'secret', 'identity', 'real', 'life', 'Captain', 'Avenger', 'Thrilled', 'prospect', 'being', 'able', 'use', 'acting', 'abilities', 'really', 'help', 'people', 'Steve', 'out', 'Captain', 'Avenger', 'again', 'stop', 'big', 'crime', 'Eventually', 'publicity', 'firm', 'able', 'uncover', 'Steve', 'identity', 'want', 'use', 'stunt', 'further', 'publicize', 'Captain', 'Avenger', 'movie', 'conflict', 'conscience', 'Steve', 'decide', 'cash', 'give', 'career', 'boost', 'follow', 'morals.HERO', 'AT', 'LARGE', 'was', 'released', 'middle', 'Ritter', 'run', 'THREE', 'COMPANY', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'starring', 'Ritter', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Ritter', 'allowed', 'display', 'range', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'film', 'rather', 'cheery', 'upbeat', ""n't"", 'stray', 'away', 'struggles', 'sadness', 'are', 'familiar', 'instance', 'Steve', 'great', 'joy', 'when', 'finally', 'won', 'girl', 'been', 'wooing', 'J.', 'Marsh', 'portrayed', 'lovely', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'However', 'joy', 'suddenly', 'when', 'J.', ""n't"", 'completely', 'share', 'feelings', 'spend', 'time', 'boyfriend.Yet', 'Steve', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'let', 'disappointment', 'failures', 'keep', 'down', 'long', 'good', 'old', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'just', 'back', 'up', 'again.The', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'foul', 'language', 'nudity', 'great', 'messages', 'great', 'movie', 'everyone', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'family', 'Also', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'speech', 'Steve', 'delivers', 'public', 'appearance', 'great', 'one', 'listen', 'to.The', 'only', 'real', 'extra', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'HERO', 'AT', 'LARGE']",N/A

I saw this in theaters just after Superman the movie caught my imagination, and it's depiction of adult relationships (which is actually pretty tame) was something new to me then.  Wanting to help other people doesn't require super powers or the bank account of Bruce Wayne.  Just a good heart and the desire to make a difference in the world.  Of course, getting recognition as a superhero would be fun, but when it's all said and done people are more important than costumes.  The story is almost Capra-esque, John Ritter and Ann Archer are excellent in the lead roles, and the use of New York locations lends credibility to the story.
