409882,A1NP91R1CRPNQX,6304252307,"Christopher R. Travers ""Einhverfr""","[7, 8]","This movie was obviously an attempt to create a new ""Viking Saga"" based on Icelandic saga material.  The student of the Sagas will find much that is familiar as some scenes are only slightly modified from Njal's Saga and some characters are clearly modelled on characters from a wide number of sagas.  For example Magnus is modelled on Njal, while Gunnar seems to be modelled both on Gunnar in Njal's Saga and Kjartan in the Laxdaela Saga.  Kjartan on the other hand seems partly modelled after both Bolli and Kjartan in the Laxdaela Saga.  Influence can be seen from those sagas plus (possibly) Grettir's Saga and the Eyrbiggja Saga.  The movie generally succeeds at mimicking some of the stylistic elements of the Sagas themselves.However, the movie seems to fall apart in some other important ways.  I found the narration to be at times monotonous, and the good vs evil themes in the movie seemed rather foreign to the genre.  The Lawspeaker (a short-term role) was turned into a heredetary Lawgiver role reminiscent of a sacral king, and the fight at the Althing was put in for plot reasons, not because of any case of such a thing happening in the Sagas.  These elements significantly detracted from the overall movie.  It would be nice to see a much better movie based on the sorts of stories the Sagas excel at-- family histories, tales of the human condition, and the like.I thought the acting was good and the cinematography well done as well.

409884,AIY5W7O2FJDWT,6304252307,Douglas Herring,"[7, 8]","Within the space of a couple of days I watched both ""A Viking Saga: Son of Thor"" and ""The Viking Sagas"".  Two very different films despite their similar titles.  I am a fan and supporter of low budget historical films and these two films have a lot in common and yet at the same time, are very different.  ""A Viking Saga: Son of Thor"" was done more as a minor educational film, they use that term ""educational"" a lot in their advertisements and after watching it, it seems more like something funded by a museum than a sincere attempt to do justice to the subject as a full-on adventure film.  The film is centered around a longhouse recreation, perhaps the museum I suspect this was done for, and a small group of Viking re-enactors.  Amazon's brief description is the whole movie; it is a very simple plot, with constant flashbacks to the attack on the young boy's village as the only major action in the film.  The longships on the cover are not in the film, there are only two much smaller ships used for trading.  The story is basically a Swedish one, with an emphasis on trading and the river routes down into what was later to be known as Russia.  It is a very interesting aspect of Viking history, but unfortunately, it is handled in the most simplistic of ways.  Even a die hard Viking fan like me will be hard pressed to appreciate this movie.  The concept is excellent from a historical point of view; the execution however seemed to be done very simply and cheaply.  I honestly cannot recommend this movie.""The Viking Sagas"" is very different.  Not a big budget Hollywood historical epic, it still has a lot going for it.  Shot entirely in Iceland, where the story takes place, it is a classic tale of revenge and reversal.  The plot is very atypical and has some interesting and complex turns, and much of those are based on an actual history and on the Icelandic judicial system that does indeed go back to the Viking colonial days.  I quickly found myself curious how it would play out, though there was no doubt our hero would triumph.  The scenery is beautiful and stark and knowing a bit about Viking horses, the Icelandic ponies were a nice refreshing historical touch.  The star is Ralf Moeller and he is fairly wooden and too muscle-bound for the untrained warrior he is supposed to be, but I can let that slide.  To me, the ""name"" in this movie is Sven-Ole Thorsen, the ""Swedish Champion"" from Sam Raimi's ""The Quick and the Dead"".  He shows up as a minor character or stunt actor in enough movies that he almost seems like a new Alan Hale Senior to me.  His character is the archetypical ""martial arts master"" but he too has an interesting twist to him plot wise.  This film is not epic, has some B-movie qualities, but if you like adventure films like that, then I suspect you will like this one.",4,An interesting take on early Icelandic Vikings,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2820,"['space', 'couple', 'days', 'watched', 'A', 'Viking', 'Saga', 'Son', 'Thor', 'Viking', 'Sagas', 'Two', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'similar', 'titles', 'am', 'fan', 'supporter', 'low', 'budget', 'historical', 'films', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Viking', 'Saga', 'Son', 'Thor', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'minor', 'educational', 'film', 'use', 'term', 'educational', 'lot', 'advertisements', 'watching', 'more', 'something', 'funded', 'museum', 'sincere', 'attempt', 'do', 'justice', 'subject', 'full-on', 'adventure', 'film', 'film', 'centered', 'longhouse', 'recreation', 'perhaps', 'museum', 'suspect', 'was', 'done', 'small', 'group', 'Viking', 're-enactors', 'Amazon', 'brief', 'description', 'whole', 'movie', 'very', 'simple', 'plot', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'attack', 'young', 'boy', 'village', 'only', 'major', 'action', 'film', 'longships', 'cover', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'much', 'smaller', 'ships', 'used', 'trading', 'story', 'basically', 'Swedish', 'one', 'emphasis', 'trading', 'river', 'down', 'what', 'was', 'later', 'be', 'known', 'Russia', 'very', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Viking', 'history', 'unfortunately', 'handled', 'most', 'simplistic', 'ways', 'Even', 'die', 'hard', 'Viking', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'concept', 'excellent', 'historical', 'point', 'view', 'execution', 'however', 'seemed', 'be', 'done', 'very', 'simply', 'cheaply', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Viking', 'Sagas', 'very', 'different', 'Not', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'historical', 'epic', 'still', 'lot', 'going', 'Shot', 'entirely', 'Iceland', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'classic', 'tale', 'revenge', 'reversal', 'plot', 'very', 'atypical', 'interesting', 'complex', 'turns', 'much', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'history', 'Icelandic', 'judicial', 'system', 'indeed', 'go', 'back', 'Viking', 'colonial', 'days', 'quickly', 'found', 'curious', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'was', 'doubt', 'hero', 'would', 'triumph', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'stark', 'knowing', 'bit', 'Viking', 'horses', 'Icelandic', 'ponies', 'were', 'nice', 'refreshing', 'historical', 'touch', 'star', 'Ralf', 'Moeller', 'fairly', 'wooden', 'too', 'muscle-bound', 'untrained', 'warrior', 'supposed', 'be', 'can', 'let', 'slide', 'name', 'movie', 'Sven-Ole', 'Thorsen', 'Swedish', 'Champion', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Quick', 'Dead', 'up', 'minor', 'character', 'stunt', 'actor', 'enough', 'movies', 'almost', 'new', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Senior', 'character', 'archetypical', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'too', 'interesting', 'twist', 'plot', 'wise', 'film', 'not', 'epic', 'B-movie', 'qualities', 'like', 'adventure', 'films', 'then', 'suspect', 'will', 'like', 'one']",Viking Sagas VHS

The scenery is spectacular and it doe's appear to be accurate to ancient Nordic weapon's and costumes. The biggest surprise for me was seeing Sven-Ole Thorsen's acting ability. You may recognize him from bit roles in many Schwarzenegger films, starting with ""Conan"" as one of the two big warrior's protecting James Earl Jones. Also ""The Running Man"" He is the security guard that refuses to help Richard Dawson saying ""I've got to score some steroids."" and the movie Kull as the king who hands Kevin Sorbo the crown.

Keller ""Packerfan75""","[7, 13]","Being half Norwegian, I've been on a mission to find good Norse/Viking films for a while now and I gave this one a buy before trying because of that. Well, I struck out here as this is one of the worst excuses for a viking action film I've seen yet. To say it's only very loosely viking is being overly generous. There's really nothing here of factual viking history or heritage.The story is basic but it can be hard to follow as your thrown alot of names and aren't always given the time to know exactly who they're talking about. As the lead man, I thought Ralf Moeller was stiff and lifeless. Granted, he didn't have the best script and dialog to deal with but I think he's just not charasmatic enough for a hero role. None of the other actors impressed here at all and I found some of the casting highly questionable.There was nothing and no one here to care anything about no matter what happens. The bad guys were bad but not too bad. Moeller plays the hero who's destiny is to become a great warrior but he keeps getting his butt kicked throughout most of the film. His master/teacher is supposedly the greatest warrior in the land but is old, out of shape and in no way believeable. Moeller just seems to keep wanting to get it on with this one girl most of the time and they have some stupidly unpassionate love scenes that are only there to show unappreciated and gratuitous nudity. Then his master/teacher goes on a killing spree because he wanted Moellers chick even though he's old enough to be her grandfather. I mean, he slaughters a whole village full of people over it and everyone just forgives him for it like nothing happened. Mr.Miagi in the Karate Kid would never do that. Besides, isn't he supposed to be a good guy here? Uh, ok? The swordplay is basic and boring, the blood effects are cheesy and the only thing climactic about the ending was that it was ending. The only redeeming value here are the nice landscapes to look at. That's it.I won't bother reviewing the audio/video here as it's just not worth it.So for anyone else looking for a good Viking film, keep looking and let me know what you find. For anyone who likes old tyme sword fighting action flicks like Conan, Beastmaster and Gladiator, watch those instead. There's a reason why most people never heard of this film.

Also some (though not all) of the material culture looks authentic. But the story gives us a wavering and often distorted view of medieval Iceland as portrayed in the sagas. However, there are several Icelandic films based on the sagas that are much more authentic, with the Icelandic actors speaking their own language. Utlaginn (Outlaw: The Saga of Gisli), directed by Agust Guthmundsson (which I review on IMDb) stays closest to its source. Then there is the Raven trilogy directed by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson, of which I managed to find the first two on DVD: Hrafnin Flygur (The Raven Flies); and I Skugga Hrafnsins (Shadow of the Raven). They are also very authentic in setting and characterization, although the style and cinematography show the influence of other film makers. All of these films take the audience back into a medieval Iceland that would be recognizable to anyone who has read and been fascinated by the Icelandic sagas and chronicles.",2,There are more authentic Icelandic films,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,1078,"['Viking', 'Sagas', 'Icelandic', 'scenery', 'actors', 'thought', 'dialogue', 'English', 'characters', 'ride', 'Icelandic', 'ponies', 'Also', 'not', 'material', 'culture', 'authentic', 'story', 'wavering', 'often', 'distorted', 'view', 'medieval', 'Iceland', 'portrayed', 'sagas', 'However', 'are', 'several', 'Icelandic', 'films', 'based', 'sagas', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'authentic', 'Icelandic', 'actors', 'speaking', 'own', 'language', 'Utlaginn', 'Outlaw', 'Saga', 'Gisli', 'directed', 'Agust', 'Guthmundsson', 'review', 'IMDb', 'closest', 'source', 'Then', 'Raven', 'trilogy', 'directed', 'Hrafn', 'Gunnlaugsson', 'managed', 'find', 'first', 'two', 'DVD', 'Hrafnin', 'Flygur', 'Raven', 'Flies', 'Skugga', 'Hrafnsins', 'Shadow', 'Raven', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'authentic', 'setting', 'characterization', 'style', 'cinematography', 'show', 'influence', 'other', 'film', 'makers', 'films', 'take', 'audience', 'back', 'medieval', 'Iceland', 'would', 'be', 'recognizable', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'been', 'fascinated', 'Icelandic', 'sagas', 'chronicles']",Viking Sagas VHS

I speak of films on par with Braveheart, or Rob Roy, for example. There are very few movies based on the Viking age, or having anything to do with Scandinavia for that matter. Unfortunately, most Viking movies seem to be grade ""B"" affairs, and this is a huge injustice to the complex nature of the Sagas. In the ""plot summary"" for this site, a stupid reviewer describes it as ""a time when conflicts weren't solved with intellect, but with swords"". That reviewer obviously has never read a Nordic Saga, and has no understanding of Scandinavian culture. In fact, negotiation and diplomacy were often as highly esteemed as prowess in battle. The differance is, Men of that age were not afraid to stand up to their enemies in combat. In our time, a loud mouth is the only acceptable ""weapon"".If literate people were running the production studios in Hollywood, perhaps we would see a lot more films based on the sagas of Scandinavia. The potential for great historical drama is enormous!This film is loosely based on the Laxardal Saga from Iceland. I found it to be quite enjoyable, and the Icelandic scenery is a major feature. It could have been more than what it is, however, being somewhat of an action-movie, to a degree. It portays the Laxardal Saga characters Kjartan and Gudrun, but does not really portray the story as it is written in the saga.",3,Not enough Viking movies!,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,1436,"['do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'movies', 'based', 'great', 'historical', 'events', 'eras', 'speak', 'films', 'par', 'Braveheart', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'example', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'based', 'Viking', 'age', 'having', 'anything', 'do', 'Scandinavia', 'matter', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'Viking', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'grade', 'B', 'affairs', 'huge', 'injustice', 'complex', 'nature', 'Sagas', 'plot', 'summary', 'site', 'stupid', 'reviewer', 'time', 'when', 'conflicts', 'were', ""n't"", 'solved', 'intellect', 'swords', 'reviewer', 'obviously', 'never', 'read', 'Nordic', 'Saga', 'understanding', 'Scandinavian', 'culture', 'fact', 'negotiation', 'diplomacy', 'were', 'often', 'highly', 'esteemed', 'prowess', 'battle', 'differance', 'Men', 'age', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'enemies', 'combat', 'time', 'loud', 'mouth', 'only', 'acceptable', 'weapon', '.If', 'literate', 'people', 'were', 'running', 'production', 'studios', 'Hollywood', 'perhaps', 'would', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'films', 'based', 'sagas', 'Scandinavia', 'potential', 'great', 'historical', 'drama', 'enormous', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'Laxardal', 'Saga', 'Iceland', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Icelandic', 'scenery', 'major', 'feature', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'what', 'however', 'being', 'somewhat', 'action-movie', 'degree', 'Laxardal', 'Saga', 'characters', 'Kjartan', 'Gudrun', 'not', 'really', 'portray', 'story', 'written', 'saga']",Viking Sagas VHS
