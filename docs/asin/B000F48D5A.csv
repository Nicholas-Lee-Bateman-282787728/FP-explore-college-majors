There are really not entertaining aspects to this film, which is an accomplishment since it starred Alyson Michalka.The Plot: Aly and AJ Michalka come across like Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie in `The Simple Life' as pop tarts in a small farming community. Their single father the richest man in town owns the local pasteurization plant.The girls think it will be fun to work at the plant during their father's overseas vacation. But their follies at the factory are not sexy or funny. Instead they are vindictively ridiculed by the envious employees. ""Let's face it you and your sister are nothing but a couple of spoiled brats."" Not something I recommend saying to your boss's daughters.Within a matter of days the plant faces a bankruptcy from which it cannot recover. Putting the entire town out of work. It's up to the girls to save the whole town.Sadly, none of this is entertaining in any way. Even a die hard Alyson fan like me was disappointed.
