Here someone has the ability to make a Lizzie Borden movie, and they don't take the small amount of time to check their facts.  I think Christina Ricci was good as Lizzie.  Tho she had brown eyes in the movie, Lizzie was known for her steel blue-gray eyes.  But Ms. Ricci did a good job acting and using her eyes.  (I wonder if they could have put blue contact lenses on her.  That would have been much better.)  The Borden house was made to look pretty cutesy.  It was a boring house, plain, almost foreboding, painted a &#34;drab&#34; color.  I understand that the owner of the murder house/ B & B today was never contacted about the movie.  Lizzie's father was good, but they could have taken the time to make him have white hair and beard.  The casting of Abby was lousy.  By just getting hold of a couple people who know the case well, it could have been the best movie ever made about Lizzie.  People in the story were missing.  Lizzie was saying some of her lines at the wrong time and not to the correct person(s).  Lizzie's story did not end after the trial.  I wish they would have continued into her life at Maplecroft.

Not only was it about the famous ax murders from back in the day but it stared the excellent Christina Ricci. I had to see it with all those things added in plus the trailer looked excellent. So the next week we loaded up and went to my grandparents house again since they wanted to see it as well.Massachusetts 1892 and Lizzie Borden is just living her life normally day by day. That is until she walks in to find her father murdered on the coach. The town is shocked as something like this is not the normal murder. The police are under pressure to solve the case as it turns out Mr. Borden&#8217;s wife was also found murdered upstairs. The only odd thing about this is no one saw any one coming or going that was not supposed to be there. So the suspect list is virtually no existent except for one, the woman who found the first body, Lizzie.I was so excited for this flick and just like I thought I enjoyed it. Ricci is excellent here as the alleged ax murderer and plays the part perfectly, particularly in the trial scenes. The film shows everything from before the murders, murders, trial and of course aftermath. It is the aftermath that I found particularly interesting. In fact the ending is not all that hard to believe, you&#8217;ll see. Everyone else in the flick is good and I love the time period of the film, I know it really was that time since this is a true story but  I love the look. The only downfall is the rushed feel and the lack of development for characters and events. Director Nick Gomez [New Jersey Drive among others] may be at fault but I feel like it was the script from Stephen Kay [director of Boogeyman].Still this was a good flick for a TV production from Lifetime. I loved the look of the film and Ricci was absolutely perfect for the role. Ricci is one of my all time favorite actresses plus I think she is beautiful. So the film had all that going for it.

Christina Ricci is a competent actress but she couldn't have been more wrong for the part of Lizzie.  Lizzie was a large, substantial woman and I doubt very seriously that she gave off the mad, buggy-eyed stare that we got continually from Ricci, but that's a minor quibble.  Far worse was the appalling lack of attention to detail given by the script writers.  A simple google search would have clued them on the facts of the case but, of course, they had to re-write the story to suit their preconceived notions and 21st century mindset.  The list of errors is too long to go into here but one of the most egregious mistakes was the affair of the burning of the dress.  Lizzie burned it in the kitchen stove telling everyone who would listen that it had paint stains and needed to be got rid of.  All the drama with Emma covering up for her and the big dramatic scent of the burning of the dress in a cauldron in the yard for &#34;no particular reason&#34; with Alice watching in horror from an upstairs window was pure fiction. The real Borden house was nothing like the house used for filming.  I doubt very seriously that the real Lizzie would have been at all unhappy with that grand house.  Stealing money and mirrors?  Please.  The plunging neckline wardrobe and lack of or poor hat choices was completely silly and anachronistic.  I could go on.  And don't get me started on the soundtrack - what nitwit came up with that idea!  My husband has often jokingly said that Hollywood conceives and writes many of their scripts while getting high at coke parties.  After seeing &#34;Lizzie Borden Took an Axe&#34;, I don't doubt it.For a more authentic re-telling of Lizzie's story, watch &#34;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&#34; with Elizabeth Montgomery.

1693226,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00I208ZHA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","While I would hesitate to call the Lifetime Original ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" a particularly good movie, I did find it strangely appealing. It's been a while since anyone took on a serious interpretation of the notorious Lizzie Borden. Most movies that invoke Borden make her a boogeyman character or a cheesy horror villain. Although I was very young, I still recall the 1975 TV production of ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" with Elizabeth Montgomery and that was considered scandalous for its time. Well, television has evolved and the Borden story no longer courts controversy. This production boasts a better than average (for Lifetime) cast that includes Christina Ricci, Billy Campbell, Clea Duvall, Gregg Henry, and Stephen McHattie. And while it shares the gruesomeness of the Borden murders, it doesn't shed much new light or insight into the case. With a ninety minute running time, this adaptation hits the salient points of the murders, their aftermath and the subsequent trial without ever digging too deeply into the character that is Lizzy Borden. The real woman appears to have been somewhat of an enigma, and that's exactly how she remains.The movie begins with a mass of contradictions as we meet the Borden sisters (Ricci and Duvall), their father (McHattie) and their stepmother. Ricci, with her gaunt face and wide eyes, makes the most of her period garb and looks great. At first, though, she is portrayed as both willfully independent AND repressed by her overbearing father. She is also painted as a loner and outsider AND someone who is popular and attends local parties. I got so many mixed messages within the screenplay, it was hard to figure out exactly who Lizzie Borden was supposed to be. She was a brat, a victim, or both and these different components never sat very comfortably together. One fateful day, the Borden elders meet an untimely end and it looks like Lizzie (who was home at the time) is the primary suspect. The movie isn't played for mystery, though, we see Ricci doing all manner of suspicious things and so we know she is guilty from the presentation. The second half of the movie concerns the prosecution and trial of Miss Borden (with Campbell on the defense and Henry as opposing counsel). At best, this dramatization is perfunctory in the legal proceedings but it still remains fairly entertaining.Is ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" a great movie? Not even close. But stylistically, it is better than most for Lifetime. The movie's budget is apparent as all the exterior shots seem to be on one tranquil little road. And in an interesting choice, the movie's soundtrack is loaded with anachronistic songs that you will either love or hate. Personally, I thought they added an fascinating dimension to the teleplay. In the end, it is probably Ricci that sells this story. She makes the most with the material and that was enough for me. At about 3 1/2 stars, I enjoyed watching ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" once. I don't know that I would pay for it or even buy a DVD version of it. My recommendation (as the movie seems to be somewhat divisive): catch it for free on Lifetime before committing to a purchase.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 3]","&#34;Lizzie Borden took an axeAnd gave her mother forty whacks.When she saw what she had done,She gave her father forty-one.&#34;The Lizzie Borden murder case is legendary.  I recall first hearing about it when I was a child in the late 1940s.  A few years later, it was the subject of a satiric number in the hit Broadway musical, NEW FACES OF 1952.Surprisingly, with the exception of an acclaimed 1975 television movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery, Hollywood and other filmmakers have only taken a passing interest in Lizzie Borden and the 1892 brutal murder of her parents in Fall River, Massachusetts.  Lizzie was tried and acquitted for that crime and, officially, the killings remain unsolved to this day.In LIZZIE BORDEN TOOK AN AXE, writer Stephen Kay and director Nick Gomez leave no doubt as to their belief that Ms. Borden carried out the dastardly deed.  In advance of the killings, they even show Lizzie laying the groundwork for an alternate theory of the crime and, as with the Elizabeth Montgomery version, she avoids getting blood on her clothing by committing the murders in the nude.Christina Ricci delivers a compelling performance as Lizzie, playing the 32-year old woman almost like a rebellious teen who is guilty of shoplifting and other small thefts, as well as having incestuous feelings toward her staid father (Stephen McHattie).  Also in the capable cast are Clea DuVall, Gregg Henry, Billy Campbell and Sara Botsford.LIZZIE BORDEN TOOK AN AXE is a television movie, shot in Canada and released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

1693233,A446PJ96JQX4X,B00I208ZHA,Sonya@Hollywood,"[5, 10]","""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" is fascinating and keeps you glued to your seat! Christina Ricci in the title role as Lizzie Borden gives a disturbing and complex performance as the accused hatchet killer. Her cool demeanor and flashes of innocent smiles leaves chills. The infamous crime of the century has been retold in numerous television and film versions including one with Elizabeth Montgomery, (of ""Bewitched"" fame) who was an actual distant relative of Lizzie Borden herself. I enjoyed the 1975 made for television movie and thought Elizabeth Montgomery was excellent. But this version with Christina Ricci is morbidly entertaining with a wonderful cast that includes talented Clea DuvVall as Lizzie's older sister, Emma Borden. DuvVall is convincing and the scenes between the Borden sisters are powerful. The scene of Lizzie burning her dress and her sister's confrontation, is memorable and raises more questions. Director Nick Gomez born in Massachusetts, probably grew up hearing about the grisly murders and does a good job captivating the audience in ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" both in and out of the courtroom. There are underlying hints of an inappropriate relationship between Andrew Borden and his youngest daughter Lizzie in certain scenes. Accused of striking her father 11 times with an ax and delivering the 19 fatal blows to her stepmother, Lizzie Borden made national and international news in 1892. After more than 120 years, it remains one of the most talked about unsolved crimes in history. The ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" film includes quick edits of the ax forcibly coming down in flashbacks and allows one's imagination to run wild. The bluegrass rock and roll soundtrack surprisingly works in key scenes as when the horse and carriage frenetically rushes Lizzie Borden to the inquest. As much as has been written about Lizzie Borden, this movie manages to reel in the viewer as curious sleuth to peel more layers and investigate the events and motive leading up to the murders. ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" is campy and compelling at the same time. The film recreates the Borden home and the town of Fall Rivers, Massachusetts, and costumes with believable accuracy. The film's direction, cinematography, editing, and all around good performances add intrigue and make this an overall interesting film. The exchange between the two Borden sisters and Emma's facial expressions in the last scene without any dialogue is powerful and not to be missed!",4,"Disturbing, Compelling and Morbidly Entertaining",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2475,"['Lizzie', 'Borden', 'Took', 'Ax', 'fascinating', 'keeps', 'glued', 'seat', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'title', 'role', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'disturbing', 'complex', 'performance', 'accused', 'hatchet', 'killer', 'cool', 'demeanor', 'flashes', 'innocent', 'smiles', 'chills', 'infamous', 'crime', 'century', 'been', 'retold', 'numerous', 'television', 'film', 'versions', 'including', 'one', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Bewitched', 'fame', 'who', 'was', 'actual', 'distant', 'relative', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'enjoyed', '1975', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'thought', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'was', 'excellent', 'version', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'morbidly', 'entertaining', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'talented', 'Clea', 'DuvVall', 'Lizzie', 'older', 'sister', 'Emma', 'Borden', 'DuvVall', 'convincing', 'scenes', 'Borden', 'sisters', 'are', 'powerful', 'scene', 'Lizzie', 'burning', 'dress', 'sister', 'confrontation', 'memorable', 'more', 'questions', 'Director', 'Nick', 'Gomez', 'born', 'Massachusetts', 'probably', 'grew', 'up', 'hearing', 'grisly', 'murders', 'good', 'job', 'captivating', 'audience', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'Took', 'Ax', 'courtroom', 'are', 'underlying', 'hints', 'inappropriate', 'relationship', 'Andrew', 'Borden', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Lizzie', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Accused', 'striking', 'father', '11', 'times', 'ax', 'delivering', '19', 'fatal', 'blows', 'stepmother', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'made', 'national', 'international', 'news', '1892', 'more', '120', 'years', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'unsolved', 'crimes', 'history', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'Took', 'Ax', 'film', 'quick', 'edits', 'ax', 'forcibly', 'coming', 'down', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'imagination', 'run', 'wild', 'bluegrass', 'rock', 'roll', 'soundtrack', 'surprisingly', 'key', 'scenes', 'when', 'horse', 'carriage', 'frenetically', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'inquest', 'As', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'movie', 'reel', 'viewer', 'curious', 'sleuth', 'peel', 'more', 'layers', 'investigate', 'events', 'motive', 'leading', 'up', 'murders', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'Took', 'Ax', 'campy', 'compelling', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'Borden', 'home', 'town', 'Fall', 'Rivers', 'Massachusetts', 'costumes', 'believable', 'accuracy', 'film', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'around', 'good', 'performances', 'add', 'intrigue', 'make', 'overall', 'interesting', 'film', 'exchange', 'two', 'Borden', 'sisters', 'Emma', 'facial', 'expressions', 'last', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'powerful', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

When the police begin to investigate all the evidence points to Lizzie. Her lawyer comes up with the only defense available. How could a woman kill anyone in that fashion? First of all this is a Lifetime movie so those of you looking for gore and horror can look elsewhere. The movie isn't bad but is glaringly obvious that this is a low budget made for TV movie. The story of this murder is very intriguing and is a good idea for a movie, but the fact that Lifetime did it really tones down what could be a great movie. Christina Ricci is the perfect choice for this role and she is really the only thing that saves the movie. Most of the movie is a courtroom drama which I usually love and the defense that a petite woman couldn't do this is very interesting and shows what the country used to be like.
