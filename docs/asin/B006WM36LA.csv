1521237,A2PRIS802TKFD1,B006WM36LA,Amy Leigh,"[2, 2]","I read some reviews that made it sound like this was your average Simon Pegg film. I disagree, but not in a bad way. I am a huge fan of his work, and was looking forward to his usual brand of comedy. Athough his comedic timing is similar, and he still has a slapstick kind of charm, this is so much darker than his other films. It's very dark, albeit creepy at times, a comedy that didn't have me in stitches like his other films, but I still quite enjoyed it. I think the best way to enjoy this film is to know that you are not watching the ilk of Hot Fuzz or Run, Fat Boy, Run. This is a good film, and I can see watching it again - although, I don't think it'll be among my favorites of his work.",4,Not your normal Simon Pegg film,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,699,"['read', 'reviews', 'made', 'was', 'average', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'film', 'disagree', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'work', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'usual', 'brand', 'comedy', 'comedic', 'timing', 'similar', 'still', 'slapstick', 'kind', 'charm', 'so', 'much', 'darker', 'other', 'films', 'very', 'dark', 'albeit', 'creepy', 'times', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'stitches', 'other', 'films', 'still', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'enjoy', 'film', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 'ilk', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Run', 'Fat', 'Boy', 'Run', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'favorites', 'work']",Fantastic Fear of Everything

Clean socks and underwear.People are used to Simon Pegg either playing comic roles in funny movies (&#34;Hot Fuzz,&#34; &#34;Shawn of the Dead&#34;), or playing slightly less comic roles in serious movies (&#34;Star Trek&#34;). But &#34;A Fantastic Fear Of Everything&#34; brings up blinding, frothing-at-the-mouth terror in some of the weirdest places -- a weird black comedy with a somewhat unbalanced structure.Children's author Jack (Pegg) is currently working on a nonfiction book about serial killers... which has turned him into a paranoid delusional mess who can barely leave his squalid apartment. He's convinced that a serial killer called the Hanoi Handshake killer is coming after him.Then his agent informs him that a Hollywood type named Harvey Humphries wants to see his book, and it's his only chance of selling it. The meeting is at 8 p.m. Unfortunately, Jack has no clean clothes -- and in his frantic attempt to clean his underwear and socks, he ends up burning off half his hair and super-gluing a knife to his hand. And he still has no clean clothes.Unfortunately, he also has a crippling fear of laundrettes (aka laundromats), due to his mother abandoning him there. But on the advice of his psychiatrist, he sets out to confront his fear and do his laundry in time for his meeting... only to unleash mayhem in the laundrette, and encounter something that he really SHOULD be afraid of.&#34;A Fantastic Fear of Everything&#34; is a much darker movie than most of Simon Pegg's previous movies -- the comedy here can be black as charcoal, even though it is still wickedly funny. Lots of Jack lurching around in his distorted little world, frantically trying to wash and dry his underpants and socks in the stove.Director Crispian Mills makes everything look oddly distorted and nightmarish, from the squalid, smoky darkness of Jack's apartment to the bleak laundrette. It makes a nice illustration of how weird and crazy the world looks to Jack, and Pegg's narration keeps the story flowing.However, it's also very uneven. The first two acts are almost like a one-man show; while a few people (his agent, some singing kids) pierce Jack's haze of delusion, he's mostly lurching around and monologuing in his own head. His quest is to get fresh socks and underwear, while avoiding being arrested. Simple, except for his crippling fear and awkwardness.But in the last act, we suddenly switch to a more conventional narrative, with a villain and a love interest to interact with. It feels like we stepped into a different movie -- one that's still connected to the first by a few plot threads, but very different in style and theme.Simon Pegg is the reason this movie works at all -- this is an uproariously funny actor who knows how to play his comedic roles straight. Jack is both pitiable and funny. You pity him because he's clearly messed-up and miserable, but Pegg manages to make him amusing with the constant onslaught of bad luck.&#34;A Fantastic Fear of Everything&#34; has a weird lopsided structure that makes you feel like a different movie shoved itself into the last half. However, the pitch-black comedy and Simon Pegg mean that it's still fairly entertaining.",3,Writers and serial killers are very similar,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3232,"['Hedgehogs', 'Serial', 'killers', 'Laundrettes', 'Clean', 'socks', 'underwear.People', 'are', 'used', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'playing', 'comic', 'roles', 'funny', 'movies', '34', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', '34', '34', 'Shawn', 'Dead', '34', 'playing', 'slightly', 'less', 'comic', 'roles', 'serious', 'movies', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', '34', '34', 'A', 'Fantastic', 'Fear', 'Everything', '34', 'up', 'blinding', 'frothing-at-the-mouth', 'terror', 'weirdest', 'places', 'weird', 'black', 'comedy', 'somewhat', 'unbalanced', 'structure.Children', 'author', 'Jack', 'Pegg', 'currently', 'working', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'serial', 'killers', 'turned', 'paranoid', 'delusional', 'mess', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'leave', 'squalid', 'apartment', 'convinced', 'serial', 'killer', 'called', 'Hanoi', 'Handshake', 'killer', 'coming', 'him.Then', 'agent', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'named', 'Harvey', 'Humphries', 'see', 'book', 'only', 'chance', 'selling', 'meeting', '8', 'p.m', 'Unfortunately', 'Jack', 'clean', 'clothes', 'frantic', 'attempt', 'clean', 'underwear', 'socks', 'up', 'burning', 'off', 'hair', 'super-gluing', 'knife', 'hand', 'still', 'clean', 'clothes.Unfortunately', 'also', 'crippling', 'fear', 'laundrettes', 'laundromats', 'due', 'mother', 'abandoning', 'there', 'advice', 'psychiatrist', 'out', 'confront', 'fear', 'do', 'laundry', 'time', 'meeting', 'only', 'unleash', 'mayhem', 'laundrette', 'encounter', 'something', 'really', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'afraid', 'of.', '34', 'A', 'Fantastic', 'Fear', 'Everything', '34', 'much', 'darker', 'movie', 'most', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'previous', 'movies', 'comedy', 'here', 'can', 'be', 'black', 'charcoal', 'even', 'still', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'Lots', 'Jack', 'lurching', 'around', 'distorted', 'little', 'world', 'frantically', 'trying', 'wash', 'dry', 'underpants', 'socks', 'stove.Director', 'Crispian', 'Mills', 'everything', 'look', 'oddly', 'distorted', 'nightmarish', 'squalid', 'smoky', 'darkness', 'Jack', 'apartment', 'bleak', 'laundrette', 'nice', 'illustration', 'how', 'weird', 'crazy', 'world', 'Jack', 'Pegg', 'narration', 'story', 'flowing.However', 'also', 'very', 'uneven', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'are', 'almost', 'one-man', 'show', 'few', 'people', 'agent', 'singing', 'kids', 'pierce', 'Jack', 'haze', 'delusion', 'mostly', 'lurching', 'around', 'monologuing', 'own', 'head', 'quest', 'get', 'fresh', 'socks', 'underwear', 'avoiding', 'being', 'arrested', 'Simple', 'crippling', 'fear', 'awkwardness.But', 'last', 'act', 'suddenly', 'switch', 'more', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'villain', 'love', 'interest', 'interact', 'stepped', 'different', 'movie', 'one', 'still', 'connected', 'first', 'few', 'plot', 'threads', 'very', 'different', 'style', 'theme.Simon', 'Pegg', 'reason', 'movie', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'actor', 'who', 'how', 'play', 'comedic', 'roles', 'straight', 'Jack', 'pitiable', 'funny', 'pity', 'clearly', 'messed-up', 'miserable', 'Pegg', 'make', 'amusing', 'constant', 'onslaught', 'bad', 'luck.', '34', 'A', 'Fantastic', 'Fear', 'Everything', '34', 'weird', 'lopsided', 'structure', 'feel', 'different', 'movie', 'shoved', 'last', 'half', 'However', 'pitch-black', 'comedy', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'mean', 'still', 'fairly', 'entertaining']",Fantastic Fear of Everything
1521239,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B006WM36LA,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","I like Simon Pegg. I think he's a natural talent and has a great comedic presence. Here he strays from his usual course, but not too far.Here's the scoop. Pegg plays a failed children's book author now working on writing a TV series on serial killers. He's so steeped in he process he becomes paranoid to the point of being agoraphobic. He figures he's being stalked by a killer. But he needs to make a meeting with a TV producer to pitch his project. Can he overcome his issues to make the date?This is a bit of an odd set-up. You don't see him in the process of degenerating into his madness. You see him when he's fully 'round the bend, so the rather clueless Simon from previous films is not here and I do miss him. He does play the character well though he takes a time out to up the entertainment level with his lip-synch to a gangster rap tune. It's a lot of fun but a noticeable departure from the proceedings. There is also a medium share of farce and physical humor which he handles well. It gets a bit odd in the third act but it rounds out seemingly loose stuff from the first two acts.This IS a fun flick. Maybe not quite worth the four stars I gave it but Pegg is always a hoot to watch so it goes down easy. If you like your comedy with a bit of thrills this should suit you fine.",4,Maybe Not so Fantastic,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,1295,"['like', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'think', 'natural', 'talent', 'great', 'comedic', 'presence', 'Here', 'usual', 'course', 'not', 'too', 'scoop', 'Pegg', 'failed', 'children', 'book', 'author', 'now', 'working', 'writing', 'TV', 'series', 'serial', 'killers', 'so', 'steeped', 'process', 'paranoid', 'point', 'being', 'agoraphobic', 'being', 'stalked', 'killer', 'make', 'meeting', 'TV', 'producer', 'pitch', 'project', 'Can', 'overcome', 'issues', 'make', 'date', 'bit', 'odd', 'set-up', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'process', 'degenerating', 'madness', 'see', 'when', 'fully', ""'round"", 'bend', 'rather', 'clueless', 'Simon', 'previous', 'films', 'not', 'here', 'do', 'play', 'character', 'well', 'time', 'out', 'up', 'entertainment', 'level', 'lip-synch', 'gangster', 'rap', 'tune', 'lot', 'fun', 'noticeable', 'departure', 'proceedings', 'also', 'medium', 'share', 'farce', 'physical', 'humor', 'well', 'bit', 'odd', 'third', 'act', 'out', 'seemingly', 'loose', 'stuff', 'first', 'two', 'acts.This', 'fun', 'flick', 'Maybe', 'not', 'quite', 'four', 'stars', 'gave', 'Pegg', 'always', 'hoot', 'watch', 'down', 'easy', 'like', 'comedy', 'bit', 'thrills', 'should', 'suit', 'fine']",Fantastic Fear of Everything
1521240,A3GPFTYWN7LQ48,B006WM36LA,FilmFanatic,"[2, 2]","I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, as I'm sure a lot of people are. As I'm sure you are if you're thinking about getting this flick. I have friends that don't like or get British humor, but they LOVE Simon Pegg and his movies! Shaun of the Dead, The World's End and ESPECIALLY Hot Fuzz I consider to be near perfect comedies! I even find something to enjoy in some of his lesser movies like How To Lose Friends And Alienate People. But an actor's natural charm can only keep you interested for so long. In a nutshell, the writing and directing isn't up to par with the actor performing it. After about a half an hour of waiting for this movie to draw me in, it was actually turning me off. If Simon Pegg's name wasn't on this, I probably wouldn't have known about it or wanted to see it as much. The concept of a children's author who makes the sudden turn to write adult murder mysteries is a good draw that offers a ton of hilarious possibilities, but rarely do they take advantage of it! Pegg does his best with what he's given, but the story overall doesn't really build or amount to anything in the end nor does it make you laugh that much along the way. Now there was a scene or two that did make me chuckle, but really it wasn't worth the hour and a half time it took to finish this movie. Even if you ARE a fan of Simon Pegg, I suggest you rent this before you spend twenty something bucks to buy it. And if you're not a fan, I wouldn't even bother.

That's why I went ahead and jumped on watching this &#34;before it's in theaters&#34; movie.  All in all, the movie is just ok.  A large portion of the movie is Simon's character by himself.  It actually has the feel of a one man play with Simon's character acting while a voice-over plays.  That's a LOT of pressure for an actor and Simon acquits himself very well.  The part is well played and convincing.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't really encourage you to bond with the character nor is it very engrossing.  Ultimately the movie is a series of humorous one-off scenarios loosely strung together.  Simon is by far the best actor and most convincing.
