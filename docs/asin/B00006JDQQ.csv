They would battle all kinds of villains in almost every cartoon. Their number 1 nemesis was none other than the Frog. It was the Frog who Couroageous Cat and Minute Mouse were after in quite a few cartoons. He was always caught in the end and wound up back in prison where he belonged. Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse are two heroes who save Empire City everytime the Police Chief of the Empire City Police Department summons them to know that some evil individual is on the loose. It is up to our heroes to bring them to justice. For all those times I have watched Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse do battle with all the great villains they faced including the Frog, the Black Cat, Professor Shaggy Dog, Rodney the Rodent, Big Shot, Little Shot, Robber Rabbit, Foxy Fox and other notable perpitrators of evil trying to make things misserable for all of Empire City. Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse will save the day and put each and every one of them behind bars.",5,Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse: The other dynamic duo,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,1091,"['Courageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'bring', 'back', 'lots', 'memories', 'used', 'watch', 'day', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'school', 'would', 'battle', 'kinds', 'villains', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'number', '1', 'nemesis', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Frog', 'was', 'Frog', 'who', 'Couroageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'cartoons', 'was', 'always', 'caught', 'end', 'wound', 'up', 'back', 'prison', 'where', 'belonged', 'Courageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'are', 'two', 'heroes', 'who', 'save', 'Empire', 'City', 'everytime', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Empire', 'City', 'Police', 'Department', 'know', 'evil', 'individual', 'loose', 'heroes', 'bring', 'justice', 'times', 'have', 'watched', 'Courageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'do', 'battle', 'great', 'villains', 'faced', 'including', 'Frog', 'Black', 'Cat', 'Professor', 'Shaggy', 'Dog', 'Rodney', 'Rodent', 'Big', 'Shot', 'Little', 'Shot', 'Robber', 'Rabbit', 'Foxy', 'Fox', 'other', 'notable', 'perpitrators', 'evil', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'misserable', 'Empire', 'City', 'Courageous', 'Cat', 'Minute', 'Mouse', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'put', 'one', 'bars']",N/A
717581,AAW9MMCD02AT2,B00006JDQQ,Delton T. Horn,"[9, 19]","If Batman had been concieved for a ""funny animals"" comic book, this would be the result.  It's not a spoof, so much as a shifting of the concept in a different environment.  I find it fairly entertaining with a couple amusing gags in almost each cartoon, but it is severely hampered by the five minute episode format -- there just isn't much story that can be built up.  It's a shame Bob Kane wasn't given a chance to work with somewhat longer stories to add a little depth.  Still it is very interesting to see how Kane adapted his Batman concept to a totally different framework.It's a shame they didn't bother to digitally remaster this material.  It is watchable but the age definitely shows.As other reviewers have said, it plays best if you watch only 2 to 4 episodes at a sitting.  Of course, this is true of most short cartoons (Looney Tunes is the only series I can think of that holds up well to marathon viewing.)  These cartoons were never intended to be watched for hours at a time.My biggest complaint with this set is that it is just too much.  Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse was a decent series and deserves release, but does anyone really need all 130 episodes?  It wasn't that popular or significant.  I think it would have been better served with a single disc ""best of"" collection.One final quibble -- Minute Mouse's voice tends to get on my nerves.  It makes sense for a mouse to have a squeaky voice, but his is just a bit too squeaky for comfort.

717582,A56JCTQB5FSQB,B00006JDQQ,"""dpurves""","[20, 22]","I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that there was a DVD set for this old series.  I can remember watching it way back when I was a little kid in the 70s, but I had no idea there were 130 episodes.  I had to buy it.As I watched the first disk I was sure I'd made a mistake.  These cartoons were bad.  Bad to the point of being barely watchable.  Choppy animation and ridiculous plots.  But as I kept watching they grew on me all over again.  Yes, they're bad, but they're so bad they're good.  By the second disk I was hooked, and I couldn't wait for each subsequent episode.  I think the best episodes were some of the strangest, such as the one Cold War shows with the two spies, and Marilyn Mouse, and the constant mentions of atomic weapons.  I have to admit that I felt pretty sad when the last episode ended and the menu popped back up.  Unlike so many shows which occasionally pop up in other incarnations, the end for this one really was the end.  Still, I'd love to see a movie version of this someday.The shows hold up amazingly well after 40+ years.  So much of it is dated, but it's still a simple, somewhat innocent fun.  My one complaint with the DVD is that the episodes don't seem to be in order ; either that, or this show has the worst continuity imaginable.  But this I can certainly overlook, since it was so much fun to revisit this classic from my childhood.",4,Great fun!,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,1382,"['could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'DVD', 'set', 'old', 'series', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', '70s', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'were', '130', 'episodes', 'had', 'buy', 'it.As', 'watched', 'first', 'disk', 'was', 'sure', ""'d"", 'made', 'mistake', 'cartoons', 'were', 'bad', 'Bad', 'point', 'being', 'barely', 'watchable', 'Choppy', 'animation', 'ridiculous', 'plots', 'kept', 'watching', 'grew', 'over', 'again', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'bad', ""'re"", 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'good', 'second', 'disk', 'was', 'hooked', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'subsequent', 'episode', 'think', 'best', 'episodes', 'were', 'strangest', 'such', 'one', 'Cold', 'War', 'two', 'spies', 'Marilyn', 'Mouse', 'constant', 'mentions', 'atomic', 'weapons', 'have', 'admit', 'felt', 'pretty', 'sad', 'when', 'last', 'episode', 'ended', 'menu', 'popped', 'back', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'occasionally', 'pop', 'up', 'other', 'incarnations', 'end', 'one', 'really', 'was', 'end', 'Still', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'version', 'someday.The', 'hold', 'up', 'amazingly', 'well', '40+', 'years', 'So', 'much', 'dated', 'still', 'simple', 'somewhat', 'innocent', 'fun', 'one', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'order', 'show', 'worst', 'continuity', 'imaginable', 'can', 'certainly', 'overlook', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'revisit', 'classic', 'childhood']",N/A

These cartoons are typical early 60's fare and 100% nostalgia. If you're looking for the fantastic art like early Fleischer, Disney or Warner Brothers, forget it. This is TV stuff...quickly made...not much detail...but it is very cool to see these cartoons that have been kept hidden for so many years. Courageous Cat is not your typical save-the-day, not-do-anything-wrong hero. He screws up on occasion, makes errors in judgement and is actually more of a regular guy trying to be a hero! I don't think it was intended that way, but that's how it comes across. Minute Mouse, on the other hand, could've been a lot better if they hadn't decided to use a high, irritating voice. The Frog, an Edward G. Robinson-type villain, is always fun to watch. Included is an essayed biography of Courageous Cat's creator, Bob Kane, creator of Batman (there are many similarities between these two characters).

About the best part of the series is the theme music and intro.  I remember little else about the series, having last seen it nearly 30 years ago (!) in black & white.  Watching these episodes again I find that instead of being fun, the series is ludicrous: the animation is bad, the plots are nonsensical, Courageous Cat's gun-for-every-situation is ridiculous and Minute Mouse is 100% useless; it almost boggles the mind that 130 of these cartoons were created.  As another reviewer stated, these shorts can get tiresome quickly and watching no more than 3 or 4 at a time is recommended.  Unfortunately, I rented the first disc from Netflix.com and, not wanting to hold onto the disc too long, am forcing myself to watch 11 shorts at a stretch (good thing they're only 5 minutes long) so I can send it back from whence it came as soon as possible.

Growing up in NYC, this was on channel 7 (ABC) early in the morning, and all us kids (at that time) thought of channel 7 as the cheesiest station in the city so, of course, they had the cheesiest cartoons--the cheesiest being Courageous Cat. Still, I plan to buy this set and tho I don't own it yet, I have a lot of these crummy cartoons on video tape and have seen them recently.Why give it 4 stars after knocking it so much? Well, somehow CC & MM managed to be entertaining, even now after all these years.
