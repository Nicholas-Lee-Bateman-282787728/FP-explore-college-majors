1131170,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B0011FLGV0,Allan M. Lees,"[9, 9]","In a world of crass comedy-by-numbers in which insensitivity masquerades as ""edgy"" this series is something quite different. The comedy is low-key and never cruel, and even the minor characters get developed enough along the way to be interesting. While the first episode initially seems as if it's going to be too mechanical, Laurie's character Paul develops quickly enough for us to be touched by the humanity of the guy. And that's what is central to this series: in the middle of all the quotidian upsets and misunderstandings, in a world in which everyone is too busy to connect, Paul struggles always to do the right thing in a confusing world even though he is never encouraged or acknowledged. It would have been very easy to write a series in which the middle-aged man is an object of ridicule; instead, this series cleverly sets up all the standard tropes but turns it around by enabling us to empathize and sympathize with Paul.One of the core themes is the fact that Paul and his wife Estelle have't had sex for so long that he can no longer remember the last time they did it. On the surface this could be an indictment of Paul - classic old guy, losing his ability and his memory, isn't it funny, etc. But instead of this obvious stock approach we see Paul struggling to find ways to reconnect to his wife, whom he adores, even though she's now moving out of the family orbit and back into the world of work. He tries to support her even though she gives him a hard time. Laurie is excellent at conveying Paul's sense of being adrift in the world, of conveying his humanity as he struggles always to do the right thing.Not since the old BBC 2 TV series Butterflies with Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Palmer has there been such a delicate blend of pathos and humor, of vulnerability, confusion and old-fashioned family values. It's charming and heart-warming. And there are some great cameos from the supporting cast.",5,Comedy for the Soul,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,1925,"['world', 'crass', 'comedy-by-numbers', 'insensitivity', 'masquerades', 'edgy', 'series', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'comedy', 'low-key', 'never', 'cruel', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'get', 'developed', 'enough', 'way', 'be', 'interesting', 'first', 'episode', 'initially', 'going', 'be', 'too', 'mechanical', 'Laurie', 'character', 'Paul', 'quickly', 'enough', 'be', 'touched', 'humanity', 'guy', 'what', 'central', 'series', 'middle', 'quotidian', 'upsets', 'misunderstandings', 'world', 'everyone', 'too', 'busy', 'connect', 'Paul', 'always', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'confusing', 'world', 'even', 'never', 'encouraged', 'acknowledged', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'write', 'series', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'object', 'ridicule', 'instead', 'series', 'cleverly', 'up', 'standard', 'tropes', 'around', 'enabling', 'empathize', 'sympathize', 'Paul.One', 'core', 'themes', 'fact', 'Paul', 'wife', 'Estelle', ""have't"", 'had', 'sex', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'did', 'surface', 'could', 'be', 'indictment', 'Paul', 'classic', 'old', 'guy', 'losing', 'ability', 'memory', ""n't"", 'funny', 'etc', 'instead', 'obvious', 'stock', 'approach', 'see', 'Paul', 'struggling', 'find', 'ways', 'reconnect', 'wife', 'whom', 'even', 'now', 'moving', 'family', 'orbit', 'back', 'world', 'work', 'support', 'even', 'hard', 'time', 'Laurie', 'excellent', 'conveying', 'Paul', 'sense', 'being', 'adrift', 'world', 'conveying', 'humanity', 'always', 'do', 'right', 'thing.Not', 'old', 'BBC', '2', 'TV', 'series', 'Butterflies', 'Wendy', 'Craig', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'there', 'been', 'delicate', 'blend', 'pathos', 'humor', 'vulnerability', 'confusion', 'old-fashioned', 'family', 'values', 'charming', 'heart-warming', 'are', 'great', 'cameos', 'supporting', 'cast']",Fortysomething

I am so happy I bought it! It is absolutely brilliant; Hugh's character, Paul, is somewhat of a cross between House and Wooster. I simply adore this show; the first episode in particular is truly hilarious: one of the many high points is when two of Paul's adult sons are fighting over a girl and Paul orders them to go to their rooms. Sex is a major theme throughout the series; one of the running jokes is that Paul can't remember the last time he and his wife have made love while his sons spend most of their time fighting over a pair of sisters. In spite of the sexual elements, I found the show to be refreshingly tasteful, especially compared to the majority of American shows. Further more, its obvious, at least in my opinion,  that in spite of their problems, Paul and his wife were still quite devoted to one another. I'm sorry to say that I'm probably not explaining this show very well, but I can assure you that this is one of the best dvd purchases I've made in a very long time.

I'm also a 45 year old male and after learning about what's in store for the economy, thanks to Gerald Celente, I'm having a mid life crisis of my own.  So after reading the description on the back of the box, I was pretty sure this was going to be the best that entertainment has to offer and the funniest of comedies.Turns out I am very disappointed.  I know what Hugh Laurie is capable of!  And this doesn't begin to tap into his acting talent.The acting in general is forced, stiff and unbelievable.  Consequently, the characters come across as flat.Ever watch a show where you want to know the characters names, and end up knowing them early on?  Not the case here.  I can barely remember the last name of the guy Hugh Laurie plays, Mr. Slippery or some such.I realize British comedy IS generally stiff, slow and painfully boring at times and often hard to understand or relate to.  Ab Fab comes to mind, however it was rather funny, despite the culture difference.  Mr. Bean was even better, perhaps in part because he is a man of so few words.I will admit that despite its rave reviews, 'The Office' also did nothing for me.  Same goes for 'Weeds'.However nearly all the other shows I've watched have been amazingly entertaining.  The list includes shows like 'The Wire', 'Dexter', 'Desperate Housewives', 'United States of Tara', 'Criminal Minds', 'Numb3rs', 'Glee' and so many more!  I'm able to find something rather worthwhile about nearly every show I watch, with the exception of 'Forty Something', 'Weeds', and 'The Office'.So I suppose if you liked 'Weeds' or 'The office' (and I know many, Many of you do), it is possible you may like this show as well.
