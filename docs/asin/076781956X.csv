15223,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,076781956X,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","I have never nor ever will I be a fan of Nicholas Cage.  That aside, `8MM' is a film that I can get behind.  It's dark, disturbing and intriguing despite the fact that Cage couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  His lack of emotional range disgust me, but regardless, `8MM' is a worthwhile cinematic experience.  The subject matter is far from light fare.  It delves into the perverse and downright despicable and hits a nerve with its audience.  There are scenes within `8MM' where my gut is in knots, my heart racing and it's not necessarily out of fear (while there are some downright creepy moments) but more out of pure anger and frustration and deepened sadness.  For a thriller it has a heart of emotional gold because it is able to attach the audience to a character they never meet and bleat for her vindication.Nicholas Cage plays Tom Welles, a Private Investigator who meets an elderly widow distraught over a film she found hidden away within her late husbands belongings.  This very rich man had purchased a pornographic film in which a young woman is brutally murdered.  The first inclination of everyone involved is that it's a fake, a sick joke at that, but the widow insists that Tom investigate so that she can be sure.  It's within this investigation that the audience's emotions are exposed and played with harshly.  Welles delves deep into the world of pornography, legal and illegal, and uncovers things he wished he never had to witness.Cage is nothing but boring here.  His emotionless line readings get overly ridiculous, especially in a film like this where emotion is demanded of the audience.  I felt as if I was affected more than Cage, and he was the man experiencing the horrors.  I guess I just couldn't believe him.  Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand was fantastic.  He proved here that he is deserving of any and all praise that has been heaped upon him.  A relative unknown at the time he was able to upstage his more famous costar with his ability to remain natural and relaxed and convey so much relatable emotion.  Catherine Keener is decent as Cage's wife, but her performance is short and sweet, not much too really judge on.  Another plus to this film is James Gandolfini who plays the porno slime ball so incredible convincingly.  I loved to loathe him, he was that fantastic.The film does in the end get a little extreme as Welles takes a personal approach to the horrors he uncovers.  But, within all its unrealistic moments it still manages to keep the audience held tightly.  This is one of those cases where the film far outshines its main character, or more so main actor since the character himself could have been much better had a more polished actor been given the role.  The film is one that I would highly recommend with reservations.  As I mentioned, and many others have as well, it's a very dark and disturbing creation with plenty of scenes that will bother you, mentally bother you.  The subject matter is above and beyond horrendous, and it's approached in a very gritty and dark manor.  You're skin will crawl and your stomach will turn long after the credits have rolled, but it's a satisfying feeling knowing that a film has been able to have such a strong impact.",4,Disturbing beyond belief but well worth the feeling...,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,3230,"['have', 'never', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'fan', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'aside', '8MM', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'behind', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'intriguing', 'fact', 'Cage', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'lack', 'emotional', 'range', 'disgust', 'regardless', '8MM', 'worthwhile', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'subject', 'matter', 'far', 'light', 'fare', 'perverse', 'downright', 'despicable', 'nerve', 'audience', 'are', 'scenes', '8MM', 'where', 'gut', 'knots', 'heart', 'racing', 'not', 'necessarily', 'fear', 'are', 'downright', 'creepy', 'moments', 'more', 'pure', 'anger', 'frustration', 'deepened', 'sadness', 'thriller', 'heart', 'emotional', 'gold', 'able', 'attach', 'audience', 'character', 'never', 'meet', 'bleat', 'vindication.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Tom', 'Welles', 'Private', 'Investigator', 'who', 'elderly', 'widow', 'distraught', 'film', 'found', 'hidden', 'away', 'late', 'husbands', 'belongings', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'had', 'purchased', 'pornographic', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'first', 'inclination', 'everyone', 'involved', 'fake', 'sick', 'joke', 'widow', 'Tom', 'investigate', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'investigation', 'audience', 'emotions', 'are', 'exposed', 'played', 'harshly', 'Welles', 'deep', 'world', 'pornography', 'legal', 'illegal', 'uncovers', 'things', 'wished', 'never', 'had', 'witness.Cage', 'nothing', 'boring', 'here', 'emotionless', 'line', 'readings', 'get', 'overly', 'ridiculous', 'especially', 'film', 'where', 'emotion', 'demanded', 'audience', 'felt', 'was', 'affected', 'more', 'Cage', 'was', 'man', 'experiencing', 'horrors', 'guess', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'fantastic', 'proved', 'here', 'deserving', 'praise', 'been', 'heaped', 'relative', 'unknown', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'upstage', 'more', 'famous', 'costar', 'ability', 'remain', 'natural', 'relaxed', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'relatable', 'emotion', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'decent', 'Cage', 'wife', 'performance', 'short', 'sweet', 'not', 'much', 'too', 'really', 'judge', 'plus', 'film', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'porno', 'slime', 'ball', 'so', 'incredible', 'convincingly', 'loved', 'loathe', 'was', 'fantastic.The', 'film', 'end', 'get', 'little', 'extreme', 'Welles', 'personal', 'approach', 'horrors', 'unrealistic', 'moments', 'still', 'keep', 'audience', 'held', 'tightly', 'one', 'cases', 'where', 'film', 'far', 'main', 'character', 'more', 'so', 'main', 'actor', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'polished', 'actor', 'been', 'given', 'role', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reservations', 'mentioned', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'creation', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'will', 'bother', 'mentally', 'subject', 'matter', 'horrendous', 'approached', 'very', 'gritty', 'dark', 'manor', ""'re"", 'skin', 'will', 'crawl', 'stomach', 'will', 'turn', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'satisfying', 'feeling', 'knowing', 'film', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'strong', 'impact']",N/A
15224,A1KNUT2VTGKC9A,076781956X,Anton Yakovlev (yakovlev@wpi.edu),"[1, 1]","There is no doubt that 8mm is a very flawed film that is far from being a masterpiece it might have become under different circumstances. Nicolas Cage's performance has its good sides, and according to his own viewpoint,  it was one of the hardest acting experiences he ever had. However, just  like it was the case in Platoon, the main character's internal struggle and  moral transformation just isn't very visible, which makes the movie look  more aloof than it should be. Sometimes it seems as though Schumacher knows  exactly where to get his characters and what situation should come next,  and he pushes the plot a bit too much to get where it's supposed to get.  The details of Cage's deductive experiments get tedious at times, and there  is much to be said against the director's use of consistently dark  environments, which prematurely depress the viewer and detract from the  shock that is supposed to come later. However, for all its faults, 8mm is a  film that has a heart: a heartbreaking, philosophically significant story  with an important moral messatge. It is clear that for all the wrong  decisions they made along the way, the creators really cared about the  film, and put a lot of thought into it. There is no explicit pornography to  be found anywhere, and the movie is never unnecessarily sleazy. The  director never seeks to thrill you with the forbidden realms of the Los  Angeles/New York underworld, but rather, he seeks to present it as a  disgusting and apprehensive as possible. For all its flaws, I believe that  the movie is well worth watching, and if you don't expect it to be a  first-rate piece of filmmaking, you'll get a lot out of it as far as the  subject itself is concerned.",3,"A flawed, but very unique movie",929491200,"06 16, 1999",1999,1720,"['doubt', '8mm', 'very', 'flawed', 'film', 'far', 'being', 'masterpiece', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'different', 'circumstances', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'performance', 'good', 'sides', 'according', 'own', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'one', 'hardest', 'acting', 'experiences', 'ever', 'had', 'However', 'just', 'was', 'case', 'Platoon', 'main', 'character', 'internal', 'struggle', 'moral', 'transformation', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'visible', 'movie', 'look', 'more', 'aloof', 'should', 'be', 'Sometimes', 'Schumacher', 'exactly', 'where', 'get', 'characters', 'what', 'situation', 'should', 'come', 'next', 'plot', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'where', 'supposed', 'get', 'details', 'Cage', 'deductive', 'experiments', 'get', 'tedious', 'times', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'director', 'use', 'consistently', 'dark', 'environments', 'prematurely', 'depress', 'viewer', 'detract', 'shock', 'supposed', 'come', 'later', 'However', 'faults', '8mm', 'film', 'heart', 'heartbreaking', 'philosophically', 'significant', 'story', 'important', 'moral', 'messatge', 'clear', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'made', 'way', 'creators', 'really', 'cared', 'film', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'explicit', 'pornography', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'never', 'unnecessarily', 'sleazy', 'director', 'never', 'thrill', 'forbidden', 'realms', 'Los', 'Angeles/New', 'York', 'underworld', 'rather', 'present', 'disgusting', 'apprehensive', 'possible', 'flaws', 'believe', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'first-rate', 'piece', 'filmmaking', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'as', 'far', 'subject', 'concerned']",N/A

Having Nicolas Cage on board largely helps. Believe it or not, it is his last good role of his career. The rest of his way has been a series of bombs, and everybody is left with an important question, ""What the hell happened to Nicolas Cage? He used to be a fine actor."" Joaquin Phoenix throws in a nice little weight of his own. Everybody else is more or less a wannabe. Easily the worst performance is Catherine Keener's (when is she ever likeable?). She is like ""Look at me! Look at me! I'm important, dammit!"" Anyway, the plot of 8MM is good and easy to follow, but there is a lot of simplified generalizations which make the film more ridiculous than it appears. Of course, Cage gets his man, and the world is all good and happy. At the same time, he commits several murders because he is the rightful judge, jury, and executioner.

15230,A1PFZHVVACXQYY,076781956X,Bobby Peru,"[1, 1]","Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker is right on the verge of becoming the next big thing in Hollywood. He was the brain behind such great films as ""Se7en"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", and did some uncredited re-writes for ""The Game"" and ""Fight Club."" All those films were excellent, and ""8mm"" could have been too, had it not been handed to Joel Schumacher, the man who ruined the Batman series and who is the biggest hack in Hollywood.(Except for ""Tigerland"", which was a fluke.)The story, born from Walker's brilliant mind, sounds great. A Private Eye(Nicolas Cage), is hired by a billionare's Widow after she found a possible ""snuff"" film in her dead husband's safe. So Nic Cage is sent to find out whether or not the film is real, plunging him into a sordid mystery filled with seedy characters and dark, abandoned buildings(Not a cliche or anything).Could have been good. Should have been good. Would have been good, had A) David Fincher directed like originally planned, B) had Andy Kevin Walker had more creative input, and C) had Joel Schumacher had not taken over directing duties! The guy is horrible.After Walker and Schumacher fought over creative differences, Walker walked, and left Schumacher and Nic ""When's the last time this guy made a good movie?"" Cage to run the show themselves. Want some examples? Okay. When the film was supposed to be suspenseful, I was shifting in my seat, yawning, checking my watch, etc. The big twisty ending(which went on way too long) was predictable, not to mention Schumacher and a new screenwriter he brought in tacked on a ""happy ending."" The acting for the most part is stiff and wooden.

15238,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,076781956X,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[20, 22]","I decided to watch 8MM on HBO late one night with an open mind.  I actually glad that I did.  It does have its faults.  Nicholas Cage's performance as Tom Welles goes from one extreme to the other: he is both over-emotive at times and wooden at others.  The pace is a little slow at times.  And without knocking the actual quality of the film, it is not always easy to watch.  Well neither is A Clockwork Orange, and that movie is a complete masterpiece.  Then again, how can you make a film using the underworld snuff film trade as a backdrop easy to watch?For those of you that want to write 8MM off as another Death Wish/Dirty Harry vigilante action romp, you're missing the point.  If anything, 8MM is the antithesis to what those films are about.  You see the possibly irreparable moral and psychological damage that Welles undergoes when he takes the life of homicidal underworld figure who has no qualms with doing away with Welles.  Do you ever see a Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson character racked with regret  - even when you take into consideration the death of a truly despicable and worthless person?  True enough, Welles never stoops so low as to murder an innocent law-abiding citizen, yet you see a dramatic change in his character as the film progresses - and not for the better.Another thing that I liked about 8MM was Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Max California.  On the surface, he is a tattooed punk rocker who works in an adult book store.  But underneath, he is the moral compass of the film.  You'll learn to like Max  much in the same way that Welles learns to.  While Max lives as a single man without much responsiblity, he respects Welles for his dedication to family life.  I especially liked the scene in which Max and Welles meet for the first time - I shouldn't have to tell anyone what kind of magazine Max was hiding his Truman Capote paperback under.  And let's not forget the memorable line about trying to ""change the devil"".Before I sign off, I must caution you not to expect an easy lighthearted movie.  Don't even expect an action flick.

Here is really no exemption.  Its funny how once Joaquin Phoenix shows up you can see the caliber of acting rise, for even though at the time Joaquin was relatively unknown; his ability to display emotion and just plain act natural far outweighs the amateurish talent in Cage.Well, that aside this film is a good one at that.  It's dark, mysterious and serves up generous helpings of fear and suspense.  The subject matter is grim and depressing and may even evoke emotions such as trauma and sadness, for what happened to that poor young girl and the complete disregard for life these creeps have can weigh heavy on the easily emotional, and even those not so easily prone to compassion.  As Tom Welles, Cage plays a PI hired by a recently deceased millionaire's wife who has found this pornographic film in which a young woman is murdered.  At first they all pass it off as a fake, but in order to be certain he investigates, and finds out the `snuff films' aren't necessarily myth.Slowly declining into absurdity, this film does, by the end, come off a bit unrealistic (ha, if you can imagine that *spoken with pure sarcasm*) but it still works, it still delivers the goods sort-of-speak.  If you're looking for an effective thriller that will keep you glued to your seat and shaking in your skin long after the credits have finished rolling then this may just be the film for you.

However,  making a movie about this is a difficult thing to do. What Schuhmacher was  trying to achieve hasn't become too apparent - blurring the line between  good and evil. How one might get lost in the fascination of being in power  of somebody else's life, even though you despise violence, how suddenly  your normal life doesn't exist anymore and you find yourself being  swallowed whole in this devellish circle, trying to fight your way out and  fight with your inner self most of all. For my taste it could have been  more intense on the level of Nic as Tom Welles getting &quot;to close to  the Devil who never changes, but changes you. As a huge Cage admirer I have  to say though that I'm not too taken with his main stream movie-making and  I think he's selling himself short on scripts like this one. He can do  better - ok, it wasn't as bad as Con Air but it certainly wasn't better  than Snake Eyes and that was a pretty average and predictable movie I  thought, even if Nic did well in giving his character an identity.

15248,ANGCVJN6WLN2O,076781956X,"Dennis Bey ""DB""","[4, 5]","This is one of my favorite movies.  When I think about it, the first words I associate are dark and down. Dark is the color of the actual film.  Dark is the descent to unexposed recesses of men.  Dark is the degradation of a man through exposure to the residents of these caverns; secret societies that live out our nightmares.  Secret societies that live out the dirtiest fantasies, we have and never would dare tell a soul. This is the ride of the protagonist.  The downward spiral he forces himself into, and at the end regrets.Shumacher, seems to have a knack for psychological downward spirals.  He gave us before, ""Falling down"" with Michael Douglas.""When you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change...the devil changes you""This phrase given by Max (Joaquin Phoenix) is metaphoric to the whole story.First off, I'll address the easy equation with ""Thesis"" the Spanish film.  Not because both films use one subject, Snuff films, one is a rip off of the other or even inspired from.8MM is a psychological thriller. It is an exploration of the most sinister side of the human.  And what happens to an average guy when exposed to the chaotic and insane, and discovers he has an inclination to them, gets desensitized, or reacts out of character.  Shumacher intends to drive you down alongside the character, so you see what he sees and feel what he feels, and find out how ""normal"" you are.Tom Wells is a normal guy.  He has a beautiful family, striving to solidify their economical position in the upper middle class.  Tom has one vice, smoking and hides it from his wife.  He is a surveillance expert, and his last job is the story of the movie.A recently death industrial czar had a vice and hided it from his wife of 50 years.The wife wants to explore all the truth into the man's vice, and commissions Wells to dig into it, especially investigate if someone was hurt by it.Some evil and injustice, are so overwhelming to one's sensitivity that rage overrides and leads to unwanted actions that scar.  Acts so far out ominous that you are forced to react and create some balance to give some overall sense.  But instead of gaining some peace from this, you sprout a hate hungry monster that cannot be turned off.  Carrying its bitter taste to everyday life.  Well's investigation leads him to this kind of path.  And he is forced to react instinctively and then cover up the mess.Again Max's words of caution: ""there are things you'll see that cannot be unseen"",are encompassing of this journey.Finally, It's all about self-discovery.  And through Shumacher's world and Cage's performance you get to live the abrasive, seedy journey, including its controversial choices.They truly seem far more difficult to make than out of context.Is violence and revenge in some unique occasions justifiable?. At least within the window of your emotional stability?  Are there actions you cannot be a bystander to, although the consequences might be devastating?Is there guilt in the pleasure of punishing those whom, on your mind unquestionably deserve it?  How high is the price to pay for that pleasure?Those are the questions you might notice become more puzzling at the end.",4,Another great Downward Spiral from Shumacher,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3178,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'When', 'think', 'first', 'words', 'associate', 'are', 'dark', 'down', 'Dark', 'color', 'actual', 'film', 'Dark', 'descent', 'unexposed', 'recesses', 'men', 'Dark', 'degradation', 'man', 'exposure', 'residents', 'caverns', 'secret', 'societies', 'live', 'out', 'nightmares', 'Secret', 'societies', 'live', 'out', 'dirtiest', 'fantasies', 'have', 'never', 'would', 'dare', 'tell', 'soul', 'ride', 'protagonist', 'downward', 'spiral', 'end', 'regrets.Shumacher', 'have', 'knack', 'psychological', 'downward', 'spirals', 'gave', 'Falling', 'down', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'When', 'dance', 'devil', 'devil', ""n't"", 'change', 'devil', 'changes', 'phrase', 'given', 'Max', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'metaphoric', 'whole', 'story.First', ""'ll"", 'address', 'easy', 'equation', 'Thesis', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Not', 'films', 'use', 'one', 'subject', 'Snuff', 'films', 'one', 'rip', 'other', 'even', 'inspired', 'from.8MM', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'exploration', 'most', 'sinister', 'side', 'human', 'what', 'average', 'guy', 'when', 'exposed', 'chaotic', 'insane', 'discovers', 'inclination', 'desensitized', 'character', 'Shumacher', 'drive', 'down', 'alongside', 'character', 'see', 'what', 'feel', 'what', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'normal', 'are.Tom', 'Wells', 'normal', 'guy', 'beautiful', 'family', 'striving', 'solidify', 'economical', 'position', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Tom', 'one', 'vice', 'smoking', 'wife', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'last', 'job', 'story', 'movie.A', 'recently', 'death', 'industrial', 'czar', 'had', 'vice', 'hided', 'wife', '50', 'years.The', 'wife', 'explore', 'truth', 'man', 'vice', 'commissions', 'Wells', 'dig', 'especially', 'investigate', 'someone', 'was', 'hurt', 'it.Some', 'evil', 'injustice', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelming', 'one', 'sensitivity', 'rage', 'overrides', 'unwanted', 'actions', 'scar', 'Acts', 'so', 'far', 'out', 'ominous', 'are', 'forced', 'react', 'create', 'balance', 'give', 'overall', 'sense', 'instead', 'gaining', 'peace', 'sprout', 'hate', 'hungry', 'monster', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'Carrying', 'bitter', 'taste', 'everyday', 'life', 'Well', 'investigation', 'kind', 'path', 'forced', 'react', 'instinctively', 'then', 'cover', 'up', 'mess.Again', 'Max', 'words', 'caution', 'are', 'things', ""'ll"", 'see', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'unseen', 'are', 'encompassing', 'journey.Finally', 'self-discovery', 'Shumacher', 'world', 'Cage', 'performance', 'get', 'live', 'abrasive', 'seedy', 'journey', 'including', 'controversial', 'choices.They', 'truly', 'seem', 'far', 'more', 'difficult', 'make', 'context.Is', 'violence', 'revenge', 'unique', 'occasions', 'justifiable', 'least', 'window', 'emotional', 'stability', 'Are', 'actions', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bystander', 'consequences', 'might', 'be', 'devastating', 'there', 'guilt', 'pleasure', 'punishing', 'whom', 'mind', 'unquestionably', 'deserve', 'How', 'high', 'price', 'pay', 'pleasure', 'are', 'questions', 'might', 'notice', 'become', 'more', 'puzzling', 'end']",N/A

This is a good thing by-the-way. Not only are the bad guys repellent creeps they are also, in a way, pretty ordinary.

I'd never really seen him in any movies before this but now that I've seen him in a likeable role, in a movie where there are very few likeable characters, I look forward to his next movies.Some parts of this film to me are very disturbing, for example the first viewing of the snuff film where we see the girl cry or finale with the jumping record.

15260,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,076781956X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","This film is a masterpiece. It starts with a vision of children in Hell's  Kitchen, a deprived neighborhood of New York City in the sixties, where  four boys, deeply religious or at least deeply influenced by religion and a  priest, one day sink into a prank that turns criminal. They destroy the  cart of a hotdog vendor, a Greek man who is working hard to bring his  family to the US, and by doing so cause severe injuries to an innocent man  who is crushed by the cart. They are sent to a boys' institution. This film  shows how some young guards or wardens take advantage of the kids to give  way to their sadistic violence and their perverted peadophiliac sexual  drives. It is hell and not reformation, the hell of rape, beating,  torturing, sexual assault in all possible forms. That is the first  dimension of the film. The second dimension is revealed by the fact that  two of those four boys recognize the worst of these guards in a restaurant  one night (twenty or so years later) and just kill him on the spur of the  moment and out of cold blood. The other two boys will organize their  defense, with the help of some older people of the community and the trial  will be rigged by the prosecutor who is one of them and a lawyer hired to  go along with the setup. The trial becomes then a full denunciation of the  hell those kids have lived in, through the counter-examination of a  prosecuting witness, one of the two particularly vicious guards, a good  friend of the one who was killed. This witness will later be killed by some  black people, because the band of guards he belonged to managed to kill the  brother of a black artist because he stood in their way and tried to  prevent the  torturing . This is the second level of the film. The third  level comes with the search, by the fourth friend and the girl who was  associated to their group, for a witness to give them a perfect alibi on  the night of the murder. They find that witness in the person of the priest  who had been their close adviser and religious friend all along. He swears  on the Bible to tell the truth, but he lies skillfully and unquestionably  to give them the alibi they need to be acquitted. But he does not really  lie, in the eyes of God, because for him the condemnation of such hellish  boys' institutions is more important than the freedom of the two boys. He  saves the boys (close to thirty by then) to force public opinion and  justice to look into those institutions, thanks to his priestly authority.  This reveals that in life you never have to choose between good and evil,  the truth and a lie. You have to choose most of the time between two evils,  two lies, and you have to ponder in your soul and mind, in your human and  religious responsibility, to know which evil and which lie are worse and  then decide to support the least evil and the least vicious lie, and then  your  lying  is between you and your soul, between you and your ethics,  between you and your God, if you believe in God. This level is absolutely  superbly done. Finally the film is in a way pessimistic about society that  can only move on from lesser lie to lesser lie, from lesser evil to lesser  evil. Society improves because the lesser lies and evils are chosen by the  men and women who have some kind of humane and humanistic inspiration,  based on personal ethics or on their religious beliefs. This film should be  shown to all teenagers to demonstrate to them how ugly life can be at times  and how they have to react with their souls, minds, thinking and  intelligence, rather than with a pre-constructed code of behaviour or a set  of pleasure-directed spontaneous feelings. God always forgive a lie if it  reveals some evil and enables our human society to correct this evil and  hence improve.

It sheds light on a very dark subject that many people would rather avoid. When really a subject concerning snuff films, and illegal porn undergroud low lives is something everyone should be aware of.Many people would be turned off by the subject matter. Understandable. This is a heavy movie. It will not be for everyone, or suit everyone's tastes. But I got it for the fact that it dealt with an interesting subject. I saw it mostly as an action movie. I wasn't sure how graphic it would be in terms of violence or sex. I was relieved to find that the movie stays pretty normal. With only the level of violence reaching boiling point during the second half of the movie. There is very little if any violence during many of the scenes before this. It is just dark and often disturbing because it is so real.  So for a while I have been hesitant to buy it. I got this movie at a cheap price. Now, after watching it. I am so proud to add it to my DVD collection.The director commentry by Joel Schumacher (The Client, Batman &Robin;) is fantastic. I felt I had really learnt something about the movie, and it's controversial subject. I'd hughly recommend people listen to the commentry. The acting by Nicolas Cage and other talented and accomplished actors is impeccable.I was really drawn into detective Tom Welles head. The viewer is taken for a long dark journey into his mind to battle demons in his life that have laid dormant for years. By the end of the movie I think he has found peace, but it is never known if the demons are really gone forever. Maybe there are more demons buried deep inside him. Waiting for another chance to come to the surface.We all need to fight our own demons in our lives. And face our fears.The characters are all believeable. It is chilling. Normal. How Anthony Hopkins wished Hannibal Lecter to be portrayed. Because he felt that a normal person in a cell was much more frightening for people, then someone who appeared to be mentally disturbed. I totally agree with him.The script is flawless, and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Who's other writer credits include 'Fight Club' and 'Seven'.Please watch this movie. Even if you only see it once. Hopefully you will not regret it.I think that sometimes the best lessons are learnt when people SEE how badly we treat other human beings. And the movie makes some excellent points on why people may kill others. Because they want to.Doesn't that answer make you sick? It doesn't make me feel good. But then, an answer like that only makes me believe more how truthful the script seems. And how truthful this subject is. And how people must take responsability for their actions and no longer pretend that a seedy, gritty, snuff film world does not exist. Because it does exist. It is just no one will own up to knowing anyone in this deplorable, very secretive business.Some of my favorite quotes from this movie are...""Dance with the devil and the devil don't change; the devil changes you"".""There are some things that you see, and you can't unsee them. Know what I mean?""8MM has also been hailed as ""The darkest, most relentless thriller since 'The Scilence Of The Lambs'. - John Simon, Venice Magazine.I tend to agree with his opinion. However I will go further and say that this movie is in a different class. I think it is better.8MM examines many intriguing questions like: What is so entertaining about watching people die? Or watching them in extreame pain?I strangly enjoyed 8MM. I hope anyone wishing to hire or buy this movie does too. But then, if you don't enjoy it. That is a good responce to have to this type of movie. It isn't meant to make you happy. It is meant to awaken you to the fact that we live in an increasingly dangerous world. And things can only get worse if we continue to live and treat people so appallingly.I think this movie has only scratched the surface of an increasing problem with the availability of porn and other vile subjects with the internet.But hopefully this movie will make people aware. If so, that is one of many messages it is trying to send to people.Finally I hope you all can sleep after this movie.",5,"Dark, intelligent, disturbing, truthful, and educational",1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,4185,"['8MM', 'important', 'movie', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'light', 'very', 'dark', 'subject', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'avoid', 'When', 'really', 'subject', 'concerning', 'snuff', 'films', 'illegal', 'porn', 'undergroud', 'low', 'lives', 'something', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'of.Many', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'subject', 'matter', 'Understandable', 'heavy', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'suit', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'got', 'fact', 'interesting', 'subject', 'saw', 'mostly', 'action', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'graphic', 'would', 'be', 'terms', 'violence', 'sex', 'was', 'relieved', 'find', 'movie', 'pretty', 'normal', 'only', 'level', 'violence', 'reaching', 'boiling', 'point', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'many', 'scenes', 'just', 'dark', 'often', 'disturbing', 'so', 'real', 'So', 'while', 'have', 'been', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'got', 'movie', 'cheap', 'price', 'Now', 'watching', 'am', 'so', 'proud', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection.The', 'director', 'commentry', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Client', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'fantastic', 'felt', 'had', 'really', 'learnt', 'something', 'movie', 'controversial', 'subject', ""'d"", 'hughly', 'recommend', 'people', 'listen', 'commentry', 'acting', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'other', 'talented', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'impeccable.I', 'was', 'really', 'drawn', 'detective', 'Tom', 'Welles', 'head', 'viewer', 'taken', 'long', 'dark', 'journey', 'mind', 'battle', 'demons', 'life', 'have', 'laid', 'dormant', 'years', 'end', 'movie', 'think', 'found', 'peace', 'never', 'known', 'demons', 'are', 'really', 'gone', 'forever', 'Maybe', 'are', 'more', 'demons', 'buried', 'deep', 'Waiting', 'chance', 'come', 'surface.We', 'need', 'fight', 'own', 'demons', 'lives', 'face', 'fears.The', 'characters', 'are', 'believeable', 'chilling', 'Normal', 'How', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'wished', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'be', 'portrayed', 'felt', 'normal', 'person', 'cell', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'people', 'then', 'someone', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'totally', 'agree', 'him.The', 'script', 'flawless', 'written', 'Andrew', 'Kevin', 'Walker', 'Who', 'other', 'writer', 'credits', 'include', ""'Fight"", 'Club', ""'Seven'.Please"", 'watch', 'movie', 'Even', 'only', 'see', 'once', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'it.I', 'think', 'best', 'lessons', 'are', 'learnt', 'when', 'people', 'SEE', 'how', 'badly', 'treat', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'movie', 'excellent', 'points', 'why', 'people', 'may', 'kill', 'others', 'want', 'to.Does', ""n't"", 'answer', 'make', 'sick', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'then', 'answer', 'only', 'believe', 'more', 'how', 'truthful', 'script', 'how', 'truthful', 'subject', 'how', 'people', 'must', 'take', 'responsability', 'actions', 'longer', 'pretend', 'seedy', 'gritty', 'snuff', 'film', 'world', 'not', 'exist', 'exist', 'just', 'one', 'will', 'own', 'up', 'knowing', 'anyone', 'deplorable', 'very', 'secretive', 'business.Some', 'favorite', 'quotes', 'movie', 'are', 'Dance', 'devil', 'devil', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'devil', 'are', 'things', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'unsee', 'Know', 'what', 'mean', '8MM', 'also', 'been', 'hailed', 'darkest', 'most', 'relentless', 'thriller', ""'The"", 'Scilence', 'Lambs', 'John', 'Simon', 'Venice', 'Magazine.I', 'tend', 'agree', 'opinion', 'However', 'will', 'go', 'further', 'say', 'movie', 'different', 'class', 'think', 'better.8MM', 'examines', 'many', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'What', 'so', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'people', 'die', 'watching', 'extreame', 'pain', 'strangly', 'enjoyed', '8MM', 'hope', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'hire', 'buy', 'movie', 'too', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'good', 'responce', 'have', 'type', 'movie', ""n't"", 'meant', 'make', 'happy', 'meant', 'awaken', 'fact', 'live', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'world', 'things', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'continue', 'live', 'treat', 'people', 'so', 'appallingly.I', 'think', 'movie', 'only', 'scratched', 'surface', 'increasing', 'problem', 'availability', 'porn', 'other', 'vile', 'subjects', 'internet.But', 'hopefully', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'people', 'aware', 'so', 'one', 'many', 'messages', 'trying', 'send', 'people.Finally', 'hope', 'can', 'sleep', 'movie']",N/A

This is reinforced by  MACHINE's 'revealing' monologue towards the end  which subsequently  undermines the credibility of the film by rendering it transperent.  The  notion of an average family man slowly becoming immersed within the sordid  and depraved underbelly of society is an interesting concept for a  character study type film, as opposed to a linear narrative approach.  However, the film lacked the psychological intensity that the screenplay so  obviously implies and failed on both levels- narrative and  characterization.  The narrative was ponderous and the attempts at subtlety  failed miserably IMO.  Many would argue that Cage delivered an understated  performance but.........he was suffering from insomnia!  ARGGHH!  This  movie really aggravates me!  Usually I adore movies that are unflinching  in their depictions of sadism-mascho, addiction, paranoia, obsession and  many other 'darker' themes directly related to form/s of 'psychological  instability'.  Of course the protagonist/s who encounter or participate in  such behaviour undergoe some form of transformation.

The film is sad and disturbing with fine performances by Joaquin Phoenix as the young porn shop clerk who helps the investigator in his pursuits and James Gandolfini as a bad guy years before his fame in The Sopranos made his name a household word.This is a film that made me cringe even though I found the scenes between Cage and his wife and daughter a little too mundane although I do understand that the filmmakers tried to give him some humanity in these scenes and get away a little bit from the horror.  There was nothing unexpected in the film however, and this was its weakness.  But the disgusting world of these kinds of films gave me serious chills.

A discreet and efficient private eye named Tom Welles (Nicholas Cage) is hired by a certain Mrs. Christian to investigate the circumstances of creation of a mysterious 8 mm film found in the safe of her recently deceased billionaire husband. In doing his job Welles does not shoot guns, he doesn't beat people (well, OK, not much), there is no high speed (or low speed) car chases and no, he will not sleep with all the women he will meet (he is married and very much in love with his wife). Very credibly, in this film the private investigator is a very organised and highly competent guy with a brain and top level training. All the puzzle solving in this film is classical detective work with the use of lots of headology, some pretty clever tricks, a little bit of technology, an enormous effort of walking miles and driving hundreds of miles, talking a lot with hundreds of (frequently antipathic) people and last but not least using during many hours the ""Mark I eyeball"" in different places where public records are kept... The scenario of the investigation is solid and the whole story excellent.Then comes the moment, when Tom Welles crosses the line from just investigating into doing something more, on his own time and free of charge this time. There will be absolutely no more spoilers here but this second part of the film, which many a lesser director+writer+actor team would mess up royally, is in fact even better than the excellent investigation! And the ending, always the most dangerous moment in films, is as good as the rest. I think that after watching ""8mm"" I will never more be able to hear words ""Save me! Save me!"" without feeling a mixture of bitter sadness, great pity and a cold shiver of terror...All actors did an excellent job in this film. Joaquin Phoenix plays here a guy named Max California (not his real name), who came to Los Angeles to make career in show business, but ended working as clerk in a porn peddling shop. James Gandolfini is even better, as a profoundly despicable, small-time porn producer. Peter Stormare gives possibly THE BEST performance as a freaky film maker, talented but for some undisclosed (and probably not very nice)reason limiting himself to turning only extremely hard varieties of porn movies. Anthony Heald is excellent as Mrs. Christian lawyer and Catherine Keener plays magistrally Tom Welles wife. And finally there is also one more actor who gives a great performance, buy I simply can not give his name - and I strongly advise you to NOT research on internet who he is, because it could SPOIL your pleasure.More generally I strongly advise also against researching this film in any way before watching it. The gradual discovery of the truth is one of the greatest assets of ""8mm"" and if want to enjoy it fully, do NOT look it up. In fact, avoid even to watch the trailers...Another strong WARNING here - as considerable part of the investigation takes place amongst people working in underground porn industry, this thing is STRICTLY for adults!Bottom line, this film is a most excellent thing, which I recommend warmly to all those who like mysteries, investigations and dark voyages into shadowy corners of our cities and our minds...",5,A surprisingly good story about an investigation slowly becoming a perilous journey into the heart of darkness...,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,3554,"['film', 'surprised', 'impressed', 'greatly', 'point', 'when', 'final', 'credits', 'started', 'roll', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'watched', 'end', 'way', 'saluting', 'effort', 'whole', 'crew', 'produced', '8mm', '.The', 'great', 'idea', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'was', 'make', 'film', 'form', 'very', 'thoroughly', 'carefully', 'described', 'investigation', 'discreet', 'efficient', 'private', 'eye', 'named', 'Tom', 'Welles', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'hired', 'certain', 'Mrs.', 'Christian', 'investigate', 'circumstances', 'creation', 'mysterious', '8', 'mm', 'film', 'found', 'safe', 'recently', 'deceased', 'billionaire', 'husband', 'doing', 'job', 'Welles', 'not', 'shoot', 'guns', ""n't"", 'beat', 'people', 'well', 'OK', 'not', 'much', 'high', 'speed', 'low', 'speed', 'car', 'chases', 'will', 'not', 'sleep', 'women', 'will', 'meet', 'married', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'wife', 'Very', 'credibly', 'film', 'private', 'investigator', 'very', 'organised', 'highly', 'competent', 'guy', 'brain', 'top', 'level', 'training', 'puzzle', 'solving', 'film', 'classical', 'detective', 'work', 'use', 'lots', 'headology', 'pretty', 'clever', 'tricks', 'little', 'bit', 'technology', 'enormous', 'effort', 'walking', 'miles', 'driving', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'talking', 'lot', 'hundreds', 'frequently', 'people', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'using', 'many', 'hours', 'Mark', 'eyeball', 'different', 'places', 'where', 'public', 'records', 'are', 'kept', 'scenario', 'investigation', 'solid', 'whole', 'story', 'excellent.Then', 'moment', 'when', 'Tom', 'Welles', 'line', 'just', 'investigating', 'doing', 'something', 'more', 'own', 'time', 'free', 'charge', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'more', 'spoilers', 'here', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'many', 'lesser', 'director+writer+actor', 'team', 'would', 'mess', 'up', 'royally', 'fact', 'even', 'better', 'excellent', 'investigation', 'ending', 'always', 'most', 'dangerous', 'moment', 'films', 'as', 'good', 'rest', 'think', 'watching', '8mm', 'will', 'never', 'more', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'words', 'Save', 'Save', 'feeling', 'mixture', 'bitter', 'sadness', 'great', 'pity', 'cold', 'shiver', 'terror', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'here', 'guy', 'named', 'Max', 'California', 'not', 'real', 'name', 'who', 'came', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'make', 'career', 'show', 'business', 'ended', 'working', 'clerk', 'porn', 'peddling', 'shop', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'even', 'better', 'profoundly', 'despicable', 'small-time', 'porn', 'producer', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'possibly', 'BEST', 'performance', 'freaky', 'film', 'maker', 'talented', 'undisclosed', 'probably', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'reason', 'limiting', 'turning', 'only', 'extremely', 'hard', 'varieties', 'porn', 'movies', 'Anthony', 'Heald', 'excellent', 'Mrs.', 'Christian', 'lawyer', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'magistrally', 'Tom', 'Welles', 'wife', 'finally', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'actor', 'who', 'great', 'performance', 'buy', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'name', 'strongly', 'advise', 'NOT', 'research', 'internet', 'who', 'could', 'SPOIL', 'pleasure.More', 'generally', 'strongly', 'advise', 'also', 'researching', 'film', 'way', 'watching', 'gradual', 'discovery', 'truth', 'one', 'greatest', 'assets', '8mm', 'want', 'enjoy', 'fully', 'do', 'NOT', 'look', 'up', 'fact', 'avoid', 'even', 'watch', 'trailers', 'strong', 'WARNING', 'here', 'considerable', 'part', 'investigation', 'place', 'amongst', 'people', 'working', 'underground', 'porn', 'industry', 'thing', 'STRICTLY', 'adults', 'Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'most', 'excellent', 'thing', 'recommend', 'warmly', 'who', 'mysteries', 'investigations', 'dark', 'voyages', 'shadowy', 'corners', 'cities', 'minds']",N/A
15273,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,076781956X,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Disturbing, demented and depressing. Yet, a powerful film. One of Cage's best ever and a production that I re-screen on very rare occasions.For those that did not see this when it was released - prepare yourself for one truly ugly revelation. Unlike some contrived horror via whatever generic boogeyman - monsters, ghosts, etc - this film explores the real-life putrid and dark heart found within some sick souls.Hiding under various guises - artistic freedom, social expression, etc. - these freaks create the dehumanizing products that goes by several names. The one I've heard most often: Extreme Fetish Pornography. Delving into the clearest examples of hell on earth, this material can honestly be called ""horror porn"". (research Sara Zamora)We laugh at things like ""Two Girls And A Cup"" - because the reaction we enjoy watching in others, amusing ourselves with squeamishness of our fellows.But the kind of sickening fetish portrayed in the film - this goes beyond anything normal people could even imagine, much less consider desirable. Yes, that's right 'normal'. This isn't something that's covered under the social contract of politically-correct versions of acceptable.In the film Cage plays private investigator Tom Welles. A consummate professional - he does his work combining quiet efficiency and hard-nosed investigation. No drama, no newsflashes, no exposure. He completes his assignment, turns in his work and withdraws. That's it. Once done - home to his loving wife and young baby daughter.It's this very stability and professionalism that his newest client is appreciative of; his ability to confer discreet information that is both thorough and complete. And she wants to know the truth about an old style 8mm film strip she found after her &uuml;ber wealthy husband unexpectedly passed away. Hidden in his private safe - no one knew it existed.Lacking sound and used primarily by the adult film industry, it's what is commonly called a ""short"" - a quick movie that was usually less than 10 minutes in length. Rewound and repeated via early coin-operated machines.But this short is unlike anything imagined by Welles, already a seasoned and weathered field operator, he's seen his share of terrible things. What it is - is a sick myth called a ""snuff film"". A purported movie that shows a young woman physically and sexually brutalized - then murdered, usually with a knife or bladed instrument of some sort.Welles writes it off as special effects and sharp filmmaking, nothing more. But his widowed client wants proof. Absolute and unequivocal that the disgusting product her late husband was secretly watching behind closed doors is indeed nothing more than a clever fraud. She can forgive her husband everything as long as it's fake. And she is willing to pay him any amount for that confirmation.As Tom goes deeper and deeper into the investigation, he slowly realizes that he may have stumbled onto his worst fear - the film wasn't a staged act. And this malignant knowledge eats away at portions of his soul.Again, a powerful movie. And one that I don't recommend to many people for the simple reason that you will feel sick inside having gone through the experience.But it would be wrong to deny such a... complete film. Every aspect and in every respect this was top tier. The actors delivered nuanced and strong performances. And I do mean every single actor - many of whom went on to win most of the prestigious acting awards for film and television. Direction, cinematography, sets, editing, eerie soundtrack - everything was superlative across the board.An incredible and disturbing film best screened during the daylight hours.",5,Malignant Knowledge,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,3662,"['Disturbing', 'demented', 'depressing', 'powerful', 'film', 'One', 'Cage', 'best', 'ever', 'production', 're-screen', 'very', 'rare', 'occasions.For', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'prepare', 'one', 'truly', 'ugly', 'revelation', 'contrived', 'horror', 'generic', 'boogeyman', 'monsters', 'ghosts', 'etc', 'film', 'real-life', 'putrid', 'dark', 'heart', 'found', 'sick', 'souls.Hiding', 'various', 'guises', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'social', 'expression', 'etc', 'freaks', 'create', 'dehumanizing', 'products', 'several', 'names', 'one', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'most', 'often', 'Extreme', 'Fetish', 'Pornography', 'Delving', 'clearest', 'examples', 'hell', 'earth', 'material', 'can', 'honestly', 'be', 'called', 'horror', 'porn', 'research', 'Sara', 'Zamora', 'laugh', 'things', 'Two', 'Girls', 'A', 'Cup', 'reaction', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'others', 'amusing', 'squeamishness', 'fellows.But', 'kind', 'sickening', 'fetish', 'portrayed', 'film', 'anything', 'normal', 'people', 'could', 'even', 'imagine', 'much', 'less', 'consider', 'desirable', 'Yes', 'right', ""'normal"", ""n't"", 'something', 'covered', 'social', 'contract', 'politically-correct', 'versions', 'acceptable.In', 'film', 'Cage', 'private', 'investigator', 'Tom', 'Welles', 'consummate', 'professional', 'work', 'combining', 'quiet', 'efficiency', 'hard-nosed', 'investigation', 'drama', 'newsflashes', 'exposure', 'assignment', 'work', 'withdraws', 'Once', 'done', 'home', 'loving', 'wife', 'young', 'baby', 'daughter.It', 'very', 'stability', 'professionalism', 'newest', 'client', 'appreciative', 'ability', 'confer', 'discreet', 'information', 'thorough', 'complete', 'know', 'truth', 'old', 'style', '8mm', 'film', 'strip', 'found', 'uuml', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'unexpectedly', 'passed', 'away', 'Hidden', 'private', 'safe', 'one', 'knew', 'existed.Lacking', 'sound', 'used', 'primarily', 'adult', 'film', 'industry', 'what', 'commonly', 'called', 'short', 'quick', 'movie', 'was', 'usually', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'length', 'Rewound', 'repeated', 'early', 'coin-operated', 'machines.But', 'short', 'anything', 'imagined', 'Welles', 'already', 'seasoned', 'weathered', 'field', 'operator', 'seen', 'share', 'terrible', 'things', 'What', 'sick', 'myth', 'called', 'snuff', 'film', 'purported', 'movie', 'young', 'woman', 'physically', 'sexually', 'brutalized', 'then', 'murdered', 'usually', 'knife', 'bladed', 'instrument', 'sort.Welles', 'off', 'special', 'effects', 'sharp', 'filmmaking', 'nothing', 'more', 'widowed', 'client', 'proof', 'Absolute', 'unequivocal', 'disgusting', 'product', 'late', 'husband', 'was', 'secretly', 'watching', 'closed', 'doors', 'indeed', 'nothing', 'more', 'clever', 'fraud', 'can', 'forgive', 'husband', 'everything', 'as', 'long', 'fake', 'willing', 'pay', 'amount', 'confirmation.As', 'Tom', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'investigation', 'slowly', 'may', 'have', 'stumbled', 'worst', 'fear', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'staged', 'act', 'malignant', 'knowledge', 'away', 'portions', 'soul.Again', 'powerful', 'movie', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'many', 'people', 'simple', 'reason', 'will', 'feel', 'sick', 'having', 'gone', 'experience.But', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'deny', 'complete', 'film', 'aspect', 'respect', 'was', 'top', 'tier', 'actors', 'delivered', 'nuanced', 'strong', 'performances', 'do', 'mean', 'single', 'actor', 'many', 'whom', 'went', 'win', 'most', 'prestigious', 'acting', 'awards', 'film', 'television', 'Direction', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'editing', 'eerie', 'soundtrack', 'everything', 'was', 'superlative', 'board.An', 'incredible', 'disturbing', 'film', 'best', 'screened', 'daylight', 'hours']",N/A

Yes, it does deal with a sick  subject, but it also raises a question that we all can relate to - how far  would someone go to right a wrong?

Nor is its subject matter, which sad to say, does exist in our pristine world, but for some reason, audiences tend to find it repulsive and tend not to look at the film as an artistic endeavor.  I think Joel Schumacher's direction is excellent; the one scene where Cage has broken into Machine's house and the record is stuck at the end is as frightening as anything I've seen in recent movies.  He also draws excellent performances, not only in his leading cast, but in the supporting roles.  Nicolas Cage, not one of my favorite actors, does an outstanding job in a role that is complex and multi-dimensional.  His persistence to find who killed Maryanne Mathews is relentless and at times heart-shattering.  James Gandolfini is superb and despicable in the role of the smut producer who helmed the snuff film.  Peter Stomare as the heartless director Dino Velvet is likewise disgustingly realistic.  Joaquin Phoenix provides a complex comic portrait who wants to join up with Cage in his quest.  Anthony Heald as the Christian's lawyer is typical bar bull, and Catherine Keener, though stuffy and reserved, makes a good wife to the volatile Cage.  However, to me, the most impact comes from the carefully controlled and subtly nuanced performance of Amy Morton as Maryanne's mother.  Her desire to hold on to her daughter's reappearance; her loneliness in eating alone (""I'd like to eat once without the TV) and the lustful longing in her scenes with Cage are awesome.  Her performance gives the movie its heart, and enables us to see why Cage acts like Charles Bronson at the end.This could be called a ""sick"" movie, but we are a ""sick"" society.  Old Mr. Christian did the snuff film because ""he could"", and Machine killed because he enjoyed it.Ultimately, a disturbing but unusually good movie.

In truth it is about a 4.5 rating. Andrew Kevin Walker wrote both the screenplay for this movie and the infamous Brad Pitt one so there are similarities that suggest heavy lifting from the later at times. On top of this director Joel Schumacher has gone for the deep tone same gritty feel. Let's face it... 8mm would have faired much better if released today than four years after the king of modern serial killer flicks, however it has aged well and probably will continue to disturb for some years to come because of the theme.Like Paul Schrader's Hardcore, the theme is one of a youth who had a dream of going to Hollywood only to become part of the seedy underground pornography industry there. Here in 8mm Nicholas Cage plays a discreet wealthy-client specialist detective who is asked by a widow to trace the whereabouts of a girl who appears and is killed in a secret snuff film that her late rich husband kept in his vault. Cage watches the film, much to his flinching horror, and then sets out to find the girl by hiring porn shop clerk Joaquin Phoenix as his main advisor. Suffice to say that searching for snuff films soon sends Cage a little round the bend as he gets closer to his objective but at the same time can not get the things he is seeing out of his head, as our porn shop clerk keeps reminding us - ""You don't change the devil... the devil changes you.""The actual PI work is quite well done and all of the actors are functional, even possibly some of them in their best roles. In fact Cage's performance here is on par with Leaving Los Vegas.Ultimately 8mm is a great movie about tragedy and the beast within man. Don't go expecting anything deeper than ""I did it because I could"" type reasoning though.

For me, this is the best kind of thriller. It draws us into the story and then we follow the lead into a dark underworld. I thought the villain named Machine was terrifying. Nic Cage gives a slick performance and Joaquin Phoenix jumps off the screen. James Gandolphini gives a believable performance also as a seedy porn king. To the critics who say Cage was wooden, what are you expecting, him to dance around in a rainbow outfit, he's a private investigator, a reserved man. For some, the actual details of the girl being murdered were too disturbing for them to like or watch which I don't challenge. But if interested in the seeing this for the first time, it's not all that gory.  Most of it is implied or shown with quick editing cuts. The trashy Saw movies are 10 times worse.

15290,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,076781956X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","8mm (Joel Schumacher, 1999)[originally posted 17Jan2000, revised 29Jul2013]What can you do with 8mm? The one thing you can't do is argue with the conclusions to be drawn from it. There has been much debate over the years as to where it was that Joel Schumacher's career went off the cliff. As far as I'm concerned, it was the beginning of the nineties; Flatliners was Schumacher's last watchable, much less enjoyable, movie, for my money. There are those who will hold out for A Time to Kill or Schumacher's ridiculous Batman-franchise movies as being still-okay Joel. But if you ever meet someone who contends that he was still good by 1999 and the release of 8mm, you can safely ignore that person's taste in movies forevermore.Plot: Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is a PI hired by a wealthy recent widow, Mrs. Christian (Storm of the Century's Myra Wells in her last screen appearance to date). Mrs. Christian found a rather disturbing reel of film amongst her late husband's effects, and wants to know if it's a real snuff film. Soon enough, Welles is as obsessed with the question as Christian is, and with the help of  jack-of-all-sleazy-trades Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), Welles starts digging into the seemingly vast, powerful snuff film underground...that may not actually exist.This was the weekend of Potentially Great Movies, and Joel Schumacher's dip into the world of the infamous ""snuff"" film tops the list. It could have been an astounding movie, had it tried a little harder to break some barriers down (and had Nicholas Cage's role been better cast-- Cage just doesn't play a guy slowly having a nervous breakdown well) and been a little more subtle in its approach. As it was, it was a little too gratuitous, a little too exaggerated, and a little too detached. Which is too bad, because in the places where it shines, it really does shine. Joaquin Phoenix, in particular, is very likable in this film, every bit the foil to Cage's miscasting. And the above just touches on the incredible pool of talent brought together for this movie; Catherine Keener, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare (always underrated, usually wonderful, in that Tcheky Karyo kind of way), Norman Reedus, Don Creech, I could keep going all day like this.Now, in hindsight (I'm writing this paragraph in 2013), here's why everything kind of comes together vis-a-vis 8mm and Schumacher's career going off the cliff, even if you did like those awful Batman movies: this is the first time where Schumacher took a script that was highly regarded in Hollywood circles, proposed a number of changes to it, met with resistance from the scriptwriter, and ended up with said scriptwriter walking off the job and leaving Schumacher to bungle it. (As of this writing, the most recent case of such shenanigans we know of is the even worse Blood Creek, based on a script disowned by David Kajganich, which Schumacher released in 2009.) In the case of 8mm, the script was written by Andrew Kevin Walker, and all I should need to say about the quality of Walker's scripts is Se7en. (According to IMDB's trivia section for the movie, longtime Walker collaborator David Fincher was the first choice to direct; Fincher, presumably wrapped up in Fight Club, took a pass.) And in the places where this movie comes within spitting distance of greatness, I think it's safe to assume, it's Walker's script coming through despite Schumacher's changes; this becomes all the more obvious through the lens of Blood Creek.I'd love to see a remake of this film that goes back to Walker's original script and makes a few key casting changes (for the love of Roberta Findlay, use an unknown actor for Tom Welles). There's just enough here for me to prognosticate that that movie would be a thriller for the ages.

The  screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven) is intelligent in the way it uses  the characters and story to weave a gothic tapestry of the perverse side of  the human mind. This ranks among Joel Schumacher's best work (which isn't  much since he ruined the Batman franchise). Finally a film from Schumacher  that's smart and well done.

15292,A2QX63R4BHBRSP,076781956X,Robert Stotzky,"[1, 1]","After looking through some of the reviews of this film it seems to me that a lot of people disliked it for being too graphic. Well, being a huge fan of horror myself, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as graphic as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong - I don't get any pleasure from watching a young girl being tortured to death, but I found the middle road taken by director Joel Schumacher utterly disappointing.If you want to make a disturbing movie, you can basically choose either of two options. The first is to not show anything at all - best showcased in the great &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; - or you can show *everything* - as in &quot;Seven&quot; or many of the extreme (and I mean EXTREME) Japanese horror movies. It seems to me that Joel Schumacher wanted to make a movie that would appeal to hardcore horror fans as well as the general public, and thus used a few graphic scenes, but never too many or too graphic.The plot is simple: a private investigator (Cage) is hired to investigate if film of a young girl being murdered is real or not. His search takes him into the murky swamps of the Los Angeles porn industry. Jaquin Phoenix is fantastic as a clerk working in an adult bookstore.I think this movie would have been much better if Schumacher had been brave enough to make this even more graphic. I wanted a full-on splatter-fest; something to completely shock the audience. I want to see people leaving theaters because they can't bear it anymore; I want outraged critics saying it's exploitation at it's worst.

15293,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,076781956X,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Probably the most unique aspect of this film in this age of videotape and DVDs is its choice of title. No one uses 8MM anymore, do they? Actually, 8MM is an essentially routine thriller given a patina of originality by  being set in the sleazy world of hardcore, violent pornography.  Unfortunately, like most mainstream commercial productions, this film never  really explores this world in any depth, but uses it as window dressing for  a tired, by-the-numbers private eye meller.The film stars Nicholas Cage  as a Pennsylvania-based private investigator called in by a wealthy widow  to determine whether a &quot;snuff&quot; film she's found among her late  husband's personal possessions is the genuine article. Cage heads off to  Hollywood, the mecca of all things pornographic, hooks up with Joaquin  Phoenix as a Capote-reading porn shop clerk and all around nice guy, and  stumbles into a den of iniquity that leads him to the mystery's eventual  unraveling.Unlike a courageous film like 1984's &quot;Tightrope&quot;,  in which Clint Eastwood's cop character begins more and more to identify  with the sleazy world he's investigating and, in the process, unlocks dark,  hidden recesses buried deep within his own psyche, 8MM's main character  never seems even momentarily ensnared by the dark visions seeping into his  brain. Indeed, Cage's investigator remains morally superior throughout.  This allows for the film to settle for a routine, bloodsoaked revenge  melodrama resolution and to avoid having to develop and cope with a complex  central character. Even though director Joel Schumacher manages to create  an initial atmosphere of dark gloominess, it's essentially wasted in a  welter of action movie cliches and unconvincing heroics.Too bad that a  film that promises to open up a world on film unfamiliar to mainstream  audiences manages to make even pornography and all the denizens that toil  in it seem hopelessly humdrum.",2,drab drama,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,1944,"['Probably', 'most', 'unique', 'aspect', 'film', 'age', 'videotape', 'DVDs', 'choice', 'title', 'one', '8MM', 'anymore', 'do', 'Actually', '8MM', 'essentially', 'routine', 'thriller', 'given', 'patina', 'originality', 'being', 'set', 'sleazy', 'world', 'hardcore', 'violent', 'pornography', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'mainstream', 'commercial', 'productions', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'world', 'depth', 'window', 'dressing', 'tired', 'by-the-numbers', 'private', 'eye', 'meller.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Pennsylvania-based', 'private', 'investigator', 'called', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'determine', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'found', 'late', 'husband', 'personal', 'possessions', 'genuine', 'article', 'Cage', 'Hollywood', 'mecca', 'things', 'pornographic', 'up', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Capote-reading', 'porn', 'shop', 'clerk', 'nice', 'guy', 'den', 'iniquity', 'mystery', 'eventual', 'courageous', 'film', '1984', 'quot', 'Tightrope', 'quot', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'cop', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'identify', 'sleazy', 'world', 'investigating', 'process', 'unlocks', 'dark', 'hidden', 'recesses', 'buried', 'deep', 'own', 'psyche', '8MM', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'even', 'momentarily', 'ensnared', 'dark', 'visions', 'seeping', 'brain', 'Indeed', 'Cage', 'investigator', 'morally', 'superior', 'film', 'settle', 'routine', 'bloodsoaked', 'revenge', 'melodrama', 'resolution', 'avoid', 'having', 'develop', 'cope', 'complex', 'central', 'character', 'Even', 'director', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'create', 'initial', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'gloominess', 'essentially', 'wasted', 'welter', 'action', 'movie', 'cliches', 'unconvincing', 'heroics.Too', 'bad', 'film', 'open', 'up', 'world', 'film', 'unfamiliar', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'make', 'even', 'pornography', 'denizens', 'toil', 'seem', 'hopelessly', 'humdrum']",N/A

15308,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,076781956X,Tim Janson,"[9, 13]","Nicolas Cage is Tom Welles, a small-time Private investigator living with his wife and baby in relative bliss.  He's contact by a wealthy widow to investigate whether a film she found in her late husband's personal belongings is authentic or not.  The 8MM film shows a girl being brutally raped and murdered...one of those snuff films of urban legend.  Welles takes on the case which leads him into a world of decadence and sleaze that he never knew existed.This underground world isn't one of video store porn but rather the black market of bondage and fetish films, all of which repulse Welles more and more.  He eventually finds out who the girl in the film is but now needs to find those responsible.  He enlists the aid of a porn store clerk Max California, a wannabe musician played wonderfully by Joaquin Phoenix.  He eventually leads him to a sleazy (and how many times am I going to use that word in this review) photographer played by James Gandolfini and then onto a bizzare director named Dino Velvet who makes films on-demand for customers....whatever they want.  Posing as a customer who wants a film made he meets with Velvet played way over the top by Peter Stormare.  When it comes time to make the film, Welles finally comes face to face with the masked, S&M; looking murderer named ""machine"".I enjoyed 8MM much more than most of the critics who couldn't seem to get past the seediness of the subject matter.  Welles wasn't content to just confirm for his client that the tape was authentic.  He could have done that and been back at home in fairly short order.  No, after discovering the tape was real and how the girl died, Welles made it personal.  He wanted to know who did it, why they did it, and he wanted to make them pay.  Nick cage played the role just right by at first being sickened by the crimes and then wanting revenge.  And in getting revenge he also seems to find redemption.

It struck me as being &quot;typically Nicholas Cage,&quot; which I regret as I think he's a far, far better actor than is called for in most of the roles he plays.Yeah, Nick. Get into some films that put your talent to work and you won't have people commenting that you are your uncle's product! You're better than that!While I don't know much about the porn industry, and have little desire to know more, I suspect some of the commentaries thereon are as much on the MYTHS of the industry as on the industry itself.I needn't summarize what everyone already has. Good features included some of the actors, one of them from &quot;Fargo&quot; (sorry, I forget your name), and another from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (in which his role as the psychiatrist/bureaucrat was great for him!) and &quot;The Pelican Brief. Gandolfino was good, and I think this role preceded The Sopranos (in which he's GREAT!) by quite a span of time.One of the more exciting moments is when the porn-brute with the leather mask is forced by Cage to remove it. The guy looks like anyone's chunky cousin Ralph, or Stanley. (If I looked like him, I might put on a leather mask and hope for the best from porn too!) He asks of Cage something like, &quot;What? You didn't think I was human?&quot; Good. Good.Overall it was okay. It was kind of B-movie fare, but better than many of the over-rated Cage films.It's not even close to among the worse movies I've seen. Nor is it, say, of Kubrick value, not by a long shot.

It is still disturbing but I don't find it as bad as the first time I saw it. The topic and what the film is based around is the underbelly society and the horrible side of human behavior in the outlaw culture of underground pornography, specifically snuff films. Snuff films are supposedly an urban legend where some one is raped and or assaulted and then killed on film. The premise revolves around a rich widow who finds a reel of film in her recently deceased husbands safe that contains what appears to be a 'Snuff Film'. She hires family man and P.I. Nicholas Cage to investigate and says she only wants to know if the film is real, who the girl was and if she is alive or if she was murdered on film. This plunges family man Cage into the scummy dark world of outlaw underground porn and the sick disgusting people that bottom feed there.
