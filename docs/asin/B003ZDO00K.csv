1377290,A1LMQHB3ZANNVN,B003ZDO00K,C. Oliver,"[17, 19]","This was a show my family watched together every Sunday night, we turned on the USA network, and sat and enjoyed the stories, the religious overtones, and the unique destruction of the world.  We were all a bit sad when it ended.  I don't know why we never bought the series independently--we got two seasons over the years--but now we're anxious for this set to arrive.The show was always entertaining, though a few episodes got bogged down to where you just wanted to scream, ""How don't you still believe him?""  It was entertaining, funny, witty, scary, dramatic, emotional, and always interesting.  I highly reccomend this show to anyone looking for a show that they might want to share with their teenage children, and something that the family can sit and watch and enjoy.  It really has something for everyone.",5,This Series Was Top Notch,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,816,"['was', 'show', 'family', 'watched', 'together', 'Sunday', 'night', 'turned', 'USA', 'network', 'sat', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'religious', 'overtones', 'unique', 'destruction', 'world', 'were', 'bit', 'sad', 'when', 'ended', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'never', 'bought', 'series', 'independently', 'got', 'two', 'seasons', 'years', 'now', ""'re"", 'anxious', 'set', 'arrive.The', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'entertaining', 'few', 'episodes', 'got', 'bogged', 'down', 'where', 'just', 'wanted', 'scream', 'How', 'do', ""n't"", 'still', 'believe', 'was', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'witty', 'scary', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'always', 'interesting', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'show', 'anyone', 'looking', 'show', 'might', 'want', 'share', 'teenage', 'children', 'something', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'really', 'something', 'everyone']",The Dead Zone: The Complete Series
1377291,A5T08I564I0D5,B003ZDO00K,"DeeJaye6 ""- DeeJaye6""","[17, 17]","SERIESThis was an amazing production by USA Network.  They took the Stephen King novel and played it out into a long (80-episode) series with some fantastic plot twists and a very good (and not overly predictable) continuing story arc.  They did do the same thing with the title that the Christopher Walken movie did; they changed what it meant in the story.  In the book, it's this black area around his visions, and he realizes that the dead zone means that the visions can be changed.  In this series, they punt and call it the part of his brain that lets him see the future.  ""In normal folks, it's a dead zone.""  Uh huh.  Aside from that (extremely minor) complaint, I enjoyed this series.  The casting was very good, too.  A two-year hiatus between the fifth and final seasons did bring about some scheduling problems with some of the actors, and it shows, but they handle it very, very well!There is one more thing about the show that doesn't take a lot from the enjoyment, but must be said.  The first season is a typical 1/2 season, like so many other shows do.  Then they give us mostly a full season in Season 2 with 19 episodes.  Great!  But then they give us only 12 eps each for seasons 3 and 4 and then 11 eps in season 5 and 13 eps in season 6.  Do the math, and you see that seasons 3 and 4 are 24 episodes and so are seasons 5 and 6 together.So, when you price this out, be sure to keep that in mind, and realize that you're really only getting four seasons and not six.DVD SETThis is where I am a little less happy about the show.  First of all, is the first season, with 13 episodes on four discs, and an *empty* disc holder at what should be the Disc 5 slot that advertises that you can get the original pilot episode on a bonus disc if you send in your ""Bounce Back"" card.  That card has not been available for years, but they still sell this set.  The disc is virtually impossible to find, too.  (Beware of an offer I saw regarding Lions Gate selling the ""pilot episode"" on DVD.  It's not the bonus pilot; it's the one that aired and is already in this season.)The second season is perfect.  No complaints at all!  There are 19 episodes on 5 discs, and they are chock full of extras, from commentaries to deleted scenes, to behind-the-scenes featurettes.Third season (while short) is also good, with commentary for all episodes, three behind-the-scenes (BTS) featurettes, and deleted scenes and gag reel.From fourth through sixth seasons, the DVDs become a bit more ""bare bone.""  Fourth season only gives two out of the twelve episodes with commentary, and only one BTS featurette.  It does have deleted scenes.  Fifth season gives you four episodes with commentary (out of 11), deleted scenes, and two featurettes; and the final season only offers four episodes with commentary (out of 13) and 2 featurettes.  No deleted scenes.So, I give USA Network full marks for a good show, but I call shenanigans for them dividing up the last two seasons into what became the last four seasons and then charging folks the same price for those as they did for the first two seasons.  Especially when they give less in the extras in those seasons, too.  This is why I am giving this collection only 4 stars.  The show is incredibly good (5 stars) while the collection itself is more like 2 or 3 stars.  Since the show outweighs the collection in my mind, I give it 4 stars!",4,"Great Series, Poor DVD Set",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,3384,"['SERIESThis', 'was', 'amazing', 'production', 'USA', 'Network', 'took', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'played', 'out', 'long', '80-episode', 'series', 'fantastic', 'plot', 'twists', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'overly', 'predictable', 'continuing', 'story', 'arc', 'did', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'title', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'movie', 'did', 'changed', 'what', 'meant', 'story', 'book', 'black', 'area', 'visions', 'dead', 'zone', 'visions', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'series', 'punt', 'call', 'part', 'brain', 'see', 'future', 'normal', 'folks', 'dead', 'zone', 'Uh', 'huh', 'Aside', 'extremely', 'minor', 'complaint', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'two-year', 'hiatus', 'fifth', 'final', 'seasons', 'did', 'bring', 'scheduling', 'problems', 'actors', 'handle', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'show', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'first', 'season', 'typical', '1/2', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'do', 'Then', 'give', 'mostly', 'full', 'season', 'Season', '2', '19', 'episodes', 'Great', 'then', 'give', 'only', '12', 'eps', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'then', '11', 'eps', 'season', '5', '13', 'eps', 'season', '6', 'Do', 'math', 'see', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'are', '24', 'episodes', 'so', 'are', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'together.So', 'when', 'price', 'out', 'be', 'sure', 'keep', 'mind', 'realize', ""'re"", 'really', 'only', 'getting', 'four', 'seasons', 'not', 'six.DVD', 'SETThis', 'where', 'am', 'little', 'less', 'happy', 'show', 'First', 'first', 'season', '13', 'episodes', 'four', 'discs', '*empty*', 'disc', 'holder', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Disc', '5', 'slot', 'can', 'get', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'bonus', 'disc', 'send', 'Bounce', 'Back', 'card', 'card', 'not', 'been', 'available', 'years', 'still', 'sell', 'set', 'disc', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'find', 'too', 'Beware', 'offer', 'saw', 'regarding', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'selling', 'pilot', 'episode', 'DVD', 'not', 'bonus', 'pilot', 'one', 'aired', 'already', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'perfect', 'complaints', 'are', '19', 'episodes', '5', 'discs', 'are', 'chock', 'full', 'extras', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes.Third', 'season', 'short', 'also', 'good', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'three', 'behind-the-scenes', 'BTS', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel.From', 'fourth', 'sixth', 'seasons', 'DVDs', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'bare', 'bone', 'Fourth', 'season', 'only', 'two', 'twelve', 'commentary', 'only', 'one', 'BTS', 'featurette', 'have', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Fifth', 'season', 'four', 'episodes', 'commentary', '11', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'featurettes', 'final', 'season', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'commentary', '13', '2', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes.So', 'give', 'USA', 'Network', 'full', 'marks', 'good', 'show', 'call', 'shenanigans', 'dividing', 'up', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'what', 'became', 'last', 'four', 'seasons', 'then', 'charging', 'folks', 'same', 'price', 'did', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Especially', 'when', 'give', 'less', 'extras', 'seasons', 'too', 'why', 'am', 'giving', 'collection', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'show', 'incredibly', 'good', '5', 'stars', 'collection', 'more', '2', '3', 'stars', 'show', 'collection', 'mind', 'give', '4', 'stars']",The Dead Zone: The Complete Series
