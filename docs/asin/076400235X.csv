In connection with his return he joins the staff of a local hospital and shortly thereafter falls in love with an older woman he met on the trip from London. (...)

In ""Reckless"", a much younger Mr. Green plays another doctor with a much warmer, more open and comedic attitude that's probably closer to the actor as he is in personal life.  Reminiscent at times of a young Mel Gibson, the impetuous and barely bridled sexual charisma that percolates under the surface of Tony Hill is let out in full display in Owen Springer, and we are powerless to resist.  I can't imagine too many men will cop to liking this movie, unless they are gay.  It unabashedly plays to female fantasies--how many gorgeous young men would actually stand in a pouring rain and say ""I think I'm in love with you""?  A completely unrealistic scenario, perhaps, but one guaranteed to leave a woman weak in the knees, especially delivered with such blue-eyed sincerity as Mr. Green musters.  The plot revolves around marital infidelity and not even the luscious Mr. Green can make that palatable, but we are willing to put aside our distaste because that blue gaze is hypnotic.  I haven't even seen the second half yet, but I imagine that even more of Mr. Green's juicy posterior will be on offer.  I'm not complaining about that!  I'm just surprised that the faintly pretentious ""Masterpiece Theatre"" would go with something so softcore and frankly titillating.  Alaistair Cooke might have rolled over in his grave.
