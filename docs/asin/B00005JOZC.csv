644028,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JOZC,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 3]","Over the past year or so, since he won the Academy Award for best actor for his role as broken down country singer/songwriter Bad Blake in Crazy Hearts I have been reviewing the cinematic work of Jeff Bridges as his films have come into my hands. Most of my reviews have been positive reflecting the very real talent and flare that Jeff Bridges brings to the movies. That said, I am at a lost for why he did the film under review, Stick It, that while marginally entertaining at times is an incredible waste of his time and talent. Now I am not, and never have been, privy to the decisions that actors make about taking on scripts. Maybe they see something in the plot line, maybe they are looking for something a little edgy, or maybe just for the dough, not an unimportant consideration in fickle movie land. But now I can add Jeff Bridges to the vast number of very talented actors that have been in ""turkeys"", for whatever reason.Strangely, it is not the subject matter, the trials and tribulation of a troubled, ex- or maybe not so ex- gymnast (Haley Graham, played by Missy Peregrym) trying tot find her place in the world, the non-monastic gymnastics training world that is off here but the subtext that the teenage rebellion of a gymnast attempting to dramatically change the way the sport is conducted has enough energy to fill an hour and one half film. It really doesn't since an amazing amount of time is spent in various clips of gym activity. And Jeff Bridges as a washed-out (kind of) gym camp owner is in the thick of this thing as Haley's substitute father/confessor. There are plenty of issues (sexual, physical, psychological) that could have been raised by a close look at the cult-like elite gymnastics world (or any high-level sports training) but none, other than a silly attack on the scoring system, are by a film which decided that it did not want to tackle them and played instead to a kind of campy teenage melodrama. And high talent (although poor gymnast and sage) Jeff Bridges got caught in the middle.",2,"Stick It, Yes",1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,2033,"['past', 'year', 'so', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'role', 'broken', 'down', 'country', 'singer/songwriter', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'Crazy', 'Hearts', 'have', 'been', 'reviewing', 'cinematic', 'work', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'hands', 'Most', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'positive', 'reflecting', 'very', 'real', 'talent', 'flare', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'movies', 'said', 'am', 'lost', 'why', 'did', 'film', 'review', 'Stick', 'marginally', 'entertaining', 'times', 'incredible', 'waste', 'time', 'talent', 'Now', 'am', 'not', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'privy', 'decisions', 'actors', 'make', 'taking', 'scripts', 'Maybe', 'see', 'something', 'plot', 'line', 'maybe', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'edgy', 'maybe', 'just', 'dough', 'not', 'unimportant', 'consideration', 'fickle', 'movie', 'land', 'now', 'can', 'add', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'vast', 'number', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'turkeys', 'reason.Strangely', 'not', 'subject', 'matter', 'trials', 'tribulation', 'troubled', 'ex-', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'ex-', 'gymnast', 'Haley', 'Graham', 'played', 'Missy', 'Peregrym', 'trying', 'tot', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'non-monastic', 'gymnastics', 'training', 'world', 'here', 'subtext', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'gymnast', 'attempting', 'dramatically', 'change', 'way', 'sport', 'conducted', 'enough', 'energy', 'fill', 'hour', 'one', 'half', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'various', 'clips', 'gym', 'activity', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'washed-out', 'kind', 'gym', 'camp', 'owner', 'thick', 'thing', 'Haley', 'substitute', 'father/confessor', 'are', 'plenty', 'issues', 'sexual', 'physical', 'psychological', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'close', 'look', 'cult-like', 'elite', 'gymnastics', 'world', 'high-level', 'sports', 'training', 'none', 'other', 'silly', 'attack', 'scoring', 'system', 'are', 'film', 'decided', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'tackle', 'played', 'instead', 'kind', 'campy', 'teenage', 'melodrama', 'high', 'talent', 'poor', 'gymnast', 'sage', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'got', 'caught', 'middle']",N/A

644031,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JOZC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","If you enjoyed `Bring it On', then there is absolutely no reason for you not to enjoy `Stick It', a very similar sports themed chick flick that is nearly just as funny and clever.  Sure, you cannot beat the teen queen sensation that was Kirsten Dunst, but Missy Peregrym (better known for her television work) holds her own amongst BRILLIANT actor Jeff Bridges (this film is so beneath him, but having him on board makes it so much fun).The film is a lighthearted romp that centers around a rebellious teenager named Haley Graham.  A one-time gymnastics pro on her way to getting gold, Haley made a pretty bad name for herself within the world of gymnastics, and so when she is sentenced to enroll in VGA (a prestigious gymnastics academy run by the strict Burt Vickerman) after damaging some property she finds a less than warm welcome.  In fact, she is downright hated and despised by some, especially Joanne Charis, Vickerman's over confident pupil.  Haley has a pretty bad attitude overall, but time softens her, especially as her love for the sport starts to take over her hatred for her circumstances.The film has its fair share of clich&eacute;s, but they are handled with spunk and enough heart to make them fade away.  We focus on the wit and charm of the dialog and the likable characters and so the fact that this offers nothing new doesn't really bother us so much.It's not as good as `Bring it On', but it comes very close.I really liked Missy Peregrym's sarcastic take on Haley's situation.  She seems very real and down to earth, and you can tell she's having a great time; but she never loses her character's inner sense of alienation.  You can tell, right from the start, that there is something much deeper to her careless response to life in general.  Speaking of `fun', Jeff Bridges is a laugh riot here, constantly stealing every scene he's in.  He has settled into his old age (not really, old, but whatever) and has become a seasoned actor who is comfortable enough in his own skin to do just about anything.  This is a nicely constructed supporting role, and one that is not easily forgotten.So, in the end I totally recommend this one.  It is fun and exciting and witty and it has that teen-movie charm that will please the young ones and prove to be a nice guilty pleasure for the adults.It's okay to enjoy this kind of mindless fluff every once in a while.",4,A slaphappy good time...,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2383,"['enjoyed', 'Bring', 'then', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Stick', 'very', 'similar', 'sports', 'themed', 'chick', 'flick', 'nearly', 'just', 'funny', 'clever', 'Sure', 'can', 'not', 'beat', 'teen', 'queen', 'sensation', 'was', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Missy', 'Peregrym', 'better', 'known', 'television', 'work', 'own', 'amongst', 'BRILLIANT', 'actor', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'film', 'so', 'beneath', 'having', 'board', 'so', 'much', 'fun', '.The', 'film', 'lighthearted', 'romp', 'centers', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'named', 'Haley', 'Graham', 'one-time', 'gymnastics', 'pro', 'way', 'getting', 'gold', 'Haley', 'made', 'pretty', 'bad', 'name', 'herself', 'world', 'gymnastics', 'so', 'when', 'sentenced', 'enroll', 'VGA', 'prestigious', 'gymnastics', 'academy', 'run', 'strict', 'Burt', 'Vickerman', 'damaging', 'property', 'less', 'warm', 'welcome', 'fact', 'downright', 'hated', 'despised', 'especially', 'Joanne', 'Charis', 'Vickerman', 'confident', 'pupil', 'Haley', 'pretty', 'bad', 'attitude', 'overall', 'time', 'especially', 'love', 'sport', 'take', 'over', 'hatred', 'circumstances.The', 'film', 'fair', 'share', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'handled', 'spunk', 'enough', 'heart', 'make', 'fade', 'away', 'focus', 'wit', 'charm', 'dialog', 'likable', 'characters', 'so', 'fact', 'nothing', 'new', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'so', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Bring', 'very', 'close.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Missy', 'Peregrym', 'sarcastic', 'take', 'Haley', 'situation', 'very', 'real', 'down', 'earth', 'can', 'tell', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'never', 'character', 'inner', 'sense', 'alienation', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'start', 'something', 'much', 'deeper', 'careless', 'response', 'life', 'general', 'Speaking', 'fun', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'laugh', 'riot', 'here', 'constantly', 'stealing', 'scene', 'settled', 'old', 'age', 'not', 'really', 'old', 'become', 'seasoned', 'actor', 'who', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'own', 'skin', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'nicely', 'constructed', 'supporting', 'role', 'one', 'not', 'easily', 'forgotten.So', 'end', 'totally', 'recommend', 'one', 'fun', 'exciting', 'witty', 'teen-movie', 'charm', 'will', 'please', 'young', 'ones', 'prove', 'be', 'nice', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'adults.It', 'okay', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'once', 'while']",N/A

644037,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B00005JOZC,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 2]","Stick It is one of those sports films that you come away from seeing feeling that it was better than you thought it would be but could have been so much better.Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a wild child. She was once a gymnast who showed great promise before unexpectedly walked away from the sport. After some troubles at home she is sent to the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy run by the surly Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges). It is here that she must once again prove herself and find a new start.This is not Oscar material but it is a good way to spend a few hours in a darkened theatre. The acting is spotty but acceptable. Peregrym shines as Haley but she comes across as a little to cute to be the punky troublemaker that she is made out to be. Bridges is his usual self and his acting is good but this does not appear to be one of his more challenging roles. There is good support from the actual gymnasts who filled in as doubles for the main characters. The secondary characters are somewhat less well developed but are played decently by Vanessa Lengies (Joanne Charis), Nikki SooHoo (Wei Wei Yong) and Maddy Curley (Mina Hoyt).The film has an MTV feel with lots of cuts and booming soundtrack. It's target audience tween and teenage girls and it will be quite effective with this age group. It even teaches a lesson in that things can be changed by working together to make a difference. First time director Jessica Bendinger has done a fine job with her debut film.The true highlight of this disc resides in its bonus features. The film has two comentaries: one by Bendinger and her primary actresses Lengies and Peregrym, the second by Bendinger and DP, Daryn Okada and editor, Troy Takaki. Also featured are 8 deleted scenes with multiple commentaries, a intoductory featurette of the actual gymnasts who acted as stunt doubles, slowed down uneven bar routines (also with optional comentary); routines performed by the elite gymnasts( with commentary) and two music videos.As mentioned this is not a bad film to see with your family and is definately worth a rental.",3,Not So Nice World of Competitive Gymnastics,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,2079,"['Stick', 'one', 'sports', 'films', 'come', 'away', 'seeing', 'feeling', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.Haley', 'Graham', 'Missy', 'Peregrym', 'wild', 'child', 'was', 'once', 'gymnast', 'who', 'showed', 'great', 'promise', 'unexpectedly', 'walked', 'away', 'sport', 'troubles', 'home', 'sent', 'Vickerman', 'Gymnastics', 'Academy', 'run', 'surly', 'Burt', 'Vickerman', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'here', 'must', 'once', 'again', 'prove', 'find', 'new', 'start.This', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'darkened', 'theatre', 'acting', 'spotty', 'acceptable', 'Peregrym', 'shines', 'Haley', 'across', 'little', 'cute', 'be', 'punky', 'troublemaker', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Bridges', 'usual', 'self', 'acting', 'good', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'challenging', 'roles', 'good', 'support', 'actual', 'gymnasts', 'who', 'filled', 'doubles', 'main', 'characters', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'somewhat', 'less', 'well', 'developed', 'are', 'played', 'decently', 'Vanessa', 'Lengies', 'Joanne', 'Charis', 'Nikki', 'SooHoo', 'Wei', 'Wei', 'Yong', 'Maddy', 'Curley', 'Mina', 'Hoyt', '.The', 'film', 'MTV', 'feel', 'lots', 'cuts', 'booming', 'soundtrack', 'target', 'audience', 'tween', 'teenage', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'effective', 'age', 'group', 'even', 'lesson', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'working', 'together', 'make', 'difference', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Jessica', 'Bendinger', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'debut', 'film.The', 'true', 'highlight', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'film', 'two', 'comentaries', 'one', 'Bendinger', 'primary', 'actresses', 'Lengies', 'Peregrym', 'second', 'Bendinger', 'DP', 'Daryn', 'Okada', 'editor', 'Troy', 'Takaki', 'Also', 'featured', 'are', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'multiple', 'commentaries', 'intoductory', 'featurette', 'actual', 'gymnasts', 'who', 'acted', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'slowed', 'down', 'uneven', 'bar', 'routines', 'also', 'optional', 'comentary', 'routines', 'performed', 'elite', 'gymnasts', 'commentary', 'two', 'music', 'videos.As', 'mentioned', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'see', 'family', 'definately', 'worth', 'rental']",N/A
644038,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JOZC,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[1, 2]","Stick It is a good teen movie based on a rebellious girl who is forced to join together with a team of gymnasts as part of her efforts to rehabilitate herself after a brush with the law. Missy Peregrym stars in the lead role as Haley, the former star gymnast with an attitude who feels that child gymnasts are pushed too far by parents and coaches alike and that the rewards of becoming a champion gymnast are not always worth the physical and emotion toll on the body and mind.This movie follows the typical formula of a teen movie with irritable teenage girls, conflicts between teens, conflicts with parents, and a generally positive ending. But in spite of its pretenses, I still liked this movie due to its cast and its overall message. There is enough humor and drama to make this movie worthwhile and while it does display a few signs of stupidity, it never sinks to the low level of some teen movies. It is good enough to keep one's attention and offers enough positive qualities to keep viewers entertained.Besides the generally good script, there is one other interesting aspect of this movie: The choreography. This was something I didn't expect when I decided to watch this movie on DVD and it definitely adds a positive dimension to the viewing experience. Director Jessica Bendinger decided to add overhead shots of the girls doing their gymnast routines in sync and what she created is like watching a spinning pinwheel or a looking through a kaleidoscope. As the girls make their gymnastic moves in unison, it almost seems like filmmaking sleight of hand. But a close look reveals that it is really the gymnasts themselves making these moves.I enjoyed the performances in this movie even though only a few people have any significant amount of time in front of the camera. Jeff Bridges and Missy Peregrym get the greatest amount of camera time and they both perform quite well. Peregrym is an attractive actress but she is transformed into a frustrated, annoyed, rebellious teen who is tired of hearing the same old messages from adults and realizes that age does not necessarily equate with wisdom. Jeff Bridges has been in dozens of Hollywood movies and he can play a wide range of roles. It isn't surprising that he would be selected to play the part of the coach given his skill and his look- one that fits the part of a gymnast coach very nicely. Bridges character is nice, concerned about his girls, and even a little sentimental.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[5, 7]","While yes, this is basically ""Bring It On"", only with gymnastics instead of cheerleading, it's still a fun film that gives a lot of insight into the harsh world of competitive gymnastics.Girls can be catty, and girl gymnasts are no different. When you train most of your life for 8 hours a day or more, while having no social life and nothing to look forward to except some serious injuries and the hope of Olympic gold...things might get a little tense. This is a story of rebellion, and compromise -- of finding yourself, while still trying to find the fun in life. It's cheesy without being stupid, touching without being too heavy, and able to poke fun at itself without forgetting it's core message.Quick Recap: Haley is a power-house gymnast with amazing natural ability...but she throws it all away at the World Championship when she walks out on her team just before her floor routine, and crushes USA's hopes of getting gold. 2 years later, a troubled Haley is forced back into the practice gym after a run-in with the law. Can she resolve her issues with the sport and compete once again? Or will she turn her back on herself and her teammates for a second time?This film certainly tends to over-use montage scenes. Theres a montage for everything. A montage for practice sessions, a montage for training, a montage for in-house meets, a montage for competition, a montage for hanging out with friends...pretty much you can't go 10 minutes without seeing another montage. On the plus side, they have pretty cool music throughout the film, and it helps make the over-abundance of montages hip, fun, and tolerable.The only recognizable gymnast in the film is a cameo role by Nastia Liukin, the current USA championship holder, and probable Olympic medalist (we'll keep our fingers crossed for her and team USA).While the ending is a little contrived, and in no way realistic, it's still worth watching.

I'll also admit that when sports come on, I tend to fall asleep. But there's just something about gymnastics that captures my attention. I think that's part of what made this movie really capture my attention.The plot follows failed gymnastic athlete Hayley as she is forced to rejoin the world she left behind after a biking trick lands her in police custody. Universally hated for throwing her old team's chance at gold at the World Championship, Haley finds that picking up where she left is easier said than done.I really did like this movie. I may not be able to understand everything that the gymnasts go through, but this movie made everyone's struggles easy to relate to. I also liked that the characters were well layered. Sure, we can all see Haley's reasons for being who she is but it takes a good script & acting to show that the mean girl teammate Joanne also has her reasons for being who she is. I really do like that they aren't pushing the whole ""mean people are mean & the good people are good"". I also loved Jeff Bridges in this movie. He pretty much made the movie for me.I just really liked that this movie didn't fall prey to the usual cliches of teen & feel good movies.

A rather amazing pirouette on a bike lands her in trouble with the police, and she is sentenced by a judge to either go to juvenile detention or to a gymnastics camp, and she soon finds herselfe under the tutelage of Burt Vickerman, played by Jeff Bridges, a trainer that is tough, demanding, will take nothing from her, and sees through her every manipulation.Burt Vickerman has the reputation of getting all his students injured, but as he says...

644057,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JOZC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","Yeah, I kinda dig gymnastics. So, sue me. I wish I could flip and whirl thru the air like a gymnast or a kung-fu master. Matter of fact, I also enjoy figure skating (another skill I suck at). But, listen, unless you yourself are immersed in that oh-so-competitive, high-profile world, there's no way to fully fathom the amount of training and dedication, the blood, ache, and sweat, the pressures and self-sacrifice that these kids undergo. And remember, they start out at a really young age, so, basically, their formative years are consumed by their sport. It's hard for me to wrap my brain around such dedication and focus, to the exclusion of everything else that usually typifies tot- and teenhood. So I'm drawn to movies like STICK IT, and, every now and then, I'm down with donating some of my not-very-precious time and watching films that normally aren't my first choices. STICK IT is a teen film which obviously caters more to girls. However, folks outside the Britney Spears-adoring target audience might find interesting, if not enlightening, the movie's message about the downsides of conformity and, also, its pointed commentary on the strict staidness and old-fashioned stupidity of this sport's judging system.Two years ago, troubled gymnast Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym, LIFE AS WE KNOW IT and SMALLVILLE) walked out of her routine and caused Team USA's shot at the Gold medal. Nowadays, Haley is a slacker-clad, sassy and rebellious teen who hates her parents and is in trouble with the law. After an encounter with the police, she is given two options: either attend the Texas Military Academy or a facility called the VGA (Vickerman Gymnastics Academy) or spend time in juvenile incarceration. She opts for the VGA and re-enters the world of tumbling, where her reputation has taken a decidedly downhill turn. Her contrary, free-spirited, tomboy persona immediately puts her at odds with the VGA's controlling coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges), who has a reputation for pushing his charges too hard. Too, the other gymnasts treat her with scorn and suspicion. Haley as a gymnast is raw power, who boldly  engages her routines with a high degree of difficulty, but she suffers from a lack of consistency. And, initially, she refuses any kind of assistance. But, over time, and, mostly thru the no-nonsense care and training of Coach Vickerman, who becomes a surrogate father to her, Haley overcomes what ails her, begins to work with her teammates, and gets a shot at placing in the Neutrogena National Gymnastics Championships. But, ultimately, it all comes down to this: exactly just how important is winning? ""Stick it"" is, of course, a gymnastics term for nailing your dismount. ""Stick it"" can also be used as a derogatory term, specially when referring to the Man. When it matters most, Haley must decide which definition of STICK IT she wants to live with.I can't exactly put my finger on it, but Missy Peregrym kind of reminds me Hilary Swank when Swank starred in THE NEXT KARATE KID. I haven't seen that movie in years so I can't break it down any more, except to say that Missy has...something, a star quality. The same presence that Swank showed, even in that karate stinker. Missy has got that certain something that will make you remember her the next time she's in a flick. She rocks hard as the movie lead, Haley Graham, as she quite nonchalantly carries this film on her shoulders. Missy seems to be a natural athlete, and I easily bought into her gymnastics credentials. STICK IT might actually have benefited from even more of her first-person narration, as I found her voice-overs to be very personable. As the troubled Haley, Missy doesn't really bring anything new to the fold, as her ""angry, smart-mouth teen, with issues"" portrayal falls firmly in the ""been there, done that"" category. But, don't get me wrong, she's still very effective in her role and most definitely holds the film together. Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is just okay as the other lead of note, Burt Vickerman, although I personally think he should be better than he shows here as the assertive but gruffly caring coach. And, as a backhanded compliment, kudos to the actors who played the gymnastic officials and judges, for all of whom I actively feel distaste. I'm actually outraged that points could be deducted off a performance should the athlete's bra-strap be visible.Ultimately, STICK IT does end up being somewhat of a shallow, though family-friendly, cinematic effort. I really couldn't fully buy into the film's far-fetched climactic sequences, which could've benefited from more invested groundwork earlier in the film. But, other than Haley's insubordinate nature, I had no foreshadowing of these eventual outrageous acts of insurgency, and there was a second where I was flabbergasted. Don't get me wrong, they were nice moments and I, fairly quickly, ended up cheering, but, still...no, not very believable. When compared to Writer/Director Jessica Bendinger's breezy and stronger BRING IT ON, STICK IT stumbles. But, at least, it does try to positively impact the viewer and is sufficiently bolstered by an energetic lead performance, by enough funny, silly moments, and by a diverting, though predictable, storyline. There possibly could've been more in-depth scenes detailing what goes on beneath the surface of the gymnastics world. But, yeah, this is a teen movie, not an expose film. So, three stars for STICK IT, which will entertain the young 'uns, amuse the older 'uns, as well as make them shake their heads at and mentally boo the sport's rusty, behind-the-times judging establishment.",3,"""It doesn't matter how well you do.

With her exceptional talent, she transformed words into memorable cheers and brought lines to life with considerable ease. Her writing skill has continued to shine over the last few years, much to my delight, however her writing is sorely missed when it comes to the 'Bring It On' sequels 'Bring It On Again', 'Bring It On: All or Nothing', and 'Bring It On': In It To Win It. It's a good thing Jessica stayed away from these because 'Bring It On' is a classic. She also served as a producer on the film 'The Wedding Date' in 2005. A newer area of film production for her I'd love to see more of. Jessica also penned the screenplay for 'Aquamarine', and made it very enjoyable. In Jessica's writing is where her real talent excells and her success is assured that, in terms of 'Bring It On' have never been duplicated. The woman who 'Brings It' also knows full well how to 'Stick It', because Jessica knows her audience and doesn't insult their intelligence but always comes up with something unique and smart. Jessica makes her directional debut with 'Stick It', and does some tremendous work. The competitive world of gymnastics is put to the test when street-smart Hayley Graham goes before the judge after being caught at the scene of a crime. There she is enrolled into gymnastics as a form of punishment for her crimes against society. Hayley used to be a fantastic gymnist until she walked out on her team the day of a very important competition. Now she must right her wrongs and regain her team's trust. She has to stick to her routine and play by the rules and be a standout in her profession. Hayley is sure to stand out and she'll go to any length to do it even if she has to bring the rest of her team down with her. She could change the rules of gymnastics forever. The stunts in this first scene made me think of the film 'The Lords of Dogtown'. It would be harder then you think, but more exciting then you imagine, because when all is said and done, there is nothing more rewarding then watching films like this. When film captures the talent on show here it's an added bonus and you know it's all worth it. 'Stick It' stands out and is anything but routine.

644066,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JOZC,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[17, 25]","""Stick It"" had tough competition right out of the gates.  Written and directed by ""Bring It On"" writer, Jessica Bendinger, everyone expected something along the same lines as that cheerleading comedy which, as time has passed, has become rather tired and corny.  In all honesty, I feel that ""Stick It"" has potential to remain a solid film long after ""Bring It On"" has begun to gather dust on the DVD shelf.In ""Stick It,"" the very unlikeable Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) winds up in court and her only options to stay out of jail are Texas Military Academy or VGA, Vickerman Gymnastics Academy, headed up by Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).  You see, Graham has a past in the gymnastics world, and she isn't welcomed very warmly, especially by her new teammates.  Graham is obnoxious, selfish, and pretty much a brat.  But as the film progresses and we begin to see more layers peel off of Graham's fake tough outer shell, we realize that she isn't all that terrible.The climax of the film is very unbelievable, but it works in the format that it's presented in.  Bridges and Peregrym play off of each other very well, and you eventually hope to see both succeed in the end.  The supporting cast is wonderful, especially Peregrym's gymnastics mates, Joanna (Vanessa Lengies), Wei Wei (Nikki SooHoo), and Mina (Maddy Curley).  These three alone are worth watching this film.  Hopefully they will all have solid future careers.Overall, this film is sort of formulaic, but it has just enough edge and just enough comedy to keep it from going stale.  It fortunately tones down some of the silliness that plagued ""Bring It On,"" and finds a decent balance between giddy teen fun and decent drama.  The gymnastics sequences are nice to watch, but it's the training sequences that can become painful to see.Mildly recommended to fans of teen comedy, but for those who enjoy decent drama/comedy, this is a definite flick to watch.",4,It's Not Quite A Ten,1163116800,"11 10, 2006",2006,1919,"['Stick', 'had', 'tough', 'competition', 'right', 'gates', 'Written', 'directed', 'Bring', 'writer', 'Jessica', 'Bendinger', 'everyone', 'expected', 'something', 'same', 'lines', 'cheerleading', 'comedy', 'time', 'passed', 'become', 'rather', 'tired', 'corny', 'honesty', 'feel', 'Stick', 'potential', 'remain', 'solid', 'film', 'long', 'Bring', 'begun', 'gather', 'dust', 'DVD', 'shelf.In', 'Stick', 'very', 'unlikeable', 'Haley', 'Graham', 'Missy', 'Peregrym', 'up', 'court', 'only', 'options', 'stay', 'jail', 'are', 'Texas', 'Military', 'Academy', 'VGA', 'Vickerman', 'Gymnastics', 'Academy', 'headed', 'up', 'Burt', 'Vickerman', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'see', 'Graham', 'past', 'gymnastics', 'world', ""n't"", 'welcomed', 'very', 'warmly', 'especially', 'new', 'teammates', 'Graham', 'obnoxious', 'selfish', 'pretty', 'much', 'brat', 'film', 'progresses', 'begin', 'see', 'more', 'layers', 'peel', 'Graham', 'fake', 'tough', 'outer', 'shell', 'realize', ""n't"", 'terrible.The', 'climax', 'film', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'format', 'presented', 'Bridges', 'Peregrym', 'play', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'eventually', 'hope', 'see', 'succeed', 'end', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Peregrym', 'gymnastics', 'mates', 'Joanna', 'Vanessa', 'Lengies', 'Wei', 'Wei', 'Nikki', 'SooHoo', 'Mina', 'Maddy', 'Curley', 'three', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'have', 'solid', 'future', 'careers.Overall', 'film', 'sort', 'formulaic', 'just', 'enough', 'edge', 'just', 'enough', 'comedy', 'keep', 'going', 'stale', 'fortunately', 'down', 'silliness', 'plagued', 'Bring', 'decent', 'balance', 'giddy', 'teen', 'fun', 'decent', 'drama', 'gymnastics', 'sequences', 'are', 'nice', 'watch', 'training', 'sequences', 'can', 'become', 'painful', 'see.Mildly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'teen', 'comedy', 'who', 'enjoy', 'decent', 'drama/comedy', 'definite', 'flick', 'watch']",N/A
644067,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JOZC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 5]","As I sat down to watch ""Stick It,"" I had a pretty good idea that we were going to cover some fairly conventional territory. And I was right, to a degree. Rebellious teen....check. Underdog sports story....check. Finding acceptance....check. When just about every film made about the world of sports falls into a familiar pattern, the genre itself has become something of a cliche'. That's not to say all sports films are bad, but few hold any real surprise. ""Stick It,"" for all its limitations, does at least attempt something different. For in its climactic moments, the film is not only glorifying teamwork, friendship, and individual responsibility (as you would expect)--it is also serving as a critique of the oft maligned scoring system practiced in the field of gymnastics. Yes, this slight tale starts to take on elements of rebellion and unity as a ""Norma Rae"" for the teen set.One of the primary issues with ""Stick It,"" however, might be a misleading advertising campaign. Capitalizing on having the screenwriter of ""Bring It On,"" ""Stick It"" (even the title begs a comparison) is setup as the same type of movie. And it's not. ""Bring It On"" is a robust comedy with elements of sporting, ""Stick It"" is a sporting coming-of-age story with elements of comedy. So many might be approaching this film with the wrong expectations. And those settling in for a night of laughs will surely be disappointed. But, I do believe this film does have an audience--obviously those with an interest in gymnastics, teens to young adults, and I'd guess primarily female.The film stars Missy Peregrym as a troubled girl (and ex-athlete) who runs afoul of the law. Her father arranges for her to attend a controversial gymnastics academy run by a washed-up coach, Jeff Bridges. At first, an outcast--she soon learns many valuable lessons, as do we all. You can guess this by-the-numbers story without me discussing it any further. Let's just say, we end up at a championship competition and that's where the unexpected protest of the status quo is staged.Look, I didn't love ""Stick It""--but some might. The actors are generally appealing, but clearly this isn't ambitious or serious-minded filmmaking. The soundtrack is appropriate, the gymnastics can be impressive, and I did enjoy the camera work that turned many of the practice sessions into Busby Berkeley style extravaganzas. Certainly not for everyone, but if the idea of ""Stick It"" appeals to you--I'm guessing you'll probably like it. If it doesn't sound like you're kind of movie, there probably isn't enough that's unique or compelling within the film to change your mind. Recommended slightly for the right audience.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 3]","Stick It is a teen-comedy about a former gymnast turned BMX biker who gets sent back to an elite gymnastics program after pulling a reckless stunt. When she's given the choice between the Texas Military Academy or VGA (the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy), Haley Graham chooses the former. Unfortunately, her judge has a sense of humor and sends her to VGA.After walking out on the world championships before her floor exercise and costing Team USA the gold, Haley is not the most popular girl in the gym. In fact, she's downright hated to the point of people throwing drinks in her face. Still she perseveres when her coach tells her that if she participates in one contest, she might earn enough money to pay her fine and return to her life of crime.Stick It isn't as funny as Bring It On, in my opinion, but it makes up for it in other ways. The humor is more toned down but still full of great one-liners. Case in point are lines like, ""I have a constitutional right to bare arms,"" and ""Coach if you do this you'll have a cardiovasectomy."" It's stupid humor, but amusing nonetheless.

Missy Peregrym, best known for her work on the WB's ""Smallville"", gets her first leading role in what some critics (i.e. Me) are calling one of the worst films of the year.  Peregrym plays Haley Graham (if there ever was such a tween name, this would be it), a former gymnast who was disqualified for walking out on Team USA in an important match.  After bailing, she does the bad girl role and does ridiculous bike tricks and gets in trouble with the cops.  Doing some damage after crashing her bike into a window, she is sentenced to doing gymnastics at the Gymnastics Academy in Houston.  This punishment makes absolutely no sense, but, then, neither does the rest of the film.  Jeff Bridges is the head of the Academy, and, if I remember the show right, Richard Roeper said (pardon the paraphrasing) something to the effect that Jeff Bridges must have gotten arrested, and the judge's sentence was probably to make him to the film ""Stick It"".  I can see no reason as to why Bridges would go from an incredible performance in ""The Door in the Floor"" (based on John Irving's brilliant novel ""A Widow for One Year"") to doing such a campy and cliche film like ""Stick It"".  I am completely flabbergasted.  Maybe he needed the money.  Anyway, after Haley gets to the Academy, the film becomes (or maybe already was) extremely predictible, and one can probably guess that Haley will be tormented by those who are angry with her truancy of the Team USA incident, and will also be able to predict the final climactic scene in which Haley will ""show 'em what she's got."" While some people see a film about the struggles of one young girl, all I see is camp, camp, camp, and more camp, with a large serving of predictibility, mixed together to create a giant turd of a film.  Pardon my vulgarity, but I just can't seem to come up with a better description.  There are thousands of films about the troubled athlete and the incredible coach, and no film gets it quite as wrong as ""Stick it"".  Knowing the great actor that is Jeff Bridges, he will no doubt rebound from this atrocity, much like his rebound from 2003's misfire, ""Masked and Anonymous"".  Peregrym is one of those actresses that litters teeny-bopper magazine, much like Devon Sawa, Channing Tatum, and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas, who will remain to be big for a few months and then quietly forgotten.  The WB's ""Smallville"" is as Tween as shows come (for God's sake, it's the WB, the same network that made Dawson's Creek) and Peregrym is no different.
