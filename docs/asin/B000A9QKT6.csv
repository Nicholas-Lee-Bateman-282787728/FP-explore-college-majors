The show looked promising from the trailers. A gothik little drama with a hint of Buffy (the greatest show to ever air). The pilot was ok. Too obviously was it as a blend of The O.C. and the movie ""The Omen"". and they both don't mix. One, ""The O.C."" sucks and shouldn't blend with anything. After the first four episodes the show turned more towards the supernatural and improved but got cancelled after eight episodes, sadly. Thankfully, this DVD set includes the last 5 episodes that never aired and they are good. Especially the last 3 episodes which are phenominal!! Absolutely brilliant!!!! It was a very unconventional ending!!!!! The only special feature is a 14 minute making-of-featurette which is better than nothing! Especially since the making-of-featurettes FOX supplies on their DVDs are usually very cheap (4 minutes at best).

924513,AGZZM0UG0PPGA,B000A9QKT6,"Beeshy ""AliciA""","[0, 0]",*Contains spoilers. Just finished watching Point Pleasant + I was really surprised at how good it was. From the moment Christina is pulled out of the ocean Point Pleasant begins to be well less pleasant. Her prescence begins to magnify everyone's emotions. Including that of Jesse(her rescuer) who seems to be extremely drawn to her and the Kramer's who take her in. As she begins to realize who she is and what she can do things begin to unravel. Her struggle to overcome her dark side comes w/ a price to those around her. And as things don't pan out for Christina she uses her dark abilities more and more. Jesse + Christina's realationship goes from hot to cold when he realizes he's the one that's supposed to stop her. Needless to say being on opposite sides of good + evil puts a strain on their relationship. For the Kramer's well things begin to implode as Christina goes dark side. I'll let you see for yourself how the show ends. But I have to tell you that it being cancelled does leave a very big cliffhanger w/ no resolution. That's the reason for the missing star which like most cancelled shows there is no follow through. Not even w/ the little commentary that there is you don't get anything extra than what you see. But then again it does leave room for you to fill in the blanks on your own if your good at that sort of thing.

924516,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000A9QKT6,Brett Corkins,"[10, 13]","Point Pleasant is a great show, plain and simple. The plot is engaging and ever-evolving, the acting, in most cases, is great, and it's left me thinking about it days after seeing the final episode. If one single show can do that, I consider that a big accomplishment. Forget that Point Pleasant was cancelled, forget they didn't even air the final five episodes, I think it ended rightfully. I loved the Kramer's (well, I loved Judy, I didn't much like Meg or Ben), but I don't want to watch them follow Christina for an entire season. Seeing how Christina grasped her powers throughout the season, seeing how she dealt with love and anger, seeing how much she wanted to know her mom, all of that worked wonderfully. What would she have done in the next season? Kill people? No, it ended how it should've.SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD!Point Pleasant's plot isn't difficult to comprehend. Christina is the daughter of satan. She's somehow sent to a quaint town, Point Pleasant, because a priest had foreseen that a young girl would be the one to commence the end of days. When she shows signs of grasping her true abilities (i.e., being able to do anything imaginable), a man, Boyd, comes to influence her to come to the dark side (excuse the Star Wars reference). But in the end, it's all up to Christina in what happens with Point Pleasant.My biggest gripe with Point Pleasant is the sub-plots. Interesting? Sometimes. Needed? Not entirely. We can see from the get-go that Ben Kramer doesn't think his wife, Meg, is sane. What we don't need is nearly entire episodes devoted solely to those two characters. I want to see how Boyd influences the town. I want to see how Christina deals with her emotions. I want to see how Judy and Christina really get along. Those are what I want to see, I don't want to see how some ex-girlfriend of a main character goes on without him. I don't care. That aside, when Point Pleasant is focused on Christina, it's chilling, it's engaging, it's hard to look away.If the plot catches your attention and you think you might like it, check it out. Sure the only bonus feature is a 'making of' but the episodes speak for themselves. There's suspense, there's humor, there's love. Point Pleasant was destined to fail. It deals too closely with religion and believing, but if that stuff doesn't bother you than you just may have found a show that won't disappoint.PS.

But after those first few episodes that aired, the show did come together and become something really good.

924526,A2H1WNB30JNAWU,B000A9QKT6,Jack D. Lowry,"[0, 0]",Point Pleasant is a very good series no matter what other reviwers have said about the series.  I wondered why I enjoyed the theme song so much come to find out it is done by Tim Burton's composer Danny Elfman.  Bascially storyline is good vs evil as the characters develop over the episodes.  As the series progress little by little Christina's powers become more known for the bad in her but people see the good in her also.  It also has some good actors staring in it I reconize the main bad guy from Melrose Place from Fox.  The storyline progress and people have to choice which sides they are on either good or bad then people start to disappear and head to the church.  Jesse and Christina get closer and Jesse senses bad things about Christina and what shall happen to the town they live in if he doesn't do something about it but someone warns him thou shall not kill but does he listen... you have to buy the series to see for yourself.  Overall I liked all of it just had a few dragging moments in some of the scenes but overall I give it a 4 star rating because it keep my intrest from first to 13 episode.  So if your looking for a mixture of drama science fiction so forth then pick this show up and enjoy some good drama science fiction and action sprikle here and there.,4,Good Series no matter what people say,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1286,"['Point', 'Pleasant', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'matter', 'what', 'other', 'reviwers', 'have', 'said', 'series', 'wondered', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'theme', 'song', 'so', 'much', 'come', 'find', 'out', 'done', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'composer', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'Bascially', 'storyline', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'characters', 'develop', 'episodes', 'series', 'progress', 'little', 'little', 'Christina', 'powers', 'become', 'more', 'known', 'bad', 'people', 'see', 'good', 'also', 'also', 'good', 'actors', 'staring', 'reconize', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Fox', 'storyline', 'progress', 'people', 'have', 'choice', 'sides', 'are', 'good', 'bad', 'then', 'people', 'start', 'disappear', 'head', 'church', 'Jesse', 'Christina', 'get', 'closer', 'Jesse', 'bad', 'things', 'Christina', 'what', 'shall', 'happen', 'town', 'live', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'someone', 'thou', 'shall', 'not', 'kill', 'listen', 'have', 'buy', 'series', 'see', 'Overall', 'liked', 'just', 'had', 'few', 'dragging', 'moments', 'scenes', 'overall', 'give', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'keep', 'intrest', 'first', '13', 'episode', 'So', 'looking', 'mixture', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'so', 'forth', 'then', 'pick', 'show', 'up', 'enjoy', 'good', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'action', 'sprikle', 'here', 'there']",Point Pleasant - The Complete Series

I haven't been able to stop watching since I got it.  I can only guess the bad reviewers were not fans of Dallas and the like?  This show is a great blend of the nightime soaps and the supernatural genre.  I agree with the comparisons to Dark Shadows.  While this show is not perfect; I was hooked from the pilot.  I found the acting and story to be quite good and a creepy feeling of dread pervaded the show from the beginning....making for some nice chills up your spine.  Very rarely will a show start out being all it can be.  The only example I have EVER seen of a show being absolutely perfect from the first minute is Wonderfalls!  The main flaw I had with this show is that I don't think it could have gone for more than one season and remained the unique, interesting show it was.  The whole premise revolved around Christina finding out who she was and fighting her dark nature.  Will she fight for good or evil?  Once that decision is made, basically the show is over or if it continued you would have a killer of the week trying to off Chris for various reasons.  One person responded to a reviewer that Chris went ""evil"".  I totally disagree with that.  ***SPOILER ALERT***Had she truly gone evil the whole town and the people would be dead, wiped off the map, period.  She let them live....they can still save her, deep down, she is good and wants to be good.  I can excuse her killing Jesse.....God he was WAY too goody goody anyway and totally betrayed her.

It was a great good vs. evil plot with good actors, too.  I had to buy this collection so I could see what happened in the last couple of episodes.It begins with a pretty young girl (maybe in her 20s) found floating in the ocean.  She has no memory of who she is and a local family takes her in.  The family has a daughter about the same age so they become like sisters.  Things start to heat up rather quickly as a local boy gets interested in her while the boy's girlfriend gets jealous.  Slowly, the new girl begins to discover that she has some unusual abilities, especially when she gets mad. All kinds of little conflicts begin to develop and you begin to realize she is the daughter of Satan.  Grant Show (""Sex & the Single Mom"") is also great as a sort of emissary for Satan, sent to watch over his daughter.  There is a lot of conflict with the daughter because she is constantly resisting her ""powers"".  She does not want to be ""bad"" or hurt people.Even though it only plays in one series, it ends well enough to satisfy you.  It also ends where they could continue the series if they really wanted to.

Even though the story is often predictable, there is an element of surprise-often frightening at times. One reason I especially like the series is the thread of good vs. evil.  It is more than your typical battle-there is a reminder that there is light and darkness in everyone-in all of us. Circumstances and people impact others in this respect throughout the series.Often, the difference between evil and good in the characters are not easily distinguishable.

However, for everything that Point Pleasant does right, it does a lot wrong.  The storyline centers around a girl named Christina (Elisabeth Harnois) who is taken in by a family and is soon revealed to be none other than the daughter of Satan, and will play a role in the coming apocalypse.  The storyline is nothing new, but there was a lot of room here to work with to make the show something special, but thanks to Fox it never took off.  Grant Show is undoubtadly the best part of the series as the evil Lucas Boyd, but the rest of the cast isn't anything to write home about.  Besides TV veteran Richard Burgi and Starship Troopers' Dina Meyer, the rest of the cast is stiff and wooden, but when it appears that they were cast on mostly their looks alone, this isn't much of a surprise.  The story has it's share of fumbles and predictability and it's too melodramatic for it's own good, but that is something that occurs with most first seasons before the show really takes off (remember the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?).  Speaking of Buffy, it should be noted that Point Pleasant is co-created by Buffy alum Marti Noxon (who it is rumored tried to recruit James ""Spike"" Marsters for the show in a guest role), so who knows what direction the show could have taken had Fox given it more of a chance.  Just like countless other sci-fi/dramas to hit Fox over the past decade, Point Pleasant was axed too early by the geniuses at Fox, but for die hard fans of the show, this DVD set is a must have, although a few more extras would have been more than welcome.",3,Another show axed by Fox and never given the time to grow,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,1707,"['Axed', 'Fox', 'airing', 'eight', 'episodes', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'was', 'handfull', 'shows', 'never', 'get', 'time', 'needed', 'grow', 'However', 'everything', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'right', 'lot', 'wrong', 'storyline', 'centers', 'girl', 'named', 'Christina', 'Elisabeth', 'Harnois', 'who', 'taken', 'family', 'soon', 'revealed', 'be', 'none', 'other', 'daughter', 'Satan', 'will', 'play', 'role', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'storyline', 'nothing', 'new', 'there', 'was', 'lot', 'room', 'here', 'work', 'make', 'show', 'something', 'special', 'thanks', 'Fox', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'Grant', 'Show', 'undoubtadly', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'evil', 'Lucas', 'Boyd', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'Besides', 'TV', 'veteran', 'Richard', 'Burgi', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'rest', 'cast', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'when', 'were', 'cast', 'mostly', 'looks', 'alone', ""n't"", 'much', 'surprise', 'story', 'share', 'fumbles', 'predictability', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'own', 'good', 'something', 'most', 'first', 'seasons', 'show', 'really', 'off', 'remember', 'first', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Speaking', 'Buffy', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'co-created', 'Buffy', 'alum', 'Marti', 'Noxon', 'who', 'rumored', 'tried', 'recruit', 'James', 'Spike', 'Marsters', 'show', 'guest', 'role', 'so', 'who', 'what', 'direction', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'had', 'Fox', 'given', 'more', 'chance', 'Just', 'countless', 'other', 'sci-fi/dramas', 'hit', 'Fox', 'past', 'decade', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'was', 'axed', 'too', 'early', 'geniuses', 'Fox', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'show', 'DVD', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'few', 'more', 'extras', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'welcome']",Point Pleasant - The Complete Series

924546,AIHLEAPP98XU9,B000A9QKT6,"prydain16 ""~C""","[33, 33]","**MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS*""Point Pleasant"" is a gothic soap opera created by Marti Noxon, best known as the woman who writes great depressing stories on The WB's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". I am a huge fan of ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"", but I personally enjoy ""Point Pleasant"" better.Now don't get me wrong. This show has serious problems, it's biggest one being that the pilot was specially designed to best ensure a pickup by FOX. It has many elements of ""The OC"" and FOX was right in thinking it would work best with ""The OC"" compared to the other shows on their schedule.""Point Pleasant"" has loads of potential. Everything is there. A great premise, capable actors, beautiful locations, character backstories, everything that was there could have become a huge ongoing battle between good and evil, with the forces of heaven and hell battling on Earth. And I do believe that's what it would have become if the writers were able to run with it.What 13 episodes there are, however, are still good even with their faults. The actors aren't exactly award-winners, but they get the job done quite nicely. Elisabeth Harnois, our protaganist, is the perfect choice for the daughter of Satan and a God-fearing woman. She's beautiful, and usually angelic but can become overcome with her hellborn powers in an instant. Harnois is good at instant transitions and I love the scenes where her character knows that she's too weak to drown her evil nature but doesn't know what to do. Anyway, the series opens up on Point Pleasant, New Jersey, although we're not sure if this is Point Pleasant or the town of Point Pleasant Beach. There's a difference. But it's a nice day with hot girls sunbathing on the beach, but an otherwordly storm quickly gathers and runs everyone off the beach. Jesse, a young lifeguard, spots something floating in the ocean and swims out. It's Christina. He takes her to the Kramers since the roads are closed so the doctor can look at her.Soon Christina is living with the Kramers, and befriends their daughter Judy, whose older sister died years earlier. Her mother still has not gotten over it.The show begins to shed its allusions of ""The OC"" immediately, although it does not completely do so until about the fifth episode. We see the characters evolve. The town whore soon stops her ways and tries to make things right, the love triangles become actually important to the actual story, etc. The series uses LOTS of symbolism and is very, very smart with it, proving that it is not the shallow waste of time people claim it to be.The character relationships and the things that happen are important to whether the townspeople will be on the side of evil or the side of good. Judy's mother realizes that she is not crazy like people believe, but she has a connection with the spirit world and may be psychic. We also discover that Jesse died as a child but came back, and he is destined to kill Christina, the Antichrist, even though they have an unbearable attraction for one another. This adds much flavor and promise to the show, as Christina does not WANT to be evil and tries fighting it, yet people keep having visions of what she's destined to do to the town, and it's not pleasant. (Pun not intended.)As different as the two shows are, ""Point Pleasant"" could be compared to ""Dark Shadows"". Both are a part of an extremely rare breed. How many gothic/horror soaps appear on television? Not many at all. ""Dark Shadows"", both the 60s and 90s versions, are also favorites of mine. And the short-lived CBS horror drama ""American Gothic"" was similar in style to ""Point Pleasant"", so if you like those shows you might want to check out ""Point Pleasant"".Other things I'd like to point out is the EXCELLENT music used in the opening title sequence. It was written by Danny Elfman, who also did the ""Desperate Housewives"" theme song and has done nearly every Tim Burton film. The music used throughout the show, while not written by Elfman, is also good and sets up the atmosphere nicely. The filmwork is also nice, and looks great in widescreen, and a blue film is used quite a bit and it can be effective.Overall the show is good, but it's no surprise many ""Buffy"" fans were displeased, because the two shows are completely different. However, if you are into dark, religious themed shows and movies or you just like creepy supernatural adventures, ""Point Pleasant"" is definitely worth a buy or rent.",4,Something Wicked Has Washed Ashore,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,4418,"['**MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SLIGHT', 'SPOILERS*', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'gothic', 'soap', 'opera', 'created', 'Marti', 'Noxon', 'best', 'known', 'woman', 'who', 'great', 'depressing', 'stories', 'WB', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'better.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'show', 'serious', 'problems', 'biggest', 'one', 'being', 'pilot', 'was', 'specially', 'designed', 'best', 'ensure', 'pickup', 'FOX', 'many', 'elements', 'OC', 'FOX', 'was', 'right', 'thinking', 'would', 'work', 'best', 'OC', 'compared', 'other', 'shows', 'schedule', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'loads', 'potential', 'Everything', 'there', 'great', 'premise', 'capable', 'actors', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'character', 'backstories', 'everything', 'was', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'huge', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'forces', 'heaven', 'hell', 'battling', 'Earth', 'do', 'believe', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'writers', 'were', 'able', 'run', '13', 'episodes', 'are', 'however', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'even', 'faults', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'award-winners', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Elisabeth', 'Harnois', 'protaganist', 'perfect', 'choice', 'daughter', 'Satan', 'God-fearing', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'usually', 'angelic', 'can', 'become', 'overcome', 'hellborn', 'powers', 'instant', 'Harnois', 'good', 'instant', 'transitions', 'love', 'scenes', 'where', 'character', 'too', 'weak', 'drown', 'evil', 'nature', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Anyway', 'series', 'up', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'New', 'Jersey', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'town', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'Beach', 'difference', 'nice', 'day', 'hot', 'girls', 'sunbathing', 'beach', 'otherwordly', 'storm', 'quickly', 'gathers', 'everyone', 'beach', 'Jesse', 'young', 'lifeguard', 'spots', 'something', 'floating', 'ocean', 'out', 'Christina', 'Kramers', 'roads', 'are', 'closed', 'so', 'doctor', 'can', 'look', 'her.Soon', 'Christina', 'living', 'Kramers', 'daughter', 'Judy', 'older', 'sister', 'died', 'years', 'earlier', 'mother', 'still', 'not', 'gotten', 'it.The', 'show', 'shed', 'allusions', 'OC', 'immediately', 'not', 'completely', 'do', 'so', 'fifth', 'episode', 'see', 'characters', 'evolve', 'town', 'whore', 'soon', 'ways', 'tries', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'love', 'become', 'actually', 'important', 'actual', 'story', 'etc', 'series', 'LOTS', 'symbolism', 'very', 'very', 'smart', 'proving', 'not', 'shallow', 'waste', 'time', 'people', 'claim', 'be.The', 'character', 'relationships', 'things', 'happen', 'are', 'important', 'townspeople', 'will', 'be', 'side', 'evil', 'side', 'good', 'Judy', 'mother', 'not', 'crazy', 'people', 'believe', 'connection', 'spirit', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'psychic', 'also', 'discover', 'Jesse', 'died', 'child', 'came', 'back', 'destined', 'kill', 'Christina', 'Antichrist', 'even', 'have', 'unbearable', 'attraction', 'one', 'much', 'flavor', 'promise', 'show', 'Christina', 'not', 'WANT', 'be', 'evil', 'fighting', 'yet', 'people', 'keep', 'having', 'visions', 'what', 'destined', 'do', 'town', 'not', 'pleasant', 'Pun', 'not', 'intended', 'As', 'different', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'are', 'part', 'extremely', 'rare', 'breed', 'How', 'many', 'gothic/horror', 'soaps', 'appear', 'television', 'Not', 'many', 'Dark', 'Shadows', '60s', '90s', 'versions', 'are', 'also', 'favorites', 'mine', 'short-lived', 'CBS', 'horror', 'drama', 'American', 'Gothic', 'was', 'similar', 'style', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'so', 'like', 'shows', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'things', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'EXCELLENT', 'music', 'used', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'was', 'written', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'theme', 'song', 'done', 'nearly', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'music', 'used', 'show', 'not', 'written', 'Elfman', 'also', 'good', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'nicely', 'filmwork', 'also', 'nice', 'great', 'widescreen', 'blue', 'film', 'used', 'quite', 'bit', 'can', 'be', 'effective.Overall', 'show', 'good', 'surprise', 'many', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'were', 'displeased', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'However', 'are', 'dark', 'religious', 'themed', 'shows', 'movies', 'just', 'creepy', 'supernatural', 'adventures', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buy', 'rent']",Point Pleasant - The Complete Series

Like (most of) the other reviewers I was extremely unhappy when FOX yanked this off the air 5 episodes short of the finale, especially as they had spent a fair amount of time introducing us (the viewers) to the wonderfully twisted characters of Point Pleasant.  I thought the acting in the series was well above average for primetime dramas, particularly the leads who are very convincing in (let's face it) roles that could have been very cartoonish in the hands of lesser actors.  The production values of the show were also very good.Now thankfully we have the DVDs so we can see how the season ends and the show doesn't disappoint.  The ending stays away from predictability, and the final few episodes in particular are much darker in tone than what came before.  The last few episodes do seem a bit rushed compared so I have to wonder if the producers rushed them because they knew the series was ending.  I would love a Season Two but I don't think that will happen.  However the show ends in a way that most of the major mysteries are answered so while it is a cliffhanger, it is quite satisfying.  I hope to see the talent on this show in other TV shows/movies in the future.

924548,A2Q4CZVCN5APDL,B000A9QKT6,Rick,"[9, 9]","Following on the heels of Firefly and Wonderfalls, Point Pleasant joins the ranks of great shows cancelled by Fox before it had a chance to find its audience.  The story centers around Christina Nickson(Elisabeth Harnois), a girl who falls off a boat, is rescued and then taken in by the Kramer family in the town of Point Pleasant.  But Christina's father isn't her real father, her real father is is in fact Satan himself while her mother is a human who she has never met.  I starting watching this show because Dina Meyer was in it. I'm a fan of hers, in particular of her portryal of Oracle on ""Birds of Prey""(another great show canceled too soon, this one by the WB, that's one show Fox doesn't get the blame for, and puts Dina as starring in two shows canceled prematurely).  Dina plays Amber Hargrove, a hot single mom, and the town whore.  On lesser shows that's all her character would remain, but as the series goes on she's not as one dimensional as she seems, another reason why Point Pleasant is a superior show.  Relative newcomer Elisabeth Harnois is excellent as Christina. As the series opens, she appears to be a sweet innocent girl, but with a few flashes of darkness.  With each episode her character gets a little bit darker, as the part of her that is her father fights for supremacy.  You can't help but feel sympathy for Christina, you're cheering for her good side to win out.  Elisabeth plays both sides of the coin so well.  If the right opportunities present themself, she will be a breakout star in the next few years. Also must give high marks to Grant Show, who is the main villain in the series, Satan's right hand man who is there to encourage Christina's dark side. Harnois, Show, and Meyer are the top actors on the show, but the entire cast is capable. As other reviewers have noted, the series starts out much like a supernatural version of the O.C., but with each episode, it becomes more supernatural drama and less teen soap opera.  Series cocreator Marti Noxon said the show found it's identity about halfway through, then Fox canceled it after episode 8 just when it was hitting its stride.  What's even more unbelievable is they replaced it's timeslot with leftover episodes of Tru Calling, a vastly inferior show that Fox had already decided to cancel.  After buying the DVD, I watched all 13 episodes in four days.  It gets better with each episode as it builds momentum.  If you watched the eight episodes on TV, it is definitely worth buying the DVD to watch the last five.  If you watched Point Pleasant and gave up on it before the eight episodes aired, get the DVD and pick up where you left, you won't regret it.  And if you never watched Point Pleasant and are looking for a good supernatural drama, get it.  Be warned, the series does not end with resolution, all the more reason there is more story to be told.  A Point Pleasant TV movie or miniseries would be great.  If that's ever to happen, the DVD sales will be a major factor.  So all Point Pleasant fans should spread the word.  Buy it as a gift, if you don't have it yourself yet, put it on your Christmas list. Point Pleasant should go on.",5,Fox pulls the plug on yet another great show.,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,3152,"['Following', 'heels', 'Firefly', 'Wonderfalls', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'ranks', 'great', 'shows', 'cancelled', 'Fox', 'had', 'chance', 'find', 'audience', 'story', 'centers', 'Christina', 'Nickson', 'Elisabeth', 'Harnois', 'girl', 'who', 'boat', 'rescued', 'then', 'taken', 'Kramer', 'family', 'town', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'Christina', 'father', ""n't"", 'real', 'father', 'real', 'father', 'fact', 'Satan', 'mother', 'human', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'starting', 'watching', 'show', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'was', ""'m"", 'fan', 'hers', 'particular', 'portryal', 'Oracle', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'great', 'show', 'canceled', 'too', 'soon', 'one', 'WB', 'one', 'show', 'Fox', ""n't"", 'get', 'blame', 'Dina', 'starring', 'two', 'shows', 'canceled', 'prematurely', 'Dina', 'Amber', 'Hargrove', 'hot', 'single', 'mom', 'town', 'whore', 'lesser', 'shows', 'character', 'would', 'remain', 'series', 'not', 'one', 'dimensional', 'reason', 'why', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'superior', 'show', 'Relative', 'newcomer', 'Elisabeth', 'Harnois', 'excellent', 'Christina', 'series', 'be', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'girl', 'few', 'flashes', 'darkness', 'episode', 'character', 'little', 'bit', 'darker', 'part', 'father', 'fights', 'supremacy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Christina', ""'re"", 'cheering', 'good', 'side', 'win', 'out', 'Elisabeth', 'sides', 'coin', 'so', 'well', 'right', 'opportunities', 'present', 'themself', 'will', 'be', 'breakout', 'star', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'Also', 'must', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'Grant', 'Show', 'who', 'main', 'villain', 'series', 'Satan', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'who', 'there', 'encourage', 'Christina', 'dark', 'side', 'Harnois', 'Show', 'Meyer', 'are', 'top', 'actors', 'show', 'entire', 'cast', 'capable', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'series', 'out', 'much', 'supernatural', 'version', 'O.C.', 'episode', 'more', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'less', 'teen', 'soap', 'opera', 'Series', 'cocreator', 'Marti', 'Noxon', 'said', 'show', 'found', 'identity', 'halfway', 'then', 'Fox', 'canceled', '8', 'just', 'when', 'was', 'hitting', 'stride', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'replaced', 'timeslot', 'leftover', 'episodes', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'vastly', 'inferior', 'show', 'Fox', 'had', 'already', 'decided', 'cancel', 'buying', 'DVD', 'watched', '13', 'episodes', 'four', 'days', 'better', 'episode', 'momentum', 'watched', 'eight', 'episodes', 'TV', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'watch', 'last', 'five', 'watched', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'gave', 'up', 'eight', 'episodes', 'aired', 'get', 'DVD', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'never', 'watched', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'get', 'Be', 'warned', 'series', 'not', 'end', 'resolution', 'more', 'reason', 'more', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'TV', 'movie', 'miniseries', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'ever', 'happen', 'DVD', 'sales', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'factor', 'So', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'fans', 'should', 'spread', 'word', 'Buy', 'gift', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'yet', 'put', 'Christmas', 'list', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'should', 'go']",Point Pleasant - The Complete Series

924555,AQFGSOIZXWRS7,B000A9QKT6,Your Role Model,"[2, 3]","Just finished watching the full season on DVD, and I have mixed feelings on it. But I respect that it was at least TRYING to be something cool, and I also have to wonder at FOX's judgement in cancelling it after a mere 8 episodes (in much the same way they gunned down 'Wonderfalls' and 'Firefly' before their times): HELLO guys?! *raps on a Fox exec's forehead*. Anyone in there?Seriously, its nice that Fox is willing to give edgy, original fare (half) a chance, but they are only understanding half the equation. Offbeat shows like these need TIME TO BUILD AN AUDIENCE. Duh. Can you imagine if 'Seinfeld' had gotten its start on Fox? That thing would've been cancelled in half a season, and replaced by the generic awful reality show of the month. Wooo.Fox's addled decision-making aside, the show IS a bit of a mixed bag. As the Amazon review rightly points out, the PREMISE of the show is great- the daughter of the Devil himself comes to a small town and things slowly go to hell. Awesome.But the problem is that the show is slanted a little too heavily towards teenage (and even middle-aged) angst, and a great many of the actors aren't really up to even that task. Marti Noxon, executive producer and creator of the show, is an alum of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel', where she learned that even horror- and action-based shows need to play off the personal and emotional for the goings on to have any real impact or resonance. Too true.But, unfortunately for this goal, and unlike the stellar (before it got decimated by departures) 'Buffy' cast, the 'Point Pleasant' cast is extremely uneven.On the one hand, we have talented actors and actresses like Dina Meyer (Amber), Aubrey Dollar (Judy- who's very fresh and real in the role), and Grant Show (Lucas Boyd) plugging away with quality portrayals that bring you in and make you care about these characters and the scenes they're in. Meyer's no surprise, she's been good in nearly everything, but Show is a revelation-- he used to be a 'Melrose Place' ham? Wow, what a difference, and so much for the better, as he makes Boyd not only cooly malevolent but a rounded individual, and much more than a 'generic evil guy'.Heck, even Cameron Richardson (Paula), previously known mainly for taking her top off in bad movies, is perfectly trashy as a stuck up, shallow-but-yearning-for-love small town princess. Not sure she's really a good actress, but she's good for this role.Unfortunately, the few good performances are offset by a great many wooden pretty boys/gals who just don't understand how to play their roles. And some of the pretty boys/gals are even middle-aged, as everyone in this town seems to look great.For example, we have Alex Carter playing Logan Parker, the town cop, as a quietly angry man who appears to have graduated from the Steven Seagal School of 'only one facial expression' acting. Clare Carey, plays his wife Sarah as a slightly spaced-out religious fanatic, who is just as tedious as those slightly spaced-out Hare Krishnas you meet at the airport. Oh, and she berates her husband for still being mad about her cheating on him. Very religious, in a Jimmy Swaggart sort of way.Both are exemplary, though, compared with the hapless Brent Webber, portraying Terry. I think I've seen scrimshaw sculptures that communicated more raw emotional intensity. He has no range whatsoever. The kid was selected purely on his Abercrombie & Fitch looks, and it really shows. Most scenes he's in seem to go thud, the only exception being those between him and Paula.There's also a good-looking, and, of course, extremely young Latino priest (Marcus Coloma) who doesn't do much except look hot, develop an inappropriate crush on Christina (the devil's daughter), and get killed halfway through the season.  I half expected to see him surfing in tight Speedos while wearing his rosary beads.We also have Richard Burgi (he of 'Desperate Housewives' fame) and Susan Walters trying gamely as the Kramers, but they either don't seem to understand their roles completely, or are hamstrung by some pretty mediocre writing and dialogue, maybe both. You can slot them in as acceptable, but you don't end up caring much about either character, even though you really should (especially in the case of Meg, given her horrific backstory).Then we get to Jesse (Sam Page) who's 18 but is being played by a nearly 30-year old actor (which is true of a lot of other roles here). Whatever, it's the Hollywood way, aka the 'Luke Perry' effect.The problem is, whatever the actor's age, he's simply not that good at giving Jesse any kind of convincing emotional depth or range... he's just kind of the classic 'hero on a pedestal', the ideal boy that Paula and Christina are fighting over in the first few episodes.While Page is good at portraying THAT guy (the aww shucks emotionally-distant crush figure), he's a lot less self-assured later in the season when the show zeroes in on his and Christina's relationship, and he's presented with some very hard choices as the s*** hits the fan.Some of the problem is the trying-too-hard-to-keep-us-guessing writing, which intentionally keeps us away from much of Jesse's thought processes, but a lot of is Page himself, who really needs to dredge up some adult-sized and very real agonizing and intensity, and largely fails.Which brings us to Christina, the Angel of Darkness herself, played by Elisabeth Harnois. THIS is the pivotal role, the make-or-break for the series. And, unfortunately, she is not quite up to it.I can completely understand WHY Marti Noxon et al cast Harnois... she definitely has the exact right LOOK for the role, a sort of ethereal beauty that seems innocent and a bit alien at the same time. You could see how someone who looks like that could be the Devil's daughter. Unfortunately, you can't see how someone who acts like Harnois does could be that.The role requires a certain 'wise beyond her years' sadness and heart-wrenching vulnerability, and while Harnois tries, you just don't quite buy it. She doesn't seem like an old soul in a young body or an outsider, but rather, too much like the girl next door and not terribly different from any of the other cute teenage girls (though Harnois is around 25) running around on the beach.This becomes more and more noticeable as the show goes on and the intensity is ratcheted up. In the final couple of episodes, where Christina is well and truly losing her battle with her own inner darkness, Harnois' take on it is more 'teenage temper-tantrum' than 'Carrie'.  One character describes Christina is more ""fluffy looking"" than you'd expect ultimate evil to be, and, sadly, she's right- Harnois couldn't scare her way out of a paper bag. The rage and betrayal and anguish should be there, and terrifying, and it just isn't.The uneven acting aside, the show is a bit better than the Amazon review notes, and doesn't quite deserve the gently mocking tone of same.The pace isn't really 'slow', as the Amazon review purports. I'd say the foreshadowing and build-up of the early episodes is actually a good deal of the fun, in the same way that much of the interest of 'Twin Peaks' was in seeing a small town slowly give up its secrets. That, and you have to flesh out the characters, so you actually care about what happens to them.Additionally, the photography is GORGEOUS, the natural beauty of the place is stunningly highlighted in big sweeping pans of the shoreline, town, etc.  Almost makes you want to go on vacation there, and it nicely contrasts with the dire events going on.That said, the show just isn't near scary enough, except for some parts of the final couple of episodes. More of the characters should've been in peril (and from someone other than Christina) from fairly early on, and even in the rare spots when they were, it wasn't done right.For example, Father Tomas is simply killed off at the end of one episode, seemingly on Boyd's whim. There should've been more dread, more build-up, more fear... Father Tomas should've FELT stalked by evil, should've feared for his life... instead of, 'bang I'm dead'.Also, you really can't characterize the writing and dialogue of 'Point Pleasant' as any more than adequate- I can think of only one or two memorable or clever lines, and few plot twists that I didn't see coming. If you think a guy's gonna get konked on the head, yep, he pretty much is, and if you think that someone's going out a window and falling to their death, yep, they sure are, about 30 seconds after you saw it coming. This is in contrast to the pilot, which I thought was pretty well-done.Another problem is that of no payoff in some major subplots. For example, throughout most of the season, its a very big deal that Christina is looking for her mom, who she hopes will be her link to the good side of her nature. But when she finally finds her mom, its totally disappointing... she's literally walking along, and a woman sitting on a bench just basically says, ""Hi, I'm your Mom.""Nor is there any real buildup to her betrayal of Christina. The whole encounter and character ends up feeling very much out of left field, and you don't care near as much as you should. There should've been more clues, there should've been more of a mystery to unravel, there should've been more EFFORT for Christina to get to her mother. Not a dead end (a suicidal doctor) and then a deus ex machina.But, the BIG, central problem with 'Point Pleasant' isn't stuff like that, even as damaging as it is. Again, it's the 'looks over acting ability' casting... seems like EVERYTHING'S a teen melodrama these days, even a series about the (potential) AntiChrist. You 'gots to have' your army of pretty 26 year old cast members pretending to be teenagers these days. Maybe they should've retitled this show 'Abercrombie & Uberb****'.Ok, so maybe Fox wasn't *completely* wrong in cancelling this one, for once, though it should be pointed out that there is much less ambitious, much lower quality TV fare out there doing well. You can kind of fall in love with 'Point Pleasant' for what its TRYING to be. Even flawed, it's still a great guilty pleasure, and with some revamping, could've had a pretty strong second season. We'll never know, because Fox has the attention span of a gnat. You could probably put together a pretty great network with all the good shows they've cancelled.Though you'd think a two-hour 'Point Pleasant' TV movie wrapping it all up would still have some ratings appeal. Hmm... nah. We couldn't get this cast together again... they'd all be out tanning or getting their hair done.Ah well. Here's hoping someone can get a good gothic horror series off the ground sometime soon. I really miss the good ol' 'Buffy Seasons 2 and 3' glory days, and I'm far from alone. Whoever gets it right will do well.Sidenote- Reading some of the other reviews, people REALLY need to ease off some of the comparisons to other shows being made. 'Buffy' is fair game, since 'Point Pleasant' creator Marti Noxon was executive producer on both shows, but... 'Charmed'? 'Dawson's Creek'? The 'O.C.'? Get real. Just because a show has the supernatural or teenagers in it, does not automatically make it like all other shows that have the supernatural or teenagers in them.By that logic, 'Lost' and 'Magnum P.I' are the same show, because they both take place on a Pacific island. Sigh.Sidenote 2: This is the 66th Amazon review of this show.
