It's HILARIOUS, and it has a lot of drama too (well, not a whole lot).  Second, I know you can watch them on TV, but on TV they cut out a lot to fit in commercials, and you can see all that here.  Also, you can watch them all in order on DVD, where as on TV it isn't in order from the beginning.  get it.

I know I'm in the minority when I say this but,I'm glad it's over! But is it really over? No! I'm pretty sure they signed a contract to run this thing until the year 3000(on every channel.) To be fair,I honestly tried to like this show when it first came on. I actually watched a few shows but I didn't care about Ross and Rachael. I just found it mind numbingly boring. I tried to find the humor when NBC renamed Wednesday &quot;Friendsday&quot; I just couldn't. I did find it interesting how much time was spent covering the series finale. When it went off I expected to hear thunder claps and trumpets blaring signaling the end or something. But it was just the end of a series and not even a good one. Oh well,all I can say is I'm glad these &quot;Friends&quot;went home.",1,Friends that stayed too long.,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,860,"['Did', 'ever', 'have', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'came', 'over', 'stayed', 'too', 'long', 'did', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'when', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'really', 'No', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'signed', 'contract', 'run', 'thing', 'year', '3000', 'channel', 'be', 'fair', 'honestly', 'tried', 'like', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'actually', 'watched', 'few', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Ross', 'Rachael', 'just', 'found', 'numbingly', 'boring', 'tried', 'find', 'humor', 'when', 'NBC', 'renamed', 'Wednesday', 'quot', 'Friendsday', 'quot', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'did', 'find', 'interesting', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'covering', 'series', 'finale', 'When', 'went', 'off', 'expected', 'hear', 'thunder', 'claps', 'trumpets', 'blaring', 'signaling', 'end', 'something', 'was', 'just', 'end', 'series', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'Oh', 'well', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'went', 'home']",Friends: The Complete First Seven Seasons
810365,AMI0C2C9QS8U3,B0001M3MXO,j.,"[1, 4]","""Friends"" was billed late in its career as the greatest television comedy series of all time.  This is highly debatable.  Nonetheless, it certainly holds its place in pop culture, speaking to thousands of the 20-something (and eventually 30-something) generation Xers who found themselves unsure about what life had to offer after college in the early 1990s.  For those who have lived in a cave for the past decade, ""Friends"" is about three men and three women who live/date/work/play in New York City. The show's foundation is the uniqueness of its characters -- a nerdy scientist, a struggling actor, and an internet geek (the three men) -- and a waitress/chef, hippie, and unemployed-daddy's-little-girl (for the women).  Sure, the characters seem a little cliche, but ""Friends"" had one of the best writing teams on television, so they made the situation seem somehow fresh.  The quality of the show did decrease over time, as ""Friends"" stayed on the air for about three or four seasons more than it should have.  The story lines slowly became stretched, forced, more unbelievable, and even downright corny.  But still, at least the first six seasons are near perfect, and even the rest of them are enjoyable for any generation.",5,"sure to be a classic...in fact, already kinda is",1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,1231,"['Friends', 'was', 'billed', 'late', 'career', 'greatest', 'television', 'comedy', 'series', 'time', 'highly', 'debatable', 'Nonetheless', 'certainly', 'place', 'pop', 'culture', 'speaking', 'thousands', '20-something', 'eventually', '30-something', 'generation', 'Xers', 'who', 'found', 'unsure', 'what', 'life', 'had', 'offer', 'college', 'early', '1990s', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'cave', 'past', 'decade', 'Friends', 'three', 'men', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'live/date/work/play', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'show', 'foundation', 'uniqueness', 'characters', 'nerdy', 'scientist', 'struggling', 'actor', 'internet', 'geek', 'three', 'men', 'waitress/chef', 'hippie', ""unemployed-daddy's-little-girl"", 'women', 'Sure', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'cliche', 'Friends', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'writing', 'teams', 'television', 'made', 'situation', 'seem', 'somehow', 'fresh', 'quality', 'show', 'did', 'decrease', 'time', 'Friends', 'stayed', 'air', 'three', 'four', 'seasons', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'story', 'lines', 'slowly', 'became', 'stretched', 'forced', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'downright', 'corny', 'still', 'least', 'first', 'six', 'seasons', 'are', 'perfect', 'even', 'rest', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'generation']",Friends: The Complete First Seven Seasons

All seven seasons of Friends on DVD!Chances are though, if you are a big follower of Friends, you'll have noticed that each time a new season comes out, they realease all the seasons up to that point.So, if you're planning on buying all of them no matter what, and you want to do it all at once, you could just wait until all ten seasons are available in a big collector's pack. Or just get this one now and buy the last three as they are released.Any way you decide to do it, the price evens out. And all of them have the same features. That being said, this is a great set of laughs, and a great study of television genius.
