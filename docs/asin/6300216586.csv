222058,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,6300216586,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[9, 12]","I remember seeing this in a theater in Nashville, Tennessee, with my two young sons, when it was first released -- so long ago, and yet the magnificient story and music are still the same.  Now, my twelve-yr-old cat, Star, likes to look at the birds on the t.v. screen but is perplexed by their human voices.The music was just great!  Neil Diamond was simply marvelous back then providing the music for this and the remake of THE JAZZ SINGER.  Both make me cry sometimes as they tug at the heart strings.  Killing me softly with his song!Hal Holbrook was good as the voice of the mean one, the elder who banned Jon from the flock for daring to be different, and later did the same to poor Fletcher, because of his crippled wing.  When you get past the noise of the birds feeding on garbage, the story soars just as Jonathan Livingston Seagull at a fairly fast clip, on the wings of a prayer.  The narration is perfectly done: both Jon L. and the angel Seagull who comes to take him to a better place.He returns the favor to Fletcher and teaches him that he can fly with the best of them.  The worst part was near the end of the movie when the baby bird is knocked into the rock cliff and dies.  That made me sad initially, but I can understand the significance now that I am older.  It's not easy being old, but it's much worse to die young.Jonny will always be a bird after my heart.  As a result of this movie, I feed the pigeons here in town and the few birds who returned after last year's bad treatment.  I fed the geese at one place I lived out of town here and, as a result, had to move.  We do have small flocks of seagulls near the malls and out west at that Walmart.  We are far from any sea, but the Tennessee River can furnish them with carp and other dietary fish they may need.

It's a 95 minute music video, which is about 75 minutes more than it takes to read the book. And what a video it is.Neil Diamond's beautiful and haunting score dominates the film, setting the mysterious and relaxing mood while it poignantly reveals Jonathan's thoughts, moods, and life. Sewn to the fabric of the stunning visuals, you could cry just watching a bird fly. Literally.If you've been a fan of Diamond's soundtrack but never see the film, it will captivate you and make you wonder why you never bothered to see it before.You'll need to be in the mood for an enchanting, fulfilling, and simultaneously relaxing and emotional experience to appreciate this film the way we did, and the way so many others have over its forty years.

I'll never forget seeing this in the theater around 1973. It was impressive.On the negative side is the usual New Age ""look within yourself"" theology. This is pure Secular Humanism.

222064,AGP9IA5IIG3VW,6300216586,DerWeg,"[26, 27]","Voice over - awful.Message - Brilliant.This is a film about an anthropomorphic bird, a seagull who wants to break from the flock's set ways, tiring of the endless meaningless pursuit of mere survival. He wants to learn rather than blindly conform, would risk death in order to truly be alive.This is an eternal story - the one who wants to understand becomes an outcast, and ultimately comes in contact with the real world. Is there an ethereal inner circle of humanity, guiding us all and helping the few that really need release from this circle of life and death? This story does not deny such a reality.I was surprised at the depth of this movie, despite its cloying attempts to make us sympathize with the poor bird washed up on the raft of driftwood, freezing in the snow etc. The faux-innocence of Johnathan's dopey voice over makes me want to laugh, but I appreciate the idea and the difficult technical/creative work that went into making this unlikely feature film.Interestingly 30 years ago SEAGULL ruffled some defensive feathers, challenging common notions of 'heaven' and 'faith' and our innate purpose. The 'mystical' is always a threat, reviled or ridiculed. Here in know-it-all 2005 people seem to think nothing of either faith or mysticism, content to blindly accept the illusions of their life in the Flock of humanity (note in the film the garbage dump the gulls cling to for their swill.)

The book is barely over 100 pages, and there is hardly a plot. Most of the book is given to saccharine preaching, and was more of a religious tract than a book.I supposed, then, that the movie might be better. After all, for a movie to be watchable, there must be some semblance of a plot. Alas, I find this film even worse than the book, for no other reason that the film wasted an hour and a half of my life, while the book wasted about twenty minutes.Like the book, it tells the story of Jonathan Seagull, who wants to fly better than anyone else. The movie has many, many problems. First and foremost: the plot. Or rather, the lack of plot. The first twenty minutes or so actually have a loose plot, but as soon as Jonathan is kicked out of his flock, it disappears in favour of preaching, pretty birds flying, and, perhaps worst of all, Neil Diamond.I will admit that the scenery was gorgeous, but it's hard to enjoy that as the worst music Neil Diamond has ever written blares obnoxiously in the background.  Worse than, it includes some of the worst voice-over work ever seen in a movie. They don't attempt to make the birds look as if they are speaking, instead, they play a voice in the background and hope the audience will buy it. This audience isn't buying it.This might work, if the birds had anything interesting or insightful to say, but ninety percent of the dialogue is preaching. Not only does it make for a boring movie, it's also rather insulting. No matter how free and perfect you believe yourself to be, everyone has limitations. It's part of being human.  Moreover, the preaching is about as subtle as a walrus that has painted itself bright green and is dancing on a harpsichord, singing ""The Subtle Song"".Perhaps even worse, it was painful to watch the birds be thrown around. In some cases, in the scene in which they were fighting over a garbage heap, I could swear I saw real blood. Even if this were a good film, it'd be disturbing to see these birds get hurt.This is a mind-blowingly bad movie, which has thankfully faded into obscurity.",1,Dull and Pretentious,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2160,"['limited', 'being', 'am', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'what', 'possessed', 'anyone', 'actually', 'make', 'film', 'book', 'barely', '100', 'pages', 'hardly', 'plot', 'Most', 'book', 'given', 'saccharine', 'preaching', 'was', 'more', 'religious', 'tract', 'book.I', 'supposed', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'be', 'watchable', 'must', 'be', 'semblance', 'plot', 'Alas', 'find', 'film', 'even', 'worse', 'book', 'other', 'reason', 'film', 'wasted', 'hour', 'half', 'life', 'book', 'wasted', 'twenty', 'book', 'story', 'Jonathan', 'Seagull', 'who', 'fly', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'problems', 'First', 'foremost', 'plot', 'rather', 'lack', 'plot', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'actually', 'have', 'loose', 'plot', 'as', 'soon', 'Jonathan', 'kicked', 'flock', 'favour', 'preaching', 'pretty', 'birds', 'flying', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'Neil', 'Diamond.I', 'will', 'admit', 'scenery', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'worst', 'music', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'ever', 'written', 'obnoxiously', 'background', 'Worse', 'worst', 'voice-over', 'work', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'make', 'birds', 'look', 'are', 'speaking', 'instead', 'play', 'voice', 'background', 'hope', 'audience', 'will', 'buy', 'audience', ""n't"", 'buying', 'it.This', 'might', 'work', 'birds', 'had', 'anything', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'say', 'ninety', 'percent', 'dialogue', 'preaching', 'Not', 'only', 'make', 'boring', 'movie', 'also', 'rather', 'insulting', 'matter', 'how', 'free', 'perfect', 'believe', 'be', 'everyone', 'limitations', 'part', 'being', 'human', 'Moreover', 'preaching', 'as', 'subtle', 'walrus', 'painted', 'bright', 'green', 'dancing', 'harpsichord', 'singing', 'Subtle', 'Song', '.Perhaps', 'even', 'worse', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'birds', 'be', 'thrown', 'around', 'cases', 'scene', 'were', 'fighting', 'garbage', 'heap', 'could', 'swear', 'saw', 'real', 'blood', 'Even', 'were', 'good', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'disturbing', 'see', 'birds', 'get', 'hurt.This', 'mind-blowingly', 'bad', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'faded', 'obscurity']",Jonathan Livingston Seagull VHS

I was EXTREMELY disturbed at some of the scenes and had to force myself to watch the film all the way through. I'm amazed that this film is considered a ""family film"" - I'm sure children would be disturbed at some of the scenes of bloodied and dead gulls.

Bernabo,"[5, 9]","I know that I read the book, ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" by Richard Bach and that my girl friend in high school gave me thesoundtrack album, so I remembered the handful of Neil Diamond songs that show up in this movie, but I remembered nothing about the plot.  I mean, yes, I knew there was this seagull and that there was some sort of simplistic life lesson to be learned here, but it was not until the seagull started talking about flying really fast that I remembered that was the catalyst for the title character's quest, exile, and ultimate redemption.  I also remembered that the message was not why I went to go see this movie when it came out in 1973.I still think this is a beautiful film, which deservedly received an Oscar nomination for Jack Couffer's cinematography because basically this film was IMAX before IMAX was around.  The beginning is gorgeous and it takes you a moment to remember that you want to pay attention to the seagull and not the scenery.  This proves to be the fatal flaw in this film.  Because once we start focusing on the seagulls we focus on one in particular, and he has a story that has to be communicated through voiceovers.  I recognize the voice of Philip Ahn as Chang, because I watched ""Kung Fu"" when it was on, but I never would have guessed that was James Franciscus doing the voice of Jonathan.  The problem is that every time we get to the voice-overs in this movie, I start to get bored, even though I know the dialogue is necessary to advance the plot of the film (this sentiment is extend to Dimaond's work, where I like the music way more than the lyrics).  It is just that suddenly I seem to remember a joke about the book, namely that it was a best seller because there were more people than you would have thought who had never read ""The Little Engine That Could,"" and I have to wonder about people with so little in their lives that the book could have meant so much.To be fair, the movie should not be confused with the book, if for no other reason that Bach sued Columbia over the changes they made to his story when they filmed it.  Then again, I have no idea what those changes might be or how the vision of the author has been corrupted by this adaptation.  There are no DVD extras and there are six--count them, six--scenes to select.  They are numbered (you guessed it) 1 through 6, and if you can look at the pictures above the numbers and figure out what part of the film it is, then you must really love this movie.  I was going to round up on this one, just because the cinematography is as gorgeous as I remember, but when I saw the film was divided into six numbered scenes, I had to head in the other direction.  This is one of those films that I have to think will interest only those people who saw it before and want to see it again, whether such an interest is restricted only to the beautiful photograph or to the whole ""message"" it has to offer.",3,"Beautiful pictures, decent songs, and then the seagulls start ""talking""",1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,2924,"['know', 'read', 'book', 'Jonathan', 'Livingston', 'Seagull', 'Richard', 'Bach', 'girl', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'gave', 'thesoundtrack', 'album', 'remembered', 'handful', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'songs', 'show', 'up', 'movie', 'remembered', 'nothing', 'plot', 'mean', 'yes', 'knew', 'was', 'seagull', 'was', 'sort', 'simplistic', 'life', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'seagull', 'started', 'talking', 'flying', 'really', 'fast', 'remembered', 'was', 'catalyst', 'title', 'character', 'quest', 'exile', 'ultimate', 'redemption', 'also', 'remembered', 'message', 'was', 'not', 'why', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1973.I', 'still', 'think', 'beautiful', 'film', 'deservedly', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Jack', 'Couffer', 'cinematography', 'basically', 'film', 'was', 'IMAX', 'IMAX', 'was', 'around', 'beginning', 'gorgeous', 'moment', 'remember', 'want', 'pay', 'attention', 'seagull', 'not', 'scenery', 'be', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'film', 'start', 'focusing', 'seagulls', 'focus', 'one', 'particular', 'story', 'be', 'communicated', 'voiceovers', 'recognize', 'voice', 'Philip', 'Ahn', 'Chang', 'watched', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'when', 'was', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'was', 'James', 'Franciscus', 'doing', 'voice', 'Jonathan', 'problem', 'time', 'get', 'voice-overs', 'movie', 'start', 'get', 'bored', 'even', 'know', 'dialogue', 'necessary', 'advance', 'plot', 'film', 'sentiment', 'extend', 'Dimaond', 'work', 'where', 'music', 'way', 'more', 'lyrics', 'just', 'suddenly', 'seem', 'remember', 'joke', 'book', 'namely', 'was', 'best', 'seller', 'were', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'Little', 'Engine', 'That', 'Could', 'have', 'wonder', 'people', 'so', 'little', 'lives', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'meant', 'so', 'much.To', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'book', 'other', 'reason', 'Bach', 'sued', 'Columbia', 'changes', 'made', 'story', 'when', 'filmed', 'Then', 'again', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'changes', 'might', 'be', 'how', 'vision', 'author', 'been', 'corrupted', 'adaptation', 'are', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'six', 'count', 'six', 'scenes', 'select', 'are', 'numbered', 'guessed', '1', '6', 'can', 'look', 'pictures', 'numbers', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'part', 'film', 'then', 'must', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'round', 'up', 'one', 'just', 'cinematography', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'remember', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'divided', 'six', 'numbered', 'scenes', 'had', 'head', 'other', 'direction', 'one', 'films', 'have', 'think', 'will', 'interest', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'interest', 'restricted', 'only', 'beautiful', 'photograph', 'whole', 'message', 'offer']",Jonathan Livingston Seagull VHS

While the film may not have been issued in stereo at the time, Paramount has gone back to many of its films and used the original master tapes and remastered films in beautiful stereo sound. To skip doing that for Jonathan Livingston Seagull is just an abomination.

222078,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,6300216586,V. Berk,"[1, 1]","God bless this film crew because they really do try their best. They faced a true mission impossible: make a live action adaptation of Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Could it be done in 1973? Not really, but they were going to try any way. I'm going to attempt summarizing what the film does best and let you decide whether or not you want to see this forgotten movie adaptation. The film failed to set the box office afire in 1973 but it did successfully launch a Grammy winning soundtrack by Neil Diamond and received two Oscar nominations (Editing and Cinematography).If you're interest in seeing this movie odds are you're a fan of Richard Bach's classic novel, and are solely seeking this film out as a curiosity piece, but for those of you haven't read it I'll summarize the plot.  Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a seagull who lives for flight.  He separates himself from his flock who refuse to accept his obsession with becoming the fastest seagull who ever lived.  In his desire for self-perfection Jonathan reaches a higher state of spiritual being before ultimately returning to impart his wisdom on other members of his flock.Where this film adaptation really soars is its cinematography.  The visuals are some of the best imaginable for the time the film was made. Even if we get a modern film that uses today's technology to more accurately translate Richard Bach's novel this film does set a standard for cinematography.Let me outline one of the film's early scenes: In the distance a speck. The aerial shot begins to descend and soon the dot is revealed as a fishing boat and around it circles a flock of seagulls. Cut to the boat's dock. The seagulls hang over head as the crew men begin releasing fish into the water. Close-ups and tracking shots follow the gulls as they descend into the water and begin fighting over the food. At the end of the scene the boat and gulls are seen as silhouettes in the sunset. This is immediately followed by a series of sweeping aerial footage of a gull flying high above the clouds. We follow this one gull over multiple landscapes to the sound of Neil Diamond's Be. It is simply breathtaking! Sequences like this are magnificently composed and executed and justify the film's Academy nominations for cinematography and editing. Watching moments like this make you yearn for a digitally remastered, hi-definition release.The live action seagull footage --for the most part-- really works for Part 1 of the story. Where it becomes shaky is when dialogue scenes between Jonathan and the other seagulls occur, but that doesn't take away from the moments in Part 1 where the film gets it right.  When Jonathan is giving up his dreams after a crash the footage of hurt seagull emerging from the water, beaten and battered, struggling to climb aboard a portion of driftwood it's hard not to get emotional. It's probably because we the audience hate seeing a hurt animal, but for the purpose of the film moments like this do capture the spirit of the book.  Niel Diamond's soundtrack is optimistic and does capture the right tone for Richard Bach's novel.  When the movie plays as a seagull centered music video the movie does extraordinarily well.When Jonathan is shown with voice over narration there is something, and for those moments I can suspend my disbelief and believe that this is Jonathan Livingston Seagull but then another dialogue scene will come to ruin it because at the end of the day dialogue between the characters is essential to Richard Bach's tale. Perhaps the filmmakers could have been REALLY ambitious and attempted to tell the story without any dialogue at all, but the animal footage would have to be nothing less than perfect for that to have worked.Where the live action seagull footage begins to fall apart is Part 2, after Jonathan has ascended into a higher state of being.  This is where live action nature footage just can't begin to capture the spirit of the book.  They try, but Parts 2 and 3 call for something supernatural which cannot be captured in real-life animal footage.  The cinematography remains gorgeous as a nature documentary, but cannot begin to capture the spiritual bliss of the novel.  It is at this point that the film falters and ultimately fails but it is not for a lack of trying.Jonathan Livingston Seagull may not reach the heights of the novel, but one has to give credit to the filmmakers because like the titular gull they never gave up.  They did their best with what they had available and I don't believe they have anything to be ashamed of.  I would love to see another crack taken at Jonathan Livingston Seagull using today's digital animation, for that will likely be the only way of truly capturing the essence of Bach novel, but I do tip my hat to the determination of these filmmakers who set out to do the impossible.I am thankful that the Warner Archive Collection has added Jonathan Livingston Seagull to their offerings so that others like myself are granted easy access to this film adaptation of the book we love. It has its flaws, and doesn't reach the same heights, but it is commendable and worth seeing for fans.  Maybe one day we'll get a digitally remastered release.  If for nothing else the cinematography deserves to be seen in hi-definition.",4,One cannot blame them for trying,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,5289,"['God', 'bless', 'film', 'crew', 'really', 'do',
