201948,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300182541,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","A film that could have easily been ridiculous, `Resurrection' balances out its themes rather well in order to create something that is not only memorable, but at times even magical.  `Resurrection' has a lot on its plate, but it manages to (for the most part) create something solid and fathomable despite its preposterous foundation.  It's quite a feat when you think about it.Ellen Burstyn stars as Edna McCauley, a middle-aged woman at odds with her family.  In the opening scenes she is in a horrible accident that leaves her widowed and paralyzed.  Reliant on those who disowned her, Edna now moves back home.  She is welcomed by her grandmother, but there are obvious tensions between her and her father.  Edna soon realizes that her unfortunate circumstances have led way to some extraordinary gifts as she begins to heal others.  This causes uproar through her small town, contrasting bible preachers against new believers as Edna holds healing ceremonies.  As she forms relationships with other, especially with beau Cal Carpenter, her views on her own powers become a stumbling block to some and a roadblock to herself.Thanks to some smart scripting and some even smarter performances `Resurrection' is able to break away from the ridiculousness it could have fallen into and delivers a tightly constructed character study of faith and responsibility.Ellen Burstyn is marvelous as Edna Mae McCauley, mastering this woman's own demons in order to create someone true and pure.  There is one scene in particular, when Edna is sitting in bed trying to move her toes, which in my opinion is a true testament to the flawless acting involved here.  The scene could have easily rode the fence of silly but instead it comes across very real and touching; and this is all due to Burstyn's reaction to the situation.  Sam Shepard and Roberts Blossom have heavy roles as the two men in her life, her boyfriend and her father; both of which influence her drastically, and they both handle the roles very well.  It's Eva Le Gallienne though that deserves the heaping of praise as far as supporting performances go.  Her portrayal of Grandma Pearl is effecting to an extreme, especially her scene on the porch after Edna uses her powers for the first time.Chills.This is a small film that packs quite a punch so be prepared.  It is not a film that everyone will love, but it is a film that you won't forget.  It's hard to come by so many may not get the chance to see it; but if you do please take the time to give it a watch through.  It's smart and cohesive and very much deserving of some time and attention.I want to leave you with a small note in regards to the subject matter of this film.  If you are a very religious person who has a hard time separating your own faith from entertainment then you may want to avoid this film.  `Resurrection' is a study of what constitutes faith and what separates the religious from the spiritual.  I personally am a very religious person, but I also know how to separate the two, and so I can find enjoyment and even enlightenment from a film like this that challenges ones beliefs.  I just want you to be aware that the film has its own views that may or may not conflict with your own, so if you are offended or put off by films of that nature then stay away.",4,Much more effecting than I would have imagined...,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,3301,"['film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'ridiculous', 'Resurrection', 'balances', 'out', 'themes', 'rather', 'well', 'order', 'create', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'memorable', 'times', 'even', 'magical', 'Resurrection', 'lot', 'plate', 'most', 'part', 'create', 'something', 'solid', 'fathomable', 'preposterous', 'foundation', 'quite', 'feat', 'when', 'think', 'it.Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'stars', 'Edna', 'McCauley', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'odds', 'family', 'opening', 'scenes', 'horrible', 'accident', 'widowed', 'paralyzed', 'Reliant', 'who', 'disowned', 'Edna', 'now', 'back', 'home', 'welcomed', 'grandmother', 'are', 'obvious', 'tensions', 'father', 'Edna', 'soon', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'have', 'led', 'way', 'extraordinary', 'gifts', 'heal', 'others', 'uproar', 'small', 'town', 'contrasting', 'bible', 'preachers', 'new', 'believers', 'Edna', 'healing', 'ceremonies', 'relationships', 'other', 'especially', 'beau', 'Cal', 'Carpenter', 'views', 'own', 'powers', 'become', 'stumbling', 'block', 'roadblock', 'herself.Thanks', 'smart', 'scripting', 'even', 'smarter', 'performances', 'Resurrection', 'able', 'break', 'away', 'ridiculousness', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'tightly', 'constructed', 'character', 'study', 'faith', 'responsibility.Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'marvelous', 'Edna', 'Mae', 'McCauley', 'mastering', 'woman', 'own', 'demons', 'order', 'create', 'someone', 'true', 'pure', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'when', 'Edna', 'sitting', 'bed', 'trying', 'move', 'toes', 'opinion', 'true', 'testament', 'flawless', 'acting', 'involved', 'here', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'rode', 'fence', 'silly', 'instead', 'very', 'real', 'touching', 'due', 'Burstyn', 'reaction', 'situation', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Roberts', 'Blossom', 'have', 'heavy', 'roles', 'two', 'men', 'life', 'boyfriend', 'father', 'influence', 'drastically', 'handle', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'Eva', 'Le', 'Gallienne', 'heaping', 'praise', 'as', 'far', 'supporting', 'performances', 'go', 'portrayal', 'Grandma', 'Pearl', 'effecting', 'extreme', 'especially', 'scene', 'porch', 'Edna', 'powers', 'first', 'time.Chills.This', 'small', 'film', 'quite', 'punch', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'hard', 'come', 'so', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'do', 'please', 'take', 'time', 'give', 'watch', 'smart', 'cohesive', 'very', 'much', 'deserving', 'time', 'attention.I', 'want', 'leave', 'small', 'note', 'regards', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'religious', 'person', 'who', 'hard', 'time', 'separating', 'own', 'faith', 'entertainment', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'film', 'Resurrection', 'study', 'what', 'faith', 'religious', 'spiritual', 'personally', 'am', 'very', 'religious', 'person', 'also', 'know', 'how', 'separate', 'two', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'even', 'enlightenment', 'film', 'ones', 'beliefs', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'own', 'views', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'conflict', 'own', 'so', 'are', 'offended', 'put', 'off', 'films', 'nature', 'then', 'stay', 'away']",N/A

201952,A2582KMXLK2P06,6300182541,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Well, in THIS case, it's more than just a small town.  Resurrection is a brilliantly moving film about a woman who makes a miraculous recovery after nearly dying in a car accident.While recovering however, she moves to Kansas to be closer to her family (and on an unrelated note- I LOVE movies that take place in the flatlands of Kansas!) and quickly she discovers she has this amazing ability to heal people who are terminally sick.Her father absolutely DESPISES her.  I knew something was wrong here when the father was visiting her in the hospital and barely acknowledged what had just happened to his daughter as a result of the car accident, and didn't feel thankful or happy she was still alive.  It was strange, and you know, I don't think we ever truly found out what had turned him into such a bitter old man.  Well I mean, I guess we found out, but not through *his* words.Later on in the film, she eventually falls in love with a man who insists on being her boyfriend, and THIS guy was one strange bird, haha.  He does everything in his power to be closer to her, but she continues to push him away time and time again (she must have noticed how WEIRD he is just like most of the people watching the film must have noticed the same thing, haha) but eventually they end up together... apparently against her will.Anyway, the movie does a terrific job showing the actual healing process- the woman would touch the people who are in desperate need of immediate help, and in a matter of only 30 seconds, they would be completely healed.  Sometimes the story touches upon her amazing ability and seems like it's leaning towards a supernatural thriller storyline involving magical powers, but luckily the film never drifts in that direction.  Instead, it just dabbles in it occasionally.This is seriously one extremely moving storyline.  I like how the writers kept things incredibly simple- most of the storyline takes place between only one or two places, and yet, you NEVER get tired of those places.  In fact, you wouldn't want the story to branch out any further in the fear it might interrupt the beauty of keeping things simple.  I highly recommend this film to absolutely everyone.",5,something about small town movies always win me over,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2195,"['Well', 'THIS', 'case', 'more', 'just', 'small', 'town', 'Resurrection', 'brilliantly', 'moving', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'nearly', 'dying', 'car', 'accident.While', 'recovering', 'however', 'Kansas', 'be', 'closer', 'family', 'unrelated', 'note-', 'LOVE', 'movies', 'take', 'place', 'flatlands', 'Kansas', 'quickly', 'amazing', 'ability', 'heal', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'terminally', 'sick.Her', 'father', 'absolutely', 'DESPISES', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'here', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'visiting', 'hospital', 'barely', 'acknowledged', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'daughter', 'result', 'car', 'accident', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'thankful', 'happy', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'was', 'strange', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'truly', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'turned', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'Well', 'mean', 'guess', 'found', 'out', 'not', '*his*', 'words.Later', 'film', 'eventually', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'boyfriend', 'THIS', 'guy', 'was', 'one', 'strange', 'bird', 'haha', 'everything', 'power', 'be', 'closer', 'push', 'away', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'must', 'have', 'noticed', 'how', 'WEIRD', 'just', 'most', 'people', 'watching', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'noticed', 'same', 'thing', 'haha', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'apparently', 'will.Anyway', 'movie', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'actual', 'healing', 'process-', 'woman', 'would', 'touch', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'need', 'immediate', 'help', 'matter', 'only', '30', 'seconds', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'healed', 'Sometimes', 'story', 'amazing', 'ability', 'leaning', 'towards', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'storyline', 'involving', 'magical', 'powers', 'luckily', 'film', 'never', 'drifts', 'direction', 'Instead', 'just', 'seriously', 'one', 'extremely', 'moving', 'storyline', 'how', 'writers', 'kept', 'things', 'incredibly', 'simple-', 'most', 'storyline', 'place', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'places', 'yet', 'NEVER', 'get', 'tired', 'places', 'fact', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'story', 'branch', 'out', 'further', 'fear', 'might', 'interrupt', 'beauty', 'keeping', 'things', 'simple', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'absolutely', 'everyone']",N/A

The why is asked, but Burstyn's portrayl of a not-so-perfect human who is given an extraordinary gift makes the why irrelevant. The genius, though, is that the gift - to be healed - can be given only to those who ""accept"" it (some people need their sickness, Edna explains, after one unsuccessful tent ""healing""). ""Ressurection"" is clearly a Burstyn-driven vehicle, but she's nearly upstaged by French actress Eva LeGallienne as Edna's grandmother. Both women were justly Oscar-nominated, and both are stunning.

Now I do NOT want to come across like a ""Holy Roller"" or representative of ANY church in christiandom but I DO believe that the Bible is the Word of God.  All things such as this film or even the many many doctrines of men that are supposedly Biblical are ALL the works of man's imagination designed (even if unwittingly) to entice folks into spiritually bowing down and worshiping them (though they need not physically do so) It is to lay in wait for the hurt of all those that will succumb!  Flee all such!I dare say to spiritually flee anything other than what you might KNOW in your heart is taught of God and NOT man...never ever of man!  All that is in our hearts by nature is only evil continually! We can ONLY hope for God's mercy...PERIOD!  Reject all the movies like this as an influence, reject the doctrines of the church (any of em!) Beg God for mercy and truth and look ONLY to the Scriptures! But if you hate this message then go your own way and trust whatever you choose, just remember always this warning for life is so very short.  Now I can hear some begin to be enraged by the above text thinking ""how cab you KNOW this?  You sound arrogant!""  To which I implore all DO NOT trust me for a second!  All men are liars!  By remember I said to beg GOD for mercy and understanding!...NOT me! Scripture warns us ""Let God be true and every man a liar"" and also ""Trust in Jeshovah with all thine heart and lean not on thine own understanding!""",1,Hope oozing from the imagination of man,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,1818,"['not', 'so', 'funny', 'thing', 'sense', 'other', 'comments', 'folks', 'will', 'hate', 'anyone', 'critical', 'film', 'gospel', 'kind', 'as', 'enticing', 'imagination', 'should', 'remember', 'only', 'fiction', 'just', 'movie', 'ET', 'Phenomenon', 'John', 'Travolta', 'George', 'Mally', 'are', 'child', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Now', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', 'come', 'Holy', 'Roller', 'representative', 'ANY', 'church', 'christiandom', 'DO', 'believe', 'Bible', 'Word', 'God', 'things', 'such', 'film', 'even', 'many', 'many', 'doctrines', 'men', 'are', 'supposedly', 'Biblical', 'are', 'works', 'man', 'imagination', 'designed', 'even', 'unwittingly', 'entice', 'folks', 'spiritually', 'bowing', 'down', 'worshiping', 'need', 'not', 'physically', 'do', 'so', 'lay', 'wait', 'hurt', 'will', 'succumb', 'Flee', 'such', 'dare', 'say', 'spiritually', 'flee', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'might', 'KNOW', 'heart', 'taught', 'God', 'NOT', 'man', 'never', 'ever', 'man', 'hearts', 'nature', 'only', 'evil', 'continually', 'can', 'ONLY', 'hope', 'God', 'mercy', 'PERIOD', 'Reject', 'movies', 'like', 'influence', 'reject', 'doctrines', 'church', 'em', 'Beg', 'God', 'mercy', 'truth', 'look', 'ONLY', 'Scriptures', 'hate', 'message', 'then', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'trust', 'choose', 'just', 'remember', 'always', 'warning', 'life', 'so', 'very', 'short', 'Now', 'can', 'hear', 'begin', 'be', 'enraged', 'above', 'text', 'thinking', 'how', 'cab', 'KNOW', 'sound', 'arrogant', 'implore', 'DO', 'NOT', 'trust', 'second', 'men', 'are', 'liars', 'remember', 'said', 'beg', 'GOD', 'mercy', 'understanding', 'NOT', 'Scripture', 'Let', 'God', 'be', 'true', 'man', 'liar', 'also', 'Trust', 'Jeshovah', 'thine', 'heart', 'lean', 'not', 'thine', 'own', 'understanding']",N/A

201974,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300182541,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[37, 38]","Ellen Burstyn is surely the most under-appreciated American actress of the last quarter of the past century.  Her work in her Oscar nominated films-""The Exorcist,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and ""Resurrection""-is certainly superior to that of Sally Field who ended up with twice as many Academy Awards.  Resurrection is the least well known of this particular trio, but it is arguably her most compelling performance.Burstyn plays Edna McCauley, who experiences clinical death after the car accident that kills her lover and who returns to life with amazing healing powers.  Edna begins using these new powers, but insists on attributing them to the power of human love rather than to divine intervention.  Edna saves the life of Cal Carpenter (Sam Shepard), a young farmer, and then falls in love with him.  However, he wants her to confess that her powers come from God, and when Edna is unable to do this it sets up a tragic confrontation.  The film ends with a touching scene that is as moving and as memorable as I have ever seen, giving ""Resurrection"" a final eloquence that underscores the entire experience.The supporting cast is outstanding, especially Roberts Blossom as Edna's stubborn father, Eva Le Gallienne as Grandma Pearl, and Robert Farnsworth as Esco in a wonderful bit part that takes on added importance as the story continues.  Shepard is solid, but it is Burstyn's performance that shines throughout ""Resurrection.""  This 1980 film was directed by Daniel Petrie from a script by Lewis John Carino.""Resurrection"" was remade as a 1999 television movie starring Dana Delany, which is what inspired me to go back and look at the original version again.  This time the lead character is named Clare Miller, and there are some interesting reconstructions of the elements of the original film.  The ending of this film, where the main character makes a decidedly different decision regarding how she will spend the rest of her life, is an interesting but totally valid change.  I think it just speaks to the inherent appeal of the basic storyline.Note:  Please be careful.  There are about 2 dozen different movies entitled ""Resurrection"" dating back to the silent era.

There is little in the way of violence (in fact the opening part of the movie is one of the most violent, and it features a car crash).  Instead, it confronts the question, what would happen if you were given a gift from God, yet the gift was unexplained and you were otherwise unchanged?  How would that change you, and the world around you?Gosh I love this film.  That it is not available on DVD really is a crime.  This film never made the impact in the marketplace it deserves.  Perhaps with a DVD version available, it would.There are copies for sale here that are expensive.  Is it worth it?  Yes.  For every 100 stupid movies available, there is one such as this classic.

Bosco ""DVD Consultant/Reviewer/Writer""","[2, 2]","This incredible and moving film is holds not only first class performances, but is filled with memorable scenes holding an emotional impact that stays with the viewer in a powerful way.  Like so many others who have written about this film here on Amazon, it is a profound experience worthy of repeated viewings.  The quality of this release is slightly less than the normal DVD since it is a DVD-R meaning it has been burned on demand not mass produced as a normal DVD release.  The master used however is newer and an upgrade from the previous one that was used for VHS/Beta.  The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen, in the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1  Color is good as is contrast - it would have yielded a better presentation if it were a standard DVD.  The sound is MONO as was the original theatrical release.  It is unfortunate that UNIVERSAL thinks so little of this film not to give is a standard DVD release, or even better a Blu-ray release.  I have seen this film on cable recently in HD so there is a HD master just waiting to be used...  Having been a writer/review of Home Media I have spoken to those within the studio who have told there was a longer cut of this film that never made it to theaters.  I have seen publicity photos of some of those scenes as well.  It would be nice to have a Special Edition of the film released onto Blu-ray either as a director's cut or as bonus material.  It was still a practice in the 80's not to release a film mix in stereo, however it was not uncommon for a stereo mix to be done for special screening and not used for actual theatrical distribution - so, it would be interesting if this could be researched by the studio and presented in a release that would take advantage of this.  I have contacted Universal and set this as a suggestion so the film could be released as part of their Anniversary.  They should really consider this since the film was nominated for 2 Academy Awards.If you like the film for now this is at least a way to own a decent copy - but remember, DVDRs do not have as long a shelf life as regular DVDs.
