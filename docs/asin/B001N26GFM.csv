That is how it should be, though; we are talking about the Holocaust. You really can't pretty it up, and you ought not to try. I read all the reviews before watching the film, which made the film less suspenseful, and not as dramatic. To get the full effect of the film (which I greatly advise), DO NOT continue reading. Spoilers, well, spoil the film a bit.-------------------SPOILER ALERT----------------------------------I'm not sure that the film is entirely possible. I doubt this ever actually happened, though I suppose it might have. But the story has a big impact. It touches on divisions between members of the family, and conflicts between German soldiers. It reminds the viewer that not all of Germany thought that what happened during the Holocaust was good, or even right. Then again, it also shows the viewer that the opposition did not have much of a voice. The government would quickly squash down any discontent. It also focuses a small amount on propoganda that was being fed to the German population, reminding them that the Jews were evil and responsible for the state of the nation (making the patriots happy), and cast a happy life on the 'work camps', painting them as lovely places with nice food, and sports (keeping the bleeding-heart critics happy). I think it was nice to include the real picture, as it gave credibility to the film. The German population really did have a real clue as to the horrors that went on in the camps right away. Once they realized, there was little anyone could do.

It concerns the life of an eight year old German whose father is a high ranking officer in the SS.  The boy doesn't understand his father's task beyond him being a ""soldier"".  His naivety, however, slowly comes face to face with reality and, ultimately, tragic consequences.The story is seen through the eyes of Bruno (Asa Butterfield) who leads a normal although privileged life in war time Berlin.  His life, however, changes when his father is transferred to the country as the commandant of a concentration camp.  The family's new home is, to the shock of Asa's mother, very close to the camp.Asa is an adventurous youngster and he quickly finds the camp where, through the barbed wire, he befriends a boy in striped pyjamas.  He keeps this friendship from his family.  Indeed, he has trouble understanding what is exactly happening.  It is this naivety that will produce tragedy.""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" is one of the best films of the past year.  The only criticism that I could have is that it is hard to believe that a child would be kept in a concentration camp.  His work effort would have been minimal.  The Nazis would have promptly liquidated him.  Yet, this criticism aside, the film is utterly engrossing.  It would be churlish to downgrade the film on this point alone.

1218725,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001N26GFM,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Gut the film of a few clich&eacute;s and the unintentional humor (some of their more obvious attempts at subtle statements come across slightly amusing) and you'd have a near perfect example of the gritty realities of human weakness.  Yes, the Holocaust, one of the most brutal and overall disgusting `black spots' in human history is given a fresh take in this spellbinding and heartbreaking tale about a young boy oblivious to the horrors his specious is capable of.Makes you sick just thinking about it.The film follows a young boy named Bruno who moves with his family to the countryside.  His father, a high ranking official in the SS troops, has been promoted and so the move is necessary.  Bruno is less than enthused about leaving his friends, but upon arriving at his new home (which is beautiful) he notices a farm out in the distance, and there are children working in the farm.  From the looks of them, they are strange to him, but he is curious.  Despite his parents concern with his venturing `out back', Bruno (who is obsessed with adventure books) decides to sneak away and find the farm.  When he gets there he meets a young boy named Shmuel (pronounced almost like `small').  Young Bruno (and to a degree Shmuel) are oblivious to the truth about the farm.  Bruno is taught that Jews are disgusting people who are less than human and that they are responsible for the fall of German society.  He is also misguided into thinking that the Jews are being properly cared for.  Shmuel is kept in the dark about the eventualities about his stay at the farm.  The two boys strike a friendship and a bond that transcends society's boundaries.If only we could all be as innocent as children.That was one of the main things I gathered from this movie.  I loved the way that it brilliantly captured the forgiving and understanding quality that children possess.  They can see through to the heart of a person.  Even after young Bruno betrays his friend, causing him serious harm, Shmuel forgives him almost instantly, understanding that Bruno was not malicious or hurtful but merely frightened and acted without thinking.  If they had been adults, it would have most likely resulted in a longstanding grudge and retaliation.Another point I gathered from this film, a point I think is remarkably strong, is that not every German completely understood or even agreed with what was taking place.  The character of Elsa, the mother, in particular is a strong one.  She was a woman who was brainwashed by a nation to believe in a `cause' that was horrific in itself, but when she discovered what was being done to the Jews at that farm she was mortified.  It destroyed her.  She was raised to hate them and to believe that they were the enemy, but she was not evil enough to forget that they were human beings.I'm shocked at the poor reception this film garnered, but then again I think many people viewed this as a children's film, which it is not.  In fact, unless you want to answer a lot of uncomfortable and difficult questions, I'd keep the kids FAR away from this movie.That said, the film is borderline genius to be honest.  I mean, I can see the films few flaws and there are some areas I wish were cleaned up a tad, but overall this film simply has everything it needs.  From the brilliant performances (Vera Farmiga is a goddess and young Asa Butterfield probably should have been nominated for an Oscar) to the beautiful sets and stunning camera work to the chilling screenplay that uses a fresh perspective to twist the knife a tad deeper, `The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' is a stunning film that truly deserves to be seen and discussed.",5,My country's density is my density...,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,3651,"['Gut', 'film', 'few', 'clich', 'eacute', 'unintentional', 'humor', 'more', 'obvious', 'attempts', 'subtle', 'statements', 'come', 'slightly', 'amusing', ""'d"", 'have', 'near', 'perfect', 'example', 'gritty', 'realities', 'human', 'weakness', 'Yes', 'Holocaust', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'overall', 'disgusting', 'black', 'spots', 'human', 'history', 'given', 'fresh', 'take', 'spellbinding', 'heartbreaking', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'oblivious', 'horrors', 'specious', 'capable', 'of.Makes', 'sick', 'just', 'thinking', 'it.The', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Bruno', 'who', 'family', 'countryside', 'father', 'high', 'ranking', 'official', 'SS', 'troops', 'been', 'promoted', 'so', 'move', 'necessary', 'Bruno', 'less', 'enthused', 'leaving', 'friends', 'arriving', 'new', 'home', 'beautiful', 'farm', 'out', 'distance', 'are', 'children', 'working', 'farm', 'looks', 'are', 'strange', 'curious', 'parents', 'concern', 'venturing', 'out', 'back', 'Bruno', 'who', 'obsessed', 'adventure', 'books', 'sneak', 'away', 'find', 'farm', 'When', 'there', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Shmuel', 'pronounced', 'almost', 'small', 'Young', 'Bruno', 'degree', 'Shmuel', 'are', 'oblivious', 'truth', 'farm', 'Bruno', 'taught', 'Jews', 'are', 'disgusting', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'human', 'are', 'responsible', 'fall', 'German', 'society', 'also', 'misguided', 'thinking', 'Jews', 'are', 'being', 'properly', 'cared', 'Shmuel', 'kept', 'dark', 'eventualities', 'stay', 'farm', 'two', 'boys', 'friendship', 'bond', 'society', 'boundaries.If', 'only', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'as', 'innocent', 'children.That', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'things', 'gathered', 'movie', 'loved', 'way', 'brilliantly', 'captured', 'forgiving', 'understanding', 'quality', 'children', 'possess', 'can', 'see', 'heart', 'person', 'Even', 'young', 'Bruno', 'friend', 'causing', 'serious', 'harm', 'Shmuel', 'almost', 'instantly', 'understanding', 'Bruno', 'was', 'not', 'malicious', 'hurtful', 'merely', 'frightened', 'acted', 'thinking', 'had', 'been', 'adults', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'resulted', 'longstanding', 'grudge', 'retaliation.Another', 'point', 'gathered', 'film', 'point', 'think', 'remarkably', 'strong', 'not', 'German', 'completely', 'understood', 'even', 'agreed', 'what', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'character', 'Elsa', 'mother', 'particular', 'strong', 'one', 'was', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'brainwashed', 'nation', 'believe', 'cause', 'was', 'horrific', 'when', 'discovered', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'Jews', 'farm', 'was', 'mortified', 'destroyed', 'was', 'raised', 'hate', 'believe', 'were', 'enemy', 'was', 'not', 'evil', 'enough', 'forget', 'were', 'human', 'beings.I', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'poor', 'reception', 'film', 'garnered', 'then', 'again', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'viewed', 'children', 'film', 'not', 'fact', 'want', 'answer', 'lot', 'uncomfortable', 'difficult', 'questions', ""'d"", 'keep', 'kids', 'FAR', 'away', 'movie.That', 'said', 'film', 'borderline', 'genius', 'be', 'honest', 'mean', 'can', 'see', 'films', 'few', 'flaws', 'are', 'areas', 'wish', 'were', 'cleaned', 'up', 'tad', 'film', 'simply', 'everything', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'goddess', 'young', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'stunning', 'camera', 'work', 'chilling', 'screenplay', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'twist', 'knife', 'tad', 'deeper', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'stunning', 'film', 'truly', 'be', 'seen', 'discussed']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1218726,A23WW967L3V194,B001N26GFM,Angie,"[2, 3]","This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. Based on the moving and dramatic novel by John Boyne (most recommended you'll read the book first, equally excellent, before you get to the movie), this is the extraordinary tale of a small German eight-year old kid named Bruno, a kid full of curiosity and motivation that happens to live during one of the most horrible periods of time - that of the Second War World. One fateful day, Bruno moves to live with his family to a far away place, at least far away from his beloved Berlin, where he's leaving behind him his close friends and his former lifestyle. Now, desolated from any urban place known to Bruno, his new house is located near what he's mistaken to assume is a farm, a farm filled with strange inhabitants, all dressed in some kind of striped black and white pajamas, and all with a gloomy and rather sad look in their eyes. Bored with his new house which seem to be isolated from the real world, and having no new friends that he can visit nearby, Bruno decides to explore the vast 'farm' territory he can see in the distance from his bedroom window. One day, during one of his wanderings near the huge peculiar fence that separates his world from 'the other world' he sees a small boy, his age, sitting on the ground on the other side of the fence. This boy, Bruno guesses, is one of those 'farmers' dressed in the striped pajamas. From this point on in the story the two kids develop a most unusual and deep friendship, whose tragic consequences will be revealed just towards the end of the story.The things here are more complicated than what they seem, considering the fact Bruno's father is no less than the threatening commander of the 'farm' - which is actually a death camp, one of those who sealed the miserable fate of the Jews victims during that horrible war... Bruno represents the childhood innocence still not destroyed, while his father - which Bruno adores, by the way - represents cruelty and terror, although of-course between the four walls of his home he's a most loyal, kind and loving husband and father to his two children, a girl and a boy. While Bruno's sister, Gretel, becomes a fan of the Nazis ideas, Bruno is not aware of the horrifying events that occur outside his world - and so, he brings some hope, ray of sunshine and laughter to the short life of poor Shmuel, who's one and only 'sin' is being born a Jew. For almost a year Bruno keeps on meeting with his new friend, until one day they both disappear... Leaving us only to imagine what were their last thoughts during their last minutes among the living.This is one film that seems too tragic to be true, but as they say, the truth is sometimes crueler than imagination, and it's terrible to think this story could really happen in reality... What I liked especially here is the fact you get to hear the story of the Jewish biggest tragedy of all times from the perspective of an Ari boy, and that serves as a reminder to us that not all the people related to Nazis where vicious or  cruel; Sometimes they just happen to be relatives of the monsters called Nazis by chance, not really on their own will. As a proof to that, I found the scenes in which Bruno's mother fights with her husband about his controversial decision of moving to live near a death camp, really reliable and emotional, as I'm sure a lot of wives of these devils didn't reconcile with the fact their husbands are heartless murderers who are able of doing all the horrors in the world once they get an order. In my opinion, this movie gives you the lesson of what might happen when the two worlds - of healthy childhood and the other, of pure insanity and blood-spilling - are colliding. Indeed, more tragic results than what's happening here you won't get to find anywhere else.I was more than impressed with the crew of wonderful actors, each one devoted to his/her role in the most convincing way. You'll be amazed at how people who lived among us not even one-hundred years ago yet, could lack humanity and compassion, like the Nazis were.

1218731,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B001N26GFM,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I'm very conflicted about this movie. For one thing, it's hard to see Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) playing an SS officer. Sure, he's cute little Bruno's father, and that voice is clearly the same one with which Lupin addressed Harry Potter. But he develops a rather hard edge as a necessary part of his job as Commander of a death camp. And his very handsome young driver (Henry Kingsmill, whom I KNOW I have seen somewhere before, but don't know where) also gets a pretty sharp edge, in part to compensate for an ""unpatriotic"" father who went to Switzerland at the time of the rise of the Nazis.Bruno and his family lived in a perfectly marvelous old house in Berlin, where his family was obviously important. His parents tried to make ""moving to the country"" sound great when they went to put Father in charge of the ""work camp,"" which Bruno at first took to be a farm. It's strange, though, because all the farmers wear striped pajamas. The house is starkly modern, and I suspect brand new. But it's large and they have several servants, so what's the kid's problem? He's bored. He's even more bored when he finds that he and his older sister are to have a tutor instead of going out to school.Bruno is terribly bored because he's not allowed to go beyond the front courtyard of their home, which is surrounded by a steel fence. Guarded by soldiers, presumably because his father is so important. He's not even supposed to be in the back yard, but he's a natural explorer, and so he explores, and discovers a window in a storage shed that gives him access to the wooded area behind the house. This in turn leads him to a tall fence strung with barbed wire, where near the fence sits a boy just his age who is named Shmuel. He'd never heard of anyone named Shmuel before, but then Shmuel had never heard of anyone named Bruno before, so they are even on that. Both being lonely, they make friends.We who know what the camp was all about are aware that this friendship can be dangerous for both boys, but we're into the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film before we find out just how dangerous. Of course I'm not going to give it away.

1218733,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001N26GFM,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","I'm really SHOCKED right now.  Talk about a moving film.  More like soul-crushingly moving.  You know for years, ever since grade school in fact, I've often wondered if any such communication between the German and Jewish children actually took place in secret.  I think about these kind of things all the time.  Even during important history lessons- when I was supposed to be taking notes for an upcoming test, instead I spent my time daydreaming over scenarios nearly identical to the one portrayed in the Boy In the Striped Pajamas.The greatest thing about being a child is that, they don't automatically hate what they don't understand.  Instead, children are, more times than not, curious and confused.  When a German kid takes a walk through the forest and finds a concentration camp victim around his age sitting alone and depressed, the two of them immediately hit off a wonderful friendship.  Curiosity gets the best of both children- the German boy doesn't understand why the Jewish boy on the other side of the electric fence can't come out to play, so initially he assumes the boy must be locked inside a playground and thinks he's lucky.  This is exactly what any child his age would think.  At least, I know *I* would have.  Children really do have more sense than adults whether intentional or not, and this movie shows a perfectly fine example.As a 30-year old man myself, and I honestly don't want to turn this into a debate by any means, I have a difficult time believing grown men would actually think it's right to kill a group of others based on their religion.  I realize I'm too locked into the modern world to even comprehend what really occurred back in the early 40's other than what I've seen in movies and read in history books, but... grown men (German soldiers) that believe killing other human beings is actually right, and to not even give it a second thought?  I don't get it at all.I will NOT spoil the ending and I really hope nobody else does either.  I don't even want to say whether it's a happy or sad ending.  Let's just say, it's totally shocking.  However, you can probably guess judging by the melodic and downbeat soundtrack that tends to focus around light orchestration and piano.The one thing that confused me and perhaps I missed a crucial storyline element somewhere along the way (I admit, I often have a hard time focusing on the fine details) is why the entire German family has a British accent.  I imagine the British wouldn't care for this at all (especially the elderly) since it might paint a false view of the events that really happened during World War II.  In other words, the British accents might lead the more uninformed movie watchers out there to believe it was the British responsible for the war.  They should have focused the movie on actual Germans and their accents so there's no misunderstandings whatsoever.Overall, a war movie focusing on a child's viewpoint.  Expect more emotions and less fighting.

One adapted film that didn't get much recognition, however, is The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, based on the novel by John Boyne.The film opens with the following quote emblazoned on the screen:  ""Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.""  As the quote suggests, this is a sort of coming of age film, and over the course of 94 minutes,those in the audience slowly watch the innocence of children unravel before their eyes as the reality of what is taking place becomes more and more illuminated.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is the story of a family living in Berlin during World War II. The main character, an eight-year-old boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), spends his time in Berlin playing with his friends and reading adventure novels.  His father, brilliantly played by David Thewlis (most will recognize him as Professor Lupin from the Harry Potter franchise), soon gets a promotion, however, and Bruno, his parents, and his sister move to the German countryside where his father will take up his new position.  Unlike their time in Berlin, Bruno's parents are careful to keep their son close to home, and Bruno, an explorer and adventurer at heart, is confined to the small fenced area surrounding their house.From his bedroom window, Bruno can see what he thinks is a strange farm off in the distance.  He notices that the ""farmers"" act strangely and wear strange ""pajamas"" while they work.  Later, he notices that the smokestacks on the farm give off an absolutely wretched stench when they are burning.  By now, of course, the audience knows that what Bruno has seen is not a farm at all, and that his father's new position is Commandant of the nearby concentration camp.The naive Bruno manages to escape from the grounds of his home and is finally free to explore the woods behind the house.  Not paying much attention to where he is going, he happens upon a remote part of the camp where he meets another eight-year-old boy, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), confined by a different kind of fence. The two become friends, and Bruno sneaks away every chance he gets to go and visit the only playmate he has found since moving away from Berlin.This is an interesting film on many accounts, the most fascinating being the changes that each member of Bruno's family undergoes.  His father, a seemingly reluctant, ""political only"" Nazi at the beginning, devolves into a hardened, harsh man.  Bruno's sister Gretel (Amber Beattie), encouraged by a handsome lieutenant working with her father, falls victim to the Aryan propaganda so much that her room is soon filled with posters of the Fuhrer, much like young girls today would adorn their walls with images of the Jonas Brothers. Finally, there's Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), who is the antithesis to the growing Nazism in her family.  At first she is happy for her husband and the success he has as a soldier in the German army.  However, as she learns more about her husband's new charge, and the truth is revealed about the camp, she becomes bitter and angry.And then there's Bruno.  All the signs are there.  Bruno comes across every hint he possibly could as to the truth behind the ""farm"" where his friend Shmuel lives and works.  Yet he remains utterly oblivious.  Caught between the two stages of ""sounds and smells and sights"" and ""the dark hour of reason,"" the filmmakers show the great price of failing to deal with the world around us.Much of the criticism that I've read regarding this film deals with the supposed overextension of innocence to both child characters.  Many critics cannot grasp the idea of an eight-year-old child not understanding that the ""farm"" is really a horrible work camp, that the ""pajamas"" are prison clothes, that the mysterious disappearances that Shmuel tells of and the smoke from the chimneys are the results of the systematic slaughter of the camp's inhabitants.  That may be a fair criticism, but I think it misses the greater point that the filmmakers seem to be making.Bigger than a child's loss of innocence, Bruno seems to be a representation of Germany, perhaps even humanity, itself, and the failure to deal with the evil right before one's very eyes.  So many Germans claimed the innocence that we see in Bruno, saying they had no knowledge of the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem that Hitler and his SS were carrying out across the European continent.  Even today, despite all the existing evidence, there are still those that deny the Holocaust happened, not wanting to acknowledge the great evil of which humanity, perhaps even their neighbors and family members, is capable.  More than anything else, this film shows the great price humanity pays for such utter naivete.All in all, this is a very well done film.  The story, though slow in the beginning, is engaging, thought-provoking, and, in the end, heart-wrenching.  It is well-acted, especially in the performances of the young boys, and the bright colors and airy score provide a sort of bizarre juxtaposition to what is happening on screen.The DVD includes the typical bonus features of deleted scenes and a feature-length commentary, as well as a featurette entitled ""Friendship Beyond the Fence.""",4,"An atypical Holocaust film that is engaging,

1218745,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B001N26GFM,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[2, 2]","This movie is a vivid, meticulously observed and detailed attempt to imagine the unthinkable, to see the unimaginable - through the eyes of a child, a lively and outgoing little boy named Bruno. Bruno is the youngest member of a loving and affectionate family; he has an older sister who is at that age of being on the cusp between playing with her vast collection of dolls and her first teenage crush. Their father is a professional soldier, rising up in the ranks, who has a prestigious new assignment which will take them far from the city, and their mother, a beautiful socialite - who obviously cherishes her children, nonetheless.  It is a small world, the world of a child - delineated by the streets between a home and school, playmates and parents, the grandparents - a gruff and bluff Grandfather, and the queenly grandmother with sharp eyes and an even sharper tongue. Within the space of the first ten minutes, Bruno and his family are wrenched away from everything familiar and dear, when his father is sent off to a new assignment - away from a comfortable and stately old house in the city to a new and uncomfortably modern one, away out in the country.Of course, it is instantly plain to everyone above the awareness of a mollusk that Bruno's father is an SS officer in Nazi Germany, and that the new assignment is at a concentration camp ... and that the uncomfortably modern villa - so far away from everyone and everywhere, and staffed by slave labor - is on the periphery of the camp, where Bruno's father is in charge. The viewer knows this, simultaneously seeing and knowing, and yet seeing it filtered through Bruno's awareness, that bright and lonely small boy looking for someone to play with. In spite of his parents' efforts to keep him out of the back garden and woods which lead down to the periphery fence around the camp, Bruno does find a friend, another bright and lonely small boy, a Jewish prisoner named Shemuel. They play checkers through the fence, strike up an unlikely friendship. Bruno brings him food - and childlike, never gets around to wondering why Shemuel is constantly hungry.Other reviewers have noted that both Bruno, and especially Shemuel seem to be quite terribly - even fatally nave about a great many matters, not finding it quite credible that both of them would be so clueless about the camp, about Nazi aims for the Jews, about the purpose of the camp itself, especially after the brutality that Shemuel experiences during this movie, and that he would have experienced in being brought to the camp. It might be stretching the bounds of believability, but I recall that I, as  child among other children, lived in our very own world. Nothing bad could ever happen to children, and yet at the same time, we were most amazingly accepting of the most startling circumstances, as long as our parents were present, and calm. Of course we were safe, Mummy and Dad were there and they said so. Remembering this, I can accept that Bruno would go to Shemuel's aid within the camp - Shemuel was his friend, and Bruno felt guilty for having let him down, once.  And so this movie ends, on an abrupt and brutal note. Although it is about children, it is not a movie for children of the age that the protagonists are.Of the extras, there is the usual ""Making of"" feature, and a selection of deleted scenes - about half of which, in my opinion, would have been very well included in the feature itself.",4,"Seeing the Unthinkable, Through the Eyes of a Child",1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,3446,"['movie', 'vivid', 'meticulously', 'observed', 'detailed', 'attempt', 'imagine', 'unthinkable', 'see', 'unimaginable', 'eyes', 'child', 'lively', 'outgoing', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'Bruno', 'Bruno', 'youngest', 'member', 'loving', 'affectionate', 'family', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'age', 'being', 'cusp', 'playing', 'vast', 'collection', 'dolls', 'first', 'teenage', 'crush', 'father', 'professional', 'soldier', 'rising', 'up', 'ranks', 'who', 'prestigious', 'new', 'assignment', 'will', 'take', 'far', 'city', 'mother', 'beautiful', 'socialite', 'who', 'obviously', 'children', 'nonetheless', 'small', 'world', 'world', 'child', 'delineated', 'streets', 'home', 'school', 'playmates', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'gruff', 'bluff', 'Grandfather', 'queenly', 'grandmother', 'sharp', 'eyes', 'even', 'sharper', 'tongue', 'space', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Bruno', 'family', 'are', 'wrenched', 'away', 'everything', 'familiar', 'dear', 'when', 'father', 'sent', 'off', 'new', 'assignment', 'away', 'comfortable', 'stately', 'old', 'house', 'city', 'new', 'uncomfortably', 'modern', 'one', 'away', 'country.Of', 'course', 'instantly', 'plain', 'everyone', 'awareness', 'mollusk', 'Bruno', 'father', 'SS', 'officer', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'new', 'assignment', 'concentration', 'camp', 'uncomfortably', 'modern', 'villa', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'everyone', 'everywhere', 'staffed', 'slave', 'labor', 'periphery', 'camp', 'where', 'Bruno', 'father', 'charge', 'viewer', 'simultaneously', 'seeing', 'knowing', 'yet', 'seeing', 'filtered', 'Bruno', 'awareness', 'bright', 'lonely', 'small', 'boy', 'looking', 'someone', 'play', 'spite', 'parents', 'efforts', 'keep', 'back', 'garden', 'woods', 'lead', 'periphery', 'fence', 'camp', 'Bruno', 'find', 'friend', 'bright', 'lonely', 'small', 'boy', 'Jewish', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Shemuel', 'play', 'checkers', 'fence', 'strike', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Bruno', 'food', 'childlike', 'never', 'wondering', 'why', 'Shemuel', 'constantly', 'hungry.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'Bruno', 'especially', 'Shemuel', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'terribly', 'even', 'fatally', 'nave', 'great', 'many', 'matters', 'not', 'finding', 'quite', 'credible', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'clueless', 'camp', 'Nazi', 'aims', 'Jews', 'purpose', 'camp', 'especially', 'brutality', 'Shemuel', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'experienced', 'being', 'brought', 'camp', 'might', 'be', 'stretching', 'bounds', 'believability', 'recall', 'child', 'other', 'children', 'lived', 'very', 'own', 'world', 'Nothing', 'bad', 'could', 'ever', 'happen', 'children', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'were', 'most', 'amazingly', 'accepting', 'most', 'startling', 'circumstances', 'as', 'long', 'parents', 'were', 'present', 'calm', 'course', 'were', 'safe', 'Mummy', 'Dad', 'were', 'said', 'so', 'Remembering', 'can', 'accept', 'Bruno', 'would', 'go', 'Shemuel', 'aid', 'camp', 'Shemuel', 'was', 'friend', 'Bruno', 'felt', 'guilty', 'having', 'let', 'down', 'once', 'so', 'movie', 'abrupt', 'brutal', 'note', 'children', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'age', 'protagonists', 'are.Of', 'extras', 'usual', 'Making', 'feature', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'half', 'opinion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'included', 'feature']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

1218749,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001N26GFM,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","You'd think it would be easy to determine how to feel about ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" but no, it isn't. Despite the heavy subject matter, it tells such a simple, direct story, and there are virtually no gray areas in terms of character development. Everyone is defined so thoroughly at the start of the film that they never really have the chance to become something else, which is to say that there's no sense of maturation. I believe this also applies to the main character, an eight-year-old German boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), who at the height of Hitler's regime moves with his family from Berlin into the countryside. Their new home is directly next to a concentration camp, where an eight-year-old Jewish boy named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) spends his time sitting at the electrified border. When Bruno goes exploring one day, he meets Shmuel, and even though they're separated, the two become friends. Despite the fact that Bruno learns a great deal over the course of the film, I'm hard pressed to say that he transitions from ignorance to knowledge. Quite simply, there's just so much he doesn't understand.In all fairness, that's probably a much more realistic approach to the material. We've seen so many films that adhere to the ""Amazing Grace"" principle, in which characters are lost then found, blind then able to see. We get nothing like that from ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."" Bruno is incredibly ignorant, mostly because he grew up in a world that wanted to keep him that way. He hears and sees anti-Semitic propaganda all around him, and yet we're never really sure if he believes any of it. I say this because he's the kind of child that asks a lot of questions, most of which aren't answered satisfactorily; those that are answered inevitably lead to even more questions, which is a good thing because it proves he's actually thinking. His only problem is that he's never able to come to a conclusion. All he can do is keep wondering why certain things are the way they are. That may explain why he would much rather read an adventure story than a history textbook--daring explorers in fantasy worlds are much easier to understand.Bruno is essentially the film's strongest element. Not so strong are most of the other characters, which are all so rigidly constructed. Bruno's father, Ralf (David Thewlis), is a strict Nazi soldier who oversees the neighboring concentration camp. Bruno's mother, Elsa (Vera Farmiga), spends much of the film is a blissful state of ignorance, aware that Jews are the enemy but blind to the fact that many are tortured and killed; even when she discovers why the smoke emanating from the camp's chimneys is so foul-smelling, she can do nothing but cry uncontrollably. Bruno's twelve-year-old sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), is strong-headed and hopelessly brainwashed.The rest of the supporting characters were never given the chance to fully develop, which is a shame considering the potential they all had. One is Bruno's grandmother (Sheila Hancock), who doesn't get along with her son because, apparently, she doesn't quite buy into Hitler's vision for a glorious future. Another is Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend), a young Nazi soldier that Gretel has a crush on. The dramatic possibilities for this character were mostly overlooked, reducing him to little more than a passing reference. There are, in fact, only two supporting characters that work well. One is Shmuel, who, because of his age, is just as ignorant as Bruno; he knows that life is hard for him in the camp, but he has no real idea how things work under a Nazi regime. Another is Pavel (David Hayman), an imprisoned Jew who's often sent to work in Bruno's family's kitchen. When Bruno cuts his leg after falling off a handmade tire swing, Pavel tends to his wounds; when he tells Bruno that he used to practice as a doctor, Bruno fails to understand why a doctor would give that up to be a potato peeler.His ignorance plays a vital role in the film's emotionally draining ending, which will no doubt divide audiences. There's no resolution--there's only a slow, agonizing fade to black. There's also the sickening feeling that, as far as the characters are concerned, absolutely nothing has been learned. There was an audible reaction amongst the people I saw this film with. As we all walked out of the theater, one woman behind me said, ""What a disappointing ending."" I was compelled to turn around and calmly ask her, ""What more needed to be said?"" The way I see it, the final scene of ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is perfectly acceptable; given the course of events, which I obviously can't describe, there would be no way to prolong the ending without it seeming forced.As I said at the beginning, it isn't easy determining how to feel about this film. It's an above average story of friendship, and I was certainly moved a great deal by it. But it's not without its flaws, especially when it comes to character development. On the whole, I think it's fair to say that it's an unforgettable film, highly emotional and deeply thought provoking. ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" will not give everyone what they want, but that doesn't mean it doesn't say everything it needs to say. In other words, it tells a complete story. It doesn't, however, give us complete characters, which is clearly a disappointment given the powerful nature of the subject matter. And while only a minor thing, some may also be bothered by the fact that an entirely British cast portrays German characters. If seeing this movie depends on a single reason, let it be Asa Butterfield, who does a wonderful job as Bruno, a curious, nave young boy.

The basic story is that of Bruno, the nave and innocent son of the camp commandant of a Jewish concentration camp (Auschwitz). Bored with the lack of playmates, Bruno goes exploring and finds a boy in striped pyjamas on the other side of a high fence, and makes friends, with tragic consequences. The movie follows the basic tenet of the book, but differs on some minor points, (certainly, Shmuel looked less like a starved Jew than Bruno did).

1218758,A39U50ZJPWZ9P3,B001N26GFM,Darrell,"[24, 26]","By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.comThis emotionally wrenching film deserves 10 Stars. Changed my life forever and a major part of my life was spent in motion pictures. The movie will change your life everlastingly too if you open your heart to a simple fictional story of a little German boy who befriends a Jewish boy through the barbed wire fence of a concentration camp.My heart was ripped out, but I will be a more loving, gracious, forgiving person for having seen this sensitive and also horrifying motion picture. YES, as the reviewers have said: It is ""historically inaccurate to the extreme."" ""It is total fiction."" It is ""ridiculously contrived."" It is ""all too absurd."" It is ""hard to swallow."" It is ""forced and artificial,"" and ""The actors have British accents instead of German.""One critic posed the question, ""Did Bruno's father in the end get what he deserved?"" Such moralizing and such criticisms of the film make me wonder if those viewers of the film missed the unanswered questions of the Holocaust. How could it happen? How could so many good people allow it to happen?The most insightful reviewer said, ""What is appalling to me is reading all of the one-star reviews. I now see how the holocaust (shoah) could have taken place. All that is necessary is for a nation to be composed of and ruled by people with no feelings, bereft of human compassion and sensitivity, just like several of the reviewers here.""Great Art (even fiction) reveals to us ""things as they really are"". Through Bruno and his mother, we see through the eyes of Germans who were totally innocent until they came face to face with with the horrors of the ""final solution."" Most Europeans accepted the deportation of Jews, some not knowing what would be their fate and others even accepting the fate of Jews because it was so easy to blame Jewish Merchants and Jewish Bankers for World War 1 and for the collapse of the German economy. Savings were totally wiped out. It took 22 million German Marks to buy a loaf of bread. Though not the same, we can understand today how easy it would be to blame all Muslims for 9/11.Through Bruno's sister we see how easy it was to indoctrinate an entire nation of German youth. A notable exception was the 17 year old Mormon boy, Helmuth Hubener, that resisted the 3rd Reich and was sentenced by a German Court for treason and beheaded by guillotine on October 27, 1942 at Pl&ouml;tzensee Prison in Berlin. (See his true story on Wikipedia!)In this motion picture we see and learn how good men, good fathers, and good soldiers, putting military obedience ahead of even their mothers, wives and children, directed and became the executioners of millions of Jews. Even still photos of all the corpses, and eye witness accounts of the Holocaust do not give us that understanding.Last, by identifying and seeing through the eyes of an innocent child, we learn from the film what it was like to be ordered into the gas chambers. No other motion picture, book, or document has ever, or ever will, capture that experience or the depth of those feelings like the film ""Boy in the Stripped Pajamas.""Would that each viewer could become as a little child (Matthew 18:3), like Bruno, not judgmental, and not critical.  The Holocaust (like the film) is hard to believe but the gas chambers to kill and the ovens to burn bodies were real. I've seen them with my own eyes. I've been in the house made sacred by Anne Frank. My next door neighbor was one of the first U.S. soldiers into the Dachau Prison Camp, and my neighbor across the street served in the Danish Underground.Let us resolve, NEVER AGAIN, not just in five languages, but in all the languages of the world. There were those in Germany that truly did not know what was happening to the Jews, but no other film answers for me how an entire nation could be led by one man to kill, or accept the killing, of so many. I will be forever haunted by the words, ""If he had been your Fuehrer, you would have followed him too.""  Although it is fiction, ""Boy In the Striped Pajamas"" reveals not the historical truth, but the TRUTH of Nazi Germany as it was.FOOTNOTE: What follows regarding man's inhumanity to man is presented because HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF IF WE DO NOT KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IT!People today need to know that Hitler did not invent anti-semitism. It began with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and has never ceased. It is mind boggling to learn that throughout history there have been innumerable and hundreds of attempts in many countries to kill all of the Jews. (See ""Pogroms"" on Google, then read the Wikipedia account.)I was shocked beyond belief to read Martin Luther's anti Jewish sentiments published in 1543 (See ""On the Jews and Their Lies - Wikipedia""  Luther's feelings about the Jews and what should be done to them were as vile and reprehensible, as any words spoken in Nazi Germany. Indeed, Luther's document may have been the blueprint for the Nazi Holocaust.Seeing history repeat itself so many times makes us wonder if there is hope to save the Jews and the world from so much hate and killing. Pope John VI in 1965 issued his historic ""Nostra Aetate"" that expresses understanding, forgiveness and love for the Jews and for all religions.  Pope John VI states in this history changing document that the death of Christ, ""cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today."" The age old doctrine behind all of the Pogroms which stated that ""all Jews, past, present, and future were collectively guilty of the Crucifixion of Jesus,"" was officially revoked by a Catholic Pope! EVERYONE should read entirely the ""Nostra Aetate"" which is one of the most important documents in the history of mankind (It takes just a few minutes to read and can be found on Google)! The current Pope Benedict XVI who was forced to join the Hitler Youth as a child in Nazi Germany (in two books) has made a sweeping exoneration of the Jewish people for the death of Jesus Christ. There is hope for the world! These are history changing actions by two Catholic Popes. It would be well for everyone who wants the world to be a better place to thank Catholics for Pope John VI and Pope Benedict XVI.We must be ever vigilant against condemning another. ""Therefore thou art inexcusable, Oh man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest doest the same things."" (Romans 2:1). Jews who migrated to Israel after World War 11, themselves committed a Holocaust of the Palestinian people. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed and nearly one million were forced into refugee camps. ""This is my Land. God gave this Land to me,"" was not justification for killing the Palestinians!There is one notable voice in the Middle East that documents the atrocities by all three sides and seeks to reconcile Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Elias Chacour, a Palestinian Melkite Christian Priest has established a school in Ibillon near Galilee where Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Druze study side by side. More important than their secular studies, students learn to love their enemies. To bring peace to the Holy Land, Elias Chacour's book ""BLOOD BROTHERS"" SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERYONE.Two unsung and less known heroes of the Holocaust are Irena Sendler and Raoul Wallenberg. Their stories should be told along with the stories of Oskar Schindler, Corrie Ten Boom, and Anne Frank. Irena Sendler was a Polish Catholic Social worker who saved more than 2500 Jewish Children from the Warsaw Ghetto. If you have any interest in the Holocaust, YOU MUST READ the inspiring story ""Life in A Jar - The Irena Sendler Story"" on Google. In 2007 when Sendler was still alive, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Al Gore received the prize that year instead.Raoul Wallenberg is credited with saving near 100,000 Hungarian Jews. At the peril of his life he defied the Nazis innumerable times. Read a summary of Wallenberg's unbelievable courage to save Hungarian Jews on Google: ""Profile of a Leader: The Wallenberg Effect."" See Wallenberg's complete story in the book ""Righteous Gentile"" available used from amazon.com from a number of book dealers for one cent plus $3.99 for shipping and handling.  EVERY reviewer gave the book 5 stars! Unlike Schindler, Wallenberg had only his humanity and no ulterior motive in saving Jews; and he probably saved more Jews than Schindler.Few Motion pictures can compare to the book. The motion picture ""Wallenberg A Hero's Story"" is even equal to the book ""Righteous Gentile""! Both the book and the movie will lift your very being to heaven. Man at his best is so good, so noble, so Christlike, that we would fain throw a cover over men and women when they are less. Mankind needs Hero's like Wallenberg to lift and redeem us. It will make anyone a better person to make the book or the motion picture a part of their life.See all of my Reviews.

1218760,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B001N26GFM,David Seaman,"[0, 0]","It is quite possible that more has been written and filmed about The Holocaust than any other historical event. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted.John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain ""the voice,"" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a ""telling"" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, ""Heil Hitler"" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, ""Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.""Mark Herman, under the umbrella of both Miramax and BBC Films set forth to create this book effectively for film- a difficult task given that so much of the emotional swtruggle is internal and difficult to show on film, but he managed it and did so beautifully. Becauswe this film is in the smae catagoiry (in regard to quality) as ""Sophie's Choice"" I couldnt give it five stars- that doesn't mean that everyone shouldn't see this film. The small issues with the film are strongly outweighed by the genuis behind it- most of that genuis comes from the premise which leads us back to John Boyne.The boy, his name Bruno; his age eight and is able to say things with just his eyes that make the fiolm entiurely possible. Without Bruno (expeertly plkayed by Asa Butterfield) the filmn wouldnp;t work. His co -star, the nine yea old Schmuel on the other side of the fenvce ius played by Jack Scanlon who manages to exude sadnewss. The confussion that Bruno has regarding their situation is simply too complicated for Schmuel to explain. The finest performance in the film belongs to Vera Famiga, who plays Bruno's mother and wife to the Commandant at this camp. Like ""Sophies Choice"" and Meryl Streep's classic performance in that film, Farmiga builds and devlops over a period of ninety-three minutes until, at the apogee of the film we see her undderstanding reach fruition, just as the rain begins to fall. Her emotional breakdown at this point is raw, honest and something to which every parent can connect.The film score, composed and performed by James horner (""Titanic"") is a character unto itselflThe entire score is based upon a simple piece he composed that sounds like a gentle folks song. It is diatonic and in three quarter time. He utilizes synthesiers as well as wind instruments to add omonious irony to his music (the synthesisisers were expertly prograqmmed by Ian Underwood and Aaron Martin; the music editor was Dick Bernstein. The score builds momentum and continues, often at battle with itself, disploaying conflict between the characters as well as the situation itself. The music reaches it end with the film on a perfect ubnison which echos, just as the movie does.The innocence and ignorance of this young boy is as critical to the brilliance of this work as the story of the Titanic. (I speak not just of Cameron's film, but Maury Yeston's musical, ""a Night to Remember"" and the three other films made between 1938 and 1984) Herin is a tool where the audience not only knows so much more than Bruno, but that we are anticipating the sadness that ends the film. So we are prepared to cry but when the end does come, it is so shockiung that we aren;t ablke to cry; it';s not possiblke, this ending, though we've taken every step with these two boys and, of courwe (nbecause of our knowledge of what really happened) we know all too well that the ending is quite feasible.This film is by no means a ""Sophie's Choice"" though the horror is just as shocking, but few situations in cinematic history have been able to achieve what ""Sophie's Choice"" did. Still, the two films use a similar foundation but are about very different things. Where the ending is horrifyingly shocking and, like  ""Sophie's Choice,"" completely unexpected (who in fact could have imagined an ending such as this one) the poignancy of ""The Boy In Striped Pajamas"" makes it impossible for this film- and the fame it will generate - to be satirized in any way. Because the innocence and ignorance, as a result of the way his parents have shielded Bruno, is a metaphor for the way in which the population who was aware of the death camps were inactive; complacent and how the same continues to occur day after day from the beginning of recorded time to the continued genocide in Darfur- the world's largest death camp- to which the UN has placed sanctions against while The full force of the American military tore apart Iraq in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction.The current political winds in the United States suggest that Gay Americans and Female Americans are just as vulnerable. All of these circumstances suggest that you could very well be next. John Boyne's book manages to suggest all of this is his two hundred page fable using a modicum of brilliantly chosen words. His ending:John Boyle has sub-titled his book, A Fable"" and it is. His final words are like a double edged sword:""And that's the end of the story of Bruno and his family. Of course all of thishappened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again.Not in this day and age.""The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others.As a parent I would have watched this film with both of my daughters as early as sixth grade. Perhaps earlier. Those things that they d0o not understand will gloss over them; they will ask the right questions at the right times and it would be very wise to prepare a parental lesson plan for this because our children must learn of the Hollocaust and by far, this is the best way to introduce it to them I've seem to date. After this, they can read Anne Frank's diary and collefctively with the schools curriculum, they can see. but as we all learneed from Jonathan Demme's ""silence of the Lambs"" what the film doesn;t show and is left for our minds to create is often more horrific than a John Carpenter slaher film.The filmn is not able to end with the same impact as the book, but the ending is still remarkably powerful, filled with painful irony and one image that we watch for a few moments longer than we wish to as we see that there really was no other way this story could end.",4,This film is in the

It showed how hate is taught and cultivated not inborn.It shows how the innocence of a child can be his salvation and it can also be his destruction.Watching the friendship between the little german boy and the ""little jewish boy in the concentration camp"" was so touching and heart tugging, watching their confusion as to why they were supposed to hate each other was in itself a message,and the fact that they didn't hate each other should be the answer..  .The fence that kept them apart was not very constricting but at the same time it was as vast as an ocean between them.This is such a powerful movie that I was in awe and shock at the boldness of the last act.I won't give too much away as not to spoil but I will say that during the last act I was saying to myself ""they couldn't allow this to happen could they?""but then I thought again and said ""why not?""what makes the person in question any less deserving of such cruelty than the others involved.This movie will stay with you long after you take it out of the DVD player.",5,The Sins of the father fall upon the innocent,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,1446,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'liked', 'war', 'themed', 'films', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'looked', 'sweet', 'yet', 'brutal', 'story', 'when', 'saw', 'previews.When', 'watched', 'was', 'surprised', 'range', 'emotions', 'was', 'story', 'taboo', 'friendships', 'common', 'threads', 'bind', 'humans', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstance.There', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'characters', 'movie', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'showed', 'how', 'hate', 'taught', 'cultivated', 'not', 'inborn.It', 'how', 'innocence', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'salvation', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'destruction.Watching', 'friendship', 'little', 'german', 'boy', 'little', 'jewish', 'boy', 'concentration', 'camp', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'heart', 'tugging', 'watching', 'confusion', 'why', 'were', 'supposed', 'hate', 'other', 'was', 'message', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'other', 'should', 'be', 'answer..', '.The', 'fence', 'kept', 'apart', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'constricting', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'as', 'vast', 'ocean', 'them.This', 'such', 'powerful', 'movie', 'was', 'awe', 'shock', 'boldness', 'last', 'act.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'not', 'spoil', 'will', 'say', 'last', 'act', 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'could', ""n't"", 'allow', 'happen', 'could', 'then', 'thought', 'again', 'said', 'why', 'not', 'what', 'person', 'question', 'less', 'deserving', 'such', 'cruelty', 'others', 'involved.This', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'take', 'DVD', 'player']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

I knew there would be sad tones and sad themes given that it was a Holocaust movie.  But I thought that since it was from a child's point of view it would be more palatable.  And for the most part it was, and probably because it was from a child's point of view.  But the ending was anything but palatable.  It was dark and terrible even by Holocaust movie standards.The story of a young son of a concentration camp commandant who befriends a Jewish boy his age on the other side of the wire may sound a bit implausible to die-hard history buffs, but it definitely makes for a fascinating premise.  And so the viewer (or reader, as it was based on a novel) is very interested in seeing how it all plays out.What surprised me most about THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS was the light-hearted and sometimes even downright humorous moments.  The great paradox is to find oneself chuckling during a light scene only to be suddenly jolted out of one's humor a mere second or two later and brought back to the reality of what the film is about.The acting by all cast members is superb, but especially by the two principal boy actors portraying Bruno, the 8-year-old son of the Nazi commandant and Shmuel (pronounced SHMOLL), the Jewish boy who is prisoner in Bruno's father's concentration camp.  Their on-screen chemistry far surpasses that of most adult movie stars in the industry today.The primary problem I have with STRIPED PAJAMAS is I have no idea who this film's target audience is meant to be.  Perhaps adults, but most adults would be able to handle a more realistic (by ""realistic"" I simply mean in terms of graphic content) portrayal of the Holocaust.  This film is certainly violent, but virtually all of the violence occurs off-screen and is implied.  (The filmmakers did an excellent job of shocking the audience more by what is not seen than what is seen.  Especially at the end.)  The target audience may also be children, but I would not let a child of mine watch this unless they were at least 11 or 12 years of age and were able to handle this kind of subject matter.Overall, STRIPED PAJAMAS is one of the best films I saw in 2008.  I don't recall hearing any profanity, and surprisingly there was no gratuitous violence.  If a Holocaust movie could possibly be a family movie as well, then this was one.  But take care, for this was also the most thought-provoking movie I saw in 2008.",4,Winner of the 2008 Cinematic Paradox Award,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,2521,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'trusted', 'choosing', 'family', 'after-Christmas', 'movie', 'again', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'sad', 'tones', 'sad', 'themes', 'given', 'was', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'child', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'palatable', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'probably', 'was', 'child', 'point', 'view', 'ending', 'was', 'anything', 'palatable', 'was', 'dark', 'terrible', 'even', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'standards.The', 'story', 'young', 'son', 'concentration', 'camp', 'commandant', 'who', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'age', 'other', 'side', 'wire', 'may', 'sound', 'bit', 'implausible', 'die-hard', 'history', 'buffs', 'definitely', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'so', 'viewer', 'reader', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'out.What', 'surprised', 'most', 'BOY', 'IN', 'THE', 'STRIPED', 'PAJAMAS', 'was', 'light-hearted', 'sometimes', 'even', 'downright', 'humorous', 'moments', 'great', 'paradox', 'find', 'oneself', 'chuckling', 'light', 'scene', 'only', 'be', 'suddenly', 'jolted', 'one', 'humor', 'mere', 'second', 'two', 'later', 'brought', 'back', 'reality', 'what', 'film', 'about.The', 'acting', 'cast', 'members', 'superb', 'especially', 'two', 'principal', 'boy', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Bruno', '8-year-old', 'son', 'Nazi', 'commandant', 'Shmuel', 'pronounced', 'SHMOLL', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'who', 'prisoner', 'Bruno', 'father', 'concentration', 'camp', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'far', 'most', 'adult', 'movie', 'stars', 'industry', 'today.The', 'primary', 'problem', 'have', 'STRIPED', 'PAJAMAS', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'meant', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'adults', 'most', 'adults', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'more', 'realistic', 'realistic', 'simply', 'mean', 'terms', 'graphic', 'content', 'portrayal', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'certainly', 'violent', 'virtually', 'violence', 'off-screen', 'implied', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'shocking', 'audience', 'more', 'what', 'not', 'seen', 'what', 'seen', 'Especially', 'end', 'target', 'audience', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'child', 'mine', 'watch', 'were', 'least', '11', '12', 'years', 'age', 'were', 'able', 'handle', 'kind', 'subject', 'matter.Overall', 'STRIPED', 'PAJAMAS', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'saw', '2008', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'hearing', 'profanity', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'family', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'was', 'one', 'take', 'care', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'saw', '2008']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

Dont read if you dont want me to mess up the ending.First of all I thought the movie was very well written and it kept me emotionally and mentally involved throughout. It is a very thought provoking and an easy movie to watch.... until the end! The character development was done very well. I truely grew to care about each main character in different ways. Both parents and both boys were perfect for their parts. Great character development was a strenght but also a weakness. Since I grew to care about the characters, the ending was too much for me to handle. I hated that last scene!!! I'll never watch this movie EVER again.

1218764,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B001N26GFM,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","So far, I've only viewed this riveting film twice.But it doesn't take too many viewings to evoke much commentary on this memorable historical drama.Based on the book of the same name by John Boyne, it deals with the story of young Bruno (whose wide-blue-eyed innocence is played outstandingly by young Asa Butterfield), the eight-year-old son of a member of the German High Command (David Thewlis)in World War II Berlin.We meet Bruno and his family as they learn they are to move to Poland due to the promotion of Bruno's father.The young boy frolics with his friends in the streets, oblivious to people being rounded up and herded into cattle cars around them. His beautiful, amiable mother(Vera Farmiga) arrives home from an outing, while his sister, Gretl(Amber Beattie) plays with dolls in her room.The children of priviledge soon present themselves downstairs at a party celebrating their father's promotion. In contrast to their grandfather's (Richard Johnson) support of the Third Reich, their grandmother's (Sheila Hancock) apprehension about its policies is noted on this occasion.Once in Poland, Bruno finds himself without any friends, and forbidden to explore certain parts of the new residence.Soon, he sneaks out anyway, and encounters the mysterious ""farm"" he was able to see from his bedroom window before it was boarded up.He encounters a young boy in striped pajamas named Schmuel(Jack Scanlon)and begins to converse with him, gradually beginning to empathize with his plight.At home, he sees the Nazi Lieutenant Kotler(Rupert Friend), amusing his sister, and brutalizing a Jewish servant named Pavel (David Hayman, who was previously in another WWII flick, ""Hope and Glory""), and is curious as to why no one objects to this behavior.Over time, as they receive the standard indoctrination from their tutor, Herr  Liszt (Jim Norton), and Gretel becomes a hard-core little Bundist, forsaking her dolls and assuming what she considers to be more appropriate duties in the wake of the Fatherland's plight, while her brother, who seems to have his mother's gentler nature, is more reluctant to accept indoctrination.He still visits Schmuel at the edge of the fence whenever possible, occasionally taking him food, passing him his soccer ball, or indulging in a game of checkers, allowing the incarcerated lad to call the moves from his side of the fence.The joy and innocence of these two boys shines amid the horror.A bombing claims the life of Bruno's ailing grandmother, and Bruno discusses her funeral with his friend.There is an unfortunate moment of betrayal when the sadistic Lieutenant Kotler, perhaps striving to prove his loyalty to the Reich, especially when it becomes known that his father does not support it, catches the two boys together, as Schmuel(who has replaced the murdered Pavel) was cleaning glassware in Bruno's house, and Bruno denies having given Schmuel the sweets he was caught with.But Bruno will find a way to reconcile with his friend, in a devastatingly heroic  way that reveals his parents' ultimate failure to shield him from the goings-on, and reveals how terrible poetic justice can be.The last scene of two boys together is one of them clinging to each other among a forest of emaciated adults, looking upward with still-wide-eyed innocence, still believing in the best...While there have been complaints about historical accuracy, this is a tale of painful sweetness with a tug at the heartstrings that has the strength of a child's pull, and a reminder of how we may condemn those we love the best with our own hatreds.",5,Innocence Condemned,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,3572,"['So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'only',

1218768,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001N26GFM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 11]","Powerful, innocent and absolutely tragic!  `THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS' is simply an amazing film.The film focuses on a family of four focusing on the youngest, Bruno (Asa Butterfield), a naive young eight-year-old who loves playing ""airplanes"" with his friends.  But he learns that his father, a high ranking Nazi officer is being moved to a new area (to oversee a Jewish concentration camp) and thus it will be a start of a new life for Bruno and his family.For Bruno's father (played by David Thewlis), the man does his job for their thinking of a better world and thus massacring the Jews.  Bruno's grandfather (Richard Johnson) is supportive and proud of his dad but his grandmother (Sheila Hacock) feels shame for his son.  Of course, that is the first major secret the family has kept (any German who objects to the Nazi way of thinking would be incarcerated or would be branded a traitor).But the family begins their new life in their new home.  With armed guards and a Jewish slave/helper named Pavel, the family tries to get accustomed to their new surroundings.  Of course, Bruno is not to thrilled because he has no friends around him but outside his bedroom window, he sees a farm (actually, the concentration camp) and wonders why everyone is wearing striped pajamas.His mother (Vera Farmiga) is shocked that they have moved not far from a concentration camp.  She thought they would be many miles away not right near it.  Meanwhile, Bruno's sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) who was a young daughter at 12-years-old fascinated with dolls, suddenly becomes fascinated with the young Nazi soldier who is a driver for the family.But as much as his parents have told him to not look towards the ""farm"", Bruno runs off towards what he thinks is a farm and he sees a young boy sitting near the electric wired fence.  The boy is named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon).  Bruno is just happy to find someone young that he can play with but doesn't understand why he wears pajamas or can't play.  Shmuel is also naive himself.  He knows that he must follow the rules in the concentration camp but he sits in the corner behind a rock to be alone.The two become friends and Bruno eventually comes to visit him everyday with food and so he can play games or talk with him.Throughout the course of the film, we see Bruno, who doesn't fully understand the war and when he wants to read adventure books, his instructor teaches him about being proud to be Nazi and why he should despite the Jewish people.This is where Bruno is confused because the servant named Pavel seems like a nice guy, Shmuel seems like a nice guy but his teacher tells him that there are no good Jewish people and if he ever found one, he would be a great explorer.In the air outside the home, there is a putrid stench and sure enough Bruno's mother finds out from one of the soldiers that the smell is the cremation of Jewish people.  She is just in awe of how terrible they are being treated and thus leads to problems between her and her husband.  Her husband is doing his job but for Bruno's mother, she can't believe they are living near a concentration camp.In one scene, the family witnesses during dinner time, Pavel accidentally spills wine on the table and literally taken to another room and kicked to death.This pushes Bruno's mother even more to the edge now because  she has to witness the brutalization of Jewish people in her home.  Of course, Bruno is naive and not knowing what happened to Pavel.Next thing you know, Pavel is replaced by Shmuel.  Bruno is so happy to have his friend now at his home and his friend looks so hungry, Bruno gives him some food.  But unfortunately, a Nazi soldier catches them and when Bruno is yelled at and asked how the Jewish boy got the food, in fear, Bruno tells the soldier that Shmuel stole it and thus Shmuel is taken in for punishment.Because of his lie, Bruno knows he did something very bad and now his friend has gotten hurt.  But being a friend, Bruno wants to make it up to Shmuel.""THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS"" deals with Bruno's naiveness but yet his friendship with Shmuel, his sister's transformation to a girl who liked to play with dolls to a loyal believer in Hitler and the Nazis but also seeing how his mother's conscience starts to eat her up and knowing what her husband is in charge of and that they are living near a death camp and seeing how the Jewish people are treated.""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMES"" is powerful and moving film but very tragic.VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is presented in Widescreen (1:85:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  Video quality on this DVD is pretty good as you do get a sense of color during the outdoor scenes and good lighting and set design as well.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with the film being primarily a dialogue film that comes clear on your front channel speakers.  Music is used to show emotion of a scene and is utilized quite well.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are three special features included on the DVD for ""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS"". Included are:* Deleted Scenes (With Optional Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Herman and Author John Boyne) - About five deleted scenes with commentary.  Most of the cuts were made early in the film.* Friendship Beyond the Fence Featurette - A featurette featuring  interviews with the director and the cast of the film.  Comments on how talented Asa Butterfield was as a young actor and playing Bruno.  Each talked about their character and working with each other, asking Asa Butterfield (Bruno) and Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) about their knowledge of the Holocaust and even having to remake one of the Nazi propaganda films of Jewish enjoying the concentration camps which was used in the film.* Feature Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Herman and Author John Boyne - Both discuss the film and talk about the talent, the characters and differences between the film and the book.  Certain shots and the emotions that the director wanted to capture on screen.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that with a Holocaust film involving children, I wasn't sure where this story was going.  But by the film's end and the final wide shot, I was just amazed by the film and yet saddened by how tragic the film ended.I was really moved by the film and the various performances. I was very amazed by Asa Butterfield's performance as Bruno and because he was naive and really didn't care about how the Nazi's felt about the Jews, he was able to have this friendship with Shmuel.  Jack Scanlon's Shmuel was also another performance that was well done and you had this sense of sadness in the child's eyes.Vera Farmiga's performance as his mother was well-done and seeing how she started out as this strong woman, good mother and proud wife of a high ranking Nazi officer but then seeing her evolve when she discovers the atrocities and having to live nearby and having to bare with death near her home and having to lie to her children of what is happening.But what was innocent for the most part of the film really shocks you at what happens at the end of the film.  I was shocked of how it ended and I'll just leave it at that.Very good costume and set design and really good cinematography by Benoit Delhomme.  The screenplay was well-written, emotions well captured on film and each talent did a great job in portraying their character.Everything was well done in this film.A powerful and moving film, ""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS"" is a film that deserves to watched.  It's not a film about the Holocaust with guns ablazing, it's a film that shows the cruelty of that time but focusing on an eight-year-old boy who knows not of what is going on around him, not knowing why the Nazi's hate the Jewish people but being optimistic that once the war is over, he and Shmuel can finally play together.  Naive to know that the ""farm"" where he thinks Shmuel and others are having fun in is actually a concentration camp where many people are being massacred. And it's the naivety of both children, not knowing how dangerous things are but knowing that their friendship is real that sets up the final part of the film.""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS"" is highly recommended!",5,"Powerful, innocent and absolutely tragic!",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,8195,"['Powerful', 'innocent', 'absolutely', 'tragic', 'BOY', 'IN', 'THE', 'STRIPED', 'PAJAMAS',

1218769,A20Q4HD6A2B8W9,B001N26GFM,Dennis Brandt,"[1, 1]","Much has been about this film here, mostly pro, some con.  I can only add my opinion that it was a marvelous and riveting film that every kid in the world should watch.  Yes, at times it seemed hard to believe that these two boys, so marvelously acted by Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, could have been so naive.  But they were just eight years old living through something that the rest of the world had not imagined until after they discovered the truth.  If the film is not totally true to history (and I am not commenting on its historical accuracy one way or the other), it nonetheless makes a marvelous story. The ending is a stunner and completely unexpected.  This is a film that, with some preparation, you can show to your pre-teen:  no foul language, no sex, and no in-your-face violence even though the story is set in the most violent era in world history.As to those critics who heap vituperation on this film because they deny the holocaust occurred, I can only say things to them that would get this review deleted.  I will only say that my father helped liberate a concentration camp, and he did not imagine what he saw.  He did, however, have difficulty discussing it even years later.My one criticism is why the producers did not include the deleted scenes they present on the DVD.  The movie is barely 1:30 long.  These scenes, all short, would have added little length to the film and would have clarified some issues.  When, for example, I saw the pile of dolls in the basement, I did conclude they were Gretel's, a fact one of the deleted scenes would have explained.  One of them also explains why Bruno, once denied permission to go into the back garden at all, was able to do so with impunity.  We also learn where he got the idea of the extermination camp being a ""farm.""",5,A poignant and tragic film,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,1800,"['Much', 'been', 'film', 'here', 'mostly', 'pro', 'con', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'opinion', 'was', 'marvelous', 'riveting', 'film', 'kid', 'world', 'should', 'watch', 'Yes', 'times', 'seemed', 'hard', 'believe', 'two', 'boys', 'so', 'marvelously', 'acted', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Jack', 'Scanlon', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'naive', 'were', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'living', 'something', 'rest', 'world', 'had', 'not', 'imagined', 'discovered', 'truth', 'film', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'history', 'am', 'not', 'commenting', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'nonetheless', 'marvelous', 'story', 'ending', 'stunner', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'film', 'preparation', 'can', 'show', 'pre-teen', 'foul', 'language', 'sex', 'in-your-face', 'violence', 'even', 'story', 'set', 'most', 'violent', 'era', 'world', 'history.As', 'critics', 'who', 'heap', 'vituperation', 'film', 'deny', 'holocaust', 'occurred', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'things', 'would', 'get', 'review', 'deleted', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'father', 'helped', 'liberate', 'concentration', 'camp', 'did', 'not', 'imagine', 'what', 'saw', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'difficulty', 'discussing', 'even', 'years', 'later.My', 'one', 'criticism', 'why', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'present', 'DVD', 'movie', 'barely', '1:30', 'long', 'scenes', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'little', 'length', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'clarified', 'issues', 'When', 'example', 'saw', 'pile', 'dolls', 'basement', 'did', 'conclude', 'were', 'Gretel', 'fact', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'explained', 'One', 'also', 'why', 'Bruno', 'once', 'denied', 'permission', 'go', 'back', 'garden', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'impunity', 'also', 'learn', 'where', 'got', 'idea', 'extermination', 'camp', 'being', 'farm']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1218770,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001N26GFM,Dexter Manning,"[31, 53]","Over the course of film history, both in the United States and abroad, numerous films have been made which relate, in some way, directly or indirectly, to some aspect of the Holocaust, among the darkest periods of any century and of human existence. They include those that have a popularity that transcend the subgenre and rise to become classics in a general sense: ""Exodus,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Schindler's List."" Many of them involve the young in some way but there's a body of work that focus chiefly on young victims who find themselves caught in some aspect of the genocide. This decade alone has seen more than a few such films, whether they are Jewish children who are forced to endure unspeakable barbarism (""Fateless"") or young-adult Germans with the courage to take a stand against the atrocities of their leaders (""Sophie Scholl: the Final Days"").""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is the latest such movie to premiere. From the United Kingdom, it is directed by Mark Herman from a screenplay Herman wrote, basing it on a novel by John Boyne. The story, experienced mostly from the perspective of children, concerns a lonely eight-year-old boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) newly relocated to the German countryside from Berlin, who befriends another boy his same age, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). They like each other, find they have much in common, and want to play with each other every day. But they're separated by a tall barbed wire fence that courses with electricity. After all, despite their similarities, there is one irreconcilable difference: Shmuel is a Jew and that fence hems him into the grim concentration camp to which he and his family have been sent. Bruno, meanwhile, maintains his freedom with a family headed by his father, a captain who moved them to the country when he was promoted. His new job: run the concentration camp. Visible on a distant horizon from Bruno's new room, the ""farm,"" as the child initially mistakes it for, is tended to by numerous ""farmers"" who wear the titular ""striped pajamas"" (really, uniforms with numbers); Shmuel is but one of hundreds of them.A large part of the story, generally filmed by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme in muted tones, with especially drab grays for the camp and its workers, concerns Bruno's gradual discovery of the senseless hatred people can harbor against one another for no good reason. Unlike his older sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), he is relatively slow to absorb the lessons of the tutor his father hired, lessons that purport to justify why his father's work is for the benefit of their country. Bruno, by his own admission an ""explorer,"" much prefers to read his fantasy and adventure books over the anti-Semitic tomb of a book his teacher assigns him to read. Another concern of the movie is the infuriating class differences inherent in such systems, as, for example, the monstrous treatment imposed on the Jewish Pavel (David Hayman), formerly a doctor, now a worker in the camp and servant in Bruno's well-to-do household.But perhaps the most important concern of the story is naivet&eacute;. Not simply childhood naivet&eacute; but the childlike version in adults. It is this that is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the picture, but its most problematic. It manifests itself here in Bruno's initial perception of the ""farm"" and the workers in their striped PJs, which is one thing. More sadly, but less believably, it also is reflected in the fact that the depth of the systemic hatred and lack of humanity in Bruno's father (David Thewlis), not to mention the dark details of his new job, barely register at first with Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), an innocent, then concerned, then indignant woman with some shreds of humanity that she fails to act upon until she sees her children become too exposed to the cruel philosophies and actions of their father and his henchmen.As the story progresses, the level of ignorance of the two boys at its center regarding the circumstances that envelop them becomes less and less plausible, especially considering that they each witness and experience some of the abuse of the soldiers first-hand. Late into the film, Bruno has seen some of the rougher side of his father, yet, when asked by Shmuel if he is proud of his father, Bruno responds in the affirmative with seemingly a minimum of hesitation. Further, Bruno seems to have little if any doubts about his family, even in the face of his sister's rapidly increasing phobia, militancy, and hatred. Most profoundly, despite the fact that Shmuel himself toils in the camp, he does not even come close to suspecting that the explanations he is given about his and his parents' predicament, why he was transported there, and why people in the compound keep mysteriously disappearing may be weak attempts to mask something that is wrong. It's nearly impossible to accept that, when he realizes his own father is missing, he starts searching the camp for him, oblivious to the notion, despite where he is, that he may have been murdered. It isn't until the final, waning minutes in the film, when the boys--Bruno especially, but to an extent even Shmuel--begin to better comprehend the wickedness of the camp. These may be kids, but I doubt real children in similar circumstances would be as clueless as the film assumes they would be, no matter at which side of the fence the sit.The basic conceit of the film is certainly engaging and there are many scenes that are memorable for their drama, tension, and horror, but, in its realization, the filmmakers attribute so much permanence to childhood innocence that much of the story's credibility is undermined. They assume that such innocence can continue to survive, will not erode, even under circumstances as difficult and raw as these.",2,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas: A Review.,1233187200,"01 29,

1218772,A26D5IRV2OLU4B,B001N26GFM,D. Munro,"[2, 2]","Prepare yourself: you will need tissues for this one.  This is a Holocaust movie with sufficient realism to remind the viewer that this horror did in fact happen.  Definitely NOT a movie for the younger kids.This film took the various views of the Holocaust during that time. It is through an eight-year-old boy, Bruno, that we see events unfold. Bruno's father, Ralf, is a Nazi soldier, a highly ranked one at that.  Bruno's grandfather is proud of his son's position in the German military, convinced that his son is ""making history.""  Bruno's grandmother is a German citizen who opposes Hitler's views, much to the chagrin of her own son.  And Bruno's mother is a society wife, who at the beginning of the film is concerned only with her own family and their secular German life.  At the beginning, you see these four points of view and how sheltered Bruno has been -- politics isn't discussed in front of the children, so Bruno and his older sister Gretel have a cheerfully ignorant childhood.When Ralf is promoted, he brings his wife and children away from Berlin  to a ""house in the country."" Bruno hates this move until he peeks out of the window and discovers a ""farm"" a ways away.  He wonders aloud why the farmers wear their pajamas all day long.  Bruno's questions are ignored.  He asks his father what the funny smell is coming from the chimneys far away ... and his father dismisses it gruffly, saying, ""They burn rubbish over there.""  Bruno wonders how the nice man -- Pavel -- who peels potatoes knew how to treat his wound after a bad fall.  Pavel tells him that he ""used to practice as a doctor before ... coming here.""  Pavel doesn't tell the young boy what is going on, that he's Jewish ... or that the ""farm"" is really a concentration camp.An exploring Bruno discovers a boy named Shmuel (pronounced ""Shmall"") who's his exact age, sitting on the ""farm""/camp side of a barbed wire fence in striped pajamas. When Bruno asks his new friend why he's wearing pajamas with numbers, if it's part of a game, he is quickly informed that soldiers took his other clothes away and that it is not a game.  ""I don't much care for soldiers, do you?"" Shmuel asks.  Bruno tells him, ""I do.  My father's a soldier -- but not the kind that takes people's clothes away.""  Bruno asks why there is barbed wire, wondering aloud if it's to keep animals from getting out.  Shmuel explains that it's to keep people from getting out.  When Bruno presses the matter, his friend explains just why -- Shmuel is a Jew.Bruno and Shmuel become good friends, despite their different backgrounds and situations.  In one critical moment, he makes a mistake he immediately regrets and seeks to correct it somehow for his friend.  For Shmuel, he will right the wrong ... no matter what.  Without hesitation, the boys make a pact ... one made in innocence and friendship. The two young actors that played Bruno and Shmuel were great, both with expressive eyes and good delivery on every line.  David Thewlis (Lupin from the ""Harry Potter"" films) is excellent as Bruno's father in this movie, especially in the movie's poignant final scenes ... a great job in a very complicated role.At the end, my jaw dropped and I had tears in my eyes.  I doubt I would add this to my own collection (I borrowed this), but I can say that I do not regret seeing it.  The ending is both staggering and chilling, the final shot of the film is poignant in its realism.

1218774,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B001N26GFM,Doug Erlandson,"[2, 2]","&#34;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&#34; is atypical of a holocaust film in that it is told primarily through the eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a German soldier. When we first meet Bruno and his family, they are living a seemingly happy life in Berlin. However, when Bruno's father receives a promotion, they move to a farm in the countryside, next to what we soon discover is a concentration camp. His father has been chosen as commandant of that camp.Unlike in Berlin, where Bruno had multiple playmates and was free to run around with them, in the country he is alone (except for his family) and confined to their yard. However, a born adventurer, he finds a way to escape his yard and is soon at the perimeter of the concentration camp, where he meets a youth of his age, a boy who (as Bruno sees it) wears striped pajamas.The film does an extremely effective job of showing us this segment of the world through the eyes and thought-patterns of an eight-year-old child, a child who wants to believe that his father is a good man, even a hero, but who can't quite square this with what he sees, as he witnesses the &#34;farmers&#34; on the other side of the fence working in their &#34;pajamas,&#34; as he watches the smoke from the chimneys inside the camp and smells the putrid odor they give off, and as he learns from his &#34;playmate&#34; about the people in the camp who have mysteriously disappeared.Even in his home he receives conflicting messages. His father and mother both show love and affection to him; yet, his father and the solider boyfriend of his older sister treat with contempt the Jewish concentration-camp inmate who must work long hours for them while having almost nothing to eat, and who is severely beaten for the smallest infraction.To the end, Bruno seemingly ignores the obvious, or, perhaps better put, tries to square the discordant data with a positive assessment of the life of the people on the other side of the fence, including the boy in the striped pajamas. Even though Bruno is just eight years old, one might wonder how he could continue to turn a blind eye toward the unmistakable horror of what is going on. In a sense, Bruno becomes a metaphor for the German people of the Nazi era, many of whom ignored as best they could what was happening and reinterpreted the data in a way that permitted them to claim ignorance.",5,A truly gripping film,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,2376,"['34', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', '34', 'atypical', 'holocaust', 'film', 'told', 'primarily', 'eyes', 'Bruno', 'eight-year-old', 'son', 'German', 'soldier', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'Bruno', 'family', 'are', 'living', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'life', 'Berlin', 'However', 'when', 'Bruno', 'father', 'promotion', 'move', 'farm', 'countryside', 'next', 'what', 'soon', 'discover', 'concentration', 'camp', 'father', 'been', 'chosen', 'commandant', 'camp.Unlike', 'Berlin', 'where', 'Bruno', 'had', 'multiple', 'playmates', 'was', 'free', 'run', 'around', 'country', 'alone', 'family', 'confined', 'yard', 'However', 'born', 'adventurer', 'way', 'escape', 'yard', 'soon', 'perimeter', 'concentration', 'camp', 'where', 'youth', 'age', 'boy', 'who', 'Bruno', 'striped', 'pajamas.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'effective', 'job', 'showing', 'segment', 'world', 'eyes', 'thought-patterns', 'eight-year-old', 'child', 'child', 'who', 'believe', 'father', 'good', 'man', 'even', 'hero', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'square', 'what', '34', 'farmers', '34', 'other', 'side', 'fence', 'working', '34', 'pajamas', '34', 'smoke', 'chimneys', 'camp', 'putrid', 'odor', 'give', 'off', '34', 'playmate', '34', 'people', 'camp', 'who', 'have', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared.Even', 'home', 'conflicting', 'messages', 'father', 'mother', 'show', 'love', 'affection', 'yet', 'father', 'solider', 'boyfriend', 'older', 'sister', 'treat', 'contempt', 'Jewish', 'concentration-camp', 'inmate', 'who', 'must', 'work', 'long', 'hours', 'having', 'almost', 'nothing', 'eat', 'who', 'severely', 'beaten', 'smallest', 'infraction.To', 'end', 'Bruno', 'seemingly', 'obvious', 'perhaps', 'better', 'put', 'tries', 'square', 'discordant', 'data', 'positive', 'assessment', 'life', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'fence', 'including', 'boy', 'striped', 'pajamas', 'Even', 'Bruno', 'just', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'continue', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'unmistakable', 'horror', 'what', 'going', 'sense', 'Bruno', 'metaphor', 'German', 'people', 'Nazi', 'era', 'many', 'whom', 'ignored', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'reinterpreted', 'data', 'way', 'permitted', 'claim', 'ignorance']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

1218778,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001N26GFM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","This will not be a tiring, witty or clever piece. I LOVE this film, which makes me weep every time I see it. That is primarily because of the hugely talented little Jack Scanlon, who plays the Polish boy of the title, little Shmuel of the concentration camp. How the title character gets shoved down in the credits in some listings is beyond me (he got good billing in the film credits, but those were in order of appearance, which I always think is a totally unfair credit-listing).This is the story of an unnamed NAZI commander (David Thewlis) who moves his family from Berlin to God-knows-where...but it is an art nouveau house situated right next to the edges of a concentration camp. His youngest, a son named Bruno (Asa Butterfield who gets far too much attention by the way) wanders off one day and meets the little boy in the striped pajamas, makes pals, and the saddest film in many a decade is off and running.Little Bruno and little Shmuel, both eight, hit it off famously. Bruno is a surprisingly dense and seemingly very slow young boy--he cannot get it out of his head that the Jews in the camp are farmers, and that they are having the time of their lives. Yes, Bruno's dad is a highfalutin NAZI and Bruno's heard the politprop, but he still seems to be in the dark at the end of the film. Other than how difficult it is to believe that an 8-year-old boy can remain so naive, this film is a most exquisite, powerful piece that will have the entire house in tears.Friendship. Innocence. Sweetness. Death. It's all here in force. I cannot emphasize Jack Scanlon's powerful influence in this film...it might not have worked so well if another boy had played this role.

I honestly don't think she would be able to stomach watching this film as it would be more traumatic than most of the footage from the Holocaust and other films we have seen. because she lost her childhood and innocence and lived through the war as one so young, I believe this would simply be too much for her. but not for the rest of us. I'd never even heard of this story, the book or the movie. it came up randomly on my list of recommendations and my cat accidentally pressed the play button with his paw as I was about to watch something else (I often find WWII movies completely cliche and poorly portrayed) I'm pretty sure I was *meant* to watch this beautiful movie. ALL of the cast and supporting actors were superb. Vera Farmiga as the mom was just a joy to watch. clearly Bruno was his mother's son while Gretel was her father's daughter, down to their physical characteristics I felt that was made quite clear from the start.this movie is wonderful on so many levels, aside from the eloquent story it is quite amazing down to the last detail. having grown up in Eastern Europe I can say that I felt quite 'at home' with the chosen location and small details. I was very happy to see the story juxtaposed against every day life of the German family who lived comfortably, ate and dressed well and the like while mere miles away people were undergoing unspeakable horrors. as to the criticism of the boys naivete, I can understand but feel that people are dwelling on this in a manner that shows their own lack of understanding and cynicism. how can an 8 year old possibly comprehend such things? I was younger than that when my family had to sit me down and explain that I was a jew. what they said made absolutely no sense (even though I knew I was different) kids were of course propagandized and taught every form of anti-semitism from a young age, but this varied from place to place, family to family. some kids played together with no real strife or tension until the war escalated. kids were not walking around with iPads and smart phones, tweeting to their friends or playing with their Xbox. those kids were beautifully naive and innocent compared to many of our children who take the stance of a young adult before they understand anything whatsoever.lastly, everyone who sees this film needs to picture millions of Shmuels (that child actor's face was so painfully honest and real) these were people from every corner of europe, with extended families. think of all the mothers and fathers of all the Shmuels who were tortured and sacrificed...for nothing. think of the Polish, german, hungarian and other citizens going about their daily lives while jews lived in filth, beaten and murdered daily. this movie encapsulates all of that and so much more.",5,WOW.,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2982,"['grandmother', 'saw', 'parents', 'many', 'others', 'lined', 'up', 'shot', 'Nazi', 'death', 'squad', 'course', 'thought', 'whole', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'only', 'little', 'girl', 'same', 'age', 'Shmuel', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'stomach', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'traumatic', 'most', 'footage', 'Holocaust', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'lost', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'lived', 'war', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'believe', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'rest', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'story', 'book', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'randomly', 'list', 'recommendations', 'cat', 'accidentally', 'pressed', 'play', 'button', 'paw', 'was', 'about', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'often', 'find', 'WWII', 'movies', 'completely', 'cliche', 'poorly', 'portrayed', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', '*meant*', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'mom', 'was', 'just', 'joy', 'watch', 'clearly', 'Bruno', 'was', 'mother', 'son', 'Gretel', 'was', 'father', 'daughter', 'down', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'felt', 'was', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'start.this', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'aside', 'eloquent', 'story', 'quite', 'amazing', 'down', 'last', 'detail', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'can', 'say', 'felt', 'quite', ""'at"", 'home', 'chosen', 'location', 'small', 'details', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'story', 'juxtaposed', 'day', 'life', 'German', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'comfortably', 'ate', 'dressed', 'well', 'like', 'while', 'mere', 'miles', 'away', 'people', 'were', 'undergoing', 'unspeakable', 'horrors', 'criticism', 'boys', 'naivete', 'can', 'understand', 'feel', 'people', 'are', 'dwelling', 'manner', 'own', 'lack', 'understanding', 'cynicism', 'how', 'can', '8', 'year', 'old', 'possibly', 'comprehend', 'such', 'things', 'was', 'younger', 'when', 'family', 'had', 'sit', 'down', 'explain', 'was', 'jew', 'what', 'said', 'made', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'different', 'kids', 'were', 'course', 'propagandized', 'taught', 'form', 'anti-semitism', 'young', 'age', 'varied', 'place', 'place', 'family', 'family', 'kids', 'played', 'together', 'real', 'strife', 'tension', 'war', 'escalated', 'kids', 'were', 'not', 'walking', 'iPads', 'smart', 'phones', 'tweeting', 'friends', 'playing', 'Xbox', 'kids', 'were', 'beautifully', 'naive', 'innocent', 'compared', 'many', 'children', 'who', 'take', 'stance', 'young', 'adult', 'understand', 'anything', 'whatsoever.lastly', 'everyone', 'who', 'film', 'picture', 'millions', 'Shmuels', 'child', 'actor', 'face', 'was', 'so', 'painfully', 'honest', 'real', 'were', 'people', 'corner', 'europe', 'extended', 'families', 'think', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'Shmuels', 'who', 'were', 'tortured', 'sacrificed', 'nothing', 'think', 'Polish', 'german', 'hungarian', 'other', 'citizens', 'going', 'daily', 'lives', 'jews', 'lived', 'filth', 'beaten', 'murdered', 'daily', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

We've visited a concentration camp in Austria and still get chills remembering the gas chambers and quarry.The story is simple on the surface, yet full of ethical and emotional complexity. When a Nazi family moves from the big city so that the promoted father can help oversee a prison camp, his young son, Bruno, is unaware of the harsh realities involved. From sheer boredom, Bruno leaves the home's confines and discovers an electric barbed-wire fence at which he forms a friendship with the boy in the striped pajamas. This leads to some nice explorations of race and prejudice, as well as a harrowing example of innocence lost in hopes of strengthening a friendship.The story's ending is cause for discussion and controversy, but I was already struggling to appreciate the movie before this. Not only do the Nazis all have strong British accents, they also speak with British slang at points, even saying ""by miles"" when kilometers are the continental standard. I was willing to get past this due to the strong acting, but the physical landscape was also not German in appearance. I've spent months in Germany, and this looked nothing like the regions I visited--lacked pine trees, cliffs, mountains--and even the city at the beginning looks nothing like Berlin.With accents and scenery already breaking some of the magic for me, I was further distracted by the seeming freedom the boys had to chat at will along the fence. Despite one guard tower visible in the distance, no one seems to notice the intruder or the absent prisoner. In ""Life is Beautiful,"" a distinct fable-like quality allowed such things to work, but here I felt only duped and emotionally manipulated.The photography and acting were well done, the script had some nice moments of dialogue, but I was on the fence throughout, wanting to like it while finding too many sources of distraction.",3,3 1/2 Stars...On the Fence,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,1991,"['big', 'fans', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'other', 'fine', 'WWII', 'movies', 'family', 'watched', 'film', 'high', 'expectations', ""'ve"", 'visited', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Austria', 'still', 'get', 'chills', 'remembering', 'gas', 'chambers', 'quarry.The', 'story', 'simple', 'surface', 'full', 'ethical', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'When', 'Nazi', 'family', 'moves', 'big', 'city', 'so', 'promoted', 'father', 'can', 'help', 'oversee', 'prison', 'camp', 'young', 'son', 'Bruno', 'unaware', 'harsh', 'realities', 'involved', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'Bruno', 'home', 'confines', 'discovers', 'electric', 'barbed-wire', 'fence', 'friendship', 'boy', 'striped', 'pajamas', 'nice', 'explorations', 'race', 'prejudice', 'as', 'well', 'harrowing', 'example', 'innocence', 'lost', 'hopes', 'strengthening', 'friendship.The', 'story', 'ending', 'cause', 'discussion', 'controversy', 'was', 'already', 'struggling', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'Nazis', 'have', 'strong', 'British', 'accents', 'also', 'speak', 'British', 'slang', 'points', 'even', 'saying', 'miles', 'when', 'kilometers', 'are', 'continental', 'standard', 'was', 'willing', 'get', 'due', 'strong', 'acting', 'physical', 'landscape', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'German', 'appearance', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'months', 'Germany', 'looked', 'nothing', 'regions', 'visited', 'lacked', 'pine', 'trees', 'cliffs', 'mountains', 'even', 'city', 'beginning', 'nothing', 'Berlin.With', 'accents', 'scenery', 'already', 'breaking', 'magic', 'was', 'further', 'distracted', 'seeming', 'freedom', 'boys', 'had', 'chat', 'will', 'along', 'fence', 'one', 'guard', 'tower', 'visible', 'distance', 'one', 'notice', 'intruder', 'absent', 'prisoner', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'distinct', 'fable-like', 'quality', 'allowed', 'such', 'things', 'work', 'here', 'felt', 'only', 'duped', 'emotionally', 'manipulated.The', 'photography', 'acting', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'script', 'had', 'nice', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'was', 'fence', 'wanting', 'like', 'finding', 'too', 'many', 'sources', 'distraction']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1218785,A283JVPUGXOFAZ,B001N26GFM,Ermite,"[3, 3]","Certainly, there are some professional critics who will show-off clever epithets when they review this film.  Their smart-aleck comments might be something like ""See what happens to naughty little boys who disobey their parents?"" or, ""Curiosity killed the cat.""  There are some critics who opine that this film disserves the Holocaust.  Look, just avoid them, and see the film.Such comments like those are unfair to the film, which hits the right note in its simplicity.  There are many directors who would've blown it way out of proportion.  Some commentators have criticized the actors' British dialects.  The use of dialects is part of the actor's craft.  However, I find the director's decision not to use German dialect appropriate.I saw the movie in limited release without foreknowledge of the plot or the storyline.  I found it a haunting story that lingers in the mind.  The audience, with whom I saw it, did not cheer, did not applaud, and did not cry; we were just numbed into silence by the power of the story.  We exited in silence.  That doesn't happen in movies too often.  I can see the faith the studio has in it.  But having seen it once, do I want to see it again?If viewed as a fable, and the book has won many awards, the story may be too simplistic.  The book was written for children, as if a child was to read the story, but it's marketed to young adults in high school, I think because of the story's power.  Using a fable to tell the story allows the author to take a step from reality.  Some have correctly commented upon the implausibility of the plot and events in the film.  Whether it was correct for the director to follow the book so closely, that is, telling an allegory or fairy tale (which cinema does poorly, as in the case of Spielberg's wonderful film, ""AI: Artificial Intelligence"" (2001)), is uncertain.  If the director had chosen to infect the film with some hard doses of reality, the film would have a different feel.Consider, Bruno, the major character.  In the book and film, he's an eight-year old boy who is innocent of all the storm and stress of Nazi Era Germany.  In reality, Bruno would've been in the Hitler Youth since he was six.  He would've been educated in the Nazi catechism of the time and not been such an innocent in search of a playmate.  If, for the sake of the movie, Bruno was in the Hitler Youth and been shown in uniform for a moment, let's say at the party in Berlin, it might have meant a stronger character arc for him, reminiscent of the film, ""Tomorrow the World"" (1944) that starred Skippy Homeier, who won an award for his portrayal of a Hitler Youth.  The storyline would not need to change; the plot would proceed like Teutonic clockwork toward the powerful coda.  But, perhaps that might've changed it too much, for the film relies on its simplicity.Consider, Shmeul, Bruno's acquaintance.  Shmeul's survival in the camp was very uncertain, but we know that children did survive.  We have recollections of those who were there.  At the end of the war, Allies had a terrific problem relocating the surviving children, as told in the film, ""The Search"" (1948).But, that's the difference between telling a fable intended for children (who've been shooed away by the rating) and a fable for adults who see the childishly simple metaphors at play.So, would I want to see this movie again?  Yes, I want to see it again, if I can afford it, and if I can get myself in the frame of mind again.  Do I recommend owning a copy of the video?  Yes.  I will, but not on Blu-ray.I think this is a story that tells the affect of the Holocaust and its lingering Hell on everyone connected with it then and ever since, and I think it will affect you, too.",5,A Powerful Story Simply Told,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,3716,"['Certainly', 'are', 'professional', 'critics', 'who', 'will', 'show-off', 'clever', 'epithets', 'when', 'review', 'film', 'smart-aleck', 'comments', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'See', 'what', 'naughty', 'little', 'boys', 'who', 'disobey', 'parents', 'Curiosity', 'killed', 'cat', 'are', 'critics', 'who', 'opine', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'Look', 'just', 'avoid', 'see', 'film.Such', 'comments', 'are', 'unfair', 'film', 'right', 'note', 'simplicity', 'are', 'many', 'directors', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'blown', 'way', 'proportion', 'commentators', 'have', 'criticized', 'actors', 'British', 'dialects', 'use', 'dialects', 'part', 'actor', 'craft', 'However', 'find', 'director', 'decision', 'not', 'use', 'German', 'dialect', 'appropriate.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'limited', 'release', 'foreknowledge', 'plot', 'storyline', 'found', 'haunting', 'story', 'lingers', 'mind', 'audience', 'whom', 'saw', 'did', 'not', 'cheer', 'did', 'not', 'applaud', 'did', 'not', 'cry', 'were', 'just', 'numbed', 'silence', 'power', 'story', 'exited', 'silence', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movies', 'too', 'often', 'can', 'see', 'faith', 'studio', 'having', 'seen', 'once', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'viewed', 'fable', 'book', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'simplistic', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'children', 'child', 'was', 'read', 'story', 'marketed', 'young', 'adults', 'high', 'school', 'think', 'story', 'power', 'Using', 'fable', 'tell', 'story', 'author', 'take', 'step', 'reality', 'have', 'correctly', 'commented', 'implausibility', 'plot', 'events', 'film', 'was', 'correct', 'director', 'follow', 'book', 'so', 'closely', 'telling', 'allegory', 'fairy', 'tale', 'cinema', 'poorly', 'case', 'Spielberg', 'wonderful', 'film', 'AI', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', '2001', 'uncertain', 'director', 'had', 'chosen', 'infect', 'film', 'hard', 'doses', 'reality', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'different', 'feel.Consider', 'Bruno', 'major', 'character', 'book', 'film', 'eight-year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'innocent', 'storm', 'stress', 'Nazi', 'Era', 'Germany', 'reality', 'Bruno', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'was', 'six', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'educated', 'Nazi', 'catechism', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'such', 'innocent', 'search', 'playmate', 'sake', 'movie', 'Bruno', 'was', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'been', 'shown', 'uniform', 'moment', 'let', 'say', 'party', 'Berlin', 'might', 'have', 'meant', 'stronger', 'character', 'arc', 'reminiscent', 'film', 'Tomorrow', 'World', '1944', 'starred', 'Skippy', 'Homeier', 'who', 'won', 'award', 'portrayal', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'storyline', 'would', 'not', 'need', 'change', 'plot', 'would', 'proceed', 'Teutonic', 'clockwork', 'powerful', 'coda', 'perhaps', 'might', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'relies', 'simplicity.Consider', 'Shmeul', 'Bruno', 'acquaintance', 'Shmeul', 'survival', 'camp', 'was', 'very', 'uncertain', 'know', 'children', 'did', 'survive', 'have', 'recollections', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'end', 'war', 'Allies', 'had', 'terrific', 'problem', 'relocating', 'surviving', 'children', 'told', 'film', 'Search', '1948', '.But', 'difference', 'telling', 'fable', 'intended', 'children', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shooed', 'away', 'rating', 'fable', 'adults', 'who', 'see', 'childishly', 'simple', 'metaphors', 'play.So', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'Yes', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'can', 'afford', 'can', 'get', 'frame', 'mind', 'again', 'Do', 'recommend', 'owning', 'copy', 'video', 'Yes', 'will', 'not', 'Blu-ray.I', 'think', 'story', 'affect', 'Holocaust', 'lingering', 'Hell', 'everyone', 'connected', 'then', 'ever', 'think', 'will', 'affect', 'too']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

Could you possibly make sense of this film if you knew nothing at all about the mass murder of Jews in Hitler's Germany and the lands that Germany occupied? I don't think so! Fortunately, there are few people that ignorant of history alive right now, although there are a vicious few who deny it. Clearly, this is a film not just about two boys but also about the species that labels itself scientifically as Homo sapiens -- ""Human knowing"".Having survived 60% of the Twentieth Century, I can testify that it was the most tragic on record. Yeah, yeah, we were born with higher life expectancies and we had shinier toys. But it was the century of mass murder, conducted by the polity that we had supposedly evolved to manage our savagery. The most extensive mass murders were generated by ideologies wrapped in racism and nationalism, and sometimes sheathed with phony science. Do I need to indict the murderers here? Nearly all of Europe, even including France, had temporary governments that helped Hitler murder Jews. Stalin's USSR murdered uncountable millions. Cambodia. Uganda. Rwanda. Chile. Argentina, El Salvador and more ... murderous governments. Those rabid denouncers of the national/federal government of the USA should take note: though racism and xenophobia and fanaticism thrived in the USA also in the 20th C, the federal government never fell into the paws of the mass murderers. In fact, though the feds were guilty of segregationist behavior and repression of some forms of thought, much more obviously the federal government took effective measures to moderate the racist behaviors of state governments and of ""us the People.""What does this have to do with a movie review? Everything! Because this movie made me think of history at every frame. It also made my wife cry on my shoulder disconsolately, and it made my teenage son turn off his laptop and stop wise-cracking for the rest of the evening. If you haven't already been informed of the scenario, here it is: Bruno's father, an ambitious and convinced Nazi military officer, is appointed to command a ""work camp"" -- really a death camp -- in a remote rural area. He takes his family there. His 8-year-old son, Bruno, finds a way to sneak out of the safe but boring home compound. Bruno finds the fence that surrounds the imprisoned Jews and makes contact with a boy his age, in a striped uniform that Bruno takes for pajamas. Sitting on opposite sides of the barbwire, the two naive boys form a bond....Some reviewers have objected that the boy Bruno, the central character, was implausibly naive, even for a pampered and protected eight-year-old. But the boy is something bigger than a single child; he's a synecdoche of the Germans (and Americans!) who ""didn't know"" and couldn't believe and perhaps couldn't care enough until it was too late. I suppose I'm taking the film as an allegory.Bruno's father and grandfather, seemingly decent men committed to duty and patriotism, are in fact ""whited sepulchers"" of ideology gone mad. They are surely Goldhagen's ""willing executioners."" The mother and grandmother are shown to be conscience-stricken, but they too are executioners, unwilling if you want to defend them, but guilty of passivity.  Once again thinking allegorically, I'm tempted to see all of Germany's postwar agony on the faces of the horrified parents.If this movie seems more to you than an evening's vicarious 'entertainment,' I suggest that you get acquainted with the books of W. G. Sebald, especially ""Austerlitz"" and ""The Emigrants.""

So it was with much incredulity that I viewed this film.First of all--the boys were so amazingly good--the acting and the true to life portrayals of boys at that age. I was also moved by the heft of the story--that the wife of the commander in charge was so powerfully moral. But what I was not expecting was this amazing story, and particularly, its summation--let me just put it that way. It had such a powerful effect on me that it resonated with me for days afterward.Why did this movie not received the attention that THE READER (a lesser movie, for sure) did?

1218795,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001N26GFM,Grady Harp,"[14, 17]","THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is a 'compleat' motion picture: even the title states the vision of the film in a subtly powerful way. Based on the excellent novel by John Boyne and adapted for the screen by director Mark Herman, this film has the courage to re-visit the Holocaust from the child's perspective.  Not that it covers up the atrocities of that horrid event and time - quite the opposite: in electing to examine that period in history the stance is that of two children, one German son of an officer in Hitler's armed forces and one son of a Jewish captive living with his father in a concentration camp.  The juxtaposition of these two eight year old boys separated not only by a fence but by an ideology neither of them can fathom the other's side makes for not only a brilliant film but also an unforgettable emotional experience.Bruno (Asa Butterfield in an extraordinary performance) is eight, his sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) is twelve and the two live with their parents in 1940 Berlin - father (David Thewlis) is a Komandant in  Hitler's army and mother (Vera Farminga) is a popular socialite and loving mother.  Father is 'promoted' and will be in charge of a new 'position' that means moving from their beautiful Berlin home to a 'home in the country'. Though Bruno doesn't want to leave his friends the family does indeed move - to a cold house next to what Bruno perceives is a farm. The father is forbidden to share his role and the meaning of it with his family, but it soon becomes obvious by the smoke stacks spewing hideously smelling odors into the atmosphere that the 'farm' is a concentration camp. The house servant Pavel (David Hayman), though abused by the father, becomes Bruno's friend when Bruno sustains an injury: Pavel quietly admits to Bruno that despite his 'pajama' uniform from the 'farm' that he practiced medicine in the past.  Bored, Bruno explores the forbidden area outside his home confines and finds a barbed wire electrified fence behind which sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who becomes Bruno's friend.  Neither lad understands the differences between them until Shmuel is sent into Bruno's household to polish glasses for a party: the armed forces chauffeur Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend) beats the 'little filthy Jew' for eating pastries Bruno has shared with him - a fact that the terrified Bruno denies.The mother discovers the truth about the 'farm' and the smoke stacks and sinks into a depression, loathing that her husband is in charge of such atrocities.  Gretel becomes transformed as a Hitler youth under the influence of the children's tutor (Jim Norton) and there are obvious philosophical schisms in the family.  Bruno, regretting his treatment of Shmuel, continues to sneak food to him and plans to help his young friend save Shmuel's father: Bruno digs into the 'farm' and the results bring the film to a terrifying and abrupt end.Both young actors give enormously moving performances and the manner in which Herman directs the action underlines the blur of perception many German's had about the reality of the Final Solution.  But for what this viewer perceives as the reason the film sustains the powerful message it does is the manner in which it ends. There are no attempts to 'sanitize' this film: it simply ends with a lightning bolt jolt that is one of the most powerful statements in all of the many films about the Holocaust.  It is simply a brilliant masterpiece of a movie from every aspect of judging it - acting, direction, music, cinematography, editing - and why this film failed to make an impression on the critics and public (and the Oscar folks!) when it was released in the theaters remains a conundrum.

But that boy, Shmuel, is the only friend he can find near his new house. Almost every day, Bruno throws his ball out too far ""by accident"" and runs to get it, as an excuse to run to the barbed wire fence where he spends time with his friend.Throughout this film, you can get a sense of how much or how little Germans knew about the Holocaust when it was happening. Some had a general idea of what was going on, while others were blind to what their country was doing. On the one extreme, Bruno was almost completely ignorant about what was happening to Jewish people. On the other, his dad and his dad's coworkers were the ones exterminating. Bruno's sister grew to be more nationalistic and pro-Nazi as the story continues, and his mom wasn't a fan of Jews but also couldn't live with the grief that her husband was murdering them in cruel and unusual ways. Because of his mom's sentiments, Bruno, his mom, and sister were going to go live with relatives in Heidelberg. But something happens that gets in the way of a peaceful transit to the city.This movie is NOT based on a true story; however, it is still just as dark and tragic as many of the other popular films about the Holocaust, maybe even more so. Anyone who has liked watching movies like The Pianist and Schindler's List should see this one! I saw the commentaries and deleted scenes too. The actors and crew who were interviewed explained their roles and related it to the way people like their character in 1940s Germany must have felt. The deleted scenes include Bruno seeing the concentration camp from his window, and his maid looking for him. They are very minor parts and not really amazing, but I guess that's why they're deleted scenes.I have two small complaints against the movie. One is that all the characters have a British accent! Yes, most of the actors were of British descent, but it didn't make any sense in the context of the movie! Also, it is a bit unrealistic that a German and Jewish boy are able to meet at the fence all the time, without a soldier punishing at least the Jewish one. Despite these two imperfections, it really is a great movie.",5,"Not a true story, not entirely realistic, but AMAZING anyway",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2477,"['Little', 'Bruno', 'son', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'world', 'think', 'Jews', 'are', 'bad', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'doctor', 'working', 'potato', 'peeler', 'kitchen', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'boy', 'age', 'stay', 'other', 'side', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'go', 'around', 'pajamas', 'day', 'boy', 'Shmuel', 'only', 'friend', 'can', 'find', 'new', 'house', 'day', 'Bruno', 'ball', 'out', 'too', 'far', 'accident', 'get', 'excuse', 'run', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'where', 'time', 'friend.Throughout', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'how', 'little', 'Germans', 'knew', 'Holocaust', 'when', 'was', 'happening', 'had', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'others', 'were', 'blind', 'what', 'country', 'was', 'doing', 'one', 'extreme', 'Bruno', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Jewish', 'people', 'other', 'dad', 'dad', 'coworkers', 'were', 'ones', 'exterminating', 'Bruno', 'sister', 'grew', 'be', 'more', 'nationalistic', 'pro-Nazi', 'story', 'mom', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Jews', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'grief', 'husband', 'was', 'murdering', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'ways', 'mom', 'sentiments', 'Bruno', 'mom', 'sister', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'live', 'relatives', 'Heidelberg', 'something', 'way', 'peaceful', 'transit', 'city.This', 'movie', 'NOT', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'however', 'still', 'just', 'dark', 'tragic', 'many', 'other', 'popular', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'watching', 'movies', 'Pianist', 'Schindler', 'List', 'should', 'see', 'one', 'saw', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'too', 'actors', 'crew', 'who', 'were', 'interviewed', 'explained', 'roles', 'related', 'way', 'people', 'character', '1940s', 'Germany', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'Bruno', 'seeing', 'concentration', 'camp', 'window', 'maid', 'looking', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'parts', 'not', 'really', 'amazing', 'guess', 'why', ""'re"", 'deleted', 'scenes.I', 'have', 'two', 'small', 'complaints', 'movie', 'One', 'characters', 'have', 'British', 'accent', 'Yes', 'most', 'actors', 'were', 'British', 'descent', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'context', 'movie', 'Also', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'German', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'are', 'able', 'meet', 'fence', 'time', 'soldier', 'punishing', 'least', 'Jewish', 'one', 'two', 'imperfections', 'really', 'great', 'movie']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

In GermanyI will neglect the side of the Commandant of the camp who is a SS and yet also has a personal life, a wife, two children, parents, a father who is on the good side and a mother who is clearly critical. A promotion for a SS officer is to become a camp Commandant and do, under strict secrecy, what is expected from him: to build a better German nation without any Jews, and if possible a world in the image of that German nation.The film shows very well how the whole ideology is built on propaganda, which is a pack of lies, or ,if you prefer a pack of lying wolves that are after you to get your souls down into hell, in the name of the Greater future of the German nation. There is not much to say about the details of that machine. The details are there, clear and obvious. No comment, just cry with rage at such dumb inhumanity, really for both sides, the German nation itself and their victims.The film is a lot more interesting with the eight year old son of that SS Commandant who escapes from the home of Herr Kommandant to  explore the forest behind the mansion and come to the fence where he discovers an eight year old Jewish boy who is hungry and sad, Shmuel. Shmuel has nothing to learn about the life outside the camp, but the other boy, Bruno, has to discover what the camp is and that it is no YMCA simmer camp. That takes time and a treason in the middle, but boys will be boys and they will invent a project to come together. Since Shmuel cannot come to the outside why not Bruno going into the camp.And that will be the drama. No survivors please with the final solution, and frankly it's better like that. Which of the two boys could have survived without being damaged for life, or till death ensues.And the film can end on the tears of the mother and sister and on the despair of the SS Commandant of a father. We will not be given the logical end for him after such a tragedy. Death at times can be sweet and desirable.This is a masterpiece of poignancy even if suspense (who cares about suspense in a subject we all know by heart and regret with all our hearts) is rather light because boys will be boys and boys have always been boys. And love, or call it friendship if you prefer being a prude, has no limits, no divides, no abyss in the middle. Love is unified by definition and love comes no matter what and is for life and death. Happy are those who can share a life full of discoveries and then a death full of satisfaction. I am afraid the two boys met in death with apprehension and fear but a lot of courage in their acceptance of that fate as being a fate in which they can hold hands, and they did, naked under the fumes of the death-inflicting shower.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Absolutely humanistic,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,3068,"['film', 'prodigy', 'horror', 'wrapped', 'up', 'love', 'horror', 'love', 'forever', 'making', 'eternal', 'death.Two', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'meet', 'one', 'free', 'side', 'fence', 'other', 'one', 'camp', 'side', 'fence', 'work', 'camp', 'nice', 'name', 'indeed', 'Konzentration', 'Kamp', 'Jews', 'just', 'when', 'final', 'solution', 'introduced', 'GermanyI', 'will', 'neglect', 'side', 'Commandant', 'camp', 'who', 'SS', 'yet', 'also', 'personal', 'life', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'parents', 'father', 'who', 'good', 'side', 'mother', 'who', 'clearly', 'critical', 'promotion', 'SS', 'officer', 'become', 'camp', 'Commandant', 'do', 'strict', 'secrecy', 'what', 'expected', 'build', 'better', 'German', 'nation', 'Jews', 'possible', 'world', 'image', 'German', 'nation.The', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'whole', 'ideology', 'built', 'propaganda', 'pack', 'lies', 'prefer', 'pack', 'lying', 'wolves', 'are', 'get', 'souls', 'down', 'hell', 'name', 'Greater', 'future', 'German', 'nation', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'details', 'machine', 'details', 'are', 'there', 'clear', 'obvious', 'comment', 'just', 'cry', 'rage', 'such', 'dumb', 'inhumanity', 'really', 'sides', 'German', 'nation', 'victims.The', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'SS', 'Commandant', 'who', 'home', 'Herr', 'Kommandant', 'explore', 'forest', 'mansion', 'come', 'fence', 'where', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'who', 'hungry', 'sad', 'Shmuel', 'Shmuel', 'nothing', 'learn', 'life', 'camp', 'other', 'boy', 'Bruno', 'discover', 'what', 'camp', 'YMCA', 'simmer', 'camp', 'time', 'treason', 'middle', 'boys', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'will', 'invent', 'project', 'come', 'together', 'Shmuel', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'outside', 'why', 'not', 'Bruno', 'going', 'camp.And', 'will', 'be', 'drama', 'survivors', 'please', 'final', 'solution', 'frankly', 'better', 'Which', 'two', 'boys', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'being', 'damaged', 'life', 'till', 'death', 'film', 'can', 'end', 'tears', 'mother', 'sister', 'despair', 'SS', 'Commandant', 'father', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'logical', 'end', 'tragedy', 'Death', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'sweet', 'desirable.This', 'masterpiece', 'poignancy', 'even', 'suspense', 'who', 'suspense', 'subject', 'know', 'heart', 'regret', 'hearts', 'rather', 'light', 'boys', 'will', 'be', 'boys', 'boys', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'boys', 'love', 'call', 'friendship', 'prefer', 'being', 'prude', 'limits', 'divides', 'abyss', 'middle', 'Love', 'unified', 'definition', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'life', 'death', 'Happy', 'are', 'who', 'can', 'share', 'life', 'full', 'discoveries', 'then', 'death', 'full', 'satisfaction', 'am', 'afraid', 'two', 'boys', 'met', 'death', 'apprehension', 'fear', 'lot', 'courage', 'acceptance', 'fate', 'being', 'fate', 'can', 'hold', 'hands', 'did', 'naked', 'fumes', 'death-inflicting', 'shower.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1218809,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B001N26GFM,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","Eight year-old Bruno, (Asa Butterfield), is an innocent, carefree boy growing up in Berlin during WWII. As the film opens, we see him running through the city's streets with his three best friends, their arms outstretched, pretending to be airplane pilots and feigning battles. Seemingly oblivious, they race past scenes of Jews being rounded up to be taken to concentration camps. Bruno, with his wonderful sense of adventure, wants to be an explorer when he grows up.He lives in a beautiful mansion, complete with gardens and servants, along with his twelve year-old sister Gretel, (Amber Beattie), their beautiful mother, (Vera Farmiga), and their father, a high ranking SS officer, (David Thewlis). After Bruno's and Gretel's father receives a promotion, a brand new title, ""Commandant,"" along with a fancier uniform, the family moves to a deserted house in the countryside. The house, a cold and somber place, with SS Stormtroopers everywhere, is actually SS Headquarters. The father's new job is to administer a concentration camp - a death camp - Auschwitz. Bruno is miserable in his new home. He misses his friends and school. There is no one to play with and he is very bored. His father tells him that, ""Home is where the family is."" And, ""Being a soldier is about duty instead of choice."" They cannot move back to Berlin.Because there is no school for the children to attend, a tutor is hired to educate them...and he does so from books filled with Nazi propaganda. When the little boy asks him about ""nice Jews,"" the teacher responds, ""I think, Bruno, if you ever found a nice Jew, you would be the greatest explorer in the world."" Gretel soon begins to model herself after the ""ideal"" Nazi youth, plastering the walls of her room with photographs of Hitler and children from the Nazi Youth Group, a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party. Bruno is not buying any of it. His tutor's teachings make no sense to him, given his budding sense of reason, and his earlier, relatively propaganda free, background. His paternal grandmother is anti-Nazi, and his mother is apolitical, but dutifully supportive of her husband.From his bedroom window, the boy notices a town of people dressed in striped pajamas separated from him by a wire fence. He thinks that the people are farmers. He wants to go and play with some of the children he sees, but is forbidden to leave the grounds. When he asks his father who those people are, Dad responds that they aren't really people. Bruno also asks questions about the smoke he sees rising from the ""farm"" and the terrible smell that accompanies it. When his mother discovers the reality of the camp, all the terrible details, she deteriorates mentally and emotionally into a shallow shell...no longer the vibrant woman we met in the opening scenes.With his avid curiosity and adventurous spirit, the boy finds a way out of the compound and eventually comes to the barbed wire fences surrounding the camp. He is totally bewildered by what he sees. On the other side of the fence is another eight year-old boy, Shmuel, (Jack Scanlon), a broken waif of a child wearing a numbered uniform. Shmuel lives a very different life than Bruno. He is a Jew, and along with the rest of his family, a prisoner in the camp. He sometimes hides by the fence, during work detail, where he meets Bruno and the two form a friendship. Bruno brings food for Shmuel and the two play checkers, with the board on Bruno's side of the fence. But Bruno still doesn't ""get it.""  The enormity of the evil confronting him is beyond his comprehension. He believes that the numbered striped pajamas are part of a game played inside the barbed wire enclosure. He asks his friend what is burned in the chimneys.Their friendship is an allegory of sorts. Producer David Heyman explained in the press notes that, ""Children have the potential and the ability to overcome differences in culture and identity; that people ultimately can get along if they're not encouraged to hate; that governments, institutions and the media can and do cultivate conflict and distrust-- these are timely ideas with universal relevance and I think this story makes them accessible to anyone."" At the beginning of the film, a quotation by poet John Betjeman appears on the screen, ""Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.Obviously nothing good can come from this Holocaust story...how can it? The final scenes had a visceral impact on me, and I sat stunned,  in pain, for some time after the movie ended.""Striped Pajamas"" is based on Irish author John Boyne's critically acclaimed,  award-winning young adult novel of the same title. The book is meant to educate young adults about the Holocaust. Having read the book, I think the film version is much more explicit. I believe that the manner in which the content is depicted, although done with great sensitivity and compassion, is too harsh for a young person to view. I am Jewish, and a mother, and I feel that it is so important to educate all people, especially our youth, about this most heinous event. But I prefer to do so by introducing books, like ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" before exposing children and ""tweens"" to such a disturbing drama.Ultimately ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"" is about the beauty of the human spirit. The acting is exceptional, especially the performances by the three talented children, Asa Butterfield, Jack Scanlon and Amber Beattie. I do recommend this film highly. I just want the prospective viewer to be forewarned as to the strength and impact of the narrative.Jana Perskie",5,"""Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of

1218810,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001N26GFM,Jason,"[3, 3]","How wonderful it must be to see the world through the eyes of an oblivious child.  There are no jobs, no wars, no famine, no taxes, no real thought of danger.  For a young boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the naivety and innocence could prove to be potentially dangerous.An up-and-coming SS officer (David Thewlis) is given a promotion; and as a result of his new assignment, his family is forced to move.  Traveling from the relative safety of Berlin to a very large, remote house was not what anyone other than the father expected.  Simultaneously supportive and reluctant, his family - especially the mother (played with heart-breaking emotion by Vera Farmiga) - soon realizes their new home is adjacent to an active concentration camp.With more than a passing resemblance to a mini-Hitler, Bruno is a typically adventurous boy.  Having a soldier for a father is a source of pride and admiration for him; he'd love nothing better than to emulate his father.  He initially notices the local ""gardeners"" in ""pajamas"" and becomes intrigued.  While exploring the woods in his backyard, something strictly forbidden from by his mother, he comes across the nearby camp and meets Shmuel (Scanlon), an emaciated, filthy eight-year old Jewish prisoner.  The two form a tenuous and dangerous friendship, discussing their childish similarities, but also uncovering at least one significant difference: their feeling towards soldiers.  Neither understands the precariousness of their surroundings, nor do they understand the hideous smells coming from a burning smokestack very nearby.Eventually their shared innocence disintegrates under the pressure of their real world surroundings as Bruno attempts to comprehend why everyone seems to hate the Jews even though his friend Shmuel is such a nice guy.  The final jaw-dropping moment shines light on the possibility of tragedy when one is ignorant, oblivious, or purposefully turning a blind eye to the surrounding dangers.The performances from all are incredibly moving.  Witnessing not only the loss of Jewish childhood via the stolen dignity, humanity, and life itself, but also that of the German childhood manipulated via the indoctrination of Nazi propaganda, truly delivers an incredibly heave message that resonates long after the movie is complete.

1218813,A6KNR46BDWOJU,B001N26GFM,JJ,"[1, 1]","I would not presume to give this movie a very thought provoking and long review, as it was this story was based on fiction.I personally enjoyed this film, it warmed my heart in many many ways, including forcing me to think what if I were the one on either side of the fence. You have to put yourself outside the realm of reality when watching this film though and realize that what is going on is the author trying to emphasize the holocaust in a fictional manner as these personal events happening in the midst of a tragedy never occurred.My criticism stems from the fact that there were so many family's, so many loved ones and so many lives involved in this human tragedy that the author could have easily written something of a true nature.. The author could have found many stories from true accounts or lets just say, for the sake of thought.. What if the film makers emphasized more that this was based on fiction and not almost sold this as real, I myself had to look this up to find the truth. I would have liked to see money put into a film telling one of the many many true to life stories that were and not a heartwarming story that yanks your heart at the end..Please do not get me wrong as this is a wonderful story that shows you the what if's of human tragedy but their is no evidence to support that something like this even remotely happened and I for one would like to be told if this were true from the beginning.. It seems that the film makers and author really want to sell you on this story to the point of neglecting to tell you that it is fiction with the only fact being what it is based around. I see nothing astounding in this work, just another film to make you cry so you may say ""BRAVO"" in the endI would rather, make a suggestion...

1218814,A3CC24EQUYSGGX,B001N26GFM,JJH-V,"[1, 1]","The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is extremely intense, even painful, but so beautifully done that one becomes pulled in.  In this film, we see the holocaust through the eyes of innocence - and the eyes are German.  We experience the story in the heart of a loving family - and the family is German.  Because of that viewpoint, we can understand a little better how people remained morally unchallenged during the holocaust, even when the ghastly truth was literally just outside their gates.  We can see, achingly, that we, as good people, are not immune to allowing that which we now condemn in hindsight.  The film draws parallels between the world of the camp, with the striped clothing those interred there must wear behind electrified fences, and the stark, fortress-like house in which the German commandant's family lives, with it's barred stair rail and locked, guarded fence.  We come to see that both groups are, in very different ways, imprisoned.  The fact that the main characters, Bruno and Schmuel, are each eight years old, allows us to feel tenderly toward them in their different innocent circumstances, and levels our sympathies.  Bruno's mother is a sensitive and nurturing woman, and the daughter dabbles with the Reich teachings  and the Reich heroes in the manner that we'd recognize in a twelve-year-old girl of today idolizing media stars.  We are even shown the loving father inside the proud, severe military commandant.  This makes experiencing the film very difficult, as the viewer becomes emotionally engaged in the friendship between Schmuel inside the camp, and Bruno with his warm German family in their compound.As a retired teacher I recall the difficulties of encouraging young people to understand this time in history.  To them, the holocaust is something that happened long ago, done buy a known monster, and something that they, as modern people, simply wouldn't do.  I wish I'd had this film to help them open their eyes to the commonality of people.  It shows us that Germans of the holocaust were ordinary people, too.  The film is fiction, but somehow it is truer than a documentary because it lets us into the hearts of those who lived in that time, and leads us to recognize that  the kind of thinking that lead to the holocaust is not, most unfortunately, banished to the distant past.  The seeds of the holocaust flowered into horrible fruit then, and the same seeds are within each of us now.  The film shows us through the commandant's innocent family that expressions of hate can devastate the hater as well.  We have an obligation to pass on the story of the holocaust to the current generation, so the mindset which lead to the atrocities can be recognized and avoided. Though it is difficult viewing, parents should watch it with children whom they judge capable, so that the priceless understanding that comes through the film will not be lost to the future.",5,"Challenging, heart-rending",1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,2912,"['Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'extremely', 'intense', 'even', 'painful', 'so', 'beautifully', 'done', 'one', 'pulled', 'film', 'see', 'holocaust', 'eyes', 'innocence', 'eyes', 'are', 'German', 'experience', 'story', 'heart', 'loving', 'family', 'family', 'German', 'viewpoint', 'can', 'understand', 'little', 'better', 'how', 'people', 'remained', 'morally', 'unchallenged', 'holocaust', 'even', 'when', 'ghastly', 'truth', 'was', 'literally', 'just', 'gates', 'can', 'see', 'achingly', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'immune', 'allowing', 'now', 'condemn', 'hindsight', 'film', 'parallels', 'world', 'camp', 'striped', 'clothing', 'interred', 'must', 'wear', 'electrified', 'fences', 'stark', 'fortress-like', 'house', 'German', 'commandant', 'family', 'barred', 'stair', 'rail', 'locked', 'guarded', 'fence', 'come', 'see', 'groups', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'imprisoned', 'fact', 'main', 'characters', 'Bruno', 'Schmuel', 'are', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'feel', 'tenderly', 'different', 'innocent', 'circumstances', 'levels', 'sympathies', 'Bruno', 'mother', 'sensitive', 'nurturing', 'woman', 'daughter', 'Reich', 'teachings', 'Reich', 'heroes', 'manner', ""'d"", 'recognize', 'twelve-year-old', 'girl', 'today', 'idolizing', 'media', 'stars', 'are', 'even', 'shown', 'loving', 'father', 'proud', 'severe', 'military', 'commandant', 'experiencing', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'emotionally', 'engaged', 'friendship', 'Schmuel', 'camp', 'Bruno', 'warm', 'German', 'family', 'compound.As', 'retired', 'teacher', 'recall', 'difficulties', 'encouraging', 'young', 'people', 'understand', 'time', 'history', 'holocaust', 'something', 'happened', 'long', 'ago', 'done', 'buy', 'known', 'monster', 'something', 'modern', 'people', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'wish', ""'d"", 'had', 'film', 'help', 'open', 'eyes', 'commonality', 'people', 'Germans', 'holocaust', 'were', 'ordinary', 'people', 'too', 'film', 'fiction', 'somehow', 'truer', 'documentary', 'hearts', 'who', 'lived', 'time', 'recognize', 'kind', 'thinking', 'lead', 'holocaust', 'not', 'most', 'unfortunately', 'banished', 'distant', 'past', 'seeds', 'holocaust', 'flowered', 'horrible', 'fruit', 'then', 'same', 'seeds', 'are', 'now', 'film', 'commandant', 'innocent', 'family', 'expressions', 'hate', 'can', 'devastate', 'hater', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'obligation', 'pass', 'story', 'holocaust', 'current', 'generation', 'mindset', 'lead', 'atrocities', 'can', 'be', 'recognized', 'avoided', 'difficult', 'viewing', 'parents', 'should', 'watch', 'children', 'whom', 'judge', 'capable', 'priceless', 'understanding', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'lost', 'future']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

1218818,A9TG2NFA614S9,B001N26GFM,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a devastating film, powerful and moving, with a startling and completely unexpected, unforgiving ending that sears the viewer and makes the whole movie incredibly significant. At the beginning we see a privileged Nazi family living in Berlin amid street scenes in which almost robotic people go about their business while in the background Jews are being rounded up for the concentration camps.The protagonist, an eight year old boy, Bruno, played superbly by Asa Butterfield is oblivious to what is going on around him. In his play world he is probably a fighter airplane soaring through the skies. Ironically he may be playing war games in his mind. He's a gentle, likable lad who has a loving family.The father, a loyal Nazi, though gentle, kindly as well, is assigned to a post in the country as the commandant of a concentration camp. In their walled compound the boy and his mother see the smoke rising from the nearby high chimney. Their servant is an older man who under his work clothes wears striped pajamas. We are aware of these details through the eyes of the mother and her son.The boy wanders out of the yard and comes upon the barbed wire fence of the camp. He meets an eight year old, Shmuel, also in striped pajamas, who is sad and hungry. They grow to be friends. Bruno is unaware of Shmuel's plight. There is a crucial denial scene in ""Striped"" just as there was between the two boys in ""The Kite Runner.""The movie concerns the onset of loss of innocence, and makes real the horrors of the Holocaust. The cinematography is outstanding; the acting is peerless.Can it be that the familial tunnel vision of human beings toward the plight of all humanity will be the downfall of the human species?It's a very significant work, a human drama that should move viewers.

And even all the years after the fact, you can still almost feel the horror and despair.  Simply visiting was a horrific experience, because the whole time you are there, you can't help but try to imagine what it was like.  Anyone with the sensitivity of a caterpillar ends up overwhelmed with compassion and loss, numbed and unable to encompass the magnitude of the reality.In all the things I've seen regarding the camps, I've never seen, or even imagined, a story about it portrayed through the eyes of an 8 year old child.  And not just an 8 year old child inside the camp, but an 8 year old child who is outside of it, innocent of what is going on while his father is the German running the camp.  An 8 year old who befriends a Jewish boy interred in the camp his father runs, neither really understanding the full reality.  And watching as the little German boy starts to wonder, to question, to learn that the lies he was fed were just that, lies.Watching the story unfold, drawing you along with it, starting out so innocently, and seeing as the people who were unaware start to become aware...

It is very well made and the casting was excellent.Having read the book I felt they left out some key elements that add to the story development. I guess that is always the case with book then movie. I have a very vivid imagination and the movie in my head had so many more details that left a lasting impression than the movie did.I had pictured Bruno the Nazi officers son just about as he is but not so skinny. There is a reference in the book about him being bigger than the POW Jewish boy. actually it was the other way around in the movie.It was made very excellent and the outcome of the story is the same. How it all happens is just a bit different. If possible I'd suggest see the movie first then read the book..that way it will add details and you will not be frustrated that key points are left out that really matter in the development of the Bruno character.Bruno is so very innocent of what is going on in the camps. It does make you think that the childen of these Nazi officers are not to blame. Some where forced to be Hitler Youth but not the case for Bruno. He was a typical 8 year old boy who was just innocent and had been protected.What really helps in the movie is to see the reactions of the Officers wife. Her expressions and reactions to learning what was really going on in the camps her husband was in charge of. She was so horrified.So if you have the chance this story is a must either by film or book. If you do both again I suggest the movie then the book.

Although completely fictional and highly improbable, the movie has a visceral punch that will literally knock the wind out of you.  Briefly, the movie is about a German family in which the father become the commandant of a Jewish concentration camp (in the book, the camp is identified as Auschwitz).  The story-line unfolds as though we are seeing the events happen through the wide-eyed naive eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant.  Bruno quite accidentally forms an unknowing friendship with another 8 year old boy, but this boy, the boy in the striped pajamas on the other side of the fence, is a Jew. Bruno is completely ignorant of what is happening in the camp, which he believes to be a farm. When the commandant's wife realizes that the camp is a death camp, (apparently she too is blissfully unaware of the purpose of the camp), she has a falling out with her husband and demands to take the children away.  On the very day they are set to leave, events occur that lead to the climactic and sobering ending.While thoroughly improbable in terms of the plot, in my opinion, this film still packs a powerful punch.  Critics, many of them Jewish critics, assailed this film for its improbability and for the naivete of the characters, in effect implying that the typical German citizens of the day did not know the meaning or intent of the death camps.  This is a valid criticism, but in the film's defence, this again is NAZI Germany seen through the eyes of a boy.  It is not meant to be a film that exposes all the evils of the Jewish Final Solution.  The film's ending is quite a bit different from the book's ending, but the effect is just as powerfully moving and sobering.This film is definitely not suitable for children up to age 13.kone",4,Heart Wrenching,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,1839,"['film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'John', 'Boyne', 'completely', 'fictional', 'highly', 'improbable', 'movie', 'visceral', 'punch', 'will', 'literally', 'knock', 'wind', 'Briefly', 'movie', 'German', 'family', 'father', 'become', 'commandant', 'Jewish', 'concentration', 'camp', 'book', 'camp', 'identified', 'Auschwitz', 'story-line', 'unfolds', 'are', 'seeing', 'events', 'happen', 'wide-eyed', 'naive', 'eyes', 'Bruno', 'eight-year-old', 'son', 'commandant', 'Bruno', 'quite', 'accidentally', 'unknowing', 'friendship', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'boy', 'boy', 'striped', 'pajamas', 'other', 'side', 'fence', 'Jew', 'Bruno', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'what', 'happening', 'camp', 'be', 'farm', 'When', 'commandant', 'wife', 'camp', 'death', 'camp', 'apparently', 'too', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'purpose', 'camp', 'falling', 'out', 'husband', 'take', 'children', 'away', 'very', 'day', 'are', 'set', 'leave', 'events', 'occur', 'lead', 'climactic', 'sobering', 'ending.While', 'thoroughly', 'improbable', 'terms', 'plot', 'opinion', 'film', 'still', 'powerful', 'punch', 'Critics', 'many', 'Jewish', 'critics', 'assailed', 'film', 'improbability', 'naivete', 'characters', 'effect', 'implying', 'typical', 'German', 'citizens', 'day', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'meaning', 'intent', 'death', 'camps', 'valid', 'criticism', 'film', 'defence', 'again', 'NAZI', 'Germany', 'seen', 'eyes', 'boy', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'film', 'evils', 'Jewish', 'Final', 'Solution', 'film', 'ending', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'book', 'ending', 'effect', 'just', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'sobering.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'up', 'age', '13.kone']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

I had no idea the film ended as it did, and we all walked out in silence.  Yet, the more we discussed it on the way home, the more we saw the irony--well, perhaps poetic justice, in a sense-- of the film's message of evil and the way it takes root, and how you can't participate in it and still keep yourself and your family separate from it.  The message is transferable to so many modern situations that this alone makes the film worthwhile.

Yet, THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PAJAMAS, was probably the most heart-breaking movie I've seen because it showed in chilling details how two young boys - one Jewish, one German, became innocent victims of Hitler's Nazis madness to exterminate Europe of non-Aryans.  The movie was all the more powerful and heart-wrenching in its portrayal of the hedonist perpetration of human extermination because the two main child characters [eight-year-old Shmuel, 'the boy in the stripped pajamas', and eight-year-old, Bruno 'the son of the Commandant responsible for the extermination camp were Shumel is held captive'] are exemplary in their roles of capturing children's naivety and inability to comprehend the unthinkable.Other reviewers have written in great detail about the specifics of the plot.  It is multi-layered and complex, examining the the characters who portrayed participants and victims of a an evil event in recent history, and the effects it had on each.  Instead, I prefer to focus my comments on why I believe this movie is so important.In my opinion, we underestimate the innocence of young children and their gullibility, their 'magical thinking' to believe in an idealistic world, and the pureness of their hearts to believe the best in their parents; failing to see, imagine, or comprehend any flaws. Even when young children are exposed to the 'worse' of abusive conditions, most don't grasp the depth of their circumstances.  For this reason [among others] children are easily manipulated to do what they are told by predators; coerced to believe in angels and gifts when they obey, or condemned to be tormented by monstrous demons if they don't comply.Because of the subtleties in the manner the scenes are directed, rather than the 'overtness' obvious to us as adults, the dialogue between Bruno and Shumel made this movie all the more chilling to watch.  As viewers, we watch their friendship blossom knowing they have already become unsuspecting victims.  Through the innocent and loyal camaraderie that we witness between Bruno and Shumel - two 'sacrificial lambs' - we discover the unimaginable horror, power, magnitude, and atrocity of the Holocaust.THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PAJAMAS is a movie to be watched by families who have teenagers.

The grandmother in the movie was obviously aware and opposed from the beginning, but said almost nothing. There is some question about what really happened to her in the movie, but she was such a peripheral character I can't write much about it.The mother in the film was such a coward when she understood the horror of the camp, yet still allowed her children to be indoctrinated by their tutor. When she saw her daughter with a crush on an especially cold and cruel young officer, she never tried to dissuade her daughter from forming an attachment. When a prisoner showed her son kindness and took care of him when he was hurt, all she could manage was a perfunctory, unemotional word of thanks. And when that same prisoner lost his life for a simple mishap, she said not one word as he was killed. She did fight with her husband about it, but she could have done so much more.I think, as a mother myself, the character of the mother in this story was a tragic figure because of her lack of words and action to do anything to even make the life of the prisoners (two were in the house during the movie) even a little bit better. A kind word, an offering of food--but no, she did not do one single thing. Then, at the end of the movie, she suffered what no mother should suffer and partially because of her apathy of evil.The acting in this movie is excellent (although it is odd that every person seems to have a British/Irish accent--definitely not German or Polish--which is distracting to the authenticity of the story) from the children (how do young people become so talented at such young ages?) to the adults.

Curious - all the workers wear dull black and white striped pajamas.If we know even a little about the holocaust, it is curious to see if through the eyes of eight-year-old Bruno.  Bruno is lonely in his new home - there are no other young children.  On the other side of the barbed wire his new friend, Shmuel, has the opportunity to play with the other workers.We see the horror as Bruno's mother (played by Vera Farmiga) realizes that dear old Dad is the kommandant of a Death Camp rather than a work camp.  She is horrified, and like the Kommandant's mother, not in agreement with the ""final solution"".  But their voices are in the minority, and drowned out by the prevailing opinion of the inherent ""evilness"" of the Jews.This film does not break new story-telling ground.  But by telling the story from a point of view that we rightly expect to be innocent, and shielded from horror - we feel the horror more nearly than from an history book.In scope and tone and story and setting and cinematography inferior to Speilberg's masterpiece, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is nonetheless a worthwhile film.",4,All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing - Edmund Burke,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2070,"['Mrs.', 'just', 'rewatchedSchindler', 'List', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'masterpiece', 'made', 'interested', 'recent', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', '.Have', 'not', 'often', 'wondered', 'what', 'good', 'people', 'Germany', 'were', 'thinking', 'Hitler', 'codified', 'anti-Semitism', 'six', 'million', 'Jews', 'were', 'murdered', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'was', 'lock-step', 'mindless', 'prejudices', 'would', 'allow', 'otherwise', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'looked', 'other', 'way', 'unspeakable', 'evil', 'walked', 'earth', 'evil', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'one', 'prevailed.Bruno', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'much', 'other', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'curious', 'family', 'family', 'comfortable', 'home', 'loving', 'environment', 'Bruno', 'father', 'soldier', 'Bruno', 'pride', 'seeing', 'father', 'uniform', 'Bruno', 'father', 'receiving', 'promotion', 'assignment', 'important', 'new', 'post.At', 'new', 'assignment', 'Bruno', 'workers', 'farm', 'where', 'father', 'overseer', 'Curious', 'workers', 'wear', 'dull', 'black', 'white', 'striped', 'pajamas.If', 'know', 'even', 'little', 'holocaust', 'curious', 'see', 'eyes', 'eight-year-old', 'Bruno', 'Bruno', 'lonely', 'new', 'home', 'are', 'other', 'young', 'children', 'other', 'side', 'barbed', 'wire', 'new', 'friend', 'Shmuel', 'opportunity', 'play', 'other', 'workers.We', 'see', 'horror', 'Bruno', 'mother', 'played', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'dear', 'old', 'Dad', 'kommandant', 'Death', 'Camp', 'rather', 'work', 'camp', 'horrified', 'Kommandant', 'mother', 'not', 'agreement', 'final', 'solution', 'voices', 'are', 'minority', 'drowned', 'out', 'prevailing', 'opinion', 'inherent', 'evilness', 'Jews.This', 'film', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'story-telling', 'ground', 'telling', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'rightly', 'expect', 'be', 'innocent', 'shielded', 'horror', 'feel', 'horror', 'more', 'nearly', 'history', 'book.In', 'scope', 'tone', 'story', 'setting', 'cinematography', 'inferior', 'Speilberg', 'masterpiece', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'nonetheless', 'worthwhile', 'film']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

Jack Scanlan as Schmuel was an excellent choice for the 'boy in the striped pajamas' and I had read somewhere that that young boy was able to pull at your emotions with just his facial expressions and he pulls even stronger when he does speak.  Whoever wrote that was completely right.  As does the innocence of the friendship that builds between the son of a German Nazi Commander, and a boy that lives in 'the farm' on the other side of an electrified barbed wire fence.  I found myself rooting for their friendship, even though I knew that it would be short lived.  I expected it to end when Bruno betrays his friendship to Schmuel when he lies about Schmuel taking food.  But it didn't.  The boys continue their friendship through the fence and in an attempt to apologize to Schmuel for lying, Bruno sneeks across (or under) the fence to help Schmuel find his father who has gone missing within 'the farm'.  The Nazi Commander and his wife discover their son is missing and start a frantic search to find their son.  The movie then takes an unexpected turn (although, somewhat expected if you know any history about concentration camps) and it's at that moment when your emotions are truly put to the test.

1218870,A3SH2OT200EUO6,B001N26GFM,"Paul G. Bens, Jr.","[1, 1]","First, let's start off by saying that the subject matter is not the easiest and some will find this a difficult film to watch.  But I urge you to do so.  It is a haunting film, one that will make you think and also understand the emotional scope of the horrors that happened in Nazi Germany.The script (adapted from the novel by John Boyne) is tight, the dialog and characters defined as much by what the characters do not say as they are by their words, deed and actions.  The casting is spot on as well, with Jack Scanlon as Shmuel turning in a heartbreaking performance, full off the innocence of youth tamped down by the horror around him.  Likewise, David Hayman as Pavel turns in an understated performance to serve as counterbalance to Shmuel.  Pavel has seen it all, plunged from the heights to the lowest of lows.  He is a broken man and yet he has not lost his humanity.  Asa Butterfield turns in a nice performance as Bruno, the son of the Nazi Commandant, and Vera Farmiga as Bruno's mother gives a nuanced performance as the woman who has her head in the sand but her eyes wide open.  And stunningly frightening is Henry Kingsmill as the explosive Nazi officer, Karl.  And David Thewlis as the steady and determined Commandant is equally effective.The direction combined with the writing is what makes this film really sail.  The contrast between the innocence of the two boys and the action going on about them is powerful, creating a view of racism that seems all the more horrible when seen through the eyes of children who don't understand what is happening, what it all means.Difficult and challenging, this film is an important look at racism and the massive sins of the Nazi regime.  It takes an event which seems both far away and achingly near to us in the time line and creates a truly horrifying and moving portrait of what can happen when madmen go unchecked.

Based on the novel by John Boyne, the story follows 8 year old Bruno, the son of an SS officer in 1942 Nazi Germany. The film starts out innocent enough. As Bruno and his friends make their way through the streets of Berlin playing, one could almost mistake this for any other given European city in peacetime. Everything seems alright with the world, and even Bruno's father the SS man is a loving family man. Everything changes when father gets promoted, and the family has to move to a new house in the country. What Bruno doesn't realize is that his father has just taken over as Commandant of a concentration camp. In fact, Bruno doesn't even know what such a camp is, or what its purpose would be. Thus he is perplexed when out exploring one day, he comes to the camp fence and meets a boy his own age on the other side. They develop a friendship, and the story culminates in a somewhat startling denouement. The film also gives some interesting insight into family life in Nazi Germany; it's always odd to see a Death's Head insignia sporting killer behaving as any other dad would. I must say, there did seem to be something slightly far-fetched about the story, Bruno's complete naivete, etc, not to mention the English accents. But minus that, I found this to be a very sad yet compelling story that successfully portrays this horrific period through a child's eyes.

But still it still tells truths that had happened to the Jewish people!!!!! It is all history now and what Germany did was so very sinful, disgraceful, cruel, and down right evil!!!!But we human beings all over this planet earth are cruel and evil to each other when we begin to think we are better than another race!!!!We have no respect for each other, nor do we have respect for the Animals that GOD MADE!!!! such CRUELITY!!!!But when people want to say there is no GOD-THE CREATOR and put satan's ideals and lie into everything THEN TRUE GODLY LOVE IS shoved to the back ground!!!!!A movie like this shows not every German felt that hatred towards their fellow mankind!!!!!There is GOOD, LOVE, KINDNESS, RESPECT  IN EVERY RACE!!!!!JUST as there is Hatred, Evil, Lack of Love and Lack of Respect in EVERY RACE!!!!In This Movie It Showed how hatred runs down thur families that will not put themselves in the same positions as those they hated!!!! Just as the husband hated the Jews because his dad did! But his own mother did not feel the same way as her husband! And even in her death he disrespected her!!!!!  And then when his wife actually saw how cruel they were being treated in her own home, she started thinking and how hard her husband was becoming!!!! It was the remark[about them stinking even worst-when he looked up at the smoke in the air from the Jews being burnt] of the German man that was there taking care of things for them, how he talked about the Jews and how he acted towards them! And  how her own daughter was talking and  acting when homeschooled by a German teacher, her daughter was changing, and not for the better!!!! Oh this was a very sad movie!!!!It makes you think about yourself in how you would treat a different race other than your own?If we do not believe GOD MADE MANKIND, nor there is not devil[satan] then he keeps our eyes and heart believing in his evil hateful ways as well!!!!!! MANKIND CAME FROM THE CREATOR GOD and then Adam chose to disobey GOD for the love of his wife and ate of the forbidden fruit, then we human beings develoved a sinful nature!!!!If people can not believe we can be so cruel and hateful as this picture shows, then somebody needs to check out history from BIBLE Times to Now and see how wicked and evil and unloving  mankind has been and is still!Well in this movie it gives the true point of it all!!!!!

But none of them could have the same impact as this film. That is because this movie looks at the Holocaust from the perspective of two children, one within the camp and one outside. Both are caught up in a chain of events dictated by circumstances beyond their control.Even wars cannot stop children from becoming friends. Children have no enemies. Even as the Nazi propaganda machine denigrates Jews, Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a senior SS Officer forms a friendship with an eight-year-old boy in the concentration camp located just beyond their house. Both of them have little idea of what is going on. Genocide is a concept they know nothing about.This movie evokes memories of the Italian movie Life is Beautiful, because they both focus on children caught up in war. But the message that emanates from The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is even more powerful. Life is not only beautiful, it is precious. How could a man with a family send so many innocents to their deaths? That is a pivotal point in the film. When Bruno's father realizes the futility of his actions, it is too late.This is one of the best movies centered on World War II. There's not a gunshot in sight, but the smoke from the chimneys is all that is needed to show the depths to which man could sink in times of war. It will appeal to children and adults alike - this movie is a good teaching aid as well if you want to tell your children about the Holocaust.

The first thing I found only slightly irritating is that it took a bit of time to get used to american and British actors playing Germans who spoke with a British accent. Not a major problem of course but none the less it was a little bit of an annoyance. Secondly, I am having a very hard time believing that such an event could have actually happened. Not knowing if this film is based on a true story or not had me wondering that if it did happen, how? There was some things that didn't make sense. For instance a German boy befriends a Jewish boy by secretly sneaking off from his home near a concentration camp where the Jewish boy was imprisoned. He goes to the site to see what it was really like there out of an adventurous spirit. Anyway the friendship that develops between these two boys happens in broad daylight, through a fence that is in plain view of risen guard shacks around the camp. The two play games like checkers, and the German boy brings food and often passes it through the fence to the Jewish boy. So it's very hard to swallow that no Nazi guard saw any of this at all and attempted to put a stop to it. The story as a whole only works if the situation is believable. But based on the very small concrete pile that was meant to hide the goings on between the two boys, it simply is not plausable that within the visual representation that this friendship could have ever happened. If it did and the story is true then the film fails to make the scenario believable. I also found it difficult to believe that this very intelligent German boy could remain so clueless about this camp and not at least know something very bad was going on in there. Basically though this film tells a much different story than other films about the Holocaust and it was very well acted and well made, and I was happy to see that there was nearly no violence in the entire film.",2,Actually very good but sadly there are some hard to ignore weaknesses,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1964,"['film', 'was', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'problems', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'first', 'thing', 'found', 'only', 'slightly', 'irritating', 'took', 'bit', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'american', 'British', 'actors', 'playing', 'Germans', 'who', 'spoke', 'British', 'accent', 'Not', 'major', 'problem', 'course', 'none', 'less', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'annoyance', 'Secondly', 'am', 'having', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'event', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'Not', 'knowing', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'had', 'wondering', 'did', 'happen', 'how', 'was', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'instance', 'German', 'boy', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'secretly', 'sneaking', 'off', 'home', 'concentration', 'camp', 'where', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'site', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'Anyway', 'friendship', 'two', 'boys', 'broad', 'daylight', 'fence', 'plain', 'view', 'risen', 'guard', 'camp', 'two', 'play', 'games', 'checkers', 'German', 'boy', 'food', 'often', 'fence', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'very', 'hard', 'swallow', 'Nazi', 'guard', 'saw', 'attempted', 'put', 'stop', 'story', 'whole', 'only', 'situation', 'believable', 'based', 'very', 'small', 'concrete', 'pile', 'was', 'meant', 'hide', 'goings', 'two', 'boys', 'simply', 'not', 'plausable', 'visual', 'representation', 'friendship', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'happened', 'did', 'story', 'true', 'then', 'film', 'make', 'scenario', 'believable', 'also', 'found', 'difficult', 'believe', 'very', 'intelligent', 'German', 'boy', 'could', 'remain', 'so', 'clueless', 'camp', 'not', 'least', 'know', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'was', 'going', 'Basically', 'film', 'much', 'different', 'story', 'other', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'made', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'was', 'nearly', 'violence', 'entire', 'film']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1218879,A3NPVNPMXN8L2G,B001N26GFM,"R. A. Barricklow ""Scaramouche""","[1, 4]","A story of innocence against a diabolical truth. It is set in WW11, but really it could happen anytime, anywhere. For in reality, it is a story of mankind's struggle within Himself.Seeing the cover of DVD with two innocent children, one in pajamas, next to a barbed wire fence; I knew in my gut that this was Tombstone Territory Hardcore. Experience weathers the face of innocence, laugh lines troubled by worry lines next door to evil. Some live in evil's mist never knowing; many Germans have claimed suprise over the Holocaust, some even denying it. In 2000 there were a suspected 5,000 to 7,000 camps. Today we know there were over 20,000 such camps. Six known extermination camps, 12,000 ghettos of starvation, 10+ million slave laborers, 10+ million POWs, and thats not counting other types of camps. Each camp was an island unto itself with many independent bureaucracies, giving free reign to their many independent commandants, to have absolute power over thier prisoners. Even today the truth is still slowly coming to light.In this fabled/allegorical movie the fence represents a fact. The fence is seperating the two innocent children and they both wonder at its purpose. On one side, hunger & abuse. The other, an abundance of food/toys. Both wonder what the truth is. The irony, of course, is that both are being protected from it (sound familiar?). This brings to my mind an observation by the screenwriter Robert McKee, ""What happens is fact. Truth is what we think about what happens."".Shumel, the boy inside the fence, is close to death's door and not aware of it. Bruno, son of the SS officier running the camp, is just as unaware of the fact that this where the ovens of hell on earth are burning. A holocaust of inhumanity so diabolically evil that it cloaks itself in plain sight/shadowed by its very own unbelievable reality.By keeping the truth from the boys, they know not what they do. When they dig a hole. Are they digging their way out/in/ or their own graves? The truth is killing them, not protecting them. The only ones protected by the truth are those that keep it from us, keepers of the darkness that fears the light of day.The Founding Fathers knew that a secret government is a bad government. That power corrupted. The Germany of the 1930's had passed from the light into the darkness quickly/quietly, as quick the rest of the world followed...into hell.The two inocent children here should have been told the FACTS.

That evolution was beautifully portrayed by the actors.  The acting was incredible throughout, though I did find the accents of Brits playing German characters a bit distracting.

1218882,A1MZJ977WMS382,B001N26GFM,Reviewer,"[3, 5]","Of all the Holocaust dramatizations I've ever seen, this one was easily the most contrived. Though I really wanted to like it, I quickly realized it wasn't going to be able to live up to the expectations I had for it.Not knowing a great deal about the plot beforehand, the idea of a movie about the Holocaust approached from the perspective of a young German boy seemed a really intriguing idea. But in translating that idea to film, something was lost.Though it might seem an inconsequential and trivial point to some, as an English film with English actors, for me, a good deal of credibility was lost up front. And there were other problems here. The notion of a camp inmate being able to slip away unnoticed, presumably about the same time each day, to talk, play, and share food with his young German companion - who would ultimately be able to dig under the electric fence that divided them, also unnoticed, seemed particularly far-fetched. What's more, the wife of the Nazi commander who is responsible for operations at Auschwitz has no clue that Jews were being sent there to die, or that her husband is there to make sure this happens according to plan. At times she even seems sympathetic to the plight of the Jews, thanking the prisoner who worked in her house for bandaging her son's knee, wincing when he is beaten, and looking on with an obvious sense of disapproval in finding her daughter's bedroom plastered with Nazi images, even questioning what the new tutor was teaching her children. The notion of an unsuspecting, compassionate woman as the wife of a high-ranking Nazi official was perhaps the hardest idea of all to swallow. Was the intention here to soften a much harsher reality because that reality - that she knew exactly what was going on and agreed fully with her husband that Jews could not be considered people - was too much to ask viewers to digest?Other things were ""off"" here as well. The way in which the two boys communicate with each other, particularly in the beginning, seems more befitting men many years older than a couple of eight year olds. And young Bruno's perception of the concentration camp as a farm, its inmates as pajama-clad strangers, and the prisoner in his house as a man who willingly ""gave it all up"" (meaning his career as a doctor) to peel potatoes - which should have been able to come off as genuine enough as an eight year old's observation - somehow didn't.The young boys were really quite good actors, so kudos to them. I can't say the same for the actresses who portrayed the mother and sister - their performances were a bit on the bland side. And David Thewliss, an actor I've admired for some time, was simply miscast here.All this aside, the last twenty minutes build in intensity to deliver a final unexpected wallop - powerful enough to almost overlook the problems unraveled in the first hour.Though it could have been a lot better, the film makes a point about the utter senselessness of man's inhumanity to man, and if it makes young people interested in learning more about the Holocaust, then in the final analysis, it was an important film.",3,Hard to swallow,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,3121,"['Holocaust', 'dramatizations', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'contrived', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'quickly', 'realized', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'had', 'it.Not', 'knowing', 'great', 'deal', 'plot', 'beforehand', 'idea', 'movie', 'Holocaust', 'approached', 'perspective', 'young', 'German', 'boy', 'seemed', 'really', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'translating', 'idea', 'film', 'something', 'was', 'might', 'seem', 'inconsequential', 'trivial', 'point', 'English', 'film', 'English', 'actors', 'good', 'deal', 'credibility', 'was', 'lost', 'up', 'front', 'were', 'other', 'problems', 'here', 'notion', 'camp', 'inmate', 'being', 'able', 'slip', 'away', 'unnoticed', 'presumably', 'same', 'time', 'day', 'talk', 'play', 'share', 'food', 'young', 'German', 'companion', 'who', 'would', 'ultimately', 'be', 'able', 'dig', 'electric', 'fence', 'divided', 'also', 'unnoticed', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'far-fetched', 'What', 'more', 'wife', 'Nazi', 'commander', 'who', 'responsible', 'operations', 'Auschwitz', 'clue', 'Jews', 'were', 'being', 'sent', 'there', 'die', 'husband', 'there', 'make', 'sure', 'according', 'plan', 'times', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'plight', 'Jews', 'thanking', 'prisoner', 'who', 'worked', 'house', 'bandaging', 'son', 'knee', 'wincing', 'when', 'beaten', 'looking', 'obvious', 'sense', 'disapproval', 'finding', 'daughter', 'bedroom', 'plastered', 'Nazi', 'images', 'even', 'questioning', 'what', 'new', 'tutor', 'was', 'teaching', 'children', 'notion', 'unsuspecting', 'compassionate', 'woman', 'wife', 'high-ranking', 'Nazi', 'official', 'was', 'perhaps', 'hardest', 'idea', 'swallow', 'Was', 'intention', 'here', 'soften', 'much', 'harsher', 'reality', 'reality', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'agreed', 'fully', 'husband', 'Jews', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'people', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'viewers', 'digest', 'Other', 'things', 'were', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'two', 'boys', 'communicate', 'other', 'particularly', 'beginning', 'more', 'befitting', 'men', 'many', 'years', 'older', 'couple', 'eight', 'year', 'olds', 'young', 'Bruno', 'perception', 'concentration', 'camp', 'farm', 'inmates', 'pajama-clad', 'strangers', 'prisoner', 'house', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'meaning', 'career', 'doctor', 'peel', 'potatoes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'come', 'off', 'genuine', 'enough', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'observation', 'somehow', ""didn't.The"", 'young', 'boys', 'were', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'actors', 'so', 'kudos', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'actresses', 'who', 'portrayed', 'mother', 'sister', 'performances', 'were', 'bit', 'bland', 'side', 'David', 'Thewliss', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'admired', 'time', 'was', 'simply', 'miscast', 'here.All', 'aside', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'build', 'intensity', 'deliver', 'final', 'unexpected', 'wallop', 'powerful', 'enough', 'almost', 'overlook', 'problems', 'unraveled', 'first', 'hour.Though', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'film', 'point', 'utter', 'senselessness', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'young', 'people', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'Holocaust', 'then', 'final', 'analysis', 'was', 'important', 'film']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a nice slow paced film that has sort of a ""day in the life of"" feel to it.  Young Bruno is 8 years old and pretending to be an airplane flying through the streets of Berlin playing with his friends.  When he arrives home, he discovers that he has to move away and leave his friends.  His father, a German Commander, has to go away because he has a new job and he's taking his family with him.At first, Bruno's new home seems very office-like and cold, until a distant farm he can see from his bedroom window catches his interest.  But the farm seems odd.  All the farmers are wearing striped pajamas.  A tutor comes to teach Bruno and his sister.  His sister soon loses all interest in her dolls and turns to the current events - the war and the extermination of the Jews.  But Bruno doesn't understand.  He wants to get outside the garden walls and away from the house to go exploring.  When he finally escapes, he approaches the barbed wire fence surrounding the ""farm"" and he finds another 8 year old boy like himself on the other side of the wire.For me, Bruno's niavity of the situation is a lot like the way America was during the Holocaust.  Bruno is proud of his father, but he has no idea that his father is in charge of an extermination camp.  He has no idea what takes place in the camp.  He even sees a propaganda film which makes the camp appear like a vacation and Bruno thinks his father is a good man.  But unfortunately, commanders in such positions had to swear on their life.  They couldn't even tell their wives what was happening.  We see this in the movie as the relationship between husband and wife begins to fall apart when Bruno's mother discovers what is happening after she asks the commander's assistant about the foul smell in the air coming from the chimneys.In the meantime, Bruno steals food to take to his friend, but he doesn't know why his new friend doesn't like to play ball over the fence. Why is it dangerous?  And why must his friend always run away when the horn sounds?  When his new friend gets a chance to come to Bruno's house to clean the drinking glasses, Bruno gives him a snack but a guard catches him.  Bruno lies and says he doesn't know the boy and that he stole the food.  Bruno returns to the barbed wire fence for several days, eager to apologize, but his friend is not there.  Of course, you fear the worst thinking the boy has been killed due to Bruno's actions, but the young prisoner soon returns.  To make up for what he did, Bruno wants to help the boy find his father, but he soon discovers his friendship with the boy in the striped pajamas could have dangerous consequences.Most of us have been touched by the story of Anne Frank or some other Holocaust story that we read in our history books or saw in the movie theater.

1218895,A3GG91QZH5FQJ4,B001N26GFM,S.,"[0, 0]","""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is an unusual story of the Holocaust.  Bruno (Butterfield) is an eight-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany.  In fact, Bruno's life is great:  he lives in a big house, playing with friends, and enjoying life to the fullest.  His father (Thewlis) is a German officer, and the entire family is proud of him.  That pride grows even larger when the father, an SS officer, gets promoted; a move that requires the entire family to move east to the ""countryside"".The first signs that there might be something wrong emerge as Bruno peeks through the window of his room, looking at the strange farmers who all wear pajamas.  Bruno doesn't understand why, upon his inquiry of the strangely dressed people, his window is boarded up, and Bruno is not allowed to play in the back yard.  It is even more strange that one of these farmers works in Bruno's family's kitchen, peeling potatoes and never speaking or even looking up.  Bruno does not understand why this man is peeling the potatoes after he finds out that the man is doctor by training, after Bruno fell and hurt himself.In fact, Bruno does not know that he is living immediately next to Auschwitz and that his father is the Camp commander.  With the typical curiosity of a child, Bruno goes into the thin strip of forest behind his house, and goes all the way to the barbed wire, behind which he encounters a boy his own age; this boy also wore striped pajamas.  The two boys, unaware of the politics, religion, or ancient hatreds, strike up a friendship, each boy lonely and starving for companionship.  And although separated by the barbed wire, the boys look forward to Bruno's sneaking out of the back yard, and to having simple conversations every day.  But Bruno must be careful lest his parents, or one of their mean uniformed soldier friends find out about Bruno's activities.I didn't know what to think about this film.  Heaven knows I have seen many films about the Holocaust, and while each offers something new, there are only so many ways a story could be told.  However, I had to take into account that the story of Bruno is fictional.  The film blew me away.  No, there were no great special effects or super tragic scenes sparkled throughout the movie.  No, the film is made in a very simple manner, which only adds charm to it.  What got me is the irony of the film, especially in the very end.  The screenwriting is simple, photography good, and editing well done.  Acting is a bit stiff, but Butterfield did a good job in his role.  In the end, the movie left me perplexed and deep in thought, a result that I often yearn for.All in all, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a well-done movie with a controversial ending.  One either loves it or hates it, but it doesn't leave the viewer non-chalant.

Despite eight-year-old Bruno's seemingly neverending navet&eacute; about the world around him, but specifically, The Fatherland, this drama explores the holocaust, war, and dubious parental morality from the perspective of a child.  The acting is superb, particularly, Farmiga, Thewlis, and Butterfield, and the cinematography is lovely.  My issues with the film were technical, in that I found it bothersome that everyone in the film had British accents, which did sensually detract from the authenticity of the subject matter.  Though it did drag in a few places and could have been shorter as a result, the film manages to bring a new approach to material that is already emotionally charged. The film's perspective actually did break the wall in a manner of speaking, as at one point in the film it switched from what had been Bruno's perspective to a split second of Shmuel's observation, a distraction more than a disruption.

1218901,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001N26GFM,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[0, 0]","Set during the World War II holocaust, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas follows the development of the unlikliest friendship between two little boys - one, a Jewish prisoner at one of the Nazis's extermination camps; the other, the son of the commanding officer of that very camp, who in his childhood innocence knows nothing about what his father really does for a living or the real situation of the war around them (which German children were taught had Germany as the 'good guy' and the Allies as aggressors).Shortly after the boy's father is assigned the new commanding officer of the camp and he and his family relocate there (to an expansive manor - the contrast between the comfortable, supposedly civilized lifestyle of the German officers living right next to a death camp is striking), the boy, Bruno, who spends much of his time alone, comes to a wire fence and meets up with the little boy on the other side of it.  The little boy, Shmuel, is very relucant to say anything of his situation, likely knowing that contact with any non-prisoner is forbidden and would have severe consequences.  Bruno, for his part, is puzzled by the fence and why the other boy wears 'striped pajamas' (the prison garb) all the time, but decides, using innocent eight year-old logic, that all the people on the other side of the fence must be farmers who live there and just dress strangely.  Despite their differences, the two become friends, and Shmuel begins to tell Bruno more of his circumstances.  Bruno brings food to the fence for the under-fed Shmuel, and the two play games through the fence.As Bruno is starting to have doubts about why is his father is running such a place, the rest of the family begins to learn more of the true nature of the camp.  Some seem undisturbed and others horrified, and the question of just when did the German people start to realize what was really going on in a major plot thread.  It's appalling to see the Nazi rationale for their actions, the explanations they give that the people on the other side of the fence ""aren't really people"", the warped propaganda that Bruno and other children are taught during lessons by their tutors.  Eventually, the friendship between Bruno and Shmuel is discovered, although Bruno remains determined to stay loyal to his little friend, leading up to a calamitous and heart-rending end phase of the movie.Briliantly acted and produced, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is meant to be accessible to younger viewers, so not all of the Nazi brutalities are shown as graphically as they might otherwise be, but it's still a harrowing watch in many places, and the clearly implied incidents are as effective as anything shown outright.  Upsetting and with a large focus on humanity's worst side, it also focuses often on far brighter or more positive aspects, including Bruno and Shmuel's friendship and also the reactions of certain other characters.  In the days when the commander's wife thinks the camp is merely a labour camp (as if that wouldn't be bad enough) with reasonably decent living conditions (at one point we see several characters viewing a Nazi propaganda film about the camps, depicting the workers happily going about basic chores during the day and gathering at night for socialization, entertainment, and dining - a ridiculously far cry from the reality, but very similiar to what the Nazi government actually put in its real-life propaganda) she gets to know some of the prisoners who are forced to work around the family estate, and starts to question what life is really like for these people on the other side of the fence.  Bruno's mother is one of the characters who's more sympathetic toward the Jewish people from the beginning, and even as Bruno starts to realize what's really going on, his mother is beginning to figure out the same conclusions on her own.All in all, it's a dark and uncomfortable watch, but one in which certain moments of beauty and power continue to shine through.

And it's a film that is an excellent jumping-off point for discussion with young (10 and above, though the two boys whom the film revolves around are only 9) children about the holocaust - which, all too often, seems to be losing its place in history.I won't go into the detail of the plot as that is covered elsewhere on the Amazon site - and in other reviews. It is also important NOT to know how THIS story ends. (We all know how the holocaust ended.) It gives the film its impact.In the standard ""Making of"" documentary (20 minutes) in the Special Features, we learn from both the Writer/Director, and the author of the book on which the film is based, that they want the film to be watched by families together and used as a discussion tool. The film is rated PG-13 ""for Thematic Material involving the Holocaust"". There is violence in the images of injured people (and the makeup is very graphic) but much is implied. We learn what is going on in the ""work camp"" by seeing fleeting images or hearing sounds.At 94 minutes, the film is brief enough so that children will not get bored. It is NOT a film that, in my opinion, should be watched by children under 16 without a parent or other adult to answer questions they might have, or better yet, ask questions of the children to see that they understand.Miramax made the production in partnership with BBC Films and nearly all the cast are British. (We learn in the documentary that that the woman playing the mother seems to be the sole American among the lead actors.) I did have a small problem at the beginning getting used to the British accents of all these characters who are supposed to be in Germany. (I guess I'm used to actors having German accents in films about the Holocaust.) But, after a while, I accepted it and moved on.I have not listened to the director's commentary. And the deleted scenes included in the bonus features don't add much, but it's good they are included.This is not a perfect film but well worth using as a teaching tool. The more that the younger generation knows about the Holocaust the better the chance that it will never be repeated.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"A different take on the ""holocaust film"" genre",1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2331,"['film', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'go', 'fun', 'not', 'get', 'depressed', 'films', 'are', 'best', 'experienced', 'home', 'film', 'excellent', 'jumping-off', 'point', 'discussion', 'young', '10', 'above', 'two', 'boys', 'whom', 'film', 'around', 'are', 'only', '9', 'children', 'holocaust', 'too', 'often', 'be', 'losing', 'place', 'history.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'plot', 'covered', 'elsewhere', 'Amazon', 'site', 'other', 'reviews', 'also', 'important', 'NOT', 'know', 'how', 'THIS', 'story', 'know', 'how', 'holocaust', 'ended', 'film', 'impact.In', 'standard', 'Making', 'documentary', '20', 'minutes', 'Special', 'Features', 'learn', 'Writer/Director', 'author', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'want', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'families', 'together', 'used', 'discussion', 'tool', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'Thematic', 'Material', 'involving', 'Holocaust', 'violence', 'images', 'injured', 'people', 'makeup', 'very', 'graphic', 'much', 'implied', 'learn', 'what', 'going', 'work', 'camp', 'seeing', 'fleeting', 'images', 'hearing', 'sounds.At', '94', 'minutes', 'film', 'brief', 'enough', 'children', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'NOT', 'film', 'opinion', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'children', '16', 'parent', 'other', 'adult', 'answer', 'questions', 'might', 'have', 'better', 'yet', 'ask', 'questions', 'children', 'see', 'understand.Miramax', 'made', 'production', 'partnership', 'BBC', 'Films', 'nearly', 'cast', 'are', 'British', 'learn', 'documentary', 'woman', 'playing', 'mother', 'be', 'sole', 'American', 'lead', 'actors', 'did', 'have', 'small', 'problem', 'beginning', 'getting', 'used', 'British', 'accents', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Germany', 'guess', ""'m"", 'used', 'actors', 'having', 'German', 'accents', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'while', 'accepted', 'moved', 'on.I', 'have', 'not', 'listened', 'director', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'bonus', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'good', 'are', 'included.This', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'using', 'teaching', 'tool', 'more', 'younger', 'generation', 'Holocaust', 'better', 'chance', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'repeated.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

1218907,AZBMTXXNPS6YD,B001N26GFM,"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com""","[7, 11]","""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a Holocaust movie from an intriguing point of view: that of an eight year-old boy. Bruno witnesses acts that must seem bizarre to a child who is struggling to comprehend that adults--even one's own father--can be evil. The proximity of innocence makes the acts of cruelty even more nauseating, even if they aren't of the same epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" or ""The Pianist"". Bruno is the very embodiment of curiosity, and luckily he questions the judgment of those who should know better.He moves into the country near a concentration camp and befriends a young boy who is supposedly the ""enemy"". But instead of pandering to racist rhetoric and being influenced by brainwashed Nazis, he comes to his own conclusions. Is the Jewish boy evil? Has he done anything mean to Bruno? Gradually Bruno realizes that his world is surrounded by lies--the internment camp is not a happy place, the shaved-head boy is not a grubby rodent, and perhaps his father's weaselly smile is hiding something sinister. In fact, Bruno proves to be less of a loyal friend than his imprisoned counterpart, denying knowledge of their friendship, which ultimately torments him and perhaps takes the first painful step toward building his conscience. If the movie had adhered to this formula, it would have been miraculous. But it takes a strange twist at the end...WARNING SPOILERS HEAD! ACHTUNG! CUIDADO!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY WATCHED THE MOVIE! YOU THERE!! THE ONE DROOLING ALL OVER HIS KEYBOARD AFTER MY REVIEW SENT HIM INTO A STATE OF CATATONIA...OR IS IT NARCOLEPSY? AT LEAST THEN THERE WOULD BE A MEDICAL EXCUSE FOR SOMEONE FALLING ASLEEP WHEN READING THIS...ANYWAY......that seems out of synch with the rest of the movie. The movie builds quietly, with subtle skill, then becomes overwhelmingly tragic. The slow-burning tone erupts into a cataclysm. I am at a loss to understand the director's intent. Or, since this movie is based on a children's book, I am confused as to the author's motivation. Is it that the sins of the father are eventually paid upon his son? Bruno sneaking into the camp certainly reveals his character's sense of adventure, and trying to find his friend's father reveals a desire to seek atonement for his recent betrayal, but the ending still seems murky. Is Bruno's father going to renounce the horrors of anti-Semitism after stumbling upon the body of his son, who has choked on Zyklon-B? Is it an accusation against the mother, who knows that her husband is presiding over hell, yet refuses to steal his children away from him? Is Bruno the sacrificial lamb, suffocating on toxic vapor so his sister will learn a lesson? Am I reading too far into this? Does every movie need to have a profound message? Am I too dumb to fathom it?The very fact that I have so many questions makes me suspect the ending was emotionally powerful but logically muddled. The heavy-handedness of it actually took away some of its emotional impact. I was more moved by Bruno's guilt over betraying his friend than I was when he huddled in the shower stall, waiting for a cascade of water that became lung-drowning cyanide. Bruno didn't have to die for the movie to be heartbreaking. His death only makes me scratch my head and wonder why a generous, kind-hearted boy has to strangle to give the film validity.",3,Sins of the Fathers...,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,3349,"['Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'point', 'view', 'eight', 'year-old', 'boy', 'Bruno', 'must', 'seem', 'bizarre', 'child', 'who', 'struggling', 'comprehend', 'adults', 'even', 'one', 'own', 'father', 'can', 'be', 'evil', 'proximity', 'innocence', 'acts', 'cruelty', 'even', 'more', 'nauseating', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'epic', 'scope', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Pianist', 'Bruno', 'very', 'embodiment', 'curiosity', 'luckily', 'questions', 'judgment', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'better.He', 'moves', 'country', 'concentration', 'camp', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'supposedly', 'enemy', 'instead', 'pandering', 'racist', 'rhetoric', 'being', 'influenced', 'brainwashed', 'Nazis', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'evil', 'done', 'anything', 'mean', 'Bruno', 'Gradually', 'Bruno', 'world', 'surrounded', 'lies', 'internment', 'camp', 'not', 'happy', 'place', 'shaved-head', 'boy', 'not', 'grubby', 'rodent', 'perhaps', 'father', 'weaselly', 'smile', 'hiding', 'something', 'sinister', 'fact', 'Bruno', 'be', 'less', 'loyal', 'friend', 'imprisoned', 'counterpart', 'denying', 'knowledge', 'friendship', 'ultimately', 'perhaps', 'first', 'painful', 'step', 'building', 'conscience', 'movie', 'had', 'adhered', 'formula', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'miraculous', 'strange', 'twist', 'end', 'WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'HEAD', 'ACHTUNG', 'CUIDADO', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'ALREADY', 'WATCHED', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'YOU', 'THERE', 'ONE', 'DROOLING', 'ALL', 'HIS', 'KEYBOARD', 'AFTER', 'MY', 'REVIEW', 'SENT', 'HIM', 'INTO', 'A', 'STATE', 'OF', 'CATATONIA', 'OR', 'IT', 'NARCOLEPSY', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'THEN', 'THERE', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'A', 'MEDICAL', 'EXCUSE', 'FOR', 'SOMEONE', 'FALLING', 'ASLEEP', 'WHEN', 'READING', 'THIS', 'ANYWAY', 'synch', 'rest', 'movie', 'movie', 'quietly', 'subtle', 'skill', 'then', 'overwhelmingly', 'tragic', 'slow-burning', 'tone', 'cataclysm', 'am', 'loss', 'understand', 'director', 'intent', 'movie', 'based', 'children', 'book', 'am', 'confused', 'author', 'motivation', 'sins', 'father', 'are', 'eventually', 'paid', 'son', 'Bruno', 'sneaking', 'camp', 'certainly', 'character', 'sense', 'adventure', 'trying', 'find', 'friend', 'father', 'desire', 'seek', 'atonement', 'recent', 'betrayal', 'ending', 'still', 'murky', 'Bruno', 'father', 'going', 'renounce', 'horrors', 'anti-Semitism', 'stumbling', 'body', 'son', 'who', 'choked', 'Zyklon-B', 'accusation', 'mother', 'who', 'husband', 'presiding', 'over', 'hell', 'yet', 'steal', 'children', 'away', 'Bruno', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'suffocating', 'toxic', 'vapor', 'sister', 'will', 'learn', 'lesson', 'Am', 'reading', 'too', 'far', 'movie', 'need', 'have', 'profound', 'message', 'Am', 'too', 'dumb', 'fathom', 'very', 'fact', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'suspect', 'ending', 'was', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'logically', 'muddled', 'heavy-handedness', 'actually', 'took', 'away', 'emotional', 'impact', 'was', 'more', 'moved', 'Bruno', 'guilt', 'betraying', 'friend', 'was', 'when', 'huddled', 'shower', 'stall', 'waiting', 'cascade', 'water', 'became', 'lung-drowning', 'cyanide', 'Bruno', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'die', 'movie', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'death', 'only', 'scratch', 'head', 'wonder', 'why', 'generous', 'kind-hearted', 'boy', 'strangle', 'give', 'film', 'validity']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
1218908,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B001N26GFM,susannah,"[3, 3]","I also have seen many movies about the Holocaust, and this one stands out immensely, by quietly showing the apathy and deceit required of supposedly civilized people, shown in different ways by Bruno's parents. I have read a number of comments that think Bruno was more than a little dim for not getting it, while supposedly Bruno's mother knew nothing about what was really going on at the camps, and I read no comments on that. It would be interesting to me to read an account, an honest account, of what it was like for a Nazi family and how they lived, knowing what was going on. A child knows only what they have been taught, they believe their parents more than anyone in the world, and since all Bruno was told was lies, of course he is going to believe them and want to believe them. He struggled with wanting to love and honor his father and starting to doubt him. The child was only eight! Even though he was seeing the camp with his own eyes, he didn't really know what was going on, no child who had been sheltered and deceived would. The same with Gretel, who also only knew what they wanted her to know, and had not the experience to know better. The Hitler Youth was immensely successful in indoctrination of the children because they are so vulnerable and impressionable.I was sickened when the elderly man was beaten to death in front of the children and no one moved a muscle, and I seriously suspected the actual cause of the grandmother's death, bombing or not, since she was vocally opposed to the Reich. I feared for the life and health of Bruno's mother as well, and don't think the father, brutal and committed to the Reich, would just let her walk away with his children.The ending was immensely powerful, yet I wanted it to have impact on the father other than just personally, otherwise, I didn't see the point. The worst monster can love his child.I don't think it was Auschwitz, which held thousands of people. This one seemed very small, more like a work camp, and not all of them were killing camps, other than by starvation and disease, etc.The boy that played Schmuel was the sweetest boy and his scenes just broke my heart.",5,Excellent film!!,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,2157,"['also', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'movies', 'Holocaust', 'one', 'out', 'immensely', 'quietly', 'showing', 'apathy', 'deceit', 'required', 'supposedly', 'civilized', 'people', 'shown', 'different', 'ways', 'Bruno', 'parents', 'have', 'read', 'number', 'comments', 'think', 'Bruno', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'dim', 'not', 'getting', 'supposedly', 'Bruno', 'mother', 'knew', 'nothing', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'camps', 'read', 'comments', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'read', 'account', 'honest', 'account', 'what', 'was', 'Nazi', 'family', 'how', 'lived', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'child', 'only', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'believe', 'parents', 'more', 'anyone', 'world', 'Bruno', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'lies', 'course', 'going', 'believe', 'want', 'believe', 'struggled', 'wanting', 'love', 'honor', 'father', 'starting', 'doubt', 'child', 'was', 'only', 'eight', 'Even', 'was', 'seeing', 'camp', 'own', 'eyes', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'child', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'sheltered', 'deceived', 'would', 'same', 'Gretel', 'who', 'also', 'only', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'know', 'had', 'not', 'experience', 'know', 'better', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'was', 'immensely', 'successful', 'indoctrination', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'impressionable.I', 'was', 'sickened', 'when', 'elderly', 'man', 'was', 'beaten', 'death', 'front', 'children', 'one', 'moved', 'muscle', 'seriously', 'suspected', 'actual', 'cause', 'grandmother', 'death', 'bombing', 'not', 'was', 'vocally', 'opposed', 'Reich', 'feared', 'life', 'health', 'Bruno', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'father', 'brutal', 'committed', 'Reich', 'would', 'just', 'let', 'walk', 'away', 'children.The', 'ending', 'was', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'yet', 'wanted', 'have', 'impact', 'father', 'other', 'just', 'personally', 'otherwise', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'worst', 'monster', 'can', 'love', 'child.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'Auschwitz', 'held', 'thousands', 'people', 'one', 'seemed', 'very', 'small', 'more', 'work', 'camp', 'not', 'were', 'killing', 'camps', 'other', 'starvation', 'disease', 'boy', 'played', 'Schmuel', 'was', 'sweetest', 'boy', 'scenes', 'just', 'broke', 'heart']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

The movie is the journey of the family from big city life out to a concentration camp in the country side.The mother is kept in the dark about the actual goings on.  The main story is about a curious boy who can't stand to be stuck in his house.  He is an adventurer who ends up finding out that there is a ""camp"" near his house.

The other is the reminder that the top Nazis were often loving and devoted parents, yet they committed some of the vilest atrocities in history. We tend to demonise the Nazis, but the fact is that these monstrous deeds were not committed by aliens from another planet but by people from one of Europe's most civilised countries. Fanaticism of any kind, religious, political, racial, is a terrible thing.However, for me, these are not enough to save the film, which, even to my inexpert eyes, seems ridiculously contrived.Kids in Nazi Germany were indoctrinated from an early age. A kid such as Bruno, son of a senior officer in the Totenkopf SS, would have received an especially big dose of teaching against the evils of pernicious Jewry. Such a child would have run a mile rather than come anywhere near a Jew, never mind actually befriend one. On the other hand, Jewish kids in what appears to be a ""Vernichtungslager"" (extermination camp) had a minute life expectancy - as useless mouths incapable of working usefully in the work camps associated with the Vernichtungslager, they usually went straight from the train into THAT queue. To find a feeble bit of non-electrified fence with no guard towers just out the back of the commandant's house and for a Jewish kid to find a job that apparently consists of pushing around an empty wheelbarrow, well, it's all too absurd. Not to mention that Shmuel is apparently a German Jew, so Bruno and he have a common language. All the Vernichtungslager were in Poland, and took Jews from all over occupied Europe.

But the filmmakers do a clever thing and mask the idealization through the eyes of an 8-year-old boy, who doesn't, and probably couldn't, know the truth. But the more I think about it, is this a good thing? And who is the audience for this film?Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a pretty typical 8-year-old boy. He enjoys playing with his friends and finds the family's huge Berlin house to be fertile for his imagination; Bruno and his friends run through the hallways and up and down the staircase with abandon. Bruno's mom (Vera Farmiga, ""The Departed"", ""Breaking and Entering"") and dad (David Thewlis, the ""Harry Potter"" films) sit their children down and tell them about Father's new promotion, a promotion which means they must move to a new house in the country. Father is a German officer and his promotion has been to run a Concentration Camp. But Bruno and his older sister don't know this and they cautiously roam through the new house. Bruno spots a ""farm"" from his bedroom window and inquires about the ""funny people"" wearing striped pajamas. Mama is confused, but soon realizes what he has seen and quickly boards up his bedroom window. Desperate for some adventure, Bruno eventually sneaks into the back garden and further, moving through the lush plants and overgrown grass until he comes to the electrified fence surrounding the ""farm"". There, he spots a boy, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) sitting on the other side of the fence, staring into his hands, and they talk. A friendship quickly blooms leading Bruno to try to get away everyday and sneak food to his new friend.As Bruno runs through the fields, the director seems to have placed a filter on the lens to capture as much dappled sunlight as possible. This stretches the believability of the story quite a bit. But just as I felt myself about to switch off, I realized, or remembered that Bruno is only eight. His parents have kept him sheltered from the truth and he doesn't have any idea of what is going on.But does this make it OK to watch such an idealized view of such a horrific event? Even such a small part of such a horrific event?Obviously, this story isn't going to have a happy ending. But the extent of this ending shocked me and made the film more powerful erasing many doubts.On the one hand, ""Striped Pajamas"" almost wants to be a bedtime story. On the other hand, it tries to tell a moving story that will tug at your heart, trying to get you to cry. But both efforts are just slightly off. When I researched the director, David Herman, and found that he had directed both ""Brassed Off"", starring Ewan McGregor and Pete Posthelwaite and ""Little Voice"" starring Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine, some things clicked into place. Each of these films has various elements that work, but they are all slightly off. Like something isn't clicking into place. Like the director doesn't have enough skill to recognize there is a problem, or the skill to correct the problem and connect all of the dots. Each film is missing something to connect the dots.There is an attempt to bring home the horrors of the situation. Mama (Farmiga) knows they are moving to a house on the outskirts of a concentration camp, she knows what her husband is about to undertake, but she doesn't realize the extent of the job. The moment of realization is powerful, but it comes early and is followed by a lot of erratic behavior. Mama also spends a lot of time frowning or looking worried as she realizes Bruno might eventually learn the truth or as she watches her daughter begin to embrace the Third Reich, joining the youth movement.The behavior seems to have no effect on Bruno, because he doesn't know or understand what is going on.Because the children are living in the country, Papa hires a tutor for them. We watch as the tutor attempts to teach the two kids the party line, instilling in them the propaganda leading to the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich. At one point, Bruno spies on a secret meeting and watches a propaganda film about how great life in the camps is. These are very interesting moments, but they don't really seem to open up little Bruno's eyes. Since we are following Bruno through this journey, it is difficult for us to watch, as he doesn't seem to come to any realizations.The main problem seems to be the choice of an 8 year old as our guide through this story. ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"" is aimed at adults who go to foreign films, adults who like Merchant Ivory films, adults who like historical period pieces. So why an 8 year old? Are the filmmakers trying to attract children? To make the film seem more like a bedtime story? I really don't think so, but you have to wonder. If any children of this age actually watch this film, I think they might have nightmares. When the story finally shifts and the events begin to become more horrific, the children will have questions. Questions that you will have to answer and the answers will most likely scare the children.But the film doesn't exactly work as a story strictly for adults. Because Bruno never sees any of the consequences of what his father is doing, what his country is doing, he remains oblivious. It is almost as though the filmmakers want us to fill in the blanks, leaving the horror to our imagination. And this works to a certain extent, but because Bruno is our guide into this world, he needs to see some of this as well. When a friendly old Jew, a former doctor, who works in the house suddenly disappears, Bruno asks about him and his sister responds ""He's not coming back"" with an attitude indicating he should know better. We know better. But Bruno wouldn't.But the filmmakers temper this lack of awareness in two ways. Bruno is very young. And his lack of realization leads him to a very problematic end.Vera Farmiga is good as Mama. As soon as she realizes what is going on in the camp, she becomes emotionally troubled and can't accept what her husband is doing. Unfortunately, this leads her to sit around with red eyes, swing on a tire swing for hours, and to act like a crazy person, causing her husband a lot of problems. The role is a bit over the top and theatrical, but as she is the only person who seems to realize the horror, it works.David Thewlis is also good as Papa, an officer in the German army who accepts his new promotion with pride. He shows a believable lack of emotion and a credible amount of stern authority. Thankfully, he plays the character pretty even keel, staying away from histrionics.Even though the performances are good, this is yet another film set during World War II in which the majority of the characters speak with British accents. Yes, the film is directed by a Brit, and co-produced by the BBC. But try to go for some authenticity and make the characters at least sound like they are German. In the upcoming ""Valkyrie"", it appears that Tom Cruise doesn't attempt any accent along with all of his British co-stars.""The Boy in The Striped Pajamas"" suffers from an inconsistent, mixed

I must say I prefer the book as the movie did take some liberties even though it followed the story closely.The entire subject of the concentration camps is so horrific, but this story transcends the horror andshows the importance of true friendships and how innocent young children often do not carry the baggage and hatreds we grow to accept as adults.

It involves a friendship that comes from the most unlikely of places, and ends with a tragedy that involves droves of Jews and one German boy. While I will not say exactly what happens, I will say that feeling bad for this one boy seems to be a bad thing in some ways because I felt sorry for him only because of the way he was presented. His father was the director of a camp that kills Jews, his family a beast filled with blind followers, and one boy looking into the Jewish camps and wondering why he wasn't allowed to play the game the Jews were allowed to play.As far as movies go, the movie was done well and shows something about the youth of a country that killed at leisure. There is the confusion, the wonder, the want to help, and all of the ignorance that youth can breed. It accomplishes everything it sets out to do, too, making you feel sorrow when the curtain comes down. I hope that the movie was also meant to make a person examine this sorrow they felt, knowing that the word genocide is associated with the thing they just watched. The other people in the striped pajamas were not props but were instead reminders of people that were going to die a horrid death, and yet one boy on the wrong side of the fence was the thing that we were watching. His life, his actions, his family's sorrow; these things were the things we saw. What we did not see were the pieces that were missing from the puzzle; the families that could not cry because they were no longer anything save ash mistaken for snow on the breeze.Do I recommend the movie? I'm not sure. I do know that I liked the movie, that it moved me, but I'm not sure it moved me in the way it was supposed to. It has a complexity to it, one that I hope people do not miss, but that several newspaper reviews seemed to lose in their interpretation of the movie.

The acting was superb.  However, I found it a bit awkward that the little Jewish boy had a touch of an English accent.  I don't know, maybe it was just me.  I think the actor that played the father, although he was quite good as an actor, I didn't buy his German character.  Now if they got someone like Liam Neeson, man that would've been much better.What I like about this story is that it doesn't give you everything right up front.

Bruno's father is a German military officer and one day because of his father's ""job,"" Bruno and his family move from the city to a home in a countryside, where Bruno finds a ""farm"" behind the forest. There, behind the fences of the ""farm,"" Bruno meets a boy named Shmuel and befriends this ""boy in the striped pyjamas.""We know this ""farm"" is really a Nazi Germany's concentration camp, but Bruno doesn't. You can say ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas,"" based on a 2006 bestselling novel by John Boyne, is about Holocaust seen from a German boy. And he is not just a boy; he is a son of the officer who is in charge of the concentration camp. For Bruno, a Nazi's propaganda film showing the inside of the concentration camp IS the truth.No one can deny the impact of the film's devastating climax, but the story up to the point, especially the part about the two boys, look forced and artificial. To their credits the young actors did a very good job, but to believe their friendship and its tragic consequences, we also have to believe that a prisoner like Shmuel is allowed to roam in the concentration camp (with no guards around the fences). I know the film is based on a novel, but even so, I find some of the premises of the film (besides the English-speaking cast playing Germans) hard to swallow.David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga are fine as Bruno's parents and Benot Delhomme's photography with muted colors is a plus for the film, which is emotionally stunning, but not perfectly convincing.",3,Emotionally Stunning; Story Not Perfectly Convincing,1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,1632,"['Boy', 'Striped', 'Pyjamas', 'set', 'WWII', '9-year-old', 'boy', 'Bruno', 'playing', 'friends', 'street', 'Berlin', 'Bruno', 'father', 'German', 'military', 'officer', 'one', 'day', 'father', 'job', 'Bruno', 'family', 'move', 'city', 'home', 'countryside', 'where', 'Bruno', 'farm', 'forest', 'fences', 'farm', 'Bruno', 'boy', 'named', 'Shmuel', 'boy', 'striped', 'pyjamas', 'know', 'farm', 'really', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Bruno', ""n't"", 'can', 'say', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pyjamas', 'based', '2006', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'John', 'Boyne', 'Holocaust', 'seen', 'German', 'boy', 'not', 'just', 'boy', 'son', 'officer', 'who', 'charge', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Bruno', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'film', 'showing', 'inside', 'concentration', 'camp', 'truth.No', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'impact', 'film', 'devastating', 'climax', 'story', 'up', 'point', 'especially', 'part', 'two', 'boys', 'look', 'forced', 'artificial', 'credits', 'young', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'believe', 'friendship', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'also', 'have', 'believe', 'prisoner', 'Shmuel', 'allowed', 'roam', 'concentration', 'camp', 'guards', 'fences', 'know', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'even', 'so', 'find', 'premises', 'film', 'English-speaking', 'cast', 'playing', 'Germans', 'hard', 'swallow.David', 'Thewlis', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'are', 'fine', 'Bruno', 'parents', 'Benot', 'Delhomme', 'photography', 'muted', 'colors', 'plus', 'film', 'emotionally', 'stunning', 'not', 'perfectly', 'convincing']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

Unfortunate events surrounding the time of World War II are portrayed in both blatant and subtle ways from the 8 year-old Bruno's perspective. He remains oblivious to the turbulence of the politics and war. He can see signs of violence (treatment of Pavel by the soldier, treatment of the soldier by Bruno's own father, the 'horrible smell' etc) but he is too young to guess or understand exactly what is going on. He makes friends with a Jewish boy Shmuel in the 'farm' and joins him to find Schmuel's missing father. He meets his death along with untold number of people in the 'shower room'.It is for the movie watcher to decide if Bruno's father, the administrator of the 'farm' learned his lesson as a human being. Many such scenes in the movie provoke the audience to think and rethink. The 'soft' side of Bruno's father comes to light when he, upon insistence of his wife, decides to send his children away from the 'camp' area.

While the name of the death camp is not mentioned, the only death camp with four crematoriums was Auschwitz. His wife, daughter, and son come with him. The house chosen for the Commandant's family is a far stretch from the high society living in Berlin and the  ""help"" are Jews imprisoned in a close by camp. At first glance, Bruno, the 8-yr old son calls the camp a farm and proceeds to befriend an 8 yr old Jew named Smule while exploring. Through the electical fence they begin to communicate, both talking about their present environments. Gretl, the daughter, befriends a young SS soldier who brings her Nazi magazines which eventually cover the walls of her bedroom. Both Bruno and Gretl are tutored by an elder teacher who educates them on select German history. It is clear the Commandants wife, Else, just wants a good home for her family. One day the young SS soldier vaguely comments that the smell coming from the nearby Chimneys are Jews burning. Else is sickened by this admission and confronts her husband. Else represents the German polis that had no clue to the final solution and finds herself in a nation and a place she detests. She has ample compassion however to genuinely thank a prisoner who used to be a physician who took care of her son in a fall.The Commandants mother, who vocally did not support the Hitler regime dies in a bombing campaign. The Fuhrer has sent a card of regret which lays on her corpse before being placed in the ground. Else motions to remove the card but her husband moves her hand away swiftly. Meanwhile, Bruno continues to bring food to Smule. One day to Bruno's surprise Smule is in his house cleaning glassware. They greet each other as friends and Smule is offered pastry. The young SS soldier comes in demanding where Smule got the pastry. Bruno did not back up his friend out of fear and Smule pays the price. The next time Bruno saw Smule he had an injury to his eye. To make up for the betrayal Bruno agrees to search for Smule's father who is missing. This event would have to happen quickly as Else persuaded her husband to let her take the children away from the camp. Bruno took a sandwich and headed for the camp. Smule gave Bruno a set of ""striped pajamas"" and Bruno came through the fence by digging a hole. The young boys go running thru the camp looking for Smule's father. In the midst of this it starts to rain and a group of men and boys are rounded up and taken to the fake shower room. Bruno and Smule are in this group. They are made to undress and are herded into the gas chamber. The gas chamber door is bolted shut. After about five minutes the verbal quakes are silenced. Meanwhile, Bruno's family searches vociferously in fear and eventually finds Bruno's clothes. Else is inconsolable. The Commandant runs through the camp but comes to the reality that Bruno, his son, was gassed. The Commandant's expression is trance-like as the rain pours down on his clean pressed SS uniform.",5,Powerful,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,3056,"['SS', 'Officer', 'Berlin', 'promotion', 'heads', 'country', 'command', 'death', 'camp', 'name', 'death', 'camp', 'not', 'mentioned', 'only', 'death', 'camp', 'four', 'crematoriums', 'was', 'Auschwitz', 'wife', 'daughter', 'son', 'come', 'house', 'chosen', 'Commandant', 'family', 'far', 'stretch', 'high', 'society', 'living', 'Berlin', 'help', 'are', 'Jews', 'imprisoned', 'close', 'camp', 'first', 'glance', 'Bruno', '8-yr', 'old', 'son', 'camp', 'farm', 'proceeds', 'befriend', '8', 'yr', 'old', 'Jew', 'named', 'Smule', 'exploring', 'electical', 'fence', 'begin', 'communicate', 'talking', 'present', 'environments', 'Gretl', 'daughter', 'young', 'SS', 'soldier', 'who', 'Nazi', 'magazines', 'eventually', 'walls', 'bedroom', 'Bruno', 'Gretl', 'are', 'tutored', 'elder', 'teacher', 'who', 'select', 'German', 'history', 'clear', 'Commandants', 'wife', 'Else', 'just', 'good', 'home', 'family', 'One', 'day', 'young', 'SS', 'soldier', 'vaguely', 'comments', 'smell', 'coming', 'nearby', 'Chimneys', 'are', 'Jews', 'burning', 'Else', 'sickened', 'admission', 'husband', 'Else', 'German', 'polis', 'had', 'clue', 'final', 'solution', 'nation', 'place', 'ample', 'compassion', 'however', 'genuinely', 'thank', 'prisoner', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'physician', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'son', 'fall.The', 'Commandants', 'mother', 'who', 'vocally', 'did', 'not', 'support', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'dies', 'bombing', 'campaign', 'Fuhrer', 'sent', 'card', 'regret', 'corpse', 'being', 'placed', 'ground', 'Else', 'motions', 'remove', 'card', 'husband', 'hand', 'away', 'swiftly', 'Meanwhile', 'Bruno', 'bring', 'food', 'Smule', 'One', 'day', 'Bruno', 'surprise', 'Smule', 'house', 'cleaning', 'glassware', 'greet', 'other', 'friends', 'Smule', 'offered', 'pastry', 'young', 'SS', 'soldier', 'demanding', 'where', 'Smule', 'got', 'pastry', 'Bruno', 'did', 'not', 'back', 'up', 'friend', 'fear', 'Smule', 'price', 'next', 'time', 'Bruno', 'saw', 'Smule', 'had', 'injury', 'eye', 'make', 'up', 'betrayal', 'Bruno', 'search', 'Smule', 'father', 'who', 'missing', 'event', 'would', 'have', 'happen', 'quickly', 'Else', 'persuaded', 'husband', 'let', 'take', 'children', 'away', 'camp', 'Bruno', 'took', 'sandwich', 'headed', 'camp', 'Smule', 'gave', 'Bruno', 'set', 'striped', 'pajamas', 'Bruno', 'came', 'fence', 'digging', 'hole', 'young', 'boys', 'go', 'running', 'thru', 'camp', 'looking', 'Smule', 'father', 'midst', 'rain', 'group', 'men', 'boys', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'taken', 'fake', 'shower', 'room', 'Bruno', 'Smule', 'are', 'group', 'are', 'made', 'undress', 'are', 'herded', 'gas', 'chamber', 'gas', 'chamber', 'door', 'bolted', 'shut', 'five', 'minutes', 'verbal', 'quakes', 'are', 'silenced', 'Meanwhile', 'Bruno', 'family', 'vociferously', 'fear', 'eventually', 'Bruno', 'clothes', 'Else', 'inconsolable', 'Commandant', 'camp', 'reality', 'Bruno', 'son', 'was', 'gassed', 'Commandant', 'expression', 'trance-like', 'rain', 'down', 'clean', 'pressed', 'SS', 'uniform']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas

Ironically she compared this movie to the slaves of the Civil War, however as I told her the Slaves were treated much better than the Jewish people during World War II.  This movie from start to finish is incredible, I did cry at the end of this movie for I had heard of the endinng prior to watching the movie, and I had heard of the horror of the work camps first hand from friends who were in Europe during Hitler's rein.  Sadly after watching this, I do wonder why no member of The Academy never acknowledged this film.  The actors were all first class, the screen play was great.  I just wish the movie wasn't based upon a true scenario of the 20th century.

1218925,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001N26GFM,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I've read the book upon which this movie is based, and also reviewed it. The book makes for a thoughtful discussion on the Holocaust, though it did have some problems having to do with plot implausibilities. Yet despite all of that, I did think the book added some value to novels dealing with the Holocaust, especially in portraying the story from the 8-year-old German Aryan boy's point of view.Now on to the movie - the story follows the book closely with some adaptations. Set during WW II, 8-year-old German Aryan, Bruno finds his carefree life in Berlin is about to come to an end as his father [David Thelis] has been promoted to the position of Kommandant thus necessitating the family's move to a rural outpost which is nameless. So, Bruno [Asa Butterfield], his 12-year-old sister Gretel [Amber Beattie], mother [Vera Farmiga] and dad make the move. Bruno is initially not impressed with his new surroundings - there are no other houses nearby and the children are not able to attend school, having to be taught by an old tutor who very much subscribes to Nazi ideology, pummeling the children with his ideology of hatred every chance he gets. Young Bruno in the meantime has discovered a 'farm' close by and to his immense delight, meets another 8-year-old boy with the curious name of Schmuel [Jack Scanlon] who seems to have tons of 'friends' and has the luxury of wearing 'pajamas' all day. Though he is forbidden to explore the back of the house, Bruno makes clandestine visits to his friend, who sadly cannot play with him as they are separated by a barbed wire fence, which Bruno thinks is to keep the animals out. The pairs friendship grows every day, and Bruno begins to discover certain things - that Jews are not treated well [he doesn't really buy the ""Jews are evil"" idea], and begins to see his father in a different light [the Kommandant keeps silent when a Jewish houseworker is pummeled by a sadistic Nazi underling]. In the meantime, Bruno's mother Ilse [Vera Farmiga] begins to fall apart as she comes to discover what really goes on in the camps [extermination of Jews] and suffers an emotional breakdown. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Bruno and Schmuel and the others.There are some plot implausibilities - the fact that Bruno is so incredibly naive about Jews and the ideology of hatred against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings. Bruno being a high-ranking Nazi officer's son would most certainly have been in the Hitler Youth as would his sister. Also, Ilse not knowing of what was going on in the camp [extermination] also seems implausible. As for Schmuel, most young children were immediately selected for the gas chambers upon arrival, and it seems almost miraculous that Schmuel survived for as long as he did, and was able to meet Bruno so often without detection.But, implausibilities aside, I still liked this movie - it manages to portray the innocence of children in a depraved world so very credibly, and this is largely due to Asa Butterfield's amazing performance as the naive Bruno whose eyes are slowly 'opened' to the cruelty evident around him. Jack Scanlon's Schmuel is also credible -the chemistry between the two boys is very real, and their friendship is altogether believable, even the part when Bruno 'betrays' his friend and Schmuel's reaction to this. Vera Farmiga's performance as the tormented Ilse is the most powerful adult performance in this movie - she delivers a finely-nuanced performance that makes us believe Ilse was truly horrified by what was being done to the Jews. The other adult male characters delivered rather weak performances - David Thewlis as the Kommandant was stiff in his role and seemed ill at ease for the most part, the sadistic Nazi driver seemed very much a one-dimensional character, and even the Jewish houseworker was not given much character development.All in all, ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing. The child actors' powerful performances enables the movie to address questions about humanity and man's capacity for evil.",4,Amazing performances make this a compelling Holocaust drama,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,4278,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'also', 'reviewed', 'book', 'thoughtful', 'discussion', 'Holocaust', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'having', 'do', 'plot', 'implausibilities', 'did', 'think', 'book', 'added', 'value', 'novels', 'dealing', 'Holocaust', 'especially', 'portraying', 'story', '8-year-old', 'German', 'Aryan', 'boy', 'point', 'view.Now', 'movie', 'story', 'book', 'closely', 'adaptations', 'Set', 'WW', 'II', '8-year-old', 'German', 'Aryan', 'Bruno', 'carefree', 'life', 'Berlin', 'come', 'end', 'father', '[', 'David', 'Thelis', ']', 'been', 'promoted', 'position', 'Kommandant', 'thus', 'necessitating', 'family', 'move', 'rural', 'outpost', 'nameless', 'So', 'Bruno', '[', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', ']', '12-year-old', 'sister', 'Gretel', '[', 'Amber', 'Beattie', ']', 'mother', '[', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', ']', 'dad', 'make', 'move', 'Bruno', 'initially', 'not', 'impressed', 'new', 'surroundings', 'are', 'other', 'houses', 'nearby', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'attend', 'school', 'having', 'be', 'taught', 'old', 'tutor', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'subscribes', 'Nazi', 'ideology', 'pummeling', 'children', 'ideology', 'hatred', 'chance', 'Young', 'Bruno', 'meantime', 'discovered', ""'farm"", 'close', 'immense', 'delight', '8-year-old', 'boy', 'curious', 'name', 'Schmuel', '[', 'Jack', 'Scanlon', ']', 'who', 'have', 'tons', ""'friends"", 'luxury', 'wearing', ""'pajamas"", 'day', 'forbidden', 'explore', 'back', 'house', 'Bruno', 'clandestine', 'visits', 'friend', 'who', 'sadly', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'are', 'separated', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'Bruno', 'keep', 'animals', 'out', 'pairs', 'friendship', 'grows', 'day', 'Bruno', 'discover', 'certain', 'things', 'Jews', 'are', 'not', 'treated', 'well', ""n't"", 'really', 'buy', 'Jews', 'are', 'evil', 'idea', ']', 'see', 'father', 'different', 'light', 'Kommandant', 'silent', 'when', 'Jewish', 'houseworker', 'pummeled', 'sadistic', 'Nazi', 'underling', ']', 'meantime', 'Bruno', 'mother', 'Ilse', '[', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', ']', 'fall', 'apart', 'discover', 'what', 'really', 'camps', '[', 'extermination', 'Jews', ']', 'suffers', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'rest', 'story', 'deals', 'what', 'Bruno', 'Schmuel', 'others.There', 'are', 'plot', 'implausibilities', 'fact', 'Bruno', 'so', 'incredibly', 'naive', 'Jews', 'ideology', 'hatred', 'hard', 'accept', 'only', 'most', 'German', 'Aryan', 'boys', 'Bruno', 'age', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'thus', 'exposed', 'such', 'teachings', 'Bruno', 'being', 'high-ranking', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'son', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'would', 'sister', 'Also', 'Ilse', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'camp', '[', 'extermination', ']', 'also', 'implausible', 'Schmuel', 'most', 'young', 'children', 'were', 'immediately', 'selected', 'gas', 'chambers', 'arrival', 'almost', 'miraculous', 'Schmuel', 'survived', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'was', 'able', 'meet', 'Bruno', 'so', 'often', 'detection.But', 'implausibilities', 'aside', 'still', 'liked', 'movie', 'portray', 'innocence', 'children', 'depraved', 'world', 'so', 'very', 'credibly', 'largely', 'due', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'amazing', 'performance', 'naive', 'Bruno', 'eyes', 'are', 'slowly', ""'opened"", 'cruelty', 'evident', 'Jack', 'Scanlon', 'Schmuel', 'also', 'credible', '-the', 'chemistry', 'two', 'boys', 'very', 'real', 'friendship', 'altogether', 'believable', 'even', 'part', 'when', 'Bruno', 'friend', 'Schmuel', 'reaction', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'performance', 'tormented', 'Ilse', 'most', 'powerful', 'adult', 'performance', 'movie', 'finely-nuanced', 'performance', 'believe', 'Ilse', 'was', 'truly', 'horrified', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'done', 'Jews', 'other', 'adult', 'male', 'characters', 'delivered', 'rather', 'weak', 'performances', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Kommandant', 'was', 'stiff', 'role', 'seemed', 'ill', 'ease', 'most', 'part', 'sadistic', 'Nazi', 'driver', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'even', 'Jewish', 'houseworker', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'character', 'development.All', 'Boy', 'Striped', 'Pajamas', 'getting', 'one', 'skin', ""n't"", 'cop', 'out', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'climax', 'brutal', 'mind-numbing', 'child', 'actors', 'powerful', 'performances', 'movie', 'address', 'questions', 'humanity', 'man', 'capacity', 'evil']",The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
