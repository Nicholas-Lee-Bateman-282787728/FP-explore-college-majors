1424446,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004QL7K70,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","It's kind of like `Superbad' meets `Cloverfield', this high octane teen party film is laced with redundancy and offers up a moral that feels extremely falsified and yet it is extremely entertaining, which is all it ever really tries to be.  With the clich&eacute;d shaky cam in toe and a slew of wannabe actors who have no qualms with taking off their tops and romping around with booze in hand, `Project X' promises the audience a sweaty good time, and for all intents and purposes, that is what we get.  Sadly, there is a lot of redundancy to be found here.  The party scenes (or scene since it lasts the entirety of the movie) has a lot of similar shots, and while havoc ensues to varying degrees, and the end is just a mind blow of crazy, I found myself wanting to hit fast-forward through many parts of the movie.The film circles around a birthday party for Thomas (who is turning 17) at his home by him and his buddies while Thomas's parents are out of town.  The party is an attempt by Thomas's friend Costa to be popular.  Things get way out of hand, Thomas's parents' house gets destroyed, the neighbors call the cops, a midget punches a bunch of people in the nether regions and some crazed lunatic burn's Thomas's house down.  In the meantime, a lot of booze is drunk, loud rap music pumps through your home stereo system and tops galore are tossed to the wayside.The cast is a whos who of nobody you've ever heard of before (aside from Miles Teller who is here briefly), but it doesn't matter.  They don't have to do anything of substance.  They just drink and dance and cheer.  The end result is a bit of a mess.  I like how the film practically turns itself into a horror movie but the idea projected that this party was a GOOD idea in the long run is a shame and kind of proves that mindless entertainment like this really has no reason to be made.That said, I semi-enjoyed myself.",3,A hot mess...,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,1896,"['kind', 'like', 'Superbad', 'meets', 'Cloverfield', 'high', 'octane', 'teen', 'party', 'film', 'laced', 'redundancy', 'up', 'moral', 'extremely', 'falsified', 'yet', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'ever', 'really', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'shaky', 'cam', 'toe', 'slew', 'wannabe', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'qualms', 'taking', 'off', 'tops', 'romping', 'around', 'booze', 'hand', 'Project', 'X', 'audience', 'sweaty', 'good', 'time', 'intents', 'purposes', 'what', 'get', 'Sadly', 'lot', 'redundancy', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'party', 'scenes', 'scene', 'entirety', 'movie', 'lot', 'similar', 'shots', 'havoc', 'ensues', 'varying', 'degrees', 'end', 'just', 'mind', 'blow', 'crazy', 'found', 'wanting', 'hit', 'fast-forward', 'many', 'parts', 'movie.The', 'film', 'circles', 'birthday', 'party', 'Thomas', 'who', 'turning', '17', 'home', 'buddies', 'Thomas', 'parents', 'are', 'town', 'party', 'attempt', 'Thomas', 'friend', 'Costa', 'be', 'popular', 'Things', 'get', 'way', 'hand', 'Thomas', 'parents', 'house', 'destroyed', 'neighbors', 'call', 'cops', 'midget', 'bunch', 'people', 'nether', 'regions', 'crazed', 'lunatic', 'burn', 'Thomas', 'house', 'down', 'meantime', 'lot', 'booze', 'drunk', 'loud', 'rap', 'music', 'pumps', 'home', 'stereo', 'system', 'tops', 'galore', 'are', 'tossed', 'wayside.The', 'cast', 'whos', 'who', 'nobody', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'aside', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'who', 'here', 'briefly', ""n't"", 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'substance', 'just', 'drink', 'dance', 'cheer', 'end', 'result', 'bit', 'mess', 'how', 'film', 'practically', 'horror', 'movie', 'idea', 'projected', 'party', 'was', 'GOOD', 'idea', 'long', 'run', 'shame', 'kind', 'proves', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'really', 'reason', 'be', 'made.That', 'said', 'semi-enjoyed']",Project X

1424449,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004QL7K70,B. E Jackson,"[16, 17]","Project X is not a 5-star movie.  I'm sorry for giving it the highest rating a product can receive on amazon.  However, let me explain my case so you don't think there's something wrong with me.  I've seen *countless* teen party movies over the years and NONE of them are entertaining at all.  They are nothing more than filler and a waste of movie space.Project X... FINALLY, a party movie that actually lives up to the hype!  These teens are on a mission to create the absolute biggest, baddest party ever designed.  They of course, are interested in sex, being cool and just being really rowdy, however what happens is that this party eventually spins *completely* out of control.  As the movie rolls along, you will probably be sitting there totally amazed at just how many creative ways this party turns into pure insanity.Seriously, you will never want to see another party film involving teenagers ever again because this one set out to accomplish every single nook and cranny you can possibly provide and make it MUCH better than all the rest.  It makes all the rest no longer relevant, in fact.  It really works.  I don't even want to spoil any of the ways these teens get into trouble and what they do.  They go from the uncoolest kids in school to the coolest in one night, that's for sure.  Alright alright, I'll spoil one moment.  While the one teen is talking to his father upstairs on the phone and assuring his father that everything's alright at home and that he's not causing any trouble whatsoever, a huge explosion occurs right outside the window!It's hilarious because the entire time I was wondering how the kids would clean up by morning so their parents wouldn't find out what happened.  None of that even matters and you'll find out why, haha.It's rowdy, offensive, provides plenty of swearing and nudity, and it's completely inappropriate for children.  However, for one 80-minute movie and a night of adrenaline-pumping fun, I recommend purchasing (or renting, if you understandably don't trust my words) what will forever be, the king of party films.",5,I shouldn't... and yet I am!,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2078,"['Project', 'X', 'not', '5-star', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'giving', 'highest', 'rating', 'product', 'can', 'receive', 'amazon', 'However', 'let', 'explain', 'case', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'something', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'seen', '*countless*', 'teen', 'party', 'movies', 'years', 'NONE', 'are', 'entertaining', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'filler', 'waste', 'movie', 'space.Project', 'X', 'FINALLY', 'party', 'movie', 'actually', 'up', 'hype', 'teens', 'are', 'mission', 'create', 'absolute', 'biggest', 'baddest', 'party', 'ever', 'designed', 'course', 'are', 'interested', 'sex', 'being', 'cool', 'just', 'being', 'really', 'rowdy', 'however', 'what', 'party', 'eventually', '*completely*', 'control', 'movie', 'rolls', 'along', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'sitting', 'there', 'totally', 'amazed', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'creative', 'ways', 'party', 'pure', 'insanity.Seriously', 'will', 'never', 'want', 'see', 'party', 'film', 'involving', 'teenagers', 'ever', 'again', 'one', 'set', 'accomplish', 'single', 'nook', 'cranny', 'can', 'possibly', 'provide', 'make', 'MUCH', 'better', 'rest', 'rest', 'no', 'longer', 'relevant', 'fact', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'spoil', 'ways', 'teens', 'get', 'trouble', 'what', 'do', 'go', 'uncoolest', 'kids', 'school', 'coolest', 'one', 'night', 'sure', 'Alright', 'alright', ""'ll"", 'spoil', 'one', 'moment', 'one', 'teen', 'talking', 'father', 'upstairs', 'phone', 'assuring', 'father', 'everything', 'alright', 'home', 'not', 'causing', 'trouble', 'whatsoever', 'huge', 'explosion', 'right', 'window', 'hilarious', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'kids', 'would', 'clean', 'up', 'morning', 'so', 'parents', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'None', 'even', 'matters', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'why', 'haha.It', 'rowdy', 'offensive', 'plenty', 'swearing', 'nudity', 'completely', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'However', 'one', '80-minute', 'movie', 'night', 'adrenaline-pumping', 'fun', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'renting', 'understandably', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'words', 'what', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'king', 'party', 'films']",Project X

Seriously, for last few weeks we've only had reviews for movies with `found footage'. As much as I'm starting really, REALLY despise the technique, it was actually used in a quite well, in that it was used in an exciting way, and somewhat believable that someone could be filming a party. The movie only features no name actors and they do a decent job, however, for me, the star of the film is the editing and the soundtrack. It made you feel like you were there experiencing the sights and sounds of the party (whether you find it pleasant or not). The ending, and in particular, the moral or message of the film was downright atrocious, but if you overlook that and are looking for a laugh, then this might appease you, cause just when you think it couldn't get any worse, somehow it always did.Best bit?T-Rick arrives at the party all guns blazing, sending a neighbour into chaos.Did you know?Some of the footage was shot by the cast with cell phones, Flip, iPhone and Blackberry phones that were handed out by the crew.

The idea to go with the handheld el cheapo looking Blair Witch Project ripoff video style was dumb. It's a movie! Spring for some film stock so at least it could be watchable.The other problem is the script. There are virtually no laughs in it at all. The only scene that got me chuckling was when (many SPOILER ALERTS ahead) the drug dealer shows up and starts flamethrowing the neighborhood. That was so out of the blue and then when the cops show up it gets at least good from the aspect of watching disaster porn.The main problem with this movie, despite the fairly likable trio of high school kids who ""run"" the party, is not only does the dialogue between them seem written by a complete idiot who thinks teenagers talk that way now, but the outrageous stuff just seems so lame when you cut right to the core of the stunts. Get this: There are two live DJs playing the party and not a single memorable song. Was there no budget to spring for some decent electronic tunes and not this mush they came up with? Go have a listen to the soundtrack from Go to get an idea how how to blend cool house sounds with an off-the-wall plot.Kid jumps off roof. Been done before. Remember Almost Famous?Car drives into pool. Seriously? Oh, we've never seen that in a movie before.A midget? A lone midget shows up and proceeds to punch kids in the nuts. Sorry, Mini Me was funnier in the Austin Powers series.Teenage girls go topless in the backyard pool...and that's it. They just splash around in the pool. It's like voyeur porn for 12-year-olds.Don't even get me started on the clips of people dancing which basically consist of let's see some chick do a booty grind against some boy for two seconds. Ooh, cutting edge.Oh, yeah, some old dude with an '80s 'stache shows up to party demonstrating his beer pong skills. Snooze and fest!You get the picture. Incredibly uncreative when you look back at the various party movies from Risky Business through Sixteen Candles to Dazed And Confused ....even such B level flicks as Can't Hardly Wait are better. Then the movie falls back into the typical Hollywood boy likes girl, girl likes boy, boy screws up, girl tells him to hit the road, boy wins her heart in the end. Really? This epic party wasn't enough.

I could so identify with these losers as I was one, too in high school (I grew up well-adjusted and happy, thank you). I didn't like the Hangover yet I love this. Why? The directorial style: It just feels so much more natural and unforced; there's a sense of immediacy. And the three unknown leads are simply terrific and likable.

1424462,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004QL7K70,C. Sawin,"[10, 24]","It's Thomas' (Thomas Mann) 18th birthday and his friend Costa (Oliver Cooper) has plans to throw him the biggest party ever. With his parents going out of town for their anniversary, Thomas has the house to himself. Thomas just wants a small get-together or ""enough to be cool"" as he puts it. However Costa wants this to be a party everyone remembers, one that everyone will be talking about long after it's over, and one that will change the lives of Thomas, Costa, and their friend JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown) forever. Not to mention the three of them finally getting laid. Chronicling the entire spectacle with his camera is a weird kid from school named Dax (Dax Flame). With his sights set on nothing but a sea of women and the most epic night he and his friends could possibly ever have, Project X is what Costa labels this little filming event.A documentary-style party movie isn't exactly something that anyone should be excited about. A found-footage The Hangover is all this feels like going into it and Todd Phillips producing doesn't really help change that opinion. The end result is mostly exactly what trailers let on with a conclusion that is extremely predictable with few surprises in between.Stupid high school humor and crude and raunchy jokes are what bridge the gap between first being introduced the characters and the party actually happening. Its immaturity practically becomes overbearing as the comedy will mostly just make people outside the high school demographic feel older than they really are. The biggest surprise comes in the form of a drug dealer named T-Rick (Rick Shapiro). This is where the mascot for the movie comes in and T-Rick's pursuit of retrieving that mascot is perhaps the only original aspect of the movie. The line about him being like The Terminator is the funniest line to come out of Project X. Nick Nervies and Alexis Knapp play Tyler and Everett who are hired as security for the party. Tyler has this big bouncer like attitude and is this teeny tiny little kid while Everett takes his job a little too seriously. These two, T-Rick, along with the quick montage of Milo the dog being in a bouncy castle and getting into crazy antics during the party are the closest things to highlights the movie has to offer.With that said, nearly everything else plays out exactly as you expect it to. Losers try to throw a party to change their reputation, that party finally taking place and being even bigger than they imagined, and eventually said party getting out of control. There are so many instances in the movie where an entire song will play while we're shown various shots of this crazy party and Thomas and his friends enjoying themselves. If anything ever felt like an extended music video before it was outdone by Project X. There's barely a story here. Filming an out of control party doesn't make it a movie. Calling it a movie feels disrespectful to anything that came before it.There is one small shred of depth Project X offers and it lies within that one party changing everything mindset. It's as if it offers this sense of accomplishment while doing something nobody thought you were capable of. Changing your life with the events that transpire in one night is something that probably seems strangely liberating, but this could also be viewed as the movie encouraging this type of behavior which is just as idiotic as the premise of the movie itself.Project X feels like the combination of Superbad and The Hangover shot in the same style you saw in Chronicle, but doesn't come anywhere close to being as good or even as decent as any of those movies. Many people claimed to be surprised by Project X afterwards and that it was more or better than they thought it would be. The studio rep told me he found the movie somewhat inspiring. Unfortunately Project X inspired me to do nothing more than see something that's actually worthwhile.",1,This is considered a movie?

And waking up the next morning (or afternoon), looking around through bloodshot eyes, and thinking, ""I am so dead!""But when it comes to the carnage, chaos, and mayhem on rowdy display in PROJECT X, all of the above sounds like a church social.  When three nerds (Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown) decide it's time for them to be ""cool for their school"" they use all of the social technology at their disposal (and there's a ton of it these days) to invite Youth to come over to celebrate Thomas's 17th birthday--to christen a weekend when the lad's parents are out of town.  And of course the event rapidly spirals out of control, from topless girls jumping in the pool, to an auto going in the pool, to a midget being locked in the oven, to a drunken sot literally swinging from the second story chandelier, to a flame-throwing drug dealer deprived of his Ecstasy, to an epic confrontation with police in riot gear.  Predictably the news helicopter arrives in the knick of time for viewers to look in as the house--along with a good portion of the neighborhood--goes up in flames.And of course, there are no real consequences, and in fact it turns out Dad (Peter Mackenzie) is just a little envious, culminating with young Thomas ultimately winning back his girl (Kirby Bliss Blanton).

There were story arcs and plots. This just goes from one idiotic glorification of excess to the next without giving us a reason to care how it fits in with the overall story. Probably because there was no real story or plot. No one learns anything. No one grows. Nothing really happens even though literally everything was shoved onto the screen. Even the father of the main character practically pats him on the back for doing what probably amounts to millions in property damage and for committing local, state, and federal crimes because even the adults seem to think ""popularity at any price"" is a justifiable end in itself.If you are one of the people who thought this movie was enjoyable and are planning to emulate its events, enjoy your prison sentence and the many, many other bad life choices you will inevitably make.",1,Wish I Could Give It Zero Stars,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1756,"['detestable', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'value', 'list', 'reasons', 'hate', 'movie', 'could', 'go', 'pages', 'not', 'even', 'worth', 'fully', 'writing', 'review', 'am', 'usually', 'firm', 'believer', 'different', 'strokes', 'different', 'folks', 'when', 'liking', 'movies', 'was', 'hateful', 'sociopathic', 'behavior', 'being', 'rewarded', 'nearly', 'level', 'being', 'glorified', 'lazy', 'spiteful', 'movie', 'little', 'sense', 'scale', 'absolutely', 'self', 'awareness', 'Project', 'X', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'ripped', 'off', 'one', 'news', 'story', 'hundred', 'inexpressibly', 'superior', 'coming', 'age', 'party', 'films', 'last', '4', 'decades', 'movie', 'directly', 'steals', 'other', 'films', 'rote', 'idea', 'what', 'source', 'material', 'least', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'sense', 'characters', 'had', 'reasons', 'actions', 'basic', 'level', 'had', 'grown', 'characters', 'only', 'minimally', 'end', 'film', 'were', 'story', 'arcs', 'plots', 'just', 'one', 'idiotic', 'glorification', 'excess', 'next', 'giving', 'reason', 'care', 'how', 'overall', 'story', 'Probably', 'was', 'real', 'story', 'plot', 'one', 'anything', 'one', 'Nothing', 'really', 'even', 'literally', 'everything', 'was', 'shoved', 'screen', 'Even', 'father', 'main', 'character', 'practically', 'back', 'doing', 'what', 'probably', 'millions', 'property', 'damage', 'committing', 'local', 'state', 'federal', 'crimes', 'because', 'even', 'adults', 'seem', 'think', 'popularity', 'price', 'justifiable', 'end', 'itself.If', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'planning', 'emulate', 'events', 'enjoy', 'prison', 'sentence', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'bad', 'life', 'choices', 'will', 'inevitably', 'make']",Project X

It really didn't seem like a comedy when i watched it. It seemed like a serious version of one of the Jackass movies. You do see teenagers doing stuff and barely getting away until the end of the movie when the house burns down and neighborhood is probably getting ready to sue the host and his parents. In fact if any teenager did any of the jokes or acted like the ones in this movie they would end in juvenile detention or jail.

Richardson,"[0, 3]","The film starts off by informing the viewer that the events in the film are fictional and that all the stunts are performed by actors, but by the end of it you're likely to forget about that. Especially since they added the little ""after-bio"" right before the credits started. When that popped up my first thought was ""was this based off something that really happened? o.O"" Then my brain turned on again and I remembered the warning at the beginning.This film is labeled as a comedy, but I don't see how. There wasn't anything comedic about it. It was just a party gone very, very wrong. That's really all this movie is, it's a party film. There's a lot of scene's where you just see the party going on and they have music playing. Maybe it's because I'm not a party person, but the entire movie felt very lifeless. This is the third movie in a week that I've seen that had a lot of potential, but they didn't capitalize on it.It's filmed as if it were a home movie, with Dax Flame ""filming"" it the entire time. Me personally, I would've liked to see more of Dax. It took me a while to remember what I saw him in, but for those of you still having trouble he was in 21 Jump Street. His character seemed to be the one I liked best, even though he only had a total of like 5 lines.Throughout the movie you see a lot of drinking, dancing, topless women, and Thomas, the guy throwing the party, freaking out. What I don't get is why do they always have these movies where the outcasted kid throws the party and he winds up being paranoid the entire time? We all know that kind of thing never happens. It's always the ""popular"" people that throw the party. Granted, his paranoia soon became reality as the party escalated and turned into a small riot.By the end of it nothing really stuck with me. There were a few things here and there like Thomas jumping off of the roof or the kid getting punched by the neighbor, but other than that it isn't very memorable. What this film does do well is make you feel like you're actually there. By doing so watching this is kind of like an adrenaline rush, but sadly that's the only strong thing about the movie.Overall Score: 4/10 - After watching this my reaction was ""meh.""

Thrown as a birthday celebration by three unpopular high school boys, the party escalates rapidly until it hits unimaginable, chaotic heights. There really is no plot at all, unless you count a very predictable, very cliched love story that only pops up to give the lunacy some semblance of story.Whether or not you like the film will depend on just a few factors. Roughly half of the film is nothing more than music video montages of teens going wild, many of them in various stages of undress. If you don't count the opener and closer of the film, the end result is basically an MTV version of a softcore, barely legal porno. If that sounds like your bag, then buckle up. Be warned, though. This film has plenty of bodily fluids, but most of them aren't the result of pleasure, although viewers are treated to more than one shot of boys and girls emptying their bladders, which I guess satisfies the lusts of some people.The movie is really nothing more than an exercise in lust. The largest party I've ever been to was the Full Moon Party in Thailand; it was massive, chaotic, and there was a tent filled with injured and comatose people, but that still paled in comparison to this shindig. I only mention it here because I get the sense of wish-fulfillment that the producers of the film were appealing to in their younger viewers (if you don't count the last fifteen minutes of the party, when things literally and metaphorically go up in flames). Much like a real porno, the movie wants to submerse audiences in the environment and nothing more (hence it is portrayed as yet another found footage film), providing the experience of actually being there among the unaccountably huge ratio of gorgeous boys and girls doing everything but full frontal. As a thirty-something with most of his partying days comfortably behind him, though I found the whole thing monotonous and tiresome. Without a story to propel it, without interesting or unique characters (Costa, the sidekick responsible for the whole mess, is an unapologetically awful person and he becomes ever harder to stomach as the film progresses), and without any sense of direction or unity, this is less a movie than it is a visually arresting mess. Viewers hungry enough to be a part of its riotous energy -- those who dream of similar parties in their future -- they might be drawn in. However, those with more mature aspirations will probably find themselves quickly as sick of the whole thing as the hundreds of kids who, at the conclusion, are themselves puking all over the place.",2,We Don't Need No Water; Let The Something-Something Burn,1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,2612,"['PROJECT', 'X', 'most', 'epic', 'house', 'party', 'time', 'Thrown', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'three', 'unpopular', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'party', 'rapidly', 'unimaginable', 'chaotic', 'heights', 'really', 'plot', 'count', 'very', 'predictable', 'very', 'cliched', 'love', 'story', 'only', 'up', 'give', 'lunacy', 'semblance', 'story.Whether', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'just', 'few', 'factors', 'Roughly', 'half', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'music', 'video', 'montages', 'teens', 'going', 'wild', 'many', 'various', 'stages', 'undress', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'opener', 'closer', 'film', 'end', 'result', 'basically', 'MTV', 'version', 'softcore', 'barely', 'legal', 'porno', 'bag', 'then', 'buckle', 'up', 'Be', 'warned', 'though', 'film', 'plenty', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'result', 'pleasure', 'viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'one', 'shot', 'boys', 'girls', 'emptying', 'bladders', 'guess', 'satisfies', 'lusts', 'people.The', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'exercise', 'lust', 'largest', 'party', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'was', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Party', 'Thailand', 'was', 'massive', 'chaotic', 'there', 'was', 'tent', 'filled', 'injured', 'comatose', 'people', 'still', 'paled', 'comparison', 'shindig', 'only', 'mention', 'here', 'get', 'sense', 'wish-fulfillment', 'producers', 'film', 'were', 'appealing', 'younger', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'party', 'when', 'things', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'go', 'up', 'flames', 'Much', 'real', 'porno', 'movie', 'submerse', 'audiences', 'environment', 'nothing', 'more', 'hence', 'portrayed', 'yet', 'found', 'footage', 'film', 'providing', 'experience', 'actually', 'being', 'unaccountably', 'huge', 'ratio', 'gorgeous', 'boys', 'girls', 'doing', 'everything', 'full', 'frontal', 'thirty-something', 'most', 'partying', 'days', 'comfortably', 'found', 'whole', 'thing', 'monotonous', 'tiresome', 'story', 'propel', 'interesting', 'unique', 'characters', 'Costa', 'sidekick', 'responsible', 'whole', 'mess', 'unapologetically', 'awful', 'person', 'ever', 'harder', 'stomach', 'film', 'sense', 'direction', 'unity', 'less', 'movie', 'visually', 'arresting', 'mess', 'Viewers', 'hungry', 'enough', 'be', 'part', 'riotous', 'energy', 'who', 'dream', 'similar', 'parties', 'future', 'might', 'be', 'drawn', 'However', 'more', 'mature', 'aspirations', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'quickly', 'sick', 'whole', 'thing', 'hundreds', 'kids', 'who', 'conclusion', 'are', 'puking', 'place']",Project X

Certainly none of this would likely happen, certainly not on this scale.  I'm reminded of the 1983 Tom Cruise classic, ""Risky Business"" except that movie actually had a purpose, a story and some likeable characters.  Like this film RB featured a party, an expensive car in the water and a pair of potential love birds.In Project X, high school student Thomas (Thomas Mann) an otherwise sober kid is convinced to have a party at his house on his birthday while his parents are conveniently out of town for the week-end.  His best friends Costa (Oliver Cooper) and Miles (Miles Teller) invite everyone they know and thousands they don't thanks to the internet.  The whole thing is filmed by another friend (Dax Flame) in yet another take on the ""found footage"" theme.  Actually I thought that worked pretty well for a change.  The camera guy actually didn't have to run for his life while remaining committed to keep on filming.  Here he didn't want to miss a stray boob.By boob I mean the fleshy, perfectly formed ones that are attached to nubile young ladies.  On that front there is no shortage.  The party devolves into one giant booze fest with what appears to be indifferent neighbors but for one and a seemingly powerless, ineffective Pasadena police force.  I guess the filmmakers hit their target and I suspect plenty of Blu ray players will have worn out pause buttons as a result.  Me?

1424513,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B004QL7K70,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[6, 12]","The teenage party movie. We've seen it all done before and know exactly where it's headed long before the turns ever take place, right? Reckless teenager is warned by his parents not to have too many friends over, keep the house clean, answer the phone...whatever. Said teen agrees but it's always a lie, and the party ultimately gets way out of hand. That sound about right? These movies tend to have the same message about responsibility and maturing into an adult, making the tough decisions. Nothing wrong with that. John Hughes built a career making films that almost exclusively dealt with those themes.Project X has no such inclination, and it's all the better for it. In fact, it's almost like the anti-John Hughes film, making the occasional nod to his work while simultaneously blowing it up by glorifying sex, violence, debauchery, wanton destruction, and all in the pursuit of a little extra clout in the high school hallways. Marking the second time this year that the found footage style has been put to masterful use, marking perhaps a game changing year for the genre, the film follows Thomas Kub(Thomas Mann), a Pasadena high school senior who might as well be invisible to the popular kids. He's not overly dorky or nerdy, just amazingly average and testosterone-free. Even his father thinks he lacks spine. When his 17th birthday rolls around, and his parents roll out of town to celebrate their conveniently timed anniversary, Thomas is explicitly told not to have too many friends over. Yeah....that's not going to happen.With the frenzied assistance of his Guido belt buddy, Costa(Oliver Cooper), who just wants to get laid like he supposedly used to back home, a party is quickly put together. But Costa is a little too good at his job, and in his efforts to ensure a party that will change their social lives forever, he unwittingly invites thousands to show up at Thomas' doorstep, creating a clusterbomb of epic proportions. We're talking a party that makes Weird Science and Can't Hardly Wait look like Sunday school.Along with their overweight buddy, JB(Jonathan Daniel Brown), Thomas and Costa make every conceivable wrong decision during the course of the night, but it only serves to make the party bigger and more out of control. As the crowd swells into the thousands, the family dog is terrorized beyond belief, midgets turn up out of nowhere to be thrown into ovens, and bursting garden gnomes release literal treats of ecstasy. Authority figures get the proverbial and literal middle finger all night long, including the angry neighbor across the street, who isn't taking kindly to the sound of naked girls diving into the pool or the booming bass cranked out by twin DJs on the wheels of steel. Oh, and the neighborhood starts to bear a striking resemblance to a war zone. Mere words can't describe just how insane this party gets. The word ""party"" needs to be redefined. Even the cop are helpless against the out of control rager, stymied by a combination of Costa's legal expertise and by a barrage of incoming fire. Perhaps ""war zone"" is even too mild to describe it.  Whatever the word, there has never been an experience quite like this on the silver screen in quite some time.That's really what Project X is and has always had aspirations to be: a never before seen movie going experience. Piecing this monstrosity together would have been impossible if not for the perfect combination of people behind the camera, starting with producer Todd Phillips. The thread of anarchistic wish fulfillment is one he seems to have a particular fondness for, seen in both Old School and The Hangover. Debuting director Nima Nourizadeh, a music video veteran, puts that experience to perfect use in some of the film's most stirring stretches of just watching the crowd in their state of euphoria, without a care in the world. The script, which bears a little too much of a resemblance to Superbad at times, was written by Matt Drake and Michael Bacall. Bacall is having a phenomenal couple of years exploring the crazy ways in which young people think, having also written Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and the upcoming 21 Jump Street remake. An oft forgotten subplot involving Thomas and his hot best friend, Kirby(Kirby Bliss Blanton), is the one aspect that is so cliche as to be distracting.The goal of any party movie is to put the viewer right into the thick of the mob, to experience the mayhem first hand. Few films ever actually accomplish it, because the most epic parties are a collection of perfectly aligned intangibles. A movie has to find a way to capture those things and do it in an organic way. The music, the people, the energy, just the right amount of rebellion and fear of what could happen next. Project X, for all the unbelievable antics, makes for an incredibly authentic and unforgettable experience.

What could you do to change that?Thomas (played by Thomas Mann) is turning seventeen and his parents are leaving town. His parents (played by relative unknowns Peter Mackenzie and Caitlin Dullany) fully expect him to throw a party in their absence and simply ask that it be kept under control. Still his friends Costa (played by Oliver Cooper) and JB (played by Jonathan Daniel Brown) believe that they can bring into being an epic gathering that will elevate their friend and themselves to legendary status simply through social networking and word of mouth. Unsure of what to expect, they encounter a former classmate who recently graduated and invite him only to discover he's already planning to attend. And, every step of the way, Kirby (played by Kirby Bliss Blanton) is telling Thomas that Costa's party is a bad idea. Kirby is apparently Thomas's only female friend. Of course Blanton is quite attractive herself and while they've never been more than friends, Thomas entertains numerous fantasies regarding Alexis (another student played by Alexis Knapp) who has no idea he's alive.The title is terribly unoriginal, but it was initially intended to be a placeholder until it started to generate interest. Whether that was in any way related to the 1968 science fiction film of the same name or the 1987 comedy-science fiction-thriller starring Matthew Broderick, I can't say. I will say that I and many others in the theater laughed out loud numerous times throughout the film. Some have called this film irresponsible and said it sets a bad example to high school students. Then again, a film that sets a good example would probably depict a party where no alcohol or drugs are consumed, no cigarettes are smoked, and everyone returned home and went to bed at a decent hour after, of course, helping to clean up. Would ANYBODY see that? I wouldn't. It's not revolutionary and there are no profound life lessons but it is unmistakably a good time.",4,Awesome Party Movie!!!,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,2114,"['Did', 'spend', 'entire', 'high', 'school', 'career', 'someone', 'few', 'friends', 'who', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'forgotten', 'student', 'body', 'moments', 'graduating', 'What', 'could', 'do', 'change', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Mann', 'turning', 'seventeen', 'parents', 'are', 'leaving', 'town', 'parents', 'played', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'Peter', 'Mackenzie', 'Caitlin', 'Dullany', 'fully', 'expect', 'throw', 'party', 'absence', 'simply', 'ask', 'be', 'kept', 'control', 'Still', 'friends', 'Costa', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Cooper', 'JB', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Daniel', 'Brown', 'believe', 'can', 'bring', 'being', 'epic', 'gathering', 'will', 'elevate', 'friend', 'legendary', 'status', 'simply', 'social', 'networking', 'word', 'mouth', 'Unsure', 'what', 'expect', 'encounter', 'former', 'classmate', 'who', 'recently', 'graduated', 'invite', 'only', 'discover', 'already', 'planning', 'attend', 'step', 'way', 'Kirby', 'played', 'Kirby', 'Bliss', 'Blanton', 'telling', 'Thomas', 'Costa', 'party', 'bad', 'idea', 'Kirby', 'apparently', 'Thomas', 'only', 'female', 'friend', 'course', 'Blanton', 'quite', 'attractive', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'more', 'friends', 'Thomas', 'numerous', 'fantasies', 'regarding', 'Alexis', 'student', 'played', 'Alexis', 'Knapp', 'who', 'idea', 'alive.The', 'title', 'terribly', 'unoriginal', 'was', 'initially', 'intended', 'be', 'placeholder', 'started', 'generate', 'interest', 'was', 'way', 'related', '1968', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'same', 'name', '1987', 'comedy-science', 'fiction-thriller', 'starring', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'will', 'say', 'many', 'others', 'theater', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'numerous', 'times', 'film', 'have', 'called', 'film', 'irresponsible', 'said', 'bad', 'example', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'Then', 'again', 'film', 'good', 'example', 'would', 'probably', 'depict', 'party', 'where', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'are', 'consumed', 'cigarettes', 'are', 'smoked', 'everyone', 'returned', 'home', 'went', 'bed', 'decent', 'hour', 'course', 'helping', 'clean', 'up', 'Would', 'ANYBODY', 'see', 'would', ""n't"", 'not', 'revolutionary', 'are', 'profound', 'life', 'lessons', 'unmistakably', 'good', 'time']",Project X
1424515,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004QL7K70,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0Every year just about, a movie comes out of nowhere, that is actually quite clever and funny. Three teenagers, Thomas, Costa and JB, plan a humongous birthday party for Thomas, at his parents' home, after they split for the weekend. Before the parents leave, Thomas reassures his father that he'll keep the house in good order as there will be only a few kids coming over to celebrate his birthday.We learn that Thomas' father is disappointed in his son in general, as he's not very popular at school. In contrast to the hesitant Thomas, Costa is the bad-ass friend whose main goal is to get laid. As he says later on, ""Tonight is about the girls we never had a shot at"" and the party is the opportunity to ""change the game."" Costa continually eggs his conservative friend on, urging him at every turn to embrace his inner wild side. Rounding out the trio, is their nerdy, overweight kid, JB, who also seeks sexual freedom.A fourth confederate, Dax, an AV student, follows Thomas, Costa and JB around, videotaping all the events with a hand-held camera. Other footage is shot during the film with smart phones, police dashboard cameras as well as by the news media, which plays a prominent role during the film's climax.Before the break into the Second Act, when the big party begins, there's some important foreshadowing going on. The three friends pay a visit to Costa's marijuana dealer, T-rick, a military vet, who sells them some weed for the party. Costa ends up stealing a Santa Claus gnome, a figurine that later is revealed to contain hundreds of pills of Ecstasy. The theft of the gnome sets T-Rick off later on, with near deadly consequences. At this juncture, T-Rick is seen chasing the hapless trio, as they make a getaway in Thomas' father's car; the vet manages to break the car window, foreshadowing some real crazy things to come.Since the three friends want to achieve popularity amongst their peers, they advertise their big event on social media, with disastrous consequences. Before they know it, about fifteen hundred to two thousand teenagers populate Thomas' backyard (soon the orgy spills into the house itself, earlier proclaimed off limits by Thomas' father).The three must then cope with an escalating series of crises which all have unexpected results. An initial crisis involves Thomas' pet pooch, who the drunken revelers hoist into the air, tethered to a bunch of helium balloons. Thomas lowers his dog down from the air and averts the first crisis. Then a neighbor comes by and threatens to call the police because of the noise. One of Costa's very young 'security guards', tasers a neighbor 'who doth protest too much' and then ends up getting slugged himself by the angry protester. In another great twist (and there are many of them here) Costa averts another crisis by threatening to report the neighbor for slugging his 'security' (a minor).As teenage girls strip off their blouses and bras and swim nude in the swimming pool, Thomas is tested by Alexis, 'the hottest girl' in the high school, as she French kisses him as they both down shots of Tequila (the seduction foreshadows the discovery later on by Thomas' girlfriend Kirby, of Thomas about to have sex with Alexis).When the police arrive, Thomas and his friends manage to get everyone to quiet down in the backyard. The police want to search around but Costa smartly reminds them they have no warrant. Later, Thomas is depressed by the wanton destruction going on outside and Costa tries to relax him by giving him an Ecstasy pill, recovered from T-Rick's (now shattered) gnome.Now completely high, Thomas is hardly in a position to try and keep things under control. His ego is stroked when all the party goers sing happy birthday to him. Meanwhile events are set in motion, leading to things getting totally out of control. A dwarf is thrown into a dryer and after Costa saves him, he repays everyone by striking them hard in the testicles. Later the dwarf returns and promptly drives Thomas' father's car into the swimming pool in the backyard.The second act crisis reaches its apex when T-Rick appears with a flamethrower, torching Thomas' parents' house and the rest of the neighborhood. For a few minutes, the comic tone of the movie is lost and I'm not convinced that the flamethrower scenes with all the kids running for their lives and police firing rubber bullets, enhanced the overall spectacle. In other words, it got a little 'too real'. Nonetheless, the way in which the news media is depicted covering the event, was a nice satiric touch.'Project X' manages to re-introduce the comic tone when Thomas' father both berates and praises him for the riotous goings-on the night before. Besides lamenting how much all this is going to cost him to repair, the father also is impressed that Thomas has made himself popular. In a great touch, the father makes Thomas drive to school in the burnt out mini-van. But Thomas finds redemption from both his schoolmates who cheer him in the hallway and Kirby, who forgives him for his indiscretion with Alexis.Finally, we find out that the legal consequences for the hapless trio are not so bad after all. And the party becomes fodder for even Jimmy Kimmel, who jokes about it on nighttime network TV.'Project X' is successful because all of its unexpected twists and turns. It's a clever concept which manages to sustain itself until the end, when it slightly wears out its welcome. The three principal actors were discovered after a nationwide casting call. Since they didn't know each other before, the producers brilliantly sent them on a week Disney vacation, where they presumably bonded. Teenagers will love 'Project X' and adults with open minds, will too.",3,Highly amusing tale of hapless teenagers who throw party that gets out of control,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,5774,"['***',
