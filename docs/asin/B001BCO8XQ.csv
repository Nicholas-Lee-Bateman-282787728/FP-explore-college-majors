I love to disagree with unfavorable reviews, except here they're right.[Spoiler alert]There are no aliens, UFOs or ET's.  Just a really sick plot about stem cell research and transplant operations. (Remember Clockwork Orange -- a great book and a polished, distrurbing film?)This effort is quite darn creepy but not in a ""boo! got ya"" way. Unsettling and horrific themes. Taboo subjects everywhere. (One of the main characters is a psychic defrocked priest.) Hey, anyone for frozen surgical leftovers?Our heroes soldier on droning about this and that. Scully is now working in a Catholic hospital, where her medical decisions face a board of morality oversers, because key plot points require this.  There's a few more nasty riffs on the Catholic church I really didn't like.Unpleasant and scary. The scares bring this up to 2 stars -- a more generous rating than most who see this will give.By the way, I liked this movie the most of the three of us who saw it.  Just think -- this is the POSITIVE review.This is vying for your movie dollar with the new Batman movie??  No contest.

1171377,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,B001BCO8XQ,Aaron Von Raschke,"[8, 8]","Here's where I stand on THE X-FILES: I was a fan of the show for the first couple of seasons when every episode was different (remember the Jersey Devil episode and the one about the deformed redneck family?) and before it got really heavy into the same continuous storyline, and I saw the first X-FILES movie a couple of times when it first came out but it's been so long that I barely remember it. So I did enjoy the show, however I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan and I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a highly anticipated movie for me. So, with that out of the way...In THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE, Mulder (David Duchovny) is living in seclusion and Scully (Gillian Anderson) is now a doctor. They are reunited when the FBI seeks them out for help to find a fellow agent who has gone missing. Mulder and Scully, along with the help of the FBI (with the two primary agents being portrayed by Amanda Peet and rapper Xzibit) and a goofy psychic named Father Joe (portrayed by Billy Connolly), eventually find clues that lead them to something gruesome and disturbing.Throughout the movie there is a subplot where Scully is going through an ordeal at the hospital she works at involving a sick child who she is trying to save, the child's family, and the ""powers that be"" of the hospital who refuse to offer any further treatment for the child due to the fact that he suffers from an incurable disease. For most of the FBI investigation, Scully is absent and is faced with the dilemma of going through a radical medical procedure (stem cell) which may or may not help the child but will surely cause him a lot of pain. And then there's the Father Joe character who, while somewhat annoying at first, ultimately won me over due to actor Billy Connolly's charm. Father Joe is interesting in that he has a haunting past and is judged because of it, claims that God talks to him and gives him these psychic visions, and no one believes him except for Mulder.Overall I enjoyed this film a lot! I really had no desire to see it, and actually decided to watch it just to see Xzibit in a ""serious role"". This film surprised me and kept my interest throughout. The entire film was definitely a throwback to the first seasons of the show in which they had the whole ""Monster of the Week"" thing going on which I mentioned earlier. It's basically a standalone Sci-Fi/Thriller with elements of Horror. The chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson is awesome and it's always great to see them back together on screen. Amanda Peet and Xzibit were both pretty good in their roles. It's sort of hinted in the movie that Peet's character has a thing for Mulder, but it never really goes anywhere for reasons I can't really talk about without ruining the movie. Xzibit was more of a background guy who didn't say a whole lot, who's character had a thick exterior to contrast Peet's more easy-going demeanor. And of course Connolly was great as always.Another thing that I loved about the movie was the Cinematography. It was filmed in Canada during the winter and the snowy scenery and photography in the film was gorgeous. There aren't really any bad things about the movie that I can really think of. The lack of a major villain was a bit disappointing, but the twist at the end more than makes up for it. Obviously I won't say what the twist is, but it most definitely treads the waters of the Horror genre. Also the film isn't really as epic as a TV show-turned-feature length film should be and seemed like it could have been a longer version of a TV episode. Other than that, it was great. Entertaining, great cast, great acting, beautiful Cinematography, great music, nostalgia, and a twist that will satisfy Horror fans. There's also a little something special during the closing credits (with two songs provided by U.N.K.L.E. including a remix of the X-FILES theme) which is kind of cheesy but is still pretty cool to watch.I've only seen the 1-Disc Version of the DVD so far and the Extra Features are OK. It has a great Commentary track by writer/director Chris Carter and writer Frank Spotnitz. There is also a ten minute Gag Reel, which by the looks of it the cast had a blast making the film. Overall, it's a great film and I would definitely recommend it.4 starsEDIT: The 2-Disc Version has the same Extra Features as the 1-Disc version, but the second disc has a feature-length Documentary on the production of the movie that covers everything from the cast, to the filming, to reuniting the cast and crew, and the secrecy of the movie. It's actually really interesting when they talk about how secretive they were during the filming to the point that some of the crew didn't even KNOW they were working on the new X-FILES movie. Another thing that is brought up is how they leaked staged photos of a Werewolf prop on the set to throw people off. Includes interviews with the cast and crew and Behind-the-Scenes footage. I would recommend spending the few extra bucks to get the Special Edition as opposed to the 1-Disc. It's worth it.",4,A throwback to the earlier seasons of the show.,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,5053,"['Here', 'where', 'stand', 'X-FILES', 'was', 'fan', 'show', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'when',

Krenn,"[2, 2]","Without re-hashing what so many reviewers have stated, I wish to add my own thoughts:It is impossible to separate this film from the show before it. This film is for fans of the show, but more importantly, fans of the characters Chris Carter created all those years ago. When it comes right down to it, this is a way for fans to re-connect with characters they love and see them off in a surprisingly positive way. While the resolution of the story itself is gloomy, it is the resolution of the characters for which this film dazzles and for which I, as a fan, am grateful for getting to see. Thanks Chris Carter.If your coming into the X-Files for the first time, this is NOT the place to start.If you are a casual fan looking for a re-visit, this will probably not satisfy.If you are a solid fan of the old show and the characters within, this is definitely the way to end it.",5,Case Closed,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,878,"['re-hashing', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'wish', 'add', 'own', 'thoughts', 'impossible', 'separate', 'film', 'show', 'film', 'fans', 'show', 'more', 'importantly', 'fans', 'characters', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'created', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'right', 'down', 'way', 'fans', 're-connect', 'characters', 'love', 'see', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'positive', 'way', 'resolution', 'story', 'gloomy', 'resolution', 'characters', 'film', 'dazzles', 'fan', 'am', 'grateful', 'getting', 'see', 'Thanks', 'Chris', 'Carter.If', 'coming', 'X-Files', 'first', 'time', 'NOT', 'place', 'start.If', 'are', 'casual', 'fan', 'looking', 're-visit', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'satisfy.If', 'are', 'solid', 'fan', 'old', 'show', 'characters', 'definitely', 'way', 'end']",The X-Files TV Series

As a stand-alone movie it does fairly decently, but as a way to get reintroduced to our favorite duo of Mulder and Scully - it appeased my expectations. I was surprised about the ease with which Chris Carter can make a case for stem cell research and how he did it so fittingly set against the background of X-Files (very much like the good old days when the series dealt with our strongest fears).For an obsessive fan of the series (I have The X-Files: The Ultimate Edition set  and have seen all episodes at least twice), who is also a Mulder-Scully shipper, the movie satisfied my curiosity of knowing that the characters are still doing quite well and fighting some of the same battles as when we last saw them.The bottom line is that if you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy this film. If you are a fan of the Mulder/Scully dynamic, you will love this film.

This movie is basically like a stand-alone episode, but with a bigger budget.

The script must have been written by a team of earnest middle-schoolers and then heavily edited by someone for whom English is only a fourth or fifth language.  The camerawork is mind-numbingly unimaginative and the acting of the two principals makes ""wooden"" seem like a term of praise in comparison.  Even the bad guys speak terrible Russian - clearly no one had bothered to ask a real Russian speaker for any guidance here.In short, everything is wrong with this movie.  It would be a perfect and amusing parody if only someone would cut it down to about six minutes.  As it is, it drags on for a great deal too long for anyone's good.

And ""Jeepers"" was directed by a man who was arrested on suspicion of child abuse.  He may have actually been the source of Carter & Spotnitz's ""inspiration.""IWTB has a lot more in common with ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Silence of The Lambs"" than the X-Files franchise.I watched the extended version of this film twice on dvd.  Once with the normal soundtrack and once with commentary.  I really wanted to know what was going through their heads when they made this thing.The script that Carter & Spotnitz wrote contrasts loving heterosexual parents and their (of course) dying child against a child molester AND his employers who are (Surprise!) a male couple that ""got married in Massachusetts."" And if I understood the ""plot"" correctly, one of the 2 men had been molested by this same ex-priest as a child.The film also contrasts the love of Mulder & Scully (which is enhanced with great lighting, nice scenery and orchestral music) against the relationship of the 2 gay villains who LITERALLY kidnap, imprison, & hack up their mostly female victims.  The women are imprisoned at a location with blood spattered floors and vicious dogs.See, the women are being used for ""body parts"" to transplant into one of the gay men who is dying.Why not have them kill puppies & steal girl scout cookies as well?  A little TOO obvious I guess.And since these are ""gay"" men, they're (of course) using the body parts of WOMEN, because the writers needed to go after transexuals too.  Uh, no I'm sorry, it's because the women have a rare blood type and blah, blah, blah.P-R-O-P-A-G-A-N-D-AThe ""message"" in this movie is pretty obvious.  Gay people are a THREAT and they should be feared because they kidnap, maim, mutilate, and murder women to get what they want.  They ""feed"" off society and are monsters who ""pal around"" with men who are child molestors.  It's actually the kind of ""reasoning"" that justifies hate crimes.During the commentary track Chris Carter expresses a little concern for the animals that are used in actual research labs.  And during one DVD special feature he talks about how proud he is that they were so ""green"" in making this movie.But I guess LGBT people didn't even warrant that level of concern from Carter & Spotnitz.  This film has a PG-13 rating and so it'll be seen by many, many children around the world.  Let 'em learn to hate (themselves or others) while they're still really young & impressionable.  Good job.Contrast the PG-13 rating that IWTB got with the ""R"" rating that ""Ma Vie En Rose"" received.

The most significant of these seemed to be that the actors had a difficult time getting back into roles which hey had long ago left behind, and some of the distance was evident in this movie no matter how they tried.The script, however, was wonderfully ambiguous, harking back to the best of the horror episodes from the series; the element of the supernatural was understated and the mood was carefully, finely  wrought. The setting - probably Canada, but on-screen a snowed-in West Virginia - was gorgeous. I was pleased there were no hints of the overriding government conspiracies the show devoted itself to; they really had no place in this movie. It wasn't that sort of film. The effects were mostly very very nice indeed, neither overdone nor used excessively. The thing it most reminds me of is, oddly enough, the feel you get from the first ""30 Days of Night"" comic book, of darkness and winter and clarity.It was beautiful and satisfying though, both as a character study and as a mystery. As a character study it did not do what fans wanted but it did stay absolutely true to the character's natures; Scully was never someone who had an easy time dealing with the darker side to life, despite her long-term exposure to it. Mulder was always drawn to it, searching it out and dealing with it easily.As a mystery is was nicely creepy and well-thought out, illustrating the ways that Mulder and the FBI would take divergent paths which would eventually arrive at the same place, albeit at different times. The mainstream FBI, while still shown as quite hidebound given the internal logic of the series, isn't made out to be quite as incompetent as the show generally preferred to portray it, which is a gratifying change.All in all I liked it; I may like it more on second viewing, it seems that sort of movie.",4,I see that a lot of people didn't like this film.,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1893,"[""'m"", 'not', 'pretend', 'perfect', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'flaws', 'most', 'significant', 'seemed', 'be', 'actors', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'back', 'roles', 'hey', 'had', 'long', 'ago', 'left', 'behind', 'distance', 'was', 'evident', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'tried.The', 'script', 'however', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'ambiguous', 'harking', 'back', 'best', 'horror', 'series', 'element', 'supernatural', 'was', 'understated', 'mood', 'was', 'carefully', 'finely', 'wrought', 'setting', 'probably', 'Canada', 'on-screen', 'snowed-in', 'West', 'Virginia', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'pleased', 'were', 'hints', 'overriding', 'government', 'show', 'devoted', 'really', 'had', 'place', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'sort', 'film', 'effects', 'were', 'mostly', 'very', 'very', 'nice', 'indeed', 'overdone', 'used', 'excessively', 'thing', 'most', 'oddly', 'enough', 'feel', 'get', 'first', '30', 'Days', 'Night', 'comic', 'book', 'darkness', 'winter', 'clarity.It', 'was', 'beautiful', 'satisfying', 'character', 'study', 'mystery', 'character', 'study', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'fans', 'wanted', 'did', 'stay', 'absolutely', 'true', 'character', 'natures', 'Scully', 'was', 'never', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'easy', 'time', 'dealing', 'darker', 'side', 'life', 'long-term', 'exposure', 'Mulder', 'was', 'always', 'drawn', 'searching', 'dealing', 'mystery', 'was', 'nicely', 'creepy', 'well-thought', 'out', 'illustrating', 'ways', 'Mulder', 'FBI', 'would', 'take', 'divergent', 'paths', 'would', 'eventually', 'arrive', 'same', 'place', 'albeit', 'different', 'times', 'mainstream', 'FBI', 'still', 'shown', 'quite', 'hidebound', 'given', 'internal', 'logic', 'series', ""n't"", 'made', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'incompetent', 'show', 'generally', 'preferred', 'portray', 'gratifying', 'change.All', 'liked', 'may', 'like', 'more', 'second', 'viewing', 'sort', 'movie']",The X-Files TV Series
1171392,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B001BCO8XQ,AverageReviewer,"[1, 2]","The X-files series had a few story arcs that were bigger than life that lend themselves nicely to the giant screen: aliens taking over the earth etc.  In effect, the first movie, Fight the Future, was exactly about one of these larger than life story arcs.This second installment was something else.  Halfway through this movie I was perplexed and asked myself, ""Why did Chris Carter make a movie about this???""  I kept watching and continously told myself that this was Chris Carter and that he was probably trying to tell us something like a Kubrick.By the end of the movie I had figured out a few lessons that Carter was trying to share with us.  They're the same lessons that started out with the very first X-files episode:-- THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN FAITH AND SCIENCE-- THE BALANCE BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE and RELATIONSHIPSCarter weaves things nicely to have us ask hard questions: at what point does science take us down grotesque and painful roads?- When does ethical become unethical- When is it better to stop trying and let God take it from there?Additionally, the movie challenges us: people don't always live happily ever after like TV makes us think that they do.The movie tells its story and makes its points in a decidedly X-filish way, with a splash of gore, some suspense, fighting egos at the FBI. Overall, we see Moulder and Scully and we also get to see Skinner but don't expect any of the classic standby actors like Cigarette smoking man or any others.Overall, I have to admit that this was not my favorite X-file (this was one of the filler episodes in between the good conspiracy story arc episodes!).  It sought to give the characters too much depth - it made them too human and this came at the expense of a bigger than life plot...not to mention that it's a bit difficult to add too much dimension to Moulder and Scully.  I remember once that Gillian Anderson directed an episode of the X-files where she had to face her past where she had an affair with one of her professors - it's a deeper look at Scully character.  Although that episode was well done, to me it was an interesting excursion ...This movie reminds me solidly of that episode.....exploring the deeper relationships between Moulder and Scully and exploring more deeply the battle between Science and Faith. Don't get me wrong, the script for ""I Want to Believe"" is worthy of a movie but I would just prefer Moulder and Scully fighting to save the world from giant government super conspiracies - and just lightly sprinkling the deeper Philosophy into the script vs making the entire movie about the Philsophy set against the backdrop of what appears to be a very mundane kidnapping case (although Carter ties things up very nicely at the end and answers my question of ""What was Carter trying to tell me."")...only thing is....HE HAD ALREADY TAUGHT ME THOSE LESSONS.It gets Five Stars because it was classic Xfiles in the tradition of the Xfiles.  I would go so far as to say that the story was worthy of an Oscar nomination for what it was trying to tell us but there is no way it would ever be considered - you have to get through the gore and all the other metaphysical stuff to get to the meat of Lessons....and there are other venues to make similar points in more digestible formats.  Definitely worth watching.  I do want to believe....AND, I though would've preferred something that involved a Conspiracy, Aliens, Cigarette Smoking Man.Overall, I felt the first movie migth have been too much X files Action  where this movie was very much X Files Philosophy.

Prior to this, Scully was working as an M.D., Mulder had been hiding from the FBI.  Mulder is reluctant to get involved, but is persuaded by Scully.  Once Mulder picks up the scent of the case, he becomes totally committed to solving it.

Like many series (Lostincluded) they start getting ridiculous or lose focus of their storylines. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that this newest theatrical release -- THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE -- is just as insipid as the last few episodes I'd watched of the television series. And it looks more like a murder mystery than the supernatural feel that appealed to early watchers of the series.David Duchovny (Evolution) reprises his role as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder, as does Gillian Anderson (The Last King of Scotland) as Dana Scully. The ridiculousness of the premise is such that I'm having trouble typing it here. It sounds so ...pat and simple. But it's basically about a pedophile catholic Father who supposedly has visions of women who've been kidnapped recently and moved to unknown quarters. One of the kidnapped is an FBI agent and agent Whitney (Amanda Peet,Martian Child) wants Mulder's help to find out if this holy man (Billy Connolly,Fido) is the real deal or if he's jerking their chain. ""Wanting to believe"", and still aching to find his lost sister, Mulder joins up with the FBI once again and gets pulled into the terrors ...along with Scully.By this time, we know that Scully and Mulder are hot for each other. It's old news brought back around again and given way too much easy screen time. They fall into each others' arms in lockstep fashion (no surprise there).The storyline is simple and pretty lame. And it really has nothing to do with the supernatural or aliens or anything that we've come to expect from Chris Carter's creation. It's more in-line with Mary Shelley'sFrankenstein, a sort of horror/murder-mystery ...mess.The saddest part is the over-acting by Duchovny and Anderson.

1171401,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B001BCO8XQ,Bobby Underwood,"[144, 161]","Much like the first theatrical outing for Mulder and Scully, this will disappoint some for what it is not, and others for what it actually is. It is very much the type of stand-alone story which used to be squeezed between the conspiracy and mythology episodes. The problem presented by the avenue chosen by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz is that after so many years have passed, fans aching for what The X-Files did best will be confronted by a dreary and snowy low-key and intimate story which while excellent on its own, is not what fans had anticipated.That being said, I do believe, however, after the initial shock, and perhaps after a second viewing, fans will embrace it for Carter's courage to once again fly in the face of the powers that be and tell an often creepy stand-alone story showing how the darkness always found Mulder and Scully, and how it was having each other to lean on which helped each keep their faith. It is almost as if this is a segue to something more on the horizon. For even within the confines of a story which does not deal in the slightest manner with any of the X-Files mythology fans have hungered for, there are portents.Beginning with both Mulder and Scully leading very different lives than those we came to know, Carter uses the darkness to bring them back together. It is a kidnapped F.B.I. Agent and a Bureau ready to forgive Mulder for his many indiscretions if only he will help work with the psychic who may or may not be genuine which starts things rolling. Scully's need to help a young boy with an incurable disease and the relationship of our favorite F.B.I. couple, even though neither works for the Bureau anymore, gets as much screen time as the premise, which is like a creepy episode rather than a feature film.Duchovny and Anderson are still fabulous together, perhaps even more so in a somber and low-key outing such as this. The intimacy and history of the couple is what the film is about, and how faith can be restored even amidst the darkness which always found them, and sometimes kept them apart. This really plays better as a small screen episode of the show, but because we have missed Mulder and Scully for so long, it gets an A.There are references to Mulder's sister, the alien abduction which haunted and drove him in his quest for the truth. It is a story line we thought wrapped up. Now that is unclear. Carter did say in an interview about the film that no one ever really dies for good on the show. And though the film itself has dealt in absolutely no way at all with X-Files mythology, what should show up as a background to the closing credits? Black oil, that's what. And it ain't Texas tea. It is worth seeing if only for a very touching and tender moment between Mulder and Scully near the end. It is the kind of intimate conversation which made the show better than anything else we got to watch during its long run.The story itself might have been better as an episode of the show, and those who venture into theatres expecting something grandiose after all this time will certainly come away wondering if it was worth the wait. Fans of the show, however, were fans because of the relationship between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. So if you go in knowing that this is that sort of episode, in which the case is only an excuse to bring them back to who they were, then you'll enjoy it much more. It has much more in common with ""Beyond the Sea"" or ""Irresistible"" than say, ""Nesei"" and ""731.""See it on the big screen to show support, so we can have more, but know you'll probably enjoy it more on your set once it comes to dvd.",5,"""I think it's the darkness which always finds us, Scully."" -- Mulder",1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,3609,"['Much', 'first', 'theatrical', 'outing', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'will', 'disappoint', 'what', 'not', 'others', 'what', 'actually', 'very', 'much', 'type', 'stand-alone', 'story', 'used', 'be', 'squeezed', 'conspiracy', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'problem', 'presented', 'avenue', 'chosen', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'fans', 'aching', 'what', 'X-Files', 'did', 'best', 'will', 'be', 'confronted', 'dreary', 'snowy', 'low-key', 'intimate', 'story', 'excellent', 'own', 'not', 'what', 'fans', 'had', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'believe', 'however', 'initial', 'shock', 'perhaps', 'second', 'viewing', 'fans', 'will', 'embrace', 'Carter', 'courage', 'once', 'again', 'fly', 'face', 'powers', 'be', 'tell', 'often', 'creepy', 'stand-alone', 'story', 'showing', 'how', 'darkness', 'always', 'found', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'how', 'was', 'having', 'other', 'lean', 'helped', 'keep', 'faith', 'almost', 'segue', 'something', 'more', 'horizon', 'even', 'confines', 'story', 'not', 'deal', 'slightest', 'manner', 'X-Files', 'mythology', 'fans', 'have', 'hungered', 'are', 'portents.Beginning', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'leading', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'came', 'know', 'Carter', 'darkness', 'bring', 'back', 'together', 'kidnapped', 'F.B.I', 'Agent', 'Bureau', 'ready', 'forgive', 'Mulder', 'many', 'indiscretions', 'only', 'will', 'help', 'work', 'psychic', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'genuine', 'things', 'rolling', 'Scully', 'need', 'help', 'young', 'boy', 'incurable', 'disease', 'relationship', 'favorite', 'F.B.I', 'couple', 'even', 'Bureau', 'anymore', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'premise', 'creepy', 'episode', 'rather', 'feature', 'film.Duchovny', 'Anderson', 'are', 'still', 'fabulous', 'together', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'somber', 'low-key', 'outing', 'such', 'intimacy', 'history', 'couple', 'what', 'film', 'how', 'faith', 'can', 'be', 'restored', 'even', 'amidst', 'darkness', 'always', 'found', 'sometimes', 'kept', 'apart', 'really', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'episode', 'show', 'have', 'missed', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'so', 'long', 'A.There', 'are', 'references', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'alien', 'abduction', 'haunted', 'drove', 'quest', 'truth', 'story', 'line', 'thought', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Now', 'unclear', 'Carter', 'did', 'say', 'interview', 'film', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'good', 'show', 'film', 'dealt', 'absolutely', 'way', 'X-Files', 'mythology', 'what', 'should', 'show', 'up', 'background', 'closing', 'credits', 'Black', 'oil', 'what', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Texas', 'tea', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'very', 'touching', 'tender', 'moment', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'end', 'kind', 'intimate', 'conversation', 'made', 'show', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'got', 'watch', 'long', 'run.The', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'episode', 'show', 'who', 'venture', 'theatres', 'expecting', 'something', 'grandiose', 'time', 'will', 'certainly', 'come', 'away', 'wondering', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'Fans', 'show', 'however', 'were', 'fans', 'relationship', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'So', 'go', 'knowing', 'sort', 'episode', 'case', 'only', 'excuse', 'bring', 'back', 'who', 'were', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'Sea', 'Irresistible', 'say', 'Nesei', '731', 'See', 'big', 'screen', 'show', 'support', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'know', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'more', 'set', 'dvd']",The X-Files TV Series

This movie really does play like a standalone episode from the series, and it was the best possible move Chris Carter could have made. Rather than take the ever-deepening mythos of the series and twist it further, he's moved the characters into a story that makes sense in where our agents would be today.Mulder and Scully no longer work for the FBI, but they're called back in for one more case. To be honest, I don't think bringing Fox in on the case was necessary, but I'm just happy to see them back in action. They've changed since we saw them last fleeing from the FBI. They're more subdued, more adult, and seem to have comfortably settled into the relationship that started on the show.The subplot involving Scully's patient at the hospital never really seemed to make sense. I understand it added tension to the storyline for her, but it didn't seem vital to the story. When you consider we've waited YEARS to see these two back in action again, every moment on screen is precious, and I feel they wasted a lot of it with Christian's stem cell subplot.All in all, this is a movie even a non-fan could watch and still follow. There are fleeting mentions to previous cases they dealt with together, but nothing is vital to know ahead of time.

1171412,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001BCO8XQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 12]","""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" surpassed everything I expected. It's not merely a cool science fiction story; it's an engrossing mystery that probes deeply into matters of faith, not necessarily in a religious context despite the fact that God and Christianity are mentioned a great deal. It's also a much richer examination of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson), both seeming more complete and compelling as characters. This is not an extension of the long-running TV series, nor is it a sequel to the first ""X-Files"" film--""I Want to Believe"" stands entirely on its own, which is a relief because it ran the risk of being bogged down by in jokes and excessive references to material that only a select few remember. Anyone unfamiliar with the series can watch this film and not feel as if they've missed out on anything.That being said, diehard fans are sure to notice everything, not the least of which is the poster hanging in Mulder's room showing a UFO and the boldly printed slogan that doubles as the film's secondary title. This poster is surrounded by dozens of pinned-up photos and newspaper clippings, all of which display headlines that challenge rational thinking. Could these events really happen, or are they just the imaginative lies of some newspaper writer? Mulder doesn't know, but as the film's title suggests, he wants to believe. The problem is that he no longer believes in the FBI, and they certainly don't believe in him anymore, not with his previous attachments to the X-Files investigations and their outrageous theories. He now spends his days secluded in his home, technically wanted by the FBI but left alone because he's no longer a nuisance.As it turns out, the FBI needs his help, and the only way to find him is to find Scully, now a full-time physician at a Catholic-run hospital. She reluctantly agrees to ask Mulder, and he reluctantly agrees to help the FBI. Agent Mosley Drummy (Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) and ASAC Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) give him his briefing: A female agent has been kidnapped in the snowy town of Somerset, West Virginia, and so far, the only clues are a severed male arm and a man who claims to have had visions of her. This apparent psychic is Joseph Crissman (Billy Connolly), a registered pedophile who was formerly a priest. Naturally, no one wants to even consider that a man who molested young boys has any reliable information. This is especially true of Scully; she hates him with a passion.Mulder, stubborn man that he is, listens to what he has to say, and that's because--you guessed it--he wants to believe. Scully refuses to play into Crissman's words, which seems to be what Mulder is doing. From her point of view, her former partner is stuck in the past, unable to let go of his long-since-dead sister. From his point of view, it has nothing to do the past--it's all about the signs he's being given, and right now, all signs point to a missing woman and a man who can lead the FBI to her. Mulder begs for Scully's support, but after years of chasing monsters and madmen in dark places, it seems she's unable to give him any.But as the film progresses, we gradually discover that Scully is in a dark place of her own. One of her patients is a young boy with a rare brain disease, and despite her best efforts, all conventional treatments have failed. The only remaining option is a highly experimental stem cell procedure, which the hospital administration is unwilling to consider. Much like Mulder, Scully is consumed, not only with wanting to save a life, but also with wanting to believe in something that many others don't (or won't). She insists that the staff can't overlook the wishes of the primary physician, and if they have a problem with that, they should speak to someone of a higher authority. A very influential member of the staff, Father Ybarra (Adam Godley), tells Scully that he's spoken with the highest authority there is, and maybe she should do the same. But what if she already has? What if this highest authority was guiding her all along, telling her to not give up?And could the same thing be guiding Mulder, a man who often goes out on a limb with very little to support him? If he is right about Father Crissman, then that would mean a vile man is the key to saving a woman's life. Do we commend the Devil for doing God's work? Do we praise the wicked for aiding the good?You may have noticed that I said nothing regarding the whereabouts of the missing FBI agent. I did that on purpose--intertwined with Mulder and Scully's story is a subplot involving medical experimentation, a subplot so delightfully outrageous that I dare not spoil it for anyone. Rest assured it's about as sinister as you expect it to be, maybe more so. Director and co-writer Chris Carter skillfully builds the apprehension as the final confrontation draws near, teasing the audience with bleak winter landscapes and isolation and sudden moments of fright. But the greatness of ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" was achieved with more than slow buildups of tension and terrifying images; the characters are finally complete, now emotionally driven as well as professionally. Better still is a story that actually forces the audience to think, somewhat about the mysterious plot but more so about what we believe and what we want to believe. Yes, the film's title is a fitting one.",5,The Truth is a Matter of Faith,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,5395,"['X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'surpassed', 'everything', 'expected', 'not', 'merely',

1171416,A3P2POCHUYTJO4,B001BCO8XQ,clang_the_o,"[2, 2]","Despite being a self-professed X-Phile, it actually took me a few days, to really appreciate ""The X-Files: I Want To Believe.""  There are so many simply-stated nuisances in this movie that are not only easy to miss, but easy to misconstrue and therefore label negatively.  I feel this is what has happened with some reviewers, who (except for Roger Ebert who I believe has the final word anyway) have mostly garnished this latest cinematic addition to the X-Files universe with unsavory attention.Firstly, I don't believe critics are measuring this movie on a proper scale.  It is not an ""Incredible Hulk.""  It's not a ""Dark Knight.""  There are no huge explosions, no bigger-than-life villains, and not one CGI character.  However, the impact eye candy these mega-blockbusters provide is more than present here, only more understated, more cerebral.  In effect, IWTB is the anti of these movies.  Its quiet, intuitive moments happen ""to"" you, instead of ""at"" you.  Will you be entertained?  I should think so.  Will you be intrigued, causing you to think on this film days after you've seen it?  Absolutely.  If you are expecting, however, a nail-biting thriller or a creepy X-Files-esque mystery, you won't really find it.  There are no aliens.  There's not a conspiracy.  In fact, the only X-File here is what the human heart is actually capable of.  Yes, the creep factor is there, but the actual X-File is really only an excuse for us to drop in on the lives of our favorite paranormal investigators.As far as the story, there are actually two deeply intertwined, parallel plots in IWTB.  As Scully makes hard decisions on behalf of a sick child, villains make unspeakable decisions on behalf of themselves.  Scully's storyline is actually my favorite, and makes me appreciate Scully as a character and Anderson as an actress even more than I did before the film.  Knowing what Scully has gone through (as a mother) will help you appreciate this even more.  And then, there's faith.  Faith is, after all, the very issue of the movie, the meaning of the title.  Salvation is also a major theme.  Scully, an on again off again Catholic since we first met her, has always struggled to reconcile God and science--what she can prove and control vs. what she can only trust in as truth, what she knows in her heart.  By the end of the film, she seems a bit more reconciled to what she knew all along.  Her struggles are not unlike Mulder's, who is constantly seeking yet never accepting the truth that is so plainly evident.  Their complicated relationship, rendered BEAUTIFULLY here by superb performances by both Anderson and Duchovny, is at the very heart of this movie.  As a couple they are both destined and doomed...engrossed in a deep, preternatural love yet constantly pulled by their respective passions.  In the end, it is a question of faith: faith in each other, faith in themselves, faith in the power of Light to overcome Darkness.  Essentially, IWTB is a story of two people coming to terms with who they were, who they are now, and who they can be together.  IWTB's unfailing message is this:  Just believe.",4,A Reason to Believe,1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,3122,"['being', 'self-professed', 'X-Phile', 'actually', 'took', 'few', 'days', 'really', 'appreciate', 'X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'simply-stated', 'nuisances', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'easy', 'miss', 'easy', 'misconstrue', 'therefore', 'label', 'negatively', 'feel', 'happened', 'reviewers', 'who', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'believe', 'final', 'word', 'anyway', 'have', 'mostly', 'garnished', 'latest', 'cinematic', 'addition', 'X-Files', 'universe', 'unsavory', 'attention.Firstly', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'critics', 'are', 'measuring', 'movie', 'proper', 'scale', 'not', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'not', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'are', 'huge', 'explosions', 'bigger-than-life', 'villains', 'not', 'one', 'CGI', 'character', 'However', 'impact', 'eye', 'candy', 'mega-blockbusters', 'provide', 'more', 'present', 'here', 'only', 'more', 'understated', 'more', 'cerebral', 'effect', 'IWTB', 'anti', 'movies', 'quiet', 'intuitive', 'moments', 'happen', 'instead', 'Will', 'be', 'entertained', 'should', 'think', 'so', 'Will', 'be', 'intrigued', 'causing', 'think', 'film', 'days', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Absolutely', 'are', 'expecting', 'however', 'nail-biting', 'thriller', 'creepy', 'X-Files-esque', 'mystery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'are', 'aliens', 'not', 'conspiracy', 'fact', 'only', 'X-File', 'here', 'what', 'human', 'heart', 'actually', 'capable', 'Yes', 'creep', 'factor', 'there', 'actual', 'X-File', 'really', 'only', 'excuse', 'drop', 'lives', 'favorite', 'paranormal', 'investigators.As', 'far', 'story', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'deeply', 'intertwined', 'parallel', 'plots', 'IWTB', 'Scully', 'hard', 'decisions', 'behalf', 'sick', 'child', 'villains', 'make', 'unspeakable', 'decisions', 'behalf', 'Scully', 'storyline', 'actually', 'favorite', 'appreciate', 'Scully', 'character', 'Anderson', 'actress', 'even', 'more', 'did', 'film', 'Knowing', 'what', 'Scully', 'gone', 'through', 'mother', 'will', 'help', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'then', 'faith', 'Faith', 'very', 'issue', 'movie', 'meaning', 'title', 'Salvation', 'also', 'major', 'theme', 'Scully', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'Catholic', 'first', 'met', 'always', 'struggled', 'reconcile', 'God', 'science', 'what', 'can', 'prove', 'control', 'vs.', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'trust', 'truth', 'what', 'heart', 'end', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'reconciled', 'what', 'knew', 'along', 'struggles', 'are', 'not', 'Mulder', 'who', 'constantly', 'seeking', 'yet', 'never', 'accepting', 'truth', 'so', 'plainly', 'evident', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'rendered', 'BEAUTIFULLY', 'here', 'superb', 'performances', 'Anderson', 'Duchovny', 'very', 'heart', 'movie', 'couple', 'are', 'destined', 'doomed', 'engrossed', 'deep', 'preternatural', 'love', 'yet', 'constantly', 'pulled', 'respective', 'passions', 'end', 'question', 'faith', 'faith', 'other', 'faith', 'faith', 'power', 'Light', 'overcome', 'Darkness', 'Essentially', 'IWTB', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'coming', 'terms', 'who', 'were', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'IWTB', 'unfailing', 'message', 'Just', 'believe']",The X-Files TV Series

1171418,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001BCO8XQ,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 3]","While anticipation is a natural thing when a movie released over the summer, when the long-gestating and well-guarded sequel to the ""X-Files"" is nearing release, fans are sent into a frenzy and the main feeling felt all around is: it's about time. So of course interest and the want to find out what the movie was actually about goes into overdrive and leaks and fake spoilers were thrown around all over the internet so when you walked into that theater, you had no clue what you're in for. And what did they get? A small scale character-driven story focusing more on development, creepiness and intrigue. So on one hand, the bigger moments from the first film, ""Fight the Future"" has been taken down, the film came out around the time of the ""Dark Knight"" juggernaut came out and it was a story that didn't center on the alien conspiracy mythos so how's it in the end? Pretty good, I'd say.An FBI agent is abducted and Agents Whitney and Drummy are getting nowhere even with a possible psychic named Father Joe. Racing against time and no leads to speak of, they enlist the help of former FBI Agent Fox Mulder who's gone into seclusion thanks to not only his work on the X-Files but the government sees him as dangerous and too knowledgable whereas everybody else thinks he's just nuts. Brought on as well is Agent Scully, now a medical doctor at a Catholic hospital. One's reluctant to return to their agent ways while the other just wants to find...something to believe in. But solving the case while dealing with their own issues and their beliefs is tested when Father Joe is revealed to be a convicted pedophile and former religious man yet seems to be the best help on the case.Over the course of the 9 seasons The X-Files were in production on, episodes were usually divided into 2 camps: the mythology episodes which dealt with Cigarette Smoking Man, Samantha Mulder and the truth that the agents are trying to uncover. The other half were the so-called ""stand alones"" which were comedy episodes like ""Humbug"", creature of the week-types like ""Squeeze"" to more character-driven episodes such as ""One Breath"". The second film is more along these lines as there's no aliens or conspiracies and the tone is a lot less grander than the first film and there's a feeling that this is what made the film a slight disappointment. 6 years after the show ended and instead of a grand tour-de-force comeback, they change conventions and do something smaller and in a way I appreciate it though on the other hand, the main plot isn't really as integral or important as last time though the character journeys are so while the actual missing FBI agent story is kind of interesting, it's not really as satisfying.However, returning to these characters after so long is very satisfying and seeing old habits that still don't die hard such as Mulder's seed eating or his strange desire to litter his ceiling with pencils is a nice see. But seeing the old faces, even old names be mentioned and neat cameos (look closely at the woman Mulder passes by in the FBI...looks similar to the photo on his door, no?) It's also a lot more smarter than most summer blockbusters and the issue of faith and science and believing in things such as giving a young child a terminal illness while a former pedophilic priest helping solve a case is dealt with certainly a lot more depth. It's kind of a movie built for the smaller screen that was released on the bigger screen so kind of a strange situation.That said there are some things the film could've done better. While acting wise, Duchovny and Anderson still carry the chemistry and attitudes their characters have (especially Anderson who's being way too underutilized in movies lately), Xzibit is kind of one-note and Amanda Peet's character, while apparently meant to be a possible love triangle subplot or least more than just another agent that gets called in, doesn't have much development on her side either. Oh and Skinner is basically a cameo but then again so were the Lone Gunmen last time so there needed to be one other I guess.While one can very much blame the release of the film and the massive success of Batman as well as Indiana Jones 4, Hulk and Iron Man for the relative disappointment the film did in theaters, the film does succeed if one doesn't think this is to be the explosive follow-up 6 years in the making and while it does have issues, I still was entertained by it.

1171419,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,B001BCO8XQ,Condor Libros,"[1, 2]","Not utterly terrible, but close - and likely the ultimate end of the franchise. The script is bad, the story uninspired, and the acting by the leads feels curiously tired. Indeed, there is such a lack of inertia to this X-File - a creative stagnation and a laziness of plot - that it seems no one involved had any real interest in it outside of the dream of potential remuneration (and considering the justly paltry revenue this thing took in, I'd guess that dream was quashed).When this movie appeared, ""The X-Files"" had been off air for almost six years. It had been even longer since Agents Mulder and Scully had appeared together on a regular basis, and even longer since the leads had displayed any visible interest in their roles. Having once loved the show, I lost interest when I thought I detected the actors exhaustion (for the record, that was near season six). Even so, it would have been a nice surprise to find a well-crafted picture - for the sake of nostalgia, if nothing else. But alas, the results of this offering aren't good. Duchovny and Anderson are actors who can project a natural intelligence, but here they're saddled with a hackneyed script that provides them with laughably clich&eacute;d dialogue and logical gaps galore. Worse, these guys still seem tired. Time hasn't heightened their interest, and while it's lovely to see them paired up again, I wish they'd had more energy.I used to enjoy this show, back in the day. But then time marched on, and so did I. Occasionally I'd see the actors pop up in other venues and Id smile, thinking - ""Hey, there's so and so..."" - and then I'd move on. Then this film brought the show back from the dead, briefly rekindling my interest.

There's a lot of snowfall, bodies/body parts are found in frozen lakes, and a snow plow is driven by an evil dude as he commits evil deeds. Director and co-writer Chris Carter artfully makes the snow a key character, alongside Mulder (David Duchovney) and Scully (Gillian Anderson).I knew very little about the X Files before watching this film.

1171427,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B001BCO8XQ,Daryl B,"[1, 2]","Long a fan of the television show and the first film, I like other dedicated viewers of The X Files have, with great anticipation, looked forward to the sequel and the reunion of quirky couple Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.  With a stand alone story that could be understood by first timers, Chris Carter delivers a mystery that has chilling moments and gives us glimmers of why we loved the television series in the first place.Scully, now a doctor at Our Lady of Sorrows hospital, is dedicated to her patients, in paticular a young boy suffering a rare disease.  When her former employer, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, contacts her and asks her to locate her old partner, Fox Mulder, she and Mulder are drawn into a mysterious case involving the disappearance of an agent.  The Bureau's one lead is a priest (and convicted pedophile) who has visions and seems to be connected to the kidnapped victim and her captor.  Convinced Mulder can aid in the case due to his years of dealing with unexplained phenomenon, agent Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) hopes that the ex-agent (now forgiven his problems with the FBI) will make a break in the case.Chris Carter, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are a welcomed addition to the summer box office.  The movie, though not as action driven as other box office hits, is still a good film, though it seems to be lost among a summer season of huge hits and the unstoppable Dark Knight juggernaut.  Duchovony and Anderson fit easily into the roles that made them famous and their relationship in this film is touching, complicated and nicely acted.  Amanda Peet is a fair addition as the agent who brings the duo back together for the case and Billy Connolly gives a good performance as a priest fighting the demons within him and trying to right himself in God's eyes.  As ever, Fox remains the beleagured believer and Scully, the questioning skeptic.  Scully's faith in God is tested in both the suffering of her young patient and in dealing with a man of God who has commited such horrific crimes. Carter's story relies on the questions that has always propelled these two people into the darker recesses of humanity.The things, for me, that didn't work in this big screen version of the show was agent Mosley Drummy (played by rapper Xzibit).  The character was thoroughly unlikeable and simply added nothing to the story.  The story itself was good but moved slower than I expected and could have benefited from a little more action.  The unfortunate truth is that this movie came out about 5 years too late.  A lot of fans have moved on to new shows like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"".  It seems, by the showing of poor performance at the box office, that only the diehard fans are showing up to see the film...which is a shame.  I am not sure, after the disappointing take at the box office, if we'll see more of Scully and Mulder.  Hopefully, the dvd rentals and sales will justify, at least one more movie, to sum up the story of Fox and Dana.  There is another great X File movie out there.

1171434,A3VQLTB724O77W,B001BCO8XQ,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[0, 1]","The X-files was always an odd show.  There was the long running story about black-oil aliens, government conspiracy, the smoking man and the like.  And there were the one-off episodes, that generally resolved within a single show--the embedded twin in the carnival was one of the most striking.  The two X-Files movies, Fight the Future and I Want To Believe, each represent one of these different streams.  The first film, Fight the Future, took up the black-oil alien story and took it much further than the TV series ever had.  Like the TV series, though, nothing much was resolved, and Mulder and Scully are left with no proof of the horrifying government conspiracy with evil aliens that has been going on for decades.  Naturally enough, fans thought that I Want To Believe would take up that storyline, since waiting years for a film isn't really the same as being delayed a week for a one-off; and the idea that a film is more significant than a single TV episode, in length and budget.  But our expectations were dashed.  Chris Carter and his crew were more dedicated to the dichotomous nature of the series than we hoped, and so the second movie was the equivalent of a one-off, only longer.  David Duchovny explained ""I think we're going back to the 'monster of the week' type feel, where if you're not an avid fan and don't understand the mythology, you can still come to it and get the movie.""  But the strategy backfired.  Most fans seem to have been disappointed at the result--I certainly was.  Granted, the story was strange, but not particularly compelling; special effects were minimal, and the whole altogether incomprehensible and slow moving.  There's a disgraced priest who is not only a pedophile, but hey, also psychic; there are mad scientists and a disembodied head; there is snow and desolate landscapes, and of course the frission between Mulder and Scully, but it just doesn't add up to anything.  Essentially the show is misnamed; we don't want to BELIEVE, we want to KNOW, and on the X Files, that will never happen.  But I think this film has driven the stake through the heart of the whole franchise; the projected third film (reputed in an interview with Chris Carter to have gone back to the alien storyline) will probably never materialize.",2,Whaaaaaat?,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2276,"['X-files', 'was', 'always', 'odd', 'show', 'was', 'long', 'running', 'story', 'black-oil', 'aliens', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'smoking', 'man', 'like', 'were', 'one-off', 'episodes', 'generally', 'resolved', 'single', 'show', 'embedded', 'twin', 'carnival', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'striking', 'two', 'X-Files', 'movies', 'Fight', 'Future', 'Want', 'Believe', 'represent', 'one', 'different', 'streams', 'first', 'film', 'Fight', 'Future', 'took', 'up', 'black-oil', 'alien', 'story', 'took', 'much', 'further', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'had', 'TV', 'series', 'nothing', 'much', 'was', 'resolved', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'left', 'proof', 'horrifying', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'evil', 'aliens', 'been', 'going', 'decades', 'Naturally', 'enough', 'fans', 'thought', 'Want', 'Believe', 'would', 'take', 'up', 'storyline', 'waiting', 'years', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'same', 'being', 'delayed', 'week', 'one-off', 'idea', 'film', 'more', 'significant', 'single', 'TV', 'episode', 'length', 'budget', 'expectations', 'were', 'dashed', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'crew', 'were', 'more', 'dedicated', 'dichotomous', 'nature', 'series', 'hoped', 'so', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'equivalent', 'one-off', 'only', 'longer', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'explained', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'back', ""'monster"", 'week', 'type', 'feel', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'avid', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'mythology', 'can', 'still', 'come', 'get', 'movie', 'strategy', 'backfired', 'Most', 'fans', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'result', 'certainly', 'was', 'Granted', 'story', 'was', 'strange', 'not', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'minimal', 'whole', 'altogether', 'incomprehensible', 'slow', 'moving', 'disgraced', 'priest', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'pedophile', 'hey', 'also', 'psychic', 'are', 'mad', 'scientists', 'disembodied', 'head', 'snow', 'desolate', 'landscapes', 'course', 'frission', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'anything', 'Essentially', 'show', 'misnamed', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'BELIEVE', 'want', 'KNOW', 'X', 'Files', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'think', 'film', 'driven', 'stake', 'heart', 'whole', 'franchise', 'projected', 'third', 'film', 'reputed', 'interview', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'alien', 'storyline', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'materialize']",The X-Files TV Series

The FBI lead investigators (nicely played by Amanda Peet and Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) find themselves out of their depth and seek out former agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprising their roles).  Scully is working as a doctor at a Catholic hospital, trying to save a young boy with a nominally terminal illness.  Mulder is living in seclusion in a rural cottage, avoiding the FBI.  The FBI offers them a clean slate if they will help.Thus begins a bizarre case that would have been a solid ""monster of the week"" episode from the series.  Mulder and Scully wrestle with clues that defy easy explanation; the credulous Mulder and the skeptical Scully will debate their meaning while racing to stop a hideous medical experiment.  In a thrilling conclusion, Scully will call upon an old FBI friend to help rescue Mulder, whose relentless pursuit of the clues leaves him in mortal danger.Carter and Spotnitz largely avoid X-Files conspiracy mythology while delivering the standard format of the TV series.  Most satisfying to this reviewer, they honor the nuanced relationship between Mulder and Scully, who pick up their repartee without missing a beat.  The progression of their relationship since the end of the series is revealed in an extremely well-done bedroom sequence in which Scully ponders aloud the case of her dying patient.""The X-Files: I Want To Believe"" is highly recommended to fans of the TV series.  Newcomers may find the self-referential plot and characters difficult to follow.  Fans should enjoy seeing what amounts to a new and extended TV episode whose concluding sequence offers some hopeful closure in the best tradition of the X-Files.  Be sure to watch all the way through the closing credits for a nice postscript to the story.",4,X-Files: Redemption...,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,2281,"['X-Files', 'TV', 'series', 'untidy', 'conclusion', 'left', 'fans', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', '2008', 'X', 'Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'producers', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'attempt', 'scratch', 'itch', 'fan', 'base', 'TV', 'series', 'should', 'find', 'result', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfying.As', 'story', 'female', 'FBI', 'agent', 'subjected', 'brutal', 'kidnapping', 'FBI', 'principal', 'lead', 'case', 'disgraced', 'pedophile', 'priest', 'Billy', 'Connally', 'psychic', 'visions', 'kidnapping', 'FBI', 'lead', 'investigators', 'nicely', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Alvin', 'Xzibit', 'Joiner', 'find', 'depth', 'seek', 'out', 'former', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'reprising', 'roles', 'Scully', 'working', 'doctor', 'Catholic', 'hospital', 'trying', 'save', 'young', 'boy', 'nominally', 'terminal', 'illness', 'Mulder', 'living', 'seclusion', 'rural', 'cottage', 'avoiding', 'FBI', 'FBI', 'clean', 'slate', 'will', 'help.Thus', 'bizarre', 'case', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'solid', 'monster', 'week', 'episode', 'series', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'wrestle', 'clues', 'defy', 'easy', 'explanation', 'credulous', 'Mulder', 'skeptical', 'Scully', 'will', 'debate', 'meaning', 'racing', 'stop', 'hideous', 'medical', 'experiment', 'thrilling', 'conclusion', 'Scully', 'will', 'call', 'old', 'FBI', 'friend', 'help', 'rescue', 'Mulder', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'clues', 'mortal', 'danger.Carter', 'Spotnitz', 'largely', 'avoid', 'X-Files', 'conspiracy', 'mythology', 'delivering', 'standard', 'format', 'TV', 'series', 'Most', 'satisfying', 'reviewer', 'honor', 'nuanced', 'relationship', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'repartee', 'missing', 'beat', 'progression', 'relationship', 'end', 'series', 'revealed', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'bedroom', 'sequence', 'Scully', 'ponders', 'aloud', 'case', 'dying', 'patient', 'X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'Newcomers', 'may', 'find', 'self-referential', 'plot', 'characters', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'what', 'amounts', 'new', 'extended', 'TV', 'episode', 'concluding', 'sequence', 'offers', 'hopeful', 'closure', 'best', 'tradition', 'X-Files', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'way', 'closing', 'credits', 'nice', 'postscript', 'story']",The X-Files TV Series

1171437,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B001BCO8XQ,dv_forever,"[4, 8]","Back in the day I was an X-Files fan. Was I hardcore? No. Nothing over the top but I greatly enjoyed the show and out of it's 202 episodes, ( I think ), over the span of 9 seasons, I watched a good 180 episodes at least, maybe 190. I rarely watch the re-runs now but when they come up, it's something I've already seen, so it leads me to believe I've seen almost all of them.I also enjoyed the ""Fight the Future"" film, directed by Rob Bowman. It was convoluted but involving, well-made and worked in the context of the show. It had texture, drama, scope and a narrative grandeur that this new X-Files film completely lacks. Not to mention that ""I Want to Believe"" is a low budget little movie. It looks and feels cheap while ""Fight the Future"" has the explosions, chases, special effects, crane shots, location photography with cities, nature, snowscapes and lots of aliens! It's a no brainer, ""Fight the Future"" is far superior filmmaking and storytelling. But before I really rip into Chris Carter's deficient new film, I want to relay the technical merits of this Blu-ray disc to all the High-Def enthusiasts out there.The transfer is very nice. The movie takes place in the dead of winter and snow sure looks gorgeous on Blu-ray! The daytime scenes are sharp and have a life like quality to them but this is X-Files after all and we spent a great deal of time at night. The night photography picks up natural grain but overall is pleasing to the eye. There is no color oversaturization and flesh tones are normal. The film is not a spectacular visual feast but for what it is, this Blu-ray acquits itself rather nicely. A good, solid film-like look that has always suited The X-Files.The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 but this film is not an over the top action-fest so there will be no major workout for your speakers. The extra features are substantial with a commentary from Chris Carter and co-writer Frank Spotnitz. An X-Files timeline that allows you to explore the entire X-files show in order with video clips and plot summaries. This is one for the fans indeed!The rest of the extras include the necessary featurettes, promotional stuff, a digital copy of the movie, a gag reel and four! picture in picture features. One is Carter's video commmentary, another is a behind the scenes track, then a storyboard track and one of concept art. Basically a bunch of stuff you've never going to get around to but it's nice to know the studio went out of their way to outfit this disc and not wait for an eventual double dip.Now I want to rip this movie a bit, so bear with me... The studio or Chris Carter or you can blame both... simply waited too long to get this turkey moving. Carter was able to obtain a budget of a mere $30 million. The first feature was a far more substantial enterprise. However, big budgets don't mean big quality, they usually mean diminishing returns, artistically speaking. So the idea is to make an X-Files film but downplay the blockbuster qualities and focus on a compelling narrative and sturdy character development of our beloved F.B.I. agents and their new supporting characters. Sounded like a good plan but too bad the filmmakers had no real story to tell. They were just mining the past with no purpose at hand other than cashing in on some nostalgia perhaps.Take a very average to poor X-Files episode, stretch it out to nearly two hours and you'll get something approximating this dismal experience of a movie. The story as you already know does not deal with any of the alien conspiracy stuff. That's ok. But what a lifeless, plodding tale they tell here! Mulder and Scully are recruited by Amanda Peet and Xzibit, yes Xzibit, to help them with a murder investigation! Xzibit, X-Files, you gotta love it! The guy is not awful as an actor and his presence is not distracting, so whatever. Give him props for going out on a limb and doing something different. The supernatural element comes into play via a defrocked Catholic priest, ( played with screen chewing urgency by Billy Connolly ), who is experiencing visions and leads the crimefighters to try and solve the murder and abduction cases that form the narrative drive of the film. Now this priest has an ugly past. He is trying to atone for his sins. Let's see if you can guess what those are? Take the most cliched Catholic priest storyline you can think of and you've got it. Can you guess, do I have to even spell it out? Of course not.I was really not interested in this story, it was dreadfully predictable. Here is the rational scientist/doctor Scully who is also an ardent Catholic and here is the irrational, ""I'll believe anything and everything"", except perhaps orthodox religion, former Agent Mulder. We've been fed this storyline so many times before and this time the scenario our duo is in is not in the least bit intriguing or exciting. The film is lifeless, silly, at times pretentious and pummels the legacy of The X-Files into the ground. One of the best televisions shows of the 1990s and this is what the fans get for a last hurrah? Ahhh!Another element of the paranormal comes into play with the introduction of body snatchers who swap human heads and bodies. This ridiculous story point reminded me of those goofy Youtube videos of the disembodied dog head being experimented upon by Soviet scientists in the 1950s. These fake videos were always good for a laugh and you can't help but make the silly comparison to the story in this movie.Before the movie opened, I became aware of the bad buzz around it and read the almost uniformly negative reviews of the film. I skipped the film in the theater but I wanted to see it on Blu-ray. Lowering my expectations, I sat down to watch this travesty and concluded that I should have just dropped my expectations completely down the well.I know X-Files fans will have to see it but you'll just torture yourself by doing so. It's lousy, boring, insipid filmmaking, the kind you see often in Hollywood as the people involved try to make a last play at a big paycheck. I'll stick to the earlier film and the many great episodes of the television show.",2,The X-Files: I Want to Believe ( Blu-ray review ) Get this awful movie out of my PS3!,1232409600,"01 20,

The complete series...on 1 to 2 discs.  Yeah, sure buddy, you go ahead and think that.  Considering that Season 2 of Heroes, which was only half of a season due to the writer's strike, is 4 discs in length, It is impossible that a show that has 24 episodes per season, and 9 seasons (let's see here, that's approximately 216 episodes) would fit on 1 to 2 BD's.  Heroes season 2 = 11 episodes, and yet it took up 4 discs.  And you think 216 episodes will fit on 1 to 2?

Then I saw it. It was slow moving and did not make a whole lot of sense, like the FBI is just gonna call Mulder and Scully and say all is forgiven if you help find one agent. And how is Scully working under her real name---wasn't she considered an accomplice in his escape? Despite this horrific implausible bumps in the road, the story was slow paced. I had to buy the book to fill in the gaps. It was disappointing.While I agree, Scully and Mulder's relationship was nice to see, it was difficult when they argued and when they made references to wanting to leave each other. I don't think that's going to happen so why even introduce it. I feel that Chris Carter should give these two a real happy ending with their son(not the cheesy boat thing at the end).Overall, I felt the series had far superior episodes than this film.

(This could be because he's hidden inside for a decade, but why not just follow Scully home and poke around, put a sonic ear on the windows of the house or something?)2) A convicted child-molesting priest convinces the FBI he has visions and can find bodies . . . and the FBI not only believes him but gives him its full support.3) Somewhat confusing climax that goes unexplained, but really shouldn't.  A brief discussion between Mulder and Skinner could have dispelled any confusion at the end.4) Dana Scully performs a web search on ""stem cell therapy"" and then conducts a stem-cell operation within days of the search.  Makes it look as though she boned up on radical forms of treatment via the Internet and then performed major surgery with what she learned.5) The FBI's need for Mulder on their case is weak.

I was thrilled to see Mulder and Scully back in action in I Want To Believe (an oft used phrase in the series and the sentence written on Mulder's flying saucer poster).  I saw this in the theatre twice and own the DVD.  The story has been well-covered in the other reviews, so I won't rehash it, but I was very impressed with this entry, especially because it did not play out in such a way that ensured box office success.  It's a dark, creepy thriller that does not rely on special effects, shoot-outs, or snide one-liners.  The script is literate and thoughtful debate on faith, moral and practical applications in the medical profession, and about two people still trying to connect and understand each other, despite the fact they have known a greater intimacy than any other television couple/duo.  I loved that the film moved away from the series' alien mythology to explore the kind of story the show was famous for . . .the self-contained story with supernatural overtones.  The film never betrays the series by pretending certain events didn't happen, nor does Mulder or Scully rejoin the FBI.  It stays true to how the series ended and what became of the characters (neither are agents anymore).  As Roger Ebert observed, there are guns present, but no one is shot.  There are special effects, none spectacular or show-stopping (as in Fight the Future), but exist to serve the story powerfully.  The make-up effects at the end are a creep-out!  This is the kind of thriller Hollywood used to have the balls to make.  The film serves as a great stepping stone to re-engage Mulder and Scully in future stories, as I understand, are in the works.  Nice supporting performances from Amanda Peet and Mitch Pileggi.  I LOVED Billy Connoly as the very morally compromised priest, receiving psychic visions of the murder victims.  He was overlooked at awards time for a performance that was understated and mysterious, a lesser actor would have taken it over the top.  As a pedophile priest, he never makes excuses for his actions, but comes close to dare i say it . . .sympathy.The X-Files I Want To Believe brings the series back to form in a way that allowed audiences to either love it or hate it.  Chris Carter did not make any compromises to his vision . . sve of course the extended version which allows for more gore than the PG-13 version as well as a few character bits(the extended is better).  Bravo to him.  And I hope this means a return to the big screen for future outings, despite the film's mediocre box office.  Watch with an open mind away from the hype and expectations.

The reason I say that is because Chris Carter has been quoted as saying that this one will have to prove successful to justify 20th Century Fox greenlighting a third sequel. And I don't think enough ""X-PHILES"" like my wife and I turned out for this one. And that's a shame too because this is a very well scripted and acted film. With plenty of action and humor to boot. I've read alot of reviews saying this was like an episode of the t.v. show. There's nothing wrong with that actually since it's because of this great t.v. show that we went to see the movie anyway. Because we remember how great the show was and how the mysteries unravelled slowly and that was the fun of it watching Scully and Mulder figure it all out despite being led and misled in every direction. We kept tuning in week after week. This movie has has been hacked on for being slow. Well, if slow means it took time to develop a plot. Then to some people I guess it was. I prefer to think of it as intelligently made. It presented a well thought out mystery for our favorite former F.B.I. agents to solve and just like a great episode from the series they didn't get it done in 10 minutes. With this movie we were treated to a plotline. So I guess it did play like an episode. A great episode from what was in my opinion the best show to hit television in the last 20 years. In closing let me say if you were a fan of the show, give this great film a shot, you'll like it. However if you need explosions and a ridiculously high body count. Look elsewhere.

I was thrilled when the movie came out because obviously we can't have enough of Mulder and Scully.The movie starts off with The X Files no longer a department in the FBI, Scully is a Dr. in what seems like a hospital run by the church and Mulder is doing nothing. A disappearance case comes up so the FBI decide that Mulder should help them out and so an agent is sent to Dr. Scully asking her to convince Mulder in helping them.Of course Scully goes ahead and convinces Mulder in joining the search for the missing agent. This is all building up well so far but what struck me as odd was that Mulder and Scully were finally an item.The whole premise of the show was built on the sexual tension between the two and as fans we were all wanting them to be together but seeing them together actually spoiled it for me.Also both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson did not seem to be giving it their all. The acting was mediocre and somehow felt forced on them(maybe that's because they both wished they were doing something else yet were back to doing The X Files once again) i have no idea.The storyline was very weak and unfolded as would any other thriller, not in the classic X Files way. Come to think of it the whole case was not really an X File per say. I did not understand how this random case pertains to Mulder's sister's disappearance, which was the reason he agreed to help the FBI.It is an OK movie and for most people it could even be good but for a fan like me, it just did not pass The X Files standards.A must see for a fan but be prepared for disappointment.",3,What X Files??,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,1764,"['am', 'die-hard', 'X', 'Files', 'fan', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'i', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointed', 'see', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'are', 'used', 'X', 'Files', 'fans', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'Mulder', 'Scully.The', 'movie', 'X', 'Files', 'no', 'longer', 'department', 'FBI', 'Scully', 'Dr.', 'what', 'hospital', 'run', 'church', 'Mulder', 'doing', 'nothing', 'disappearance', 'case', 'up', 'so', 'FBI', 'decide', 'Mulder', 'should', 'help', 'out', 'so', 'agent', 'sent', 'Dr.', 'Scully', 'asking', 'convince', 'Mulder', 'helping', 'them.Of', 'course', 'Scully', 'ahead', 'convinces', 'Mulder', 'joining', 'search', 'missing', 'agent', 'building', 'up', 'well', 'so', 'far', 'what', 'struck', 'odd', 'was', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'were', 'finally', 'item.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'show', 'was', 'built', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'fans', 'were', 'wanting', 'be', 'together', 'seeing', 'together', 'actually', 'spoiled', 'me.Also', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'giving', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'somehow', 'felt', 'forced', 'maybe', 'wished', 'were', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'yet', 'were', 'back', 'doing', 'X', 'Files', 'once', 'again', 'i', 'have', 'idea.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'unfolded', 'as', 'would', 'other', 'thriller', 'not', 'classic', 'X', 'Files', 'way', 'Come', 'think', 'whole', 'case', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'X', 'File', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'random', 'case', 'Mulder', 'sister', 'disappearance', 'was', 'reason', 'agreed', 'help', 'FBI.It', 'OK', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'good', 'fan', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'pass', 'X', 'Files', 'must', 'see', 'fan', 'be', 'prepared', 'disappointment']",The X-Files TV Series

As a fan, it was really great to see X-files come back to the big screen, and even better to see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson back as Mulder and Scully.I give Chris Carter allot of credit for taking risk in this film. I think it was risky  bringing back the X-Files in a plot that doesn't involve UFO's. It was also risky leaving out allot of the fan favorite characters, such as the smoking man, the lone gunmen, Monica Reyes, John Doggett, etc. While it would have been great to see these characters return, I'm glad that didn't just give them brief cameo's just for the heck of it. Carter's new X-Files is a little strange with a plot that focuses on a pedophile priest with psychic powers, but it maintains it's integrity by avoiding being over glamorized.As a fan (and yes fans will enjoy it more) I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was incredibly intense and Carter explained well what happened to Mulder and Scully at the end of season 9. I didn't like the way season 9 ended, and but now it all makes sense.X-files deserves allot of credit, not only as a great SCI-FI, but also as a criminal investigation series, and allot of shows have been influenced by them.

Williams,"[2, 2]","Having never watched a single episode of Chris Carter's ""The X-Files"" or the 1998 feature film, I was relieved when I discovered that the newest addition to the series did not require any previous knowledge of the popular franchise. ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" can truly hold its own against any other crime thriller out there. Instead of building on preexisting plot points, the audience is totally submersed into a brand new story and while I am sure David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's portrayals of agents Fox Mulder and Dana Skully are consistent with any previous work, their performances are fresh and very much alive on screen.In a refreshing twist, the film takes place in a world not too far removed from the present day. Unlike the parallel universe that many movies situate themselves (which looks like the real world but features a never ending parade of explosions, gunfire, and high-speed car chases), Mulder and Skully's latest case is very much rooted in reality, making the events of the plot more horrifying than it would have otherwise.The plot itself is a macabre jig-saw puzzle that had me riveted from the very first scene, which sees a withering, seemingly delusional old man named Father Joe (Bill Connolly) leading a team of FBI agents through a vast field of snow and ice. A severed human arm is found and a bizarre collection of other clues eventually take them to one of the most horrifying villains' lairs I have seen. Complicating things even further is a series of subplots concerning the disappearance of two young women, the constant involvement of the FBI, the questionable past of a conflicted pedophile who claims to have psychic abilities, the plight of one of Dana's diseased patients, and a team of Eastern European medical workers whose contributions to science are considerably less than honorable.Compared to last year's selection of summer movies (which included the disappointing  sequels to the ""Spider-Man"", ""Shrek"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchises), this year has proven itself to be a far more competent season.

1171470,A106016KSI0YQ,B001BCO8XQ,Jay Dickson,"[4, 5]","The great thing that the original X-FILES possessed that practically no other TV series had (with the exceptions only of THE NIGHT STALKER, which the creation of THE X-FILES was inspired by, and TWIN PEAKS) was atmosphere, something that is practically impossible to generate on a small television screen. Its presentation of supernatural creepiness hidden beneath 1990s complacency genuinely could get under your skin on a Friday night and convince you that something was not well in the United States (the episodes generally shifted from small city or town from part of the country to another, eventually covering most of the map). The greatest disappointment of this second X-FILES movie, set something like six years after the series ended, is that it has practically no atmosphere whatsoever, even though the director and series creator Chris Carter wisely decided to eschew the series' excessively complex and convoluted ""mythology"" storyline (involving a ridiculous alien conspiracy) in favor of modeling the film after one of the much better ""stand alone"" episodes involving supernatural cases. But here the supernatural is reduced to an absolute minimum, involving a defrocked pederastic priest (Billy Connolly) helping the FBI find an agent who has been abducted by what turns out to be a killer with about the most ridiculous plan ever for the FBI agent's body.The killer's central plan is supposed to be the source for most of the film's thrills and chills, but since so little explanation is given for it and it echoes so many hilariously bad Z-movies (even one infamously mocked on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000), it's almost impossible to take it very seriously. What we're left with instead is lots of overacting from Gillian Anderson, whose character of Scully has now become a surgeon at a Virginia hospital called Our Lady of Sorrows (subtlety is not this film's strong point) and who is tortured by having to care for a sweetfaced young boy with a rare brain disease. Anderson's great gift in the early episodes of the series was always to suggest Scully was feeling much more than the scripts possibly allowed for her, but once the writers seemed to realize this she was rarely given a director who was capable of reining her in once she got more overtly emotional material; here again she's just too much, and since her subplot is so clich&eacute;d you begin to dread the scenes set back in the hospital.

And so what did we get?A movie so god-awful boring, colorless, badly acted and terribly scripted that it would never even be shown on the Sci-Fi Channel's roster of hideously cheesy films.  although one has to admit the Sci-Fi Channel movies at least move and try to generate some excitement.We're treated to minute after boring, long minute of watching Scully try to save the life of a terminally ill child. Does this kid have anything to do with the so-called plot? It doesn't. Yet, we have to watch and listen to Scully argue and weep and moan about how she is determined to save the boy's life. and most of us were thinking optimistically that hey, here's the eerie part: perhaps the kid's an alien child. But no such luck.And then we have Mulder whose voice is so incredibly monotonous (yes, even more than on the TV series)that he resembles a robot uttering his words. The most hysterical scene involving Mulder is when he just happens to discover a place where body parts are being used. He jumps into the mids of villians, waving a steel wrench, and shouts: ""Stop it!"" Of course these shadowy evil people have no intention of stopping what they're doing and jump all over him. And there are the endless car crashes which come along about every l5 minutes.Just when I thought M. Night Shyamlan had made the worst sci-fi movie ever, THE HAPPENING, along comes this turgid abomination, hideously photographed and hideously empty of any suspense or eerie or creepy people, which forces me to say that this movie can sit right along with THE HAPPENING as the worst sci-fi movies ever made.There's no excitement, no juicy fiends or aliens or anything psychic about this film.  It's just endless talk, talk, talk, as Scully and Mulder stop everything to argue and explain their actions to each other.One can almost imagine X-files creator, Chris Carter, having a power lunch with M. Night and both laughing hysterically as to how they really fooled the movie goers into thinking they were in for a thrill ride.

I thought IWTB was just awful.  It was a wimpy 'pop' when I expected a 'KABOOM'.Dark, humorless and grotesque, this movie struggled and failed to balance a feebly predictable serial killer story with Scully and Mulder's implausibly overdeveloped relationship.

The clear-eyed scientist and the dogged pursuer of the truth who used to be Scully and Mulder have been replaced by a couple of unlikeable and ineffective characters who only physically resemble their namesakes.  In the personas the IWTB moviemakers have given them, the big question was why the FBI would bother to recruit them for this case at all. (And why on earth did the FBI need Scully to find Mulder?) There were so many references to soap operaish events in Mulder and Scully's lives since the last X-Files, I had to Google to make sure I hadn't missed a movie, and there was so much angst floating around, I half expected Woody Allen to put in an appearance.  Hmmmm--now that would have been a nice twist.The only good thing I can say about IWTB is that the cast did an absolutely splendid job of saying some of the worst dialogue in movie history with straight faces.This movie wouldn't even have made a very good episode in the brilliantly imaginative X Files TV series.

There are many shows out there into which this plot could have been transplanted and it would have worked just as well. Obviously, from the reviews, the movie pleased some fans mainly because they are interested in the relationship between Scully and Mulder. If that's your principal interest, you'll probably like this. However, for those of us who are looking for a movie with some bizarre, out-of-this-world content, there's not much to get excited about. This is a straightforward thriller dealing with the boundaries of ethical medical behavior.

In many respects, it reminds me too much of ""Star Trek Generations"", since it shares with that film the rather sad, almost predictable, tendency to act more like an expanded episode of the ""The X-Files"" television series, than as a full-length theatrical release. Like ""Star Trek Generations"" I found this film to be quite boring, and almost a hollow shell of itself (In stark contrast, for example, I had more fun watching a really mediocre film like ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", which I found redeemable only via excellent acting from Brendan Fraser, and especially, Anita Briem.). To put it quite simply, this film reminds me more of a subpar episode from the series, dealing this time in illegal human organ transplants and crazy Russian doctors.So why should you watch this ""The X- Files"" film? There are two reasons, and they are rather obvious: Gillian Anderson as Dr. Dana Scully and David Duchovny as Fox Mulder (There's also a third reason named Mitch Pileggi, but I won't say more without offering any further plot spoilers.). The chemistry between Anderson and Duchovny has always been one of the series' highlights, and, this time, that chemistry goes a bit further than what we've seen before. Much to my surprise, Anderson and Duchovny have reprised successfully their roles without skipping a beat, even though years have passed since the airingof the series' final episode.

Some fans found this story disappointing, a filler in the X-Files mythology.  What a terrible mis-perception.  The transplantation of heads onto alternate bodies is a plot snatched right out of the annals of Classic Science Fiction.I read it first in the Barsoomian adventures of John Carter, Warlord of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The episode was titled Chessmen of Mars,The Chessmen of Mars(also available on Amazon Kindle)The Chessmen of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs (w/ Active Table of Contents and Chapter Navigation) [KINDLE EDITION].As a long time Burroughs fan, I'd call this imitation a sincerely gratifying contemporary flattery.Mulder's best quote I can think of from this epic, is near the end of the film,  ""What if DON'T GIVE UP really is the answer Scully?"" [!!!]  When I saw this film at the theatre , and Dr. Scully entirely invested herself in the stem cell treatment to save the life of a 10 year old patient, I wanted to stand up and cheer.  And while Father Joe's twisted fight to save his soul and that of an Altar boy he molested (now turned body-snatching-transvestite/international-criminal-mastermind), IS a bizarre counter point in true X-Files tradition, I wouldn't miss it.To see all those nurses and nuns, alongside of Dr Scully's fellow physicians watching her, a truly exceptional human being in wonder and hope as she arrives to carry out the impossible surgery, IS to understand how each of us needs to hope.

However, it was a great story, a fast moving, some times gut wrenching effects and some interesting chase scenes.  As a theater movie, maybe getting in to it with the X File fans who would have laughed at a few of the scenes.  The President Bush photo scene, well, I had to stop the video because I was laughing so much, really, just that was worth the whole experience.This was more of a two hour view that could very well have been played as a TV movie special.  It was very well acted, although Mulder and Scully had a not again approach at times, they definately were drawn in by the possibilities.  Additionally, a good thing, some who may not be particularly early X Files fans and who may not be into mere Sci Fi aliens stuff, may be brought in by a more plausible story line.Interestingly, there is a religion/science, religion/medicine conflict that both play through Scully, the sceptic, who has to see the possibilities that occur to her.  Here we also have a conflict between forgiveness and the lack thereof.  Without going into detail, we have a man who has visions (Billy Connolly) and who feels it is part of his redemption, where others feel he is part of the crime.  This creates an excellent story line, where you are having to make a choice yourself in your mind for the person involved.Overall, worth the price of the DVD and to have in your library.  Again, would make a great TV movie.  Hopefully, we will have another, more true to the X Files story line for our next movie, and maybe much sooner than the last.

Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" certainly didn't have the wow, in-your-face, big budget flavor of most summer movies, but in its own way it was just as ambitious as a ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Star Trek"" or any other huge summer franchise extravaganza.  Why?  Because it was brave enough to be small and intimate.  Best movie ever?  Nope.  But the film, with its busy little tale of body parts, psychic phenomena, kidnapping, and faith, is involving and moving (with a few creepy scares scattered about).  And while the producers may have skimped on the number of special effects and huge action scenes, they certainly didn't skimp on beautiful photography, terrific supporting actors (Duchovny and Anderson are great, too) and overall polish. This isn't a shoddy movie.All the DVD versions of this film allow viewers to watch a slightly longer cut of ""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" than the one seen in theaters, which clarifies a few story points and lets viewers see a couple of extra character-based scenes.  The closing credits of the longer cut also features a few hundred cast and crew photographs scattered throughout the credits (needless but harmless).  The theatrical cut is also included on the various DVD versions.My single-disc version of the film features the two cuts of ""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" and, generously, a small handful of extra features.  I say ""generously"" because the producers could have saved all the special features for the multiple-disc versions of the film and just made the single-disc version be ""bare bones"", meaning the movie and nothing else.  But at least we single-disc purchasers get a few extra things to look at after the movie, too.I hope that this isn't the last we'll see of Mulder and Scully, but if it is, this modest but intense little film is a perfectly honorable end to their adventures.",4,Wowing us with story instead of explosions,1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,1839,"['X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wow', 'in-your-face', 'big', 'budget', 'flavor', 'most', 'summer', 'movies', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'ambitious', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Star', 'Trek', 'other', 'huge', 'summer', 'franchise', 'extravaganza', 'Why', 'was', 'brave', 'enough', 'be', 'small', 'intimate', 'Best', 'movie', 'ever', 'Nope', 'film', 'busy', 'little', 'tale', 'body', 'parts', 'psychic', 'phenomena', 'kidnapping', 'faith', 'involving', 'moving', 'few', 'creepy', 'scares', 'scattered', 'producers', 'may', 'have', 'skimped', 'number', 'special', 'effects', 'huge', 'action', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Duchovny', 'Anderson', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'overall', 'polish', ""n't"", 'shoddy', 'movie.All', 'DVD', 'versions', 'film', 'allow', 'viewers', 'watch', 'slightly', 'longer', 'cut', 'X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'one', 'seen', 'theaters', 'few', 'story', 'points', 'viewers', 'see', 'couple', 'extra', 'character-based', 'scenes', 'closing', 'credits', 'longer', 'cut', 'also', 'few', 'hundred', 'cast', 'crew', 'photographs', 'scattered', 'credits', 'needless', 'harmless', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'also', 'included', 'various', 'DVD', 'versions.My', 'single-disc', 'version', 'film', 'two', 'cuts', 'X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'generously', 'small', 'handful', 'extra', 'features', 'say', 'generously', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'special', 'features', 'multiple-disc', 'versions', 'film', 'just', 'made', 'single-disc', 'version', 'be', 'bare', 'bones', 'meaning', 'movie', 'nothing', 'else', 'least', 'single-disc', 'purchasers', 'get', 'few', 'extra', 'things', 'look', 'movie', 'too.I', 'hope', ""n't"", 'last', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'modest', 'intense', 'little', 'film', 'perfectly', 'honorable', 'end', 'adventures']",The X-Files TV Series

I watched the X files in my teen years and loved it, well maybe not so much the later episodes but the show overall was fantastic.  The first movie was o.k. and the sequel curse occurred here.  The whole movie felt like a long episode that was the worst on t.v.  What is the deal with the evil version of the catholic priest anymore and I understand that some have done bad things but man is it really that dark to be a priest.  By that I mean letting children die in the movie or have them as sickos.  I noticed they were trying to step on morality lines which made me think why oh why did they do it.  Just bring in some paranormal activity and ghosts or something.  The movie was lost in its own in my little mind (sarcasm of course)  in its own agenda.  Even at the end it didn't feel like they accomplished anything with the movie.  Next time maybe they will let fans of the show write it and bring back the nostalgia.

Black, plastic, about five by seven inches.  The cover art was simple yet eye-catching, and it did a good job at carrying out its purpose, which is to catch your attention in the video store and rent it or buy it.When I put the DVD in my player, there was some initial concern because an odd noise emanated from my DVD player.  At first I thought something was wrong with the DVD, but it turned out that I had just not seated it properly when I pushed the 'Close' button.  Whew!  I thought surely I'd have to knock stars off the rating, but nope, it was my fault.The DVD played smoothly, with no on-screen distortion, artifacts, or other assorted distractions.  Some movies I've rented recently have had something wrong with their color balance, but this one was just fine in that department.So, in closing, about all I can say (and about all I'm allowed to say) is that the DVD was of average or maybe even a little above-average quality.

There are so many things they could have done with this, and what they did do was just disappointing.Also, the romance between Mulder and Scully and their dialogue was dull.  We knew we were supposed to be laughing many times, but we weren't.  There were two stories that they tried to combine without success.

Did a boy find success with his operations?I got so tired of hearing Scully say she wasn't into the search anymore. How many times does she need to say it before we get it?Amanda Peet and Xzibit don't really fit as FBI agents.The cinematography, in an attempt to be artful, focused too closely on some things and the camera moved around too much.All together the film had no underlying value.

With all the time which was wasted in negotiations and the making of this film I really didn't expect it to be any better than it was, but couldn't help going to see it when it first opened. The most amazing thing to me was that my wife and I were able to see this movie during a matinee attended by no other people and we were the only fans in the theater!  That was a first for unpopularity.For die hard fans of The X-Files I can say that the transfer from film to DVD was excellent as were the various documentaries included which were a bit more interesting than the movie.  I could not understand what the bit was about in keeping this weak plot secret from the world wide web prior to the release and the spreading of miss-information to confuse loyal fans.The only thing really noteworthy about this film was the very excellent props painstakingly developed to be anatomically correct.  The prop people deserve good grades for their efforts on medical anatomy. However, I don't think this level of effort for accurate props was needed for this particular production.I think in order to retain the imagination of loyal viewers of The X-Files this film needed to showcase some brilliant variation of its original theme of an ET related government conspiracy. I guess this is the last time we will be hearing from the team of Scully and Mulder. It was gratifying to see them together again, but clearly not enough to make for a memorable film experience.One sequence I enjoyed in at least the home version of the film (lord knows I didn't stick around long enough in the theater to see it) was an apparantly animated sequence showing from a lofty perspective a lovely bathing suited Scully and Mulder sailing off to a deserted island.

The way Scully found Mulder near the end had me rolling my eyes. Lacking audio/visual presentations, Father Joe's psychic episodes were uninteresting. I think Chris Carter missed a good opportunity to make the movie scarier by not showing us what sort of impressions he was getting. The attempts at humor were too obvious. The villains were stock villains. And then there were the unanswered questions. What does Mulder do for a living besides clip newspaper articles and throw pencils at the cieling? Is he Scully's live-in boy-toy now? Why do they still call each other by their surnames? What were the circumstances of their son's death? Why didn't the FBI agent have her gun on her when she was attacked in her home? Why is Mulder investigating a killer without carrying a gun on his person? When Scully's car was found crashed in the snow with no driver, why weren't bloodhounds being used to track the person who obviously escaped from the car and must now be wandering around in the snow in the dead of night?I was a long time fan of the series and watched it from the beginning through to the end (yes, even after Mulder left the show).

Loria,"[1, 2]","In the early nineties before all of the CSIs & and their many progeny  The X-Files was the go to series for FBI profilers and serial killers partly inspired by the ""Silence of the Lambs"" with some weirdness thrown in, of course that was only a third of the stories the remaining 2 thirds were conspiratorial aliens and monster hunting in the spirit of the Night Stalker series of the 70's.  But as not to ""alienate"" those who may not have followed all the twists and turns of the 9 year run, creator Chris Carter has set-up ""I WANT TO BELIEVE"" as a stand-alone film that focuses on the FBI profiler sub-genre that the series helped to create...with a psychic just to top it off.  So any fans looking for the ""black oil"" or ""alien bounty"" hunters, you'll have to wait for the next X-Files feature film for any ""Mythology"" story ties.As a fan I gotta say it is good to see David Duchovny's Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder and Gillian Anderson's Dr. Dana Scully as the duo comfortably fall back into the iconic sci-fi series archetypes of TRUE BELIEVER and the QUINTESSENTIAL SKEPTIC.  Their relationship has clearly deepened, the pair are no longer with the FBI, but end up aiding the FBI in their search for an abducted agent which stretching into a hunt for a serial killer, which in turn stretches into trailing an illicit organ harvesting operation with the help of a defrocked psychic ex-pedophile ex-priest and played perfectly by the great Billy Connolly. The nature of the character's background and her Catholicism lead her to suspect that he is a fraud or an accomplice, while Mulder is as quick as ever to find answers in the paranormal. People parts turn-up and Scully regrets involving Mulder as he is still motivated by guilt over the loss of his sister, a driving character point from the series very beginning, and fears his compulsion may cost them a lot more in the end.The big screen X-Files Adventure feels right and has all the fixings of a good X-Files episode, even some climactic FBI cameos, and score by Mark Snow, the series original composer. But, does it go beyond that? Probably not, but it is more effective thanX-Files: FIGHT THE FUTURE.  I look forward to the 2012 follow-up, to focus on the Mayan ""Doomsday"" prophecy (set for 2012, and a focal point for the X-Files spin-off Millennium ).",4,"X hits the SPOT.....big screen return of the X-Files is satisfying for fans, ok for newbies.",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,2307,"['early', 'nineties', 'CSIs', 'many', 'progeny', 'X-Files', 'was', 'go', 'series', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'serial', 'killers', 'partly', 'inspired', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'weirdness', 'thrown', 'course', 'was', 'only', 'third', 'stories', 'remaining', '2', 'thirds', 'were', 'conspiratorial', 'aliens', 'monster', 'hunting', 'spirit', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'series', '70', 'not', 'alienate', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'followed', 'twists', 'turns', '9', 'year', 'run', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'set-up', 'WANT', 'TO', 'BELIEVE', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'FBI', 'profiler', 'sub-genre', 'series', 'helped', 'create', 'psychic', 'just', 'top', 'off', 'So', 'fans', 'looking', 'black', 'oil', 'alien', 'bounty', 'hunters', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'next', 'X-Files', 'feature', 'film', 'Mythology', 'story', 'ties.As', 'fan', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'good', 'see', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Fox', 'Spooky', 'Mulder', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Dr.', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'duo', 'comfortably', 'fall', 'back', 'iconic', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'archetypes', 'TRUE', 'BELIEVER', 'QUINTESSENTIAL', 'SKEPTIC', 'relationship', 'clearly', 'deepened', 'pair', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'FBI', 'end', 'up', 'aiding', 'FBI', 'search', 'abducted', 'agent', 'stretching', 'hunt', 'serial', 'killer', 'turn', 'stretches', 'trailing', 'illicit', 'organ', 'harvesting', 'operation', 'help', 'defrocked', 'psychic', 'ex-pedophile', 'ex-priest', 'played', 'perfectly', 'great', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'nature', 'character', 'background', 'Catholicism', 'lead', 'suspect', 'fraud', 'accomplice', 'Mulder', 'as', 'quick', 'ever', 'find', 'answers', 'paranormal', 'People', 'parts', 'turn-up', 'Scully', 'involving', 'Mulder', 'still', 'motivated', 'guilt', 'loss', 'sister', 'driving', 'character', 'point', 'series', 'very', 'beginning', 'compulsion', 'may', 'cost', 'lot', 'more', 'end.The', 'big', 'screen', 'X-Files', 'Adventure', 'feels', 'right', 'fixings', 'good', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'even', 'climactic', 'FBI', 'cameos', 'score', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'series', 'original', 'composer', 'go', 'Probably', 'not', 'more', 'effective', 'thanX-Files', 'FIGHT', 'FUTURE', 'look', 'forward', '2012', 'follow-up', 'focus', 'Mayan', 'Doomsday', 'prophecy', 'set', '2012', 'focal', 'point', 'X-Files', 'spin-off', 'Millennium']",The X-Files TV Series

True believers would be better off re-watching their DVDs of the first three seasons and letting that be what they remember, not this which is all too likely to be the final chapter of the franchise.There's a fine line between David Duchovny's deadpan and just phoning in a role, and this is on the wrong side of that line.  Gillian Andersen gives her all to the role, which is more than the script gives back to her, since it betrays the character by making her fuzzy and emotionally overwrought.  Presumably the producers brought in Amanda Peet and Xzibit as star power for the FBI storyline, but they are criminally underutilized and play their roles at one fairly constant level.  At least Billy Connolly has more than one note: he has two, neither of which are his unique brand of funny.  What a waste of talent.And the story flows with the haste and dispatch of molasses from the fridge.  Attractive young women are being kidnapped for gruesome experiments and a pervert priest has psychic visions pointing to the victims.  What a great concept.  But rather than tell us that story, we fixate on Mulder's beard, his sex life with Scully, a medical procedure that never actually goes anywhere, and ew-icky-poo beheadings.  Then, just when we get to the climax, the whole thing lays over and goes FFFT like a punctured balloon.  BORRR-ring!Please, producers, the franchise concept was played out by 1997.

I can't get over how disappointing it was. My wife and I are big X-Files fans but couldn't see the movie in the theaters because we have three kids and don't get out much. So we had to wait until it arrived on DVD.  In this case, I'm really glad we didn't go to the theater. This wasn't worth it.  Two gay antagonists, one trying to find bodies to attach his lover's head to.  A woman's body no less!?  Mulder was flat, Scully was an utter bore.  The hospital plot was a T.V. episode, the Catholic pedophile priest (yawn yawn, another Catholic priest child molester bad guy, real original) was tiresome, the Amanda Peet character lacked depth, the plot stunk, there WAS NO X FILE until the end when we see Dr. Frankenstein attaching the aforementioned gay antagonist's head to a chick's body (Frankenstein plot, how fresh!), and cheesy dialogue.This movie lacked suspense, surprises, the usual great character chemistry, and it was drawn-out.I can't believe that some fans think this was better than Fight The Future?  At least FTF had links to the show. At least it had Cancer Man, the syndicate, the colonizer plot, and some great special effects. The plot was much better.Throw me a super soldier, throw me Doggett or Reyes, put in some aliens, for God's sake, something!

And poor ole' Skinner comes into the movie in the last twenty minutes...sigh I say again, is this the best Carter could churn out after all these years?

I also enjoyed many of the stand-alone tales, into which this movie fits. But even in the extended cut I find this film to be barely as good as even the most mediocre old episodes.One of the best things about the series was its subtlety; it gave the viewer credit for intelligence, and rarely hit us over the head with gore or violence. But not here. The occasional gruesome scenes really distracted me from the main thing on display, the rekindling of the Mulder/Scully thang.[Spoilers] So M and S do some kissing, and are shown in bed, etc. Nice for those who waited for it, but for those of us who loved the show mainly for sharp dialogue and very crafty ideas, there's little of either here. The banter is ok but not up to snuff, and who needs to see all those hacked limbs and severed heads? Just doesn't feel like what I want from the X-Folks. Which is weird, as Carter and Spotnick did all of this. Maybe they thought they needed some sensationalism to sell tickets.Oh well, it ain't bad, and it has some strengths such as good production values, etc, but all in all I had hoped for a lot more, and a lot less.However, the blu-ray does have a fine set of extras, especially a history of the show with many many clips and a long, in-depth summary of every episode. It would take you many days to read and see all of that, so if you're a serious fan, you'll love that a lot, and the making-of/keeping it secret docs, commentaries, etc. It's a good package, and the film got a good transfer.If they make another movie, I hope they resurrect the old storyline, drop the blood and guts, and get on with what made the show great: quiet intelligence.",3,"More a horror film than a good X-File, but a fine blu-ray",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1736,"['3.4', 'starsI', 'loved', 'series', 'especially', 'running', 'storyline', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'al', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'stand-alone', 'tales', 'movie', 'even', 'extended', 'cut', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'barely', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'most', 'mediocre', 'old', 'episodes.One', 'best', 'things', 'series', 'was', 'subtlety', 'gave', 'viewer', 'credit', 'intelligence', 'rarely', 'hit', 'head', 'gore', 'violence', 'not', 'here', 'occasional', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'really', 'distracted', 'main', 'thing', 'display', 'rekindling', 'Mulder/Scully', 'thang', '[', 'Spoilers', ']', 'So', 'M', 'S', 'do', 'kissing', 'are', 'shown', 'bed', 'etc', 'Nice', 'who', 'waited', 'who', 'loved', 'show', 'mainly', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'very', 'crafty', 'ideas', 'little', 'here', 'banter', 'ok', 'not', 'snuff', 'who', 'see', 'hacked', 'limbs', 'severed', 'heads', 'Just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'what', 'want', 'X-Folks', 'Which', 'weird', 'Carter', 'Spotnick', 'did', 'Maybe', 'thought', 'needed', 'sensationalism', 'sell', 'tickets.Oh', 'well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'strengths', 'such', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'etc', 'had', 'hoped', 'lot', 'more', 'lot', 'less.However', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'fine', 'set', 'extras', 'especially', 'history', 'show', 'many', 'many', 'clips', 'long', 'in-depth', 'summary', 'episode', 'would', 'take', 'many', 'days', 'read', 'see', 'so', ""'re"", 'serious', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'lot', 'making-of/keeping', 'secret', 'docs', 'commentaries', 'etc', 'good', 'package', 'film', 'got', 'good', 'transfer.If', 'make', 'movie', 'hope', 'resurrect', 'old', 'storyline', 'drop', 'blood', 'guts', 'get', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'great', 'quiet', 'intelligence']",The X-Files TV Series

And as a monster-of-the-week, the monster in question in this movie is not particularly scary.  That said, ""The X-Files"" not only had two basic formats for the show, but individual episodes also had several different dominant themes, from humor (""The Post-Modern Prometheus,"" ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space',"" ""Small Potatoes,"" ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas,"" ""Bad Blood,"" etc.) to character development and backstory (""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,"" ""Unusual Suspects,"" ""Travelers,"" ""Emily,"" ""all things,"" etc.) to explorations of Christian faith (""Miracle Man,"" ""Revelations,"" ""Beyond the Sea,"" ""All Souls,"" and the fantastic, Flannery O'Connoresque ""Signs and Wonders."")A lot of people forget about the religiously-themed episodes of the show, which is a shame because they were some of the best-written and acted of the entire series.""The X-Files:  I Want to Believe"" falls squarely into the category of the character development and religious-themed standalone episodes, which is a disappointment for those who were looking for either aliens and government conspiracies or for those who were wanting blood and guts and weird autopsies.

Mulder and Scully carried their relationship well throughout that film (even though Scully was unconscious towards the end). This film plays more like an extended TV plot, albeit with some excessively grotesque and disgusting themes and visuals. An agent goes missing so a former priest `who has a sixth sense' is brought in to help solve the matter. Why the priest had to come from a colony of sex offenders is beyond me and why one of the first clues is a severed arm was unusual, but that `type' of dark theme continues. Without giving too much away, there is far less spookiness and much more creepiness than before. Some of the numerous scenes with severed limbs for ""specific"" purposes are downright nauseating. I'll stop there with that, but by the last portion of the film, one realizes that this might not be alien-like or psychic at all, which is what the ""X-Files"" has always been about for me. Scully and Mulder do have the same good chemistry that teeters back and forth and the acting (Amanda Peet is intense and Billy Connolly as the priest is convincing) is top rate, but the cinematography is elsewhere. Instead of the grand view of `awesomeness' we are used to, the scenes seem shot for the small screen. The ending is a bit too pat and satisfying to be believable, but you DO want to believe. That's why you can be assured that there is another ""X-Files"" movie in the future.",4,"Still...I Loved the 'X-Files""!",1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,1493,"['completely', 'enjoyed', '1998', 'X-Files', 'alien', 'theme', 'cinematography', 'was', 'inspiring', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'carried', 'relationship', 'well', 'film', 'even', 'Scully', 'was', 'unconscious', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'extended', 'TV', 'plot', 'excessively', 'grotesque', 'disgusting', 'themes', 'visuals', 'agent', 'missing', 'so', 'former', 'priest', 'who', 'sixth', 'sense', 'brought', 'help', 'solve', 'matter', 'Why', 'priest', 'had', 'come', 'colony', 'sex', 'offenders', 'why', 'one', 'first', 'clues', 'severed', 'arm', 'was', 'unusual', 'type', 'dark', 'theme', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'far', 'less', 'spookiness', 'much', 'more', 'creepiness', 'before', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'severed', 'limbs', 'specific', 'purposes', 'are', 'downright', 'nauseating', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there', 'last', 'portion', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'alien-like', 'psychic', 'what', 'X-Files', 'always', 'been', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'do', 'have', 'same', 'good', 'chemistry', 'back', 'forth', 'acting', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'intense', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'priest', 'convincing', 'top', 'rate', 'cinematography', 'elsewhere', 'Instead', 'grand', 'view', 'awesomeness', 'are', 'used', 'scenes', 'seem', 'shot', 'small', 'screen', 'ending', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'satisfying', 'be', 'believable', 'DO', 'want', 'believe', 'why', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'future']",The X-Files TV Series

Maybe people were expecting aliens, i don't know, but the movie is not as nearly as bad as some make it out to be.I got into the fantastic show only 2 years ago, so maybe it's fresher in my mind about what the X-Files is all about. It's not a CGI mess, nothing like that. It's a verbal thinking movie where you have to actually watch the film instead of waiting for high tech explosions that you see in movies like 'The Dark Knight'. It's always what X-Files was, and it's the same with this movie.The story is not as bad as others make it out to be as well. Maybe not supernatural or paranormal(there was a physic however), but more of a freaky type of story. Also, it's about Mulder and Scully just as much. It's what the X-Files has become.. and it's really played out well. The acting from the two is great, anyone saying otherwise is wrong. Some complain that series favorites didn't show up. Well, this isn't a mythology(alien) movie.. and that's where you would see them. We did however get to see Skinner again, which was great.The only downer about the film is that there's moments that seem slow, and this movie definately could have benefited from another month of production. Don't blame that on Chris Carter though, as FOX is the ones that wanted the movie out a week after 'The Dark Knight'.This movie is highly underrated, and deserves more credit then people are giving it. It's about Mulder and Scully, and that's the joust of what we got. Be appreciative that they came back, because it could be the last time you see them again. I guess the only thing I can suggest is go into watching the movie not expecting much, and I think you'll be surprised.

Yes, Mulder and Scully along with a cameo from Skinner, they are all back but maybe only for this movie. I somehow don't see another X-Files movie in the near future..

I almost felt like I was sitting in my living room watching another season finale. But for a movie in theater it lacked a little. I think we all expected big bangs and special effects, like in the first movie. This one felt low budget.There are 3 plots going on, Scully and Mulder's relationship, Scully trying to save a little boy, and Mulder helping the FBI to locate a missing agent kidnapped by a modern day Frankenstein. I was glad to see Skinner, I liked his part. I was disappointed to hear Amanda Peat was cast because I can't stand her, but I was pleasantly surprised, in this I actually really liked her! I think she was my favorite character. The role suited her well. She seemed to have the hots for Mulder. I am so disappointed with the direction they took her character toward the end.I didn't like Scully's character all the time, the fact that she pushed Mulder into helping the FBI and then when he did, she told him he better stop or she'll leave him.???? I really didn't like the pedophile character. They make me nauseous. Plus the pedophile was kind of one of the good guys.???? Never in my book!I think this episode was important because we see that they are no longer fugitives, and they are in a solid relationship. Now that we have all that out of the way, in the next movie I would like to see something about their son. Overall I think the movie should have had a better plot and way better special effects. Also the tension needed to be cut with a little humor. It was pretty on the edge of your seat stuff but lacked the X-Files humor I like so much.

But, we have been given a lot more! Chris Carter has given us a thriller and a pretty good one at that.The film follows FBI agents in their search for a missing agent. They are aided by a man, a priest of questionable morals, who has visions. They bring in Mulder and Scully, now a surgeon (since when?!) to help them in their investigation. If Mulder helps, all will be forgiven (a bit of a stretch since he was charged by the military for murder after all). Regardless, our favorite couple discovers a sinister plan that will make you cringe.Amanda Peet is the FBI Agent that brings Mulder in. Her character could have been better used. Skinner makes an appearance!The movie was sinister, evil, spooky and just plain wrong. It was great! To top is all off: Mulder and Scully. There is nothing bad we can say about their acting and their portrayals...they own these characters, they created them, and made them the memorable characters we like. The direction was excellent, with amazing long shots and beautiful photography. The great musical score was done by Mark Snow, who else would have been better for this?!For the X-philes (fans): oh, this will be fun, sunflower seeds, ""I want to believe"" poster, pencils in the ceiling and a whole lotta Mulder and Scully talk. Priceless. Did you see Chris Carter in the scene at the hospital, sitting down?For the X-shippers, you will be happy. Mulder and Scully, what has happened will be answered and then some.For the non-fan: it was very easy to understand, there is not that much mythology, just some references here and there that are not necessary for the understanding of the plot.The movie is very good, and spooky, it talks about morality, about persistence and about beliefs. The movie once again, as the entire series of the X-Files did, challenges both Mulder and Scully in their beliefs along the way of solving yet another sinister crime. There are tons of plot holes and far fetched things though. Yes, there have been better episodes. But still, a great addition to The X-Files.Now for the big question: to buy or not to buy?

Despite many of the negative reviews that it received, The X-Files: I Want to Believe is a worthwhile endeavor for fans of the show, and while not perfect by any means, still manages to satisfy.  The film picks up with Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) apart and out of the FBI, until both are drawn back in with a case involving a former priest (Billy Connolly) who claims to have visions when an Agent goes missing under mysterious circumstances.  There's no conspiracy abound, just a plot involving some horrific science gone wrong and belief, and the film is all the better for it.  The usual cast of X-Files alums aren't present sadly, but Mitch Pileggi does return briefly as FBI director Skinner, and Amanda Peet and rapper Xzibit are on board as the FBI Agents that being Mulder and Scully into the fold.

So much so I was left wondering why this wasn't released as a TV movie and not a theatrical feature.Overall, the performances were fine, but the plot would have worked better had they taken it further. As is, it belonged strictly in the filler episode category.

Dr. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) no longer employed by the FBI is working on the case of a boy who has in incurable, untreatable disease. An agent from the FBI shows up at the hospital and tells Scully that he is looking for Fox Mulder. The agent tells Dana that the current warrants out for Fox and all past indiscretions will be forgotten if Fox is willing to help the FBI on a case. Apparently, a psychic has been helpful in finding body parts relevant to the case of a missing FBI agent.

As far as the quality overall, everything is what you'd would expect from the acting down to the cinematography which is to say that if the previous movies and show were to your liking than this will be too with the inverse also being true.The Bad: I felt like the story could have been a little stronger and the on screen chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson seems to have faded just the slightest bit.Overall: The movie was enjoyable.

Mular,"[84, 104]","***October 6, 2013 Update***The Hollywood Reporter confirms that 'Illuminate Hollywood' has been creating new 4k HD Masters of the X-Files TV series. The original unedited camera negatives are being scanned in HD and will be re-edited back into complete shows.  Special effects will have to re-created with CGI in HD.  Cutting continuities and SD Videos of the original shows will be used as reference for editing.  The bad news is that this is the new name for the company that botched the Star Trek TNG season 2 Blu-ray with DNR & other errors. CBS cancelled their contract with them after that.----Original review----If the original 35mm camera film elements exist there is some hope, but like ST-TNG every episode would have to be re-edited and the special effects re-created using the original 35mm films.The first 4 seasons of the X - Files were not produced in Hi-Definition, the original camera negatives were transfered to standard definition video and the video was edited into the final shows.  Unlike classic filmed TV shows of the 1950's, 60's & 70's where in those days the final editing was done on 35mm negatives, so a Hi-Definition transfer can be made of those old shows. From mid 1980 to 1998, the camera films were directly transfered to standard definition video for editing, no edited 35mm film master exists to make a new hi-Definition transfer.Starting with season 5 (1997) the X-Files was produced in wide screen, but even that does not mean it was in hi-Definition as it pre-dates U.S. Hi-Definition broadcasts & standards. Hi-Definition broadcasts didn't start until October 1998, and then it was not for regular TV series. The FOX network did not start Hi-Definition broadcasts until September 2004, WAY after the X-Files was out of production.The bottom line is that unless FOX would do a major computer enhancement to scrub out the grain of the original TV series, a Blu-ray release of the X-Files TV series would not be an improvement. And based on FOX's Blu-ray releases of their 1970's feature films, they are not investing the money.If a TV show was produced between 1980 & 1998, don't hope for a good Blu-ray release. The Classic Star Trek will always look sharper that its sequels (except for Enterprise).Now the two X-Files theatrical movies were edited in Hi-Definition with a 35mm master negative produced.

I have been waiting for this second feature film with as much anticipation as the next.  It saddens me that it seems as if 20th Century Fox had very little faith in the project seeing as how its marketing campaign was non-existant.""I Want to Believe"" is most definitely a stand alone story.  It is incredibly somber and visually stark.  The twist the plot takes towards the climax is truly disturbing.As you've already read, there is no talk of black sludge or aliens or conspiracy or anything of that nature.  If anything, this movie is a very serious character examination.  We find Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the most realistic of circumstances after all this time has passed.  Certain questions are answered through brief references or even just a glance.  We find our heroes thrown into the mix again after having been out of the fray for so much time and we are able to re-visit what we grew to love about these two so many years ago.The plot does not need to be spoken of as it is so much more fun to experience as it unfolds.  Mark Snow once again does an eerily good job composing the score.  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson jump back into the ring with a great willingness and spirit, but it must be said that while ""Fight the Future"" may have seemed to be Duchovny's to carry, ""I Want to Believe"" is very much Gillian Anderson's cross to bear and she does so with grace and grit and the cynical charm that we love so much.  Her performance is absolutely perfect.Amanda Peet turns in some fine work as a fellow Agent on the case.  If I had one complaint about the film is that they should have used Peet a little more than they did.  But to be fair, she does have one of the most breathlessly suspenseful sequences in the film to carry with her.Billy Connelly and XHibit are equally as good as a former pedophile and FBI Agent respectively.What else can I say?

Mention how Skinner didn't get in trouble, how Scully was able to get that job at the hospitall. To much happened in the last few seasons for them not to mention any of it at all. This movie would have been a great follow up to a movie that DID explain all of the above. As far as the movie itself goes, I thought it was a good movie.

How wonderful it was going to be to see Mulder and Scully triumphantly united on film once more!  Sadly-utter shock and disappointment was my only reaction having seen the final product.  The only thing I could think of was ""They brought back Mulder and Scully for this?""Honestly.  What was the point of this film?  To call this movie a boring version of CSI is being too kind.  To call it a dud episode of X-Files, stretched thin into feature length, is to heap undeserved praise upon it.  Make no mistake, this movie is ""X-Files"" in name only.  There is no trace of the X-Files ""spirit"" anywhere to be found among the tedious and downright coma inducing story line.  Gone are the charismatic characters you loved from the series and in their place you'll find robotic actors delivering their lines as if they were dragged kicking and screaming back into these roles.  You could've substituted any characters into the roles here, Mulder and Scully need not apply.  It honestly wouldn't have made a difference.  I'm not trying to be a film snob here, but I just can't help shaking my head trying to fathom why this movie needed to be created.  Why on earth bring back two of television's most iconic characters then do nothing with them that makes them who they are?I own all of the X-files box sets as well as the first movie on DVD.  However, I cannot imagine purchasing this movie, nor do I have any desire to put myself through the agonizing boredom of watching it again just because I'm a fan.

Another X-files movie being green lit was an opportunity to introduce the XF to another generation of fans.

And why is Scully the skeptic again.  This issue was dealt with already in the series.  Scully convinces Mulder to assist the FBI with the case, then spends the second half of the film convincing him to drop said case.  Skinner's appearance was a complete waste as it took place at the end of the film.  Then, to add insult to injury, the last glimpse we have of these characters is them waving from a boat.  What about the date given them in the series of the impending alien invasion in 2012?  No mention of that.  This was just a poorly conceived and lazily made film.

The Amazon site review gives almost the entire movie story-plot away since there wasn't much else to really concern yourself about with this movie.  It was also sad to see how the reunion between once great co-stars was in this movie,  the connection that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson once had is definitely not seen in this movie at all.  Gillian is still the great actress I remember and she still plays her role as Scully as great as she did in the 90's, sadly the same can't really be said about David in his role of Mulder it just seemed he hammed up more than before.  So sadly it looks like for fans looking for an X-files comeback are in for a shocker if anything with this movie it just seems to show that the X-files franchise is long gone from now on.

The second thing one might need to know is that ""I Want to Know"" is not much of a movie. If you are looking for a reunion of characters, forget it. We don't even see ""Skinner""/Mitch Pillegi until the near the end of the movie. And as for the Lone Gunmen and Cigarette Man, well they got killed off in the season. Agent Dogget and that female FBI detective that was brought in near the end of the X-Files is also an no show.The movie deals with a pedophile priest who lives with other pedophile priests in a college dorm like setting. They are to minister to each other to fight their temptations. The priest in this movie has ridiculously long hair. He looks like a real idiot. That priest is also seeing visions of kidnapped girls and so on. So Mulder and Skully use the priest to help them find a killer. And all through this movie I kept waiting for David Duchovny to look like Mulder, but all I kept noticing was how much he had aged since I had last seen him. Mulder is living with Skully. Mulder's beard also looked completely fake and glued on. As for the plot, some Russians or something are experimenting, creating two headed dogs and two headed people. All in all it never feels like an X-File, but more like an EX-File. And who thought bringing that black guy in from ""Pimp My Ride"" as an FBI Detective was a good idea? So we get mr. Pimp My Ride detective and Amanda Peet, and the latter gets killed off in the movie. This just isn't a good movie. Sure, it was great to see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson back together, but this movie simply doesn't work on so many levels. There is no spark, no magic, there is no chemistry or camaraderie among the characters/actors. What we have are actors going through the motions in a script that never feels at all like an X-File.

Only makes sense considering we've been waiting on the second movie for so long and we get a movie that doesn't cover the alien/government conspiracy and features only three of the original characters.However if you can get past all that then you should enjoy this movie. Most people saw this movie with higher expectations. I waited for the DVD and read plenty of reviews so I knew what not to expect.Yes I miss the episodes where Mulder and Scully are the FBI agents. But that disappeared late in the television series, so you can't really fault this movie for the change in atmosphere.This movie's storyline sort of feels like a trip back earlier in the series. The story was dark and creepy involving human experimentation from a modern-day Frankenstein. A fine story that would fit in really well in the earlier episodes of the series however it felt like we only got a few minutes of the good stuff and I feel like they should have gone deeper. Still deserves better than alot of the reviews it gets.Hopefully we get another movie. Not a sequel to this one but one for the fans of the alien/government conspiracy. It's a shame though...

1171555,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001BCO8XQ,RMurray847,"[5, 6]","Seeing THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE made me understand something that I find a little bit interesting.  When we've gotten to know characters really well (for example, over the several year life of a TV series), we don't want to see them change and grow.  We've come to like the characters JUST LIKE THEY ARE.  (I'll give you a crazy example:  if you've ever seen NIP/TUCK, you know that those two main characters have gone through absolutely the most outrageous things over the last few years.  Events that would have emotionally destroyed most people.  Yet we revel in Christian and Sean staying basically the same through all their diversity.  We want to see THOSE TWO PEOPLE going through these things...not really ""evolving"" people.)Certainly two of the greatest characters in TV history were Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.  We loved their chemistry.  We loved their personalities.  As the series began to wind down, and Mulder became less of a presence...we lost that chemistry, and try as he might, Robert Patrick coming in as Agent Doggett could not replace the indefinable something that David Duchovny brought to his role AND brought out of Gillian Anderson in HER role.  Chemistry.  But I think more than that, the character of Scully began to change in significant ways...for example, she no longer filled the role of ""the skeptic and unbeliever.""  She had become the ""believer.""  It made rational sense that this was so...but it was unsatisfying for fans.Now, a half-dozen years later, we get to revisit Mulder and Scully, anxious for a nice fun return to their ""old"" ways.  Witty banter, snappy dialogue, unacknowledged sexual tension.  What Chris Carter (creator of the show and writer of the movie) has done is allowed Mulder and Scully to evolve as they would in something like the ""real"" world.  This means that all the horrible, stressful events that these two have endured over the years have really taken their toll.  Scully has returned to medicine, working as a pediatric surgeon.  She carries a burden of sadness with her constantly...if you remember some of the sacrifices she had to make in the series, you know why.  Mulder, living now with Scully, has become something of a recluse in their modest but solitary country home.  There's a brief mention of him ""writing a book,"" but it mostly looks like he's still obsessively scouring the internet for ""the truth"" that's ""out there.""  The two are now openly a couple...no more unrequited love.  They are a loving couple who still have a deep sadness.  It makes total psychological sense.  It also makes for a less than exciting movie.The basic plot revolves around a missing FBI agent, who may have been abducted and a fallen priest (Billy Connelly) who claims to have psychic abilities and also to have information on the whereabouts of the missing agent.  Naturally, there are a lot of skeptics, and the movie takes a lot of time with the mystery of whether he really has ""powers"" or whether he's actually part of the crime.  Scully, who you'll remember was a pretty devout Catholic (at least, for a TV character), is almost viscerally repelled by this man who betrayed the church in some very horrific ways.  Yet she's also drawn to him because he seems to have some insight into her psyche.  Mulder, of course, wants to follow the clues this priest leads them to...even as he begins to wonder at their source.  Serving in the roles of ""unbelievers"" are Amanda Peet and Xibit (yep, the rapper) as active FBI agents.  Eventually, the truth behind the initial crime is learned, and it's certainly a bit sordid and over-the-top...but no more so than any episode of THE X-FILES.And there's the other problem...the movie fails to raise the stakes from the TV show.  It's not much more than an extended episode.  Carter and company have made the mistake, I believe, of thinking that the plot and themes they were presenting were either new and/or interesting.  The film builds moderate suspense, and there are some good scenes near the end.  But it is not very exciting.  Simple as that.So far, everything sounds terrible, doesn't it.  In reality, as a long-time fan of the series, I actually still kind of liked it.  I personally enjoyed visiting the ""evolved"" Mulder and Scully.  I believed their progression, and Duchovny and especially Anderson were very good.  Most of the film, of course, is set in a cold climate, so there's lots of snow.  The whole film feels cold, sad and still.  This is not exactly a PLEASANT experience, but it is very well done and very effective.  The film offers a very nice cameo appearance near the end.  There are a few bursts of the old wry humor, which are very welcome.If you are not a fan, I have no idea what you might think of the film.  You'd be able to follow it with little trouble, I suspect...but you'd likely be fairly bored as well.  For fans like me, it all depends on your hunger to see Mulder and Scully back in action.  If you don't mind older, wiser, sadder versions of your old favorite, then you should be okay.The movie has been a flop.  This almost certainly means that the franchise will never be revisited.  This makes me sad (sadder than the movie did).  For a brief, tiny glimpse of hope...stay through the closing credits of the film.  You'll get about 6 seconds of extra footage that you'll still find worthwhile.",3,It's got problems...but it also has a quiet beauty if you're willing to look.,1218758400,"08 15,

Great film transfer, menus look awesome, another digital copy to use as a cat toy...uh, anyway- My thinking is this..without direct spoilers: the crime story had nearly no arc- FBI agent disappears, who is it?  Who knows, who cares!  Not a member of the X-Files team, which would at least get your attention, and the fact that it's a character with no background or motives should tell you where this film is going... there's NO surprises, betrayals, or flip-flops regarding what was going on, typical to an episode of the X-Files.You see something awful happening, you think maybe there's conspiracies going on in the background or it isn't what it looks like.. nope. It's scary yet oddly motiveless bad guys muttering in russian without subtitles. Father Joe is a great character, and completely overshadowed the boring bad guys (and once or twice, everybody in the film).  West Virgina was made to look like Siberia for some reason.. they should've set the action in Colorado.  Glacial winters aren't a trademark of the Virginias.  Too much snow in the visuals, not enough Snow in the soundtrack.  Mark Snow.  Some of the background music, particularly in Father Joe's trance scenes was just Off.  Wrong mood, wrong speed.  Too quick/techno spooky.Scully and Mulders musings about life would've made a great coda to the series without the rest of this movie.  And as usual, Gillian Anderson steals the fire in most of their scenes.. and she's aged better.Love the show and loved Fight the Future, but Chris Carter shouldn't direct.

1171560,A422TIGQH6GJ5,B001BCO8XQ,Rob,"[0, 0]","I honestly decided to watch this film (several years after it's initial release) simply because I had the chance to listen to Mark Snow's music from the film and truly enjoyed it.  Shame that the same can't be said for the film.  The two positives: Snow's beautiful and haunting orchestral music, and the chilly realism of the winter settings (the frosty steam of breath, the crunch of snow, the frigid FBI agents poking their way across the lake, etc.)  Visuals and music were brilliant.But the story?  It seemed like half catholic-bashing, and half-ridiculous-organ-snatching silliness with a tremendously anti-climatic ending.  And the Mulder/Scully interaction just seemed so stale.  After all this time, they just sort of semi-live together, they still don't agree on the supernatural phenomena, and Scully seems disinterested in this case throughout most of the film.  This was the best they could come up with?I'm no Roman Catholic, but it really bothers me when all Hollywood is capable of portraying is Catholics as either molesters or insensitive prudes that don't approve of using cutting-edge stem cell research, as seen in the film.  Scully's skepticism gets tiring after awhile, although her bitterness in questioning God did seem to reflect a shade of C.S. Lewis from 'Mere Christianity', as one who was ""angry at God for not existing.""  But her interest in the sick child seemed to preoccupy her character throughout the film, leaving her as little more than just a distracting side-character as everyone else is after the body organ snatchers.And Scully doing her research with Google?  Seriously?  I'm no medical doctor, but don't they have tomes of medical resources online that they'd go to first before just googling?  And Skinner (his role in the film just seemed unnecessary) making the remark about ""googling"" and address made me think that the search engine was included in the film not as much for it's usefulness, but instead just as a commercialism vehicle ala Zod and the Coke sign...This was a dud.

1171562,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001BCO8XQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","[...]Since last we saw them together, former FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully seem to have moved on with their lives - or, at least, one of them has.  For while Scully is now working as a topnotch neurosurgeon at a Catholic hospital, Mulder, still a wanted-man by the FBI, is living a hermit-like existence in a remote shack in West Virginia.  However, both are pulled back into service when an FBI agent goes missing under suspicious circumstances and it is discovered that a pedophile priest with possible psychic powers may hold the key to her whereabouts.There's no question that it's nice to see Scully and Mulder working as a crime-fighting duo again after all this time, but ""The X Files: I Want to Believe"" turns out to be a pretty shaky vehicle for this long overdue reunion.  Written by Frank Spotnitz and series creator Chris Carter (who also directed the film), this is little more than a serviceable installment in a series that, during the 1990's, held millions of viewers in thrall to its unique combination of paranormal crime-busting and conspiracy-theory paranoia.  Unfortunately, this second movie spin-off (the first was released in 1998) emerges as a fairly mundane psychic thriller that borrows many of its elements from ""Frankenstein"" and the ""Saw"" franchise.  What's missing from the movie is that strange ability the original series had of throwing us back on our heals and really making us see the world in a new and sometimes very frightening way.  Moreover, the movie, for some reason, feels the need to paint Catholics, Russians and homosexuals in as unflattering a light as possible.The passage of time hasn't eroded either the charm or the physical attractiveness of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the roles that made them famous, and the actors alone make the movie worth seeing for diehard fans of the show.  But given all the time the writers had to dream up a knockout scenario for the stars` return, this latest (and probably last) endeavor together is sure to disappoint.",2,lack the imaginative power of the series,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,2021,"['[', ']', 'last', 'saw', 'together', 'former', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'seem', 'have', 'moved', 'lives', 'least', 'one', 'Scully', 'now', 'working', 'topnotch', 'neurosurgeon', 'Catholic', 'hospital', 'Mulder', 'still', 'wanted-man', 'FBI', 'living', 'hermit-like', 'existence', 'remote', 'shack', 'West', 'Virginia', 'However', 'are', 'pulled', 'back', 'service', 'when', 'FBI', 'agent', 'missing', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'discovered', 'pedophile', 'priest', 'possible', 'psychic', 'powers', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'question', 'nice', 'see', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'working', 'crime-fighting', 'duo', 'again', 'time', 'X', 'Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'shaky', 'vehicle', 'long', 'overdue', 'reunion', 'Written', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'series', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'serviceable', 'installment', 'series', '1990', 'held', 'millions', 'viewers', 'thrall', 'unique', 'combination', 'paranormal', 'crime-busting', 'conspiracy-theory', 'paranoia', 'Unfortunately', 'second', 'movie', 'spin-off', 'first', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'fairly', 'mundane', 'psychic', 'thriller', 'many', 'elements', 'Frankenstein', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'What', 'missing', 'movie', 'strange', 'ability', 'original', 'series', 'had', 'throwing', 'back', 'heals', 'really', 'making', 'see', 'world', 'new', 'sometimes', 'very', 'frightening', 'way', 'Moreover', 'movie', 'reason', 'need', 'paint', 'Catholics', 'Russians', 'homosexuals', 'unflattering', 'light', 'possible.The', 'passage', 'time', ""n't"", 'eroded', 'either', 'charm', 'physical', 'attractiveness', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'roles', 'made', 'famous', 'actors', 'alone', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing', 'diehard', 'fans', 'show', 'given', 'time', 'writers', 'had', 'dream', 'up', 'knockout', 'scenario', 'stars', 'return', 'latest', 'probably', 'last', 'endeavor', 'together', 'sure', 'disappoint']",The X-Files TV Series
1171563,A1FYS18SEUA0A7,B001BCO8XQ,Rusty Shackleford,"[0, 2]","The good news is that the government conspiracy that got so silly the last two season is gone, as is Doggett and super soldiers. The conspiracy got so mangled and convoluted that it hurt the series. In fact, if the X-files had ended with the beautiful and cathartic ""Closure"" in season 7(the last good thing Carter wrote), this movie might have been amazing. Only 3 episodes that season after closure aired were any good, and maybe 3 more the next two seasons were worth anything.If only Mulder hadn't ""died"" which killed the series forever... That episode should have been titled Jump the Shark, but not the shameful episode that did have that name the next season.The bad news is Chris Carter(along with the equally uneven Frank Spotnitz) wrote this. His writing output for season 8 and 9 as well as Millennium season 3 was for the most part substandard and this movie continues that tradition. Yes, he created a great series, but unlike a Matt Groening, Chris Carter doesn't know when to butt out and let real writers have at it. I think of Chris Carter somewhat like a Robert Jordan, both created a very interesting premise, and both somehow did everything they could to ruin it.Another amazing fact to note, neither Mulder nor Scully made an appearance in the third biggest role of the series: the hospital bed. Granted, it made a cameo, but it was not the same without Mulder or Scully laying in it. Seriously, the hospital bed with one of the two major characters in it, made more appearances than the cancer man, skinner, or krycek combined.What was the purpose of the side story with the sick boy? Is Scully working for the aliens by propping up the number of slaves? It would seem the humane thing to do would be to let him die.It is not that this is a terrible movie, it is that it is a below average episode. While I was watching this, I couldn't help but start wishing that Darin Morgan had written the movie instead. After all, the best, most creative, most interesting, most engaging, and most applauded episodes were written by Mr. Morgan, not Chris Carter. In fact the only marginal episode Morgan wrote was the Jose Chung episode for Millennium(it wasn't bad, it just didn't fit into the much darker Millennium series).

We have a room full of Russian medical personnel, operating in the USA, who apparently can't understand a lick of English.

Unlike the first film, ""I Want to Believe"" is a small film with big ideas, much like the episodes from the classic television series. Mulder and Scully investigate a man who claims to have visions sent from God, and can see the victims of apparent kidnappings. This main story is fascinating, and one that will keep fans interested.Sadly, the film's weakness comes from a sub-plot with Scully, who now works as a doctor for a Catholic hospital. This story, where we see Scully using controversial means to help a child who is dying, is an unneeded element. Not because of the controversy, but because it slows the film down quite a bit. Other than this, the storytelling is good.The cast does a terrific job. Dana Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are still terrific as Mulder and Scully, and to see their relationship grow even closer in this film gives it it's soul. Billy Connolly is great as Father Joe, the man who has the ""gift"" of the psychic connection with the victims.

1171581,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B001BCO8XQ,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[14, 18]","sadly, this is just a good, expanded episode of the incredibly creepy, well-cast, original TV-Series.Loyal fans will eat it up, but I think more objective ones will be asking, ""Is this it after all these years?""  I couldn't wait for this film to come out as I greatly miss the series and thought a series of films would do this old show some justice, but this film is rather clunky, slow, and laborious at times.  Series creator, writer and director Chris Carter just seems to have lost something and maybe that's what the ""X"" in X-Files now stands for, the missing ingredient.I won't reveal much of the plot here other than what most are already aware of and that is that an FBI agent is missing, a possible psychic may lead them to her, and Mulder is asked to help and if he does so, then all will be forgiven.  Personally, I have a problem already with the script as I NEVER saw where it was really needed to bring in Mulder at all.  There is NOTHING with this case that ONLY Mulder could help with, but, I guess, it serves the purpose to bring him out of self-imposed ""retirement"" after his trumped up charges by the FBI at the series end.Okay, with that little having been said, here are my hits and misses:The HITS:1) It's admittedly great to see Mulder and Scully back together again and they've lost little of their chemistry in the down time.2) The acting is first-rate by Duchovny and Anderson and it's hard to reconnect with a character one hasn't played in about 6 years.3) The dialogue between Mulder and Scully is dead on and the dialogue between Mulder and everyone else is hysterical much of the time.  Duchovny's deadpan delivery combined with Mulder's anger and sarcasm is gut-bustingly funny.4) The story is typical X-Files stuff.5) There is a nice examination into people's motives, what we fear, what we love, and so forth.  It comes off as honest and not preachy.The MISSES:1) The film is VERY slow moving.2) It feels like nothing more than an expanded episode of the series, the major problem with most TV-Series to film adaptation.  It seriously lacks the punch of the last X-Files film which was excellent.3) I mentioned this earlier, but it bares repeating here: The reasons given and the case itself don't really appropriately support the summoning back of Mulder.  I, we the audience, deserve something grander here.  Maybe if a series of FBI agents were kidnapped or all disappeared at once, but the lone agent disappearance and the use of a psychic just don't seem enough to me to explain Mulder's presence.Overall, the film was okay, even good, but it was a disappointment.  I can only hope that this was the first of a series of X-Files films to come and they simply created an excuse to bring back Mulder and Scully.  Maybe now, after re-connecting at the bureau and solving the case, they will be called upon more often in some manner.  I'm game for that!",3,"I wanted to believe that this film would be better, but . . .",1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,2889,"['sadly', 'just', 'good', 'expanded', 'episode', 'incredibly', 'creepy', 'well-cast', 'original', 'TV-Series.Loyal', 'fans', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'think', 'more', 'objective', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'asking', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'greatly', 'miss', 'series', 'thought', 'series', 'films', 'would', 'do', 'old', 'show', 'justice', 'film', 'rather', 'clunky', 'slow', 'laborious', 'times', 'Series', 'creator', 'writer', 'director', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'just', 'have', 'lost', 'something', 'maybe', 'what', 'X', 'X-Files', 'now', 'missing', 'ingredient.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'plot', 'here', 'other', 'what', 'most', 'are', 'already', 'aware', 'FBI', 'agent', 'missing', 'possible', 'psychic', 'may', 'lead', 'Mulder', 'asked', 'help', 'so', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Personally', 'have', 'problem', 'already', 'script', 'NEVER', 'saw', 'where', 'was', 'really', 'needed', 'bring', 'Mulder', 'NOTHING', 'case', 'ONLY', 'Mulder', 'could', 'help', 'guess', 'purpose', 'bring', 'self-imposed', 'retirement', 'trumped', 'up', 'charges', 'FBI', 'series', 'end.Okay', 'little', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'are', 'hits', 'misses', 'HITS:1', 'admittedly', 'great', 'see', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'back', 'together', 'again', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'little', 'chemistry', 'down', 'time.2', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'Duchovny', 'Anderson', 'hard', 'reconnect', 'character', 'one', ""n't"", 'played', 'about', '6', 'years.3', 'dialogue', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'dead', 'dialogue', 'Mulder', 'everyone', 'else', 'hysterical', 'much', 'time', 'Duchovny', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'combined', 'Mulder', 'anger', 'sarcasm', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny.4', 'story', 'typical', 'X-Files', 'stuff.5', 'nice', 'examination', 'people', 'motives', 'what', 'fear', 'what', 'love', 'so', 'forth', 'off', 'honest', 'not', 'preachy.The', 'MISSES:1', 'film', 'VERY', 'slow', 'moving.2', 'nothing', 'more', 'expanded', 'episode', 'series', 'major', 'problem', 'most', 'TV-Series', 'film', 'adaptation', 'seriously', 'punch', 'last', 'X-Files', 'film', 'was', 'excellent.3', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'repeating', 'here', 'reasons', 'given', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'appropriately', 'support', 'summoning', 'back', 'Mulder', 'audience', 'deserve', 'something', 'grander', 'here', 'Maybe', 'series', 'FBI', 'agents', 'were', 'kidnapped', 'disappeared', 'once', 'lone', 'agent', 'disappearance', 'use', 'psychic', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enough', 'explain', 'Mulder', 'presence.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'okay', 'even', 'good', 'was', 'disappointment', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'X-Files', 'films', 'come', 'simply', 'created', 'excuse', 'bring', 'back', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Maybe', 'now', 're-connecting', 'bureau', 'solving', 'case', 'will', 'be', 'called', 'more', 'often', 'manner', ""'m"", 'game']",The X-Files TV Series

While everyone else was going out eating and having fun, I was home watching my X-files. I had found a companion. It was pure bliss. In the beginning, not many people watched so there were not that many commercials to  interrupt the stories. But that all changed of course. Not only did the commercials get doubled and tripled, but then they moved it to Sunday and then later Monday night. Might not seem like much to non-X-filers, but the stories just worked on Friday and didn't on Sunday/Monday. Both of those days are the beginning of the week, usually major pressure days. To really enjoy the X-files, you need to have a clear head and want to forget the past weeks worries. (Or try to make sense of them) :)I came to Amazon to buy the DVD collection because my Laserdisk player is on it's last leg. (Yes, I have at least the first 3 seasons on LD.) But when I read the reviews on the DVD collection... and then saw the possibility of a blu-ray version, I hit the pause button. I think I'll wait till the BR comes out. Fewer disks and hopefully better packaging.So do your fans justice Fox/Chris Carter.

When I watch them again I feel like you could go back at any time and freeze frame and any scene with Gillian could be made into an iconic poster. I think her acting was poetic and David, with a Masters in English, was also poetic. The whole show and all the actors were incredibly good. That said, I could not believe (I want to Believe.); I could not believe how bad this movie was. Every plot twist and every character was a cliche. The couple of scenes where our two stars were pretending intimacy were cringe worthy. They are more like a brother and sister than lovers. They are middle age now. A better plot would have been that they were dropping their kids off at college and found a murder or mystery, not this ""Saw"" rip off.

1171589,A3NQSMTG612AF,B001BCO8XQ,TheTruthHurts,"[1, 1]","At the risk of appearing to be a ""fanboy,"" I've been an ""X-Phile"" since the show arrived in 1993; I watched religously all the way up until season six, when it all started to fall apart (though it remained better than 95% of television's competing shows at the time), then caught an episode here and there until ""The Truth"" (which, unfortunately, didn't justify the prior three seasons' mythology).  However, I have purchased each DVD set (including 6-9) since their birth, anxiously awaiting the next until my collection was complete (including the two films).  Therefore, I consider myself somewhat of an authority on the subject, and feel that I can offer valid criticism/praise regarding this latest picture.First and foremost, those expecting an action-heavy affair circa the first picture will be disappointed; ""IWTB"" is dialog-driven, which, in my opinion, was the right move to make.  Given the situation of these characters (Mulder having been on the run from the FBI for the prior six years and Scully having returned to her career of study), there would be little reason (especially given their age) for them to have to have had to be in such shape to run (and run more), e.g., as in the first picture, and frankly, as a true ""X-Phile,"" I was more interested in character development than another ""mythology"" (""Fight the Future"") or typical ""monster-of-the-week"" episode.  With ""I Want to Believe,"" we have a picture that avoids both pitfalls, keeping the background story  strictly in the background (it's a simple ""human dismemberment for malevolent means"" with ""psychic vagabond"" thrown in for good measure case...but who cares).  The main focus of the film is, quite simply, the state of Mulder and Scully's lives after so much time has passed, and I couldn't have been happier that this was the choice Carter and Spotnitz made.Fans have lashed out, stating that this isn't even an ""X-File,"" but I challenge them to point out the direction that this team should have taken...all things considered, I believe that this was the correct path.  Furthermore, psychic powers, religion, and dismemberment are nothing new to the series; simply because alien life isn't involved doesn't make this latest episode a non-""X-File,"" and, if nothing else, it's an entertaining take on dismemberment, and furthermore, stem cell research.  Carter and Spotnitz are apparently advocating the practice of the highly debated (notably in religion) latter topic; I say all power to them, and kudos for having the courage to do so.Much talk had been made regarding Duchovny's attitude from season six and beyond (disinterest in the series and excessive ego, primarily); fortunately, he seems to have realized that his fantasy of being the world's most valued (and expensive) actor is not one he's going to achieve, and seems to have found his way naturally back into the role of Fox Mulder.  Frankly, he's every bit as good as he was in the show's first few seasons, and truth be told, I feel that this series needs him, now more than ever.  Gillian Anderson is excellent, as always; the development of her character is also highly appropriate, having left the FBI behind, apparently with Mulder also mostly in her rearview mirror.  I found it quite pleasing, however, that the two have finally (finally) become intimate (beyond a simple cuddle circa ""The Truth""), and that the film ends with the apparent realization that the two truly do feel that they belong with one another, despite the potential consequences of doing so.Another underrated aspect of this film is the great music of Mark Snow; not only are his compositions heartfelt and sincere, but original to boot.  I really enjoyed the ""behind the scenes"" bit that reflected on his place in the production, and by all accounts, he is the lone reason for what might be the single-most recognizable phrase (musical bit) of the 1990s.  Cheers to him, and I aim to hear more of his work in the third film!If I had to name a weakness of the film, it might simply be that I felt Xzibit's performace was somewhat emotionless, at least in my perception.  Perhaps it was his small number of lines, or his outgoing personality on ""Pimp My Ride,"" but I didn't feel that he was the right fit for the part, nor that he was much more than a simple device designed to draw a younger audience to the picture.  I'm not stating that he doesn't have potential as an actor, but he seemed out of place in this context.  That said, Peet did a fine job of portraying her character (one of the more restrained and genuine of hers that I've seen), as did Billy Connolly, who completely owned his role.  Skinner's appearance, while for little more than show, was very nice to see and definitely welcomed (though he could have been given a few more lines (more than a cameo)).All things considered, I feel that this is a good film, and certainly one worthy of the ""X-File"" brand; if you disagree, and feel that they ""could have done so much more,"" I challenge you to propose what they ""should have done""...I believe that if you consider the options Carter and Spotnitz had, there were two potential roads to take; a typical ""X-File,"" perhaps more focused on the weekly monster than the characters, or the one that was taken; a dialog-focused exercise that expands not only on the lives of these characters, but resolves the question that has been looming for sixteen years: ""when will these two finally become a pair?""  In any event, this film may not satisfy viewers unfamiliar with the series and characters, but this film was clearly made for us, the diehards, and we, in turn, should offer our appreciation for it.Word has it that not only is there a ""Millenium"" film in the works, but (as alluded to before) potentially a third ""X-Files"" film revolving around the events foretold by CSM regarding 2012.  With the poor box-office numbers of this film, I'd look forward to even a made-for-TV (or home video) presentation somewhere down the road, if not on the big screen.  Let's hope that the Fox brass aren't simply interested in this series for the potential aqcuisition of the almighty dollar, but moreso for the creation of more excellent sci-fi (really, the best available) of the ""The X-Files"" brand!",4,"A solid, underrated addition to the X-Files catalog...",1228608000,"12 7, 2008",2008,6233,"['risk', 'appearing', 'be', 'fanboy', ""'ve"", 'been',

1171590,A2QBYQHTCO88CU,B001BCO8XQ,"Thomas A. Heald ""tomalhe""","[1, 1]","""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" travels with a lot of baggage. It is not a sequel in style, tone or plot to the previous ""X-Files (Fight the Future)"" movie from 1998. That mess (halfway through its television run) involved black alien blood, swarms of bees, and a supply of government conspiracies equaled only by the number of black helicopters chasing agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully through cornfields. It's also less a new episode of the series than it is a religious horror flick that could easily have hit theaters sometime between ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Omen."" Shots are fired and villains chased. But this is still an intimate, atmospheric film where the plot hinges more on one character pressing the resume button on a printer. A later equally dramatic moment occurs when a roadside mailbox, whose numbers match those of a specific Bible verse, is opened.Instead of hunting for aliens, the FBI has more Earth-bound crimes to be solved and hopes to lure Mulder back to duty to save the life of a missing female agent, who may be the victim of a serial killer. The bureaus' only leads are the visions of Joe Crissman, who has led them to a severed arm. But the mental images are less likely to be trusted as he's a defrocked priest and convicted pedophile. As Scully (now a staff physician at Our Lady of Sorrows) notes, it's hard to accept that God is sending lifesaving information and/or ""answering the prayers of a man who's been accused of buggering 37 altar boys.""There are a number of unbelievable things in a saga like this (i.e., what's contained in an organ donor bag/mystery box, the subjects of top secret Russian medical experiments ). Naturally, they are the scary items that always appear in such dreadful places.Father Joe wants to believe that his grotesque past can be the subject of redemption if he is being used by God as an extraordinary vessel to save a life. Scully wants to believe that using stem cells in a dangerous and painful surgery can save the life of Christian, her young patient with Sandhoff disease, a terminal brain condition.The darkness continues to pull Mulder away from Scully. (What ""Spooky"" Mulder's been doing since 2002 and how his former coworker Scully locates him are the true shock of the film.) But it's the story's titular ""beliefs"" and optimism that draw all of its characters into the light.",4,I do believe...,1227312000,"11 22, 2008",2008,2360,"['X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'travels', 'lot', 'baggage', 'not', 'sequel', 'style', 'tone', 'plot', 'previous', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', 'movie', '1998', 'mess', 'halfway', 'television', 'run', 'involved', 'black', 'alien', 'blood', 'swarms', 'bees', 'supply', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'equaled', 'only', 'number', 'black', 'helicopters', 'chasing', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'cornfields', 'also', 'less', 'new', 'episode', 'series', 'religious', 'horror', 'flick', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'hit', 'theaters', 'sometime', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Omen', 'Shots', 'are', 'fired', 'villains', 'chased', 'still', 'intimate', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'where', 'plot', 'more', 'one', 'character', 'pressing', 'resume', 'button', 'printer', 'later', 'equally', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'when', 'roadside', 'mailbox', 'numbers', 'match', 'specific', 'Bible', 'verse', 'opened.Instead', 'hunting', 'aliens', 'FBI', 'more', 'Earth-bound', 'crimes', 'be', 'solved', 'lure', 'Mulder', 'back', 'duty', 'save', 'life', 'missing', 'female', 'agent', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'victim', 'serial', 'killer', 'bureaus', 'only', 'leads', 'are', 'visions', 'Joe', 'Crissman', 'who', 'led', 'severed', 'arm', 'mental', 'images', 'are', 'less', 'likely', 'be', 'trusted', 'defrocked', 'priest', 'convicted', 'pedophile', 'Scully', 'now', 'staff', 'physician', 'Lady', 'Sorrows', 'hard', 'accept', 'God', 'sending', 'lifesaving', 'information', 'answering', 'prayers', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'accused', 'buggering', '37', 'altar', 'boys', 'are', 'number', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'saga', 'i.e.', 'what', 'contained', 'organ', 'donor', 'bag/mystery', 'box', 'subjects', 'top', 'secret', 'Russian', 'medical', 'experiments', 'Naturally', 'are', 'scary', 'items', 'always', 'appear', 'such', 'dreadful', 'places.Father', 'Joe', 'believe', 'grotesque', 'past', 'can', 'be', 'subject', 'redemption', 'being', 'used', 'God', 'extraordinary', 'vessel', 'save', 'life', 'Scully', 'believe', 'using', 'stem', 'cells', 'dangerous', 'painful', 'surgery', 'can', 'save', 'life', 'Christian', 'young', 'patient', 'Sandhoff', 'disease', 'terminal', 'brain', 'condition.The', 'darkness', 'pull', 'Mulder', 'away', 'Scully', 'What', 'Spooky', 'Mulder', 'been', 'doing', '2002', 'how', 'former', 'coworker', 'Scully', 'are', 'true', 'shock', 'film', 'story', 'titular', 'beliefs', 'optimism', 'characters', 'light']",The X-Files TV Series
1171591,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001BCO8XQ,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 6]","Based on the terrible box office for the first weekend of ""The X-Files: I Want To Believe"", a lot of people have apparently lost the faith.An FBI Agent is missing and ASAC Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) and her colleague Special Agent Mosley Drummy (Xzibit) have turned to a defrocked former priest Father Joseph Crissman (Billy Connolly) for help. Father Joe claims to have visions and these visions prove pretty accurate in helping with the investigation, but doubt is quickly cast on the convicted pedophile. But they still need help, so Drummy approaches Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) at the Catholic hospital where she works in pediatrics. They would like to find former agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and get his help; if he is able to assist, ""all will be forgotten"". Scully doesn't know where Fox is, as they don't work together anymore. That evening, she returns home and tells Mulder about the offer; Mulder has been living with Scully, secretly, off the grid for some time. Mulder is intrigued and agrees to help, but only if Scully will join them. But Scully is dealing with issues of her own and trying to decide whether she should do an experimental surgery on one of her patients; it might save the young boy's life but it could also cause him a lot of pain. In the end, they decide to help and Mulder becomes intrigued by the former priest's visions. Father Joe hopes that if he helps with this, God will look favorably upon him and forgive him his former sins. Then more young ladies begin to disappear and the hunt intensifies. Will they be able to unravel the mystery and find the missing agent?Written by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Carter, ""I Want To Believe"" is a very watch able film. It isn't the best film I have ever seen, but it is well made, to an extent, and will provide some suspense.I was a huge fan of the television series and watched the show avidly for the first five seasons. Then, I began to lose interest. Anyone who is even remotely familiar with the series knows that the majority of the shows dealt with Mulder's preoccupation with UFOs and his feelings that his sister had been abducted. Many cases often started out as something completely unconnected and then a connection was established. And occasionally, Carter and Spotnitz would throw in a 'stand-alone' story. ""I Want To Believe"" is a stand-alone story. While I believe this is a smart move, it may also be the factor keeping many of the die-hard fans away.It has been a number of years since the show ended and even longer since the last film. So to create a film picking up where the series left off would not be a great idea. Too much time has passed and any of those conspiracy theories Mulder often obsessed on would have to be reestablished, especially for the people who were not familiar with the series. For this reason, there is only the briefest mention of Mulder's sister and it doesn't have a connection to the story of this film.But this is probably the only reason a large core of the fan base would come to this new X-Files film; to see Mulder and Scully pick up where they left off. Because this isn't the case, I suspect the fanbase is staying away in droves. Or perhaps, they are just more interested in newer obsessions like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"".David Duchovny is one of those actors who lucks upon a role tailor made for their personality and skill as an actor. The role made Duchovny a star and he has had little success with his film career since. Duchovny is not a great actor and his lack of emotional range fits well with the obsessed, less emotional Fox Mulder. It is difficult now to imagine any other actor playing the role because it has become so associated with the actor, but Duchovny's lack of success with any film since shows the limited skill of the actor.In ""I Want to Believe"", Duchovny and Carter loosen up Mulder a bit. He is a little softer, a little bit more jokey and still as obsessed as ever with all of the conspiracy theories, combing through newspapers and cutting out stories to hang on the walls of his office. It is also nice to see that he and Scully have hooked up and are sharing a life together. I guess after so long as professional partners together, it is difficult for them to stop addressing each other as ""Mulder"" and ""Scully"" now that they are lovers, but at least they have made that next step.Gillian Anderson has always been the better actor and in ""I Want To Believe"" she continues to outshine. She also has her own separate story in the film, how she is going to handle the dilemma of her young patient. So, the case of the missing FBI agent comes as a distraction and she only gets involved because Mulder asks her for her help. Throughout, she is also extremely reticent to believe anything Father Joe says. He is an affront to her on two different levels; as a pedophile, he has victimized children and gone against his beliefs and the doctrine of his church. Both of these points are driven home by the fact Scully works as a pediatrician at a Catholic Hospital.Amanda Peet plays Special Agent in Charge Dakota Whitney. When Mulder and Scully first meet her, she appears to be tough as nails and capable to lead the investigation. She was, in fact, the person who initiated contact with Mulder, believing he might be able to help. So she seems very capable, very tough. But as soon as Mulder enters the picture, she begins following him around like a little puppy dog. ""Really? What do you think we should do next?"" It almost appears as though Whitney idolizes Mulder and this sudden shift is problematic for her character. It also moves her into the background and makes her character superfluous.Come to think of it, why does she initiate contact with Mulder in the first place? The only unusual aspect of this case is Father Joe and his premonitions. There are no mentions of UFOs, extraterrestrials, etc. So, what are Mulder's qualifications for working on the missing persons case? Because he has worked on them before? Haven't all FBI agents?And Xzibit joins the case as Agent Drummy. He is stony faced and seems to have little tolerance for Mulder and Scully and Father Joe. He doesn't believe in Father Joe's premonitions, or in Mulder's skills and doesn't believe any of this is going to help their case.Oh, wait. I get it. Whitey and Drummy are pretty much the same characters as Mulder and Scully, but their genders have switched. And they aren't as interesting. Whitney, the female agent ""believes"" and Drummy, the male agent, is skeptical. Subtle, Mr. Carter.One of the reasons to make a big screen adaptation of a television series, beyond trying to extend the story and the franchise, is to take on a bigger story, something you are unable to do within the financial and time constraints of a television series. ""Believe"" takes place primarily in Virginia during the winter, making it easy for them to film in British Columbia. But it doesn't feel bigger than the TV show, except in length.The mystery involving the missing agent and other missing women in the area becomes interesting and involving, but it ultimately begs the question, what do they want to believe it? It doesn't connect to the main conspiracy theories so prevalent in the story and doesn't really seem to cause Mulder to question anything except whether he should become involved with the FBI again.And you must answer the question ""Should you become involved with ""The X-Files"" again?"" That is a personal question that only you (and all of the aliens who have been probing you for years) can answer.",3,"Can You ""Believe"" Again?",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,7592,"['Based',

How you'd be a little bummed if the paranormal was just a little too normal? But you'd sit through it anyways because Mulder and Scully were one of the best teams on TV for almost a decade?Welcome to ""X-Files: I Want To Believe."" No aliens. No bug-eyed monsters. Not much by way of paranormal activity. The plot is a basic creepy cop suspense story, dealing with kidnapping and black market body organs. The only thing ""strange"" about it is Billy Connelly's psychic priest, who forces Scully to once again confront her skepticism.There are no real revelations to be found in this movie, the way 1999'sThe X-Files - Fight the Futuredid. In fact, if you replace David Duchoveny and Gillian Anderson with anyone else, it would have been a run-of-the-mill suspense flick. But their chemistry, still intact all these years later, is a joy to see onscreen again. Old topics are brought up (Mulder's sister, their son William) and then dropped, making this feel like a series restart.However, this probably won't appeal to many beyond theThe X-Filesfanbase.

1171594,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B001BCO8XQ,Tom Birkenstock,"[3, 3]","Six years after the series finale of the cult hit comes the second theatrical X-Files film. The show may have ended six years ago but for those who kept with the series through the exhausted ninth season know full well that the TV show died long before the final episode. In one of the biggest television mistakes since the introduction of cousin Oliver, the producers decided that The X-Files was really about the monsters and not really about the relationship between Mulder and Scully and decided to introduce two new agents: Doggett and Reyes. Perhaps the biggest insult to fans was how the writers tried to slip these new characters into the show like they were dealing cards from the bottom of the deck, assuming the audience would be none the wiser. Mulder went on the lam, making guest appearances every now and then, and Scully became pregnant which regulated her to the role of consultant for Doggett and Reyes. The X-Files: I Want to Believe comes off as an apology of sorts for trying to move the spotlight away from the two agents we actually cared about. Interesting enough, the film is less concerned with the supernatural mystery than it is with the relationship between the two leads.As the film opens we discover Scully once again practicing medicine like she had contemplated several times during her F.B.I. career. She now works at the Catholic hospital Our Lady of Sorrows where she is treating a young boy with an incurable brain disease. Since the series ended Scully and Mulder have moved in together and when Scully is at work Mulder remains at home still obsessing over the death of his sister, even though he knows full well she died decades ago. In the first ten minutes X-Files creator and co-scribe, Chris Carter, proves how well he knows these characters. Scully was never comfortable at the F.B.I. and always had doubts that she was doing more good working for the federal government than working in medicine. The X-Files was never her obsession, a conflict that remains central in I Want to Believe. Mulder now sports a Ted Kacsinski like beard which hints at the anti-government paranoiac that has he has always been in danger of becoming. Scully still serves as Mulder's anchor and without her one could imagine Mulder mailing letter bombs from his homemade shack in the woods. Despite the new setting one can immediately tell these are the same two characters we watched hunt monsters every week, but at the same time it's apparent that the past six years have weighed heavily on them.Since the trial of the series finale, Mulder has become a forced recluse wanted by the F.B.I. When a self-professed psychic and ex-priest, Father Joe, turns up claiming to have visions about a recently missing F.B.I. agent one of the lead investigators decides to offer Mulder immunity in exchange for his help in either confirming or debunking Father Joe's abilities. There are many reasons to doubt Father Joe's story, the least of which is that before he was excommunicated from the church he molested over thirty boys. Of course, once on the case Mulder can't stop at just giving his professional opinion on the paranormal and begins settling into his role as an F.B.I. profiler. Scully is naturally afraid that Mulder is being pulled back into a life they both gave up long ago.The movie takes plenty of risks, the first of which is that from the beginning Mulder and Scully are in a conjugal relationship. The obvious choice for a film like this is to fall back on the ""will they or won't they"" tension that was one of the hallmarks of the television show. Instead the movie deals with all too obvious questions about how two workaholics can live together and whether Mulder should be putting himself in danger with someone waiting for him at home. The second major risk is Scully's subplot concerning her young patient whose only chance for a cure winds up being an experimental stem-cell treatment. Naturally, this doesn't sit well with priests at the hospital.In a film that ponders such timely subjects like God, stem-cell research, and gay marriage, perhaps the biggest taboo the film broaches is the portrayal of a sustained relationship in a Hollywood film. When an audience has become accustomed to an unrequited love between two characters it can be difficult to imagine the same two characters living with one another every day, but thanks to great performances by Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny the transition seems completely natural. The intervening years are scrawled on Duchovny's and Anderson's face, the former appears more world wearied and the latter strikes a more regal profile. As a couple they are reminiscent of that pair of slightly eccentric liberals who have strange stories about backpacking through the Ural Mountains and every time you come over offer up a different vintage wine that's just right for the occasion.Special mention must be made of Billy Connolly's role as Father Joe. Because of his work as a comedian it's easy to underestimate Connolly's acting ability but here he perfectly nails the ambiguity of someone who may be either faking visions from God in order to weasel his way back into the church or he actually believes he is receiving these visions as a means of redemption. The presence of Father Joe carries some heavy implications. Are the visions actually from God and if they are then are they meant for redemption or punishment? What about Father Joe's pedophile urges, did they originate from the almighty?Much like The Dark Knight, I Want to Believe uses a thriller format to delve into deeper questions. That's not to say that the film doesn't stumble in parts. It is difficult to believe that Scully is capable of organizing experimental surgery within the course of an evening's work and a quick search of the internet. In a film dealing with psychic visions you don't want the science to be the least believable part of the story. Of course, this is a small price to pay for a thriller with something to say.Judging by the box office numbers there appears to be little chance for a third film. In a way that's all right since I Want to Believe manages to finish the story the TV show started. Not about the alien conspiracy, there are plenty of unanswered questions left over from the show, but rather about the real story: the relationship between Mulder and Scully. Now that fans of the series know the two remain together whether there's an alien invasion or not doesn't really matter, and even if this is the last X-Files story told it works perfectly as a tidy epilogue to a very, very long story.",4,"An Epilogue to a Very, Very Long Story",1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,6595,"['Six', 'years', 'series', 'finale', 'cult', 'hit', 'second', 'theatrical',

In the FBI that once meant the tandem of Special Agent D. Scully and Spooky Fox Mulder but that is no longer the case. Now all you see when you look their way are two people the FBI has tried to discredit, one reclusive and somewhat ""on the run"" and the other working for Our Lady of Sorrow and trying to keep the darkness at bay, until a series of odd events hit the FBI. First an FBI agent disappears, then a priest who has fallen-from-grace sees visions, and then the ""discovery"" happens. After that, the FBI asks for help which Spooky is all-too-willing to give and which Skully is afraid will lead toward something - bad - again.Since the beginning of the series, there have been cries for movies dealing with X-files. The first movie was met with mixed reviews (I liked it, personally, but understand if others did not) and the second is apparently doing the same. Personally, I really needed the extended edition to see everything that wanted to come out. The theatrical - yeah, but the rest - better. Other peoople still do not see this as enough and, in some ways, I see what they mean. A lot of time has passed for one thing, a lot of things have happened that are alluded to in the movie for another (I liked that myself), and sometimes listening to these people makes me think they wanted more than a movie. Listening alludes to a hope that the X-files would come back once more, a great and noble hope but one I do not see ever happening (sadly), and that viewers would once again bathe in the glory that was Rome - wait, I mean X-Files (sorry, after 9 seasons, it seemed like an empire). People also complained about the content, saying it did not have their favorite little beasties from the series, and I'm not sure I agree with that. Personally, I wanted a show by Carter that had my two main tastes, an X-File story that involved a question of some sort, and something I could say that ""I want to believe"" in. Some aspects of the priest make that problematic for some, time makes that hard for others, and the lack of gray friends gets people made as well. Still, everyone kinda knew this would happen from the beginning: there are always going to be people who do not like a new X-Files movie.In some places I do agree that there were some unneeded areas. I really did not need so much questioning when it came to the ""what if"" with our seer, and I really didn't need to have Mulder second-questioned so much. It did have its place, however, and did not hurt the movie. The acting was also top notch (as expected) and I watched with eyes glued, trying not to miss anything, Combine this with extras like digital download, some music I was not so keen on from Xhibit, a pretty funny gag reel, explanations of prosthetics, and commentary and you have a nice little movie. How much of one - much like the series, people could never agree on what episodes they liked the most, much less what the movie should contain.Watch it for yourself and, if you enjoy X-files, watch it with a mind awash with a want for nothing save a rare treat most of us never thought would happen (its almost an X-file, if you look at it in that right).Enjoyable.",4,Looking through Dirty Glass,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,3207,"['X-file', 'case', 'not', 'solvable', 'normal', 'means', 'FBI', 'once', 'meant', 'tandem', 'Special', 'Agent', 'D.', 'Scully', 'Spooky', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'no', 'longer', 'case', 'Now', 'see', 'when', 'look', 'way', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'FBI', 'tried', 'discredit', 'one', 'reclusive', 'somewhat', 'run', 'other', 'working', 'Lady', 'Sorrow', 'trying', 'keep', 'darkness', 'bay', 'series', 'odd', 'events', 'hit', 'FBI', 'First', 'FBI', 'agent', 'disappears', 'then', 'priest', 'who', 'fallen-from-grace', 'sees', 'visions', 'then', 'discovery', 'happens', 'FBI', 'help', 'Spooky', 'all-too-willing', 'give', 'Skully', 'afraid', 'will', 'lead', 'something', 'bad', 'again.Since', 'beginning', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'cries', 'movies', 'dealing', 'X-files', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'met', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'liked', 'personally', 'understand', 'others', 'did', 'not', 'second', 'apparently', 'doing', 'same', 'Personally', 'really', 'needed', 'extended', 'edition', 'see', 'everything', 'wanted', 'come', 'out', 'theatrical', 'yeah', 'rest', 'better', 'Other', 'peoople', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'enough', 'ways', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'lot', 'time', 'passed', 'one', 'thing', 'lot', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'are', 'alluded', 'movie', 'liked', 'sometimes', 'listening', 'people', 'think', 'wanted', 'more', 'movie', 'Listening', 'alludes', 'hope', 'X-files', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'once', 'more', 'great', 'noble', 'hope', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'ever', 'happening', 'sadly', 'viewers', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'bathe', 'glory', 'was', 'Rome', 'wait', 'mean', 'X-Files', 'sorry', '9', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'empire', 'People', 'also', 'complained', 'content', 'saying', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'favorite', 'little', 'beasties', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'Personally', 'wanted', 'show', 'Carter', 'had', 'two', 'main', 'tastes', 'X-File', 'story', 'involved', 'question', 'sort', 'something', 'could', 'say', 'want', 'believe', 'aspects', 'priest', 'make', 'problematic', 'time', 'hard', 'others', 'lack', 'gray', 'friends', 'people', 'made', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'everyone', 'kinda', 'would', 'happen', 'beginning', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'new', 'X-Files', 'movie.In', 'places', 'do', 'agree', 'were', 'unneeded', 'areas', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'so', 'much', 'questioning', 'when', 'came', 'what', 'seer', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'Mulder', 'second-questioned', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'have', 'place', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'hurt', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'expected', 'watched', 'eyes', 'glued', 'trying', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'Combine', 'extras', 'digital', 'download', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'keen', 'Xhibit', 'pretty', 'funny', 'gag', 'reel', 'explanations', 'prosthetics', 'commentary', 'have', 'nice', 'little', 'movie', 'How', 'much', 'one', 'much', 'series', 'people', 'could', 'never', 'agree', 'liked', 'most', 'much', 'less', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'contain.Watch', 'enjoy', 'X-files', 'watch', 'mind', 'awash', 'want', 'nothing', 'save', 'rare', 'treat', 'most', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'happen', 'almost', 'X-file', 'look', 'right', '.Enjoyable']",The X-Files TV Series

1171598,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001BCO8XQ,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","One good news about ""The X Files: I Want to Believe,"" second feature-length film based on the TV series (1993-2002) is that Mulder and Scully are back, with their chemistry intact. Naturally David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson look older, but their characters haven't essentially changed since the last time we saw them together on TV. Mulder is still a believer of the paranormal phenomena while Scully is a skeptic who is somehow attracted to Mulder's belief and, more importantly, Mulder as a man. If you are looking forward to seeing these two beloved characters (and I believe most people would), the new film is fairly entertaining.Bad news is, ""The X Files: I Want to Believe,"" directed by Chris Carter himself, doesn't have a story that really interests us. Billy Connolly plays a retired (and once convicted) priest who, he claims, can see things with his supernatural powers. He actually finds something that might prove his abilities and Amanda Peet's agent, together with Mulder who is called back to duty by FBI, investigates a case of another agent who is missing for more than three days. Scully, who is now working at a hospital as a doctor, rather reluctantly joins them. Everything in the story looks as if they are borrowed from somewhere else, except the two main characters.Actually, it seems Chris Carter is more interested in showing us Mulder and Scully, focusing their relationships, than following the case of a missing agent for which they are called back again on screen. His decision is understandable - after all the original TV series worked because of their characters - but still the film which obviously needs a more compelling story also spends considerable time following the sub-plot about a patient in the hospital where Scully works. Carter's direction only slows down the pace of the film, and the slower pace only exposes the plot holes in the weak script.Some people complain that the film doesn't have UFOs or conspiracy theories, but to me the real problem of the film is the lack of mystery and coherent storyline. I know this is not an action film, but as you know, having a more engaging story does not hurt.",3,Welcome Back Mulder and Scully; But There Is a Slight Problem with the Story...,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,2155,"['One', 'good', 'news', 'X', 'Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'second', 'feature-length', 'film', 'based', 'TV', 'series', '1993-2002', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'back', 'chemistry', 'intact', 'Naturally', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'look', 'older', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'essentially', 'changed', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'together', 'TV', 'Mulder', 'still', 'believer', 'paranormal', 'phenomena', 'Scully', 'skeptic', 'who', 'somehow', 'attracted', 'Mulder', 'belief', 'more', 'importantly', 'Mulder', 'man', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'two', 'beloved', 'characters', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'new', 'film', 'fairly', 'entertaining.Bad', 'news', 'X', 'Files', 'Want', 'Believe', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'have', 'story', 'really', 'interests', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'retired', 'once', 'convicted', 'priest', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'things', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'actually', 'something', 'might', 'prove', 'abilities', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'agent', 'together', 'Mulder', 'who', 'called', 'back', 'duty', 'FBI', 'case', 'agent', 'who', 'missing', 'more', 'three', 'days', 'Scully', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'rather', 'reluctantly', 'Everything', 'story', 'are', 'borrowed', 'somewhere', 'else', 'two', 'main', 'characters.Actually', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'more', 'interested', 'showing', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'focusing', 'relationships', 'following', 'case', 'missing', 'agent', 'are', 'called', 'back', 'again', 'screen', 'decision', 'understandable', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'worked', 'characters', 'still', 'film', 'obviously', 'more', 'compelling', 'story', 'also', 'considerable', 'time', 'following', 'sub-plot', 'patient', 'hospital', 'where', 'Scully', 'Carter', 'direction', 'only', 'down', 'pace', 'film', 'slower', 'pace', 'only', 'plot', 'holes', 'weak', 'script.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'UFOs', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'lack', 'mystery', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'know', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'know', 'having', 'more', 'engaging', 'story', 'not', 'hurt']",The X-Files TV Series

The first film dealt with all the things the X-Files fans seemed to love: the conglomerate of gray-suited men with names like ""cigarette smoking man"", sitting in well-appointed rooms saying things like, ""You're in way over your head, Mulder.""  Something to do with the mythology that I don't think ever concluded satisfyingly ... even for fans.However ... 'I Want to Believe' is a stand alone and doesn't have to spend time explaining itself.  It brings together agents Mulder and Scully in the search for a missing FBI agent, with the help of a fallen priest that Scully regards with little more than contempt.  The familiar elements are here: the argument between the spiritual and the scientific, the unexplainable that, in the end, is either explained or left with an even bigger question mark, and the terrific chemistry between agents Mulder and Scully.  If anything, it's better ... with age and wisdom and maturity added to the supernatural mix.  And let's face it, at the end of a long hot summer of '08, it was nice to see two human beings using their intelligence to solve a crime that didn't involve defying all the laws of physics in an overtly CGI manner while wearing Kevlar or a clown face or an iron suit while explosions littered the landscape.  Those were fun movies ... but X-Files provided a thoughtful and atmospheric end to the summer season.  And now you can take it home and really appreciate the almost quiet way this movie works its spell.  It's almost not for anyone under the age of 30.  'I Want to Believe' is a throwback to movies made at least three decades ago when intelligent characters could act their age and still be very interesting.'I Want to Believe' is a terrific piece of the X-Files puzzle.

She is a surgeon at a Cathloic Hospital and he sits in his room and clips newspaper articles about strange happenings. You know, the usual. Then an FBI Agent is kidnapped and a defroked Catholic Priest claims he has visions relating to the crime. The Bureau doesn't know how to deal with this kind of ""evidence,"" so they send The Bat Signal to Mulder. He does not want to get involved but Scully convinces him otherwise.Without giving anything away, the story centers on belief, or faith, and  ethical choices those in the movie make on the basis of nothing more than faith. Mulder has faith in the defroked Priest and belives him. Scully does not, at least as far at the kidnapping case is concerned. But Scully does have faith that a radical new stem cell therapy can save one of her pediatric patients. The hospital's Catholic administration has faith in each person's right to life, but has no faith in the radical stem cell procedure which is the dying kids only hope. It is never made clear if the therapy involves embroynic stem cells or the other kind. In any event, the hospital wants to, in effect, sign the kid's death warrant and send him off to a hospice enviornment. The hospital has faith that such is God's will. All the while, the defrocked Priest has faith that God is communicating with him by way of these visions.So who has the right faith? Mulder, Scully, the Priest and/or the hospital's administration? And what ethical choices should we make based on nothing other than faith? Well, you will need to watch the movie to find out what happens. But know this, the case of the kidnapped FBI Agent turns pretty creepy. The science fiction in this story is not all that far removed from the real world.

The first five seasons were one of the best things to grace television in my opinion. Being an ""X-files"" fan, of course I would be rather curious as to how this new movie would pan out. The first film based on the series, ""X-Files: Fight the Future"" was tied into the series continuity--the second film, this time around is a more of a sci-fi drama aimed towards fan of the series. Chris Carter is at the helm as director of ""X-Files: I want to Believe"", and he takes aim at not aliens, ghouls and conspiracies but rather directly at religion and science.Monica Bannon is an F.B.I. agent who disappears after a violent attack. The bureau of course takes care of its own and special agent Whitney (Amanda Peet) is assisted by a ""psychic"" named Joe who is also a former priest and a convicted pedophile. When the investigation gets to be a bit more than the usual detective work can handle, agent Whitney enlists the aid of former F.B.I. agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to find her former partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) who specializes in the ""spooky"" cases in the past. Mulder lives as a recluse since he was stripped of his credibility and Scully is now a practicing doctor. The two are very reluctant to assists but they find themselves drawn to the mystery of father Joe (Billy Connolly)...Now this is a review of the extended cut and since I haven't seen the theatrical release, please bear with me as I try to grapple with the film. Director Chris Carter does attempt at a fresh start as he sidesteps the temptation of making a movie with the same old stuff. The film's main premise is about religion and of course science--its abominations and advantages. Father Joe was a ""tainted"" priest looking for forgiveness and of course he is not a very credible source of information. There is a subtle commentary about redemption and the ease of hasty human judgments, the film does dawdle a little at these elements. The film also has a very provocative subject matter about the aberrations of science.Carter uses Scully's new-found position as a practitioner of medicine to further emphasize medical science's advantages all the while focusing on its potential perversions. The film is a thematic affair, the film has some strong references to faith, religion and medical issues. ""I want to Believe.."" isn't preaching on those issues but it was very obvious that it was trying to appeal to one's skepticism and interest about those issues. The film does have a very interesting premise but I have to say the film's script was a tad unpolished and unrefined. Some elements' motivations are left to the audience's perception and does open some holes.The film dwells on the Scully's and Mulder's reluctance to restart their former lives and the dialogue is filled with speeches that serves as exposition to the musings of the duo. While it is quite interesting to see Scully and Mulder deliver their usual discussions, it became a little too heavy-handed and the pace became a little too slow for my taste. I do understand Carter's sense of restraint; it is very difficult to awaken the characters' sense of passion and relentlessness in a 90+ minute film, that he needed to rely a little on familiarity. Carter did find the series' spirit and sense of pace but he played a little too safe and avoided taking any risks. Carter must've been concerned that he may lose control if he relied on intense scenes than character interaction. I `m not saying this as a negative comment but rather a simple observation.""X-Files: I want to Believe"" does not offer any surprises, and it does come a little short on suspense and thrills. However, it was really fun to see Mulder and Scully scurry around amid the usual intrigue and controversy--it feels like ""old times"". The film doesn't add that much to the ""X-Files"" mythos and its execution is something we have seen before. The film does have its effective mystery and it emulated the tempo of the TV series; it does get under one`s skin in some ways. The faith and medical thing did manage to show good emotions. ""I want to Believe"" isn't as exciting an experience as I'd hoped it to be but at least I wasn't unhappy with Carter's intentions.Recommended! [3  stars] Rounded up because of its sense of nostalgia.Video/audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Great transfer on the DVD especially when up-converted to 1080p. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is quite powerful and clear.Extras: Director full-length commentary/ interview with Chris Carter/ deleted scenes/ EFX feature/ Xzibit music video/galleries.Disc 2 has a documentary called ""Trust No one: Can X-Files remain a secret?"" that covers the film's production.

I think this movie could have been alot better if Chris Carter would have put some conspirasy therory in the movie. That is what made the TV show work.However, it was good to see Duchovny (Mulder) and Anderson (Scully) back together again.I am hopfull for another X-Files movie, and if done correctly it could be very good!!",2,I Want To Believe this could be better,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,454,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'X-Files', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'hoped', 'basiclly', 'stand', 'alone', 'episode', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'conspirasy', 'therory', 'movie', 'what', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'work.However', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Duchovny', 'Mulder', 'Anderson', 'Scully', 'back', 'together', 'again.I', 'am', 'hopfull', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'done', 'correctly', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good']",The X-Files TV Series
