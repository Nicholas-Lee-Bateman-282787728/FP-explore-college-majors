Out of 4 discs, I only watch 2 regularly. So 50% is great and 50% not so great in my opinion. I like Pop-Eye and Betty Boop. I'd never seen Betty Boop cartoons before, only her image. This disc set made me a fan. Luckily both of those are on the same disc so I don't have to switch around. I enjoy this collection, but still I can't help but be a little disappointed.

1243492,A2BFC5WQGVP27G,B001VEF7ZM,"J. W. Kennedy ""in statu uiae et meriti""","[24, 26]","The print quality varies with the original media.  Some of these might have been captured from old film prints, but a lot of them are the ""TV"" versions of much older cartoons, with syndicate titles spliced on.  These were digitized off of old videotape; in many cases the sound is warbly and sometimes the picture smears out due to bad tracking on the video play head.  Still, picture quality is acceptable on 90% of these cartoons.Disk 1 is all Betty Boop and Popeye.  There are a few of the substandard Popeye cartoons made for King Features, but most of them are good ones from the Fleischer studios.  ""Big Bad Sindbad"" is repeated on disk 4 as ""Popeye Meets Sindbad the Sailor.""Disk 2 has the most dubious content, as well as the worst overall picture and sound quality.  Here we have such un-funny relics as:  The Toonerville Trolley, Herman, Mr. Piper (which I would hesitate to call ""animation""), and the excremental New Three Stooges.  Those Stooges cartoons need to be burned and the ashes jettisoned into space.  They are the worst thing I have ever seen.Disk 3 is the jewel of the collection:  A random assortment of classics from 1929 up into the 1950s.  Lots of Fleischer, Van Beuren, Famous Studios, strange corporate-sponsored animation ... there's ""The Story of Time,"" an AMAZING clay animation that was made for Rolex, and ""The Sunshine Makers,"" a creepy Van Beuren milk propaganda cartoon made for Borden.  Also notable is a psychedelic Driver's Ed piece called ""Once Upon a Time.""  We also have some badly-animated and not-funny musical cartoons produced by British legend John Halas.Disk 4 has ""Fraidy Cat"" which is a cleverly written if badly animated TV cartoon from the late 1960s.  It has a laugh track.  Lots of Gumby cartoons will remind you how bizarre Gumby was.  ""Hoppity Hooper"" is a Jay Ward production, exactly like ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" but with a different cast of characters.  Very well written.If you like old cartoons, this set is a fantastic bargain.  Young kids will probably be bored and/or confused by it, but it's a gold mine for the animation geek on a budget.",4,So Completely Worth It,1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,2104,"['print', 'quality', 'varies', 'original', 'media', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'old', 'film', 'prints', 'lot', 'are', 'TV', 'versions', 'much', 'older', 'cartoons', 'syndicate', 'titles', 'spliced', 'were', 'digitized', 'old', 'videotape', 'many', 'cases', 'sound', 'warbly', 'sometimes', 'picture', 'out', 'due', 'bad', 'tracking', 'video', 'play', 'head', 'Still', 'picture', 'quality', 'acceptable', '90', '%', 'cartoons.Disk', '1', 'Betty', 'Boop', 'Popeye', 'are', 'few', 'substandard', 'Popeye', 'cartoons', 'made', 'King', 'Features', 'most', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'Fleischer', 'studios', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Sindbad', 'repeated', 'disk', '4', 'Popeye', 'Meets', 'Sindbad', 'Sailor', 'Disk', '2', 'most', 'dubious', 'content', 'as', 'well', 'worst', 'overall', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'Here', 'have', 'such', 'un-funny', 'relics', 'Toonerville', 'Trolley', 'Herman', 'Mr.', 'Piper', 'would', 'hesitate', 'call', 'animation', 'excremental', 'New', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Stooges', 'cartoons', 'need', 'be', 'burned', 'ashes', 'jettisoned', 'space', 'are', 'worst', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Disk', '3', 'jewel', 'collection', 'random', 'assortment', 'classics', '1929', 'up', '1950s', 'Lots', 'Fleischer', 'Van', 'Beuren', 'Famous', 'Studios', 'strange', 'corporate-sponsored', 'animation', 'Story', 'Time', 'AMAZING', 'clay', 'animation', 'was', 'made', 'Rolex', 'Sunshine', 'Makers', 'creepy', 'Van', 'Beuren', 'milk', 'propaganda', 'cartoon', 'made', 'Borden', 'Also', 'notable', 'psychedelic', 'Driver', 'Ed', 'piece', 'called', 'Once', 'Time', 'also', 'have', 'badly-animated', 'not-funny', 'musical', 'cartoons', 'produced', 'British', 'legend', 'John', 'Halas.Disk', '4', 'Fraidy', 'Cat', 'cleverly', 'written', 'badly', 'animated', 'TV', 'cartoon', 'late', '1960s', 'laugh', 'track', 'Lots', 'Gumby', 'cartoons', 'will', 'remind', 'how', 'bizarre', 'Gumby', 'was', 'Hoppity', 'Hooper', 'Jay', 'Ward', 'production', 'exactly', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'different', 'cast', 'characters', 'Very', 'well', 'like', 'old', 'cartoons', 'set', 'fantastic', 'bargain', 'Young', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bored', 'and/or', 'confused', 'gold', 'mine', 'animation', 'geek', 'budget']",200 Classic Cartoons
