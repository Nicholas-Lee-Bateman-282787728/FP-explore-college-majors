So many fine actors and well known faces it is a real shame it did not come off better.  A great actor can only do so much when handed a piece of trash to work with.  This script was lifeless, the direction uninspired, the music completely obnoxious and the filming stiff.  I can live with a totally predictable plot (what Bonanza episode wasn't)if it is done with intelligence and style, but a bad plot is a bad plot and this one is worse.  Preachy, unrealistic and forced.

Bob just don't seem right (to me) without a horse and a gun in hand, and in this DVD, we have both.  AND some very old kool cars!  I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.  I did watch Bonanza but was not a huge fan.  Laramie and Wagon Train were amongst my favorites.  The title of this DVD made me think it was going to be a poor remake of the old series, but was pleasantly surprised at how terrific the movie really was.  The premise of the changing environment between the old and new west contrasting each other was fabulous.  Bob, as usual he was a shining star and perfect to play the character of Charlie Poke.  I must say, I have already watched it twice and know it will be amongst one of my favorite movies.
