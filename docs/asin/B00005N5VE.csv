It basically starts off with each contestant's audition tape/interview, then proceeds to one scene of something that happened to them during their stay. This is immediately followed by tribal council and their final words. Unlike the first season's video release, there are no additional challenges here, there isn't any additional nudity or profanity (other than the one of Alicia and Kimmi fighting, which we've seen on TV at least a thousand times by now), there isn't any graphic footage of Michael slaughtering the pig. In fact, even the &quot;Symbolic Tribal Council&quot; for Michael's departure that Mark Burnett said wasn't shown on TV but would turn up on the DVD didn't make the final cut.What do you get as far as additional features go? There's footage from all the contestants' appearances on The Early Show. If you have a DVD Rom drive, they've recreated the official CBS web site for the show on disc - including the weekly show summaries, contestant profiles, popularity poll ratings, Outback feature, games and the Real Media video clips. This is rather interesting, since you can read about what happened during their stay in the Outback in full detail, with pictures and video supplementing the experience. However, not all of the video clips on the online site made the transfer to the disc. So basically, if you have an internet connection, logging on to the official site is still a better option.What's good about the DVD? The transfer is brilliant. You can see actual rainfall during scenes where it didn't seem to be raining when the scenes were aired on network TV. But for me to be writing a review about a show and to have to focus on this aspect should tell you what you really need to know about this DVD. After months of anticipation, it's quite a letdown.",2,Very disappointing,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,2037,"['need', 'preface', 'review', 'note', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'quot', 'Survivor', 'quot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'quite', 'bit.There', 'nothing', 'very', 'interesting', 'quot', 'best', 'quot', 'compilation', 'basically', 'contestant', 'audition', 'tape/interview', 'then', 'one', 'scene', 'something', 'happened', 'stay', 'immediately', 'followed', 'tribal', 'council', 'final', 'words', 'first', 'season', 'video', 'release', 'are', 'additional', 'challenges', 'here', ""n't"", 'additional', 'nudity', 'profanity', 'other', 'one', 'Alicia', 'Kimmi', 'fighting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'least', 'thousand', 'times', 'now', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'footage', 'Michael', 'slaughtering', 'pig', 'fact', 'even', 'quot', 'Symbolic', 'Tribal', 'Council', 'quot', 'Michael', 'departure', 'Mark', 'Burnett', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'TV', 'would', 'turn', 'up', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut.What', 'do', 'get', 'as', 'far', 'additional', 'features', 'go', 'footage', 'contestants', 'appearances', 'Early', 'Show', 'have', 'DVD', 'Rom', 'drive', ""'ve"", 'recreated', 'official', 'CBS', 'web', 'site', 'show', 'disc', 'including', 'weekly', 'show', 'summaries', 'contestant', 'profiles', 'popularity', 'poll', 'ratings', 'Outback', 'feature', 'games', 'Real', 'Media', 'video', 'clips', 'rather', 'interesting', 'can', 'read', 'what', 'happened', 'stay', 'Outback', 'full', 'detail', 'pictures', 'video', 'supplementing', 'experience', 'However', 'not', 'video', 'clips', 'online', 'site', 'made', 'transfer', 'disc', 'So', 'basically', 'have', 'internet', 'connection', 'logging', 'official', 'site', 'still', 'better', 'good', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'brilliant', 'can', 'see', 'actual', 'rainfall', 'scenes', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'raining', 'when', 'scenes', 'were', 'aired', 'network', 'TV', 'be', 'writing', 'review', 'show', 'have', 'focus', 'aspect', 'should', 'tell', 'what', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'DVD', 'months', 'anticipation', 'quite', 'letdown']",Survivor - Season Two - The Australian Outback: The Greatest & Most Outrageous Moments VHS

666810,A2HI7DLWKY4QFK,B00005N5VE,"Jill Myles ""Jill Myles""","[12, 13]","It's certainly my favorite Survivor season, and I've been watching since the beginning!This DVD I found in many ways to be better than the Season One DVD, but that's simply because of the cast and the way the DVD is organized.  The extras on this one are pretty nice as well -- you even can go to the expanded Survivor 2 website directly via the DVD just by popping it in the computer. Of course, this can get annoying when you are just trying to WATCH the DVD on the computer and it keeps trying to go to the website. But I can overlook that.Survivor Season 2 is only two hours long.  How did they condense a full season of 14 hours into only two? Alot of the goodies were skipped, unfortunately, and will be skipped until CBS decides to put out a complete season DVD (hint hint). You'll be waiting for the next immunity challenge, and it will skip directly to the Tribal Council. Yuck!I liked that this DVD seemed to touch on all the most dramatic moments of the season (all my favorite parts were there) so I can live with choppy editing.  The nasty bug eating challenge was still there.  The Jerri vs Colby nastiness was still there. So not ALL of the goodies were taken out.Also included were clips of the audition tapes of these survivors, which I loved seeing. Other than that, there's not a ton of 'outrageous' footage that you've never seen before (or CBS would have shown it).It's not a perfect DVD, but if you're a Survivor Fan, it's a must-own anyways.",4,"Australian Outback  DVD -- Great Cast, Not-So-Great DVD",1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,1464,"['certainly', 'favorite', 'Survivor', 'season', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'found', 'many', 'ways', 'be', 'better', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'simply', 'cast', 'way', 'DVD', 'organized', 'extras', 'one', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'can', 'go', 'expanded', 'Survivor', '2', 'website', 'directly', 'DVD', 'just', 'popping', 'computer', 'course', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'WATCH', 'DVD', 'computer', 'trying', 'go', 'website', 'can', 'overlook', 'that.Survivor', 'Season', '2', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'How', 'did', 'condense', 'full', 'season', '14', 'hours', 'only', 'two', 'Alot', 'goodies', 'were', 'skipped', 'unfortunately', 'will', 'be', 'skipped', 'CBS', 'put', 'out', 'complete', 'season', 'DVD', 'hint', 'hint', ""'ll"", 'be', 'waiting', 'next', 'immunity', 'challenge', 'will', 'skip', 'directly', 'Tribal', 'Council', 'Yuck', 'liked', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'touch', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'season', 'favorite', 'parts', 'were', 'there', 'can', 'live', 'choppy', 'editing', 'nasty', 'bug', 'eating', 'challenge', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'Jerri', 'vs', 'Colby', 'nastiness', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'not', 'ALL', 'goodies', 'were', 'taken', 'out.Also', 'included', 'were', 'clips', 'audition', 'tapes', 'survivors', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Other', 'not', 'ton', ""'outrageous"", 'footage', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'CBS', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'not', 'perfect', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'Survivor', 'Fan', 'must-own', 'anyways']",Survivor - Season Two - The Australian Outback: The Greatest & Most Outrageous Moments VHS
666811,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00005N5VE,Lee DeWald,"[3, 4]","First off, let me just say here that I absolutely adored &quot;Survivor 2.&quot;  And this is coming from a person who wasn't even going to watch it.I never watched the original &quot;Survivor.&quot;  I must have been one of about three people on the planet who couldn't tell you anything about the original show.  I still can't; I have yet to see it, and I don't intend on doing so very soon.  But I gave &quot;Survivor 2&quot; a try after some prodding by a friend, and I was hooked after the very first episode.I immediately fell in love with Elisbeth and Rodger after the first episode, as did a lot of America.  I rooted for them every episode, and I was thrilled to see them get as far as they did.But anyway . . . onto the review of this tape, right?  That is, after all, what you're here for isn't it? :)This is a video that wanted to be much better.  It has a lot of deleted footage that viewers haven't seen (including a cute hide-and-go-seek scene played by Colby, Elisabeth, and Tina).  It gives all of the Tribal Councils, and who voted for the person that got booted off at that particular Council.This video goes through each person one by one, and it ultimately ends up with that person getting voted off.  The only problem here is that each sequence is too brief; we get maybe two or three key scenes for each character, and then we're back to Tribal Council.There are still some classic scenes that were not left on the cutting room floor.  Things like Alicia's and Kimmi's &quot;finger waving head bobbing&quot; scene; and the very gripping sequence where Mike falls into the fire.  But so many other things are omitted - things like Colby's mom coming to visit, and Mike chasing after the boar.  Many of the Immunity Challenges are left out, as well.At the end of the video, the final ten contestants' appearances on The Early Show are shown.  These are not the full interviews, but rather, just snippets of the interviews.In short, this is a fine video that wanted to be better.  Here's hoping that someone realizes a DVD or VHS set of the whole series would be a smart idea.  One two-and-a-half hour video just doesn't suffice for 42 days worth of footage.",4,A Good Video that Wanted to be Better,1003881600,"10 24, 2001",2001,2178,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'here', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'quot', 'Survivor', '2.', 'quot', 'coming', 'person', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'going', 'watch', 'it.I', 'never', 'watched', 'original', 'quot', 'Survivor.', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'three', 'people', 'planet', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'original', 'show', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'doing', 'so', 'very', 'soon', 'gave', 'quot', 'Survivor', '2', 'quot', 'try', 'prodding', 'friend', 'was', 'hooked', 'very', 'first', 'episode.I', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'Elisbeth', 'Rodger', 'first', 'episode', 'did', 'lot', 'America', 'rooted', 'episode', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'get', 'as', 'far', 'did.But', 'anyway', 'review', 'tape', 'right', 'what', ""'re"", 'here', ""n't"", 'video', 'wanted', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'deleted', 'footage', 'viewers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'including', 'cute', 'hide-and-go-seek', 'scene', 'played', 'Colby', 'Elisabeth', 'Tina', 'Tribal', 'Councils', 'who', 'voted', 'person', 'got', 'booted', 'off', 'particular', 'Council.This', 'video', 'person', 'one', 'one', 'ultimately', 'up', 'person', 'getting', 'voted', 'off', 'only', 'problem', 'here', 'sequence', 'too', 'brief', 'get', 'maybe', 'two', 'three', 'key', 'scenes', 'character', 'then', ""'re"", 'back', 'Tribal', 'Council.There', 'are', 'still', 'classic', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Things', 'Alicia', 'Kimmi', 'quot', 'finger', 'waving', 'head', 'bobbing', 'quot', 'scene', 'very', 'gripping', 'sequence', 'where', 'Mike', 'fire', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'omitted', 'things', 'Colby', 'mom', 'coming', 'visit', 'Mike', 'chasing', 'boar', 'Many', 'Immunity', 'Challenges', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'well.At', 'end', 'video', 'final', 'ten', 'contestants', 'appearances', 'Early', 'Show', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'not', 'full', 'interviews', 'rather', 'just', 'snippets', 'interviews.In', 'short', 'fine', 'video', 'wanted', 'be', 'better', 'Here', 'hoping', 'someone', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'set', 'whole', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'idea', 'One', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'video', 'just', ""n't"", 'suffice', '42', 'days', 'footage']",Survivor - Season Two - The Australian Outback: The Greatest & Most Outrageous Moments VHS
