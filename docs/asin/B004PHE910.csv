Different actors, different characters, schlock storyline, and ugly waters (or at least the cinematography makes them look ugly). And you know, I had kind of expected a sequel - like what was going on with at least one of the girls from the original movie. But nope, nothing.The surfing is fair - mediocre, kind of faked out (""you just caught the barrel of the day!"" Barrel? What barrel? That was a montage, not a freaking barrel. How many takes did it take?). The whole thing is just kind of surf soft-porn, which really made me mad because ""Blue Crush"" was so darn good and ""Blue Crush 2"" just sort of fed off its title but sucked. I mean Hawai'i compared to South Africa? Don't even make me laugh. Don't waste your money. I recommend ""Soul Surfer"" instead for a good girl surf fix with an inspiring storyline.Ugh, just ugh.",1,Ugh!

I wasn't expecting much but I do enjoy films about being on the beach with beautiful girls, because it reminds me on my Air Force days in Hawaii.However, this film was done on the southern shore of South Africa, and Sasha Jackson who played Dana and Elizabeth Mathis who played Pushy really brought some unfamiliar beauty to the screen, even more appealing to me than the girls of the first film of ""Blue Crush.""The first ""Blue Crush"" film had the now rather familiar Michelle Rodriguez, and though she is attractive, I liked her better when she got older and a bit more mature.  I loved her role in ""Machete.""Anyway, either film is fun to watch if you enjoy pretty girls in bikinis, half-hearted romance dramas, beach scenes, competition, and surfing.

1423586,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B004PHE910,S. Der,"[0, 0]","I didn't really care for Blue Crush 1 and only watched Blue Crush 2 because Sharni Vinson was in it. Well, I didn't know anything else going into the movie and found out it wasn't related to the first movie at all. I was perfectly fine with that because the first movie wasn't a good movie anyways.This movie has plenty of hot girls in it and most of the time you see Sasha Jackson in a bikini looking sexy! The story is a little ify and choppy. It's not a storyline that I really would care  and it was kind of hard to follow. It's just something that keeps the movie going other you just have Sasha Jackson in the water surfing for no reason. lolI think they just put in the ""Blue Crush title"" because they needed more people to watch this movie. And easier to promote it. Otherwise, it would be it's own movie and not as many people would care to watch it then. You could say the only relationship to the first movie is that there are 3 girls in the first movie and the second movie has 3 girls too. Otherwise, it's not related.I didn't like that much of Sharni in the movie. She was in and out the whole time and seemed to be a big character in the beginning, but towards the middle she disappeared for awhile and suddenly just shows up again towards the end.Still Sasha pretty HOT and didn't noticed Sharni was gone until I saw her again at the end.
