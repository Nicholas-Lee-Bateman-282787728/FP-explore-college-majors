1157844,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B0017TCSLW,magellan,"[58, 60]","This video deals with the MJER (muso jikiden eishen-ryu) style of iaido, which is probably the most popular and has a very large number of kata (around 60, and even more if one includes the jodo techniques and waza), providing great diversity and range in the techniques and waza.I am primarily an instructor of other arts (Kali & JKD), but earned my black belt under Hanshi Shimabukuru a few years back. I wanted to get some knowledge and skill in this famous art even though my main interests lay elsewhere.I'm glad I did, and that I hooked up with Hanshi's organization. It's a class act in every way, from the quality of the instruction to the people involved, who have always been very professional and dedicated in their desire to disseminate the art of iaido. To help with that end Hanshi came out with this volume.I've seen many iaido books and videos and sets and this is still my favorite one. This volume goes over basic techniques and principles that are essential to the art, from how to hold the sword to the basic drawing and sheathing techniques. It also covers some etiquette, construction of the sword and its parts, cutting straw mats, and a bit of history. I own the earlier five volume series that Hanshi did back in the 90s also, and that's worth picking up too and has all the waza series, from basic to advanced. Overall a fine video that will help you get started in your iaido studies, or to help you review if you already have an instructor.",5,Excellent in every way,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,1468,"['video', 'MJER', 'muso', 'jikiden', 'eishen-ryu', 'style', 'iaido', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'very', 'large', 'number', 'kata', '60', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'jodo', 'techniques', 'waza', 'providing', 'great', 'diversity', 'range', 'techniques', 'waza.I', 'am', 'primarily', 'instructor', 'other', 'arts', 'Kali', 'JKD', 'earned', 'black', 'belt', 'Hanshi', 'Shimabukuru', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'wanted', 'get', 'knowledge', 'skill', 'famous', 'art', 'even', 'main', 'interests', 'lay', 'elsewhere.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'hooked', 'up', 'Hanshi', 'organization', 'class', 'act', 'way', 'quality', 'instruction', 'people', 'involved', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'professional', 'dedicated', 'desire', 'disseminate', 'art', 'iaido', 'help', 'end', 'Hanshi', 'came', 'out', 'volume.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'iaido', 'books', 'videos', 'sets', 'still', 'favorite', 'one', 'volume', 'basic', 'techniques', 'principles', 'are', 'essential', 'art', 'how', 'hold', 'sword', 'basic', 'drawing', 'sheathing', 'techniques', 'also', 'etiquette', 'construction', 'sword', 'parts', 'cutting', 'straw', 'mats', 'bit', 'history', 'own', 'earlier', 'five', 'volume', 'series', 'Hanshi', 'did', 'back', '90s', 'also', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'too', 'waza', 'series', 'basic', 'advanced', 'Overall', 'fine', 'video', 'will', 'help', 'get', 'started', 'iaido', 'studies', 'help', 'review', 'already', 'have', 'instructor']",Samurai Swordmanship Vol. 1: Basic Sword Program by Masayuki Shimabukuro

The closes school is in Kansas and Missouri, except for a siminar I will not be making that trip.  However, I am not totally new to the katana so this is a great learning tool for me.
