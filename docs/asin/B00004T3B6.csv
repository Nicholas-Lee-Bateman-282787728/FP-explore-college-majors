550117,A14Z16YEVJ16JG,B00004T3B6,Clayton B.,"[0, 0]","When Dinosaurs Ruled was TLC's solution to the cancellation of their other popular documentary series on prehistoric life, called PaleoWorld. If you haven't seen it and are at all interested in this set then I highly recommend looking for it, although it's hard to find nowadays. Paleoworld and When Dinosaurs Ruled have a lot of overlap, in themes, information, and layout.When Dinosaurs Ruled features five episodes, around 45 minutes each. The episodes mainly focus on particular regions of the world during particular ages, and looks at the dinosaurs from there. There are some great interviews with world renowned Paleontologists, including Bob Bakker, Phil Currie, Paul Sereno, and many others. Jeff Goldblum, whom the show clearly snatched up after the success of Jurassic Park 1 and 2, provides the narration. I've found there's some controversy regarding his narration style, but for me it works. He offers a lively narrative, even if he sometimes mispronounces complicated names or places. The show often displays earth on a digitized map and demonstrates the morphing of the continents over time, such as the break up of Pangea. Once in awhile some decent animations or animatronics of dinosaurs make an appearence, but mostly its fact based and interview oriented, unlike the BBC series Walking With Dinosaurs, which is completely different from what is here.As I mentioned earlier, the series is very similar to TLC's PaleoWorld. Almost all of the music is taken straight from that series, as well as significant information on select dinosaurs, such as Cryolophosaurus, Carnotaurus, and Tyrannosaurus Rex, among others. It does offer plenty of other information on new dinosaurs and prehistoric areas (such as cretaceous Australia) never featured in PaleoWorld. There are many things missing here that were abundant in PaleoWorld, but the one change that I dislike the most is the lack of Paleo-Art. Basically just images and artists' renderings of the extinct animals in their environs, they made PaleoWorld have a very relaxed, well balanced pace, and depicted dinosaurs in various, interesting ways. Here, there is next to none, instead When Dinosaurs Ruled opts for more scenic shots to represent the past environments or recycled footage of dinosaur animations, which brings me to the more negative points.Some of the animations used are okay, and there's even some stop motion which isn't half bad. The problem is how often they reuse it. Seriously, we're seeing the same shot of a Tyrannosaurs Rex stomping through the forest in choppy, slow motion, and the show tries to trick the audience by first saying what dinosaur it is supposed to represent, even though it is clearly the same one over and over again. I may have picked up on this so severely because I watched all the episodes back to back. A viewer who casually tuned in to watch one episode back in the broadcast day or missed the first episode might not have noticed as much, but even then, there are episodes where the same footage is recycled several times throughout. In particular, the T.rex I already mentioned, as well as a small meat eating dinosaur running around on two legs, which is used to depict multiple dinosaurs, everything from a baby T.rex to Leaylleanosaura to a dinosaur called Kirky.Another issue I have with the show is some of the science. Even though much of it is still relevant today, the show tends to make fairly outlandish conclusions and hypotheses on dinosaurs based on little supporting evidence. Some huge mistakes now recognized as being wrong plague all the episodes, some more severely than others. Some examples: A T.rex skeleton is being unearthed in episode 2 (Real Jurassic Park). It is estimated to be 65 feet long. That is roughly 20 feet longer than the biggest T.rex described. In the episode about South America, the giant predator Megaraptor--not well known at the time, mind you--is shown as a dromaeosaurid with huge sickle claws on its toes, now known not to be a raptor and its sickle claw was actually a hand claw. Anyone who has seen Jurassic Park 3 knows Spinosaurus had a crocodilian shaped head. Well, here in episode 3 we see a Spinosaurus incorrectly depicted with a typical carnosaur skull. Many other facts have since been cleared up or re-written. What makes PaleoWorld better than When Dinosaurs Ruled in this regard is that much of Paleoworld's science is mere explanation. Plenty of the proposed views on these dinosaurs are treated as such. Rarely are any facts cemented as being truth, they almost always make a point of stating alternate or related views. Here, the audience is often shown or told only one of many possible truths.Despite these scientific discrepancies, the show still packs plenty of substantiated science in, much of it as up-to-date as it gets. If you can get over the recycled dinosaur footage and focus on the actual information being shown, When Dinosaurs Ruled is worth the watch. All TLC needs to do now is release an official collection of PaleoWorld so I can quit watching my old VHS tapes of it and toss them like I did my VHS of When Dinosaurs Ruled.",4,"Interesting, but

These are for older people who want to know and understand dinosaurs. We can't know exactly how they looked or lived. But the Paleoentologists can try to understand by following the evidence. These dvds are pretty good with the information. In a few years some of it may be proven wrong, but you will have learned about dinosaurs that have been found in the past few years, that information wont change. This set has dinosaurs that I have never heard of, and talks about some I have heard of but couldn't find in books.
