I had never seen this movie and didn't know what to expect because I've only seen Audie in westerns and ejoy them all. I thought he did an excellent job in this movie, and it kept my attention all the way through.

Not the action film of Audie Murphy roles I'm use to.

I thought Audie Murphy was better in this than anything I have seen him in before, and I am a big Audie fan, and have seen almost all of his films.  Not a typical role for him.  This movie reminds me of Key Largo with Bogart in certain parts ( not trying to compare it, but you'll see what I mean if you watch it).  I definatly would recommend it. I really enjoyed it and is a must for Audie Murphy fans.  I think this and No Name on the Bullet were his two best films.",4,surprised but pleased,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,511,"['actually', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'thought', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'better', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'am', 'big', 'Audie', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'films', 'Not', 'typical', 'role', 'movie', 'Key', 'Largo', 'Bogart', 'certain', 'parts', 'not', 'trying', 'compare', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', 'definatly', 'would', 'recommend', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'must', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'fans', 'think', 'Name', 'Bullet', 'were', 'two', 'best', 'films']",The Gun Runners

Wright,"[0, 0]","Aside from audie's westerns and war movies, 1958's 'the gun runners' is another favourite of murphy's films of mine.Instead of riding horses he is riding boats, and instead of fighting or shooting with or at the cowboys or Indians, he is smuggling weapons to Cuban rebels, as audie plays sam martin, a small- time charter boat operator on the verge of insolvency, who becomes embroiled in a plot to smuggle guns to rebel Cubans. Also Amongst the fine cast are patricia owens, eddie albert, gita hall, jack elam, richard jaeckel, etc. 'gun runners' was filmed in California's, balboa and Newport bay areas. On release in Australia the film was called, 'guns for the rebels'.Regards,Jack the lad.",4,Audie murphy swaps horses for boats,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,694,"['Aside', 'audie', 'westerns', 'war', 'movies', '1958', ""'the"", 'gun', 'runners', 'favourite', 'murphy', 'films', 'mine.Instead', 'riding', 'horses', 'riding', 'boats', 'instead', 'fighting', 'shooting', 'cowboys', 'Indians', 'smuggling', 'weapons', 'Cuban', 'rebels', 'audie', 'plays', 'sam', 'martin', 'small-', 'time', 'charter', 'boat', 'operator', 'verge', 'insolvency', 'who', 'embroiled', 'plot', 'smuggle', 'guns', 'rebel', 'Cubans', 'Also', 'Amongst', 'fine', 'cast', 'are', 'patricia', 'owens', 'eddie', 'albert', 'gita', 'hall', 'jack', 'elam', 'richard', 'jaeckel', 'etc', 'runners', 'was', 'filmed', 'California', 'balboa', 'Newport', 'bay', 'areas', 'release', 'Australia', 'film', 'was', 'called', ""rebels'.Regards"", 'Jack', 'lad']",The Gun Runners
