437930,A169I83JL8QJGN,6304853653,Daniel A Moir,"[4, 4]","Wong Fei Hung is an important figure, not only to Chinese history, but also to me as a student of the style, which he helped make famous. The Hung Gar Style is traced back to Hung Tsi Kwan (there are lots of debates over the spelling of his name) who taught Luk Ah Choy, and Wong Tai (Wong Fei Hung's grand father) who taught Wong Kei Ying (Fei Hung's father) who refused to teach Fei Hung, forcing him to turn to Luk Ah Choy for lessons. Fei Hung then went on to teach Lam Sai Wing who wrote the book that more or less made the style famous. Hung Gar is a very common style in Southern China, but is very rare stateside with only a small number of schools teaching it. Wong Fei Hung is therefore a matter of great interest to me, which is why I bought this film without actually seeing it first. Sadly I was disappointed.The voice-overs for the English dub of OUATIC 1 and 2 were decent, and I liked the voice actor behind Jet Li in the first two films. Sadly he was replaced with a less appropriate voice actor. I didn't really notice if any of the other mainstays of the series had different voices, but Fei Hung's voice was very different and not as good as the previous installments. Granted bad voice-overs are to be expected with Kung Fu movies, but why fix what isn't broken?The editing in this movie also leaves a lot to be desired as it is the worst editing I have seen in a modern Kung Fu movie, period. Story line wise the movie is very good with a story that sets the stage for the Boxer Rebellion, which shook the very foundations of the Qing (or Ching depending of your spelling preference) Dynasty. In that time frame the Empress decided to use the anti-foreign attitudes of China to what was supposed to be her advantage. The idea was inspire the Martial Artists to revolt against them; she never anticipated that the Martial Artists (many of them Ming Dynasty patriots) would not only violently revolt against the foreigners, but also the Ching themselves. This movie is kind of a precursor to that bloody massacre, with the empress trying to inspire the revolt by hosting a Lion Head (King) competition. Parts of this story are indeed based on actual history, which make this story perhaps the most intriguing of the trilogy. However, now Wong Fei Hung and Cousin Yee are discussing marriage, and while Wong Fei Hung was married three times it was never to his cousin-by-marriage. The bizarre and arguably incestuous relationship gets even more interesting when Lilly Lee meets up with an old flame that has now turned into a Russian-Japanese double agent who is plotting to kill China's President Li. Also in this film is a poorly portrayed Wong Kei Ying, who was in his prime one of the Ten Tigers of Canton (China's greatest fighters at the time). Here the one fight scene he has he looses... and I am sorry, but seeing such a legendary fighter get beaten was kind of an eye roller. I'm as much of a fan of Wong Kei Ying as I am of Wong Fei Hung... I wasn't happy with how the elder Wong was portrayed. On the plus side while the action sequences failed to meet expectations set by the first two the Lion Head sequences are simply breathtaking. I have always loved Lion head dances and hope that one day my SiFu will allow me to participate in one myself. This movie did a fantastic job or portraying the multiple sides of the Lion Head tradition. On the one side, its fascinating to watch, amazing to participate on, and can be a lot of fun over all. On the dark side, they were used to pass messages around during various revolts, and in many cases Lion Heads were used as vehicles of assault, or assassination. This move does a superb job of focusing on both aspects.Although the movie is still good I only recommend it over all for fans, or completists as this is sadly not the OUATIC series' finer moment, and the casual movie goer may not get into it as much.",3,Poor editing and voice overs don't kill this movie entirely,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,3887,"['Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'important', 'figure', 'not', 'only', 'Chinese', 'history', 'also', 'student', 'style', 'helped', 'make', 'famous', 'Hung', 'Gar', 'Style', 'traced', 'back', 'Hung', 'Tsi', 'Kwan', 'are', 'lots', 'debates', 'spelling', 'name', 'who', 'taught', 'Luk', 'Ah', 'Choy', 'Wong', 'Tai', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'grand', 'father', 'who', 'taught', 'Wong', 'Kei', 'Ying', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'father', 'who', 'refused', 'teach', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'forcing', 'turn', 'Luk', 'Ah', 'Choy', 'lessons', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'then', 'went', 'teach', 'Lam', 'Sai', 'Wing', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'more', 'less', 'made', 'style', 'famous', 'Hung', 'Gar', 'very', 'common', 'style', 'Southern', 'China', 'very', 'rare', 'stateside', 'only', 'small', 'number', 'schools', 'teaching', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'therefore', 'matter', 'great', 'interest', 'why', 'bought', 'film', 'actually', 'seeing', 'first', 'Sadly', 'was', 'disappointed.The', 'voice-overs', 'English', 'dub', 'OUATIC', '1', '2', 'were', 'decent', 'liked', 'voice', 'actor', 'Jet', 'Li', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Sadly', 'was', 'replaced', 'less', 'appropriate', 'voice', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'other', 'mainstays', 'series', 'had', 'different', 'voices', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'voice', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'installments', 'Granted', 'bad', 'voice-overs', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', 'why', 'fix', 'what', ""n't"", 'broken', 'editing', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'worst', 'editing', 'have', 'seen', 'modern', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movie', 'period', 'Story', 'line', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'stage', 'Boxer', 'Rebellion', 'shook', 'very', 'foundations', 'Qing', 'Ching', 'depending', 'spelling', 'preference', 'Dynasty', 'time', 'Empress', 'decided', 'use', 'anti-foreign', 'attitudes', 'China', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'advantage', 'idea', 'was', 'inspire', 'Martial', 'Artists', 'revolt', 'never', 'anticipated', 'Martial', 'Artists', 'many', 'Ming', 'Dynasty', 'patriots', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'violently', 'revolt', 'foreigners', 'also', 'Ching', 'movie', 'kind', 'precursor', 'bloody', 'massacre', 'empress', 'trying', 'inspire', 'revolt', 'hosting', 'Lion', 'Head', 'King', 'competition', 'Parts', 'story', 'are', 'indeed', 'based', 'actual', 'history', 'make', 'story', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intriguing', 'trilogy', 'However', 'now', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'Cousin', 'Yee', 'are', 'discussing', 'marriage', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'was', 'married', 'three', 'times', 'was', 'never', 'cousin-by-marriage', 'bizarre', 'arguably', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'Lilly', 'Lee', 'up', 'old', 'flame', 'now', 'turned', 'Russian-Japanese', 'double', 'agent', 'who', 'plotting', 'kill', 'China', 'President', 'Li', 'Also', 'film', 'poorly', 'portrayed', 'Wong', 'Kei', 'Ying', 'who', 'was', 'prime', 'one', 'Ten', 'Tigers', 'Canton', 'China', 'greatest', 'fighters', 'time', 'Here', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'am', 'sorry', 'seeing', 'such', 'legendary', 'fighter', 'get', 'beaten', 'was', 'kind', 'eye', 'roller', ""'m"", 'much', 'fan', 'Wong', 'Kei', 'Ying', 'am', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'how', 'elder', 'Wong', 'was', 'portrayed', 'plus', 'side', 'action', 'sequences', 'failed', 'meet', 'expectations', 'set', 'first', 'two', 'Lion', 'Head', 'sequences', 'are', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Lion', 'head', 'dances', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'SiFu', 'will', 'allow', 'participate', 'one', 'myself', 'movie', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'multiple', 'sides', 'Lion', 'Head', 'tradition', 'one', 'side', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'amazing', 'participate', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'dark', 'side', 'were', 'used', 'pass', 'messages', 'various', 'revolts', 'many', 'cases', 'Lion', 'Heads', 'were', 'used', 'vehicles', 'assault', 'assassination', 'move', 'superb', 'job', 'focusing', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'only', 'recommend', 'fans', 'completists', 'sadly', 'not', 'OUATIC', 'series', 'finer', 'moment', 'casual', 'movie', 'goer', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'much']",Once Upon a Time in China 3 VHS

This installment has him visiting his father's cultural center in Peking, at the same time the Empress decides to hold a Lion Dance competition, to show the rapidly-increasing population of foreigners a thing or two about Chinese athleticism.  On this journey he is accompanied by his disciple, Foon (Max Mok), and his westernized Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan, ""Shanghai Express""), related by marriage, to whom he is secretly engaged.  Amidst the chaos of warring factions bent on winning the Lion Dance is a Russian diplomat who once had quite a thing for Yee when they were educated together in London.While the weakest of the original trilogy, director Tsui Hark (""Seven Swords"") still delivers a pretty sweet flick.  Unique, too.  It's not without its flaws but when a martial arts movie appeals to me beyond the fights, they're doing something right.  The fights, now choreographed by Yuen Bun, are okay.  As wire-enhanced as they are, they could be a lot worse.  Lau Shun (""The Legend of Zu"") as Wong Kai Ying has my favorite fight in the film as it starts out grounded and full of form.  That is until the introduction of Clubfoot (Xiong Xin-Xin, ""Double Team"")!  Now if you're going to have wire-fu, you need a character like Clubfoot (Thunderfoot in the dubbed version) to carry it out!  This dude is awesome!  He has kind of a squatting, Capoeira-like stance before flying through the air unleashing an array of crazy, rapid kicks!This version from Columbia/Tri Star is as good as you're going to find.  With its widescreen presentation and remastered picture and sound, it's pretty groovy.  In Cantonese or Mandarin with subtitles available in English, French, and Spanish.  Once again, the English-dubbed version is offered as a special feature, not an audio option.  The important thing is that it's there!  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a kung fu movie but I would as a drama that introduces more Chinese esoteric culture to those of us in the occidental world.  If you are interested in the history and culture, avoid the English dub and read the more in-depth subtitles.

437935,A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ,6304853653,"Mr. JKW ""jkw""","[10, 10]","In the third film in this series, martial arts film legend Jet Li stars as Dr. Wong Fei-Hung, a real life folk hero of 19th century China.  Combining solid martial arts action (as you'd expect from a Jet Li movie) with decent storyline which delves into some historical elements, this movie is a decent flick all-around.  While not quite as captivating in terms of action or story as the previous films, III still delivers an acceptable performance.THE STORY:It is 19th century China and Western influence is growing.  The Empress Dowager, in an attempt to showcase Chinese power to the foreigners, hosts a martial arts tournament, the Lion King competition, pitting the finest martial arts schools against one another.  Wong's family's cultural society becomes caught in the middle of the martial arts wars.In the midst of staving off the attacks of their rivals, Wong is also caught in a personal dilemma as he and his secret-lover, his cousin (through marriage) Yee, decide to marry and try to find ways to announce it to their family.  Added to this is the arrival of a Russian friend from Yee's past who is infatuated with her himself, showering her with great Western gifts such as the motion-picture camera.Throughout all of this turmoil, things become a bit more interesting as foreign interests decide to use the tournament as a backdrop to a political assassination plot...THE COOL STUFF:If you love martial arts action you've got a good portion of it here.  The fight scenes are NUMEROUS as you'll be treated to tons of fighting set in 19th century China in tons of marketplace settings as well as vintage Chinese dwellings and buildings.  The sets and costumes are just awesome, particularly all of the Lion dresses.  The fight scenes between Wong and the rival martial artists are just awesome.  In addition this film does incorporate some humorous moments into it.THE DVD FEATURES:The features of the DVD, while not extensive as most new DVDs are, are perfectly acceptable.  Included on this DVD are the following:1. Bonus Movie Trailers for the following:a. Once Upon a Time in China IIb. Once Upon a Time in China Trilogyc. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragond. Miracles by Jackie Chan2. Filmographies for Director Tsui Hark, Jet Li and Rosamund Kwan.THE VERDICT:The most common criticism for most martial arts/action flicks are that the stories [stink].  The redeeming quality for them is, of course, the action.  Like its predecessor, Once Upon a Time in China III overcomes these criticisms by delivering solid action and (lo and behold) a decent story.  In addition, the film, besides having an awesome story and action sequences also incorporates just the right amount of humor to make it a nice package all around.  While not quite as captivating in terms of action or story as its two predecessors, Once Upon a Time in China III still delivers an acceptable performance.Overall, besides oohing and aahing to cool fight scenes you'll also be treated to a great look at a crucial period in Chinese history.Recommended",4,A Decent Installment to the Franchise,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,3033,"['third', 'film', 'series', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'legend', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Dr.', 'Wong', 'Fei-Hung', 'real', 'life', 'folk', 'hero', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'Combining', 'solid', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Jet', 'Li', 'movie', 'decent', 'storyline', 'historical', 'elements', 'movie', 'decent', 'flick', 'all-around', 'not', 'quite', 'captivating', 'terms', 'action', 'story', 'previous', 'films', 'III', 'still', 'acceptable', 'performance.THE', 'STORY', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'Western', 'influence', 'growing', 'Empress', 'Dowager', 'attempt', 'showcase', 'Chinese', 'power', 'foreigners', 'martial', 'arts', 'tournament', 'Lion', 'King', 'competition', 'pitting', 'finest', 'martial', 'arts', 'schools', 'one', 'Wong', 'family', 'cultural', 'society', 'becomes', 'caught', 'middle', 'martial', 'arts', 'wars.In', 'midst', 'staving', 'off', 'attacks', 'rivals', 'Wong', 'also', 'caught', 'personal', 'dilemma', 'secret-lover', 'cousin', 'marriage', 'Yee', 'decide', 'marry', 'try', 'find', 'ways', 'announce', 'family', 'Added', 'arrival', 'Russian', 'friend', 'Yee', 'past', 'who', 'infatuated', 'showering', 'great', 'Western', 'gifts', 'such', 'motion-picture', 'camera.Throughout', 'turmoil', 'things', 'become', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'foreign', 'interests', 'decide', 'use', 'tournament', 'backdrop', 'political', 'assassination', 'plot', 'THE', 'COOL', 'STUFF', 'love', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', ""'ve"", 'got', 'good', 'portion', 'here', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'NUMEROUS', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treated', 'tons', 'fighting', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'China', 'tons', 'marketplace', 'settings', 'as', 'well', 'vintage', 'Chinese', 'dwellings', 'buildings', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'just', 'awesome', 'particularly', 'Lion', 'dresses', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Wong', 'rival', 'martial', 'artists', 'are', 'just', 'awesome', 'addition', 'film', 'incorporate', 'humorous', 'moments', 'it.THE', 'DVD', 'FEATURES', 'features', 'DVD', 'not', 'extensive', 'most', 'new', 'DVDs', 'are', 'are', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'Included', 'DVD', 'are', 'following:1', 'Bonus', 'Movie', 'Trailers', 'following', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'IIb', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'Trilogyc', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragond', 'Miracles', 'Jackie', 'Chan2', 'Filmographies', 'Director', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Rosamund', 'Kwan.THE', 'VERDICT', 'most', 'common', 'criticism', 'most', 'martial', 'arts/action', 'flicks', 'are', 'stories', '[', 'stink', ']', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'course', 'action', 'predecessor', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'III', 'criticisms', 'delivering', 'solid', 'action', 'lo', 'behold', 'decent', 'story', 'addition', 'film', 'having', 'awesome', 'story', 'action', 'sequences', 'also', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'make', 'nice', 'package', 'around', 'not', 'quite', 'captivating', 'terms', 'action', 'story', 'two', 'predecessors', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'III', 'still', 'acceptable', 'performance.Overall', 'oohing', 'aahing', 'cool', 'fight', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'also', 'be', 'treated', 'great', 'look', 'crucial', 'period', 'Chinese', 'history.Recommended']",Once Upon a Time in China 3 VHS

Maybe it is not fair for me to judge this movie because I did watch the English subtitled mode and maybe for the folks that can speak cantonese or mandarin (whatever the choices were) it had a sensible story line, but I still doubt it.  The bad guys in the english subtitled version were supposedly Russian, but I don't think they were in the original version.  I think they were either British  or Americans, I believe they felt it would not be politically correct to slam the us English dogs. They must have altered it in the subtitling ( I first figure this out when one of the supposedly Russians &quot;spoke&quot; using an English word). There were a few other clues that strongly suggested it and  I don't think this movie was intended to be a funny one, but some of the english subtitling was just so ridiculous.  I don't think the person they had doing the english translation, knew english very well or the ways of us white folks.  For example, shouting Bingo while playing with some form of chinese cards was so stupid along with a whole bunch of other circumstances that made no sense.  I hated having rented this movie and felt embarassed that it was my choice at the video store and later having everyone rolling there eyes and falling asleep throughout the movie. It was really that bad.  The only reason I am writing this, is to correct the wrong that some of the people writing these reviews are doing to the general public.  I am really not that discriminating when it comes to movies and for the most part am easily entertained, but this flick, should have found a bic, when they were holding the celluloid.

I know they havent make vol 4 and 5 to reach here, but let me tell u this, in vol 4 they have the lion fight scene expand to a ..well.. somewhat bigger scale and its whole lot better to watch than the one in here. The lion fight scene is absolutely a downside and its taken at the end of the film which make me feel a bit lost after teh movie. Yet this is still one awesome kung fu movie watch though, the part which involves ""club foot"" is very unique and charm, it show Jei Li character's charming side, something rather than just supreme fighting skill that attracted all his students and family members and friends around him with trust. And the laughable romance between the 2 goes further that they finally need to meet the parent. This movie is good one with decent fights in between scene, didnt top vol 2, but it still owns its place. Mark my word for it, go find vol4 on ebay, the new guy is just about as good looking as Jet Li if not more, his fighting talent isnt sharp as Jet Li but just a tiny scotch short u hardly can see it. the huge paper lion fighting scene is even better than this one.",5,u should check out Vol 4 if u love this one..,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1345,"['vol', '3', 'isnt', 'completely', 'good', 'first', '2', 'here', 'why.The', 'last', 'lion', 'scene', 'mess', 'total', 'mess', 'lost', 'control', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'Jet', 'Li', 'martial', 'art', 'skill', 'still', 'help', 'picture', 'much', 'know', 'havent', 'make', 'vol', '4', '5', 'reach', 'here', 'let', 'tell', 'vol', '4', 'have', 'lion', 'fight', 'scene', 'expand', '..well..', 'somewhat', 'bigger', 'scale', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'watch', 'one', 'here', 'lion', 'fight', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'downside', 'taken', 'end', 'film', 'make', 'feel', 'bit', 'lost', 'teh', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'awesome', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'watch', 'part', 'club', 'foot', 'very', 'unique', 'charm', 'show', 'Jei', 'Li', 'character', 'charming', 'side', 'something', 'rather', 'just', 'supreme', 'fighting', 'skill', 'attracted', 'students', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'trust', 'laughable', 'romance', '2', 'further', 'finally', 'need', 'meet', 'parent', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'decent', 'fights', 'scene', 'top', 'vol', '2', 'still', 'place', 'Mark', 'word', 'go', 'find', 'vol4', 'ebay', 'new', 'guy', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'looking', 'Jet', 'Li', 'not', 'more', 'fighting', 'talent', 'isnt', 'sharp', 'Jet', 'Li', 'just', 'tiny', 'scotch', 'short', 'u', 'hardly', 'can', 'see', 'huge', 'paper', 'lion', 'fighting', 'scene', 'even', 'better', 'one']",Once Upon a Time in China 3 VHS
