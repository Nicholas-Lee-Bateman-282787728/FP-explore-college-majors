Released right after the 200 million dollar Titanic; the 70 million Hard Rain seemed to have been another Big Hollywood Watery Disaster film; but no bag of peanuts. The large and varied cast, do and say a lot of things that are entertaining and less deep than the flood level. Still; it's more fun than a barrel of sea monkeys.

It'd get repititious if it weren't so much fun.  He's at the end of a ""clean out the banks before they're flooded"" run, with $3 million in the truck when it's stuck in a deep spot in the ever-present water.Minnie Driver does a fine, if understated, job as the woman who stayed in town too long, preparing a church she's been restoring to weather the flood, who gets involved in the scramble for the cash.  While she's on the side of the good guys, there's no real steam between her and Slater.Randy Quaid is the Sheriff who recently lost his re-election, and is bitter and angry, but determined to do a good job as long as he's on the clock - until the temptation of that money proves to be too much for him.For a film set almost entirely in a nighttime rain, the camerawork is amazingly good.  The effects work nicely, the flood gives us an element that's unusual in action films, and the cast works well together, even when the script gets a tad overblown.The widescreen DVD has a few basic features, but is pretty scant in extras - no deleted scenes, no trailers for other movies, nothing you'd not have seen in the theatre but the trailer for this film - which was a disappointment, but not fatal.All in all, a fun 96 minutes of video, if you're not in the mood for something deep and meaningful.",4,Fun action flick,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1921,"['Yup', 'plot', 'stretch', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'short', 'actually', 'asking', 'hang', 'neck', 'dead', 'story', 'unlikely', 'are', 'obvious', 'plot', 'holes', 'disrupt', 'fun.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'up', 'usual', 'excellence', 'role', 'crook', 'looking', 'retirement', 'fund', 'typical', 'crew', 'help', 'screwup', '20s', 'rowdy', 'unemployed', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'scripture-quoting', 'pro.Christian', 'Slater', 'well', 'Christian', 'Slater', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'years', 'yet', 'appearance', 'wisecracking', 'intrepid', 'guy', 'Mr.', 'Slater', 'so', 'often', ""'d"", 'get', 'repititious', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'end', 'clean', 'banks', ""'re"", 'flooded', 'run', '3', 'million', 'truck', 'when', 'stuck', 'deep', 'spot', 'ever-present', 'water.Minnie', 'Driver', 'fine', 'understated', 'job', 'woman', 'who', 'stayed', 'town', 'too', 'long', 'preparing', 'church', 'been', 'restoring', 'weather', 'flood', 'who', 'involved', 'scramble', 'cash', 'side', 'good', 'guys', 'real', 'steam', 'Slater.Randy', 'Quaid', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 're-election', 'bitter', 'angry', 'determined', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'long', 'clock', 'temptation', 'money', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'him.For', 'film', 'set', 'almost', 'entirely', 'nighttime', 'rain', 'camerawork', 'amazingly', 'good', 'effects', 'work', 'nicely', 'flood', 'element', 'unusual', 'action', 'films', 'cast', 'well', 'together', 'even', 'when', 'script', 'tad', 'overblown.The', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'few', 'basic', 'features', 'pretty', 'scant', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'theatre', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'disappointment', 'not', 'fatal.All', 'fun', '96', 'minutes', 'video', ""'re"", 'not', 'mood', 'something', 'deep', 'meaningful']",Hard Rain VHS

But, the movie is predictable, unrealistic, dumb and has bad acting. Christian Slater's acting was horrible and Morgan Freeman can't save the movie. The plot is neat, in which an armored truck transports a lot of money in a huge flood. But, some crooks hold it up to steal the money. The problem is that the officer in the truck won't let them off so easy and tries to bring the money to where it's supposed to go.I had the movie predicted 10 minutes into it and the movie had no suspense or anything. All it was, was Christian Slater beating everyone up. It had some good chases but besides that and some ok action, it was a bad movie.It's not even worth renting because of its terrible acting, predictability, and basically everything about it.Morgan Freeman is good but this movie degrades him.

But you have to wonder why the studio abandoned it when it took investment from multiple backers to keep the production afloat (pun intended again).I recall seeing publicity shots in 1997 for scenes (and characters) that aren't even in the movie. I guess we'll never know what Graham Yost's script was originally about. Paramount figured that the public had had enough of disaster movies and re-tooled 'The Flood' as a heist flick midway through filming. I can't say if it's for better or worse, but Hard Rain is still an exciting action ride.Yes, the characterization is thin, but it avoids the cliche of making them all annoying as a quick way of defining them (something Twister, Volcano, and Dante's Peak were guilty of). The stragglers caught in the deluge as Huntingburg, Indiana is swept off the face of the Earth don't need to define themselves. They are who they are. Since the movie virtually takes place in real time there's little room for meaningless development.Minnie Driver's unconvincing accent aside, the cast do pretty well with the material, and Slater makes for a better action hero here than he did in Broken Arrow (ironically, by the same writer).Hard Rain works best in the cinema. It's too bad that it flopped because the big screen is where it deserved to be seen. Too many folks have seen and criticized this film from TV viewings that do the scope of the action no justice whatsoever. The water and chaos is very well shot and brilliantly staged. The bouncing, shaking, wobbling camera was an innovative idea, and if you like the slow-motion fire-fights of John Woo movies then you'll get a kick out of Hard Rain.Another strong aspect that has gone overlooked with the rest of the movie is Chris Young's powerful score; the orchestral sound of violence, mayhem, and nature taking over. Seriously, it's great stuff and you really ought to getHard Rain: Music From The Motion Picture.Despite the bad reviews and poor box office returns Hard Rain is still a highly entertaining B-movie. We'll never know the full story behind its trouble production (there hasn't been anything close to a Special Edition DVD, and Mikael Salomon has never spoken publicly about it), but I recommend it to all action movie junkies.

It's just not one of those films! It's filmed in one night (the daytime scenes were cut out), and a lot of the time, you can barely see the characters, due to the darkness of the picture. Normally, I would find that extremely annoying, but for this film, it actually works. So I was very happy when this was put in the DVD player, and it was dark! (And I discovered I can take a reasonable picture on my digital camera in the darkness without someone realising until the flash goes!) Written by the same guy who wrote Speed, Graham Yost (yes, I do shock people when I come out with these interesting little facts - it's only my favourite film!), you know it's gonna be good.I think soon enough I'm definitely going to be in a full blown Christian Slater mood, as I'm going to see him in a play of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest! (He'll be so good as McMurphy) So this'll mean endless re-runs of Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves - I really should get Heathers on DVD.Despite the fact that he's losing his hair at the same rate as Jack Nicholson, he's extremely cute, and he definitely looked a bit of alright in this - was it the uniform that did it for? Or the Bruce Willis-esque white T-shirt?! Nice! And his nice short hair too - don't get me wrong, I like him with the floppy hair he sports in Robin Hood/Heathers, but the shorter the better.Sometimes the characters are very confusing, especially as certain characters constantly switch sides, so you never know who's a goodie, and who's a baddie. But the way Christian & Morgan Freeman's characters eventually end up coming together against an evil, corrupted sherriff (played by Randy Quaid).With all the water, you're instantly reminded of Titanic, and some scenes are extremely similar, although it's not possible, as both films were filmed/released at different times, so just coincidence. Minnie Driver (no doubt following up Kate Winslet's comments) has said she hated filming in all the water, probably for days at a time, and who can blame her? Coming from a non-swimmer (I know it's as easy as riding a bike - oh wait...), this film was sometimes a scary prospect for me to watch, as I put myself in the characters positions, and figured I probably would have freaked out in their (albeit, sometimes unreal) positions.Some of the comic relief (yes there is some) is provided by the nervous old man and his wife, culminating in a hilarious situation in a boat.This is definitely a great film, to watch Christian Slater get wet & wild. And Morgan Freeman plays the same kinda character that he plays in Chain Reaction - you keep waiting for him to pull out the big fat cigar. Highly recommended. So glad I watched this.

444331,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305017271,Reviewer,"[0, 8]","There's action, water (plenty of water), gun play, more action, actors from the ""A"" list (Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver), one from the ""B"" list (Randy Quaid) and the ""star"" of it all, Christian Slater; ""It"" being none other than ""Hard Rain,"" an ""action/thriller"" written by Graham Yost and directed by Mikael Salomon.  Going in, it would seem that it has all the elements required of a film of this genre to succeed.  Going out, one must pause to reflect and wonder:  How did this movie ever see the light of day?  How did it even get made?  Better yet, why?  For anyone unlucky enough to have suffered through this muddle in a theater, the only ""thrill"" would've been finally being able to leave when it was over.  One of the blessings of video is that it adds to one's options; in this case, being able to TURN IT OFF and cut your losses.  The trouble begins with the screenplay by Yost (who as a writer is responsible for a number of decent, exciting movies, including ""Speed, ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Mission To Mars""), whose concept here is suspect from the start.  In the middle of a flood, which quickly renders everyone practically immobile (almost immediately every character is up to their waist in water), four men planning to rob an armored car continue on as if their feet are still on dry ground; and it's only the beginning of a plot that stretches credibility just too far.  As it plods along (I should say ""slogs"" along), even suspending disbelief will not work here; sure, this is an action flick and you have to accept what you're given to a certain extent.  But here we're to believe, for instance,  that no less than six lifelong law-abiding, decent citizens suddenly become murderers and thieves, two with some premeditation, four at the drop of a hat.  It just doesn't wash, by anyone's measuring stick.  Soon frames of reference begin to cloud and merge, which creates an even more ambiguous reality; halfway through this movie you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys without a scorecard.  And, as if to make sure that none of this can be taken with even a grain of salt, the dialogue is so bad it must be the stuff of which an actor's worst nightmares are born.  Better they should have no lines to say than be saddled with this inane prattle.  At least when the story picks up the town has already been evacuated, except for the Sheriff and three or four officers and a utility worker, and of course the obligatory (in this case three) others who refuse to leave.  This is a positive note, however.  Fewer characters means fewer occasions for banal utterances.  The crushing blow is delivered, however, by director Salomon, whose lack of imagination renders this film D.O.A.  And he should have seen it coming; it's his job to know what works and what doesn't.  He's the one with the placard that says ""The Buck Stops Here.""  The real shame of this debacle, though, is the waste of such talent as Freeman and Driver, especially, and even Quaid and Slater.  They deserve better.  To their credit, they all did as much as was humanly possible with the material with which they were given to work.  This is one of those projects that must have looked good on paper, but somewhere in the execution went south.  And apparently very quickly.  The supporting cast includes Edward Asner (Uncle Charlie), Michael A. Goorjian (Kenny), Richard A. Dysart (Henry), Betty White (Doreen) and Mark Rolston (Wayne).  On the positive side, ""Hard Rain"" does have some decent special F/X.  But the best thing about this movie is the fact that it makes one appreciate a really good film, the kind we've come to expect from the people involved with this one.  It makes you appreciate Schwarzenegger.  It even makes you appreciate Van Damme.  Then again, this isn't the first time that actors of this caliber have been entangled with a movie this bad.  In fact, if you listen closely you can almost hear Michael Caine off somewhere chuckling and whispering ""Jaws 4"" to himself in a quiet aside.",1,Somebody Get Arnold!,975974400,"12 5, 2000",2000,3999,"['action', 'water', 'plenty', 'water', 'gun', 'play', 'more', 'action', 'actors', 'A', 'list', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'one', 'B', 'list', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'star', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'being', 'none', 'other', 'Hard', 'Rain', 'action/thriller', 'written', 'Graham', 'Yost', 'directed', 'Mikael', 'Salomon', 'Going', 'would', 'seem', 'elements', 'required', 'film', 'genre', 'succeed', 'Going', 'out', 'one', 'must', 'pause', 'reflect', 'wonder', 'How', 'did', 'movie', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'How', 'did', 'even', 'get', 'made', 'Better', 'yet', 'why', 'anyone', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'have', 'suffered', 'muddle', 'theater', 'only', 'thrill', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'leave', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'One', 'blessings', 'video', 'one', 'options', 'case', 'being', 'able', 'TURN', 'IT', 'OFF', 'cut', 'losses', 'trouble', 'screenplay', 'Yost', 'who', 'writer', 'responsible', 'number', 'decent', 'exciting', 'movies', 'including', 'Speed', 'Broken', 'Arrow', 'Mission', 'Mars', 'concept', 'here', 'suspect', 'start', 'middle', 'flood', 'quickly', 'everyone', 'practically', 'immobile', 'almost', 'immediately', 'character', 'waist', 'water', 'four', 'men', 'planning', 'rob', 'armored', 'car', 'continue', 'feet', 'are', 'still', 'dry', 'ground', 'only', 'beginning', 'plot', 'credibility', 'just', 'too', 'far', 'should', 'say', 'slogs', 'along', 'even', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'here', 'sure', 'action', 'flick', 'have', 'accept', 'what', ""'re"", 'given', 'certain', 'extent', 'here', ""'re"", 'believe', 'instance', 'less', 'six', 'lifelong', 'law-abiding', 'decent', 'citizens', 'suddenly', 'become', 'murderers', 'thieves', 'two', 'premeditation', 'four', 'drop', 'hat', 'just', ""n't"", 'wash', 'anyone', 'measuring', 'stick', 'Soon', 'frames', 'reference', 'begin', 'cloud', 'merge', 'even', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'reality', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'scorecard', 'make', 'sure', 'none', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'even', 'grain', 'salt', 'dialogue', 'so', 'bad', 'must', 'be', 'stuff', 'actor', 'worst', 'nightmares', 'are', 'born', 'Better', 'should', 'have', 'lines', 'say', 'be', 'saddled', 'inane', 'prattle', 'least', 'when', 'story', 'up', 'town', 'already', 'been', 'evacuated', 'Sheriff', 'three', 'four', 'officers', 'utility', 'worker', 'course', 'obligatory', 'case', 'three', 'others', 'who', 'refuse', 'leave', 'positive', 'note', 'however', 'Fewer', 'characters', 'fewer', 'occasions', 'banal', 'utterances', 'crushing', 'blow', 'delivered', 'however', 'director', 'Salomon', 'lack', 'imagination', 'renders', 'film', 'D.O.A', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'job', 'know', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'one', 'placard', 'Buck', 'Stops', 'Here', 'real', 'shame', 'debacle', 'waste', 'such', 'talent', 'Freeman', 'Driver', 'especially', 'even', 'Quaid', 'Slater', 'deserve', 'better', 'credit', 'did', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'humanly', 'possible', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'work', 'one', 'projects', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'good', 'paper', 'somewhere', 'execution', 'went', 'south', 'apparently', 'very', 'quickly', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'Uncle', 'Charlie', 'Michael', 'A.', 'Goorjian', 'Kenny', 'Richard', 'A.', 'Dysart', 'Henry', 'Betty', 'White', 'Doreen', 'Mark', 'Rolston', 'Wayne', 'positive', 'side', 'Hard', 'Rain', 'have', 'decent', 'special', 'F/X', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'fact', 'one', 'appreciate', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'people', 'involved', 'one', 'appreciate', 'Schwarzenegger', 'even', 'appreciate', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Then', 'again', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'actors', 'caliber', 'have', 'been', 'entangled', 'movie', 'bad', 'fact', 'listen', 'closely', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'somewhere', 'chuckling', 'whispering', 'Jaws', '4', 'quiet', 'aside']",Hard Rain VHS

The cast is pretty good and Christian  Slater gives a good performance as does the unfathomable Morgan Freeman of  course.

So, their truck is loaded with about three million Dollars. Hank tries to prevent further flooding, as he's the guy responsible for the dam up the river, but he has to open one gate in order to save the old dam from breaking. Only the police under the Sheriff's leadership stay in town to prevent looting. As the water level rises, Tom and Charlie's Truck gets stuck in the flooded road.

But as the Sheriff finds out about that much cash in a situation like this, he radios his old pal Hank, up at the dam. This is a highly recommended movie.
