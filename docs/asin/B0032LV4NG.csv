There was no language, violence, drugs or drinking.  There was cleavage and kissing and two people speak of the pain of divorce; a boy's dad who is divorced from the boy's mother is supposed to visit him but bails out and the boy is hurt.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for all ages.I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and then bought the DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.I really enjoyed how after Jarod wrote to Vince in Bosnia (the first letter since his wife left him over two years ago) Vince really takes to the boy and when he returns home seeks him out and offers to help him play baseball.  Jared takes to Vince immediately, since Jarod's own father can't bother to call or come see his son.  Vince and Dana, Jarod's Mom, are immediately attracted to one another and as this new &#34;family&#34; draws together and Vince gets his orders to be deployed, Jarod helps his Mom and Vince realize that instead of breaking up they would be happier if they stayed together, because then she would know that he would be coming back to her and he would have someone to go back to.It was a very good show, and the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star was because I couldn't completely get into the story because I can't imagine having to send someone off to war and not see them for a year or more.  The ending was a little sad having to send him off.  However, I like how it shows the need for a family and how love can make a big difference.  It brings in the need to trust in God and that he has a plan for you.  And it didn't need to bring in anything immoral.

1319055,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0032LV4NG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","This 2010 made-for-television movie presents no swerves to disconcert you, no offensive material to sully your senses. It's a Hallmark product, so you know where you stand, you soft touch, you. MEET MY MOM (also known as SOLDIER LOVE STORY) is wholesome, is family oriented and is pretty entertaining. The two leads have something to do with this.Stationed in Bosnia on a peacekeeping mission, U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Vincent Carrera (Johnny Messner) is often ribbed by his fellow grunts for being always the odd man out during mail call. But then, one day, Vince's name is hailed and he curiously tears open the envelope. He proceeds to read a letter from some kid he had never met, corresponding with him on behest of a class assignment. Still, Vince is touched. And when his Bosnian tour is up and he returns stateside on leave to his home base of Fort Sebastian, California, he decides on a whim to drive over and drop in on the kid. And when I make mention that the kid's mom is a lovely recent divorcee and played by Lori Loughlin, well, you don't need a crystal ball to see where this is going.37-year-old Dana Marshall (Loughlin) is still settling in from the big move from Iowa to California and into her mom's (Stefanie Powers) house. Dana's been fretting about her unhappy 10-year-old son, Jared (Charles Henry Wyson), who still pines for his absentee dad. When the sergeant becomes a regular fixture and a mentor to Jared, Dana feels the sparks. But she's cautious. Dana is concerned for herself but even more for her son. She's fearful that a relationship with Vince could only have harmful repercussions, seeing as how he's expecting an imminent deployment overseas, which would leave Jared once more without a father figure. Okay, this, to me, is a silly conflict, but maybe it's because I'm more of the ""Life is short; take a risk"" persuasion. I had to double check to make sure this movie was playing on the Hallmark Channel. I wanted a guarantee of a happy ending. But did this movie get the happy ending? Um...You should see this one, see it with the fam. Sure, it's got a low-keyed rhythm, but it's still quite a pleasant watch. It doesn't insult your intelligence by being either too goofy or saccharine sweet. There are little moments that come off as genuine and that build up those connections between the sergeant and the Marshall family, all of them once lonely souls. As an ex-serviceman, I'm glad for those moments that give the viewer a peek into how tight-knit a community the military families are. I loved it that Vince introduced Dana and Jared to his military buds who then warmly embraced them as their own. The film is worth it alone for Loughlin and Messner's warm performances. Almost as much fun, though, is the father-son interplay between Messner and the kid actor Charles Henry Wyson. It's cool seeing Wyson's character go from awkward, insecure boy who couldn't throw a lick to confident starting catcher of his school's baseball team.But a parting nitpick: In that kitchen scene, Lori Loughlin has sure got that fake keyboard typing down.

I can't tell you how many times I have seen it and never get tired ofwatching.  The story of love that comes unexpectantly to two very deserving people is soheart warming.  No sex or violence. A little splash of faith, just enough to let the viewer know people still believe and teach their children to trust.  This love story is so rare in this day.  I too, like another reviewer, wish there could be a sequel. Thecontinuation of a life with so much love and respect for each other.  Vince having to leave Dana and Jared when he has finally found the woman and yes, the son, he wants to spend the rest of his life with. The fact that they could part for a year without marriage or consummation of their relationship of a sexual nature made this more endearing to me. As I said, love and respect.  The movie did get me to thinking about the many soldiers who are serving abroad and have no one to write to them.  Perhaps the people reading this might find out how to correspond with one of them.  It doesn't have to end in a love story but would be so nice to have a friendship come about.  I'm going to start on that myself.  My son was a disabled veteran and passed away two years ago. I'll do it in his memory. Watch this movie.  I guarantee you will not regret it. You'll get hooked too. May I add something please.  Someone who reviewed this commented on the southern dialect of Vince.  Remember he said his daddy worked on oil rigs.  That's Gulf coast territory.  Southern accents are a little more pronounced.

1319110,A3LNU3T5H9OMWC,B0032LV4NG,P. Romance,"[4, 4]","After her divorce, Dana Marshall with her son, Jared, moved to California to live with her mother.  As part of a school project, Jared was to write a letter to a soldier.  His soldier was Sergeant Vince Carrerra.  After returning from Bosnia on leave, he decided to pay Jared a visit.  But the first person he meet was Jared's mother and something sparked between them.  However, due to past experiences, military and marriage don't mix.  Can Vince and Dana overcome this when he has to leave again?This is the kind of romance that I would love to have.  I found it endearing that instead of focusing on sex, the story revolved around love and emotional aspects of a relationship.  Through the good and the bad, they supported each other and slowly, released all the old baggage of their old relationships.  There was no pretense.  Sgt. Vince Carrera, played by Johnny Messner, was a major sweetheart and so sincere.  I wish there was more guys like him in the world.  However, I wasn't a big fan of his accent.  It grated on my nerves at times.  Dana Marshall, played by Lori Loughlin, was an inspiration for keeping her life on track after her divorce.  The acting was well done and the chemistry of the main characters was plain to see right from the start.  I found their courtship charming, sweet and kind of funny at times.  For example, when he first asked her out and she cleverly avoided his kiss was absolutely cute.  The supporting cast was simply just as important and amazing in their roles.  Another aspect I liked was the slight inspirational overtones at the beginning, like things happen for a reason and not all new experiences are bad ones.  The only thing that bothered me was that I found the ending to be incomplete.  That's why I couldn't give it 5 stars despite how much I like the movie.  The ending is always important to me, whether in movie or romance novel.  I know it's campy, but I like an assuredness that they are officially together.  But don't let it turn you off.  The ending does wrap up all loose ends.I would recommend this to anyone who loves sweet, uncomplicated movies, read romance novels or love an inspirational film.  This is a clean, wholesome movie that is perfect for the whole family.",4,Love This Soldier's Love Story,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,2234,"['divorce', 'Dana', 'Marshall', 'son', 'Jared', 'moved', 'California', 'live', 'mother', 'part', 'school', 'project', 'Jared', 'was', 'write', 'letter', 'soldier', 'soldier', 'was', 'Sergeant', 'Vince', 'Carrerra', 'returning', 'Bosnia', 'leave', 'decided', 'pay', 'Jared', 'visit', 'first', 'person', 'meet', 'was', 'Jared', 'mother', 'something', 'sparked', 'However', 'due', 'past', 'experiences', 'military', 'marriage', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'Can', 'Vince', 'Dana', 'overcome', 'when', 'leave', 'again', 'kind', 'romance', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'found', 'endearing', 'instead', 'focusing', 'sex', 'story', 'revolved', 'love', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'good', 'bad', 'supported', 'other', 'slowly', 'released', 'old', 'baggage', 'old', 'relationships', 'was', 'pretense', 'Sgt', 'Vince', 'Carrera', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Messner', 'was', 'major', 'sweetheart', 'so', 'sincere', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'guys', 'world', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'accent', 'grated', 'nerves', 'times', 'Dana', 'Marshall', 'played', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'was', 'inspiration', 'keeping', 'life', 'track', 'divorce', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'plain', 'see', 'right', 'start', 'found', 'courtship', 'charming', 'sweet', 'kind', 'funny', 'times', 'example', 'when', 'first', 'asked', 'out', 'cleverly', 'avoided', 'kiss', 'was', 'absolutely', 'cute', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'simply', 'just', 'important', 'amazing', 'roles', 'aspect', 'liked', 'was', 'slight', 'inspirational', 'overtones', 'beginning', 'things', 'happen', 'reason', 'not', 'new', 'experiences', 'are', 'bad', 'ones', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'found', 'ending', 'be', 'incomplete', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'how', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'ending', 'always', 'important', 'movie', 'romance', 'novel', 'know', 'campy', 'like', 'assuredness', 'are', 'officially', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'turn', 'off', 'ending', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'sweet', 'uncomplicated', 'movies', 'read', 'romance', 'novels', 'love', 'inspirational', 'film', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'perfect', 'whole', 'family']",Soldier Love Story

Seldom do movies outline the personal life of our armed forces.  ""Soldier Love Story"" fills that need.In ""Soldier Love Story"" Lori Loughlin plays Dana Marshall, a young professional and single parent who went through a divorce and has custody of her 10 yr old son, Jared.  Starting their new life, they move 1600 miles from the only home Jared has ever known.Dana and Jared Marshall  move in with Dana's mother played by Stephanie Powers.  For a school assignment Jared writes to Sergeant Vince Carerra (played by Johnny Messner).  Sergeant Carerra writes the boy back and a positive relationship flowers.During Sargent Carerra's leave he meets Jared and coaches him in baseball.Jared is a ten year old boy whose dad doesn't even remember his birthday, so the Sergeant's attention helps the boy's self esteem, and catches the mother's attention.Vince and Dana start to fall in love but since Vince is going to deploy and lost his wife on his last deployment, they consider just being friends.  The threat to this budding family seems to be the tendency of the military to deploy to foreign lands without considering  the family.  ""Soldier Love Story"" shows a healthy way families may survive separation.The Soldier Love Story"" presents a slice of life that military families know well.
