526366,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,B00003CXIF,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Dont get this confused with another movie of the same title released in the early 90s', although it was in slightly the same catagory 2000's 'Where the Heart Is' stands alone. Who could've seen a movie like this coming?...well obviously the few powerhouse actors/actresses who gave small parts in this unique story. Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd and Stockard Channing take center stage among fresh faces like Dylan Bruno (Willie Jack Pickins) and James Frain (Forney Hull)..who took substantial co-staring roles. Without getting too in-depth about the film, the movie centers around two stories that seem to merge in meaning towards the end. On one stage, shy and sweet Novalee Nation (Portman) is a teenager who finds herself pregnant by a country-bumpkin troublemaker (Dylan Bruno) and left abandoned and alone to fend for herself before having the baby (an interesting twist giving her secret lodgings in a rural Wal-Mart where she works.) She is taken in by a religious and thoughtful middle-aged couple (Stockard Channing as 'Sister Husband'), and raises her baby girl while pursuing a love of photography. Now, on the other stage..Dylan Bruno is an aspiring country music singer with guitar-in-hand. Dirty and broke, he wanders into a small-time record producing company and is taken under the wing of producer Ruth Meyers (Call her Ruth Meyers)..a small part beautifully done by my favorite actress the lovely Joan Cusack. Bruno releases one song 'The Beat of a Heart', and falls harder to rock bottom than a heroin addict. The movie does a fantastic job of moving through 5 years in a few hours..with an upbeat and enlightening story, a dedicated cast and even a great country/contemporary soundtrack. 'Where the Heart Is' isn't a blind title, you'll see why it was used when the two stories of these heart-warming characters who've suffered losses and hard times, lost friends and found love collide (Well, not collide. This isn't an action movie.) I was raised among movies like 'Terminator', 'Predator', 'Bloodsport' and 'One Crazy Summer'...Joan Cusack as a cast member is what brought me to watch this romantic comedy, and if I can say that this is one of the best movies Ive ever seen, I think it should most definately work for a more devoted fan to romantic comedies. For Ashley Judd fans..yes, this is a big part for her. A little bit of something for everyone looking for laughs, happy endings and maybe a few tears. 'Where the Heart Is' is a perfect summer evening flick, by far one of the most well done movies of the genre I've seen yet. A sure sale for fans of 'Someone Like You' (Ashley Judd, Greg Kinear) and 'You've Got Mail' (Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan).",5,Where the Good Movie Is....Here.,1019952000,"04 28, 2002",2002,2672,"['Dont', 'get', 'confused', 'movie', 'same', 'title', 'released', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'slightly', 'same', 'catagory', '2000', 'Heart', 'Is', 'stands', 'alone', 'Who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'coming', 'well', 'obviously', 'few', 'powerhouse', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'gave', 'small', 'parts', 'unique', 'story', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'fresh', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'Willie', 'Jack', 'Pickins', 'James', 'Frain', 'Forney', 'Hull', '..who', 'took', 'substantial', 'co-staring', 'roles', 'getting', 'too', 'in-depth', 'film', 'movie', 'centers', 'two', 'stories', 'seem', 'merge', 'meaning', 'end', 'one', 'stage', 'shy', 'sweet', 'Novalee', 'Nation', 'Portman', 'teenager', 'who', 'pregnant', 'country-bumpkin', 'troublemaker', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'left', 'abandoned', 'alone', 'fend', 'having', 'baby', 'interesting', 'twist', 'giving', 'secret', 'lodgings', 'rural', 'Wal-Mart', 'where', 'taken', 'religious', 'thoughtful', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'Stockard', 'Channing', ""'Sister"", 'Husband', 'baby', 'girl', 'pursuing', 'love', 'photography', 'Now', 'other', 'stage..Dylan', 'Bruno', 'aspiring', 'country', 'music', 'singer', 'guitar-in-hand', 'Dirty', 'broke', 'small-time', 'record', 'producing', 'company', 'taken', 'wing', 'producer', 'Ruth', 'Meyers', 'Call', 'Ruth', 'Meyers', '..a', 'small', 'part', 'beautifully', 'done', 'favorite', 'actress', 'lovely', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Bruno', 'one', 'song', 'Beat', 'Heart', 'harder', 'rock', 'bottom', 'heroin', 'addict', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'job', 'moving', '5', 'years', 'few', 'hours..with', 'upbeat', 'enlightening', 'story', 'dedicated', 'cast', 'even', 'great', 'country/contemporary', 'soundtrack', 'Heart', 'Is', ""n't"", 'blind', 'title', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'was', 'used', 'when', 'two', 'stories', 'heart-warming', 'characters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'losses', 'hard', 'times', 'lost', 'friends', 'found', 'collide', 'Well', 'not', 'collide', ""n't"", 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'raised', 'movies', ""'Terminator"", ""'Predator"", ""'Bloodsport"", ""'One"", 'Crazy', 'Summer', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'cast', 'member', 'what', 'brought', 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'Ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'should', 'most', 'definately', 'work', 'more', 'devoted', 'fan', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'fans..yes', 'big', 'part', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'everyone', 'looking', 'laughs', 'happy', 'endings', 'maybe', 'few', 'tears', 'Heart', 'Is', 'perfect', 'summer', 'evening', 'flick', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'done', 'movies', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'sure', 'sale', 'fans', ""'Someone"", 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Greg', 'Kinear', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Meg', 'Ryan']",Where the Heart Is VHS

526371,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXIF,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","This film surely packs a lot into a little package, and it does so with enough gusto that you almost forget how preposterous it all is in the first place.  I think what makes this film so likable is the cast.  The story is interesting yet ridiculous, and the overall generic vibe of the film is a tad clich&eacute;d and `been there done that' but the fun filled cast make it all worth it in the end.I couldn't watch this any day of the week, but when I'm in the mood this one does the trick.Novalee Nation is pregnant and has a dead-end boyfriend (who dreams of being a rock star).  When he leaves her stranded she finds herself living in Wal-Mart until she finally gives birth (IN THE STORE) and winds up finding herself a new life with a spunky and soulful nurse named Lexie and a sweetly attentive man named Forney.Like I said, the storyline itself is sweet and endering at moments, but it is nothing spectacular.  I do like the whole ""Wal-Mart baby' idea, but the film does honestly go too far at times to try and be unique and it winds up being a hinderance as apposed to a blessing.What is a blessing though, is the actors here.  From Natalie Portman's star making turn as Novalee to Joan Cusack's scene stealing comedic timing and Ashley Judd's charming charisma (and let's not forget that lovable loaf known as James Frain), `Where the Heart Is' is bursting at the seems with actorly reasons to adore this film.  Like I mentioned, this film kind of lives and dies with the actors.  Everyone involved is on top of their game here, and it makes for a lovely ride.These actors help forgive the film all of its missteps.So, in the end, I really like this one.  Yes, I'm giving it a C+, but that's a recommended C+.  The film does meander on stupid at times, but that's okay when you consider that this is merely here to entertain (and it does that).",3,Sweet...,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,1853,"['film', 'surely', 'lot', 'little', 'package', 'so', 'enough', 'gusto', 'almost', 'forget', 'how', 'preposterous', 'first', 'place', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'likable', 'cast', 'story', 'interesting', 'yet', 'ridiculous', 'overall', 'generic', 'vibe', 'film', 'tad', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'fun', 'filled', 'cast', 'make', 'end.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'day', 'week', 'when', ""'m"", 'mood', 'one', 'trick.Novalee', 'Nation', 'pregnant', 'dead-end', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'being', 'rock', 'star', 'When', 'stranded', 'living', 'Wal-Mart', 'finally', 'birth', 'THE', 'STORE', 'up', 'finding', 'new', 'life', 'spunky', 'soulful', 'nurse', 'named', 'Lexie', 'sweetly', 'attentive', 'man', 'named', 'Forney.Like', 'said', 'storyline', 'sweet', 'endering', 'moments', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'do', 'whole', 'Wal-Mart', 'baby', 'idea', 'film', 'honestly', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'times', 'try', 'be', 'unique', 'up', 'being', 'hinderance', 'apposed', 'blessing.What', 'blessing', 'actors', 'here', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'star', 'making', 'turn', 'Novalee', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'scene', 'stealing', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'charming', 'charisma', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'lovable', 'loaf', 'known', 'James', 'Frain', 'Where', 'Heart', 'Is', 'bursting', 'actorly', 'reasons', 'adore', 'film', 'mentioned', 'film', 'kind', 'lives', 'dies', 'actors', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'top', 'game', 'here', 'lovely', 'ride.These', 'actors', 'help', 'forgive', 'film', 'missteps.So', 'end', 'really', 'one', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'giving', 'C+', 'recommended', 'C+', 'film', 'meander', 'stupid', 'times', 'okay', 'when', 'consider', 'merely', 'here', 'entertain']",Where the Heart Is VHS

I was ready for a typical girl-power type movie--the downtrodden, hapless (but innocent at heart) girl who, in the end, is successful beyond belief (after learning some valuable lessons, of course), overcomes enormous obstacles, and finally finds a good man in the midst of the sea of male pigs.  Oh, and let's not forget the evil boyfriend or husband that, somehow, gets the bad stuff he deserves.This movie contained all of those elements, but exaggerated to the extreme.  Novalee (Natalie Portman) is the &quot;Wal-Mart Mom&quot;-- meaning she has her baby inside a Wal-Mart after her boyfriend abandons her.  From then on, its one bad thing after another.  In the space of two short hours, Novalee loses friends, has her daughter kidnapped, has a friend beat up and abused, and encounters a score of other huge difficulties, which in the end serve to empower and strengthen her.  Novalee and her friend (Ashley Judd) somehow manage to get knocked up by EVERY dirtball/sleazebag man in Oklahoma, and continuously have horrible experiences with men they thought were perfect.  Yet they never learn (at least, Judd doesn't).All in all, this is a 'chick-flick' not worth anyone's time.

526378,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00003CXIF,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","if you are reading this, you probably already know that this story revolves around Natalie Portman. She is a young pregnant woman who is suddenly abandoned by her boyfriend Willy Jack. (We later learn that he was just scared, though the line of indecency has certainly been crossed!) You'll probably notice right away that the film takes shots at men in general.Having nowhere to go, Portman takes sanctuary in Walmart. (Why not? They sell everything, and she is able to make herself a bed, and borrow the food she needs. And in all fairness to her character, she documents everything she takes with the intention to pay it back.)We also meet James Frain. (The local librarian who takes care of his ill sister.) At the time of delivery, it is the eccentric, but benevolent Frain who saves Portman.(We can probably guess that Frain is spared from the male bashing in this film because he is eccentric and doesn't think in sterotyped male ways.)Moving on, Portman meets Judd who will becomeher best friend. Portman's mother shows up just long enough to run away with what little money Portman has. (Sociopathic mother!)Well, with nowhere to go, Portman gradually finds kindness in the area including the strange and kind 'Sister.' As a church goer, I was somewhat offended by the way the church goers were portrayed. But moving forward, Willy Jack hooks up with Joan Cusackand starts his musical career. It doesn't move as fast as he would like it to, but he does make some progress. Moving on, Portman goes on to be a photographer, and her relationship with Frain continues to grow. Her 'Sister' friend has a tragic death. She of course leaves her money to Portman. In a disturbing moment, portman's friend Judd is assaulted. (A sad truthful danger on the risk of getting involved with someone without really knowing them!)Portman starts to fear that she is holding Frain back. Willy Jack has some bad luck when the authorship of his hit is disputed. Another problem I have with this film is that even if the authorship of this song was disputed, 5 YEARS HAVE PASSED! Certainly, he would have written more songs, and put some money away! After losing everything, he has a tragic mishap.

Miller ""Knitter and bookworm""","[1, 1]","As someone who cringes at films hailed as &quot;Heartwarming!&quot;, I initially shied away from this picture, but on a particularly bad day, I needed some cheering up so I rented it, and was pleasantly surprised that my mood changed.  However, when I started to think about this film a little more in depth, I realized it isn't just a lighthearted piece of fluff about the misadventures of an uneducated, naive girl who happens upon some damn good luck in her life.  &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; attempts to tackle some very serious issues, such as teen pregnancy, absent fathers, mental illness, and child abuse.  Yet like the rest of the story, and most of the characters, it barely skims the surface, just touching on them before glossing it over with a layer of sweetness and light.  Perhaps that's why it lifted my spirits: it never got bogged down with the serious issues, and continued blithely along with Novalee and Americus, her cute little girl with the horrid name.&quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; is first and foremost a fairy tale.  Rarely does a teenage mother without the support of a husband/boyfriend/girlfried/what-have-you experience the good fortune of meeting compassionate individuals offering food, shelter, and means to an income, as well as the veritable knight in a stocking cap, who not only manages to deliver the baby, but falls in love with her as well.

526395,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXIF,D. Litton,"[2, 2]","&quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; is one hell of a movie; that's all I can say about it. Most critics did not care for the storyline's tendency to jump in between plotlines numerous times, but I found it very easy to follow, and very humorous and heartfelt as well. The acting talent for the movie is superb, the best I've seen in a film like this. And the story will have you have you laughing and leave you touched.Novalee Nation is about to embark on another journey, this one being with her boyfriend, who is also the father of her baby. She has never really had a family life, and her willingness to create a family for her unborn child blinds her to the mistreatment of her boyfriend. While on the road, they stop at a Wal-Mart so she can use the bathroom and buy a new pair of shoes. When she comes out, her boyfriend is gone, and she is left with nothing but a pair of shoes, the change from her purchase, and her Polaroid camera. Stuck without a place to go, she hides out in the Wal-Mart, living there during the night and keeping a journal of the things she uses so she can pay back the store. She begins meeting the people around town, one being Sister Husband, who immediately takes a liking to Novalee and her unborn child. Novalee also meets Forney, the local librarian who also cares for his insane ill sister. That same nigh, Novalee gives birth to her baby, and becomes famed for giving birth to the &quot;Wal-Mart Baby.&quot; While in the hospital, she meets up with Lexie, who has four of her own children. Novalee soon finds security amongst her new friends, and learns that life is what you make it out to be.Not having read the novel by Billie Letts on which the movie is based, I cannot make an honest comparison of the two. But I feel that the movie is terrific still, regardless of its differences from the book. The story does take a lot of little twists and turns, but they're not so big that you need to pay so much attention to them in order to grasp the changes at hand going on in Novalee's life. The way in which everything falls into place is very touching and heartfelt, especially in the beginning third of the film. The audience truly feels sorry for Novalee as she is left alone at the Wal-Mart to fend for herself.The cast of this movie shines like a lantern on a foggy night. There has never been a better ensemble of actors to play such emotional characters in any movie I've ever seen. Natalie Portman makes a huge splash as Novalee, and her sweet sense of manners and Southern lilt all work in conveying her charming nature.

526407,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXIF,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 3]","This film is a bittersweet human-interest story with a side order of romance.  The story has a country flavor, plenty of country music and a story that could serve as the film version of the typical lyrics of any country music CD.  It is replete with bad decisions, bad luck and tragedies at every turn.  It is sappy, corny, stereotypical, and unfortunately full of the types of things that really happen in rural America.  Despite this seething despondency, it has an upbeat fatalism that suggests that at least for some of the people, the struggle against bad breaks and hard times pays off.The story follows the life of Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), poor young girl setting out to start a new life with her no account boyfriend.  When Novalee makes a rest stop at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, he ditches her, literally leaving her there barefoot and pregnant.  Having only five dollars to her name, she takes up residence in the Wal-Mart and ultimately has the baby there.  She becomes a minor celebrity and she is adopted by the Welcome Wagon lady.  The remainder of the film examines the various relationships and experiences she has in this small town over the next seven or eight years.The story is charming and steeped in sentiment.  The character development of Novalee is excellent, although Director Matt Williams could have spent more time on some of the supporting characters, especially Sister Husband (Stockard Channing).  To his credit, the film was nicely shot, and the tornado scene was fabulous.Natalie Portman's performance was her best to date.  She played the part with a near helpless determination that made her a very attractive and lovable character.  Her southern accent was terrible, but her portrayal of the rural southern attitude was on target.  Though the part didn't have a lot of range, she was extremely effective with the emotional element, and elicited great sympathy and admiration for her response to her desperate situation.Stockard Channing was wonderful as the eccentric Welcome Wagon lady.  I would have liked to see this part expanded, just to see more of Channing.  She was enchantingly warm and peculiar.  James Frain was also very good as Forney.  He made the character very interesting and affable.  He continues to be a solid supporting actor who has shown himself to be extremely versatile (Hilary and Jackie, Reindeer Games, Titus).  Ashley Judd added another fine performance to her resume, with a free spirited portrayal of Lexie.This was a nice story with an agreeable and upbeat ending.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you are a woman or if you have ever lived in a mobile home.  It will find its most enthusiastic audience with women due to its extreme sentimentality, but it is not so ""female"" that it can't be enjoyed by men, making it a good date movie.",4,An enchanting human interest story,971740800,"10 17, 2000",2000,2815,"['film', 'bittersweet', 'human-interest', 'story', 'side', 'order', 'romance', 'story', 'country', 'flavor', 'plenty', 'country', 'music', 'story', 'could', 'serve', 'film', 'version', 'typical', 'lyrics', 'country', 'music', 'CD', 'replete', 'bad', 'decisions', 'bad', 'luck', 'tragedies', 'turn', 'sappy', 'corny', 'stereotypical', 'unfortunately', 'full', 'types', 'things', 'really', 'happen', 'rural', 'America', 'seething', 'despondency', 'upbeat', 'fatalism', 'least', 'people', 'struggle', 'bad', 'breaks', 'hard', 'times', 'pays', 'off.The', 'story', 'life', 'Novalee', 'Nation', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'poor', 'young', 'girl', 'setting', 'out', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'account', 'boyfriend', 'When', 'Novalee', 'rest', 'stop', 'Wal-Mart', 'Oklahoma', 'literally', 'leaving', 'barefoot', 'pregnant', 'Having', 'only', 'five', 'dollars', 'name', 'up', 'residence', 'Wal-Mart', 'ultimately', 'baby', 'there', 'minor', 'celebrity', 'adopted', 'Welcome', 'Wagon', 'lady', 'remainder', 'film', 'various', 'relationships', 'experiences', 'small', 'town', 'next', 'seven', 'eight', 'years.The', 'story', 'charming', 'steeped', 'sentiment', 'character', 'development', 'Novalee', 'excellent', 'Director', 'Matt', 'Williams', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'supporting', 'characters', 'especially', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'credit', 'film', 'was', 'nicely', 'shot', 'tornado', 'scene', 'was', 'fabulous.Natalie', 'Portman', 'performance', 'was', 'best', 'date', 'played', 'part', 'near', 'helpless', 'determination', 'made', 'very', 'attractive', 'lovable', 'character', 'southern', 'accent', 'was', 'terrible', 'portrayal', 'rural', 'southern', 'attitude', 'was', 'target', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'range', 'was', 'extremely', 'effective', 'emotional', 'element', 'elicited', 'great', 'sympathy', 'admiration', 'response', 'desperate', 'situation.Stockard', 'Channing', 'was', 'wonderful', 'eccentric', 'Welcome', 'Wagon', 'lady', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'part', 'expanded', 'just', 'see', 'more', 'Channing', 'was', 'enchantingly', 'warm', 'peculiar', 'James', 'Frain', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Forney', 'made', 'character', 'very', 'interesting', 'affable', 'be', 'solid', 'supporting', 'actor', 'who', 'shown', 'be', 'extremely', 'versatile', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'Reindeer', 'Games', 'Titus', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'added', 'fine', 'performance', 'resume', 'free', 'spirited', 'portrayal', 'Lexie.This', 'was', 'nice', 'story', 'agreeable', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'rated', '7/10', 'Add', 'point', 'are', 'woman', 'have', 'ever', 'lived', 'mobile', 'home', 'will', 'find', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'audience', 'women', 'due', 'extreme', 'sentimentality', 'not', 'so', 'female', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'enjoyed', 'men', 'making', 'good', 'date', 'movie']",Where the Heart Is VHS

And, it is one of the most heartwarming, feel good movies I have seen in quite some time.Natalie Portman is excellent as Novalee Nation, the girl who has the Walmart baby. While you know what is going to happen, the actions leading up to the moment are a gem. Keeping a very exacting record of what she owes the Walmart adds to the situation, making you like Novalee even more.Of course, this is a film about the downtrodden. Novalee is in her situation due to her no good boyfriend dumping her on his way to a Country Music career. The rest of the characters in the film share in this misery. From Forney Hall, a brilliant dreamer stuck in a library to Sister Husband (Stockhard Channing), who fornicates a lot, and finally Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), who has too many children by bad men, the humanity of the &quot;lower rungs&quot; of society shines through.Contrasted to the majority of films that highlight lower income families, displaying them as criminal victims, this film is refreshing in its humanity.The only weak point is the love story that between Novalee and Forney. Throughout most of the movie it is not much more than a convenient plot device. At some times, it is downright distracting. However, in the end, it show the difference between Novalee and her ex-boyfriend.If you would like to see a film that will make you feel good about America, this is it.

Much to her surprised, Novalee gets an unexpected visit from her mother (Sally Field) who agrees to hold to the $500 given to Novalee from the president of Wal-Mart and to have them both share an apartment. However after agreeing to pick her up the next day, the mother flees with the $500 leaving Novalee and Americus stranded. All manner of freaky friends and strange characters populate this story, giving some fine roles for Ashley Judd, Stockard Channing , Joan Cusack, among others.

One can only wonder how much of the production cost was footed by Wal Mart. Commercialization of entertainment appears to be the wave of the future, and this reviewer objects to it vehemently. With that said, this is a great film. The actors are entirely convincing, and the attentive viewer quickly becomes engrossed in their (ficticious) emotions. This was the first Natalie Portman film I have seen, and she shines as the poor, down and out country girl who never gives up her dreams. Judd, Bruno, Channing, and Frain all excel in their supporting roles, as does Sally Field in a cameo as Portman's character's mother. Even the actors with minor roles are excellent - especially Joan Cusack as the curt Ruth Meyers, and Keith David as Moses Whitecotten,  the compassionate photographer. The kind townspeople seem almost too good to be true. But this is a film about hope, and teaches that it is important to never give up on your dreams, and it conveys that message well. As a male, I am both proud and embarrassed to admit that this is one of very few films that got me teary-eyed in more than one scene.

This movie proves that, ""Home is where your history begins, and where the heart is.""This film is a very warm movie full of compassion, and is a great Comedy-Drama. This movie may sound like a ""Chick Flick"", but it really isn't. This movie teaches you a lot of lessons about life, and will indeed bring a smile to your face. Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd give a great performance, with brilliant acting. The plot of the movie is not grim and depressing, it is the exact opposite. The plot is also simple, but still gives out a lot of meaning. Love, laughter and some tears are shown through the plot, but still is smooth going and very easy to understand.The DVD also has great special features. You can watch the ""That's the Beat of a Heart"" music video sung by the Warren Brothers featuring Sara Evans, and see the theatrical trailers and TV spots.",5,Home is Where the Heart Is,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,1627,"['Where', 'Heart', 'Is', 'touching', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'alone', 'pregnant', 'boyfriend', 'Wal-Mart', 'nowhere', 'go', 'only', 'five', 'dollars', 'live', 'off', 'choice', 'make', 'home', 'Wal-Mart', 'Hiding', 'bathroom', 'closing', 'time', 'opening', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'pregnancy', 'store', 'undetected', 'Wal-Mart', 'Baby', 'help', 'new', 'friends', 'help', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'journey', 'new', 'things', 'forms', 'many', 'new', 'friendships', 'out', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'really', 'way', 'Thelma', 'Husband', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'cheery', 'spirit', 'Forney', 'librarian', 'Lexi', 'Coop', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'movie', 'Home', 'where', 'history', 'where', 'heart', 'film', 'very', 'warm', 'movie', 'full', 'compassion', 'great', 'Comedy-Drama', 'movie', 'may', 'sound', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'really', ""n't"", 'movie', 'lot', 'lessons', 'life', 'will', 'indeed', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'give', 'great', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'plot', 'movie', 'not', 'grim', 'depressing', 'exact', 'opposite', 'plot', 'also', 'simple', 'still', 'out', 'lot', 'meaning', 'Love', 'laughter', 'tears', 'are', 'shown', 'plot', 'still', 'smooth', 'going', 'very', 'easy', 'understand.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'watch', 'Beat', 'Heart', 'music', 'video', 'sung', 'Warren', 'Brothers', 'featuring', 'Sara', 'Evans', 'see', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots']",Where the Heart Is VHS

But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.

526441,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXIF,Lawyeraau,"[4, 5]","Based upon the book of the same name by Billie Letts, this film was a more than pleasant surprise. It is simply a compelling, absorbing, and unusual film. Well directed by television veteran Matt Williams, the movie exudes a certain folksy charm that grabs the viewer from the get go and keeps that viewer enthralled until the final scene.The film centers around Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), a very pregnant seventeen year old, who, with her boyfriend, lowlife Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno), pulls up to a Walmart's in Oklahoma where he abandons her. So, with virtually no money, literally barefoot and pregnant, and nowhere to go, she sets up camp in Walmart by night and explores the town by day, making friends with a number of memorable characters.She unexpectedly has her baby at Walmart's, making her into a minor local celebrity. While at the hospital convalescing, she meets a sassy, brassy nurse, Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), who befriends her. She is showered with gifts and her mother, Mama Lil (Sally Field), a floozy who discovers her daughter's whereabouts courtesy of the media hoopla, pays her a visit. Having abandoned her once before, she is there long enough for Novalee to be abandoned, yet again.Along comes Thelma 'Sister' Husband (Stockard Channing), an eccentric but kindhearted recovering alcoholic who scoops Novalee and her baby up and takes her to her home. This would be the beginning of a whole new life for Novalee, one that would be enriched by the people whom she meets and the experiences, both good and bad, to which she is subjected. It becomes the story of her personal and emotional odyssey, as well as the story and growth of those with whom she most closely interacts. It is a story about life, relationships, responsibilities, love, and the ties that bind.It is also the story of Willy Jack Pickens and the direction his life takes subsequent to his abandonment of Novalee. After some bad breaks, he gets talent agent, Ruth Meyers (Joan Cusack), to sign him on in hope of furthering a musical career. Unlike Novalee, however, he does not take well to the vicissitudes of life and begins a free fall in a downward spiral. His waterloo culminates in a dramatic meeting with Novalee after many years, a meeting that sets her free from her past, free to love the one person who loves her for herself.Natalie Portman delivers her best performance to date. In the role of Novalee, she mixes innocence with wonder at what the world has to offer her. She adds a certain sweetness, poignancy, and determination to the role that translates into a wonderful vulnerability laced with steel. It is this quality that gives Novalee the will to go on when the odds are so against her, and that is just what Natalie Portman conveys to the viewer.Stockard Channing is great as the eccentric and kind Thelma 'Sister' Husband, a woman who never had children of her own but is truly a mother at heart. Nurturing her garden, as well as Novalee and her baby, flowers and plants are not the only things that thrive under her care. A veritable Mother Earth, she is the kind of person who brings out the best in others, and Novalee and her baby are no exception. Stockard Channing, a great, though underrated actress, brings this home to the viewer in spades.Ashley Judd is terrific as the wide-eyed, ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" Lexie. She comes across as sassy and brassy but is really only looking for someone to appreciate her for who she is and not for the sex she has to offer. Judd delivers the nuances that this role demands. James Frain is sensational as the shy, sensitive, and kind Forney Hull, the town librarian's brother who befriends Novalee. He plays the role with such vulnerability and imbues him with such goodness that the viewer cannot help but care deeply for him. It is also almost hard to believe that James Frain is British, as he has an American accent so down pat.Dylan Bruno is perfect as Willie Jack Pickens, the country good old boy who ruins his own life and almost ruins Novalee's. Joan Cusack shows her deft comedic flair in the small, but memorable role of Ruth Meyers, and Sally Field leaves her mark in her cameo role as Novalee's mother. All in all, the entire cast gives stellar performances. This is a well-directed film that should not be missed.",5,WHITE TRASH GIRL MAKES GOOD...,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,4320,"['Based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Billie', 'Letts', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'simply', 'compelling', 'absorbing', 'unusual', 'film', 'Well', 'directed', 'television', 'veteran', 'Matt', 'Williams', 'movie', 'certain', 'folksy', 'charm', 'viewer', 'get', 'go', 'keeps', 'viewer', 'enthralled', 'final', 'scene.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Novalee', 'Nation', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'very', 'pregnant', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'Willy', 'Jack', 'Pickens', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'up', 'Walmart', 'Oklahoma', 'where', 'So', 'virtually', 'money', 'literally', 'barefoot', 'pregnant', 'nowhere', 'go', 'up', 'camp', 'Walmart', 'night', 'town', 'day', 'making', 'friends', 'number', 'memorable', 'characters.She', 'unexpectedly', 'baby', 'Walmart', 'making', 'minor', 'local', 'celebrity', 'hospital', 'convalescing', 'sassy', 'brassy', 'nurse', 'Lexie', 'Coop', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'showered', 'gifts', 'mother', 'Mama', 'Lil', 'Sally', 'Field', 'floozy', 'who', 'daughter', 'whereabouts', 'courtesy', 'media', 'hoopla', 'visit', 'Having', 'abandoned', 'once', 'there', 'long', 'enough', 'Novalee', 'be', 'abandoned', 'yet', 'again.Along', 'Thelma', ""'Sister"", 'Husband', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'eccentric', 'kindhearted', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'Novalee', 'baby', 'up', 'home', 'would', 'be', 'beginning', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'Novalee', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'enriched', 'people', 'whom', 'experiences', 'good', 'bad', 'subjected', 'story', 'personal', 'emotional', 'odyssey', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'growth', 'whom', 'most', 'closely', 'story', 'life', 'relationships', 'responsibilities', 'love', 'ties', 'bind.It', 'also', 'story', 'Willy', 'Jack', 'Pickens', 'direction', 'life', 'subsequent', 'abandonment', 'Novalee', 'bad', 'breaks', 'talent', 'agent', 'Ruth', 'Meyers', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'sign', 'hope', 'furthering', 'musical', 'career', 'Novalee', 'however', 'not', 'take', 'well', 'vicissitudes', 'life', 'free', 'fall', 'downward', 'spiral', 'waterloo', 'culminates', 'dramatic', 'meeting', 'Novalee', 'many', 'years', 'meeting', 'free', 'past', 'free', 'love', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'herself.Natalie', 'Portman', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'role', 'Novalee', 'mixes', 'innocence', 'wonder', 'what', 'world', 'offer', 'certain', 'sweetness', 'poignancy', 'determination', 'role', 'wonderful', 'vulnerability', 'laced', 'steel', 'quality', 'Novalee', 'will', 'go', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'so', 'just', 'what', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'viewer.Stockard', 'Channing', 'great', 'eccentric', 'kind', 'Thelma', ""'Sister"", 'Husband', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'children', 'own', 'truly', 'mother', 'heart', 'Nurturing', 'garden', 'as', 'well', 'Novalee', 'baby', 'flowers', 'plants', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'things', 'thrive', 'care', 'veritable', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'out', 'best', 'others', 'Novalee', 'baby', 'are', 'exception', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'great', 'though', 'underrated', 'actress', 'home', 'viewer', 'spades.Ashley', 'Judd', 'terrific', 'wide-eyed', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'Lexie', 'sassy', 'brassy', 'really', 'only', 'looking', 'someone', 'appreciate', 'who', 'not', 'sex', 'offer', 'Judd', 'nuances', 'role', 'James', 'Frain', 'sensational', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'Forney', 'Hull', 'town', 'librarian', 'brother', 'who', 'Novalee', 'role', 'such', 'vulnerability', 'such', 'goodness', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'care', 'deeply', 'also', 'almost', 'hard', 'believe', 'James', 'Frain', 'British', 'American', 'accent', 'so', 'down', 'pat.Dylan', 'Bruno', 'perfect', 'Willie', 'Jack', 'Pickens', 'country', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'own', 'life', 'almost', 'Novalee', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'deft', 'comedic', 'flair', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'Ruth', 'Meyers', 'Sally', 'Field', 'mark', 'cameo', 'role', 'Novalee', 'mother', 'entire', 'cast', 'stellar', 'performances', 'well-directed', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Where the Heart Is VHS

526444,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00003CXIF,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 3]","Sometimes a movie will surprise me.  I was really surprised by this one.  The thing that hooked me at the beginning was the subplot of Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman, who is now so famous that she needs no additional background from me) living in a Wal-Mart.  I was wondering what she would do when the baby came.  The next thing I know, I have given up doing all the other things I should have been doing to watch this movie to the very end.  I am very glad I did so, and I will do so again.Novalee is 17 years old, pregnant, and freshly dumped by her loser boyfriend Wally Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno, who is now a regular on the television series ""Numb3rs"").  At first I thought this movie was going to be another of those seemingly countless movies about a young girl who manages to get kicked around by life, eventually ending up as an alcoholic in a trailer park somewhere or maybe in prison because she has turned to a life of crime; essentially, one of those movies where everybody gets blamed except the person most responsible.  Instead, this movie surprised me by having Novalee realize that she was the only person who was going to be able to get her act together.Novalee was fortunate that she had help from several key people, including Thelma ""Sister"" Husband, cleverly played by veteran actress Stockard Channing, and the eccentric but likable librarian Forney Hull, played by James Frain.  As a side note, Bruno and Frain have roles in a recently completed movie, ""Quid Pro Quo.""  Novalee also gets important advice and a little critical help from Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd).  This movie surprised me again by having Novalee give as much help, if not more, than she gets.  I will let you learn how she does this.This movie refuses to be simple.  After the major players are in place we keep meeting other people who have affected Novalee either directly or indirectly.  Novalee's mother (Sally Field) drops by and we quickly understand how Novalee could get into the situation she is in.  We also see how Novalee has decided, for herself, that she will be the mother that her mother never was.  We meet Forney's sister and learn a lot about Forney.  The list is extensive, but these side characters are important.This movie never lets up.  Taking a page from action movie playbooks, you get a tornado, an attempted guilt trip from a handicapped boyfriend (the gift that keeps on sucking up your life, if you let it), child abuse, woman abuse, a kidnapping, and lots more to keep your focus on this movie.  The only danger in this movie is that you will turn away a moment too long and have to go back to catch the subtlety that you missed.Many movies in this genre seem to follow a simple formula.  Define the bad guy.  Define the woman or girl who just cannot seem to get a break.  Make you feel sorry for the woman or girl and keep doing it until you either want to cry or scream.  This movie manages to make you want to cry in several places, but it does so in a very natural and poignant way.  This movie held my interest so well that I think most viewers who like good movies about real life will love this one.  Classify this one as a romantic movie about a strong-willed woman who took minimal help to make changes in her life, and then repaid the help she got many times over.Enjoy; I know you will!",4,I Really Liked It,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,3321,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'will', 'surprise', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'one', 'thing', 'hooked', 'beginning', 'was', 'subplot', 'Novalee', 'Nation', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'now', 'so', 'famous', 'additional', 'background', 'living', 'Wal-Mart', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'when', 'baby', 'came', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'doing', 'other', 'things', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'watch', 'movie', 'very', 'end', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'so', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'again.Novalee', '17', 'years', 'old', 'pregnant', 'freshly', 'dumped', 'loser', 'boyfriend', 'Wally', 'Jack', 'Pickens', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'who', 'now', 'regular', 'television', 'series', 'Numb3rs', 'first', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'seemingly', 'countless', 'movies', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'get', 'kicked', 'life', 'eventually', 'ending', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'trailer', 'park', 'somewhere', 'maybe', 'prison', 'turned', 'life', 'crime', 'essentially', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'everybody', 'blamed', 'person', 'most', 'responsible', 'Instead', 'movie', 'surprised', 'having', 'Novalee', 'realize', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'act', 'together.Novalee', 'was', 'fortunate', 'had', 'help', 'several', 'key', 'people', 'including', 'Thelma', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'cleverly', 'played', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'eccentric', 'likable', 'librarian', 'Forney', 'Hull', 'played', 'James', 'Frain', 'side', 'note', 'Bruno', 'Frain', 'have', 'roles', 'recently', 'completed', 'movie', 'Quid', 'Pro', 'Quo', 'Novalee', 'also', 'important', 'advice', 'little', 'critical', 'help', 'Lexie', 'Coop', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'movie', 'surprised', 'again', 'having', 'Novalee', 'give', 'as', 'much', 'help', 'not', 'more', 'will', 'let', 'learn', 'how', 'this.This', 'movie', 'be', 'simple', 'major', 'players', 'are', 'place', 'keep', 'meeting', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'affected', 'Novalee', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'Novalee', 'mother', 'Sally', 'Field', 'drops', 'quickly', 'understand', 'how', 'Novalee', 'could', 'get', 'situation', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Novalee', 'decided', 'will', 'be', 'mother', 'mother', 'never', 'was', 'meet', 'Forney', 'sister', 'learn', 'lot', 'Forney', 'list', 'extensive', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'important.This', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'Taking', 'page', 'action', 'movie', 'playbooks', 'get', 'tornado', 'attempted', 'guilt', 'trip', 'handicapped', 'boyfriend', 'gift', 'sucking', 'up', 'life', 'let', 'child', 'abuse', 'woman', 'abuse', 'kidnapping', 'lots', 'more', 'keep', 'focus', 'movie', 'only', 'danger', 'movie', 'will', 'turn', 'away', 'moment', 'too', 'long', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'catch', 'subtlety', 'missed.Many', 'movies', 'genre', 'seem', 'follow', 'simple', 'formula', 'Define', 'bad', 'guy', 'Define', 'woman', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'break', 'Make', 'feel', 'sorry', 'woman', 'girl', 'keep', 'doing', 'either', 'want', 'cry', 'scream', 'movie', 'make', 'want', 'cry', 'several', 'places', 'so', 'very', 'natural', 'poignant', 'way', 'movie', 'held', 'interest', 'so', 'well', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'good', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'Classify', 'one', 'romantic', 'movie', 'strong-willed', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'minimal', 'help', 'make', 'changes', 'life', 'then', 'repaid', 'help', 'got', 'many', 'times', 'over.Enjoy', 'know', 'will']",Where the Heart Is VHS

Where the Heart Is falls into this group, although it should appeal to some viewers who are less worldly and more forgiving than myself.The movie opens in the boondocks of Tennessee. A very pregnant Novalee Nation [Natalie Portman] and her redneck boyfriend, Willy Jack [Dylan Bruno] are about to take off to California in a beat up old car. Why is it that such characters in the movies invariably head for the Golden State? Is it some kind of rule of script writing? In Oklahoma, Willy lets Novalee go into a Walmart to buy some shoes and promptly leaves her there for reasons that go mainly unexplained. Broke, tired and hungry, she literally lives in the store for six weeks. During the hours it is open, she wanders around town meeting various eccentric characters. One is Thelma [Stockard Channing], a recovering alcoholic who runs the local welcome wagon. She becomes a mother figure to Novalee. Another is Forney Hall [James Frain], who is the assistant librarian. His sister is the head librarian but is always too drunk to work. One rainy night Novalee goes into labor in the locked up Walmart. Forney, who's been following her, jumps through a window and rescues her. In the hospital she meets Lexie {Ashley Judd], who seems to be the head nurse. Since Lexie has had five children by five different fathers, it would seem that her training did not include birth control. Novalee goes to live with Lexie, and soon she and her new friends are having enough trials and tribulations to bring down an entire herd of elephants.The problem is the script, which leaves the talented cast to perform as best they can. The story borders on being incoherent, with many scenes being simply skits or vignettes poorly strung together. There are too many stops and starts. As a result, it is hard to get close to these people, no matter how much trouble they are going though. What is exceptionally irritaiting is that the movie's style makes the characters almost dull when they could have been interesting.Where the Heart Is based on a novel by Billie Lotts.

526459,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00003CXIF,Only-A-Child,"[2, 6]","What Were They Thinking?""Where the Heart Is"" reminds me a little of ""Pumpkin"". Good performances and excellent individual scenes that occur so haphazardly that the movie never quite figures out where it is going but manages to cover a lot of ground in the process. This gives both films such a surreal quality that a few days after viewing you will wonder if the whole thing was just a dream (Christina Ricci as a blonde sorority girl-Natalie Portman as a pregnant hillbilly-must have just been my imagination). Unfortunately, both films stop short of being truly surreal and are simply ordinary efforts with a little strangeness. If a visionary director like David Lynch had just ratcheted up the surreal qualities a tiny bit more the result would have been special.The plot is such a mix of randomness, contrivance, flash-forwards, improbability, coincidence, reversals of fortune, and incidental sub-plots that the editor must have been pushed to the brink of madness during the post-production process. The ending is such a lame contrivance that you are puzzled that the producer did not send the script back for major alteration before shooting even began.It is a tribute to Natalie Portman that she holds this mess together, and even manages to keep the nausea meter at a tolerable level during the ending. Although you won't believe it from her ""Star Wars"" performances, Portman is really a fine actress. Although horribly miscast here (couldn't her character have been from rural Nebraska instead-thus not requiring that hillbilly accent?), she does manage to bring her character to life.Then again, what do I know?

526460,AL8IWEXRY1EWB,B00003CXIF,"P. Connors ""Colonialpara""","[6, 6]","This is one of those movies that one would have to be heartless not to like.  Made from the novel of the same name by the author Billie Letts, this is the story of Novalee Nation, a 17 year old pregnant teenager who has nothing and gains everything when she is stranded in a small Oklahoma town by her self-centered boyfriend.Novalee has had a hard life.  Abandoned by her mother as a child, she became a foster child and then, reared mostly in poverty, fell into that pattern that unfortunately, so many poor and uneducated young women seem to find.  She is a high school drop-out and pregnant at 17 with a guy who at best can be described as selfish and abusive.  They make a fine pair as they set off for the dreamland of California.  Unbeknownst to Novalee, her boyfriend has no intention of delivering her to the West Coast.  He abandons her in a Wal-Mart parking lot after she goes inside to buy shoes to replace the ones that fell through the floor of the &quot;rustbucket&quot; they are driving to California.Rather than panic, Novalee makes the best of her situation and eventually takes up residence in the store.  She eats their food and uses a sleeping bag from the camping department to sleep in.  She avoids the night crew and manages to keep a roof over her head until she has her baby.  Novalee becomes an instant celebrity when the birth is announced all over TV and the fact that Wal-Mart offers her a job shows the compassion of such a large organization.  She eventually meets up with the mother who abandoned her years before and things seem to gel; well, that doesn'tt happen and Novalee finds herself alone again.Through the good will of Sister Husband, played with incredible sensitivity, humor and caring by Stockard Channing, Novalee again has a roof over her head.  She takes the job at Wal-Mart and attempts to reconstruct her life.  In the process, she meets many people who have nothing but a positive effect on her life.  There is Forney Hall, the &quot;too well educated&quot; dreamer who serves as de facto librarian while caring for his alcoholic older sister, and there is also Lexie Coop, played to perfection by Ashley Judd.  Lexie is another of the downtrodden; she  sleeps with men too easily and winds up with far too many children as a result of her lack of planning.As the movie progresses, we watch Novalee mature and her daughter, Americus grow up.  Along the way, Forney falls for her and Lexie has more children.  Sister Husband is the cement that binds them all together.  As we begin to hope that Novalee will finally find some degree of happiness, tragedy strikes and she finds herself alone again.  A benefactor emerges and Novalee is able to have a home for herself and her daughter.Novalee's ex also moves along with his life and he finds an agent for his budding C&amp;W career.  Over the five years since he deserted Novalee, he has never once contacted her or inquired about the child they had.  He is the epitome of selfishness and he seems to have learned nothing.This is one of those movies that have elements of predictability to it and yet, the touching nature of the relationships between Novalee, Sister Husband, Forney, Moses Whitecotton and others is what makes this movie work.  While it is depressing in points, it does its best not to pander to the poorer people at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder in America.  Neither does it show them as people without hope, who resort to criminality to make their way in the world.This is a heartwarming movie because it shows that Americans, especially those in the mid-west and south are incredibly caring and giving people.  There is no nobility in poverty and yet, there is still charity.  These people are folks who would give you the last food in their fridge, the coat off their backs and their bed to sleep in.  And Novalee is not one to take advantage.  She gives as much as she gets and she is there for her friends when they need her.This is a movie about the giving nature that we find in our hearts.  It is a movie about love and generosity, giving and maturing and it is also a movie about forgiveness.  If you want to see a movie that will genuinely leave you feeling good when it ends, then you must see this movie.  The author Billie Letts captured the spirit and essence of these poor but loving Oklahomans to a tee.  It is to the actor's, producer's and director's credit that all that Letts wrote about in her fine novel transitioned so well to the screen.I knew when I saw this movie in the theaters last year that I would buy this movie for my collection.  Well, I have and I recommend it without reservation to all who aspire to know &quot;where the heart is.&quot;Paul Connors",4,"Touching, Heartwarming and Uplifting",985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,4712,"['one', 'movies', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'heartless', 'not', 'like', 'Made', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'author', 'Billie', 'Letts', 'story', 'Novalee', 'Nation', '17', 'year', 'old', 'pregnant', 'teenager', 'who', 'nothing', 'gains', 'everything', 'when', 'stranded', 'small', 'Oklahoma', 'town', 'self-centered', 'boyfriend.Novalee', 'had', 'hard', 'life', 'Abandoned', 'mother', 'child', 'became', 'foster', 'child', 'then', 'reared', 'mostly', 'poverty', 'fell', 'pattern', 'unfortunately', 'so', 'many', 'poor', 'uneducated', 'young', 'women', 'seem', 'find', 'high', 'school', 'drop-out', 'pregnant', '17', 'guy', 'who', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'selfish', 'abusive', 'make', 'fine', 'pair', 'set', 'off', 'dreamland', 'California', 'Unbeknownst', 'Novalee', 'boyfriend', 'intention', 'delivering', 'West', 'Coast', 'Wal-Mart', 'parking', 'lot', 'inside', 'buy', 'shoes', 'replace', 'ones', 'fell', 'floor', 'quot', 'rustbucket', 'quot', 'are', 'driving', 'California.Rather', 'panic', 'Novalee', 'best', 'situation', 'eventually', 'up', 'residence', 'store', 'eats', 'food', 'sleeping', 'bag', 'camping', 'department', 'sleep', 'avoids', 'night', 'crew', 'manages', 'keep', 'roof', 'head', 'baby', 'Novalee', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'when', 'birth', 'announced', 'TV', 'fact', 'Wal-Mart', 'job', 'compassion', 'large', 'organization', 'eventually', 'up', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'years', 'things', 'seem', 'gel', 'well', ""doesn'tt"", 'happen', 'Novalee', 'alone', 'good', 'will', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'played', 'incredible', 'sensitivity', 'humor', 'caring', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Novalee', 'again', 'roof', 'head', 'job', 'Wal-Mart', 'attempts', 'reconstruct', 'life', 'process', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'positive', 'effect', 'life', 'Forney', 'Hall', 'quot', 'too', 'well', 'educated', 'quot', 'dreamer', 'who', 'de', 'facto', 'librarian', 'caring', 'alcoholic', 'older', 'sister', 'also', 'Lexie', 'Coop', 'played', 'perfection', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Lexie', 'downtrodden', 'men', 'too', 'easily', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'children', 'result', 'lack', 'planning.As', 'movie', 'watch', 'Novalee', 'mature', 'daughter', 'Americus', 'grow', 'up', 'way', 'Forney', 'Lexie', 'more', 'children', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'cement', 'together', 'begin', 'hope', 'Novalee', 'will', 'finally', 'find', 'degree', 'happiness', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'alone', 'again', 'benefactor', 'Novalee', 'able', 'have', 'home', 'herself', 'daughter.Novalee', 'ex', 'also', 'along', 'life', 'agent', 'budding', 'C', 'amp', 'W', 'career', 'five', 'years', 'deserted', 'Novalee', 'never', 'once', 'contacted', 'inquired', 'child', 'had', 'epitome', 'selfishness', 'have', 'learned', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'elements', 'predictability', 'yet', 'touching', 'nature', 'relationships', 'Novalee', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'Forney', 'Moses', 'Whitecotton', 'others', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'depressing', 'points', 'best', 'not', 'pander', 'poorer', 'people', 'bottom', 'socio-economic', 'ladder', 'America', 'show', 'people', 'hope', 'who', 'resort', 'criminality', 'make', 'way', 'world.This', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'Americans', 'especially', 'mid-west', 'south', 'are', 'incredibly', 'caring', 'giving', 'people', 'nobility', 'poverty', 'yet', 'still', 'charity', 'people', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'last', 'food', 'fridge', 'coat', 'off', 'backs', 'bed', 'sleep', 'Novalee', 'not', 'one', 'take', 'advantage', 'as', 'much', 'there', 'friends', 'when', 'need', 'her.This', 'movie', 'giving', 'nature', 'find', 'hearts', 'movie', 'love', 'generosity', 'giving', 'maturing', 'also', 'movie', 'forgiveness', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'genuinely', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'when', 'then', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'author', 'Billie', 'Letts', 'captured', 'spirit', 'essence', 'poor', 'loving', 'Oklahomans', 'tee', 'actor', 'producer', 'director', 'credit', 'Letts', 'wrote', 'fine', 'novel', 'transitioned', 'so', 'well', 'screen.I', 'knew', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'last', 'year', 'would', 'buy', 'movie', 'collection', 'Well', 'have', 'recommend', 'reservation', 'who', 'aspire', 'know', 'quot', 'where', 'heart', 'is.', 'quot', 'Paul', 'Connors']",Where the Heart Is VHS

Obviously, not to be taken literally,and seriously, in my view. For example, Ashley Judd's characterhas 6 kids in the film.There are also serious aspects brought into the open, such asalcoholism, irresponsibility, financial ruin, pedophilia,psychological disorders, age and death, birth, etc.There's the softer side, as well, which depicts the socialinteractions between people, which is not always valued orunderlined in a moview, vs. agression, violence, explosions inaction movies, for example. For this reason alone, the store canbe seen as a welcome change.It also brings to the forefront, paternal responsibility forfathering kids, the thesis of the movie being, is sorely lackingin the USA.Judd's character is done extremely well, and is perfect to notoverexpose her, in balance with Natalie Portman's persona, whichis the real focus, and protagonist, here. Again, Portman simplydoes an incredible job, with her human presence, timid yet verycredible, such that the 90 minutes or so pass by without theviewer barely noticing.Some scenes could have been edited a bit better, as perhaps somewill fast forward them, due to momentary boredom.In depicting a full, varied range of emotions, this movie isextremely well written, acted out, and filmed.Finally, I did not recognize Stockard Channing until I read thecredits, as she looked quite a bit differently, in the otherfilm, SMOKE.

526465,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXIF,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","Outstanding performances by Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd highlight ""Where The Heart Is,"" a warm and remarkable film directed by Matt Williams.  On their way to California from Tennessee, single and pregnant Novalee  Nation (Portman) is abandoned by her boyfriend Willy Jack (Dylan Bruno) at  a Wal Mart in Oklahoma.  She has no friends, no family and only a few  dollars in her pocket.  Lost, with no one to turn to and no place to go,  she takes up residence in the Wal Mart for the next six weeks, where  destiny has placed her for the birth of her daughter.  Mercifully, fate  brings Forney Hall (James Frain) to her, a young man who lives nearby above  the town library with his sister, and he delivers the baby.  What  follows is a story of very real people who are just trying to live their  lives as best they can, seeking the good in themselves as well as others,  and striving to hold on to the important things as they sort and sift  through all the obstacles life has to throw at them, and does.  Throughout  her travails, Novalee's life is touched by those in need themselves,  beginning with Lexie Coop (Judd), the nurse who befriends her when she  needs it most, and ""Sister"" Husband (wonderfully played by Stockard  Channing), who takes her in when she and her newborn baby have nowhere else  to go.  From the novel by Billie Letts, Williams and writers Lowell  Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have presented a truly heartwarming film, told  through characters with whom the audience can readily identify and  empathize; a story of compassion and love that aptly illustrates the  magnanimity of the human spirit, as well as the depths of evil to which it  is capable of descending.  When Novalee is in the hospital, her mother,  Lil, (an uncharacteristic role for Sally Field in a terrific cameo), who  had abandoned her when she was five years old, shows up after seeing the  story of the ""Wal Mart Baby"" on television, only to steal from her.  In  another exacting scene, Lexie tells Novalee of coming home from work early  and catching her boyfriend abusing two of her children, a scene which is  all the more effective because the crime is not shown; we see only Lexie  and her children as she describes what happened.  And it is harrowing.  Their work here firmly establishes Portman and Judd as two of the finest  young actresses in film today; Channing has never been better, while Frain  and Bruno must be given credit for adding so much to this worthy endeavor,  as well as the rest of the supporting cast which includes Joan Cusack (Ruth  Meyers), Keith David (Moses) and Richard Jones (Mr. Sprock).  A great story  and first-rate performances all around make ""Where The Heart Is"" an  unforgettable film that will stay with you, in your heart and in your soul,  for a long, long time.",5,A Five Carat Diamond,965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,2804,"['Outstanding', 'performances', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'highlight', 'Where', 'Heart', 'warm', 'remarkable', 'film', 'directed', 'Matt', 'Williams', 'way', 'California', 'Tennessee', 'single', 'pregnant', 'Novalee', 'Nation', 'Portman', 'abandoned', 'boyfriend', 'Willy', 'Jack', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'Oklahoma', 'friends', 'family', 'only', 'few', 'dollars', 'pocket', 'Lost', 'one', 'turn', 'place', 'go', 'up', 'residence', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'next', 'six', 'weeks', 'where', 'destiny', 'placed', 'birth', 'daughter', 'Mercifully', 'fate', 'brings', 'Forney', 'Hall', 'James', 'Frain', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'nearby', 'town', 'library', 'sister', 'baby', 'What', 'story', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'live', 'lives', 'can', 'seeking', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'striving', 'hold', 'important', 'things', 'sort', 'sift', 'obstacles', 'life', 'throw', 'Throughout', 'travails', 'Novalee', 'life', 'touched', 'need', 'beginning', 'Lexie', 'Coop', 'Judd', 'nurse', 'who', 'when', 'most', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'who', 'when', 'newborn', 'baby', 'have', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'novel', 'Billie', 'Letts', 'Williams', 'writers', 'Lowell', 'Ganz', 'Babaloo', 'Mandel', 'have', 'presented', 'truly', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'told', 'characters', 'whom', 'audience', 'can', 'readily', 'identify', 'empathize', 'story', 'compassion', 'love', 'aptly', 'magnanimity', 'human', 'spirit', 'as', 'well', 'depths', 'evil', 'capable', 'descending', 'When', 'Novalee', 'hospital', 'mother', 'Lil', 'uncharacteristic', 'role', 'Sally', 'Field', 'terrific', 'cameo', 'who', 'had', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'up', 'seeing', 'story', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'Baby', 'television', 'only', 'steal', 'exacting', 'scene', 'Lexie', 'Novalee', 'coming', 'home', 'work', 'early', 'catching', 'boyfriend', 'abusing', 'two', 'children', 'scene', 'more', 'effective', 'crime', 'not', 'shown', 'see', 'only', 'Lexie', 'children', 'what', 'happened', 'harrowing', 'work', 'here', 'firmly', 'Portman', 'Judd', 'two', 'finest', 'young', 'actresses', 'film', 'today', 'Channing', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Frain', 'Bruno', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'adding', 'so', 'much', 'worthy', 'endeavor', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Ruth', 'Meyers', 'Keith', 'David', 'Moses', 'Richard', 'Jones', 'Mr.', 'Sprock', 'great', 'story', 'first-rate', 'performances', 'around', 'make', 'Where', 'Heart', 'Is', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'heart', 'soul', 'long', 'long', 'time']",Where the Heart Is VHS

I fell in love with this movie (having not read the book) so it is hard for me to imagine the ""Lexie"" character (Ashley Judd) as a trashy-mannered size 22 mother of four! But the point here is that the main story line, that is, the departure of two people from one another (Novalee and Willy), and watch them go in so very different directions, and to ultimately see how each of their own stories unfold right up until one of them hits rock bottom (Willy) while the other one rises up above difficulties and finds truly happiness (Novalee), is still greatly achieved in the movie. I simply loved Stockard Channing characterization of ""Sister Husband"". And also, what a pleasant surprise was for me to discover Natalie Portman in a certainly luckier role than the pale Amidala... She simply excelled. All the remaining characters are sweet and warm, the music is great and ultimately the whole final product ends up very enjoyable and fresh.

At least I didn't fall asleep or just go home.Sally Field has an interesting cameo in this movie, and it is probably the most memorable scene in the whole flick.More disturbing than anything about this bland movie is this glorification of small business undermining Wal Mart. I hate Wal Mart and all that it stands for, and I am pretty sure that were I in Novalee's predicament, I would have at least given birth in a dumpster before I let Wal Mart capitalize on me.

526486,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00003CXIF,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I first watched Where The Heart Is when it was released in theaters. Since then, I've watched it numerous times. This is such an inspiring tale, with a wonderful ensemble cast that deliver credible, heartfelt performances.Natalie Portman plays 17-year-old Novalee Nation, a rather naive young woman who at the beginning of the movie is heavily pregnant and leaving for California with her ne'er do well boyfriend, Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). Willy really can't be bothered with Novalee or the soon to come baby, and callously abandons her at a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, OK. The poor girl has no choice and decides to live at the Wal-Mart, using items from the store, but keeps a meticulous log of all the money she owes Wal-Mart on a daily basis!Eventually, Novalee has the baby, at the Wal-Mart, helped by the loner librarian, Forney (James Frain), and mother and baby find themselves local celebrities. Novalee's estranged mom (played by Sally Field in a brief role) suddenly appears out of the woodworks, only to abscond with some cash donation given to Novalee. Luckily, the girl is taken in by an eccentric but kind-hearted lady, Sister Husband (an amazing Stockard Channing) and Novalee also finds a good friend in a nurse played by Ashley Judd (in one of her best roles).There's so much to appreciate in this film - how people without much can give so much love and help; the plight of single moms; women making bad decisions; caring for an ailing sibling; there's so much here yet the storyline never appears choppy and characters are fully realized. There are some truly heartbreaking moments as when Novalee realizes where her heart truly is, and also when Lexie (the nurse) makes a horrifying discovery about one of her suitors. This is a movie that I will never tire of.",5,Heartwarming and inspiring,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,1784,"['first', 'watched', 'Where', 'Heart', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'then', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'numerous', 'times', 'such', 'inspiring', 'tale', 'wonderful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'deliver', 'credible', 'heartfelt', 'performances.Natalie', 'Portman', '17-year-old', 'Novalee', 'Nation', 'rather', 'naive', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'beginning', 'movie', 'heavily', 'pregnant', 'leaving', 'California', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'boyfriend', 'Willy', 'Jack', 'Pickens', 'Dylan', 'Bruno', 'Willy', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'Novalee', 'soon', 'come', 'baby', 'callously', 'abandons', 'Wal-Mart', 'Sequoyah', 'OK', 'poor', 'girl', 'choice', 'decides', 'live', 'Wal-Mart', 'using', 'items', 'store', 'meticulous', 'log', 'money', 'Wal-Mart', 'daily', 'basis', 'Eventually', 'Novalee', 'baby', 'Wal-Mart', 'helped', 'loner', 'librarian', 'Forney', 'James', 'Frain', 'mother', 'baby', 'find', 'local', 'celebrities', 'Novalee', 'estranged', 'mom', 'played', 'Sally', 'Field', 'brief', 'role', 'suddenly', 'woodworks', 'only', 'abscond', 'cash', 'donation', 'given', 'Novalee', 'Luckily', 'girl', 'taken', 'eccentric', 'kind-hearted', 'lady', 'Sister', 'Husband', 'amazing', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Novalee', 'also', 'good', 'friend', 'nurse', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'one', 'best', 'roles', '.There', 'so', 'much', 'appreciate', 'film', 'how', 'people', 'much', 'can', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'help', 'plight', 'single', 'moms', 'women', 'making', 'bad', 'decisions', 'caring', 'ailing', 'sibling', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'yet', 'storyline', 'never', 'choppy', 'characters', 'are', 'fully', 'realized', 'are', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'when', 'Novalee', 'where', 'heart', 'truly', 'also', 'when', 'Lexie', 'nurse', 'horrifying', 'discovery', 'one', 'suitors', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'tire']",Where the Heart Is VHS
