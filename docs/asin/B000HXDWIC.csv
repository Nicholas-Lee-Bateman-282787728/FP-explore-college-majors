1017633,A17771LTRWSKQ5,B000HXDWIC,Helen S. Lam,"[3, 5]",I am a HUGE Jackman fan and had high expectations of his first on-screen appearance. Jackman did have pretty good acting but he was not the main character and thus was only in limited scenes. I was not impressed by the performances of the rest of the cast nor did I find the plot particularly engrossing. You will be better off watching an episode of Law & Order.,1,"Save your time, watch something else",1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,363,"['am', 'HUGE', 'Jackman', 'fan', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'first', 'on-screen', 'appearance', 'Jackman', 'did', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'main', 'character', 'thus', 'was', 'only', 'limited', 'scenes', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'did', 'find', 'plot', 'particularly', 'engrossing', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order']",Rat Tamer
1017634,AFK6PRFDJF74U,B000HXDWIC,Joan F. Cipelle,"[6, 6]","I ordered ""The Rat Tamer"" because I was interested in Hugh Jackman's early works.  It was so good that I ordered the whole series from Australia.  Unfortuneately, it is a Region 4 DVD, but I have a player that is all Region, well worth the purchase.  It is a haunting story,very well done.  Although it is a prison drama and very rough at times, I can't help thinking how much worse it would be if done by Hollywood.  Nothing is beyond the need to tell a story; the violence, cursing, drugsare there but not shoved down your throat.  Each episode has its own story but through it all there is the interaction between Kevin(Hugh Jackman) and Dr Corelli(Deborrah-Lee Furness).  You keep waiting for their next appointment to see what happens.  It was worth the effort to find it, I just wish that ""Corelli"" and ""Paperback Hero"" were issued in Region 1 format, they would both make great Christmas gifts.",5,"""Corelli""  the series",1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,901,"['ordered', 'Rat', 'Tamer', 'was', 'interested', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'early', 'works', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'ordered', 'whole', 'series', 'Australia', 'Unfortuneately', 'Region', '4', 'DVD', 'have', 'player', 'Region', 'well', 'purchase', 'haunting', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'prison', 'drama', 'very', 'rough', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'how', 'much', 'worse', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'Nothing', 'need', 'tell', 'story', 'violence', 'cursing', 'drugsare', 'there', 'not', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'episode', 'own', 'story', 'interaction', 'Kevin', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Dr', 'Corelli', 'Deborrah-Lee', 'Furness', 'keep', 'waiting', 'next', 'appointment', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'effort', 'find', 'just', 'wish', 'Corelli', 'Paperback', 'Hero', 'were', 'issued', 'Region', '1', 'format', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'Christmas', 'gifts']",Rat Tamer

And Deborra-Lee Furness does her usual masterful job of developing character.  The film introduces us to prison life in Australia showing anguish, and working at the job of living.  I'm hoping the rest of the series continues this, and is soon available for viewing.  I'm told this is based on true events, and that the psychologist was disbarred because of the relationship.

1017637,A3ALCP02N5EF41,B000HXDWIC,Reader,"[47, 47]","I saw this as the pilot episode of a prison drama series from Australia TV called CORRELLI.  It focused on life in prison, mainly viewed from the eyes of a prison psychologist named Louisa Correlli.  The whole series was  a gripping and realistic dramatization of various lives of prisoners and the people who administered their penal sentences.  Hopefully, the rest of the episodes will also be released on DVD as the entire series is quite excellent.This first episode marked Hugh Jackman's first professional appearance, direct from acting school. Even at that time, Hugh had already shown a  range of dramatic talent that will mark some of his future work, such as his early award-winning role in Erskineville Kings and some of his 2006 film releases  ( The Fountain and The Prestige). To fans of Hugh Jackman, this film is also interesting because the actress who played the role of Louisa Correlli very effectively is Deborra Lee Furness, now Mrs. Hugh Jackman.The episode released on this DVD is a compelling drama of prison life and what it does to those affected by such personal tragedies.",5,Hugh Jackman's first professional appearance,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,1099,"['saw', 'pilot', 'episode', 'prison', 'drama', 'series', 'Australia', 'TV', 'called', 'CORRELLI', 'focused', 'life', 'prison', 'mainly', 'viewed', 'eyes', 'prison', 'psychologist', 'named', 'Louisa', 'Correlli', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'gripping', 'realistic', 'dramatization', 'various', 'lives', 'prisoners', 'people', 'who', 'administered', 'penal', 'sentences', 'Hopefully', 'rest', 'episodes', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'entire', 'series', 'quite', 'excellent.This', 'first', 'episode', 'marked', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'first', 'professional', 'appearance', 'direct', 'acting', 'school', 'Even', 'time', 'Hugh', 'had', 'already', 'shown', 'range', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'will', 'mark', 'future', 'work', 'such', 'early', 'award-winning', 'role', 'Erskineville', 'Kings', '2006', 'film', 'releases', 'Fountain', 'Prestige', 'fans', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'film', 'also', 'interesting', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'Louisa', 'Correlli', 'very', 'effectively', 'Deborra', 'Lee', 'Furness', 'now', 'Mrs.', 'Hugh', 'Jackman.The', 'episode', 'released', 'DVD', 'compelling', 'drama', 'prison', 'life', 'what', 'affected', 'such', 'personal', 'tragedies']",Rat Tamer

In &#34;Rat Tamer,&#34; he gives a sensitive portrayal of a prisoner who has suffered brain damage during his incarceration.  The main star of &#34;Rat Tamer,&#34; however, is the title character, portrayed by Deborah Furness, who later became better known as Mrs. Hugh Jackman.  At the time this pilot for a later Australian television series was made, she was well-known throughout Australia and certainly deserves critical acclaim in her own right.

1017639,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B000HXDWIC,Shopper,"[0, 0]","""The Rat Tamer"" is the pilot of the ten episodes which comprise the Australian series ""Corelli"". Why the powers-that-be decided to release only this one episode in Region 1, is beyond me...The episode does NOT stand alone well, as it leaves too many unanswered questions, greatly frustrating the viewer (think sex without the orgasm...). The four star rating is for the series, rather then this DVD alone. You can purchase, like I did, the Region 4 series from an Australian vendor, and watch it on your computer if you do not own a region free DVD player (or use cables to connect your computer to your TV).Regarding ""Corelli"": Despite Jackman's top billing, the series actually stars Deborra-Lee Furness (Jackson's future wife) as Louisa Corelli, a divorced mother of two and a newly minted prison psychologist. Her struggle to balance her professional and personal life becomes compounded by her growing relationship with Kevin Jones, a young man serving time for armed robbery (Hugh Jackman). Each episode is a somewhat self enclosed story, with the exception of the most intriguing Corelli/Jones theme. Though rather naive and cliched in its treatment of complex psychological issues, this fourteen year old series remains relevant to the contemporary viewer. However, if you are expecting a lot of screen time for Jackman and plenty of sexual fireworks between Corelli and Jones...well, skip it, or you'll be dissapointed. The series offers a safe and savory ending for the character of Corelli, though perhaps not equally satisfactory to a Jackman fan...My one and only gripe regarding this series is the odd portrayal of the Australian prison system...I do not know much about the topic, but felt amuzed when female guards were shown taking male prisoners to the showers (isn't it some sort of a human rights violation for both parties?), and that the unarmed staff seemed to freely mingle with the prison population (hostage, anyone?), not to mention the uber tight micro shorts worn as a uniform by many prisoners (an anti-smuggling measure?...).Anyway, I enjoyed the stories as well as watching the undeniable chemistry between Furness and Jackman. I recommend the series to any Jackman and/or prison drama fan.",4,Save money: order the entire series!,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2222,"['Rat', 'Tamer', 'pilot', 'ten', 'comprise', 'Australian', 'series', 'Corelli', 'Why', 'powers-that-be', 'decided', 'release', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Region', '1', 'episode', 'NOT', 'stand', 'alone', 'well', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'greatly', 'frustrating', 'viewer', 'think', 'sex', 'orgasm', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'series', 'rather', 'then', 'DVD', 'alone', 'can', 'purchase', 'did', 'Region', '4', 'series', 'Australian', 'vendor', 'watch', 'computer', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'player', 'use', 'cables', 'connect', 'computer', 'TV', '.Regarding', 'Corelli', 'Jackman', 'top', 'billing', 'series', 'actually', 'Deborra-Lee', 'Furness', 'Jackson', 'future', 'wife', 'Louisa', 'Corelli', 'divorced', 'mother', 'two', 'newly', 'minted', 'prison', 'psychologist', 'struggle', 'balance', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'becomes', 'compounded', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Kevin', 'Jones', 'young', 'man', 'serving', 'time', 'armed', 'robbery', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'episode', 'somewhat', 'self', 'enclosed', 'story', 'exception', 'most', 'intriguing', 'Corelli/Jones', 'theme', 'rather', 'naive', 'cliched', 'treatment', 'complex', 'psychological', 'issues', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'series', 'relevant', 'contemporary', 'viewer', 'However', 'are', 'expecting', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'Jackman', 'plenty', 'sexual', 'fireworks', 'Corelli', 'Jones', 'well', 'skip', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'series', 'safe', 'savory', 'ending', 'character', 'Corelli', 'perhaps', 'not', 'equally', 'satisfactory', 'Jackman', 'fan', 'one', 'only', 'gripe', 'regarding', 'series', 'odd', 'portrayal', 'Australian', 'prison', 'system', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'topic', 'felt', 'amuzed', 'when', 'female', 'guards', 'were', 'shown', 'taking', 'male', 'prisoners', 'showers', ""n't"", 'sort', 'human', 'rights', 'violation', 'parties', 'unarmed', 'staff', 'seemed', 'freely', 'mingle', 'prison', 'population', 'hostage', 'anyone', 'not', 'mention', 'uber', 'tight', 'micro', 'shorts', 'worn', 'uniform', 'many', 'prisoners', 'anti-smuggling', 'measure', '.Anyway', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'Furness', 'Jackman', 'recommend', 'series', 'Jackman', 'and/or', 'prison', 'drama', 'fan']",Rat Tamer
