Clay ""drakkar91""","[1, 1]","This is a rather riveting and emotional 15 year experience, brought to life with countless video from actual protests and meetings taking place from around 1981 until 1996.  I was constantly impressed with how much archived video is collected in this documentary.  Some of the pieces are tremendously emotional - such as the police beating protesters, the outrage of Larry Kramer and the collective spreading of ashes on the White House lawn.  There are many more moments like these that will reach out from the screen at you.For anyone that grew up during and/or lived through this period, it's a grim reminder of what the gay community tackled as people died hourly.  For anyone who was born after the ""crisis period"" had passed, this is a must see so you may gain a better comprehension of what a true grassroots battle requires - the urgency, the stamina, the unending battles. It makes the current day battles for marriage equality look like a picnic in comparison.Indeed, at times very sad / very emotional, and at other times, a triumph of courage.  To see these people who led the fight in action, and to see some of them truly made it through alive is quite joyful amid the tremendous losses.  While the title could apply to many battles, in this case it applies to the life and death consequences of the AIDS crisis, and it captures the story and people remarkably well.",5,The Plague is AIDS - This Historic Footage Documentary is Outstanding,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1380,"['rather', 'riveting', 'emotional', '15', 'year', 'experience', 'brought', 'life', 'countless', 'video', 'actual', 'protests', 'meetings', 'taking', 'place', '1981', '1996', 'was', 'constantly', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'archived', 'video', 'collected', 'documentary', 'pieces', 'are', 'tremendously', 'emotional', 'such', 'police', 'beating', 'protesters', 'outrage', 'Larry', 'Kramer', 'collective', 'spreading', 'ashes', 'White', 'House', 'lawn', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'moments', 'will', 'reach', 'out', 'screen', 'anyone', 'grew', 'up', 'and/or', 'lived', 'period', 'grim', 'reminder', 'what', 'gay', 'community', 'tackled', 'people', 'died', 'hourly', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'crisis', 'period', 'had', 'passed', 'must', 'see', 'may', 'gain', 'better', 'comprehension', 'what', 'true', 'grassroots', 'battle', 'urgency', 'stamina', 'unending', 'battles', 'current', 'day', 'battles', 'marriage', 'equality', 'look', 'picnic', 'comparison.Indeed', 'times', 'very', 'sad', '/', 'very', 'emotional', 'other', 'times', 'triumph', 'courage', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'led', 'fight', 'action', 'see', 'truly', 'made', 'alive', 'quite', 'joyful', 'tremendous', 'losses', 'title', 'could', 'apply', 'many', 'battles', 'case', 'life', 'death', 'consequences', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'story', 'people', 'remarkably', 'well']",N/A
1547990,AQ33W3BTPKUX5,B0087ITBWA,Dennis E. Hartnett,"[4, 6]","This Film is the story of ACT-UP, a group of young people who forced the powers that be in this country to change all aspects of HIV care, from drug protocol, testing and accessibility to patient care and rights, as well as LGBT issues, although their scope of concern did not end with the LGBT communities.That is is the skeleton of the story. The blood, muscle and tissue is the magnificent courage and guts of these young people, some with HIV and some not, that DARED to look at the powers that be in this country and SCREAM ""I will not die quietly"", ""I have a RIGHT to BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT"", and perhaps the most important, the demands to be an active part of the drug treatment research treatment, approval and distribution protocol. I'm sure some of these peolple felt or knew, that this was for the next wave, that treatment would probably not come in time for them. That is where my first tears of love were shed. To spend the last part of your like confronting, agitating and demonstrating, rather than just throwing up your hands and getting and staying drunk and high (like many of us would.)But there are WONDERFUL spots of humour in the film (i.e. giant condom on Jesse Helms' house.) Couldn't happen to a nicer guy-ick.Now let's get to the heart of the film. Courage, guts, whatever you want to call it - these young people had it in amounts that most people, maybe myself included, cannot conceive. Those of us who are here today who are healthy with HIV due to the drug advacements that have come, all us us owe a huge debt to ACT UP for demanding change, change to discrimination laws, change to drug approval procedures, change to the law in regards to people with HIV and those who love and care for them. This film is a time capsule that brings us back to the not so long ago when HIV was a death sentence. The film does so with grace, honesty, focus and clarity. It is a superb document of an era when hope and anger were all we had. I was 26 in 1985 - I was tested, and when I got my answer back in 2 or 3 weeks (that's how long it took then) it was actally suggested to me to get my affairs in order. I will never forget it. Well, I did not get sick, and I found the courage to get of the unhealthy relationship I was in at the time, which I wrongly though was better than what was going on in the real world. But every single one of my friends, from that 1st group in the late 1970's, is gone now. And I am left, alone now, to make sure they are not forgotten. This film is a written guarantee of that, and a funny, tragic, and in the end magnificent staement of the bravery of people when they feel they have nothing left to lose.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE (2012, 90 minutes) ~ This is a tough documentary for me to review clear-headedly because I came out right before the AIDS epidemic reached our media where I live (very late 1984, a few months after I got married). So I was there, fighting this fight--but there were so few of us in the area with diagnoses.Later they would die by the hundreds. This documentary is essentially the history of the gay/ally protests that spurred the nation and its people to do something about AIDS besides name it and blame the gay community for it. It needs to be seen, especially by those under the age of 30, because this is like seeing a documentary with Rosa Parks herself on center stage.Concentrating on ACT UP and its role in moving the chemists to develop treatment fast, the documentary simultaneously and gently treats with the subject of those dying and the ones already Fallen. It moved me to tears to see the AIDS quilt once again, which I have had the privilege of spending the day with when it was brought to my area and exhibited in a local university's gymnasium.There are problems with this documentary. It makes the powerful statements about AIDS, treatment, the gay community blaming Reagan then Bush for ""murdering"" us--the Big Medication Push also. However, this talks to the heavy-hitters, the media darlings and the fools who divided ACT UP just when it needed unification. I enjoyed seeing Larry Kramer, but the others ... I saw enough of them in the 1980s and early 1990s.What I wanted to see was closer-to-home, everyday stories, survivors and more reminiscences of those who died, not just the obligatory shot of the AIDS quilt. The documentary did not even properly explore the history of the quilt or who came up with the idea. I longed for a segment addressing teens and twenty-somethings today, to hear about how they perceive that epidemic era and what they do about it now.In other words, I wanted to hear Queer Nation's side of things, and hear what the new generation is doing. Stats on the screen are informative and necessary--but they do not replace the human voice. And after a while, I got tired of hearing the same three men over and over and over. Where were the lesbians, the transgendered, all the others who fought/died with us?This is just another well done documentary of those times, and little more. It is indistinguishable in a general way from similar AIDS documentaries and I've seen a great number of them.We Were Here(see my review) was far more powerful because it was the personal, human side of the loss with which AIDS brutalized us. This film is missing that element, yet it shares an annoying element with WE WERE HERE: the details, 'long' camera shots and other nonsensical wastes of time.In other words, if you see my review about the terrificThe Grove, which is America's national AIDS monument, you'll see the fight over it being transformed into an ""art installation"" instead of remaining a simple, lovely grove. Yet so many AIDS documentarists try to make ""art installations"" out of their documentary films and we cannot afford that. We need to see and hear the people, the news reports of the era, and hard-hitting facts. We do not need romanticized, overbearing or operatic ""documentaries"" that teach nothing.Be that as it may, you must get this--do not be put off by my grumpy complaints. It's about time this generation sets aside some DVD shelf space for a respectable AIDS documentary collection. Such a collection is very feasible and this film should be part of it.",4,Sometimes more than just the facts and three guys is needed to tell this story ....,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,3546,"['HOW', 'TO', 'SURVIVE', 'A', 'PLAGUE', '2012', '90', 'minutes', '~', 'tough', 'documentary', 'review', 'clear-headedly', 'came', 'out', 'right', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'reached', 'media', 'where', 'live', 'very', 'late', '1984', 'few', 'months', 'got', 'married', 'was', 'there', 'fighting', 'fight', 'were', 'so', 'few', 'area', 'diagnoses.Later', 'would', 'die', 'hundreds', 'documentary', 'essentially', 'history', 'gay/ally', 'protests', 'spurred', 'nation', 'people', 'do', 'something', 'AIDS', 'besides', 'name', 'blame', 'gay', 'community', 'be', 'seen', 'especially', 'age', '30', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'center', 'stage.Concentrating', 'ACT', 'UP', 'role', 'moving', 'chemists', 'develop', 'treatment', 'fast', 'documentary', 'simultaneously', 'gently', 'treats', 'subject', 'dying', 'ones', 'already', 'Fallen', 'moved', 'tears', 'see', 'AIDS', 'quilt', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'had', 'privilege', 'spending', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'brought', 'area', 'exhibited', 'local', 'university', 'are', 'problems', 'documentary', 'powerful', 'statements', 'AIDS', 'treatment', 'gay', 'community', 'blaming', 'Reagan', 'then', 'Bush', 'murdering', 'Big', 'Medication', 'Push', 'also', 'However', 'talks', 'heavy-hitters', 'media', 'darlings', 'fools', 'who', 'divided', 'ACT', 'UP', 'just', 'when', 'needed', 'unification', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Larry', 'Kramer', 'others', 'saw', 'enough', '1980s', 'early', '1990s.What', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'closer-to-home', 'everyday', 'stories', 'survivors', 'more', 'reminiscences', 'who', 'died', 'not', 'just', 'obligatory', 'shot', 'AIDS', 'quilt', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'properly', 'explore', 'history', 'quilt', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'longed', 'segment', 'addressing', 'teens', 'twenty-somethings', 'today', 'hear', 'how', 'perceive', 'epidemic', 'era', 'what', 'do', 'other', 'words', 'wanted', 'hear', 'Queer', 'Nation', 'side', 'things', 'hear', 'what', 'new', 'generation', 'doing', 'Stats', 'screen', 'are', 'informative', 'necessary', 'do', 'not', 'replace', 'human', 'voice', 'while', 'got', 'tired', 'hearing', 'same', 'three', 'men', 'over', 'Where', 'were', 'lesbians', 'transgendered', 'others', 'who', 'fought/died', 'just', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'times', 'little', 'more', 'indistinguishable', 'general', 'way', 'similar', 'AIDS', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'great', 'number', 'them.We', 'Were', 'Here', 'see', 'review', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'was', 'personal', 'human', 'side', 'loss', 'AIDS', 'brutalized', 'film', 'missing', 'element', 'shares', 'annoying', 'element', 'WE', 'WERE', 'HERE', 'details', 'camera', 'shots', 'other', 'nonsensical', 'wastes', 'time.In', 'other', 'words', 'see', 'review', 'terrificThe', 'Grove', 'America', 'national', 'AIDS', 'monument', ""'ll"", 'see', 'fight', 'being', 'transformed', 'art', 'installation', 'instead', 'remaining', 'simple', 'lovely', 'grove', 'so', 'many', 'AIDS', 'documentarists', 'try', 'make', 'art', 'installations', 'documentary', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'need', 'see', 'hear', 'people', 'news', 'reports', 'era', 'hard-hitting', 'facts', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'romanticized', 'overbearing', 'operatic', 'documentaries', 'teach', 'nothing.Be', 'may', 'must', 'get', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'grumpy', 'complaints', 'time', 'generation', 'aside', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'space', 'respectable', 'AIDS', 'documentary', 'collection', 'collection', 'very', 'feasible', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'part']",N/A

Lane ""professional audience member""","[25, 28]","This documentary by David France explores the early advent of AIDS, its impact on ""Ground Zero"" (in Greenwich Village), and the birth of the gay advocacy groups ACT UP and TAG.Of course, given the topic, we know that many of those attractive, articulate and intelligent men we meet will be dead by the time the final credits run, but it is endlessly fascinating to see how smart the activists were and how quickly they learned everything they had to know in order to have credibility with the US FDA and with Big Pharma. They actually wrote the protocol for testing that surprised the federal agency with its professionalism and ease of application.There are meetings in which the activists learn the art of the ""sound bite"" and are reminded to be passive and polite but express their outrage to any media in the area. It shows the ads they sponsored attacking President George H. W. Bush, it shows a defensive Bill Clinton dressing down an activist and surprisingly, it shows Patrick Buchanan agreeing with an ACT UP spokesman as opposed to a government official.Several pharmaceutical companies began working with them and along with a little success, came internal squabbles.

There is fascinating archival footage (mostly self-shot by ACT UP) showing the activists at home, in planning meetings and at actions. These are intercut with up-to-date talking heads interviews with the activists who survived, especially Larry Kramer, Peter Staley Iris Long andThe documentary is pretty honest, showing the fractiousness of the movement. These people were seeing their loved ones die and were sick with worry about their own prospects for survival. There were times, though when I thought the film was self-serving. To believe their telling of the story, Act Up almost single-handedly battles Republican administrations and the FDA to get medicines approved to fight AIDS. They bullied and pushed to shrink the testing timeline, eventually achieving the 3-pill antiviral cocktail that is keeping many HIV victims alive today. But I wasn't sure how much difference their sit ins and office invasions helped matters or hurt them. Their first attempt at turning up the heat ended up in failure after failure. Still, the movement learned from its mistakes, got educated, and helped shift the testing protocols to include multi-drug approaches.While a more dispassionate telling of the story is needed, there is no doubt that Act Up was a critical part of the attempt by ordinary citizens to get their government to focus on a deadly disease. Watching real people grapple with the unthinkable was very moving. To the point where this Catholic understood why the ""invasion"" of St. Patrick's Cathedral in NYC made sense as a way to bring attention to the Church's lack of compassion toward gays and AIDS. I was especially moved by the story of Bob Rafsky, a closeted gay man who married and had a daughter before coming out and splitting amicably from his wife.

They had to fight for rights others enjoyed simply by being born.  I speak of women, blacks, the poor, Jews, and, in the case of the fighters portrayed in this film, gay men.As HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE recounts, some of those battles were with one another as the 1980s gay community faced two epidemics in A.I.D.S. and the refusals of the government and drug companies to address the fatal disease.  A.I.D.S. hit, and A.C.T.U.P. (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) hit back, but different points of view caused division despite the need for unity.  Still, they prevailed, albeit at high costs.Much of HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE comprises amateur videotape from the 1980s and I wonder how many of the people behind those cameras lived to see their footage in this documentary.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[11, 11]","It hadn't been that long since I sat down with David Weissman's stirring documentary about the early days of AIDS in San Francisco ""We Were Here."" And truthfully, I wasn't sure I wanted to partake of the similarly themed ""How To Survive A Plague"" quite so soon afterwards. I'm glad that I didn't listen to myself! This Oscar nominated feature by David France is like a living history, an important chronicle filmed throughout the eighties and nineties by those on the front lines of the crisis. While ""We Were Here"" is personal and stirring, ""How To Survive A Plague"" is epic and challenging. Based almost entirely in New York City, the film explores the activism and unwavering commitment of those who simply could not stay quiet as an epidemic was being compartmentalized by the nation and its leaders. What is so incredibly powerful about France's documentary is how relevant and vital it feels. This was history in-the-making within my lifetime, and this film maintains an unparalleled urgency.While ""How To Survive A Plague"" does feature plenty of interviews with key members of the ACT UP movement, this is not a standard ""talking heads"" style presentation. Meetings, casual moments, and big protests were all captured while they were happening. Instead of the movie feeling like a remembrance, it feels incredibly timely and alive. As a viewer, I felt like I was there. That's a huge compliment to the way in which this presentation was assembled and why I think this should be essential viewing to just about everyone. It depicts ordinary citizens standing up for a basic healthcare imperative against obstacles of ignorance, indifference, and apathy because the disease was perceived as a homosexual problem. And while I'd like to believe things have changed from a political standpoint, I merely have to turn on CNN to see that we might just be as hopeless as ever.I've thought about ""How To Survive A Plague"" many times since watching it. It shows the highs and lows of a fight that has continued for several decades. Mistakes were made all around and political agendas started to interfere. This isn't just a story about heroes (although I would consider many of those profiled to be so), it is an even handed presentation about the struggle. An exemplary example of stepping up when no one else would, the early activists weren't perfect. They weren't politicians or doctors or experts (for the most part). They educated themselves and challenged the status quo, big pharmaceuticals, and the highest levels of government. I'm glad that it was all documented for future generations and France's piece gives us a concise well-rounded history of major events.
