While it isn't as good as the original Black Stallion, it is interesting and exciting enough to keep your attention.  It does differ a bit from the book, as most movies do, but it was similar enough to satisfy us and it was fun to have some faces to put with the names we'd come to know from reading the book.  The book had peaked my daughter's interest in Saudi Arabia and so the scenery was quite interesting to her as well.  I was wondering where it had been filmed and at the end it said it had been filmed in the Middle East (I forget the country!) so there was some authentic terrain.I would certainly recommend watching this for any horse lover as there are many fine horses in it with an exciting race scene at the end.

More of a standard animal/adventure film for younger viewers and if you think about it that way, it's not too bad. Most of the original cast (except Mr. Rooney) return and it was made in a timely enough way that Kelly Reno is still relatively young and charming -- a really non-actorish child actor and part of the whole appeal. I read both books as a little tyke, but didn't remember the second book too well. It seems to me that many of the details were changed but the general idea of the Black being kidnapped back to his original home in an Arabic country is retained.Alec's adventures chasing his horse are appealing and interesting, and so is the climactic race at the end. But the story just peters out, and we never see Alec return home or what he does without his beloved horse now. (You do have to wonder in a kid's film why there is no resolution with his poor mom (Terri Garr), who had to be frantic when her young son mysteriously disappears for about three months.)I applied the ""11 year old girl who is horse crazy"" test to this film, and decided it would definitely pass. That is who it is really made for, despite the male protagonist (and there is a girl rider in the plot, although she gets the heave-ho in favor of the hero). And that girl (me, about a million years ago) would have enjoyed this, although not as much as the original. It would have held my attention and I would have wanted to view it several times.If your children loved the first film, this much more prosaic sequel would probably be of interest.

728809,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00007GZR8,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","Caveat: although the opening titles set this movie in 1947, the year after its predecessorThe Black Stallion, I prefer to think that it should occur in 1951: first because it was filmed four years after the original, and young star Kelly Reno is clearly a young teenager; second because the great Bedouin tribal gathering and horse-race that serves as its capstone traditionally occurs every five years, and the prequelYoung Black Stallion, which also turns upon one of these events, is straightforwardly set after the close of World War II; and third because of the absence of Mickey Rooney (who played trainer Henry Dailey), into whose Victorian Gothic cottage Alec (Reno) and his mother (Teri Garr) appear to have moved.  Alec and his horse have only deepened the bond they formed while shipwrecked, and when the stallion is spirited away by thieves, Alec follows--only to learn that the ""thieves"" (Ferdinand Mayne, Jodi Thelen) are themselves victims: the Black was originally theirs and was stolen from them after the previous race.  But Alec isn't letting that stop him: he stows away on a transatlantic flying boat to Morocco and begins a perilous journey across the North African desert in search of the missing Black.  Along the way he befriends a young chief (Vincent Spano) and learns that Kurr (Allen Goorwitz), the head of a tribe that has long been enemies to the Black's owners, is out to either acquire or kill the horse himself.  There are perils enough to please the most discerning adventure fan, with several swashbuckling duels and desert privations equal (on a more intimate scale) to those ofLawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition), plus, of course, the thrilling climactic race.  The Bedouins are genuine people, some good, some bad, just like Americans, and viewers will learn some important things about their culture.

There are lots of things that are changed -- for example, the setting for the Black's home is changed to North Africa instead of Saudi Arabia, and Alec ends up going off on the journey by himself, instead of with Henry and Mr. Volence, the owner of one of the horses who ran against Alec in the match race. But these are changes I can handle. The one thing that really irks me is the way Abu Ishak was portrayed. In the book, Abu Ishak was a pretty nice guy. He offered Alec a reward when he came to claim the Black -- legally and tactfully -- and understood how much Alec loved the Black. When Alec and his travelling companions find Abu Ishak's home, Abu Ishak warmly welcomes them. In the film, however the same character is a total jerk. He ruthlessly snatches the Black away after setting the Ramsay's barn on fire to create a diversion, and even ties Alec up at the pier to stop him from following them. And when Alec treks all the way across the desert to find him, Abu Ishak only allows Alec to stay after Alec coerces him into it by appealing to his conscience. Only at the end at the film does he show something resembling kindness. The ending in the film was OK, but I like the book's ending better, when Ishak promises Alec the Black's first colt. I suppose the directors wanted to make sure there wouldn't be another sequel. Cass-Ole's presence was about the only thing that made this film very appealing. I give it two stars.",2,"Good movie, but not quite as good as the book. . .",1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,1556,"['first', 'Black', 'Stallion', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'one', 'better', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'first', 'are', 'lots', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'example', 'setting', 'Black', 'home', 'changed', 'North', 'Africa', 'instead', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Alec', 'up', 'going', 'off', 'journey', 'instead', 'Henry', 'Mr.', 'Volence', 'owner', 'one', 'horses', 'who', 'ran', 'Alec', 'match', 'race', 'are', 'changes', 'can', 'handle', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'irks', 'way', 'Abu', 'Ishak', 'was', 'portrayed', 'book', 'Abu', 'Ishak', 'was', 'pretty', 'nice', 'guy', 'offered', 'Alec', 'reward', 'when', 'came', 'claim', 'Black', 'legally', 'tactfully', 'understood', 'how', 'much', 'Alec', 'loved', 'Black', 'When', 'Alec', 'travelling', 'companions', 'find', 'Abu', 'Ishak', 'home', 'Abu', 'Ishak', 'warmly', 'film', 'however', 'same', 'character', 'total', 'jerk', 'ruthlessly', 'Black', 'away', 'setting', 'Ramsay', 'barn', 'fire', 'create', 'diversion', 'even', 'ties', 'Alec', 'up', 'pier', 'stop', 'following', 'when', 'Alec', 'way', 'desert', 'find', 'Abu', 'Ishak', 'only', 'Alec', 'stay', 'Alec', 'appealing', 'conscience', 'Only', 'end', 'film', 'show', 'something', 'resembling', 'kindness', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'OK', 'like', 'book', 'ending', 'better', 'when', 'Ishak', 'Alec', 'Black', 'first', 'colt', 'suppose', 'directors', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'sequel', 'Cass-Ole', 'presence', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'appealing', 'give', 'two', 'stars']",N/A
