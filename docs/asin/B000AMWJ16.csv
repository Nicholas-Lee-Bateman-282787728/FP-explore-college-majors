Why?The trouble, in my opinion, was not all the talking. I appreciated the idea behind the performance and it was even fun. The trouble was the execution of the songs. I knew it was all to be acustic (with only Bruce playing), but I never figured that he would suck out the essence of the songs to the point that they became unbearable to listen, so boring and lifeless they became. Even the great favorite of mine, ""Brilliant Disguise"", was atrociously mutilated.",1,New world record in boredom,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,559,"['Well', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Boss.But', 'had', 'one', 'worst', 'expriences', 'ever', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Why', 'trouble', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'talking', 'appreciated', 'idea', 'performance', 'was', 'even', 'fun', 'trouble', 'was', 'execution', 'songs', 'knew', 'was', 'be', 'acustic', 'only', 'Bruce', 'playing', 'never', 'figured', 'would', 'suck', 'out', 'essence', 'songs', 'point', 'became', 'unbearable', 'listen', 'boring', 'lifeless', 'became', 'Even', 'great', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Brilliant', 'Disguise', 'was', 'atrociously', 'mutilated']",N/A
929053,A15XTHGM4VS4WH,B000AMWJ16,Rennie Petersen,"[26, 30]","Any inclination to put Bruce Springsteen into the mold of being a shallow pop performer is wiped away after watching ""Bruce Springsteen - VH1 Storytellers"".""VH1 Storytellers"" is a television program where singer-songwriters perform some of their songs and tell about the how and why of each song's creation. One can argue that the program is more for the education and inspiration of budding songwriters than for fans of the artists invited to participate. Still, I'm reviewing this DVD version of ""Bruce Springsteen - VH1 Storytellers"" as a fan, not as an aspiring songwriter.In this program Bruce sings eight songs, accompanying himself on guitar or piano. No band. On ""Brilliant Disguise"" he invites his wife Patti Scialfa to sing backup, but otherwise he is alone on the stage.Between the songs Bruce tells the story behind each song. This results in about 40 minutes of music and 56 minutes of talk, at least for the PAL version of the DVD. (Timing may be a bit different on the NTSC version.)Bruce's discussion of his songwriting is very enjoyable, even confidence-inspiring. He comes across as a disarmingly honest person with perceptive insights into human nature. I found myself liking him a lot, much more than I had expected, having my prejudices regarding what show business and success does to people.For example, Bruce mentions that he wrote up a lot of notes in preparation for this program. He then quips that on reviewing the notes he thought they made him sound very self-centered, and figured that for that purpose he didn't need notes!And when discussing ""Thunder Road"", he dissects the line, ""I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk."" His verdict: ""Probably the hokiest line I ever wrote - and I've written a few of them, let me tell you!""Bruce presents both serious songs and fun songs. The serious songs are followed up by serious discussions of personal ideals vs. politics and reality, the influence of religion (his Catholic background) on his songwriting, and the multiple personalities that we each present depending on the situation. All of which I found fascinating - I was impressed by his understanding and his modesty.Following the main program there is a 16-minute question and answer session. This too was very interesting, with Bruce talking about his feelings and motives as a songwriter. For example, when asked about ""Devils and Dust"", he mentions that he has a couple of boys who are 14 years old, so a parent's concern about his child going off to war has become relevant for him.A few final notes about the DVD itself. As mentioned above, for the PAL version the program is 96 minutes and the Q&A; session is 16 minutes, for a total of 112 minutes. Subtitles are available in Dutch, French, German, Italian and Spanish, but not, unfortunately, in English.Highly recommended, even if you're not a Bruce Springsteen fan.Rennie Petersen",5,Disarmingly honest and with perceptive insights into human nature,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2890,"['inclination', 'put', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'mold', 'being', 'shallow', 'pop', 'performer', 'wiped', 'away', 'watching', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'VH1', 'Storytellers', 'VH1', 'Storytellers', 'television', 'program', 'where', 'singer-songwriters', 'perform', 'songs', 'tell', 'how', 'why', 'song', 'creation', 'One', 'can', 'argue', 'program', 'more', 'education', 'inspiration', 'budding', 'songwriters', 'fans', 'artists', 'invited', 'participate', 'Still', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'version', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'VH1', 'Storytellers', 'fan', 'not', 'aspiring', 'songwriter.In', 'program', 'Bruce', 'sings', 'eight', 'songs', 'accompanying', 'guitar', 'piano', 'band', 'Brilliant', 'Disguise', 'wife', 'Patti', 'Scialfa', 'sing', 'backup', 'otherwise', 'alone', 'stage.Between', 'songs', 'Bruce', 'story', 'song', 'results', '40', 'minutes', 'music', '56', 'minutes', 'talk', 'least', 'PAL', 'version', 'DVD', 'Timing', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'different', 'NTSC', 'version', 'Bruce', 'discussion', 'songwriting', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'confidence-inspiring', 'across', 'disarmingly', 'honest', 'person', 'perceptive', 'insights', 'human', 'nature', 'found', 'liking', 'lot', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'having', 'prejudices', 'regarding', 'what', 'show', 'business', 'success', 'people.For', 'example', 'Bruce', 'mentions', 'wrote', 'up', 'lot', 'notes', 'preparation', 'program', 'then', 'reviewing', 'notes', 'thought', 'made', 'sound', 'very', 'self-centered', 'figured', 'purpose', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'notes', 'when', 'discussing', 'Thunder', 'Road', 'line', 'got', 'guitar', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'talk', 'verdict', 'Probably', 'hokiest', 'line', 'ever', 'wrote', ""'ve"", 'written', 'few', 'let', 'tell', 'Bruce', 'serious', 'songs', 'fun', 'songs', 'serious', 'songs', 'are', 'followed', 'up', 'serious', 'discussions', 'personal', 'ideals', 'politics', 'reality', 'influence', 'religion', 'Catholic', 'background', 'songwriting', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'present', 'depending', 'situation', 'found', 'fascinating', 'was', 'impressed', 'understanding', 'modesty.Following', 'main', 'program', '16-minute', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'too', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'Bruce', 'talking', 'feelings', 'motives', 'songwriter', 'example', 'when', 'asked', 'Devils', 'Dust', 'couple', 'boys', 'who', 'are', '14', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'parent', 'concern', 'child', 'going', 'off', 'war', 'become', 'relevant', 'him.A', 'few', 'final', 'notes', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'PAL', 'version', 'program', '96', 'minutes', 'Q', 'A', 'session', '16', 'minutes', 'total', '112', 'minutes', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'Dutch', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'English.Highly', 'recommended', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'fan.Rennie', 'Petersen']",N/A
929054,A30FTVF4DL8ISN,B000AMWJ16,"thedeadlyhandsofkungfu ""shogunassassin""","[40, 83]","When I first saw this documentary, having followed the music and career of Bruce Springsteen since the days of The Bottom Line appearance (pre-Born To Run), I was impressed by the insights, the writing, and the use of sound in this television episode.  This documentary moved me.  I remember watching the documentary and how it used narration and sound through the final credits--and I actually hung around to watch it until the very end.Someone special wrote and produced this documentary, and if you enjoy Bruce Springsteen's music, or happen to be a die-hard fan, you will get something out of watching it.  I think it will make you reflect on what an enormously important artist Bruce Springsteen really is.  Considering where he came from, how he struggled to find his way through the Asbury Park club scene, and the early albums (remember ""The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle"" or ""Greetings from Asbury Park"").Recently, I was driving with my toddler son strapped in the backseat, and the Manford Mann version of ""Blinded By the Light"" played on the radio.  I found myself listening to the words, and thinking about how much has happened in my own life since I heard the song the first time on Springsteen's Greetings from Asbury Park album (vinyl back in those days).  And, how my four year old son was hearing this cover version for the first time.  It made me nostalgic and a little sad--sad because of the unfulfilled promise of my own life.In the documentary, it's important to see the period of time after Born to Run when Bruce hit a rough patch getting out of an unfair contract with a former manager.  The experience literally put him on the sideline for more than two years.  What emerged from that time away from the public hype (Time and Newsweek Magazine covers of Born To Run), was a deeper, more introspective artist.Has anyone out there watched the latest reality show genre ""Rock Star INXS""?  I am amazed how the entire industry has changed over the years.  Back in the day, unique and heartfelt artists struggled to get their voice heard.  You had significant music being made by artists who had a real connection to their own material.  I'm talking about Springsteen, notably from an earlier era, another personal favorite, the Rolling Stones...you had a wide rock range from the Eagles to to Crosby, Stills, Nash to ACDC to the Pretenders to rock acts like Queen, Foreigner, Journey, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, and more recently amazing bands that reached frontiers like Guns and Roses, Nirvana...and one of the only bands that seem to get it done these days, U2...you get the idea.Now, all it seems to mean is to be able to belt out cover versions of these bands greatest hits.  It's about the marketing.  The image.  I wonder is Rock and Roll still alive?  Or is it dead, and simply masquerading as pretend version of what has changed so many lives?  Has anyone seen these kids trying to sing real rock and roll?  They scream. They yell.  They emote.  They play the role of rock star prancing the stage.  They claim they feel the music.  They cry on cue.  To them, it is real.  To those of us, with pulsating veins, we know better.I saw Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band last year at Dodger's Stadium.  And, frankly, I was also disappointed.  Gone were the four hour, sweat-dripping, leaping from the tall amps, Bruce.  Instead, we got a dare-I-say ""Boring"" show with a lot of white haired folks (like myself) tapping their feet to the music--thinking of better days, long passed.  I would have rather sat at home and watched my old laserdisc of ""No Nukes"" than been there that night.  I am sad to say this.  But, it's true.  The capper for me was being charged thirty bucks for a tour hat.  Being the commercial sell-out that I myself have evolved into, I gladly paid.  I haven't wore it since.Bruce's development as an artist has evolved from ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" to ""Born in the USA"" to a more present-day--saccarine, Bob Dylanesque existence as writer/singer.  Some of the songs hit deep wells--Johnny 99, the Rising.  But, where is the rock?  To me, it all went wrong when the E Street Band broke up the first time.  And, the music started sounding too much like Pop Radio...Dancing in the Dark still makes me cringe.  Don't get me wrong.  I like ""Secret Garden"" and ""Tunnel of Love.""  But, it's so far away from the gritty storytelling of ""Rosalita"" and ""Jungleland.""  I miss those old days. Okay, I sound like I promised I never would--a geriatric rocker with a chip on his shoulder.  I know the old days will never come again.  Now we're left with acoustic albums, and two really unfortunate Greatest Hits compilations.Why do artists release Greatest Hits albums anyway, except to take money from their fans one more time?  If you ever have a chance to listen to a bootleg--specifically, the Winterland album, then you wonder why the greatest hits version was ever put together the way it was released.  It is bone dry by comparison.  There was no transfer of the energy, the spontaneity, the amazing storytelling, the drama of what it felt like to be there in a Bruce concert--whether you were in the back row, or near the stage.For the most part, I admire the integrity of Bruce and his artistic and business decisions.  At least this documentary helped remind me where I was those precious years where I listened to Born to Run and Darkness over and over and over.  Sometimes in the dark, after I gave up on doing homework assignments, lying in my bed, looking up at the ceiling.  It re-connected me with music that helped me get through crappy days in French class where I knew none of what I was learning really mattered.So, if you have a few extra bucks, take a chance and pick up a copy.  It is one of the better examples of what this series has done of exploring significant artists like Bruce.  Maybe it will take you back in time like it did for me.  When my son gets a little older, I will let him watch it, and tell him that his Dad once day revered every word, every note of this artist.  And, I hope he understands what the story of Jungleland did for me.  Or the carefree exuberance of Rosalita.  Or, the brave defiance of Darkness on the Edge of Town.thedeadlyhandsofkungfulos angelesaugust 2005",5,A Portrait of the Boss As An Artist,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,6286,"['When', 'first', 'saw',
