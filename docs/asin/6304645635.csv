I've seen worse BBC Videos, but I've also seen better.  I don't like some of the Cameraman's way of inserting flashes of the past into the scene, and when they did show intact scenes from the past, I couldn't tell where the past scenes ended and the present scenes started. The Female main character acted so bazaar and unlikeable through most of the movie and it's not until the last quarter of the mini series that you find out why she's acting that way. I think this Mini Series could have been done much better by a different director, cameraman and screen play writer.

I am a big fan of the novel, which I think is underrated (it's poorly structured but very original, if a little school-girlish at times). This film follows the book pretty closely -- the ending is a little different but in the spirit of the book.Toby Stephens' Gilbert was beautiful and compelling (& he does a good northern accent), but his performance here doesn't have quite the zing of Jane Eyre because of Tara Fitzgerald's failure to respond to him. (Half of Ruth Wilson's performance in Jane Eyre is her Nancy-Reaganish adoring gaze at Toby, which enhances him greatly.) I was more drawn to the scenes of Toby and his sister, whose scenes were more touching because it seemed like she was more sympathetic to him. Actually Tara's problem may have been following the book too closely -- you don't really get why Helen & Gilbert fall in love in the book, and you don't really get it in the film either. You certainly see that there are good reasons Helen comes off as cold and disgusted with men, both in the book and the film. I think Tara could have cheated a little on this aspect of the character and responded more to Toby so the love story would make more sense (the scriptwriter could have helped by drawing this out more too).Rupert Graves was pretty good as Huntingdon, but his kissing was so gross it's amazing Helen doesn't dump him straight away. Actually, the solution to the film's lack of spark may have been to cast Graves as Gilbert and Toby as Huntingdon -- Toby's knack for playing bad guys would have found a wide field in this character.",3,Toby is adorable in this - movie is pretty good,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1679,"[""'ll"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'ever', 'converted', 'even', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre-type', 'adaptation', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'novel', 'think', 'underrated', 'poorly', 'structured', 'very', 'original', 'little', 'school-girlish', 'times', 'film', 'book', 'pretty', 'closely', 'ending', 'little', 'different', 'spirit', 'book.Toby', 'Stephens', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'beautiful', 'compelling', 'good', 'northern', 'accent', 'performance', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'zing', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'failure', 'respond', 'Half', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Nancy-Reaganish', 'adoring', 'gaze', 'Toby', 'greatly', 'was', 'more', 'drawn', 'scenes', 'Toby', 'sister', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'touching', 'seemed', 'was', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Actually', 'Tara', 'problem', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'book', 'too', 'closely', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'why', 'Helen', 'Gilbert', 'fall', 'love', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'film', 'either', 'certainly', 'see', 'are', 'good', 'reasons', 'Helen', 'off', 'cold', 'disgusted', 'men', 'book', 'film', 'think', 'Tara', 'could', 'have', 'cheated', 'little', 'aspect', 'character', 'responded', 'more', 'Toby', 'love', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'scriptwriter', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'drawing', 'out', 'more', 'too', '.Rupert', 'Graves', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Huntingdon', 'kissing', 'was', 'so', 'gross', 'amazing', 'Helen', ""n't"", 'dump', 'straight', 'away', 'Actually', 'solution', 'film', 'lack', 'spark', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Graves', 'Gilbert', 'Toby', 'Huntingdon', 'Toby', 'knack', 'playing', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'wide', 'field', 'character']",Tenant of Wildfell Hall VHS

I feel as though if I had, there would have been much more understood about the storyline and the dramatic and intense moments that I completely missed out on. I give this movie three stars because of that - it was an interesting story, well-acted, and well put together, but left enough out for me to be a little confused at the end.The story is very dark and mysterious, centering around a widow and her young son who take up residency in Wildfell Hall. The lady is unknown to the townsfolk and once invited into company acts very coldly and is therefore perceived to be unfriendly and rude. She is very protective of her son and apparently just wants to be left to herself.Unfortunately this is a draw to a young man in the village, who befriends and falls in love with her. She is loath to explain her conduct and behavior and as the townspeople's opinion of her is further tarnished - they are convinced she is living a depraved life, particularly now with the young man's repeated solo visits - she appears to be a condemned and avoided woman, until suddenly she disappears.The story only darkens and saddens from that point, but I suppose it can be said that it has a brighter ending. Not a happy one, but a brighter one.I recommend watching it only after you've read the novel.

430328,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,6304645635,Andrew Raker,"[7, 11]","I personally did not find this film adaptation of Anne Bronte's ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" to be very interesting. I did not give the film one star because the adaptation was not a complete disaster. There were some qualities in the film that I found admirable (for example: The film conveys the main theme of a male dominated society, where females have no power).Unlike many people who gave the film adaptation a 5-star rating, I have actually read ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" in full. The penguin edition of the novel is 489 pages - considerably longer than Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice."" Unfortunately, the scriptwriter did not feel that it was acceptable to create a truly wonderful and well-developed mini-series from the novel. Instead, the film is a SHELL with no juicy plot inside.Now, I am not saying that some people (especially people who are not literary scholars, but rather individuals who enjoy love stories) might not find the film interesting. I am simply saying that I was bored by the production.ANALYSIS:In the 1970s and even 1980s, BBC miniseries were often produced using much of the original language from the novel (see Jane Eyre 1973 or 1983, Pride and Prejudice 1980, & Oliver Twist 1985).  Many of the miniseries followed the novel very closely. They had simply the agenda of conveying the book in drama. In some regard, these films were like a play. Often cameras were situated in a position where editing was at a minimal. Furthermore, in these miniseries, minor characters were well developed.Since the late 1990s, films have been overedited, and minor characters have been forgotten (Hargrave rarely gets any screen time, Ralph and Helen Hattersley along with Lord Lowborough and Mr. Grimsby are forgotten, and Helen's live before marriage to Arthur is not portrayed.). In essence, the focus of this film is very limited. Since I have read the novel, this makes the film very boring. Furthermore, some elements of plot are altered (for example: the time, place, and context of Gilbert's confrontation with Frederick Lawrence).Recommended instead:  Jane Eyre (1973) (1983)",2,Too underdeveloped...leaves out too many important details,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,2114,"['personally', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Anne', 'Bronte', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'adaptation', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'disaster', 'were', 'qualities', 'film', 'found', 'admirable', 'example', 'film', 'conveys', 'main', 'theme', 'male', 'dominated', 'society', 'where', 'females', 'have', 'power', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'adaptation', '5-star', 'rating', 'have', 'actually', 'read', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'full', 'penguin', 'edition', 'novel', '489', 'pages', 'considerably', 'longer', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Unfortunately', 'scriptwriter', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'acceptable', 'create', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'well-developed', 'mini-series', 'novel', 'Instead', 'film', 'SHELL', 'juicy', 'plot', 'inside.Now', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'people', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'literary', 'scholars', 'rather', 'individuals', 'who', 'enjoy', 'love', 'stories', 'might', 'not', 'find', 'film', 'interesting', 'am', 'simply', 'saying', 'was', 'bored', 'production.ANALYSIS', '1970s', 'even', '1980s', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'were', 'often', 'produced', 'using', 'much', 'original', 'language', 'novel', 'see', 'Jane', 'Eyre', '1973', '1983', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1980', 'Oliver', 'Twist', '1985', 'Many', 'miniseries', 'followed', 'novel', 'very', 'closely', 'had', 'simply', 'agenda', 'conveying', 'book', 'drama', 'regard', 'films', 'were', 'play', 'cameras', 'were', 'situated', 'position', 'where', 'editing', 'was', 'minimal', 'Furthermore', 'miniseries', 'minor', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'developed.Since', 'late', '1990s', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'overedited', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'Hargrave', 'rarely', 'screen', 'time', 'Ralph', 'Helen', 'Hattersley', 'Lord', 'Lowborough', 'Mr.', 'Grimsby', 'are', 'forgotten', 'Helen', 'live', 'before', 'marriage', 'Arthur', 'not', 'portrayed.', 'essence', 'focus', 'film', 'very', 'limited', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'very', 'boring', 'Furthermore', 'elements', 'plot', 'are', 'altered', 'example', 'time', 'place', 'context', 'Gilbert', 'confrontation', 'Frederick', 'Lawrence', '.Recommended', 'instead', 'Jane', 'Eyre', '1973', '1983']",Tenant of Wildfell Hall VHS
430329,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,6304645635,anna-joelle,"[161, 164]","This video (which runs for 160 mins) follows rather closely to the classic novel by Anne Bronte (except for the ending - nevertheless, it will still please you).The production is lavish, the costumes beautiful and very  correct to the period of time. The cast very capably brought to life the  characters of the suffering Helen Graham, the scoundrel Arthur Huntington  and the love-struck Gilbert Markham.Tara Fitzgerald appeared a little  miscast, owing to her often unnecessarly harsh displays of emotions and an  unsuitable gruffy voice. But because she played the role of Helen Graham  (who's an exceedingly likable heroine), I grew to ignore all that and found  myself rooting for Helen to find all the happiness she deserves.I simply  love Toby Stephens whom I think, is just perfect as Gilbert, the handsome,  young gentleman farmer who sees the goodness in Helen and seeks to protect  her from the hypocrisy and prejudice shown by his unkind relatives and  neighbours.The cinematography is lush and breathtaking. It's obvious  that this is a well-planned production with no expense spared.I have  only 1 minor complaint - that the romantic scenes involving Helen and  Gilbert weren't made more passionate (the way it should be). Instead, we  see more displays of love and affection between Helen and Lord Huntington  (during their courtship days and early marriage). And to what purpose do  they serve? - Since we know just what a brute Huntington turns out to be  later!If you love this video, please pick up the book (ie. if you  haven't already) - the book fleshes out the thoughts, emotions and agonies  of the love-lorn Gilbert much more effectively than could be captured on  film.Nevertheless, I love this video.

The well-cast actors do a great job.Helen, an affluent society woman arrives in a rural farming town in widow's attire with her little boy.  She is reserved and reclusive, so the local folk are very curious about her and a bit disapproving. However, Gilbert, a handsome, charismatic farmer takes a strong interest in her. Although she is cold at first, she warms up to him bit by bit. They become friends, then more then friends in their feelings towards each other; but there is something that hold's Helen back that she is unable to divulge to Gilbert or anyone.The local folk begin making presumptions about Helen's character and ""I dare say"" the gossip abounds and the community including the Vicar, all judge her harshly and begin to snub her. Gilbert defends her while knowing she IS hiding some secret, even from him and tries to get her to talk about her burdens.  It is not clear what happened to her and her boy for half the movie; but there are several flash backs to some dark memories.The movie is a bit of puzzle that unfolds slowly and comes together at the end, with some twists and surprises.

While this is a largely tragic story to begin with, at least in reading it, you can find some bits of joy here and there, which offset what is otherwise a pretty miserable situation the primary character (Tara Fitzgerald) is exposed to. I know about the weather in Northern England, but the sun DOES shine there sometimes. Apparently, the director chose not to shoot on any sunny days. While the scenics are beautiful, when they are only used on overcast days with low contrast film stock, they don't really offer much. Nice set design, costumes, and some good acting are what made me give this 2 stars and not one. Even if you are some sort of always upbeat person, this production will probably bring you down. IF you like it visually, there is still the music to be dealt with. Frequent violin, and sometimes flute music, with long, drawn out, somber notes, add to the misery. Don't show this DVD to anyone who is already depressed, or it will probably be the last thing they ever watch, if you know what I mean. I have the impression that the first day on the set, the director said ""OK, no one is allowed to smile until after the wrap party"" and apparently, no one did, until the film was in the can. I understand that this is supposed to be drama, not comedy, but just as some comedies do not represent real life because they are too silly, this did not represent real life for being too joyless.

She couldn't get a divorce, all her property and her children belonged to her husband, and society turned a blind eye unless she actually got murdered.And this haunting idea is at the heart of &#34;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,&#34; a miniseries that brings to life Anne Bronte's classic novel. Pastoral beauty and simple village life are stained by the flashbacks to grotesque physical and mental abuse, and the story rests on an excellent trio of performances by Toby Stephens, Tara Fitzgerald and Rupert Graves.A mysterious woman and her young son move into the remote Wildfell Hall, without telling anyone of their arrival. Though the villagers are initially curious and welcoming, they eventually become hostile to Mrs. Helen Graham (Fitzgerald) because she doesn't act like a proper Victorian lady -- she's prickly, blunt, reclusive and opinionated, and seems incredibly protective of her young son Arthur. Furthermore, they suspect that she's having an affair with her landlord Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy).Yeoman farmer Gilbert Markham (Stephens) is immediately attracted to Helen, and manages to get under her armor enough to strike up an odd little friendship with her. But his ex-girlfriend Eliza spreads noxious rumors about Helen and Mr. Lawrence, and Gilbert becomes jealous.After he knocks Lawrence off his horse, an angered Helen gives him her diaries -- which reveal the horrifying, abusive marriage that she escaped from. As a naive young girl, she married the dashing rake Arthur Huntingdon (Graves), but soon learned that he was an abusive drunk who wanted her just for sex, and eventually loathed her for disapproving of his ways. Though Helen has escaped him, he's determined to get her and his son back...Anne Bronte's &#34;A Tenant of Wildfell Hall&#34; was an incredibly controversial novel in its time, and the miniseries more than does it justice. In fact, at times it ramps up the horror of Helen's grotesque marriage, such as when Arthur nearly rapes her while she is pregnant, or when she is forced to listen to her husband having sex with his longtime mistress.It's a stark contrast to the pastoral, weathered prettiness of the village; while Grassdale Manor is full of flickering firelight, rich colours and luxurious cloth, the countryside is full of mossy stones, grey skies and rolling grassy hills. Despite all the gossip, the countryside is a cleansing, purifying force.The entire first episode is devoted to stoking the mystery of who Helen is and why she's here, without giving any answers -- although there are plenty of hints (the spinning bird, her reaction to a Punch and Judy show). Once she gives her diaries to Gilbert, the backstory unfolds like a poisonous flower blooming, even as Gilbert goes to Grassdale to make a last impassioned plea to Helen.The cast in this miniseries is simply superb -- Stephens as a clear-eyed young farmer whose honesty and kindness attract Helen despite her bad experiences, and Fitzgerald as a fierce young woman who is determined to protect her son. They have a subtle, powerful chemistry in every scene they're in together, and you end up wanting nothing more than for them to end up together.On the other hand, Graves plays a monstrously sadistic man who draws in a young girl with his charm, then sprays her with hatred when she doesn't magically change to become just as depraved as he. Perhaps he's most hatable in two scenes -- when he teaches his young son to kill innocent animals, and when he grins sadistically at Gilbert after Gilbert fails to convince Helen to leave with him.&#34;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&#34; is a magnificent literary adaptation -- the acting is magnificent, the direction excellent, and the story a powerful one that still resonates today.",5,The mysterious lady of Wildfell,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,3813,"['1800s', 'abused', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'options', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'divorce', 'property', 'children', 'belonged', 'husband', 'society', 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'actually', 'got', 'murdered.And', 'haunting', 'idea', 'heart', '34', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', '34', 'miniseries', 'life', 'Anne', 'Bronte', 'classic', 'novel', 'Pastoral', 'beauty', 'simple', 'village', 'life', 'are', 'stained', 'flashbacks', 'grotesque', 'physical', 'mental', 'abuse', 'story', 'excellent', 'trio', 'performances', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Rupert', 'Graves.A', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'young', 'son', 'move', 'remote', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'telling', 'anyone', 'arrival', 'villagers', 'are', 'initially', 'curious', 'welcoming', 'eventually', 'become', 'hostile', 'Mrs.', 'Helen', 'Graham', 'Fitzgerald', ""n't"", 'act', 'proper', 'Victorian', 'lady', 'prickly', 'blunt', 'reclusive', 'opinionated', 'incredibly', 'protective', 'young', 'son', 'Arthur', 'Furthermore', 'suspect', 'having', 'affair', 'landlord', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'James', 'Purefoy', '.Yeoman', 'farmer', 'Gilbert', 'Markham', 'Stephens', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Helen', 'get', 'armor', 'enough', 'strike', 'up', 'odd', 'little', 'friendship', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Eliza', 'noxious', 'rumors', 'Helen', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'Gilbert', 'becomes', 'jealous.After', 'Lawrence', 'horse', 'angered', 'Helen', 'diaries', 'reveal', 'horrifying', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'escaped', 'naive', 'young', 'girl', 'married', 'dashing', 'rake', 'Arthur', 'Huntingdon', 'Graves', 'soon', 'learned', 'was', 'abusive', 'drunk', 'who', 'wanted', 'just', 'sex', 'eventually', 'loathed', 'disapproving', 'ways', 'Though', 'Helen', 'escaped', 'determined', 'get', 'son', 'back', 'Anne', 'Bronte', '34', 'A', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', '34', 'was', 'incredibly', 'controversial', 'novel', 'time', 'miniseries', 'more', 'justice', 'fact', 'times', 'up', 'horror', 'Helen', 'grotesque', 'marriage', 'such', 'when', 'Arthur', 'nearly', 'pregnant', 'when', 'forced', 'listen', 'husband', 'having', 'sex', 'longtime', 'mistress.It', 'stark', 'contrast', 'pastoral', 'weathered', 'prettiness', 'village', 'Grassdale', 'Manor', 'full', 'flickering', 'firelight', 'rich', 'colours', 'luxurious', 'cloth', 'countryside', 'full', 'mossy', 'stones', 'grey', 'skies', 'rolling', 'grassy', 'hills', 'gossip', 'countryside', 'cleansing', 'purifying', 'force.The', 'entire', 'first', 'episode', 'devoted', 'stoking', 'mystery', 'who', 'Helen', 'why', 'here', 'giving', 'answers', 'are', 'plenty', 'hints', 'spinning', 'bird', 'reaction', 'Punch', 'Judy', 'show', 'diaries', 'Gilbert', 'backstory', 'unfolds', 'poisonous', 'flower', 'blooming', 'even', 'Gilbert', 'Grassdale', 'make', 'last', 'impassioned', 'plea', 'Helen.The', 'cast', 'miniseries', 'simply', 'superb', 'clear-eyed', 'young', 'farmer', 'honesty', 'kindness', 'attract', 'Helen', 'bad', 'experiences', 'Fitzgerald', 'fierce', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'determined', 'protect', 'son', 'have', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'chemistry', 'scene', ""'re"", 'together', 'end', 'up', 'wanting', 'nothing', 'more', 'end', 'up', 'other', 'hand', 'Graves', 'monstrously', 'sadistic', 'man', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'charm', 'then', 'hatred', 'when', ""n't"", 'magically', 'change', 'become', 'just', 'as', 'depraved', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'hatable', 'two', 'scenes', 'when', 'young', 'son', 'kill', 'innocent', 'animals', 'when', 'sadistically', 'Gilbert', 'Gilbert', 'convince', 'Helen', 'leave', 'him.', '34', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', '34', 'magnificent', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'acting', 'magnificent', 'direction', 'excellent', 'story', 'powerful', 'one', 'still', 'today']",Tenant of Wildfell Hall VHS

It is the only one whose main character (Helen Graham) grew up a light-hearted girl with every advantage in life. Such a person would usually be seen as selfish and weak-willed in other Bronte novels, but as she deals with the new realities of married life, her intellect and spiritual power prove to be formidable. The advantages she was raised with seem to serve her with a deep inner knowledge that the customary place of a wife in Britain at that time is not for her. She does not hide nor apologize for her innocent love and devotion and does not make being a victim cheat her out of her living her own life. Although this rendition of the story is more pessimistic than I felt when reading the novel, I enjoyed it thoroughly and have enjoyed watching it several times.

430362,A14X9R4QBQZFIE,6304645635,Kerri Williamson,"[3, 3]","Every ounce the creative literary genius that her sisters were, Anne Bronte is too often the unsung Bronte sister. `Agnes Grey' is certainly a solidly written work of Anne's, full of many interesting details to enjoy; but since I first found and read `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' a number of years ago (in my search for all writings Bronte), I couldn't understand why that story of the mystery tenant wasn't every ounce the classic hit that `Jane Eyre' and `Wuthering Heights' had become. I don't mean to diminish the stellar writing styles and heights of either Charlotte or Emily Bronte, it's just that I simply cannot understand why Anne's equally marvelous writing has been so very overlooked, over time.I realize that some of the `other' (what some might call lesser) Bronte works don't quite have the romantic punch of `Jane Eyre' and `Wuthering Heights', but `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' surely does. (And a little tweaking by a good movie maker could make most Bronte works, work as romance dramas anyway.) Anne's `Tenant' tale is along the same lines as `Eyre' and `Wuthering', though perhaps not quite as melodramatic as those two classic stars by Charlotte and Emily. One thing that I find so compelling about `Tenant' is the realistic look at a substance-addicted selfish cheating abuser, and Anne writes that scenario as if she lived it closely and personally. (yes, her brother lived something like that kind of self-indulgent life and surely she drew from his sad example, and she did work around other people whom she might have drawn bad or good examples from, but she was a spinster who died young) Beyond the `gritty for those times' part of the story, there is enough of the romantic in `Tenant' to make any romantically inclined woman swoon. The `Tenant' has the romantic goods: the lady, her hero, and their true love story. `Tenant' has quickly become one of my top favorite novels, alongside `Eyre' (which has been a cherished favorite of mine for more than forty years) and several Jane Austen novels that are favorites to many women.There is such amazing writing in most (if not all, as far as I can recall) the Bronte Novels: many sentences that I must stop to read at least twice because they are so perfectly done. Even though I'm much more wired to be focused on the character-driven details rather than anything that remotely approaches purple prose or flowery fiction; the Bronte sisters' descriptives that paint scenes with skillful choices of words, make me stop and repeat for at least the second read through. But then again, I reread many of the Bronte sisters sentences. I am often thoroughly amazed at their skill with the English language. And then there is French and German in some of their prose as well (perhaps only Charlotte and Emily's). Yes, beyond their innate creative genius, they were definitely well educated (primed for the higher class governess trade, or to teach in better schools). I can confidently say that all three of the Bronte sisters win my utmost admiration for their highest levels of literature, and Anne Bronte stands as a true equal to her sisters in her winning effort of `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'.This movie of `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' with Toby Stevens and Tara Fitzgerald is a great introduction to Anne Bronte's amazing story and I hope it will point many people to her original masterpiece. (Make sure you get an unabridged copy, because my first read-through of the book was mistakenly an abridged version and that one felt quite disjointed and unfinished in a slightly distracting way. Something was missing, and I knew it. I've learned to always look for the `unabridged' stamp because in the case of these kinds of classics, there is nothing like the original.),  If you've read `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' novel or  listened to the audio-book once, twice or thrice, you will know how compressed this story is in the movie. Yes, of course the story had to be compressed to fit into the movie timeframe, though it is not a short movie for certain. One thing that stood out to me about the movie relative to the book is that certain aspects of the nasty husband are intensified: more harsh than the book, I would say. While the movie might not be exactly ideal for some younger ladies (such as young teens), the book is tamer and cleaner in that regard. Still, this movie helps tell the cautionary tale to teen girls and young women of some good reasons why not to marry such a `fixer-upper'. Toby Stevens does as excellent job as the hero and Tara Fitzgerald is equally superb as the heroine. I suppose Rupert Graves deserved kudos for his part, because he did make me hate him, and the abusive husband is definitely a hateful character, though perhaps not quite so thoroughly horrid and devilish in the book. After repeated viewings (and readings and listenings), I do find that I want to skip over the mid-section of the story, because I find it depressing and I want to jump towards the happy ending. All in all, I do highly recommend this movie, though I recommend the book and the Alex Jennings audio-book version all the more.Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author",5,Read the unabridged book or listen

Excellent cinematography, as well as strong performances by the entire cast, makes this a must see production for all lovers of period pieces.An intriguing widow woman of mystery, Helen Graham (Tara Fitzgerald), moves into a crumbling residence known as Wildfell Hall. There, she sets up house with her very young son. Plain spoken, independent, and seeming to lack charm, she rebuffs the initial, friendly overtures of the local townsfolk and manages to alienate most of them. Gilbert Markham (Toby Stephens), a young and handsome yeoman farmer, is not put off by her manner, however, and being smitten by her, pursues her, hoping to gain her affections. Soon, however, the townsfolk begin gossiping about her supposed assignations with a wealthy, local gentleman, Mr. Lawrence (James Purefoy), the owner of Wildfell Hall. There comes a point where even the steadfast Mr. Markham wavers in his belief in her. It is then that Mrs. Graham tells him the true nature of her relationship with Mr. Lawrence and reveals her dark past.Rupert Graves steals the show as Arthur Huntingdon, the charming rake who captures and seduces Helen's young, romantic heart. Once married to her, however, he reveals himself to be a brutish, dissolute, and depraved philanderer, who causes her to flee their home with their young son. The role of Huntingdon is, undoubtedly, the juiciest. The film uses the narrative contrivance of flashbacks in order to explain the events that led Helen to take the extraordinary measures that she did. It tells the viewer of the sad story that brought Helen and her son to this sorry pass. Ultimately, Helen takes the high road, when an event occurs that causes her past to collide with her present. In that decision, however, lies the key to her future.Toby Stephens is wonderful as the yeoman farmer, whose tender heart is captured by the beautiful Helen. Tara Fitsgerald, while indeed beautiful, plays the role of Helen a tad too harshly, which, while serving to alenate the townsfolk, serves also to alienate the viewer somewhat. Even though the flashbacks serve to explain her present manner, and the viewer sees her in happier days, Helen is still not as simpatico a character as she could or should be.

This film adaptation bowls me over.  Beside it, Tarantino and Scorsese are weak.  Somehow Tara Fitzgerald is able to 'grow' on screen from a blamelessly silly young woman to a bitterly experienced adult, and survives with no easy sudden solutions or evasions.  This must be her greatest role. Just one of the brief early scenes that had me rooted to my seat is when she challenges the bullying churchman, to his face, eye to eye, her voice not held back. This was 1848 for heaven's sake, and Anne Bronte had the guts to write it! The unrelenting strain between personal happiness, cruel marital suffering, and deep morality is so well directed.  Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntington is one of the most authentic psychopaths in film, and his ""enabling"" friends make one nauseous, because we know them today.  Supporting actors are terrific; I loved Paloma Baeza as Gilbert's witty sister, and the brutal Reverend Millward of Kenneth Cranham. For a 21st century audience it is awesome to follow Helen's committed and enduring care of her vile dying husband who is, as she insists, her husband.  Tara Fitzgerald superbly hits all the right notes, is convincing throughout, and like all great actors, says it with her face as much as with the script.  Two and a half hours; what a journey.

It soon unfolds that Helen is &quot;on the run&quot; from her privileged life and her cruel, alcoholic husband - Arthur Huntingdon -  and a series of flashbacks tell the story of her life with him.  The story itself is engrossing and, like Jane Eyre, it's ultimately a story of a strong woman overcoming the odds and coming out triumphant in the end.The BBC has done a great job with this production.  Tara Fitzgerald (&quot;The Woman in White,&quot; &quot;Brassed Off&quot;) is perfectly cast as the downtrodden but feisty Helen.  Handsome actors Toby Stephens (&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;) and Rupert Graves (&quot;Room with a View,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;) are excellent as the devoted Gilbert and the detestable Huntingdon.

True, changes were made from the original plot to adapt it to screen; but those changes do not inherently alter the plot and/or spirit of the work - those changes primarily consist of some added scenes that are implied rather than described, and also a changing of Helen returning to Wildfell Hall after Arthur Huntingdon's death rather than Gilbert going to seek her at her uncle's house.  And some lessening of some of the subplots and dialogue.  On the whole however, all the performances are excellent and each actor played the part as described by Bronte to perfection.  Toby Stephens and Tara Fitzgerald are truly excellent as Gilbert and Helen Huntingdon/""Mrs. Graham"" - the Tenant of Wildfell - who has escaped her debauched, abusive husband to try and rear her son away from the contaminating influence of his father.  BUT the performance that stands far and away above the others is Rupert Graves as Huntingdon - while the others are excellent - his is something like a volcano erupting on the screen.  I have NEVER seen such an amazing acting performance in my entire life by ANYONE as his performance as Huntingdon.

A past that is slowly unraveled with the pryings of a handsome, obsessed suitor.The actors are superb: Tara Fitzgerald(Helen), whom I simply adore as an actress, as the long suffering, fiel heroine with a lesson to learn and a son to protect, Rupert Graves(Arthur)as the depraved, never changing, rogue, 'Byron' whom she can't stop loving, and Toby Stephens(Gilbert) as the impetuous, immature, hero whom she wants to love, although cautiously.The director often shoots the scenes with sweeping, revolving panoramas about his actors, scenery desolate and wistful, the sets, costumes, and locations simply captivating and fitting for the mood.For whatever reason, I've always favored Anne, the youngest of the talented but tragic Bronte family.  She watched as three of her sisters including Emily, die from disease, her mother probably from uterine cancer and her 'shamed-the-family' brother deteriorate from alcohol.  Anne died in her 29th year. Her sister, Charlotte, died 6 years later at the ripe old age of 39.Anne loved to write poetry, but she also did two novels.  Her first,'Agnes Grey', which I wish some enlightened soul would make into a great movie, was lighter than 'The Tenant' with some Jane Austen-like contrivances and humor.  The story involved a governess reminescent of Anne's experience in child care. Charlotte didn't appreciate Austen and somewhat poo-pooed her 'baby' sister's work, but, nevertheless, took Anne's idea of a governess and ran with it in 'Jane Ayre'.'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' was Anne's jaunt into realism with a tough and disturbing tale about both the self-centerness of men who controlled everything in the world and the plight of women caught in their domain.  It apparently shocked the Victorian moralists of the day to have a novel about a woman standing up to her husband, shutting the sacred bedroom door to him and doing whatever to free herself.Anne ends the tale with a strong catharsis, and I would say an optimism (Austen-like? ""Charlotte, just get over it!"") that I believe represents her own determined and uplifting nature even in a difficult and short, earthly stay.  The movie makers provide an ending keeping, I think, in the spirit of Bronte; however, the  overall journey  really stresses one out, but then is quite satisfying.

A widow named Helen Graham--played skillfully by Tara Fitzgerald, along with her young son, move into an old estate and attempt to just live day to day, minding their own business.  The townspeople however, are very curious about the rather aloof newcomer and her overprotectiveness of her son.  Helen is a self dependant woman who sells her paintings to make a living, and does not wish to let strangers come too close.  One of the townspeople, Gilbert Markham--played by the ever handsome Toby Stephans, can not help but be drawn to Helen and wishes to learn more about her.  Helen hides a secret and eventually she shares it with Gilbert.  Helen is not the widow as she portrays.  She is married to a complete rake of a man, Arthur Huntingdon-played by the talented Rupert Graves, who has never been totally faithful to her. Arthur takes off months at a time to carouse with his buddies, leaving Helene alone to raise their infant son.  Later, when their son is a little older, the alcoholic Arthur and his band of goon friends force the boy to drink-which he promptly throws up-to make the boy become, ""a man"".  Arthur then hires a governess to teach the boy as punishment to Helen, keeping her away from the son she loves dearly, as she begins to despise what Arthur is doing to himself, their son and their marriage.  Finally having endured enough of Arthur's abuse and fearing for the safety and well being of her son, she, her maid and son make a mad dash to freedom and arrive at Wildfell Hall, where she assumes the dress of a widow to stay in hiding.  By the time Gilbert understands all that Helen has been through, Arthur has discovered where she is and brought her and their son back to their home.  There Helen stays, being faithful as always to her husband, and taking a stand against his abuse and infidelity.  Arthur is now gravely ill from years of alcohol and debauchery and Helen fires the governess, who was also an enabler to Arthur's alcoholism.  One of Arthur's friend's tries to put the moves on Helen, but she rebuffs him, telling him she made a promise to her husband to be faithful and for the man to never come back again. Gilbert comes to rescue her, telling her she is too good for her husband, but Helen is an honest, righteous woman, and though she cares for Gilbert, she can not, nor will not, cheat on her husband.  Eventually Arthur dies and Helen and her son return to Wildfell Hall.  ****SPOILER ALERT****  On the way to the hall, they spot a wedding reception going on in town and Helen sees Gilbert talking and laughing with a bride.  She assumes Gilbert got tired of waiting for her and married, and is saddened by this.  Gilbert is told by one of the guests at the reception that they saw Helen ride by in her coach.  He rushes off to see her and asks about her husband.  She tells him he has died and tells Gilbert congratulations on his wedding.  He explains that it wasn't he who got married but someone else.  So now these two, who have been growing in love, can now be free to be married.

This is not exactly a faithful representation, modern audience pleasing devices are used to give the story a hook. Sometimes this is necessary with Victorian novel adaptaions as issues which where then shocking now barely raise an eyebrow, but I think not so with Bronte work, the gritty realism of times past in their novels is actually more shocking now for it's utter cruelty. For my money, adding modern twists for hook value cheapens the work.Nonetheless, Graves is excellent and steals the show, Stevens is perfect as the romantic hereo but Fitzgerald is just a little too harsh, cold and unconvinsing.

430402,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,6304645635,Skywalker,"[2, 3]","I admit that this novel is more difficult to be turned into a film than e.g. ""Jane Eyre"", which was written by Anne Bronts sister Charlotte and already turned into films as well as theatre plays more than once. Usually one feels with Jane from the beginning on, since she is portrayed as a victim, while Helen's situation is mysterious at the beginning and clarified only after a while.In particular I believe that right before the opening titles of the film a few explanations concerning the laws and customs of the time it is set in would have been necessary (early 19th century) with regard to the situation and role of women in the English society of the time: The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" was received with an enormous scandal by the readers when it was first published since it is the story of a woman who leaves her husband. The marital vow ""for better for worse"" applied without exception then, even if, as in this case, the husband develops a drinking habit, beats his wife, humiliates her in public and wants to teach his son drinking and mindlessly killing animals, too. Usually, at the time a woman did not have the right on own property either and thus was at the mercy of some man - father, uncle, guardian, husband - all of her life. That Helen actually works to earn her living was for this reason also seen as scandalous. The situation of e.g. Jane Eyre is easier understandable for today's reader respectively viewer, since she is an orphan and remains unmarried until the novel's last chapter, which may explain perhaps why her story is by far more popular and universally understandable than the one about Helen Huntingdon, although it does not rank behind it in depth, tragedy and criticism against the society of the time: in both cases we are dealing with a woman struggling for her own independence and personal dignity against all the circumstances against her.I believe that the novel could have been made into a good and interesting film: but instead of emphasizing the social factors of the time in order to make Helens' situation more understandable, the authors rely on clich&eacute;s and cheap, trashy effects. Arthur's orgies are shown, once we have to witness how Arthur almost rapes Helen, the birth of their son is to be seen almost graphically; the child's fall into a crevice and subsequent rescue during a trip to the sea were never part of the novel, and Helen was not present when Gilbert beat her brother out of jealousy. At the end of the film we have not Gilbert who wrongly believes that Helen is getting married again, it is she who believes he is the groom; but the groom is her own brother, how high is the probability that she did not know he was to be married on this day?Helen was described as a very gifted painter in the novel, while we hardly see her works in the film; also she was depicted as extraordinarily beautiful, which one can unfortunately not say of Tara Fitzgerald. Additionally, she interprets her as a woman who is often short-tempered and fierce, instead of sweet and lovable; as a viewer your sometimes ask yourself why Gilbert falls in love with her at all.Arthur's companions are very important in the novel, but in the film their characterisation is very two-dimensional and they mostly seem to merge with the background, although the film is really long enough and would not have needed to be shortened on such important matters respectively characters. Helen's own friends, in particular Hattersley's later wife, the gentle, meek Milicent, and the self-assured Esther, appear only at the fringes and do not really play a role here. The entanglement around Lord Lowborough and Arthur's love affair with Lowborough's wife are wholly omitted, although they are very important in the novel. Hargrave, another example for a man who tortures Helen and does not acknowledge her for being herself, is also portrayed by far too wanly; and Gilbert is seen as an uncontrolled, impulsive man, so that as a viewer you can't but ask yourself why he of all people is supposed to be a better mate for Helen.Same thing as usual - quality pays the toll to the advantage of clich&eacute;s, and the plot does not become more interesting for that, on the contrary. Instead of actually reading the book, the producers have limited themselves to filter the book's most dramatic highlights, to invent a few new ones and to garnish all of it with nice pictures and settings and popular actors.A pity! I hope that this novel will sooner or later be turned into a film in a way that does it justice, because this film version definitively didn't come up to it.",2,Disappointing and almost boring (spoiler alert),1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,4607,"['admit', 'novel', 'more', 'difficult', 'be', 'turned', 'film', 'e.g', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'was', 'written', 'Anne', 'Bronts', 'sister', 'Charlotte', 'already', 'turned', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'theatre', 'more', 'once', 'Usually', 'one', 'feels', 'Jane', 'beginning', 'portrayed', 'victim', 'Helen', 'situation', 'mysterious', 'beginning', 'clarified', 'only', 'while.In', 'particular', 'believe', 'right', 'opening', 'titles', 'film', 'few', 'explanations', 'concerning', 'laws', 'customs', 'time', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'regard', 'situation', 'role', 'women', 'English', 'society', 'time', 'Tenant', 'Wildfell', 'Hall', 'was', 'received', 'enormous', 'scandal', 'readers', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'marital', 'vow', 'better', 'worse', 'applied', 'exception', 'then', 'even', 'case', 'husband', 'drinking', 'habit', 'wife', 'public', 'teach', 'son', 'drinking', 'mindlessly', 'killing', 'animals', 'too', 'Usually', 'time', 'woman', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'right', 'own', 'property', 'thus', 'was', 'mercy', 'man', 'father', 'uncle', 'guardian', 'husband', 'life', 'Helen', 'actually', 'earn', 'living', 'was', 'reason', 'also', 'seen', 'scandalous', 'situation', 'e.g', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'easier', 'understandable', 'today', 'reader', 'respectively', 'viewer', 'orphan', 'unmarried', 'novel', 'last', 'chapter', 'may', 'explain', 'perhaps', 'why', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'popular', 'universally', 'understandable', 'one', 'Helen', 'Huntingdon', 'not', 'rank', 'depth', 'tragedy', 'criticism', 'society', 'time', 'cases', 'are', 'dealing', 'woman', 'struggling', 'own', 'independence', 'personal', 'dignity', 'circumstances', 'her.I', 'believe', 'novel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'good', 'interesting', 'film', 'instead', 'emphasizing', 'social', 'factors', 'time', 'order', 'make', 'Helens', 'situation', 'more', 'understandable', 'authors', 'rely', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cheap', 'trashy', 'effects', 'Arthur', 'orgies', 'are', 'shown', 'once', 'have', 'witness', 'how', 'Arthur', 'almost', 'Helen', 'birth', 'son', 'be', 'seen', 'almost', 'graphically', 'child', 'fall', 'crevice', 'subsequent', 'rescue', 'trip', 'sea', 'were', 'never', 'part', 'novel', 'Helen', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'when', 'Gilbert', 'beat', 'brother', 'jealousy', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'Gilbert', 'who', 'wrongly', 'Helen', 'getting', 'married', 'again', 'who', 'groom', 'groom', 'own', 'brother', 'how', 'high', 'probability', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'be', 'married', 'day', 'Helen', 'was', 'described', 'very', 'gifted', 'painter', 'novel', 'hardly', 'see', 'works', 'film', 'also', 'was', 'depicted', 'extraordinarily', 'beautiful', 'one', 'can', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'say', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'Additionally', 'woman', 'who', 'often', 'short-tempered', 'fierce', 'instead', 'sweet', 'lovable', 'viewer', 'sometimes', 'ask', 'why', 'Gilbert', 'love', 'all.Arthur', 'companions', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'novel', 'film', 'characterisation', 'very', 'two-dimensional', 'mostly', 'seem', 'merge', 'background', 'film', 'really', 'long', 'enough', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'needed', 'be', 'shortened', 'such', 'important', 'matters', 'respectively', 'characters', 'Helen', 'own', 'friends', 'particular', 'Hattersley', 'later', 'wife', 'gentle', 'meek', 'Milicent', 'self-assured', 'Esther', 'appear', 'only', 'fringes', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'play', 'role', 'here', 'entanglement', 'Lord', 'Lowborough', 'Arthur', 'love', 'affair', 'Lowborough', 'wife', 'are', 'wholly', 'omitted', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'novel', 'Hargrave', 'example', 'man', 'who', 'Helen', 'not', 'acknowledge', 'being', 'also', 'portrayed', 'far', 'too', 'wanly', 'Gilbert', 'seen', 'uncontrolled', 'impulsive', 'man', 'so', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'people', 'supposed', 'be', 'better', 'mate', 'Helen.Same', 'thing', 'usual', 'quality', 'toll', 'advantage', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'not', 'become', 'more', 'interesting', 'contrary', 'Instead', 'actually', 'reading', 'book', 'producers', 'have', 'limited', 'filter', 'book', 'most', 'dramatic', 'highlights', 'invent', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'garnish', 'nice', 'pictures', 'settings', 'popular', 'actors.A', 'pity', 'hope', 'novel', 'will', 'sooner', 'later', 'be', 'turned', 'film', 'way', 'justice', 'film', 'version', 'definitively', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up']",Tenant of Wildfell Hall VHS

430404,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6304645635,Stephanie De Pue,"[50, 51]","""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" a feature-length 1996 television costume drama produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, was seen here on broadcast TV in 1997.  It was based upon the little-known book of the same name, published in 1848, by the Victorian-era British author Anne Bronte.  She is the least-known of the three famous Bronte sisters, all of whom specialized in moody works set on England's scenic moors, upon which they were raised.  Emily Bronte, of course, gave usWuthering Heights; Charlotte,Jane Eyre. And some of us probably can't help thinking that were Anne not a Bronte, this work would neither have survived, nor have been adapted for television, as it's rather heavy going.It concerns Helen Huntingdon, in flight from an alcoholic, brutal, but wealthy and high-status husband, Arthur Huntington.  She has taken her young son Arthur, and taken up residence, as the dour and mysterious Mrs. Helen Graham, in a rundown Hall on the moors.  It's not long before a handsome young yeoman farmer of the vicinity, Gilbert Markham, takes an interest in her, and her son.  It's also not long before malicious gossip about her begins to circulate around the isolated village to which she has moved.Much of the movie is set on the moors, and it has received the typical lush BBC treatment in the matters of location shooting, costumes, set decoration, carriages, etc.  Unfortunately, while the camera whirls around and around, it doesn't succeed in making the production any less static.  Mind you, I see where some other reviewers have complained about gratuitous scenes of sex and violence thrown in; but some of us may find them a bit of a relief.  And the frequent flashbacks can be a major source of confusion.Furthermore, let's be perfectly clear about this: the underlying 1848 book was an important early proto-feminist document.  I've not read it for many a year, but its filmed treatment lays out mercilessly the frustrating, restricted lives of women at that time, ranging from suffering under benign domestic tyranny, to their extreme difficulties in making independent livings, or living independently, to the fact that, upon marriage, a woman, her money, and any children she might have, became the property of her husband.  On those grounds, book, and any treatment thereof deserve respect.  But surely not affection.Tara Fitzgerald (Waking the Dead); stars as Helen: she's a beautiful woman, high of cheekbone; her beauty survives even a possibly historically accurate, but surely unfortunate hairdo.  She's also a very likable actress; it was an excellent idea to cast her as the not-easy-to-like Helen, preachy, holier-than-thou, and severe. In fact, Helen can perhaps best be compared to the 20th century American figure Carrie Nation.  Many of us may agree that Ms. Nation's heart was in the right place.  She was a suffragist; she opposed the consumption of alcohol because she thought it had many undesirable results.  And let's say we're in agreement with her: still,Carrie with her axe, laying waste to bars, in support of Prohibition,could not have been a pleasant sight.  And, at times, Helen Huntingdon seems only to lack the axe.  (So let us not forget that  Bronte pere was a clergyman, and, in fact, must have been one tough old bird: in his seventies, one day, he drank down a bottle of brandy, then submitted to what must have been an excruciatingly painful cataract operation.)  Well, anyway, a modern audience may have trouble deciding who'd be most unpleasant to live with, Helen; or her hell-bound husband Arthur.  As beautifully played by the handsome Rupert Graves  (V for Vendetta); he clearly is dissolute, and will come to an early, bad end; but he's charismatic, recognizes his own limitations; gives every sign of having a sense of humor, even about himself.  (It seems likely that the author modeled him on the fourth Bronte child, the only boy, Branwell.  That weak young Bronte, son of a clergyman and in a household of brilliant women, was an alcoholic, an opium eater, and died at age 31.)Toby Stephens (Jane Eyre)  is a handsome, sexy Gilbert Markham, yearning to lighten up Helen and her life: he lights up quite a few scenes.  And Pam Ferris (Rosemary & Thyme - The Complete Series) does good work as his mother, Mrs. Markham.  As to the DePue subtitles report: thank goodness, the production has them, as you're getting all kinds of country accents.  But the BBC has again made the subtitles rather tricky to access.

He plays the role to the tee, and adds (in the disturbing flashback scenes) an almost creepy edge to the film.  The fact that these flashbacks involve a child that Fitzgerald is protecting, makes them all the more unnerving.I found the film to be engrossing - You cringe to watch the deplorable abuses and yet yearn to discover how things happened and where they will end.

What the DVD misses is the bleakness and the loneliness and mysteriousness of Helen's situation on her own -- a single woman on her own was desperately threatening in those days -- everything in this film is busy all the time.  One longs for just a minute or two of stillness -- but you can't do that on TV these days.  The chattering and swooping just cuts into the moodiness that the book, with all its overdoneness, still evokes.  The part of Gilbert is hell to do, and I found Stephens boring, but Gilbert is pretty boring all round.  Rupert Graves was excellent:  you could just see how impossible it was to leave him, and how prissy Helen could be.  Another thing you can't do much of these days is religion, but her struggle with Huntington over his soul was, for Anne, probably the most important part of the book -- and needed to be emphasized more. My only strong reservation about Tara Fitzgerald was her pulledback hairdo.

The blast furnaces spewed ashes over the town several times a day, and we didn't know anything but smoky, smelly, overcast skies - except when it rained or snowed which cleaned the air for a while. But a few hours after the snow ended it became black from the ash. Not exactly the scene from a Christmas card.There were four sets of railroad tracks between our house and the river, and the trains ran all the time carrying war materiels. There was a lot of drunkenness, gambling, fighting, wife beating, and other violence. This is probably the real reason that blackouts and a curfew were imposed - to try to keep people under control.Georgie, my next door neighbor and best friend's mother was shot six times one summer evening by her drunken, enraged husband. Georgie and his two older sisters became wards of the state and I never saw them again.I tell you this because I have not recalled these events for many, many years until watching 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'.
