40142,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0782006760,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[25, 26]","One of the immortal Cary Grant's last films, this particular one is a romantic, witty little gem. Well-scripted, well-acted, and full of really weird humor, this is one to treasure.Walter Eckland has no intention of getting himself involved in World War II -- no intention, that is, until he is ""drafted"" into service to the Allies. Basically he needs to keep an eye open for the Japanese. He reluctantly obeys, but his mission suddenly takes a weird turn when he rescues a slew of civilians: the prim, devious schoolteacher Miss Freneau, and her seven little girl charges. Before Eckland knows what's happening, they've taken over his little house, his clothes, his food -- and his whisky. (It's the last one that really makes him nuts) To his horror, they won't be picked up for at least three weeks.An extended, very witty battle of the sexes takes place, as Miss Freneau dodges and weaves around Eckland, and Eckland tries to retain some mastery over his domain. But a series of crises (comical and serious) force Eckland and Freneau not only to deal with the Japanese, but also with each other.Cary Grant shows more of his versatility in this film, since his comical talents are usually passed by in favor of his rugged sexiness. That sexiness is buried in this one, under the scraggliness of a beachcomber who is rebelling against the world with alcohol. Revelations about his past are somehow quite appropriate; as a character in another of Grant's movies said, ""you have unexpected depth.""Leslie Caron, whom I had previously seen only in ""Gigi,"" is also in rare form here. She makes Miss Freneau both sympathetic and mildly repressed, with a dry wit and a very devious mind. She also manages one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in a movie, where Miss Freneau gets drunk after being bitten by a snake. Her acrobatics (""Ooooooh, is it getting hot in here?""), weird confessions (""I'm a picture straightener!"") and the occasional lapse into insanity (""Tell me, I want to know, what did my blood taste like?"") are too funny for words.Other highlights include the chaplain and the accordian player, and the delightfully deadpan Trevor Howard as a Navy commander who's not afraid to play dirty. The writing is excellent; the mutual realizations by Freneau and Eckland may seem a little hasty and contrived, but that can be easily passed by.This is fine to watch with the kiddies -- there is virtually no profanity, no smut, a little non-bloody violence, and children will probably enjoy the antics of the seven little girls (such as the of-repeated whine ""I wanna go home!""). There is one scene of drunkenness, however, and we are treated to sly indicators of more mature material (""he... he made a GESTURE, sir!"" ""Oooh, he called the captain a dirty name""). The little girls themselves are remarkably well-acted by believable child actors, except for the oldest one. One particular highlight is the little girl who keeps biting Eckland's hand.Recommended especially for romantic comedy fans, and for fans of Caron and Grant. Or simply watch if you're in the mood for fun.",5,"""Is it getting hot in here?""",1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,3081,"['One', 'immortal', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'last', 'films', 'particular', 'one', 'romantic', 'witty', 'little', 'gem', 'Well-scripted', 'well-acted', 'full', 'really', 'weird', 'humor', 'one', 'treasure.Walter', 'Eckland', 'intention', 'getting', 'involved', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'intention', 'drafted', 'service', 'Allies', 'Basically', 'keep', 'eye', 'open', 'Japanese', 'reluctantly', 'mission', 'suddenly', 'weird', 'turn', 'when', 'slew', 'civilians', 'prim', 'devious', 'schoolteacher', 'Miss', 'Freneau', 'seven', 'little', 'girl', 'charges', 'Eckland', 'what', 'happening', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'over', 'little', 'house', 'clothes', 'food', 'whisky', 'last', 'one', 'really', 'nuts', 'horror', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'least', 'three', 'weeks.An', 'extended', 'very', 'witty', 'battle', 'sexes', 'place', 'Miss', 'Freneau', 'dodges', 'weaves', 'Eckland', 'Eckland', 'tries', 'retain', 'mastery', 'domain', 'series', 'crises', 'comical', 'serious', 'force', 'Eckland', 'Freneau', 'not', 'only', 'deal', 'Japanese', 'also', 'other.Cary', 'Grant', 'more', 'versatility', 'film', 'comical', 'talents', 'are', 'usually', 'passed', 'favor', 'rugged', 'sexiness', 'sexiness', 'buried', 'one', 'scraggliness', 'beachcomber', 'who', 'rebelling', 'world', 'alcohol', 'Revelations', 'past', 'are', 'somehow', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'character', 'Grant', 'movies', 'said', 'have', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'whom', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'only', 'Gigi', 'also', 'rare', 'form', 'here', 'Miss', 'Freneau', 'sympathetic', 'mildly', 'repressed', 'dry', 'wit', 'very', 'devious', 'mind', 'also', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'where', 'Miss', 'Freneau', 'drunk', 'being', 'bitten', 'snake', 'acrobatics', 'Ooooooh', 'getting', 'hot', 'here', 'weird', 'confessions', ""'m"", 'picture', 'straightener', 'occasional', 'lapse', 'insanity', 'Tell', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'blood', 'taste', 'are', 'too', 'funny', 'words.Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'chaplain', 'accordian', 'player', 'delightfully', 'deadpan', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'Navy', 'commander', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'play', 'dirty', 'writing', 'excellent', 'mutual', 'realizations', 'Freneau', 'Eckland', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'hasty', 'contrived', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'passed', 'by.This', 'fine', 'watch', 'kiddies', 'virtually', 'profanity', 'smut', 'little', 'non-bloody', 'violence', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'antics', 'seven', 'little', 'girls', 'such', 'of-repeated', 'whine', 'wan', 'go', 'home', 'one', 'scene', 'drunkenness', 'however', 'are', 'treated', 'sly', 'indicators', 'more', 'mature', 'material', 'made', 'GESTURE', 'sir', 'Oooh', 'called', 'captain', 'dirty', 'name', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'remarkably', 'well-acted', 'believable', 'child', 'actors', 'oldest', 'one', 'One', 'particular', 'highlight', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'biting', 'Eckland', 'hand.Recommended', 'especially', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fans', 'fans', 'Caron', 'Grant', 'simply', 'watch', ""'re"", 'mood', 'fun']",N/A

40144,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0782006760,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","I have a certain fondness for this 1964 movie because it is one of the earliest I remember seeing in the back of my parents' 1963 Rambler station wagon at the now-defunct Burlingame Drive-In near San Francisco. The film's catchy theme song, ""Pass Me By"", was in my head for years. In the intervening years, I have come to recognize Cary Grant's immaculate precision as a comic actor, and even playing a grizzled, alcoholic beachcomber like Walter Eckland, he still exudes the sharp wit and crack timing that is his hallmark. In fact, Grant is at the top of his game here.Sharply written by Peter Stone and Frank Tarloff, the story revolves around Eckland's futile attempts to remain reclusive aboard his boat tooling around the South Pacific. Unfortunately, WWII is raging on, and the British Navy need to use him as a hidden spotter of Japanese fighter planes. He is tricked into the role and remains shipwrecked manning his post on an isolated island. Enter Catherine Freneau, a priggish French schoolteacher, who has been stranded on another island with seven schoolgirls. Eckland fetches them, and they all cohabitate with inevitable shenanigans occurring.Director Ralph Nelson, who generally made relatively lightweight fare, keeps the story fairly facile until they come under attack and a suspenseful element is carried through to the end. In what turned out to be his last leading role, romantic or otherwise, Grant was applauded at the time for dispensing with his suave manner to inhabit this character, but actually it's a throwback to the everyman characters he played in ""Only Angels Have Wings"" and ""Gunga Din"". The difference is that at age sixty, he displays his talents as both romantic comedy lead and action hero with such seasoned adroitness.As Catherine, Leslie Caron demonstrates just how greatly underrated she is as a comedy actress. Even though her character threatens to be strenuously rigid, she conveys Catherine's vulnerability with subtle nuance and also has a very funny drunk scene where she gets to show off her ballet dancer gams. Grant and Caron have great chemistry. Trevor Howard dryly plays Eckland's friendly adversary, Commander Houghton, who transmits instructions by ham radio, and the girls are all gratefully portrayed with individual personalities. I have always been impressed how this film maintains its light heart and humor even though it's clear that the wartime setting is a critical element of the plot.

I could not help but think as I watched this film that Cary Grant really stood his ground as an actor because the seven little girls really could have stole this picture away from most adult actors.

40157,A276M3NSIY9B82,0782006760,Harry Brewer,"[1, 1]","Father Goose is a classic comedy that just barely misses being essential. Cary Grant was a versatile actor, able to do drama & comedy equally. Father Goose was Grant's penultimate film. Grant is cast against his normal screen personna; normally, he's suave, debonair, sophisticated &, most of all, clean. In this film he's anything but those.Walter Eckland (Cary Grant) is an American in the South Pacific during an early part of WWII. He's been there for years & knows the area very well. Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) needs to replace a spotter but doesn't have any alternatives but Eckland; this is due, in part, of being in the middle of an evacuation to avoid being overrun & captured by the Japanese. Eckland, of course, is unwilling, he's ""made his peace with the world"" & doesn't understand why the world can't be at peace with itself. Houghton finally convinces Eckland to do the job after threatening to confiscate his boat. Houghton, knowing that Eckland can't be trusted, follows him to the island to ensure that he will man his post. Houghton also knows the minute he leaves Eckland will desert his post so Houghton intentionally damages Eckland's boat by ""accidentally"" colliding with it. Houghton has also ensured Eckland's loyalty by including several cases of Scotch in the supplies left on the island. Knowing that Eckland will not be cooperative Houghton has had the Scotch hid (by the bottle) in many different locations on the island. When Eckland calls in a sighting then Houghton will tell him where a bottle of Scotch is hidden. The catch to this is that the sighting must be confirmed by another spotter before the location of a bottle of Scotch will be revealed. This keeps Eckland honest which is the last thing he might be.Some of the movie's appeal is in the hands of Lt. Stebbins (Jack Good) who's very much by the book & somewhat prudish. He insists t hat the call signs be used: Briar Patch, Big Bad Wolf, Little Bo Peep & Mother Goose. Eckland will not do any of this & Houghton knows it so he & Eckland uses their respective first names. In an effort to rescue another spotter Houghton sends Eckland to extract him. When Eckland gets there he finds only Catherine Freneaux (Leslie Caron) & seven female children of various ages that are in her charge. Eckland gets them back to his island & this is where the funniest moments of the film occur. Eckland wants them gone immediately but Houghton tells him it wilk take three to four weeks before they can be removed.Freneaux takes charge of things & drives Eckland out of his hut. She demands that he not drink in front of the children but he's not willing to comply. Then she hides all the Scotch from him. This part of the film is typical Hollywood: Man & woman are complete opposites, they don't like each other, then they fall in love. The writing team of Peter Stone & Frank Tarloff elevate this above the ordinary, there are very funny moments that are anything but trite or banal. They've written a screenplay that will appeal to older & younger viewers alike.The movie was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Story & Best Sound), but only winning Best Original Screenplay.",4,Father Goose,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,3217,"['Father', 'Goose', 'classic', 'comedy', 'just', 'barely', 'being', 'essential', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'versatile', 'actor', 'able', 'do', 'drama', 'comedy', 'equally', 'Father', 'Goose', 'was', 'Grant', 'penultimate', 'film', 'Grant', 'cast', 'normal', 'screen', 'personna', 'normally', 'suave', 'debonair', 'sophisticated', 'most', 'clean', 'film', 'anything', 'those.Walter', 'Eckland', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'American', 'South', 'Pacific', 'early', 'part', 'WWII', 'been', 'there', 'years', 'area', 'very', 'well', 'Commander', 'Frank', 'Houghton', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'replace', 'spotter', ""n't"", 'have', 'alternatives', 'Eckland', 'due', 'part', 'being', 'middle', 'evacuation', 'avoid', 'being', 'overrun', 'captured', 'Japanese', 'Eckland', 'course', 'unwilling', 'made', 'peace', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'peace', 'Houghton', 'finally', 'Eckland', 'do', 'job', 'threatening', 'confiscate', 'boat', 'Houghton', 'knowing', 'Eckland', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'island', 'ensure', 'will', 'man', 'post', 'Houghton', 'also', 'minute', 'Eckland', 'will', 'desert', 'post', 'Houghton', 'intentionally', 'damages', 'Eckland', 'boat', 'accidentally', 'colliding', 'Houghton', 'also', 'ensured', 'Eckland', 'loyalty', 'including', 'several', 'cases', 'Scotch', 'supplies', 'left', 'island', 'Knowing', 'Eckland', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'cooperative', 'Houghton', 'had', 'Scotch', 'hid', 'bottle', 'many', 'different', 'locations', 'island', 'When', 'Eckland', 'sighting', 'then', 'Houghton', 'will', 'tell', 'where', 'bottle', 'Scotch', 'hidden', 'catch', 'sighting', 'must', 'be', 'confirmed', 'spotter', 'location', 'bottle', 'Scotch', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'Eckland', 'honest', 'last', 'thing', 'might', 'be.Some', 'movie', 'appeal', 'hands', 'Lt.', 'Stebbins', 'Jack', 'Good', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'book', 'somewhat', 'prudish', 'hat', 'call', 'signs', 'be', 'used', 'Briar', 'Patch', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'Little', 'Bo', 'Peep', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'Eckland', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'Houghton', 'Eckland', 'respective', 'first', 'names', 'effort', 'rescue', 'spotter', 'Houghton', 'Eckland', 'extract', 'When', 'Eckland', 'there', 'only', 'Catherine', 'Freneaux', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'seven', 'female', 'children', 'various', 'ages', 'are', 'charge', 'Eckland', 'back', 'island', 'where', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'occur', 'Eckland', 'gone', 'immediately', 'Houghton', 'wilk', 'take', 'three', 'four', 'weeks', 'can', 'be', 'removed.Freneaux', 'charge', 'things', 'drives', 'Eckland', 'hut', 'not', 'drink', 'front', 'children', 'not', 'willing', 'comply', 'Then', 'Scotch', 'part', 'film', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'Man', 'woman', 'are', 'complete', 'opposites', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'then', 'fall', 'love', 'writing', 'team', 'Peter', 'Stone', 'Frank', 'Tarloff', 'elevate', 'ordinary', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'anything', 'trite', 'banal', ""'ve"", 'written', 'screenplay', 'will', 'appeal', 'older', 'younger', 'viewers', 'alike.The', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'four', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Editing', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Story', 'Best', 'Sound', 'only', 'winning', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay']",N/A
40158,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0782006760,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","By the time Cary Grant, had celebrated his 60th birthday in 1964, he knew it was past time he moved away from his typically elegant lead roles. Accordingly, in the romantic comedy FATHER GOOSE, which is set in WW2, he plays boozing and cantankerous hermit slob Walter Eckland, who is dragooned into the Coastal Watching Service by the Royal Navy and given the code name Mother Goose. He's assigned an island in the Pacific, where he must keep a weather eye out and radio in Japanese plane and ship movements. As an incentive, bottles of whiskey have been stashed all over the isle, and every confirmed enemy sighting from Eckland is compensated with the divulgence of a whiskey bottle's whereabouts.So, as things stand, matters suck for the surly Eckland, but he is propelled to further heights of aggravation when his island post is invaded by French school mistress Catherine Frenau (Leslie Caron) and her coterie of seven young schoolgirls. From the onset, Eckland and Frenau are engaged in a battle of the sexes as the callous Eckland only wishes to be left alone while Miss Frenau insists on imposing on his time, his hut, and his sundry belongings in order to fend for her charges. And just when Eckland believes that things can't possibly get any worse, the prim and proper Miss Frenau confiscates all the whiskey. So will our hero ever get another sip of booze or be reduced to imbibing coconut juice? Will the kids ever earn the old reprobate's affection? Will he and the French school mistress fall in love? Does a bear crap in the woods?Cary Grant evidently had wanted Audrey Hepburn for the role of Catherine Frenau, having vastly enjoyed his time with her during CHARADE. Hepburn, however, had prior commitments and, so, Leslie Caron (GIGI, DADDY LONG LEGS) came on board. Caron proves to be appealing in her portrayal of the strait-laced Catherine, and, of course, she's even more ideal for the part in the sense that she actually is French. Her prudish character (she's also a compulsive picture straightener) is offset by her sense of humor, her charm, and her sincere concern for the children. And her legs. Leslie Caron isn't exactly hideous on the eyes.Cary Grant is still Cary Grant, even at 60 years of age. Unshaven and attired in a bedraggled state for the length of the film, he, nevertheless, exudes a timeless presence. Stripped of his well-bred sophistication, he still has his innate wit and unique style and delivery. Cary Grant without his posh wardrobe is still immensely entertaining, and, even though this isn't his best effort, there are moments here where he's still very capable of making you wish you were him. Also nicely done are his interactions with the kids. He doesn't play it false by behaving nicely and wholesomely towards the children as that would've been opposite to his role's ill-tempered nature. Credit also goes to the wry performance of Trevor Howard, who plays Commander Frank Houghton.Even though 27 years separate the two leads in age, there is ample chemistry between the two to make the romantic pairing credible. The pixielike loveliness of Caron and the charisma and impeccable timing of Grant, as well as a pleasing, light-hearted story that Disney would've tortured members of the Mickey Mouse Club to get the rights to, all combine to make FATHER GOOSE an old-fashioned and comedic love story. No, it's not quite a classic, but it does showcase a classic star, who, even at the nadir of his career, still has the wherewithal to get the girl and win the audience. Is it a wonder the American Film Institute named him the second Greatest Male Star of All Time in American cinema (the first being Bogie)?",4,"""This is the filthy beast speaking...""",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,3665,"['time', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'had', 'celebrated', '60th', 'birthday', '1964', 'knew', 'was', 'past', 'time', 'moved', 'away', 'typically', 'elegant', 'lead', 'roles', 'Accordingly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'FATHER', 'GOOSE', 'set', 'WW2', 'boozing', 'cantankerous', 'hermit', 'slob', 'Walter', 'Eckland', 'who', 'dragooned', 'Coastal', 'Watching', 'Service', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'given', 'code', 'name', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'assigned', 'island', 'Pacific', 'where', 'must', 'keep', 'weather', 'eye', 'radio', 'Japanese', 'plane', 'ship', 'movements', 'incentive', 'bottles', 'whiskey', 'have', 'been', 'stashed', 'isle', 'confirmed', 'enemy', 'sighting', 'Eckland', 'compensated', 'divulgence', 'whiskey', 'bottle', 'whereabouts.So', 'things', 'stand', 'matters', 'suck', 'surly', 'Eckland', 'propelled', 'further', 'heights', 'aggravation', 'when', 'island', 'post', 'invaded', 'French', 'school', 'mistress', 'Catherine', 'Frenau', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'coterie', 'seven', 'young', 'schoolgirls', 'onset', 'Eckland', 'Frenau', 'are', 'engaged', 'battle', 'sexes', 'callous', 'Eckland', 'only', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'Miss', 'Frenau', 'imposing', 'time', 'hut', 'sundry', 'belongings', 'order', 'fend', 'charges', 'just', 'when', 'Eckland', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'get', 'worse', 'prim', 'proper', 'Miss', 'Frenau', 'whiskey', 'So', 'will', 'hero', 'ever', 'get', 'sip', 'booze', 'be', 'reduced', 'imbibing', 'coconut', 'juice', 'Will', 'kids', 'ever', 'earn', 'old', 'reprobate', 'affection', 'Will', 'French', 'school', 'mistress', 'fall', 'love', 'bear', 'crap', 'woods', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'evidently', 'had', 'wanted', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'role', 'Catherine', 'Frenau', 'having', 'vastly', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'CHARADE', 'Hepburn', 'however', 'had', 'prior', 'commitments', 'so', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'GIGI', 'DADDY', 'LONG', 'LEGS', 'came', 'board', 'Caron', 'be', 'appealing', 'portrayal', 'strait-laced', 'Catherine', 'course', 'even', 'more', 'ideal', 'part', 'sense', 'actually', 'French', 'prudish', 'character', 'also', 'compulsive', 'picture', 'straightener', 'offset', 'sense', 'humor', 'charm', 'sincere', 'concern', 'children', 'legs', 'Leslie', 'Caron', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hideous', 'eyes.Cary', 'Grant', 'still', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'even', '60', 'years', 'age', 'Unshaven', 'attired', 'bedraggled', 'state', 'length', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'timeless', 'presence', 'Stripped', 'well-bred', 'sophistication', 'still', 'innate', 'wit', 'unique', 'style', 'delivery', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'posh', 'wardrobe', 'still', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'even', ""n't"", 'best', 'effort', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'where', 'still', 'very', 'capable', 'making', 'wish', 'were', 'Also', 'nicely', 'done', 'are', 'interactions', 'kids', ""n't"", 'play', 'false', 'behaving', 'nicely', 'wholesomely', 'children', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'opposite', 'role', 'ill-tempered', 'nature', 'Credit', 'also', 'wry', 'performance', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'who', 'Commander', 'Frank', 'Houghton.Even', '27', 'years', 'separate', 'two', 'leads', 'age', 'ample', 'chemistry', 'two', 'make', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'credible', 'pixielike', 'loveliness', 'Caron', 'charisma', 'impeccable', 'timing', 'Grant', 'as', 'well', 'pleasing', 'light-hearted', 'story', 'Disney', 'would', ""'ve"", 'tortured', 'members', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'get', 'rights', 'combine', 'make', 'FATHER', 'GOOSE', 'old-fashioned', 'comedic', 'love', 'story', 'No', 'not', 'quite', 'classic', 'showcase', 'classic', 'star', 'who', 'even', 'nadir', 'career', 'still', 'wherewithal', 'get', 'girl', 'win', 'audience', 'wonder', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'named', 'second', 'Greatest', 'Male', 'Star', 'All', 'Time', 'American', 'cinema', 'first', 'being', 'Bogie']",N/A

Directed with a light touch by Ralph Nelson, he wisely lets Grant do his thing and let's the script speak for itself.

""Father Goose,"" the 1964 collaboration of Cary Grant and Leslie Caron, is one film that ages well, if not absolutely perfectly.The film is set in the South Pacific during World War II. Grant plays Walter Eckland, a harmless misanthrope who is doing his best to stay out of the war. He is happy to tool around in his boat and drink whiskey all day. But the world starts to crowd in on him, first in the person of Commander Frank Houghton, the bemused and bandy-legged commodore of a British destroyer intent on getting Eckland involved in the fight against the Japanese. Then there is Caron and her charge of young girls, the daughters of diplomats assigned to the South Pacific. The cast is superb and the humor still fresh. There's just enough of an element of danger (from a Japanese patrol boat and planes) to keep everyone on their toes. There's plenty of good-natured grumpiness and sparks between Grant and Caron to make their relationship interesting. Even the controversy about Grant's sexual orientation do not take away from the masculine attractiveness that was his stock-in-trade. The only plot device that hasn't survived is Eckland's overreliance (and how!) on whiskey. Oh, and a few face slaps that he and Caron administer to each other. Alcoholism and domestic abuse have (mostly) lost their use as a comic devices in the last 40-odd years.Still, ""Father Goose"" is decent, humorous and generally harmless.

But he didn't want that & he only did one more movie before retiring. He felt his days as a leading man were gone. They weren't really but maybe it was vanity. He didn't want to grow old in front of the camera. Even so his good looks are still evident despite his slovenly, unshaved, unkempt character, Walter. He is a ""filthy beast"". He's an advanced plane spotter on a deserted jungle island surrounded by the Japanese in WW II. That, plus the fact that he is a drunk, with a good supply of scotch keeps him there. His lonely paradise is shattered when he is obliged to rescue Leslie Caron, a governess with seven school-girls of various sizes, to care for. He now has a new enemy as his living quarters, food supply & most importantly his booze are put in jeopardy. Leslie Caron is cute as ever. She is a ""Miss Goody-Two-Shoes"" & determined to set a good example for the girls. Walter is not & is banished from his home. It appears this will be a long-term situation. However, he begins to capture the affection of the girls as a father figure. He & Leslie Caron fall in love as they plan a life together in the Pacific after the war.

I saw it once again on the telly this past weekend while doing the ironing, and I'm fortunate to be old enough to have an appreciation of all three films.Grant is Walter Eckland, an antisocial, unkempt escapee from ""civilization"" that spends his time bumming around the South Seas on an old yacht. At the start of WWII, he's coerced into service as a ""coast watcher"", an observer stationed on a remote island as a lookout for Japanese planes or ships, by the wily and dry-witted local Royal Australian Navy authority figure, Comdr. Houghton (Howard). Eckland is bribed with booze to perform in His Majesty's service. One of his first assignments is to boat over to another island and rescue a fellow coast watcher. But, on arriving, he finds only his colleague's grave and the Caron character, Catherine Freneau, the daughter of a French government official, who's been stranded with a bevy of underage schoolgirls of which she has charge. Walter naturally takes them back to his island and his hovel, where the differences between the two adults soon surface. To Eckland, Freneau becomes ""Goody Two Shoes"", while, to the latter, her knight in stained armor becomes the ""Filthy Beast"".While admittedly silly entertainment, FATHER GOOSE is a delightful romantic comedy that doesn't, like some of the current Tinseltown offerings, rely for laughs on sensitive body parts being caught in zippers, bodily fluids masquerading as hair gel, or carnal knowledge of apple pies. This film has Class, chiefly due to the presence of Grant, who character demonstrates more suavity unshaven and without socks than any one of today's crop of male actors dressed up in a tux. (Perhaps only Sean Connery, Robert Redford and Paul Newman are close to being in the same league.)  Caron's strong-willed and very feminine Freneau is more than a match for Eckland's obstinately boorish masculinity - a pairing made in heaven, or at least Hollywood.Perhaps my high esteem for this film is more a function of nostalgia. But there're a lot of other films from that same period of my youth that are eminently forgettable, so I have to think that FATHER GOOSE is a cut above.",5,A romantic comedy in the old style,1020297600,"05 2, 2002",2002,2460,"['liked', 'originalThe', 'Odd', 'Couple-', 'slob', 'compulsive', 'neatnik', 'thrown', 'together', 'same', 'apartment', 'orHeaven', 'Mr.', 'Allison-', 'tough', 'guy', 'WWII', 'Marine', 'marooned', 'enemy-held', 'South', 'Pacific', 'island', 'pretty', 'nun', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'FATHER', 'GOOSE', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'saw', 'once', 'again', 'telly', 'past', 'weekend', 'doing', 'ironing', ""'m"", 'fortunate', 'be', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'appreciation', 'three', 'films.Grant', 'Walter', 'Eckland', 'antisocial', 'unkempt', 'escapee', 'civilization', 'time', 'bumming', 'South', 'Seas', 'old', 'yacht', 'start', 'WWII', 'coerced', 'service', 'coast', 'watcher', 'observer', 'stationed', 'remote', 'island', 'lookout', 'Japanese', 'planes', 'ships', 'wily', 'dry-witted', 'local', 'Royal', 'Australian', 'Navy', 'authority', 'figure', 'Comdr', 'Houghton', 'Howard', 'Eckland', 'bribed', 'booze', 'perform', 'Majesty', 'service', 'One', 'first', 'assignments', 'boat', 'island', 'rescue', 'fellow', 'coast', 'watcher', 'arriving', 'only', 'colleague', 'grave', 'Caron', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Freneau', 'daughter', 'French', 'government', 'official', 'who', 'been', 'stranded', 'bevy', 'underage', 'schoolgirls', 'charge', 'Walter', 'naturally', 'back', 'island', 'hovel', 'where', 'differences', 'two', 'adults', 'soon', 'surface', 'Eckland', 'Freneau', 'Goody', 'Two', 'Shoes', 'latter', 'knight', 'stained', 'armor', 'Filthy', 'Beast', '.While', 'admittedly', 'silly', 'entertainment', 'FATHER', 'GOOSE', 'delightful', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'current', 'Tinseltown', 'offerings', 'rely', 'laughs', 'sensitive', 'body', 'parts', 'being', 'caught', 'zippers', 'bodily', 'masquerading', 'hair', 'gel', 'carnal', 'knowledge', 'apple', 'pies', 'film', 'Class', 'chiefly', 'due', 'presence', 'Grant', 'who', 'character', 'more', 'suavity', 'unshaven', 'socks', 'one', 'today', 'crop', 'male', 'actors', 'dressed', 'up', 'tux', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'are', 'close', 'being', 'same', 'league', 'Caron', 'strong-willed', 'very', 'feminine', 'Freneau', 'more', 'match', 'Eckland', 'obstinately', 'boorish', 'masculinity', 'pairing', 'made', 'heaven', 'least', 'Hollywood.Perhaps', 'high', 'esteem', 'film', 'more', 'function', 'nostalgia', ""'re"", 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'period', 'youth', 'are', 'eminently', 'forgettable', 'so', 'have', 'think', 'FATHER', 'GOOSE', 'cut']",N/A

No matter how you describe the combination of drunkenness, WWII Japanese invasions, and French school maidens, it doesn't sound interesting. The movie title seems only to add insult to injury. Nothing about it reads like a Cary Grant movie. Nevertheless, since each prior Grant movie purchase has been a good investment in long-lasting entertainment I parted with ten bucks and hit the jackpot. Despite the odd descriptions FATHER GOOSE is, believe it or not, a romantic comedy!Shedding his usually debonair role, Cary Grant plays Walter Eckland, an embittered boat owner who abandoned his teaching career to live on the sea, drinking this life away. Through deceit and booze bribing he is enlisted into the service of U.S. armed forces to become a lookout for Japanese fighter planes on a deserted island. The movie grows into what becomes an appropriate title after he discovers French schoolmistress Catherine Freneau (Leslie Caron) seeking refuge for seven young girls. Picture all of them following Walter like baby geese. Self-interest eventually expands as he makes sacrifices for -- even risks his life to help others. The experience gives new meaning to the life previously abandoned to alcohol. Through it all, a mutual attraction develops between him and Catherine. Now, if they can just get off the island alive! Though peril is evident, the cast portrays it in a lighthearted manner with plenty of witty lines.I am happy I finally ""risked"" purchase of this delightful Grant gem.

The urbane Mr. Grant, always funny in a non-threatening ""Bond"" sort of way with a resume decades long and some of the best mysteries and dramas made. A favorite of Alfred Hitchcock, his appearances are only rivaled by Jimmy Stewart and you would have to flip a coin between the spookiness of Rear Window or North by Northwest to select a favorite.Walter Eckland is a History Professor who leaves acadamia because they made him wear a necktie. He just wants to float around all those pacific atolls in an 26 foot cabin cruiser and drink Black and White Scotch. Regrettably, it's 1943 and all those dreamy white sandy beaches are now inhabited by angry, rifle carrying Japanese soldiers.Walter complete with two week beard and scrufty attire is coerced by Royal Australian Navy Commander Trevor Howard, always on top of his game, to be a 'coastwatcher.'These fellows were really quite heroic even though Grant plays it up for laughs and drinks an impossible amount of scotch daily . . . hell, hourly while doing it. Of course he ends up saving Leslie Caron and her 8 school girls in the process, marries Caron by coastwatcher high freq radio, and is saved by an American Sub.Funny stuff. It's 1964 so everything is bloody clean with only an occasional innuendo regarding things that go bump in the night. My only criticism (and the film is a lot of fun and fairly timeless) is that there's not a lot of chemistry between Grant and Caron. And there could have been. There's a lot of heat between Stewart and Kelly in the aforementioned Rear Window, and likewise with Grant and Saint in NNW. Here it's really almost dull. Take for example Heche and Ford in ""Six Days, Seven Nights."" The movie was kind of lame but there was electricity between, again, the aging actor (there Harrison Ford) and the younger woman, Anne Heche. All in all a funny movie and a credit to Cary Grant on the eve of his departure from films. 4 stars.

Made in 1964, it's a warm, slightly off-beat romantic comedy, starring Cary Grant  and Leslie Caron.Walter Eckland (Grant) is an irascible,  middle-aged,  slightly besotted curmudgeon sailing the South Pacific during World War II  in search of...well, something...anything!  After getting caught  &quot;borrowing&quot; some gasoline from the British Navy for his  boat,  he's blackmailed into serving  as a plane spotter.  Resentful after being  stranded on a tiny island, he misses his liquid companionship, which the  Navy has taken from him and hidden.  So, Walter vows not to lift a finger  to help the Navy.  He relents, though, (after being promised some liquid  refreshment) and motors on  over to a neighboring island to rescue a fellow  plane spotter in danger of capture by the Japanese.Alas, the fellow  plane spotter is dead.  Walter instead  finds Catherine Freneau, a very  proper, teetotaling, but attractive French schoolteacher with seven young  girls in her care.  Stranded on the neighboring island, she asks Walter for  help.  He reluctantly agrees, and they all return to Walter's home base.  And then...Well, I won't give the story away.  Needless to say, fireworks  erupt between Catherine and Walter, and the classic battle of the sexes is  on!This is a very funny movie, although it's probably better for the  guffaw and the bellylaugh, rather than the outright howl of laughter.  Grant is superb in his role as the gruff but kind-hearted Walter (a  refreshing departure from his usual role as a romantic  &quot;smoothie&quot;), and Caron nearly steals the show with her comic  portrayal of the equally warm-hearted schoolma'arm hiding behind a facade  of old-fashioned primness.If you like a good old-fashioned romantic  comedy with great action, a superb plot, sparkling screenplay, lots of  laughs, AND featuring your favorite stars...you'll love Father Goose!",5,A great classic comedy!,965520000,"08 6, 2000",2000,1953,"['quot', 'Father', 'Goose', 'quot', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Made', '1964', 'warm', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Leslie', 'Caron.Walter', 'Eckland', 'Grant', 'irascible', 'middle-aged', 'slightly', 'besotted', 'curmudgeon', 'sailing', 'South', 'Pacific', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'search', 'well', 'something', 'anything', 'getting', 'caught', 'quot', 'borrowing', 'quot', 'gasoline', 'British', 'Navy', 'boat', 'blackmailed', 'serving', 'plane', 'spotter', 'Resentful', 'being', 'stranded', 'tiny', 'island', 'liquid', 'companionship', 'Navy', 'taken', 'hidden', 'So', 'Walter', 'not', 'lift', 'finger', 'help', 'Navy', 'though', 'being', 'promised', 'liquid', 'refreshment', 'motors', 'neighboring', 'island', 'rescue', 'fellow', 'plane', 'spotter', 'danger', 'capture', 'Japanese.Alas', 'fellow', 'plane', 'spotter', 'dead', 'Walter', 'instead', 'Catherine', 'Freneau', 'very', 'proper', 'teetotaling', 'attractive', 'French', 'schoolteacher', 'seven', 'young', 'girls', 'care', 'Stranded', 'neighboring', 'island', 'Walter', 'help', 'reluctantly', 'return', 'Walter', 'home', 'base', 'then', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'story', 'away', 'Needless', 'say', 'fireworks', 'erupt', 'Catherine', 'Walter', 'classic', 'battle', 'sexes', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'probably', 'better', 'guffaw', 'bellylaugh', 'rather', 'outright', 'howl', 'laughter', 'Grant', 'superb', 'role', 'gruff', 'kind-hearted', 'Walter', 'refreshing', 'departure', 'usual', 'role', 'romantic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Caron', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'comic', 'portrayal', 'equally', 'warm-hearted', ""schoolma'arm"", 'hiding', 'facade', 'old-fashioned', 'primness.If', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'great', 'action', 'superb', 'plot', 'sparkling', 'screenplay', 'lots', 'laughs', 'featuring', 'favorite', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Father', 'Goose']",N/A

In both Cary Grant gets to play a character experiencing a host of aggravations.  Leslie Caron's Catherine Frenau is not as zany as Hepburn's Susan, but still manages to irritate Grant for most of the film until he finally realizes that he is in love with her.  And instead of a leopard and a dog running amuck in rural Connecticut, ""Father Goose"" features seven schoolgirls of various nationalities running amuck on a Pacific island during WWII.Everything works pretty well in this film although Grant is not quite up to an American accent so there are several awkward moments with the script.  And the age difference makes the Grant-Caron romance unconvincing.  Fortunately the producers skate over the romantic elements.  In fact, the romance is treated so superficially that you wonder why they bothered to insert it into the story.  A similar romance got much the same treatment that year in ""My Fair Lady"".The film's real strength is the interaction between Grant and the seven schoolgirls as it manages a fair amount of believable characterization for each of them.  The initially silent Jenny (Sharyl Locke), tomboy Harry (Jennifer Berrington),  chronic complainer Anne (Pip Sparke),  Elizabeth (Stephanie Berrington) and her imaginary friend Gretchen, coming of age Christine (Venina Greenlaw), and the French twins (Laurelle and Nichole Felsette).  All have distinct personalities and it is obvious that Grant had a lot of fun working with each of them; so much so that he stayed in touch with them even after they grew up, married, and started their own families.Grant's Walter Eckland is an American drifter hoping the war will just pass him by; illustrated during the opening credits by Digby Wolfe singing ""Pass Me By"" as Eckland (with an unwanted hitchhiking Pelican) steers his boat into the harbor.  The war catches up with him there when the Harbor Master (Trevor Howard) tricks him into taking a coast-watching job until a replacement can be found.His job is reporting by radio any movements by Japanese planes and ships near his island station.  The reluctant recruit is rewarded with a bottle of whiskey (previously hidden somewhere on the island by the Royal Navy) each time one of his reports is confirmed.Walter seems to thrive on this assignment until he has to share his island with a French teacher Catherine Frenau (Leslie Caron) and seven young charges.  Miss Frenau hides the remaining whiskey bottles and the females take over Walter's hut.Then again, what do I know?

WARNING ON THE BLU-RAY -- This Blu-Ray has *not* been remastered.  Better than the DVD because of the disc format, but absolutely not remastered.PRIOR REVIEW OF THE MOVIE:No doubt about it, Grant was a master.  In Father Goose he gets to play aging curmudgeon opposite Leslie Caron's delightfully uptight ingenue and both succeed on every level.  The chemistry here is great and the movie never loses focus of its light romantic comedy tone.  The dialog is impeccable, the performances sharp and the repartee utterly engaging. And this goes not only for Grant's relationship with Caron, but extends into the ""over the microphone"" relationship with Trevor Howard, wonderfully and dryly droll.  Likewise, the kids are all spot on.  They aren't there just for comic relief and unlike modern day comedies, they don't overwhelm the piece.  Each was cast perfectly and they support the movie well.I get the feeling that Harrison Ford was trying to do a remake (without really doing a remake) of this movie when he ended up doing ""Six Days and Seven Nights,"" and that movie could be a lesson in how not to compete with a screen legend.  Ford tries too hard in that film, something that only points out how masterful Grant was.  Smooth as fine whiskey, Grant never pushed, never tried to hard.  He just exists in the skin of the character and underplays it beautifully.  And Caron -- who should have been a much bigger star than she became -- is exceptional as well.",3,Grant at His Best - Blu-Ray *not* Remastered,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,1594,"['UPDATE', 'ON', 'BLU-RAY', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'rate', 'Blu-ray', 'separately', 'already', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'So', 'reducing', '5', 'star', '3', 'WARNING', 'BLU-RAY', 'Blu-Ray', '*not*', 'been', 'remastered', 'Better', 'DVD', 'disc', 'format', 'absolutely', 'not', 'remastered.PRIOR', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'doubt', 'Grant', 'was', 'master', 'Father', 'Goose', 'play', 'aging', 'curmudgeon', 'opposite', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'delightfully', 'uptight', 'ingenue', 'succeed', 'level', 'chemistry', 'here', 'great', 'movie', 'never', 'focus', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'tone', 'dialog', 'impeccable', 'performances', 'sharp', 'repartee', 'utterly', 'engaging', 'not', 'only', 'Grant', 'relationship', 'Caron', 'microphone', 'relationship', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'wonderfully', 'dryly', 'droll', 'Likewise', 'kids', 'are', 'spot', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'just', 'comic', 'relief', 'modern', 'day', 'comedies', 'do', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'piece', 'was', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'support', 'movie', 'well.I', 'get', 'feeling', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'remake', 'really', 'doing', 'remake', 'movie', 'when', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'Six', 'Days', 'Seven', 'Nights', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'lesson', 'how', 'not', 'compete', 'screen', 'legend', 'Ford', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'something', 'only', 'out', 'how', 'masterful', 'Grant', 'was', 'Smooth', 'fine', 'whiskey', 'Grant', 'never', 'pushed', 'never', 'tried', 'hard', 'just', 'skin', 'character', 'beautifully', 'Caron', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'bigger', 'star', 'became', 'exceptional', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Hardly.1) The picture is HD, and while it is not the best I have seen (for a wonderful Blu-Ray of an old movie see North by Northwest or Wizard of Oz) it is acceptable.2) There are no subtitles. None. This amazes me because the bargain basement DVDs of Cary Grant I bought recently all have subtitles. There is no excuse for this whatsoever!3) There is only one soundtrack in English. While this is not that big of an issue to me, it doesn't fit in with the premium price.4) There are no extras whatsoever.

MILLER,"[1, 2]","We're used to seeing Grant in a tuxedo carrying a martini glass--when you think &quot;debonair&quot;, the picture that goes with that word is that of Cary Grant. I heard somewher that he was on a short list of candidates to play James Bond in &quot;Dr. No&quot; before they settled on Connery. In this film, to say Grant &quot;dresses down&quot; is putting it mildly--as he plays a former college professor turned beachcomber who is caught lifting supplies from an Australian naval base during WW II and drafted into their coastwatcher corps to stay out of prison. Leslie Caron figures in as a governess of a group of young daughters of diplomatic personnel who are stranded on a fellow coastwatcher's island, but now that Grant's colleague has been killed in a strafing run, Grant's their new host. Grant hardly feels like a host, and the negative chemistry between him and Caron makes for quite a few laughs. But in my opinion, one of the biggest yucks in this film is a sight/ sound gag early on. After Grant is loaded up with supplies at the base (now voluntarily), he shoves off. The base's exec expresses his doubts that the commander (Trevor Howard) can trust Grant not to take the provisions and run. Howard pooh-poohs his subordinate's worries. The next scene shows Grant steaming along liesurely to a woodwind version of the film's theme &quot;Pass Me By&quot; on the soundtrack. The music shifts to a Sousa-esque brass band version of the tune as the camera shifts to a huge gunboat rumbling along in Grant's wake. Absolutely great! And then some.",5,A scruffy Cary Grant?

40227,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,0782006760,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[1, 1]","Cary Grant's second-to-last film, ""Father Goose,"" is harmless enough, one of those mid-60s comedies that occasionally strays into adult territory while remaining steadfastly family-friendly.  Grant plays Walter Eckland, an American expat blackmailed into being a Pacific island coastwatcher in the early days of World War Two.  The ramshackle bachelor is happy enough beachcombing and searching for the bottles of booze hidden by his friend and sometimes tormentor, Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard), the Australian officer who abandoned Eckland on the deserted island in the first place.  That is, until a miscalculated rescue attempt of another coastwatcher instead leads to his picking up a blueblood schoolteacher (Leslie Caron) and her gaggle of tween charges.  In short time, they oust Eckland from his shack, hide his alcohol, and generally take to making his life a royal pain.  You can see where this is going.  Grant is, of course, excellent as always and plays what is essentially the prototype for Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison a few years later.  You may even be surprised (or disappointed) to discover Eckland's pre-war vocation.  Caron is unfortunately less capable in a role that requires her to be both charming and charmless at the same time, a kind of nagging wife figure who must inevitably come to understand the error of her ways just as Eckland has to finally grow up.  She is also made to look more severe than in films like ""Fanny"" and ""An American in Paris.""  One wonders how the role would have been better interpreted with someone with greater range, such as Audrey Hepburn.  Ralph Nelson's direction is straight-forward in a production that relies on the natural beauty of the South Seas for its tropical appeal - he would lose a lot of this visual sensibility within a decade with the well-intentioned but ultra-violent ""Soldier Blue."" While there are some tense moments with the nameless Japanese villains, the tone of the film is mostly light, a romantic comedy that occasionally labors to find both its love and laughs but in the end is a genial way to spend a few hours.  If you want to see a better romantic comedy with a middle-aged Grant, check out the superior ""Charade,"" made only the year before and featuring the lovely, lovely Audrey Hepburn.
