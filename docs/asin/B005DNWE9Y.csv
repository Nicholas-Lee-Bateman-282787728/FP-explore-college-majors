1455876,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005DNWE9Y,A kids review,"[1, 3]","A precocious young girl played by an up-and-coming starlet is left by her deadbeat mom to spend time with her absentee celebrity father, forcing a familial bond to develop that will lead the father, deeply in need of redemption, to a better place. If the plot of Janie Jones sounds familiar, it's because its skeleton pretty closely matches that of Sofia Coppola's film Somewhere. The difference? Somewhere is worth watching, while Janie Jones is not. So what kept the latter from reaching the heights of the former? I say Janie Jones, which stars Abigail Breslin as the daughter and Alessandro Nivola as the father, is entirely too familiar in its themes and, despite effective performances from its leads, never quite musters the dramatic heft it needs to outshine the others of its ilk.",1,Janie Jones,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,789,"['precocious', 'young', 'girl', 'played', 'up-and-coming', 'starlet', 'left', 'deadbeat', 'mom', 'spend', 'time', 'absentee', 'celebrity', 'father', 'forcing', 'familial', 'bond', 'develop', 'will', 'lead', 'father', 'deeply', 'need', 'redemption', 'better', 'place', 'plot', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'familiar', 'skeleton', 'pretty', 'closely', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'film', 'Somewhere', 'difference', 'Somewhere', 'worth', 'watching', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'not', 'what', 'kept', 'latter', 'reaching', 'heights', 'former', 'say', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'daughter', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'father', 'entirely', 'too', 'familiar', 'themes', 'effective', 'performances', 'leads', 'never', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'heft', 'outshine', 'others', 'ilk']",Janie Jones

At first he denies it, dosen't want to believe it- but then becomes closer to the kid after the mom leaves her with him to go off to rehab.First hour of the film dragged on, I wasn't impressed with the band. I didn't really think they were good singers or good rock star types per se. Also the music was more 'folksy' to me than rock- n- roll really. It was kind of predictable and cliche as far as the rock band or band stereotypes are concerned. For instance, guy gets punched,  guy fights with band member over girlfriend, guy spends night in jail, guy sings a heartfelt song on his guitar, etc...I could've thought of this script, it's nothing awesome or ingenius, just a guy in a band trying to cope with finding out he has a daughter.Seems there was lots of minutes of blank fill-in space, folk songs behind a country background, like out in the rural areas.As far as the actors, some you may recognize, like Brittany Snow as the girlfriend of the singer, or the daughter from Little Miss Sunshine. And out of all the actors I thought the daughter, Abigail Breslin, was the best/most promising as far as talent. The band didn't really do it for me.If you want to watch a semi- heart warming folksy story about a singer and his daughter you may find it ok/ interesting but if you're looking for some great rock n roll/ rock band film you may be disappointed. I probably won't watch it again but it wasn't terrible. 3 stars.",3,Decent 'Rock-n-Roll' Road Movie,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,1529,"['Plot-', 'Singer', 'out', '13', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'one', 'old', 'flings', 'back', 'town', 'first', 'dose', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'it-', 'then', 'closer', 'kid', 'mom', 'go', 'off', 'rehab.First', 'hour', 'film', 'dragged', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'band', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'were', 'good', 'singers', 'good', 'rock', 'star', 'types', 'se', 'Also', 'music', 'was', 'more', ""'folksy"", 'rock-', 'n-', 'roll', 'really', 'was', 'kind', 'predictable', 'cliche', 'as', 'far', 'rock', 'band', 'band', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'concerned', 'instance', 'guy', 'punched', 'guy', 'fights', 'band', 'member', 'girlfriend', 'guy', 'spends', 'night', 'jail', 'guy', 'sings', 'heartfelt', 'song', 'guitar', 'etc', 'could', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'script', 'nothing', 'awesome', 'ingenius', 'just', 'guy', 'band', 'trying', 'cope', 'finding', 'out', 'daughter.Seems', 'was', 'lots', 'minutes', 'blank', 'fill-in', 'space', 'folk', 'songs', 'country', 'background', 'out', 'rural', 'areas.As', 'far', 'actors', 'may', 'recognize', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'girlfriend', 'singer', 'daughter', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'actors', 'thought', 'daughter', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'was', 'best/most', 'promising', 'as', 'far', 'talent', 'band', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'me.If', 'want', 'watch', 'semi-', 'heart', 'warming', 'folksy', 'story', 'singer', 'daughter', 'may', 'find', 'ok/', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'rock', 'n', 'roll/', 'rock', 'band', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', '3', 'stars']",Janie Jones
1455878,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005DNWE9Y,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Anything that stars Abigail Breslin pretty much HAS to be awesome (or at the very least, really good).  She has a great track record for starring in high quality films.  Anyway, the storyline-When Abigail's drugged out/incompetent mother played by Elisabeth Chue finds the father (played by Alessandro Nivola) in the dressing room after a concert performance (since he's a musician) she basically demands that he takes control of their daughter so she can uh, probably go on to do more drugs or clean herself up.  Looking at her though, you can probably guess what kind of mess she's in so she'd likely prefer to go the drug-taking route.  At first Alessandro declines and doesn't believe he has a daughter nor recognizes the mother for that matter (or maybe he *did* recognize her and simply didn't want his attractive girlfriend sitting beside him to know anything about this predicament).  Eventually when the police intervene, he realizes he pretty much doesn't have a choice but to take his daughter in.  From here, the storyline develops a bond between Abigail's character and her father.Unfortunately for Abigail, her father is an arrogant and demanding jerk with a superiority complex- he believes he can take his entire band wherever he wants and basically call the shots at all times.  Of course you can probably guess what happens then- the band splits up after an argument, leaving Abigail and her father deserted and having to work together to make it.  This is actually a crucial change of events because starting now, the storyline improves by quite a bit.  Basing an entire plot around a father and daughter travelling across the country on a tour bus really wouldn't have been very appealing from a storyline viewpoint so let's be thankful *that* didn't happen.  When it's discovered Abigail has a talent for singing and playing guitar, this is when a daughter/father duo forms (rather reluctantly at first, however).I feel the storyline isn't *quite* as exciting as it could have been, and the ending feels too predictable.  It really feels like this movie needed one more segment to *really* elevate it to greatness.  As it stands, it's just very good.  My favorite segment is perhaps the father being responsible for a bar fight.  The father wants the crowd to hush up and be quiet so he can perform his tear-jerking ballad in front of a rowdy disrespectful audience but... that ain't gonna happen!I'm curious if Abigail really does have a singing talent or if she was just lip-syncing.  Also, I HOPE she's not a smoker, but it really looks like she was smoking believably in that one scene when she was sitting by the window and looking outside.  I don't want Abigail becoming addicted to THAT nasty habit.  She's too young for that.  Hopefully she was just pretending to smoke in that scene (though I wouldn't have a clue how one would pretend to release smoke from their nostrils, heh).Overall, yeah.  A drama/adventure between a daughter and father with the mother appearing in only the beginning and end to spoil the good times.  I won't spoil what happens at the end but let's just say, it's nothing you haven't seen in countless other movies.  Or in other words, you've seen it before.  You can figure it out.  However the acting is phenomenal and the drama is really good too.  Abigail just has this way of turning everything she stars in into gold.

1455883,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005DNWE9Y,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","The plot line of JANIE JONES has been used many times before - estranged child forced to live with runaway parent provides growth for both - but this story is apparently based on a true incident and perhaps that is one of the reasons it becomes rather endearing.  Written and directed by David Rosenthal this somewhat overly long film works well and that is in no small art due to the sensitive casting.Tattooed, alcoholic, almost has been rock and roll performer Ethan (Alessandro Nivola) tours with a mediocre band headed by manager Sloan (Peter Stormare) who somehow manages to keep things together for the band - Dave (Joel David Moore), singer and Ethan's girl friend Iris (Britanny Snow), Chuck (Frank Whaley), and Ulysses (Michael Panes).  The band has been together for years and now is forced to play the sleazy nightclubs who will book second rate acts.  Into this worn down group comes a surprise - Ethan's old squeeze Mary Ann Jones (Elisabeth Shue) whom Ethan hasn't seen for 13 years arrives on the scene with Ethan's 13-year-old daughter Janie Jones (Abigail Breslin).  Ethan doesn't even remember Mary And nor does he buy the fact that he fathered a child, but Mary Ann has the birth certificate to prove it: Mary Ann is  drug addict and can no longer care for Janie while she attempts to dry out so she literally dumps Janie with the reluctant Ethan and disappears. The remainder of the film is a struggle Ethan has at being unable to cope with life in general, the disbanding of the band because of Ethan's sociopathic behavior, Ethan's arrest and Janie's method of bailing him out when no one else will, falling downhill as a musician, and coping with the fact that Janie is around.  The gradual interaction between Ethan and Janie demonstrates the difficulties of father-daughter bonding, but it also awakens in each of them the concept of being noticed, needed, and loved.Both Alessandro Nivola (one of our finest actors today) and Abigail Breslin bring a depth of acting skills to these rolls.  They are wholly credible and have our hearts all the way through. The smaller roles (including Frances Farmer as Ethan's wealthy mother form whom he is able to get funding because of Janie's presence as her granddaughter) are well written and beautifully acted.  The film relies a lot on music and Nivola and Breslin sing and pay their own musical contributions.  Yes the story may be tattered from over use, but the strength of the film is well worth the viewer's interest and time.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Self-absorbed and self-destructive and a mean drunk, Ethan Brand (Alessandro Nivola) has never had to take care of anyone but himself. Ethan and his rock band are trying to recapture their old magic, touring the town halls and dive bars of the Heartland. Before one such gig, Ethan is confronted by a groupie named Mary Ann (Elisabeth Shue) with whom he once had a fling, and this is how he finds out he has a 13-year-old daughter. Her name is Janie Jones. Just like the Clash song.Ethan scoffs at his old flame Mary Ann, denies that he's the father and he goes on stage. Mary Ann, strung out on the stuff and desperately needing to clean up, abandons her daughter, vamooses out of there. The local sheriff lays it out for Ethan: either take his daughter with him on the road or it's gonna get real messy.Recall that Ethan Brand is self-absorbed and self-destructive and a mean drunk. He tends to indulge in embarassing stage antics (which are perfect fodder for YouTube) and he's steadily alienating the other band members. He basically has no time for Janie who is left to fend for herself most times. Maybe Ethan should thank his down-spiraling ways because it's not until he's broken the band up and the label company's dropped him in disgust, it's not until then that he begins to really pay attention to Janie. Janie, who it turns out strums the acoustic guitar and writes and sings her own songs and who is accepting and resourceful. What's left is Ethan and Janie continuing to tour on the road together, just them two.JANIE JONES, let's put this out there, isn't as attention grabbing as CRAZY HEART, nor are the songs as powerful or raw or haunting as the songs you'll find in another and better indie film, ONCE. You'll find that the songs in JANIE JONES are rather low key and, unfortunately, largely forgettable, although you credit Alessandro Nivola and Abigail Breslin for performing them.JANIE JONES' saving grace is its lead cast. Nivola and Breslin's rock solid acting and chemistry and Elisabeth Shue's effective cameos allow this film to transcend its clich&eacute;d narrative. Writer/director David Rosenthal, who himself didn't meet his daughter until she was 11 years old, doesn't go overboard with the sentimental trappings. He crafts a story about second chances that manages to be both sweet and bittersweet and just emotional enough. And even though, ultimately, there's not enough fire or musical highlights to galvanize the film, JANIE JONES is worth checking out, at least once.

The teenage actress who appeared in Little Miss Sunshine works well in this film, making some borderline saccarine scenes play as authentic. Elisabeth Shue is fine in her smaller role but you get the feeling that a lesser known actress could have done just as well.  The story is essentially the development of a relationship between a rocker dad and the daughter he didn't know.  What makes it work is that lead actor is good enough as a singer to qualify as a rocker not good enough to be great. The relationship between him and his ""surprise"" teenage daughter is rocky and a work-in-progress that is good to see develop. The ending is pat and neat...which disappoints.

1455887,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B005DNWE9Y,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 0]","Ethan Brand (Alessandro Nivola) is an alcoholic musician whose career is floundering.  While touring on the road with his disgruntled band, he experiences the shock of his life upon learning he has a thirteen-year-old daughter, Janie Jones (Abigail Breslin).  Her mother, Mary Ann Jones (megastar Elisabeth Shue) is a burned out drug addict who abandons her with Ethan before fleeing to a rehab clinic.  With everyone else in their lives gone, Ethan and Janie must cling to each other for survival.David M. Rosenthal's emotional drama, ""Janie Jones,"" is a story of how a child can suddenly and un-expectantly change everything.  Janie forces the immature, self-centered Ethan to become a responsible adult; in the meantime, he must learn to shed his alcohol dependency before it destroys both the business and familial bonds that he is forging with his newfound daughter.  This is a feel-good film with a delightful, happy ending.  My best friend and I watched it together when we were celebrating Valentine's Day.  Unfortunately, Rosenthal strives to create the gritty lifestyle of a traveling musician and his band.  The result is a lot of gratuitous, vulgar language that is inappropriate for children.The acting from the three leads is superb. I was extremely eager to watch the performance of Elisabeth Shue who has starred in numerous films representing all genres.  Some of my favorite movies she starred in were ""Piranha"" (Piranha [Blu-ray]), ""Hollow Man"" (Hollow Man: Director's Cut [Blu-ray]), ""Molly"" (Molly) and ""The Saint"" (The Saint).  Unfortunately, the audio commentary from Director Rosenthal and two producers didn't shed much light on how Shue became a part of ""Janie Jones.""  They spent a tremendous amount of time emphasizing that the film was very low budget and explaining how various locales and extras were obtained at a minimal cost, mostly free.  This story, I learned from the audio commentary, is loosely based on Rosenthal meeting his daughter Julia for the first time when she was eleven and he was thirty.The only other special feature on the DVD is a quick interview session with stars Abigail Breslin and Alessandro Nivola who are appearing at a Tribeca Film awards ceremony.  Both Breslin and Nivola are very talented performers who sung their own songs in the film.  Rosenthal insisted upon this when he was casting.  Unfortunately, there are no bloopers or deleted scenes.  Closed captions are provided; however, I cannot see them on my high definition widescreen television.  English subtitles for those of us who are deaf or hard of hearing would've been appreciated.  The film is presented in a widescreen presentation of 2.35:1.  It is not rated but parents should not allow their children to watch it because of gratuitous foul language, the consumption of alcohol, the display of drug paraphernalia, sexual innuendoes and barroom brawling.""Janie Jones"" has a wonderful message that is intended for a mature audience: Love, specifically love for family, can help us achieve happiness and a sense of self worth that cannot be obtained from consuming alcohol or recreational drugs.  The emotional, human drama that follow Ethan and Janie as they travel from one bar to another helps propel the plot.  Those who enjoy rock-n-roll music with a lot of guitar will want to watch ""Janie Jones.""  I especially was transfixed by Abigail Breslin's singing; she is very adorable and sweet.  Any man would be honored to have Janie Jones as a daughter.  In a way, ""Janie Jones"" is almost like a male fantasy.  Some men daydream about discovering they have an illegitimate child.  Unfortunately, not all of these children may turn out to be as charming, loving and talented as Janie Jones.Joseph B. Hoyos",4,"A Child's Love Heals a Broken Musician in David M.

The writer/director, David M. Rosenthal, came up with the narrative after he was introduced to his daughter when she was eleven and he was thirty.  The notion is very sweet, the actors are terrific and many are recognizable from television shows, but there was just something lacking which did not grab me and propel me to tell everyone they need to see the film.  The weakest scene was the trip to Ethan's mother, and my favorite framing was Ethan and Janie playing the guitar at the back of the motel.  All was predictable, the conflicts were simplistic, and although I tried to watch a second time with the commentary provided by Rosenthal and two producers, I was quickly bored.  I'm not sure about the budget for this film, but I'm certain they pulled off a presentable film without spending much.  For this reason, I've given the film three stars and appreciate that they've completed a good film economically.  My biggest criticism of the actual DVD is that I was unable to read the credits which I really, really wanted to read.  My television set is large, but the font was not crisp.

Wiles Parker,"[0, 0]","The general storyline is used, familiar and the ending is predictable and somewhat disappointing, but that doesn't mean Janie Jones is a bad movie.  It's well constructed and acted within the confines of the script.  Ethan is down on his luck, falling apart in life and his career when Janie is dumped on him.  He can either take her on tour with his band or leave her to social services to fall through the cracks.  Guilt gets the better of him and he decides, even though he doesn't feel being on the road is the proper place to raise a kid, he will take her on tour.  By the end Ethan and Janie have come to terms with their relationship and love of music.The acting is good, particularly on Alessandro Nivola as Ethan as he sinks further into a destructive path and finds his way out.  Breslin shows she is still capable of playing the outsider type of character that made her famous (Little Miss Sunshine) and seems to have a few tricks up her sleeve.  The problem is that Janie as the title character is not nearly as fleshed out as she could be.  Ethan's responses feel pretty canned and expected at times and the support characters are never fleshed out enough given that most of them are only on screen for about 5 minutes.  While the quality in production is evident, particularly in pacing and editing, the story itself is a bit lacking.

1455892,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005DNWE9Y,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There are a couple of great reasons to tune into David Rosenthal's ""Janie Jones,"" namely its principle stars Alessandro Nivola and Abigail Breslin.  They both turn in earnest and believable performances as an estranged father/daughter pair who find themselves inexplicably thrown together.  Despite their best efforts, however, the rather expected story and a lack of narrative momentum lessen the impact that the film might have had.  And yet, I was still completely with this oft-told tale until the entire endeavor sinks itself with a faux happy ending that betrays the realistic vibe that had preceded it.  It's a near fatal error that might make you smile only if you refuse to give the situation any deep contemplation.  For a film that strives for a gritty realism, this open-ended flight of fancy just doesn't sit well.Here's the pitch:  A nihilistic and aging rocker (Nivola) discovers he has a teenage daughter (Breslin) from a random encounter many years past.  The two are thrust together on a cross-country road trip with the band.  Do you think the two will form an unlikely bond?  Might they be able to save one another and enrich each other's lives?  I won't spoil any developments, but anyone who's ever seen a movie (and there are dozens of examples with this exact plot) probably won't be surprised by the answer.  Along the way, there are a series of challenges to overcome as Nivola faces the inevitability of finally growing up to be a responsible citizen.  Loaded with expected moments, ""Janie Jones"" meanders throughout with no specific forward movement--just allowing the relationship to develop precisely as you know it will.  But still, Nivola has a ragged charm and Breslin is wide-eyed and likable.  They try mightily to make it all seem fresh and almost succeed, but the screenplay ultimately deflates the gritty truth that had made the picture work despite its shortcomings.Strangely enough, I saw this almost back-to-back with Sophia Coppola's ""Somewhere"" which shares many similarities (substitute movie star for rock star).  Rosenthal's film, however, is structured to be more of a crowd-pleaser and probably suffers because of it.  On the positive, Nivola and Breslin sing their own songs (which I might add are pretty maudlin for the rural dive bar crowd) and really sell the burgeoning relationship drama.

1455896,ADTUS88NFTW23,B005DNWE9Y,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[0, 1]","First off, Abigail Breslin is an amazing actress.  I think that she gives an absolutely spot-on performance in this movie.  It is a shame that the movie around her, ""Janie Jones"", does not live up to that performance.The story of ""Janie Jones"" is a too common theme for indie films.  The theme I'm referring to falls in to one of two indie film subgenres: 1) a brooding and dispondent male finds a Manic Pixie Dream Girl (a term coined by AV Club writer Nathan Rabin) to inspire him and drag him out of his funk, and 2) a self-absorbed adult (usually a male artist) has a child enter into their life, and this new responsibility forces the adult to become slightly less selfish by the end of the film.  ""Janie Jones"" is of the second variety.The basic plot of the movie is about Ethan Brand, an alcoholic aging trust-fund musician, who finds out that he has a daughter from a groupie he slept with thirteen years in the past.  The mother abandons her kid at one of his band's shows, so the aging rocker has to take care of the child while the mother goes in to rehab.  The girl, named after the Clash song ""Jannie Jones"" (as the dialog awkwardly reminds the viewer), teaches Ethan about life and...stuff.Well, ideally she would.  I think Ethan Brand is one of the least likeable characters I've seen on screen in a long time.  He is abusive, jealous, arrogant, uses people, passive aggressive, regular aggressive, manipulative, and never really has to fully deal with the consequences of his actions because he comes from a wealthy family.  Given all of these character flaws, spending 10 minutes playing guitar with a little girl falls far short of what is needed to make him even partially likeable.  Many times during the film I found myself wondering if the little girl would have been better off with her addict mother.The ""trust fund kid"" aspect of Ethan's character is baffling.  It exists in the film so the filmmakers can make a statement about how, even though Ethan is an adult, he is still a child who raising a child.  This all comes from a terrible scene where he uses his daughter so he can go beg his mother for money (to pay for a trip to SXSW, and to get his guitars out of hoc).  Everything is awful about that scene (as I mentioned, aside from Breslin).  The dialog between mother and Ethan is terribly unbelievable.  The scene manages to make an unpleasant character even less likable.Another ""selfish artist man-child who has a child save him"" indie film I saw recently was the terribly named ""happymorethankyouplease"".  That movie is by no means great, but at least the womanizing jerk artist in that film has just enough redeeming qualities to make you route for him.  ""Janie Jones"", I just wanted to end.  Also, in that other film the character actually has somewhat of an arc.  By the end of ""Janie Jones"", the viewer doesn't get the impression that Ethan really gained anything by having his daughter in his life (aside from having another person to be emotionally dependent on).  Here's hoping that Ms. Breslin will make another dramatic film soon; one that will actually live up to her amazing talent.",2,One great actress can't make up for a terrible script and characters.,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,3130,"['First', 'off', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'amazing', 'actress', 'think', 'absolutely', 'spot-on', 'performance', 'movie', 'shame', 'movie', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'performance.The', 'story', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'too', 'common', 'theme', 'indie', 'films', 'theme', ""'m"", 'referring', 'falls', 'one', 'two', 'indie', 'film', 'subgenres', '1', 'brooding', 'dispondent', 'male', 'Manic', 'Pixie', 'Dream', 'Girl', 'term', 'coined', 'AV', 'Club', 'writer', 'Nathan', 'Rabin', 'inspire', 'drag', 'funk', '2', 'self-absorbed', 'adult', 'usually', 'male', 'artist', 'child', 'enter', 'life', 'new', 'responsibility', 'adult', 'become', 'slightly', 'less', 'selfish', 'end', 'film', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'second', 'variety.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'Brand', 'alcoholic', 'aging', 'trust-fund', 'musician', 'who', 'out', 'daughter', 'groupie', 'slept', 'thirteen', 'years', 'past', 'mother', 'kid', 'one', 'band', 'shows', 'aging', 'rocker', 'take', 'care', 'child', 'mother', 'rehab', 'girl', 'named', 'Clash', 'song', 'Jannie', 'Jones', 'dialog', 'awkwardly', 'viewer', 'Ethan', 'life', 'stuff.Well', 'ideally', 'would', 'think', 'Ethan', 'Brand', 'one', 'least', 'likeable', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'long', 'time', 'abusive', 'jealous', 'arrogant', 'people', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'regular', 'aggressive', 'manipulative', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'deal', 'consequences', 'actions', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Given', 'character', 'flaws', 'spending', '10', 'minutes', 'playing', 'guitar', 'little', 'girl', 'far', 'short', 'what', 'needed', 'make', 'even', 'partially', 'likeable', 'Many', 'times', 'film', 'found', 'wondering', 'little', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'addict', 'mother.The', 'trust', 'fund', 'kid', 'aspect', 'Ethan', 'character', 'baffling', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'make', 'statement', 'how', 'even', 'Ethan', 'adult', 'still', 'child', 'who', 'raising', 'child', 'terrible', 'scene', 'where', 'daughter', 'can', 'go', 'beg', 'mother', 'money', 'pay', 'trip', 'SXSW', 'get', 'guitars', 'hoc', 'Everything', 'awful', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'aside', 'Breslin', 'dialog', 'mother', 'Ethan', 'terribly', 'unbelievable', 'scene', 'make', 'unpleasant', 'character', 'even', 'less', 'likable.Another', 'selfish', 'artist', 'man-child', 'who', 'child', 'save', 'indie', 'film', 'saw', 'recently', 'was', 'terribly', 'named', 'happymorethankyouplease', 'movie', 'means', 'great', 'least', 'womanizing', 'jerk', 'artist', 'film', 'just', 'enough', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'make', 'route', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'just', 'wanted', 'end', 'Also', 'other', 'film', 'character', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'arc', 'end', 'Janie', 'Jones', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'Ethan', 'really', 'gained', 'anything', 'having', 'daughter', 'life', 'aside', 'having', 'person', 'be', 'emotionally', 'dependent', 'Here', 'hoping', 'Ms.', 'Breslin', 'will', 'make', 'dramatic', 'film', 'soon', 'one', 'will', 'actually', 'live', 'up', 'amazing', 'talent']",Janie Jones

The plot line is a well used one -- a man newly discovering he has a child and the bond that gradually forms between them. This storyline is no less worthy of re-telling than that of often repeated love stories. The reason plots are revisited is because they resonate. These relationships shape our existence and define our life. The question will always be not whether the plot has been explored too many times, but rather is the new telling skillfully done and moving. Do we learn something new or are we reminded of something of value? With Janie Jones the answer is, yes.Well-paced the movie progresses in a logical manner and the relationship between the father and daughter develops, based initially on circumstances, but then a deeper understanding arises as each discovers common ground and genuine affection. They are undeniably connected to each other. As the story unfolds and each layer is revealed there are no missteps in believability. The audience remains fully engaged as the father and daughter realize they are forever changed and need each other.There isn't a false note or flawed performance. A few days after viewing, some of the scenes still stay with me - like the shot of a small cornfield where it looks like nothing will thrive, and another of a devastatingly beautiful sunset.

The premise of the movie is that a once-groupie (played almost unrecognizably in a short appearance by Elizabeth Shue) had a short romance with a musician years ago and unbeknowst to him, she had a daughter by him, who is now 13 (played by Abigail ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Breslin). The mother essentially abandons her daughter, leaving her in the care of her unbeknowst dad. From that point on, an uneasy relationship develops between dad and daughter.There are a number of plot moments in the movie that are completely wacky and/or improbable. And yet, and yet, as the movie strolls along, one simply cannot be helped but be charmed by the overall feeling of it. Suspending belief, the movie is a mix between a road movie and a music movie, and at that level it works quite well (but please don't call it the ""arguably best music film since ""Walk the Line"" as the DVD box claims). Abigail Breslin is the hightlight of the movie, and rapidly growing up before our eyes. She'll be a great actress for many years to come.Last but not least, the music in the movie, which plays a central role, features original songs from Eef Barzelay, best known as the principal songwriter and singer of alt-country band Clem Snide, and worth checking out in his own right.

So explains writer/director David Rosenthal about this film dedicated to his daughter, who worked beside him on in it.Alessandro Nivola (Junebug) is a youngish indie rocker on a downward slide.  (Though the inspiration is from real life, these particulars are fictional.)  While on a low-budget tour, the daughter he didn't know he had is dumped in his lap while her former groupie/present junkie mother tries to clean herself up.  Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) is 13-year-old Janie, already more grown-up than she should have to be, now thrown into the turmoil of the tour with a father who refuses to acknowledge her as his own.  She has inherited his musical talent, which becomes the means of their first connections, but not the most important one.The well trod ground of road movie, music flick, band fights, destructive drinking, and redeeming love is made fresh by the well pitched performances of the two leads, and made especially hard to resist by Breslin.  They're aided by an excellent supporting cast, though not always performing at their best (some had little time to prepare).  The moral arc and some plot elements are nothing new, which is fine--this is a character-driven film, and sometimes life works as it should.  The realistic, gritty feel and look of the film never becomes too dark, and there's humor in the situations.The music is quality indie folk/rock, adding much to the mood without without obstructing the plot.  The leads do all their own singing, and Nivola also does his own guitar work.  Nivola's songs were written by Eef Barzelay (of Clem Snide), who also did the score.  Breslin's are by Gemma Hayes.The DVD has an audio commentary by Rosenthal and two producers.  It's mostly behind-the-scenes stuff, less about the drama.  Apparently Breslin has an amazing ability to switch from joking around on set to nailing the most demanding emotional moments on screen.  The commentary mentions deleted scenes, but they didn't make it to the DVD.  There are interview clips of the principals from the Tribeca Film Festival, about four-and-a-half minutes.A labor of love in both personal and professional ways, this small-budget indie seems to have missed its audience somehow.  It won the Audience Award in Buffalo, but critics were jaded by having seen similar stories or expected more than a sweet, warmhearted one, possibly misled by the grittiness.

With the lead's occupation in the film, there is plenty of music throughout the movie and surprisingly Breslin's acoustic solo music sounds better that the modern rock of the band in the film.

You reject her and deny her over and over, despite her musical talent, bravery enough to save you from a beating you deserved (never brawl with mouth-breathing rednecks - instead, insult them with words beyond their vocabulary), and the resourcefulness to finagle your loser arse out of jail.  How do you repay this gem?  Drag her with you to a few gigs, don't pay her, then dump her with still-strung-out mama and her pimp/moron boyfriend in Dirtville, USA.  To redeem yourself, you offer to take her to one last gig, where she SHOULD be headlining instead of you, but only let her sing the la-la-la backing vox on a tune or two.  If this is based on a true story, I only hope the real Janie received better than her screen reflection... like all the credits she deserves and points on film and record sales.  Any real Janies out there?  Leave the sot in jail, make a deal with his manager to take over his gigs, play them yourself and don't leave a venue until you get paid.  Most bar owners are no better than the scum you can scrape off their bathroom floors.  (Cherish the 1% that surprise you by listening to your set and paying you fairly.)  The moral of this film?

This is not to be confused with those BOATS (BASED on a true story) films. As you will learn in the sole bonus feature - a 4:40 ""Red Carpet Interviews"" piece which incorporates clips from the film - Writer/Direct David M. Rosenthal met his own daughter for the first time when she was 11 years old and he was 30. This ""Inspired"" the film, which - you have probably read by now - is about a guitar player (who is in an alternative rock band but really wants to perform acoustic music at South by Southwest) who learns he has a 13 year-old daughter (probably due to a one-night stand) when her mother drops her off on the way to her own drug rehab journey.The cast is filled with mostly unknown (Elisabeth Shue is the best known)  though 13 year-old Abigail Breslin did get an Oscar nom for her role in another independent film, ""Little Miss Sunshine"". She didn't have to sing in LMS and, frankly, I'm not thrilled with her voice here. It has that rough singer/songwriter quality of songwriters who write great songs that are better preformed by others.The songs in the film - many performed complete - are not exactly memorable but they do carry the 107-minute film along. The harder ""rock oriented"" numbers performed in the first third of the film had totally undecipherable lyrics to me.But this is a ""festival"" film and it's good to know that Amex is getting small personal films like this into homes of people who don't travel the ""film festival"" circuit.So, it was worth my time watching this film and I'm sure it will find a wider audience this way.
