722467,ATJXWBH2S416P,B00006RCOH,"Amy E. Begay ""book nut""","[0, 0]",This movie has many things going on not just about two women who love one another. Any family can be dysfunctional no matter where or how they live.  Emotional issues never discussed can cause problems within a family.  Casey come from money but chooses to live without the family wealth and support to do what she loves and be with who she loves.  Her two brothers have their own problems as well but want to stay in their mother's good graces.  Combine the events of the past with the present and throw in the Christmas holidays and it can end in so many different ways. The ending may be anti-dramatic but I think it worked.

Most of the negative comments pertained to the technical aspects of the film...the abrupt scene endings, some scene lighting etc.  As a result, I did not watch the movie with great expectations but in the end I was pleasantly surprised!  Nice story line and I found all the characters very believable.  In fact, the mother, as eccentric as she is, reminds me of someone I know who is virtually the same way!All the actors and actresses are very easy on the eyes.  The love scenes were not explicit, nor did they need to be...I just prefer love scenes to show a little more skin and to be a bit hotter than these were. That is just my personal preference and why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.There were a couple of issues that were inferred but not completely clear, like the relationship the brother (Shawn) had with his friend.  I think there were gay undertones in that friendship.  You will have to decide from what you see.  Perhaps that was the Director's intent, to show the conflict the mother has with the daughter...would have been the same with the son had his friend lived.  Thought provoking.Overall, a very enjoyable movie.  Don't think it is one I would keep to add to a collection, but it was a nice way to kill 90 minutes.",4,Under  Promised & Over Delivered!

The cover art is deceiving: it looks like a warm summer romp in St. Tropez, but it takes place around Christmas on the east coast.  The characters are interesting, and very real and believable; so is the family situation which is the focus of the movie and the issues between the main characters.  The women have great chemistry between them - I was convinced that they have known each other and/or have been together for years.  I liked their lifestyle, THANK GOD for something NOT stereotypical.  This is a brooding movie set in New England, so don't expect anything cheery, but it works pretty well.
