Charles Lindbergh jr., waskidnapped from his home in March 1932 and despite the payment of $50,000ransom he was never seen alive again. Some time later his body was found lessthan a mile from his home leading to speculation that he never survived theactual kidnapping.  For over a year the case went unsolved until a Germanimmigrant was found to be spending the ransom money.When arrested the immigrant, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was initially evasive.He finally stuck to a story that he had acquired the money from a fellowimmigrant who left him a box for safekeeping while on a voyage back toGermany.  When that man died in Europe owing Hauptmann money, he opened thebox and discovered the cash.  Figuring that this would serve as repaymentHauptmann hid the money not telling  his wife or other friends owed money bythe dead man.  The police found this story unlikely and coupled withHauptmann's initial falsehoods under questioning they became convinced thatHauptmann had been the killer and kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby.The case gave the nation and the world the first &quot;Trial of the Century&quot;.  Acircus like atmosphere existed outside the courtroom with food and souvenirsfor sale to the excitable crowd.  The evidence presented was circumstantialbut convincing to the jury.  The defense maintained that much of it wasdoctored or coerced by the police; this was not convincing to the jury.  Theverdict was guilty and the sentence was death.Hauptmann was subjected to the ultimate penalty in 1936. But since that datethe datable has raged on.  There are many who are remain convinced byHauptmann declarations of innocence and believe that he was railroaded toprotect the careers of those who could not find the real killers.  The moremainstream view holds that Hauptmann was in fact guilty of participation inthe kidnapping.This movie is firmly on the side of Hauptmann.  He is shown as an immigrantwho is always hustling for a better life for his family who is chosen as aconvenient victim for the justice establishment.  His view of how he got themoney is taken as fact and his brave stance maintaining his innocence costshim all possible lenience.  Hauptmann's wife insists that 'the truth shallset you free' and is determined to prove that her husband was innocent of thecrime.It is hard to say that any movie with Isabella Rossellini is not the best,however this movie does have some serious flaws.  While made in the 90s theproducers seem to feel that it was necessary to have the actors act like itwas a 1930s gangster movie.  Most of the 'bad guys' (The police and DA) arejust a little too into playing the tough guys and a little too uninterestedin discovering the facts of the case.  It sets a jarring note that continuesthroughout the whole movie.It is possible that there were shady dealings and a rush to judgement.  Butsome facts are indisputable.  Hauptmann was found possessing $14,000 ofransom money.  He did lie to the Police and the Lindbergh baby was dead.Some facts are undoubtedly lost to history forever, but this does not givethe producers the right to make them up and then package them as history.",3,Before there was OJ there was the Lindbergh Case.,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,3188,"['was', 'OJ', 'was', 'Lindbergh', 'Case', 'Charles', 'Lindbergh', 'jr.', 'waskidnapped', 'home', 'March', '1932', 'payment', '50,000ransom', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'alive', 'again', 'time', 'later', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'mile', 'home', 'leading', 'speculation', 'never', 'survived', 'theactual', 'kidnapping', 'year', 'case', 'went', 'unsolved', 'Germanimmigrant', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'spending', 'ransom', 'money.When', 'arrested', 'immigrant', 'Bruno', 'Richard', 'Hauptmann', 'was', 'initially', 'evasive.He', 'finally', 'stuck', 'story', 'had', 'acquired', 'money', 'fellowimmigrant', 'who', 'left', 'box', 'safekeeping', 'while', 'voyage', 'back', 'toGermany', 'When', 'man', 'died', 'Europe', 'owing', 'Hauptmann', 'money', 'opened', 'thebox', 'discovered', 'cash', 'Figuring', 'would', 'serve', 'repaymentHauptmann', 'hid', 'money', 'not', 'telling', 'wife', 'other', 'friends', 'owed', 'money', 'bythe', 'dead', 'man', 'police', 'found', 'story', 'unlikely', 'coupled', 'withHauptmann', 'initial', 'falsehoods', 'questioning', 'became', 'convinced', 'thatHauptmann', 'had', 'been', 'killer', 'kidnapper', 'Lindbergh', 'baby.The', 'case', 'gave', 'nation', 'world', 'first', 'quot', 'Trial', 'Century', 'quot', 'Acircus', 'atmosphere', 'existed', 'courtroom', 'food', 'souvenirsfor', 'sale', 'excitable', 'crowd', 'evidence', 'presented', 'was', 'circumstantialbut', 'convincing', 'jury', 'defense', 'maintained', 'much', 'wasdoctored', 'coerced', 'police', 'was', 'not', 'convincing', 'jury', 'Theverdict', 'was', 'guilty', 'sentence', 'was', 'death.Hauptmann', 'was', 'subjected', 'ultimate', 'penalty', '1936', 'datethe', 'datable', 'raged', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'remain', 'convinced', 'declarations', 'innocence', 'believe', 'was', 'railroaded', 'toprotect', 'careers', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'real', 'killers', 'moremainstream', 'view', 'Hauptmann', 'was', 'fact', 'guilty', 'participation', 'inthe', 'kidnapping.This', 'movie', 'firmly', 'side', 'Hauptmann', 'shown', 'immigrantwho', 'always', 'hustling', 'better', 'life', 'family', 'who', 'chosen', 'aconvenient', 'victim', 'justice', 'establishment', 'view', 'how', 'got', 'themoney', 'taken', 'fact', 'brave', 'stance', 'maintaining', 'innocence', 'costshim', 'possible', 'lenience', 'Hauptmann', 'wife', 'truth', 'shallset', 'free', 'determined', 'prove', 'husband', 'was', 'innocent', 'thecrime.It', 'hard', 'say', 'movie', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'not', 'best', 'however', 'movie', 'have', 'serious', 'flaws', 'made', '90s', 'theproducers', 'seem', 'feel', 'was', 'necessary', 'have', 'actors', 'act', 'itwas', '1930s', 'gangster', 'movie', 'Most', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'police', 'DA', 'little', 'too', 'playing', 'tough', 'guys', 'little', 'too', 'uninterestedin', 'discovering', 'facts', 'case', 'jarring', 'note', 'continuesthroughout', 'whole', 'movie.It', 'possible', 'were', 'shady', 'dealings', 'rush', 'judgement', 'Butsome', 'facts', 'are', 'indisputable', 'Hauptmann', 'was', 'found', 'possessing', '14,000', 'ofransom', 'money', 'did', 'lie', 'Police', 'Lindbergh', 'baby', 'was', 'dead.Some', 'facts', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'lost', 'history', 'forever', 'not', 'givethe', 'producers', 'right', 'make', 'up', 'then', 'package', 'history']",Crime of the Century VHS
415912,APYCNRS112N2B,6304343434,Eat The Rich Books,"[5, 14]","Crime of the Century fails much in the same way the system of justice failed in the prosecution of for the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in the 1930s, not enough evidence.I know Mark Rydell  (On Golden Pond) to be an extremely sensitive filmmaker and stage director,  his motivation here, I'm sure was to present an alternative to Hauptmann's  guilt, to entertain ideas that the prosecution may have erred. The evidence  was only circumstantial, of the course the crime was horrible, but  Hauptmann's execution may have been more a result of public outrage than  guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.And he may be right, based on everything  I've read, he probably is right. Unfortunately all the probabilities in the  world add up to nothing on screen. After only a couple of suppositions the  viewer gets so lost in the ultimate goal of the story that he loses  interest. I've watched this film 3 times, and lost interest every  time.What a waste of terrific actors, including Stephen Rea, J.T. Walsh,  Michael Moriarty, Vyto Ruginis, Barry Primus, and Allen Garfield.Without closure, as long we as know as little as we do about what  actually happened, maybe this story is best left to the true-crime section  of the local bookstore, or Investigative Reports, Dateline, or 20/20.

415916,A36NF437WZLQ9E,6304343434,W. Powell,"[2, 2]","Talk about a Conspiracy to Convict. This movie has all the trimmings of an American tragedy of justice, one the likes of Sacco and Vanzetti in its day.I'll start by saying that the movie was A+ Excellent.  The acting was riveting, so much so that I found myself angry with and disgusted by the actors playing the investigative roles.  This movie about the true kidnap and murder of Charles Lindburgh's baby in 1932 puts to shame many crime/courtroom dramas being peddled today as John Grisham-esque.  The crime is horrific and actions of those who arrest and prosecute the suspect are horrendous. To think that the lead investigator on the case was the father of U.S. Army General Stormin Norman Schwarzdopf of Operation Desert Storm fame makes this historical movie that much more interesting.Until this day, I along with all the others who've heard of the Lindburgh Baby Case, cannot say whether Bruno Richard Hauptmann was guilty or innocent of the crime, but after watching how the investigation went down in this movie I can honestly state that the New Jersey justice system was guilty of something.  Watch this heartwrenching movie to see where lies their guilt. You're also treated to a climactic scene with Samuel Barber's ""Adagio For Strings"" playing in the background.
