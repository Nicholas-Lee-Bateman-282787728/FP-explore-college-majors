Once that is done though it is easy to say that this is the sin qua non of Lynch's work. The stunning black and white photography, the languid artsy pacing, a circus of the odd and profane and at the heart the simplist most primal story of being seen as a freak by the world. Lynch, Burton and Gilliam would all tackle this topic later in their careers but here, in the hands of an un-tried and rampagingly iconoclastic young David Lynch is perhaps the clearest and most touching take on the subject. The film aches and every insult is felt by the viewer. In many ways this is both Lynch's most accessable AND most artistic vision reaching depths he has only gotten to years later with The Straight Story. Within this movie are the seeds of Dune, Blue Velvet and Lost Highway without the sense of comprimise that seeped into Wild at Heart and Fire Walk with Me. In taking a step away from the Freudian mire of Eraserhead, Lynch crafts a deeper and more incissive study of the human soul and exposes what human really means.As for the Disc itself, well Stunning is an adaquate discription really.END",4,A glimpse into Primal Lynch,954806400,"04 4, 2000",2000,1220,"['difficult', 'start', 'review', 'one', 'giving', 'film', 'context', 'framework', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'done', 'easy', 'say', 'sin', 'qua', 'non', 'Lynch', 'work', 'stunning', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'languid', 'artsy', 'pacing', 'circus', 'odd', 'profane', 'heart', 'simplist', 'most', 'primal', 'story', 'being', 'seen', 'freak', 'world', 'Lynch', 'Burton', 'Gilliam', 'would', 'tackle', 'topic', 'later', 'careers', 'here', 'hands', 'un-tried', 'rampagingly', 'iconoclastic', 'young', 'David', 'Lynch', 'perhaps', 'clearest', 'most', 'touching', 'take', 'subject', 'film', 'aches', 'insult', 'felt', 'viewer', 'many', 'ways', 'Lynch', 'most', 'accessable', 'most', 'artistic', 'vision', 'reaching', 'depths', 'only', 'gotten', 'years', 'later', 'Straight', 'Story', 'movie', 'are', 'seeds', 'Dune', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'sense', 'comprimise', 'seeped', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'Fire', 'Walk', 'Me', 'taking', 'step', 'away', 'Freudian', 'mire', 'Eraserhead', 'Lynch', 'deeper', 'more', 'incissive', 'study', 'human', 'soul', 'what', 'human', 'really', 'means.As', 'Disc', 'well', 'Stunning', 'adaquate', 'discription', 'really.END']",The Elephant Man VHS

210249,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,6300214044,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","David Lynch's finest film, alongside with perhaps Mulholland Drive. John Hurt, under tons of makeup, stars as David Merrick, the real-life grotesquely deformed individual of Victorian England that was better known as The Elephant Man. Merrick is the virtual slave of a brutish man (a great performance of Freddie Jones) that parades him as a carnival freak until he is rescued by the sensitive doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). Treves decides to put Merrick in a hospital room, winning over the initial skepticism of its director, John Gielgud. In the hospital, Merrick will start to talk for the first time, begin to regain his dignity, and eventually will become a curiosity of high society before his premature death. Shot in a delicate and expressionist black and white, the only flaw in the movie might be the performance of Ann Bancroft (producer Mel Brooks's wife) as a stage actress interested in Merrick's life. Except for the surreal opening and closing scenes (in which Merrick is born and dies, respectively), here Lynch is relatively restrained, opting for a style that could be called poetic realism. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, but left that race empty-handed, an earlier indication that Lynch's films would not be the typical Academy material.",5,One of Lynch's best films,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,1288,"['David', 'Lynch', 'finest', 'film', 'alongside', 'perhaps', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'John', 'Hurt', 'tons', 'makeup', 'David', 'Merrick', 'real-life', 'grotesquely', 'deformed', 'individual', 'Victorian', 'England', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Merrick', 'virtual', 'slave', 'brutish', 'man', 'great', 'performance', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'carnival', 'freak', 'rescued', 'sensitive', 'doctor', 'Frederick', 'Treves', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'decides', 'put', 'Merrick', 'hospital', 'room', 'winning', 'initial', 'skepticism', 'director', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'hospital', 'Merrick', 'will', 'start', 'talk', 'first', 'time', 'begin', 'regain', 'dignity', 'eventually', 'will', 'become', 'curiosity', 'high', 'society', 'premature', 'death', 'Shot', 'delicate', 'expressionist', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'performance', 'Ann', 'Bancroft', 'producer', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'wife', 'stage', 'actress', 'interested', 'Merrick', 'life', 'surreal', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'Merrick', 'born', 'dies', 'respectively', 'here', 'Lynch', 'relatively', 'restrained', 'opting', 'style', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'poetic', 'realism', 'film', 'earned', 'eight', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'left', 'race', 'empty-handed', 'earlier', 'indication', 'Lynch', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'typical', 'Academy', 'material']",The Elephant Man VHS
210250,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300214044,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 7]","It's hard for me to formulate with mere words the impact this film has had on me.  `The Elephant Man' is so much more than a weepy drama about injustice, but in the end it becomes an overwhelming testament to the rarity of genuine kindness, and this is what serves as the catalyst for my falling tears.  David Lynch's masterpiece captures the audience, sinking every claw and tooth into the heartstrings of the viewer and relentlessly tearing it to shreds, but it does so with such graceful subtlety you barely realize you're being emotionally manipulated.  Some have balked at the idea that `The Elephant Man' does just that; manipulates the audience's emotions; but in my humble opinion I feel that that manipulation is necessary.  As a warm-blooded human being none of us want to accept the worst parts of us, and so it becomes vital for directors like Lynch to coax that realization out of us.What makes `The Elephant Man' and the more heartbreaking is the fact that it is based on actual events, and so the audience is forced to realize that this is no mere work of fiction but an accurate portrayal of what man is capable of.  Not even in your worst of nightmares could you make something like this up.The film tragically retells the story of John Merrick (whose actual name was Joseph Merrick), a man who, while possessing a beautiful soul, was cursed with a horrendous disfigurement that hindered him from ever being embraced by the `normal' people around him.  Paraded around as nothing more than a sideshow freak, an animal even, John's life has been reduced to slavery at the hands of Bytes, a ruthless and harsh sideshow entertainer.  Then his life is suddenly, and drastically, changed when he is discovered by Doctor Frederick Treves and ushered away from his cruel world and into the warm arms of the hospital.It's within those small moments of acceptance that the audience can find the most emotional connectivity to the film.  Sure, the scenes of unjust violence and mistreatment are bound to well up within us feelings of pain and sadness and overwhelming hopelessness, but it's the gestures of genuine kindness that carries the most weight.  I remember in particular a moment when Doctor Treves introduces John to his wife Anne.  The moment is so subtle, so tender and pure.  It touched me in the most passionate of ways because it confronted a basic need for acceptance, a need that most humans take for granted.`The Elephant Man' marvelously contradicts those moments of kindness with harsh depictions of hatred and ignorance as John is mistreated by those willing to use and abuse him for their own amusement.  David Lynch is able to capture the best and worst sides of human nature so vividly and fearlessly, never simplifying or downplaying anything but keeping true to an honest depiction of humanity.What helps elevate this film is the brilliant performances by the entire cast.  John Hurt is just incredibly moving as John Merrick, captivating the audience with just the glimmer of sincerity in his eyes.  While I can't deny that Robert De Niro's Oscar winning performance in `Raging Bull' was glorious and deserved of the Oscar I can't help but wish it would have been yet another Hepburn/Streisand moment and we could have seen both De Niro and Hurt walk away with a little golden man.  Anthony Hopkins also delivers an outstanding yet often overlooked performance as Frederick Treves.  Sadly his performance takes a backseat to Hurt's, but when one looks deep into the control and dedication in which Hopkins uses to deliver this performance once can't help but become outraged at his lack of awards attention.  He compliments Hurt beautifully and it is ultimately his act of kindness that stands as the pivotal message this entire film and its emotional connectivity hinges upon.  Anne Bancroft is also memorable as the famed theater actress Mrs. Kendall and Hannah Gordon's scene with John Hurt is so emotionally wrecking I have to single her out as extraordinary here.  Even Freddie Jones captivates, despite his unarguable despicability.Across the board `The Elephant Man' delivers effortlessly.  It is beautifully shot in rich black and white, adding layers to the rawness of the subject.  David Lynch, who is nothing short of a phenomenal and visionary director, manages to infuse so much honesty into this film I just can't help but become a part of it.  In all fairness, 1980 was a very strong year and it sports one of the greatest Best Picture lineups in the history of Oscar.  `Ordinary People' is a very well made film and is one that I enjoy immensely, but it did not deserve that Best Picture Oscar.  The film, since its win, has garnered a bad rap for `stealing' `Raging Bull's Oscar, but in my humble opinion that Best Picture Oscar rightfully belongs to `The Elephant Man', a superb masterpiece of cinema.This is the type of film that roots itself in the heart of the audience and resides forever within it.  It is a film that will force you to recognize the evil within ignorance but it will also force you to embrace and appreciate the rare moments of warmth and kindness.  The other day someone said to me that they only wished we could remember the good things people do.  I think that in the end that's what this film does for me.  It helps me to realize that there are good people trapped in this world of injustice and hatred.  Sadly that kindness is such a rarity, such a lost treasure that one is blessed if ever he were to find it.  Lynch beautifully makes that clear in what proves to be a film filled with conflicting emotions; feelings of sorrow, pain, misery and fear as well as hope, happiness, love and admiration.  No matter which way to look at it, `The Elephant Man' is an alarming story of humanity in its truest form.",5,Pure and honest; a film that will never leave you...,1209686400,"05 2,

I always assumed that was how the film should look since it looked no different than the cover art. Now that I have seen this dvd I view the film in a very different way.The image on this dvd is beautiful. It is expanded to it's original theatrical aspect ratio, and the sound has never been more clear.The Elephant Man tells the truly powerful story of John Merrick, played brilliantly by John Hurt. Horribly deformed, John Merrick is discovered by Dr. Treeves in a freakshow. His caretaker is an overbearing man who will never let his ""Treasure"" go. After Dr. Treeves convinces his caretaker to bring John to the hospital to give him medical attention, Dr. treeves realizes the remarkable find he has in his care, he tells the caretaker off and begins to care for John Merrick himself.What follows is one of the handful of truly great stories of the search for acceptance, and the power of the human spirit.

Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world.

John Merrick was a real person, although this is not a literal biography of his life, as far as I know. [Wikipedia says his real first name was Joseph, but that Dr. Treves got it wrong in his memoirs.] He lived in Victorian England, and he had the most extreme form of his disease (I went to Wikipedia and get the technical name; Neurofibromatosis) that Dr. Frederick Treves (Sir Anthony Hopkins) had ever seen. His head was huge and incredibly distorted, much of the rest of his body was too, although his left arm and his genitals were normal.Dr. Treves found him in a freak show, where he was being horribly abused, and brought him to the London hospital where Treves was a surgeon. He installed him in the ""isolation ward"" at the top of the hospital, and soon learned that Merrick was not the idiot he had assumed he was, even hoped he was, to avoid thinking of how miserable his life must have been. In fact, when he introduces Merrick to the head of the hospital (Sir John Gielgud, I believe), the head thinks he is simply mindlessly parroting what Dr. Treves had taught him. But when he recites the entire 23rd Psalm, while Treves had only taught him the first few lines, they both become aware that the man has a normal, perhaps even a superior, intelligence.His speech was at first terribly slurred by the shape of his mouth, but with practice, he learned to speak pretty well. Treves takes him home to meet Mrs. Treves, who is very kind to Merrick. Eventually Treves introduces Merrick to a great many other members of London polite society, including a famous actress played by Anne Bancroft.But the coarser elements of London are not done with The Elephant Man. One of the men who works in the boiler room of the hospital discovers where he lives, and starts charging people at the local pub to climb up to the roof and look through his window at him. One such gawking party gets completely out of hand. The boiler-man thinks it amusing to bring along a mirror, perhaps having noticed that there were no mirrors in Merrick's room, and speculating that he may not ever have seen himself. Apparently he was right, because Merrick screams and goes into shock when he sees himself in the mirror.Included in the number is the old drunken sadist who had exhibited him in a sideshow. He kidnaps Merrick and takes him to France to renew his sideshow career. But the other freaks help him to escape, and he returns to England.No, I haven't told you too much. There's a great deal more to the story, including especially a rather stark contrast between those who feel real compassion for Merrick and do what they can to make his life more comfortable and even pleasant, and those who just want to make money and bad jokes off him. Indeed, Dr. Treves is so sensitive that he worries he's no better than the sideshow man because he has introduced Merrick to society people. His wife reassures him that John his happier than he has ever been before, although I must say that's not the greatest compliment in the world.This is not a horror story. It's a story of courage and compassion. Indeed, it could rightly be called a love story on several levels.",4,Excellent Drama Based on a True Story,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,3283,"['John', 'Hurt', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'John', 'Merrick', ""'m"", 'betting', 'will', 'not', 'recognize', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'make-up', 'job', 'John', 'Merrick', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'literal', 'biography', 'life', 'as', 'far', 'know', '[', 'Wikipedia', 'real', 'first', 'name', 'was', 'Joseph', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'got', 'wrong', 'memoirs', 'lived', 'Victorian', 'England', 'had', 'most', 'extreme', 'form', 'disease', 'went', 'Wikipedia', 'get', 'technical', 'name', 'Neurofibromatosis', 'Dr.', 'Frederick', 'Treves', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'head', 'was', 'huge', 'incredibly', 'distorted', 'much', 'rest', 'body', 'was', 'too', 'left', 'arm', 'genitals', 'were', 'normal.Dr', 'Treves', 'found', 'freak', 'show', 'where', 'was', 'being', 'horribly', 'abused', 'brought', 'London', 'hospital', 'where', 'Treves', 'was', 'surgeon', 'installed', 'isolation', 'ward', 'top', 'hospital', 'soon', 'learned', 'Merrick', 'was', 'not', 'idiot', 'had', 'assumed', 'was', 'even', 'hoped', 'was', 'avoid', 'thinking', 'how', 'miserable', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'fact', 'when', 'Merrick', 'head', 'hospital', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'believe', 'head', 'simply', 'mindlessly', 'parroting', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'had', 'taught', 'when', 'entire', '23rd', 'Psalm', 'Treves', 'had', 'only', 'taught', 'first', 'few', 'lines', 'become', 'aware', 'man', 'normal', 'perhaps', 'even', 'superior', 'intelligence.His', 'speech', 'was', 'first', 'terribly', 'slurred', 'shape', 'mouth', 'practice', 'learned', 'speak', 'pretty', 'well', 'Treves', 'home', 'meet', 'Mrs.', 'Treves', 'who', 'very', 'kind', 'Merrick', 'Eventually', 'introduces', 'Merrick', 'great', 'many', 'other', 'members', 'London', 'polite', 'society', 'including', 'famous', 'actress', 'played', 'Anne', 'Bancroft.But', 'coarser', 'elements', 'London', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'One', 'men', 'who', 'boiler', 'room', 'hospital', 'discovers', 'where', 'charging', 'people', 'local', 'pub', 'climb', 'up', 'roof', 'look', 'window', 'One', 'such', 'gawking', 'party', 'completely', 'hand', 'boiler-man', 'thinks', 'amusing', 'bring', 'along', 'mirror', 'perhaps', 'having', 'noticed', 'were', 'mirrors', 'Merrick', 'room', 'speculating', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'Apparently', 'was', 'right', 'Merrick', 'screams', 'shock', 'when', 'mirror.Included', 'number', 'old', 'drunken', 'sadist', 'who', 'had', 'exhibited', 'sideshow', 'Merrick', 'France', 'renew', 'sideshow', 'career', 'other', 'freaks', 'help', 'escape', 'England.No', 'have', ""n't"", 'told', 'too', 'much', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'story', 'including', 'especially', 'rather', 'stark', 'contrast', 'who', 'feel', 'real', 'compassion', 'Merrick', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'comfortable', 'even', 'pleasant', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'bad', 'jokes', 'Indeed', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'so', 'sensitive', 'better', 'sideshow', 'man', 'introduced', 'Merrick', 'society', 'people', 'wife', 'John', 'happier', 'ever', 'been', 'before', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'greatest', 'compliment', 'world.This', 'not', 'horror', 'story', 'story', 'courage', 'compassion', 'Indeed', 'could', 'rightly', 'be', 'called', 'love', 'story', 'several', 'levels']",The Elephant Man VHS

The word &quot;poignant&quot; has grown hackneyed from overuse, but it certainly applies to this great film. Few films can equal it in terms of dramatic artistry and pitch perfect performances. There's not one maudlin note in a film that could easily have descended into bathetic melodrama in lesser hands.Lynch was practically a neophyte at the time he directed this movie, yet to many (and to most, for that matter, save the true believers) THE ELEPHANT MAN is his magnum opus. I believe this is because of the mostly Britsh, classically trained actors that made up the cast. Hopkins and Hurt excell. Anne Bancroft (who I believe is the only American in the cast) delivers a flawless performance. Freddy Jones, as Bytes (this was before the internet, remember) is simply uncanny in his tour-de-force portrayal of arguably the vilest villain in cinema history. Who cares that the character was totally innacurate, historically? He chews up the scenery in true Grand Guignol fashion. Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are also on hand to provide levitas. One can't find a better ensemble. It's criminal that at least one of them weren't awarded an Oscar, but that's just another example of how meaningless those little gold statuettes are, more often than not.Though this is a lot more linear than most of Lynch's movies, there is enough of the surreal on hand to keep the die hards happy. But the surrealism doesn't get in the way of the plot. Christopher de Vore and Eric Bergren, who collaborated with Lynch on the screenplay, can take some credit for that. Veteran cinematographer, Freddie Francis did perhaps the best work of his career here. The black and white images are as good as it gets. The sets are unforgettable. Victorian London has never looked so convincing on screen, yet with that nightmarish quality that defines most of the movie.If you've never seen this movie, get your hands on a copy, soon. It couldn't be described as &quot;weepy,&quot; by any means. But if you're not reaching for the kleenex at some stage in this marvellous film, I'd ask the Wizard for a heart, if I were you.

210263,A33RDFYADJUYJQ,6300214044,C. Clark,"[3, 3]","The Elephant Man is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  The story of John Merrick is based closely (but sometimes, not too closely) on the Victorian Joseph Merrick, who was so disfigured he could not go out in daylight.  Rescued from the life of a sideshow freak by Sir Frederick Treves (masterfully portrayed by Anthony Hopkins), he lives the remainder of his life in dignity and relative comfort, attracting the attention of much of upper-class society, including Dame Madge Kendall and Princess Alexandra.  The black and white cinematography is stunning; the makeup work--and John Hurt's ability to touch all of us beneath layers of latex--should have won Oscars.  The music is perfect.  One of those historical films which convinces you, &quot;yes, this MUST be what it was like to live back then.&quot;  The small details matter, such as a scene where Treves is performing an operation, at a time when surgeons did not wear masks or gloves, and he coughs right on the man's chest.  Germ city--but they didn't know it back then.OK, these were (just) some of the film's strong suits.  Now to review the actual video.  In short, this one screams out for a DVD release.  Even for a mid-priced video of a somewhat older movie, this VHS tape looks dreadful.  The black and white photography appears overexposed (all the whites are too pale, almost blindingly so, and I know it's not my TV because I did some comparisons).  For example, the scene where Treves first sees Merrick, Merrick is in almost total darkness and we must &quot;guess&quot; as to his appearance--this is how I remember it from HBO.  But heck, here everything is so light we can see the guy perfectly, certainly not the intended effect.If this is not enough, consider that the original film was shot in widescreen, and yet most of the VHS is in full-frame, except for the opening credits.

210266,A1I8GJGIE48DSG,6300214044,Christopher Baum,"[13, 13]","The Hughes Brothers' recent release FROM HELL includes a brief (and surely unexpected) appearance by one John Merrick, better known as 'the Elephant Man'.  Merrick's inclusion in a movie about Jack the Ripper points up the odd connections between these two figures.  Both represented extremes of degradation (moral in one case, physical in the other) that had never been seen before; both aroused horror and fascination in equal degrees; and both were major press sensations - all in the same district of London at roughly the same time.  Indeed, John Merrick and Jack the Ripper might even be seen as yin and yang: while the Ripper's (presumably normal) exterior masked a heart of the blackest evil, Merrick's hideous body housed one of the kindest and gentlest souls ever to grace this planet.This beautiful soul is the focus of David Lynch's magnificent film, THE ELEPHANT MAN.  Broadly speaking, the film is a true story; while a fair portion of the details are either totally fictitious or conflated from several real-life sources, the general outline of the script is true. It follows Merrick from his first encounter with Dr Frederick Treves (Hopkins), the man who helped him regain his dignity, until his death trying to ""sleep like normal people"" - this final scene being only one of many unforgettable moments in the film.The cast of THE ELEPHANT MAN is utterly top-notch.  With only his eyes visible beneath Christopher Tucker's extraordinary makeup, John Hurt manages to give a tremendously moving performance in the title role.  You won't soon forget his recitation of the 23rd Psalm, his heartbreaking teatime visit to Treves's wife (a fine cameo by Hannah Gordon), or his reading of Romeo to Anne Bancroft's Juliet (another great cameo).  Anthony Hopkins once again proves himself to be among the greatest actors of our time; his performance as Treves is nicely nuanced, evincing subtle and deeply human contradictions, where a lesser actor might have portrayed a mere two-dimensional Virtuous Leading Man. John Gielgud is his usual brilliant self, Freddie Jones is excellent as the sinister yet somehow tragic Mr Bytes, and the various supporting roles are all up to the very high standard set by these leading players.Since 1980 was the year of RAGING BULL and ORDINARY PEOPLE, it is perhaps understandable that THE ELEPHANT MAN didn't win any of the 8 Academy Awards for which it was nominated - though in my opinion it is every bit as good as either of those films.  What is scandalous, however, is the fact that Freddie Francis's stunning black-and-white cinematography wasn't even nominated.  (Francis did pick up his second Oscar, for Edward Zwick's GLORY, a few years later.)Lynch's direction, finally, is a revelation.  This was only his second film, and he was working with some of the greatest actors living at the time, but his hand has never been surer.  Not until THE STRAIGHT STORY (also, incidentally, photographed by Francis) would he again attempt so direct a presentation, but the results here are simply superb.  There isn't a hollow note or an empty image in the entire film, which is more than one can say for some of Lynch's later efforts.The DVD's picture quality is excellent, the sound likewise.  Extras include the theatrical trailer, some interesting bits concerning Christopher Tucker's makeup, and a brief documentary featuring comments from Tucker, John Hurt, Freddie Francis, producer Jonathan Sanger, and (uncredited) executive producer Mel Brooks (yes, that Mel Brooks).  It would have been nice to hear something from David Lynch as well, but all things considered, this is a fairly minor quibble.  A great film and a great DVD - pick it up today.",5,Unforgettable,1008633600,"12 18, 2001",2001,3697,"['Hughes', 'Brothers', 'recent', 'release', 'FROM', 'HELL', 'brief', 'surely', 'unexpected', 'appearance', 'one', 'John', 'Merrick', 'better', 'known', ""'the"", 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Merrick', 'inclusion', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'up', 'odd', 'connections', 'two', 'figures', 'represented', 'extremes', 'degradation', 'moral', 'one', 'case', 'physical', 'other', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'aroused', 'horror', 'fascination', 'equal', 'degrees', 'were', 'major', 'press', 'sensations', 'same', 'district', 'London', 'roughly', 'same', 'time', 'Indeed', 'John', 'Merrick', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'yin', 'yang', 'Ripper', 'presumably', 'normal', 'exterior', 'masked', 'heart', 'blackest', 'evil', 'Merrick', 'hideous', 'body', 'housed', 'one', 'kindest', 'gentlest', 'souls', 'ever', 'grace', 'planet.This', 'beautiful', 'soul', 'focus', 'David', 'Lynch', 'magnificent', 'film', 'THE', 'ELEPHANT', 'MAN', 'Broadly', 'speaking', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'fair', 'portion', 'details', 'are', 'totally', 'fictitious', 'conflated', 'several', 'real-life', 'sources', 'general', 'outline', 'script', 'true', 'Merrick', 'first', 'encounter', 'Dr', 'Frederick', 'Treves', 'Hopkins', 'man', 'who', 'helped', 'regain', 'dignity', 'death', 'trying', 'sleep', 'normal', 'people', 'final', 'scene', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'unforgettable', 'moments', 'film.The', 'cast', 'THE', 'ELEPHANT', 'MAN', 'utterly', 'top-notch', 'only', 'eyes', 'visible', 'Christopher', 'Tucker', 'extraordinary', 'makeup', 'John', 'Hurt', 'give', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'recitation', '23rd', 'Psalm', 'heartbreaking', 'teatime', 'visit', 'Treves', 'wife', 'fine', 'cameo', 'Hannah', 'Gordon', 'reading', 'Romeo', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Juliet', 'great', 'cameo', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'performance', 'Treves', 'nicely', 'nuanced', 'evincing', 'subtle', 'deeply', 'human', 'contradictions', 'where', 'lesser', 'actor', 'might', 'have', 'portrayed', 'mere', 'two-dimensional', 'Virtuous', 'Leading', 'Man', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'usual', 'brilliant', 'self', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'excellent', 'sinister', 'yet', 'somehow', 'tragic', 'Mr', 'Bytes', 'various', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'up', 'very', 'high', 'standard', 'set', 'leading', 'players.Since', '1980', 'was', 'year', 'RAGING', 'BULL', 'ORDINARY', 'PEOPLE', 'perhaps', 'understandable', 'THE', 'ELEPHANT', 'MAN', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', '8', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'nominated', 'opinion', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'What', 'scandalous', 'however', 'fact', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'stunning', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'Francis', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'Oscar', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'GLORY', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Lynch', 'direction', 'finally', 'revelation', 'was', 'only', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'working', 'greatest', 'actors', 'living', 'time', 'hand', 'never', 'been', 'surer', 'Not', 'THE', 'STRAIGHT', 'STORY', 'also', 'incidentally', 'photographed', 'Francis', 'would', 'again', 'attempt', 'so', 'direct', 'presentation', 'results', 'here', 'are', 'simply', 'superb', ""n't"", 'hollow', 'note', 'empty', 'image', 'entire', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'Lynch', 'later', 'efforts.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'sound', 'likewise', 'Extras', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'interesting', 'bits', 'concerning', 'Christopher', 'Tucker', 'makeup', 'brief', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'comments', 'Tucker', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'producer', 'Jonathan', 'Sanger', 'uncredited', 'executive', 'producer', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'yes', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'something', 'David', 'Lynch', 'as', 'well', 'things', 'considered', 'fairly', 'minor', 'quibble', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'DVD', 'pick', 'up', 'today']",The Elephant Man VHS
210267,A95SF04RX9G8,6300214044,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[3, 12]","The Elephant Man tells the story of John Merrick, a severely deformed man who lived around the turn of the century, and was the subject of ridicule and general horror for those who only saw him as a circus freak. However, for those who took the time to get to know him, and saw past his physical oddities, he was a man of gentle compassion, and was as capable of fitting in with society as any other human, but only if society would give him a chance.As the film begins, John Merrick (John Hurt) is an attraction in a freak show, being labeled as The Terrible Elephant Man. He is treated as an animal by the proprieter of the show, beaten relentlessly in order to perform for the gawkers who come to see his misfortune. The elephant man draws the interest of Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), who rescues him from the freak show with the intent of studying his condition in a hospital. Treves is surprised to discover that Merrick is actually quite intelligent and is able to read, write, and talk, though he has been so mistreated that he often has difficulty speaking to strangers.Soon, there are articles in the newspaper describing the elephant man and his condition, and the people who read these articles either respond with compassion or exploitation. Compassion is shown by the stage actress Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft), who is absolutely delighted to find out that Merrick has a love for theater, though he has never attended a live show, due to his condition. A man named Bytes does the exploiting, bringing curious people--usually drunk--to see the elephant man and recoil in terror at his appearance. Meanwhile, while all this attention is being paid to Merrick, Treves wonders whether he has helped the situation any--people are still just as interested in seeing this deformed man, it's just in a less hostile environment--or whether Merrick's situation can be helped at all.The Elephant Man is based on a true story, and surely the story has been embellished with dramatic elements, but regardless, once the film finds its footing, it has some compelling spots. John Hurt does a masterful job in creating a sympathetic character out of a man who is at first glance a monster. Buried beneath a veritable mountain of make-up and masks, Hurt is able to use the restrictions to his advantage, allowing us to see both the physical deformities of this man as well as his struggle to be accepted by society.Director David Lynch filmed The Elephant Man in beautiful stark black and white--partially because of the make-up, partially because of the period in which the story takes place, and, I think, partially because of the mystery and shadows that black and white allows that cannot be rivaled by color. The message of the story is pretty clear: don't judge a person based on their looks. This is obviously a good message to preach, but I'm not sure if The Elephant Man did all that it could have to convey it.",3,"Top-notch acting, but overall could have been better",1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2926,"['Elephant', 'Man', 'story', 'John', 'Merrick', 'severely', 'deformed', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'turn', 'century', 'was', 'subject', 'ridicule', 'general', 'horror', 'who', 'only', 'saw', 'circus', 'freak', 'However', 'who', 'took', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'saw', 'physical', 'oddities', 'was', 'man', 'gentle', 'compassion', 'was', 'capable', 'fitting', 'society', 'other', 'human', 'only', 'society', 'would', 'give', 'chance.As', 'film', 'John', 'Merrick', 'John', 'Hurt', 'attraction', 'freak', 'show', 'being', 'labeled', 'Terrible', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'treated', 'animal', 'proprieter', 'show', 'beaten', 'relentlessly', 'order', 'perform', 'gawkers', 'who', 'come', 'see', 'misfortune', 'elephant', 'man', 'interest', 'Dr.', 'Frederick', 'Treves', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'freak', 'show', 'intent', 'studying', 'condition', 'hospital', 'surprised', 'discover', 'Merrick', 'actually', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'able', 'read', 'write', 'talk', 'been', 'so', 'mistreated', 'often', 'difficulty', 'speaking', 'strangers.Soon', 'are', 'articles', 'newspaper', 'describing', 'elephant', 'man', 'condition', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'articles', 'respond', 'compassion', 'exploitation', 'Compassion', 'shown', 'stage', 'actress', 'Mrs.', 'Kendal', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'who', 'absolutely', 'delighted', 'find', 'out', 'Merrick', 'love', 'theater', 'never', 'attended', 'live', 'show', 'due', 'condition', 'man', 'named', 'Bytes', 'exploiting', 'bringing', 'curious', 'people', 'usually', 'drunk', 'see', 'elephant', 'man', 'recoil', 'terror', 'appearance', 'Meanwhile', 'attention', 'being', 'paid', 'Merrick', 'wonders', 'helped', 'situation', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'interested', 'seeing', 'deformed', 'man', 'just', 'less', 'hostile', 'environment', 'Merrick', 'situation', 'can', 'be', 'helped', 'all.The', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'surely', 'story', 'been', 'embellished', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'regardless', 'once', 'film', 'footing', 'compelling', 'spots', 'John', 'Hurt', 'masterful', 'job', 'creating', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'glance', 'monster', 'Buried', 'veritable', 'mountain', 'make-up', 'masks', 'Hurt', 'able', 'use', 'restrictions', 'advantage', 'allowing', 'see', 'physical', 'deformities', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'struggle', 'be', 'accepted', 'society.Director', 'David', 'Lynch', 'filmed', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'beautiful', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'partially', 'make-up', 'partially', 'period', 'story', 'place', 'think', 'partially', 'mystery', 'black', 'white', 'allows', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'rivaled', 'color', 'message', 'story', 'pretty', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'person', 'based', 'looks', 'obviously', 'good', 'message', 'preach', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'convey']",The Elephant Man VHS

I actually cried the first time I saw it... even after several viewings, I still get misty-eyed.  This is the true story of John Merrick, a horribly disfigured man who became famous as a sideshow freak known as The Elephant Man.  The movie, itself, is as close to the truth as any other Elephant Man story told, with certain exceptions. David Lynch's direction gives it a thoroughly haunting but beautiful atmosphere, though depraved and ugly as some of the story is. Anthony Hopkins gives a brilliant performance as Dr. Frederick Treves, who discovers The Elephant Man and brings him to the hospital for treatment and study. Freddie Jones is superb as the carnival barker who enslaves The Elephant Man and guards his money-making freak. John Gielgud is perfect as the hospital administrator. Anne Bancroft costars as a theatre actress who begins visiting Merrick and becomes his friend. But, the truly outstanding performance of this film is that of John Hurt as John Merrick/The Elephant Man.

210274,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6300214044,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 1]","The tragic true story of John Merrick is the basis for this moving and touching film starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.  Shot in black & white, `The Elephant Man' never loses a single strand of authenticity or emotional weight in its production but continues to strike a chord with the viewer with every watch.  What's so important about films like this one is that it exposes the hypocrisy and audacity of most people today, the complete disregard for the welfare of others and that fear of anything we don't understand.John Merrick (John Hurt) was born with a horrifically disfiguring disease that made him a social outcast.  When he was found by Doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) John was being paraded about by circus sideshow entertainer Bytes (Freddie Jones), living as a freak to society, as an animal for other peoples amusement.  John lived his entire life up to that point as an unwanted and unloved creature, not as a human being.  His feelings, his interests and the mere fact that he was an intelligent member of society went completely ignored by everyone around him.  That was until he was taken in by the hospital Treves worked for.Although at first a bit reluctant, the majority of the staff at the hospital begin to take to John, and for the first time in his life he has people noticing more than just his face.  But along with the good comes some more of the bad as some of the staff still decide to profit off of John's misfortunes, tormenting him night after night.  What's so incredibly disheartening is the truth this film makes very clear.  Towards the end of the film I found myself crying, not because of the horrible way he was treated but because of the kindness bestowed upon him.  It made me realize that I was crying because that kindness is such a rarity these days and that is a sad realization.With solid performances by the entire cast, most notably John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, but also by Anne Bancroft who plays a famed theater actress by the name of Mrs. Kendall who takes a liking to John as well as Hannah Gordon who plays Anne, Frederick's wife.  Her acceptance of John is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  This is surly a film that should not be missed, a film that should be on everyone's list of most important and inspirational films of all time.  If we could all just learn to accept those around us for who they are on the inside, then, just then maybe...but even that doesn't look promising.",5,Why are people so afraid of what they don't understand?,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,2460,"['tragic', 'true', 'story', 'John', 'Merrick', 'basis', 'moving', 'touching', 'film', 'starring', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Shot', 'black', 'white', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'never', 'single', 'strand', 'authenticity', 'emotional', 'weight', 'production', 'strike', 'chord', 'viewer', 'watch', 'What', 'so', 'important', 'films', 'one', 'hypocrisy', 'audacity', 'most', 'people', 'today', 'complete', 'disregard', 'welfare', 'others', 'fear', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand.John', 'Merrick', 'John', 'Hurt', 'was', 'born', 'horrifically', 'disfiguring', 'disease', 'made', 'social', 'outcast', 'When', 'was', 'found', 'Doctor', 'Frederick', 'Treves', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'John', 'was', 'being', 'paraded', 'circus', 'sideshow', 'entertainer', 'Bytes', 'Freddie', 'Jones', 'living', 'freak', 'society', 'animal', 'other', 'peoples', 'amusement', 'John', 'lived', 'entire', 'life', 'up', 'point', 'unwanted', 'unloved', 'creature', 'not', 'human', 'being', 'feelings', 'interests', 'mere', 'fact', 'was', 'intelligent', 'member', 'society', 'went', 'completely', 'ignored', 'everyone', 'was', 'was', 'taken', 'hospital', 'worked', 'for.Although', 'first', 'bit', 'reluctant', 'majority', 'staff', 'hospital', 'begin', 'take', 'John', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'people', 'noticing', 'more', 'just', 'face', 'good', 'more', 'bad', 'staff', 'still', 'profit', 'off', 'John', 'misfortunes', 'tormenting', 'night', 'night', 'What', 'so', 'incredibly', 'disheartening', 'truth', 'film', 'very', 'clear', 'end', 'film', 'found', 'crying', 'not', 'horrible', 'way', 'was', 'treated', 'kindness', 'bestowed', 'made', 'realize', 'was', 'crying', 'kindness', 'such', 'rarity', 'days', 'sad', 'realization.With', 'solid', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'also', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'who', 'famed', 'theater', 'actress', 'name', 'Mrs.', 'Kendall', 'who', 'liking', 'John', 'as', 'well', 'Hannah', 'Gordon', 'who', 'Anne', 'Frederick', 'wife', 'acceptance', 'John', 'heartwarming', 'heartbreaking', 'surly', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'list', 'most', 'important', 'inspirational', 'films', 'time', 'could', 'just', 'learn', 'accept', 'who', 'are', 'inside', 'then', 'just', 'then', 'maybe', 'even', ""n't"", 'look', 'promising']",The Elephant Man VHS
210275,A39LRCAB9G8F21,6300214044,Daniel H. Hawkins,"[8, 9]","The Elephant Man, released in 1980, is a remarkable film.  It is the true story of Englishman John Merrick, who was born with a rare disease that has left him horribly disfigured.  He is exploited by a sideshow circus owner until he is rescued by Treves, a physician from the London Hospital, who wishes to study his case.  But as Treves gets to know Merrick, he realizes that underneath the hideous visage lies a gentle, loving soul.  But just as Merrick finds contentment, he is kidnapped by the sideshow owner, who feels that he has been cheated by the doctor.John Merrick is played by an unrecognizable John Hurt, who gives an incredible performance underneath all that make up.  Merrick's rescuer, Dr. Treves, is played to near perfection by Anthony Hopkins.  Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, and Wendy Hiller play minor roles.The Elephant Man was shot on high-quality black and white film, which adds to the Victorian Era atmosphere, and makes the deformed face of John Merrick much more interesting than color would have.  This was David Lynch's second major directorial effort, and it remains one of his best films.  And, quite shockingly, the film's executive producer was none other than Mel Brooks. But Brooks left his name off the credits so that filmgoers wouldn't misconstrue The Elephant Man as a comedy.  The only mention of Brooks's name is found in the production company, Brooksfilms.The film received 8 Academy Award nominations, although it didn't win any Oscars.  But the creation of the make-up for the John Merrick character did begin the process for the Academy adding a new award category for Best Make Up for future years.Although the film is ultimately a tragedy, The Elephant Man is a film about kindness, dignity, and love.

You would think they had walked in on a body that had been hacked into pieces. It was the saddest thing ever. And this was the framework for the movie. We get a few glimpses of the Elephant Man before we finally see him full-on, including all the deformities on his face and the back of his head. And we eventually get to know him not as the Elephant Man, but as John Merrick, an intelligent human being with thoughts and feelings just like the rest of us. (The intelligence factor may be debated for some of the other characters in the movie.)I first saw this movie when I was a kid and I thought it was old because of the black and white. I see now that it is not; it was shot that way for atmosphere. It's probably considered classic now though, even though it's not really old enough yet (in my opinion).I love the lesson that this movie teaches. At its simplest, it is to treat your fellow human beings with kindness. There are a lot of things wrong with the world, but if everyone followed that one rule, we would be well on our way to a better world for everyone.It really is a shame this movie did not win any of the Oscars it was nominated for. I know Ordinary People won that year (because it happened to be the year I was born). The Oscars have made some questionable decisions sometimes, choosing some ridiculous movies as winners, but at least Ordinary People was a worthy movie dealing with another very important topic.It would be nice if The Elephant Man were re-released. $60?

The subject is amazing : the utmost deformed and rejected freak in Victorian society. But straight away we have to know it does not deal with the past. It deals with our modern world, with us. It reveals all our defects and shortcomings. Human society is cruel and cruelty is natural to man. The cruelty of voyeurism : to see someone who is utterly different is a pleasure for our little souls. We like seeing what we are not. We like watching what we could have been. We like scrutinizing what we have had the luck not to be. The being who is different is a freak and we enjoy gazing, gaping and staring at him. We do not care for the pain we may cause. We do not care for the suffering we may impose. We just care for our little freakish pleasure, this little feeling that we have escaped the unutterable abyss of rejection. And young boys only find excitement in chasing him and older men only find the exhilaration of coming to the lynching point. Reject or even kill that atrocity that reminds us of our destiny and of our luck : the luck that we want to believe is natural, though it is pure fate. And they are on the very verge of purging the world of the suffering man who does not have the appearance of a man. And yet there is some hope in this society. And this hope comes from doctors who may have the heart to consider a human being in his soul and not in his body. And this hope comes from an old nurse and some younger ones who find pleasure in helping the rejected one and giving him the pleasure of their attention, and conversation, and even little presents. And this hope comes from an artist who has the strength to see beyond the surface and feel the heart and the soul that are trembling in those out-of-shape limbs and flesh. And hope comes from the fact that, providing some minimal human conditions are fulfilled, this perfect paria reveals himself a sensitive and even creative human being, provided we go deep in the abyss to get that humanity back to the surface, back out of the prison of rejection. And yet the film is sad because this distorted man wants one night to be so normal that he decides to sleep the way other people sleep but the way he cannot sleep, he shouldn't even try to sleep, and in the morning he will be dead. Dead with the dream of beauty and perfection he has encountered at the theater and with some friends, but dead all the same. To intregrate the one who is different is a lot more complex than just trying to forget that he is different. We must accept that difference but also make him accept it and make ourselves live up to it. It is in the differences of other people that we can find our most enriching present and future. It is not in looking for our normality that we will expand our personalities. It is only by integrating other people's differences in our way of thinking and feeling that we will become better and we will multiply our own assets.

210292,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,6300214044,Jason N. Mical,"[13, 19]","""The Elephant Man,"" director David Lynch's sophomore major film effort, seems to be groomed for greatness from the beginning.  The story of John Merrick, a horribly deformed person who lived in London in the Victorian age and became somewhat of a celebrity among medical and social circles in that time, ""The Elephant Man"" is many things: a historical throwback to an earlier style of filmmaking, a story of human triumph, and a film designed to tug at the heartstrings and manipulate with them.  Lynch isn't known for making ""easy"" films.  Even his blue-collar masterpiece ""The Straight Story,"" released more than 15 years after ""The Elephant Man,"" has a depth and complexity not found in many novels.  ""Elephant"" may stand as the one exception to this rule.In a dank, filthy, black-and-white London, Dr. Frederick Treves (played by a much younger Anthony Hopkins before he became typecast as another, more evil Doctor) visits a carnival sideshow.  Therein, he discovers John Merrick, the Elephant Man, a person whose bone structure has been twisted so that it appears he has a tusk growing from his swollen, malformed face.  Treves recognizes Merrick as a medical curiosity, and plucks him from being a carnival exhibit to being a teaching tool for his classes.  In a fit of compassion, Treves wonders if Merrick might actually be able to understand what goes on around him, and discovers that he is correct: the Elephant Man, while deformed on the outside, has a perfectly working mind and is fully cognizant of others, language, and actions.  The rest of the movie follows Merrick as he tries to be recognized for the simple fact that he's a human being.Because of this fairly straightforward treatment of a very serious subject - what does it mean to be human, and to have human rights and dignity - ""Elephant"" doesn't reach the same levels of depth as ""Blue Velvet"" or even ""Straight Story.""  It's unfortunate, because Lynch is a very capable director, and it almost seems as if decisions were made not on the basis of what would make the best movie, but what would appeal to more people (and more award-shows).Don't misunderstand, ""Elephant"" manages its subject matter with far more finesse than most other films that attempt to breach the same territory, it's simply that it had the potential to be more than it was.  The acting is wonderful, and John Hurt was literally robbed for his Oscar as Merrick - the emotional range he portrays with body language alone reflects a mastery of his craft.  As with all Lynch films, the meticulous attention to detail and cinematographical excellence are welcome qualities in a time when most movies settle for computer-rendered effects and pointing the camera at some people.Rent ""Elephant Man.""

210293,A1CO6WZ5EK6P4T,6300214044,"J. De Sapio ""N. De Sapio""","[4, 4]","David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) is based (with some fictionalization) on the life story of Joseph ""John"" Merrick, an Englishman who was called the Elephant Man because of the grotesque, congenital deformities of his body and face.  Shot in black and white, THE ELEPHANT MAN opens with homage to another film classic set in Victorian England, David Lean's OLIVER TWIST (1948).  In that film, Oliver's mother struggles through a violent storm before giving birth at a workhouse.  In this film, John's mother is knocked down during pregnancy by an elephant (one of a touring menagerie).  Then a baby's cry is heard:  like little Oliver Twist, young John Merrick enters a world of hardship - made all the worse by the hideous disfigurement which will force him to work as a sideshow freak.Next, we meet Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a London surgeon who takes an interest in Merrick's fate after seeing him on display at a local freak show.  Treves pays the Elephant Man's cruel manager, Mr. Bytes, to give him over to the care of the Royal London Hospital.  At first, the deformity of Merrick's mouth, and his extreme shyness and fear, cause Treves to think him ""an imbecile""; all he can do is grunt and groan or keep silent.  But in a stunning scene Merrick is overheard reciting his favorite Psalm; Treves and his colleagues realize that they are in fact caring for a man of uncommon intelligence, sensitivity, and refinement.  Soon, ""Mr. Merrick"" is set up in his own hospital suite, given elegant, gentleman's clothing, and introduced to London ""Society.""  He gains poise and shows his innate gentleness more and more.  He has tea with lords and ladies and finds a kindred spirit in Mrs. Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft), an actress.  Yet all the time his past threatens to overtake him, in the form of old associates who lurk about, hoping to kidnap back their profitable ""freak"" attraction.  And also there is the nagging question, put by Treves himself, as to whether the drawing room is not merely a more respectable form of the sideshow, with Merrick ""on display"" before those of his visitors who come only to gape at him.It has been suggested that the movie's Treves was conceived as an opportunist, more interested in career advancement than in humanitarianism.  But this view is at odds with Hopkins' sympathetic portrayal.  A moment early in the film sets the tone:  as Treves has his first look at the Elephant Man at the freak show, a tear slips from his eye at the sight of such degradation.  Empathy is shown also by John Gielgud as hospital chairman F.C. Carr Gomm:  his is a warm, reassuring presence, and the characterization is not without (welcome) humor.  The Elephant Man's other supporters include his nurse (a prickly but good-hearted Wendy Hiller) and Treves' wife, with whom he has a most touching teatime conversation.  In short, Merrick's new friends may not be perfect, but they are humane, unlike those old ""friends"" who would purposely humiliate him.  (Just watch, if you can bear to, their truly ugly mockery of him before they spirit him away from the hospital.)John Hurt as John Merrick exudes spiritual beauty.  Just as surely as that refined English voice emanates from that twisted mouth, his kindness and gentleness make the viewer, in time, nearly forget his appearance, initially so shocking.  When one watches Hurt in THE ELEPHANT MAN, one feels as though one is watching the real-life Mr. Merrick (who by all accounts had the same genteel qualities).  Higher praise can scarcely be possible.The film's sense of atmosphere is superb, its London a steamy, grimy, crowded place; constant whirring and clanking sounds remind us that this is the 1880's, the Industrial Revolution (which was itself dehumanizing).  Countless moments haunt the memory long after the film ends - Treves' appalled look and falling tear when he first sees Merrick; Byte's boy's imitation of his master's harsh commands; Merrick's comforting of Mrs. Treves (""Oh, please...Oh, please..."") when she breaks down in his presence, and his almost musical exclamations of joy over kindnesses shown him; the terrible scene in which Merrick is cornered by a mob in a train station (quite the equal in dramatic impact of ""Cortigiani, vil razza dannata,"" the deformed jester's scene before the jeering courtiers in Verdi's opera RIGOLETTO); his magical first (and last) visit to the theatre - but none so much as Merrick's transcendent death scene, accompanied by Samuel Barber's elegiac ""Adagio for Strings"" (the rest of the film's score is by John Morris and is close to the Barber in style and orchestration).

210294,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6300214044,J from NY,"[2, 2]","""The Elephant Man"", with John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins (along with Hannibal Lecter his best piece of acting) is a powerhouse of a film that makes you feel fortunate and unfortunate at the same time--fortunate that you yourself can walk in the street without provoking screams, and unfortunate that you live in a world where a person's physical appearance will cause screams.Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins), a doctor and a devotee of the deformed and the lost, somehow gets wind of a carnival sideshow with a ""freak"" who is actually authentic--""the elephant man"", a hideously deformed young person whose physical appearance is so horrendous that no one seems to mind as he is abused by his sketchy master (something strange and homoerotic is ever present in this drunken brute's relentless determination to ""own"" Hurt's character), starved, and kept in a sideshow until Treves comes along and emancipates him.At first we believe that Merrick is mentally handicapped, as all he can do to communicate with Treves is grunt and groan in fright.  It turns out, however, (and this is never explained at any length) that Merrick is extremely intelligent and very religious.  Through all the heavily layered and almost suffocating makeup Hurt brings home a characterization that is as unforgettable as it is haunting.  Merrick is a lonely, abused soul fully cognizant of his place in the world.  A side of him seems to believe he is an animal deserving of abuse, while the other side is an astute literary gentleman who wants, in his own somewhat garbled words, only to ""be good"".There are scenes in this movie that will make you absolutely furious and scenes that are worthy of tears.  Others will make you happy as you see Merrick go from having a wretched, worthless life to an actually happy and full existence courtesy of Treves.  The relationship between Treves and Merricks is, beyond doubt, one of the most believable and heart-rending bonds between two men ever filmed.The weaknesses are negligible and we can put most of them down to Lynch's unrelenting need to inject the depressing and  strange where they have no place.  The ending, for example, while touching, is inexcusably vague for a film which has commanded that much power up till that point.  Did Merrick commit suicide?  Are we supposed to be seeing him ascend to heaven?

210295,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,6300214044,J. O. Booker,"[2, 2]","The film opens under the tent of a circus. The Elephant Man is the main attraction of the freak shows. A physician, Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), passes through a menagerie of Siamese twins, strongmen, fat women, pickled abortions, etc., until he arrives at the Elephant Man's tent. Treves pays the carnival barker, Bytes (Freddie Jones), a fee for a private exhibition of the Elephant Man. Bytes leads Treves into the Elephant Man's tent. It's dark inside. The Elephant Man peeks out of the shadows. Treves is astonished.  He leases the Elephant Man from Mr. Bytes.  The Elephant Man transforms a wing of the London hospital into a freak show, and Treves is the circus barker as he catalogues the Elephant Man's deformed body. The physician waves over the reeking bags and nasty testicle-like sacs lapping out of John's back. The physician waves over the huge fibrous globes displacing John's skull; the physician waves over the swollen twisted chain of John's vertebrae.In some, John inspires fear; in others, he inspires sympathy. His deformed body is a funhouse mirror, returning the ugliness of those who gaze at him, beat him, and exploit him. Through the first forty-five minutes of the film, John only snorts, wheezes, and growls in his mask. An ominous air surrounds him. The physician's kindness, respect, and patience win John's trust. Then, we discover that John can not only speak, but--despite the crippling distortion of his mouth--he speaks elegant English. He quotes bible scriptures. He even writes poetry. John's only possession is a picture of his beautiful deceased mother. Elephants trampled her to death when she was only twenty-one.  In John's nightmares, one of those elephants--his father--impregnates his mother.A beautiful and sympathetic actress (Anne Bancroft) visits Merrick. Her open interest in John starts a new trend. Now, John plays the humble and frequent host to London's upper society. The hospital's head nurse, old Mrs. Mothershead--Wendy Hiller, dislikes John's growing fame. The old woman scolds Treves for making John a freak all over again. Treves is defensive--at least at the hospital, John's treated with some measure of human dignity and decency. John's not abused at the hospital as he is with Bytes, the carnival barker.The carnival suffers in John's absence; the Elephant Man was the freak show's most popular draw. Bytes interrupts John's new life, invades the hospital, and steals back his cash cow, the Elephant Man. Bytes treats John coldly, as one would treat an unfaithful spouse. The magic was gone. The Elephant Man has become a figure of sympathy. In a drunken fit of anger, Bytes drags John out of his trailer and tosses him into a cage full of baboons. The circus's other freaks pity John. They free him from the baboon cage and spirit him out of the circus.Traumatized, John hides his head--his face--under a sack and begins his long journey home: the hospital. He boards a train to London. At the train station, his hooded face, stooped back, and limping gait attracts a mob. They unmask him and flush him to the bowels of the station. They corner him in a restroom. Amid steampipes and rows of urinals and rusted toilets, John cries at the top of his lungs: ""I am not an animal, I am not an animal!"" The crowd dissipates, and the film moves to its final scene.The Elephant film is a poignant straightforward film directed by David Lynch, known for eccentric films like Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Wild at Heart, and Blue Velvet. Photographer Freddie Francis shot the film in black and white, a mode that evokes the era of the story and the mystique surrounding the film's subject. All of the main actors--Anne Bancroft, Anthony Hopkins, and Wendy Hiller--performed perfectly. But the biggest star of the Elephant Man was John Hurt. How he didn't win the Oscar in 1980, I'll never know.

This movie, directed by David Lynch, was filmed in black-and-white, unusual for a movie made in 1980.  However, black-and-white was THE way to film this.  From a psychological standpoint, black-and-white fits the story so well.  This movie is about Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed human oddity who lived in late nineteenth century England, and what he went through during his life.  I don't want to give away too much, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  The acting is great, especially by John Hurt, who plays the lead role.  A younger Anthony Hopkins also gives a great performance as Merrick's doctor.  This movie has great cinematography throughout.

210298,A2Q0ERQ25AQQNG,6300214044,Jonas Cukierman,"[2, 2]","I have always had unusual fascinations, and Joseph Merrick is no exception. At the time The Elephant Man was released in 1980, I was but a mere second grader. I was enthralled by the mystery and spook factor of  such a stark and dreary film. Today, I am a film student/director. My films  are mostly in the style of David Lynch, David Fincher and Ridley Scott -  dark and eerie. The mood which low lighting creates is unsurpassed in its  ability to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Furthermore, the majority of the  stories I write and the films that I intend to make one day, all revolve  around persons whom have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable  struggles. While as a boy it was the esoteric 'creepiness' which interested  me, I look back upon such experiences as being instrumental in shaping me  artistically. I feel there is no better story to tell than that of people  who live in a world of intolerance and have the ability to create for  themselves a life despite their outcast status. My compliments to you as  well for dedicating yourself to such an endlessly interesting subject as  Joseph Merrick. His is a lesson to be relished not only from the  perspective of disabilities, but from one of self-respect, steadfastness  and determination; Very unique characteristics in a situation which might  daunt the average man.The Elephant Man is one of the few examples of a  genuine masterpice. It encompasses all the necessary components required to  create a balanced and rythmic piece of work. The cinematography by Freddie  Francis renders a cold, hard world of poverty and strife in London of the  late 19th century. A mood which sets the stage in painting the portrait of  a man whose life was plagued tenfold on account of his ghastly deformation.  In a society where appearance was everything and pretense the norm, the  film's various themes include the fact that there always have been people  who were altruistic enough to go against the grain. In this I refer not  only to Joseph Merrick, but to Sir Frederick Treves and Dame Madge Kendall.  Two figures at the upper eschelon of Victorian society who did not permit  the trappings of wealth, beauty and power to control their need to bestow  kindness upon a person in dire circumstances. The music in this film is  perfectly calculated to complement the sadness surrounding a predicament  such as the shrouding Merrick. Other times the music boasts the lavish  entity which was Victorian society. And still at other moments, the sick  fascination of the lowly freakshow spectators crowd is demonstrated in the  ratchety strains of carnival  bells and whistles.

210299,A2GB5CG77LGQRB,6300214044,Jublistic,"[3, 4]","I hadn't heard much about The Elephant Man until I came across some reviews and I found myself intrigued. I am able to admit that The Elephant Man is one of the few films that made me shed a tear, and is a stunning, thought-provoking and underrated picture that deserved a much bigger audience than it got.Based on the true story of John Merrick (John Hurt), a 19th-century Englishman afflicted with a disfiguring congenital disease. With the help of kindly Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick attempts to regain the dignity he lost after years spent as a side-show freak.It's very easy to feel sorry and love for John Merrick, and it is very easy to feel hate for the people who tortured him, and this really shows us that this film is able to display a heap of emotions and do in a brilliant and amazing way. Personally, I found Merrick much more beautiful than the people who laughed and made fun of him, because his heart and soul was so much in the right place that it made you believe his appearance was also, even though he seemed deformed, he was really just normal. Dr. Frederick Treves is portrayed excellently by a very determined Anthony Hopkins, and the supporting cast which includes Anne Bancroft, are splendid in never-better roles. But, it is John Hurt who steals the show, his performance is quite simply a masterpiece (just like this film) of controlled emotion, and is a performance that will leave forever in my mind.Stunning, real, emotional and masterful, The Elephant Man awes, engages and jabs at the heart.

However, it must have made some sort of emotional impact before I have always been terrified of viewing this film in the 20-plus years that have past since then. The most disturbing aspect to me was the inhumane treatment John Merrick received. Just today I got up my courage and bought the DVD at the music store. I sat, white knuckles and all-expecting the worst. Well, I got through it. For one thing, it didn't seem as ominous this go-round. (Funny how your perceptions change as an adult). The fact that this was a period piece works to the film's benefit in that it hasn't dated at all. I am glad the producers and director agreed to use black-and-white film because it adds to the authenticity. What surprised me most was how much I had actually forgotten: the scene in the monkey cage, the fact that Anne Bancroft appeared, and more. What did always stick in my memory was what I refer to as the ""raid"" scene. (When the sleazy Night Porter brings his ""customers"" from the pub to Merrick's room, carrying John around, forcing the cheap tarts to kiss him, and then holding a mirror up to his face to purposely shock him.) Upon viewing The Elephant Man as an adult, my favorite scenes are now the most beautiful yet the saddest ones: when John meets Treeves' wife and says he never meant to be a disappointment to his mother, and the final scene as Merrick carefully takes the pillows off the bed and places them on the table. This film should be mandatory study for all North American high school students. Though even then, I am sure there would be more than a few jaded teens who would find some sort of comedy in it.

Having said that, allot of work went into the movie with makeup, and the acting is first rate.  here below is the real story, sad but true story.This movie is Closed Captioned, AND for the first time that I have ever seen, the extra's in the DVD are Closed Captioned also.  ThanksMerrick was housed in the London Hospital where be remained until his mysterious death from """" suffocation """".He was a naive and ill man whose final years were not filled simply with ease and friendly callers.His disease was worsening, its crippling effect becoming more painful. For hours he would sit staring into space, despondently and rhythmically tapping at his pillow or the arm of his chair with his distorted right hand. Officially, however, Merrick gave his contemporary well-wishers what they wanted -- gratitude and a sentimental feeling that theirs was a good world.On the last day of his life he seemed quite as usual, so very usual that Treves found the circumstances of his death ""peculiar."" Merrick had chatted with his nurses and had accepted his lunch and yet two hours later was found dead, his food still untouched. He was presumed asphyxiated, the weight of his huge head having choked off his air supply when he lay down on his back to sleep.This was odd, because Merrick knew well how to live with his enormous head. He never slept recumbent but had always tucked himself into a fetal position and dozed sitting up. with the weight of the head supported by his knees. The ""Report of the Coroner's Inquest"" published in the Times for 16 April 1890, also contains a peculiarity: ""The Coronor said that the man had been sent round the shows as a curiosity, and when death took place it was decided as a matter of prudence to hold this inquest.""Surely there could not have been much precedent for an inquest based on these premises. The death of the Elephant Man seems shrouded in a mystery as impenetrable as the full-length cloak and strangely curtained hat that covered Merrick from head to toe when he went out on the streets,Since there was no sign of a struggle,could Merrick have taken his own life?Treves never says so directly, but he certainly implies as much in his 1926 pamphlet, ""The Elephant Man."" Written nearly three decades after Merrick's death, the pamphlet retrospectively strives to account for its circumstances. Treves claims of Merrick:He often said to me that he wished he could lie down to sleep ""like other people."" I think on this last night he must, with some determination, have made the experiment. The pillow was soft, and the head, when placed on it, must have fallen back-wards and caused a dislocation of the neck. Thus it came about that his death was due to the desire that had dominated his life -- the pathetic but hopeless desire to be ""like other people.Treves posits that the Elephant Man grew tired of being a Victorian other self. More practically, Merrick was also very insecure about his lodgings. Because of two successful, large-scale appeals by the London Hospital, he had been allowed to stay on in his hospital rooms until he died.Since he was not expected to live long, his stay was not projected as an impossible financial drain. But Merrick never got over the idea that he might be moved at any time, an obsession that Treves also focuses on in his narrative.This insecurity, coupled with his occasional despondency and his fear of people's gaze, might indeed have accounted for a desire to sleep forever.Merrick felt so deeply marked by the eyes of others that he told Treves he wanted his next move to be to an asylum for the blind, Perhaps he had been reading Frankenstein and recalled that the Monster's only gentle treatment came from an old blind man.Thus there was darkness still in this man's new life.Gentle, spiteless, and uncynical he might have been, free from sadness and anxiety he was not.Earnestly, Treves acknowledges that darkness in the conclusion to his pamphlet:He had been plunged into the Slough of Despond, but with manly steps he gained the farther shore. He had been made ""a spectacle to all men"" in the heartless streets of Vanity Fair.He had been ill-treated and reviled and bespattered with the mud of Disdain. He had escaped the clutches of the Giant Despair, and at last had reached the ""Place of Deliverance,"" where ""his burden loosed from off his back, so that he saw it no more.Here his doctor rewrites Merrick's life not as that of a monster but as that of a pilgrim, echoing one of the Victorians' favorite stories.Merrick was converted by Victorian doctors, blue bloods, and show people from Elephant Man to Everyman.Small wonder his death was sentimentalized.Despite the inquest and Treves's concern over ""peculiarity,"" there could be little official talk of suicide in Merrick's case.",5,Great

210312,A36EW68H08UOCS,6300214044,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[5, 5]","The Elephant Man is a film of incredible passion and power.  For those who think &quot;power&quot; in the movies involves supernatural abilities or mastery of martial arts or destructive weapons - The Elephant Man is perhaps not for you.David Lynch's film is shot in black and white which gives a Victorian feel to the era depicted, but also gives a startling chiarascuro visual to many scenes.Much of the information about the life of Mr. Merrick was obtained from accounts written by Dr. Treves, who became so celebrated that he was chosen to be Royal Physician, so it is perhaps not surprising that Treves comes off well in this film.  The central performances are by John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins as Treves, and they are both absolutely stunning.  I have viewed the film a half-dozen times, and there are moments that I am moved every single time.The Elephant Man suffers from terrible physical deformities that are only gradually shown to the audience.  But we discover that his mental faculties are not hindered at all, and the scene in which this discovery is made is absolutely astonishing.The late John Gielgud does excellent work as the hospital administrator, Mr. Carr Gomm.  In the scene after it is revealed that the Elephant Man has normal intelligence  Carr Gomm takes  Treves aside.&quot;Can you IMAGINE what sort of life he has had?&quot; (Merrick has spent his life up to that point as a side-show freak, beaten and jeered at.)Treves looks absent-mindedly out the window before starting to reply &quot;Yes, I think I ....&quot;Carr Gomm rebukes him sharply. &quot;No you can't!&quot; He softens his voice. &quot;No one can.&quot;And watching that scene we TRY to imagine the myriad of humiliations and sufferings that the poor man has endured simply for his unfortunate appearance.  But we realize that we cannot &quot;walk a mile in his shoes&quot; and we recognize that we truthfully can't imagine what he has been through.Nonetheless we find John Merrick witty and engaging and pleasant. Later on Merrick has become the Belle of the Ward and there is a steady stream of dignitaries who come by to visit.  One of the wise old nurses, played by the wonderful Wendy Hillar, gives Treves a piece of her mind and suggests that Merrick has simply become a sideshow again and is being stared at all over again.  This leads to a wonderful scene at home between Treves and his wife, played by Hannah Gordon, in which Treves does some honest soul-searching.  Another scene where Treves has invited Merrick to his own home is remarkable for it's emotional amplitude.  Treves has become very used to being around The Elephant Man, but Mrs. Treves is not, and despite being &quot;prepared&quot; for his sight, there are multiple instances when she is clearly struggling to &quot;seem normal&quot;.There are several other touching scenes, such as when Anne Bancroft,playing a famous London Actress, visits and her acting ability enables her to overlook his deformities more easily than Mrs. Treves, or when Princess Alex arrives at a key hospital board meeting to personally deliver a plea from Queen Victoria for a permanent place for &quot;one of England's least fortunate sons&quot;.  It would have been easy to turn overly sentimental or to pander, but Lynch knows when to reign things in perfectly.This work has much to say about the dignity of man, and I recommend it highly.",5,Recommended for those with a heart and soul,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,3399,"['Elephant', 'Man', 'film', 'incredible', 'passion', 'power', 'who', 'think', 'quot', 'power', 'quot', 'movies', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'mastery', 'martial', 'arts', 'destructive', 'weapons', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'perhaps', 'not', 'you.David', 'Lynch', 'film', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'Victorian', 'feel', 'era', 'depicted', 'also', 'startling', 'chiarascuro', 'visual', 'many', 'scenes.Much', 'information', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Merrick', 'was', 'obtained', 'accounts', 'written', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'who', 'became', 'so', 'celebrated', 'was', 'chosen', 'be', 'Royal', 'Physician', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprising', 'off', 'well', 'film', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Merrick', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Treves', 'are', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'have', 'viewed', 'film', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'are', 'moments', 'am', 'moved', 'single', 'time.The', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'terrible', 'physical', 'deformities', 'are', 'only', 'gradually', 'shown', 'audience', 'discover', 'mental', 'faculties', 'are', 'not', 'hindered', 'scene', 'discovery', 'made', 'absolutely', 'astonishing.The', 'late', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'excellent', 'work', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'Mr.', 'Carr', 'Gomm', 'scene', 'revealed', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'normal', 'intelligence', 'Carr', 'Gomm', 'Treves', 'aside.', 'quot', 'Can', 'IMAGINE', 'what', 'sort', 'life', 'had', 'quot', 'Merrick', 'spent', 'life', 'up', 'point', 'side-show', 'freak', 'beaten', 'jeered', 'absent-mindedly', 'out', 'window', 'starting', 'reply', 'quot', 'Yes', 'think', 'quot', 'Carr', 'Gomm', 'sharply', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quot', 'voice', 'quot', 'one', 'can.', 'quot', 'watching', 'scene', 'TRY', 'imagine', 'myriad', 'humiliations', 'sufferings', 'poor', 'man', 'endured', 'simply', 'unfortunate', 'appearance', 'realize', 'can', 'not', 'quot', 'walk', 'mile', 'shoes', 'quot', 'recognize', 'truthfully', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'been', 'find', 'John', 'Merrick', 'witty', 'engaging', 'pleasant', 'Later', 'Merrick', 'become', 'Belle', 'Ward', 'steady', 'stream', 'dignitaries', 'who', 'come', 'visit', 'One', 'wise', 'old', 'nurses', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Wendy', 'Hillar', 'piece', 'mind', 'Merrick', 'simply', 'become', 'sideshow', 'again', 'being', 'stared', 'over', 'again', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'home', 'Treves', 'wife', 'played', 'Hannah', 'Gordon', 'Treves', 'honest', 'soul-searching', 'scene', 'where', 'invited', 'Merrick', 'own', 'home', 'remarkable', 'emotional', 'amplitude', 'become', 'very', 'used', 'being', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'Mrs.', 'Treves', 'not', 'being', 'quot', 'prepared', 'quot', 'sight', 'are', 'multiple', 'instances', 'when', 'clearly', 'struggling', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'touching', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'playing', 'famous', 'London', 'Actress', 'visits', 'acting', 'ability', 'overlook', 'deformities', 'more', 'easily', 'Mrs.', 'Treves', 'when', 'Princess', 'Alex', 'key', 'hospital', 'board', 'meeting', 'personally', 'deliver', 'plea', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'permanent', 'place', 'quot', 'one', 'England', 'least', 'fortunate', 'sons', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'turn', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'pander', 'Lynch', 'when', 'reign', 'things', 'perfectly.This', 'work', 'much', 'say', 'dignity', 'man', 'recommend', 'highly']",The Elephant Man VHS
210313,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,6300214044,Mat,"[6, 7]","Read all my reviews at [...]David Lynch's second full length film contains the odd assortment of freakish characters we've become accustomed to in his film. Yet, despite one of the more outlandish characters he has ever put on celluloid, it remains his most sentimental.The Elephant Man is based upon the true story of John Merrick, a 19th century Englishman with massive deformities throughout his body. He performed in freakshows for many years until he was found by Dr. Treves who cared for him and placed him in Whitechapel hospital. It is his time in this hospital that the film concerns itself with. For here, Merrick is able to life, more or less, as a gentleman. He is well fed, well kept, and educated. He can read, write, speak eloquently and even begins to entertain well-to-dos of society.It is filmed beautifully in black and white. It is a very well made piece of cinema. Lynch, for the most part, stays away from his trade mark imagery and symbolism, and sticks to more traditional story telling, although the elephant involving opening sequence is straight Lynch nightmare. That the characters come from real life and not Lynch's twisted imagination only serve to add to the surrealism of the film.It has been said that Lynch is too sentimental in this movie. That he manipulates the audience too much. Ebert even goes as far as saying Lynch tricks the audience into believing that Merrick is a noble and courageous man. He suggests, that rather than being noble, Merrick is merely doing the best that he can, under poor circumstances. It is true that the film is sentimental. There is hardly a scene that does not prick the audiences emotions. Yet how can an audience not feel emotion when they see a kind, intelligent man live with such deformities. How many of us would dare to get out of bed each day with similar atrocities. And here, this man, though physically plagued, manages to keep up his spirits and even write and build card sculptures. It would be a poor director at that who could not produce a tear at such a sight. If we pretend it is not a noble feat for such a creature to retain his humanity and good cheer, while being constantly bombarded with inhumane indecencies are we any better than those who stand outside the carnival and jeer?Yet there is something in these critiques of sentimentalism. Lynch continues to use his tricks as a director to keep our eyes wet. There is a scene in which Merrick meets Dr. Treve's wife and breaks down with tears at her simple kind acts. His tears state that no one has been so kind to him as to treat him like a gentleman. Though effective, this is using the craft of filmmaking to do nothing but manipulate emotions. In other films I would lambaste this type of sentimentalism and chastise the audience for falling for it. Yet the overall sadness throughout the story makes me fall for it here. I cannot commend such use of it in film anywhere, and yet it works for me in this particular instance.Overall, the Elephant Man is a fine achievement for a young director. Lynch would go on to make more articulate, less sentimental films. But here we find him assured in his imagery and storytelling. He effectively sweeps the viewer into the emotional turmoil of such a sad, hopeless story.More reveiws at [...]",4,Gloriously Sentimental,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,3283,"['Read', 'reviews', '[', 'David', 'Lynch', 'second', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'odd', 'assortment', 'freakish', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'outlandish', 'characters', 'ever', 'put', 'celluloid', 'most', 'sentimental.The', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'John', 'Merrick', '19th', 'century', 'Englishman', 'massive', 'deformities', 'body', 'performed', 'freakshows', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'found', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'who', 'cared', 'placed', 'Whitechapel', 'hospital', 'time', 'hospital', 'film', 'concerns', 'here', 'Merrick', 'able', 'life', 'more', 'less', 'gentleman', 'well', 'fed', 'well', 'kept', 'educated', 'can', 'read', 'write', 'speak', 'eloquently', 'even', 'entertain', 'well-to-dos', 'society.It', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'black', 'white', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Lynch', 'most', 'part', 'away', 'trade', 'mark', 'imagery', 'symbolism', 'sticks', 'more', 'traditional', 'story', 'telling', 'elephant', 'involving', 'opening', 'sequence', 'straight', 'Lynch', 'nightmare', 'characters', 'come', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'Lynch', 'twisted', 'imagination', 'only', 'add', 'surrealism', 'film.It', 'been', 'said', 'Lynch', 'too', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'audience', 'too', 'much', 'Ebert', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'saying', 'Lynch', 'audience', 'believing', 'Merrick', 'noble', 'courageous', 'man', 'rather', 'being', 'noble', 'Merrick', 'merely', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'poor', 'circumstances', 'true', 'film', 'sentimental', 'hardly', 'scene', 'not', 'prick', 'audiences', 'emotions', 'how', 'can', 'audience', 'not', 'feel', 'emotion', 'when', 'see', 'kind', 'intelligent', 'man', 'live', 'such', 'deformities', 'How', 'many', 'would', 'dare', 'get', 'bed', 'day', 'similar', 'atrocities', 'here', 'man', 'physically', 'plagued', 'keep', 'up', 'spirits', 'even', 'write', 'build', 'card', 'sculptures', 'would', 'be', 'poor', 'director', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'produce', 'tear', 'sight', 'pretend', 'not', 'noble', 'feat', 'creature', 'retain', 'humanity', 'good', 'cheer', 'being', 'constantly', 'bombarded', 'inhumane', 'indecencies', 'are', 'better', 'who', 'stand', 'carnival', 'jeer', 'something', 'critiques', 'sentimentalism', 'Lynch', 'use', 'tricks', 'director', 'keep', 'eyes', 'wet', 'scene', 'Merrick', 'meets', 'Dr.', 'Treve', 'wife', 'breaks', 'down', 'tears', 'simple', 'kind', 'acts', 'tears', 'state', 'one', 'been', 'so', 'kind', 'treat', 'gentleman', 'effective', 'using', 'craft', 'filmmaking', 'do', 'nothing', 'manipulate', 'emotions', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'lambaste', 'type', 'sentimentalism', 'chastise', 'audience', 'falling', 'overall', 'sadness', 'story', 'fall', 'here', 'can', 'not', 'commend', 'such', 'use', 'film', 'anywhere', 'yet', 'particular', 'instance.Overall', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'fine', 'achievement', 'young', 'director', 'Lynch', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'more', 'articulate', 'less', 'sentimental', 'films', 'here', 'find', 'assured', 'imagery', 'storytelling', 'effectively', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'such', 'sad', 'hopeless', 'story.More', 'reveiws', '[', ']']",The Elephant Man VHS

I cry at films, reality TV shows, Neighbours *cough*, sob stories on American Idol, etc. And I've cried so much at a similar film, Mask, that I can no longer watch it. I was actually expecting to dislike this. Everyone seems to rave about it. What's to like?For anyone who has seen this movie, the scene where the doctor (played superbly by Anthony Hopkins) takes John back to his home and introduces him to his wife - that was me. When John starts crying and says he's never been spoken to like that before by a beautiful woman, that was me for the rest of the film. I cried on and off for the rest of the movie. And was still crying when the credits rolled.Elephant Man is based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, who was afflicted with a disfiguring disease. Some of this is similar to Mask, where Rocky (played by Eric Stoltz) is also afflicted by a similar disease. But this was in the 19th century, and little was known about this kind of thing. Because of this, Merrick is subjected to years of misery as the 'Elephant Man' in freak side shows, things that were popular on those days. There are benign tumours which grow all over his body, distorting his head, face and body, which makes him sleep sitting up or will die from suffocation.Most of the movie is set inside the hospital, where we learn Merrick is extremely well educated, and instantly likeable. I'm still not quite sure about the beginning of the movie - where we see Merrick's mother being attacked by an elephant in the fourth month of her pregnancy. It seemed a bit tacked on to the beginning of the movie and didn't really work.There are a few familiar faces in this - fans of UK TV show Hotel Babylon look out for Dexter Fletcher, he's appeared in films too, but that's how I know him. Fans of Anne Of Green Gables (!), look out for Wendy Hiller, playing the main nurse. She was Mrs. Harris in the sequel. There's probably others too, but those are the ones I know.Unfortunately, I really don't see this as the kind of the movie I will ever watch again. It's just too upsetting, although I know people I've spoken to, disagree with that, and watch it over and over. It just had to much of an effect on me.

Merrick was a side show freak call the Elephant Man.  One night he is discovered by Dr. Frederick Treves.  Treves decided to make his pet project.  What Treves did not expect is Merrick's ability to assimilate information.Soon Merrick becomes the toast of British Society but the hospital did not like the publicity.  In a great scene the Queen's sister comes to the hospital and forces the board to accept Merrick as a resident.But Merrick's ""owner"" is not happy about losing his cash cow and kidnaps Merrick and takes him to the continent.  With some help, Merrick escapes back to London.  Though he is a society darling, the common man is not so welcoming.  This leads to the famous ""I am not an animal, I am a man"" scene.In the end, Merrick cannot cope with his dual role in society and just wants to be normal.John Hurt gives a stunning performance as Merrick.  He captures his torment and gives him dimensions under layers of make-up.  Hopkins was not a major star yet but this film shows his future abilities.  Rounding out the cast is Anne Bancroft as the actress who takes an interest in Merrick, John Gielguld as head of the hospital and Wendy Hiller as the head nurse.This film propelled David Lynch into the forefront of the new wave of directors of the 80's.DVD EXTRAS:Making of Featurette - retrospective cast and crew interviews.

First of all, the point is that this film is a black-and-white picture, which is extraordinary. It is probably, because the appearance of John is quite shocking and dreadful. So he is called &iexcl;The Elephant Man&iexcl;. When he has treated cruelly at the circus as he was seeing his body to the audience, he met Dr. Frederick who helped him to escape from his life like a hell. At this point, it is disprovable why Dr. Frederick helped him. He would be able to think John for an experiment. However, he is relieved of curiosity at his first sight and he becomes to be attracted by his humanity. At last, he thinks deeply and truly about the human dignity. In conclusion, this film talks about the human dignity. Although John was physically disabled person who has a gruesome figure, he was warm-hearted and pure man who really loves a literature. However, people are just surprised at his appearance, they would not have a conversation with him. This film is dealing with a pure heart man who has lived his whole life with people&iexcl;s prejudice. Compared with other David Lynch&iexcl;s films, it emphasizes dramatic construction, because it is probably like a biography of John Merrick. In this point, it is a unique film as David Lynch who usually has made a film with a peculiar style and atmosphere such as &iexcl;Eraserhead&iexcl; which is similar to this film in a monochrome film and weird scenes. this is the most gentle film for David Lynch who always has a specific style which makes audience to understand a film very delicately, so it is easy to understand. It is because story takes the central place in this film that it is not so difficult to understand. Excellent directing, and what is more, performance of John Hurt who played in role &iexcl;John Merrick&iexcl;, and Anthony Hopkins who played in role &iexcl;Dr. Frederick&iexcl;, both of them are outstanding.

Oh Lord -- what is the man going to think?! Well, I was stunned when Hurt put his arms around me, hugged me close, and whispered in my ear ""Thank you. That is the greatest compliment I have ever received. But those tears aren't for me - they're for John Merrick.""Needless to say, I found myself going home in an emotionally drained yet exhilarated daze, and could not sleep because of the haunting primal power of Lynch's extraordinary artistry, the unforgettable, heartbreaking score by John Morris (a family friend), the exquisite black and white cinematography by Freddie Francis, the astonishing make-up by Christopher Tucker, and the magnificent performances by the entire ensemble of brilliant actors.Equal parts fable, fairy-tale, and dark, brooding, industrial-revolution nightmare, 'The Elephant Man' is that true rarity - a film filled with compassionate sentiment which somehow manages to be neither maudlin nor cloying: a miracle given the myriad potential traps inherent in the subject matter.Both hellish and heavenly, 'The Elephant Man', along with 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet', 'The Straight Story' and 'Mulholland Drive', is one of Lynch's finest artistic achievements and destined to be a timeless classic.

Because of this eclectic gathering of subject matter, I like some Lynch films more than others.  They range from the mildly entertaining (BLUE VELVET, MULLHOLAND DRIVE, and WILD AT HEART) to the absolutely amazing (STRAIGHT STORY, LOST HIGHWAY... and THE ELEPHANT MAN).I had only seen ELEPHANT MAN on television and it was many years ago.  Since then, I've developed the opinion that LOST HIGHWAY is the best thing Lynch has ever made.  Now, having viewed this excellent DVD of ELEPHANT MAN, I may have to change my tune.  I do believe this film is Lynch's best work.ELEPHANT MAN combines Lynch's quirky art-film attitude with a dramatic and heartwarming drama.  There's the art side - bizarre subject matter, odd editing, and beautiful cinematography - that only certain movie-viewers can appreciate.  But there is also a well-written and brilliantly executed human drama (brought to life by outstanding performances) that almost any viewer will appreciate.The DVD contains an excellent, gorgeous transfer and encoding of the movie.

His condition, neurofibromatosis is progressive and is characterized by the growth of hard, fibrous nodules over portions of the epidermis.  They may later spread into underlying structures and interfere with other bodily processes, hindering breathing, speaking, hearing and motility of the effected parts.  It is usually not a symetrical abberation, adding to its grotesqueness, and causing imbalance.  Of course if it appears on the face it becomes quite disfiguring and startling to observers caught off guard.  In Victorian England, where John was exploited and knowledge of medicine was not in its present state, a mystery and apprehension surrounded it.  This horrible life he had to live, being feared, gawked at, examined were unbearable, but throughout the horror of his life, he was able to remain a pure and beautiful soul.  The acting by John Hurt (Merrick) is phenomonal, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as the doctor who finally provides a kind of friendship with him, and offers him some hope of having a beneficial life, if only for the sake of science.

His life as a sideshow freak was actually something he entered into voluntarily, as what he considered the only way he could stay out of the Poor House.  He was abandoned in France by the man who acted as his Barker when the show was shut down, and he did make the harrowing journey back to England much as is depicted in the film, but the mistreatment that he suffers in the movie I have to assume is meant as a composite sort of license taking, as he did spend his childhood in a dormitory for homeless boys, where it is assumed he suffered incredibly, as he would never speak of that time to anyone.

210339,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6300214044,RMurray847,"[80, 84]","As I sit down to write this review, my experiences with it from my youth came flooding back. I first saw it as a 17 year old high-schooler at my local movie theater, late one evening. I had seen, and enjoyed, the Broadway play a few months earlier, and wanted to see how the movie compared. The play, I should say, was very moving and had a certain spareness in its production design that was very effective. I had left the theatre with a moist eye and an interest in learning more about John Merrick, The Elephant Man (who had neurofibromatosis, NOT elephantitis, as is so often attributed to him).Anyway, when the movie concluded, the ENTIRE audience of 150 or so sat in its seats, numbed and unmoving. It was one of those experiences where you fight back your tears, because you're worried if you let go, you'll start bawling like a baby! The film was so profoundly moving to me and so artistically brilliant, that I went again the very next day, dragging reluctant friends with me. They were all stunned. I watched it AGAIN later that week.I've watched it on video a couple of times years ago, but until I rewatched it recently on DVD, it had been nearly 10 years since I'd seen it.The story is set in the early turn-of-the-twentieth-century London. John Merrick (John Hurt) is, for lack of a better word, enslaved as a sideshow freak.  He has the most hideous growths on his bones, which give him a frightening appearance.  His  head is probably three times bigger than a normal human, and the shape resembles a lumpy dirigible.  His limbs are mostly tangled messes.  Noted physician Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins) hears of this ""elephant man"" and is fascinated so greatly by his condition that he brings him to his hospital for study.  Everyone has always assumed this man must be a mute ""idiot.""  Turns out that Merrick is a gentle, thoughtful and almost unbearably forgiving soul.  The relationship that emerges between Treves and Merrick, as well as with Merrick and virtually everyone he encounters, is at the heart of this film.(Note of caution: The movie does not follow John Merrick's life terribly accurately...neither did the play. When I read the biography of Merrick that his doctor, Treves, wrote, I got his ""true"" story, which is just as moving in its own way.)David Lynch, we all know, is a ""difficult"" director, at least when it comes to narrative continuity. This movie, however, is his most accessible (along with THE STRAIGHT STORY, which doesn't even feel like a Lynch movie). It tells a straightforward story...no dancing dwarfs, no little people behind radiators, no Wizard of Oz references, etc. etc. No Laura Palmer. However, the touches he brings to it are pure Lynch, and they serve the movie profoundly.For example, the movie takes place in the midst of the early Industrial Revolution, when science was becoming more ""popular"" or ""glorified"" by the masses. It was also a time when London was awash in factories, and all the noise and pollution they wrought. If you've seen ERASERHEAD or DUNE, you know that Lynch likes to have lots of background noises of machinery. Often, those sounds are distracting. In ELEPHANT MAN, we are constantly aware, through these sounds, that we are in a very specific time and place, where the lifeblood of society was machinery, but big, dirty, unsubtle, dangerous machinery. This, coupled with the glorious black and white cinematography, truly create a mood that is unequaled.Also, there are some brief dream sequences in which Merrick sees his mother. She flits in and out of his dreams in a manner only Lynch can evoke. No one has ever been better at capturing on film the elusive nature of dreaming...that dreams are a crazy combination of good things and bad things happening all at once. These dreams are not a ""device"" but a window into Merrick's soul.Those of us who remember when the film first came out remember the constant rehashing of the ""I am not an animal, I am a human being, I am a MAN!!"" line that Merrick yells out when cornered in a train station. This howl of despair is one of the most gripping moments EVER put to film. I tear-up just thinking about it.The makeup is incredible. Having seen photos of the real Merrick, I can state that the makeup crew got it right! And the black and white helps to mask any imperfections. And underneath the makeup......is John Hurt, a fabulous actor in the role of his lifetime. He brings a delicacy and gentleness to the part that has to bee seen to be believed. I guarantee you'll be moved.Hurt is ably assisted by Anthony Hopkins in a role which calls for restraint, and he delivers, which is unusual for Hopkins, who can overact at the drop of a hat...I love him, but sometimes he can overdo it, you must admit.  The rest of the cast is full of familiar British character actors, as well as a brief but incandescent appearance by Anne Bancroft.  Everyone is at their very best.Initially, the film snags the viewer because of our fascination at seeing a human being so horrifically monstrous.  It holds a lurid fascination that fades into compassion and empathy.  If a person as horribly mistreated by his fellow man, as well as by fate, can find beauty, forgiveness, tenderness and love flowing from him and to him...well, the film leaves you to draw your own personal conclusions.I know that Lynch receives more ongoing accolades for his disturbing BLUE VELVET, and of course, for the groundbreaking TWIN PEAKS...but THE ELEPHANT MAN is the one I'm always drawn back to.I simply cannot recommend this film highly enough. Moviemaking doesn't get any more heartbreaking and effective than this masterpiece.",5,A MASTERPIECE...pure and simple!,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,5632,"['sit', 'down', 'write', 'review',

Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye.

210341,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6300214044,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 3]","""The Elephant Man"" is simply one of the very best movies ever made. It was made by a diverse and unexpected group of people including executive producer Mel Brooks and uber-strange director David Lynch (Eraserhead) and stars the brilliant Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt in their best film appearances ever.The film follows the story of John Merrick (Hurt) in early twentieth century London. Merrick had been born with multiple serious deformities, and had been exploited as a sideshow attraction in a circus when he was discovered by the dedicated Doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins,) who sought to help him and learn from him, despite much official and unofficial prejudice and dissuasion.The film focuses on human dignity and the ability of the human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and ignorant prejudice and hatred from fellow human beings. I am amazed at the interactions between Hopkins and Hurt onscreen: surely this is among the best acting in any production ever. Although the movie takes certain liberties with Merrick's life story, the film still stands as a testament to both these men and what they stood for, and, more importantly, to the capability for good, love, and compassion that mankind possesses. The film has many other excellent performances from preeminent actors and actresses (John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, etc.) but Hurt and Hopkins are the two that make this film the piece of genius that it is.I rarely prefer black and white as a directorial choice, but in this case, the film is enhanced immeasurably by the moodiness it creates. The cinematography, direction, sets, and score are all equally breathtaking, and if you are like most people you won't move an inch for the mesmerizing duration of the film.The DVD comes with numerous extras, including interviews, and ""making of"" segments. Certainly this was a labor of love for all involved, especially John Hurt, who had to be made up in the most difficult and time consuming manner imaginable. Their efforts were not in vain, though, as the result is one of the most important films of all time, and certainly one of the best. I absolutely could not recommend a film more highly than this one, and as I sit here, I can't think of a single one that I think is actually better than ""The Elephant Man.""

210344,A6FIAB28IS79,6300214044,Samuel Chell,"[4, 4]","Ignore any of the criticism you may have heard of this film--that it employs voyeuristic exploitation, that it's overly sentimental, that it represents an early, less-advanced stage in the career of a brilliant filmmaker, David Lynch.  The simple truth of the matter is that anyone might have great difficulty naming a single film made since 1980 that represents so complete a mastery of the medium.Despite much received wisdom proclaiming that film is limited to the external surfaces of reality, Lynch employs camera work, editing, and sound to conduct us deep into the innermost consciousness of John Merrick (the historic &quot;elephant man&quot;).  That which produces revulsion at the initial recording of its grotesque, nauseating features (this is no moderately attractive human specimen such as the one  in &quot;Mask&quot;) ultimately evokes sympathy, understanding, and love of the inextinguishable human spirit itself.Lynch organizes the film around 3 challenging montage sequences--the opening one presents the birth of Merrick into a world of uncertainty and contradictions; the second takes us into the world of Merrick's living hell, with industrial smoke replacing the white clouds of the opening sequence; the 3rd is accomplished through a panning of the camera that seamlessly unites physical and metaphysical orders in its presentation of Merrick's sleep, thus resolving the conflicts in the first 2 sequences.The film has minimal dialogue and only a fragmentary musical score, yet it represents one of the most imaginative, at once disturbing and intriguing, uses of sound in the history of cinema.  Perhaps only a well-produced DVD can fully disclose the &quot;sound of silence&quot; that characterizes both Merrick's inner and outer worlds, yet the subtle changes in audio ambience, together with the subliminal &quot;pounding&quot; that frequently reminds us of a dehumanized world, should be unmistakable even on VHS and low-fidelity equipment.Finally, the acting is in perfect harmony with the filmmaker's purposes.  No individual &quot;sticks out.&quot;  Heard's simple yet sympathetic Merrick, Anthony Hopkins' beautifully understated Dr. Treves, the supporting roles of Gielgud, Bancroft, and Wendy Hiller--all contribute to a sum so much greater than its parts as to defy description.  To say that this is one of the most underrated films ever made may be the biggest understatement one could ever make.",5,Transcendent Cinema!,978825600,"01 7, 2001",2001,2433,"['Ignore', 'criticism', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'voyeuristic', 'exploitation', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'early', 'less-advanced', 'stage', 'career', 'brilliant', 'filmmaker', 'David', 'Lynch', 'simple', 'truth', 'matter', 'anyone', 'might', 'have', 'great', 'difficulty', 'naming', 'single', 'film', 'made', '1980', 'so', 'complete', 'mastery', 'medium.Despite', 'much', 'received', 'wisdom', 'proclaiming', 'film', 'limited', 'external', 'surfaces', 'reality', 'Lynch', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'sound', 'conduct', 'deep', 'innermost', 'consciousness', 'John', 'Merrick', 'historic', 'quot', 'elephant', 'man', 'quot', 'revulsion', 'initial', 'recording', 'grotesque', 'nauseating', 'features', 'moderately', 'attractive', 'human', 'specimen', 'such', 'one', 'quot', 'Mask', 'quot', 'ultimately', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'love', 'inextinguishable', 'human', 'spirit', 'itself.Lynch', 'film', '3', 'challenging', 'montage', 'sequences', 'opening', 'one', 'birth', 'Merrick', 'world', 'uncertainty', 'contradictions', 'second', 'world', 'Merrick', 'living', 'hell', 'industrial', 'smoke', 'replacing', 'white', 'clouds', 'opening', 'sequence', '3rd', 'accomplished', 'panning', 'camera', 'seamlessly', 'physical', 'metaphysical', 'orders', 'presentation', 'Merrick', 'sleep', 'thus', 'resolving', 'conflicts', 'first', '2', 'sequences.The', 'film', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'only', 'fragmentary', 'musical', 'score', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'once', 'disturbing', 'intriguing', 'uses', 'sound', 'history', 'cinema', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'well-produced', 'DVD', 'can', 'fully', 'disclose', 'quot', 'sound', 'silence', 'quot', 'Merrick', 'inner', 'outer', 'worlds', 'yet', 'subtle', 'changes', 'audio', 'ambience', 'together', 'subliminal', 'quot', 'pounding', 'quot', 'frequently', 'dehumanized', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'unmistakable', 'even', 'VHS', 'low-fidelity', 'equipment.Finally', 'acting', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'filmmaker', 'purposes', 'No', 'individual', 'quot', 'sticks', 'out.', 'quot', 'Heard', 'simple', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'Merrick', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Gielgud', 'Bancroft', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'contribute', 'sum', 'so', 'much', 'greater', 'parts', 'defy', 'description', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'understatement', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'make']",The Elephant Man VHS

210346,AFAN848Y1O7A3,6300214044,Scott Prazak,"[0, 0]","Based on the true life of Joseph Carey Merrick (portrayed brilliantly by John Hurt), David Lynch's masterpiece more or less accurately portrays his experiences only in the last year of his life in 1889-90 once Doctor Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) encounters him and cares for him at Whitechapel Hospital. Because of the stage play which left Merrick's physical appearance to the viewer's imagination, this film tended to be voted inferior in comparison. Being fair though, this is a very good film and an unforgettable one at that.In arguably David Lynch's most conventional shoot, there are a couple of misleading events. The film explains Merrick's condition as the result of his mother being struck down by an elephant. He was actually born a normal child. Before the age of two, he had began growing the tumors, and his condition rapidly worsened. Believed to have Proteus Syndrome or ""Elephant Man's Disease"" which causes abnormal, unchecked growth of bones, skin, and other systems, the name came to be identified with him. Also, not revealed in the film are what happened to his parents. Research revealed that his mother, also handicapped died when Merrick was 11. His father remarried, and his new wife gave gave him an ultimatum, ""Joseph, or me."" Abandoned and cast out of the home, he went to live at the Leicester Union Workhouse, and sold shoe polish on the street. After being taunted repeatedly by other children, he had to find other work.Desperate for medical attention, a compassionate showman, Tom Norman, UK's answer to P.T. Barnum took him in and gave Merrick a job as a museum freak. Under Norman's tutelage, Merrick accumulated 200 pounds, a large sum of money at the time. However, while touring Belgium, Merrick became separated from his guardian. Naive and sickly, he was a perfect target for robbers, and an unscrupulous Austrian (some say Italian) showman tricked him out of his small fortune. This more than likely was the character portrayed by Freddie Jones in the film.Although those facts were not mentioned in the film, this is nevertheless very accurate. Merrick's association with the upper class, the journey to the theater, his befriending of a famous stage actress, his creativity, and intelligence, and even Merrick's death in the film was portrayed to the tee, based on the earlier reports of Dr. Treves.The DVD has nice documentaries on the making of the film, interviews with the actors, director, and Mel Brooks (who interestingly was the executive producer), and the trailer as features.

John Hurt gives a outstanding performance as John Merrick, the poor disfigured and deformed man whom they called the elephant man. Anthony Hopkins gives us a great performance in this movie also. With great makeup effects and a great cast and touching story, this film will always remain a film that I think no one can forget. It is truly sad, especially because this is a true story. Your  heart goes out to Merrick for having to live the life he was given. He truly had a kind heart but was constantly taunted and picked at and even used as a freak at a side show. Yet he was a very smart man. This film shows how cruel some people can be to someone who is ""different"". What they failed to do is see the true man behind the deformities. ""  I am not an animal, I'm a man"". Well said Merrick. Unfortunately Merrick died in his late twenties. His one dream was to be able to lay down in bed and sleep  like a ""normal"" person. Something we all take forgranted sometimes. Merrick had to sleep sitting up b/c of his condition.

His portrail of John Merrick was a great moment in Cinematic History.  Robert De Niro gained a bunch of pounds for the part and was loud and obnoxious and did a great job of it for saying ""F**K"" but for pure emotional acting ability John Hurt beat De Niro hands down.

I was about 20 at the time and was probably watching it to see how grotesque the main character appeared. Now, some 30 years later, David Lynch has become one of my favorite directors and I am able to appreciate movies on a different level.The Elephant Man is not a typical David Lynch film. You can clearly see his style all over it (such as his fascination with machinery), but the story is not as complex and difficult as later efforts; this is grounded in reality. John Merrick (Hurt) existed in Victorian England, although he was really called Joseph Merrick. A cast of his head exists and is on display in a museum with his curved spine. It took up to six hours in makeup to transform Hurt into Merrick, but the result was as authentic as possible.Shot in black and white on a low budget in around 14 weeks, the film was made thanks to the backing of Mel Brooks. He hadn't heard of David Lynch, but backed him after seeing a screening of Eraserhead.The most surprising thing about The Elephant Man is how human the character is. Although his outward appearance frightened many people, he is portrayed as a gentle and eloquent man. Imagine being displayed in carnivals as a freak for the first 20 years of your life. He is punished if he doesn't ""perform"" and is treated like an annoying animal. Would you be afraid to speak or show your intelligence in such a situation? I know I would.Merrick is discovered by Frederick Treves (Hopkins), who is a surgeon in a London hospital. His initial motivation is to display Merrick to his fellow colleagues to further his career, but he soon realizes that Merrick is a human being. One of the most interesting things about the film is how society reacts to Merrick once he has the backing of a few well-known people. Unfortunately, there are still those who wish to profit from his appearance.The Elephant Man is one of the most emotional stories I have ever seen. I'm so glad that my tastes evolved to the point where I could see it the way it was intended. It's heartbreaking in places and you could make the argument that it's Lynch's best film (although I wouldn't agree). The cast delivers perfect performances across the board. You'll see performances from John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, Michael Elphick and Hannah Gordon.Lynch was relatively unknown in 1980, but he produced a film that was widely admired. Although it was poorly marketed, it received eight Oscar nominations.

This gentle and tragic tale is free of the mind-numbing eccentricity typical of his later works - and is all the better for it.Englishman John Merrick (John Hurt) suffers from the debilitating and crippling disease known as Proteus Syndrome.  He is condemned to life as a sideshow freak because of his tumors and physical abnormalities.  Merrick's destiny then changes when he is discovered by Doctor Fredrick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and taken to a hospital in London.  While there, he is shown compassion and begins to realize that it might indeed be possible to live out the rest of his life with dignity.The story of ""The Elephant Man"" is told in the most straightforward manner possible.  Lynch here demonstrates that when working within a traditional framework, he can make as good a film as anyone.  Helping him out are Hurt and Hopkins who are great in their respective roles and the spectacular production design which recreates 19th century London in excruciating detail.  ""The Elephant Man"" is a film that is first and foremost about the humanity that exists in every person.  It reminds us that despite all of the obstacles life can throw at a person, that special spark that gives people the drive to seek out a better existence can never be truly extinguished.",4,"""Hello . . . my name is . . .

210358,AV5G37VFE5NVD,6300214044,Tom Benton,"[9, 10]","David Lynch is quite possibly the most underappreciated director in cinematic history.  Time and time again he has crafted baffling, fascinatingly intricate works of art that time and time again have been shunned by critics too small-minded to appreciate the beauty of Lynch's films.  Still, there is one that was universally acknowledged as the masterwork it is: THE ELEPHANT MAN, Lynch's finest work.  In 1979, impressed by Lynch's horrifying debut ERASERHEAD, Mel Brooks hired Lynch to direct a cinematic telling of the tale of Joseph Merrick, frequently mistakenly referred to as ""John"", a mistake repeated in this film.  With only one prior film under his belt, David Lynch crafted a masterpiece that ranks among the very finest films ever made, as well as the single most moving thing I have ever seen.Anthony Hopkins portrays Dr. Frederick Treves, a young and ambitious surgeon at the London Hospital who hears talk of a hideously deformed man being showcased at a local freakshow as ""The Elephant Man"".  Recognizing a potential subject for fascinating research, Treves takes the man from his horridly-abusive ""business partner"" (Freddie Jones) and places him the London Hospital.  Though the hospital staff is, naturally, initially opposed to the idea (do we not fear what we do not understand?), they gradually warm to the ""Elephant Man"" when Treves discovers, to everyone's immense shock, that the man is in fact a very intelligent and polite 21-year-old Englishman named John Merrick (John Hurt).  Treves and Merrick become close friends while Treves studies Merrick's terrible disease, but though the public comes to see Merrick as a sort of hero, there are still those all too willing to treat him as a freak.THE ELEPHANT MAN is one of the few cinematic masterpieces with a story as captivating as the film itself.  The story is very historially accurate, as is the makeup for John Merrick.  No doubt this is a major reason of why THE ELEPHANT MAN is so profoundly tragic a film - it all happened.  It's all real.  Angry mobs did chase that poor, kind soul, and sleazy, utterly despicable rats of men did exploit his misfortune for their own profit.  He was abused, and ridiculed, and yet through it all he remained upbeat, and a heartbreakingly intelligent and polite young man.  Though his face is hidden beneath layer upon layer of makeup, John Hurt's performance as Merrick is excellent, and though ""wonderful"" would be a fitting adjective, it just doesn't seem right for this circumstance.Anthony Hopkins delivers what may the finest performance of his career, possibly surpassed only by his legendary performance as Hannibal Lecter in Demme's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  His character is admirably set on doing what's right and touchingly and sincerely caring for Mr. Merrick.  In the scene in which Hopkins first encounters Merrick in a basement, he looks absolutely heartbroken and sheds one single, streaming tear; this may very well be one of the greatest scenes in movie history.Heading up the supporting cast is Anne Bancroft, playing a beautiful actress who immediately befriends Merrick.  A testament to the movie's power is that we feel like we know these characters, particularly Bancroft.  We do not root for her character; we appreciate and are grateful for her kind attitude toward Mr. Merrick.As wonderful as the actors are, this film could simply not exist without the masterful directing of David Lynch.  Though this is one of his more linear works, it is still distinctly Lynchian, from the surreal opening sequence to the marvelously poetic finish.  Those who were bold enough to endure ERASERHEAD may notice that THE ELEPHANT MAN feels like a sort of companion piece to that film.  Both films were shot in a sort of nightmarish black-and-white, both films feature an enhanced soundtrack highlighting the sound of the wind whisping and mechanical clunks in the background, and both films highlight industrial settings and workers.  Lynch's attention to every single detail, no matter how seemingly unimportant or simple, his appreciation for every little thing in life, is a perfect fit for this film.  Though he may have made films more fascinating or deep, David Lynch never made one finer than THE ELEPHANT MAN, his own gothic, romantic tragedy.Another aspect that will remain in viewers' minds well after the film's end is Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"", one of the most provoking and sorrowfully beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard, which was similarly used six years later in Oliver Stone's PLATOON.  ""Adagio"" is the song that plays through the film's final moments, and it is the ultimate opus for John Merrick.  I guarantee that after seeing this film, your eyes will tear whenever ""Adagio for Strings"" is played.Though it will always be one of film's great tragedies that David Lynch never receives the praise he so rightly deserves, it is fitting that at least one of his films, Lynch's own handmade tragedy, received the attention it deserved.  Although the film was (unsurprisingly) unrecognized in the 1981 Academy Awards, THE ELEPHANT MAN has come to be regarded as one of the finest films ever made.  It is indeed one of the all-time great cinematic masterpieces, and Lynch's masterwork.

Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and cowriter of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film, Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a gothic vein.

210360,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6300214044,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 5]","David Lynch isn't known for making tender, emotional-moving films about compassion, dignity, and the importance of life.  Lynch is better known for making films seeped in a bizarre Salvador Dali-type surrealism full of violence and sex.  Mel Brooks isn't known for producing high class, ground breaking dramas that are nominated for Academy Awards.  The idea of putting these two filmmakers working together on a serious movie seems almost absurd.  But it happened and the collaboration between the two, THE ELEPHANT MAN, turned out one of the most powerful, elegant, and moving pictures of the 1980s.I was probably in kindergarten or first grade the first time I saw THE ELEPHANT MAN.  I cried when watching the film and thought that because of the ending it was very sad.  I also thought that the film was a really old film because it was filmed in black and white.  It wasn't until I recently watched the film again that I discovered the movie isn't all that old and was released in 1980.  After watching it again, I also found that it wasn't as sad, either, because the John Merrick died with dignity and not a creature cast off from the world.THE ELEPHANT MAN is about the life of Joseph Merrick (though his name has been changed to John in the film), a horribly disfigured man (he suffered from probably both Neuro Fibromatosis and Proteus Syndrome) who grew up in freak shows and carnivals until he was discovered and rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) one of the chief physicians at the Royal London Hospital.  At first the attendants and other employees at the hospital treat John (John Hurt) with horror and disgust, but as Treves works with him and uncovers the human being beneath the physical deformity the staff come to love John as a member of their own family.  Soon John becomes a London celebrity and is visited by the elite and powerful of society and becomes a favored acquaintance of the Queen herself.  But there are those in Merrick's past who are envious of his success and hate him for it--they do not view him as a man, but only as a freak to make a profit from.  It is a message that Merrick has had beaten into him most of his life and he must come to grips with it and realize himself that he is a man regardless of the shape or color of his skin.John Hurt is uncanny as John Merrick.  He played the man at a time when it most actors in Hollywood were afraid of playing any role in which their face could not be seen.  Also, at a time when most actors couldn't imagine sitting longer than half and hour in a make up chair, Hurt endured a twelve hour make-up session each day to be physically transformed into Merrick.  It was the incredible makeup in this film that led to the creation of a Best Makeup Oscar in 1982.  Even today's era when nearly half of all special effects and makeup are created through CGI, Christopher Tucker's makeup job is most impressive.  Of course, none of it wouldn't have mattered if Hurt hadn't been beneath.  Hurt gave the portrayal of Merrick his soul.  He should have won an Oscar, but didn't.Anthony Hopkins delivers one of his most touching film roles as Dr. Treves, the man who ""saved"" the Elephant Man only to find himself being ""saved"" by the man he rescued from destitution.  Hopkins has played numerous memorable roles since THE ELEPHANT MAN, but his role as Dr. Frederick Treves remains as one of my favorite Hopkin's performances.  Other notables in the cast include Sir John Gielgud as Carr Gomm, Treves supervisor and Anne Bancroft as the lovely actress Mrs. Kendal.There are no cheesy lines are maudlin moments in THE ELEPHANT.  Part of that is because the film's writers based the script upon the real Dr. Treves' writings about Joseph Merrick.  Imaginary characters were created and certain situations were slightly fudged for dramatic effect, but overall the film's script is on the money.  Not a line or moment is wasted.Some of that might have been because the movie was filmed in stock black and white film, an incredibly expensive process at the time.  Studio execs questioned the idea at the time, knowing that it would be cheaper to shoot in color and then delete the color from the film, but Lynch and Brooks were adamant on shooting in black and white and in the end the investment was the right choice.  The black and white movie that made me think it was an ""old movie"" when I was a child gives the film a certain amount of style and charm that even most period pieces lack nowadays.As for David Lynch, since the time of THE ELEPHANT MAN he has gone on to direct and create a host of bizarre and strange projects from BLUE VELVET to TWIN PEAKS.  Lynch has a very unique style of filmmaking and much of it transcends the border of normalcy into the realm of perverted surrealism.  Not everyone can appreciate Lynch.  There are tiny moments of this surrealism in THE ELEPHANT MAN, such as the scenes with the elephants and the lady writhing on the ground.  However, THE ELEPHANT MAN is Lynch's most commercially viable film.  It is a movie that appeals to people of all ages, whether they are a child of five or an elder of eighty.  Cinematically speaking, it's even more because even though Lynch has gone on to set new boundaries and try experimental things, THE ELEPHANT MAN is his magnum opus.  It's a movie that I think everyone should see at least once in their life.The DVD includes the theatrical trailer, a retrospective with some of the cast and crew (mainly Hurt and Brooks), an interview with make-up artist Christopher Tucker, and a narrated photo gallery with Christopher Tucker.",5,Defining Human Dignity.,1160092800,"10 6, 2006",2006,5593,"['David', 'Lynch', ""n't"", 'known',

Its such a wonderul role that I literally had to cry. Anothony Hopkins, as the man who be-friended and helped John Hurt gives a subtle, yet perfect performance. You can tell he really cared. Filmed entirely in an almost grainy black and white, you would never know this is a somewhat modern film unless you were familiar with the actors. But don't let that deter you.

David Lynch seems to be better known now for Eraserhead and Blue Velvet...his macabre, unsettling masterpieces dealing with our darker psyches. That's unfortunate, because The Elephant Man deals with those same dark underbellies, morbid curiosities and human cruelties, while offering glimpses of compassion, empathy and redemption his other films seem to lack. Using stark black and white cinematography, he conjures up the gritty and gruesome realities of Weegee's New York City photography to depict London's industrial revolution of the late 19th century. Gaslight, horse dung in streets, walls stained with industrial filth and a cast of characters ranging from the completely depraved to social elite, are all woven together in a rich tapestry wrapped around the tragic life of John Merrick. Not a single frame of film is wasted nor is the exceptionally well crafted storyline and acting talents of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft and, what this viewer believes to be one of the finest film performances of the late 20th century, John Hurt. I showed this film to my art history students recently and was surprized to find that only one student had even heard of it! It's hard to believe that this is one is already 33 years old and that it may only show up occasionally on Turner Classic Movies or to hear myself saying, &#34;They don't make em' like this one anymore&#34;!

Aside from that, it is one of the best films ever. You are a true MONSTER if this film does not move you to tears. This one reaches DEEP into one's heart, and asks - demands, really - you to empathize with another's person's tortured soul. THIS is Anthony Hopkins finest performance EVER. When you watch a film as emotionally involving, you come away feeling grateful to be healthy, lucky even. This is a true testament to the psychology of cruelty, how ingrained it is. From the night watchman to the kids in the train station: man's unkindness, disrespect, and cruelty to one another is something people will always have to struggle against.

210368,AOADUBGSCS7H9,6300214044,"""zazz4""","[4, 4]","The Elephant Man is a movie so emotionally draining you only watch it something like once in five years, if that.  On top of brilliant filmmkaing, you know the story is also true. Anthony Hopkins is top billed as a doctor who discovers John Merrick, a man so horribly disfigured by disease he is nearly unrecognisable as a human, and called The Elephant Man.  Hopkins delivers an excellent performance. John Hurt plays Mr. Merrick.  He isn't recognisable, as he's under layers of makeup that make him The Elephant Man(ive seen a picture of Merrick, and the movie has Mr. Hurt looking just like him) but I don't know if anyone else could've played the role as well.  Very moving. David Lynch(director) tacles his first full length picture with this amazing movie.  His last short, Eraserhead, got him the job.  There just arent enough stories like that of John Merrick, so I don't know that Lynch can get so close to his calling again, though he does a damn good job anyway(Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Wild At Heart, Strait Story, Lost Highway).
