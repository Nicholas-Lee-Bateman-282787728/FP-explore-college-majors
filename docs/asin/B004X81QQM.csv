They are all released by universal Studios! They only care about quantity, but not quality... I am very disappointed by the poor quality packaging of Six million Dollar man Season 4 as well.  Stacked DVD's is very poor.  Thank heavens I will not be buying anymore universal Studio's DVD's TV Series after the Six million Dollar Man & Bionic Woman 3 movies come out.  IF they come out.Okay, back to the review... in this season, we get to see classic episodes such as:Big Foot V, Return Of Death Probe part 1 & 2... These are the very reason why I bothered purchasing this set.  When they divided up the characters to never appear on either show during the last Seasons of each show, and why? Because they said no bionic woman on six million dollar man season 5 and no six million dollar man on bionic woman season 3.  The shows were even on two different networks, another reason the show got cancelled.I enjoyed the death probe part 1 and 2 from Season 4 better than return of death probe part 1 and 2 on season 5 even if they added two spinning blades and a different and possibly more deadly probe.  Ken Johnson has a talent for quality TV programming such as the Six Million Dollar Man & bionic Woman And The Incredible hulk.  I own all of these.  I think he also Did V the series, the older series to which I own those too.I originally gave this set two stars, but I have a workable set now which I gave it a mercy 3 stars which is more than universal studios deserves since they don't deliver quality.",3,"Five Stars for the series, but 3 stars for Universal Studios poor quality",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1634,"['have', 'had', 'issues', 'Six', 'million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'A-Team', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'buck', 'Rogers', '25th', 'Century', 'guess', 'What', 'are', 'released', 'universal', 'Studios', 'only', 'care', 'quantity', 'not', 'quality', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'poor', 'quality', 'packaging', 'Six', 'million', 'Dollar', 'man', 'Season', '4', 'as', 'well', 'Stacked', 'DVD', 'very', 'poor', 'Thank', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'anymore', 'universal', 'Studio', 'DVD', 'TV', 'Series', 'Six', 'million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Bionic', 'Woman', '3', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'come', 'out.Okay', 'back', 'review', 'season', 'get', 'see', 'classic', 'episodes', 'such', 'Big', 'Foot', 'V', 'Return', 'Death', 'Probe', 'part', '1', '2', 'are', 'very', 'reason', 'why', 'bothered', 'purchasing', 'set', 'When', 'divided', 'up', 'characters', 'never', 'appear', 'show', 'last', 'Seasons', 'show', 'why', 'said', 'bionic', 'woman', 'six', 'million', 'dollar', 'man', 'season', '5', 'six', 'million', 'dollar', 'man', 'bionic', 'woman', 'season', '3', 'shows', 'were', 'even', 'two', 'different', 'networks', 'reason', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled.I', 'enjoyed', 'death', 'probe', 'part', '1', '2', 'Season', '4', 'better', 'return', 'death', 'probe', 'part', '1', '2', 'season', '5', 'even', 'added', 'two', 'spinning', 'blades', 'different', 'possibly', 'more', 'deadly', 'probe', 'Ken', 'Johnson', 'talent', 'quality', 'TV', 'programming', 'such', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'bionic', 'Woman', 'Incredible', 'hulk', 'own', 'think', 'also', 'Did', 'V', 'series', 'older', 'series', 'own', 'too.I', 'originally', 'gave', 'set', 'two', 'stars', 'have', 'workable', 'set', 'now', 'gave', 'mercy', '3', 'stars', 'more', 'universal', 'studios', 'deserves', 'do', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'quality']",N/A
1431535,A1YOYEB5K3XFTU,B004X81QQM,"MovieLover ""movieloversyd""","[1, 1]","First off, I'm so HAPPY to 'finally' now have all five seasons of one of the most popular and entertaining t.v. shows from the 1970's. In fact, ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" was not only one of my all-time favorite shows as a kid, but continues to be so all these years later. So on to season 5: Steve's appearance is a bit different this time out. Gone is the cheesy 1970's mustache from season four, while his hair is somewhat longer and his clothes a bit classier. He actually looks more like ""The Fall Guy"" in this season than the Steve Austin character - Ha! O.K., so overall, the writing in season 5 may not be quite as strong or original as in previous seasons, but ........ that doesn't mean that these episodes aren't just as much fun to watch. In particular I love that Steve's old rival / buddy ""Big Foot"" makes a return appearance. Even better (at least for me) is the fact that neither the alien beings nor the Bionic Woman are involved this time. It's just Steve and the Sasquatch.Season 5 also includes no less than five 2-part episodes, including a particular favorite titled ""Dark Side of the Moon."" In case any of us forgot that Steve Austin was a top notch astronaut, the NASA theme is present in that 2-parter, as well as in a few of the other episodes from this season. My absolute favorite episode though ~ and one that I wish had been a 2-parter ~ deals with a paranormal / psychic theme (Dead Ringer). Oh, and those familiar with Lee's ""Big Valley"" days will recognize a couple of actors from that series who make guest star appearances. Gone this time around is Farrah Fawcett-Majors (who made an appearance in each of the previous four seasons), as well as Steve Austin's gold bracelet (a gift from Farrah). We do see a lot more of Rudy Wells, but unfortunately somewhat less of Oscar Goldman. Of course long time fans of the series know that Richard Anderson was splitting his acting duties between two bionic shows at the same time. Uh, this might very well be one of the reasons why I wasn't a fan of The Bionic Woman. I loved the Oscar Goldman character and particularly enjoyed the Six Million Dollar Man episodes which featured Steve and Oscar working on a case 'together.' So if I could have changed something about season 5, it would have been more screen time for Oscar !!!!O.K., so on the other side of the coin: There are no bonus items / special features included, which I must admit was somewhat disappointing. It would have been wonderful to have included an interview with Lee Majors and Richard Anderson. It would have been extraordinary if they had been able to include outtakes or behind-the-scenes footage, etc. None of the 5 seasons featured any such interview, unfortunately. I also get the feeling that those involved with the series didn't know that season 5 would be their last (?). Sometimes when a series is coming to an end the cast and crew do something special for the final episode. Instead, we're kind of left hanging ... as there was nothing particularly special or significant about the final episode.If you were a fan of the series back in the day, or if if you're just becoming a fan now ..... you simply MUST add season 5 to your collection. It's doubtful that I'll ever grow tired of watching this series. In fact, it's the type of show that can certainly be passed down from generation to generation .... as some parents have proven by introducing their own kids to one of the greatest t.v. heroes of the 1970's.",5,So HAPPY to finally complete my collection with season 5 !!!!,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,3475,"['First', ""'m"", 'so', 'HAPPY', ""'finally"", 'now', 'have', 'five', 'seasons', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'entertaining', 't.v', 'shows', '1970', 'fact', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'shows', 'kid', 'be', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'So', 'season', '5', 'Steve', 'appearance', 'bit', 'different', 'time', 'out', 'Gone', 'cheesy', '1970', 'mustache', 'season', 'four', 'hair', 'somewhat', 'longer', 'clothes', 'bit', 'classier', 'actually', 'more', 'Fall', 'Guy', 'season', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'character', 'Ha', 'O.K.', 'so', 'overall', 'writing', 'season', '5', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'strong', 'original', 'previous', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'mean', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'particular', 'love', 'Steve', 'old', 'rival', '/', 'buddy', 'Big', 'Foot', 'return', 'appearance', 'Even', 'better', 'least', 'fact', 'alien', 'beings', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'are', 'involved', 'time', 'just', 'Steve', 'Sasquatch.Season', '5', 'also', 'less', 'five', '2-part', 'episodes', 'including', 'particular', 'favorite', 'titled', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Moon', 'case', 'forgot', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'astronaut', 'NASA', 'theme', 'present', '2-parter', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'other', 'episodes', 'season', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'episode', '~', 'one', 'wish', 'had', 'been', '2-parter', '~', 'deals', 'paranormal', '/', 'psychic', 'theme', 'Dead', 'Ringer', 'Oh', 'familiar', 'Lee', 'Big', 'Valley', 'days', 'will', 'recognize', 'couple', 'actors', 'series', 'who', 'make', 'guest', 'star', 'appearances', 'Gone', 'time', 'around', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett-Majors', 'who', 'made', 'appearance', 'previous', 'four', 'seasons', 'as', 'well', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'gold', 'bracelet', 'gift', 'Farrah', 'do', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'Rudy', 'Wells', 'unfortunately', 'somewhat', 'less', 'Oscar', 'Goldman', 'course', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'series', 'know', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'was', 'splitting', 'acting', 'duties', 'two', 'bionic', 'shows', 'same', 'time', 'Uh', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'loved', 'Oscar', 'Goldman', 'character', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'featured', 'Steve', 'Oscar', 'working', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'changed', 'something', 'season', '5', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Oscar', 'O.K.', 'so', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'are', 'bonus', 'items', '/', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'have', 'included', 'interview', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinary', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'include', 'outtakes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'etc', 'None', '5', 'seasons', 'featured', 'such', 'interview', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'get', 'feeling', 'involved', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'season', '5', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'series', 'coming', 'end', 'cast', 'crew', 'do', 'something', 'special', 'final', 'episode', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'kind', 'left', 'hanging', 'was', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'significant', 'final', 'episode.If', 'were', 'fan', 'series', 'back', 'day', ""'re"", 'just', 'becoming', 'fan', 'now', '..', 'simply', 'MUST', 'add', 'season', '5', 'collection', 'doubtful', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'grow', 'tired', 'watching', 'series', 'fact', 'type', 'show', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'passed', 'generation', 'generation', 'parents', 'have', 'proven', 'introducing', 'own', 'kids', 'one', 'greatest', 't.v', 'heroes', '1970']",N/A
