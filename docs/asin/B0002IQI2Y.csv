Always one to be low key, and an artist who would rather play in a small blues club on the local street corner, Boz Scaggs after his massive success with ""Silk Degrees"", maintained a low profile, and to this day seems to be in semi-retirement.  This his first live dvd is an absolute grand slam.  The sound and picture quality is phenominal, and the performance makes us all remember, that the Boz man has always been one of rocks most under appreciated artists.  Most of the hits are here, like ""Lowdown"", ""Georgia"", ""Lido"", We're All Alone"", ""Look What You've Done T0o Me"" and ""Slow Dancer"".  However, we get treated to some blue eyed soul blues with ""Ask Me 'Bout Nothin' But The Blues"" and of course his classic Steve Miller era tune ""Loan Me A Dime"", which is simply astounding.  Boz Scaggs won't fill up arena's anymore, but this dvd proves, that classic rockers who now play the club and small theater circuit, still have what it takes to make great music.

However for my money the two most outstanding tracks are ""Ask Me 'Bout Nothin' But The Blues"" and the legendary ""Loan Me A Dime"" featuring a fantastic guitar interplay between Boz and Drew Zingg. The remaining musicians, Jim Cox and Michael Bluestein on keyboards, Matt Bissonette-bass, John Ferraro-drums, Rich Armstrong-trumpet and percussion, Charles McNeal-saxophones and flute and Ms. Mone't and Barbara Wilson-backing vocals turn in first rate performances throughout.Topping everything off is the fact that the show is shot in high definition video and audio with the mix in stereo as well as 5.1 surround showcasing Boz in the absolute best possible light.

I liked what I saw and heard there and so ordered this without hesitation.I won't go over the technical aspects or the names of all the musicians, other reviewers have already done that. What I will say is that on first viewing I was floored! Greatest Hits Live is simply spectacular.Unlike some of the reviewers who kind of leave the impression that they think Scaggs' career began with Top 40 radio hits (i.e. Lowdown), I think that his best work both preceded and followed his radio-friendly or ""disco"" period. Most of the songs here are from that period, but most of the best of the DVD is from the periods I mentioned. Not many remember that Scaggs got AM radio play on a couple of songs from Moments and a couple of others before Lowdown lifted him from a cult figure to an international star.If you are one of those who dislike Scaggs' period of mass popularity, put those feelings aside and give this DVD a chance. Scaggs proves himself not only to be one of the coolest, most urbane and sophisticated balladeers in the business, but also a master of blue-eyed soul and a wicked guitarist in the bargain.  And his entire band is first-rate.My favorites here include: a dazzling rendition of Lowdown that opens the concert and sets a high standard for musicianship here; the late period horn-driven blues of It All Went Down The Drain; the haunting romance of Harbor Lights; the plaintive Ask Me 'Bout Nothin' But the Blues; the rousing Georgia; and We're All Alone, the stellar romantic ballad that closes the show. But the best is saved for last and should blow you away the way it did the audience.Lido Shuffle seemed to energize an already rapturous crowd and set the stage for the two best songs of the set in which Scaggs and his band cut loose and showed what they are really capable of. I own a lot of excellent concert DVDs, but I can't think of a point on any of them where I am glued to the screen in awe at the musicianship as I am when I am watching and listening to Runnin' Blues and Loan Me A Dime. The keyboard wizardry on both songs is a wonder to behold and the guitar on Loan Me A Dime has you forgetting all about Duane Allman for the moment. Those two songs alone are worth the price of the DVD.Don't miss the extras either. I really enjoy the second, jazzier version of Harbor Lights as much as the one in the concert.Obviously, this review is a strong recommendation. So get your own copy as soon as possible. If you are even a lukewarm Boz Scaggs fan, this DVD will make you listen to and appreciate him in a new way. It sure did the trick for me!",5,Simply Spectacular,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,3247,"['Boz', 'Scaggs', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'pleased', 'read', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'Boz', 'Scaggs-Greatest', 'Hits', 'Live', 'Unamimity', 'praise', 'not', 'something', 'one', 'usually', 'when', 'reading', 'reviews', 'something', 'so', 'frequently', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'feel', 'compelled', 'point', 'out', 'books/CDs/DVDs', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'date', 'have', 'generated', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'first', 'time', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'only', 'all', 'positive', 'reason', 'five', 'star', 'Mr', 'Scaggs', 'take', 'bow', 'own', 'most', 'Boz', 'Scaggs', 'work', 'one', 'form', 'never', 'gave', 'DVD', 'thought', 'stumbled', 'samples', 'work', 'featured', 'CD/DVD', 'set', 'Fade', 'Into', 'Light', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'heard', 'so', 'ordered', 'hesitation.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'technical', 'aspects', 'names', 'musicians', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'floored', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'Live', 'simply', 'spectacular.Unlike', 'reviewers', 'who', 'kind', 'leave', 'impression', 'think', 'Scaggs', 'career', 'began', 'Top', '40', 'radio', 'hits', 'i.e', 'Lowdown', 'think', 'best', 'work', 'preceded', 'followed', 'radio-friendly', 'disco', 'period', 'Most', 'songs', 'here', 'are', 'period', 'most', 'best', 'DVD', 'periods', 'mentioned', 'Not', 'many', 'remember', 'Scaggs', 'got', 'AM', 'radio', 'play', 'couple', 'songs', 'Moments', 'couple', 'others', 'Lowdown', 'lifted', 'cult', 'figure', 'international', 'star.If', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'dislike', 'Scaggs', 'period', 'mass', 'popularity', 'put', 'feelings', 'aside', 'give', 'DVD', 'chance', 'Scaggs', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'coolest', 'most', 'urbane', 'sophisticated', 'balladeers', 'business', 'also', 'master', 'blue-eyed', 'soul', 'wicked', 'guitarist', 'bargain', 'entire', 'band', 'first-rate.My', 'favorites', 'here', 'include', 'dazzling', 'rendition', 'Lowdown', 'concert', 'high', 'standard', 'musicianship', 'here', 'late', 'period', 'horn-driven', 'blues', 'Went', 'Drain', 'haunting', 'romance', 'Harbor', 'Lights', 'plaintive', 'Ask', 'Me', 'Nothin', 'Blues', 'rousing', 'Georgia', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'stellar', 'romantic', 'ballad', 'show', 'best', 'saved', 'last', 'should', 'blow', 'away', 'way', 'did', 'audience.Lido', 'Shuffle', 'seemed', 'energize', 'already', 'rapturous', 'crowd', 'set', 'stage', 'two', 'best', 'songs', 'set', 'Scaggs', 'band', 'cut', 'loose', 'showed', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'capable', 'own', 'lot', 'excellent', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'point', 'where', 'am', 'glued', 'screen', 'awe', 'musicianship', 'am', 'when', 'am', 'watching', 'listening', 'Runnin', 'Blues', 'Loan', 'Me', 'A', 'Dime', 'keyboard', 'wizardry', 'songs', 'wonder', 'behold', 'guitar', 'Loan', 'Me', 'A', 'Dime', 'forgetting', 'Duane', 'Allman', 'moment', 'two', 'songs', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'extras', 'either', 'really', 'enjoy', 'second', 'jazzier', 'version', 'Harbor', 'Lights', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'concert.Obviously', 'review', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'get', 'own', 'copy', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'are', 'even', 'lukewarm', 'Boz', 'Scaggs', 'fan', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'listen', 'appreciate', 'new', 'way', 'sure', 'did', 'trick']",N/A

I remember a really funny picture of him on the back of Steve's ""Sailor"" album I remember he wrote Steve's songs Overdrive, Dime-A-Dance Romance and co-wrote some others (My Friend, Going to Mexico). Since going solo he did some incredible albums which even more incredibly are not currently available on CD (how is this possible???) such as Boz & Band, My Time and Moments. His vocals on these are so hauntingly beautiful. He really hit with Silk Degrees, I guess. Anyway, I was amazed that his performance on this DVD was so good as to be possibly the best BOZ I have ever heard and that is saying something monumental. I was so impressed by his singing voice and delivery - it is not that he has not aged - he has aged like wine or scotch - his ""aged"" improvement is all richness and quality and depth and it amazes me. I am resolved to see him live even if I have to go to his bar in LA or whatever. The funny thing about this DVD is that my favorite song is one I had never heard before - ""Heart of Mine"". Whoever wrote that song knew Boz's strengths and soul and crafted a song perfect for the man. It's easy to know if you will like this DVD. Listen (and watch) the first cut - Lowdown. If you aren't immedialtely hooked, you never will be. Thanks to Boz for this DVD - I really did not think Harbor Lights could be performed more hauntingly than it is on the CD and I was wrong.

Obviously, on a CD-DVD titled ""Greatest Hits"", you are expected to hear just that, his greatest hits. You do hear and see several of his greatest songs, but why is the albumSome Changecompletely ignored ? Again, a selection is just that, taking in some and letting others out but I would have kept at least ""sierra"" instead of ""I just go"", or ""lend me a dime"", or even the ultra heard ""we're all alone"", also performed by Rita Coolidge if I remember well. ""Heart of mine"" is generally a crowd favourite, but to me Bobby Caldwell performs it much better than Boz, so that's one I systematically skip. Too much softness kills me.- The musicians are great for this type of gig, although I knew none of them before seeing this dvd. But, like it or not, you can't replace Lukather on guitars or Jeff Porcaro on drums, especially on ""Lowdown"", ""Jojo"", or ""Breakdown dead ahead"". Yes, I am a romantic. And a dreamer. But those two positions should have been better filled...Of the two, the drummer is the weakest link. The overall impression is that of a middle of the road musician, well in line, not too spectacular or flashy. Too discrete in my opinion.- The stage. Much too small. With everyone performing, you have ten people on approximately 12 by 20 feet. How they managed not to run into each other or kick anybody of the set is a miracle... The drummer is locked in behind a plexiglass, the two key-piano players are sharing their sweat dripping from their back, the guitar player hardly has any space to move his hips.Now to the goodies !- The guy ! Boz is a class act. Educated, respectful, considerate. Thin (almost slim) when so many singers put on those extra kilos at that age, he is also in great vocal shape. Sure, he doesn't have that enigmatic women idol look he had in the late seventies, but he is like top of the line wine. Bonified with time.- The sound quality. Top of the line. Little to no junk sounds, no static, no weaknesses. All the instruments sound great when they need to. Chapeau to the sound engineers !- The picture quality. Like other reviewers said, no MTV nonsense with stupid shots. We see the crowd when we need to, but just enough. We see the musicians when we need to. And the colours are splendid. I saw this one on a Pioneer plasma 52 inches. Ooooh lala.....Don't think we need a blu ray version. Also, remember this thing is from 2004.- The general atmosphere, with a no nonsense attitude. You have no body guards between the stage and the musicians, and if there is any type of security, it's not visible. No hurdles or barriers between the stage and the public. The first row of seats is just 2 meters (six feet) away from Boz. Now that is intimate...- Lowdown, Miss Sun, Lido Shuffle, Georgia, Breakdown dead ahead, Jojo. Sierra (see above), Simone, Some Change and maybe Hard times are missing though.- The stage... well, yes. Too small, but at the same time more human than most of the stages I have seen. I saw Boz in concert in Madrid several years ago, and even got to talk a little to him after the concert (also excellent by the way). I asked him if he would ever get together with the musicians from TOTO for another album. He was very clear : NO. I think he just prefers the cozy, intimate settings. His latest discography confirms that. And so does this concert.In short, you will see and hear the Boz of this century, even when playing songs from the seventies and eighties. This means a bluesier touch to the songs (at times it even comes to be borderline with country, as a friend of mine pointed out). Here, you have almost two hours of concert.As always, enjoy the music, and the filming in this case !",4,Intimate Boz,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,3922,"['will', 'be', 'odd', 'one', 'long', 'serie', 'extremely', 'positive', 'reviews', 'where', 'everyone', 'five', 'five.First', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'totally', 'satisfied', 'collection.-', 'Having', 'most', 'what', 'Boz', 'Scaggs', 'released', 'are', 'things', 'like', 'more', 'others', 'Obviously', 'CD-DVD', 'titled', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'are', 'expected', 'hear', 'just', 'greatest', 'hits', 'do', 'hear', 'see', 'several', 'greatest', 'songs', 'why', 'albumSome', 'Changecompletely', 'ignored', 'Again', 'selection', 'just', 'taking', 'letting', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'least', 'sierra', 'instead', 'just', 'go', 'lend', 'dime', 'even', 'ultra', 'heard', ""'re"", 'alone', 'also', 'performed', 'Rita', 'Coolidge', 'remember', 'well', 'Heart', 'mine', 'generally', 'crowd', 'favourite', 'Bobby', 'Caldwell', 'much', 'better', 'Boz', 'one', 'systematically', 'skip', 'Too', 'much', 'softness', 'me.-', 'musicians', 'are', 'great', 'type', 'gig', 'knew', 'none', 'seeing', 'dvd', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'replace', 'Lukather', 'guitars', 'Jeff', 'Porcaro', 'drums', 'especially', 'Lowdown', 'Jojo', 'Breakdown', 'dead', 'ahead', 'Yes', 'am', 'romantic', 'dreamer', 'two', 'positions', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'filled', 'two', 'drummer', 'weakest', 'link', 'overall', 'impression', 'middle', 'road', 'musician', 'well', 'line', 'not', 'too', 'spectacular', 'flashy', 'Too', 'discrete', 'opinion.-', 'stage', 'Much', 'too', 'small', 'everyone', 'performing', 'have', 'ten', 'people', 'approximately', '12', '20', 'feet', 'How', 'managed', 'not', 'run', 'other', 'kick', 'anybody', 'set', 'miracle', 'drummer', 'locked', 'plexiglass', 'two', 'key-piano', 'players', 'are', 'sharing', 'sweat', 'dripping', 'back', 'guitar', 'player', 'hardly', 'space', 'move', 'hips.Now', 'goodies', 'guy', 'Boz', 'class', 'act', 'Educated', 'respectful', 'considerate', 'Thin', 'almost', 'slim', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'singers', 'put', 'extra', 'kilos', 'age', 'also', 'great', 'vocal', 'shape', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'have', 'enigmatic', 'women', 'idol', 'look', 'had', 'late', 'seventies', 'top', 'line', 'wine', 'Bonified', 'time.-', 'sound', 'quality', 'Top', 'line', 'Little', 'junk', 'static', 'weaknesses', 'instruments', 'sound', 'great', 'when', 'need', 'Chapeau', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'MTV', 'nonsense', 'stupid', 'shots', 'see', 'crowd', 'when', 'need', 'just', 'enough', 'see', 'musicians', 'when', 'need', 'colours', 'are', 'splendid', 'saw', 'one', 'Pioneer', 'plasma', '52', 'inches', 'Ooooh', 'lala', '..Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'Also', 'remember', 'thing', '2004.-', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'nonsense', 'attitude', 'have', 'body', 'guards', 'stage', 'musicians', 'type', 'security', 'not', 'visible', 'hurdles', 'barriers', 'stage', 'public', 'first', 'row', 'seats', 'just', '2', 'meters', 'six', 'feet', 'away', 'Boz', 'Now', 'intimate', 'Lowdown', 'Miss', 'Sun', 'Lido', 'Shuffle', 'Georgia', 'Breakdown', 'dead', 'ahead', 'Jojo', 'Sierra', 'see', 'Simone', 'Change', 'maybe', 'Hard', 'times', 'are', 'missing', 'though.-', 'stage', 'well', 'yes', 'Too', 'small', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'human', 'most', 'stages', 'have', 'seen', 'saw', 'Boz', 'concert', 'Madrid', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'even', 'got', 'talk', 'little', 'concert', 'also', 'excellent', 'way', 'asked', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'together', 'musicians', 'TOTO', 'album', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'think', 'just', 'cozy', 'intimate', 'settings', 'latest', 'discography', 'so', 'concert.In', 'short', 'will', 'see', 'hear', 'Boz', 'century', 'even', 'when', 'playing', 'songs', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'bluesier', 'touch', 'songs', 'times', 'even', 'be', 'borderline', 'country', 'friend', 'mine', 'pointed', 'out', 'Here', 'have', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'concert.As', 'always', 'enjoy', 'music', 'filming', 'case']",N/A

The video quality is superb.  I DVR'd it in hi-def and 5.1 off of HDNet and the viseo was only slightly better than the DVD if using progressive scan and the sound wasn't as good as the DVD (in DTS).  The sound quality is top notch, offering a DTS track (better than Dolby as uses less compression).  There are a lot of blues songs on here that is a mixed bag for me but nearly all of his hits are here.  Stays pretty close to the original versions except for Lido.
