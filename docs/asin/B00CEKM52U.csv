It is exactly what sometimes we feel like doing as individuals but because of fear we do not go out and make a change; we stay in our comfort zone.

1646228,A30EH53Y32NUTT,B00CEKM52U,"Doctor Whom ""The Doctor""","[8, 9]","So glad I bought this disc, especially if the Amazon Thought Police have censored it as too blatantly sexual, making it unavailable now.  No movie in my experience has so completely and realistically integrated frank sexuality into a plot; every other film I have ever seen suddenly seems dishonest and coy.  Not only is sexuality a character, but this must be the first time that the erect male organ has had more than a cameo or a walk-on role in a legit picture.  I mean, violence is a character in mainstream cinema, but until, now sex has just been an understudy.  That is sex, has been understudied.The sexuality is between the characters however, and is not aimed to titillate the audience; nobody's body is idealized or shaven, porn-style. These are just people trying to love each other and understand themselves, or vice versa.Every actor plays a character with his/her own name.  What does that mean?  The actors appear in an audition reel -- they do not seem to be the same people they are playing. Main character is Jesse Metzger, who seems like a nice Jewish boy -- although the hostile voice of his father on the phone ain't no jewish Dad.  Jesse is leaving behind the welcoming gay SF scene he has lived in for 10 years, and returning home back east .  Like American Graffiti, the film takes place on the last night of youth.  Jesse is leaving (we think) because he realizes he has been avoiding himself; sex is comfort food that he has outgrown.  But, what awaits him at home?  I hope there will be a sequel, but i bet there won't be.It must be noted that a porn house produced this movie -- so this is less a regular filmmaker going into the netherworld than a porn studio taking what it has learned about sex and turning that into a work of art.  PLUS, it must be noted that the ubiquitous James Franco has entered a project with the director, Travis Matthews.  I've always been a Franco fan, but my respect for him went up when i read about this.",5,Sex is a supporting character in this movie,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1966,"['So', 'glad', 'bought', 'disc', 'especially', 'Amazon', 'Thought', 'Police', 'have', 'censored', 'too', 'blatantly', 'sexual', 'making', 'unavailable', 'now', 'movie', 'experience', 'so', 'completely', 'realistically', 'integrated', 'frank', 'sexuality', 'plot', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'suddenly', 'dishonest', 'coy', 'Not', 'only', 'sexuality', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'erect', 'male', 'organ', 'had', 'more', 'cameo', 'walk-on', 'role', 'legit', 'picture', 'mean', 'violence', 'character', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'now', 'sex', 'just', 'been', 'understudy', 'sex', 'been', 'understudied.The', 'sexuality', 'characters', 'however', 'not', 'aimed', 'titillate', 'audience', 'nobody', 'body', 'idealized', 'shaven', 'porn-style', 'are', 'just', 'people', 'trying', 'love', 'other', 'understand', 'vice', 'versa.Every', 'actor', 'character', 'his/her', 'own', 'name', 'What', 'mean', 'actors', 'appear', 'audition', 'reel', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'people', 'are', 'playing', 'Main', 'character', 'Jesse', 'Metzger', 'who', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'hostile', 'voice', 'father', 'phone', 'ai', ""n't"", 'jewish', 'Dad', 'Jesse', 'leaving', 'welcoming', 'gay', 'SF', 'scene', 'lived', '10', 'years', 'returning', 'home', 'back', 'east', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'film', 'place', 'last', 'night', 'youth', 'Jesse', 'leaving', 'think', 'been', 'avoiding', 'sex', 'comfort', 'food', 'outgrown', 'what', 'home', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'i', 'bet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be.It', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'porn', 'house', 'produced', 'movie', 'so', 'less', 'regular', 'filmmaker', 'going', 'netherworld', 'porn', 'studio', 'taking', 'what', 'learned', 'sex', 'turning', 'work', 'art', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'ubiquitous', 'James', 'Franco', 'entered', 'project', 'director', 'Travis', 'Matthews', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'Franco', 'fan', 'respect', 'went', 'up', 'when', 'i', 'read']",N/A

It's not a common deliberate, directorial decision.  Personally, I do not consider it pornography, but am aware that the characters in this film are unlike those who simluate sex in other films. It is a gay film about gay men and clearly, made for a gay male audience.So, if you are sexually squeamish, pass on it.
