He gets caught up in booze, tobacco and drug-addled intrigue in the form of financial shenanigans at his new newspaper, a shady real estate developer (and his intriguing lady friend...and see if you can guess whose bed she ends up with before movie's end), and lingering tensions between the natives and non-natives.At one point in the movie, Kemp comes within two feet of driving himself and the girlfriend off the end of the road and into the ocean after a high speed run in the real estate developer's Corvette.

1510068,AAZRWLML88IZK,B0064OUGK0,A kids review,"[13, 16]","In 2011, 13 years after first portraying a Hunter S. Thompson doppelganger in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Johnny Depp took on two roles that referenced the controversial writer: one by way of an animated chameleon that took its cues from Fear and Loathing's Raoul Duke, and the other by way of an adaptation of Thompson's semi-autobiographical debut novel, The Rum Diary. While the former was considered a success, the latter, unfortunately, split critics in much the same way that Fear and Loathing did. The Rum Diary follows journalist Paul Kemp as he travels to Puerto Rico to write for a local paper. While there, Paul is tasked with writing a favorable story about an American entrepreneur intent on exploiting the island for commercial gain, and Paul must contemplate the murky moral nature of the piece. I felt that Depp was as committed to the role as ever, and that the film was colorful and amiable enough, but I was also a bit put off by the rambling source material, which made for an unfocused narrative.

1510069,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0064OUGK0,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 3]","Okay, here is the plot line of the film under review, the adaptation of the late Hunter S.  Thompson's legendary (more later on that) The Rum Diary, straight out of the gate. A young aspiring American writer, of the male persuasion, Paul Kemp, played by Thompson pal Johnny Depp, seeks employment in the newspaper business down in then backwater colonial Puerto Rico in the late cold war red scare early 1960s. Said writer, working to win his spurs and to make a name for himself tries six ways to Sunday to upgrade himself as a professional and the newspaper as well (based on a real the San Juan Star of the time). Oh, and chase a few windmills to right some of the egregious wrongs of this world as the young are prone to do (the major wrong confronting him being  double-triple rip-out of the place by hungry, very hungry real estate developers).  Problems encountered in chasing those windmills: said budding journalist is a bit of a drunk, a bit too close to some ex-pat fellow journalists who gravitated to PR just to be flaky in peace, and a bit too close (but one cannot blame him on this one) to one very hot blonde who happens to be slumming in Puerto Rico just then. But, trust me, one Paul Kemp will straighten that whole thing out, or have us go mad trying.Sound familiar? Well, for any Hunter Thompson aficionado, and count me as one, hell, any half- aficionado, this plot line is very, very much like the life, the early life of one Hunter S. Thompson. And how would we know?Well we have read the letters, we have read the Rolling Stone articles, hell we have read Songs of the Doomed and got a taste for snippets of The Rum Diary there. So when viewing this film there was a certain disappointment  (just a little) that this did not turn out to be the great film adaptation of  Hunter Thompson's stab at the great American novel.And here is where the ""more later"" mentioned above on The Rum Diary comes in. Hunter Thompson, seemingly, spend endless hours as far back as the early 1970s (maybe earlier )trying get this novel published (and in publishable form), and into film form. But here is a case where life (his, his later life anyway) outdid fiction. The ambience of the film seems very dated, very dated indeed in the post-Doctor Gonzo age. For what it is worth this is my ""skinny"" on Thompson's career. He was one of the premier journalists of the last half of the twentieth century but as a novelist he was well behind his heroes Fitzgerald and Hemingway. As for Johnny Depp's performance, well, Johnny Depp knows, knows deep in his bones, how to play off-the wall characters and does a better job, a much better job, here than in his attempt at channeling Hunter Thompson in the film adaptation of  Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.

1510071,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0064OUGK0,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 2]","A big commercial flop, this intelligent comedy was dismissed by the critics and ignored by the public, and yet I must say that I quite enjoyed it. It is based on a novel of the same name by the late journalist Hunter Thompson. Johhny Depp stars as Paul Kemp, an alter ego of  Thompson (Depp had already played a character based on Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).Set in 1960, as the movie begins we see Kemp arriving in Puerto Rico in an alcoholic haze. After an interview with Lotterman, its editor, Kemp gets a job in an English language newspaper there that has seen better days. Kemp becomes pal with two other alcoholic reporters in the paper, the crazy Moberg and the cynical Sala. These three are soon living together in a decrepit house in San Juan and are involved in a series of humorous adventures. The closest thing this movie has to a regular plot is when Kemp is contacted by Sanderson, an enigmatic businessman (Aaron Eckhart, who is great). Sanderson introduces Kemp to various businessmen and politicians and wants to recruit him to write a puff job in the paper so that an island that serves as practice range for the military would be available for the construction of hotels. Sanderson has a very pretty girlfriend, Chenault (Amber Heard), who soon tries to seduce Kemp. Kemp eventually wants to write about the various corrupt plots he learns in the newspaper, but he is vetted the very cynical Lotterman, who doesn't want to rock the place, and instead thinks the newspaper should do soft pieces.I'm not telling anything more about the movie, but it makes for a pretty entertaining film. It's intriguing to me that this film was not well received, perhaps for some it has too broad a style for a comedy, given the subject matter.

Kemp is an alcoholic newspaper writer and gets a job in Puerto Rico because no other paper would hire him on account of his drinking. Depp plays the role of the major lush and does a credible job of it but mainly he seems to have dusted off the character he playes in Fear and Loathing. The book I recalled was quite a bit morose than the movie makes of the whole experience and has an upbeat, devil may care joie de vivre. Chenault is a beautiful maven that is the girlfriend of Sanderson, a speculator that wants to hire Depp for some writing gigs. In the book she is swept away from Carnivale and ends up raped by the denizens at the club. The movie just leaves Kemp separated from her and they reunite at the end and she goes back home: a much gentler conclusion to the romance. The movie illustrates the plight of Puerto Ricans when rich Americans want to take over everywhere.

1510083,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0064OUGK0,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","The Rum Diary was hugely anticipated on my part for quite some time now. As a fairly big fan of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, I was more than a little excited to see Johnny Depp jump into the shoes of Hunter S. Thompson once again. But there were a few snags along the way. For one, the film has been sitting on the shelf for over a year. We also didn't have any sort of trailer, TV spot, or even production images until a few months ago. We had a summary and a rather impressive looking cast to fall back on. Part of me knew this wouldn't be quite as gonzo or extreme as Fear and Loathing, but an even bigger part of me really wanted it to be. In the end, it just wasn't meant to be and The Rum Diary is just barely on the better side of decent.Hunter S. Thompson took on several different personas over the years in his writing. Regarding the film adaptations of his works, Raoul Duke, who Depp portrayed in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the man Paul Kemp, who Depp portrays in The Rum Diary, eventually becomes. So it's kind of obvious from the start that The Rum Diary won't be as erratic as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In 1960, Paul Kemp goes to Puerto Rico to write for The San Juan Star and meets Bob Salas (Michael Rispoli) the newspaper photographer and Edward J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) the editor. In addition to Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), who has pretty much drank away the majority of his life. While Kemp struggles to write a story Lotterman is happy with, he begins to pal around with Bob and eventually runs into Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a man who knows how to make money on an island that doesn't seem to have any. Kemp gets into a few business discussions with Sanderson and falls in love with Sanderson's girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard). Writing becomes the least of Kemp's problems as he struggles with an overbearing alcohol addiction, a domineering urge for lust, and the unfathomable ways he finds himself getting in over his head in nearly every situation.I feel like Johnny Depp has lost whatever it was that made him interesting years ago since I haven't particularly cared for one of his live-action films in years. Blinded by pirates and consistently working with a particular gothic director from Burbank, California, Depp has been stumbling around in mediocre territory for quite some time now. I was hoping he'd at least show shades of his performance in Fear and Loathing and I suppose he did. Paul Kemp was a man who's much more together than Raoul Duke was though. His mind isn't quite as polluted with mind-altering substances as Duke's was. Depp is obviously tapping into the same character and seems to do what he can with the role, but it isn't really a noteworthy performance. Giovanni Ribisi felt like he stood out much more, but that was more than likely the purpose. Moberg is the most interesting and laugh-out-loud character of the film. He's so far gone that a simple intoxicated hand gesture or head movement speaks volumes of his character. While The Rum Diary attempts to be its own film, the eyedropper scene is probably the closest you'll get to Fear and Loathing nostalgia.Unfortunately, the movie felt like it didn't really find its footing until its second half. Upon seeing Fear and Loathing, Thompson was quoted as saying that the film would have been nothing more than ""a series of wild scenes"" without Depp's narration. That's one of The Rum Diary's biggest problems. While we do hear the inner thoughts of Kemp while he's writing or while staring into a lobster tank, The Rum Diary feels like a hackneyed series of crazy events strung together. It could best be described as quirky or semi-eccentric up until the cock fights begin, but it feels rather ho-hum in its execution. Bob Salas looks, sounds, and acts like a watered down version of Dr. Gonzo. There are all of these wild and bizarre occurrences happening around every turn and about two dozen memorable one-liners being spewed like wildfire, but no performance really sticks out above the rest and you seem to be just along for the ride rather than being sucked into it. The Rum Diary almost comes off like a watered down version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The Rum Diary is full of Johnny Depp breathing fire, voodoo, countless laws being broken, hangovers, riots, alcohol, and chicken, but it's all wrapped up in really dull packaging. There's some good writing in there; some that spoke to me as a writer. Its mundane line delivery is nearly forgotten about in its second half where things pick up and are borderline hilarious, but everything good going for the movie is forgotten about in its extremely disappointing ending. Considering all of its flaws, issues, and miscues, the logical side of me is wishing The Rum Diary would have stayed on the shelf.",2,Leaves you wanting more gonzo behavior,1319932800,"10 30,

Fabric, aspirin bottles, and on up.  Very much can put you in the mind of how it was in the early 60's.  Beautiful scenery is a given with it being filmed in Puerto Rico.I think people forget how unstructured life was then.  Not everyone had phones even in the US, much less the island where the movie takes place.  It is a contrast of the newer businessman, who wishes to structure everything to his benefit, versus how simply unstructured most things were.  The main character, Mr. Kemp (Johnny Depp and he is fabulous) sees this.  Sees the untruth in the vision capitalists are wishing to  produce for their profit.  I mean why do you think the early part focused on bowling alleys and fat US tourists?  Who would come to a tropical island with all the ways your senses can be engaged, to stick to 'safe' bowling alleys?  Is was and is simply ridiculous.The girlfriend of the guy wishing to build the hotel and make money, Ms. Heard, is a vision of how young vital people simply cannot exist within it.  The scenes at the carnival are terribly important to the dichotomy of the film.  A dichotomy Mr. Kemp is forever embroiled with, stuck in, nailed to ""hanging in the middle"".  Circumstances prevent him from going to the left, and needs pull him (against his will) to the right.  To help the developer who believes ""76% of blacks are controlled from Moscow"".  How can such a wealthy influential man, with such messed up ideas be who he is?  Something is fundamentally wrong there.Now the movie could have been great, and it wasn't.  It loses its way somewhere, here and there.  Too many distractions of no consequence.  Too many scenes that seem as if they could be cut to no detriment.  Yet doing so would have left an hour long movie.  Still a refreshing alternative to your FX driven action fest of no point whatsoever.

All I can say, it was better than I expected, but still not a movie I ever would have bought or watched if not for Johnny Depp being in it.""The Rum Diary"" left me with the same feeling that ""Fear and Loathing"" did...hardly a shock, since they both revolve around the same author.  Once again, we are treated to a cynical and drunken (or high) (or both) view of the world, where most things turn out to be pointless.  However, the saving grace of this movie were the spectacular landscapes and the wonderful vintage cars and the beautiful actress who played Chenault, the love interest of the film.  The music was also really good.Kemp is a big time drinker with a checkered writing career (if you could call being a failed novelist a career) who goes to Puerto Rico to work for an ailing newspaper.  He hooks up with Sala, a photographer for the same paper and ends up rooming with him and his even stranger other roommate who also (sort of) works for the same paper.  He's probably the most oddly intriguing character in the show, though of course you never figure out how he got that way.What follows is a drunken (or high) ramble through all sorts of misadventures that are sometimes funny and sometimes not, with an occasional nod at a plot revolving around a secret real estate deal.  The gap between the rich who are exploiting the island and the poor is brought up a few times, but nothing really seems to come of it.  Just when you think something might get accomplished, that Kemp is going to take a stand or do SOMETHING other than get in and out of trouble and find the next high...it doesn't.  A lot of the plot seemed pointless.Again, this reminded me of ""Fear and Loathing,"" where if it wasn't Johnny Depp playing him, with all of his charm, I would so dislike the guy that I probably wouldn't have even finished watching the movie.  Which isn't to say that I hated the movie entirely, but I don't understand this fascination for pointless, essentially plotless writing.Warning, there is a lot of drug use in the movie (though it does show you what stupid things you can do and get into as a result) and if you would be squicked or offended by chicken-fighting scenes, then you might not want to watch it.",3,Pretty But a Bit Pointless,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2365,"['Now', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'HUGE', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'disappointed', 'was', 'thrilled', 'discover', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'still', 'not', 'movie', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'watched', 'not', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'being', 'Rum', 'Diary', 'left', 'same', 'feeling', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'did', 'hardly', 'shock', 'revolve', 'same', 'author', 'Once', 'again', 'are', 'treated', 'cynical', 'drunken', 'high', 'view', 'world', 'where', 'most', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'pointless', 'However', 'saving', 'grace', 'movie', 'were', 'spectacular', 'landscapes', 'wonderful', 'vintage', 'cars', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Chenault', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'good.Kemp', 'big', 'time', 'drinker', 'checkered', 'writing', 'career', 'could', 'call', 'being', 'failed', 'novelist', 'career', 'who', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'work', 'ailing', 'newspaper', 'up', 'Sala', 'photographer', 'same', 'paper', 'up', 'rooming', 'even', 'stranger', 'other', 'roommate', 'who', 'also', 'sort', 'works', 'same', 'paper', 'probably', 'most', 'oddly', 'intriguing', 'character', 'show', 'course', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'got', 'way.What', 'drunken', 'high', 'ramble', 'sorts', 'misadventures', 'are', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'not', 'occasional', 'nod', 'plot', 'revolving', 'secret', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'gap', 'rich', 'who', 'are', 'exploiting', 'island', 'poor', 'brought', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'nothing', 'really', 'come', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'something', 'might', 'get', 'accomplished', 'Kemp', 'going', 'take', 'stand', 'do', 'SOMETHING', 'other', 'get', 'trouble', 'find', 'next', 'high', ""n't"", 'lot', 'plot', 'seemed', 'pointless.Again', 'reminded', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'playing', 'charm', 'would', 'so', 'dislike', 'guy', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'Which', ""n't"", 'say', 'hated', 'movie', 'entirely', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fascination', 'pointless', 'essentially', 'plotless', 'writing.Warning', 'lot', 'drug', 'use', 'movie', 'show', 'what', 'stupid', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'get', 'result', 'would', 'be', 'squicked', 'offended', 'chicken-fighting', 'scenes', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'watch']",The Rum Diary 2011

Thompson the following biographical information is helpful: `Hunter Stockton Thompson (1937 - 2005) was an American journalist and author who wrote The Rum Diary (published in1998), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971), Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 (1973), The Curse of Lono (1983), and Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1966). He is credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of reporting where reporters involve themselves in the action to such a degree that they become central figures of their stories. He is known also for his lifelong use of alcohol, LSD, mescaline, and cocaine (among other substances); his love of firearms; his inveterate hatred of Richard Nixon; and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism. In 1960 Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine El Sportivo, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rico English-language daily The San Juan Star, but its managing editor, future novelist William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends and after the demise of El Sportivo, Thompson worked as a stringer for the New York Herald Tribune and a few stateside papers on Caribbean issues with Kennedy working as his editor. While suffering a bout of health problems, he committed suicide in 2005 at the age of 67.'In the film version of Thompson's autobiographical book, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) is a freelance journalist who finds himself at a critical turning point in his life while writing for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean under toupeed editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). He is accompanied by the staff photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli), the drunken staff writer Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi) in his discovery of the many wonders of Puerto Rico, not the least of which is a group of entrepreneurs lead by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) - who happens to be living with the stunning Chenault (Amber Heard) who Paul is attracted to - and a series of disreputable business men bent on `touristifyng' a neighboring island.  Paul is a drunk and finds innumerable distractions and challenges as he tries to worm his way through the playing field of lost souls.The story is Hunter S. Thompson all the way and Bruce Robinson has adapted Thompson's book in much the same way the novelist communicates: Robinson also directs. Depp, as usual, manages to make the strange lead character not only interesting but also ingratiating.  The supporting cast is solid. The film gets off track many times, but as pure entertainment it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours watching Depp create another memorable character based on life!

Set in the 1960s, it has an otherworldly, nostalgic setting that's rare in today's cinema.  It feels like a tribute in some ways to world cinema of that era and the good ol' days of being American.  It's like watching a Graham Greene or Hemingway-esque novel spiked with rum.  I think the people who don't enjoy it just don't get what the film is supposed to be about - and it's hardly complicated.Rum Diary also has shades of a Coen Brothers film but is far more down to earth.

Thompson'sweakest works, published some 30 years after it was penned, and in large part due to the fact he wasn't writing much new anymore.  The premise seems funny enough, but the end result is kind of a Fear and Loathing in San Juan in the late 50s, with revolution brewing in the Caribbean.  The only problem is that Thompson was very much a novice at the time and it painfully shows.  What we end up with is little more than a Men's Adventure Story set in Puerto Rico, not the ""Great Puerto Rican Novel"" that he imagined.Locals are either wild-eyed natives or smarmy real estate developers with a variety of expats hanging out at posh resorts and bowling alleys.  Real estate is gold, we are told by Sanderson, who for some odd reason befriends young Paul Kemp, who manages to snag a reporting job at a struggling English-language fish wrapper.  Sala and Moberg provide the requisite odd balls for Kemp to play off.  Of course, we have to have a lady in red in the sultry Chenault, who ultimately gets thrown to the natives like some sacrificial offering.

1510108,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B0064OUGK0,"Jeff Johnson ""Jeff Johnson""","[0, 1]","This movie takes place in 1960 and is based on the Hunter S. Thompson Novel of the same name. Johnny Depp stars as... what's his name. I wish I cared. Anyway, he is a new horoscope writer for the San Juan Star (newspaper in Puerto Rico) with a comedic drinking problem. The last writer was fired for a drinking problem and it seems like almost character in this movie has a drinking problem. Soon after arriving, Johnny gets bumped up a level in the newspaper. He then meets what could loosely be considered the movie's villain, played by Aaron Eckhart who tries to buy up Puente Rican land to build a hotel. For whatever reason he needs to bring in a newspaper reporter to put a positive spin on things. It really seemed like Johnny's role in this master plan wasn't needed, especially for a reporter who has had a week of experience.  There is an undertone of the natural inhabitants of Puerto Rico hating the white people from the US and Johnny is a bystander of this all who gets wrapped into it when Aaron Eckhart threatens the locals and Johnny's best friend in the movie ends up offending a local restaurant employee.Johnny falls for a beautiful woman that he later finds out is a taken by a powerful man. This is no romantic story, in fact it ultimately seems to go no where. She becomes a key part in let downs that this movie brings. Certain scenes which I feel are very important are just left out. Not sex scenes, but when she comes to Johnny after an important hiatus, he tells his friend give us a few minutes and it is never mentioned afterward. There is no scene in there.The commercials portray this movie as a comedy and that's what I was expecting. There are moments of comedy and down right hilarity in the movie, but that is equil to about 5 minutes of a 120 minute movie. Most of the comedy comes from Johnny's friend that drives a tiny blue car that doesn't work very well. Somewhere in the movie they end up in a chase scene at night in the little blue car where Johnny ends up using booze and a lighter to keep the chasers at bay. The damsel in this movie also makes for some good comedy when she's out with Johnny for a drive. But really, everything in the commercial is the only comedy there is.There are some good things though, such as the entire movie takes place in Puerto Rico, so it is colorful, lush, vibrant and beautiful. Scenes of beauty everywhere from crashing waves and bright planes overhead, to lavish jungles to ghettos like the one that Johnny Depp ends up living in.If you are expecting some ultimate ending where good prevails and everything goes like you'd expect... don't. That's one of the many things that will leave you unfulfilled. Nothing really goes anywhere meaningful in this movie. Such as when Aaron Eckhart yells at Johnny for bringing his friend along to a meeting when Johnny signed a confidentiality agreement... nothing happens. You'd think someone would get killed or end up in litigation... nope. Nothing is ever mentioned again. Maybe that's what you get for expecting something. Toward the end I really felt like you could have fast forwarded the last 20 minutes and not missed anything, which is anti climactic. After all of this, I really can't recommend anyone spend 120 minutes of their life to see this.",2,Beautiful Looking Movie that will leave you unfulfilled at the end,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,3275,"['movie', 'place', '1960', 'based', 'Hunter', 'S.', 'Thompson', 'Novel', 'same', 'name', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'what', 'name', 'wish', 'cared', 'Anyway', 'new', 'horoscope', 'writer', 'San', 'Juan', 'Star', 'newspaper', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'comedic', 'drinking', 'problem', 'last', 'writer', 'was', 'fired', 'drinking', 'problem', 'almost', 'character', 'movie', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Soon', 'arriving', 'Johnny', 'bumped', 'up', 'level', 'newspaper', 'then', 'what', 'could', 'loosely', 'be', 'considered', 'movie', 'villain', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'buy', 'up', 'Puente', 'Rican', 'land', 'build', 'hotel', 'reason', 'bring', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'put', 'positive', 'spin', 'things', 'really', 'seemed', 'Johnny', 'role', 'master', 'plan', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'especially', 'reporter', 'who', 'had', 'week', 'experience', 'undertone', 'natural', 'inhabitants', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'hating', 'white', 'people', 'US', 'Johnny', 'bystander', 'who', 'wrapped', 'when', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'locals', 'Johnny', 'best', 'friend', 'movie', 'up', 'offending', 'local', 'restaurant', 'employee.Johnny', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'later', 'out', 'taken', 'powerful', 'man', 'romantic', 'story', 'fact', 'ultimately', 'go', 'where', 'key', 'part', 'let', 'downs', 'movie', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'feel', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'out', 'Not', 'sex', 'scenes', 'when', 'Johnny', 'important', 'hiatus', 'friend', 'give', 'few', 'minutes', 'never', 'mentioned', 'afterward', 'scene', 'there.The', 'commercials', 'portray', 'movie', 'comedy', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'are', 'moments', 'comedy', 'down', 'right', 'hilarity', 'movie', 'equil', '5', 'minutes', '120', 'minute', 'movie', 'Most', 'comedy', 'Johnny', 'friend', 'tiny', 'blue', 'car', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Somewhere', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'chase', 'scene', 'night', 'little', 'blue', 'car', 'where', 'Johnny', 'up', 'using', 'booze', 'lighter', 'keep', 'chasers', 'bay', 'damsel', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'comedy', 'when', 'out', 'Johnny', 'drive', 'really', 'everything', 'commercial', 'only', 'comedy', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'such', 'entire', 'movie', 'place', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'colorful', 'lush', 'vibrant', 'beautiful', 'Scenes', 'beauty', 'everywhere', 'crashing', 'waves', 'bright', 'planes', 'overhead', 'lavish', 'jungles', 'ghettos', 'one', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'up', 'living', 'are', 'expecting', 'ultimate', 'ending', 'where', 'good', 'prevails', 'everything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'leave', 'unfulfilled', 'Nothing', 'really', 'anywhere', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'Such', 'when', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Johnny', 'bringing', 'friend', 'meeting', 'when', 'Johnny', 'signed', 'confidentiality', 'agreement', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'think', 'someone', 'would', 'get', 'killed', 'end', 'up', 'litigation', 'nope', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'again', 'Maybe', 'what', 'get', 'expecting', 'something', 'end', 'really', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'not', 'missed', 'anything', 'anti', 'climactic', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'spend', '120', 'minutes', 'life', 'see']",The Rum Diary 2011

1510112,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0064OUGK0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","The Rum Diary is based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson, written in the early `60s but not published until 1998. Similarly, this adaptation began shooting in March of 2009 and was not released until October of 2011. After a 19-year-absence, Bruce Robinson returns to the director's chair and, considering his own problems with alcohol and his landmark film Withnail & I covering similar territory, he was an appropriate choice to direct. Johnny Depp plays the lead role and produces. His love for Thompson is well-documented. He, of course, played Raoul Duke in the adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and was close friends with Thompson. Depp had been trying to get this made for years and it was made with Thompson's blessing, although it did not enter principal photography until four years after his death.This adaptation has divided audiences. I have not read the novel, but many have said it's unfaithful and leaves out some of the best parts of the book. I can't speak for this personally, but I can't say I'm surprised. Even with no frame of reference, something seems to be missing here. It seems strange that Depp would fight so hard to get this novel adapted for the screen only to throw out the best bits of the novel, but truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. It's well-known that Thompson wrote the novel after moving to Puerto Rico and unsuccessfully applying for a job as a journalist at The San Juan Star. The movie seems to imagine what would have occurred had Thompson secured the gig.Opening in San Juan in 1960, Paul Kemp (Depp), a failed novelist and heavy drinker from New York, awakens from a night fraught with drinking. Putting on a straw hat and sunglasses, he goes to his job interview at The San Juan Star. The editor, E.J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) hires Kemp only because he foresees the newspaper going under.Settling in, Kemp befriends Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli), the staff photographer and vicariously befriends Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), a reporter who has retreated so far into the mind of an addict he doesn't seem to be able to consciously realize that he's been fired. While Kemp and Sala get into a series of misadventures around Puerto Rico, Kemp is talked up by Hal Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a shady property developer who wants to manipulate Kemp's journalistic skill to his financial benefit. Sanderson's fianc&eacute;e Chenault (Amber Heard) may just seal the deal for Kemp.Anyone expecting Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is going to be disappointed. The essence of Raoul Duke is apparent in Depp's portrayal of Paul Kemp, but the film and the character are wildly different both tonally and aesthetically. What ultimately brings the film down is that it's a lot of rambling with no sense of direction. The locale is beautiful (the film was actually shot in Puerto Rico), Ms. Heard is exquisitely beautiful, and the actors are fun to watch, but the story isn't compelling enough to be an engaging film. Perhaps the novel was, but Bruce Robinson apparently took too many creative liberties with the story.With that said, The Rum Diary is a different beast from the average mainstream film. I doubt it would have seen a wide release without Depp's involvement. There's a darkness, a cynicism; a sort of dour pacing that not's often seen in mainstream film. This may be the Hollywood streamlined version of the book, but its European flavor is quite different from the average Hollywood-fare. The way the relationship between Depp and Heard pans out is pretty depressing by Hollywood standards. The film even ends on a sad note, until a title card glosses over everything.It's clear from his performance that Depp was passionate about this project, even if that passion was ego-driven. Watching him play the more subdued Paul Kemp is just as droll as watching him play Raoul Duke. It's nice to see such a marvelous talent return to some form of reality. It's been a long time since Depp has played a typical human being. His chemistry with Rispoli is nice, comparable to the chemistry he shared with Del Toro in Fear and Loathing. The two share many scenes together and get some poignancy and humor out of those scenes. Ribisi fits nicely into Thompson's world; hilariously over-the-top, but fascinating to watch.The Rum Diary is interesting and quirky, but ultimately a bit of a failure. Considering the talent involved it should have been so much better. It fails to engage its audience and doesn't develop enough story or character, despite a two-hour running time. If nothing else, The Rum Diary has inspired me to read the book just so I can see what a missed opportunity this was.GRADE: C+",3,"A Lot of Rambling, With No Sense of Direction",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,4652,"['Rum', 'Diary', 'based', 'novel', 'Hunter', 'S.', 'Thompson', 'written', 'early', '60s', 'not', 'published', '1998', 'Similarly', 'adaptation', 'began', 'shooting', 'March', '2009', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'October', '2011', '19-year-absence', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'director', 'chair', 'considering', 'own', 'problems', 'alcohol', 'landmark', 'film', 'Withnail', 'covering', 'similar', 'territory', 'was', 'appropriate', 'choice', 'direct', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'lead', 'role', 'love', 'Thompson', 'well-documented', 'course', 'played', 'Raoul', 'Duke', 'adaptation', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'close', 'friends', 'Thompson', 'Depp', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'made', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'Thompson', 'blessing', 'did', 'not', 'enter', 'principal', 'photography', 'four', 'years', 'death.This', 'adaptation', 'divided', 'audiences', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'unfaithful', 'out', 'best', 'parts', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Even', 'frame', 'reference', 'something', 'be', 'missing', 'here', 'strange', 'Depp', 'would', 'fight', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'novel', 'adapted', 'screen', 'only', 'throw', 'out', 'best', 'bits', 'novel', 'truth', 'sometimes', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'well-known', 'Thompson', 'wrote', 'novel', 'moving', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'unsuccessfully', 'applying', 'job', 'journalist', 'San', 'Juan', 'Star', 'movie', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'occurred', 'had', 'Thompson', 'secured', 'gig.Opening', 'San', 'Juan', '1960', 'Paul', 'Kemp', 'Depp', 'failed', 'novelist', 'heavy', 'drinker', 'New', 'York', 'night', 'fraught', 'drinking', 'Putting', 'straw', 'hat', 'sunglasses', 'job', 'interview', 'San', 'Juan', 'Star', 'editor', 'E.J', 'Lotterman', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Kemp', 'only', 'newspaper', 'going', 'under.Settling', 'Kemp', 'Bob', 'Sala', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'staff', 'photographer', 'vicariously', 'befriends', 'Moberg', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'reporter', 'who', 'retreated', 'so', 'far', 'mind', 'addict', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'consciously', 'realize', 'been', 'fired', 'Kemp', 'Sala', 'get', 'series', 'misadventures', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Kemp', 'talked', 'up', 'Hal', 'Sanderson', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'shady', 'property', 'developer', 'who', 'manipulate', 'Kemp', 'journalistic', 'skill', 'financial', 'benefit', 'Sanderson', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Chenault', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'may', 'just', 'seal', 'deal', 'Kemp.Anyone', 'expecting', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'essence', 'Raoul', 'Duke', 'apparent', 'Depp', 'portrayal', 'Paul', 'Kemp', 'film', 'character', 'are', 'wildly', 'different', 'tonally', 'aesthetically', 'What', 'ultimately', 'film', 'down', 'lot', 'rambling', 'sense', 'direction', 'locale', 'beautiful', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Ms.', 'Heard', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'story', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'enough', 'be', 'engaging', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'novel', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'apparently', 'took', 'too', 'many', 'creative', 'liberties', 'story.With', 'said', 'Rum', 'Diary', 'different', 'beast', 'average', 'mainstream', 'film', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'wide', 'release', 'Depp', 'involvement', 'darkness', 'cynicism', 'sort', 'dour', 'pacing', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'streamlined', 'version', 'book', 'European', 'flavor', 'quite', 'different', 'average', 'Hollywood-fare', 'way', 'relationship', 'Depp', 'Heard', 'out', 'pretty', 'depressing', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'film', 'even', 'sad', 'note', 'title', 'card', 'glosses', 'everything.It', 'clear', 'performance', 'Depp', 'was', 'passionate', 'project', 'even', 'passion', 'was', 'ego-driven', 'Watching', 'play', 'more', 'subdued', 'Paul', 'Kemp', 'just', 'as', 'droll', 'watching', 'play', 'Raoul', 'Duke', 'nice', 'see', 'such', 'marvelous', 'talent', 'return', 'form', 'reality', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'Depp', 'played', 'typical', 'human', 'being', 'chemistry', 'Rispoli', 'nice', 'comparable', 'chemistry', 'shared', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'two', 'share', 'many', 'scenes', 'together', 'get', 'poignancy', 'humor', 'scenes', 'Ribisi', 'nicely', 'Thompson', 'world', 'hilariously', 'over-the-top', 'fascinating', 'watch.The', 'Rum', 'Diary', 'interesting', 'quirky', 'ultimately', 'bit', 'failure', 'Considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'engage', 'audience', ""n't"", 'develop', 'enough', 'story', 'character', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'nothing', 'else', 'Rum', 'Diary', 'inspired', 'read', 'book', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was.GRADE', 'C+']",The Rum Diary 2011

Once it started to cause you to smile or laugh and so humorous the Depp bouncing on top of the side kick's lap all the way down the back steps their pathetic car bounced. If you cut it out and showed it as a short take it would be famous. And then there was that feeling that you had seen some of these characters not long before. The tall skinny one bad eye dude, the high pitched cackle of the black witch, the sidekick and even the menacing roommate that brought rum filters to make some sort of odd high octane booze. Hadn't we just seen these people in Pirates? I feel too many people tried to make this film too serious. Once it took off we lost ourselves and went with it and it was pure fun. And whew as we waited for that other shoe to fall...it never really did. I mean we never saw the super ugly happen and there were all sorts of possible uglies. I was afraid half a dozen people might be killed but didn't happen. So except for nod to tragic there was the cock fights but even they were tempered down a bit so most squirmish like myself could get through.

I haven't read the writers books it's based on but will be interested in at least his written version of this one. Half the time if you've read the book you hate the movie.

Depp also conveys well his character's understanding that this stint in Puerto Rico is destined to become One of Those Experiences.The real strength of the film, though, is in the newsroom scenes, especially the performances of Richard Jenkins, as the editor, and, most especially, Michael Rispoli (is it?) as the photographer. Rispoli's performance is the best newshound portrayal I've ever seen (shades of Kevin Costner playing the laborer in that Boston flick); (for whatever reason getting the newsman right has proven illusive to many a fine actor. Crowe was awful, Streep pretty good, and Marisa Tomei very good); and Jenkins' is second-best. He is especially good when nailing Depp as being hungover, his first day on the job.Solid too is Eckhart. He's the bad guy, but he's not evil.

The paper's editor (Richard Jenkins) is a cartoon like character trying to keep the paper running although it is despised by the locals.  The paper shies away from controversial subjects because advertisers don't want to see negativity.  Booze, especially locally made rum, is a character in the film as well.  Paul becomes friends with a newspaper photographer named Sala (Michael Rispoli) and sometime reporter Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) who is in a constant state of inebriation.Paul is recruited by one of the island's American land developers to prepare a sales promotion document associated with an under-the-table land grab of a small island off the mainland. It had been used for target practice by the U. S. Navy.  The developer (Aaron Eckhart) has a beautiful beach house and a beautiful live-in girlfriend (Amber Heard).  Paul and Chenault (Heard) have eyes for each other but Paul manages to keep his urges under control until events change everyone's relationship.The movie is at its best when Depp is allowed to take control.  Even when he's not doing all the talking, he remains the film's focus.  There are numerous funny situations and funny lines, but the director/writer Bruce Robinson also meanders into murky political issues, island poverty, racism, bigotry and government sovereignty.  The focus is never clear as to what kind of movie he's making.  As a consequence, the overall result is a mixed bag.  The look of the movie is really excellent.  Whether it is the gorgeous beaches, the `60's glassed-in beach houses or the dilapidated city lofts, they are shot beautifully by Dariusz Wolski.  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention a truly great soundtrack which includes some original music by Christopher Young.The Blu ray transfer really sparkles.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The movie if full of colorful cars of the period, beautiful blue skies and darker blue oceans and it all looks great.  More than many transfers, this one has a real film quality to it.  Likewise, there are no issues with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 track.  The sound is first rate from the superior soundtrack to the loud club scene to the ambiant noise.

Depp plays Paul Kemp, a hard-living New York journalist that winds up in San Juan.  As he gets a feel for the local colour (and booze), Kemp comes across the shady mogul Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) and instantly falls for his stunning fiance (Amber Heard) in the process.  Kemp's journey takes him through the good and bad of the locale and its denizens, although by the time the credits roll, you'll be left feeling a little empty inside.  The spirit of Thompson is definitely felt throughout the proceedings, but for some reason sadly it just doesn't feel one hundred percent right.  Still though, Depp is wonderful, and the rest of the cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins, Michael Rispoli, and Giovanni Ribisi in a scene-stealing role, are great.

1510130,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B0064OUGK0,Newton Ooi,"[1, 1]","Since 2000, Johnny Depp has dominated Hollywood as an actor who fits seamlessly into roles that one would think the characters were written for him specifically.  Of course we are all familiar with the big films such as the POTC franchise, Finding Neverland, and his roles in thee CGI/animated flicks Corpse Bride and Alice in Wonderland.  However, it is some of the smaller, less well-known roles in which Mr. Depp has shown of his acting expertise.  Probably the best one is this adaptation of the book The Rum Diary.  Here, Johnny Depp plays a down-and-out reporter who finds himself in Puerto Rico stumbling from one mishap to another; all the while working on a story to embarrass the ruling class of white American expatriates hiding their wealth on this island.  Through it all, he juggles an illicit romance with the gorgeous Chenault, girlfriend of the island's biggest businessman.  The movie is filled with contrasts in scenery as scenes shift from the urban slums to the tropical beauty of the natural surroundings.  Likewise the dialogue alternates between the drunken complaints of Depp's character, and the polished sales pitches of his antagonist played by Aaron Eckhart.  The soundtrack of the movie is probably the best part, fast, upbeat, tropical with tinges of Caribbean, jazz, African, hip-hop and rock & roll and mixed in.  My primary complaint is the meandering, wondering plot line that often left me bored with the film.  In conclusion, a better than average film that really shows of the skills of Mr. Depp.  However, the story was not to my taste, so I give it 3/5 stars.",3,Another perfect role for Johnny Depp,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1599,"['2000', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'dominated', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'who', 'seamlessly', 'roles', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'specifically', 'course', 'are', 'familiar', 'big', 'films', 'such', 'POTC', 'franchise', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'roles', 'thee', 'CGI/animated', 'flicks', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'However', 'smaller', 'less', 'well-known', 'roles', 'Mr.', 'Depp', 'shown', 'acting', 'expertise', 'Probably', 'best', 'one', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Rum', 'Diary', 'Here', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'down-and-out', 'reporter', 'who', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'stumbling', 'one', 'mishap', 'while', 'working', 'story', 'embarrass', 'ruling', 'class', 'white', 'American', 'expatriates', 'hiding', 'wealth', 'island', 'illicit', 'romance', 'gorgeous', 'Chenault', 'girlfriend', 'island', 'biggest', 'businessman', 'movie', 'filled', 'contrasts', 'scenery', 'scenes', 'shift', 'urban', 'slums', 'tropical', 'beauty', 'natural', 'surroundings', 'Likewise', 'dialogue', 'drunken', 'complaints', 'Depp', 'character', 'polished', 'sales', 'pitches', 'antagonist', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'fast', 'upbeat', 'tropical', 'tinges', 'Caribbean', 'jazz', 'African', 'hip-hop', 'rock', 'roll', 'mixed', 'primary', 'complaint', 'meandering', 'wondering', 'plot', 'line', 'often', 'left', 'bored', 'film', 'conclusion', 'better', 'average', 'film', 'really', 'skills', 'Mr.', 'Depp', 'However', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'taste', 'give', '3/5', 'stars']",The Rum Diary 2011

I was not deterred by the mixed reviews and was still quite syked to blind buy the Blu-ray on release-day.The movie is great! It is a lot of fun, smart, and highly entertaining to the right crowd. If you liked the substance of Fear and Loathing you may enjoy this. However if you were simply entertained by the dinosaurs in Fear and Loathing then you may not fully understand what was going on in that film or this one. Rum Diary is based loosely off a true story, yet it is still charming and informative. As other reviews have said, the first half is much more fun, and the second half begins to drive harder on the drama aspect of the story. Over-all I loved the film and was highly entertained. Fans of Thompson or Depp or the rest of the cast should not hesitate to check this one out.The supporting case also did quite well. I was especially impressed with Giovanni Ribisi and Amber Heard who even in their smaller roles still managed to impress and stand out. Giovanni's character was hilarious and I even found myself re-watching scenes to hear what he said for a chuckle. I never really noticed it in her other roles, but Amber Heard is gorgeous. The movie takes place in the mid-20th century and Heards outfits and style really fit well with her look. She moved up a notch in my book. Michael Rispoli was also very funny and the Depp/Rispoli team was quite entertaining as they went to cock fights and other little adventures. I still remember Michael Rispoli as Spinner in Death to Smoochy though.The PQ is breathtaking as the scenes of Puerto Rico are so very beautiful and the colors really pop. The image is very consistently sharp, crisp and clear. Even in the dark scenes the image still manages perfect contrast, clarity and depth.The AQ is very crisp and clean with remarkable dialog as well as music and ambient noises. I was impressed!Don't listen to the bad reviews and give this movie a chance. I loved it and I am glad I own it as while the movie starts on a fun note and ends in drama, there is a bit of magic in there which will bring me back for many more viewings in the future.",4,Fun Charming Movie that Grows on You!

He's the ""fresh meat"" for the local paper, a journalist and self-proclaimed ""failed author"", although throughout this movie you will find him dedicated to his post in his own fashion.The first day of his new job, he is still quite drunk from the rum-soaked night previously and the editor-in-chief Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) is already questioning his morals and capability.  Of course, we are seeing Johnny Depp portray a character that is intoxicated the major part of this movie and I think is hilarious handling it.Kemp is introduced to Rob Sala (Michael Rispoli), the 'staff recorder' and later to Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) the 'religious correspondent'.  These titles are certainly a laugh in themselves as they are not even close to what these guys are up to.  They go in and out of the paper's office, argue with Lotterman and go off in whatever misguided direction that they came from.  Watch Ribisi's character in this, as I think he steals the show in several places.The plot is quite simple and I'm guessing a little more so than some people may be expecting from the movie. Kemp was brought into a sinking ship of a paper to appease the locals and try to keep it afloat.  This is a kind of slack-off position for Kemp to have to handle, one he does with gusto.The 'problem' comes when Kemp and his buddies begin to care about the paper and the people of San Juan, then start to believe in their rights as readers of it.  Aaron Eckhart does a great job as the arrogant cad he is here. Amber Heard does a good job as his girlfriend, and Kemp's object of desire also.Depp's mannerisms, facial expressions and sarcastic humor are all spot on. I definitely can see why he was personally behind the project.  One does not have to be a Hunter S. Thompson fan to enjoy this movie whatsoever.  It is not like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" as it may appear several people are comparing this to.  Same author, different situation (semi-autobiographical account)--although one hallucinogenic type scene does take place between Kemp and his close buddy, Sala.Moburg floats in and out of the head state he is in to end up really enjoying Kemp, and gains a respect for himself too.  Eventually these three are sharing an apartment for awhile.  The deluded conversations are priceless.I enjoyed this movie very much by just taking it for what it is, a Johnny Depp comedy/drama.

Like many other reviewers mentioned this movie is nothing like Fear and Loathing. Which for me is much better. It has always been one of my least favorites and is one of the few Depp movies I do not own. I will also agree that this movie does seem too long for what it is. There are definitely some parts that drag on. Sometimes I wonder if it's just because we've come to expect movies to be full action all the time or if it really does just drag on. Some of the older movies that were classics seem to drag on to me, so who really knows.I will say that felt that Depp's performance was stellar in this movie, as are with all his movies. So, if you like his stuff you will probably like this movie. I'm not really a fan of Amber Heard but I thought her performance was good as well. To me if it wasn't for her and Paul Kemp's (Depp) relationship in the movie it would have been a complete bore. The guy Kemp rooms with also has some pretty good scenes with him that give the movie some humor.Truthfully, I felt as if Moberg's character just brought the movie down. Some of the lines his character says was offensive and honestly pathetic. I understand he was suppose to be a drunk wild man and he was just portraying that. I still just found myself really disliking the character. I've even seen Giovanni Ribisi in other movies and thought he was great, but I just didn't like Moberg. I would even go as far to say that if his character had been left out of the movie I would probably have rated this movie five stars.",4,Basically for the Major Depp Fan.,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1656,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'Depp', 'fan', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'least', 'watchable', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'nothing', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Which', 'much', 'better', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'least', 'favorites', 'one', 'few', 'Depp', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'will', 'also', 'agree', 'movie', 'seem', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'are', 'definitely', 'parts', 'drag', 'Sometimes', 'wonder', 'just', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'movies', 'be', 'full', 'action', 'time', 'really', 'just', 'drag', 'older', 'movies', 'were', 'classics', 'seem', 'drag', 'so', 'who', 'really', 'knows.I', 'will', 'say', 'felt', 'Depp', 'performance', 'was', 'stellar', 'movie', 'are', 'movies', 'So', 'stuff', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'Paul', 'Kemp', 'Depp', 'relationship', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'bore', 'guy', 'Kemp', 'rooms', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'scenes', 'give', 'movie', 'humor.Truthfully', 'felt', 'Moberg', 'character', 'just', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'lines', 'character', 'was', 'offensive', 'honestly', 'pathetic', 'understand', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'drunk', 'wild', 'man', 'was', 'just', 'portraying', 'still', 'just', 'found', 'really', 'disliking', 'character', ""'ve"", 'even', 'seen', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'other', 'movies', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Moberg', 'would', 'even', 'go', 'far', 'say', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', 'five', 'stars']",The Rum Diary 2011

The paper is going down hill. The editor, Richard Jenkins, wants new blood, even though Paul appears to be everything he doesn't want in an employee. There is unrest outside, but no one at the newspaper knows what is going on. The humor is fast and witty. The man Paul is replacing was ""artistic"" and ""raped to death"" by sailors.Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone. He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing. He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up. He describes the obese Yankee tourists as ""great whites"" the most deadly creature known to man. They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping. The more you spend, the more you save. His writings tend to be cynical.Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief. Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional. There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, ""Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal.""  While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because ""I do horoscopes."" The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson. A local proclaims, ""This country was founded on genocide and slavery...then they brought in Jesus like a bar of soap.""The movie is also critical of the dummy-down media who kills stories so as to not offend their advertisers. In the film, capitalism is destroying Puerto Rico, creating a war of haves vs. have-nots while Cuba turns to communism. A rich man claims, ""Liberals are college educated communists with Negro thoughts."" To them the problem with the world is the communists. The movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.The movie is not all political. Just as you think Paul has reached bottom, he discovers ""a drug so powerful that the FBI gives it to communists."" NOTE: LSD in liquid form, administered to the eye should be done in split drops with three full drops being way too much, possibly causing hallucinations...or so I've been told.Good acting, good script, funny and very entertaining. Staunch conservatives might be critical of the leftist views contained in this Hollywood film. A must view for Hunter S. Thompson fans.F-bomb, excessive drinking, drug use.

If you can't find the truth or your superiors don't it want it published, make it up. At least that's the preferred method undertaken at The San Juan Star in this bizarre comedy based on the novel of same name.Paul Kemp (played in typically off-the-wall fashion by Johnny Depp) is a novelist whose greatest work of fiction was the resume which got him a job at the Puerto Rico periodical. Determined to show the real living conditions outside the beach houses and five-star resorts, Kemp (Depp) experiences and recounts tales of dive bars, cock fights, and poverty among the local population. It becomes clear to him that his employers were looking for something they can print in a brochure, as opposed to the facts. While trying to satisfy his employers, Kemp encounters a local businessman by the name of Sanderson (played by Aaron Eckhart) after a chance encounter with his much younger fianc&eacute;e Chenault (played by Amber Heard). Sanderson has a proposition for Kemp and Chenault proves herself to be intriguing, unsatisfied, and just out of Kemp's reach.While the accent's gone and the surroundings are meant to be gritty rather than supernatural, Paul Kemp is played here as though he's Jack Sparrow in a suit and tie for most of the film. He's perpetually inebriated and skates from one `dangerous' situation to the next without as much as a scratch. And while the later portions of the film seem to build toward some dramatic confrontation, what Kemp and the viewers are left with is disappointment.",2,Zany and off-the-wall in a bad way,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,1580,"['reporter', 'ideally', 'supposed', 'seek', 'out', 'expose', 'truth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'truth', 'superiors', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'published', 'make', 'up', 'least', 'preferred', 'method', 'undertaken', 'San', 'Juan', 'Star', 'bizarre', 'comedy', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name.Paul', 'Kemp', 'played', 'typically', 'off-the-wall', 'fashion', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'novelist', 'greatest', 'work', 'fiction', 'was', 'resume', 'got', 'job', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'periodical', 'Determined', 'show', 'real', 'living', 'conditions', 'beach', 'houses', 'five-star', 'resorts', 'Kemp', 'Depp', 'experiences', 'recounts', 'tales', 'dive', 'bars', 'cock', 'fights', 'poverty', 'local', 'population', 'clear', 'employers', 'were', 'looking', 'something', 'can', 'print', 'brochure', 'opposed', 'facts', 'trying', 'satisfy', 'employers', 'Kemp', 'local', 'businessman', 'name', 'Sanderson', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'chance', 'encounter', 'much', 'younger', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Chenault', 'played', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Sanderson', 'proposition', 'Kemp', 'Chenault', 'be', 'intriguing', 'unsatisfied', 'just', 'Kemp', 'reach.While', 'accent', 'gone', 'surroundings', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'gritty', 'rather', 'supernatural', 'Paul', 'Kemp', 'played', 'here', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'suit', 'tie', 'most', 'film', 'perpetually', 'inebriated', 'skates', 'one', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'next', 'as', 'much', 'scratch', 'later', 'portions', 'film', 'seem', 'build', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'what', 'Kemp', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'disappointment']",The Rum Diary 2011

Well, it isn't. It is a better movie. Though it is cruel to compare the two movies, both brilliant in their own genres, this one is a better mainstream cinema.The movie begins with the protagonist played by Depp waking up with a hangover in Puerto Rico hotel. He is there for a job as a journalist and he is late. He is habitually late throughout the movie which could be taken as a metaphor in its own way. The decadence of a nation, while the rich get richer and tear down more truths to establish a mafia of real estate barons.Depp's character is brilliant as always. Like all his films he brings a lot to this one too. Makes the character living breathing personality that will make you stand and cheer. He is in a new job in an old newspaper which seems to be on the verge of going out of business. Depp meets interesting people. The photographer and the crime reporter are brilliantly played by talented actors. The whole atmosphere of dread and celebration is there for you to witness. Dread and desperation for many poverty stricken bitter people. Celebrations for a handful of rich elite. Enter Eckhart as the big player making things possible for his criminal associates. He wants to hire Depp's skills. Helps out Depp when he is in trouble. Depp follows the events as if in a daze. He just goes with the flow. Even falls hard for Eckhart's girl. Yet he is a gentleman throughout. He single-handedly keeps the flame of righteous journalism burning. Alas, no one gives a damn.The movie is a lot closer to the chaos of ""The Tailor of Panama"" than to Depp's previous turn as a junkie journalist in ""Fear and Loathing..."", and you have to enjoy the story rather than compare things with Hunter S Thompson's original works.Apart from the leading cast, the best thing to look forward to is the music by Christopher Young. If you bought this DVD and liked it, I am sure you will be tempted to go out and buy the Original Sound Track of this motion picture too.There is not a single dull moment in the lives of these mesmerising characters. The rum, the locals, the beatup car, the woman, the job, the jail, the parties, the cockfights, the drunken dialogue, the entire set and visuals, it is all a thrill to watch.Keep an open mind and beware not to compare it to other movies/books and you will surely enjoy this product.

1510153,AFEN54UGJQOK9,B0064OUGK0,"wally gator ""the only""","[1, 1]","Do not try to pick this movie apart without first realizing exactly what is going on; Johnny Depp, who has done a magnificant turn as Hunter S. Thompson twice before, once as narrator, takes it on again... this time portraying him in 1960 Puerto Rico.  The movie takes most of its material from the Hunter S book of the same name, but rather then try to be really 'based' on the 'Story' (the book itself is more a diary then a story)  it is more about the actors paying homage to the characters as they envision them. Opposed to necessarilly how Hunter S. Thompson portrayed them.This movie didn't have a narrator like other S. Thompson based films. (Ever check out a film called 'Where the Buffalo Roam' with Bill Murray?) I felt like it didn't need one. Johnny Depp is the public preception of Hunter S. His dialougue played out as if the whole thing was in the point of view of Hunter S's narrative... as opposed to being the acted out versions of actual narrative from the text itself, ala Fear and Loathing.Some of the bits were even adapted from other works. The characters in the book, for instance, never take morphine and stare at a lobster tank rattling off about the American dream. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon are never mentioned in the book and there are instances where two characters in the book are combined into one (Sanderson is also Yeamon...and while Sanderson is succesful, he's hardly the Mad Men Playboy type we see here...) It's obvious that the film tries to combine all of Hunter S. into one story rather than just the young 1958 version that Hunter S. wrote it as.The movie takes you on a Hunter S. Thompson ride, not perfectly, but if you want perfect then read the books. This is some actors giving their own personal interpretations of the charcters they play.  The action unfolds under them into a noirish fifties paperback. The girl is sexy as hell, the cars are cool, the dialougue is sharp, the scenery is great, the music is wild....
