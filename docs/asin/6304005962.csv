395237,A3W3PK9TVKEH7Q,6304005962,Allen Jackson,"[2, 2]","Wow! As a fan of this film, I had heard the Criterion Collection Blu Ray was beautiful, and couldn't wait to get one for myself.  When I got mine and viewed it, I was NOT disappointed!Well, the picture is simply OUTSTANDING--just beautiful. Sharpness, pretty colors--color hue and strength, overall ""newness"" to the look . . . this is how this movie should always have been.  You can see every bit of detail on each actor's face, and the fleshtones (and other colors) are exactly accurate.  It's incredible that this is a 1971 film; from the amazing blu ray picture quality, one wouldn't have guessed it (but perhaps for the clothing worn by the actors and Murray Head's hair length).  It has simply amazing picture quality and audio quality.  The audio is crystal-clear.In regards to the film/story/acting/script itself, I love it, always have, and frankly, I DON'T think it is ""dated."" On the contrary, it is quite fresh, to me. The dialog holds up perfectly today; let me correct that, it's far BETTER dialog than in today's films. The messages are still as relevant, the characters as compelling, the photography beautiful, the Mozart music playing at times just so melodic and pretty.  The three leads in the film do an outstanding job-- Glenda Jackson in an appropriately understated way, Peter Finch and Murray Head in their own ways (the latter two not overstated, but just right).A great story, it was very contemporary then AND now, and still completely relevant . . . this film has it all, to me, for a story of a love triangle involving a bi-sexual man (the ""good-looking"" one in the group, though all three are quite attractive). ""Dated""-- sorry, I just can't see it.Truly, if they made better movies than this today, I'd be so glad to watch them. Where are they?Perfectly mastered on Blu Ray?  YES!!GREAT job, Criterion, on this landmark film's transfer via beautiful Blu Ray remastering.

The subject is engaging, the screenplay and acting are outstanding, and the camera work is excellent. The performances by Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch keep one's attention throughout. If you watch this film more than once, and you will want to, you'll notice many wonderful details. The only weakness is probably the character of the young man (Murray Head). It's hard to understand what Jackson and Finch see in him, other than youth and a certain attractiveness. The secondary roles are well played - the telephone message service operator, Dr. Hirsh's patients, and the left-liberal parents who are overly permissive with their brood of precocious, loud, and obstreperous children. The atmosphere of the early 1970s gives this film character but does not make it out of date. The soundtrack in this DVD release has not been restored; you'll need to turn up the volume or lose some of the dialogue.

395241,AAV7I6CYFZ2DB,6304005962,Barry Eysman,"[11, 12]","This civilized movie, of autumnal sadness, is such an actors' film.Especially when those actors are Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson.It is a pleasure to watch them at their craft. John Schlesinger hasdirected Penelope Gilliatt's script with an eye for rich detail, andsuch seemingly minimal emotions of the leads that comes throughthe performances so perfectly, as delicately formed and precise assnowflakes. They feel deeply, do Daniel (Finch) and Alex(Jackson). Though they must not let on. It would be bad form to.That they both love Bob (Murray Head) seems a conundrum.  ButDaniel and Alex are of an age when there might be no one else,save Bob, who is one of those curious,  mercurial people who cango from person to person, without caring one bit, beginning,during, after. He literally feels nothing, save the rudimentary ( theword is full of them) but he is perhaps seen by Daniel and Alex  aswhat they want him to be. Such is love. They recreate him from hisvagueness. And of course they must not be jealous of Bob's otherlovers. Such as Bob always require that, and consider otherwise tobe so bloody selfish.He doesn't  intentionally hurt anyone. He uses people as things, so,to him, they are replaceable. When he is the replaceable one, if onlythey could see it. He is not worth their integrity, and intelligenceand complexity of heart. Yet, when one loves,  one cannot think ofhim or her without making them, perhaps, mythic. To someoneelse, they would be just another person, for others see them asordinary. This, the film explores with such finesse and grace.Daniel has a monologue, told to us personally, the words of whichare beautiful and touching, that just about rips your heart out. Finchadds to the words, so seemingly somewhat matter of factly sayingthem, ( a person has to comport themselves properly after all)though from deep inside, with such thought and honesty, andsearching still in these later years, and with no apology. You see theworth and goodness of the man most especially then. You want toput your arms around Daniel and Alex and hug them, for their loveis doomed, as they know too well. They are having to deal with theloss, the void, to reconcile themselves to it, even during Bob, andlearning how to get through the day, routinely, like everyone elsepretends to.""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" is a  film that one feels honored to see.

395242,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6304005962,C. B Collins Jr.,"[13, 13]","This is an excellent film about realistic adult relationships and the compromises we have to make to make relationships work. When the film was released in 1971 however the homosexuality certainly could overshadow the underlying complex but brutally honest story.I think the best way to review the film is to concentrate on the 3 main characters, all played so very well by a super cast.Alex, played by Glenda Jackson, is a business woman in her 40's having an affair with a bisexual artist, Bob, who is in his late 20's or early 30's. Bob leaves her at the first hint of conflict or trouble or confrontation to join his Jewish physician lover, Daniel, played by Peter Finch. Daniel asks for relatively little and offers an oasis of thought and tenderness for Bob.This seems to torture Alex so much that she can't stop from allowing her feelings of rejection and fear of abandonment from driving Bob off the next time they meet. Most telling is her conversation with her mother where she challenges her mother and father's relationship. The father is a cold multi-millionaire that long ago ceased to be involved in a passionate relationship with his wife. Alex's mother confronts her back that she expects to have ""it all' in a relationship and defends her marriage with 'you don't think it is anything but you are wrong."" Alex is extremely bright and verbal but in many ways a spoiled woman. Yet to be fair, how many people can share a lover?  It is possibly one of the most difficult tasks in the world for most and can be so traumatic that the constant worry destroys the relationship.Bob, the bi-sexual artists, does not have to commit to either Alex or Daniel or to anyone. He is handsome, young, talented, intelligent, and articulate. He is ambitious and sees clearly what he gets from both relationships. He doesn't have to commit so he doesn't.  Both lovers, Alex and Daniel, indulge him and adore him. From his perspective he realizes he does not have to choose between them and he enjoys various aspect of both of the relationships. Why should he make a choice? Does he stop seeing Daniel so that Alex will stop obsessing and fretting? I sympathized with Bob. He was indulged and pampered and knew it.Daniel, the Jewish physician, was superbly played by Peter Finch. This portrayal of a man living multiple identities was extra special. Daniel is the talented and dedicated physican who takes calls from patients night and day. He is wise and learned and compassionate. He listens to opera in a sophisticated garden home - serene and reflective. Yet he is fully engaged in the Jewish community in which he was reared. The scenes of his nephew's Bra Mitzvah convey his strong heritage and roots to the Jewish community. Daniel, more so that with Alex or Bob, conveys the concept of living different identities. Daniel recognizes he is part of the Jewish community, part of the medical community and the patients they see, and part of a same-gender loving community which exists more behind doors that in the open in 1971. Whereas Alex remains tortured most of the film, Daniel ends the film with a speech directly to the camera about the limitations of all relationships,the compromises we have to make in all relationships, and the responsibility to extract from each human experience as much joy and meaning as is possible.We have a choice in life, we can accept or reject compromise. Both paths have rewards and hardships. This is really the theme of the film.After 34 years, this film has retained its power, since its power resides in depiction of honest lives and honest situations.",5,An adult film in more ways than one.,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,3597,"['excellent', 'film', 'realistic', 'adult', 'relationships', 'compromises', 'have', 'make', 'make', 'relationships', 'work', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1971', 'however', 'homosexuality', 'certainly', 'could', 'overshadow', 'underlying', 'complex', 'brutally', 'honest', 'story.I', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'review', 'film', 'concentrate', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'super', 'cast.Alex', 'played', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'business', 'woman', '40', 'having', 'affair', 'bisexual', 'artist', 'Bob', 'who', 'late', '20', 'early', '30', 'Bob', 'first', 'hint', 'conflict', 'trouble', 'confrontation', 'join', 'Jewish', 'physician', 'lover', 'Daniel', 'played', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Daniel', 'relatively', 'little', 'oasis', 'thought', 'tenderness', 'Bob.This', 'torture', 'Alex', 'so', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'allowing', 'feelings', 'rejection', 'fear', 'abandonment', 'driving', 'Bob', 'next', 'time', 'meet', 'Most', 'telling', 'conversation', 'mother', 'where', 'mother', 'father', 'relationship', 'father', 'cold', 'multi-millionaire', 'long', 'ago', 'ceased', 'be', 'involved', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Alex', 'mother', 'back', 'have', 'relationship', 'marriage', ""'you"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'are', 'wrong', 'Alex', 'extremely', 'bright', 'verbal', 'many', 'ways', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'be', 'fair', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'share', 'lover', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'tasks', 'world', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'traumatic', 'constant', 'worry', 'relationship.Bob', 'bi-sexual', 'artists', 'not', 'have', 'commit', 'Alex', 'Daniel', 'anyone', 'handsome', 'young', 'talented', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'ambitious', 'clearly', 'what', 'relationships', ""n't"", 'have', 'commit', 'so', ""n't"", 'lovers', 'Alex', 'Daniel', 'adore', 'perspective', 'not', 'have', 'choose', 'various', 'aspect', 'relationships', 'Why', 'should', 'make', 'choice', 'stop', 'seeing', 'Daniel', 'Alex', 'will', 'stop', 'obsessing', 'fretting', 'sympathized', 'Bob', 'was', 'indulged', 'pampered', 'knew', 'it.Daniel', 'Jewish', 'physician', 'was', 'superbly', 'played', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'portrayal', 'man', 'living', 'multiple', 'identities', 'was', 'extra', 'special', 'Daniel', 'talented', 'dedicated', 'physican', 'who', 'calls', 'patients', 'night', 'day', 'wise', 'learned', 'compassionate', 'opera', 'sophisticated', 'garden', 'home', 'serene', 'reflective', 'fully', 'engaged', 'Jewish', 'community', 'was', 'reared', 'scenes', 'nephew', 'Bra', 'Mitzvah', 'convey', 'strong', 'heritage', 'roots', 'Jewish', 'community', 'Daniel', 'more', 'so', 'Alex', 'Bob', 'concept', 'living', 'different', 'identities', 'Daniel', 'part', 'Jewish', 'community', 'part', 'medical', 'community', 'patients', 'see', 'part', 'same-gender', 'loving', 'community', 'more', 'doors', 'open', '1971', 'Whereas', 'Alex', 'tortured', 'most', 'film', 'Daniel', 'film', 'speech', 'directly', 'camera', 'limitations', 'relationships', 'compromises', 'have', 'make', 'relationships', 'responsibility', 'extract', 'human', 'experience', 'much', 'joy', 'meaning', 'possible.We', 'have', 'choice', 'life', 'can', 'accept', 'reject', 'compromise', 'paths', 'have', 'rewards', 'hardships', 'really', 'theme', 'film.After', '34', 'years', 'film', 'retained', 'power', 'power', 'resides', 'depiction', 'honest', 'lives', 'honest', 'situations']",Sunday Bloody Sunday VHS

It tells the story of a free-spirited young bisexual artist (played by Head) and his simultaneous relationships with a female recruitment consultant (Jackson) and a male Jewish doctor (Finch).The film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality.

395244,A2GYCEAZYQ0ZUY,6304005962,Dr. Robert F. Knoll,"[1, 1]","&#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; (1971) is one of the best adult films in the truest sense of the term: a film for grownups. Peter Finch, who would win a posthumous make-up Oscar for &#34;Network (1976) and Glenda Jackson, in between her Academy Awards for &#34;Women in Love&#34; (1970) and &#34;A Touch of Class&#34; (1973), play the two feet of a romantic triangle whose apex is the bland beauty/conceptual artist played by Murray Head.Working from a brilliantly textured screenplay by Penelope Gilliatt, herself a film critic, this British film interweaves every scene and character into a commentary on contemporary relationships, especially marriage, or the lack thereof. Glenda Jackson's character is Alex Greville, a divorcee who is the only child of very comfortable but deeply unhappy parents.(Peggy Ashcroft brings a lifetime's worth of experience and skill to the small but telling role of the mother who has accepted her husband's indifference and financial preoccupations.) Alex works as a jobs counselor, in particular for a hard-to-place 50+ year old man with whom she has a one night stand. How she met the decade younger self absorbed artist whose &#34;affections&#34; and sexuality she shares with the middle-aged family doctor, Daniel Hirsh, played by Peter Finch, we never learn. Nor do we learn how the good doctor met the young man, although they have friends in common: the decidedly progressive parents of a brood of 5 children, the first 4 of whom have ready access to their parents' stash of pot and are spectators to their parents' bathing. It says everything that the chief family pet is a mastiff named Kenyatta.Director John Schlesinger came to prominence in the British cinema with such witty and penetrating portraits of the 1960's as &#34;Billy Liar&#34;(1963) and &#34;Darling&#34;(1965) and &#34;went Hollywood&#34; with his 1969 initially X-rated Oscar winner &#34;Midnight Cowboy&#34;. Here in the London of the new decade, Schlesinger is working well within his comfort zone. A gay artist who was the son of a doctor and a musician, one who knew from experience the world of aspirational upper middle class Jewish life, Schlesinger employs the music of Mozart very effectively to comment on his central triangular relationship and renders perhaps the perhaps the most realistic Bar Mitzvah ceremony and reception ever presented in an apolitical context. Every movement, gesture, line of dialogue and character helps to establish both Dr. Hirsh's family and cultural life and the fact that, while loving, he is a perennial outsider in his own world. Bob Elkin, the object of Daniel's misplaced affection, plays both his older lovers. While ostensibly loving freedom, he's off to America to pursue his career at the end of the film. Alex is left with his toucan, Daniel with Italian language records for a trip never taken.&#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; swept the BAFTA awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Editing, yet in spite of 4 major nominations, was kept at arm's length by the deeply conservative (American) Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While I can't quarrel with the choice of Jane Fonda as Best Actress for &#34;Klute&#34;, Peter Finch's deeply felt, extraordinarily intelligent and observant performance was both a landmark in a career that stretches back to &#34;The Nun's Story&#34; (1959) and the most sympathetic and genuine representation of a gay character on screen before Heath Ledger's tortured sheepherder (he's not a cowboy for the bulk of the movie, although he rides a horse) in &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34; (2005). Why then didn't Finch win? One guess is that Academy members weren't willing to accept a man on man kiss rendered with (seeming) affection and conviction. Thirty four years later, some of the same Academy members weren't ready to accept a highly suggestive if darkened rendering of gay sex in a tent involving Ledger and co-star Jake Gyllenhaal.With the wisdom of hindsight, &#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; and &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34; are much more worthy of re-viewing and re-consideration than either  &#34;The French Connection&#34; (1971) or &#34;Crash&#34;.(2005) The Schlesinger film is the one receiving the consummate care that comes with being a Criterion Blu-ray selection. The accompanying booklet satisfies both the casual viewer and the film scholar. The cinematography of Billy Williams and the mostly Mozartean score appeal to our eyes and ears. The authenticity of the performances and the continued relevance of the subject matter make &#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; as much a part of 2013 as it was of 1971.The one dated aspect of the film is technological. The characters rely on dial phones and an answering service, personified by silent screen star Bessie Love (1928 Best Actress nominee for &#34;Broadway Melody&#34;) in their attempts to communicate with each other. In today's smart phone/texting world, this seems laughable, but in 1971 such was the reality and the heightened frustrations of the three main characters caused by missed calls seem entirely

The idea is a fascinating one, and the screenplay examines and analyses the nature and limitations of this kind of love.It all sounds great, but there are definate problems in the execution.  Firstly, the film is long and somewhat slow-moving, which is a fairly minor complaint.  More importantly, the character with whom we are supposed to identify the most, and certainly the one with the most screen time, is Glenda Jackson's Alex, and she proves to be the most frustrating of the three.  Her possessive need to have Bob to herself is understandable as a concept, but Jackson fails to make it seem reasonable, and the character comes accross as selfish, especially as Peter Finch's Daniel seems to pose very little threat, and to be able to subsist on only occasional visits from the beloved Bob.  It's easy to see why Bob loves the older doctor, it is less apparant what he sees in Alex, who never seems to be much fun.

It is as mature an examination of love in all its aspects as any film that has been placed on the screen since.  The acting by an impeccable cast and the cinematography are first rate, but it is Schlesinger's sure hand that carved this story into our memories.Divorced workingwoman Alex (Glenda Jackson) and well-to-do Jewish family doctor Daniel Hirsh (Peter Finch) share not only the same answering service but also the sexual favors of the young handsome artist Bob Elkin (Murray Head) who bed-hops between them as the mood takes him. Both Alex and Dr Hirsh are aware of the other's existence but prefer to live with the situation rather than risk losing Elkin completely. But a wet winter weekend in London can be difficult. Exceptional cameo roles are filled by Peggy Ashcroft as the doctor's mother and by Richard Loncraine as Bob's partner and Jon Finch who manages to epitomize the London street hustler.There have been several films that have attempted to take on the matter of m&eacute;nage a trois tales but none has approached the subject of the complexities of romantic relationships with the style and aplomb achieved here.

It is directedly sensitively and beautifully by John Schlesinger, one of the finest British directors.  This is his follow up film to his incredible Midnight Cowboy, and he doesn't disappoint.  Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson are both in love (or so they think) with Murray Head.  This film depicts this love triangle not in a sleazy, comical way (like it would today), but as a deep, thoughtful, painful, and NORMAL thing, just like all relationships.  The film, as other reviewers have noted, depicted homosexuality as normal and not a big deal, which it is.  The relationships are sensitively handled, and Finch and Jackson give great performances.  Head gives a good performance, but some have questioned why his character inspires such passion in Jackson and Finch.  He's a rather bland character, but who knows the ways of love and/or desire.  I shudder on how this film might be made today, but luckily, I don't think they're going to remake this film anytime soon.

395249,A9I40WFF40R4,6304005962,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[36, 37]","For over thirty years SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY has remained one of my favorite movies. John Schlesinger may be my favorite director. I believe I own all his movies save one. So I probably cannot be objective about  either this movie or Mr. Schlesinger's greatness.I understood how my black students felt when they saw SOUNDER for the first time when I saw this movie on its release in 197l. ""At last here is a decent movie about us."" Not only was the movie about bisexual and gay relationships, but the characters were richly and complexly developed. In a word, believable. The plot is rather straight-forward-- the screen play is by Penelope Gilliatt--Alex played by Glenda Jackson is having an affair with Bob who is played by Murray Head who is having an affair also with Dr. Daniel Hirsch played by Peter Finch. Rod Steiger may have preempted Peter Finch and Murray Head with a  kiss on the lips between males in THE SERGEANT, but the kiss between Finch and Head here was certainly well ahead of its time.The movie is visually very beautiful and well put together. The film opens with a closeup of the hands of Dr. Finch who is examining an older male patient. We see similar scenes throughout the movie of closeups of both Jackson's hands as she makes love to Head and Finch's hands as well. Much is made of answering services and phone messages since Alex and Dr. Hirsch have to share Bob and often have to be satisfied with phone messages rather than him in the flesh. (We can all be thankful this movie was made years before the advent of mobile phones.)I had never heard before the otherwordly trio from Mozart's COSI FAN TUTTE, this beautiful aria that soars throughout the movie in the way much of Mozart does: just below the surface of joy there is the pain of human suffering, so appropriate for these two individuals who have to share someone they love with someone else.In 197l Schlesinger was so brave to make this movie, which holds up well after 30 years. His honesty and courage to speak the truth have meant so much to so many. At the end of SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY as Peter Finch muses over his less than satisfactory relationship with his friend and discusses whether half a loaf is better than nothing, he says something to the effect that ""I miss him."" Those of us who loved Schlesinger who just died on this day can say in all sincerity, we will miss this great artist.",5,One of Schlesinger's  Greatest Works!,1059091200,"07 25, 2003",2003,2387,"['thirty', 'years', 'SUNDAY', 'BLOODY', 'SUNDAY', 'remained', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'director', 'believe', 'own', 'movies', 'save', 'one', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'objective', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Schlesinger', 'greatness.I', 'understood', 'how', 'black', 'students', 'felt', 'when', 'saw', 'SOUNDER', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'release', '197l', 'last', 'here', 'decent', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'movie', 'bisexual', 'gay', 'relationships', 'characters', 'were', 'richly', 'complexly', 'developed', 'word', 'believable', 'plot', 'rather', 'straight-forward', 'screen', 'play', 'Penelope', 'Gilliatt', 'Alex', 'played', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'having', 'affair', 'Bob', 'who', 'played', 'Murray', 'Head', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'also', 'Dr.', 'Daniel', 'Hirsch', 'played', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'may', 'have', 'preempted', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Murray', 'Head', 'kiss', 'lips', 'males', 'THE', 'SERGEANT', 'kiss', 'Finch', 'Head', 'here', 'was', 'certainly', 'well', 'ahead', 'time.The', 'movie', 'visually', 'very', 'beautiful', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'closeup', 'hands', 'Dr.', 'Finch', 'who', 'examining', 'older', 'male', 'patient', 'see', 'similar', 'scenes', 'movie', 'closeups', 'Jackson', 'hands', 'love', 'Head', 'Finch', 'hands', 'well', 'Much', 'made', 'answering', 'services', 'phone', 'messages', 'Alex', 'Dr.', 'Hirsch', 'have', 'share', 'Bob', 'often', 'have', 'be', 'satisfied', 'phone', 'messages', 'rather', 'flesh', 'can', 'be', 'thankful', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'years', 'advent', 'mobile', 'phones', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'otherwordly', 'trio', 'Mozart', 'COSI', 'FAN', 'TUTTE', 'beautiful', 'aria', 'movie', 'way', 'much', 'Mozart', 'just', 'surface', 'joy', 'pain', 'human', 'suffering', 'so', 'appropriate', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'share', 'someone', 'love', 'someone', 'else.In', '197l', 'Schlesinger', 'was', 'so', 'brave', 'make', 'movie', 'up', 'well', '30', 'years', 'honesty', 'courage', 'speak', 'truth', 'have', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'end', 'SUNDAY', 'BLOODY', 'SUNDAY', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'relationship', 'friend', 'loaf', 'better', 'nothing', 'something', 'effect', 'miss', 'who', 'loved', 'Schlesinger', 'who', 'just', 'died', 'day', 'can', 'say', 'sincerity', 'will', 'miss', 'great', 'artist']",Sunday Bloody Sunday VHS
395250,A28G1AICORI6M5,6304005962,James S. Eisenberg,"[4, 5]","I have loved this film since it was first released in Canada. I saw it at a theatre on Yonge Street in Toronto at a Saturday matinee where the kiss between the two men started a mini-riot sparked by some teen-aged boys in the audience. They were probably expecting a gangster movie !I have over the years recommended the film, and loaned my VHS and DVD copies  to people younger than myself who universally seem to have the same reaction, ""It is so Seventies !"" Never mind that it is one of the best acted films of its decade, and that it unflinchingly examines complex relationships with an honesty and integrity that would not be equaled for many years. (Possibly until BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.)Essentially it is the tale of a complex triangle, one part straight, one part gay, where both relationships are going down the tubes simultaneously. The young man (Murray Head) at the center of both relationships is unaware of, or indifferent to, the hurt that he is causing his two lovers.The acting of Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch is superb. Jackson is subtle and fascinating throughout, and Finch reaches a heartbreaking integrity in his final little speech spoken directly to the audience. Murray Head is better as the young artist who ignites the passions of the two others than he was generally given credit for. You need to see both his allure and his indifference, and he handles this tricky dichotomy very well.Although it is very dark in mood much of the time, there are some sparks of humor, some of them provided by Bessie Love as a nosy operator at an answering service shared by the three protagonists. The children that are being babysat by Jackson and Head on the ""bloody"" weekend alluded to in the title, are a very smart observation of bright over-indulged children of the well educated upper-middle class. Jon Finch puts in a brief and disturbing appearance as a hustler that Finch has known sometime in his past.I seem to remember reading that the ""bar mitzvah"" reception scene in the film was the most expensive food scene ever in film up to that time because they had to keep re-shooting it. It too provides some humor when Finch is sat  down next to a recently divorced woman by his well intentioned and unaware family.The gorgeous terzetto from Mozart's opera COSI FAN TUTTE that provides the frequently repeated ""theme"" for the film is an ideal choice. An operatic scene with a gorgeous melody which is about benevolent farewellsprovides a moving sonic envelope for some of the most moving moments.Is the film 'too seventies !' I think not.

It seems that before the movie starts, both Alex (Glenda Jackson) and Daniel (Peter Finch) have agreed to this arrangement, no matter how uncomfortable it makes both of them. This makes for a superficially sophisticated, easy situation which is actually seething with emotion and frustration. Both of these people are rich in understanding, and seem as complete as a love-torn individual could be-- though Daniel easily has the more fulilling life (Alex is about to quit her job, and Daniel is an extremely competent doctor, whose feelings never interfere with his giving all his attention to his patients).When Bob, the young man, decides to leave for New York anyway (to further his own career, an because he IS feeling too much pressure from both of them), Daniel says ""it was better than nothing,"" while Alex says ""sometimes, nothing is better than something."" Is this a function of their belonging to two different sexes, or is one of them wrong, and the other one right?Also, it occurs to me that a person's being unable to commit himself to you might have nothing to do with you; it might simply be that it is the wrong time for him to commit himself to anyone.

395258,A2VXQL36IFQGKZ,6304005962,RALPH PETERS,"[58, 61]","While I concur with many of the reviews posted here, there is not enough praise bestowed on the sublime Glenda Jackson, who remains the great lost actress of her generation.  Though the recipient of two Oscars (&quot;Women In Love&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Class&quot;) and two other nominations (&quot;Sunday..&quot; and &quot;Hedda&quot;), as well as a criminal snub for the landmark &quot;Stevie&quot;, Ms. Jackson seems to be little remembered today.  It seems inconceivable now, since in the early Seventies, only Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave could be considered her equals.  For me, her Alex in &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot; is my favorite of her rich performances.  She is conflicted with her obviously unsatisfying affair with her bisexual (and, more importantly, shallow) lover, unfulfilled at her job, and basically adrift, just marking time in her life.  The simple, yet powerfully suggestive emotions Jackson offers do much to help us identify strongly with her character.  Who hasn't felt that, at times, their life is merely counting days, waiting for weekends which ironically do little to feed our spiritual or emotional needs?  And the pattern continues, which to me is what the somewhat cryptic title implies.  So much pressure is put on &quot;the weekends&quot; to make us happy that we can easily just wish our lives away, as Alex seems to.  Its hard to find the final straw which Alex finds to salvage her life and begin again without this crippling relationship, but Jackson's brilliantly layered performance is a wonder throughout.  Mr. Finch received many plaudits and is very respectable, but seems to be playing it safe here.  His Dr. Hirsch is supposed to be the emotional, reasonable center of the movie, but Finch is a bit too reserved; the events don't seem to really happen to him at all.  He stands curiously to the side, which may have been the author/director/actor's intent, but we don't have enough of the character's back-life for this to register.  Murray Head is simply a cipher, which is all that is required, but a pleasant one.  And any chance to see the divine Peggy Ashcroft and Bessie Love again is welcome.When this movie first came out, it had that wonderful aura that many of the pictures of that era did:  the essence of the forbidden--the promise that new and undiscovered worlds and situations would be examined that had never been dealt with in film before.  I remember the same feeling accompanying &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot;, and &quot;Women in Love&quot;, movies which have stood the test of time.  &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot;, though not without its flaws, has also held up.  Its a perfect time capsule of a certain period of time and change for working-class Londoners still woozy from the Sixties and not anywhere near ready for what would be the Eighties.  Its also a remarkable document of a brilliant actress at the height of her estimable powers.

We see two middle aged, upper class intellectuals (Alex and Daniel) both deeply in love with the same person.  The object of their love is young, handsome and talented young man who is also unintentionally cruel to them both.  By sharing his love with male and female lover(s) he is torturing them with uncertainty of his commitment to either one of them.  His doe like eyes and agreeable demeanor is so sweet that neither one of his lovers can truly get angry with him since he seems, in his undecisiveness, to float amongst them almost as air.  While both of his lovers know about each other's existence they seem to tolerate it in some naive form of belief that their patience, love and tolerance will tip the young man in one way or the other.  Both are wise and middle aged and they know that their amorous choices at this point of their lives are limited.  They are fortunate with a little bit of happiness in their life that is brought by this carefree individual. But life is not a sum of happy parts -- it is far more complicated that that.  And any time complications seem to surround them:  large family with lots of children, responsibilities both professional and personal, friend's arguments, young Bob (Murray Head)  seems to withdraw himself from either one of them as if there is a world somewhere far, far away (like America for example) where everything is simpler, or bigger, or better, or easier.  And as their young lover leaves them both - his female companion with his pet parrot and her realization that she will remain alone, eternally free and unattached from the quarters of a safe marriage; and his male lover alone with his tapes of italian language practice excercises, and coming to terms of his own homosexuality and aloneness that comes with it, we start to fully appreciate the complications of our lives and compromises we are willing to make as human beings to fulfill our basic need for love and acceptance by people we care for the most, no matter what the (emotional) price we have to pay.  Truly artistic movie with all of its complexity.  Probably one of the best performances I have seen.

395260,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6304005962,Simon Davis,"[2, 2]","""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" starring Glenda Jackson, Peter Finch and Murray Head was a truly groundbreaking film in so many ways when it was released in 1971. It takes a totally different slant on the examination of what relationships are between men and women than what audiences had seen before. The film was also remarkable by the intelligent way it depicted a relationship between two men as being both natural and loving at a time when  gays, if they were even depicted at all on screen, were usually portrayed either as psycho's or degenerates or as effeminate objects of ridicule. The film portrays a highly sophisticated romantic triangle played out by the three main characters, a mature Jewish doctor and his younger artist partner who in turn shares his time with an older woman who works as a Employment Consutant. Three average people all with their needs, complexities and vulnerabilities beautifully played out by the three leads. The acting especially from Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch as the two people who must share the man they both love is a tour de force and both totally deserved the Academy Award nominations they received. Glenda Jackson's beautifully modulated performance only heightens the real sense of loss lovers of well acted cinema have in her having left films for a career in politics. It truly is one of her best performances right up their with her outstanding  work in ""Women in Love"" the ""Elizabeth R"" mini series ""A Touch of Class"" and ""Stevie"". The films non sensational treatment of homosexuality makes it an important  piece of film making that can still nevertheless be appreciated by all types of audiences, gay or straight. The film's examination of love between ordinary people with all their joys and pains gives ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" an almost timeless quality relevant to any age and it's a piece of cinema that I find myself enjoying more each time I view it.",5,Superb Mature Examination Of Adult Relationships Starring A Sublime Glenda Jackson,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,1908,"['Sunday', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'starring', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Murray', 'Head', 'was', 'truly', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1971', 'totally', 'different', 'slant', 'examination', 'what', 'relationships', 'are', 'men', 'women', 'what', 'audiences', 'had', 'seen', 'before', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'remarkable', 'intelligent', 'way', 'depicted', 'relationship', 'two', 'men', 'being', 'natural', 'loving', 'time', 'when', 'gays', 'were', 'even', 'depicted', 'screen', 'were', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'psycho', 'effeminate', 'objects', 'ridicule', 'film', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'played', 'out', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'mature', 'Jewish', 'doctor', 'younger', 'artist', 'partner', 'who', 'turn', 'shares', 'time', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'Employment', 'Consutant', 'Three', 'average', 'people', 'needs', 'complexities', 'vulnerabilities', 'beautifully', 'played', 'out', 'three', 'leads', 'acting', 'especially', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'must', 'share', 'man', 'love', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'totally', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'received', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'beautifully', 'modulated', 'performance', 'only', 'real', 'sense', 'loss', 'lovers', 'well', 'acted', 'cinema', 'have', 'having', 'left', 'films', 'career', 'politics', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'right', 'up', 'outstanding', 'work', 'Women', 'Love', 'Elizabeth', 'R', 'mini', 'series', 'A', 'Touch', 'Class', 'Stevie', 'films', 'non', 'sensational', 'treatment', 'homosexuality', 'important', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'can', 'still', 'nevertheless', 'be', 'appreciated', 'types', 'audiences', 'gay', 'straight', 'film', 'examination', 'love', 'ordinary', 'people', 'joys', 'Sunday', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'almost', 'timeless', 'quality', 'relevant', 'age', 'piece', 'cinema', 'find', 'enjoying', 'more', 'time', 'view']",Sunday Bloody Sunday VHS
395261,A3CE57YNGVWBQN,6304005962,"Tom S. ""filmfan3""","[8, 8]","Alex (Glenda Jackson) loves Bob (Murray Head). Daniel (Peter Finch) loves Bob, too. Bob loves both of them...sort of. This is the delicate situation for three people in London at the end of the ""swingin' sixties."" John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy,The Day of the Locust) and screenwriter Penelope Gilliatt explored new territory with this 1971 film, and the result is very powerful. This quiet, clear-eyed portrait of two lonely, middle-aged Londoners reaching out for companionship--with the same beautiful but callous young man--is one of the most moving films I've ever seen.Academy Award winners Jackson (Women in Love) and Finch (Network) have never been better than they are here. Both of them simply command the screen, especially in their difficult monologues and in the brutal close-ups of their sad, stricken faces. The film's sense of time and place is vivid--the bleak residential streets of London, where solitude is an ordeal to be endured and unrequited love makes every day seem like ""bloody"" Sunday, the loneliest day of the week. The supporting cast is excellent, including Oscar winner Peggy Ashcroft (A Passage To India) as Jackson's concerned mother and Jon Finch (Macbeth,Frenzy) in a brief appearance as a street hustler.Schlesinger carefully kept the tone realistic and unsensational, yet the film caused a bit of a sensation, anyway. I saw it in a theater when it was first released, and I can still recall the gasps and nervous fidgeting of my fellow moviegoers, particularly during the more intimate scenes between the two men. Quite a few people got up and walked out, too. It may be difficult for young people of today to understand, but such things simply weren't discussed in public in those days, not in a major film with major stars. This was a groundbreaking event, and it was rewarded for its daring with 4 Oscar nominations and a slew of international awards.I'm glad the Criterion Collection has decided to give SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY the deluxe treatment. The 2003 MGM DVD release was okay, but the new Criterion package has a remastered print; interviews with Schlesinger, Murray Head, and others; and a booklet with essays by Ms. Gilliatt and cultural historian Ian Buruma. It's a suitable tribute to one of the finest films of the 1970s.

395262,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6304005962,Westley,"[2, 3]","""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" was one of the most acclaimed adult dramas of the early 70s, and one of the first major films to address gay relationships.  Murray Head stars as a young hippie in simultaneous relationships with physician Peter Finch and businesswoman Glenda Jackson.  Finch and Jackson know about each other, and they even share some mutual acquaintances.  Needless to say, even though Finch and Jackson are completely enamored of the young man, they're also both frustrated with his inability to give more or commit himself.  The film explores these relationships over a tumultuous week.The film was directed by John Schlesinger as his follow-up to the Oscar-winning ""Midnight Cowboy.""  It's a solid drama of obvious interest for its early, relatively non-judgmental depiction of a gay relationship.  Of note, the relationships are handled with sensitivity but are also interesting and complex.  The Penelope Gilliatt-penned script (her only film) is top-notch and received numerous awards (National Society of Film Critics, Writers Guild of America) as well as an Oscar nomination.Finch and Jackson turn in very good performances, which were rewarded with Oscar nominations.  Although Murray Head's performance is often criticized for being bland, I think that his cipher-like qualities works well here; you're not supposed to fully understand exactly what Jackson or Finch see in him.  Although it's reflective of its era, the film holds up fairly well.  Overall, ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" is an interesting exploration of adult relationships - straight or gay.",4,Interesting British Drama,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,1571,"['Sunday', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'adult', 'dramas', 'early', '70s', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'films', 'address', 'gay', 'relationships', 'Murray', 'Head', 'young', 'hippie', 'simultaneous', 'relationships', 'physician', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'businesswoman', 'Glenda', 'Jackson', 'Finch', 'Jackson', 'know', 'other', 'even', 'share', 'mutual', 'acquaintances', 'Needless', 'say', 'even', 'Finch', 'Jackson', 'are', 'completely', 'enamored', 'young', 'man', ""'re"", 'also', 'frustrated', 'inability', 'give', 'more', 'commit', 'film', 'relationships', 'tumultuous', 'week.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'follow-up', 'Oscar-winning', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'solid', 'drama', 'obvious', 'interest', 'early', 'relatively', 'non-judgmental', 'depiction', 'gay', 'relationship', 'note', 'relationships', 'are', 'handled', 'sensitivity', 'are', 'also', 'interesting', 'complex', 'Penelope', 'Gilliatt-penned', 'script', 'only', 'film', 'top-notch', 'received', 'numerous', 'awards', 'National', 'Society', 'Film', 'Critics', 'Writers', 'Guild', 'America', 'as', 'well', 'Oscar', 'nomination.Finch', 'Jackson', 'turn', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'were', 'rewarded', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Murray', 'Head', 'performance', 'often', 'criticized', 'being', 'bland', 'think', 'cipher-like', 'qualities', 'well', 'here', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'fully', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'Jackson', 'Finch', 'see', 'reflective', 'era', 'film', 'up', 'fairly', 'well', 'Overall', 'Sunday', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'adult', 'relationships', 'straight', 'gay']",Sunday Bloody Sunday VHS
