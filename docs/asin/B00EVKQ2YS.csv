1669567,A56Y0L9B6L6YZ,B00EVKQ2YS,judith d rhodes,"[0, 1]","I had wanted to see this film. i was hoping it wold not be another formulaic lesbian movie. It was not and I was very happy about that. This is a great, thoughtful film that looks not just at lesbians in romantic situations but at people in normal situations of daily life. It examines how things and people are often not what they seem and the lies they tell themselves and each other in order to maintain the lives they have created when full disclosure is no longer an option. And the story is told with an honest, candid voice that made it that much more credible. The couple who employ the title character are feckless, shallow yuppies whose identity is more tightly tied to their suburban home than to any moral compass. In contrast the title character is a hardworking person whose status as an undocumented person serves as the backdrop for her struggle to live up to her own moral and ethical standards. As the finances of the family she lives with unravels we get a glimpse into the hypocrisy that is often the price of affluence-real or perceived. That's a tall order for a dramedy but this film pulls it off by letting the characters various stories be what they are-complicated, compromised and riddled with contradictions. And yet interspersed with genuine love and affection. just like real life. The ending was a tinsy bit sappy but I could not fault them for that. All in all a very lovely film I will watch again.",5,"Great product condition, great movie",1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,1431,"['had', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'i', 'was', 'hoping', 'wold', 'not', 'be', 'formulaic', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'great', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'lesbians', 'romantic', 'situations', 'people', 'normal', 'situations', 'daily', 'life', 'how', 'things', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'lies', 'tell', 'other', 'order', 'maintain', 'lives', 'have', 'created', 'when', 'full', 'disclosure', 'no', 'longer', 'option', 'story', 'told', 'honest', 'candid', 'voice', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'credible', 'couple', 'who', 'title', 'character', 'are', 'feckless', 'shallow', 'yuppies', 'identity', 'more', 'tightly', 'tied', 'suburban', 'home', 'moral', 'compass', 'contrast', 'title', 'character', 'hardworking', 'person', 'status', 'undocumented', 'person', 'serves', 'backdrop', 'struggle', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'moral', 'ethical', 'standards', 'finances', 'family', 'unravels', 'get', 'glimpse', 'hypocrisy', 'often', 'price', 'affluence-real', 'perceived', 'tall', 'order', 'dramedy', 'film', 'off', 'letting', 'characters', 'various', 'stories', 'be', 'what', 'are-complicated', 'compromised', 'riddled', 'contradictions', 'yet', 'interspersed', 'genuine', 'love', 'affection', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'ending', 'was', 'tinsy', 'bit', 'sappy', 'could', 'not', 'fault', 'very', 'lovely', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",Margarita

Here you find a great story competent actors and a charismatic lead actress.  What a delight to find a story where the main character is a lesbian, but the story involves so many more issues.  Margarita is an illegal immigrant in Canada and the family  she has worked for are letting her go after 6 years, so she need to get married or be deported.  This dilemma she faces gives rise to both dramatic and comedic plot development which is very satisfyingly resolved.

She has been with them a number of years and seems to do everything for them as well as being the daughter&#8217;s best friend, teacher and confidante. She is also a lesbian and has a girlfriend who seems to want to keep her at arms length outside of their physical relationship. Well the couple Ben and Gail have had a run of bad luck in the cash flow department. A string of bad investments and bad career choices has left them financially embarrassed.Well they have to make cutbacks and so they have to think the unthinkable and &#8216;let Margarita go&#8217;. Margarita, meanwhile, has spotted the slide in their fortunes and has been doing economy measures for some time, as well as fixing computes, mending the gutter, clearing the drive and servicing the hot tub &#8211; she is also drop dead gorgeous. Well once they have told her that she has to go the consequences for everyone become very apparent, very quick &#8211; and that&#8217;s when they find out she is also an illegal immigrant.This is just a wonderful film, Nicola Correia Damude (&#8217;Havana 57&#8217;) as Margarita is sensational but a special word has to be said for Patrick McKenna as Ben who is marvellous, funny, and an all round entertainer who you can&#8217;t help feeling sorry for him even when he is trying to fire Margarita. Everyone is great in this and the direction is excellent from Dominique Cardona and Laurie Colbert they worked together before on &#8216;Finn&#8217;s Girl&#8217; so they knew they could deliver and deliver they have in absolute spades.
