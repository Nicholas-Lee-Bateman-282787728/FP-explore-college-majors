I have seen about 30eps fansubbed, and refuse to watch the Cartoon Network dubbed version. Though some might not quite get how the main character is dead from the start, it all works out. ^.^()For the boys there's plenty of fighting, cursing, and some cute girl characters. For the girls, there's Kurama. He's a nice, polite, foxy (literally ^.^) bishonen. Oh yeah, and he still kicks butt - he just does it with roses.Oh, and there's the one known as the ""Vegeta-wannabe"", Hiei. He's a fire demon with a big attitude problem.And behind all the fights and tournaments each character's heart breaking past is shown. It's a little like DBZ - but the fights aren't as long and are certainly much cooler. And the style is more pleasing to the girls fans use to, say, Sailor Moon or Card Captors.",4,"Well, the series is great!",1017964800,"04 5, 2002",2002,882,"[""'m"", 'really', 'praying', 'American', 'release', 'up', 'greatness', 'YYH', 'great', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', '30eps', 'fansubbed', 'refuse', 'watch', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'dubbed', 'version', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'dead', 'start', 'out', '^.^', 'boys', 'plenty', 'fighting', 'cursing', 'cute', 'girl', 'characters', 'girls', 'Kurama', 'nice', 'polite', 'foxy', 'literally', '^.^', 'bishonen', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'still', 'butt', 'just', 'roses.Oh', 'one', 'known', 'Vegeta-wannabe', 'Hiei', 'fire', 'demon', 'big', 'attitude', 'problem.And', 'fights', 'tournaments', 'character', 'heart', 'breaking', 'past', 'shown', 'little', 'DBZ', 'fights', 'are', ""n't"", 'long', 'are', 'certainly', 'much', 'cooler', 'style', 'more', 'pleasing', 'girls', 'fans', 'use', 'say', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Card', 'Captors']","Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files - Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found"

I have been missing out for years not knowing about this great anime series. This is my only and first Yu Yu Hakusho DVD that I saw and it was the MOST entertaining anime that I had ever seen! This is one of the best or possibly THE BEST anime out there. You might not agree but if you take the time a look at this anime series, you will know what I exactly mean. This anime has a great story line. It's about a 14 year boy (forgot the name because I only had it for two days) who dies trying to save a kid from a car. Later, he realizes that he had became a ghost and has to do good in order to come back to life. I'm not going to go too much into the story. I thought the idea was great and the execution was even better. I only saw it four times but I really enjoyed it. At first, it was kind of hard to understand the story but after the second time, I started to get the story. You know, it's funny how those Japanese people come up with those crazy ideas for catoons and games (Prince of Mononoke, Spirited Away, Dragonball Z, Inu Yasha, Arc the Lad, Ranma, Street Fighters, Silent Hill, and Clock Tower just to name a few)  but this one is just totally amazing. I didn't enjoy an anime this mush since the first Pokemon days (after the Pokemon Journey, it got wierd). Well, at least now I know about Yu Yu Hakusho and I'm going to try to get all the DVD. I definitly recommend it and even though my review wasn't helpful, you should try renting it from a library, Hollywood Videos, or Blockbuster and then say something about my review.",5,Pissed #1 fan of Yu Yu Hakusho !,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,1614,"['am', 'pissed', 'not', 'knowing', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'March', '27', '2004', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'out', 'years', 'not', 'knowing', 'great', 'anime', 'series', 'only', 'first', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'DVD', 'saw', 'was', 'MOST', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'best', 'possibly', 'BEST', 'anime', 'there', 'might', 'not', 'agree', 'take', 'time', 'look', 'anime', 'series', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'mean', 'anime', 'great', 'story', 'line', '14', 'year', 'boy', 'name', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'days', 'who', 'trying', 'save', 'kid', 'car', 'Later', 'had', 'became', 'ghost', 'do', 'good', 'order', 'come', 'back', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'thought', 'idea', 'was', 'great', 'execution', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'only', 'saw', 'four', 'times', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'was', 'kind', 'hard', 'understand', 'story', 'second', 'time', 'started', 'get', 'story', 'know', 'funny', 'how', 'Japanese', 'people', 'come', 'up', 'crazy', 'ideas', 'catoons', 'games', 'Prince', 'Mononoke', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'Arc', 'Lad', 'Ranma', 'Street', 'Fighters', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Clock', 'Tower', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'one', 'just', 'totally', 'amazing', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'anime', 'mush', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'days', 'Pokemon', 'Journey', 'got', 'wierd', 'Well', 'least', 'now', 'know', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'get', 'DVD', 'definitly', 'recommend', 'even', 'review', 'was', ""n't"", 'helpful', 'should', 'try', 'renting', 'library', 'Hollywood', 'Videos', 'Blockbuster', 'then', 'say', 'something', 'review']","Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files - Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found"
681252,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005T30G,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Life is hard, and then you die. If you're unlucky, like Yusuke Urameshi, then life gets harder AFTER you die.In fact, death is only the beginning of his troubles in ""Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found,"" which collects the first four episodes of this classic anime. The first few episodes are a bit difficult to get into, since the whole concept is being built up here (seriously, a whole episode about Kuwabara's schoolwork?), but it promises to get more entertaining later on.Despite a reputation as a hardened rebel, Yusuke was killed knocking a toddler from the path of a moving car. Turns out the afterlife, aka Spirit World, didn't expect such a selfless act -- so Spirit World's toddler ruler Koenma offers him a second chance at life, with the help of the sprightly Grim Reaper Botan, an oar-riding girl who tries to keep Yusuke on the straight and narrow.Initially, Yusuke refuses. But after seeing how the people around him are responding to his death -- including his rival Kuwabara and semi-girlfriend Keiko -- he agrees. But that's a lot easier said than done, since Koenma says he will have to hatch a Spirit Beast, which will be nurtured by his good intentions. But those good intentions involve plenty of danger -- including helping out Kuwabara, and trying to save his own body from a raging fire that might just kill him. As in, all the way-dead, to quote Miracle Max.""Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found"" is basically about setting up the premise of the entire TV show, and introducing about half of the main characters. Not to mention the funny concept of the afterlife, which is basically a giant office ruled by a toddler, with hordes of overworked cubicle ogres running around trying to deal with the phone calls and paperwork.It's the sort of thing that makes you want to live forever, especially if you've lived ""Office Space.""And the plot starts off rather slowly, since the first half is essentially all about Yusuke floating around yelling at people, occasionally possessing Kuwabara (resulting in much trouble for them both) and helping the big friendly lug with his homework. For an action series, the non-comedic action is sparse. But things tighten up in the fourth episode, where Yusuke is forced to make a terrible decision -- his life, or the girl he adores. Guess what choice he makes.It takes a little while to warm up to Yusuke, since he seems like a rebel without a cause despite his alcoholic single mum. But he becomes more likable as it's shown that he has a good heart underneath his tough-guy attitude. His thuggish-looking classmate Kuwabara makes an unexpected ally, since he turns out to have some very convenient psychic powers (or ""the tickle"" as he calls it), and Keiko is a suitably feisty love interest for Yusuke.""Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke Lost Yusuke Found"" is a rather bland opening for his classic anime series, but the good news is that it picks up considerably after this. And it's a necessary glimpse of the world it takes place in.",3,Fight for your life,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,2997,"['Life', 'hard', 'then', 'die', ""'re"", 'unlucky', 'Yusuke', 'Urameshi', 'then', 'life', 'harder', 'AFTER', 'die.In', 'fact', 'death', 'only', 'beginning', 'troubles', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'Yusuke', 'Lost', 'Yusuke', 'Found', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'classic', 'anime', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'difficult', 'get', 'whole', 'concept', 'being', 'built', 'up', 'here', 'seriously', 'whole', 'episode', 'Kuwabara', 'schoolwork', 'get', 'more', 'entertaining', 'later', 'on.Despite', 'reputation', 'hardened', 'rebel', 'Yusuke', 'was', 'killed', 'knocking', 'toddler', 'path', 'moving', 'car', 'out', 'afterlife', 'aka', 'Spirit', 'World', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'such', 'selfless', 'act', 'so', 'Spirit', 'World', 'toddler', 'ruler', 'Koenma', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'help', 'sprightly', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Botan', 'oar-riding', 'girl', 'who', 'keep', 'Yusuke', 'straight', 'narrow.Initially', 'Yusuke', 'seeing', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'responding', 'death', 'including', 'rival', 'Kuwabara', 'semi-girlfriend', 'Keiko', 'lot', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'Koenma', 'will', 'have', 'hatch', 'Spirit', 'Beast', 'will', 'be', 'nurtured', 'good', 'intentions', 'good', 'intentions', 'involve', 'plenty', 'danger', 'including', 'helping', 'out', 'Kuwabara', 'trying', 'save', 'own', 'body', 'raging', 'fire', 'might', 'just', 'kill', 'way-dead', 'quote', 'Miracle', 'Max', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'Yusuke', 'Lost', 'Yusuke', 'Found', 'basically', 'setting', 'up', 'premise', 'entire', 'TV', 'show', 'introducing', 'half', 'main', 'characters', 'Not', 'mention', 'funny', 'concept', 'afterlife', 'basically', 'giant', 'office', 'ruled', 'toddler', 'hordes', 'overworked', 'cubicle', 'ogres', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'deal', 'phone', 'calls', 'paperwork.It', 'sort', 'thing', 'want', 'live', 'forever', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Office', 'Space', 'plot', 'rather', 'slowly', 'first', 'half', 'essentially', 'Yusuke', 'floating', 'around', 'yelling', 'people', 'occasionally', 'possessing', 'Kuwabara', 'resulting', 'much', 'trouble', 'helping', 'big', 'friendly', 'lug', 'homework', 'action', 'series', 'non-comedic', 'action', 'sparse', 'things', 'tighten', 'up', 'fourth', 'episode', 'where', 'Yusuke', 'forced', 'make', 'terrible', 'decision', 'life', 'girl', 'Guess', 'what', 'choice', 'little', 'warm', 'up', 'Yusuke', 'rebel', 'cause', 'alcoholic', 'single', 'mum', 'more', 'likable', 'shown', 'good', 'heart', 'tough-guy', 'attitude', 'thuggish-looking', 'classmate', 'Kuwabara', 'unexpected', 'ally', 'out', 'have', 'very', 'convenient', 'psychic', 'powers', 'tickle', 'Keiko', 'suitably', 'feisty', 'love', 'interest', 'Yusuke', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'Yusuke', 'Lost', 'Yusuke', 'Found', 'rather', 'bland', 'opening', 'classic', 'anime', 'series', 'good', 'news', 'up', 'considerably', 'necessary', 'glimpse', 'world', 'place']","Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files - Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found"

It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time.

In early 2002, or so, I believe it was, maybe 2001, this show was aired on Adult Swim and Toonami, and though, they only showed 20 something episodes back then, they started showing up to the Dark Tournament sometime in 2004, I believe, maybe started mid 2003, but... Lol, my memory is fading, it seems. Anyway... I saw that they were releasing the Import boxset in English on a website, and so I bought 2 sets of it, containing episodes: 1-50 on 6 discs (uncut), which was great, but... It didn't end the Dark Tournament, then, back in 2004, they released a 3rd boxset, containing episodes: 51-78, which ended the Dark Tournament, and started the Chapter Black Saga. After witnessing all of the Dark Tournament, which is my favorite Saga in the Series, I REALLY began to love this show A LOT. I liked it before, but far from how much I love it now. At any rate, the Series' Storyline is superb, and the action is grand. So, the bottom line is: if you like action Anime, but not brainless, no reason violence, with an excellent Storyline, then, I suggest you give this Anime a try. T-O-G-U-R-O; Toguro, yes, Toguro.
