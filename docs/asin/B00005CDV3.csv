I must admit I was initially put off on the first episode, as I was absolutely in love with Stephen Moyer who played the original Stephen Bannerman; I just could not warm up to the new actor Ifan Meredith. Also, Ruth Manning Bannerman is also played by a different, less enjoyable actress.However, despite the travesty in the replacement of these two parts, The Grand-Series 2 offers just as much as the first season in terms of performance, drama, storylines, and overall production values. I found myself quite addicted to the series all over again.The end of the tenth-and last-episode made me feel quite sad that my ""stay"" at The Grand Hotel was over, although I agree with one reviewer who said that just about every possible story line had been explored.

While the first series managed to feel like drama rather than soap opera, the second dives wholeheartedly into the soapsuds and becomes more episodic. Some characters even seem to act in ways inconsistent with their previous actions. It almost feels as if a new production team had taken over, although that's not the case.Luckily, the second series hits its stride with the fourth episode and, for the most part, sustains it until almost the very end (with some nifty surprises and plot twists along the way). There's some very enjoyable writing throughout -- great credit goes to Russell T. Davies for staying true to his period and not trying to impose modern sensibilities on his characters.For example, the character who reveals his gayness is utterly confused and conflicted in a way that seems consistent for an uneducated worker in 1920s Britain; his self-hatred and seemingly unresolvable sense of isolation are never glossed over.By the end of the second series, it becomes clear, though, why there were only two series of &quot;The Grand.&quot; Just about every avenue of development had been explored and there was little ground left to cover with the characters.

The characters themselves were taken straight out of other better done series:  the returning damaged alcoholic son from the war, the lively saucy maid would gets in trouble, the straight and true maid who tries to keep everyone in line,  the bored daughter who identifies with the help more than the upper class, the crusty housekeeper with heart of gold all straight out of Upstairs/Downstairs.. oh god. it was horrible.  Upstairs/Downstairs set in a hotel with a smidgen of budget to do it.Even the basic comportment of the actors lacked even the most crude training in how to hold their bodies to match the rigid class training every lady and gentleman would have had at the time... it was like watching a local amatuer playhouse put on a show.

Mrs. Marcus Bannerman character has definitely lost it's penchant for resolve in destruction around her.  She seems now more broken and unstable than calculating and manipulative and I personally liked her better as calculating.  There is an attempt to present a change, social most of all. Homosexuality, women's fight for equality (aging upper class ladies wearing pants) and the unscrupulous fight over wealth and power.  At certain moments, it almost feels like drag to watch mockery of the presumably romantic relationships of many of the couples.

There is something about knowing that a series is about to end that prevents you from enjoying it completely. This is how I felt about the second season.I felt the characters were all well represented, the issues facing each character real and poignant. At times, I couldn't tear my eyes away! In particular, I enjoyed the episodes with Miss Harkness (the ex-Madame), returning to her old business, and the episode with the maids going on the beach 'outing' was fun. I did get bored with the 'baby-buying episodes.' Surely in postwar England, there would be plenty of orphanages and places for women to buy children legitimately without resorting to such melodrama! I also felt sorry for Marcus' wife. Years of abuse at the hands of her grandmother and then Marcus had produced its tole on her. Somehow, I wish she could be redeemed.Overall, an excellent series. A must for fans fo Upstairs Downstairs and similar dramas.",5,Grand Fun!!!,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,999,"['loved', 'Grand', 'Series', 'was', 'sadness', 'viewed', 'series', '2', 'something', 'knowing', 'series', 'end', 'prevents', 'enjoying', 'completely', 'how', 'felt', 'second', 'season.I', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'represented', 'issues', 'facing', 'character', 'real', 'poignant', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'tear', 'eyes', 'away', 'particular', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'Miss', 'Harkness', 'ex-Madame', 'returning', 'old', 'business', 'episode', 'maids', 'going', 'beach', ""'outing"", 'was', 'fun', 'did', 'get', 'bored', ""'baby-buying"", 'episodes', 'Surely', 'postwar', 'England', 'would', 'be', 'plenty', 'orphanages', 'places', 'women', 'buy', 'children', 'legitimately', 'resorting', 'such', 'melodrama', 'also', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Marcus', 'wife', 'Years', 'abuse', 'hands', 'grandmother', 'then', 'Marcus', 'had', 'produced', 'tole', 'Somehow', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'redeemed.Overall', 'excellent', 'series', 'must', 'fans', 'fo', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'similar', 'dramas']",N/A

The Grand is like a polished, beautiful apple that appears as if it will be a tasty and delicious treat.When we cut into the apple, we find that it is bruised, sour, and pithy, with a greedy worm dominating the dwelling.In the case of The Grand, the physical restoration of the hotel has restored the appeal and glitter to the building.The people who walk through the front door open each chapter to a unique situation, they determine the ebband flow of the story. I recommend this series to anyone who gets great pleasure from viewing other Britishseries.
