1140753,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B0013D8L8Q,A Forest Fan,"[2, 2]","Having Ernest Borgnine (The Wild Bunch) and Bruce Boxleitner (Babylon 5) together on-screen is a treat. Thank goodness the rest of the cast is just as good in this surprisingly vicious and bloody western. Jack Noseworthy has a lot of good scenes as the railroad surveyor trying to bring the Wild West into the Gilded Age (shades of Gene Hackman in Unforgiven). Casper Van Dien takes the reins as the leading man, with Jeff Kober gleefully shooting everything in sight. (Sadly, he has no sympathy for his tired stooges, who have to bury all the innocent folk he pointlessly dispatches.)Women don't have much to do in this production, but that is the western tradition and the director doesn't want to mess with that. The giant climactic battle has a number of great surprises near the end, including a big surprise as to who gets the final shot in the battle. The title of the movie is explained by Boxleiter's character during the movie, and will be familiar to viewers of the Deadwood television series.This is a true western in the grandest Hollywood tradition, with modern bloodshed that would make Jason Statham wilt. A great way to spend an evening, as Ernest Borgnine rides off into the sunset.

The problem with the film is that the screenplay seems to not focus enough on the redemption of the main character. The main character Luke, was a gunfighter who used to ride with a gang and he eventually left after a massacre they committed. The film instead focus almost entirely on the villains and their murders of the families who refused to leave their land because of the railroad, this was wicked distracting and made me extremely uncomfortable. When the main character Luke, played by Casper Van Dein, came onto the screen, it seemed to me that all of his scenes were small and they disappeared quickly.

Roberts ""Film Historian""","[4, 4]","This above-average but violent made-for-television western pits the villainous land-hungry railroad against the defenseless, small-time ranchers whose lands lay on the route sought by the railroad.  Stuntman/action director Craig R. Baxley helms this exciting B-movie horse opera with flaw to spare. The color photography constantly thrusts you into the thick of the gunfire and the handheld camera work lends a versimilitude to the action that enhances this oater. Casper Van Dien is actually tolerable for a change and the beard gives him a lot of maturity.  Late in the action, he puts on a poncho and vaguely resembles Clint Eastwood. Basically, Van Dien plays a gunslinger who has tried to hang up his six-gun and reform himself. Naturally, the villains compel him to strap on his hog-leg one more time. The sturdy cast includes Bruce Boxleitner as a believable gunfighter.  Ernest Borgnine of THE WILD BUNCH plays one of the chief ranchers that the railroad has been harassing about his land.  ""Sugarland Express"" star William Atherton is an unscrupulous local railroad official who has no qualms against killing to make a point. Of course, the devious Chicago-based railroad company doesn't want to pay a penny more for the land.  ""Aces 'N Eights"" springs a couple of surprises along the way without violating any of the formula conventions of westerns.  The Dennis Shryack and Ronald M. Cohen screenplay observes all the cliches and then wields them with style.  For example, the Bruce Boxleitner gunfighter is reminiscent of Ben Johnson's gunfighter in ""Shane."" Jack Noseworthy stands out as a member of the railroad who has come to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the railroad and the landowners.  The gunfights are noisy but not bloody.  The treacherous hired guns working for the railroad terrorize and murder land owners and their wives to scare them into selling out.
