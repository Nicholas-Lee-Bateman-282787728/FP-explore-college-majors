1218040,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B001MVYUSO,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[34, 38]","First of all, I'd like to thank the studio for releasing this excellent sitcom.  I say it's better late than never even though I had given up hope that the rest of the seasons would be released.  The first two seasons were released back in 2004 which pleased all us die hard 'Just Shoot Me' fans, but then no more releases came out and then the next release was cancelled for some unknown reason and we've been eagerly anticipating this moment ever since, even though it really didn't seem like it would happen.Now onto the actual season, this is one of the funniest shows in the history of TV, and this offering showcases that perfectly.  It stars Enrico Colantoni as Elliot DiMauro, Blush magazine's photographer extraordinaire and classic playboy.  George Segal stars as Blush magazine's affable, obstinate and somewhat clueless owner and boss, Jack Gallo.  Laura San Giacomo is great as Jack's daughter Maya, who works as an editor for the magazine.  Then there's Dennis Finch portrayed by the actor/comedian David Spade of SNL fame, everybody's loveable troublemaker and smart alec who's always scheming to land dates or play a prank on his co-workers.  Last but not least we have Nina Van Horn as the effervescent, vapid, superficial yet kind fashion editor played by Wendie Malick of 'Baywatch' fame.  Together this ensemble cast provides uproarious moments of laughter on a consistent basis.  This season has one of the best episodes out of the entire series, which is episode 10 entitled 'How the Finch Stole Christmas'.  It's perfect for the holidays so it's too bad that this is not being released until February, but at least it will be there for next year's Christmas.  The third season has the following episodes:Season 3, Episode 1: What the Teddy Bear Saw:  Great episode.  Finch commits a serious faux pas by sleeping with Jack's nanny, and Maya joins a cult after being neglected by Elliot.Season 3, Episode 2: Steamed:  Jack Gallo decides to take over the office upstairs in order to turn it into a day-care center.Season 3, Episode 3: The Mask:  Finch tricks Maya into wearing a ridiculous costume to the office Halloween party.Season 3, Episode 4: Funny Girl:  Maya teaches Elliot and Finch a lesson when they tell her that women don't know how to pull off a good practical joke.Season 3, Episode 5: Two Girls for Every Boy:  In order to fulfill one of his fantasies, Finch concocts an elaborate plan to set up a date between Maya and another woman who has the hots for Maya.Season 3, Episode 6: The Withholder:  Elliot plots to help out Finch whose girlfriend hasn't been very kind to him.Season 3, Episode 7: Puppetmaster:  Maya's new boyfriend is the seemingly kind host of a children's TV show, but as she watches his show she realizes that he may not be quite as wonderful as she initially thought.Season 3, Episode 8: The List:  Jack is disappointed that he's not featured in a prominent magazine listing that's soon to be published, which beckons him to harass Maya to make sure he's included.  Meanwhile, Finch is pestering his idol Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame.Season 3, Episode 9: How Nina Got Her Groove Back:  Nina develops a growing rivalry with a competing fashion expert after their catfight hits the newspapers.Season 3, Episode 10: How the Finch Stole Christmas:  Finch turns into the Christmas grinch and decides to ruin Christmas around the office after he finds out that his co-workers' presents to him were less than stellar.Season 3, Episode 11: Slow Donnie:  One of the best episodes.  Maya suspects that Elliot's younger brother isn't really mentally challenged.Season 3, Episode 12: A Spy in the House of Me:  Maya's ex-boyfriend comes into town to sweep her off her feet, but Jack is less than impressed and tries to break up their relationship.Season 3, Episode 13: Lies & Dolls:  Nina tarnishes her relationship with a politician after gloating about her supposed culinary skills.  Finch finds out that Elliot has a doll made after the TV show 'The Six Million Dollar Man'.Season 3, Episode 14: Nina Sees Red: Part 1:  Finch is distraught after he learns that Nina is dating his recently divorced father.Season 3, Episode 15: Nina Sees Red: Part 2:  Finch's dad and Nina decide to get married, despite Dennis' objections.Season 3, Episode 16: Hostess to Murder:  Maya hosts a murder-mystery party similar to the board game 'Clue', unfortunately her neighbor meets his untimely demise while confronting Maya at this party and problems ensue.Season 3, Episode 17: Toy Story:  Finch decides to be a prankster by switching Elliot's birthday presents given to him by Maya and a male co-worker, which leads to hilarious confusion.Season 3, Episode 18: Miss Pretty:  Elliot disrespects an important client of Asian descent and the new advice columnist creates quite the shock to the Blush staff.Season 3, Episode 19: Maya's Nude Photos:  Maya's photography teacher asks her to take some nude shots of herself, which leads to Elliot convincing Maya that her teacher only wants her nude pictures for his own personal gain.Season 3, Episode 20: And the Femmy Goes To...:  The annual fashion awards show causes the staff to become upset with Jack who is only interested in beating the magazine's rival.Season 3, Episode 21: Softball:  The staff plays softball against rival company softball teams and they discover that Maya is their best player.Season 3, Episode 22: Shaking Private Trainer:  Jack hires a personal trainer to get into shape, but finds that he can't deal with the constant pressure to diet and exercise so he finds a way to end his training prematurely.Season 3, Episode 23: Nina's Choice:  Nina has to choose between an escaped convict who's her ex and the fed who's chasing the criminal.Season 3, Episode 24: The Odd Couple: Part 1:  Finch falls in love with a super-model played by Rebecca Romijin-Stamos.Season 3, Episode 25: The Odd Couple: Part 2:  Finch gets engaged to the supermodel while Maya grows suspicious of the relationship.  The super-model's ex causes problems for Finch.I highly recommend this show to newcomers as well, especially if you enjoy zany, goofy and at times serious sitcoms, then this show will not disappoint.  For all of us longtime fans, we can look forward to enjoying those moments of levity that spanned the entire run of this series.  There's no other show quite like it, hence I've been sorely missing it since it went off the air, so I am overjoyed that at least one more season is making its debut on DVD.",5,"After Patientently

I don't know what the problem was, and frankly, I don't care.  I finally have another installment of Just Shoot Me to watch.  Season 3 starts off with Finch (Spade) getting caught romping with Jack's daughter's nanny on a Nanny Cam hidden in a teddy bear.  Hysterical. Over-the-top.  There are so many great episodes in this season.  Slow Donnie, where Elliott's brother Donnie is pretending to be retarded but keeps trying to pick up on Maya.  The episode where Maya is convinced her new boyfriend (French Stewart, Harry from 3rd Rock) is sending her messages from his children's show through the puppets he uses.  The one where Mark Hamill follows Finch around the office for a few days, bugging him to death about what he does, just to prove a psycho-fan point.  And the two-part season ender where Finch toys with an emotially-vulnerable supermodel (Rebeca Romijn) to impress on old high school acquaintance and ends up marrying her when he realizes this is the best his ife could ever get.  I could go through every one, but I won't.  It is hysterical.  Hilarious.  Cutting humor and quick dialogue. Still fresh as the day it was shot.

(after a five year hiatus due to low sales of theprevious set) with the release of The Complete Third Season, but that the studio has again done the show and the fans proud by releasing it as yet another quality DVD release. All 25 wickedly witty Season 3 episodes are digitally remastered and unedited. The restored footage never ceases to amaze. The packaging is solid with especially nice and inspired artwork: two slimcases each designed like Blush covers featuring the cast and episode titles on the front all inside a slim outer box with cast photoshoot style cover art. On the back of each slimcase is a list of the episodes followed by a brief plot description. Discs 1 & 2 contain: Episodes 1-17 and Disc 3 contains: Episodes 18-25. The 3-disc (551 min.) set features Full Frame (1.33:1) video, English Dolby Surround audio, Closed Captioning for the hearing impaired.Guest stars include: Ana Gasteyer (""Saturday Night Live""), J.P. Manoux (""ER""), Steve Carell (""The Office""), French Stewart (""3rd Rock From The Sun""), Mark Hamill (""Star Wars Trilogy""), David Cross (""Mr. Show""), Brian Dennehy (""Cocoon""), Tyra Banks (""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air""), Willie Garson (""Sex and the City""), David Clennon (""Thirtysomething""), Neal McDonough (""Boomtown""), Jere Burns (""Dear John""), Rebecca Romijn (""X-Men Trilogy""), Kenny Johnson (""The Shield"") and more.No doubt Sony debated long and hard over the release of Just Shoot Me! - The Complete Third Season. Fans will delight in the first-rate treatment the studio has given this release, despite the lack of extras. If sales are good for JSM! - Season Three, then Sony should release subsequent seasons (with the same quality care as the first two sets) with a better release timeframe between sets. Until then, enjoy yet another quality JSM! season set filled with brilliantly funny episodes.Highly Recommended!",5,"Keep 'Em Coming, Sony!",1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,1973,"['What', 'truly', 'surprising', 'set', ""n't"", 'Sony', 'finally', 'resumed', 'releasing', 'season', 'DVDs', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'five', 'year', 'hiatus', 'due', 'low', 'sales', 'theprevious', 'set', 'release', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'studio', 'again', 'done', 'show', 'fans', 'proud', 'releasing', 'yet', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', '25', 'wickedly', 'witty', 'Season', '3', 'episodes', 'are', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'unedited', 'restored', 'footage', 'never', 'amaze', 'packaging', 'solid', 'especially', 'nice', 'inspired', 'artwork', 'two', 'slimcases', 'designed', 'Blush', 'covers', 'featuring', 'cast', 'episode', 'titles', 'front', 'slim', 'outer', 'box', 'cast', 'photoshoot', 'style', 'cover', 'art', 'back', 'slimcase', 'list', 'episodes', 'followed', 'brief', 'plot', 'description', 'Discs', '1', '2', 'contain', 'Episodes', '1-17', 'Disc', '3', 'contains', 'Episodes', '18-25', '3-disc', '551', 'min', 'set', 'features', 'Full', 'Frame', '1.33:1', 'video', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'audio', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'hearing', 'impaired.Guest', 'stars', 'include', 'Ana', 'Gasteyer', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'J.P.', 'Manoux', 'ER', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Office', 'French', 'Stewart', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trilogy', 'David', 'Cross', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Cocoon', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel', 'Air', 'Willie', 'Garson', 'Sex', 'City', 'David', 'Clennon', 'Thirtysomething', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'Boomtown', 'Jere', 'Burns', 'Dear', 'John', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'X-Men', 'Trilogy', 'Kenny', 'Johnson', 'Shield', 'doubt', 'Sony', 'debated', 'long', 'hard', 'release', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'Fans', 'will', 'delight', 'first-rate', 'treatment', 'studio', 'given', 'release', 'lack', 'extras', 'sales', 'are', 'good', 'JSM', 'Season', 'Three', 'then', 'Sony', 'should', 'release', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'same', 'quality', 'care', 'first', 'two', 'sets', 'better', 'release', 'timeframe', 'sets', 'then', 'enjoy', 'yet', 'quality', 'JSM', 'season', 'set', 'filled', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'episodes.Highly', 'Recommended']",Just Shoot Me: Season 3
1218049,A22PMIUQWH2YPA,B001MVYUSO,Southpaw,"[1, 1]","Just Shoot Me is one of my favorite sitcoms of all time. During a dark period in my life where I was holed up in my room due to severe depression, Just Shoot Me brought laughter into my life. It was my lifeline to a world where I could smile and laugh. I looked forward to Dennis Finch's fiascos. I loved the zingers and wisecracks that Nina and Dennis hurled at each other and Maya's attempts in holding onto her journalistic integrity and ideals while working at Blush; a place where ethics and business etiquette  are as welcomed as a sunburn. The characters are quirky and memorable.The show is graced with a stellar cast, superb acting, great premise, and hilarious one-liners. Today's sitcoms don't have the same caliber and witticism as Just Shoot Me; they're few and far between. The witty writing gets better with each following season. You'll undoubtedly find yourself howling with laughter. Don't miss out on this fantastic show. I own seasons 1-3 and have re-watched them numerous times.Like many of the fans, I am eagerly and impatiently awaiting the release of seasons 4,5,6, and 7. The Nanny is another great show from the 90s whose remaining season haven't been released yet. I am immensely frustrated and angry to say the least by the needless and protracted delay by Sony! The fanbase is huge and demanding the release of these great shows! I would buy them in a heartbeat if they were released, as I'm sure the other fans would, too! It ticks me off that mediocre shows that haven't had the same success as Just Shoot Me or The Nanny are being released, whereas these shows that DESERVE to be released on DVD and OWNED by the fans and anyone who loves a good laugh are a no show! I don't want to wait till 2020 for their release!
