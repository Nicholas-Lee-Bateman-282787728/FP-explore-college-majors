1420976,A3FIDRPPXOCCOA,B004NG7SEI,bigscreen,"[0, 0]","I have been a fan of Orla since Celtic Woman where most of America was introduced to her.  This concert was well conceived and executed.  It is a very enjoyable hour of Celtic music and very professionally produced.  My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is her use of the Dubliners on three numbers of the video, a plus is of course is her introducing to me, Tommy Fleming.  What a voice combination Orla and Tommy have.  Still, all in all, an enjoyable music presentation.",4,Very nice concert/Video presentation,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,496,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Orla', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'where', 'most', 'America', 'was', 'introduced', 'concert', 'was', 'well', 'conceived', 'executed', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'hour', 'Celtic', 'music', 'very', 'professionally', 'produced', 'only', 'complaint', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'use', 'Dubliners', 'three', 'numbers', 'video', 'plus', 'course', 'introducing', 'Tommy', 'Fleming', 'What', 'voice', 'combination', 'Orla', 'Tommy', 'have', 'Still', 'enjoyable', 'music', 'presentation']",N/A
1420977,A1XQP1HXYJCUZP,B004NG7SEI,Dan Coffee,"[1, 1]","The best way I can describe this show is like this. You get a craving for a really good meal so you jump in the car, get to the restaurant, and have your heart set on getting a nice big 10oz filet mignon, but when you look over the menu they only have is a 6oz cut. Even more exasperating ... when it gets to the table it's got ketchup on it! That's what happened here.The 6oz potion is my analogy for the length of the show. It's only about 52 minutes long beginning to end and there is a LOT of filler to even make it that long. Additionally, it isn't bad enough to just run a commercial plug for discoverireland.com separately in a menu chapter of the DVD; the producers tied one in so that it plays twice, once before the show starts and again after the ending credits. Combined, the commercial and end credits chew up a 2 to 3 minutes of playing time and there are also several guest singers who participate in the show during which time, Orla becomes part of a `sing along'. This makes the part of the show where Orla is the only singer less than 37 minutes. This is what I mean when I talk about a 6oz portion. If you have much of an appetite you're going to leave hungry.As for the ketchup on top ... That is how the show gets ruined by what I have decided to call a `video laugh track'. It seems as though modern-day video editors have taken over the responsibility of letting the viewers know when they are supposed to react to a performance. It is much the same as audio crews mixing in a laugh track in comedies, so that the audience will know when they are supposed to laugh. Now days we are doing the same thing with video to tell people when they should clap, or sing, or smile, or sit reverently, or nudge the person sitting next to them, or whatever. By U.S. law subliminal suggestion is not permitted but if you show these auto suggestions long enough to make them visible it's okay. So guess what is happening to all the videos now days? We get bombarded with spliced in shots of the audience. Now don't get me wrong ... if they want to show the audience `between' songs, that's fine, but this show has been salted with so many of these blatant audience `garbage shots' that it's very much like dumping ketchup on a filet mignon. It ruins it!There is yet another distraction. There is a rolling dolly grip camera set up behind the second row of people in the audience which is being used to take `down low close ups' and when the camera in the far back of the theater is used, we the viewers are seeing this dolly grip equipment moving back and forth. In other shots where the dolly grip itself is used, there are seven occasions where the backs of the heads of the people in the first two rows show up as blurred images at the bottom of the television screen. [Well enough complaining; you get the idea. Let's move on.]I always try to balance out my disappointments with some of the good points.1 Apart from the annoying kaleidoscope shots of the audience, the picture quality is pretty good for a standard definition version DVD.2 The sound quality is pretty decent although the most discriminating listeners will tell you that the mixing and audio compression are only so so.3 There are more songs on the DVD than the CD (at least that's what Amazon's information suggests).4 If you can't enjoy `just listening' and need a picture to watch, remember ... most people seem to be a lot less distracted by the video chaos than I am, or at least they don't talk about it.5 And lastly ... Orla is a great singer and the songs she picked are a lot more Celtic than what Celtic Woman is singing these days.Keep In mind that this is just one mans opinion and read the other reviews. If you look at the numbers, you will see that most people liked the show.",3,Oh waiter!

1420978,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B004NG7SEI,Gary P. Cohen,"[5, 5]","Orla Fallon is a lovely woman and this, her second DVD in the last few months, is a pleasure to watch.  Her recent Christmas special was excellent and this special is excellent as well.  Orla looking great in a lovely green dress sings many traditional Irish songs and several fairly contemporary numbers such as ""Both Sides Now"" and ""Morning Has Broken.""  During several of the numbers there are additional shots of Orla singing in picuresque beautiful Irish locations.  It is plainly obvious how much Orla loves her homeland and this special is a tribute to that.  In several of the numbers she is surrounded by Irish musical group the Dubliners and it is sort of amusing to see the fairly small Orla surrounded by all these very large men.Orla was one of my favorites of Celtic Woman and I was saddened to see her leave.  However she is probably thinking she made the right decision with 3 excellent CDs and two wonderful specials on PBS and DVD since leaving.  I enjoy watching her move around on stage and it is a pleasure watching her play the harp.  It is obvious that she is having a wonderful time on this special.
