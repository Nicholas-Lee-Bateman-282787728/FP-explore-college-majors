1069980,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000PCMHEU,Buenoslibros.es,"[15, 17]","One of the top 10 movies ever made. Another magnificent piece of art by John Ford. The South never looked as poetic, realistic, as here. You will cry as much as you laugh out loud. The respect for the old folk, the love for the soil, the humbleness of common people, the care and devotion to the land, to the people who toil the land, is depicted with artistic perfection.I couldn't even blink watching the masterful art of John Ford. I even thought how banal, ridiculous are other so-called great classics compared to this one film. Welles, Hitchcock, Cukor, Wyler... everyone shrinks to the atom level when you compare their films to this gorgeous and heartwrenching film.And then the script so wonderful, is like listening to poetry; and the faces (oh, Lord, the faces!). How he achieved those expressions in the camera is only miraculous. And, of course, the choir songs, the gospel chants... It's the final touch, Mr. Ford's signature. I hadn't seen this movie in years. Now I think it may be the best film ever.",5,An insult it hasn't been released on dvd yet,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,1017,"['One', 'top', '10', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'art', 'John', 'Ford', 'South', 'never', 'looked', 'poetic', 'realistic', 'here', 'will', 'cry', 'as', 'much', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'respect', 'old', 'folk', 'love', 'soil', 'humbleness', 'common', 'people', 'care', 'devotion', 'land', 'people', 'who', 'toil', 'land', 'depicted', 'artistic', 'perfection.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'blink', 'watching', 'masterful', 'art', 'John', 'Ford', 'even', 'thought', 'how', 'banal', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'other', 'so-called', 'great', 'classics', 'compared', 'one', 'film', 'Welles', 'Hitchcock', 'Cukor', 'Wyler', 'everyone', 'atom', 'level', 'when', 'compare', 'films', 'gorgeous', 'heartwrenching', 'film.And', 'then', 'script', 'so', 'wonderful', 'listening', 'poetry', 'oh', 'Lord', 'How', 'achieved', 'expressions', 'camera', 'only', 'miraculous', 'course', 'choir', 'songs', 'gospel', 'chants', 'final', 'touch', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'signature', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'Now', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'ever']",Tobacco Road

There was an Ellie May barefoot young daughter, character with the name Ellie May, that the father wanted to marry off.  There was a strong, dumb Jethro-type character. Even a Granny-type character.  Except they live on an old Run-down family owned Tobacco Plantation, that no longer has any crop.  The actors are all really great.  It is a fun movie, with a solemn feel to it.  That is an indication of good Directing, and acting.  Something that no longer exsists in Hollywood.  This movie belongs in every movie collectors collection.  More comedy than drama, but enough balance of each to keep you glued to your movie seat.  It WAS a difficult movie to find.

1069982,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B000PCMHEU,Noirdame,"[1, 2]","This is an underrated classic from director John Ford, which doesn't quite match ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" but has a wonderful touching affect all its own. Adapted (or some might say, cleansed) from Erskine Caldwell's novel and James Kirkland's Broadway play, concerning a backwoods, dirt-poor Georgia family who may soon lose their home and their land. Charlie Grapewin and Elizabeth Patterson give touching performances as Pa and Ma Lester, with only two of their many children who still reside with them. One is their supreme annoyance of a son, Dude (William Tracy), who becomes so irritating that I couldn't help but wish that someone would put him out of his misery. Gene Tierney plays their daughter, Ellie May, who pants after her brother-in-law, Lov (Ward Bond), who is smitten with her but is afraid to marry her. Enter Captain Tim Harmon (Dana Andrews), who assists the clan in preserving their land. Marjorie Rambeau's portrayal of Sister Bessie Rice is great also. Funny, touching, entertaining, interesting . . . . . . .And getting to see Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews in an early film together before they were paired again later in their starring careers make this worth it for viewing alone.",4,"""Ain't You Gonna Give Me Just A Bite, Lov?""",1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1204,"['underrated', 'classic', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'wonderful', 'touching', 'affect', 'own', 'Adapted', 'might', 'say', 'cleansed', 'Erskine', 'Caldwell', 'novel', 'James', 'Kirkland', 'Broadway', 'play', 'concerning', 'backwoods', 'dirt-poor', 'Georgia', 'family', 'who', 'may', 'soon', 'lose', 'home', 'land', 'Charlie', 'Grapewin', 'Elizabeth', 'Patterson', 'give', 'touching', 'performances', 'Pa', 'Ma', 'Lester', 'only', 'two', 'many', 'children', 'who', 'still', 'reside', 'One', 'supreme', 'annoyance', 'son', 'Dude', 'William', 'Tracy', 'who', 'so', 'irritating', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'put', 'misery', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'daughter', 'Ellie', 'May', 'who', 'brother-in-law', 'Lov', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'who', 'smitten', 'afraid', 'marry', 'Enter', 'Captain', 'Tim', 'Harmon', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'who', 'clan', 'preserving', 'land', 'Marjorie', 'Rambeau', 'portrayal', 'Sister', 'Bessie', 'Rice', 'great', 'also', 'Funny', 'touching', 'entertaining', 'interesting', '.And', 'getting', 'see', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'early', 'film', 'together', 'were', 'paired', 'again', 'later', 'starring', 'careers', 'make', 'worth', 'viewing', 'alone']",Tobacco Road
1069983,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B000PCMHEU,Randy Keehn,"[5, 14]","I've been reading a biography of John Ford this past couple of weeks and I decided to view some of his work that I hadn't seen before.  I rented ""Tobacco Road"" because it had promise as a successful Broadway play and an outstanding director.  It didn't take long before I realized that that was nowhere enough to salvage this turkey.  The acting is abrasive and so much so that Dana Andrews seems totally miscast with his calm, reassuring delivery.  The worst character is the son named Duke who screams, hollers and explodes.  There is no continuity to the script which seems to veer left and right at high speeds (just like Duke's driving).  I realize that this was intended to be a comedy (with social implications?) but the humor wasn't there.  The characters were to be pitied, not laughed at, and the scheming was more pathetic than innovative.  Everything was done for the good of the moment with no thought to the future.  Thus everytime we felt the least amount of sympathy or encouragement for the characters, we were reminded that these are idiots who won't put any effort into saving themselves so why should we put any effort into caring.  I'd characterize ""Tobacco Road as ""The Grapes of Wrath"" on helium but, then, that would be giving the script a credit it doesn't deserve.Years ago I watched ""Donovan's Reef"" and realized that John Ford did not always succeed in making a good movie.  ""Tobacco Road"" shows his capability of actually making a bad movie.  Ford must have been out for revenge when he made this one.  I note the 6 previous reviews all give ""5 Stars""; to each his own.

Rather than being based on the Erskine Caldwell novel, the film is based on the hit Broadway play of Caldwell's novel. At the time the film was made, it was the longest running play in Broadway history (over 3,000 performance and an eight year run). The film differs considerably from both the novel and the play. For some reason, the director John Ford decided to play it for laughs and the film plays out like a skewered episode of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES. Caldwell showed an insight and an empathy for his poor white trash characters, here screenwriter Nunnally Johnson and Ford give us outrageous cornpone hillbilly stereotypes and with the exception of Elizabeth Patterson who gives a touching performance as Grapewin's wife, the acting is broad and buffoonish. And whose idea was it to cast the lovely and elegant Gene Tierney as a barefoot, dirt covered hillbilly nymph? With Dana Andrews, Marjorie Rambeau as psalm singing Sister Bessie, William Tracy, Grant Mitchell and Ward Bond, married to a 12 year old in the book but the movie ups her age to 13.The DVD from Fox Brazil is a handsome looking B&W; transfer in English with optional Portuguese subtitles.",3,Erskine Caldwell's dirt poor rednecks played for laughs,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,1347,"['Set', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'Great', 'Depression', 'dirt', 'poor', 'tenant', 'farmer', 'Charley', 'Grapewin', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'hold', 'dying', 'farm', 'bank', 'possess', 'Rather', 'being', 'based', 'Erskine', 'Caldwell', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Caldwell', 'novel', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'longest', 'running', 'play', 'Broadway', 'history', '3,000', 'performance', 'eight', 'year', 'run', 'film', 'differs', 'considerably', 'novel', 'play', 'reason', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'decided', 'play', 'laughs', 'film', 'out', 'skewered', 'episode', 'THE', 'BEVERLY', 'HILLBILLIES', 'Caldwell', 'showed', 'insight', 'empathy', 'poor', 'white', 'trash', 'characters', 'here', 'screenwriter', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'Ford', 'give', 'outrageous', 'cornpone', 'hillbilly', 'stereotypes', 'exception', 'Elizabeth', 'Patterson', 'who', 'touching', 'performance', 'Grapewin', 'wife', 'acting', 'broad', 'buffoonish', 'idea', 'was', 'cast', 'lovely', 'elegant', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'barefoot', 'dirt', 'covered', 'hillbilly', 'nymph', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'Marjorie', 'Rambeau', 'psalm', 'singing', 'Sister', 'Bessie', 'William', 'Tracy', 'Grant', 'Mitchell', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'married', '12', 'year', 'old', 'book', 'movie', 'age', '13.The', 'DVD', 'Fox', 'Brazil', 'handsome', 'looking', 'B', 'W', 'transfer', 'English', 'optional', 'Portuguese', 'subtitles']",Tobacco Road
