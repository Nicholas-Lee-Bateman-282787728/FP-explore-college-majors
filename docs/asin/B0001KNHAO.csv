The beginning is a bit slow and the subtitles are hurried, but the movie picks us pace within the first 10 minutes. In the end, you'll learn a bit about Israeli culture and a bit about  youth in the military. This is one of those rare movies that will admit to the frailty of life and shows that young people are doing the fighting (not men in their forties).

The affection and intimacy shown between Yossi and Jagger (and especially at the beginning) just made me smile... why is violence more acceptable than tenderness?On some level, I do feel sorry for Yaeli, mainly because loves Jagger and she's unwitting of the fact that Jagger is gay... but I don't like her; I know that she's unwitting of Jagger's secret, but I still see her as this Jezebel, trying to take Jagger away from Yossi.It felt like I'd been kicked in the gut when Yossi kept their romance secret the whole time... as though it was forbidden to be known... but looking at the photographs of Jagger at the end... and that beautiful song, ""Your Soul""... how can one not cry? And why are we so blind to the gritty reality of war after it has been proven time and again of how brutal it is? Nobody should have to suffer like that... nobody should have to lose somebody that they love...It's also heartbreaking beacuse this is almost the same thing that's happening to all of those poor soldiers out there in the world... their poor families... nobody should have to waste their lives in the trenches.Despite the sad ending, I do feel some joy, in that Yossi will carry those memories of Jagger... and perhaps be reunited with him... someday...I would buy this film just to see their cuddling in the snow...!It's a real tearjerking movie... very grim... but it's just so sweet...!",5,Heartbreaking... but sweet...,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",2004,1526,"['ending', 'made', 'teary-eyed', ""'m"", 'known', 'being', 'unemotional', 'was', 'also', 'just', 'one', 'dearest', 'things', 'ever', 'saw', 'affection', 'intimacy', 'shown', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', 'especially', 'beginning', 'just', 'made', 'smile', 'why', 'violence', 'more', 'acceptable', 'tenderness', 'level', 'do', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Yaeli', 'mainly', 'loves', 'Jagger', 'unwitting', 'fact', 'Jagger', 'gay', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'know', 'unwitting', 'Jagger', 'secret', 'still', 'see', 'Jezebel', 'trying', 'take', 'Jagger', 'away', 'Yossi.It', 'felt', ""'d"", 'been', 'kicked', 'gut', 'when', 'Yossi', 'kept', 'romance', 'secret', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'forbidden', 'be', 'known', 'looking', 'photographs', 'Jagger', 'end', 'beautiful', 'song', 'Soul', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'not', 'cry', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'gritty', 'reality', 'war', 'been', 'proven', 'time', 'again', 'how', 'brutal', 'Nobody', 'should', 'have', 'suffer', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'lose', 'somebody', 'love', 'also', 'heartbreaking', 'beacuse', 'almost', 'same', 'thing', 'happening', 'poor', 'soldiers', 'out', 'there', 'world', 'poor', 'families', 'nobody', 'should', 'have', 'waste', 'lives', 'trenches.Despite', 'sad', 'ending', 'do', 'feel', 'joy', 'Yossi', 'will', 'carry', 'memories', 'Jagger', 'perhaps', 'be', 'reunited', 'someday', 'would', 'buy', 'film', 'just', 'see', 'cuddling', 'snow', 'real', 'tearjerking', 'movie', 'very', 'grim', 'just', 'so', 'sweet']",N/A

My path started at what I think is his best film (and one of my favorite films ever),Walk on Waterstarring Lior Ashkenazi, Israel's best actor.  I then worked my way forward toThe Bubble, which has Ashkenazi in a cameo as himself and stars Ohad Knoller of 'Yossi'.'Yossi' itself is a scant 71 minutes, but Fox makes every minute count.  What strikes me is the relevance of Fox's work.  If you look at 2006's Second Lebanon War (a.k.a., The July War), it was set off by border skirmishes and kidnappings of Israeli soldiers on the northern front.  Fighting put northern Israeli cities into peril from Hezbollah rockets.  Those are the themes that fuel and run through ""Yossi and Jagger"" and ""The Bubble.""  Fox and co-writer (and partner) Gal Uchovsky get my respect for the way they've crafted these realistic dramatic arcs.The other treat here is Aya Koren (here credited as 'Aya Steinovitz' - pre-marriage I suppose) as 'Yaeli'.  This is the most beautiful woman in film, but IMDB lists her last on-screen appearance in 2004.  Seriously, what is up with that?  Israeli directors and casting agents, please put an end to this injustice.Other random thoughts:  My co-favorite (with 'Walk on Water') Israeli film still stands asThe Syrian Bride.  My second-ranked Ashkenazi work isLate Marriage, which has the added advantage of Ms. Koren in a small role and Ronit Elkabetz in a meaty one.",4,Tracing the Eytan Fox filmography gets you here; 71 powerful minutes,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,1508,"['work', 'way', 'backwards', 'Eytan', 'Fox', 'aka', 'Eitan', 'Fuchs', 'filmography', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'here', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', 'path', 'started', 'what', 'think', 'best', 'film', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'ever', 'Walk', 'Waterstarring', 'Lior', 'Ashkenazi', 'Israel', 'best', 'actor', 'then', 'worked', 'way', 'forward', 'Bubble', 'Ashkenazi', 'cameo', 'stars', 'Ohad', 'Knoller', ""'Yossi"", 'scant', '71', 'minutes', 'Fox', 'minute', 'count', 'What', 'relevance', 'Fox', 'work', 'look', '2006', 'Second', 'Lebanon', 'War', 'a.k.a.', 'July', 'War', 'was', 'set', 'off', 'border', 'skirmishes', 'kidnappings', 'Israeli', 'soldiers', 'northern', 'front', 'Fighting', 'put', 'northern', 'Israeli', 'cities', 'peril', 'Hezbollah', 'rockets', 'are', 'themes', 'fuel', 'run', 'Yossi', 'Jagger', 'Bubble', 'Fox', 'co-writer', 'partner', 'Gal', 'Uchovsky', 'get', 'respect', 'way', ""'ve"", 'crafted', 'realistic', 'dramatic', 'arcs.The', 'other', 'treat', 'here', 'Aya', 'Koren', 'here', 'credited', ""'Aya"", 'Steinovitz', 'pre-marriage', 'suppose', ""'Yaeli"", 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'film', 'IMDB', 'last', 'on-screen', 'appearance', '2004', 'Seriously', 'what', 'up', 'Israeli', 'directors', 'casting', 'agents', 'please', 'put', 'end', 'injustice.Other', 'random', 'thoughts', 'co-favorite', ""'Walk"", 'Water', 'Israeli', 'film', 'still', 'asThe', 'Syrian', 'Bride', 'second-ranked', 'Ashkenazi', 'work', 'isLate', 'Marriage', 'added', 'advantage', 'Ms.', 'Koren', 'small', 'role', 'Ronit', 'Elkabetz', 'meaty', 'one']",N/A

I've reviewed each of them on Amazon.As for ""Y&J;"": Moviemaking is about the art of good storytelling. An artful hand can make a poor story idea seem like entertainment for ninety minutes. Yossi & Jagger is proof that the contrary is also true. Here, an adequate story idea was ruined by people who have no idea how to tell a story in an artful, compelling, entertaining method.Always the optimist, in my searching for something about this movie to recommend, I find only one suggestion: Watch some other movie instead. Based on what this film claims to be, I recommend LATTER DAYS, a very enjoyable movie I didn't want to like, but did anyway, happily the opposite of Yossi & Jagger, a sadly inept production I very much wanted to like, but couldn't.Several things came together to keep this flick from being a competent attempt at entertainment: The script, the acting, the directing, the production, and other fundamental elements. While the premise, though cliche, was good enough, the execution of that idea was mind-numbingly sophmoric. As much as I wanted to enjoy Yossi & Jagger, the truth is that the Editorial Review, penned by Tom Keogh, is far better than the movie itself.Perhaps the only thing worse than a director who doesn't know how to tell a story is the one who knows not when to quit. This one is both. The one moment that came close to living up to Keogh's promise for the film came too late to make any difference to those who'd managed to suffer through to that point so late in the movie. That was when Yossi finally tells Jagger, ""I love you"", only it's too late, as Jagger had just died. You'd think they'd have cut their losses and ended the movie right then and there, a logical point for an ending. Alas, that was not to be, and much like the earlier parts of the movie, they lumbered on, without adding anything of substance. They must have had extra film, because they kept going, to no useful purpose.Having not chosen to attend the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival, I must assume that the most likely explanation for the Best Actor award for Ohad Knoller reflects a woeful lack of worthy nominees.

Jagger is a popular soldier, renowned for his good looks and likeable personality. The tension  in their relationship reaches its climax during one of the military missions.Personally I found this to be one of the most interesting and beautiful films about gay men. While it is very short (65 mins)the relationship is quickly established and we the audience are treated to a ""day in the life of..."" styled film. One moment the film reveals the physical aspects of the two men's relationship while next there are other scenes where people are just goofing off or eating.

809178,AGAJITEU64H4A,B0001KNHAO,Cheri Crystal,"[26, 27]","""Yossi and Jagger"" is a touching and realistic film based on a true story about two Israeli Soldiers who love each other. At a mere 67 minutes, this movie packs in substantial messages. In one of the movie's trailers, there is a statement that pretty much sums up the movie, ""Love Should Never be a Secret."" How sad that being gay and in love has to be an exception.An outpost of the Israeli-Lebanese border is the setting of the film where the two army commanders maintain secrecy about their relationship-similar to America's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. Even if the other soldiers suspect, they do not make an issue out of the fact that their leaders are gay but you get the distinct feeling they would rather not know.The viewers get a sense of what it must be like to live in a constant state of war, fear, and fighting, while defending one's country. While many young people are partying, going to school, falling in love, and enjoying their youth, Israeli youth are drafted into the Army and ordered to risk their lives every day. What kinds of hopes and dreams can these people have when they are fighting for survival? It is inspiring to see how they allow themselves simple pleasures in life to remember what they are fighting for and to maintain their sanity. They seek love, companionship, and fun to get them through this difficult time of uncertainty in their lives.Yossi (Ohad Knoller) and Jagger's (Yehuda Levi) poignant love story is all too real. Yossi, first commander, wants to keep their affair a secret and Jagger, second commander, wants to tell the world. Jagger is growing tired of hiding his love and being ashamed of it. He is close to the end of his tour and he asks Yossi to retire from the army when he does. He longs for an open and honest relationship with the love of his life. Yossi feels he can never change and is unable or unwilling to declare his love for Jagger publicly or privately. Even though Jagger knows Yossi loves him, he wants to hear him say it.I recommend this movie for its depth and realism. It is real without being too gory in its depiction of war but its powerful message is all too loud and clear. War is senseless and a severe weakness of the human condition. It reminds us of our failings to get along with our neighbors, which often meets with a tragic end.",5,A Review of Yossi and Jagger by Cheri,1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,2319,"['Yossi', 'Jagger', 'touching', 'realistic', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'Israeli', 'Soldiers', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'mere', '67', 'minutes', 'movie', 'substantial', 'messages', 'one', 'movie', 'trailers', 'statement', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'movie', 'Love', 'Should', 'Never', 'be', 'Secret', 'How', 'sad', 'being', 'gay', 'love', 'be', 'exception.An', 'outpost', 'Israeli-Lebanese', 'border', 'setting', 'film', 'where', 'two', 'army', 'commanders', 'maintain', 'secrecy', 'relationship-similar', 'America', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'policy', 'Even', 'other', 'soldiers', 'suspect', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'issue', 'fact', 'leaders', 'are', 'gay', 'get', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'know.The', 'viewers', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'live', 'constant', 'state', 'war', 'fear', 'fighting', 'defending', 'one', 'country', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'partying', 'going', 'school', 'falling', 'love', 'enjoying', 'youth', 'Israeli', 'youth', 'are', 'drafted', 'Army', 'ordered', 'risk', 'lives', 'day', 'What', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'can', 'people', 'have', 'when', 'are', 'fighting', 'survival', 'inspiring', 'see', 'how', 'allow', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'life', 'remember', 'what', 'are', 'fighting', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'seek', 'love', 'companionship', 'fun', 'get', 'difficult', 'time', 'uncertainty', 'lives.Yossi', 'Ohad', 'Knoller', 'Jagger', 'Yehuda', 'Levi', 'poignant', 'love', 'story', 'too', 'real', 'Yossi', 'first', 'commander', 'keep', 'affair', 'secret', 'Jagger', 'second', 'commander', 'tell', 'world', 'Jagger', 'growing', 'tired', 'hiding', 'love', 'being', 'ashamed', 'close', 'end', 'tour', 'Yossi', 'retire', 'army', 'when', 'open', 'honest', 'relationship', 'love', 'life', 'feels', 'can', 'never', 'change', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'declare', 'love', 'Jagger', 'publicly', 'privately', 'Even', 'Jagger', 'Yossi', 'hear', 'say', 'it.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'depth', 'realism', 'real', 'being', 'too', 'gory', 'depiction', 'war', 'powerful', 'message', 'too', 'loud', 'clear', 'War', 'senseless', 'severe', 'weakness', 'human', 'condition', 'failings', 'get', 'neighbors', 'often', 'tragic', 'end']",N/A

In the interrelationships among those in the encampent close to the battle zone is really interesting - including two women who are really interesting and fun people to see!

I watched it again last night and then it's follow-up/sequel, ""Yossi"" also by Eytan Fox.  Yossi & Jagger (latter nicknamed after the lead from the Rolling Stones, due to his rock-star style and clownish affability).  An excellent, bittersweet story of two young Israeli soldiers on the Lebanon front.  Jagger is honest and open about his love for Yossi, and he also has a female soldier who has a crush on him.  Jagger also wants Yossi to leave the service at the same time he does so that they can be together - Jagger telling Yossi he intends on telling his parents about his sexuality at this time, too. Yossi is very much in love with Jagger, but struggling with his more conservative upbringing and the reserve he feels necessary to his role as a squad commander, he is unwilling to be as open about his love for Jagger.For a very short film - only 71 minutes - this film packs a lot of romance, tenderness, reality and drama, comedy and Jewish/Israeli culture.

Luckily it has arrived on dvd and I have finally had the chance to see it.  Barely over an hour long, this small love story delivers a punch and good performances from the lead actors.  A bonus in the film is a lot of Israeli culture and insight into the life of young Israeli soldiers.The story centers around two soldiers, Yossi, a respected leader and Lior (or Jagger, as his friends call him, because of his rock star good looks and charisma).  Because they are gay, their love is kept secret---a position Yossi is fine with and Jagger is tired of and wants changed.  The two lovers sneak away when time permits and the love they share is warm and genuine.  The chemistry between the two actors if believable and you find yourself hoping for the two to live ""happily ever after"".There is not much in the way of extra features on the dvd (there is a video of the song Jagger sings to Yossi after their bout in the snow) and a few previews of other Strand Releasing videos and dvds.

I, at first, thought that it (the film) was too short, that there was not enough story; that there was not enough affection shown between the two lovers and, most of all that the ending was not satisfying (I wanted, somehow for all to end-though impossible-happily).  After subsequent viewings, I began to realize that what was being portrayed was closer to ""real life"" than fiction.The story is about an illicit (or at least, very frowned upon) wartime romance between two male soldiers in Israel-a romance between a soldier that is very comfortable with himself and his gayness and a soldier that is actually in the closet (very concerned with being a ""good"" soldier.) One gets the strong feeling that they really do love each other; however, the closeted soldier was forever looking over his shoulder not able to overtly express his feelings until much TOO LATE.  I'm sure any gay romance in a military situation, especially on the front lines, is fraught with many dangers making for a very uncomfortable situation for those involved.  When viewed with some understanding I do feel the film gives the viewer a sample of what it must be like to be involved in a gay romance in the aforesaid circumstance. Also captured in this film are the dangers, the suffocating atmosphere, the sexual tensions along with the unrequited loves and infatuations that can occur in war.Only when Jagger is dying can Yossi tell him that he really loves him and wants to be with him not caring that another soldier can hear him.  But, of course, it's too late.  However, Yossi is left with wonderful and beautiful memories of his lover that will last him a lifetime.

The air is frosted with both fears and idyllic dreams of a comfortable civilian life. In this tiny corner of a war torn country, two soldiers await destiny amid their shivering companions. The first is Lior Amichai, affectionately called ""Jagger"" for his love of the noted singer. The other is his companion and secret lover Yossi who despite command responsibilities, yearns for a time when he and Jagger can openly express their love. Arrayed against this union are the tragedies of life. There is Aya who also loves Jagger and in turn is sought after by others in the tiny force. The squad like most common soldiers, long to return home and dream of peace. It is rare that a film elevates gay love to such a poignant level, but this story does just that. It captures the true sentiments of both characters and tugs at the heart of any who have ever been in love amid the turmoil of conflict.

He didn't win any awards for this film.  It doesn't work all that well as a movie IMHO, although it was a success in Israel.  First time screenwriter Avner Bernheimer's script doesn't take the story and make either a profound point or an unforgettable experience.  Most of the film takes place at a rugged military encampment near the Lebanese-Israeli border.  It is bleak and barren, rocky terrain that has snow.  Ohad Knoller who played a commando in the filmMunich (Widescreen Edition)plays the unit commander Yossi in what was his second movie back in 2002.  He's a rough & tumble masculine fighting man who worries about the physical condition of his soldiers.  His one quirk is that he is having a love affair with Lior Amichai who is a young good-looking Israeli soldier played by Yehuda Levi.  Levi won a Best Actor Award from the Israeli TV Academy for the film.  Some of the soldiers appear aware and unfazed by the relationship, while most are oblivious to it.  Obviously, the guys are operating from a ""don't ask, don't tell"" model within the military structure.  Levi is so good looking that the other soldiers refer to him as ""Jagger,"" based on the Rolling Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger.  The complication in the movie comes in the form of an unrealized love triangle (or maybe quadrangle).  Assi Cohen, who played a newlywed man in the film ""Munich,"" plays Ophir who has a crush on female soldier Yaeli played by Aya Koren.  She is a dark-haired beauty who loves Jagger.  She is not aware that Jagger prefers the company of men & pursues him with increasing frustration.  Her friend Goldie is played by Hani Furstenberg in what I believe was her first film.  Goldie satisfies the general's battlefield needs without romantic illusions.  Ophir becomes angry with Jagger because Yaeli will not respond to Ophir's advances.  Jagger becomes angry with Yossi because he won't commit to him and plan a post-military life together.  War events then intervene and shatter everyone's expectations.  The setting of the film reminded me of a wartime Israeli version of the M.A.S.H. TV show with its barren landscape and primitive battlefield accommodations.  Neither the romance nor what the story did with it was very interesting.  The best thing about the DVD was the cool music video.

Running a mere 65 minutes, the film divides its time equally between a platoon of soldiers operating on the Israeli-Lebanese border, and the two men at the center of a clandestine relationship.Yossi (Knoller) is a brooding commander who feels constrained by his role as a macho authority figure to conceal his sexuality from the conscripts under his command, while Jagger (Levi, a popular Israeli heartthrob whose career was kickstarted by an appearance in the TV soap opera ""Cheers for Love"" in 2001) is one of his subordinates, a carefree guy who wants them to declare their love openly by retiring from the Army and setting up house together. There's a now-famous scene, early in the movie, when Yossi and Jagger make love in the snow (don't get excited - all you see are some lingering kisses and the aftermath, in which the two characters are entirely at ease with one another, free from the restraints imposed by Army discipline), but their romance takes up a surprisingly small part of the movie, which appears to have been curtailed for reasons of length (there's a number of images doing the rounds - one of which appears on the back of this DVD - from scenes which were apparently shot but didn't make it to the final print).Based on a true story, the film is warm-hearted but inconsequential, with some annoyingly jerky hand-held camera movements, and the climactic scenes are a little too restrained to be entirely successful (though Knoller, in particular, gives a truly remarkbale performance in the aftermath of a major plot development). There's still much to admire, and any reservations are dispelled by the central romance, depicted with disarming frankness and performed with relish by Knoller and Levi.

The surprise is a truly touching portrait of youth on the front lines. In war some lose their limbs, some their minds and others their loves, only to be reborn.

Yossi and Jagger are Israeli military conscripts, part of a platoon guarding an icy, isolated outpost. Unknown to everyone around them, they are also lovers. Jagger (played by Yehuda Levi) is the free-spirited one, more comfortable with his sexuality, who wants the world to know about his love. He's about to finish his service with the army and has dreams of eventually living openly with the love of his life.Yossi on the other hand (played by Ohad Knoller) - who just happens to also be Jagger's commanding officer - is more restrained and intent on keeping his sexual orientation and his relationship private. All the while, Ya'eli, a beautiful female soldier (played by Aya Steinovitz) pines for Jagger but he's patently oblivious to her love for him. Thus the scene is set for an engrossing story. Some interesting issues about homosexuality are raised, some stereotypes are challenged and myths destroyed. I was blown away. The movie reminded me of the 2005 movieJarhead (Widescreen Edition), in that the largest proportion of it is spent watching soldiers waiting for something to happen. It finally does though, and there are tragic consequences.What I love most of all about this movie is the way it neatly (and wisely) sidesteps the political realities of the region by refraining from introducing us to the enemy the Israeli army are fighting. They are never even mentioned by name. We can guess whom they might be fighting but we'll never know for sure. We are thus able to focus on the real story here without any distractions. At just over an hour long, the movie is notably short but director Eytan Fox ensures that it manages to tell its story with no compromise. ""Unusually subtle and convincing,"" said the New York Times, ""A searing, tense and beautifully told film,"" said the Philadelphia Inquirer. I say believe them both. It's apparently based on a true story and has brilliantly drawn supporting characters, most notable of all (from a personal standpoint) being Ophir, played by Assi Cohen. I will be watching one this again and again.DVD extras include a song from the movie (Jagger loved it), a stills gallery featuring some of the movie's stars and trailers of other TLA releases. The movie is in Hebrew with optional English subtitles.PS.

The film deftly handles the intricies of their relationship but this is much more than a gay romance film. The dullness and claustrophobic conditions of army life is skillfully depicted with the help of a shaky camera that gives the film a documentary look.Secondary characters sustain interest also and include two female soldiers - one is having an affair with a married officer and the other has a crush on Jagger, despite the fact that almost everyone has told her that ""you're not really his type.""This film could probably have been more affecting with a little more time (the ending seems a little abrupt) but it still delivers quite a punch for such a small film.The only dvd extras are a music video which is a shame.
