1482537,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B005LAII62,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[0, 0]","IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not an animated movie that should be seen by any small child. I would say age 12+ due to occasional foul language and certain situations. If your child is a preteen or teen then there should be no major problems.I'm 28 and must say I highly enjoyed the movie! I thought the characters were perfect, the story unraveled well and at a good pace and it really kept me interested. I was dying to know how it was going to end and I must say I was satisfied by the finish.The main plot of the story is that a schoolkid named Normon is constantly ostracized and put down by most others (from classmates to his family) because he can see and talk to ghosts. He spends a good amount of time watching scary movies and talking to his grandma (who happens to have passed away but still inhabits Norman's family's home). He goes to school and most people just don't understand where he's coming from, like, ever. He goes through the school day trying to pay attention to what happens around him but often he is distracted by ghosts that are everywhere!What I really, really liked about the movie was the message of how someone who is sometimes very gifted can be a total outcast in life. I thought that the ending with Agatha (or how she puts it ""Aggy"") was extremely heartfelt. There are quite a few spots in the movie that will make you stop and think, ""Aww!!"".Some of the inappropriate (at least for children) stuff that occurs is the use of words like ""jackass"", ""hell"", a schoolkid mentioning the ""adult movie store"" nearby and the same schoolkid touching Norman's older sister's butt (although it's just implied and not actually shown). Basically if you are 12 or older there probably isn't anything that will stun you too much (unless you grew up highly religious and you aren't even allowed to say stuff like ""holy cow"" or the similar).Highly recommended!5 stars!P.S.

However, when he is handed the task of preventing an infamous witch's curse on his town, he learns that having friends has its advantages.

1482546,A1PJX7Y2V3SICE,B005LAII62,AndreaF,"[37, 51]","After seeing ParaNorman yesterday at the base theater, I have to say that I'm kind of surprised that there is such a controversy over the ""message"" of this movie.  First, I don't think there was any type of nefarious message; the only message I gleaned from watching this movie was the usual ""don't judge others"" and ""we're all different, we're all special"" type of thing.  Those are messages with which I agree.  In fact, my husband and I instilled what ethics, morals and beliefs we felt were appropriate for our children with the hope that they would be productive members of society and independent thinkers.  Doing such has made us confident that they are able to assess different situations and make good decisions on their own, regardless of what movies they watch, or books they read, etc.In other words, we're pretty confident that they can watch a children's movie and still retain what we've taught them.That said, I thought the movie was pretty good.  I was kind of creeped out at some of the animation, which was very unique and well done.  Some of the storyline was a bit dark, but I agree with other reviewers who noted that the darkness probably went over the heads of most children.  Also, at this point I should admit that I was initially hesitant to take our daughter because I thought the premise had something to do with demons, but after looking up reviews and listening to my husband, I was wrong.  My husband will now probably print out that last sentence and frame it, especially since he's the one who was... not... wrong.  Erg!!Anyway, moving swiftly along --In my opinion, ""ParaNorman"" is a Halloween-type children's movie, and was enjoyable.  I liked that Norman was able to overcome his own fear and do the right thing, in the face of majority opposition.  Courage is always an asset.I also laughed quite a bit at the jokes and writing, which was definitely rated PG.  The children in the theater reacted well to the funny parts, and you could hear a pin drop whenever there was a dramatic crescendo.  No one wept with terror, and there were children from infant-teen age range present.  Our 11-year-old daughter thought it was great, and by the time we hit the parking lot she had moved on to begging for ice cream.ParaNorman had great animation, good writing, and was entertaining.

Now, I myself don't necessarily buy into this oversimplified concept myself, at least in real life.  After all, I don't know how forgiving I would be if I were tried and convicted of a crime that I hadn't committed, and then hanged for it.  Just sayin'.Not to be too cynical, but that's not the point of the film, of course.  The point is, if someone in Hollywood wants to make a film - supposedly for a younger audience - that filmmaker must make a film that has some nice little Hallmark message inside.  And ""Paranorman"" surely provides that message, buy it or not, and so therefore, it becomes palatable for sugarcoated American audiences that are always craving for something overly sweet.Am I complaining, you might be tempted to ask?  Well, I'm probably complaining more about American audiences than the film.  After all, it is American audiences that drive filmmaking which creates movies such as this.  So I think that you need to remember this before going in to this seemingly Rudolph-inspired film.  You've got the outcast youngster, bullied because he's different:  that would be Norman instead of Rudolph.  You've got the love interest doe:  the young girl aluded to in the first paragraph (but I can't remember her name) instead of Clarice.  And you've got the bullies:  plenty of those to go around in both movies.And you just know going in that the bullied kid will make good at the end.  Yes, this film might be just viewed as a retread of so many other kids movies with basically the same plot line, and to a degree that's true.  But it is repackaged in a pretty funny way, ala ""Sixth Sense"" style I guess.  This time with ghosts that aren't really so scary.  They were just scared themselves, at least when they were human.I did like this film, with a few caveats, as I have discussed.  So I will give this a mild recommendation.

Even though its box office success wasn't nearly as impressive as it should have been and you rarely hear anyone bring it up whenever conversations turn to animated films, ""Coraline"" catered to both children and adults. It had this extremely dark undertone; children were having their eyes replaced with buttons. That's so gloriously morbid for a children's flick. There was also mild cursing, a creepy alternate world where everyone had a mirror self (with button eyes, of course), and a woman with a massive chest that was only covered by sea shells in one particular scene. It was just so unusual and extraordinary. Laika Entertainment, the studio behind ""Coraline,"" has brought us ""ParaNorman,"" which is certainly in the same vein and travels a similar path to greatness.""ParaNorman"" is a stop-motion animated film that revolves around Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee); a young boy who can talk to dead people and is ridiculed because of it. Even his family doesn't believe in his gift, especially his dad Perry (Jeff Garlin) who refuses to think outside the box and gets angry at things he doesn't understand. Norman is picked on everyday by a thick-headed bully named Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is mostly a loner until he gets to know a red headed boy named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied just as much as Norman but has learned to turn the other cheek.A strange man named Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) claims to share Norman's gift and under a strange set of circumstances passes the duty of keeping the witch's curse at bay for another year to Norman. Now in a race against time, Norman finds himself with a group of unlikely allies including Neil's meathead brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) and Norman's ditzy sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) as he tries to save the town from uncertain doom and a zombie takeover.""ParaNorman"" treads a thin line between something that's appropriate for the whole family and only being suitable for a teenage or more mature audience, but if you didn't have a problem with the content in ""Rango"" or ""Coraline"" then it shouldn't be much of a problem here. The word ""hell"" is used more than once and Norman's grandma calls Perry a ""jackass"" at one point. It hints at more mature themes, as well. Perry calls Norman's gift ""limp wristed hippy garbage"" and a certain male character mentions having a boyfriend late in the film. Norman's sister Courtney is very gifted in the posterior region and there are many jokes that make use of that or could be considered innuendo. It's kind of glorious, really. Fans of animation will be in heaven.There's obviously a big horror influence, as well; particularly classic zombie films, ""Halloween,"" and ""Friday the 13th."" So the film not only caters to animation fans, but also horror hounds. There are a ton of throwbacks, jokes about brains, and zombies with flesh hanging from their decayed bones. The imagery is just as exceptional; intimidating houses, gloomy forests, and a heavy use of shadows and lack of lighting. ""ParaNorman"" is just the right amount of homage, humor, and animation.""ParaNorman"" isn't quite as original or as dark as ""Coraline,"" but it's still extremely entertaining for most ages and one of the best animated films of the year. The emphasis on witchcraft results in a rather peculiar final act, but is still very enjoyable. ""ParaNorman"" is brilliantly animated with an amazing cast and clever writing. It's the animated film horror fans have been waiting for and the one ""Frankenweenie"" is probably aiming to be.There's a brief scene after the credits that's really interesting; you see how the model for Norman was made along with how much detail goes into a stop-motion animated picture.",5,Amusing animation for the horror fan in all of us,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,3734,"['Coraline', 'was', 'amazing', 'Even', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'impressive', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rarely', 'hear', 'anyone', 'bring', 'up', 'whenever', 'conversations', 'turn', 'animated', 'films', 'Coraline', 'catered', 'children', 'adults', 'had', 'extremely', 'dark', 'undertone', 'children', 'were', 'having', 'eyes', 'replaced', 'buttons', 'so', 'gloriously', 'morbid', 'children', 'flick', 'was', 'also', 'mild', 'cursing', 'creepy', 'alternate', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'had', 'mirror', 'self', 'button', 'eyes', 'course', 'woman', 'massive', 'chest', 'was', 'only', 'covered', 'sea', 'shells', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'unusual', 'extraordinary', 'Laika', 'Entertainment', 'studio', 'Coraline', 'brought', 'ParaNorman', 'certainly', 'same', 'vein', 'travels', 'similar', 'path', 'greatness', 'ParaNorman', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'film', 'Norman', 'voiced', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'can', 'talk', 'dead', 'people', 'ridiculed', 'Even', 'family', ""n't"", 'believe', 'gift', 'especially', 'dad', 'Perry', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'who', 'think', 'box', 'angry', 'things', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Norman', 'picked', 'everyday', 'thick-headed', 'bully', 'named', 'Alvin', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'mostly', 'loner', 'know', 'red', 'headed', 'boy', 'named', 'Neil', 'Tucker', 'Albrizzi', 'who', 'bullied', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Norman', 'learned', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek.A', 'strange', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Prenderghast', 'John', 'Goodman', 'share', 'Norman', 'gift', 'strange', 'set', 'circumstances', 'duty', 'keeping', 'witch', 'curse', 'bay', 'year', 'Norman', 'Now', 'race', 'time', 'Norman', 'group', 'unlikely', 'allies', 'including', 'Neil', 'meathead', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Norman', 'ditzy', 'sister', 'Courtney', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'save', 'town', 'uncertain', 'doom', 'zombie', 'takeover', 'ParaNorman', 'thin', 'line', 'something', 'appropriate', 'whole', 'family', 'only', 'being', 'suitable', 'teenage', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'content', 'Rango', 'Coraline', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'problem', 'here', 'word', 'hell', 'used', 'more', 'once', 'Norman', 'grandma', 'Perry', 'jackass', 'one', 'point', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'Perry', 'Norman', 'gift', 'limp', 'wristed', 'hippy', 'garbage', 'certain', 'male', 'character', 'mentions', 'having', 'boyfriend', 'late', 'film', 'Norman', 'sister', 'Courtney', 'very', 'gifted', 'posterior', 'region', 'are', 'many', 'jokes', 'make', 'use', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'innuendo', 'kind', 'glorious', 'really', 'Fans', 'animation', 'will', 'be', 'obviously', 'big', 'horror', 'influence', 'well', 'particularly', 'classic', 'zombie', 'films', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'caters', 'animation', 'fans', 'also', 'horror', 'hounds', 'are', 'ton', 'throwbacks', 'jokes', 'brains', 'zombies', 'flesh', 'hanging', 'decayed', 'bones', 'imagery', 'just', 'exceptional', 'intimidating', 'houses', 'gloomy', 'forests', 'heavy', 'use', 'shadows', 'lack', 'lighting', 'ParaNorman', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'homage', 'humor', 'animation', 'ParaNorman', ""n't"", 'quite', 'original', 'as', 'dark', 'Coraline', 'still', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'most', 'ages', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'year', 'emphasis', 'witchcraft', 'results', 'rather', 'peculiar', 'final', 'act', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'ParaNorman', 'brilliantly', 'animated', 'amazing', 'cast', 'clever', 'writing', 'animated', 'film', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'one', 'Frankenweenie', 'probably', 'aiming', 'be.There', 'brief', 'scene', 'credits', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'model', 'Norman', 'was', 'made', 'how', 'much', 'detail', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'picture']",ParaNorman

So, along comes ParaNorman from Laika productions.  This got our attention, so we rented it from RedBox.  I am glad that's all we did.  It started off promising enough.  Here's a kid who can see and speak to dead people (yup, just like The Sixth Sense).  He is picked on by the fellow kids (yup, The Sixth Sense again).  He then befriends a fat, nerdy kid (a touch of Frankenweenie perhaps).  From there, it gets confusing on the his goal to put the witch to sleep or something.  It also goes on way too long - makes for a boring movie overall.What I thought was the most disgusting part of the movie.  Yes, it is a spoiler, but other parents (who have the same opinion of the homosexual choice of lifestyle as I do) need to be aware of this.  There is a bimbo-esque girl who is hot for the fat, nerdy kid's big brother.  She hits on him all through the movie.  Towards the end, we were expecting him to finally go for her.  Instead, he says, ""you should really meet my boyfriend.  He is all into these chick flicks"" or something like that.

Unfortunately, turning off the movie at this point was kind of moot, but we did it never the less.Don't rent this movie.

1482605,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B005LAII62,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[4, 15]","IF you've ever had the misfortune of stumbling over one of my reviews, you'd know what an animation geek I am, particularly stop-motion animation as well as anything scary.  I'm all for any film that pushes the art in order to preserve its existence in this CGI world of entertainment.  Laika Studio has been the standard bearer of feature film stop-motion since being contracted to work on ""Corpse Bride"" (2005), so I'm pretty much in favor of them making any film.  However and sadly, ""ParaNorman"" misses the mark on some key attributes.  Let me dismember the details.-HOW ABOUT THAT CREEPY STOP-MOTION?I've always said that if you want something to look creepy, use stop-motion.  Not surprisingly, most recent stop-motion films have had dark and scary themes (""Corpse Bride"", ""Coralline"").  Though Laika has yet to match the quality of their work in ""Corpse Bride"", they do a very good job of bringing their dolls to life.  They've also pioneered the melding of computer graphics with stop-motion to great effect.  This makes ""ParaNorman"" a visual treat that animation geeks can enjoy despite the other problems this film has.-BUILDING CHARACTERWithout listing the entire roster of characters, it should suffice to say that lack of good characters is not a problem for this film.  These are characters that are easy to identify with and to invest emotions in.  Despite the relatively large number of characters in ""ParaNorman"", they all are developed appropriately enough for their roles in the film.  Some of them I thought were great while others, though well developed, just didn't do much to excite me.  A well developed character will only count for so much if the story doesn't give them something interesting to do.-A STORY WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCESUnlike ""Coraline"", ""ParaNorman"" lacks a cohesive and riveting story.  The story often trailed off task or mood.  Sometimes the humor seemed out of context with events taking place.  Sometimes things got very serious when maybe they should have been lighter.  And all along I had this feeling that I'd seen most of this before.  In fact, ""ParaNorman"" was disappointingly unoriginal and derivative.  Kids who see dead people, misunderstood Zombies, and a mob of the living who does the misunderstanding are hardly fresh concepts.  To make matters worse, Laika really failed to decide on who its audience was going to be.  This is probably too scary for many young children yet not scary enough to satisfy older kids.  A Stop-motion kid film might not be the best place to discuss concepts of human sexuality either.  I think the fact that this has been a disappointment at the box office is testimony to that.  That's bad news for us stop-motion fans.-WILL THIS WITCH FLOAT?It's hard for me to say bad things about a stop-motion feature film.  I'm such a huge fan of the art form.  That's why it was so disappointing to leave the theater with my family unsatisfied.  I loved a lot about this film.  Some moments were highly memorable and entertaining.  The animation was pretty darn good.  The subject matter was right up my alley.  But when you invest so much time and effort into an art form that stands on the brink of obsoleteness (heaven forbid!), shouldn't you take the time to get the story right?  Shouldn't you be just a little cognizant of who your audience is going to be?  I really was excited to see this film.  It saddens me that Laika kind of blew it.-Stop-motion..........4.5 stars-Characters.............4.5 stars-Story.......................2.5 stars-Family friendly.....2.2 starsAverage...................3.4 stars",3,Standard Bearer of Stop-motion Drops the Ball.,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,3588,"['IF', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'misfortune', 'stumbling', 'one', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'know', 'what', 'animation', 'geek', 'am', 'particularly', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'scary', ""'m"", 'film', 'art', 'order', 'preserve', 'existence', 'CGI', 'world', 'entertainment', 'Laika', 'Studio', 'been', 'standard', 'bearer', 'feature', 'film', 'stop-motion', 'being', 'contracted', 'work', 'Corpse', 'Bride', '2005', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'favor', 'making', 'film', 'However', 'sadly', 'ParaNorman', 'mark', 'key', 'attributes', 'Let', 'dismember', 'details.-HOW', 'CREEPY', 'STOP-MOTION', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'want', 'something', 'look', 'creepy', 'use', 'stop-motion', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'most', 'recent', 'stop-motion', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'dark', 'scary', 'themes', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'Coralline', 'Though', 'Laika', 'yet', 'match', 'quality', 'work', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'dolls', 'life', ""'ve"", 'also', 'pioneered', 'melding', 'computer', 'graphics', 'stop-motion', 'great', 'effect', 'ParaNorman', 'visual', 'treat', 'animation', 'geeks', 'can', 'enjoy', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'has.-BUILDING', 'CHARACTERWithout', 'listing', 'entire', 'roster', 'characters', 'should', 'suffice', 'say', 'lack', 'good', 'characters', 'not', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'identify', 'invest', 'emotions', 'relatively', 'large', 'number', 'characters', 'ParaNorman', 'are', 'developed', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'roles', 'film', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'others', 'though', 'well', 'developed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'excite', 'well', 'developed', 'character', 'will', 'only', 'count', 'so', 'much', 'story', ""n't"", 'give', 'something', 'interesting', 'do.-A', 'STORY', 'WITH', 'GRAVE', 'CONSEQUENCESUnlike', 'Coraline', 'ParaNorman', 'cohesive', 'riveting', 'story', 'story', 'often', 'trailed', 'off', 'task', 'mood', 'humor', 'seemed', 'context', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'got', 'very', 'serious', 'when', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lighter', 'had', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'seen', 'most', 'before', 'fact', 'ParaNorman', 'was', 'disappointingly', 'unoriginal', 'derivative', 'Kids', 'who', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'misunderstood', 'Zombies', 'mob', 'living', 'who', 'misunderstanding', 'are', 'hardly', 'fresh', 'concepts', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Laika', 'really', 'failed', 'decide', 'who', 'audience', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'probably', 'too', 'scary', 'many', 'young', 'children', 'yet', 'not', 'scary', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'older', 'kids', 'Stop-motion', 'kid', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'place', 'discuss', 'concepts', 'human', 'sexuality', 'either', 'think', 'fact', 'been', 'disappointment', 'box', 'office', 'testimony', 'bad', 'news', 'stop-motion', 'fans.-WILL', 'THIS', 'WITCH', 'FLOAT', 'hard', 'say', 'bad', 'things', 'stop-motion', 'feature', 'film', ""'m"", 'such', 'huge', 'fan', 'art', 'form', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'disappointing', 'leave', 'theater', 'family', 'unsatisfied', 'loved', 'lot', 'film', 'moments', 'were', 'highly', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'animation', 'was', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'right', 'alley', 'when', 'invest', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'art', 'form', 'brink', 'obsoleteness', 'heaven', 'forbid', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'get', 'story', 'right', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'little', 'cognizant', 'who', 'audience', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'Laika', 'kind', 'blew', 'it.-Stop-motion', 'stars-Characters', 'stars-Story', 'stars-Family', 'friendly', '..2.2', 'starsAverage', '.3.4', 'stars']",ParaNorman

Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 4]","PARANORMAN has caused a certain degree of controversy among parents in search of children's fare, so you should know upfront that this is not a movie that pre-schoolers will take kindly.  Young children are likely to find it too frightening and the references obscure.  It's really more of a pre-teen-and-up sort of flick.  That said, it's a fun, unpretentious little movie with some of the best stop-motion animation I've seen in a long time, and while I wouldn't put it in the same league as THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of times more.The story focuses on bullying, a deservedly hot topic.  Norman Babcock is your average kid except for one thing: he can see and talk to dead people.  His mother attempts to be understanding a new-agey sort of way; his father is in explosive disbelief; his teen-age, cell-phone-addicted sister Courtney finds the whole thing embarassing.  But there is one person who believes him: his peculiar Uncle Prederghast, who believes it because he can do it himself.  For most of life Uncle Prederghast has been guarding a secret, and it has something to do with the town's history, which includes an unsavory story of a dangerous witch, a curse, and the living dead.  But Uncle Prederghast is getting old, and he's eager to pass on responsibility to Norman.Throughout the film characters bully each other frequently--but then find themselves in the wrong, and most often discover their bullying is based on a fear of what they do not understand.  Of particular interest is the notion that bullying is something that is passed along: you bully me, I bully the next kid, and so on.  This being a movie (as opposed to real life), all the characters (including zombies and the evil witch) learn to break the cycle.  Along the way we have references to SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO (those meddling kids!), MARS ATTACKS (the scurrying hand), HALLOWEEN (cell phone music), and FRIDAY THE 13TH (hockey mask.)  A lot of the fun of the film is in recognizing these, so ""movie nerds"" are likely to enjoy it more than others will.The movie was originally released in 3D on the big screen, and I suspect it played better in that format than it does on DVD.

1482621,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B005LAII62,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[3, 9]","The stop-motion animation is great, very well done technically, but ... this movie is really quite slow, tedious and not that interesting for adults, although it had an interesting start. Turns out there are maybe less than half a dozen funny bits (the best of which was the guy waiting for the vending machine to dispense his chips while Zombies are advancing on him - that was funny). It is really tailored to kids who will be amused by the animation, although they may be scared by the really angry witch girl - those scenes may be too intense for younger kids. But I was quite disappointed in the mostly uninspired action and overall plot. The van chase in the middle was blah. So why did RottenTomatoes (RT) give it an incredible 86% positive rating?There is actually an interesting message apart from the usual ""don't hate me because I'm different"". Norman pleads with one character not to give in to the same anger and hatred which she experienced. This is interesting in a time where ""peaceful"" and ""tolerant"" folks are publicly calling for death or violence upon people who simply disagree with them - calling for global warming deniers to be executed (or blown up, in a now-famous ad), or for the NRA leadership's heads on pikes, or hinting that corporate CEOs should be assassinated (all just in good fun, of course). Kudos to the writers for daring to include this message, although it probably falls on deaf ears.This movie is somewhat about the Salem witch trials. You may want to read up on the actual history (not ""pop"" history) of it to be able to answer questions about it. Be aware, though, that Hollywood portrayals of it are usually overblown. Less than 40 were executed for witchcraft in the States, at the height of the hysteria, unlike in Europe, where the calming power of the Church was absent to curb the epidemic. (Yes, it was the Church - ironically, the Spanish Inquisition! - that brought sanity and skepticism to the widespread charges of witchcraft.)Oh, and true to the stern dictates of Hollywood, there is a gay kid, although you don't find out until the end. Whether this makes it ""family friendly"" is up to you, but there it is. It's not a big part of the movie, though - more like a punch line.On the whole, for a 86% RT rating, it's quite a disappointment.

One kind of movie my wife and I can both agree on watching together is a good animated movie, and I felt that perhaps my wife would like this movie.  A guy I talked to on the day I bought this told asked me if we liked movies like Frankenweenie, Coraline, Corpse Bride, and Nightmare Before Christmas and I told him that we did.  He said that then that we would probably rather like this movie, and sure enough we did.It really did have that kind of Tim Burton/Henry Sellick kind of feel to it, although it was created and directed by different people, some who actually worked with Henry Sellick on Coraline.  We both like that kind of animation as well as like Dreamworks, Disney, and Pixar type stuff.  ParaNorman was fun, whitty, and entertainingly scary in a few parts...just all around entertaining my wife and I thought.The one thing I will say is that if your child is real young, I'd say under the age of 7, this film may not exactly be suitable for them.  There is some parts in this movie that would probably scare them, plus there is a small amount of mild language.  There is one reference a male character makes late in the movie about having a boyfriend, but decide on that however you will.  I'd say it's okay for kids 7 and up though.  Use your best judgment.

This stop-motion animated film pulls in some surprisingly fantastic 3-D effects, and not like some other films that were probably just converted to 3-D instead.Norman is a clairvoyant young boy in a small mountain town in Massachusetts who can see and hear the spirits of the dead. His family ignore this, and his ability to talk to the dead doesn't make the butt of everyone's jokes at school. However, his ridiculed uncle who can also see the dead warns him that the town will come under a witch's curse from three hundred years ago where those who sentenced her to death will rise from the grave. Norman talks his only friend in school, the resident fat kid Neil, plus Norman's agonizing sister Courtney, and Neil's jock older brother Mitch, and the school bully Alvin who frequently torments Norman into helping him stop this zombie uprising. After trying to use a storybook his now deceased uncle warned him about to try and coax the spirit of the witch back to rest again. This fails though, and the undead rise on their small town, although the zombies are just a few number with ability to turn others into zombies, and the rest of the townsfolk react with hilarious circumstances. Norman soon realizes that the witch that caused this was really an innocent young girl from centuries ago who was sentenced to death because she to could speak to the dead. Norman manages to convince the ghost into seeking her eternal rest and not going for revenge. She concedes, and Norman is then praised by the town, and is accepted by his family for his &#34;gift&#34; too.I was very impressed with the dark tones this movie was willing to take, and how social acceptance can shape a community, even in a small town. The animation is even more groundbreaking than what was done in Coraline by bringing the story into a larger setting with more characters to add to the mix and a larger plot. A great yarn for the whole family, especially at Halloween.",4,Paranormally fantastic!,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,2065,"['Laika', 'creators', 'Coraline', 'released', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'successor', 'real', 'homage', '70s', 'horror', 'movies', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'film', 'pulls', 'surprisingly', 'fantastic', '3-D', 'effects', 'not', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'probably', 'just', 'converted', '3-D', 'instead.Norman', 'clairvoyant', 'young', 'boy', 'small', 'mountain', 'town', 'Massachusetts', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'spirits', 'dead', 'family', 'ignore', 'ability', 'talk', 'dead', ""n't"", 'make', 'butt', 'everyone', 'jokes', 'school', 'However', 'ridiculed', 'uncle', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'dead', 'town', 'will', 'come', 'witch', 'curse', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'where', 'who', 'sentenced', 'death', 'will', 'rise', 'grave', 'Norman', 'only', 'friend', 'school', 'resident', 'fat', 'kid', 'Neil', 'Norman', 'agonizing', 'sister', 'Courtney', 'Neil', 'jock', 'older', 'brother', 'Mitch', 'school', 'bully', 'Alvin', 'who', 'frequently', 'Norman', 'helping', 'stop', 'zombie', 'uprising', 'trying', 'use', 'storybook', 'now', 'deceased', 'uncle', 'warned', 'try', 'coax', 'spirit', 'witch', 'back', 'rest', 'again', 'undead', 'rise', 'small', 'town', 'zombies', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'number', 'ability', 'turn', 'others', 'zombies', 'rest', 'townsfolk', 'react', 'hilarious', 'circumstances', 'Norman', 'soon', 'witch', 'caused', 'was', 'really', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'centuries', 'who', 'was', 'sentenced', 'death', 'could', 'speak', 'dead', 'Norman', 'convince', 'ghost', 'seeking', 'eternal', 'rest', 'not', 'going', 'revenge', 'Norman', 'then', 'praised', 'town', 'accepted', 'family', '34', 'gift', '34', 'too.I', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'dark', 'movie', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'how', 'social', 'acceptance', 'can', 'shape', 'community', 'even', 'small', 'town', 'animation', 'even', 'more', 'groundbreaking', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'Coraline', 'bringing', 'story', 'larger', 'setting', 'more', 'characters', 'add', 'mix', 'larger', 'plot', 'great', 'yarn', 'whole', 'family', 'especially', 'Halloween']",ParaNorman

Visually, the film is stunning. There is some serious stylization going on in the character design that looks really weird in still images, but when the characters are in motion, it doesn't matter. There's a pretty cool sequence at the end that's a smooth marriage of stop-motion and CGI. It looks amazing!The story follows a little boy named Norman who has the strange ability to see ghosts and speak to them. Apparently, people have heard and he's teased for it, even his own father wanting him to just be normal.Norman is befriended by another social outcast, a young kid named Neil who's fat. Norman doesn't really want a friend, but Neil doesn't mind Norman's oddball gift and even wants to see if Norman can help him play with his recently deceased dog. (&#34;He was hit by an animal rescue vehicle. Tragic and ironic.&#34;)However, Norman's uncle pops up on the scene. Something bad is about to happen and Norman needs to be told: the dead are coming! It's tied to the Witch's Curse of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts: a witch was being tried and cursed her accusers to death and to rise again.To keep her curse at bay, someone with the gift of seeing and speaking with the dead (like Norman, his uncle, and as we can later see, the witch herself: the gift is subtly noted in character design with hexagon-shaped pupils and irises) must read from a book at her grave before sundown once a year. Norman's uncle was doing this, but dies before he can tell Norman what to do, but when he tells him posthumously, he doesn't give him enough details.As Norman tries to read the book at the old graveyard, he's too late as the seven accusers of the witch rise from the dead.With zombies invading the town of Blithe Hollow, it's up to Norman, Neil, Norman's sister Courtney, Neil's brother Mitch, and school bully Alvin to put the witch's curse at bay again: for now and always.&#34;ParaNorman&#34; is a wildly fun, mildly creepy movie with a great message about being non-discriminatory. It's a great film for getting you in the mood for Halloween.I picked up the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack, and was impressed that the DVD and Blu-Ray contained the same special features on both discs.

1482638,A1QHW2L0RU54QQ,B005LAII62,jeheist,"[3, 5]","Recently watched movie review:*ParaNorman (2012)- 4/5ParaNorman is a stop-motion comedy thriller from animation company, LAIKA. A boy named Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is able to see and speak with the dead. Nobody in town believes that he can see and hear ghosts, and kids make fun of his gift. Norman makes a friend, Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi), who believes Norman can see and speak with ghosts. The two boys are confronted by Norman's Uncle, Mr. Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman), who tells Norman that he must be the one who has to save the town from the witch by reading a book at the witches grave.ParaNorman has a very unique look throughout the film, and when you finally see those zombies, you may not be scared at all by them. Human characters look oddly shaped and just plain weird, which makes the zombies seem less scary, which I'm fine with as kids may not be so scared of them when they finally see them. The dialogue is very well written and both kids and adults will be pleased, although, ParaNorman is not a movie that I would take my child to go see. There are many stereotypes portrayed throughout the film, and the script is geared a little bit more toward adult humor. ParaNorman doesn't have the best storyline, but that's okay as I was just waiting for the next great dialogue line.The visuals are wonderful, the dialogue is fantastic, but there's something lacking in the film that makes me want to watch this another time; overall it's the poor storyline. Most kids and adults will like ParaNorman, but in my opinion, adults should be aware that it's a more adult oriented movie. I saw ParaNorman in 2D, and since it's already a dark movie with not much noticeable 3D parts, I would suggest sticking with 2D. I can't recommend ParaNorman enough; it's a good film that deserves a highly recommended 'rent.'",4,Recently watched movie review: ParaNorman (2012),1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1863,"['Recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'review', '*ParaNorman', '2012', '4/5ParaNorman', 'stop-motion', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'animation', 'company', 'LAIKA', 'A', 'boy', 'named', 'Norman', 'Babcock', 'voiced', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'able', 'see', 'speak', 'dead', 'Nobody', 'town', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'ghosts', 'kids', 'make', 'fun', 'gift', 'Norman', 'friend', 'Neil', 'Downe', 'voiced', 'Tucker', 'Albrizzi', 'who', 'Norman', 'can', 'see', 'speak', 'ghosts', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'confronted', 'Norman', 'Uncle', 'Mr.', 'Prenderghast', 'voiced', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'Norman', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'save', 'town', 'witch', 'reading', 'book', 'witches', 'grave.ParaNorman', 'very', 'unique', 'look', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'zombies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'Human', 'characters', 'look', 'oddly', 'shaped', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'zombies', 'seem', 'less', 'scary', ""'m"", 'fine', 'kids', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'scared', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'dialogue', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'ParaNorman', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'child', 'go', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'portrayed', 'film', 'script', 'geared', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'adult', 'humor', 'ParaNorman', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'storyline', 'okay', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'next', 'great', 'dialogue', 'line.The', 'visuals', 'are', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'fantastic', 'something', 'lacking', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'time', 'overall', 'poor', 'storyline', 'Most', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'like', 'ParaNorman', 'opinion', 'adults', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'more', 'adult', 'oriented', 'movie', 'saw', 'ParaNorman', '2D', 'already', 'dark', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'noticeable', '3D', 'parts', 'would', 'suggest', 'sticking', '2D', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'ParaNorman', 'enough', 'good', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', ""'rent""]",ParaNorman

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[0, 0]","ParaNorman Bowling for Movies Score: 224.438 of 300What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]ParaNorman - we own the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet copy (we like to have our bases covered HA!)Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):A basically normal boy in a positively ordinary small town finds himself to be un-normal and the town in a positively unordinary situation... you see Norman can see and speak with the dead.  Yup, that's right he and his shirt size are the same - a medium!  As the town readies for its 300th anniversary Norman begins to be haunted by spooky visions making him the butt of the school's jokes and an easy target for the local bully, Alvin.  Finding keeping to himself to be less complicated, Norman attempts to be a lone wolf but fortunately the other schoolyard reject, Neil (a perpetual glass-half-full kind of guy, and frankly an inspiration to just being nice fanatics everywhere) befriends him and totally accepts Norman's ""quirks"".  As the story unfolds we learn that Norman isn't the only medium in the family - his ""nutty"" weird guy uncle has the gift and a dark secret about the local legend of the much celebrated witch's curse.  It seems generations of Norman's family have been keeping the dark magic of the witch at bay.  When his uncle suddenly dies, Norman must pick up the reins and help the town (which has done nothing but ridicule and make fun of him).  Will Norman and his band of misfit friends save the town and remove the curse forever????  Buy or rent this little gem of a flick to find out!What I loved:~ What a wonderful blend of artistic expressions - CGI, sure, but also stop motion animation, and get this - they used an emerging technology to make the puppets - 3D printing, how cool is that?  The end product is seamless and beautiful.~ The script was a throw-back to earlier horror flicks and has some genuinely suspenseful and scary parts (a warning to parents with very young children, this might be a little too scary for little ones - we'd watch it first if Little Movie Dude was younger just to make sure it was ok).~ The 3D effects were well used and blended into the movie completely - I actually forgot it was in 3D as I was totally immersed into Norman's world.~ Positive messages abound: from Neil's ever-present positive spin and can do attitude, Norman's willingness to let by-gones-be-by-gones to save his home town, Norman's mother who always is the voice of reason and a grade ""A"" peacekeeper, and a touching moment with his ghost of a grandmother who offers kind words of encouragement in a moment of fear... wonderful!Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

Stop-motion animation is generally not my favorite medium when it comes to movies, although I do respect the time and dedication such a process takes.  The fact that this movie came out around the same time as ""Frankenweenie"" and ""Hotel Transylvania"" probably didn't help -- too many similar-seeming movies at one time, I suppose.  But in the end, I decided to give it a shot, and brought it home from our library.Despite not being a zombie fan, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie.  It's hilarious, spooky without being gory, and has a much-needed message beneath the silly antics.""ParaNorman"" is the story of Norman, a young boy from the town of Blithe Hollow who can speak to the dead... and is ostracized for his abilities by both his family and his schoolmates.  When his crazy uncle, the only family member he's on speaking terms with, dies and entrusts him with the family duty to keep the spirit of a vengeful witch sealed away (yes, in that order), Norman is at first skeptical.  But when the witch's power brings a group of zombies to life and threatens to destroy the town, Norman has to rely on some unlikely help -- his loser friend Niel, Niel's dumb jock older brother Mitch, his cheerleader sister Courtney, and school bully Alvin -- to end the curse.  He soon discovers that all is not what it seems on this quest, and that fear can be the greatest evil of all.Created by the makers of ""Coraline,"" the attention to detail in this film is phenomenal, especially given that much of it is stop-motion instead of CGI.  (My brother even forgot at points that he wasn't watching a CGI film.)  The character designs are not pretty, but they are unique and fit the quirky style of the movie, a nice change from most CGI films where most of the characters look like the same plastic dolls repeated ad nauseum.  The film is quite atmospheric as well, capturing the feel of a New England autumn remarkably well, and the night scenes are especially creepy and well-done.The story, while it falls into some of the usual horror clich&eacute;s (the ostracized kid with a special ability, the dumb but helpful sidekick friend, the brainless jock and cheerleader, the ignorant townsfolk), does manage to turn some of the horror tropes on their heads.  The zombies are perhaps the best example of this... but I won't say any more so as not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie.  And while it can be effectively creepy at times, it's also side-splittingly funny, and kept surprising our family as it went along.  And as mentioned above, it carries a message about acceptance and fear that's much-needed in this day and age.Word of warning -- this movie is rated PG, and it milks that rating for all it's worth.

The story and effects are a bit morbid and might be too extreme for anyone under seven years old.  If someone has a problem with dark stuff or Halloween, then you may want to steer clear of this.

1482675,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAII62,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[7, 12]","Writer and Co-Director Chris Butler (storyboardist on Coraline and Corpse Bride) has given us a unique vision of a common situation in this 3D Stop-Motion animation film. Judging people can cause you to make bad decisions -because not learning the truth and fearing what you don't know can be harmful. How?Butler says, ""I wanted to do a story where there are no real bad guys, just characters making bad decisions based on their own personal fears."" His Co-Director Sam Fell (Flushed Away, The Tale of Despereaux) also says, ""This film is about real characters in an extraordinary situations. We all know of the everyday bully that you fear more than monsters in a scary movie or in your closet!""Focus features production, released under the Universal Pictures distribution, of Paranorman is a story about a very special boy who has the ability to talk to ghosts of the deceased who have certain `business' yet to finish before they move on. This makes him odd and different to both his family and his classmates. What he learns in the end, as everyone in the town does, is that nothing is what it appears to be. And making decisions, without giving someone a chance or learning about them, can lead you to make bad and sometimes `deadly' decisions.The story has a few slow points, but there is great humor between the two buddies Norman, voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In, The Road) and his overweight buddy Neil, voiced by Tucker Albrizzi (Mike & Molly, Brothers & Sisters). Some of the most hysterical commentary comes from Norman's sister Courtney, voiced by Anna Kendrick (Twilight, Up In the Air). Now add your bully/blockhead character named Alvin, voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, How To Train Your Dragon) and you have your typical neighborhood gang! There's even a `Jock' with a twist (at the end) named Mitch, brother of Neil, voiced by Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone, Good Will Hunting).Norman has his work cut out for himself because he is dealing with a curse from a 300-year-old witch placed on Norman's town. And this witch, who turns out to be exactly something you would never expect - a miss judged little girl - has a surprise of her own. She is voiced perfectly by Jodelle Ferland (Stargate, Seed).The movie also has such great talents as John Goodman (The Artist, Monster's Inc.) as a `ghostly' crazy uncle; Elaine Stritch (30 Rock, Monster-In-Law) as a `ghostly' grandma with a big heart; Bernard Hill (Titanic, Lord of the Rings) as a regretful `ghostly' Judge from 300 years ago; and Tempestt Bledsoe (The Cosby Show, Dance Till Dawn) as an irreverent but determined police officer - who is not a ghost!Norman's parents, a very supportive mother Sarah voiced by Leslie Mann (17 Again, Knocked Up), and a not so supportive father Perry voiced by Jeff Garlin (Wall*E, Curb Your Enthusiasm), confuse Norman more than help him.The film is extremely colorful and creative in production design done by the artistic vision of Nelson Lowry (Fantastic Mr. Fox). The stop-motion animation is fluid and fun and the ultimate in greatly detailed set construction and props, including some inside jokes. Look at the brand name of the underwear of Mitch the `Jock' brother of Neil is wearing.This movie is funny and has some great scenes between the family members and a visually stunning confrontation with ""The Witch"" and Norman that ends with an heart-warming resolution of compassion and respect. As the director, Chris also states, ""I hope people see this film as a fun family adventure....it might not be so scary to the young ones because it's your basic kid vs. bully situation.

It was a beautifully, animated movie from the minds of people who are gifted in their craft to bring us this spooky (kind of), funny, heart-warming comedy of the 2012 year. I loved Paranorman because it had a lot of good morals in it.1. Mob Mentality- We see this in every society, a group of people who have stopped actually ""thinking"" and decided to just play ""follow the leader"" when throughout history it has always lead to heartbreak, destruction, mayhem, violence, and other ignorant and primitive behavior.2. Killing of the Innocence- To not go into too much detail so that I do not spoil the movie, this movie showed the importance of thinking before one acts. As many spiritual ethics like Buddhism,teaches, to not act or speak when your heart is tainted or bitter. Also, to not judge so quickly with what you are afraid of. Many human beings unfortunately suffer from being afraid of ""The Unknown"" which gets them into a lot of trouble for their actions. Karma is real! The Golden Rule(s) apply to all! Just because you are afraid of something does not mean that you have to act violently, or primitively upon that situation. ""One must think first before they act or speak""3.ParaNormanI love this movie for all of its moral issues. I will not go into detail! I would rather have many more people watch this movie and enjoy it as I did and come away from it thinking for themselves more, because they have seen how horrid, and primitive their actions can become when one thinks that using fire against fire will work... it does not and it never will!A BIG AND HUGE THANK YOU!!!!!

Well, dead everything, if you include pets and other animals. Pretty sad state of affairs when a once iconic shocker becomes a B-Movie and derivative TV show staple, itself a pathos-laden testament. Unfortunately, this premise also leads to several rather troubling questions which I won't address here.Norman lives in Massachusetts, a rather notorious state whose past includes the Salem Witch Trials. And it's that history where this tale begins.Involuntarily designated a town freak, he has to contend with just about every indignity imaginable for someone so young, including the disappointment from his parents who consider him strange beyond your typical quirky kid. Reason? Because he doesn't deny his visions. Norman intentionally chooses to speak with the deceased and only rarely interacts with the living. Such a choice pretty much makes him a very lonely little guy.And so life, and un-life, goes on.Until the one day his even more eccentric and infinitely scarier uncle insists on a meeting. He has two things he has to tell Norman - one a warning, the other a revelation. Things are about to change in ways that even the ostracized young man couldn't have imagined, becoming even more bizarre and terrifying.One step removed from the cracker farm, Uncle Prenderghast explains to his nephew that it is their family's terrible burden and moral responsibility to save the town. With the unwanted ability to see the departed, in their bloodline resides the only power keeping their town's most infamous resident - Agatha The Witch - from resurrecting a legion of the damned and inflicting her revenge against the townfolk who burned her at the stake.But is that what really happened?Norman has figure out the truth before Aggie destroys the town and everyone in it.One minor knock and perhaps it's just me, but save for Norman himself, I don't like the way characters were designed. They seem misshapen and unappealing. Not sure if that makes sense. Obviously these are caricatures, I get that.

However, when I saw it again on DVd just now it was not so impressive. Yet I still liked it. What I most enjoyed were the scenes where Norman talked to Angry Aggie (Agatha Babcock) and she turned out to be a frightened 11 year old girl who was angry for adults murderering her centuries ago. Like so many movies, it deals with the misunderstood outsider ostracized by The Establishment. With Norman also labeled a freak by The Popular Kids, he was the only one who could save the town from the curse of the so-called witch. Both Aggie and Norman had paranormal abilities to see the dead or things from another realm or level of existence. Unfortunately all that is at the end of the film. Most of the film is too much characters running around and doing stupid things. This was probably intentional on the directors' part, but still for me it was a distraction and I wish more of the film spent time with the dialogue between Aggie and Norman, for that was the only part worth seeing. A moral for the film is the normal people acquire acceptance of the strangeness of Norman and learn better that he is special and not a freak. Because the film has only a few scenes worth watching, I only gave it four stars.

1482693,A3TWCND9PMIOG5,B005LAII62,"Marty Kingsley ""That Geek With The Clip-Ons""","[5, 8]","How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it/really liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulNorman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young boy with an unusual gift; he can see and communicate with the spirits of the deceased. This makes him a social outcast to nearly everyone, including members of his own family as they think he's just a weird kid. Although one kid in town thinks what he can do is awesome, portly optimist Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi). One day, Norman is approached by the town crazy, Mr. Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman) who warns Norman of an ancient curse on the town that only Norman can stop. That's all I really wanna say in terms of the plot, as I don't feel like giving away anything else.This truly is one of the best animated films of 2012; really, it could be one of the best films in general of 2012, and just one of THE BEST animated films. People often forget that animation is not a genre, but a style of filmmaking. So for those that think this movie will be ""too scary"" for kids, then you seriously underestimate how tough kids can be. People also forget that ratings are on movies for a reason. This movie is rated PG (practically a hard PG give certain moments in the film) so you should have a general idea of what age group this movie should fall into. Personally, I think kids who are Norman's age (11 for those that don't know) and maybe even kids a couple years younger. Seriously, I saw tons of more ""intense"" films as a kid and they didn't traumatize me. Think about Disney for a moment; people associate it with a mystical fairy tale land of sweetness and enchantment. But then really think about how intense those movies could be. Snow White (which has the wicked queen being crushed by a rock), Cinderella (who's emotionally and physically abused by her step family), Sleeping Beauty (that features a fight with a dragon and mention to the fires of Hell!), Bambi (where a poor baby deer loses his mother), The Lion King (a lion cub's father trampled to death by a herd of wildebeests), and several others in their catalogue. Disney almost always had some pretty dark undertones. Look at classics like the Secret of NIHM or the Neverending Story. Adults forget that kids are a lot tougher than they thin, and while dark imagery may frighten a bit, once you have a triumphant end all the other bad stuff fades away. ParaNorman is such an example.This movie hits all the right notes. The animation is AMAZING, the voice casting is fantastic (people will also often forget that voice acting does require some talent and the ability to emote), the look of the movie has a classic horror feel to it, the comedy is funny, the horror at times actually scary, and the drama will tug at you. It also handles death very well and respectfully for the most part. The characters are also great, even some of the smaller ones. A good layer to the whole thing is how Norman interacts with his family. His sister, Courtney (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is your typical teenage girl but not overly annoying, his mother (voiced by Leslie Mann) is your typical protective mother who sticks by her son because that's what a mother does. But of all the family members, the best to me was Norman's father (voiced by Jeff Garlin) because we see that he does genuinely love his son, but at the same time is frustrated that he doesn't understand him. I can relate to that for sure, I think most can because there are those parents who get upset by their kid's strange behavior but they still want to do what they can to show they care even if they don't always go about it the right way. Of course the standout character is Neil because of his optimistic view of everything despite his various problems (like irritable bowel syndrome) and willingness to stick by Norman no matter what. John Goodman stands out too as the crazy old bum. The moment we learn the full story of the curse is simply tragic and if you're not crying from it you'll definitely be crying on the inside.Personally, I don't get how anyone could rate this below 4 stars. I mean, I get that we all have our tastes and opinions, but seriously, this is by no means a bad movie, especially when compared to the dreck that passes for a lot of kids entertainment these days. This reminds me of movies I watched as a kid, back when people didn't assume kids were fragile and always needed you to hold their hands. So in conclusion, see this movie! It's an essential view for anyone who just loves a great story.",5,A True Contender for Best Animated Feature of 2012,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,4595,"['How', 'ratings', 'work:5', 'really', 'liked/loved', 'it4', 'liked', 'it/really', 'liked', 'it3', 'Could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'look2', 'Just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential1', 'Simply', 'awfulNorman', 'Babcock', 'voiced', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'young', 'boy', 'unusual', 'gift', 'can', 'see', 'communicate', 'spirits', 'deceased', 'social', 'outcast', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'including', 'members', 'own', 'family', 'think', 'just', 'weird', 'kid', 'one', 'kid', 'town', 'thinks', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'awesome', 'portly', 'optimist', 'Neil', 'Downe', 'voiced', 'Tucker', 'Albrizzi', 'One', 'day', 'Norman', 'approached', 'town', 'crazy', 'Mr.', 'Prenderghast', 'voiced', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'Norman', 'ancient', 'curse', 'town', 'only', 'Norman', 'can', 'stop', 'really', 'wan', 'na', 'say', 'terms', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'else.This', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', '2012', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'general', '2012', 'just', 'one', 'THE', 'BEST', 'animated', 'films', 'People', 'often', 'forget', 'animation', 'not', 'genre', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'So', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'kids', 'then', 'seriously', 'underestimate', 'how', 'tough', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'People', 'also', 'forget', 'ratings', 'are', 'movies', 'reason', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'practically', 'hard', 'PG', 'give', 'certain', 'moments', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'age', 'group', 'movie', 'should', 'fall', 'Personally', 'think', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'Norman', 'age', '11', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'even', 'kids', 'couple', 'years', 'younger', 'Seriously', 'saw', 'tons', 'more', 'intense', 'films', 'kid', 'did', ""n't"", 'traumatize', 'Think', 'Disney', 'moment', 'people', 'associate', 'mystical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'land', 'sweetness', 'enchantment', 'then', 'really', 'think', 'how', 'intense', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'Snow', 'White', 'wicked', 'queen', 'being', 'crushed', 'rock', 'Cinderella', 'who', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'abused', 'step', 'family', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'fight', 'dragon', 'mention', 'fires', 'Hell', 'Bambi', 'where', 'poor', 'baby', 'deer', 'mother', 'Lion', 'King', 'lion', 'cub', 'father', 'trampled', 'death', 'herd', 'wildebeests', 'several', 'others', 'catalogue', 'Disney', 'almost', 'always', 'had', 'pretty', 'dark', 'undertones', 'Look', 'classics', 'Secret', 'NIHM', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'Adults', 'forget', 'kids', 'are', 'lot', 'tougher', 'thin', 'dark', 'imagery', 'may', 'frighten', 'bit', 'once', 'have', 'triumphant', 'end', 'other', 'bad', 'stuff', 'away', 'ParaNorman', 'such', 'example.This', 'movie', 'right', 'notes', 'animation', 'AMAZING', 'voice', 'casting', 'fantastic', 'people', 'will', 'also', 'often', 'forget', 'voice', 'acting', 'require', 'talent', 'ability', 'emote', 'look', 'movie', 'classic', 'horror', 'feel', 'comedy', 'funny', 'horror', 'times', 'actually', 'scary', 'drama', 'will', 'tug', 'also', 'death', 'very', 'well', 'respectfully', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'even', 'smaller', 'ones', 'good', 'layer', 'whole', 'thing', 'how', 'Norman', 'family', 'sister', 'Courtney', 'voiced', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'typical', 'teenage', 'girl', 'not', 'overly', 'annoying', 'mother', 'voiced', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'typical', 'protective', 'mother', 'who', 'son', 'what', 'mother', 'family', 'members', 'best', 'was', 'Norman', 'father', 'voiced', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'see', 'genuinely', 'love', 'son', 'same', 'time', 'frustrated', ""n't"", 'understand', 'can', 'relate', 'sure', 'think', 'most', 'can', 'are', 'parents', 'who', 'get', 'upset', 'kid', 'strange', 'behavior', 'still', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'show', 'care', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'right', 'way', 'course', 'standout', 'character', 'Neil', 'optimistic', 'view', 'everything', 'various', 'problems', 'irritable', 'bowel', 'syndrome', 'willingness', 'stick', 'Norman', 'matter', 'what', 'John', 'Goodman', 'out', 'too', 'crazy', 'old', 'bum', 'moment', 'learn', 'full', 'story', 'curse', 'simply', 'tragic', ""'re"", 'not', 'crying', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'crying', 'inside.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'rate', '4', 'stars', 'mean', 'get', 'have', 'tastes', 'opinions', 'seriously', 'bad', 'movie', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'dreck', 'lot', 'kids', 'entertainment', 'days', 'movies', 'watched', 'kid', 'back', 'when', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'assume', 'kids', 'were', 'fragile', 'always', 'needed', 'hold', 'hands', 'So', 'conclusion', 'see', 'movie', 'essential', 'view', 'anyone', 'who', 'just', 'great', 'story']",ParaNorman

PARANORMAN gets a little preachy at times and isn't quite as humorous as I had expected.

They also produced ""Coraline"" (2009). Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old middle school outcast who sees, and talks to, dead people. He sees his deceased grandmother (Elaine Stritch) at home, for which his father berates him. He sees, and greets, dead people in the streets. But one day, Norman begins to see things that even he does not believe. Terrifying things. His eccentric uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) tells Norman that the 300-year-old ""Witch's Curse"" is real and insists that Norman is the only person who can save their New England town from being run over by zombies raised from the grave on the anniversary of the curse. So Norman feels compelled to give it a try.I enjoyed the macabre humor in ""ParaNorman"". The dead are apparently not sacred to Chris Butler, who wrote the film and co-directed it with Sam Fell. He makes fun of them, the ways they died, and the reactions of the living. That makes ""ParaNorman"" equally suited to adults as to children. It's just funny. For children, it takes a little inspiration from Harry Potter. Norman is a gifted boy who must solve the mystery of the Witch's Curse and save the town. In his case, he must overcome obstructionist adults, and his attempt at library research is fruitless. But the characters are all stereotypes: the indulgent understanding mother, overbearing intolerant father, self-obsessed teenaged sister, dim-witted school bully, etc. The stereotypes are plugged into the story, and they are funny. But it's as if Butler didn't take the time to write characters.",4,Morality Tale Laced with Macabre Humor Will Entertain Children and Adults.,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1688,"['ParaNorman', 'macabre-but-endearing', 'animated', 'children', 'film', 'produced', 'Laika', 'Inc', 'specialize', 'genre', 'also', 'produced', 'Coraline', '2009', 'Norman', 'Babcock', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', '11-year-old', 'middle', 'school', 'outcast', 'who', 'talks', 'dead', 'people', 'deceased', 'grandmother', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'home', 'father', 'greets', 'dead', 'people', 'streets', 'one', 'day', 'Norman', 'see', 'things', 'even', 'not', 'believe', 'Terrifying', 'things', 'eccentric', 'uncle', 'Mr.', 'Prenderghast', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Norman', '300-year-old', 'Witch', 'Curse', 'real', 'Norman', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'zombies', 'raised', 'grave', 'anniversary', 'curse', 'So', 'Norman', 'compelled', 'give', 'try.I', 'enjoyed', 'macabre', 'humor', 'ParaNorman', 'dead', 'are', 'apparently', 'not', 'sacred', 'Chris', 'Butler', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'co-directed', 'Sam', 'Fell', 'fun', 'ways', 'died', 'reactions', 'living', 'ParaNorman', 'equally', 'suited', 'adults', 'children', 'just', 'funny', 'children', 'little', 'inspiration', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Norman', 'gifted', 'boy', 'who', 'must', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Witch', 'Curse', 'save', 'town', 'case', 'must', 'overcome', 'obstructionist', 'adults', 'attempt', 'library', 'research', 'fruitless', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'indulgent', 'understanding', 'mother', 'overbearing', 'intolerant', 'father', 'self-obsessed', 'teenaged', 'sister', 'dim-witted', 'school', 'bully', 'etc', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'plugged', 'story', 'are', 'funny', 'Butler', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'write', 'characters']",ParaNorman

Oleson,"[1, 2]","With zombies all the rage now, seemingly passing up vampires as the go to monster, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that we get an animated version.  Rated PG, this nice film from the folks who brought us ""Caroline"" a few years ago is edgy enough for older kids and provides enough artistic skill to keep adults interested.Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11 year old boy who can see and hear dead people and animals...well, not flies.  He's a bit of an oddball at school having to deal with the various ghosts that still lurk around his small town.  The town itself is noted for having witches in its history, including one who still brings her wrath on occasion.  Norman's uncle (John Goodman) tells Norman that is up to him to stop the witch's harassment.With a book of fairy tales in hand Norman sets out to find the witch's grave.  Instead he unearths a gaggle of zombies who he finds out, had a direct influence on the mean witch's current behavior.  ""Paranorman"" has a moralistic theme of course, but it doesn't hit you right in the face.The final act really amps up the excellent stop-action visuals and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  Speaking of soundtrack; one of the things missing from an otherwise superb film is  good music, something usually a staple for animated films.  The humor is more situational than dialog driven.  A few more over-the-kids-head topical comments would have added something for the adults.

1482714,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B005LAII62,Newton Ooi,"[1, 2]","The second half of 2012 saw four big name animated films released on the big screen.  One of them, Wreck-It Ralph, ran away at the box office and was loved by critics.  The other three, Frankenweenie, ParaNorman, and Hotel Transylvania, battled for second place.  All four films had great animation, good casting, a good blend of action, comedy, and drama, and a solid advertising campaign preceding their American releases.  All four films also had un-original origins in that they all drew heavily from prior animated blockbusters.  So why the sharp difference in performance?  The answer to this is key to understanding costumer choices, and the ability to distinguish oneself from their competitors.  Wreck-It Ralph stood out as it was the only film about video games, and featured an antihero in the lead role.  The other three films seemed eerily similar in that their plots delved into the world of the supernatural - horror fantasy genres, and featured child characters in the lead roles.  Frankenweenie is basically Frankenstein with a dog instead of a man, and a boy instead of a doctor.  ParaNorman was an animated remake of Sixth Sense blended with plot-lines from other horror films.  And Hotel Transylvania drew upon elements of multiple horror films.  Its as if most of Hollywood shared the same scripts and screenplays, but just changed up the casting and animation style.  This is unfortunate, as the latter three were solid films, and each would have performed much better  in the absence of the other two.Now my review for ParaNorman.  The plot line seems like a hybrid of Sixth Sense, and a multitude of films about witches, such as Lords of Salem.  The pace of the movie was fairly slow, with none of the manic action and snappy dialogue common to other animated films.  The soundtrack matched the pace of the movie.  The plot logic was sound, with great attention to detail.  The animation was believable though nothing spectacular.  There were some scary scenes in the film that toddlers would probably get nightmares from, so I would not bring anyone under 5 to see this film.  Overall, a film that is above average, even borderline good.  Except when stacked up against the competitors that Hollywood put out last year, it failed to stand out...",3,Would have done better if it came out another year,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2270,"['second', 'half', '2012', 'saw', 'four', 'big', 'name', 'animated', 'films', 'released', 'big', 'screen', 'One', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'ran', 'away', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'loved', 'critics', 'other', 'three', 'Frankenweenie', 'ParaNorman', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'battled', 'second', 'place', 'four', 'films', 'had', 'great', 'animation', 'good', 'casting', 'good', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'solid', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'preceding', 'American', 'releases', 'four', 'films', 'also', 'had', 'un-original', 'origins', 'drew', 'heavily', 'prior', 'animated', 'blockbusters', 'So', 'why', 'sharp', 'difference', 'performance', 'answer', 'key', 'understanding', 'costumer', 'choices', 'ability', 'distinguish', 'competitors', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'video', 'games', 'featured', 'antihero', 'lead', 'role', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'seemed', 'eerily', 'similar', 'plots', 'delved', 'world', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'genres', 'featured', 'child', 'characters', 'lead', 'roles', 'Frankenweenie', 'basically', 'Frankenstein', 'dog', 'instead', 'man', 'boy', 'instead', 'doctor', 'ParaNorman', 'was', 'animated', 'remake', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'blended', 'plot-lines', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'drew', 'upon', 'elements', 'multiple', 'horror', 'films', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'shared', 'same', 'scripts', 'screenplays', 'just', 'changed', 'up', 'casting', 'animation', 'style', 'unfortunate', 'latter', 'three', 'were', 'solid', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'performed', 'much', 'better', 'absence', 'other', 'two.Now', 'review', 'ParaNorman', 'plot', 'line', 'hybrid', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'multitude', 'films', 'witches', 'such', 'Lords', 'Salem', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'slow', 'none', 'manic', 'action', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'common', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'soundtrack', 'matched', 'pace', 'movie', 'plot', 'logic', 'was', 'sound', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'animation', 'was', 'believable', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'were', 'scary', 'scenes', 'film', 'toddlers', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'nightmares', 'would', 'not', 'bring', 'anyone', '5', 'see', 'film', 'Overall', 'film', 'above', 'average', 'even', 'borderline', 'good', 'when', 'stacked', 'up', 'competitors', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'failed', 'stand', 'out']",ParaNorman

When I saw the first one, which had a very odd song choice for the trailer and nothing to really grab the audience, I thought it was an easy pass. Then, the more I saw of the film, including the giant witch head in the sky, it made me want to actually give the film a shot. So, does this animated feature have a story as great as the animation looks, or is it a script that should have remained in the grave?ParaNorman comes from Laika, Inc., the studio responsible for the 2009 animated film, Coraline. So, of course, the stop motion animation looks amazing. But what about the story? Our hero of the film is Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a kid who can see and communicate with ghosts. Now, being the weird kid is always tough, and being the weird kid that sees ghosts is even tougher. Befriended by fellow social outcast Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), Norman's life gets even stranger when his distant uncle (John Goodman) comes with a bizarre warning that Norman must step up to protect his town. Protect from what? A witch that was convicted of, well, witchcraft, and killed in the very town Norman lives in many years ago. This is where the film picks up, and it really does an outstanding job of telling a compelling story.Now, ParaNorman has another thing going for it, and that is that it takes advantage of the 3D craze going around. Being the first stop motion film to use color 3D printers, this colorful and imagination filled world really pops with the 3D glasses. Remember, the 3D these days is meant to give the film a sense of depth, and for ParaNorman, it exceeds that aspect easily. This is definitely a film go the extra mile on and see in glorious 3D.All in all, for an animated film, it did have some more mature themes in it, but it also had some important life lessons and an amazing ending. The story is original, the characters are memorable, and the zombies look great on screen; what more can you ask for? One of the best animated films this year, make sure to catch ParaNorman on DVD or Blu Ray.",4,ParaNorman Scares Up a Great Time,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2066,"['have', 'seen', 'trailers', 'ParaNorman', 'last', 'year', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'very', 'odd', 'song', 'choice', 'trailer', 'nothing', 'really', 'grab', 'audience', 'thought', 'was', 'easy', 'pass', 'Then', 'more', 'saw', 'film', 'including', 'giant', 'witch', 'head', 'sky', 'made', 'want', 'actually', 'give', 'film', 'shot', 'So', 'animated', 'feature', 'have', 'story', 'as', 'great', 'animation', 'script', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'grave', 'ParaNorman', 'Laika', 'Inc.', 'studio', 'responsible', '2009', 'animated', 'film', 'Coraline', 'So', 'course', 'stop', 'motion', 'animation', 'amazing', 'what', 'story', 'hero', 'film', 'Norman', 'Kodi', 'Smit-McPhee', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'communicate', 'ghosts', 'Now', 'being', 'weird', 'kid', 'always', 'tough', 'being', 'weird', 'kid', 'ghosts', 'even', 'tougher', 'Befriended', 'fellow', 'social', 'outcast', 'Neil', 'Tucker', 'Albrizzi', 'Norman', 'life', 'even', 'stranger', 'when', 'distant', 'uncle', 'John', 'Goodman', 'bizarre', 'warning', 'Norman', 'must', 'step', 'up', 'protect', 'town', 'Protect', 'what', 'witch', 'was', 'convicted', 'well', 'witchcraft', 'killed', 'very', 'town', 'Norman', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'where', 'film', 'up', 'really', 'outstanding', 'job', 'telling', 'compelling', 'story.Now', 'ParaNorman', 'thing', 'going', 'advantage', '3D', 'craze', 'going', 'around', 'Being', 'first', 'stop', 'motion', 'film', 'use', 'color', '3D', 'printers', 'colorful', 'imagination', 'filled', 'world', 'really', '3D', 'glasses', 'Remember', '3D', 'days', 'meant', 'give', 'film', 'sense', 'depth', 'ParaNorman', 'aspect', 'easily', 'definitely', 'film', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'see', 'glorious', '3D.All', 'animated', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'also', 'had', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'amazing', 'ending', 'story', 'original', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'zombies', 'look', 'great', 'screen', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'One', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'year', 'make', 'sure', 'catch', 'ParaNorman', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray']",ParaNorman
1482717,A11B6LNU5MS6V,B005LAII62,N. Sturm,"[0, 1]","I really wanted to like Paranorman and, well, I basically did.  For me it lived up to both the praise and the criticism, simultaneously, somehow.  Some things about the movie really work, including:The stop-motion animation, which is beautiful. I've never seen it done so well and it really shows the care someone put into this movie.  The characters don't look too cartoony and the horror-scene visuals are truly creepy.The archetypal characters, who are used to good effect and in many ways seem to be tongue-in-cheek.  The humor, too, is corny and somewhat predictable, but that doesn't mean I didn't laugh.  What can I say?  It's very cute.Notably, however, there are some important elements which really miss the mark (spoilers):The entire sense of danger is misplaced.  When the witchcloud first appeared in the sky, it was *clearly* coming from a particular spot on the ground some miles from where Norman was standing.  Wouldn't that have been a good place to check for her grave?  Norman didn't have to go to the records building at all.  A slightly different visual would have made this a non-issue, but as it stands the illogic is glaring.Finally, the moral of the story is ham-fisted and flawed.  Tolerance is good, okay?  Nobody should have been mean to Norman.  But expecting people to refrain from flipping out at zombies is a bit much, especially when the zombies don't get around to explaining their presence until it's plot convenient.  And Aggie?  It was wrong to kill her, no one's arguing that, but she WAS in fact a witch.  So much for misunderstood.  The whole witch-trial plot doesn't work the same when witches exist.So overall, I liked the idea of Paranorman better than the execution.  I really really wish it had been a triumph of characterization and storytelling, since it found itself at the middle of a mild debate about values and stuff.  But I guess I shouldn't expect every movie to be a cultural landmark, even when it's obviously trying to be. *sigh*",3,More style than substance.,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1987,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'Paranorman', 'well', 'basically', 'did', 'lived', 'up', 'praise', 'criticism', 'simultaneously', 'somehow', 'things', 'movie', 'really', 'work', 'including', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'care', 'someone', 'put', 'movie', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'cartoony', 'horror-scene', 'visuals', 'are', 'truly', 'creepy.The', 'archetypal', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'many', 'ways', 'seem', 'be', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humor', 'too', 'corny', 'somewhat', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'very', 'cute.Notably', 'however', 'are', 'important', 'elements', 'really', 'miss', 'mark', 'spoilers', 'entire', 'sense', 'danger', 'misplaced', 'When', 'witchcloud', 'first', 'appeared', 'sky', 'was', '*clearly*', 'coming', 'particular', 'spot', 'ground', 'miles', 'where', 'Norman', 'was', 'standing', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'good', 'place', 'check', 'grave', 'Norman', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'records', 'building', 'slightly', 'different', 'visual', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'non-issue', 'illogic', 'glaring.Finally', 'moral', 'story', 'ham-fisted', 'flawed', 'Tolerance', 'good', 'okay', 'Nobody', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mean', 'Norman', 'expecting', 'people', 'refrain', 'flipping', 'out', 'zombies', 'bit', 'much', 'especially', 'when', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'explaining', 'presence', 'plot', 'convenient', 'Aggie', 'was', 'wrong', 'kill', 'one', 'arguing', 'WAS', 'fact', 'witch', 'So', 'much', 'misunderstood', 'whole', 'witch-trial', 'plot', ""n't"", 'work', 'same', 'when', 'witches', 'exist.So', 'overall', 'liked', 'idea', 'Paranorman', 'better', 'execution', 'really', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'triumph', 'characterization', 'storytelling', 'found', 'middle', 'mild', 'debate', 'values', 'stuff', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'be', 'cultural', 'landmark', 'even', 'when', 'obviously', 'trying', 'be', '*sigh*']",ParaNorman

1482723,A8G9GETA2OLMZ,B005LAII62,P. Schumacher,"[0, 0]","This is an animated film for adults as well as children.The story is quirky and the animation lovely.  Norman, a ten-year-old, can see ghosts, as well as history, and this makes him a pariah in his town (a witch-haunted hamlet in Massachusetts), his school, and even his family.  The animation depicts all these people in their quirky but lovable reality: Norman is cute but has porcupine hair, wingnut ears,  and mismatched nostrils; his dad has a beer gut that makes him look pregnant with an elephant; his mom is sweet and frumpy and has a bulging 40-year-old belly; his older sister is a Barbie wannabe with never a hair out of place, smothered in lipgloss and oceans of pink.And the morals are ones that both kids and adults can relate to.  Ostracism vs. acceptance, creativity vs. inclusion, the wisdom of children vs. the obtuseness of adults, the ability of almost anyone to change.Norman, of course, saves the day, and the town--grudgingly and falteringly, but with increasing confidence.  And all the other characters grow quite believably from the experience.One nice thing is how most of the characters go from being stereotypes to being multidimensional.  The premier example is Norman's sister Courtney.  She starts as a vapid teenage narcissist airhead, and, quite surprisingly, shows amazing reserves of strength, leadership, perception, and pluck before it's all over.  She's still a vapid teenage narcissist, but she's also an interesting and surprising person.Fun for everyone.",5,Superb,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1496,"['animated', 'film', 'adults', 'as', 'well', 'children.The', 'story', 'quirky', 'animation', 'lovely', 'Norman', 'ten-year-old', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'pariah', 'town', 'witch-haunted', 'hamlet', 'Massachusetts', 'school', 'even', 'family', 'animation', 'people', 'quirky', 'lovable', 'reality', 'Norman', 'cute', 'porcupine', 'hair', 'wingnut', 'ears', 'mismatched', 'nostrils', 'dad', 'beer', 'gut', 'look', 'pregnant', 'elephant', 'mom', 'sweet', 'frumpy', 'bulging', '40-year-old', 'belly', 'older', 'sister', 'Barbie', 'wannabe', 'never', 'hair', 'place', 'smothered', 'lipgloss', 'oceans', 'pink.And', 'morals', 'are', 'ones', 'kids', 'adults', 'can', 'relate', 'Ostracism', 'acceptance', 'creativity', 'vs.', 'inclusion', 'wisdom', 'children', 'obtuseness', 'adults', 'ability', 'almost', 'anyone', 'change.Norman', 'course', 'day', 'town', 'grudgingly', 'falteringly', 'increasing', 'confidence', 'other', 'characters', 'grow', 'quite', 'believably', 'experience.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'how', 'most', 'characters', 'go', 'being', 'stereotypes', 'being', 'multidimensional', 'premier', 'example', 'Norman', 'sister', 'Courtney', 'vapid', 'teenage', 'narcissist', 'airhead', 'quite', 'surprisingly', 'amazing', 'reserves', 'strength', 'leadership', 'perception', 'pluck', 'over', 'still', 'vapid', 'teenage', 'narcissist', 'also', 'interesting', 'surprising', 'person.Fun', 'everyone']",ParaNorman

This trend seems to have petered off in recent years, with a range of mediocre studios capitalizing on the popularity of CG animation, but there is one art form that never fails to churn out top quality stories: stop-motion animation. Perhaps it's because of the pain-staking level of patience and detail that goes into each moment of screen-time: clearly the arists behind the visuals don't want to waste their time on anything other than the very best that storytellers have to offer.""ParaNorman"" is best described as a comedy-horror, veering between the two genres with a range of funny gags and genuinely scary moments. Paying homage to B-grade horror films of the 1980s (including nods toFriday the 13thandHalloween), the film also has plenty to say about the nature of fear and the devastating impact it can have on reason and compassion. By the end credits, I was surprised at how sophisticated the story and its message was, all in a film that ostensibly meant for children.Much like Haley Joel Osmond inThe Sixth Sense, Norman Babcock can see dead people. Unlike Haley Joel Osmond, Norman isn't afraid of them. In fact, it's the living that makes his life difficult, whether it's fending off bullies at school or coping with his own family's refusal to believe in his special gift. Such ostracization has left him withdrawn and reclusive, but he remains a gentle soul As his grandmother's ghost tells him: it's okay to be scared - as long as it doesn't change who he is.As it turns out, there's plenty to be afraid of.  Living in Blithe Hollow, a New England township whose tourist trade revolves around a dark history of witch trials, Norman has grown up with the story of a local witch whose curse on the Puritan judges that sentenced her to death promises that they'll one day rise on Halloween as the intruments of her revenge. That day appears to be swift-approaching, for Norman is having increasingly terrifying visions of the town's colonial past.Not only that, but he's being followed by the only other person in town deemed more crazy than him: his Uncle Prenderghast, who warns him that he's the only one who can keep the undead from rising. Together with a motley crew composed of his best (and only) friend Neil, his ditzy  sister Courtney, her would-be boyfriend Mitch and the local bully Alvin, Norman desperately searches for a way to keep the town safe - even if it means going up against angry mobs and grisly zombies.It's hard to talk about ""ParaNorman"" without giving away the surprise twist at its climax, one that really deserves to be watched without any spoilers. Suffice to say that it's the reason why ParaNorman is so memorable, making it far more complex than its initial dark comedy sequences would at first have you believe. Even as it pokes fun at horror movie clich&eacute;s, there is a very harrowing horror story at its core...one which demonstrates the fear and intolerance is a greater evil than any witch or zombie.With creative character designs and beautiful animation, ""ParaNorman"" is a great Halloween treat, very much in the spirit ofScooby DooorHocus Pocus, not to mention other stop-motion classics such asThe Nightmare Before ChristmasandCoraline. Though some of the jokes might be a little more risque than parents are used to, and some of the scary sequences are pretty darn scary, ""Paranorman"" has all the potential to end up a classic.",4,"""Can't You Be Like Other Kids Your Age?""",1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,3484,"['Strange', 'how', 'used', 'be', 'computer-animated', 'films', 'were', 'always', 'guarantee', 'quality', 'trend', 'have', 'petered', 'off', 'recent', 'years', 'range', 'mediocre', 'studios', 'capitalizing', 'popularity', 'CG', 'animation', 'one', 'art', 'form', 'never', 'churn', 'out', 'top', 'quality', 'stories', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'Perhaps', 'pain-staking', 'level', 'patience', 'detail', 'moment', 'screen-time', 'clearly', 'arists', 'visuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'anything', 'other', 'very', 'best', 'storytellers', 'have', 'offer', 'ParaNorman', 'best', 'described', 'comedy-horror', 'veering', 'two', 'genres', 'range', 'funny', 'gags', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'moments', 'Paying', 'homage', 'B-grade', 'horror', 'films', '1980s', 'including', 'nods', 'toFriday', '13thandHalloween', 'film', 'also', 'plenty', 'say', 'nature', 'fear', 'devastating', 'impact', 'can', 'have', 'reason', 'compassion', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'sophisticated', 'story', 'message', 'was', 'film', 'ostensibly', 'meant', 'children.Much', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmond', 'inThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Norman', 'Babcock', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmond', 'Norman', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'fact', 'living', 'life', 'difficult', 'fending', 'off', 'bullies', 'school', 'coping', 'own', 'family', 'refusal', 'believe', 'special', 'gift', 'Such', 'ostracization', 'left', 'withdrawn', 'reclusive', 'gentle', 'soul', 'grandmother', 'ghost', 'okay', 'be', 'scared', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'change', 'who', 'out', 'plenty', 'be', 'afraid', 'Living', 'Blithe', 'Hollow', 'New', 'England', 'township', 'tourist', 'trade', 'around', 'dark', 'history', 'witch', 'trials', 'Norman', 'grown', 'up', 'story', 'local', 'witch', 'curse', 'Puritan', 'judges', 'sentenced', 'death', 'promises', ""'ll"", 'one', 'day', 'rise', 'Halloween', 'intruments', 'revenge', 'day', 'be', 'swift-approaching', 'Norman', 'having', 'increasingly', 'terrifying', 'visions', 'town', 'colonial', 'past.Not', 'only', 'being', 'followed', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'town', 'deemed', 'more', 'crazy', 'Uncle', 'Prenderghast', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'undead', 'rising', 'Together', 'motley', 'crew', 'composed', 'best', 'only', 'friend', 'Neil', 'ditzy', 'sister', 'Courtney', 'would-be', 'boyfriend', 'Mitch', 'local', 'bully', 'Alvin', 'Norman', 'desperately', 'way', 'keep', 'town', 'safe', 'even', 'going', 'up', 'angry', 'mobs', 'grisly', 'zombies.It', 'hard', 'talk', 'ParaNorman', 'giving', 'away', 'surprise', 'twist', 'climax', 'one', 'really', 'be', 'watched', 'spoilers', 'Suffice', 'say', 'reason', 'why', 'ParaNorman', 'so', 'memorable', 'making', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'initial', 'dark', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'would', 'first', 'have', 'believe', 'Even', 'fun', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'very', 'harrowing', 'horror', 'story', 'core', 'one', 'fear', 'intolerance', 'greater', 'evil', 'witch', 'zombie.With', 'creative', 'character', 'designs', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'ParaNorman', 'great', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'very', 'much', 'spirit', 'ofScooby', 'DooorHocus', 'Pocus', 'not', 'mention', 'other', 'stop-motion', 'classics', 'such', 'asThe', 'Nightmare', 'ChristmasandCoraline', 'jokes', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'risque', 'parents', 'are', 'used', 'scary', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'scary', 'Paranorman', 'potential', 'end', 'up', 'classic']",ParaNorman

Not gimmicky, not just thrown in as an excuse to charge more for admission. AMAZING. I wanted to wait until I actually owned the product which is the home video release before I review. Notice verified purchase. The menu is using Universal Studies generic menu which, I am not crazy about as I like a custom menu. That aside, the BD transfer quality is top notch. You could see all the details Laika studios pays attention too like the pattern in the concrete, and the clothing the characters wore. The video quality is comparable to the theater. I want to get a  3D tv so I can watch movies like this in 3D at home.StoryA kid from a  small town with a dark history is a medium, he see's dead people. He is also weird and misunderstood by everyone but his friend Neil. The story has great messages about bullying and tolerance. I don't want to spoil it, but I saw it with 4 year and 6 year old. The 6 year got the message, the 4 year old not so much. Mildly scary in some scene, but nothing an intelligent child cannont handle.VisualsLaika!, The studio that brought use Coraline and Corpse Bride. This is the best stop motion animation I have ever seen. They were hired by Tim Burton and formed their own studio. I believe the first film to utilize a 3D printer for the film. I read in the Wired article Norman alone has something like 9000 separate faces, with over 300 hand sculpted hairs. Ridiculous attention to detail. They also used an advance process for the 3D shooting multiple frames with a high end Nikkon SLR. At the theater I was blown away by the 3D. I also love the story.

1482753,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B005LAII62,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","What a delightful little oddball of a film. ParaNorman is a stop-motion feature from the same production company who brought us Coraline, and it's easy to spot the similarities. Both are charming and creepy stop-motion family films, while bringing enough jokes and even chills to keep the parents in the audience entertained.The somewhat thin premise is that Norman, a preteen boy who can speak to the dead, has to break a witch's curse in his New England town celebrating its 300th anniversary. The fairly simple plot fortunately is brought to life through the colorful cast of supporting characters; Norman's school bully (voiced by the actor who played McLovin of all people!) and Norman's older sister are just two of the highlights.A surprising edge and wit also keep the story feeling fresh and engaging throughout the film. In one of the laugh-out-loud moments, Norman's mentor (another ghost whisperer) tells Norman to ""swear"" to break the witch's curse, to which Norman replies, ""Like what? The `f' word?""Toward the third act the plot runs a little long (particularly in the surreal and visually entrancing, yet ultimately predictable climax) but the journey is consistently engaging and intriguing. Stop-motion films consistently produce fascinating worlds that are tons of fun to explore (especially in 3D) and ParaNorman is no exception; you almost want the screen to pause so you can better appreciate the detail in the setting and characters.While it does clock on for a bit too long, ParaNorman is still a breath of fresh air for animation, providing solid and quality entertainment with some really stunning visuals. It is very rare and exciting to find a family horror film with genuine thrills, and is even more special to find one with such a strong and endearing young protagonist.",4,"Very sweet, offbeat family film",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1801,"['What', 'delightful', 'little', 'oddball', 'film', 'ParaNorman', 'stop-motion', 'feature', 'same', 'production', 'company', 'who', 'brought', 'Coraline', 'easy', 'spot', 'similarities', 'are', 'charming', 'creepy', 'stop-motion', 'family', 'films', 'bringing', 'enough', 'jokes', 'even', 'chills', 'keep', 'parents', 'audience', 'entertained.The', 'somewhat', 'thin', 'premise', 'Norman', 'preteen', 'boy', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'dead', 'break', 'witch', 'curse', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'celebrating', '300th', 'anniversary', 'fairly', 'simple', 'plot', 'fortunately', 'brought', 'life', 'colorful', 'cast', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Norman', 'school', 'bully', 'voiced', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'McLovin', 'people', 'Norman', 'older', 'sister', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'highlights.A', 'surprising', 'edge', 'wit', 'also', 'keep', 'story', 'feeling', 'fresh', 'engaging', 'film', 'one', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'Norman', 'mentor', 'ghost', 'whisperer', 'Norman', 'swear', 'break', 'witch', 'curse', 'Norman', 'what', 'f', 'word', 'third', 'act', 'plot', 'little', 'long', 'particularly', 'surreal', 'visually', 'entrancing', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'predictable', 'climax', 'journey', 'consistently', 'engaging', 'intriguing', 'Stop-motion', 'films', 'consistently', 'produce', 'fascinating', 'worlds', 'are', 'tons', 'fun', 'explore', 'especially', '3D', 'ParaNorman', 'exception', 'almost', 'want', 'screen', 'pause', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'detail', 'setting', 'characters.While', 'clock', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'ParaNorman', 'still', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'animation', 'providing', 'solid', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'really', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'very', 'rare', 'exciting', 'find', 'family', 'horror', 'film', 'genuine', 'thrills', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'find', 'one', 'strong', 'endearing', 'young', 'protagonist']",ParaNorman

The message that it portrays about not judging people is a good message, but I do not like movies that are geared towards kids and have profanity in it, or references to sex. Also, my daughter likes to watch movies so much that within a day or two she knows every line in that movie. I don't like keeping her from watching her movies, but this is one that I would have to restrict heavily due to the profanity, which is another reason why I will not buy it, no matter how much she asks me.The violence was mild and my daughter wasn't scared, so that was never an issue.

He also has a drunken estranged uncle who knows what Norman is going through and before he becomes a ghost himself, tells Norman how it all started and how he can solve his problem.For fans of animation or horror films, this movie will satisfy.

Not long after that, Norman and Neil are confronted by Norman's estranged uncle, Mr. Penderghast, (voiced by John Goodman) who tells them that they must perform a ritual that evening to prevent the dead rising from the gave that evening.I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. Yes, the notion of a child who can ""see dead people"" is right out of The Sixth Sense but that's where the similarities end. Norman accepts his abilities, in spite of the scorn he receives as a result. Another difference between Norman and the character portrayed by Haley Joel Osment is that Norman is a very optimistic, upbeat; individual who just doesn't have any friends. The supporting cast is chock-full of talented people who add to the story.

1482775,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005LAII62,Turfseer,"[10, 39]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Paranorman, the new stop action animated horror comedy, comes from the creators of Coraline, the 1999 Alice in Wonderland-like stop action animated feature, which garnered fairly good reviews. I faulted Coraline for its lack of originality and characters that didn't have enough charm. I'm sad to report that Paranorman represents a big step backward for the creators of Coraline, as it's much more derivative than its precursor and manages to exude significantly less charm.The film starts off nicely as we slowly pan through the town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, which reminds one of a working-class section of Boston or any of those eastern or central Massachusetts towns that happen to feature rows of houses built in the 20s and 30s. We meet the film's protagonist, Norman Babcock, a boy with psychic powers who can communicate with his deceased grandmother inside the house as well as numerous ghosts out on the street. Norman is one of those 'misunderstood' kids who's ridiculed at school as a freak and forms a friendship with another outcast at school, Neil, an overweight kid, who is also constantly bullied.In 'Coraline', most of the characters were eccentric but in 'Paranorman', except mainly for Norman and Neil, all the other characters, who are supposed to be funny, are actually either grotesque, mean-spirited or ignorant (some all of the above). The film's animators chose to highlight all the characters' negative attributes by exaggerating their physical deficiencies. For example, Norman's father, Perry, has an enormously protruding pot belly. He's also entirely unsympathetic as he considers his son's interest in psychic phenomena, an embarrassment to the family as well as the community at large. The Paranorman scenarists also fail to get any laughs from Norman's sister Courtney, who proves to be a caricature of a narcissistic teenager who's desperate to find a boyfriend. At the end of picture, we're supposed to laugh when she's rejected by Neil's older flat-topped, super-buffed Ron Howard looking brother, Mitch, who turns out to be gay.Today it seems whenever we have a story about a young outcast, he'll always be pitted against a school bully. In this case it's Alvin, who sports a pig-like face and bears a faint resemblance to Bruce Willis. The obnoxious Alvin attempts to torment sensitive Norman until he realizes that everything his opponent is saying about a witch's curse that may destroy the town, comes true. Mrs. Henscher, the schoolteacher, is fairly amusing when she attempts to convince her school kids to emote better while they're performing a play about the 300th anniversary of the town, but later turns ugly (sporting a mud cake facial), joining a mob full of vengeful townspeople, who riot when faced with a group of hapless Zombies. There's also Sheriff Hooper, the overzealous police officer who thinks of shooting first and asking questions later (as the only African-American, some folks may find this character overly stereotypical).Saving the worst character for last is Norman's deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who lives on the edge of town and resembles the town drunk--an individual who everyone in the town tries to avoid. Before Prenderghast has a heart attack and dies, he explains that the town is cursed by a little girl who was hung as a witch and took revenge on the seven Puritan townspeople from 300 years ago, who sentenced her to death. In an awfully tasteless scene, after Prenderghast kicks the bucket, rigor mortis sets in and the lifeless, stiff body falls on little Norman--who must extricate himself, not before being licked by the corpse's loose and gross, saliva-filled tongue.In addition to all the unlikeable and charmless characters, there's also the amazingly derivative story line. Without the so-called comedy, 'Paranorman' would just be your average Zombie movie. The twist is that Paranorman cops out by becoming completely sentimental. The Zombies were not originally a hate-filled mob who sentenced poor little Agatha to death--they were merely 'afraid'. And now Norman points out, the mob full of Blithe Hollow denizens, have becomes just as bad as their cowering ancestors.Norman ends up by making everything right by engaging in a 'heart-to-heart' with the now demented and vengeful little Agatha. Once Norman gets through to Agatha, the souls of the seven Zombies, finally make it to their eternal resting spots (along with of course, little Agatha) and Norman's family and the rest of the town, learn an important lesson about being tolerant of kids with extra sensory abilities as well as Zombies who were not actually hate-crazed bigots, but merely innocently caught up in the mass hysteria of their times.Now all that's left is to figure out how this hopeless production became a hit. Well, of course there are all those kids into zombie movies; but what about the critics? Sadly, many of the critics have the sensibilities of all those kids who bought the tickets. Alas, little Agatha is no more. If only Norman could have directed her to have those knuckleheads (aka 'the critics') give 'Paranorman', the rating it deserved. It looks like Metacritic's completely misguided '72', will remain Paranorman's ultimate final composite rating, for all eternity!",1,"A frightful blend of humorless, grotesque characters propelled by

It is a story that actually delivers a powerful message about knowing that it is ok if you are different than everyone else.The positives in this film are the tributes to horror films of the 1980s and the jokes that were thrown in for the adult appeal.
