1072533,A1C0NMCONVFVF4,B000PMGHIC,Chloe,"[6, 6]","Bill Goodwin portrays Lois Butler's father in this 1948 vintage classic comedy film.  Mickey is a tomboy whose dad is a widow & set to marry a society snob who has every intention of taking over after she becomes Mickey's stepmother.  However, Mickey's friend's (Beverly Wills) aunt (Irene Hervey) is in town & acts as somewhat of a surrogate mother to Mickey.  The two warm quickly to each other & Mickey sets out to point cupid's arrow in the direction of this woman & her father.  Irene Hervey & Bill Goodwin would later reunite for the 1958 film, Going Steady.  The chemistry between the two is apparent & makes the interaction between them (Goodwin & Hervey) even more realistic & enjoyable.  Hattie McDaniel turns in a fine performance as the feisty housekeeper, as does Skip Homeier, & Rose Hobart.  Worth the viewing time & worth adding to your library.",5,"Excellent family film...

1072535,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000PMGHIC,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[8, 8]","Mickey Kelley (Lois Butler, Indianapolis native) is a tomboy loving baseball and growing up as a doctor's daughter in a small town in Indiana.  At age 15, she has a father, George (Bill Goodwin) that's beginning to get the idea he needs to remarry to give his daughter a mother/female figure.  The likely catch in town, Lydia (Rose Hobart), encourages her expected role as the new mom.Mickey's neighbor friend helps her plot against the mom-to-be, the one with the geek violin playing son, and encourages instead, the friends visiting Aunt Louise (Irene Hervey).  Lots goes wrong and gets everyone upset till the correct information surfaces.Mickey gets plenty of chances to sing, which she does well at her young age.  She trades in her Tiger's baseball jersey for a formal, several of which the lady viewers will enjoy seeing in their 40's dress style.  The automobiles would today be worth a small fortune.  A fun look at life back in the days of ""Father Knows Best"" except this father didn't get it all quite right along the way.A great nostalgic movie, with violence limited to a couple of fisticuffs, skin shots limited to bare shoulders, and language dropping to just the occasional ""darn"".The story is loosely based upon Peggy Goodin's book ""Clementine"".  The author was from Bluffton, Indiana and not related to the Hoosier lead actress or Bill Goodwin, the lead male actor.  The book is as good as the movie and different enough you'll want to read it as well as watch the movie.  The title was changed because another movie running at the time conflicted with the same name.  Thus the girl Clementine or ""Clem"" was also changed to Mickey.  You'll recognize several of the songs as well.  Wholesome DVD viewing from the past.",5,GREAT FOR ALL THOSE VIEWERS LIKING THE OLDIES.,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,1735,"['Mickey', 'Kelley', 'Lois', 'Butler', 'Indianapolis', 'native', 'tomboy', 'loving', 'baseball', 'growing', 'up', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'small', 'town', 'Indiana', 'age', '15', 'father', 'George', 'Bill', 'Goodwin', 'beginning', 'get', 'idea', 'remarry', 'give', 'daughter', 'mother/female', 'figure', 'likely', 'catch', 'town', 'Lydia', 'Rose', 'Hobart', 'expected', 'role', 'new', 'mom.Mickey', 'neighbor', 'friend', 'plot', 'mom-to-be', 'one', 'geek', 'violin', 'playing', 'son', 'encourages', 'instead', 'friends', 'visiting', 'Aunt', 'Louise', 'Irene', 'Hervey', 'Lots', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'upset', 'correct', 'information', 'surfaces.Mickey', 'plenty', 'chances', 'sing', 'well', 'young', 'age', 'Tiger', 'baseball', 'jersey', 'formal', 'several', 'lady', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', '40', 'dress', 'style', 'automobiles', 'would', 'today', 'be', 'small', 'fortune', 'fun', 'look', 'life', 'back', 'days', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'quite', 'right', 'way.A', 'great', 'nostalgic', 'movie', 'violence', 'limited', 'couple', 'fisticuffs', 'skin', 'shots', 'limited', 'bare', 'shoulders', 'language', 'dropping', 'just', 'occasional', 'darn', '.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'Peggy', 'Goodin', 'book', 'Clementine', 'author', 'was', 'Bluffton', 'Indiana', 'not', 'related', 'Hoosier', 'lead', 'actress', 'Bill', 'Goodwin', 'lead', 'male', 'actor', 'book', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'different', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'want', 'read', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'movie', 'title', 'was', 'changed', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'conflicted', 'same', 'name', 'Thus', 'girl', 'Clementine', 'Clem', 'was', 'also', 'changed', 'Mickey', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'several', 'songs', 'well', 'Wholesome', 'DVD', 'viewing', 'past']",Mickey

However, as I was watching I decided to do a quick internet search for the adorable Lois Butler and...nothing.  She married Hall Bartlett (writer producer, director)the same year this film came out.  Or did she?  Apparently there is a discrepancy on this little fact as his other two wives show up on his bio but she is Lois is rarely mentioned.  All I can find is that she stopped working after she was married.  I can deduce from Hal's reputation and career they divorced soon after.  After that, nothing until she dies in 1989 at the young age of 58.  Now I'm intrigued.  I can't help wondering what happened to her and if she died content, or if the story took a tragic turn.If anyone has any info, let me know.  And then do her legacy a favor and post the info over at IMDB.Thanks.",3,Whatever happened to Lois Butler?,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,871,"['Cute', 'little', 'movie', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'clean', 'flow', 'easy', 'watch', 'rainy', 'Sunday', 'However', 'was', 'watching', 'decided', 'do', 'quick', 'internet', 'search', 'adorable', 'Lois', 'Butler', 'nothing', 'married', 'Hall', 'Bartlett', 'writer', 'producer', 'director', 'same', 'year', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'Apparently', 'discrepancy', 'little', 'fact', 'other', 'two', 'wives', 'show', 'up', 'bio', 'Lois', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'can', 'find', 'stopped', 'working', 'was', 'married', 'can', 'deduce', 'Hal', 'reputation', 'career', 'divorced', 'soon', 'nothing', '1989', 'young', 'age', '58', 'Now', ""'m"", 'intrigued', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'died', 'content', 'story', 'took', 'tragic', 'turn.If', 'anyone', 'info', 'let', 'know', 'then', 'do', 'legacy', 'favor', 'post', 'info', 'IMDB.Thanks']",Mickey
