Malu's mother and Jorgito's mother were not on friendly terms becuase of their social and political differences. Malu's mother wanted her daughter to associate with people who were more upwardly mobile. She went through great lengths to ensure that her daughter would grow up to be a mature, young lady--English class, ballet, and piano. Jorgito's parents, although married, have marital problems. Jorgito's father is kept away from the family because of his job. And to make matters worse, he beats on his son to get him to be more masculine.When Malu's grandmother dies, her mother is ready to get out of Cuba and start anew in another country. All she has to do is get her ex-husband to sign the permit to leave the country. Malu is saddened by this because she doesn't want to leave her friends and Jorge behind. Malu has to find her father so he won't sign the permit to leave the country.Jorge and Malu go on a journey to find her father. Their relationship is tested when they visit various places and meet different people. They are determined to find Malu's father and stay together. Back home, the mothers, in their frantic state, have yet to find common ground and see that their children are compatible for each other.This movie is great for all ages because it reveals the boundaries of friendship and what it means to be a child in a country that is strifed with political issues.

In turn, she took me to watch the SF International Film Festival and Viva Cuba was one the films we watched.  I only read the blurb about the movie in the program but otherwise did not know what to expect.I was stunned by the story of the two young kids who strove to preserve their friendship despite the many challenges that they faced.  However, the one that that stood out was the ending of the movie.  Without giving anytime away, the ending was ambiguous yet appropriate.
