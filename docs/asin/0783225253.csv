If you've had a bad day, put this movie on and it will raise your spirits. The storyline portrays a series of confrontations between an underestimated mouse and two opposite-minded brothers who have been willed a house occupied by the mouse. In order to sell the place (which they discover is worth a fortune), the boys must evict the mouse. The mouse proves to be an able adversary and gains the upperhand more often than not. The humorous scenes have a logical progression to them that makes the movie absolutely funny. You find yourself thinking: ""That's what I would do,"" only to discover the mouse still gains the advantage. Others have described this movie as ""hiliarious"" but I would prefer to call it ""absolutely funny."" The humor will never go out of style.This movie will not disappoint you. It even has a happy win-win ending which is what everyone wants when they cheer for ""the little guy."" This is an excellent addition to any home video library.

The movie is funny, and the chemistry between Nathan Lane and Lee Evans is good. In fact, the performances are generally good. Walken is hilarious as the overly intense exterminator. Even the mouse is great. Beyond that, though, the broad slapstick humor is rather predictable and gets somewhat repetitive by the end. Also, for a movie that would appeal to kids, there are a couple of sexually oriented bits that are just a little too much (i.e. Vicki Lewis in a sexy outfit and Lane with his hand way down the front of a woman's dress).If some unsubtle laughs fit the bill, MOUSE HUNT isn't a bad choice. It's funny enough that most folks will get some chuckles out of it. I have a copy on my shelf and can give it a mild endorsement. Just don't expect too much.

Once I sat down and did just that, Nathan Lane and Lee Evans were perfectly cast for this roller coaster of a comedy that, once you get past the over the top story line and the fact that it gets a big hand by CGI (what, you thought they trained a real mouse to do all these stunts?), this movie is non-stop fun with just enough assistance from characters outside the main three, which of course includes the mouse. Christopher Walken particularly gets large laughs from a short amount of camera time (unlike ""The Wedding Crashers""). Some great situations in this flick lead to huge laughs. If you have visions of ""Tom and Jerry"" or even ""Road Runner"", don't be embarrased, as this film draws inspiration from such  programs, as well as classic TV and film comedies.

So I decided why not and bought Mousehunt on DVD.Mousehunt involves two brothers, Ernie and Lars Smultz (Nathan Lane and Lee Evans respectively) inheriting their father's string factory and an old decrepit house. After Lars is thrown out of his house by his wife and Ernie loses his reputation and restaurant after a fatal incident involving a roach, the two move in together at the old house where they ultimately discover the house they believed to be worthless is actually worth millions. Unfortunately, the house also comes with another tenant--a single mouse that seems to be much smarter than the average mouse.Much of the humor of the movie comes from the two brothers' efforts in getting rid of the mouse who just seems to survive everything and turn it back on the humans.It's really more of a slapstick kind of comedy movie. Perhaps as much as The Three Stooges might have been, but it's there.There's a few more special features on the DVD than this Amazon page lets on. Listed on the back of my DVD are ""From The Cutting Room Floor"", production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, and the theatrical trailers (none of which I have actually watched yet since getting the DVD recently).But I should point out though the DVD I received is NOT the one used in the main image. I got the one that looks like the third image, with Nathan Lane in a chef's hat and the mouse on front so that might be the reason.It's certainly just a fun movie, if anything.

Rodents are never appreciated under the best of circumstances.  In this context, you actually find yourself cheering for him.  The attempts to kill the intruder are varied and many, from a psychotic cat that can't be killed (Catzilla) to an expert exterminator (played to perfection by Christopher Walken).  Everything they try backfires in an ever escalating fashion.  ""This is how accidents happen.""  One brother observes.  Boy, is he ever right!  And even though they believe they can outsmart the mouse (""I like to use both sides of my brain.""), bad luck and their own incompetence constantly gets in their way.Yes,  the premise is limited to the title, this is a movie about hunting down and killing a mouse.

51918,A2BPDFR58H9575,0783225253,Galina,"[3, 3]","This movie came with the highest recommendation from my friend who insisted that I should watch it. I missed it when it was released and I was not too eager to see a family live/animated drama about two simpletons who want to get rid of the mouse in the house but in the traditions of Tom and Jerry or Home Alone always get outsmarted by a much smaller but smarter, quicker and unpredictably creative opponent. But hey, when someone whose opinion I respect tells me that it is one of the greats and I must keep my expectations high, I at least should check it out and see for myself. The fact that it is included in many viewers' Top 10 lists like BIG TIME SLEEPERS, Forgotten Gems, and Laugh-out-Loud actually added to my interest and anticipation. Besides, any movie with Christopher Walken doing what he does best - a crazed, creepy, and funny character, is a must see.So the story is simple - once there was a mouse, a very smart mouse that lived in an old mansion alone. One day, two brothers (rather losers) who inherited the house found out that it was a forgotten architectural masterpiece worth of millions. They wanted to sell, the mouse wanted to stay -thus the epic Mousehunt began. I am happy to report that I had a truly wonderful time watching the movie. It is darkly funny and creative. It combines live action and animation masterfully and seamlessly, and one hilarious scene runs after another without any pause culminating in the auction sequence that was made as an astounding mixture of slapstick comedy and disaster movie. Another favorite scene was at the animal shelter where Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) wanted to get the meanest scariest cat, ""and preferably with a history of mental illness. I'm talking' one mean pussy"", in short -not just a cat but Catzilla. Christopher Walken's exterminator who took his job very seriously by trying to get inside the mouse's mind and to think how the mouse thinks, delivered a delightful cameo. I also think that the movie benefits tremendously from its timeless look meaning that we don't know in what decade of the last century it takes place but that's exactly what makes it universal. It won't look outdated for many years from now.The film was a first feature for its director Gore Verbinski, who had stunned millions of TV-viewers in 1993 when he created now legendary Budweiser commercial featuring three croaking frogs, for which he was awarded the advertising Silver Lion at Cannes and also received four Clio Awards. Verbinski then delighted the whole world with three (well, he delighted this viewer - with two) films of Pirates of Caribbean. For some reasons, Mouse hunt received controversial and rather harsh reviews from the critics that accused the film of not been able to find a target audience and not creating any characters the public could identify with and root for. I believe it is a great film for the whole family, and it talks about serious mattes while entertains. I was fascinated by the clever inventive little mouse, and the movie kept my interest and child-like joy until the very end. Even the fact that the premise of the movie in not new or original did not make it any worse.

It's easy to see this sort of thing turning into a Home Alone type thing with the mouse dishing out cruel punishment after cruel punishment. However it's more than that, although it has elements of those films. The film is witty - mixing the slapstick with a more adult humor and, although the slapstick is cartoony, it is also clever and imaginative in most cases.The strength of the film is in three performances. First and second are Lane and Evans, both having an air of Laurel and Hardy (especially Lane) and they make for a good double act. Lane gets to do his usual stuff while the more goofy antics of Lars suit Evans' stand-up routine background to the ground. However the main success is the mouse. In other hands he would have been a mere excuse for destruction, however here he has `humanity' - a character if you will. This is perfectly demonstrated by the unintentional chase with a nail gun - how dramatic! How tense! But also how touching - the mouse is given intelligence and has a motivation for what happens.Of course at heart this is a kid's film and it is a very good one at that. However these other points give it the feel that it was made for adults too. Certainly the inclusion of Walken as a pest controller is one no child will get.Overall this is well made and is more that just a crude slapstick affair. It can be enjoyed on that level but it just feels that little more mature. To illustrate what I mean - can you imagine the difference if Chris Columbus had directed it?

51936,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,0783225253,Joshua Koppel,"[1, 2]","Last week, thanks once again to the wonderful Patio theater located on Irving Park at Austin, I caught a delightful fantasy film.  It was the Dreamworks production Mouse Hunt.Two brothers inherit the family string business (Smuntz String) and a run-down old house.  Neither is worth anything.  Or so it seems at first.  The house was designed by an eccentric architect named LaRue and was believed to be only a rumor.  Suddenly the house is worth millions.  Instead of selling outright, the brothers decide to hold an auction to get a better price.  But to reach that point they need to do some restoration and get rid of a very determined mouse.There are then some scenes of the brothers trying to outwit a mouse that could outwit Einstein.  Finally they think they have sent the mouse to Castro and the auction begins.  As the price reaches unheard of levels the mouse returns.  The brothers are so distraught that they bring about their own ruin and destroy the house.  Having nowhere else to go they return to the old string factory.  The mouse follows.Once in the factory the mouse shows some more of its intelligence by starting up the factory line and adding Gouda to the mix.  The result is a new form of string cheese that becomes the rage with the mouse hired on as head taster.This movie is truly hilarious.  The mouse is great.  I believe the mouse is near immortal as well as a genius.  I believe this because there is a tendency for owners of the LaRue house to be found locked in a trunk in the attic.

Nathan Lane and Lee Evans play Laurel and Hardy/Abbot and Costello roles.  Lane is a chef who loses his gourmet restaurant and his reputation.  Lane is a naiive, good-hearted guy married to a gold-digging witch.All the brothers have left is the string factory and the mansion.  Lane just wants to cash in and get out, while Evans is nostalgic, and can't bear to part with Pop's beloved string factory.The mansion turns out to be a lost house by a famous architect.  The brothers want to fix the place up to sell at public auction, and that is when the fun starts.A little gray mouse wants to live peacefully in the mansion.  But Lane says even one ""vermin"" is too many.  The mouse proceeds to outwit the hapless duo and stuff his face with goodies as the house is trashed.  Will it be ready again in time for the auction?The film is in the style of the screwball comedies of the 1930's.  Judging by clothes, cars, and speech, the film is set around the 1940's.

When things aren't going well at the factory he keeps his word not to sell it, and eventually they have to close the doors of the family business.The brothers learn that in addition to the string factory, they have inherited a house which neither had ever heard mentioned before. After they discover that a famous architect designed the house and it could be worth a fortune, the brothers turn their focus to fixing up the place to sell it. Of course, the mouse is in the house and the war is on! Reminiscent of classic cartoons which involve a chase but one party is never successful, the mouse eludes capture. He manages to outwit the brothers, a mean cat, and an expert in pest removal who is extensively attuned to the hunt and employs some unorthodox methods.Together, the brothers journey down a path replete with misfortune.

51955,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0783225253,Michael Butts,"[3, 4]","Watching MOUSE HUNT took me back to the days of those zany Road Runner cartoons, where no matter what he did Wiley Coyote could never outsmart the roadrunner.  Or even the Abbott and Costello movies, where the blundering Costello was always getting Abbott in trouble.  In MOUSE HUNT, Nathan Lane (Birdcage) and Lee Evans (Freeze Frame) star as two brothers who inherit not only their father's (William Hickey in his last film role) string factory, but a dilapidated old house that turns out to be worth a fortune.  BUT, the house is currently occupied by a randy little mouse who just doesn't want to give up his territory.I think this movie is wonderful, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The mouse effects and the little creature himself are so intriguing; the physical comedy is some of the best since the old Dick Van Dyke shows.  Lee Evans steals the movie as brother Lars, a slightly challenged young lad, whose naivete, honesty and boyishness fit the role to a tee.  He is brilliant and I look forward to seeing more of this talented actor.  Nathan Lane underplays Ernie somewhat, but even in that, his comic genius is evidenced.

The camera work is perfect. The choreography of the workers and machines is a pleasure to watch. It bodes well, and similar scenes later in the film are also excellent, as the camera follows our hero mouse as he navigates rube-goldbergesque paths through the old house in which he lives.Unfortunately, everything else about the film is much worse. The story involves two hapless brothers, reduced to penury and near-homelessness, who discover that a decrepit house willed to them by their father is fantastically valuable. All they need to do is to make one $1200 mortgage payment. They decide also to kill a mouse living in the house.As a result, we get 90 minutes of humiliation and mayhem, as they are stripped naked, dropped in icy ponds, hit by busses, and totally destroy the house. I found myself wincing over and over again. The guys were simply not hateful enough to make their suffering amusing. I just wanted it to end.In the end, thanks to a deus ex machina, things turn out a little better for them, but by then the damage has been done.Much of the movie might be amusing to a ten- or twelve-year-old, who would take it as a live action cartoon.

But by the 1990s, robots and computer effects had advanced to the point that the two funniest animal comedies featured a pig and a mouse.  This was the less famous of the two, but is every bit as good.  The story is simple; two brothers inherit a mansion and try to spruce it up for an auction.  Unfortunately for them, a mouse inhabits the mansion and counters their every move.  Their game of cat-and-mouse ends with the mansion being destroyed.  The movie is a comedy, and like all good comedies, it examines a fundamental human flaw, in this case greed.  The greed of the two brothers, their families, and of the various individuals who want to buy their mansion.  The mouse itself looks quite real, even in the close-up shots.  The style of comedy is a combination of old-fashion slapstick, wry British dialogue, and the occasional dirty joke.  But overall, the entire movie is suitable for all ages.Some notable things about this movie.  First, it was the first big outing for Gore Verbinski, who would go on to make Pirates of the Caribbean.  Second, one cannot spot a single brand name in this movie.  Only one other movie has such a distinction; Dick Tracy.  And like Dick Tracy, the viewer really cannot guess the decade in which this movie takes place.  For sure it happened in the 20th century, since a television, radio, and automobiles are present.

Instead, the Smuntz brothers Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (British comedian Lee Evans) inherit a worthless string factory and a run-down old Victorian house from their freshly-deceased father.  Financial and marital reverses force the latter day Laurel and Hardy to go live in the old manor and confront the uber-mouse who regards the place as his own. When the duo discovers that the house is a priceless architectural gem, they try to eliminate the mouse.The slapstick, technically impossible mouse-elimination schemes evoke Tom and Jerry and the antics of Wile E. Coyote.  On the way, they get fine cameo support from Christopher Walken as a demented exterminator.The film wonderfully sends up many stereotypes like the Mafia-esque Zeppo Corporation that wants the factory, the absurd Belgian hair models, and the clich&eacute; bidders for the house.  But, in the end, the rodent is triumphant and the brothers must reach a modus viviendi.There's a lot of dark humor and witty dialogue.  Lane steals the film.

This movie is a battle of wits between humans and a mouse. Two men inherit a string factory and an old, run down house from their dad. Throughout the film, they battle to get along, but the hunt for the mouse brings them closer. The two brothers, Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) are hilarious!I enjoyed ""Mousehunt,"" but it was hard to sit through at times because I love animals so much that it made me a little nervous. It is funny and also has some adult humor. The sets are amazing! They look as if they were torn apart, flooded and even bombed in one case! The writers do a fantastic job with the comedic timing. It kept me laughing the whole time!I love Caesar (Christopher Walken) because he is very serious and so funny at the same time. He is the exterminator who Ernie and Lars hire to kill the mouse. He comes into the house telling the brothers that this will be super easy. He is no ordinary exterminator, because to find out about the mouse he eats and smells the poop! This mouse even out-smarts Caesar. The character Caeser really pulls this film together. I love Christopher Walken from other films such as ""Hairspray"" and ""Click.""My favorite scene is when Lars is in the string factory. He is trying to work the factory by himself because all the workers are on strike. It's really fun to watch because every piece of his clothing gets caught.

The rundown manor is an architectural masterpiece known as ""The Lost LaRue"". Ernie and Lars - one fired from his job and the other thrown out by his wife - decide to live in the house, fix it up, and cash in by selling it at a private auction. They soon find out they have a roommate in the form of a resolute rodent who has no intention of vacating the premises. Think ""The Roadrunner"" as you watch this seemingly indestructible mouse go from one extreme escape to another.Mouse Hunt is a dark comedy, seemingly made for kids but really highly inappropriate for children. There are countless violent scenes (though it's mostly people who wind up this side of sore), including an implied one with a little girl sobbing as her kitten is dropped off at the pound and promptly gassed to death.
