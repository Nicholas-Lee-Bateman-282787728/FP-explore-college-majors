1057453,AUJEF31CXWTCQ,B000NJMJJ8,Amazon Customer,"[35, 37]","The Final Patient is the story of Dr. Dan, a small town doc who is rumored to have unique abilities. When a local boy gets trapped under a 6,000-pound tractor, Dr. Dan rushes to the rescue and hoists the child free. Rumors run rampant...it is here the story begins.The two core actors, Bill Cobbs (Dr. Dan) and Jason Scott Campbell (Willy), put in very solid performances. They hold the screen during the middle act, keeping us riveted where many actors would fail. They are the glue of the movie. Because of them, you will keep watching.The story is unique, fresh, and for the most part a joy to watch. Please remember that this a lower budget indie, so what you get is a simple, intelligently written story, as opposed to the usual Hollywood grind. This is a good thing.I like this movie, and would watch it again. It has a few flaws, namely some herky jerky and distracting camera movements that occasionally draw you from your immersion in the film, and some horribly over-acted, over-dramatic minor actors. You will get your fair share of exaggerated facial expressions and insecure, flat dialog in the first 15 minutes. But hang in, things get much better.Another flaw is the last scene. It didn't feel right in the movie. A mysterious butterscotch candy wrapper(s) lying on the hospital bed would have been a more suitable ending for the feel of this flick.Please see The Final Patient. Give some love to this indie film. It deserves a viewing.",5,"Good, with a few flaws",1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1451,"['Final', 'Patient', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Dan', 'small', 'town', 'doc', 'who', 'rumored', 'have', 'unique', 'abilities', 'When', 'local', 'boy', 'trapped', '6,000-pound', 'tractor', 'Dr.', 'Dan', 'rescue', 'child', 'free', 'Rumors', 'run', 'rampant', 'here', 'story', 'begins.The', 'two', 'core', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Dr.', 'Dan', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Campbell', 'Willy', 'put', 'very', 'solid', 'performances', 'hold', 'screen', 'middle', 'act', 'keeping', 'riveted', 'where', 'many', 'actors', 'would', 'fail', 'are', 'glue', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'watching.The', 'story', 'unique', 'fresh', 'most', 'part', 'joy', 'watch', 'Please', 'remember', 'lower', 'budget', 'indie', 'what', 'get', 'simple', 'intelligently', 'written', 'story', 'opposed', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'grind', 'good', 'thing.I', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'few', 'flaws', 'namely', 'herky', 'jerky', 'distracting', 'camera', 'movements', 'occasionally', 'draw', 'immersion', 'film', 'horribly', 'over-acted', 'over-dramatic', 'minor', 'actors', 'will', 'get', 'fair', 'share', 'exaggerated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'insecure', 'flat', 'dialog', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'hang', 'things', 'get', 'much', 'better.Another', 'flaw', 'last', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'movie', 'mysterious', 'butterscotch', 'candy', 'wrapper', 'lying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suitable', 'ending', 'feel', 'flick.Please', 'see', 'Final', 'Patient', 'Give', 'love', 'indie', 'film', 'viewing']",The Final Patient

This is certainly not a gore fest but it does provide a fare share of genuinely creepy moments and I found myself liking it a lot.

This was a very inexpensive Blu ray and I love to poke in one of these haunting stories late on a rainy night when I can't sleep usually because my pain meds haven't kicked in yet.  It can be a wonderful diversion if the movie turns out to be a good one.  Often times, I find myself disappointed in the writers efforts or the poor decisions of the directors.Tonight, on a rainy Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprised for a change.  I plan to keep this one and take it over to mom's and let her enjoy it.  The story moved along like a big budget production.  It followed a logical path and looked like anything but a frightening tale for most of the movie.  Yet the story was interesting as old Doc saved a young boy from a tragic accident but appeared to be unusually strong for his age and condition while saving this kid.  The story develops from there as the people of this small town are naturally curious about these occurrences.  The acting was strong, especially by Bill Cobbs who I have seen in other movies.  He's a very good actor.This movie is not anything like ALIEN except that the novelty of the story reminds me of that fine movie.  It's an unusual tale that doesn't involve ghosts or real monsters. But the delivery is definitely creepy.  Great effort!  I really enjoyed it.  Some of these movies I watch and then give them away for others to enjoy.  But, like I said, I will be keeping this one in my CREEPY LIBRARY!  Spend the five bucks for the Blu ray and enjoy it.
