Although Justin does have talent (instrumental and vocal), I did not see something that truly amazed me.  Take any great singer off of the street and they could take Justin's place.Some songs were catchy and they reminded me of A-Teens, but I liked A-Teens better. His genre is definitely geared towards young girls/women.  The music industry will do whatever it can if they think they can make money and this is apparent while watching the movie. I noticed how Usher, who originally pushed Justin aside, went clamoring for a piece of the action when Justin became popular.His story really was not that interesting and neither was the movie.  If you are a true true fan you might love the movie; otherwise, it's kind of boring. You'll be watching some old home movies, see some crazy fans, and be watching some of his on stage performances.",1,Just another internet sensation.,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,918,"['Justin', 'career', 'was', 'really', 'product', 'mass', 'advertising', 'internet', 'Justin', 'have', 'talent', 'instrumental', 'vocal', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'something', 'truly', 'amazed', 'Take', 'great', 'singer', 'street', 'could', 'take', 'Justin', 'place.Some', 'songs', 'were', 'catchy', 'reminded', 'A-Teens', 'liked', 'A-Teens', 'better', 'genre', 'definitely', 'geared', 'towards', 'young', 'girls/women', 'music', 'industry', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'think', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'apparent', 'watching', 'movie', 'noticed', 'how', 'Usher', 'who', 'originally', 'pushed', 'Justin', 'aside', 'went', 'clamoring', 'piece', 'action', 'when', 'Justin', 'became', 'popular.His', 'story', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'interesting', 'was', 'movie', 'are', 'true', 'true', 'fan', 'might', 'love', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'kind', 'boring', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'old', 'home', 'movies', 'see', 'crazy', 'fans', 'be', 'watching', 'stage', 'performances']",Justin Bieber: Never Say Never

It is a very well written and edited documentary/performance showcase of Justin and his music career.  As far as the movie goes, it was interesting the entire way through and the performances were entertaining.I'm really not sure why anyone would call Justin Bieber talentless.  To me he seems like a kid that was born with a gift of music and performing, and ALSO got a lucky break, but earned it, and has enjoyed success from it.  Justin is not unlike any other artist that has enjoyed the magical mix of talent, hard work, perseverance, and luck to become successful, regardless of musical genre.I'm definitely not a Bieber lover, I'm a little too old and male and into alternative rock, but I AM a Bieber liker and supporter of his work, and definitely cannot think why I would blindly be a Bieber hater just because he plays different music than I prefer and he has a little kid voice.

I therefore clearly understand the pre-teen girl craze which he has generated. These 'customers' are like dry sponges and will absorb anything Beiber-like that is thrown at them. They are in 'fantasy land' and at their ages one cannot blame them for their views & the light hearted approach that their lives should be. They will have fond memories of this era. His concerts are disproportionately populated with young girls, albeit not all pre-teens. Now don't get me wrong, I did buy Beiber's album 'My World 2.0' after hearing Baby, but & here is the big but; I cannot understand what kind of struggle they are trying to portray that he has suffered. He got turned down by a few radio stations & he was not signed by the first label he approached?! There are thousands of artists that have had it more difficult than Beiber. This does not strike me as a great 'overcome all the odds' story it is mean't to be. He is good but not yet great. His stage performances are very generic & his moves are predictable and not very creative. His songs are sweet but has not gone to that next level. O.k. so he sold out MSG, but this kid cannot & I repeat cannot be compared to Michael Jackson! Michael had more talent in his little finger than Beiber. Does he have potential, sure! But he has not yet arrived to be classified with the likes of Michael Jackson.

This movie portrays that he is just a regular, sometimes goofy kid with some incredible talent.  He does have a good voice-just not impressed with lyrics but enjoyed hearing him sing other artists songs.  It does seem like he has some very grounded people in his life and hopefully they can keep him from being morphed into whatever it is hollywierd turns these kids into these days.  I actually got a little teary when his gramps talks about how he misses having him around all the time but that at some point you have to let go.

I did keep hearing about him in the news and saw him on David Letterman. The perfume he was promoting sounded fascinating so I went looking for it at Walmart. They didn't have it so I ended up ordering the perfume from amazon.So seeing Justin on David Letterman got me wondering how he became so successful and this movie/biography answers all those questions. I was amazed at how talented he was on the drums as a young child. I told my husband he had to watch this! So we ended up watching together.I was pretty much blown away by the entire story. It reminded me of all the Beatles biographies I've seen. Yes, the screaming girls get to be a bit much but most of the time you could still hear the lyrics in the songs. I noticed that the songs were pretty innocent for the most part and definitely geared for the teenage heart.But what surprised me the most is how personable and loving Justin Bieber is at heart. He truly seems to love his fans and goes out of his way to make them happy. This story also explains the power of social media and how you can reach millions of people in an instant. I like that Justin Bieber really started off on youtube and how he used twitter to rally his supporters when he went to radio stations across the nation.This guy is really a hard working artist who has earned the respect of millions just by being himself. I was also amazed at how good he was on the piano, guitar and drums. It is like his talent knows no limits. Watch this and be amazed!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.

I understand what it's like to be a teenage girl smitten with a male singer. I was diehard over Immature a little over a decade ago. It's fun to have a crush on someone who has the looks, charm, talent and a positive story. But being honest, I hadn't paid much attention to him. I knew he was doing songs with some folks that I would've never thought would work together (i.e., Ludacris, Chris Brown, Usher [before I knew his relationship with Usher]). I wasn't a fan or a non-fan. He was just a kid with hair over his eyes. I saw him on ""The Conan O'Brien"" show and Chelsea Handler (who I very rarely watch)'s talk show, and he was entertaining on both. I was amused and then intrigued. The Peeps falling on his head was what got me. But what really made me say, ""Okay, let me find out who this boy is"" was watching Street Kingdom openly embracing dancing to a Justin Bieber song on ""America's Best Dance Crew."" If this many grown-ups wanted to collaborate with him, clearly there's something about him that's magnetic. On top of that, Street Kingdom's performance to that song was the best one they'd done on the show (IMO, and I am a fan of their dancing). So I finally gave in and rented this movie. Crazy part is I loved it! I watched it twice and will probably buy it because I don't want to return it.Favorite scenes to rewind: I ""awe'd"" so many times while watching him tell the camera that he was going outside to shovel snow. Just the way he said it with that big grin on his face was adorable. I liked how he approached that (very surprised but cool under those circumstances) violinist and encouraged her dreams, too.Other great parts: Watching him SNAP on those drums made me go, ""Okay."" Graduating to a guitar and playing that well? Hmmm, even better. I like musicians who really understand music--they can PLAY music as well as SING. I think those artists are better at performing because they understand both sides of the music arena, and he gets it. There were plenty of joking moments. Listening to all the trials he went through to be heard made me appreciate his struggle. Overnight success? Not really. He worked hard to get to the top no matter how much more quickly he got there (leaving the country he grew up in, marketing himself through social networking, over 80 tours nonstop, going up to big-name artists with all the guts in the world trying to impress them with his vocals). I thought it was great that he was so affectionate with his mother and even his guy friends. No pounds here. They hug with both arms. He genuinely seems like a friendly guy who keeps a warm social circle around him. His (grandmother?) telling him to clean his room was the best. Gotta love that! In the photo shoot, he calls little girls ""sweetheart"" like he's my age instead of 16. He's got a little bit of an old soul in a teenager's body, and his talking voice reminds me of a blues player. I liked seeing him be a kid as much as seeing him make adult decisions.Of course I expected the loud screaming, stalking, grabbing and jumping onstage. I expected all the cutesy songs. But I FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY was impressed by a collaboration. When Boyz II Men sang backup for him to that song ""You Smile,"" that was the first time that I felt he was working with artists who complimented each other instead of just trying to cross over or be diverse. The other artists who worked with him (again, subtracting Usher because of the relationship the two have) just seemed like a stretch to me. Then we got to Boyz II Men and Jaden Smith. Jaden doesn't need any help, especially with his parents being who they are. I liked seeing Boyz II Men and Jaden perform with him because they meshed well. Considering the type of music that Justin sings anyway, it just seemed like Boyz II Men was a no-brainer. He's got R&B; clearly embedded in him, and it's working to his advantage because even when he sings a pop song, he has a little swagger in it.I remember seeing Ray J. on some show talking about Justin and the ladies. Brandy interrupted him and said Justin's mother might be watching the show. For all of you who saw the show I'm talking about (can't remember what it was), yeah, I'm leaning towards what Ray J. said, too. He's going to make some young lady very happy as he grows. I think Usher is his best mentor because he can show him what it was like to be that young, successful and have that many women falling all over him. The rest of his camp seem to have his best interest at heart (from the film at least), but I am glad Usher didn't blow him off a second time. Anyway, great film. Entertaining. I even downloaded a couple songs after hearing them sung live. I might buy his CD now.I look forward to watching him grow.

We see clips of the YouTube performances that received millions of hits and led to his signing by Scooter Braun, who turned Bieber into a hugely popular teen idol and performer.  The film is standard bio-lite, and raises a few questions that are never really answered.  What kind of schooling does he get?  How does he maintain a rigorous concert and personal appearance schedule?  We see his Mom a lot but his father only once, briefly.  What kind of relationship does he have with his Dad?The one person who seems to offer Bieber some grounding is his vocal coach, Jan Smith, who appears genuinely concerned for Bieber the kid, not just his vocal cords.  There are appearances by Usher, Miley Cyrus, and Jaden Smith, who perform with Bieber, but it's Bieber who takes center stage for most of the film.  A countdown to a concert at Madison Square Garden is employed to build excitement, though it merely serves to interrupt and distract.  A highlight is a sequence of Bieber playing a drum solo that is very impressive.  He's very good with the drumsticks.There are loads of extras that fans will love.
