Coming of age story featuring Larenz Tate as a sheltered, introverted pyromaniac teenager, who's best friend is a doll. During summer of 1977, teenager takes family-trip north to Martha's Vineyard, to visit extended family.  Larenz Tate, was a little old for this role, even in 94, but he is convincing enough to pull it off. During this trip Tate's character is faced with several issues, including sex and adulthood. He forges a relationship with a neighboring therapist, who explains that being different is not really that bad. He starts to explore his new found sexuality with a naive vulnerability. He succumbs to the selfish demands of the Jada Pinkett character, Laura, who has her own use for Tate. Joe Morton and Glynn Turman, as always give enjoyable performances. Both characters are memorable, since they are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Turman, the staunch conservative, and Morton, the ultra-liberal ex Black Panther, who's views clash with Turman.

The movie is In the Realm of the Senses.To reach this point we've witnessed a sad, odd and serious tale of sexual  obsession that takes place in 1936 Japan. A handsome owner of an inn dallies with a new maid. Soon after, he leaves his wife and they embark on a life bounded by the paper walls of a small inn they moved to. Sada is driven by the sexual needs her mind and her body must have, all focused on Ichizo Ishida. Ishida, sexually experienced and confident, is at first delighted. He takes the initiative and reciprocates with as much aroused response as she. Their needs and their pleasures move them toward more exciting territories, including some that your granny might frown upon. It does not end well. Yet the movie, written and directed by Nagisa Oshima, is so somber and so respectful of the two characters that it is difficult not to be drawn to both of them.We've also reached this point by watching any number of explicit sex scenes. Oshima in an interview called his movie hard-core pornography. By this I think he meant that In the Realm of the Senses his actors performed hard-core unsimulated sex featuring fellatio, full intercourse, fondling of each other, male erection and sex with three or four minor characters. But this is no hard-core porn movie. Well, yes it is, partly. Well, no, the movie is a serious work from a serious artist.When Ishida says, ""Since life is a fleeting charm, you can have my life if you want it."" he has become as obsessed as Sada, and for both, sex and life have become so intertwined that satiation immediately leads to arousal. It may be that Ishida has remarkable powers of recovery. It may be that he occasionally complains of being tired or sore. As he becomes more of a willingly partner, she becomes more possessive and violent. As I mentioned, no happy ending.What does this all mean? I don't have the slightest idea.In the Realm of the Senses is a serious movie. Could it have the impact it does without the hardcore sex? I suspect so. I speak only for myself, but genitalia on stage or screen I find distracting. Sex and its apparatus are just too powerful to think they can be observed simply as a part of art or ""the human condition."" The need for sexual release is as powerful as the need to eat and drink. It is as natural as breathing. I'm talking sex, not procreation. When I, at least, see real sexual activity I tend to forget about the intent of the artist. I'll admit, however, that about two-thirds of the way through the movie the sex scenes seemed less compelling. I think most married couples might tell you the same thing.The two lead actors have my respect. They were doing all that we saw on screen, doing it in character and hitting their marks. They were believable. This was Eiko Matsuda's first movie. She made it when she was 24. After Realm she made six more, the last in 1982. I wonder what happened to her. Tatsuya Fuji was a well-known leading man when he made Realm. He continues to act.",4,"""You've such pretty hands.

188014,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,1572528338,Jeffrey Leach,"[8, 11]","I like Asian cinema. I really haven't seen all that many of these types of films, but the few I viewed over the past two or three years were excellent in terms of plot, special effects, and cinematography. The best thing about films from Japan and Hong Kong, and let's face it, these are the ones we're all talking about, is their non-western views about movie violence and adult situations. These guys are simply more willing to push envelopes we wouldn't think of touching. Well, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" not only pushes envelopes, it shreds them into tiny pieces. This taboo busting film claims a real event in 1930's Japan as the basis for a love story the likes of which you have rarely seen. This is the type of celluloid nightmare that stays with you long after the closing credits fade into darkness. ""In the Realm of the Senses"" mixes pornography, psychotic obsession, and grisly special effects to produce a volatile cocktail that will ambush those individuals not used to extreme cinema.Set in a Japan gearing up for war, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" introduces the viewer to a brothel where the young Abe Sada works. One of the regular customers is Kichizo, an older married man who enjoys the company of the geishas. It isn't too long before Sada and Kichizo meet, and the two rapidly move into deeper and deeper realms of obsession and sexual adventure. The game, although it sure doesn't seem like a playful adventure, transmogrifies into open menace on the part of Sada, who threatens to maim or kill Kichizo if he pays the slightest attention to his wife. Even the other women in the brothel become fearful and chary about the strange events unfolding between the two lovers. Sada and Kichizo stay in a single room for days, without bathing or cleaning the floors. The obsession the two possess for each other often causes day-to-day worries to fade into the background. Things sink to such a bizarre level that the conclusion really shouldn't come as a surprise, although it does because of its emotional shot to the stomach. This is an incredible experience that many will not or cannot fathom, let alone comprehend. I'm not sure I understand several of the film's elements, probably due in large part to the atrocious DVD version constructed by Fox Lorber.I recognize this is a foreign film and therefore possibly problematic for English speaking technicians, but this DVD is poorly made. The English subtitles rarely match up with the person speaking; the transfer doesn't look as good as it should, and even when I used the zoom function I knew I wasn't seeing the film the way the director intended. You get glimpses of how good the film must look when properly formatted and fully restored, such as brilliant flashes of color from Sada's kimonos and the lighting used by director Nagisa Oshima STILL looks great despite the bad transfer. A movie this powerful deserves much better than this stilted treatment. I've heard bad things about Fox Lorber concerning other DVD releases, and I tend to believe those statements now after seeing how they butchered this film.I am sure there are numerous subtexts drifting through ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" but I am not sure what they all are. I couldn't help but notice how the rigid Japanese social system repeatedly reared its head. The women all refer to Kichizo as ""master"" and readily submit to his attentions even when they do not wish to do so. That's what makes the conclusion so surprising; that a woman in Japanese society did what she did must have been absolutely mind blowing to the patriarchal social hierarchy. Another aspect of the film certainly dealt with the war and Japan's machismo based discipline, but I cannot say exactly how it fits into the picture. After all, I only noticed one scene where I saw any soldiers. Is the obsession between Sada and Kichizo paralleled with the deadly obsession Japan had for its war plans? I'm probably reaching badly with this, but Japan's disastrous bid for world domination must play a role in this somewhere.I won't watch this again until a company releases a decent DVD edition. I probably wouldn't watch it again soon anyway because the movie is so darn intense it takes awhile to absorb what you're seeing. It blows my mind that this got a theatrical release in the States back in the 1970s. I'll bet a lot of people had no idea what they got themselves into when they decided to spend a few hours with Nagisa Oshima's psychological tour de force.

188015,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,1572528338,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[26, 28]","The first impression that this film left, from the very first scenes, were the immense amounts not only of full nudity but also explicit sexual intercourse. Considering that this film was made in 1976, even the most unconventional European art cinema is relatively mild if compared to this. In fact, some scenes were so realistic and so arousing, that it was difficult not to get turned on.But besides the obvious sexual aspects, this film will continue to spark many controversies for years ahead.  The ending of the film was so realistically done, with violently colored bloodstreams in horror film style that I wondered if the actor was permanently harmed.Without any doubt In the Realm of Senses is not""porn"" nor is it ""art"", it is instead a look into the depths of love that has become completely obsessive with no rules, and no boundaries. There have been many movies about obsessive love, but none of them compares to this one, maybe in part because this is a true story. The character Sada definitely holds the movie as the obsessive lover. It's a film about how our desires can withdraw us from society, reality, or even out own consciousness. We become so obsessed with life, material things, people, and our obsessions can kill us. We become voyeurs when watching this film. The director constantly challenges us to look and to see how the two main characters see each other. The film is a commentary on Japanese society, as we see a woman dominate a man sexually. He withdraws from his position in society and from the military dictatorship that runs Japan.

Frankly, it doesn't matter whether or not is pornographic in nature. I don't even care that there was as much sex in it as there was.What bothers me is simply this: there isn't a story. I watched this movie after hearing many different things from many different people--I was told that it was a beautiful story about love, a disturbing story about obsession, a freaky naughty movie, and a brilliant artistic movie. People told me all these things and I watched it hoping to see strong characters and a powerful plot.The graphic sex isn't my complaint. Or even the fact that Oshima filmed real sexual acts instead of simulated ones (although that is, to me, a very troubling fact). My complaint is that the movie is an hour and forty minutes, but only about five minutes of that time is spent trying to get us to have any compassion for the characters. The rest of it is spent on sex scenes that never seem to work together to create any semblance of a story.What are their motivations? Who knows--it seems like they just want to have sex. Their dreams? Who cares--they're having lots of sex. Are they in love? Who could tell--all they do is have sex and obsess with each other. What are their personalities like, I wonder? You'll never figure it out--the movie spends all of two scenes trying to describe what kinds of people our hero/heroine are. The best I can understand is this: the woman likes to have lots of sex (I'm not being repetitive here--that's actually the line of dialogue that comes out of her mouth), and the man... well, they didn't really talk much about him. But my guess is that his personality involves sex.If you want a movie that is disturbing, then by all means watch this one. Oshima does a great job of creating something bizarre and disjarring, but he hardly creates something important (or even entertaining). By the end of the movie, you don't feel as if you have just gained anything from viewing it. Instead, it feels like you've just watched two people have lots of sex... and that's about it.People have made much of the beauty of this film, but it is neither erotic or meaningful. With flat characters and non-stop sex sequences (not to mention the aimless, gratuitous rape scenes), it seems less like a movie and more like a documentary on the Nature channel. Swap the Japanese setting with the Serengeti and you'll quickly find yourself wondering why we're calling this movie such a wonderful achievement in cinema. ...",1,Pornography?

188021,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1572528338,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[28, 30]","""For four days, carrying the part she'd severed from his body, Sada wandered through Tokyo.  Those arresting her were astounded that she glowed with happiness.  The story shocked all of Japan.  The compassion of the people made her strangely popular.  These events took place in 1936.""As described by the final voice over of the narrator, the subject matter of ""In the Realm of the Senses"" is the most lurid true story to come out of Japan in the years before World War II.  On May 18, 1936, a woman named Sada Abe strangled her lover, Kichizo Ishida, during sex at the hotel he owned.  Sada was a maid in the household, having apparently retired from being a prostitute, and began an affair with her master that explored passion and pain during sex.  That he would permit her to erotically asphyxiate him might have been enough to make this story a national sensation, but after Kichizo was dead she amputated his genitals and carried them with her as she wandered the streets of Tokyo for several days before she was arrested.Nagisa Oshima's 1976 film tells the story of this troubled relationship, although it does not end with Sada's capture, but with her holding her dead lover after she has taken her grisly memento and written ""Sada and Kichi, now one"" in his blood on his chest while we hear the finally narration.  Prior to that the film is about the dynamic of the relationship between Sada and Kichizo, with their sexual relationship explicitly presented as they travel the road to their entwined destiny.  Consequently, I would consider ""In the Realm of the Senses"" to be a dramatic film with explicit sex scenes rather than a pornographic film with strong dramatic elements.  What you think of the film might well depend on whether you consider the sex scenes to be gratuitous or erotic, although certainly there are other reactions.  Simply knowing what you are going to see may be more than enough to dissuade you from seeing the film.For me the eroticism is tempered by the omnipresent fact that in the end Sada is going to kill Kichizo and amputate his genitals, and there is nothing sexual in the film that is going to make me forget what is going to happen in the end.  Nor is there anything here to suggest that the director is thinking otherwise.  In the climactic scene the camera is shooting from in front of the couple, with the emphasis on his bound hands and her pulling on the scarf around his neck to cut off his air, and not on where their bodies are joined.  Their sexual pathology is displayed and not explained, but I do not think Oshima can be faulted for failing to explain the unexplainable.  We see how their sexual activity moves in inexorably in its fatal direction, and how the willingness to go beyond all the way becomes part of their attraction to each other.  Ultimately the question is not whether the film is sexual, but whether the true story it tells feels real, and by that standard I think it succeeds.The movie is currently rated NC-17, but was obviously first rated X by the MPAA.  Oshima was unable to finish the film in Japan because of censorship laws, which is why the production is officially listed as being French and the undeveloped footage was shipped to France for both processing and editing.  In Japan the sexual activity has been optically censored ever since the 1976 premier.  The United States and the Netherlands are some of the only countries where the film has been available in completely uncut editions.Sada was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison, but her sentence was commuted in 1940.  Assuming an alias she married, but her husband divorced her when he discovered her identity.  She then became an actress, actually portraying herself in several productions about the infamous incident, but after 1970 she dropped from sight and her final fate remains unknown.  In addition to ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" the story has been told cinematically in ""A Woman Called Sada Abe"" (1975) and ""Sada"" (1998).  However, this version is far and away the most notorious, and for good reason.  For many people simply hearing her story is enough and they will have no desire to see it depicted cinematically.

188023,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,1572528338,Little Roy Blue,"[10, 16]","""In the Realm of the Senses"" is a beautifully shot, well-acted film that is incredibly controversial -- and, in my view, incredibly dull. I found it to be a lovely-looking exercise in tedium.The plot, such as it is, concerns a man and a woman in obsessive lust with each other. They have sex many times. Many times. Many, many times. These scenes are not particularly erotic or titillating; their lovemaking seems compulsive and peculiarly joyless. Anyway, even if a viewer starts out thinking of this film as sexually exciting, the ultra-violent ending (which I won't spoil here) will certainly kill that feeling.In the liner notes of the rather excellent Blu-ray, Japanese film historian Donald Ritchie very persuasively argues that the film is too artistic to be dismissed as porn. However, he further argues that it is an effective critique of the repressive aspects of Japanese society, and on this point Donald and I must part company. In my view, the film contains far too little historical context or explicitly political content to count as a significant critique of 1930s Japanese militarism (or, for that matter, mid-1970s Japanese society). Sure, the film contains one interesting image of the male protagonist walking in the opposite direction from a column of soldiers -- but one shot does not constitute an entire political argument.Perhaps the film is more meaningful for Japanese viewers, who can pick up on subtle historical allusions and understand better the restrictive moral standards that the director is attacking. However, as an American viewer, I pretty much missed all of the social commentary. Besides, the main characters are so narcissistic -- and so cruel to other people -- that I fail to see what makes them appealing as ""rebels."" If I had to choose between living like these creepy, obsessive lovers, or living in human society with all its dull restrictions, I think I'd gladly pick society! There is such a thing as rebelling in the wrong way, you know?Anyway, political mumbo-jumbo aside, my main problems with this movie are that it's very thin on incident and very thin on characterization (we know almost nothing of the protagonists, except that they really, really like each other).

Not only is it beautifully filmed but the atmosphere is quite vivid in its' depiction of a Japanese servant girl who becomes mistress of the master of the house and sexually obsessed with their relationship. She leads him deeper into the sexual realm until it becomes the focus of both their lives. Their relationship becomes so intense that it can only lead to destruction. Film is extremely sexually graphic and to be honest, I wasn't even aware that I was watching ""pornography"" because the acting and story were so mesmerizing. By then, I didn't care because it wasn't offensive---just honest. The two leads are wonderful actors and they made me forget I was watching a supposedly one-time controversial film.

188026,A3JZ5L52FM318H,1572528338,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[20, 45]","The Film:Man. Where to start. Well, my expectations going in were that it would be a portrayal of pre-War Japanese culture and its taboos, with some explicit sex thrown in. While I certainly got the latter, the former was almost no where to be found.Apparently, it is a re-telling of an historical event in which a young woman, Sada Abe, engages in an affair with an older, wealthier married man, and eventually kills and castrates him. Well, the affair, a bunch of sex, and the climactic assault are present, but that's about it. There is a 30 second scene with soldiers marching down the street, and that's about it for context. Mostly, it is a terminally boring parade of sex scenes which, while explicit, don't even function to titillate my prurient interests.Sada fellates and fornicates in various combinations, has sex with a few other men in order to raise money, and they secret themselves away from his wife in resorts and are served wine by geisha. Lather, rinse, and repeat for 1 hour and 42 minutes, and then get the knife out for the ending. The plot, such as it was, was completely and totally uninteresting, not to mention extremely difficult to empathize with or understand the pseudo-human emotions involved. Is this woman a nymphomaniac? Is this man stuck in a suicidally boring marriage? Why are they so enraptured by each other? Is it physical? Spiritual? Some sort of inter-class cross-pollination which adds so much excitement to the coupling that it becomes irresistible? We are left only to speculate as minute after minute of excruciating sex play unfolds.To be fair, some of the compositions are nice, and some images are beautiful. Frankly, the most interesting image of the film was the couple walking down a riverbank in the rain, their umbrella twirling ahead of them. The amphitheater scene before the finale is well composed, as well.So I wouldn't call it utterly worthless as a piece of cinema. But 2 or 3 minutes of interesting images surrounded by more than 1.5 hours of pointless inanity doesn't strike me as a worthwhile bargain.I was glad my PS3 has a function that allows watching films in 1.5x speed while keeping the sound on. This means I saved about 34 minutes of my life for other more important things, such as clipping my toenails, watching paint dry, or playing ""Freecell"" on my laptop. Let me say, though, that I did my level best to watch the film on its own merits and let it breathe. I just appreciate the ability to compress a lost evening once it becomes clear that the merits are too few and far between.The Blu-Ray:The video transfer gives us a roughly 16:9 (very slightly pillarboxed on the sides) color image which has much to recommend it. Detail isn't knock your socks off, but it is certainly better than most DVDs, especially of 1970's material. Colors are very deep, especially reds, and black levels, though spotty in some interior scenes, are superb in outdoor scenes.This is yet another respectful and reference quality Criterion transfer of an older film. Grain is present but not obtrusive, edge enhancement is not noticeable, detail is good, color is spot on. Kudos to Criterion for another job well done.Extras include some interviews with director and cast, a commentary by a British film historian, some deleted scenes (none of which were interesting or provided the much needed context this film was DYING for), and a trailer.******Overall, I give this Blu-Ray 2 stars, mainly for its quality and faithfulness to the material. I  found the film almost completely worthless. I imagine there are some ""cineastes"" out there who will go on and on about how meaningful or profound or erotic this film is. Well, they are in for a treat. This is the best, most faithful presentation of the film I can imagine. Their Blu-Ray dollars will be well spent.But that doesn't mean you ought to be fooled by their pretension. This film is just plain dumb, terminally boring, completely un-sexy, and frankly pointless. I didn't learn anything about early 20th century Japan, I didn't understand the human condition any better, I hadn't grown as a person from watching this film.My point in reviewing this is not to denigrate the opinions of others. It's to warn people that they shouldn't dive in blindly because it's by Criterion, who have put out many, many CLASSIC ""art films"" in wonderfully high-quality editions (a few that spring immediately to mind: Spartacus. The Third Man. Seven Samurai. M. The Ice Storm.) Well, this is an art film, sure. But it's also a bad film. Really, laughably bad. I'd hate for someone to buy this based on reputation alone without even considering the various opinions out there (including all of those here) and get turned off to art cinema, or Criterion, altogether. So I write a review, as someone who enjoys film as art, to contribute to the dialogue.Check out the films of Wong Kar-Wai if you want similar themes with better acting, editing, and writing. Just don't dive in and shell out the money based on reputation alone, or on Criterion's lovely packaging. With feeling: Rent it before you buy it.",2,Obscene? Maybe. Boring?

Not that those classifications were new, but those were made by critically acclaimed filmmakers.  Having seen those films and many others of the genre, Nagisa Oshima's film stands out.While it is also violent, the notable characteristic is the sex.  And I'm not talking about simulated sex; I'm talking about real sex...at least between the two primary characters.  Sada Abe is a 20 something servant of her master Kichizo.  To make ends meet, she's also a part time prostitute.  Based on real events in the 1930's, married Kichizo takes up with Sada.  Not as a concubine but as another ""wife."" They can't keep their clothes on or their hands off of each other.  Sada, in particular appears to have true nymphomaniac symptoms.  While perhaps thinking of her lover, she still has sex with other men including a vagrant living on the street and a school principal who is satisfied with just her company.Sada makes no secret of what she wants and where she wants it.  This leads to sadomasochism and in one dream sequence, borderline pedophilia.  Many critics hail the film as groundbreaking, powerful, impressive and so on.  I will give it credit for being groundbreaking.  It is the most graphic and explicit ""art"" film I've ever seen.  Technically, the film is well made.  The acting is pretty good.  Remembering impressive dialog while engaging in sex can't be easy.  Is this film worthy of great praise?  Well, I don't think so.

Though the sex scenes are graphic, they are not at all stylized to arouse. In fact, they are painful to watch as the characters get caught up in their obsessions with each other. If that was the intent,the film makers achieve this beautifully.I think any viewer that has experienced being in  deep ""lust"" can empathize with the irrational desire to not want to leave that realm of the senses created by really, REALLY, good sex (the title is very appropriate). Inevitably, things fall apart but while one is in the moment, the moment feels like the edge of the world. I think this film drives that message home in very blunt, and quite horrific terms (the scene with the children and the ending are disturbing).However, I did find myself a bit bored by the characterizations or the lack thereof. I wanted to know more about Sada and her lover. The one scene that sticks out in my mind is when the actors actually have a too brief dialogue about their childhoods. While I didn't find it erotic or the characters very interesting (perhaps I would have felt different if I had seen the other movies about Sada or knew more of the story?), I still think it was worth watching (as an inexpensive rental- not necessarily a buy).

(Thesis: the idea of a fixed definition for the term ""pornography"" depends on an impossibility: a fixed definition for the term ""art."" Discuss.) That's a question you're likely to find yourself asking pretty much constantly while watching In the Realm of the Senses, Nagisa Oshima's infamous 1976 feature that takes the ""Banned in Boston!"" clich&eacute; one better--it really was banned. But, of all places, it was banned in New York. Now that takes some doing.Based on a true story, In the Realm of the Senses is the story of Sada (Eiko Matsuda), an ex-prostitute who goes to work as a servant in the house of Kichizo (Bright Future's Tatsuya Fuji). Kichizo takes notice of her, and it doesn't take long before that notice becomes something more. Kichizo spirits Sada away to another city, where he sets her up in a different house and carries on life as a bigamist. Sada, however, is the jealous type, and eventually begins to resent Kichizo's other family.Perhaps the big difference between art and porn is there there's an actual story. (Or the surprisingly small number of close-up shots so common in porn.) And there is one, here, though if you find yourself with a dubbed version, you'll spend half the time you watch it snickering at the silliness of the English voices. (The other half, of course, you will spend happily fapping away and wondering how this movie managed to get out of Japan without those silly blurring effects over the bits you're not allowed to see in Japan.) But pay attention, will you? Obviously, in any film that aspires to be porn, something must be sacrificed, and much of the time, that something is character. And it is true that our main characters here are, perhaps, less well-developed (in the sense of screenwriting, anyway) than we would like. But we know enough about them to enjoy this, and far more than we do about any characters we might have ever run across in a straight porn film. (Or a gay porn film. You know what I mean.) You have character, you have plot, you have wonderful cinematography (I'm willing to put the overly-dark nature of many of the interior shots down to a degraded master and/or bad DVD transfer)--looks like art! *** ",3,Hardcore art.,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,2288,"['Realm', 'Senses', 'Nagisa', 'Oshima', '1976', 'What', 'difference', 'art', 'pornography', 'Thesis', 'idea', 'fixed', 'definition', 'term', 'pornography', 'impossibility', 'fixed', 'definition', 'term', 'art', 'Discuss', 'question', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'asking', 'pretty', 'much', 'constantly', 'watching', 'Realm', 'Senses', 'Nagisa', 'Oshima', 'infamous', '1976', 'feature', 'Banned', 'Boston', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'better', 'really', 'was', 'banned', 'places', 'was', 'banned', 'New', 'York', 'Now', 'doing.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Realm', 'Senses', 'story', 'Sada', 'Eiko', 'Matsuda', 'ex-prostitute', 'who', 'work', 'servant', 'house', 'Kichizo', 'Bright', 'Future', 'Tatsuya', 'Fuji', 'Kichizo', 'notice', 'her', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'notice', 'something', 'more', 'Kichizo', 'Sada', 'away', 'city', 'where', 'up', 'different', 'house', 'life', 'bigamist', 'Sada', 'however', 'jealous', 'type', 'eventually', 'resent', 'Kichizo', 'other', 'big', 'difference', 'art', 'porn', 'actual', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'small', 'number', 'close-up', 'shots', 'so', 'common', 'porn', 'one', 'here', 'find', 'dubbed', 'version', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'time', 'watch', 'snickering', 'silliness', 'English', 'voices', 'other', 'half', 'course', 'will', 'spend', 'happily', 'fapping', 'away', 'wondering', 'how', 'movie', 'managed', 'get', 'Japan', 'silly', 'blurring', 'effects', 'bits', ""'re"", 'not', 'allowed', 'see', 'Japan', 'pay', 'attention', 'will', 'Obviously', 'film', 'be', 'porn', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'much', 'time', 'something', 'character', 'true', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'perhaps', 'less', 'well-developed', 'sense', 'screenwriting', 'anyway', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'far', 'more', 'do', 'characters', 'might', 'have', 'ever', 'run', 'across', 'straight', 'porn', 'film', 'gay', 'porn', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'have', 'character', 'have', 'plot', 'have', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', ""'m"", 'willing', 'put', 'overly-dark', 'nature', 'many', 'interior', 'shots', 'down', 'degraded', 'master', 'and/or', 'bad', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'art', '***']",In the Realm of the Senses

When i got to the end i read that this was a true story and i had no choice but to start watching it all over again.I dont like messing up anyones day by giving away anything in a movie so i'll describe it as a very simple story about a middle-aged married man and a young woman servant of his who just clik toghether and have lots of sex and go completley insane. Well, that is, insane to us, the ""moral majority"".  The more they connect by having sex the deeper they dive into a hole of passion and pleasure and reality is just not part of their world anymore.But to them life is good and all is well as long as they're toghether and in bed.The phrase one man's meat is another man's poison comes to mind. And that's the way life is.

I thought it was just another squishy Euro art film about Asian sensuality, so didn't give it much thought, or a watch.  Then recently I read the full story of Sada Abe and knew I had to watch the movie.  And it was not a disappointment, not in the least.Pornographic?  That's a matter of taste and appreciation for the work.  I don't see it as such, not even close.  It's packed with explicit sexual content, most definitely, but that does not make it pornographic.This film's NC-17 rating makes theNC-17 Henry and Junelook like children's programming.  From the opening minutes, the sexual activity and depiction of it is absolutely unflinching and direct.  I found that surprisingly refreshing, that the main subject of the movie is actually depicted honestly and clearly, not simulated, not hinted at or hidden.  Guccione (kind of) tried to get there withCaligula, but didn't get it right.  This film most certainly does.The sexual content is intimate, tender, cruel, infuriating, brutal, erotic and more, a lot more.  I was reminded ofA Real Young Girl, but the content here is much more abundant and explicit.And that ending, with the cutting-off scene.  Really, really bloody and gnarly, quite unpleasant to watch, but I did very much appreciate that it was related completely and honestly, adult content for an adult following and contemplating the story.In the end, the story develops and it's wonderfully ambiguous if Sada is an insanely jealous lover, or if her man is so stricken by her that he knowingly and willingly completely surrenders to her, solely for her pleasure.  Kind of a reversedStory of O, maybe.  As for the interpretations of feminine response to emerging Japanese imperialism, I didn't really see that.Bottom line: this is serious art-cinema for the serious and mature movie lover.  This film is not about hot and romantic sex for the purposes of setting a mood or arousal.

188041,A65D3EGFDW6SZ,1572528338,"Sophia Bezirganian ""Bibliosophy""","[7, 9]","Reviewers are to put it mildly, quite ambivalent about this movie!  Some hate it saying it's 'nothing more than porn', others are puzzled by the seeming paradox of such extremes, of both 'love and aggression' existing in the very same tale, especially since the tale's 'hero' and 'heroine' start out, and remain throughout, till the end, a most unlikely pair to choose as one whose love, initially so playful and innocent looking, will grow into something very different. But really, the concept dramatized by this movie, that passion is a turbulent mix of 'love and aggression', is not new.  And it can be found in many tales of passion throughout history, and today.  These two opposite (but not necessarily opposing if blended right) drives (love/aggression), are to be found, in fact, (as more subtle less extreme forms), in all human activities that passion enters into--i.e. most activities in the 'playground' of being human, in which play park of course, love and sex play starring lead roles! This movie highlights this paradox in such a dramatic way, that we cannot avoid noticing it!  However, to KNOW that this paradox exists, in passion, is quite a potential 'eye opener', and one of the basic truths of being human! And this movie did bring it home.Also, for me, the movie was quite believable in its portrayal of the crazy slide from lust and playfulness, and thrill-seeking, at first, to obsession, then addiction. As such, the movie's plot makes total sense.  It followed the classic pattern of evolution seen in many compulsions--from mild, to moderate, and finally, to extreme, of crazy and destructive activity, that is generated by the obsessive's need to CONSTANTLY UP THE ANTE to ever increasingly extreme stimuli, to maintain the same level of thrill!  This pattern, in my view, if accepted by the viewer, makes this movie not at all paradoxical or unbelievable, but a very true and sad classic portrayal of the tragedy of obsession and compulsion.  The movie is worth watching for this alone!  Not to mention, I must say, before the climactic last 30 minutes, I found the sex portrayed as quite hot, loving, and far from cheap robotic stuff that merits the label 'porn'!",5,"hot erotic, but ultimately sad classic tale of  passion's fate when obsession takes over",1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,2195,"['Reviewers', 'are', 'put', 'mildly', 'quite', 'ambivalent', 'movie', 'hate', 'saying', ""'nothing"", 'more', 'porn', 'others', 'are', 'puzzled', 'seeming', 'paradox', 'such', 'extremes', ""'love"", 'aggression', 'existing', 'very', 'same', 'tale', 'especially', 'tale', ""'hero"", ""'heroine"", 'start', 'remain', 'till', 'end', 'most', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'choose', 'one', 'love', 'initially', 'so', 'playful', 'innocent', 'looking', 'will', 'grow', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'really', 'concept', 'dramatized', 'movie', 'passion', 'turbulent', 'mix', ""'love"", 'aggression', 'not', 'new', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'many', 'tales', 'passion', 'history', 'today', 'two', 'opposite', 'not', 'necessarily', 'opposing', 'blended', 'right', 'love/aggression', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'fact', 'more', 'subtle', 'less', 'extreme', 'forms', 'human', 'activities', 'passion', 'i.e', 'most', 'activities', ""'playground"", 'being', 'human', 'play', 'park', 'course', 'love', 'sex', 'play', 'starring', 'lead', 'roles', 'movie', 'paradox', 'such', 'dramatic', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'noticing', 'However', 'KNOW', 'paradox', 'passion', 'quite', 'potential', ""'eye"", 'opener', 'one', 'basic', 'truths', 'being', 'human', 'movie', 'did', 'bring', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'portrayal', 'crazy', 'slide', 'lust', 'playfulness', 'thrill-seeking', 'first', 'obsession', 'then', 'addiction', 'such', 'movie', 'plot', 'total', 'sense', 'followed', 'classic', 'pattern', 'evolution', 'seen', 'many', 'compulsions', 'mild', 'moderate', 'finally', 'extreme', 'crazy', 'destructive', 'activity', 'generated', 'obsessive', 'need', 'CONSTANTLY', 'UP', 'ANTE', 'ever', 'increasingly', 'extreme', 'stimuli', 'maintain', 'same', 'level', 'thrill', 'pattern', 'view', 'accepted', 'viewer', 'movie', 'not', 'paradoxical', 'unbelievable', 'very', 'true', 'sad', 'classic', 'portrayal', 'tragedy', 'obsession', 'compulsion', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'Not', 'mention', 'must', 'say', 'climactic', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'found', 'sex', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'hot', 'loving', 'far', 'cheap', 'robotic', 'stuff', 'label']",In the Realm of the Senses

Fans of Tatsuya Fuji's semi-flaccid member need look no further.  Because the movie consists almost entirely of unblinking depictions of sexual acts it can get a little boring.  The only real plot arc is an ever deepening repertoire of kink, and the deliberately claustrophobic atmosphere ultimately wears on you in a bad way.  By the end I wasn't shocked at the characters' transgressiveness so much as annoyed by their irresponsibility.  Breath play can be safe if done properly!  What's the matter with you people, don't you read Dan Savage?However, a lot of my impatience with the movie was due to the fact that I lacked the cultural context.  Only after I had finished watching it did I read the essay in the booklet the accompanies the disc and learn that ""In the Realm of the Senses"" is based on a real event from 1936 that has entered Japanese folklore and been the subject of other, less explicit, films.  Presumably a Japanese audience would have already been familiar with the basic story, so would have been more likely to find the single-minded fixation on sex to be an interesting retelling rather than disconcerting or dull.  Apparently the movie is also a commentary on the sexual repressiveness and growing authoritarianism of 1930s Japan, though I didn't pick up on that at all.  The one scene of Imperial Army soldiers marching down a narrow street seems disconnected from the rest of the action, and if all you had to go on was this movie, you'd think that pre-war Tokyo was just one big orgy.As a Japanese cultural artifact, a case study in late-twentieth century obscenity laws, and a representative of a certain affectless style of cinema, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" is interesting, but I can't say that I enjoyed it.",2,It Does Go On,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2142,"['thought', 'practice', 'depicting', 'unsimulated', 'sex', 'pornos', 'was', 'something', 'only', 'began', 'recently', 'movies', 'like9', 'SongsandIntimacybut', 'here', '1976', 'joint', 'French-Japanese', 'production', 'Realm', 'Senses', 'explicit', 'sex', 'could', 'ask', 'copious', 'nudity', 'penetration', 'age', 'inappropriate', 'couplings', 'things', 'had', 'never', 'occurred', 'do', 'hard-boiled', 'egg', 'Fans', 'Tatsuya', 'Fuji', 'semi-flaccid', 'member', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'movie', 'almost', 'entirely', 'unblinking', 'depictions', 'sexual', 'acts', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'boring', 'only', 'real', 'plot', 'arc', 'ever', 'deepening', 'repertoire', 'kink', 'deliberately', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'ultimately', 'bad', 'way', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocked', 'characters', 'transgressiveness', 'so', 'much', 'annoyed', 'irresponsibility', 'Breath', 'play', 'can', 'be', 'safe', 'done', 'properly', 'What', 'matter', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'Dan', 'Savage', 'However', 'lot', 'impatience', 'movie', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'lacked', 'cultural', 'context', 'Only', 'had', 'finished', 'watching', 'did', 'read', 'essay', 'booklet', 'accompanies', 'disc', 'learn', 'Realm', 'Senses', 'based', 'real', 'event', '1936', 'entered', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'been', 'subject', 'other', 'less', 'explicit', 'films', 'Presumably', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'familiar', 'basic', 'story', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'likely', 'find', 'single-minded', 'fixation', 'sex', 'be', 'interesting', 'retelling', 'rather', 'disconcerting', 'dull', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'also', 'commentary', 'sexual', 'repressiveness', 'growing', 'authoritarianism', '1930s', 'Japan', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'marching', 'down', 'narrow', 'street', 'disconnected', 'rest', 'action', 'had', 'go', 'was', 'movie', ""'d"", 'think', 'pre-war', 'Tokyo', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'Japanese', 'cultural', 'artifact', 'case', 'study', 'late-twentieth', 'century', 'obscenity', 'laws', 'representative', 'certain', 'affectless', 'style', 'cinema', 'Realm', 'Senses', 'interesting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed']",In the Realm of the Senses
