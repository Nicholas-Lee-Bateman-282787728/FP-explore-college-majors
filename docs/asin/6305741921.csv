He travels from the UK to LA  and begins looking into his daughter's recent death with a gut feeling that  Jenny's car wreck was not an accident.  There Wilson meets Jenny's closest  friends and asks them all about her life in LA.  He soon targets Valentine  (Peter Fonda), Jenny's lover, as the obvious culprit.That's  the surface of the film, but there is another layer here that turned  standard thriller material into sublime art house fare.  ""The Limey"" is  very much a visual, cerebral film that moves in spirals and wanders through  a labyrinth of moods and lyrical images.  The film is finally all about  memories, and its climax is an epiphany of memory and of the strange  patterns that we fall into in our lives.""The Limey"" takes a  circuitous approach to the phenomenon of women falling for men like their  fathers and bringing their father-daughter baggage along with them.  What  trouble these relationships are the specific emotional patterns and games  people play, which are worked out in great detail between child and parent  very early in life.  So what happens when you bring all that to a  relationship with a new person who doesn't know the rules of your game,  doesn't know when you're bluffing or when you're making a serious threat?  Well, in a worst case scenario you might just end up dead.And how  does it feel, as a parent, to recognize your own handiwork in your child's  homespun catastrophe?  ""The Limey"" answers that question with the force of  Greek tragedy, and the answer rings true. The film is a rare cinematic  accomplishment, achieving both an honest emotional foundation for Wilson's  dark epiphany and a web of rich, resonant images that anchor the entire  experience in a vivid, dazzling tapestry.",5,"&quot;Tell me about Jenny,&quot; he whispered.",965520000,"08 6, 2000",2000,1854,"['Wilson', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'aging', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'capable', 'British', 'criminal', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'UK', 'LA', 'looking', 'daughter', 'recent', 'death', 'gut', 'feeling', 'Jenny', 'car', 'wreck', 'was', 'not', 'accident', 'Wilson', 'Jenny', 'closest', 'friends', 'life', 'LA', 'soon', 'targets', 'Valentine', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Jenny', 'lover', 'obvious', 'culprit.That', 'surface', 'film', 'layer', 'here', 'turned', 'standard', 'thriller', 'material', 'sublime', 'art', 'house', 'fare', 'Limey', 'very', 'much', 'visual', 'cerebral', 'film', 'spirals', 'wanders', 'labyrinth', 'moods', 'lyrical', 'images', 'film', 'finally', 'memories', 'climax', 'epiphany', 'memory', 'strange', 'patterns', 'fall', 'lives', 'Limey', 'circuitous', 'approach', 'phenomenon', 'women', 'falling', 'men', 'fathers', 'bringing', 'father-daughter', 'baggage', 'What', 'trouble', 'relationships', 'are', 'specific', 'emotional', 'patterns', 'games', 'people', 'play', 'are', 'worked', 'out', 'great', 'detail', 'child', 'parent', 'very', 'early', 'life', 'what', 'when', 'bring', 'relationship', 'new', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'rules', 'game', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'bluffing', 'when', ""'re"", 'making', 'serious', 'threat', 'Well', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'might', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'dead.And', 'how', 'feel', 'parent', 'recognize', 'own', 'handiwork', 'child', 'homespun', 'catastrophe', 'Limey', 'answers', 'question', 'force', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'answer', 'true', 'film', 'rare', 'cinematic', 'accomplishment', 'achieving', 'honest', 'emotional', 'foundation', 'Wilson', 'dark', 'epiphany', 'web', 'rich', 'resonant', 'images', 'anchor', 'entire', 'experience', 'vivid', 'dazzling', 'tapestry']",The Limey

Terence Stamp is incredible, a rather sinister good guy; like Dirty Harry with a conscience.What really makes this film so amazing, is the theme of time.

I don't want to say much because I would hate to give away  anything.There aren't really any &quot;bad guys&quot; in this film. It's  beyond that. Terence's character is perhaps his own worst enemy.It's a  powerful, stylish, thrilling film. It reinvents a genre in a much less  forced way than, say, Pulp Fiction. There may be cinematographic tricks,  but they serve a purpose, the stream of consciousness in the mind of a  confused, angry, sad man.As for The Who's song, &quot;The Seeker&quot;;  well, that is the opening theme and fits in so well and explains so much.

The Limey would be a very straightforward tale were it not for the usual inventiveness of Steven Soderbergh and the searing intensity of Terrence Stamp.Peter Fonda parodies his image quite effectively, and Luis Guzman (one of Soderbergh's house players) excels in his small role.  But the movie is all about Stamp.  I read an interview with Soderbergh in which he said that he didn't need special effects because he had the best special effect ever invented: &quot;Terrence Stamp's eyes.&quot;  A great line, and 100% dead-on correct.  On the larger screen, Stamp's eyes almost burn a hole through you.'Bowfinger' came out around the same time as 'The Limey,' and it features Stamp as the leader of a Scientology-like cult called 'Mindhead' (which Steve Martin's character humorously refers to in the film as 'Mindfffff...head').  Put these two roles together - along with his classic portrayal of a transsexual in 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' - and what emerges is the picture of an actor with amazing range.

For 90 minutes the viewer is treated to an out of order (whether the sequences are imagined or will become real remain to  be seen) story. The plot is of a man released from prison who wants answers  from a multi-millionaire music producer regarding the truth behind his  daughter's suspicious death.Terence Stamp's performance as the Limey is  what will keep the viewer's attention; He turns in one helluva performance  as a semi-rough around the edges yet-sophisticated English/Cockney gent  released from prison. The Limey almost comes across as a Charles Bronson  character, who despite his older man physical attributes, is still able to  do major damage control to those who cross his path and try to hinder his  &quot;investigation&quot;. He uses his somewhat subtle Cockney charm and  accent to accomplish his mission ( check out the scene where he is  explaining his actions in his thick accent to an interrogating police  detective; it's both critical and yet humorous).Is The Limey a sleep  inducer? No. Is it an action flick? No. However, when the scenes with the  Limey going in for the kill, what little action, are worth it with a  bang!The dvd transfer is clear and right on target with regards to color  and sharp images. The 5.1 Dolby Surround track delivers quite a punch (pun  intended). As a viewer with center channel capability I felt like I was  receiving the wallops in the bar scene !For anyone who thinks they  recognize Terence Stamp from a previous current film, they're right. He  appeared in Lucas' Phantom Menace as Chancellor Vallorum who was ousted  from his seat by Queen Amidala and the senate.I recommend this video for  it's strong characters and 90 minute length.

475163,AJQ1S39GZBKUG,6305741921,"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira""","[4, 4]","Steven Soderbergh is known as an director to whom everythings counts. He  always keeps up with the details. He uses many tecnical resourses in lightning, editing, in the score and the most from actors in order to achieve a higher level from all his movies .Actors like George Clooney --`Out of Sight' and `Ocean's Eleven'  -- and Julia Roberts  -- `Erin Brockovich' and `Ocean's Eleven'-- have done their best job with him. But in `The Limey' he has gone one step further what he'd done before. Not only does he get amazing peformances from Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, but he also makes of editing and lightning real characters in this film.Telling the story of a father, Wilson, who wants to revenge the mysterious death of his daughter and comes accross a music producer, who is the girl's ex-boyfriend, sounds rather like an excuse for Soderbergh  experiment in collors and cuts -- something that he used very often in his previous works and he would eventually use much more in the later movie `Traffic'. Moreover, he uses footage from the 1967 film `Poor Cow',  which also feautured Stamp. It is at least strange to imagine that something shot 30 years earlier would be useful and fitting. I think only Soderbergh's genius mind would think of such a thing. And the result is much better than any make or computer work.Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda --two icons of the `60s -- are at least impressive playing the main roles. Their `confrontation' is breath taking. The supporting cast also very effective. Luiz Guzm&aacute;n -- a Soderbergh 's favourite -- and Lesley Ann Warren play former friends of  Wilson's daugther.Lem Dobbs `s script along with the direction make the film very French New Wave, but with a touch of the thrillers from the `60s and `70s, like `Point Blank'. The soudtrack also fits the movie. Pay attention to the song played in the opening credits: The Who's ""The Seeker""; there couldn't be a music more perfect for Wilson.Definetely this quiet character-driven movie is not for everyone. People who know Soderbergh's work only from crowd-pleaser like `Erin Brockovich' may feel very uncorfortable watching this movie. But, by the way, this IS a film to make everybody unconfortable: it tackles moral issues, like revenge and guilt.

The supporting cast is very strong. Peter Fonda is not bad, somewhat effective, but unclear since he doesn't come across in this picture as a bad guy. He isn't totally viewed in a negative way, so that's why his character is in the haze. Luis Guzman gives his best performance again after his work in Boogie Nights. He remains an underrated actor. Of The Limey, I like the style, the use of flashbacks, and the cut-up in a back-and-forth manner. It was carrying the story along. However, the movie runs slow at times mainly due to lack of high energy. The Limey flattens out as the time wears on like a soda slowly fizzling back to its normal state after being initially jolted. Terence Stamp deserves most of the credit for bringing out the best of his character, especially when he throws his accent around and how he stares down a person. Nicky Katt also brings his uniqueness to The Limey in a different way with his professional hit-man style. Lesley Ann-Warren, making a surprising distance from her usual bad acting, sparks the movie with her role. All in all, The Limey is a very stylized, backed with some substance, medium-charged energetic movie, and I enjoyed the movie at an extent.10/10: Take a normal film, the director will follow the course of actions in a linear fashion. What makes The Limey different and a unusual picture is that the sequence of the course of actions is in this way: forward, backward, forward, backward a bit, and finally forward. Repeat that over and over throughout the picture with an occasional Easy Rider technique where one part very far ahead in time is inserted in the film early. The Limey is also watchable due to style over substance. The latter is nothing new; we all know that Terry Valentine had it coming to him. It was inevitable. So, Steven Soderbergh lets the audience to be more interested in how the revenge story is told. That's when things gets more interesting. Of course, the cast steps up and follows through. Terence Stamp is the biggest winner of the film; his style fits in perfectly for this character of Wilson.

Stamp is a fascinating actor to watch and listen to. He was very memorable in The Hit, especially in his reading of the John Donne sonnet; and he is not like anyone else. Here, he is totally unglamorous, even off-puttingly ugly, yet has a dominant persona. There is something wrong with this film, however, and perhaps it is just the director continually saying to himself and the audience: Look at me! I'm state of the art arty. The style is annoyingly obtrusive. Nearly the whole of the time your attention is completely taken up with the tricksy flashes --- to the point where nothing else seems to matter. Peter Fonda is too willowy for words. He doesn't seem to have enough spine even to cream off a money-laundering narcotics percentage, and it's difficult to envision him as anything more enterprising than a kept toy-boy, by someone like, say, Norma Desmond, or Ayn Rand.

Everyone says that she died in a car wreck, but Wilson suspects something more sinister afoot. His investigation eventually leads him to his daughter's older boyfriend, Valentine(Peter Fonda), a sleazeball music producer who has been up to no good, and then the quest for revenge starts.Okay, it's definately style over substance, but what style it has.

475169,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,6305741921,Bob Thompson,"[43, 48]","Steven Soderbergh's follow up to his wonderful 1998 film &quot;Out of Sight&quot; is more understated and subtle than most people might imagine. The Limey is in many respects the closest Hollywood has come in years to  filming a modern film noir picture.The main plot of the Limey is of  little to no importance. Terence Stamp plays a bitter old Englishmen who  comes to LA to seek revenge for his murdered daughter. His pursuit of  vengeance eventually leads him to a sleazy record producer, brilliantly  played by Peter Fonda.The Limey is a film that revolves around its use  of atmosphere. Soderbergh, forever a film geek, uses cuts in time and  flashbacks (a constant one to Stamp on a plane) to establish a dark gritty  atmosphere which he manages to sustain throughout the whole film.  The  scripting is a perfect fabrication of a film noir, every character is  menacingly constructed to be a worn out tough guy.If anything negative  can be said about the film is that it seems to go on a little long. In  actuality the film is perfect length but the many scenes without dialogue  make it seem longer than it is. Time and time again does Soderbergh cut to  shots of Stamp staring into thin air reflecting. It establishes atmosphere  wonderfully but if you are looking for a wild ride of an action movie the  Limey is not your cup of tea.The Limey is a movie that would be adored  by serious film fans but despised by the kind of people who go to the  theatre just to watch a fun popcorn movie.If you got this far and you're  reading this review then you probably love films.",5,A Modern Day Film Noir,952905600,"03 13, 2000",2000,1580,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'follow', 'up', 'wonderful', '1998', 'film', 'quot', 'Out', 'Sight', 'quot', 'more', 'understated', 'subtle', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'imagine', 'Limey', 'many', 'respects', 'closest', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'years', 'filming', 'modern', 'film', 'picture.The', 'main', 'plot', 'Limey', 'little', 'importance', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'bitter', 'old', 'Englishmen', 'who', 'LA', 'seek', 'revenge', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'pursuit', 'vengeance', 'eventually', 'sleazy', 'record', 'producer', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Peter', 'Fonda.The', 'Limey', 'film', 'use', 'atmosphere', 'Soderbergh', 'forever', 'film', 'geek', 'cuts', 'time', 'flashbacks', 'constant', 'one', 'Stamp', 'plane', 'establish', 'dark', 'gritty', 'atmosphere', 'sustain', 'whole', 'film', 'scripting', 'perfect', 'fabrication', 'film', 'noir', 'character', 'menacingly', 'constructed', 'be', 'worn', 'out', 'tough', 'guy.If', 'anything', 'negative', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'go', 'little', 'long', 'actuality', 'film', 'perfect', 'length', 'many', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'make', 'longer', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'Soderbergh', 'cut', 'shots', 'Stamp', 'staring', 'thin', 'air', 'reflecting', 'atmosphere', 'wonderfully', 'are', 'looking', 'wild', 'ride', 'action', 'movie', 'Limey', 'not', 'cup', 'tea.The', 'Limey', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'adored', 'serious', 'film', 'fans', 'despised', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'theatre', 'just', 'watch', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'movie.If', 'got', 'far', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'then', 'probably', 'love', 'films']",The Limey
475170,A5LNIF5QPQ0G6,6305741921,Brian A. Gross,"[4, 4]","The inevitable outcry of critics has finally touched director Steven Soderbergh.  He started his career with the indie cult favorite, Sex, Lies  and Videotape, but recently went on to commercial success with 1998's Out  of Sight and his highest budget picture to date, Erin Brockovich, starring  Julia Roberts.  Gus Van Sant and Sam Raimi recently went through a similar  transformations with their big budget releases; artists who start with  strong personal visions in their films and move on to higher budget and  ""name star"" casting unavoidably become critically marginalized, for better  or worse, when they move away from arthouse fare and to (hopefully)  profitable mainstream cinema.  In The Limey, Soderbergh proves that despite  his move towards matinee filmmaking he retains integrity in his work and an  exceptional sense of style.Terence Stamp plays a career criminal who  comes to Los Angeles to examine his daughter Jenny's death.  It is his  attempt to make sense of her passing and come to terms with the nature of  her life that was lived hidden from him.  Reminding me of The Sweet  Hereafter, it could be a companion piece to that film's undercurrent of a  parent dealing with his daughter's drug addiction and eventual death.  In  it, Ian Holm plays a lawyer who descends upon a small town offering his  services in the wake of a tragic school bus accident.  What Hereafter does  though is open up the multi-faceted nature of the man and documents his  dealings with his junkie progeny.  His own failings as a parent mingled  with desperate attempts to help her and disappointment in the weakness of  her will.Stamp's character shows that kind of introspection, but also  the quiet strength and purpose of the legendary bad*ss.  Released from  prison shortly before Jenny's death he arrives with newspaper clippings of  the event and the name of the man who sent them to him.  That man turns out  to be a friend of Jenny's named Eddie (played by the inimitable Soderbergh  favorite Luis Guzm&aacute;n) who she went to acting class with.  An appropriate  connection for disparate individuals living in L.A., including Jenny's  record mogul boyfriend, Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda), and her older friend  Elaine, a voice coach.Speaking of disparate, the soundtrack is a fine  amalgam of British rock and eerie compositions that mold to the atmosphere  of the story precisely.  The theme music is like two notes next to each  other being played back and forth, but bent in pitch, bringing to mind the  sound of a sonar display on a submarine.  It subtly matches the ebb and  flow of this brooding and moody film.The Limey is a rewarding film of  multiple layers, but Soderbergh does use flashback and time play to a point  that is maddening, the effect of using abstruse visual landmarks make it  appear like the filmmaker intends to insure that you see the film more than  once, just to understand all of it (not that a second viewing wouldn't be  worthwhile).  And you can't blame him considering the film is quite  conventional without the style - it serves to juxtapose the ideas of  narrative and deconstruct them by hearing a voiceover conversation while  staring at blank faces and blending multiple conversations into one stream  of congruence.  It is a hyperstyle cousin to his work in Out of Sight and  if he chooses to pursue this visuospatial design further I don't think it  will be worth watching.",4,S'cool Soderbergh Style,966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,3429,"['inevitable', 'outcry', 'critics', 'finally', 'touched', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'started', 'career', 'indie', 'cult', 'favorite', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'recently', 'went', 'commercial', 'success', '1998', 'Out', 'Sight', 'highest', 'budget', 'picture', 'date', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'starring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'recently', 'went', 'similar', 'transformations', 'big', 'budget', 'releases', 'artists', 'who', 'start', 'strong', 'personal', 'visions', 'films', 'move', 'higher', 'budget', 'name', 'star', 'casting', 'unavoidably', 'become', 'critically', 'marginalized', 'better', 'worse', 'when', 'move', 'away', 'arthouse', 'fare', 'hopefully', 'profitable', 'mainstream', 'cinema', 'Limey', 'Soderbergh', 'move', 'towards', 'matinee', 'filmmaking', 'integrity', 'work', 'exceptional', 'sense', 'style.Terence', 'Stamp', 'career', 'criminal', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'examine', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'death', 'attempt', 'make', 'sense', 'passing', 'come', 'terms', 'nature', 'life', 'was', 'lived', 'hidden', 'Reminding', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'could', 'be', 'companion', 'piece', 'film', 'undercurrent', 'parent', 'dealing', 'daughter', 'drug', 'addiction', 'eventual', 'death', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'lawyer', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'offering', 'services', 'wake', 'tragic', 'school', 'bus', 'accident', 'What', 'Hereafter', 'open', 'multi-faceted', 'nature', 'man', 'documents', 'dealings', 'junkie', 'progeny', 'own', 'failings', 'parent', 'mingled', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'help', 'disappointment', 'weakness', 'will.Stamp', 'character', 'kind', 'introspection', 'also', 'quiet', 'strength', 'purpose', 'legendary', 'bad*ss', 'Released', 'prison', 'shortly', 'Jenny', 'death', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'event', 'name', 'man', 'who', 'sent', 'man', 'out', 'be', 'friend', 'Jenny', 'named', 'Eddie', 'played', 'inimitable', 'Soderbergh', 'favorite', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'who', 'went', 'acting', 'class', 'appropriate', 'connection', 'disparate', 'individuals', 'living', 'L.A.', 'including', 'Jenny', 'record', 'mogul', 'boyfriend', 'Terry', 'Valentine', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'older', 'friend', 'Elaine', 'voice', 'coach.Speaking', 'disparate', 'soundtrack', 'fine', 'amalgam', 'British', 'rock', 'eerie', 'compositions', 'mold', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'precisely', 'theme', 'music', 'two', 'notes', 'other', 'being', 'played', 'back', 'forth', 'bent', 'pitch', 'bringing', 'mind', 'sound', 'sonar', 'display', 'submarine', 'subtly', 'ebb', 'flow', 'brooding', 'moody', 'film.The', 'Limey', 'rewarding', 'film', 'multiple', 'layers', 'Soderbergh', 'use', 'flashback', 'time', 'play', 'point', 'maddening', 'effect', 'using', 'visual', 'landmarks', 'make', 'filmmaker', 'insure', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'just', 'understand', 'not', 'second', 'viewing', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'worthwhile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'considering', 'film', 'quite', 'conventional', 'style', 'juxtapose', 'ideas', 'narrative', 'deconstruct', 'hearing', 'voiceover', 'conversation', 'staring', 'blank', 'blending', 'multiple', 'conversations', 'one', 'stream', 'congruence', 'hyperstyle', 'cousin', 'work', 'Out', 'Sight', 'pursue', 'visuospatial', 'design', 'further', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'watching']",The Limey

But ""The Limey"" is funky, less politically correct, and although the basic plot is pure greek tragedy, its nonlinear structure is more than tragic.

475173,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6305741921,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","When Wilson (Terence Stamp), a hard-edged working-class ex-con, gets off the flight from London to Los Angeles, you know that whoever he's looking for is going to have a tough time. Wilson is after whoever was responsible for the death of his daughter. He goes through people relentlessly and remorselessly until he finally deals with a record producer and drug dealer named Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda) and Valentine's hired protector and partner, Jim Avery (Barry Newman). Along the way he picks up a helper (Luiz Guzman) and meets a retired actress (Lesley Ann Warren) who makes him look at himself a little, but not for long.This is a first-class movie of revenge and retribution, with smart, sharp dialogue, efficient direction and terrific performances all around, especially by Stamp. He plays an aging professional criminal, tough as they come. Stamp at 60 nails the part. There's not an ounce of fat on the guy. His eyes stare coldly. When a big, muscular thug tries to eject him from a party at the hillside home of Valentine, Wilson tosses him off the cantilevered pool to his death. When several thugs rough him up in a warehouse, make fun of his age and toss him out into the parking lot, he gets up, walks to his car, takes up a gun and walks right back. Several of the thugs get hurt.Fonda also is very good. He plays Valentine as an amoral, self-delusional Hollywood player who is greedy and spineless. Newman is Fonda's muscle, and Newman comes across as almost as tough as Stamp.An amusing touch is a couple of flashbacks Wilson has, thinking of his daughter when she was a baby and he was with the mother. The flashbacks are taken from a movie Stamp made in 1967. This is typical of the clever directing of Soderbergh.

475174,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6305741921,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","Director Steven Soderbergh's 1999 so-called crime-action film, The Limey, is easily the best film of Soderbergh's that I've ever seen. Part of this is due to the innovative narrative structure that makes all but the most of the last few minutes of this great film a flashback, and the rest is due to an excellent script by screenwriter Lem Dobbs, whose other great success came a year earlier, in Alex Proyas's sci fi film Dark City. Both films, despite their seeming divergence, are acutely focused on human memory, and both deal with the fragility of such in novel ways. In fact, in rewatching The Limey on DVD, after six or seven years, and then watching it with the two available audio commentary tracks, I'm amazed to have seen something in the film that no other critic apparently has, and that is the fact that the viewer is never sure whether or not any or all of the remembered scenes depicted are, indeed, real (within the fictive cosmos the film resides in).The 85 minute long film quickly sets up the idea that the protagonist, named simply Wilson (and seemingly the same character as that portrayed in Ken Loach's 1967 film Poor Cow (called either Dave, or Dave Wilson- I'm not sure for I've never seen that film, and there are conflicting accounts as to whether of not that character had both names revealed), and portrayed by Terence Stamp, is an ex-con out for revenge following the seeming accidental death of his daughter Jennifer (Melissa George- as an adult), a young woman who was living with a shady L.A.-based record mogul named Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda). Within the film's first ten minutes viewers get the first 'action' scene of violence, and already identify heavily with the lead character, Wilson. The bulk of the rest of the film is about Wilson's memories (or fantasies?) of his daughter, from the time he is on board a return flight from L.A to the U.K., and all the critics agree that the film is a series of memories, even if they disagree about what is the actual present time it displays. Some critics, as example, claim the airplane scenes represent flashforths, not flashbacks; some that seem to be chronological (although the scenes seem to be in proximate chronological groupings, not individually chronological), while others are not; but not a single critic seems to have ever questioned the verity of what Wilson's memories are, or, if indeed, they are strictly memories, and not fantasies. After all, this film is a 'revenge film,' and revenge is, next to sex, the top theme of fantasies. Of course, some would argue that the scenes from Poor Cow seem to imply Wilson is all that he claims to be. But we only get snippets of this. Is Wilson really an ex-con? Likely. Is he in L.A. looking for revenge? Likely. But after that, is anyone really sure what is memory and what is fantasy, and, indeed, if Wilson's 'memory' is accurate? The Limey is the rare example of that most overused and abused term, an utter cinematic masterpiece that explores memory as a thing in itself, as a way to communicate, as well as a form of regret. It asks serious queries of the human psyche- not just those of kind like what is good?, or what is evil?, but those of degree like what constitutes a crime?, and when does it become a crime?, as well as the aforementioned queries of whether the film, the vehicle for this philosophizing, is dream, memory, fantasy, and if Wilson ever really gets (or got) off that airplane? To return to the aforementioned film, Another Woman, that film ends with the explicit question: Is a memory something you have or something you've lost? The Limey shows better than any film I can think of, that the answer to that query can be neither or both.",5,Masterpiece,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,3709,"['Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', '1999', 'so-called', 'crime-action', 'film', 'Limey', 'easily', 'best', 'film', 'Soderbergh', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Part', 'due', 'innovative', 'narrative', 'structure', 'most', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'great', 'film', 'flashback', 'rest', 'due', 'excellent', 'script', 'screenwriter', 'Lem', 'Dobbs', 'other', 'great', 'success', 'came', 'year', 'earlier', 'Alex', 'Proyas', 'sci', 'film', 'Dark', 'City', 'films', 'seeming', 'divergence', 'are', 'acutely', 'focused', 'human', 'memory', 'deal', 'fragility', 'such', 'novel', 'ways', 'fact', 'rewatching', 'Limey', 'DVD', 'six', 'seven', 'years', 'then', 'watching', 'two', 'available', 'audio', 'commentary', 'tracks', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'film', 'other', 'critic', 'apparently', 'fact', 'viewer', 'never', 'sure', 'not', 'remembered', 'scenes', 'depicted', 'are', 'indeed', 'real', 'fictive', 'cosmos', 'film', 'resides', '.The', '85', 'minute', 'long', 'film', 'quickly', 'up', 'idea', 'protagonist', 'named', 'simply', 'Wilson', 'seemingly', 'same', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Ken', 'Loach', '1967', 'film', 'Poor', 'Cow', 'called', 'either', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'Wilson-', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'conflicting', 'accounts', 'not', 'character', 'had', 'names', 'revealed', 'portrayed', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'ex-con', 'out', 'revenge', 'following', 'seeming', 'accidental', 'death', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Melissa', 'George-', 'adult', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'shady', 'L.A.-based', 'record', 'mogul', 'named', 'Terry', 'Valentine', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'film', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'viewers', 'get', 'first', ""'action"", 'scene', 'violence', 'already', 'identify', 'heavily', 'lead', 'character', 'Wilson', 'bulk', 'rest', 'film', 'Wilson', 'memories', 'fantasies', 'daughter', 'time', 'board', 'return', 'flight', 'L.A', 'U.K.', 'critics', 'agree', 'film', 'series', 'memories', 'even', 'disagree', 'what', 'actual', 'present', 'time', 'critics', 'example', 'claim', 'airplane', 'scenes', 'represent', 'flashforths', 'not', 'flashbacks', 'seem', 'be', 'chronological', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'proximate', 'chronological', 'groupings', 'not', 'individually', 'chronological', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'not', 'single', 'critic', 'have', 'ever', 'questioned', 'verity', 'what', 'Wilson', 'memories', 'are', 'indeed', 'are', 'strictly', 'memories', 'not', 'fantasies', 'film', ""'revenge"", 'film', 'revenge', 'next', 'sex', 'top', 'theme', 'fantasies', 'course', 'would', 'argue', 'scenes', 'Poor', 'Cow', 'seem', 'imply', 'Wilson', 'be', 'only', 'get', 'snippets', 'Wilson', 'really', 'ex-con', 'Likely', 'L.A.', 'looking', 'revenge', 'Likely', 'anyone', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'memory', 'what', 'fantasy', 'indeed', 'Wilson', ""'memory"", 'accurate', 'Limey', 'rare', 'example', 'most', 'overused', 'abused', 'term', 'utter', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'memory', 'thing', 'way', 'communicate', 'as', 'well', 'form', 'regret', 'serious', 'queries', 'human', 'psyche-', 'not', 'just', 'kind', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'evil', 'degree', 'what', 'crime', 'when', 'become', 'crime', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'queries', 'film', 'vehicle', 'philosophizing', 'dream', 'memory', 'fantasy', 'Wilson', 'ever', 'really', 'got', 'airplane', 'return', 'aforementioned', 'film', 'Woman', 'film', 'explicit', 'question', 'memory', 'something', 'have', 'something', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'Limey', 'better', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'answer', 'query', 'can', 'be']",The Limey

Every so often, Soderbergh likes to shake things up by doing one of these quick, down 'n' dirty indie films between big budget films.Terence Stamp has never been better as the hard as nails Wilson. With that steely glare and fierce determination you really begin to pity anybody who crosses his path. This is a really fascinating tale of revenge and, ultimately, redemption. I would have never thought of casting Peter Fonda as the heavy but he's quite good as the morally bankrupt baddie. He's almost overshadowed by the criminally underrated Barry Newman who plays his no-nonsense right hand man. Throw in Leslie Ann Warren and the always entertaining Luis Guzman (who gets some great lines in this film -- esp. during the party scene at Fonda's house), and you've got one helluva film.This DVD is particularly worth checking out for the rousing commentary with Soderbergh and the film's screenwriter Lem Dobbs. These guys get into quite the heated argument during the film that is quite entertaining to listen to! It's certainly something you don't hear every day.If you're a fan of Soderbergh's films but only know him from the high profile projects like Erin Brockovich or Ocean's Eleven, then check this little gem out.

Don't get me wrong it's not a horrible movie it just doesn't entertain me much. It's your basic thriller with a Father trying to get revenge for the death of his daughter. The reason I gave it 2 stars were for Terrence Stamp's acting, which is impeccable and entertaining as always, and for the good parts, which there aren't many of. It just kind of lingers too long in Terrence Stamp's head space sometimes and is just kind of hollow. I kind of felt invested in the movie when it started and up until Terrence Stamp killed a few guys, but after that the film goes on a steady decline with a few bumps of action and entertainment here and there.

But, if you are  careful enough, you can find in THE LIMEY some food for your movie lover's  mind.

If I can dare a  literary comparison, Soderbergh is the William Faulkner of today american  cinema.Now comes the problem. To master the cinematographic grammar, to  play with flashbacks, unconventional story tellings does that make you an  important author-director ?

Because the danger of a pure style-for-style  effort is very close.Anyway, I liked THE LIMEY which could be compared  to a classic sonata. Two instruments, Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, two  musical recurrent themes haunting the desperate search, in time and space,  of Terence Stamp. One could read THE LIMEY as a huge metaphor of the  english-american musical battle for supremacy that began with the arrival  of the Beatles on U.S. ground.So the intellectual pleasure is here but  you will scarcely find in THE LIMEY something that will move your heart.

475180,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6305741921,Doug Anderson,"[2, 3]","Terence Stamp is a very appealing actor with a presence unlike any other. The first time I ever saw him was in a 1969 Poe film directed by Fellini called ""Toby Dammit""(Spirits of the Dead). Since then I have seen him in various European films but one of his best performances was in an early eighties Stephen Frears movie The Hit where he played a gangster hiding in Spain and John Hurt was the assassin sent to find him (and a very young Tim Roth as assassins apprentice). Soderbergh's The Limey is reminiscent of that movie in that both make use of Stamps mysterious almost otherworldy nature. I like some things about The Limey like the opening number with Who playing The Seeker while Wilson(Stamps character)leaves the airport & I like Valentines(Fonda) mansion. Both these characters(and the actors that play them) are relics of the sixties and so there is a strong nostalgia thing going on. Soderbergh lays it on too thick though. The passages where we glimpse Wilson in flashback have been praised by some but I don't think the use of the old Stamp film Poor Cow adds any content to the film. It just looks like a home movie and apparently Soderbergh likes that, the look of it I fear is good enough for Soderbergh. Stamps character is looking back at a life wasted but its just so vague, those glimpses into his past are just people at parties smiling and laughing and being young. The flash forwards are kind of annoying and once again it seems style is Soderberghs motivation and his driving rationale. Stamp never becomes more than an image, a visual for the camera to play tricks with. The story is good or could have been good but the constant time shuffling and all the busy visuals prove just to distract from what we really want, some content. At the end I didn't feel like I really knew Wilson any better than I did in the beginning. Stamp remains a kind of ghost whose only interaction with the present tense is through moments of violence. Fondas character is also just a visual, never really flushed out. His characters roots are in the music business of the sixties and he attaches himself to young girls supposedly to remain eternally young. But he's also supposed to be running a major smuggling ring. His character just doesn't seem to have it in him. I think Soderbergh spent far too much time establishing a visual dossier for his characters and far too little on their actual substance.

This movie has a lot of great language, character development, depth and nuance. I like how they invoke the 60's (a time of peace, love and harmony) and that the villain is a record producer from that era who's lost sight of those values and turns rotten to the core. Unfortunately, the writers allowed the emotional and tragic elements of the story (Wilson's daughter) to overpower the movie and all the cool stuff takes a back seat. Also, the editing is practically a mess. I wanted to see more of the funny, dangerous, quirky supporting characters (especially Stacy the hitman), learn more about them and see more of their world.

475183,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,6305741921,Earl Hazell,"[4, 4]","I hate the idea, arrogantly enough, of people liking a great piece of art for all of the wrong reasons. Some I have heard have gone so far left field with metaphors about the title character of this film that they have even found a way to take the inexorable rage and focus of Terence Stamp's character in this movie completely out of the actual context of the film to make him a poster boy for the Conservative Right--an often ironically apt analogy, again, for all the wrong reasons.What makes this film so great is the integrity of Soderberg to his central character and his unique and artistic relationship to the plot. He makes his style subserivent to the story in such a way as to create the artistic paradox that says he has done the exact opposite; the marriage of the two is perfect. Terence Stamp (who is brilliant in this by the way) is a ""Limey"" on a juggernaut's course of revenge for the man he holds responsible for the death of his only child, a grown daughter, in Los Angeles. Peter Fonda (who is not quite as good as Stamp but does get out of his character's way at moments that are beautifully real) plays one of the many archetypal Baby-Boomer roles in existence today: an insecure, narcississtic and weak playboy/Recording Executive with a drug problem and predilection for impressionable young girls. One of these girls in his past may have been the Limey's inexplicably dead daughter. These two men are separated by an entire world--an Atlantic Ocean in one sense, and seemingly antithetical cultures on another--with many people of all walks of life (and levels of both beauty and depravity) in between. It is the painful, mysterious death of a young woman in the vicinity of one of these men that links the two of them, and is the genesis of one man's mission against the other.But that plot is merely the icing on the cake of this movie. It is nowhere near as powerful or as important as the theme, which could only be fully experienced by an observer (us, the audience) via the heart of the main character (the ""Limey"" himself). This is where Soderberg's style transcends the boundaries of simple ability and approaches genius. Through the majestic techniique of breaking the time line with numerous off kilter frames of both foreshadowing and reminiscence (and you can't tell which is which or what is even real until the end ties them all up) the theme becomes prfoundly real and, with each frame, more obvious. The Limey is on the same mission he has been on virtually all of his life. He is not running toward something; he is running from himself, using the easily understandable motives behind the new thing he is coincidentally running toward as the newest and boldest version of an excuse.Musings and abstractions on the wordly significance of the Limey's character in the context of his personal mission are pointless and become fairly infantile without taking this, the theme, into consideration. The ""Limey"" is not chasing after the devil to stare him in the eye and kill him; his soul has for the most part already been sold. He is chasing a false hope that the contract for his soul, already signed in his own blood on the dotted line, either does not really exist in his personal hell or can be bought back with the weak appearance of a vengeful but essentially good deed. And like every person, the irony of running away from oneself--regardless of the inner demons you're trying to escape--is that you eventually run even faster into that one and only aspect of yourself headlong.Hell: there is no way out...but through.The Limey has more in common with Mickey Roarke's character in ANGEL HEART than with any hero.Terence Stamp's performance is brilliant because he makes you, like all great actors, like his character as much as he does, regardless of its above-listed failings or bad deeds. But again, that's because Stamp does such a good job at this role, not because his character, though forgiveable, is all that likeable as a person. Al Pacino did an equally great job in both THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE and SCARFACE a few years ago, but I don't see myself emulating his characters by becoming a devil-worshipping drug dealer and moving to Havana because of it. Only a child could look at THE LIMEY and call both the main character's inner pain-inspired character failings and the gradual unfolding of their obvious destructive consequences something other than what they are--and only a deeply fearful and probably formally abused child raised on too many action movies at that.This movie is no masterpiece, but it is full of depth, with layers that bloom to reveal themselves with each passing frame.

His quest has genre underpinnings, but this movie rises above any genre label.  A lot of credit has to go to Lem Dobbs script which sidesteps cliche and injects some worthwhile comedy into the mix.

He finishes his prison sentence only to learn the news that his daughter has died ... under less than acceptable circumstances.Stamp plays Wilson with palpable memories of a haunted past.  It's as if pain of seeking revenge has become the only driving force in the man's life, and you can see every ounce of emotion behind every wince in his eyes.  Lesley Ann Warren winningly serves as back-up to Stamp's lead -- one of Jenny's only true friends in the facade that is crime-laden southern California.  And Luis Guzman -- long-serving supporting roles in standard television fare -- emerges brilliantly to the forefront as Jenny's former acting classmate; he accompanies Wilson on this violent journey of discovery, and he provides a sense of morality to the ex-con in a few key sequences in the film.LIMEY's editing may not be to everyone's liking.  Dialogue is time-lapsed and out-of-sequence throughout significant portions of the film, and, similar to the manner of PULP FICTION, events don't always unfold in typical chronological fashion.  However, time is all Wilson has left in his life, and what unfolds before his eyes turns out to be almost as frightening to him as the loss of his only child.As well, the film boasts what is probably one of the truest portraits of undercover federal drug-enforcement policy on film.On all counts, THE LIMEY emerges as a triumphant picture about the deep dark places to which only one man bent on knowing the truth will go.",4,A Haunted Man,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,1602,"['Terence', 'Stamp', 'Wilson', ""'limey"", 'ex-convict', 'drawn', 'United', 'States', 'search', 'truth', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'death', 'prison', 'sentence', 'only', 'learn', 'news', 'daughter', 'died', 'less', 'acceptable', 'circumstances.Stamp', 'plays', 'Wilson', 'palpable', 'memories', 'haunted', 'past', 'pain', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'become', 'only', 'driving', 'force', 'man', 'life', 'can', 'see', 'ounce', 'emotion', 'wince', 'eyes', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'winningly', 'back-up', 'Stamp', 'lead', 'one', 'Jenny', 'only', 'true', 'friends', 'facade', 'crime-laden', 'southern', 'California', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'long-serving', 'supporting', 'roles', 'standard', 'television', 'fare', 'brilliantly', 'forefront', 'Jenny', 'former', 'acting', 'classmate', 'Wilson', 'violent', 'journey', 'discovery', 'sense', 'morality', 'ex-con', 'few', 'key', 'sequences', 'film.LIMEY', 'editing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'liking', 'Dialogue', 'time-lapsed', 'out-of-sequence', 'significant', 'portions', 'film', 'similar', 'manner', 'PULP', 'FICTION', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'unfold', 'typical', 'chronological', 'fashion', 'However', 'time', 'Wilson', 'left', 'life', 'what', 'eyes', 'out', 'be', 'almost', 'frightening', 'loss', 'only', 'child.As', 'well', 'film', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'truest', 'portraits', 'undercover', 'federal', 'drug-enforcement', 'policy', 'film.On', 'counts', 'THE', 'LIMEY', 'triumphant', 'picture', 'deep', 'dark', 'places', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'bent', 'knowing', 'truth', 'will', 'go']",The Limey
475187,ATA9L747CJ622,6305741921,Emily McB,"[1, 2]","First of all, I'll say that I found the climax of the film a bit of a let-down.  Oh, it was clever, but not in a particularly believable way, it was all a bit convenient the way people kept turning up.  But never mind; the build-up was so flawless, Soderberg's direction so stylish, and the central performances so convincing, that it's really barely worth grumbling.  The editing was mainly to thank for the effective increase in tension.  Scenes from all over the time line of the story were spliced together with no explanation as to where they fit in.  This could be potentially irritating and confusing, but Soderberg proves, as he did again with Traffic, that he is fully capable of keeping track of different aspects of the same story through colour and light.  So the story flashes backwards several years and forwards several days without disrupting the narrative flow.Peter Fonda and Luiz Guzman are both very good, but the film belongs completely to Terrence Stamp.  He keeps the audience hanging off of his every ground out word, and his face, even, or rather especially in repose has endless emotion lingering in it.  Best of all, the flashbacks are actually scenes from a film much earlier in Stamp's career, so while the young man does not particularly resemble the older one, the patterns of speech and the movements of the face are the same.  This, like The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, is a classic Terrence Stamp performance, and the film is a credit to both him and Soderberg.",4,Disappointing Conclusion to Fabulous Movie.,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,1513,"['First', ""'ll"", 'say', 'found', 'climax', 'film', 'bit', 'let-down', 'Oh', 'was', 'clever', 'not', 'particularly', 'believable', 'way', 'was', 'bit', 'convenient', 'way', 'people', 'kept', 'turning', 'up', 'never', 'mind', 'build-up', 'was', 'so', 'flawless', 'Soderberg', 'direction', 'so', 'stylish', 'central', 'performances', 'so', 'convincing', 'really', 'barely', 'worth', 'grumbling', 'editing', 'was', 'mainly', 'thank', 'effective', 'increase', 'tension', 'Scenes', 'time', 'line', 'story', 'were', 'spliced', 'together', 'explanation', 'where', 'fit', 'could', 'be', 'potentially', 'irritating', 'confusing', 'Soderberg', 'did', 'again', 'Traffic', 'fully', 'capable', 'keeping', 'track', 'different', 'aspects', 'same', 'story', 'colour', 'light', 'story', 'flashes', 'several', 'years', 'forwards', 'several', 'days', 'disrupting', 'narrative', 'flow.Peter', 'Fonda', 'Luiz', 'Guzman', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'completely', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'audience', 'hanging', 'ground', 'word', 'face', 'even', 'rather', 'especially', 'repose', 'endless', 'emotion', 'lingering', 'Best', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'actually', 'scenes', 'film', 'much', 'earlier', 'Stamp', 'career', 'so', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'particularly', 'resemble', 'older', 'one', 'patterns', 'speech', 'movements', 'face', 'are', 'same', 'Adventures', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Desert', 'classic', 'Terrence', 'Stamp', 'performance', 'film', 'credit', 'Soderberg']",The Limey

They spend the movie in a game of  &quot;hunter-and-hunted,&quot; unwilling to see that they each perpetuate  the other's violence with every move they make.While Stamp and Fonda  are brilliant, the true ingenuity behind this film is in the directing and  editing. Steven Soderbergh relies heavily on pastiche and montage as a  means of creating a cohesive world for his characters. Using scenes from  the 1960's film &quot;Poor Cow&quot; to develop a history for Wilson  (Stamp) is highly successful in producing a believable character with an  intelligible past. It is this type of depth and attention to detail that  helps Soderbergh to keep his actors from becoming mere caricatures of  themselves. The fractured editing by Sarah Flack is beautiful and  well-done, serving to deepen an exceedingly simple story. Certain scenes  and moments have a tendency to reappear and reverbrate off of each other.The only thing that could have improved this film - and elevated it to 5  stars - would have been a bit more attention to an interesting storyline.  With a touch of complexity, this movie could have been a true classic,  rather than just a character study. It was refreshing, however, to watch  this intelligent movie take stock of criminality and the psyches of those  that succumb to and perpetuate its lifestyle.",4,Character builder,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,1630,"['pleasant', 'film', 'garners', 'attention', 'right', 'reasons', 'quot', 'Limey', 'quot', 'stylish', 'movie', 'story-telling', 'more', 'plot', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'play', 'wonderfully', 'flawed', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'would', 'like', 'admit', 'spend', 'movie', 'game', 'quot', 'hunter-and-hunted', 'quot', 'unwilling', 'see', 'perpetuate', 'other', 'violence', 'move', 'make.While', 'Stamp', 'Fonda', 'are', 'brilliant', 'true', 'ingenuity', 'film', 'directing', 'editing', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'heavily', 'pastiche', 'montage', 'means', 'creating', 'cohesive', 'world', 'characters', 'Using', 'scenes', '1960', 'film', 'quot', 'Poor', 'Cow', 'quot', 'develop', 'history', 'Wilson', 'Stamp', 'highly', 'successful', 'producing', 'believable', 'character', 'intelligible', 'past', 'type', 'depth', 'attention', 'detail', 'Soderbergh', 'keep', 'actors', 'becoming', 'mere', 'caricatures', 'fractured', 'editing', 'Sarah', 'Flack', 'beautiful', 'well-done', 'serving', 'deepen', 'exceedingly', 'simple', 'story', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'moments', 'have', 'tendency', 'reappear', 'reverbrate', 'off', 'other.The', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'film', 'elevated', '5', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'attention', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'touch', 'complexity', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'classic', 'rather', 'just', 'character', 'study', 'was', 'refreshing', 'however', 'watch', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'take', 'stock', 'criminality', 'psyches', 'succumb', 'perpetuate', 'lifestyle']",The Limey

475192,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305741921,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","This is a good solid drama with some strong performances.  Wilson (Terence Stamp) is an ex-con who just got out of prison and is looking for answers regarding the death of his estranged daughter in a car crash.  He suspects  foul play and he is certain that her ex-boyfriend, music magnate Terry  Valentine (Peter Fonda) is behind it.  So he undertakes to seek the truth  with vengeance in his heart, leaving a good deal of carnage in his wake  along the way.The story itself is an interesting human drama including a  number of character studies.  The drama worked, but the character studies  of Wilson, and his daughter Jenny were unsatisfying even though a  significant amount of time was devoted to them.  The most important  character study, that of Wilson himself, leaves us with more questions than  answers.Unfortunately, this film is an example of style overwhelming  substance.  Director Steven Soderbergh has created an icon of visual style  that is so prominent that it overshadowed and pushed the story into the  background.  In reality, based upon the amount of dialogue and the number  of meaningful scenes, this story probably could have been told in 45  minutes.  But through the magic of multiple perspectives and redundancies  on every scene, Soderbergh managed to double that.Soderbergh's visual  interpretation was nothing short of brilliant.  It was creative genius at  work to be sure.  Veteran cinematographer Edward Lachman must be commended  as well. The use of angles, lighting, filters, music, and breathtaking  locations near the ocean were all superlative; but those endless cutaways  eventually made me want to throw myself from Valentine's swimming pool  overlook.  Incessantly, sometimes every two or three seconds, he would  layer cutaway upon cutaway in a dizzying array of perspectives on the same  scene.  It is a terrific technique when used to dramatize a point, and  Soderbergh is masterfully creative in its use.  But to assemble a feature  length motion picture from a patchwork of cutaways flitting back and forth  through time with constant disruptions in continuity was like eating  nothing but your favorite flavor of ice cream as your every meal for a  month.  There comes a point where too much of a wonderful thing becomes  distasteful.  It made it seem like Soderbergh was in desperate need of a  little Ritalin during post production.  (Which is why this film will  probably be the delight of the Attention Deficit Generation.)Terence  Stamp gave a strong performance as the tough and enigmatic Wilson.  Stamp  is an old pro and gives the character power and determination.  Peter  Fonda's renaissance continues with another fine portrayal.  Oddly, this may  be the first time I remember him smiling so much.  He has played so many  dour characters, it almost looked strange to see him grin.  Lesley Ann  Warren added very little in her role as Elaine, a friend and instructor of  Wilson's daughter.I was very impressed with the work of Nicky Katt, who  played Stacey.  He was a very cavalier, yet charismatic villain with a  wryly philosophical bent that made him both sinister and funny.  I'm  looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future.This was an  smartly told story that sputtered a bit at the end, but in balance was  first rate.  It was fabulously filmed from a technical standpoint, but it  became a bit too self indulgent.  It forgot that the purpose of outstanding  filmmaking technique is to enhance the story, not simply to show off.  I  rated it a 8/10.  It is worth seeing just for its merit as an illustration  of the art form.  If you can survive all the cutaways without sustaining  cortical whiplash, you will probably enjoy the excellent story that lies  within.",4,Excellent but overstylized film,956534400,"04 24, 2000",2000,3746,"['good', 'solid', 'drama', 'strong', 'performances', 'Wilson', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'ex-con', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'prison', 'looking', 'answers', 'regarding', 'death', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'car', 'crash', 'foul', 'play', 'certain', 'ex-boyfriend', 'music', 'magnate', 'Terry', 'Valentine', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'seek', 'truth', 'vengeance', 'heart', 'leaving', 'good', 'deal', 'carnage', 'wake', 'way.The', 'story', 'interesting', 'human', 'drama', 'including', 'number', 'character', 'studies', 'drama', 'worked', 'character', 'studies', 'Wilson', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'were', 'unsatisfying', 'even', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'study', 'Wilson', 'more', 'questions', 'answers.Unfortunately', 'film', 'example', 'style', 'overwhelming', 'substance', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'created', 'icon', 'visual', 'style', 'so', 'prominent', 'overshadowed', 'pushed', 'story', 'background', 'reality', 'based', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'number', 'meaningful', 'scenes', 'story', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', '45', 'minutes', 'magic', 'multiple', 'perspectives', 'redundancies', 'scene', 'Soderbergh', 'managed', 'double', 'that.Soderbergh', 'visual', 'interpretation', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'was', 'creative', 'genius', 'work', 'be', 'sure', 'Veteran', 'cinematographer', 'Edward', 'Lachman', 'must', 'be', 'commended', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'angles', 'lighting', 'filters', 'music', 'breathtaking', 'locations', 'ocean', 'were', 'superlative', 'endless', 'cutaways', 'eventually', 'made', 'want', 'throw', 'Valentine', 'swimming', 'pool', 'overlook', 'Incessantly', 'sometimes', 'two', 'three', 'seconds', 'would', 'layer', 'cutaway', 'upon', 'cutaway', 'dizzying', 'array', 'perspectives', 'same', 'scene', 'terrific', 'technique', 'when', 'used', 'dramatize', 'point', 'Soderbergh', 'masterfully', 'creative', 'use', 'assemble', 'feature', 'length', 'motion', 'picture', 'patchwork', 'cutaways', 'flitting', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'constant', 'disruptions', 'continuity', 'was', 'eating', 'nothing', 'favorite', 'flavor', 'ice', 'cream', 'meal', 'month', 'point', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'distasteful', 'made', 'seem', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'desperate', 'need', 'little', 'Ritalin', 'post', 'production', 'Which', 'why', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'delight', 'Attention', 'Deficit', 'Generation', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'gave', 'strong', 'performance', 'tough', 'enigmatic', 'Wilson', 'Stamp', 'old', 'pro', 'character', 'power', 'determination', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'renaissance', 'fine', 'portrayal', 'Oddly', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'time', 'remember', 'smiling', 'so', 'much', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'dour', 'characters', 'almost', 'looked', 'strange', 'see', 'grin', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'added', 'very', 'little', 'role', 'Elaine', 'friend', 'instructor', 'Wilson', 'daughter.I', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'work', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'who', 'played', 'Stacey', 'was', 'very', 'cavalier', 'yet', 'charismatic', 'villain', 'wryly', 'philosophical', 'bent', 'made', 'sinister', 'funny', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'work', 'future.This', 'was', 'smartly', 'told', 'story', 'sputtered', 'bit', 'end', 'balance', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'fabulously', 'filmed', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'became', 'bit', 'too', 'self', 'indulgent', 'forgot', 'purpose', 'outstanding', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'enhance', 'story', 'not', 'simply', 'show', 'off', 'rated', '8/10', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'merit', 'illustration', 'art', 'form', 'can', 'survive', 'cutaways', 'sustaining', 'cortical', 'whiplash', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'excellent', 'story']",The Limey

At other times, I found the concentrated attention required to follow so many sound overlays and picture splices to be almost meditative!  Were the story a little more interesting, perhaps I'd have thought more of the technique.OK, it was something new and deserving of recognition, but flashy editing can't be the entire reason for greatness in a film.  In terms of plot, this wasn't a terribly exciting movie.  Something in the anti-hero's quest for revenge (which was in fact the whole story) left me less than satisfied.  Peter Fonda's character was often more likeable and sympathetic than Terence Stamp's.  After Stamp has offed a countless number of other guys in his pursuit, he finally gets to ask Fonda the real circumstances surrounding his daughter's death and there is some irony in the answer he receives.. this is the story in a nutshell.  While Stamp's character was half-interesting, it was difficult to care a great deal about his revenge, not having seen the injustice perpetuated on his daughter.  Furthermore, Fonda being a more or less amiable guy made it hard to really sympathize with the whole revenge mission.There were some interesting minor characters in the movie which helped move things along.  Fonda's bodyguard added a few more volts, as did the pool-playing street assassin and his semi-retarded partner.Had the story created more interest (in Stamp's revenge?), I'd probably have better appreciated this experiment in editing, which was original, though seeming to delay the story at times, rather than enhancing it.

Many reviewers saw his acting as ""wooden""--I, absolutely, don't agree--quite the contrary, I found him TOTALLY CONVINCING. WILSON (TERENCE STAMP), just out of prison for, at least, the third time after nine years, flies to Los Angeles (from the U.K.)) to learn the circumstances of his daughters death and AVENGE it (as well as come to terms with the guilt of his absence from her life). The movie is not filmed lineally (it is done with MANY flash backs and forwards). I, very much, like the way it was filmed. It's directed by STEVEN SODERBURGH (Traffic).The cast is very good--especially LUIS GUZMAN. Also starring Peter Fonda, Barry Neuman and Leslie Ann Warren. I loved watching this movie and would RECOMMEND it, but SELECTIVELY. It is NOT FOR THE DIE HARD FANS. It is NOT AN ACTION MOVIE, DESPITE THE VIOLENCE.",5,CONTEMPLATIVE AND BRUTAL.

My comment is that the ending is enigmatic, which adds to the movie's appeal.  The characters are deftly, but sparsely written and portrayed.The color combinations, the lighting, and the extensive use of close-ups speak to the quality of the photography.  The care that went into the shooting of many scenes in this movie is better than many art house movies.  This movie is eye-candy much as the neo-noir Wild Things is.Finally, the direction is excellent.  The quality of the jump-cut editing, the inclusion of fantasy scenes to head fake the watcher, and the excellence with both broad panoramas (the trip up to Big Sur is fantastic) and close-ups (e.g., Wilson on the jet from London to LA) are done again render this near art house quality.To be clear, this is a thriller/action movie.

It's a revenge drama (an ex-con heads out to Los Angeles to avenge the murder of his daughter) told in flashbacks and flashforwards.  I've read dozens of reviews on Amazon and on the Amazon-owned movie database website, and I was surprised to notice how often the analogy of a deck of cards was employed in descriptions of the movie.  Fans celebrate the film for its agile flipping through a deck of cards, for the fluidity of time in the storyline.I'm a dissenting voice, and no, I didn't not like the movie because I'm not ""film-savvy.""  It is a beautiful Los Angeles piece which portrays the seedy underside and self-centered social climbing of the city of glitter.  Henry Fonda, Terence Stamp, Luis Guzman, and the supporting cast are all excellent.  The plot is simple and weak, and the jumbling of time does not make up for what the plot is lacking,  The dialog is flat.

475207,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6305741921,J from NY,"[1, 1]","Steven Soderbergh's ""The Limey"" is an understatement of an understatement punctuated by almost unbearable raptures of emotion--it's as though Soderbergh wanted to make the standard Hollyword fare of ""Vengeance is Mine"" into an inside joke and make it serious again within 90 minutes.Terence Stamp gives one of the best performances I have ever seen (by turns hilarious and horrifying) as the Wilson, a British ex-con who discovers that his daughter has been killed in an ""accidental death"" orchestrated by a washed up sleazebag music producer played masterfullyby Peter Fonda.  Luis Guzman, an ex-con who knows Wilson and who got his life straightened out, has a begrudging respect for the aging oddball thug and helps him on his mission.  For once Guzman is not angry, violent criminal; he is a reformed one.Soderbergh has the ability to take the most brutal scenes and transform them into utter comedy--when Wilson attends a party thrown by Valentine (Fonda) stands out on the producers' luxurious terrace overlooking theo cean, having repeated fantasies of simply walking in and shooting him (which he is perfectly capable of doing).  Valentine tells his 400 pound bodyguard to go have a chat with Wilson. In a very quick motion seen from Fonda's perspective, Wilson headbutts the bodyguard and throws him off the terrace.  He then grins goofily into the party at Fonda.The story of Wilson's daughter Jenni is not one bit funny though.  A young girl who had to watch her father go to prison (or get ""banged up"" numerous times as he puts it) it is really no wonder that she would get involved with a sleazebag like Valentine--another criminal.  Wilson's memories of Jenni are heartbreaking but loving.  The film ""Memento"" took more than a fair share from this movie.Wilson is an unstoppable force.  Nothing Valentine does can prevent his wrath.  There is a twist at the end though that has stuck in my mind ever since, a riddle Soderbergh poses.

475210,A332MW6OA1LYDF,6305741921,John Noodles,"[5, 5]","Probably not, but I love it and am giving it 5 stars anyway.This movie sets out to be a very simple narrative, a quest/revenge story, in which Wilson, an aged cockney criminal fresh from a 9-year stint ""at Her Majesty's leisure,"" sets out to learn the truth about his estranged daughter's death in Los Angeles.  Along the way, though, it becomes a thoughtful story about self-discovery, of lives lived in one direction and understood (tragically too late) in another...as all lives are.This flick is full of great performances.  Stamp is great as the cool, deliberate, and ruthless Wilson, a man who is not gratuitously violent, but not at all hesitant to use it when it suits his needs or satisfies his desire.  He is a fearless--and probably foolish--criminal who has spent half his life behind bars and has become thoughtful, introspective.Barry Newman, another hippie-era cult star (Vanishing Point, 1971), fills his supporting role as Valentine's (Peter Fonda) head of security with a snarling grittiness that contrasts with Fonda's whiney, pampered aging record producer character hilariously.  Nicky Katt his equally hilarious as an idiot hitman who takes himself very seriously (""Hey, this is a lifestyle I embrace!"").I don't think this movie's non-linear editing is at all confusing.  While shots from one part of the narrative are frequently inserted into scenes in another part, they make perfect sense within their ""new"" contexts, even if they are temporally out of place, and this editing reflects perfectly the idea that this story is one that is reflected upon, not told as it actually happens, and the realization that past actions can't help but define the present.This movie is a treat, and worth seeing.

Barry ""ksbarry""","[1, 1]","The opening line, voiced over a black screen, &quot;Tell me about Jenny!&quot; sets the tone for this tightly constructed psychological drama/thriller about a father's quest to find out what really happened on the night his daughter died, alegedly in a car accident, in Los Angeles.Terrence Stamp's performance as Wilson, the recently released career criminal, is a fascinating character.  While he is determined to commit further crimes to find out what really happened to his daughter to whom he was, &quot;like a ghost in her life,&quot;  over the course of the film we learn the nature of Wilson's past crimes and come to respect that he is operating out of love for a child he barely knew and not out of sheer malice.  The mystery is set in motion when Wilson recieves a letter from a casual friend of his daughter's, Ed, who sends a clipping on her death because he, &quot;just thought soemone should know.&quot;  Ed, an ex-con himself, isn't convinced that Jenny's death wasn't an accident but felt the father should be notified.  Throughout, there are character studies of noble men and women who by act of circumstance are believed by society to be evil.  Ed leads Wilson to a record producer named Valentine with whom Jenny was involved, romantically we think but it's never quite directly stated, at the time of her death.The psychology of this film is fascinating.  What is good or evil, when does an act become criminal? (There's an awesome exchange of information between Wilson and the DEA who are already watching Valentine.) It's possible that Jenny was looking for a father she didn't have when she fell in with Valentine's crowd.  She may also have been looking for a noble man with an bad streak when she became romantically involved with Valentine.  Ultimately, we're left with a fundamental question of who is really responsible for Jenny's death.  Wilson may come to regret his quest because he didn't find an answer with which he's comfortable.Non-linear movies are nothing new and in less skilled hands than Soderbergh they often become confusing.

475217,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6305741921,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I mostly don't like Steven Soderbegh films at all, but this quite original 1999 crime film is one of the exceptions. Below, you will find more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Old school British gangster Wilson (Terence Stamp) who spent more than half of his life in prison, travels to Los Angeles to investigate the death of his daughter Jenny, who supposedly died in a car accident. He suspects that Jenny's last boyfriend (or rather sugar daddy, as he was easily 30 years older than her) record producer Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda) had her killed. This film tells the story of his investigation and its consequences.This film immediately reminded me of old 1971 classic ""Get Carter"" with Michael Caine - and in fact Steven Soderbegh wanted initially Caine to play the main role. Finally he had to settle for Terence Stamp and I think that actually did to this film a great deal of good, as Stamp offers here a STELLAR performance! The atmosphere of the film is however very ""getcarterish"", even if Los Angeles in Year of Grace 1999, even in its least glamorous parts looks definitely less gritty and more cheerful than Newcastle 1971 AD.The character of Wilson (we never learn his first name) is different than that of Jack Carter. Here the gangster is older and speaks differently, frequently using a very colourful slang and his sense of humor is also quite different. Both men however are cold, ruthless career criminals, seemingly calm on the surface but boiling with rage inside, launched on a personal crusade against those who did them wrong and anybody who stands between them and their vengeance.As I already said, the few films by Steven Soderbegh I ever saw, I usually didn't like them a lot. I hated ""Solaris"", ""Traffic"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" bored me almost to death and even if I found ""Erin Brokovitch"" and ""Contagion"" watchable I do not intend to see them ever again. And let's not even talk about his hagiography of Saint Che Guevara, co-creator of the vicious Cuban tyranny and brutal murderer of thousands... This film however I found better than others and I especially liked the quite unique technique of narration, in which the story is told simultaneously in a way linear and not linear, when in teh same time keeping things clear and logical - this is quite an achievement!The one thing that prevents me from giving it five stars is the very ending, like the last minute of the film. I couldn't understand this thing very well - either the director decided to hide the whole solution of the film and depriveus of a real ending, or Wilson simply did all of this (including the killings) strictly for nothing... Maybe you will have better luck figuring this out.So bottom line, this is a good, solid, artistically very interesting gangster film, with just one big black spot in its final minute. The latter thing notwithstanding, I will keep my DVD for a possible re-watch.",4,"""I'm looking for a different kind of satisfaction...""",1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2912,"['mostly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Steven', 'Soderbegh', 'films', 'quite', 'original', '1999', 'crime', 'film', 'one', 'exceptions', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'impressions', 'limited', 'SPOILERS.Old', 'school', 'British', 'gangster', 'Wilson', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'who', 'spent', 'more', 'half', 'life', 'prison', 'travels', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'investigate', 'death', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'who', 'supposedly', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'Jenny', 'last', 'boyfriend', 'rather', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'was', 'easily', '30', 'years', 'older', 'record', 'producer', 'Terry', 'Valentine', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'had', 'killed', 'film', 'story', 'investigation', 'consequences.This', 'film', 'immediately', 'reminded', 'old', '1971', 'classic', 'Get', 'Carter', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'fact', 'Steven', 'Soderbegh', 'wanted', 'initially', 'Caine', 'play', 'main', 'role', 'Finally', 'had', 'settle', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'think', 'actually', 'did', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'good', 'Stamp', 'here', 'STELLAR', 'performance', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'getcarterish', 'even', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Year', 'Grace', '1999', 'even', 'least', 'glamorous', 'parts', 'definitely', 'less', 'gritty', 'more', 'cheerful', 'Newcastle', '1971', 'AD.The', 'character', 'Wilson', 'never', 'learn', 'first', 'name', 'different', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'Here', 'gangster', 'older', 'speaks', 'differently', 'frequently', 'using', 'very', 'colourful', 'slang', 'sense', 'humor', 'also', 'quite', 'different', 'men', 'however', 'are', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'career', 'criminals', 'seemingly', 'calm', 'surface', 'boiling', 'rage', 'inside', 'launched', 'personal', 'crusade', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'anybody', 'who', 'vengeance.As', 'already', 'said', 'few', 'films', 'Steven', 'Soderbegh', 'ever', 'saw', 'usually', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'hated', 'Solaris', 'Traffic', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'bored', 'almost', 'death', 'even', 'found', 'Erin', 'Brokovitch', 'Contagion', 'watchable', 'do', 'not', 'intend', 'see', 'ever', 'again', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'talk', 'hagiography', 'Saint', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'co-creator', 'vicious', 'Cuban', 'tyranny', 'brutal', 'murderer', 'thousands', 'film', 'however', 'found', 'better', 'others', 'especially', 'liked', 'quite', 'unique', 'technique', 'narration', 'story', 'told', 'simultaneously', 'way', 'linear', 'not', 'linear', 'when', 'teh', 'same', 'time', 'keeping', 'things', 'clear', 'logical', 'quite', 'achievement', 'one', 'thing', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'very', 'ending', 'last', 'minute', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'thing', 'very', 'well', 'director', 'decided', 'hide', 'whole', 'solution', 'film', 'depriveus', 'real', 'ending', 'Wilson', 'simply', 'did', 'including', 'killings', 'strictly', 'nothing', 'Maybe', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'figuring', 'out.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'good', 'solid', 'artistically', 'very', 'interesting', 'gangster', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'black', 'spot', 'final', 'minute', 'latter', 'thing', 'notwithstanding', 'will', 'keep', 'DVD', 'possible', 're-watch']",The Limey

475219,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305741921,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","The Limey, a dazzling little thriller, is the kind of movie that slips through the cracks during its theatrical run. These movies tend to be not quite mainstream enough for distributors to deal with through their slick, ""one size fits all"" publicity departments. Sometimes, these smaller films do well on video, and I hope The Limey turns out to be one of them.The Limey is in the style of the classic Hollywood thriller. It's fast-paced, full of odd characters, edited down to bare-bones essentials, and realistic only in that it fits in with a world created by and for the movies. Part of the enjoyment of this kind of film is that the viewer knows what they are seeing has little resemblance to his or her world. If this weren't so, then what we see would hit too close to home and would make us squirm.The lead character, Wilson, is played by veteran British actor Terence Stamp, who started out 1960s as a sex symbol who could act. Stamp seems to have had little interest in commercial roles. As time went on, he became a character actor, and it's great to see him once more with a big role. Wilson is a professional thief who has just been released from an English prison, where he spent a number of years. His incarceration caused him to miss seeing his daughter grow up. He is distraught when he learns the young woman has been killed in an automobile accident in Los Angeles. Perhaps out of guilt, he flies to California. Once there, he quickly learns that there are a lot of unanswered questions about the accident. He becomes suspicious and tries to learn more about Valentine, her mysterious boyfriend. The more the truth is hidden from him, the more he is willing to use any method, including violence, to find it.There are some drawbacks to the storyline, but they are ones typical of the genre. In particular, the body count is absurdly high. In real life, there would be police detectives and SWAT teams everywhere. The Drug Enforcement Agency is, as usual, portrayed as a group of guys whose morals are no better than the criminals they pursue. On the plus side, the characterizations are well defined, and the events that motivate the characters are clear and fairly logical.The movie poses some interesting questions.

475221,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,6305741921,M. Dog,"[3, 3]","This is one of the finest crime dramas of recent years. Harkening back to another great film, 1971's Get Carter, Terrance Stamp plays an ex-con, Wilson, who has comes to America to discover the causes of his daughter's death. I found this a great film for many reasons:Steven Soderbergh's direction was fascinating. He plays with time and images in a very interesting way, mixing up sharp close ups and long shots done out of time (some in flashback, some looking into the future). While this smacks hard of arty/indi filmmaking, I think with this film it really worked to tremendous advantage. There are several shots of Terrance Stamp in extreme close-up, focusing on his strange, pale blue eyes, while sun and shadow play across his face. I found these shots oddly moving, and after a second viewing I figured out why: in these shots the sunlight passes over his face like the rising and falling of the sun - like the passing of time. Soderbergh's direction is very tight throughout, and his shot selection is always excellent.I love the casting of this movie. Terrance Stamp could not have been better, cast as Wilson, the cockney career criminal that has come to the plastic world of California looking for some very hard answers. His Wilson is a once-in-a-career creation, much like Clint Eastwood's, William Munny from The Unforgiven. Stamp really makes Wilson jump right off the screen in every scene he is in. Several good to great actors find their finest moments on film here, always playing against type. For once Lesley Ann Warren is NOT a bubble-headed sex starved vixen, but instead a woman with depth and intelligence. For once Luiz Guzman is NOT a slightly comic, second banana bad-guy Hispanic but instead a decent, complex man that proves his metal during the course of the film.Peter Fonda plays a music mogul named Valentine with a heart of corruption beyond his melancholy reminisces of the 60's (who, in an offhand moment, explains the 60's perfectly in about 5 or 6 lines of dialogue). Barry Newman seems to come out of nowhere with a pitch perfect performance as a suave head of security for the Valentine empire.Finally, watch for the two-man hit team of Nicky Katt and Joe Dallesandro, who are hired to kill Stamp. Nicky Katt gives a real, real creepy performance, nearly worth the price of admission by itself, and it was just great to see Dallesandro mixing it up again (Dallesandro comes out of the Andy Warhol factory and was Warhol's beefcake boy in several of his movies).All in all, a film that will easily stand up to repeat viewings.This is one you should have in your collection.",5,My name's . . .

Which, in my opinion, was one of the most entertaining movies that I had ever had the pleasure upon viewing. The film is weird, funny, thrilling, bold, and brilliant. One of the reasons I loved this film so much was simply because of Terrence Stamps performance as Wilson. His performance was riveting, captivating, and just down-right mesmerizing. Lets face it, I dont think anybody in the film industry has a stare as eerie as his. In this film his stare alone can send you chills. Peter Fonda's performance as Terry Valentine is so well casted, you can almost smell his cowardness. Who could have selected a better director for the film than Steven Soderbergh? He is what made this film so professional. I love the way he pulls his magic tricks with the camera, on this movie. He also did a great job selecting wonderful music from the 60s as well.

475230,A3QVAKVRAH657N,6305741921,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[0, 4]","The first, and more obvious, reason to consider this a conservative film is that the basic plot structure is built around the notion that if you plop aprincipled man--the limey and ex-con, Wilson (Terrence Stamp)--down in the midst of unprincipled men--drug-dealing Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda)and his henchmen--it is the man of principle who is most dangerous because he will keep moving forward inexorably until his principles arevindicated.  Admittedly, the values that Wilson adheres to may not be right out of the classic Judeo-Christian playbook, but he does nonetheless havea strict and uncompromising set of rules that govern his life, among which are the necessity to wreak vengeance on the men who killed his daughter.Meanwhile, for Valentine and company, there are no behavioral standards, no morals to be followed; all is negotiable and nothing else matters butyour own survival.  It is a sad commentary on the state of American culture that the filmmakers felt it necessary to make Wilson so overtly alien (notjust British, which we fawningly associate with higher standards in all things, but lower-class British so that his accent and vocabulary make himeven more of a fish out of water).  When a DEA agent says to Wilson, ""You're not from around here, are you?"", he is presumably referring not just tohis national origin but also to how different he is from the laid-back Californians amongst whom he's now operating.  Wilson's savage morality issadly just as foreign to us as is his Cockney slang.The other aspect of the movie that makes it particularly conservative is the way in which Peter Fonda's character references the character he played inEasy Rider (1969).  Stamp is clearly supposed to be portraying an older version of the character he played in Poor Cow (1967), to the point wheredirector Soderbergh even uses film clips from that earlier role.  But not many of us will ever have seen that film.  Easy Rider, on the other hand, is atouchstone of 60s culture and a key to understanding the era.  Fonda and Dennis Hopper are counterculture antiheroes, riding around on theirmotorcycles in search of America.  Along the way they find drugs, hippies, mimes, Jack Nicholson, cops, etc.  And in the famous ending of the filmAmerica finally catches up to them, as a pickup full of rednecks shotguns Fonda and Hopper right off of their bikes.  In many ways the finale drew aline across the culture, and whether you rooted for the bikers or the truckers defined which side of the line you were on.

475231,A3AJ1X5GT0NBO0,6305741921,"Parker Lewis ""park-lewis""","[7, 7]","Terrence Stamp has had an interesting career, with smaller roles in big films like &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Bowfinger&quot;, and Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace&quot;; as well as larger roles in small  films, like &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;  and Steven Soderbergh's latest film, &quot;The Limey&quot;. Actually,  &quot;The Limey&quot; is somewhat of a spin-off from one of Stamp's earlier  films--&quot;Poor Cow&quot;, a British 1967 film directed by Kenneth Loach.  In &quot;The Limey&quot;, it takes the minor character which Stamp played  in &quot;Poor Cow&quot;--a thief with a wife and daughter who gets sent to  jail--and sets the story as he gets out.It opens with a black screen,  with a single voiceover of Stamp interrogating someone: &quot;Tell me about  Jenny. Tell me about Jenny!&quot; Jenny, as it turns out, is his daughter,  and has died in a rather suspicious manner. What follows would otherwise be  a bland story of a father's vengeance; however, thanks to Soderbergh's  precise and inventive direction, [and Stamp's acting,] it turns out to be a  taut and intriguing thriller. Peter Fonda is an excellent counterpart to  Stamp, as the slimy, over-the-hill record producer who is suspected of  being a part of narcotics ring and of killing Stamp's daughter.Soderbergh is known to fool around with the linear timeline a bit, as he  did in the critically acclaimed &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. (OK, nearly all  of Soderbergh's movies are critically acclaimed.) However, one interesting  effect that Soderbergh uses in &quot;The Limey&quot; is, at first, we  witness a conversation. In the middle of the conversation, while the  conversation continues, we watch a different point of the conversation, and  then a freeze frame of the listener's face. It's a very effective means of  emphasizing the emotion of the two involved in the conversation, while  keeping the story moving. This effect takes some time to get used to, but  once you adjust, you enjoy the ride. Soderbergh also uses fantasy scenes,  to emphasize Stamp's emotions, which allows the viewer to empathize with  Stamp's character. This is essential, because one needs to make a  fundamental connection with the protagonist in order to like a story of an  ex-con ready to brutalize someone.Soderbergh's direction and Stamp's  acting make a fine duo. &quot;The Limey&quot; picks up in Soderbergh's  masterful direction skills where &quot;Out of Sight&quot; left off.  Definitely worth a watch.

475232,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305741921,Reviewer,"[0, 2]","The story of a man seeking truth and vengeance, ""TheLimey"" stars Terence Stamp as Wilson, a career criminal who intendsto find out what really happened on the night his daughter was killed in Los Angeles.  While serving a nine year stretch in prison, in England, Wilson receives a newspaper clipping about an accident in which Jenny (Melissa George) died when her car went off a cliff on Mulholland.  When he is released, Wilson goes straight to L.A. to track down the man Jenny was with at the time, a record producer named Valentine (Peter Fonda).  He begins by contacting the man who sent him the clipping, a friend of Jenny's from an acting class, Ed Roe (Luis Guzman), an ex-con himself who steers Wilson to Valentine. Director Steven Soderbergh approaches the material artistically, using a definite pace (occasionally too slow) and interspersing brief flashbacks of Wilson and Jenny, which prove to be very effective. Stamp does well with his Wilson, having reached an age and maturity that gives him the perfect look and overall countenance with which to ably bring such a character to life.  Fonda's Valentine comes off as fairly one dimensional; he comes across believably enough, but without any of the personal traits or mannerisms that could have made this an interesting character.  The supporting cast includes Barry Newman (Avery), Joe Dallesandro (Uncle John), Nicky katt (Stacy) and Lesley Ann Warren (Elaine).  ""The Limey"" is an interesting character study, but hardly compelling.  Wilson is a hard guy, a man who's spent most of his life in prison; it's hard to muster up much sympathy for him.  Valentine made a reputation (and a lot of money) during a couple of years in the sixties, and hasn't done much since.  He's a man you neither like nor dislike, but could probably do without in your life.  His remorse about what happened to Jenny seems shallow; it's all about himself, rather than her.  The only truly sympathetic character here is Jenny; through the flashbacks you learn enough about her moral attributes that is gives you the insight to fully understand what really happened the night of the accident.  This film has some nice moments, with one especially interesting sequence that takes place at a party at Valentine's house, in which Wilson repeatedly envisions himself shooting Valentine.  There's a pensive quality about this film that works, and Soderbergh's off-center approach is interesting, he has a nice touch; essentially, he's delivered a good movie that could have been more.

475235,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305741921,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","Terence Stamp is not a superstar, but you would not be able to tell that from this film.  From the moment before the opening credits with a completely black screen we hear his character Wilson utter passionately, ""Tell me!  Tell me about Jenny!"" until the moment late in the film when he repeats those words, Stamp completely and utterly dominates this film.  The fact is, however, that Stamp could easily, with only a few changes in his early career, have been as big a superstar as anyone to come out of England in the past forty years.  His early selectivity in roles in the sixties, when he was one of the icons of the decade, was legendary, as was his having taken off nearly a decade to go to India to study spirituality.  As the opening credits come up, The Who's ""The Seeker"" plays, and the song could be applied as much to Stamp as to the role Stamp is playing.  (Stamp's brother, by the way, Chris Stamp, was the executive producer of many of The Who's best albums in the 1960s and early 1970s.)The plot of the film is extremely simple:  a British con is released from prison, and travels immediately to Los Angeles to investigates his daughter's Jenny's death.  In most regards, this is a fairly average film, but two things make is a minor masterpiece.  First, this is one of the most brilliantly edited films one can ever hope to see.  It is a travesty that Sarah Flack not only didn't win an Oscar for best editing but didn't even receive a nomination.  This is one of those films where the editing tells a disproportionate amount of the story.  Not only that, but a five second straight on shot might feature two or three splices, giving the film a nervy, disorienting feel at times, to wonderful effect.The second reason the film is elevated to something special is Stamp's portrayal of Wilson.  Stamp's voice has gotten progressively rawer over the years, and he really doesn't sound like anyone else in movies today, especially when he reverts to a Cockney accent, as he does in this one.  He radiates danger, more like the Angel of Death than a person.  I have read that Soderbergh contacted Stamp before seriously beginning work on the project, not wanting to go forward with the film until Stamp's involvement was guaranteed.  In other words, this film was built around Stamp, and it shows.  He owns this film like few actors can own a movie.  That Stamp did not receive an Oscar nomination is another absurdity.One of the more interesting features in the film is the way that Wilson's memories of his daughter and his sense of failure as a father to her drives and motivates his behavior, sometimes in surprising and unexpected ways.  One thing that helps make this more effect is the frequently noted use of footage from a film that Stamp made in the 1960s, POOR COW.  Interestingly, POOR COW is the only other film that Stamp, an East Ender from London, has played a Cockney.  Terence Stamp is not a superstar, but this film is dramatic proof that he coulda, shoulda been, if he had wanted to be one.",5,"Stunning, Superstar-Quality Performance by Terence Stamp",1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,3024,"['Terence', 'Stamp', 'not', 'superstar', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'film', 'moment', 'opening', 'credits', 'completely', 'black', 'screen', 'hear', 'character', 'Wilson', 'utter', 'passionately', 'Tell', 'Tell', 'Jenny', 'moment', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'words', 'Stamp', 'completely', 'utterly', 'film', 'fact', 'however', 'Stamp', 'could', 'easily', 'only', 'few', 'changes', 'early', 'career', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'superstar', 'anyone', 'come', 'England', 'past', 'forty', 'years', 'early', 'selectivity', 'roles', 'sixties', 'when', 'was', 'one', 'icons', 'decade', 'was', 'legendary', 'was', 'having', 'taken', 'off', 'nearly', 'decade', 'go', 'India', 'study', 'spirituality', 'opening', 'credits', 'come', 'up', 'Who', 'Seeker', 'plays', 'song', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'much', 'Stamp', 'role', 'Stamp', 'playing', 'Stamp', 'brother', 'way', 'Chris', 'Stamp', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'many', 'Who', 'best', 'albums', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'plot', 'film', 'extremely', 'simple', 'British', 'con', 'released', 'prison', 'travels', 'immediately', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'investigates', 'daughter', 'Jenny', 'death', 'most', 'regards', 'fairly', 'average', 'film', 'two', 'things', 'make', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'First', 'one', 'most', 'brilliantly', 'edited', 'films', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'see', 'travesty', 'Sarah', 'Flack', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'best', 'editing', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'receive', 'nomination', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'editing', 'disproportionate', 'amount', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'five', 'second', 'straight', 'shot', 'might', 'feature', 'two', 'three', 'splices', 'giving', 'film', 'nervy', 'disorienting', 'feel', 'times', 'wonderful', 'effect.The', 'second', 'reason', 'film', 'elevated', 'something', 'special', 'Stamp', 'portrayal', 'Wilson', 'Stamp', 'voice', 'gotten', 'progressively', 'rawer', 'years', 'really', ""n't"", 'sound', 'anyone', 'else', 'movies', 'today', 'especially', 'when', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'one', 'danger', 'more', 'Angel', 'Death', 'person', 'have', 'read', 'Soderbergh', 'contacted', 'Stamp', 'seriously', 'beginning', 'work', 'project', 'not', 'wanting', 'go', 'forward', 'film', 'Stamp', 'involvement', 'was', 'guaranteed', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'was', 'built', 'Stamp', 'film', 'few', 'actors', 'can', 'own', 'movie', 'Stamp', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'absurdity.One', 'more', 'interesting', 'features', 'film', 'way', 'Wilson', 'memories', 'daughter', 'sense', 'failure', 'father', 'drives', 'behavior', 'sometimes', 'surprising', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'One', 'thing', 'make', 'more', 'effect', 'frequently', 'noted', 'use', 'footage', 'film', 'Stamp', 'made', '1960s', 'POOR', 'COW', 'Interestingly', 'POOR', 'COW', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'Stamp', 'East', 'Ender', 'London', 'played', 'Cockney', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'not', 'superstar', 'film', 'dramatic', 'proof', 'shoulda', 'been', 'had', 'wanted', 'be', 'one']",The Limey

Which is why I would recommend it  if you, like me, enjoy character studies.  &quot;The Limey&quot; is *not*  an action film, it's a character study of a career criminal who will soon  be too old to keep up with his lifestyle.  And my God, the performances,  particularly by Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda are absolutely incredible.  Of course, the movie rests on Stamp's performance, being the focus of the  film, and he delivers in spades.  But not to be overlooked is Fonda, who as  something of a doppleganger to Stamp's character, Wilson, is every bit  Stamp's equal.  Steven Soderbergh's direction is unsurprisingly excellent.

While it is not breaking any new storytelling, its mind bending time  altering editing is a PRUE JOY. There are nice moments, for example, when  Stamp confuses valet's for hired muscle, and a beautiful (and undoubtly  very true) statement from Peter Fonda about what the 60's really boiled  down to. Wonderful acting from all, and an ending that I will not soon  forget, this is a little gem from a great director.The Extra's: The  featurette is nice and the production spots are nice as well. THe 60's Star  commentary is mostly enjoyable, although a little disjointed. The gem here  is the commentary with Soderbergh and Lew Dobbs. Not only is Dobbs an angry  screenwriter (he points out the difference between his written vision of  character developement and Soderbergh's direction) but a talented one as  well (describing the &quot;shootout&quot; scene, and explaining how close  the film was to the written word). They appear to get along, but there is a  touch of underlying tension. The coolest (or weirdist thing) is the  &quot;psychadelic&quot; sound edits. Echo fades, overdubbs, I can't quite  decide if they are being &quot;cute&quot; or just kinda matching the mood  of the disk.My only complaint about the disk that everytime you go from  the menu to the film, even if you are in the middle of the flick, you have  to deal with the 6-8 second &quot;intro&quot; before you get back to the  movie.Overall a great experience, and a wonderful film.",4,Dvd &amp; Extras well worth it,966470400,"08 17, 2000",2000,1540,"['Movie', 'most', 'review-posters', 'here', 'completely', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'not', 'breaking', 'new', 'storytelling', 'mind', 'bending', 'time', 'altering', 'editing', 'PRUE', 'JOY', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'example', 'when', 'Stamp', 'valet', 'hired', 'muscle', 'beautiful', 'undoubtly', 'very', 'true', 'statement', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'what', '60', 'really', 'boiled', 'down', 'Wonderful', 'acting', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'little', 'gem', 'great', 'director.The', 'Extra', 'featurette', 'nice', 'production', 'spots', 'are', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'THe', '60', 'Star', 'commentary', 'mostly', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'disjointed', 'gem', 'here', 'commentary', 'Soderbergh', 'Lew', 'Dobbs', 'Not', 'only', 'Dobbs', 'angry', 'screenwriter', 'out', 'difference', 'written', 'vision', 'character', 'developement', 'Soderbergh', 'direction', 'talented', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'describing', 'quot', 'shootout', 'quot', 'scene', 'explaining', 'how', 'close', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'word', 'appear', 'get', 'along', 'touch', 'underlying', 'tension', 'coolest', 'weirdist', 'thing', 'quot', 'psychadelic', 'quot', 'sound', 'edits', 'Echo', 'fades', 'overdubbs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'decide', 'are', 'being', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'just', 'kinda', 'matching', 'mood', 'disk.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'disk', 'everytime', 'go', 'menu', 'film', 'even', 'are', 'middle', 'flick', 'have', 'deal', '6-8', 'second', 'quot', 'quot', 'get', 'back', 'movie.Overall', 'great', 'experience', 'wonderful', 'film']",The Limey

Last one I saw him in was in Get Smart..But of course that was a comedy. Bu that is far as a serious film, i must say he has very few that are proclaiming. This tome is a shame, he is a much underrated actor with immense talent, and this flick by Steven Sodenbourgh brings out the best in Sir Terence Stamp.In The Limey we have Wilson, and aging crook, fresh out of the joint, and in search of his daughter's murderer. Wilson has a lead, he knows the man responsible, all he needs is time and the help he can get to accomplish the job.The premise has been heard of before; the director however manages to craft the movie in a very original and stylish manner. Example is the fast forwarding events and flashbacking them as well...it gets a bit frustrating at times...but you have to admit that it does have an amazing impact once the movie is over.  There is barely if any B.S. in the movie; meaning that what you see is believable and realistic. No hero crap here, everything done a la old fashion. Keep in note that the movie also incorporates scenes from another movie, to show Stamp's character as a young lad in prison.This movie however is not for everyone. It's different, yes, but it's a style that is appreciated long after the first view. I know this for certain; I had to view it more than 3 times to like it.

Steven Soderbergh's &quot;The Limey&quot; is a film that argues that a father would go to extraordinary lengths for the sake of his daughter - even going so far as embarking on a destructive and chaotic rampage in order to track down and punish her killer.A man named Wilson (Terence Stamp) is released from a prison and immediately heads for Los Angeles after learning that his daughter has been killed.  The prime suspect in the murder is a record producer named Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda).  It turns out all of the trouble Valentine finds himself in with Wilson is due to an ill-advised business dealing with a man named Jim Avery (Barry Newman) involving illegal drugs.  Avery and Valentine do their best to eliminate Wilson but the vengeful father won't be denied his revenge.Terence Stamp has long been an underappreciated actor and ""The Limey"" is one of those vehicles that showcases just how talented an actor he is.

475248,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,6305741921,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[2, 2]","After watching ""The Limey"" I was in awe of what I had beheld.  This movie was dynamic and mute simultaneously.  The genre of this film is a neo-noir, in other words a modern version of those crime/mysteries films made back in the golden days of cinema.  These old school movies were black and white, ""noir"" is French for ""black"", hence the term film noir.A thousand apologies for the deviation on my cinema history lesson, I will return to the review at hand.  I have to say that I am on the fence with Steve Soderbergh's work.  Some of his movies are great; I loved the remake of Solaris in 2002, ""Out of Sight"" and ""Traffic"".  Consequently, I hated all of the ""Ocean"" films and ""Full Frontal"". So I wasn't sure what to except from ""The Limey"".  In the end, I feel Soderbergh hit the nail on the head.  The acting, editing, cinematography, acting and story were stellar.The plot is simplistic; Terence Stamp plays a British ex-con who has traveled to Los Angeles to ""investigate"" the murder of his estranged daughter Jenny.  In the process, he hooks up with some of his daughter's friends (played well by Lesley Ann Warren and Luis Guzman) in order to solve the conundrum of his Jenny's death in a very conspiratorial fashion.  Jenny was involved with a ritzy music producer (played smoothly by Peter Fonda), who appears to have his hand in her death.What I thought was sort of neat about this film is the use of flashbacks.  The movie ""Poor Cow"" was used in order to provide flashback's to Terence Stamp's character.  ""Poor Cow"" featured Stamp at a much younger age and worked well with ""The Limey"".  I don't think I have ever seen this technique used in a movie before.  As for the editing, I found it amazing.  It might annoy some viewers; it is somewhat non-liner in fashion.  The editing sort of displaces some scenes in the continuity of the film and/or foreshadows events.  There is also a distressed emphasis of dialogue with the editing.  Characters will be in one setting and then switch to another, while the dialogue is still going. There might even be a scene where the dialogue is going and none of the characters are speaking.  It reminded me somewhat of the movie ""Memento"".I have heard some criticism of Terence Stamp's character in this movie.  That he displayed neither emotion nor it didn't seem plausible that he would be that intense about finding who did or didn't kill his daughter.  Also it seemed odd that Jenny's friends would aid her father that Jenny herself was never totally copasetic with.  I believe the retort to that theory is that both Jenny's friends and father are aiding one and other out of restitution for their lack of involvement in what happened to Jenny.  Perhaps, from their perception, they could have done more to prevent Jenny's ominous outcome.  As for the end of the movie, I had to sit and really think about it.  Perhaps I am being a bit too quixotic, but once I processed and digested this film, I felt very gratified with the conclusion.I suppose I can understand why someone might not like this movie.

Peter Fonda does an ironic take on his Easy Rider hippie  image.  Imagine if Captain America had lived, sold out, and enjoyed  bursting young peoples bubbles about the sixties (&quot;it was only 66 and  early 67&quot;), and you have Terry Valentine.  The other actors were  convincing, making the most of small roles, especially Barry Newman as  Avery, Valentine's  mean spirited bodyguard.

It's a small film, with a fairly conventional plot.  What sets it apart is the stylish direction and the presence of the enigmatic Terence Stamp in the title role as a two-bit Brit criminal.  The movie tells of the death of Stamp's daughter, and his quest for revenge.  It reminded me a bit of the recent Ben Kingsley film, ""Sexy Beast.""The story is told in a jump-cut, fragmented manner that makes it a bit confusing at times but sets it apart from similar movies.  It also features quite a few flashbacks, some of which are from one of Stamp's 1960s movies, ""Poor Cow.""  These flashbacks give the film a great deal of texture, which helps the rather generic story.  The resolution is a bit too pat, but does pack a much needed emotional wallop.
