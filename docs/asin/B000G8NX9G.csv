999346,ATRI22S5MAVLB,B000G8NX9G,"Badr ""o-0""","[12, 28]","Firstly: before everyone else gets their panties in a twist, a few things1) I am arab2) I am left of the centre- So I assume we're all on the same wave length here.But I have to be honest. This documentary, as good intentions as it may have had, is terrible.Walking into the belly of the beast (so to say) as a musician with an open and honest face is fine, I dont see issue with it, but to see that Michael Franti, through all his need to push the message down your throat felt like he could slip in a bit of vanity inbetween is pointless.That said, I've been to the west bank, and I am going to be going to aid work with Iraqi refugees, so I might be clued into some information, but you dont walk around a war zone with an acoustic guitar strumming it to yourself.Firstly, you look like an idiot, secondly, most arabs, myself included would probably say ""What an idiot"" but good thing franti had a video camera with him, otherwise everyone might have just told him to shut his trap.Secondly, shouting ""Habibi"" (The word sweetheart in male context) while strumming your guitar doesnt make it a song. In fact, if you say habibi to other men its actually a homosexual connotation, unless they understand the context you are in OR in your family.Do i have something against homosexuals? No. But conservative arabs do, especially when you suggest they might be gay too. Dont believe me? Try it sometime.He could have just walked around and shouted ""HEY IM GAY, I LIKE MEN"" and it would give the same response. I mean, you can see in the video people uneasily singing along thinking ""What a stupid american"".AND THE GUY IS proud of it? ""Please excuse me, my underpants smell amazing... AND ONCE AGAIN, HABIBI WAS A MAJOR HIT WITH THE LOCALS LOL"".Dont get me wrong, I felt there was a lot right in this documentary, but to be honest, its the same as many others that have shown the human cost of war. I like how he did try and see the right end of it all, and truley speak to the people involved in it, but what annoyed me (once again) was his self indulgent my-farts-are-flowery-in-smell attitude is when he went and got some villager from the west bank to go and speak to a settlement security force member.Are you serious? Just because you stick a camera in their faces they are really going to mend ties? hmmm... lets get them talking on camera because it is an american documentary being filmed and the last thing we want to do is make it look like we are inhumane and dont want to talk to these people.I know as soon as franti went off (probably singing habibi again) they went back to their old ways. A little bit more informed and possibly willing to make amends, but in a war like situation no one cares about these things. No one really wants to sit down and listen to each others feelings no matter how awesome it really would be.There are two sides to it and you cannot get them to assimilate together. Its as simple as that. As painful as it sounds and my lack of faith in ""the spirit of brotherhood"" or whatever other thing you think i am lacking its because I have seen, dealt and spoken to people on both sides too.Maybe this documentary is meant to show us that there is more to it. Maybe its meant to show us that people of the world can come together and help. But really, all franti did was poke more times at the wound and managed to enjoy the smell of his own odor while he was at it.Give it a go if you arent into anything really mentally stimulating and want a better idea on the situation (if you havent had one before) otherwise give it a miss.Franti should stick to music, and he isnt that great at that either.AND BEFORE YOU CAN GUESS IT... HABIBI WAS A HIT AGAIN.drop this waste of time.",1,"Wow, that was terrible, michael franti is self righteous and vain.",1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,3712,"['Firstly', 'everyone', 'else', 'panties', 'twist', 'few', 'things1', 'am', 'arab2', 'am', 'left', 'centre-', 'So', 'assume', ""'re"", 'same', 'wave', 'length', 'here.But', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'documentary', 'good', 'intentions', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'terrible.Walking', 'belly', 'beast', 'say', 'musician', 'open', 'honest', 'face', 'fine', 'dont', 'see', 'issue', 'see', 'Michael', 'Franti', 'need', 'push', 'message', 'down', 'throat', 'felt', 'could', 'slip', 'bit', 'vanity', 'inbetween', 'pointless.That', 'said', ""'ve"", 'been', 'west', 'bank', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'going', 'aid', 'work', 'Iraqi', 'refugees', 'might', 'be', 'clued', 'information', 'dont', 'walk', 'war', 'zone', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'strumming', 'yourself.Firstly', 'look', 'idiot', 'secondly', 'most', 'arabs', 'included', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'What', 'idiot', 'good', 'thing', 'franti', 'had', 'video', 'camera', 'otherwise', 'everyone', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'told', 'shut', 'trap.Secondly', 'shouting', 'Habibi', 'word', 'sweetheart', 'male', 'context', 'strumming', 'guitar', 'doesnt', 'make', 'song', 'fact', 'say', 'habibi', 'other', 'men', 'actually', 'homosexual', 'connotation', 'understand', 'context', 'are', 'OR', 'family.Do', 'i', 'have', 'something', 'homosexuals', 'No', 'conservative', 'arabs', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'suggest', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'too', 'Dont', 'believe', 'Try', 'sometime.He', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'walked', 'around', 'shouted', 'HEY', 'IM', 'GAY', 'LIKE', 'MEN', 'would', 'give', 'same', 'response', 'mean', 'can', 'see', 'video', 'people', 'uneasily', 'singing', 'thinking', 'What', 'stupid', 'american', 'THE', 'GUY', 'IS', 'proud', 'Please', 'excuse', 'underpants', 'smell', 'amazing', 'ONCE', 'AGAIN', 'HABIBI', 'WAS', 'A', 'MAJOR', 'HIT', 'WITH', 'THE', 'LOCALS', 'LOL', '.Dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'felt', 'was', 'lot', 'right', 'documentary', 'be', 'honest', 'same', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'shown', 'human', 'cost', 'war', 'how', 'did', 'try', 'see', 'right', 'end', 'truley', 'speak', 'people', 'involved', 'what', 'annoyed', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'self', 'indulgent', 'my-farts-are-flowery-in-smell', 'attitude', 'when', 'went', 'got', 'villager', 'west', 'bank', 'go', 'speak', 'settlement', 'security', 'force', 'member.Are', 'serious', 'Just', 'stick', 'camera', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'mend', 'ties', 'hmmm', 'get', 'talking', 'camera', 'american', 'documentary', 'being', 'filmed', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'do', 'make', 'look', 'are', 'inhumane', 'dont', 'want', 'talk', 'people.I', 'know', 'as', 'soon', 'franti', 'went', 'probably', 'singing', 'habibi', 'again', 'went', 'back', 'old', 'ways', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'informed', 'possibly', 'willing', 'make', 'amends', 'war', 'situation', 'one', 'things', 'one', 'really', 'sit', 'down', 'listen', 'others', 'feelings', 'matter', 'how', 'awesome', 'really', 'would', 'be.There', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'assimilate', 'together', 'as', 'simple', 'As', 'painful', 'lack', 'faith', 'spirit', 'brotherhood', 'other', 'thing', 'think', 'i', 'am', 'lacking', 'have', 'seen', 'dealt', 'spoken', 'people', 'sides', 'too.Maybe', 'documentary', 'meant', 'show', 'more', 'meant', 'show', 'people', 'world', 'can', 'come', 'together', 'help', 'really', 'franti', 'did', 'was', 'poke', 'more', 'times', 'wound', 'managed', 'enjoy', 'smell', 'own', 'odor', 'was', 'it.Give', 'go', 'arent', 'anything', 'really', 'mentally', 'stimulating', 'want', 'better', 'idea', 'situation', 'havent', 'had', 'one', 'otherwise', 'give', 'miss.Franti', 'should', 'stick', 'music', 'great', 'either.AND', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'GUESS', 'IT', 'HABIBI', 'WAS', 'A', 'HIT', 'AGAIN.drop', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

999350,A1A3485UTN4SS,B000G8NX9G,The Delite Rancher,"[27, 27]","I watched ""I Know I'm Not Alone"" with low expectations. Not being a fan of Michael Franti, I never would have watched the film without reading the alternative press' glowing reviews. The Middle East holds heavy quandaries. I thought that such issues are unlikely to be given justice when depicted by some rock 'n' roller. I could not have been more wrong and I now believe that the world needs more Franti. In this documentary, the director travels in Iraq, Palestine and Israel to show the human side of conflict. So what does a rocker turned film maker do in such political hot spots? Michael Franti simply mingles with ordinary folks. Through his conversations, the audience finds a new appreciation of the people we hear about on the nightly news. While most in the West are intellectually familiar with Iraq and the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, few of us know about it personally. Michael Franti changes this as he talks to families, musicians, soldiers, teachers, teenagers and children. Through charisma, humor, music and sincerity, the boundaries that separate us are melted in a way that could only be intermediated through Franti. Aside from being powerful and emotionally encouraging, ""I Know I'm Not Alone"" is a well crafted film. While the camera work is intentionally low-fi, the movie is well edited. The symbiotic relationship between the images and custom performed soundtrack is award worthy. While 'under the radar' for most, ""I Know I'm Not Alone"" is essential viewing for anybody interested in the great conflicts of the Middle East.",5,he's not alone,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,1555,"['watched', 'Know', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Alone', 'low', 'expectations', 'Not', 'being', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Franti', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'reading', 'alternative', 'press', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'Middle', 'East', 'heavy', 'quandaries', 'thought', 'such', 'issues', 'are', 'unlikely', 'be', 'given', 'justice', 'when', 'depicted', 'rock', 'n', 'roller', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'now', 'believe', 'world', 'more', 'Franti', 'documentary', 'director', 'travels', 'Iraq', 'Palestine', 'Israel', 'show', 'human', 'side', 'conflict', 'So', 'what', 'rocker', 'turned', 'film', 'maker', 'do', 'such', 'political', 'hot', 'spots', 'Michael', 'Franti', 'simply', 'ordinary', 'folks', 'conversations', 'audience', 'new', 'appreciation', 'people', 'hear', 'nightly', 'news', 'most', 'West', 'are', 'intellectually', 'familiar', 'Iraq', 'Palestinian/Israeli', 'conflict', 'few', 'know', 'personally', 'Michael', 'Franti', 'families', 'musicians', 'soldiers', 'teachers', 'teenagers', 'children', 'charisma', 'humor', 'music', 'sincerity', 'boundaries', 'separate', 'are', 'melted', 'way', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'intermediated', 'Franti', 'Aside', 'being', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'encouraging', 'Know', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Alone', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'intentionally', 'low-fi', 'movie', 'well', 'edited', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'images', 'custom', 'performed', 'soundtrack', 'award', 'worthy', 'radar', 'most', 'Know', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Alone', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anybody', 'interested', 'great', 'conflicts', 'Middle', 'East']",N/A
