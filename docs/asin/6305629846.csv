He then releases this outstanding video containing only his greatest videos and they are certainly his greatest. Take a look at the songs he has chosen and you'll understand what I'm trying to say.OUTSIDEThe song is amazing. Great disco sound. The video mocks his bathroom incident. It is on the strange side, but still a cool video.FASTLOVEAlthough the song is really great, the video needs just a little work.SPINNING THE WHEELAwesome tune. The video is not that bad.FREEDOM 90I like what I see here. Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, etc. George, gay or not, knows how to pick 'em.KILLER/PAPA WAS A ROLLIN' STONEOkay.TOO FUNKYA funky video goes with a funky song. Incredible.FAITHThe song is not all that great, but it isn't all that bad. The video is real cool, especially in the beginning where it plays a little of I WANT YOUR SEX.I WANT YOUR SEXIf you look at the track list, it says I WANT YOUR SEX (Pt. II). Apparently, this isn't I WANT YOUR SEX (PT. II). George only put out I WANT YOUR SEX (PT. I) as a single and he made the video for that one. The video is great. The chinese girl wasn't all that pretty, but she sure had a great package.JESUS TO A CHILDA beautiful song to begin with. The video is very nice and it fits the song perfectly.WALTZ AWAY DREAMINGI haven't watched this one yet.FATHER FIGUREAlthough a great song, the video needs work, like showing more of George and the hot model in scenes together.DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME with Elton JohnAlthough I like this version because Elton ...didn't do all of it, I still wish George didn't have Elton ... join him on it...KISSING A FOOLI still do not like Jazz, but this is an irresistible song. This has to be one of my favorites. The video doesn't quite fit but it's still a good video.I KNEW YOU WERE WAITING (FOR ME) with Aretha FranklinI do not like Aretha Franklin, but somehow, I just knew that this was gonna be a great song and I was right. I love this song. The video is a great touch.SOMEBODY TO LOVE with QueenI just wish Freddy Mercury was alive to join George and his bandmates on this one. I have been a great fan of Queen for quite some time. George sang this song with emotion and he sang it with passion. That's what makes me love this song so much. The way he handles the stage is incredible.MONKEYNot one of my favorites, but the video is real cool.ONE MORE TRYFirst off, this is the song that turned me into a George Michael fan. This is one of the most beautiful ballads I have ever heard. The video does not fit, but it is a great video.STAR PEOPLE '97Okay.I CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE MENot bad.A DIFFERENT CORNERA great song.YOU HAVE BEEN LOVEDNot bad.CARELESS WHISPERThis was actually done when George was in WHAM! This song was a classic back then. It is a classic today. It will remain a classic in the future and then on. Everyone knows it. The concept of the video fits the song perfectly because the concept of the video shows what is being sung in the song. Great video.If you are a George Michael fan and you don't have this, add it to your collection of George Michael merchandise. You will definitely not be disappointed.

What a talent!  His vocal abilities are mind-blowing --I'm sure I'm not the only guy who wishes he could sing like him!--, his songwriting skills are sharp and insightful, and he knows how to put on a show (on video and on stage).This DVD, with a few exceptions, is a great retrospective of his work so far.  From his beginnings as a teen idol (I'm old enough to remember when &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; had the girls swooning) to the more mature and socially-conscious messenger that he is today.  Not all the videos work, let's agree that some are boring, but most are superbly entertaining.  The first video, &quot;Outside&quot;, is a trip indeed and is quite an aural and visual treat.  You'll remember that one for a long time!Technically, the DVD is excellent.  The images are crisp and the sound is clear and loud.  One exception is with &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, which I feel could have been digitally remastered since the video is somewhat grainy compared to the others and the sound is a tad lower on this one.  But this is minor and really doesn't detract from this classic song.The bonus BBC interviews and performances are excellent.  The interview shows George as a very comfortable-with-himself person with a great sense of humor.Well worth owning.",5,"THAT VOICE!

471772,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,6305629846,Luis Hernandez,"[52, 53]","The voice of George Michael is probably one of the greatest in music history. Starting with Wham! and later with a successful solo career, Michael's transformation from teenage poster boy to a mature adult singer  happened in front of our eyes due to the growth of music videos during the  last 20 years.This compilation which covers most of the span of  Michael's career makes an excellent addition to any music lover's  collection. As a pioneer of sex in music videos, Michael has definately  left his mark on the medium. His popularization of fashion models in such  videos as &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;Too Funky&quot; made many runway  models household names. Other videos such as &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;  popularized foreplay without any smut involved at all.The highlights of  this DVD collection have to be the videos &quot;Fast Love&quot; and  &quot;Outside&quot;. &quot;Fast Love&quot; (from his &quot;Older&quot;  album) incoporates beautiful color schemes and special effects.  &quot;Outside&quot; (his new single off his greatest hits collection)  starts out a soft-core German sex film. However, in reality Michael wants  the song and video to be a message about sexuality (especially his own's)  and the troubles it can lead people to. While many are aware of his 1998  scandal where he was arrested at a public bathroom in Los Angeles due to  indecent behavior, Michael actually shows he has no shame of what he did in  what I think is one of the most inventive videos made in recent  years.The only negative thing here is that with the exception of  &quot;Careless Whisper,&quot; all of his videos from his Wham! days were  not included in this collection. Videos such as &quot;Wake Me Up Before You  Go-Go&quot; and &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; were excellent videos,  however it seems that the producers of this video compilation thought  differently.Besides the videos, the DVD version contain several live  performances on several American and British programs. It was great to see  these, because it only shows that Michael's voice is all natural, even in  front of a studio audience. I loved this collection, and hope that everyone  who purchases this collection will enjoy it as much as I did.",5,Great Compilation of Video Classics,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,2228,"['voice', 'George', 'Michael', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'music', 'history', 'Starting', 'Wham', 'later', 'successful', 'solo', 'career', 'Michael', 'transformation', 'teenage', 'poster', 'boy', 'mature', 'adult', 'singer', 'happened', 'front', 'eyes', 'due', 'growth', 'music', 'videos', 'last', '20', 'years.This', 'compilation', 'most', 'span', 'Michael', 'career', 'excellent', 'addition', 'music', 'lover', 'collection', 'pioneer', 'sex', 'music', 'videos', 'Michael', 'definately', 'left', 'mark', 'medium', 'popularization', 'fashion', 'models', 'such', 'videos', 'quot', 'Freedom', 'quot', 'quot', 'Too', 'Funky', 'quot', 'made', 'many', 'runway', 'models', 'household', 'names', 'Other', 'videos', 'such', 'Want', 'Sex', 'quot', 'popularized', 'foreplay', 'smut', 'involved', 'all.The', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'collection', 'have', 'be', 'videos', 'quot', 'Fast', 'Love', 'quot', 'quot', 'Outside', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fast', 'Love', 'quot', 'quot', 'Older', 'quot', 'album', 'beautiful', 'color', 'schemes', 'special', 'effects', 'quot', 'Outside', 'quot', 'new', 'single', 'greatest', 'hits', 'collection', 'out', 'soft-core', 'German', 'sex', 'film', 'However', 'reality', 'Michael', 'song', 'video', 'be', 'message', 'sexuality', 'especially', 'own', 'troubles', 'can', 'lead', 'people', 'many', 'are', 'aware', '1998', 'scandal', 'where', 'was', 'arrested', 'public', 'bathroom', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'due', 'indecent', 'behavior', 'Michael', 'actually', 'shame', 'what', 'did', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'inventive', 'videos', 'made', 'recent', 'years.The', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'here', 'exception', 'quot', 'Careless', 'Whisper', 'quot', 'videos', 'Wham', 'days', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'collection', 'Videos', 'such', 'quot', 'Wake', 'Me', 'Up', 'Go-Go', 'quot', 'quot', 'Everything', 'Wants', 'quot', 'were', 'excellent', 'videos', 'however', 'producers', 'video', 'compilation', 'thought', 'videos', 'DVD', 'version', 'contain', 'several', 'live', 'performances', 'several', 'American', 'British', 'programs', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'only', 'Michael', 'voice', 'natural', 'even', 'front', 'studio', 'audience', 'loved', 'collection', 'hope', 'everyone', 'who', 'purchases', 'collection', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did']",N/A

However I gave this DVD away as I just didnt like his style of videos. I almost kept it for the one concert clip as I think he is actaully at his best in a concert belting it out and connecting with his fans.The videos are good visual quality and sound but watching one after the other back to back I found I was really put off by the progression of gyrating near-naked woman sexually provocative and pouting at the camera.Hey - I dont see myself as a prude but I'm a woman and women just dont turn me on by being provocative. I don't need to share my living room with them in such quantity as they do nothing for me, I don't identify with them and for me they detract from George.The best video clip for me was the simplest - George in white, on his own, really getting into and expressing the soul and mood of a song.The question is why George has needed the women thing throughout his videos. Is it because this has become current video style (unfortunately)?Is it because men like to communicate to other men their place in the pecking order by being able to attract and be surrounded by 'babes' (and isnt George's voice and standing beyond the need for those games?)Was George trying to show he can hold his own in a straight world even though he has been 'bi-' in sexuality and when falling in love prefers men?So why does he need this whole female thing when I'd guess most of his fans are women and like me arent turned on by this stuff so it misses the mark?I havent seen myself as a women's lib type, and certainly not moralistic - but I really am, as a modern woman, rather tired of all the objectifying of women. George is about the last person who needs to keep flogging these sex images. He stands tall in all respects as an entertainer and he seems to be a genuinely nice guy who can afford to simplify and just share himself with audiences.I've had the CD set that matches these videos so as these dont distract with the images bye-bye DVD - and hopefully looking forward to a George Michael concert DVD if one is ever released!",3,Music great but visuals detract,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,2126,"['George', 'really', 'great', 'voice', 'strong', 'lot', 'varity', 'colour', 'However', 'gave', 'DVD', 'away', 'just', 'didnt', 'style', 'videos', 'almost', 'kept', 'one', 'concert', 'clip', 'think', 'actaully', 'best', 'concert', 'belting', 'connecting', 'fans.The', 'videos', 'are', 'good', 'visual', 'quality', 'sound', 'watching', 'one', 'other', 'back', 'back', 'found', 'was', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'progression', 'gyrating', 'near-naked', 'woman', 'sexually', 'provocative', 'pouting', 'camera.Hey', 'dont', 'see', 'prude', ""'m"", 'woman', 'women', 'just', 'dont', 'turn', 'being', 'provocative', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'share', 'living', 'room', 'such', 'quantity', 'do', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'identify', 'detract', 'George.The', 'best', 'video', 'clip', 'was', 'simplest', 'George', 'white', 'own', 'really', 'getting', 'expressing', 'soul', 'mood', 'song.The', 'question', 'why', 'George', 'needed', 'women', 'thing', 'videos', 'become', 'current', 'video', 'style', 'unfortunately', 'men', 'communicate', 'other', 'men', 'place', 'pecking', 'order', 'being', 'able', 'attract', 'be', 'surrounded', ""'babes"", 'isnt', 'George', 'voice', 'standing', 'need', 'games', 'Was', 'George', 'trying', 'show', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'straight', 'world', 'even', 'been', ""'bi-"", 'sexuality', 'when', 'falling', 'love', 'prefers', 'men', 'So', 'why', 'need', 'whole', 'female', 'thing', 'when', ""'d"", 'guess', 'most', 'fans', 'are', 'women', 'arent', 'turned', 'stuff', 'mark', 'havent', 'seen', 'women', 'lib', 'type', 'certainly', 'not', 'moralistic', 'really', 'am', 'modern', 'woman', 'rather', 'tired', 'objectifying', 'women', 'George', 'last', 'person', 'who', 'keep', 'flogging', 'sex', 'images', 'tall', 'respects', 'entertainer', 'be', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'simplify', 'just', 'share', 'audiences.I', ""'ve"", 'had', 'CD', 'set', 'matches', 'videos', 'so', 'dont', 'distract', 'images', 'bye-bye', 'DVD', 'hopefully', 'looking', 'forward', 'George', 'Michael', 'concert', 'DVD', 'one', 'ever', 'released']",N/A

Rognlien,"[17, 19]","OK, so maybe not the Wham! days, but those days were (officially) not about George as a solo artist.What remains is a collection of videos from my favorite recording artist ever.  The campy bootie-shaking in Faith - the boy in the tophat dancing around in Monkey - the noticeably absent pop singer in &quot;Freedom 90&quot; (one of my favorite songs by him) and the somewhat &quot;out&quot; George in &quot;Jesus to a Child.&quot;  If you watch closely, you can see the pivotal turning point in which his music becomes more honest, more fresh, and less driven by the need/desire for commercial success.  Like Madonna and Michael Jackson, he is a master of video as an art form - often sacrificing self-promoting face time for the rest of the video-making process.  Thankfully, he ended his career woes and personal issues and jumped out in front of the camera again to be seen by fans.  Not included is one of his most controversial videos - Praying for Time, in which a dispute with then-label Columbia led him to refuse to appear in his videos, replacing himself with text on screen.  I wish they'd have included this video as well, as it was one of the most powerful (if unintentional) uses of words on screen to convey the power of the song's lyrics.I've said it before and I'll say it again here - pop music is a hugely underappreciated music form, and this video collection is a great representation of one of the true masters of pop.

Coming right after his infamous public &quot;outing&quot;, Michael is charming, funny, articulate and frank; but the magical moment happens when Michael takes a break from the interview to sing &quot;A Different Corner.&quot;  In those few moments, George Michael miraculously distills a whole lifetime of performing - and living - experience into a masterfully sung and interpreted song of true poignancy and pathos.  The voice is more mellow, more resonant and simply more beautiful than ever. He breathes the very essence of the song's heartbreak with infinite skill and empathetic sagacity, of someone who's been there, and lived life - a lot.  His superior vocal technique is automatic, spontaneous; his way with the nuancing and phrasing instinctive, sure and born of a real artist.  Enjoy this collection for the different scenarios played out in the videos and imaginative song stylings, and don't forget to close off the video with the songs featured within the interview: it reveals the evolution of one of pop music's major talents.",5,Audio/ visual evolution of a major talent,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",2002,1272,"['George', 'Michael', 'major', 'career', 'output', 'well', 'documented', 'encapsulated', 'selection', 'featured', 'here', 'true', 'climax', 'presentation', 'hour-long', 'interview', 'originally', 'aired', 'BBC', 'television', 'Coming', 'right', 'infamous', 'public', 'quot', 'outing', 'quot', 'Michael', 'charming', 'funny', 'articulate', 'frank', 'magical', 'moment', 'when', 'Michael', 'break', 'interview', 'sing', 'quot', 'Different', 'Corner.', 'quot', 'few', 'moments', 'George', 'Michael', 'miraculously', 'whole', 'lifetime', 'performing', 'living', 'experience', 'masterfully', 'sung', 'interpreted', 'song', 'true', 'poignancy', 'pathos', 'voice', 'more', 'mellow', 'more', 'resonant', 'simply', 'more', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'very', 'essence', 'song', 'heartbreak', 'infinite', 'skill', 'empathetic', 'sagacity', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'there', 'lived', 'life', 'lot', 'superior', 'vocal', 'technique', 'automatic', 'spontaneous', 'way', 'nuancing', 'phrasing', 'instinctive', 'sure', 'born', 'real', 'artist', 'Enjoy', 'collection', 'different', 'scenarios', 'played', 'out', 'videos', 'imaginative', 'song', 'stylings', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'close', 'off', 'video', 'songs', 'featured', 'interview', 'evolution', 'one', 'pop', 'music', 'major', 'talents']",N/A
