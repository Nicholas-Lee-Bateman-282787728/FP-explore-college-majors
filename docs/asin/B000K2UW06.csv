1030379,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000K2UW06,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 3]","Jet Li's 'Fearless' has all the best aspects you'd want from an Asian movie:  combat with stunning movies that shuffle the deck, ancient, wise lessons, and exquisite beauty that lingers on like a butterfly.  'Fearless' does all of this and more.  The film focuses on a likable protagonist, Hao Yuanjita (Li) who is at the top of his ""wushi"" discipline, and so successful is he that everyone in town wants to be his apprentice.The movie takes place at the turn of the last century during the Qing Dynasty.  In most scenes the buildings have ancient beauty that is framed by the picturesque horizons, so it is easy to watch.  Every opponent who challenges Hao is introduced and brings a different sort of menace to the stage where a large audience gathers.  For big, burly Master Chin there's sparring over a coffin for a nice effect.  The tension each new challenger Hao must hurdle is given time to build up, especially at the local restaurant where Hao is keen on buying rounds (and gathering debts) of wine for everyone.There are wisely times for recuperation--for the hero and for the audience.  Lessons about honor, respect, revenge, discipline, and humility are given Confucian treatment, so we care about what happens to all the characters.  Time outs for tea and planting rice maintain a properly restful mood for Hao and the observer.Exciting and absorbing, 'Fearless' leaves its audience breathless.",4,Breathless,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1408,"['Jet', 'Li', ""'Fearless"", 'best', 'aspects', ""'d"", 'want', 'Asian', 'movie', 'combat', 'stunning', 'movies', 'shuffle', 'deck', 'ancient', 'wise', 'lessons', 'exquisite', 'beauty', 'butterfly', 'more', 'film', 'likable', 'protagonist', 'Hao', 'Yuanjita', 'Li', 'who', 'top', 'wushi', 'discipline', 'so', 'successful', 'everyone', 'town', 'be', 'apprentice.The', 'movie', 'place', 'turn', 'last', 'century', 'Qing', 'Dynasty', 'most', 'scenes', 'buildings', 'have', 'ancient', 'beauty', 'framed', 'picturesque', 'horizons', 'easy', 'watch', 'opponent', 'who', 'Hao', 'introduced', 'different', 'sort', 'menace', 'stage', 'where', 'large', 'audience', 'gathers', 'big', 'burly', 'Master', 'Chin', 'sparring', 'coffin', 'nice', 'effect', 'tension', 'new', 'challenger', 'Hao', 'must', 'hurdle', 'given', 'time', 'build', 'up', 'especially', 'local', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Hao', 'keen', 'buying', 'rounds', 'gathering', 'debts', 'wine', 'are', 'wisely', 'times', 'recuperation', 'hero', 'audience', 'Lessons', 'honor', 'respect', 'revenge', 'discipline', 'humility', 'are', 'given', 'Confucian', 'treatment', 'care', 'what', 'characters', 'Time', 'tea', 'planting', 'rice', 'maintain', 'properly', 'restful', 'mood', 'Hao', 'observer.Exciting', 'absorbing', 'audience', 'breathless']",N/A

1030384,A1TPXS3X3QJIEO,B000K2UW06,"Arthur Gardner ""Aardcore""","[8, 8]","All I have to say is that this movie has a charming story about the true martial artist, Huo Yuanjia, who stood up against all those against China in dire times of diplomatic and social depravity of his people and rose above all odds and in the end, became a legend in his own right. What's sad is that the reality about Huo was so enthralled and mixed with legend that the so called 'truth' about him is a mystery. Was he able to jump over 20 feet in the air? Maybe. Was he truly the most legendary martial artist of all time? He could be. The fact that fiction revolves around his existence, or the short time there was of his (he died when he was in his 40's...) it's hard to tell who he really was... or how he really even died!Check him out, do some research about him and if you've seen the movie already, watch it again after gaining some insight and knowledge about this legendary man and you might gain an astounding amount of respect for this man and his exploits whether this film does the trick or not... the MESSAGE of the film overrules all else, just as Jet Li intends in this film. He wanted the lesson to be learned, of restraint, of martial arts being purely a defensive mechanics for self-improvement, discipline and insight.The story tends to jump around, a bit TOO much from one time frame into Huo's adulthood... but the final fight in the end, which is interluded in the beginning, then finished at the end of the movie... is soul moving. I've watched a lot of movies that have brought tears to my eyes, brought joy to my soul and laughter to my heart but the final fight in this movie was one of the most powerful scenes I'd ever seen in filmographic measure-- almost bringing up to the caliber of oldskool cinematography, like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Not comparing, just stating and analysis of the scene-- it's simply something worth noting for on an immensely powerful level.This movie is a MUST if you love Jet Li.A MUST if you love martial arts.A MUST if you love wonderful cinematography.The movie is flat out great, some flaws in concept but the execution of its focus on wisdom outperforms everything else.",5,It's all about the Final Fight.,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,2146,"['have', 'say', 'movie', 'charming', 'story', 'true', 'martial', 'artist', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'China', 'dire', 'times', 'diplomatic', 'social', 'depravity', 'people', 'rose', 'odds', 'end', 'became', 'legend', 'own', 'right', 'What', 'sad', 'reality', 'Huo', 'was', 'so', 'enthralled', 'mixed', 'legend', 'so', 'called', ""'truth"", 'mystery', 'able', 'jump', '20', 'feet', 'air', 'Maybe', 'truly', 'most', 'legendary', 'martial', 'artist', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'fact', 'fiction', 'existence', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'died', 'when', 'was', '40', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'really', 'even', 'died', 'Check', 'out', 'do', 'research', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'already', 'watch', 'again', 'gaining', 'insight', 'knowledge', 'legendary', 'man', 'might', 'gain', 'astounding', 'amount', 'respect', 'man', 'exploits', 'film', 'trick', 'not', 'MESSAGE', 'film', 'else', 'just', 'Jet', 'Li', 'film', 'wanted', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'restraint', 'martial', 'arts', 'being', 'purely', 'defensive', 'mechanics', 'self-improvement', 'discipline', 'insight.The', 'story', 'jump', 'around', 'bit', 'TOO', 'much', 'one', 'time', 'frame', 'Huo', 'adulthood', 'final', 'fight', 'end', 'interluded', 'beginning', 'then', 'finished', 'end', 'movie', 'soul', 'moving', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'movies', 'have', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'brought', 'joy', 'soul', 'laughter', 'heart', 'final', 'fight', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'filmographic', 'measure', 'almost', 'bringing', 'up', 'caliber', 'oldskool', 'cinematography', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Not', 'comparing', 'just', 'stating', 'analysis', 'scene', 'simply', 'something', 'worth', 'noting', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'level.This', 'movie', 'MUST', 'love', 'Jet', 'Li.A', 'MUST', 'love', 'martial', 'arts.A', 'MUST', 'love', 'wonderful', 'cinematography.The', 'movie', 'flat', 'out', 'great', 'flaws', 'concept', 'execution', 'focus', 'wisdom', 'outperforms', 'everything', 'else']",N/A
1030385,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B000K2UW06,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[3, 10]","I tend to be a little picky about which movies I watch, especially for those rare theaters visits, but to some degree for my rentals pick as well.  The factor I most often use to influence my decisions are the films' trailers.  Usually they are a decently reliable indicator of whether I will like a film, although once in a while it proves to be inaccurate (MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND among others).Unfortunately, JET LI'S FEARLESS is another of those films that catches your attention with an impressive trailer, but turns out to have little else of interest or enjoyment beyond the clips used to advertise it.  The film does feature some impressive martial artistry and choreography, for which Jet Li has become the pre-eminent martial arts action star.  And though his acting ability and language proficiency are limited, he does have a good screen presence.The weakness lies within the remainder of the film (which composes the majority of it).  It is competently and even skillfully filmed, but the pacing goes from slow to dreary at some points.  The writing is bland and sappy and preachy.  Though the film is based on a true story, there are still points which strain its credibility, most especially the fight between Li's character and the titanic American boxer.  In fact, the creative license they take with the scene crosses that line from creative embellishment to insulting the audience's intelligence.The film-marketers may lure you in with ""promises"" of dazzling fight scenes (which is what happened in my case), but the bulk of the film is tedious sanctimony.  No umbrage towards those who market and promote this film; they did their job well, though it is little reason to celebrate.  Overall, this is not a terrible film, nor even a bad film.  But it is not a very satisfying movie, and that is ultimately what most influences the ratings (number of stars) that comes with a review.This film claims to be Jet Li's final epic.  Though Jet Li is still great - maybe among the best - it doesn't necessarily make a costume drama that he is in any more exciting.  If you want to see an amazing martial arts action star who does action-filled (if not very cerebral) movies and his own AMAZING stunts, Tony Jaa is the new champion.",2,I was expecting something different,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2242,"['tend', 'be', 'little', 'picky', 'movies', 'watch', 'especially', 'rare', 'theaters', 'visits', 'degree', 'rentals', 'pick', 'as', 'well', 'factor', 'most', 'often', 'use', 'influence', 'decisions', 'are', 'films', 'trailers', 'Usually', 'are', 'decently', 'reliable', 'indicator', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'once', 'while', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'MY', 'SUPER', 'EX-GIRLFRIEND', 'others', '.Unfortunately', 'JET', 'LI', 'FEARLESS', 'films', 'catches', 'attention', 'impressive', 'trailer', 'out', 'have', 'little', 'else', 'interest', 'enjoyment', 'clips', 'used', 'advertise', 'film', 'feature', 'impressive', 'martial', 'artistry', 'choreography', 'Jet', 'Li', 'become', 'pre-eminent', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'star', 'acting', 'ability', 'language', 'proficiency', 'are', 'limited', 'have', 'good', 'screen', 'presence.The', 'weakness', 'remainder', 'film', 'majority', 'competently', 'even', 'skillfully', 'filmed', 'pacing', 'slow', 'dreary', 'points', 'writing', 'bland', 'sappy', 'preachy', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'still', 'points', 'strain', 'credibility', 'most', 'especially', 'fight', 'Li', 'character', 'titanic', 'American', 'boxer', 'fact', 'creative', 'license', 'take', 'scene', 'line', 'creative', 'embellishment', 'insulting', 'audience', 'intelligence.The', 'film-marketers', 'may', 'lure', 'promises', 'dazzling', 'fight', 'scenes', 'what', 'happened', 'case', 'bulk', 'film', 'tedious', 'sanctimony', 'umbrage', 'towards', 'who', 'market', 'promote', 'film', 'did', 'job', 'well', 'little', 'reason', 'celebrate', 'Overall', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'even', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'what', 'most', 'ratings', 'number', 'stars', 'review.This', 'film', 'claims', 'be', 'Jet', 'Li', 'final', 'epic', 'Jet', 'Li', 'still', 'great', 'maybe', 'best', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'costume', 'drama', 'more', 'exciting', 'want', 'see', 'amazing', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'star', 'who', 'action-filled', 'not', 'very', 'cerebral', 'movies', 'own', 'AMAZING', 'stunts', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'new', 'champion']",N/A

The movie works rather well as both a loving biographical account and a solid period piece on life in China at the close of the 19th century.While I enjoyed the movie overall, there are some major weakness in the production that keeps it from reaching the lofty heights of previous Chinese films like `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or `Hero.' After a slow start it does bounce back to regain your interest and the ending is a nice tribute to the legendary figure of Huo, but it does suffer from poorly translated subtitles that come across stiff and unrealistic. The film also lacks the epic scope, imaginative vistas and artistry of the previously mentioned films.

I would give the US DVD version a 7/10 just for the fighting alone.  The story was a bit muted, but since they made such a big deal about this being Jet's last fight film I thought they really did a great job.However, having seen the full movie that was intended...I would say this movie is now a solid 9/10.

Everything about Jet Li's Fearless is awesome, and downright amazing. First, let's start with the characters; Jet Li's main character is developed very well in this movie. He starts off as a young boy, eager to learn Wushu, but is prohibited by his father. After watching his father battle a rival wushi martial artist, he is disappointed to see him lose. The rivals father has a son, who beats up the young Jet Li - then it begins: he swears to never lose a fight and begins to train by himself at a young age to master his fathers form of wushu. After many battles, he determined to become the best, and even defeats the young man who beat him up when he was a little boy. And this is just the begining of his journey.But with all this success, comes a price - and this is what the movie delves into. It goes into paying the price for murder, and the consquences of seeking revenge. It goes into hope and redemption for those that have err'd in there way. It has a very good theme, and the acting is great. The movies soundtrack is also very fitting.Now onto the fight scenes. The fight scenes are incredible. A mix of realism and fantasy keeps them entertaining and fresh - if your worried about ""over-the-top"" fighting, where guys go flying 50 feet everywhere and blood spills all over the place; fret not, there is none of that here. This isn't to say there isn't any fantasy in the fight scenes, but they keep it within reason, and play it off as something believable. The camera angles and sound effects they used during the fight scenes are all excellent. The sound is clear - you can feel every punch, and hear the clashing of every sword. I highly recommend an awesome sound system, or a very nice pair of headphones if you want it real loud in your ears. Easly some of the best fight scenes to ever be filmed. Ever (yes, this easly rivals the old Bruce Lee movies).The only problem with this movie is the 45min gap in the middle where nothing is really happening. While this does give the movie a break from the non-stop action, it is quite, well, boring. But it does add to Jet Li's character and is a needed to help push the setup for his return to the ring, and to bring honor back to the men of Asia.Overall: 5 stars.

Indeed, the original title - like that of those films - is simply the man's name. One advance caution: Even after we posit the occasionally superhuman athleticism on display as a genre convention, the viewer must be prepared to accept the narrative as unabashed hagiography. By comparison, Ron Howard's fact-fudging whitewash in ""A Beautiful Mind"" was a demythologizing expose.But back to that athleticism! The happy pairing of Jet Li, giving a stunning display of late-career mastery, and world-famous fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping is a Baryshnikov/Balanchine-caliber teaming - conveying as few other films have that there's a reason why they're called the martial *arts*. The combat is thrillingly beautiful to watch - as deeply aesthetic an experience as any classical dance recital. [When, in the bonus features, Jet says, ""They couldn't accomplish this in America"", one can't begrudge the self-evident truth of it.] And, for the chopsocky addicts, there's a deathblow so crisply perfect that it had me joyfully shouting ""Deathblow!"" at my TV.But what makes this such a compelling film - one that will stay with the viewer long after other well-staged kung fu movies have dimmed in the memory to a blur of feet and fists - is that this punch, far from being the champion's capping victory, is his most profound defeat. You'll want to watch the film to fully understand why. Suffice it to say that the movie's theme is aptly stated as ""A fighter's most difficult opponent is himself.""Huo Yuanjia's ultimate triumph over this opponent made for a moving film experience.

The film is based on the life of Huo Yuanjia, a national sports hero of old China.From a young age, Huo watched as his father trained students.  His dream was to become like his father, a master fighter.  Eventually, he became an excellent stage fighter.Jet Li gives a moving performance as Huo Yuanjia.  On top of his game he makes one tragic decision which leads to fatal consequences for his family.  He delivers on a man who loses everything that he loves and falls into the depths of despair.Wandering aimlessly, Huo finds himself rescued and nursed back to health.  A blind girl teaches him the true meaning of life.  The scene in the rice paddies is one of the most inspirational parts of this film. From the pit of despair he rises like the phoenix to become the man which Chinese history remembers.Destiny and fate take over as the course of events lead to the ultimate showdown with four fighters-three Westerners and Japan's national champion.  The pride of China is at stake. The ending is truly unexpected but believable.The marital arts sequences are well choreographed.

However, Huo notices that his Dad can never manage to really inflict pain on his opponents. After losing a fight to a bullying peer, Young Huo vows that he will never lose a fight.  The story shows how Yuanjia rises to power and his life story.  A couple of parts the dialogue are kind of confusing and you get the sense that something is probably lost in translation with the subtitles. The cinematography, storyline and acting are good.  I liked the historical parts of the movie and showing how Chinese people when they were being colonized by the British. The Chinese and Japanese comradery and mutual respect was nice also. The action/fight sequences are great.  This film is loosely based on the actual Huo Yuanjia's life, there were parts of the actual Yuanjia's life which were shrowded in mystery because of the time period that he lived in. I watched some of the extra features and they were saying that this will be Jet Li's last film and he will retire.

He has selected FEARLESS as his final film as a martial artist and a better choice of story for a final bow could not be imagined.Based on the life of Chinese Martial Arts Master Huo Yuanjia (1869-1910), the founder and spiritual leader of the Jin Wu Sports Federation still in existence internationally, Jet Li acts the role of Huo Yuanjia, a man whose father's heroics were surpassed only by his compassion, a trait the film shows us to be the lesson learned by Huo Yuanjia.  Beginning with his childhood where all of his influences and those people who altered his life are introduced by child actors (the weakest portion of this film), he grows into the role as champion Washu fighter of his province, but his championship is not without problems: he inadvertently kills his final opponent opening a series of tragedies that drives him, a broken man, into the rural area of China where he learns the simple life and ideals of his people.  He returns to his province to visit the sites of his family's memorials and the memorial of the man he killed.  He further accepts a challenge to fight again only this time despite onerous odds he allows his spiritual awakening to govern the outcome.The film is lushly beautiful with some of the finest cinematography of China we have yet to see.  The choreography of the fight sequences is superb and Jet Li commits his all to the role both as actor and martial arts fighter.  The audience is left feeling a new sense of respect for the travails of China at the early part of the 20th century, for the field of Marital Arts, for the dignity of one of China's heroes, and for the performer/actor Jet Li.

1030412,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,B000K2UW06,Haseeb,"[5, 5]","This film is a true classic when it comes to martial arts films.  The setting is in the early 1900s and based on a true character called Yuanjia.  As explained by Jet Li in the bonus selection of the DVD, he intended for this to be his very last film.  So he wanted to show the true meaning of the martial arts through his character which he did admirably.  I've never seen a martial arts film as action packed but at the same time filled with profound philosophy of what the martial arts are all about, an excellent story, great acting and a beautiful sound track.  One can watch this film and learn more about what the true martial arts are about than watching 100 UFC or NHB matches or 100 beat-them-up-because-they-did-me-wrong martial arts flicks which are so popular these days.The dialogue between the Jappanese martial artist in the film and Yuanjia was very poignant and made the film for me.  The two sat down and discussed the philosophy of the martial arts over tea and related that to judging the grade of teas.  It was just brilliant.  They had a relaxed conversation with each other and had the utmost respect for one another yet they knew they would later have to fight each other.  After the final match as well as a couple of others (mostly notably O'brien Vs. Yuanjia, chinese fighter vs. Yuanjia's father, Spanish the Dresaza fighter Vs. Yuanjia) I was saying to myself, now that is what the martial arts are all about.Just one minor point... I wonder why what was said in the subtitles are quite different from the unrated version, the theatrical version and the version which is played on Cinemax.  I think Jet Li made a more profound philosophical statement on the Cinemax version on the tea dialogue scene which is curiously missing from the unrated and PG-13 version.

1030414,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000K2UW06,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","If this really is Jet Li's final martial arts film, then he went out in dazzling fashion. Now, by no means have I seen all of Jet Li's flicks, but, of all the ones I've seen, FEARLESS has to rank in my top two, sharing honors with HERO. His acting here is nuanced enough that he brings the historical figure Huo Yuanjia to graceful life for his audiences. It helps that Yuanjia's life philosophies closely mirror those of Jet Li's. They both adhere to the belief that the true purpose of wushu is not to merely best a foe in conflict but to, in fact, strengthen one's body, mind, and soul; thus, in a way, this movie also becomes a mini-bio on the actor himself. And need I even mention Jet Li's awesome talents as a martial artist?In terms of style, FEARLESS is more grounded and earthy than the ethereal CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, and HERO, with a cinematography that is remarkable if not as ambitious in scope as those three other films. Being now 42 years old, Jet Li wanted FEARLESS to have something of weight to say. This film pretty much encapsulates Jet Li's beliefs with regards to wushu. Although the first leg of the film is laden with galvanic, flesh-crunching fight sequences which seem to celebrate violence for violence's sake, the film later transforms itself into a thoughtful and somewhat bittersweet quest for redemption: redemption for the man Huo Yuanjia and for his beleaguered country of China.Plot and SPOILERS begin: FEARLESS is the turn-of-the-century tale of celebrated Chinese martial artist Huo Yuanjia, who formed the Jingwu Sports Federation and attempted to instill higher ideals within the face of organized fighting. Back then, in the Qing Dynasty, China was considered weak and rudderless, bullied by foreign powers, and mockingly nicknamed the ""Sick Man of Asia."" Into this turbulent setting, in the town of Tianjin, young, asthma-ridden Huo Yuanjia grows up, wanting to be a great fighter like his father, who competes in martial arts contests, each time having to sign a death waiver. However, his father sternly discourages Huo from training in the martial arts (or ""wushu,"" which means ""way of combat""), instead instructing him to practice on his calligraphy. But Huo is adamant and learns to fight anyway. He grows up and becomes a very skilled but arrogant wushu fighter, gaining fame and notoriety. He wins 38 matches in a row and begins a martial arts school. Along the way, he picks up plenty of bootlickers and freeloaders who pass themselves off as friends.But one disastrous and ill-advised fight changes everything, for him and his family. This devastating tragedy causes Huo to become crazed and to wander off and end up in a distant village. There, in his bedraggled and shell-shocked state, he is tended to by a blind girl named Moon and becomes attuned to the villagers' simple ways. As he grows closer to Moon, he also comes upon and embraces a redefining system of values which he then adapts into his fighting style and into his approach to life.Having fully recovered, he leaves the tiny village and returns to his school in Tianjin, only to find it destitute and deserted, except for one remaining faithful servant. Determined, he sets out to re-establish his school via competition. Huo ends up facing a monstrous American wrestler named Hercules O'Brien, who he then beats in the ring. Huo becomes a celebrity, which causes worry to surface within the Foreign Chamber of Commerce, who holds China in its firm grasp. Fearing that Huo would become a source of Chinese national pride, the Foreign Chamber issues a challenge for him to engage four fearsome fighters in separate matches, all four matches to take place in the course of one day. Huo accepts, and, in 1910, Shanghai, he fights them. END SPOILERS.Director Ronny Yu (BRIDE OF CHUCKY, FREDDY VS. JASON) and action director/choreographer Yuen Wo Ping combine their skills to create a harmonious masterpiece of action and philosophy, of brutality and grace, of fighting the good fight and also of turning the other cheek. Ronny Yu manages to maintain a nice pace and also draws out some very credible emoting from his cast. Besides the fine work of Jet Li, there are the more than adequate performances of Dong Yong as Yuanjia's childhood friend Jinsun, Nakamura Shidou as Yuanjia's honorable final opponent Tanaka, and the beautiful Sun Li, who makes her film debut as the serene, blind village girl Moon.Meanwhile, Yuen Wo Ping continues to dole out jaw-dropping combat sequences. It certainly lends even more credibility that the combatants are mostly legitimate fighters as Jet's opponents range from an English boxer, a Belgian blade & lance fighter, to an expert in Spanish swordfighting. Of course, no one has more credibility than Jet Li himself, who, before retiring at the age of 17, had been the All-Around National Wushu Champion of China for numerous years. In fact, Jet Li is so fast that the camera needed to be filmed at 6 times its normal speed to fully capture all of his movements. With wire work kept to a minimum, we are treated to more realisticallly depicted fight scenes. The lofty platform sequence (with those ascending wooden posts) and the fateful fight in the restaurant, by the way, are the two standouts in the midst of what already are amazing action sequences.Sad to say, the meager special features consist of only one deleted scene and a 16-minute behind the scenes look which does  include an interview with Jet Li. But never mind that. If Jet Li did indeed decide to exit the martial arts genre, then FEARLESS is a fitting capper. It definitely offers acrobatic, action-packed moments of mayhem while simultaneously remaining sensitive, thought-provoking, and inspirational. This milestone film is textured enough to hold resonance for all the cravers of chop-socky,  historical buffs, and thoughtful cinemaphiles of the world.

The movie features Jet Li in what is probably the greatest martial arts movie ever made, showcasing the master at the peak of his prowess in a film that also embodies his martial arts philosophy.The movie begins with Huo Yuanjia secretly watching his father practicing martial arts by performing the traditional kung fu moves culminating with a blow of his hand to a slab of hard concrete slab and Huo, after his father has left the practice arena, touching the stone slab and discovering that it has shattered in two, showcasing the phenomenal feats of kung fu demonstrated by his father.The story, then progresses into Huo witnessing his father engaging in a duel with a formidable opponent, who could barely match his skill, only to hold back, in an act of restrain, because he didn't want to incurred severe damage to his opponent and, as a result, spurring the opponent to take advantage of the situation by dealing Huo's father the defeating blow.Dissatisfied with this, Huo challenged the opponent's son to a match which finds him badly defeated due to his lack of kung fu training, spurring him to secretly obtain his father's instruction manual and secretly practicing kung fu, while vowing to take revenge on his father's opponent's son (which he successfully accomplishes), and vowing to be the greatest martial arts practitioner in China and, subsequently, challenging every single opponent in the People Republic and emerging as the undefeated champion with the exception of the one most formidable opponent who he later kills in a match in retaliation for the wounding of one of his disciples by the opponent's disciple.However, one of his opponent's disciple slaughters Huo's entire family and, incites Huo to seek revenge on his opponent's family only to find himself holding back with empathy for his opponent's grieving family members.Resultant of this, Huo loses all interest in life and attempts to commit suicide, only to be rescued by the inhabitants of a small Chinese village; the inhabitants of whom slowly nourishes him back to health and, finds Huo maturing and reaching an epiphany that constitutes a change of philosophy from him seeking to be the best martial arts practitioner in China to embracing a philosophy that wushu should only be meant as a form of competitive sport and, as such, finding him challenging the best martial arts practitioners throughout the world; including a champion wrestler from the United States as well as engaging in a tournament against four martial arts practitioner, comprising, among others, of a fencing champion and the best from Japan in a fixed competition that was designed to make him lose.However, Huo emerges the undisputed winner in all matches, resultant of which he is poisoned by the Japanese who had betted on his defeated, resulting in Huo losing the match despite overwhelming support from the crowd, until the last move where he manages to deal a blow to his opponent which, if he had not held back, would have proven fatal. Then, before Huo finally collapses in demise, his Japanese opponent, realizing that he had, in default been defeated, raises Huo's hand in saluting of his spirit and win with uproars applause and cheering from the crowd, transforming Huo into a legendary hero who had restored pride to the Chinese people who had been humiliated by foreign aggressors who had declared China the sick old man of Asia.Fearless constitutes the greatest martial arts film ever made with extraordinarily well choreographed fight sequences as well as incorporating one of the best story lines ever encapsulated in a martial arts film.Highly recommended.",5,Greatest Martial Arts Movie Ever Made,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,3974,"['Fearless', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'martial', 'arts', 'legend', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'who', 'reputedly', 'defeated', 'Russian', 'wrestler', 'Irish', 'boxer', 'time', 'when', 'China', 'was', 'known', 'sick', 'old', 'man', 'Asia', 'thereby', 'restoring', 'pride', 'Chinese', 'people', 'nation', 'transforming', 'much', 'revered', 'legend', 'history', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'Jet', 'Li', 'what', 'probably', 'greatest', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'showcasing', 'master', 'peak', 'prowess', 'film', 'also', 'martial', 'arts', 'philosophy.The', 'movie', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'secretly', 'watching', 'father', 'practicing', 'martial', 'arts', 'performing', 'traditional', 'kung', 'fu', 'moves', 'culminating', 'blow', 'hand', 'slab', 'hard', 'concrete', 'slab', 'Huo', 'father', 'left', 'practice', 'arena', 'touching', 'stone', 'slab', 'discovering', 'shattered', 'two', 'showcasing', 'phenomenal', 'feats', 'kung', 'fu', 'demonstrated', 'father.The', 'story', 'then', 'Huo', 'witnessing', 'father', 'engaging', 'duel', 'formidable', 'opponent', 'who', 'could', 'barely', 'match', 'skill', 'only', 'hold', 'back', 'act', 'restrain', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'incurred', 'severe', 'damage', 'opponent', 'result', 'spurring', 'opponent', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'dealing', 'Huo', 'father', 'defeating', 'blow.Dissatisfied', 'Huo', 'challenged', 'opponent', 'son', 'match', 'badly', 'defeated', 'due', 'lack', 'kung', 'fu', 'training', 'spurring', 'secretly', 'obtain', 'father', 'instruction', 'manual', 'secretly', 'practicing', 'kung', 'fu', 'vowing', 'take', 'revenge', 'father', 'opponent', 'son', 'successfully', 'vowing', 'be', 'greatest', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioner', 'China', 'subsequently', 'challenging', 'single', 'opponent', 'People', 'Republic', 'emerging', 'undefeated', 'champion', 'exception', 'one', 'most', 'formidable', 'opponent', 'who', 'later', 'match', 'retaliation', 'wounding', 'one', 'disciples', 'opponent', 'disciple.However', 'one', 'opponent', 'disciple', 'slaughters', 'Huo', 'entire', 'family', 'Huo', 'seek', 'revenge', 'opponent', 'family', 'only', 'find', 'holding', 'back', 'empathy', 'opponent', 'grieving', 'family', 'members.Resultant', 'Huo', 'interest', 'life', 'attempts', 'commit', 'suicide', 'only', 'be', 'rescued', 'inhabitants', 'small', 'Chinese', 'village', 'inhabitants', 'whom', 'slowly', 'back', 'health', 'Huo', 'maturing', 'reaching', 'epiphany', 'change', 'philosophy', 'seeking', 'be', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioner', 'China', 'embracing', 'philosophy', 'wushu', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'meant', 'form', 'competitive', 'sport', 'such', 'finding', 'challenging', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioners', 'world', 'including', 'champion', 'wrestler', 'United', 'States', 'as', 'well', 'engaging', 'tournament', 'four', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioner', 'comprising', 'others', 'fencing', 'champion', 'best', 'Japan', 'fixed', 'competition', 'was', 'designed', 'make', 'lose.However', 'Huo', 'undisputed', 'winner', 'matches', 'resultant', 'poisoned', 'Japanese', 'who', 'had', 'betted', 'defeated', 'resulting', 'Huo', 'losing', 'match', 'overwhelming', 'support', 'crowd', 'last', 'move', 'where', 'deal', 'blow', 'opponent', 'had', 'not', 'held', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'proven', 'fatal', 'Then', 'Huo', 'finally', 'demise', 'Japanese', 'opponent', 'realizing', 'had', 'default', 'been', 'defeated', 'Huo', 'hand', 'saluting', 'spirit', 'win', 'uproars', 'applause', 'cheering', 'crowd', 'transforming', 'Huo', 'legendary', 'hero', 'who', 'had', 'restored', 'pride', 'Chinese', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'humiliated', 'foreign', 'aggressors', 'who', 'had', 'declared', 'China', 'sick', 'old', 'man', 'Asia.Fearless', 'greatest', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'sequences', 'as', 'well', 'incorporating', 'one', 'best', 'story', 'lines', 'ever', 'encapsulated', 'martial', 'arts', 'film.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","What can us viewers do to change your mine?...O well I got to say that director Ronny Yu has made the right choice of casting Jet Li as Huo Yuan Jia, after Jet portrays Huang Fei Hong in his remarkable `Once Upon A Time Trilogy.' This has once again strengthened the image of Jet Li as the Chinese hero among the Chinese around the world. This is a glorified tribute to the famous Shanghai martial arts master, Huo Yuanjia. The above subject has also been visited by Jet himself in `Fist of the Legend.'The movie starts with Huo Yuanjia's famous tournament against the champions of the Sphere of Influence nations. We get to the Japanese challenger and then are sent into a flashback to Huo's youth. We are given the details of Huo's early life, his trials and tribulations. How he was, what he became and how he got there. This section is full of all the other parts of martial arts that have nothing to do with fighting (at this point I'm thinking fondly of Bruce's `Circle of Iron.'All the fight scenes through out the film are choreographed well and are quite exciting. 'Fearless' does carry the message not to resort violence to settle any problem, where we can see how violence did to Huo's loved ones. The showdown between Huo and other foreign fighters also promotes the idea of sparing your enemy a chance, no matter how deadly they could be. This, somehow, reflects on part of the idea and philosophy Jet Li understands and promotes from his one year Buddhism studies. As this is a semi-bio-pic, it runs into the same inherent problems in the genre; namely that you must have something invested in the person already. The person must be someone you know something or care something about. Rarely does a movie in this genre make you care about the character if you are not interested. It is much like hypnosis, if you do not believe you will not be put under.As for this film being Jet Li's last epic, it breaks my heart but I really did enjoy it. In his own words, it's a representation of his own struggles as an actor/martial artist. It's all him (maybe a tiny bit of wire-work)! If this is what he identifies with, how he wants to end it, why should we expect him to do otherwise.

Anyone who thinks this was cliche or is upset because of dialogue translations really miss the point with this one.Not only are the fight scenes the best I've seen especially with minimal CGI additions but the story is certainly one not told in American theaters these days. The whole philosophy of ""work together as a team - one weak person acting on their own can hurt the community"" type of thing is certainly not the American way. With that being said, this story was portrayed beautifully and could really wake up some of us fat Americans that possibly our way of thinking does not make it right to impose on all other countries. I applaud this film for portraying the last two fighters with respect and honor. It could of been so easy to make the USA fighter as cheater, sore loser, etc. And BTW - this film isn't political at all it just shows how one mans vision can really change the way that people view life and how you keep learning new things up intil the end.Watch the unrated version vs the theatrical version - the plot almost depends on it!

Some of the early Chinese martial arts movies were not very good but they have improved a lot over the years.  Fearless with Jet Li was made by the same producers of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which is one of my all time favorite martial arts movie.The story in Fearless was inspired by a real-life hero.  There are numerous fantastic action scenes in this film, which includes unarmed and weapon combat fighting.  However, the story is also very meaningful as Jet Li finally realizes the truth his late father, who was a Wu Shu master, had taught him about fighting. This movie is about an obsession to be the number one best fighter in China, only to discover that his obsession destroyed his life.  In the end he finally discovers the real philosophy of living a meaningful life.In conclusion, if you like a well crafted story combined with some great Asian martial arts action, you will like this film.Rating:  4 Stars.

1030435,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000K2UW06,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 4]",Jet Li's Fearless (Huo Yuan Jia) : 6 out of 10: This movie is a true near miss. For most of its running time it is action packed with handsome photography and gritty realistic fight scenes. To bad a too predictable by half story and Jet Li's performance hold it back from greatness.What the move does right however it does very well indeed. The fight scenes are extremely well choreographed and differ in tone and skill from each other. Except for the final fight they are all very satisfying. They range from an acrophobic set piece early on above a busy city square to a humorous match between Li and a boxer that reminds one of Rocky's fight against Hulk Hogan in Rocky 3.There is no obvious wire work or CGI involved this is the real deal. Had the movie stuck with it's strengths it would have been much better off.Unfortunately halfway through the film Jet Li's character (A loosely interpreted version of a real historical Chinese patriot) decides to forgo fighting for a life in an idyllic rice patty. Like the picture perfect Japanese village in the Last Samurai the rice patty is an idolized place with supermodel blind girls and hobbits. (Okay I made the hobbits part up; but try to watch those scenes and not think of Middle Earth.)Jet Li's acting in the transformation scenes is wanting and his costars (especially best friend Dong Yong) steal every scene they are in. It is hard to get emotionally connected with the character (Who goes from brash youth to wise old man after a couple of rice plantings with little transformation and no gray area or shadings of personality. Both characterizations are extremely broad and simply seem two different people.)This leads to a surprisingly sterile finale. I simply couldn't care about the character or his cause. Though the story is more fleshed out than say in Hero the character is simply to broad to identify with as an individual. That said I did love the fight scenes.,3,You have nothing to fear but Fearless itself.,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,1931,"['Jet', 'Li', 'Fearless', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', '6', '10', 'movie', 'true', 'miss', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'action', 'packed', 'handsome', 'photography', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'bad', 'too', 'predictable', 'half', 'story', 'Jet', 'Li', 'performance', 'hold', 'back', 'greatness.What', 'move', 'right', 'however', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'choreographed', 'differ', 'tone', 'skill', 'other', 'final', 'fight', 'are', 'very', 'satisfying', 'range', 'acrophobic', 'set', 'piece', 'early', 'busy', 'city', 'square', 'humorous', 'match', 'Li', 'boxer', 'one', 'Rocky', 'fight', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Rocky', '3.There', 'obvious', 'wire', 'work', 'CGI', 'involved', 'real', 'deal', 'Had', 'movie', 'stuck', 'strengths', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off.Unfortunately', 'halfway', 'film', 'Jet', 'Li', 'character', 'loosely', 'interpreted', 'version', 'real', 'historical', 'Chinese', 'patriot', 'forgo', 'fighting', 'life', 'idyllic', 'rice', 'patty', 'picture', 'perfect', 'Japanese', 'village', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'rice', 'patty', 'idolized', 'place', 'supermodel', 'blind', 'girls', 'hobbits', 'made', 'hobbits', 'part', 'up', 'try', 'watch', 'scenes', 'not', 'think', 'Middle', 'Earth', 'Jet', 'Li', 'acting', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'wanting', 'costars', 'especially', 'best', 'friend', 'Dong', 'Yong', 'steal', 'scene', 'are', 'hard', 'get', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'character', 'Who', 'brash', 'youth', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'couple', 'rice', 'plantings', 'little', 'transformation', 'gray', 'area', 'shadings', 'personality', 'characterizations', 'are', 'extremely', 'broad', 'simply', 'seem', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'surprisingly', 'sterile', 'finale', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'character', 'cause', 'story', 'more', 'fleshed', 'say', 'Hero', 'character', 'simply', 'broad', 'identify', 'individual', 'said', 'did', 'love', 'fight', 'scenes']",N/A

Many people reviewing this film seem to have issues with the discrepancies between the two versions (about 40 minutes of footage lost). The Director's Cut  certainly tells a more full and in depth story, but it is also significantly longer.Jet Li's character of Huo Yuanjia begins his journey as a selfish, arrogant, Wushu master (Li's martial art specialty) that is determined to be the very best. There has been harsh criticism about the way Huo is portrayed in the film. So much so that the actual grandson of Huo Yuanjia filed a lawsuit against Jet Li and the film's production company for inaccurately portraying Yuanjia.The film is incredibly well made, with great cinematography, fantastic fight scenes and a compelling story with complex characters. The scenery and imagery of rural China is so beautifully shot and portrayed in Fearless. The added time in the Director's Cut really gives the film more of an epic feel (though I could have done without the olympic intro and exit). Nothing is rushed, and some things that may seem insignificant end up adding more to the story and character development.The film ends on a resonant note, completing Huo Yuanjia's story and showing the lasting impact of his legacy.",5,The Story of Huo Yuanjia 4.5*,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,1336,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'recently', 'see', 'more', 'rare', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Fearless', 'addition', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Many', 'people', 'reviewing', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'issues', 'discrepancies', 'two', 'versions', '40', 'minutes', 'footage', 'lost', 'Director', 'Cut', 'certainly', 'more', 'full', 'depth', 'story', 'also', 'significantly', 'Li', 'character', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'journey', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'Wushu', 'master', 'Li', 'martial', 'art', 'specialty', 'determined', 'be', 'very', 'best', 'been', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'way', 'Huo', 'portrayed', 'film', 'So', 'much', 'actual', 'grandson', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'Jet', 'Li', 'film', 'production', 'company', 'inaccurately', 'portraying', 'Yuanjia.The', 'film', 'incredibly', 'well', 'made', 'great', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'compelling', 'story', 'complex', 'characters', 'scenery', 'imagery', 'rural', 'China', 'so', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'portrayed', 'Fearless', 'added', 'time', 'Director', 'Cut', 'really', 'film', 'more', 'epic', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'olympic', 'intro', 'exit', 'Nothing', 'rushed', 'things', 'may', 'seem', 'insignificant', 'end', 'up', 'adding', 'more', 'story', 'character', 'development.The', 'film', 'resonant', 'note', 'completing', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'story', 'showing', 'lasting', 'impact', 'legacy']",N/A

Skeptical at buying from an unknown source, I took the chance and bought it anyway.  Shipping was very quick, the seller very nice, the DVD came in original wrapping, price was good.The Directors cut was totally awesome and explained so much more and was so more indepth.  You could understand the story so much more as well as the connection with all those involved in the story.There are still 2 more versions in the 2 disk CD for me to watch, The Unrated Version and the Theatrical version.  I don't think that they can give me as much pleasure nor live up to the directors cut, but I shall watch the Unrated Version, since I've seen the Theatrical version, here in the US.For those looking for the Correct Directors cut version I've put the link to the place were you can get it, you wont be disappointed.",5,Totally awesome ...........

His greatest and last accomplishment was participating a competition of 4 fights with the world's best fighters.The movie opens with Huo quickly defeating the first 3 fighters.  When the 4th comes up, you're taken back to Huo's childhood, leading up to the last fight.Bullied and defeated, Huo vows to never lose another fight with anyone.  He was able to fulfil his vow.  However, Huo become cocky and carries little regard/appreciation for life.However, that all changed when Huo battles a local fighter to death for revenge.  The slain fighter's godson retaliates by killing Huo's family.  Distraught and ashamed, Huo flees the city and winds up in some remote village.In this village, Huo rediscovers humanity and humbles himself.  Over time, Huo returns home.  From there, he learns of China's participation in a competition for the world's best martial arts fighter.  With support from his friend and students, Huo was able to get in the competition.The last battle was interesting because it is against Japan's Mr. Mito.  Huo and Mito previously had a friendly get-together with tea.  Their conversation had me laughing.  However, in the last fight, something happens that put Mito in a difficult situation.  Nonetheless, Huo desires to continue and Mito honors it.I do have to say that I liked that ""choreography"" of the martial arts fighting.  I thought that that story was a bit long.

He, along with director Ronny Yu create not only one of the best martial arts films ever, but an excellent historical story about a man's (Huo Yuanjia) conflict with himself, on his journey to represent an entire country.This movie showcases some of the most magnificently staged sparring, including matching and different styles and weapons. The first two major fights are ""wushu vs. wushu"" style fights, as Huo Yuanjia, who taught himself wushu against his father's wishes, tries to egotistically turn himself into a local champion, forgetting what his parents tried to teach him, forgetting what wushu and the martial arts are truly about and going only for personal glory. Due to circustances about the 2nd of these fights that should not be revealed, he exiles himself, and learns through self-examination and self-awareness the lessons his parents were teaching.Upon returning, and seeing the ridicule forced upon the Chinese by other countries at that time (1900's), he takes on the reigning US Champion Hercules O'Brien (played by Nathan Jones, WWF wrestling champion). Truly one of the best choreographed fights in recent film history, the massive Jones against the dimunitive Li is one of the martial highlights of the film.Huo Yuanjia, with the help of his childhood friend, then founds the Jin Wu Sports Federation (still in existence today), to rebuild pride in China.The beginning and ending of the film spotlights Huo Yanjia vs. four champions (three from the west and one from Japan). The bonus material in the film briefly reviews these four champions true to life martial arts expertise and experience, giving credence to why these fights scenes are so amazingly real.The bonus material, especially the ""Fearless Journey"" piece, is an excellent albeit short review of Jet Li's vision of wushu.This movie is on my list of top ten martial arts films of all time, besting even Jet Li's Fists of Legend and some of Bruce Lee's best. While the martial arts sequences are the centerpiece, the story represents truly what wushu and martial arts are about: the struggle we all have with ourselves to be better tomorrow that we are today.

He returns to his martial arts roots with what is said to be Jet Li's final wushu martial arts film.  The movie captured my imagination by taking us back almost a hundred years to 1910 and then rolling back the clock in flashback to 1880 in Tianjin.  You get a sense that time has unfolded when we flashback 30 years, although both times seem in the distant past from our present day perspective.  Jet Li does a good job as Huo Yuanjia who doesn't realize the value of his family, even though he loves them.  The scenes between he and his daughter were charmers.  The tragedy of revenge and retaliation that wipes out his family and sends him on a search for meaning in his life adds depth to the film.  Shidou Nakamura who was in Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" plays the final fight sequence where both opponents have a moral code, while the backers of the fight are motivated by greed.  Dong Yong as Huo's restaurant-owning buddy Nong does a nice job of withdrawing support when Huo is acting from pride.  ""Fearless"" brings you into the story and lets you travel with the characters.

And while Jet Li is not going to get an Oscar for his acting, I thought he did a very convincing job both as a rash young man and a wiser wushu master.It is one of Jet Li's stronger movies. Perhaps overall, his best. The plot is engaging throughout, the acting was satisfying and the fight sequences are exciting.I have two big disappointments with the movie:1. Jet Li's progression from being an arrogant young man to a humble master was absolutely horribly developed. I did not missed Michelle Yeoh one bit, but I missed the Thai fighter sequence that was cut out because that probably was a lesson for him that helped change him. Basically Jet Li just ended up in a village and there was a couple dialogues between him and Betty Sun and suddenly he decided to leave and head for Shanghai. Not at all satisfying.2. The fight scenes was a bit disappointing for me early on. While there are quite a bit of wirework, the main problem is that they use WAY too much computer effects. I mean, is it necessary for them to slow mo every single flip and leap and speed it back up like The Matrix? Was it necessary for them to pull the actors back twenty feet every time they received a punch from Jet? This is Huo Yuan Jia, not Juggernaut. Plus, for those of you that is anticipating the fight scenes between Jet and the British, German and Spanish fighters, you will be disappointed because each fight is like a minute long, not really anything special.Here is what didn't disappoint:1. Jet Li vs. Nathan JonesFantastic fight. Quite a few wirework, but it didn't distract from the fight at all. The most watchable fight by Jet Li in years. What I like about it is that the fact that Wo Ping did not forget that Jones is a wrestler and he put that aspect of his martial arts to the screen wonderfully. Jet Li got thrown like a rock, squashed like a bug, and lifted like a doll. To see Jet Li counter Jones was a thing to watch!2. Jet Li vs. Shidou NakamuraWOW. The best weapons fight Jet Li ever done. Period. The entire sequence was exciting, fresh and full of character. My favorite scene in the movie is when they accidently switch weapons and Jet Li and Shidou stopped the fight and exchanged their weapons back. Brilliant scene for both characters.3. The ending. Preachy, but emotional. I like it.Overall, one of Jet Li's stronger film. Perhaps his best since the Once Upon a Time in China despite the short comings.I can't wait to watch the uncut version.8.5/10",4,Fearless is perhaps Jet Li's most well-rounded film!,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2537,"['Well', 'let', 'begin', 'saying', 'Fearless', 'Jet', 'Li', 'most', 'emotional', 'movie', 'Jet', 'Li', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'Oscar', 'acting', 'thought', 'did', 'very', 'convincing', 'job', 'rash', 'young', 'man', 'wiser', 'wushu', 'master.It', 'one', 'Jet', 'Li', 'stronger', 'movies', 'Perhaps', 'overall', 'best', 'plot', 'engaging', 'acting', 'was', 'satisfying', 'fight', 'sequences', 'are', 'exciting.I', 'have', 'two', 'big', 'disappointments', 'movie:1', 'Jet', 'Li', 'progression', 'being', 'arrogant', 'young', 'man', 'humble', 'master', 'was', 'absolutely', 'horribly', 'developed', 'did', 'not', 'missed', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'one', 'bit', 'missed', 'Thai', 'fighter', 'sequence', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'probably', 'was', 'lesson', 'helped', 'change', 'Basically', 'Jet', 'Li', 'just', 'ended', 'up', 'village', 'was', 'couple', 'dialogues', 'Betty', 'Sun', 'suddenly', 'decided', 'leave', 'head', 'Shanghai', 'Not', 'satisfying.2', 'fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'early', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'wirework', 'main', 'problem', 'use', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'computer', 'effects', 'mean', 'necessary', 'slow', 'mo', 'single', 'flip', 'leap', 'speed', 'back', 'Matrix', 'Was', 'necessary', 'pull', 'actors', 'back', 'twenty', 'feet', 'time', 'received', 'punch', 'Jet', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'not', 'Juggernaut', 'anticipating', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Jet', 'British', 'German', 'Spanish', 'fighters', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'fight', 'minute', 'long', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'special.Here', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint:1', 'Jet', 'Li', 'vs.', 'Nathan', 'JonesFantastic', 'fight', 'few', 'wirework', 'did', ""n't"", 'distract', 'fight', 'most', 'watchable', 'fight', 'Jet', 'Li', 'years', 'What', 'like', 'fact', 'Wo', 'Ping', 'did', 'not', 'forget', 'Jones', 'wrestler', 'put', 'aspect', 'martial', 'arts', 'screen', 'wonderfully', 'Jet', 'Li', 'got', 'thrown', 'rock', 'squashed', 'bug', 'lifted', 'doll', 'see', 'Jet', 'Li', 'counter', 'Jones', 'was', 'thing', 'watch', '2', 'Jet', 'Li', 'vs.', 'Shidou', 'NakamuraWOW', 'best', 'weapons', 'fight', 'Jet', 'Li', 'ever', 'done', 'Period', 'entire', 'sequence', 'was', 'exciting', 'fresh', 'full', 'character', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'accidently', 'switch', 'weapons', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Shidou', 'stopped', 'fight', 'exchanged', 'weapons', 'back', 'Brilliant', 'scene', 'characters.3', 'ending', 'Preachy', 'emotional', 'it.Overall', 'one', 'Jet', 'Li', 'stronger', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'short', 'comings.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'uncut', 'version.8.5/10']",N/A

""Fearless"" is historical fiction, combining fact, speculation, and purely fictional elements to create an action-packed morality tale and rumination on the meaning of martial art.""Fearless"" opens in Shanghai, 1910, as wushu champion Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li) represents China against 4 foreign fighters in a match arranged by the Shanghai Foreign Council. Yuanjia wins the first 3 fights, and as we wait for his 4th opponent, the film returns to Yuanjia's childhood and follows the events of his life that led to this point. Yuanjia was a sickly boy who stubbornly pursued martial arts in spite of his father's (Collin Chow) admonitions. Yuanjia's determination leads him to great glory, but he ignores his mother's (Hee Ching Paw) warnings against selfish ambition. Yuanjia's arrogance eventually brings catastrophe, and he must reevaluate his values and his life's purpose.There are four extended fight scenes in ""Fearless"" plus a few short ones. Director Ronny Yu and fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping have minimalized wire work, lending the fights more realism than I've seen in martial arts movies of late. There is wire work, but physics-defying moves don't dominate. It's difficult to make martial arts movies look fresh, and one attempt to do so is a nighttime fight between Master Huo and Master Chin. I've never seen hand-to-hand combat in such a dimly lit environment. While it does create variety and a certain grittiness, its difficult to make out the intricacies of the fight, so I have mixed feelings about low light combat. Overall, ""Fearless"" is an exciting and thoughtful film, a fitting conclusion to Jet Li's action hero career that exhibits his dramatic acting skills as well.The DVD (Universal 2006 Unrated edition): You have the option of watching either the theatrical version or the unrated Chinese edit of the film. Bonus features include a deleted scene (7 min) that takes place in the farming village. ""A Fearless Journey"" (16 min) featurette includes interviews with director Ronny Yu, cinematographer Poon Hang Sang, and Jet Li. Li talks about the meaning he finds in wushu and his decision to retire. There is discussion of the film's themes, creating the fight scenes, and shooting film up to 6 times normal speed to capture the movements in the fights.

1030458,APIW11UEPKIC2,B000K2UW06,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[6, 6]","Finally, I can see why this is being promoted as Jet Li's last martial arts epic.  He has stood on the top of the top after the Once Upon a Time In China series, and I found this movie even more enjoyable.  In 1994 Jet Li and Yuen Woo Ping collaberated on a remake of Bruce Lee's 'Fist of Fury' called 'Fist of Legend' which told the story of Chen Zen, a fictional character who takes revenge after his Master Hua Yuanjia dies.  So it is very fitting for Jet to play the Master as the non fictional character himself.  You will be taken back at the start to hear Jet's voice so much.  I don't ever rememebr him talking that much and it did seem a bit odd.  In his earlier movies like OUATIC his voice was always dubbed.  It was nice to hear though and Jet is great in those emotional moments.  Good thing because you will certainly have some emotions running through your body by the end of this.I loved the start as it reminded me a bit of my favorite move ever- 'Legend of a Fighter', also a story of Hua Yuanjia and it was directed by Woo Ping.  I was wondering if this was just going to be a remake when they showed the war footage to note the year is 1940 or so and also Hua spying on his father, secretly learning kung fu.  Then we realize that Ronny Yu is directing this and it is a big budget 2006 movie and all is good.Hua Yuanjia is perfectly played by Jet Li and shows the full range of emotions that an actor needs.  Studying martial arts from a very young age to prove his father wrong and show that he can become a great fighter even if he has asthma.  We learn later that practicing and fighting has cured his asthma.  With Hua being very arragont he forgets that he cannot be the champion of the county.  There is still a man named Master Chin who is considered the best.  After Master Chin beats one of Hua's disciples to a pulp, Hua comes for murderous revenge.  This was a duel to the death that was absolutely mindblowing.  Not only is the action sublime, it is as brutal as can be.  After this we get a cut that was all too quick to the young man telling his master that he had said negative things about Master Chin's wife and that he was wrong for doing this.  Hua goes and completely loses himself in sorrow but luckily we get a woman named Moon from a nearby village that takes care of him.  After seeing life in a whole new way Hua comes back and with help from his childhood friend Jinsun, he moves to Shanghai and opens the Jingwu Sports Federation.  With an ego being higher than ever before and the Japanese and British trying to destroy the Chinese people, he may have his hands full.  There are at least 10 fights that I can remember in this movie but 3 stood out as some of the best action sequences ever.  The fight with master Chin was epic and the second one was a fight with Nathan Jones, the same 7 foot 350 lb muscleman who fought Tony Jaa in 'The Protector' and had a spear jammed in his throat by Brad Pitt in 'Troy'.  Well Fearless takes the cake with his best screen fight yet.  You will never ever see a fight that seems like it is going to be so cheesy and turns out as breathtaking as this.  I didn't even know that Woo Ping had it in him to make such an awesome fight out of a 7 foot Jones and a 5 foot 6 inch Li.  You will honestly believe that a man of Li's size can truly take down anybody.The last fight is the best of the movie bar none, maybe the greatest fight ever put into a movie.  I cannot allow myself to give anything away about it but you will not be dissapointed with the end of this movie no matter what genre you usually watch.I give the movie a 4.5/5 but not the full 5 because there seemed to be so much missing.  I couldn't figure out how they could leave parts in like the crazy bum always asking Jet Li if he is the champion but not leaving in parts explaining Jet startign up his school, more on the betrayal of his student, if the crazy bum ever has a significant scene in the movie at all.  I really hope that I can give it the full 5 stars it deserves when it comes to DVD and we have an extended edition but more than that, I hope that we get an extended edition.Like I said at the top, I can see why this is being billed as Jet's last martial arts movie. Reason being is that I thought it was his best ever performance.  Just don't be fooled and believe Jet won't make anymore fighting flicks.  He has already been talking for quite a while about 'The One' part 2, a Shaolin fighter movie with Tsui Hark, and a movie with Jackie Chan.  So don't worry, they say it's his last because they want to see it so badly, AND THEY HAVE GOOD REASON!!!",4,The story of Hua Yuanjia,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,4616,"['Finally', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'being', 'promoted', 'Jet', 'Li', 'last', 'martial', 'arts', 'epic', 'stood', 'top', 'top', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'series', 'found', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', '1994', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Yuen', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'collaberated', 'remake', 'Bruce', 'Lee', ""'Fist"", 'Fury', 'called', ""'Fist"", 'Legend', 'told', 'story', 'Chen', 'Zen', 'fictional', 'character', 'who', 'revenge', 'Master', 'Hua', 'Yuanjia', 'very', 'fitting', 'Jet', 'play', 'Master', 'non', 'fictional', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'start', 'hear', 'Jet', 'voice', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'rememebr', 'talking', 'much', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'odd', 'earlier', 'movies', 'OUATIC', 'voice', 'was', 'always', 'dubbed', 'was', 'nice', 'hear', 'Jet', 'great', 'emotional', 'moments', 'Good', 'thing', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'emotions', 'running', 'body', 'end', 'this.I', 'loved', 'start', 'reminded', 'bit', 'favorite', 'move', 'ever-', ""'Legend"", 'Fighter', 'also', 'story', 'Hua', 'Yuanjia', 'was', 'directed', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'remake', 'when', 'showed', 'war', 'footage', 'note', 'year', '1940', 'so', 'also', 'Hua', 'spying', 'father', 'secretly', 'learning', 'kung', 'fu', 'Then', 'realize', 'Ronny', 'Yu', 'directing', 'big', 'budget', '2006', 'movie', 'good.Hua', 'Yuanjia', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Jet', 'Li', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'actor', 'needs', 'Studying', 'martial', 'arts', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'prove', 'father', 'wrong', 'show', 'can', 'become', 'great', 'fighter', 'even', 'asthma', 'learn', 'later', 'practicing', 'fighting', 'cured', 'asthma', 'Hua', 'being', 'very', 'arragont', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'champion', 'county', 'still', 'man', 'named', 'Master', 'Chin', 'who', 'considered', 'best', 'Master', 'Chin', 'one', 'Hua', 'disciples', 'pulp', 'Hua', 'murderous', 'revenge', 'was', 'duel', 'death', 'was', 'absolutely', 'mindblowing', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'sublime', 'as', 'brutal', 'can', 'be', 'get', 'cut', 'was', 'too', 'quick', 'young', 'man', 'telling', 'master', 'had', 'said', 'negative', 'things', 'Master', 'Chin', 'wife', 'was', 'wrong', 'doing', 'Hua', 'completely', 'sorrow', 'luckily', 'get', 'woman', 'named', 'Moon', 'nearby', 'village', 'care', 'seeing', 'life', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'Hua', 'back', 'help', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jinsun', 'Shanghai', 'Jingwu', 'Sports', 'Federation', 'ego', 'being', 'higher', 'ever', 'Japanese', 'British', 'trying', 'destroy', 'Chinese', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'hands', 'full', 'are', 'least', '10', 'fights', 'can', 'remember', 'movie', '3', 'stood', 'out', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'ever', 'fight', 'master', 'Chin', 'was', 'epic', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'fight', 'Nathan', 'Jones', 'same', '7', 'foot', '350', 'lb', 'muscleman', 'who', 'fought', 'Tony', 'Jaa', ""'The"", 'Protector', 'had', 'spear', 'jammed', 'throat', 'Brad', 'Pitt', ""'Troy"", 'Well', 'Fearless', 'cake', 'best', 'screen', 'fight', 'yet', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'see', 'fight', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'cheesy', 'out', 'as', 'breathtaking', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'had', 'make', 'such', 'awesome', 'fight', '7', 'foot', 'Jones', '5', 'foot', '6', 'inch', 'Li', 'will', 'honestly', 'believe', 'man', 'Li', 'size', 'can', 'truly', 'take', 'down', 'last', 'fight', 'best', 'movie', 'bar', 'none', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'fight', 'ever', 'put', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'end', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'usually', 'watch.I', 'give', 'movie', '4.5/5', 'not', 'full', '5', 'seemed', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'missing', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'could', 'leave', 'parts', 'crazy', 'bum', 'always', 'asking', 'Jet', 'Li', 'champion', 'not', 'leaving', 'parts', 'explaining', 'Jet', 'startign', 'up', 'school', 'more', 'betrayal', 'student', 'crazy', 'bum', 'ever', 'significant', 'scene', 'movie', 'really', 'hope', 'can', 'give', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'when', 'DVD', 'have', 'extended', 'edition', 'more', 'hope', 'get', 'extended', 'edition.Like', 'said', 'top', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'being', 'billed', 'Jet', 'last', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'Reason', 'being', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'ever', 'performance', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'believe', 'Jet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'fighting', 'flicks', 'already', 'been', 'talking', 'quite', 'while', ""'The"", 'One', 'part', '2', 'Shaolin', 'fighter', 'movie', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'movie', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'say', 'last', 'want', 'see', 'so', 'badly', 'AND', 'THEY', 'HAVE', 'GOOD', 'REASON']",N/A

Given that UNLEASHED was so phenomenal (the opening fight is by itself worth the price of admission), I was afraid that Jet Li has sapped away all the good stuff he had left to offer in the genre before his grand finale.Boy, was I wrong. FEARLESS is everything a martial arts epic should be. It has all the trademark elements Jet Li has made himself famous for. Playing a real-life Chinese folk-hero (Hou yuan-jia, although Li and director Ronny Yu have taken considerable liberties with the man's story), whose main goal is to defend China's honor against occupying Western powers, while at the same time, promoting a peaceful co-existance between the two.FEARLESS is, in my analysis, what CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON would have been like if Li had accepted Chow yun-fat's role. At 43, he has all the agility, blinding speed, and acrobatic grace he had when entered the genre over 20 years ago. every battle in the film is like watching a live wushu demonstration, and never at any point boring (the fight on top of the 150-ft. platform is especially good.)Jet Li's comments that this will be his final martial arts film appear to have been misinterpreted. He has since clarified that he is now officially retired from WUSHU films and epic films, but that he will continue to make action and kung fu movies (he seems to have made good on that promise, as he has already completed his next kung fu action thriller WAR, with TRANSPORTER star Jason Statham, and is in preparation for a co-production with - yep - Jackie Chan.)So let's accept that this is, as black belt magazine has put it, ""his last ponytail epic"", and I must say that he could not have bowed ought of that genre more graceful.

""Fearless"" is the fictionalized account of Huo Juanjia, the Wushu master who was one of the founders of the Chin Wu Sports Federation in 1910, which promoted the martial arts and its unity throughout the world to this day.The story starts with the Huo as a child with his wanting to learn Wushu from his father the master.  He is not allowed because he has asthma.  The story jumps to years later and now Hua is the master and he is a champion Wushu master.  You realize that even though he is the best, there is something lacking from his life.  Most of the rest of the story is his education to learn what is truly important with the ending climaxing of his learning and his international acclaim.Jet Li does a wonderful job of portraying Huo Jianjia.  Dong Yong plays Huo's lifelong friend and serves as his Jimminy Cricket throughout the movies as his sense of duty and honor.  Betty Sun's character teaches Huo the importance he is missing.  The rest of the cast is wonderfull, but not nearly as important as Jet Li.The action scenes are choreographed by Yeun Wo Ping.  He is the best in the business today and has been for many years.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix Trilogy, Kill Bill Vol I & II and the irreverent Kung Fu Hustle are just of few of his more famous films.  The action scenes are going to be remembered with the best of all time because they are that good.  If you liked ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", you will loves these sequences.  There is not a missed moment the entire movie.  Full of action, yet beautiful to watch.  The fight secens with the three-piece-staff are the stuff of legend.""Fearless"" works on two levels: it is deeply introspective and the action is out of this world.  If you like martial arts films just for the action, you will love this film.  If you like movies for the script and visuals, you will also love this film.  This is one of the best genre films made.  This is certainly Jet LI at his best and should not be missed.  It is truly better than ""Hero"" and I thought that was his best at that time.  Truly stunning.

I had just recently watched the unrated cut on standard not long ago and the Blu Ray/directors cut looked and played out so differently, it was like watching a different movie altogether.It's a shame that 'Fearless' was so overlooked in the theaters and was most likely chalked up to being ""another kung fu movie"". Nothing could be further from the truth. There's a real story here about a real martial arts champion who learns about the downfalls of arrogance, pride and revenge. But he must lose it all in order to understand what's truly important in life, to his father and his country. It's a long, hard road indeed. While it's mostly story, and a good one at that, the fight scenes are excellent as well. They lean towards the fantasy style of kung fu on wires but it's all acceptable if you'll give a little leeway. But it doesn't go nearly as far as others have with flying around and walking on water and such. Otherwise, this is an fine film that'll hold your attention, even the moreso now with the extra 35 min. on the directors cut which fleshes out the story so much more. It allows for more growth of character and context to some scenes that previously had little impact in the other versions. It reminds me of 'Kingdom of Heaven'. I didn't like it very much in it's theatrical cut, but the directors cut made so much more sense of the characters and scenes, that it made it an entirely different movie. I had the same experience here with 'Fearless"" and I'm so glad they decided to release the DC version. It makes a pretty good move into a very good movie.The Blu Ray is also the only way to see it, and I mean ""see"" it. The standard dvd was servicable at best but compared to the Blu Ray, it's pretty bad. There are so many wonderful sets, costumes and scenery to see here that I feel like I'm also looking at a different movie. The detail is excellent and the print is spotlessly clean. The bold colors pop and everything is clearly defined. The difference is night and day. This is the only way to watch this movie.The Blu Ray also offers DTS-HD soundtracks that are also way better than the DD 5.1 tracks on the standard disc. Theres alot more bass from the action and percussion. The quite scenes are loaded with discrete ambient noise and there's never a problem discerning the voices over the sounds and music. One thing of note though, only a Mandarin DTS-HD track can be found on the Directors Cut. Whereas the other cuts offer a Mandarin DTS-HD track as well as English and French dubbed DTS 5.1. I would've liked the DC to include an english track as well but I had no problem reading the subtitles while watching the movie.'Fearless' is a great film and is Jet Li's finest performance by far. The story allows Li to show that he's capable of so much more than just punching and kicking. I can't remember seeing him in anything that was nearly as dramatic and polished as this. The Blu Ray makes what was a good movie before, so much better by offering all 3 cuts in beautiful 1080p with an excellent DTS-HD audio track to accompany each. If you have the previous version, don't hesitate for a second on the upgrade if you can and for the curious, give it a try. It's a very well done film with wonderfully choreographed action scenes by the best in the business, Yuen Wo Ping (Drunken Master, Twin Warriors, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Iron Monkey, Matrix, Kill Bill, etc.) Just don't write it off as kung fu with a story, it's a story with kung fu.

I would easily put in my top 10 favorite films of all time. However, this cut does what seems to be impossible these days - it takes a great film and vastly improves on it. When you watch the extra footage that has been added in, you aren't thinking ""Well, I can see why they left that out..."" The film moves just as quickly as the first film, however as a previous poster states, the film feels much more epic. You get a greater sense of the main characters reasoning, and what drives him to act the way he does. You also get a greater sense of his redemption by the film's end.Also, it seems to me that since the director's cut is unrated, you get a few more broken bone and blood spitting scenes that were cut from the theatrical release to ensure a PG-13 rating. This can be a good or bad thing, depending on your taste in violence in Wushu flicks. Personally, I thought it fit well with the character's hubris during that part of the film.Finally, this being an Olympic Year, and with the games being held in Beijing, the scenes with Michelle Yeoh hit home just a little bit harder than they would in any other year. With China wanting to show its best side for these games, this movie shows one of the many reasons why this is the case.

1030468,A3N7HHBZNUJ6D6,B000K2UW06,R. Hedges,"[0, 0]","First, as is seen from the box, you get all three versions that were released.  I never saw the film in the theater, but I had read that the one to watch was the director's cut.  I actually rented the film, but it was SO good I just had to get it anyway (bought it used).  A short video of how the film was made is the only extra on the disk though.  Actually, I wanted to mention there is this cool quasi-screensaver that just has the ""Universal"" studio logo if you pause the film and walk away from your blu ray player for a while.  I watched the ""directors cut"" first, then looked at the original theatrical release-it's amazing how much of the original film was gutted, so it's easy to understand why fans are angry about the original release.Assuming you watch the director's cut, the time line and events flow nicely with Huo Yuan Jia, and this is not just a kung fu film.  I really enjoyed the range of acting that Jet Li did-he clearly is positioning himself as something other than doing just pure action films for the future.  Granted, he's in his mid-40's and is, like Jackie Chan, getting into the twilight years of what he is originally known for-kung fu.  As Huo Yuan Jia, Jet Li did an excellent job of showing someone who was basically obsessed with fighting and to beat opponents at any cost, personal or otherwise.  After he casts himself out of his village upon murdering his rival, he is basically reborn and learns that not always fighting is part of Wushu, which ultimately completes his training.  He then returns to his village, starts the Wushu organization and fights various challengers from foreign countries in order to help get his Wushu organization off the ground.I don't want to give away too many special items, but Yuen Woo Ping's ""wire-fu"" is obvious, but it looks good when used.

However, I always felt that the version I saw was missing something.  It seemed as if it couldn't decide what genre it wanted to belong to.Then I saw the director's cut on blu-ray.  It was a double whammy!  The movie as told in this version is a tale of a man who must come to terms with an unspeakable tragedy.  How he overcomes his own trials and becomes a hero to a nation.  What it is not is a ""Wi-fu"" flick.  In fact the kung fu seems to serve only one purpose:  To show the viewer the difference in fighting for selfish ends and fighting for a more noble purpose.The picture and sound are noticeably better than the DVD release, but the greatest treasure is the story itself.  You understand his motives, his grief.  If you go in thinking Unleashed or Fists of Fury or even Crouching Tiger (not that he's in the last), you'll be disappointed.My wife typically does not watch ""kung fu"" movies, but she sat through it.  She even asked that I pause it when she needed to get up.  A sure sign she's hooked.The only gripe, was the very beginning with Michelle Yeoh.

At 141 minutes, it fleshes out the story more, makes some points more clear, and includes several more minutes of martial arts action, most notably a scene where the hero battles a Thai fighter.  A subplot featuring Michelle Yeoh is restored.The upcoming release isn't a special edition, and there won't be many special features.  The two-disc set will include the Director's Cut, the PG-13 US theatrical cut (103 minutes), and the only slightly different unrated US version (104 minutes), both previously available on DVD.  The special features are similar to those on the current unrated DVD, the featurette ""A Fearless Journey"" (16:04) and some cut scenes (reportedly more than one--there was only one deleted scene on the previous Region 1 releases).It will be in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen, with English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Mandarin Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and optional English subtitles.Fearless is the highly fictionalized story of the real-life Huo Yuanjia (or Yuan Jia), a hero of Chinese martial arts who died almost a century ago.  The son of a wise martial arts champion who refuses to teach him, Huo teaches himself by, among other things, watching his father train.  Lacking his father's humility, he is a most skilled fighter but commits shameful acts that, when he finally sees their devastating consequences and recognizes his failings, drive him to become an aimless wanderer.  Through the kindness of humble people he recovers and eventually redeems himself in several dramatic ways.This is a high-budget, beautifully produced martial arts film that will be enjoyed by more than the usual martial arts fan.  Though it doesn't have quite the same pretensions, those who enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Hero and don't mind a fair amount of violence will probably also enjoy this.If you don't have Fearless on DVD yet and can wait until July, you'll probably want to get the Director's Cut, especially since the shorter US cuts are also included.No Blu-ray edition has been announced, but it will undoubtedly arrive eventually.The Amazon page to pre-order the Region 1 Director's Cut ishere.",5,"The Director's Cut is coming to Region 1 on July 8th, 2008!",1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,2307,"['Director', 'Cut', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Fearless', '37', 'minutes', 'longer', 'generally', 'regarded', 'definitive', 'version', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'official', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', '141', 'minutes', 'out', 'story', 'more', 'points', 'more', 'clear', 'several', 'more', 'minutes', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'most', 'notably', 'scene', 'where', 'hero', 'Thai', 'fighter', 'subplot', 'featuring', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'restored.The', 'upcoming', 'release', ""n't"", 'special', 'edition', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'many', 'special', 'features', 'two-disc', 'set', 'will', 'include', 'Director', 'Cut', 'PG-13', 'US', 'theatrical', 'cut', '103', 'minutes', 'only', 'slightly', 'different', 'unrated', 'US', 'version', '104', 'minutes', 'previously', 'available', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'similar', 'current', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'A', 'Fearless', 'Journey', '16:04', 'cut', 'scenes', 'reportedly', 'more', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'previous', 'Region', '1', 'releases', '.It', 'will', 'be', '2.40:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Mandarin', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles.Fearless', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'story', 'real-life', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'hero', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'who', 'died', 'almost', 'century', 'ago', 'son', 'wise', 'martial', 'arts', 'champion', 'who', 'teach', 'Huo', 'other', 'things', 'watching', 'father', 'train', 'Lacking', 'father', 'humility', 'most', 'skilled', 'fighter', 'commits', 'shameful', 'acts', 'when', 'finally', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'recognizes', 'failings', 'drive', 'become', 'aimless', 'wanderer', 'kindness', 'humble', 'people', 'eventually', 'several', 'dramatic', 'ways.This', 'high-budget', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'usual', 'martial', 'arts', 'fan', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'pretensions', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Hero', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fair', 'amount', 'violence', 'will', 'probably', 'also', 'enjoy', 'this.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Fearless', 'DVD', 'yet', 'can', 'wait', 'July', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'get', 'Director', 'Cut', 'especially', 'shorter', 'US', 'cuts', 'are', 'also', 'included.No', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'been', 'announced', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'arrive', 'eventually.The', 'Amazon', 'page', 'pre-order', 'Region', '1', 'Director', 'Cut', 'ishere']",N/A

It was not until after watching it, when reviewing my copy of Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection, that I realized that Jet Li's Fearless is actually the prequel to Chinese Connection. Remember in the beginning of Chinese Connection, when they're talking about their master dying from poison? Well this movie shows you what happened to their master as he grew up and learned to be one of the greatest fighters in the world.I have seen over a hundred ""kung fu"" movies. Most of them were ""B"" movies at best, but I watched them because of the fascinating martial arts battles which took place in them.Jet Li's Fearless is by far the greatest martial arts film I have ever seen. The story, screenplay, fight coreography, acting and action are all top of the line.The fight scenes demonstrate a realism which pays great attention to detail and the authenticity of actual martial arts styles and limitations. They depict characters dishing out and taking a lot of punishment, which was characteristic of practitioners of the Iron Fist, Iron Palm and Iron Body disciplines of Kung Fu.Taking place in colonial China, it is the true story of a man who stands up for his country against an oppressive regime which is bent upon their humiliation and dehumanization. After defeating a champion British boxer in a boxing ring using amazing Kung Fu techniques, the main character, played by Jet Li, is challenged to partake in a special tournament. Within this tournament, he must defeat four of the world's greatest fighters. They include both masters of weapons and bare handed fighting techniques. Let's just say that the battles between them are epic and amazingly done.If you enjoy martial arts films, this is a must see. If you know someone who likes them, this movie will not disapoint them. Buy it today, you won't regret it.

And by ""greatest,"" I mean that director Ronny Yu and the stunning martial arts spectacle Jet Li have teamed up to create one of the most powerful, mind blowing, and action-packed movies of 2006. Based on a true story, the movie is told in flashbacks (which is my favorite type of movie!) about a young boy who even at his young age stands up to defend his father's Wushu (a type of martial arts) clan in late 19th century China. As the movie progresses, Huo Yuanjia grows to become a practitioner of Wushu himself and becomes one of the greatest fighters China has ever seen. The film is spectacular: anyone who has seen Jet Li star in a martial arts epic knows how absolutely stunning the cinematography is. In that area, Fearless does anything but disappoint, creating some of the most mind blowing fight scenes I've ever seen. What I didn't expect this movie to have was it's power factor: you will find yourself almost disturbed in scenes because of the emotional punch it packs inside. Plus, the Unrated version has plenty of ""R-Rated"" style violence and gore to satisfy hardcore blood addicts. The absolute only reason this film didn't get a solid golden 5-Stars from me is because it mostly lacked something that is absolutely essential in a martial arts epic like this, and that is the scenery. I was expecting to see the type of gorgeous and beyond beautiful landscapes and colors and backgrounds like I saw in Jet Li's other film ""Hero."" The village scenes in Fearless had somewhat of this, but where were all the colors? That said, if Fearless had the type of scenery Hero did, it would've easily won my 5-Stars. So definitely, next time you're at Blockbuster, pick up a copy of Fearless and bring it home with you. Make sure to switch the language to Mandarin and turn on the English subtitles to experience the way this movie was meant to be.

FEARLESS proves me wrong, and is quite possibly the best film of Jet's career.First of all, Jet's acting in Mandarin is a revelation... he's excellent, and the character fits him to a tee. He gets to show a much wider range of emotions than he's been able to in the past (certainly in his Hollywood films), and carries them all off with class. Better than he's ever been, by a wide margin.Then the production values and the cinematography of the film are A++ - really beautiful, with scenes that approach the sheer aesthetic beauty of HERO... but without coming across so self-indulgent :p Great soundtrack too.And the fight scenes... wow! The choreography is superlative (though Yuen Wo Ping gets caught out reusing ideas on occasion these days). The fights are mostly very intricate, complex and sophisticated, with a wide variety of styles being used as well. There are some really long takes, and Jet is as fast, agile and powerful as he's ever been - at least since the SHAOLIN TEMPLE films. The way they are filmed shows that it's possible to use ""modern"" camera work and editing (and even a dash of CGI) without rendering the action incoherenent or destroying the flow and impact. It's been a long while since we've seen fights this well choreographed, filmed and performed.The story of Huo Yuan Jia's quest to become the number one fighter, and his self-discovery and enlightenment as to the ""true"" nature of martial arts, is simple but nicely handled. It continues the progression towards maturity, wisdom and compassion that flows from FIST OF FURY through FIST OF LEGEND (to which FEARLESS is essentially a prequel). I think FEARLESS reflects a lot more of Jet Li's personal views and philosophy than any of his previous works have done - this is apparently the reason why he has said this will be his last period martial arts film, because it says all he has to say through that particular medium. It's a shame, and I hope he changes his mind, because FEARLESS is a triumphant return for Jet Li, and it's hard to imagine him being happy to make more rubbish like CRADLE2THEGRAVE after something like this!It's also a triumphant return for Ronny Yu, who has also been stuck making Hollywood dross for far too many years. He must have learnt something along the way, or perhaps just stored up all his energy and ideas to unleash in FEARLESS. This is his best work too, in my opinion - or at least equal with BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR. Even cinematographer Poon Hang-Sang can count this amongst his best work.Basically there is no aspect of FEARLESS to which I would give less than full marks - it's something I didn't expect to see the likes of again - i.e. one of the best martial arts films ever made :)",5,One of the best kung fu films ever made,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,2840,"['honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Jet', 'Li', 'had', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'FIST', 'OF', 'LEGEND', 'again', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'even', 'better', 'FEARLESS', 'wrong', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'film', 'Jet', 'career.First', 'Jet', 'acting', 'Mandarin', 'revelation', 'excellent', 'character', 'tee', 'show', 'much', 'wider', 'range', 'emotions', 'been', 'able', 'past', 'certainly', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'off', 'class', 'Better', 'ever', 'been', 'wide', 'margin.Then', 'production', 'values', 'cinematography', 'film', 'are', 'A++', 'really', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'approach', 'sheer', 'aesthetic', 'beauty', 'HERO', 'coming', 'so', 'self-indulgent', 'p', 'Great', 'soundtrack', 'too.And', 'fight', 'scenes', 'wow', 'choreography', 'superlative', 'Yuen', 'Wo', 'Ping', 'caught', 'out', 'reusing', 'ideas', 'occasion', 'days', 'fights', 'are', 'mostly', 'very', 'intricate', 'complex', 'sophisticated', 'wide', 'variety', 'styles', 'being', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'really', 'long', 'Jet', 'fast', 'agile', 'powerful', 'ever', 'been', 'least', 'SHAOLIN', 'TEMPLE', 'films', 'way', 'are', 'filmed', 'shows', 'possible', 'use', 'modern', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'even', 'dash', 'CGI', 'rendering', 'action', 'incoherenent', 'destroying', 'flow', 'impact', 'been', 'long', 'while', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fights', 'well', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'performed.The', 'story', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'quest', 'become', 'number', 'one', 'fighter', 'self-discovery', 'enlightenment', 'true', 'nature', 'martial', 'arts', 'simple', 'nicely', 'handled', 'progression', 'towards', 'maturity', 'wisdom', 'compassion', 'FIST', 'OF', 'FURY', 'FIST', 'OF', 'LEGEND', 'FEARLESS', 'essentially', 'prequel', 'think', 'FEARLESS', 'lot', 'more', 'Jet', 'Li', 'personal', 'views', 'philosophy', 'previous', 'works', 'have', 'done', 'apparently', 'reason', 'why', 'said', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'period', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'all', 'say', 'particular', 'medium', 'shame', 'hope', 'mind', 'FEARLESS', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Jet', 'Li', 'hard', 'imagine', 'being', 'happy', 'make', 'more', 'rubbish', 'CRADLE2THEGRAVE', 'something', 'also', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Ronny', 'Yu', 'who', 'also', 'been', 'stuck', 'making', 'Hollywood', 'dross', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'must', 'have', 'learnt', 'something', 'way', 'perhaps', 'just', 'stored', 'up', 'energy', 'ideas', 'unleash', 'FEARLESS', 'best', 'work', 'too', 'opinion', 'least', 'equal', 'BRIDE', 'WITH', 'WHITE', 'HAIR', 'Even', 'cinematographer', 'Poon', 'Hang-Sang', 'can', 'count', 'best', 'work.Basically', 'aspect', 'FEARLESS', 'would', 'give', 'less', 'full', 'marks', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'likes', 'again', 'i.e', 'one', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'ever', 'made']",N/A
1030484,A1DV6NTPQRWZE3,B000K2UW06,thepete8,"[2, 2]","...and I don't mean just favorite martial arts pic either. Also, please note that I'm writing about the full Director's Cut; I've never seen the other versions. And I had no problem with bad disks, so that issue's probably been taken care of by the manufacturer.Briefly, 'Fearless' is about the son of a Wushu master (Jet Li) who becomes a famous master himself. However, he's a shallow man and his interest in wushu is based solely on arrogance. This leads to his downfall just as he achieves the pinnacle of success. With his life destroyed and only an empty shell of a person, he wanders aimlessly and almost dies until he slowly discovers the spirit that is supposed to go along with martial arts. He rebuilds himself, without any of the pat 'moments of truth' you'd find in most movies. As he finds a real sense of self and purpose, he returns home to reclaim his life and make amends.'Fearless' doesn't scrimp on fight scenes, yet it also tells a very deep and moving story. Ronny Yu makes the film so epic and yet it is so simple, almost like an ancient parable you'd read about some Zen master. Much of the reason the movie is so powerful is that the script allows the story to unfold rather than letting dialogue tell us what to think. Also, importantly, Li does a fantastic job conveying the various stages of his character's journey through expressions, delivery, and body language. You can realy tell the difference in the character from the beginning of the movie to the end. As far as I'm concerned, that's what great acting is all about.The Director's Cut makes this a long movie, but I never felt at any time that 'Fearless' had unnecessary scenes or dragged. If anything, I think the shorter versions must be lacking key scenes or subplots whose absence would lessen this very rich movie. As a result, I would not be at all interested in seeing the shorter versions. Some of the other reviews here seem to confirm my suspicion.'Fearless' speaks to me in so many different ways: the importance of friendship, the importance of wisdom versus knowledge, what real success is all about, and what it is to be a man. For those reasons, as well as the sheer beauty of the film, the great story, and the terrific fight scenes, this is my favorite movie of all time.",5,My favorite movie...,1241913600,"05 10, 2009",2009,2274,"['do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'just', 'favorite', 'martial', 'arts', 'pic', 'Also', 'please', 'note', ""'m"", 'writing', 'full', 'Director', 'Cut', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'had', 'problem', 'bad', 'disks', 'issue', 'probably', 'been', 'taken', 'care', 'manufacturer.Briefly', 'son', 'Wushu', 'master', 'Jet', 'Li', 'who', 'famous', 'master', 'However', 'shallow', 'man', 'interest', 'wushu', 'based', 'solely', 'arrogance', 'downfall', 'just', 'pinnacle', 'success', 'life', 'destroyed', 'only', 'empty', 'shell', 'person', 'aimlessly', 'almost', 'dies', 'spirit', 'supposed', 'go', 'along', 'martial', 'arts', 'pat', ""'moments"", 'truth', ""'d"", 'find', 'most', 'movies', 'real', 'sense', 'self', 'purpose', 'home', 'reclaim', 'life', 'make', 'amends', ""n't"", 'scrimp', 'fight', 'scenes', 'also', 'very', 'deep', 'moving', 'story', 'Ronny', 'Yu', 'film', 'so', 'epic', 'yet', 'so', 'simple', 'almost', 'ancient', 'parable', ""'d"", 'read', 'Zen', 'master', 'Much', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'script', 'story', 'unfold', 'rather', 'letting', 'dialogue', 'tell', 'think', 'Also', 'importantly', 'Li', 'fantastic', 'job', 'conveying', 'various', 'stages', 'character', 'journey', 'expressions', 'delivery', 'body', 'language', 'can', 'realy', 'tell', 'difference', 'character', 'beginning', 'movie', 'end', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'what', 'great', 'acting', 'about.The', 'Director', 'Cut', 'long', 'movie', 'never', 'felt', 'time', ""'Fearless"", 'had', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'dragged', 'anything', 'think', 'shorter', 'versions', 'must', 'be', 'lacking', 'key', 'scenes', 'subplots', 'absence', 'would', 'lessen', 'very', 'rich', 'movie', 'result', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'shorter', 'versions', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'seem', 'confirm', 'suspicion', 'speaks', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'importance', 'friendship', 'importance', 'wisdom', 'versus', 'knowledge', 'what', 'real', 'success', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'reasons', 'as', 'well', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'terrific', 'fight', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time']",N/A
1030485,A1X6M6IINHDSRC,B000K2UW06,Thor,"[4, 5]","Okay, lets get one thing straight first: this is not Jet Li's last Martial arts epic. The trailers were wrong about that and confused alot of people. This is Jet Li's last period Wu Shu film. As many already know, Li is currently working with Jackie Chan on the film the Forbidden Kingdom, in which it is already a fact that they will fight together.So, now that we have that straightend out, let me tell you my opinion about Fearless.Jet Li plays Huo Yuanjia, a Chinese Martial Arts Master who is the founder of the Jin Wu Sports Federation and who fought at a tournament to protect the Chinese honour. The way he portrays this interesting character is very energetic and lively. Not just in the fighting, but also in the dialouge scenes. At first it seems a bit unrealistic, but I got used to this style of acting very quickly and only found it very watchable and nice to see. Li shows that Huo Yuanjia was also a normal human being who enjoyed life and had certain issues and does this well.The film starts very energeticly and shows you one fight after the other, with only some short breaks in between. The movie goes on like this for the whole first hour, which gives alot of excitement and gets the adrenaline pumping for sure for Martial arts and action fans. Then after a dramatic switch in the story, the character leaves his world to the countryside were he stays for a long time. This time is about twenty minutes in the movie were there is no fighting at all. I found this a beautiful and peaceful contrast with the first part of the movie and liked this silence moment. Still, alot of other people don't like this ""break"". It takes away the tempo of the film for that moment, at what I agree, but definitely returns to a stunning final. Either you like this break, like I did, or you find it slow and boring. But I assure you that the scenery is absolutely wonderful in this quiet moment in a storm.Looking at the sets and atmosphere of the film I can only come to one conclusion: the sets are magnificent and even though you can sometimes see that the computer effects have helped here and there a bit, it gives the film a stunning look. And the scenes that take place on the countryside gives the film a beautiful and almost spiritual atmosphere. The sets are large and beautifully made and they help you to get into the story and feel the atmosphere.Looking at the action, the film is definitely strong as it gives, like some critics said, ""bonecrushing action!"" It is fastpaced, well shot and shows Li at his best. The only little thing I didn't like at the fights is that even though the editing is fantastic, that at some shots they cut away a single shot out of a movement. This give the movement a certain look. For example, someone falls down to the ground. One second you see him flying through the air, the next second you see him on the ground (still in the same camera-angle), and a part of his falling down has been cut out. Their are only a few small ones of those editing moments, and they overall don't bother you, so don't worry: The fighting is magnificent.So an energetic and powerful Jet Li in a stunning motion picture that is a must see for martial arts and Jet Li fans. But also for people who want their adrenaline pumping and for who wants to sit on the edge of their seats.",4,A Stunning Martial Arts Film that gets the Adrenaline Pumping!,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,3314,"['Okay', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'straight', 'first', 'not', 'Jet', 'Li', 'last', 'Martial', 'arts', 'epic', 'trailers', 'were', 'wrong', 'confused', 'alot', 'people', 'Jet', 'Li', 'last', 'period', 'Wu', 'Shu', 'film', 'many', 'already', 'know', 'Li', 'currently', 'working', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'Forbidden', 'Kingdom', 'already', 'fact', 'will', 'fight', 'together.So', 'now', 'have', 'straightend', 'out', 'let', 'tell', 'opinion', 'Fearless.Jet', 'Li', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'Chinese', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'Master', 'who', 'founder', 'Jin', 'Wu', 'Sports', 'Federation', 'who', 'fought', 'tournament', 'protect', 'Chinese', 'honour', 'way', 'interesting', 'character', 'very', 'energetic', 'lively', 'Not', 'just', 'fighting', 'also', 'dialouge', 'scenes', 'first', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'got', 'used', 'style', 'acting', 'very', 'quickly', 'only', 'found', 'very', 'watchable', 'nice', 'see', 'Li', 'Huo', 'Yuanjia', 'was', 'also', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'had', 'certain', 'issues', 'well.The', 'film', 'very', 'energeticly', 'one', 'fight', 'other', 'only', 'short', 'breaks', 'movie', 'whole', 'first', 'hour', 'alot', 'excitement', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'sure', 'Martial', 'arts', 'action', 'fans', 'Then', 'dramatic', 'switch', 'story', 'character', 'world', 'countryside', 'were', 'long', 'time', 'time', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'were', 'fighting', 'found', 'beautiful', 'peaceful', 'contrast', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'liked', 'silence', 'moment', 'Still', 'alot', 'other', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'break', 'away', 'tempo', 'film', 'moment', 'what', 'agree', 'definitely', 'stunning', 'final', 'break', 'did', 'find', 'slow', 'boring', 'assure', 'scenery', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'quiet', 'moment', 'storm.Looking', 'sets', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'one', 'conclusion', 'sets', 'are', 'magnificent', 'even', 'can', 'sometimes', 'see', 'computer', 'effects', 'have', 'helped', 'here', 'there', 'bit', 'film', 'stunning', 'look', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'countryside', 'film', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'spiritual', 'atmosphere', 'sets', 'are', 'large', 'beautifully', 'made', 'help', 'get', 'story', 'feel', 'atmosphere.Looking', 'action', 'film', 'definitely', 'strong', 'critics', 'said', 'bonecrushing', 'action', 'fastpaced', 'well', 'shot', 'Li', 'best', 'only', 'little', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fights', 'even', 'editing', 'fantastic', 'shots', 'cut', 'away', 'single', 'shot', 'movement', 'give', 'movement', 'certain', 'look', 'example', 'someone', 'down', 'ground', 'One', 'second', 'see', 'flying', 'air', 'next', 'second', 'see', 'ground', 'still', 'same', 'camera-angle', 'part', 'falling', 'down', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'small', 'ones', 'editing', 'moments', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'fighting', 'energetic', 'powerful', 'Jet', 'Li', 'stunning', 'motion', 'picture', 'must', 'see', 'martial', 'arts', 'Jet', 'Li', 'fans', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'who', 'sit', 'edge', 'seats']",N/A

After an ill-advised fight leads to another master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium over a period of several years.

Jet Li plays this legendary figure, whose martial arts style and fearless fight helped the people in China regain their pride in the early 20th century when China was intimidated and humiliated by the growing Western and Japanese powers.Well, so much for the history. Now, let's talk about actions. In `Fearless' Jet Li has shown his best performance since the days he did `Once Upon A Time In China' playing the role of Wong Fei Hung, another legendary hero in China, and the fight scenes (choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping) are all fantastic, sometimes visceral, and sometimes graceful, and always powerful. Good and smooth editing and gorgeous production designs also help greatly to create the background.[JET LI'S PHILOSOPHY] After the opening martial arts competition sequences in Shanghai, 1910, the film begins to follow the life of Huo Yuan Jia from the days he was a boy in a flashback section. Jet Li and director Ronny Yu (yes, the guy who did `Bride of Chucky' and `Freddy vs. Jason') made a wise decision in showing Collin Chou as Father of young Huo Yuan Jia because the image of charismatic Chou (previously seen in two `Matrix' sequels as body guard Seraph) as the stern father who forbids his son to fight well-represents Li's philosophy about martial arts.Yes, `Fearless' is a first-rate martial arts action film, but the film is more than that. The film, which was released under the title of `Spirit' in Japan, has Li's message about martial arts, which impresses without being obtrusive.Besides splendid Collin Chou, the film has assembled interesting names from in and outside of Asia: Nathan Jones as `Hercules' one of Huo Yuan Jia's opponents: Anthony De Longis as Spanish fighter: Brandon Rhea as German fighter: Masato Harada (seen in `The Last Samurai') as Mr. Mita. Debuting actress Sun Li (Betty Li) is impressive as a blind girl, and so is Dong Yong who steals the show as Huo Yuan Jia's old friend. But probably to the Western viewers the real find is the Japanese rising star Shidou Nakamura as Anno Tanaka samurai fighter. Nakamura, who will be seen Clint Eastwood's `Red Sun, Black Sand,' is already known as a talented actor in Japan, and he shows it with the brilliant fight scenes.But the film is of course a Jet Li film, with the genuine actions that no one but he can do, and Li also succeeds in bringing life and dignity into the character of Huo Yuan Jia. As you know, it is said that `Fearless' will be the last martial arts film for Jet Li. I don't know if it is really true, but I know this is his best film in years.",5,Martial Arts Action with Soul: Jet Li's Best in Years,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2770,"['[', 'following', 'review', 'refers', '104', 'minute', 'version', 'Fearless', 'released', 'Japan', 'March', '2006', 'starring', 'Jet', 'Li', ']', 'Fearless', 'inspired', 'life', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'real-life', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'Jet', 'Li', 'legendary', 'figure', 'martial', 'arts', 'style', 'fearless', 'fight', 'helped', 'people', 'China', 'regain', 'pride', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'when', 'China', 'was', 'intimidated', 'humiliated', 'growing', 'Western', 'Japanese', 'powers.Well', 'so', 'much', 'history', 'Now', 'let', 'talk', 'actions', 'Fearless', 'Jet', 'Li', 'shown', 'best', 'performance', 'days', 'did', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'China', 'playing', 'role', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'legendary', 'hero', 'China', 'fight', 'scenes', 'choreographed', 'Yuen', 'Woo', 'Ping', 'are', 'fantastic', 'sometimes', 'visceral', 'sometimes', 'graceful', 'always', 'powerful', 'Good', 'smooth', 'editing', 'gorgeous', 'production', 'designs', 'also', 'help', 'greatly', 'create', 'background', 'JET', 'LI', 'PHILOSOPHY', ']', 'opening', 'martial', 'arts', 'competition', 'sequences', 'Shanghai', '1910', 'film', 'follow', 'life', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'days', 'was', 'boy', 'flashback', 'section', 'Jet', 'Li', 'director', 'Ronny', 'Yu', 'yes', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'Bride', 'Chucky', 'Freddy', 'vs.', 'Jason', 'made', 'wise', 'decision', 'showing', 'Collin', 'Chou', 'Father', 'young', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'image', 'charismatic', 'Chou', 'previously', 'seen', 'two', 'Matrix', 'sequels', 'body', 'guard', 'Seraph', 'stern', 'father', 'who', 'son', 'fight', 'well-represents', 'Li', 'philosophy', 'martial', 'arts.Yes', 'Fearless', 'first-rate', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'film', 'film', 'more', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'title', 'Spirit', 'Japan', 'Li', 'message', 'martial', 'arts', 'being', 'obtrusive.Besides', 'splendid', 'Collin', 'Chou', 'film', 'assembled', 'interesting', 'names', 'Asia', 'Nathan', 'Jones', 'Hercules', 'one', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'opponents', 'Anthony', 'De', 'Longis', 'Spanish', 'fighter', 'Brandon', 'Rhea', 'German', 'fighter', 'Masato', 'Harada', 'seen', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Mr.', 'Mita', 'Debuting', 'actress', 'Sun', 'Li', 'Betty', 'Li', 'impressive', 'blind', 'girl', 'so', 'Dong', 'Yong', 'who', 'show', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'old', 'friend', 'probably', 'Western', 'viewers', 'real', 'find', 'Japanese', 'rising', 'star', 'Shidou', 'Nakamura', 'Anno', 'Tanaka', 'samurai', 'fighter', 'Nakamura', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Red', 'Sun', 'Black', 'Sand', 'already', 'known', 'talented', 'actor', 'Japan', 'brilliant', 'fight', 'scenes.But', 'film', 'course', 'Jet', 'Li', 'film', 'genuine', 'actions', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'Li', 'also', 'bringing', 'life', 'dignity', 'character', 'Huo', 'Yuan', 'Jia', 'know', 'said', 'Fearless', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'Jet', 'Li', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'true', 'know', 'best', 'film', 'years']",N/A

1030493,A38TC59GM2WW1X,B000K2UW06,"Victor Chen ""Messerschmitts""","[1, 1]","When this film came out, it was advertised and billed as Jet Li's ""final martial arts epic"".  As a Jet Li fan, this both exhilirated and saddened me of course.  I am happy to say that Jet Li definitely goes out with a bang and did not disappoint this fan.  This film certainly satisfied me gave me closure on a remarkable actor's career.""Fearless"", or ""Huo Yuanjia"" in Chinese tells the story of the eponomynous martial arts master.  Although Huo was a real person and this film is widely criticised for being wildly historically inaccurate, I'm of the opinion that films are primarily made to entertain and I aim only to judge a film on the merits of its entertainment value.  By that metric, I was wildly entertained.  If you want a history lesson, go read a biography of Huo Yuanjia.I will attempt to be vague to not ruin the story.  However, the core of the story told in three acts, and follows roughly the rise, fall, and rebirth of the main character as a martial arts master.  Huo in the first act is arrogant, ill-tempered, vengeful, and always has a chip on his shoulder.  Tragedy strikes as a result of his arrogance, and in the 2nd act he is forced rediscover who he is and find redemption.  The 3rd act deals with his rebirth and legacy.  Although martial arts movies about tragedy and redemption are a dime a dozen (particularly if you go to Hong Kong), ""Fearless"" somehow makes it feel fresh and powerful again, and Huo/Jet's character's arc is handled with much skill.The cinematography of the film is absolutely gorgeous.  The film looks STUNNING on Blu-ray and is definitely blu-ray worthy, one of the best-looking high-def films in my library.  My guests were very impressed with the picture and sound quality on my Samsung home theater setup.  Fearless also has some of the most spectacular and gorgeous fight-scenes this side of Ip Man.  The crowning glory of the entire film is perhaps the epic fight between Huo Yuanjia and Master Qin in the restaurant/bar.  The only word I could think of that does justice in describing the fight is ""apocalyptic"".The final part of the movie that completes the character's development was especially beautiful, deep, and poignant, and I actually didn't understand it the first time.  (SPOILER:  When dueling the Japanese master Tanaka, Huo/Jet uses the same move that he used earlier to kill master Qin, and you see clearly that Huo's fist gets through Tanaka's defences.  However, unlike in the fight with master Qin, he pulls back and does NOT deliver the death blow.  Jet Li looks into Tanaka's eyes and lets him know that ""I got you, I could have given the death blow, but I choose to pull back.  That is the true meaning of being a master, knowing restraint"".  Thus Tanaka admits defeat even as Huo falls to the ground poisoned).The only thing I did NOT like about the movie (and the reason I would give it only 4.5 stars if Amazon did half-stars) is that in the extended director's cut edition, the 2nd act really is too long now, and really weighed the movie.  I felt that it dragged on and sacrificed too much pacing in favour of fleshing out character development, and I found myself mildly bored during the middle of the film.

It's a real shame that many Americans, even hardcore Jet Li fans, may never see this film the way it was intended to be seen.Not only has the fight against the Thai boxer, and Michelle Yeoh's bookend scenes as a Chinese diplomat trying to sell the International Olympic Committee on including wu shu in the Olympics been restored, but lots of incidental footage that wasn't in the U.S. theatrical cut, and adds.  Combined with the original score that works much better, esp. in the fight scenes where the sound cues interact better with high points in the action, and you have a much, much better movie experience here.In fact, now that the original whole has been restored, I am sure people will see the film for what it is, less a kung fu movie (despite the convention/cliche-laden plot) and the biopic it was meant to be.  In that it's closer to Spike Lee's ""X', than memorable, but thematically relatively lightweight productions like ""Fist of Legend"" (which could function as a kind of sequel to this film) or any of Jet Li's collaborations with Tsui Hark, ""Swordsman II"", and the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" movies.Burn your DVD copies of the North American release and get this instead.  And make a spectacle out of it.  The distributers of martial arts films in this country have got to learn not to tamper with Asian films.

1030497,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000K2UW06,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[15, 16]","FEARLESS is one of the BEST Kung Fu films I've seen in a long time. The film is based on the real-life tale of the legendary Huo Yuan Jia, founder of the Jin Wu Martial Arts Federation. Up to this day, is still considered to be one of best established Kung Fu schools. ""Fearless"" is among Jet Li's best; right up there with his most memorable roles as Wong Fei Hung and Fong Sai Yuk. Some may say that ""Fearless"" is a prequel (of sorts) to Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" (aka. Chinese Connection) and Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"", where the two renowned stars play Huo's greatest student.The story may be a bit simple, but delivers a strong message NOT to be ignored. It explores the consequences of revenge and the sin of hubris. Arrogance is a strong taint in one's soul and vengeance darkens it. The message is that tolerance and understanding is the way of a TRUE master, humility his tool and above all, honor is the true goal. Huo learned quite a lot in his experiences, and what is more important is that he learned from his mistakes.The theatrical cut of ""Fearless"" was very good, but it did suffer a bit in pacing. Now, with this Director's cut, we see why. The theatrical release was edited in a way that action films were cut, now, re-cut and re-edited; Fearless is better than ever. It now feels more of a dramatization and re-edited in a way a TRUE Martial Arts Epic should be...There are major differences in the director's cut, with 40 minutes more footage. This version is even better than the recent unrated version. It includes the opening sequence with Michelle Yeoh and while the previous release started in the middle of the action, this cut begins the story with Huo in a boat. I will outline the scenes because I can still remember (I saw this version in 2006) since this film gave me such impact with its message and emotional action sequences.1. Opening sequence with Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese diplomat, in the bid to consider Wu Shu in the Olympics.2. This cut shows more of Huo's childhood. From his determination to study Wu Shu that he stole his father's notebooks that leads up to his second encounter with the boy who had beaten him after Huo's father was beaten in a match. Huo also has a rematch with the same boy before he fought him again as an adult.3. Huo's arrogance is explored, he is often in a disagreement with his best friend.4. After he had fled the town and found by farmers. There are additional scenes where he mends. He learns more of the farmers' lifestyle and becomes puzzled how these simple people can be so gentle and humble in their ways. He admires how they care for an old ailing bull. Huo's blossoming relationship with the blind girl is more explored.5. Now, this is the keeper; this scene was included in the theatrical release in Thailand. Huo defends the honor of a child who is accused of stealing an animal, he offers himself for punishment while an ""incense"" still burns. He engages a Muay Thai fighter in combat but instead of fighting back, he only defends himself and ends up saving his opponent's life.Now, for the question; is the director's cut worth owning? A RESOUNDING YES...in spades!! Jet Li is in his absolute best in this film. Not only do we see him in excellent fights (choreographed by the legendary Yuen Woo-Ping), in this cut we also see his skills as an actor. The renowned action star can indeed perform in a very emotion-driven role. The extra 40 minutes of footage is worth every penny that this release even outshines the previous unrated release.Jet Li claims that this will be his last WU SHU film. ( I hope not). Li has won Best Actor in the recent Hong Kong film awards for his role in the historical epic; ""The Warlords"".  Director Ronny Yu has definitely redeemed himself with ""Fearless"" after his abysmal ""Bride of Chucky"". (Freddy vs. Jason, anyone?)HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! [5- stars]VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.40 Anamorphic Widescreen. The picture is flawless, strong blacks, radiant colors and nary a speck of dirt or compression artifacts are visible. It has not been clarified if this region-1 release will carry the awesome 6.1 DTS Mandarin Language track.It is expected to also carry the unrated Theatrical release.Note: Parts of this review was originally posted under the region-3 release.",5,"The Director's Cut arrives to U.S. DVD; Re-cut, Re-Edited and Restored to All its Glory!

FEARLESS is a powerful moving epic and features Jet Li's finest performance as an actor. Not only does this disc include the theatrical and unrated versions but it also includes the director's cut. This film may have put some people off at time of release but the new director's cut is how I believe this film was meant to be seen. This director's cut is pretty much a different film and provides a lot more detail and has a much better flow to it. This blu ray is show off material as the picture and sound quality are both excellent. A must own for Jet Li fans and highly recomended for those who might be interested.,4,One final hurrah for Jet Li!!!,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,705,"['nice', 'see', 'Jet', 'Li', 'action', 'peak', 'career', 'must', 'own', 'blu', 'ray', 'FEARLESS', 'powerful', 'moving', 'epic', 'features', 'Jet', 'Li', 'finest', 'performance', 'actor', 'Not', 'only', 'disc', 'include', 'theatrical', 'unrated', 'versions', 'also', 'director', 'cut', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'put', 'people', 'time', 'release', 'new', 'director', 'cut', 'how', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'director', 'cut', 'pretty', 'much', 'different', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'detail', 'much', 'better', 'flow', 'blu', 'ray', 'show', 'off', 'material', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'must', 'own', 'Jet', 'Li', 'fans', 'highly', 'recomended', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'interested']",N/A
