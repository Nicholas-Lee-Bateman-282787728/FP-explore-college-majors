My favorite one is:Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning WalkThe first mile can be a bit confusing on trying to keep the pace with the music but after you've done the dvd 2 times - you catch on quickly and it is a great walk.  The second mile is faster and fun.  The 3rd mile involves the bands, the only part I didn't like about this was the part where she all of a sudden stops to stretch with the bands for like a minute and starts right back in - I do not stop to do this - I keep walking and stretching the band because I don't like to stop that abruptly during a power walk.  The bands were interesting because I didn't think you'd really feel what they were supposed to do but Leslie tells you where you should feel it.  I was surprised to realize she was right, you did feel it in your core during one stretch and in the back during another.I enjoyed this workout!",5,Great indoor workout,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,981,"['am', '48', 'great', 'workout', 'own', 'few', 'Leslie', 'dvd', '1', '2', 'favorites', 'favorite', 'one', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Home', '5', 'Mile', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'WalkThe', 'first', 'mile', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'trying', 'keep', 'pace', 'music', ""'ve"", 'done', 'dvd', '2', 'times', 'catch', 'quickly', 'great', 'walk', 'second', 'mile', 'faster', 'fun', '3rd', 'mile', 'bands', 'only', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'part', 'where', 'sudden', 'stops', 'stretch', 'bands', 'minute', 'right', 'back', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'do', 'keep', 'walking', 'stretching', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'stop', 'abruptly', 'power', 'walk', 'bands', 'were', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'do', 'Leslie', 'where', 'should', 'feel', 'was', 'surprised', 'realize', 'was', 'right', 'did', 'feel', 'core', 'one', 'stretch', 'back', 'another.I', 'enjoyed', 'workout']",Leslie Sansone Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles

It really gets the heart rate up and the stretchy band works muscles.  I love the boosted walking (jogging) - I don't do the kicks, just keep jogging back and forth for that session.  I also love the additional moves - lots of tap outs, the grapevine, and such.  I'm not sure why kickbacks aren't included in what she calls her basic moves, since they do them in almost every DVD.  Some cons:  her cuing isn't her best, and some of the arm motions don't work with the leg movements.  She has Mary Kay lead for about 5 minutes on the second mile -- I really would have preferred Leslie do it all.  Leslie continually talks, even when she says she's going to be quiet, she never stops.  The background is all black except for 5 panels in back and the stage.  And since everyone is in black pants (which I hate since it obscures leg movements), when the camera angle has the black background, all you see is the head and arms (and maybe the top) moving!  The camera guys and editors did an amateurish job with the shots and editing -- you'll be looking a feet or a torso as movements change and you haven't a clue what is going on.

The first mile is 15 minutes & the warm up is a little faster because this is not for beginners; 2nd mile is 12 minutes; 3rd mile is 10 minutes, & the 4th mile is used with the stretchie band.  The 2nd & 3rd miles are fast because boosted walking/mild jogging are done.  I like this DVD so well because you can select from the main menu which mile you want to do.  I prefer doing 1 & 4 miles as I am over 50 & do not really need to jog.  If you prefer to folllow along from 1-3 mile & do not prefer jogging, you can always walk in place & your movements can become exagerated.

For a beginner or someone who has not worked out in a long time, this would probably be a nice challenge. However, in my regular exercise, I am used to sweating through my clothes. This DVD caused me to sweat very lightly. For this reason, I would say that if you are an avid, hardcore exerciser, this would be good only for a light day (or an off day).As noted by other reviewers, the cuing is off and if it weren't for the fact that the exercisers are sweating, I'd think that they were yelling ""CUT!"" and tried to string the segments together because there are parts that seems to lack continuity. I also found it odd that Steve is a basketball coach and former player but could not execute the simple moves on this DVD with a high level of accuracy.Mary Kay leads for a few minutes and at the end, they use a band.

I have already lost 6 pounds in less than a month since walking nearly every day.  I started off walking only 1 mile a day, and now I usually do 5-8 miles (split up into a couple different times a day).

I am so anti-running, but now that I have been doing Leslie's dvd's I feel like I want to try to do a 5k and then work up from there.  The jogging on this dvd will really help build up endurance for that, I think.  I was able to do this whole dvd at once, and she's not kidding when she says you will work off a whole meal.  Not sure how many calories I burned, but by the end of mile 2, I was already sweating like crazy and I still had 2 miles to go.  And that stretchie band works you more than you'd think.

If you decide not to use the band everyday, you'll still keep moving.What I don't like about the workout is mainly some visual elements.

It's a good walk, but it's not 4 miles...Not sure where they get 4 miles. I was wearing a pedometer and it clocked me in at a little over 3 miles. I would not bother with the stretch band they give you. I tried using it with Leslie and she doesn't seem to even know how to use it. It's kind of pathetic. The other walkers are old and some out of shape. I'm sorry it helps when you see fit people working out with you, not old floppy women. That being said, it is an OK cardio program, but very low intensity. Leslie's annoying talking and the camera switching around all the time on these old faces, kind of confusing...turns me off. I will still do this workout, as it's good for home, but it really doesn't burn too many calories and I barely broke a sweat.

I am so glad she is my personal trainer for pennies a day and I don't have to drive anywhere!  I look forward to her walks every day and I intend to do this kind of exercise the rest of my life!  It's a no brainer--put in the tape, rain or shine, day or night, hot or cold and WALK!  Start with a mile and work up as you become more fit and you will become more fit if you stick with it.  Consistency is the key.  Everyone has 15-30 mins. a day. Leslie promises: ""you can get fit in minutes a day and you will reach your goals if you don't quit!""  She delivers and I'm living proof!  I feel like I know Leslie, Joanne, Linda, Carol and my favorite speedwalker, Mary Kay (she's high energy!) My walking buddies!  I pop in the tape and report for my personal fitness class right in my bedroom! If it wasn't for Leslie, I would still be struggling with my weight, looking for the next diet, and trying to find attractive clothes that fit!  This is no longer a problem for me!  I own a stack of Leslies tapes and choose whatever I want on a particular day.This entire ""Walk Fit"" series is excellent!  I couldn't wait for this one so I purchased it directly on Leslie's website.  This one is so much fun!  If you're a newbie to walking, you may want to do just 1 mile at first and build up.

Like many of her other longer workouts, you can do as many miles as you please, and her banter with her other walkers is fun to watch.  But the real reason I love this workout is because every mile is different.  The first mile is traditional, the second mile is a power mile that's faster, and then comes my favorite--the boosted mile where you do jogging intervals.  The fourth mile uses her stretchie band; while it's good, I would much rather use weights than the band, and don't feel like that mile is all that challenging for me.  However, it's still good, and I love the variety.  All the moves are simple, easy to follow, and it really gets your heart rate up during those middle miles.

I am just fine with Leslie's dependence on the 4 basic steps (I like repetition, and I also have a very small living room, so I now know just how much room I need to perform all her moves).  At one point, she has Mary Kay lead for a while, which is just fine- it's nice to hear her voice after a zillion years of seeing her sweating and grinning in the background.  There's also a guy who I think is her niece's boyfriend (he has the same look as my husband when I drag him shopping) who looks as if he was shanghied into the video, but is now gamely determined to make the best of it.  Each mile ends with the boosted walking,which I didn't realize when I put it in the player- this is important to me because I prefer to wear a more supportive sports bra with the jogging intervals, and by the time I realized I needed one, it was too late.  Nevertheless, I survived the bouncing and jouncing, and look forward to the weekend, when I'll have a full hour to devote to the workout.
