Getting this job is extremely important for them because it is related to an important event happening in the world at that time. This interview is very vague and all that the candidates get is a blank piece of paper and very vague instructions. They have to guess the answer to the interview without knowing the question, while adhering to a very specific set of rules. All the candidates go at this question with curiosity, suspicions arise, true faces and intentions are revealed, and this is the part of the film where the proceedings get very interesting.

1379598,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B0040QYRSQ,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Eight brilliant strangers gathered together in a cold, sterile room. They know each other only by nicknames. White is cocky and manipulative, a leader; Black wears a cross around his neck, and is deceptively sharp; Brown is a cynical, cautious gambler; Blonde is quiet and observant; Brunette is an analytic thinker who won't be pushed around; Dark is a dangerously good psychologist, hiding secrets; Deaf is an introverted, French-speaking outsider. Only seven you say? The eighth, a young Chinese woman, is coldly and quickly expelled by the robotic, armed guard standing at the door, for writing on her paper.Their task? Answer one question correctly, written on a piece of paper, that will lead to them getting hired by the richest company in the world for a job that will almost certainly lead to fortune and prestige. The only problem? All their papers are blank. To tell any more would be to spoil the plot of one of the most original, ingenious, and tightest independent thrillers I've seen in a good long while, and I CERTAINLY wouldn't want to do that.EXAM shows the dark side of human nature. It shows the parts we would rather cover up. It takes 8, on the surface decent, humans, and turns them into animals - cheating, manipulating, scheming, and fighting. Like 12 Angry Men if the 12 men were from all over the globe, all brilliant, all desperate, and all willing to kill for a perfect job, Exam uses it's one-location setting to terrible effect, leading to a surprisingly insightful and detailed glance at human nature, knowledge, and the nature of questions.The acting fits the film perfectly. Director Stuart Hazeldine's international cast brings a wide variety of talents; the acting cannot be faulted, and standout performances come from White, Brown, Deaf, and Colin Salmon's Invigilator. The cinematography and camerawork too, is excellent; cold, slick, and quite often beautiful, it fits the story near-flawlessly. Extra points for a quiet, mood-building score.Yes, there may be plotholes, but this original screenplay and plot is one of the most original, thought-provoking, and smart I have ever seen. Kudos to the cast and crew for a slick, intense, riveting, and endlessly convoluted psychological thrill ride. This movie is not for everyone, however. It contains little action, and casual viewers may find the film confusing. But if you like psychological thrillers that rely on mind games instead of explosions, independent films, and puzzles, Exam is definitely a must-watch. 4.5 points out of 5 (see what I did there?).",5,A smart and twisted mental puzzle.,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,2549,"['Eight', 'brilliant', 'strangers', 'gathered', 'together', 'cold', 'sterile', 'room', 'know', 'other', 'only', 'nicknames', 'White', 'cocky', 'manipulative', 'leader', 'Black', 'cross', 'neck', 'deceptively', 'sharp', 'Brown', 'cynical', 'cautious', 'gambler', 'Blonde', 'quiet', 'observant', 'Brunette', 'analytic', 'thinker', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'pushed', 'Dark', 'dangerously', 'good', 'psychologist', 'hiding', 'secrets', 'Deaf', 'introverted', 'French-speaking', 'outsider', 'Only', 'seven', 'say', 'eighth', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'coldly', 'quickly', 'expelled', 'robotic', 'armed', 'guard', 'standing', 'door', 'writing', 'paper.Their', 'task', 'Answer', 'one', 'question', 'correctly', 'written', 'piece', 'paper', 'will', 'lead', 'getting', 'hired', 'richest', 'company', 'world', 'job', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'lead', 'fortune', 'prestige', 'only', 'problem', 'papers', 'are', 'blank', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'plot', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'ingenious', 'tightest', 'independent', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'long', 'CERTAINLY', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'that.EXAM', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'parts', 'would', 'rather', 'cover', 'up', '8', 'surface', 'decent', 'humans', 'animals', 'cheating', 'manipulating', 'scheming', 'fighting', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', '12', 'men', 'were', 'globe', 'brilliant', 'desperate', 'willing', 'kill', 'perfect', 'job', 'Exam', 'one-location', 'setting', 'terrible', 'effect', 'leading', 'surprisingly', 'insightful', 'detailed', 'glance', 'human', 'nature', 'knowledge', 'nature', 'questions.The', 'acting', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Director', 'Stuart', 'Hazeldine', 'international', 'cast', 'wide', 'variety', 'talents', 'acting', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'standout', 'performances', 'come', 'White', 'Brown', 'Deaf', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'Invigilator', 'cinematography', 'camerawork', 'too', 'excellent', 'cold', 'slick', 'quite', 'often', 'beautiful', 'story', 'near-flawlessly', 'Extra', 'points', 'quiet', 'mood-building', 'score.Yes', 'may', 'be', 'plotholes', 'original', 'screenplay', 'plot', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'thought-provoking', 'smart', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Kudos', 'cast', 'crew', 'slick', 'intense', 'riveting', 'endlessly', 'convoluted', 'psychological', 'thrill', 'ride', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'however', 'little', 'action', 'casual', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'confusing', 'like', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'rely', 'mind', 'games', 'instead', 'explosions', 'independent', 'films', 'puzzles', 'Exam', 'definitely', 'must-watch', '4.5', 'points', '5', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'there']",N/A

I had low expectations going in on this one and was VERY pleasantly surprised. Hazeldine in this closed room scenario managed to pull out the tension that ""Devil"" failed to achieve earlier this year in an elevator.The premise is that eight candidates are vying for a very prestigious job with a company. They are shown into a room with eight desks, each of which has a white slip of paper with ""Candidate"" and a number after it. A proctor of the ""exam"" informs them that there is one question before them and one answer and lays out ground rules of not attempting to speak to the proctor or the guard in the room and that if any of them ""spoils"" their paper, they are disqualified and escorted out.What follows is an exercise in logic and group dynamics as each of them attempts to pull information out of the others without giving much in return. A sassy bad boy-type man who makes waves played by Luke Mably dubs himself the nickname ""White"" and then hands out nicknames to the others based on their race or hair color to make things simpler. While they try to work together to at least find the question, it soon becomes every man or woman for themselves.I found this film suspenseful and intriguing with very well developed characters, dialogue, and strategy. The entire film takes place in one room that they manage to use in interesting ways once the characters in the room attempt to change the space to induce results.

1379611,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0040QYRSQ,Kevin Killian,"[7, 9]","This picture reminded me of a time when newly graduated from high school I tried to put myself through college by taking the SAT exams for younger students.  If they wanted to get into some place great I'd try to get brilliant scores, if they wanted to get into community college I'd answer badly.  It would be rather fun except it was a little bit nerve wracking, and I stopped my activities when one girl in the classroom recognized me under my true identity and nearly jobbed me as a bad lot.  Whew, I can still feel the relief.  I don't think you could do this today, I expect every single person, even the young, has some sort of picture ID, or maybe they use DNA evidence, but back then you basically just out your social security card on the desk and the proctors might give it a look but usually they just whisked by like runway models, looking neither sideways nor down.In EXAM the young people are not trying to get into top schools but rather they're sitting for an exam in which the top applicant will win a job with a faceless corporation.  It didn't seem likely to us, but then they explained that the world had been invaded with a killer disease and that this company a) gave top people great medical insurance and b) actually were this close to a cure.  In th4 closed set of the exam room, it all seems far away, and thus when the eight people are all revealed to have enough motive to do just about anything to stay in the game, it makes sense, well, up to a certain point.  I'm afraid the low budget of the production limits its plausibility.  We never get a sense of the outside world, and the characters, who absurdly use not their own names but they answer to names like ""Black,"" ""White"" and ""Brown"" bestowed on them by a chav, come across like they think they're in some Guy Ritchie remake of The Usual Suspects.  Or is it like Glengarry Glen Ross, mixed with a little bit of Reservoir Dogs, but with much cuter guys.  There's nothing original about EXAM in the least, but Jimi Mistry, Luke Mabry and Chuk Iwuji are all entertaining in their brown, white and black ways.  The girls, not so much.  Two of them are among the worst actresses I've ever seen in an actual movie, you think it's some kind of reality show but it's not, they're supposed to be edgy young British talent.  Well, I shouldn't be harsh, I'm just warning you, this movie has A aspirations but D-level performances, and the writing is ludicrous, once you realize that the whole ninety minutes folks are going to think about what you could do with a sheet of white paper short of ruining it.  Everything we thought of, no matter how silly, the characters then proposed and tried it out.  ""Let's give the weak one a paper cut with it!""

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 19]","An intricate puzzler, ""Exam"" is a topical and prescient locked room mystery that makes good use of standard thriller conventions and modernizes them in unique and timely ways.  With eight strangers (and one security guard) enclosed in a classroom, ""Exam"" initiates a competition and lets the psychological warfare begin.  Reliant on a smart script and good performances, this film with its claustrophobic setting and defined time frame allows for a slow build tension that eventually explodes as the clock ticks down.  The hook to ""Exam"" is that these eight individuals are in the last stages of a crucial job interview process and an enigmatic final test is the last hurdle.  With desperation and deceit, the prospective employees find themselves combatants in the ultimate mind game!""Exam"" ratchets up the stakes by setting the film in the near future where a pandemic is ripping through the world's populace.  Winning the job is a chance at survival itself as one of the company perks is a treatment protocol--a health insurance package of undeniable importance.  But to gain life, is it worth trading your humanity?  That's the conundrum each of the interviewees must face.  From various backgrounds, these applicants form a good cross section of society and this microcosm starts to unravel almost immediately.  Each is given a blank sheet of paper and asked to answer one question--but the question is never defined.  After they initially work together, they start to become more and more frantic and more and more ruthless at eliminating the competition.  There will be only one victor.The story is taut and tidy.  The screenplay is clever without being overly precious.  And the cast is game.  Ranging from cool bravado to outright hysteria, each actor brings a unique characteristic to their role.  I will single out Luke Mably for special mention.  In other films, he has sometimes come across as rather placid and nondescript.  Here he is absolutely captivating with an intensity that burns up the screen and propels the movie forward.  His unhinged performance lends an ""anything can happen"" feel to the film that is really effective.  ""Exam"" is a thinking person's thriller for people who appreciate the tension that can be generated by dialogue and human interaction.  The concept brings out both the best and worst of those involved and that is where the drama lay.  ""Exam"" is a psychological treat that actually has a decent emotional payoff--I was very pleasantly surprised!

1379616,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0040QYRSQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Exam (Stuart Hazeldine, 2009)There seems to be a sudden swell in the number of locked-room mystery/thrillers coming out recently, and while they (like any other fad subgenre) range from the sublime to the ridiculous, I have to admit I've been quite fond of most of them, and Exam, the first directorial effort from writer Stuart Hazeldine (Riverworld), is no exception. I guess this shouldn't surprise me, considering it was BAFTA-nominated for Outstanding Debut (losing to Duncan Jones and Moon). Not sure what I was expecting, but Exam exceeded it nicely.We begin with eight people getting ready. After a few moments of montage, they descend on a room (presumably underground, though we do not know for certain) where each is seated at a desk. They are addressed by a man who calls himself The Invigilator (Colin Salmon, a staple in late-nineties Bond flicks). The Invigilator lays down the ground rules for the test, sets a clock for eighty minutes, and then leaves them alone with a silent guard (stuntman Chris Carey, who also had a small role in1408). The eight of them soon realize that this is no normal exam; their papers are all blank, save ""Candidate 1"", ""Candidate 2"", etc. One of them starts acting as a de facto leader once he realizes that the rules don't include not talking to one another, and disdaining the use of names, he christens them all (save one who has already been disqualified); thus we only know the main characters by one of their defining traits. We have White (28 Days Later's Luke Mably), who's doing the leading, along with Black (Proof's Chukwudi Iwuji), Brown (2012's Jimi Mistry), and Chinese (model Gemma Chan in her first feature), then he moves on to Blonde (Clash of the Titans' Nathalie Cox), Brunette (Land of the Lost's Pollyanna MacIntosh), and Dark (Adar Beck, recently of The Debt). The last of the bunch he christens Deaf (Coronation Street's John Lloyd Fillingham), presumably because he's the only person in the room who seems to be capable of ignoring White. As the time runs down and the remaining candidates get more desperate, we start to see beyond the interview-like facade each had presented in the beginning.You've got a debut director working with, in general, a stable of unknown actors in a low-budget film. You can guess where that's going, but this is one of those happy cases in which you couldn't be more wrong. Exam is a tense, well-written thriller that deserves far more attention than it's gotten; aside from one quick festival release, it went straight to video-on-demand in America.

1379618,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0040QYRSQ,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Exam is a dark and brilliant thriller, that plays like an old fashioned Twilight Zone episode, taking place with eight people inside a single room. These people, whose names we never learn, are there for one reason, to take a test. This exam is the last part of a grueling screening process for one of the worlds most prestigious jobs. A man called The Invigilator comes in with a simple set of instruction and then leaves the group alone. To their surprise, the applicants turn over their exams and find out the paper is blank. I have to admit that in the beginning of this film, I was bored and really didn't know what was happening, but the reason I kept watching was that I wanted to learn what they wanted to learn. While watching this film, you'll find yourself shouting out ideas, the way the applicants do. The story is not only smart, but it's extremely engaging, with an ending that you will not believe. Being that this is an overseas film, the cast was British and mostly unfamiliar to me, with the exception of Luke Mably, who was in Spirit Trap and 28 Days Later. Once again Mably is great as a character you'll just love to hate, I guess some people are just made for that. Exam is an amazing story with a fantastic ending. It's a little bit slow and requires you to think, but in the end, it's well worth the effort.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1332,"['Exam', 'dark', 'brilliant', 'thriller', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'taking', 'place', 'eight', 'people', 'single', 'room', 'people', 'names', 'never', 'learn', 'are', 'there', 'one', 'reason', 'take', 'test', 'exam', 'last', 'part', 'grueling', 'screening', 'process', 'one', 'worlds', 'most', 'prestigious', 'jobs', 'man', 'called', 'Invigilator', 'simple', 'set', 'instruction', 'then', 'group', 'alone', 'surprise', 'applicants', 'turn', 'over', 'exams', 'find', 'out', 'paper', 'blank', 'have', 'admit', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'bored', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'reason', 'kept', 'watching', 'was', 'wanted', 'learn', 'what', 'wanted', 'learn', 'watching', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', 'shouting', 'out', 'ideas', 'way', 'applicants', 'do', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'smart', 'extremely', 'engaging', 'ending', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'Being', 'overseas', 'film', 'cast', 'was', 'British', 'mostly', 'unfamiliar', 'exception', 'Luke', 'Mably', 'who', 'was', 'Spirit', 'Trap', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Once', 'again', 'Mably', 'great', 'character', ""'ll"", 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'guess', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'made', 'Exam', 'amazing', 'story', 'fantastic', 'ending', 'little', 'bit', 'slow', 'think', 'end', 'well', 'effort']",N/A

""Exam"", by using the ""strangers in a room"" format, manages to create a fresh viewing experience on the tried-and-true psychological thriller convention.For a basic plot summary, ""Exam"" sees eight participants for a job interview brought together in a nondescript room and told to ""Answer one question"", although that question is not given to them.  There are, of course, also rules for disqualification that they must closely abide by.  When the door shuts and the timer begins, the applicants must work together (or possibly selfishly?) to solve the puzzle in front of them.""Exam"" combines many elements of the Twilight Zone (paranoia from ""Monsters on Maple Street"" & the ""where are we and what do we do now"" from ""Five Characters In Search of An Exit"") with the gritty feel of the ""Saw"" franchise.  This is a combination that truly works and will keep you guessing until the very end.  The overall mystery will suck viewers in initially, while the character/plot progressions will keep you glued to the edge of your seat for the duration.About the only reason I can't give this film the full five stars is because I did not particularly care for the ending.  It isn't bad, by any means, but I was just expecting something so different that it kind of threw me for a loop.  Please don't let this stop you from watching ""Exam"", however, as this is only a personal preference of mine...a friend I was watching the film with thought the ending was just fine.  To each his own.Thus, I can highly recommend ""Exam"" to anyone who is a fan of ""whodunnit"" stories, psychological thrillers, or just mystery stories in general.  This is a British film that hasn't gotten much press or hype here in the States, but it can be found on Netflix.",4,Your Interest Will Never Wane,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1802,"['are', 'film', 'formats/conventions', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'Exam', 'using', 'strangers', 'room', 'format', 'create', 'fresh', 'viewing', 'experience', 'tried-and-true', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'convention.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Exam', 'sees', 'eight', 'participants', 'job', 'interview', 'brought', 'together', 'nondescript', 'room', 'told', 'Answer', 'one', 'question', 'question', 'not', 'given', 'are', 'course', 'also', 'rules', 'disqualification', 'must', 'closely', 'abide', 'When', 'door', 'shuts', 'timer', 'applicants', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'possibly', 'selfishly', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'front', 'Exam', 'many', 'elements', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'paranoia', 'Monsters', 'Maple', 'Street', 'where', 'are', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'now', 'Five', 'Characters', 'Search', 'Exit', 'gritty', 'feel', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'combination', 'truly', 'works', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'overall', 'mystery', 'will', 'suck', 'viewers', 'initially', 'character/plot', 'progressions', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'edge', 'seat', 'duration.About', 'only', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'care', 'ending', ""n't"", 'bad', 'means', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'something', 'so', 'different', 'kind', 'threw', 'loop', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'watching', 'Exam', 'however', 'only', 'personal', 'preference', 'mine', 'friend', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'fine', 'own.Thus', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Exam', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'whodunnit', 'stories', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'just', 'mystery', 'stories', 'general', 'British', 'film', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'much', 'press', 'hype', 'here', 'States', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Netflix']",N/A
