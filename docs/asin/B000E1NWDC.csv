We are taken along on what starts as a historical/archeological sort of journey which turns into the author/narrator/host's conversion . . a revelation that the Bible is real.  This is not a travelogue, but a diary of a trek along ancient routes.  Bruce Feiler is not preaching, but sharing his discovery.

While Mr. Feiler isn't some fundamentalist, he's not some die-hard skeptic either.  He went on this journey through Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey to better understand the Bible, to get a deeper sense of spirituality, and to reconnect with his faith, not to try to disprove everything in the Bible at every turn or to try to find scientific explanations for everything.  His enthusiasm for the subject was very infectious, and it was so obvious that as the journey progressed, his sense of wonder and connection to the Divine, history, and the land were increasing.  Among the places he visits are the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; Petra, Jordan, where some believe the Israelites to have encamped for 38 of the years of their journey in the wilderness; a place in Turkey where the Garden of Eden is believed to have been; and a 1,500 year old monastery in Egypt, which he estimates has held about 3 million services since its creation and which has a wondrous library.  In addition to really making the people, places, and history of the Bible come to life instead of just being words on a page and far-off events in far-off places, it's also inspiring how cordially he got along with people of different faiths along the way.  He lodged, worshipped, ate and drank, and talked with Muslims, Jews, and Christians, really achieving the goal of his archaeologist companion Avner Goren, building bridges of peace and understanding instead of avoiding different people and never finding any common ground.  Mr. Feiler also ultimately concludes that trying too hard to find a scientific explanation for or historical proof of everything can take away a lot of what the Bible is really all about, a sense of wonder, faith, and spirituality.  My only complaint is that it wasn't longer!  Maybe we'll see a follow-up one day, in which he geographically explores the rest of the Bible.",5,A profound journey,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2058,"['three-part', 'series', 'based', 'Bruce', 'Feiler', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'viewer', 'fascinating', 'profound', 'journey', 'literally', 'first', 'five', 'books', 'Bible', 'Mr.', 'Feiler', ""n't"", 'fundamentalist', 'not', 'die-hard', 'skeptic', 'either', 'went', 'journey', 'Israel', 'Egypt', 'Jordan', 'Turkey', 'better', 'understand', 'Bible', 'get', 'deeper', 'sense', 'spirituality', 'reconnect', 'faith', 'not', 'try', 'disprove', 'everything', 'Bible', 'turn', 'try', 'find', 'scientific', 'explanations', 'everything', 'enthusiasm', 'subject', 'was', 'very', 'infectious', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'journey', 'progressed', 'sense', 'wonder', 'connection', 'Divine', 'history', 'land', 'were', 'increasing', 'places', 'are', 'Temple', 'Mount', 'Jerusalem', 'Petra', 'Jordan', 'where', 'believe', 'Israelites', 'have', 'encamped', '38', 'years', 'journey', 'wilderness', 'place', 'Turkey', 'where', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'believed', 'have', 'been', '1,500', 'year', 'old', 'monastery', 'Egypt', 'held', '3', 'million', 'services', 'creation', 'wondrous', 'library', 'addition', 'really', 'making', 'people', 'places', 'history', 'Bible', 'come', 'life', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'words', 'page', 'far-off', 'events', 'far-off', 'places', 'also', 'inspiring', 'how', 'cordially', 'got', 'along', 'people', 'different', 'faiths', 'way', 'lodged', 'worshipped', 'ate', 'drank', 'talked', 'Muslims', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'really', 'achieving', 'goal', 'archaeologist', 'companion', 'Avner', 'Goren', 'building', 'bridges', 'peace', 'understanding', 'instead', 'avoiding', 'different', 'people', 'never', 'finding', 'common', 'ground', 'Mr.', 'Feiler', 'also', 'ultimately', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'find', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'historical', 'proof', 'everything', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'lot', 'what', 'Bible', 'really', 'sense', 'wonder', 'faith', 'spirituality', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', ""n't"", 'longer', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'see', 'follow-up', 'one', 'day', 'geographically', 'rest', 'Bible']",N/A

It is not so much an attempt to either prove or disprove the events of the bible, but an attempt to put a ""face"" (as it were) to some of the locations in the Bible.  I don't so much see this as the work done by a skeptic, but by someone who truly wants to understand the whys and hows of the events.  If that means ice-caps melted to create the flood, does it necessarily follow that he is skeptical of God?  I mean, SOMEONE had to cause the ice-caps to melt, didn't they?  As I see it, here is someone who maybe fell out of love with their religion and is trying to understand and renew their faith.  At the very least, this is a visually stunning look at the areas of the Middle East that are where the bible was originally written.

966001,AFM9DJYPNM7VT,B000E1NWDC,"Goldencat ""Carla""","[1, 2]","I felt like I was attending a well done presentation at graduate school. It was wonderful not to have to filter out theological, archaeological, or linguistic jargon. It was given as smoothly as a long talk on the phone to a friend. Very nice job.It felt like there were no biases here, just an open seeking for the truth, and matching the evidence to the Bible, to the local legends. This gave a more complete picture than someone with a theological axe to grind, be it Fundamentalist, Atheist, or Nihilist. (a religion is an organised system of belief or dis-belief) One often wonders if the speaker can be believed in those cases, unless one is already in agreement with their platform. And there is really no need for a platform unless you need to con people like a politician. Let the facts speak and let people decide if its enough.The guide showed cultural and religious respect to all the peoples he met, in every region. This went from participating in a wedding dance at the slope of Mt. Ararat, to sharing hospitality in a Bedouin tent, to asking lodging at a desert monastery.I think the native people responded naturally, because he was relaxed, not coming across like a know-it-all professor out to prove his thesis. So he also got access to places Westerners generally don't. For example - passage through the military zones to reach Ararat, and past the armed guards to the Dome of the Rock. It helped that he was ""PBS"". They seemed to like PBS.It was sad to hear how the lands have changed since Bible days, like Egypt losing trees, and Israel being near-desert all over. The trek really helps to make the Bible personal, as it did for the host.There is something about getting to know the place and the people that helps to connect with the past. We lose so much of our connectedness in modern ""civilized"" countries, where you may not even know your heritage 2 generations back.This is valuable for re-connecting to the human family, as well as connecting humans to their relationship with YHWH, God of the Bible.",5,Walk through history and look for the presence of God,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,2031,"['felt', 'was', 'attending', 'well', 'done', 'presentation', 'graduate', 'school', 'was', 'wonderful', 'not', 'have', 'filter', 'out', 'theological', 'archaeological', 'linguistic', 'jargon', 'was', 'given', 'as', 'smoothly', 'long', 'talk', 'phone', 'friend', 'Very', 'nice', 'job.It', 'felt', 'were', 'biases', 'here', 'just', 'open', 'seeking', 'truth', 'matching', 'evidence', 'Bible', 'local', 'legends', 'gave', 'more', 'complete', 'picture', 'someone', 'theological', 'axe', 'grind', 'be', 'Fundamentalist', 'Atheist', 'Nihilist', 'religion', 'organised', 'system', 'belief', 'dis-belief', 'One', 'often', 'speaker', 'can', 'be', 'believed', 'cases', 'one', 'already', 'agreement', 'platform', 'really', 'need', 'platform', 'need', 'con', 'people', 'politician', 'Let', 'facts', 'speak', 'let', 'people', 'decide', 'enough.The', 'guide', 'showed', 'cultural', 'religious', 'respect', 'peoples', 'met', 'region', 'went', 'participating', 'wedding', 'dance', 'slope', 'Mt', 'Ararat', 'sharing', 'hospitality', 'Bedouin', 'tent', 'asking', 'lodging', 'desert', 'monastery.I', 'think', 'native', 'people', 'responded', 'naturally', 'was', 'relaxed', 'not', 'coming', 'know-it-all', 'professor', 'prove', 'thesis', 'also', 'got', 'access', 'places', 'Westerners', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'example', 'passage', 'military', 'zones', 'reach', 'Ararat', 'armed', 'guards', 'Dome', 'Rock', 'helped', 'was', 'PBS', 'seemed', 'like', 'PBS.It', 'was', 'sad', 'hear', 'how', 'lands', 'have', 'changed', 'Bible', 'days', 'Egypt', 'losing', 'trees', 'Israel', 'being', 'near-desert', 'trek', 'really', 'make', 'Bible', 'personal', 'did', 'host.There', 'something', 'getting', 'know', 'place', 'people', 'connect', 'past', 'lose', 'so', 'much', 'connectedness', 'modern', 'civilized', 'countries', 'where', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'heritage', '2', 'generations', 'back.This', 'valuable', 're-connecting', 'human', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'connecting', 'humans', 'relationship', 'YHWH', 'God', 'Bible']",N/A
