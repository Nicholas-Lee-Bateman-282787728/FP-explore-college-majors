You'll spend the whole time you're watching trying to figure out how much of what you see and hear is true, and how much of it David Simon and company worked into the show and in what form.The production values aren't great, the reeneactments are cheesy, and the narrator's tone veers from decrying  to admiring violence and criminality. And Wood Harris's role seems to be just  to show amusement at Barksdale's tales of crime- at one point he laughs heartily when Barksdale declines to answer a questions by saying there is no statute of limitations on murder.

1316873,A1A8KAZ7BFPNMN,B00316DDYA,IVAN EDGAR PRATT,"[0, 0]","The Avon Barksdale Documentary film and my opinion of it, well in all honesty, the Avon Barksdale Story concerning African American's living in depressed and oppressed ghetto neighborhoods, by the original Avon Barksdale original personality was interesting.  However, Avon Barksdale himself is intelligent enough to tell you the essential reasons why African Americans truly do resort to selling illegal drugs, which has a great deal to do with corporate America controlling local and national government, and forcing young African American men, for the sake of survival, to get very involved in the illegal business of drug sales.  This documentary, though interesting, and certainly well meaning, does not even began to address the essential social psychological demographics of people like Avon Barksdale  decision to become illegal drug CEO's if one could use that term.  Even Avon Barksdale inclination and inspiration toward the educational matriculations of business venture procedure could have told you in his documentary how many corporate faction have their illegal business transactions in making a profit on illegal street drugs &#8211; but Avon Barksdale values his life, so he keeps his mouth shut even now that he's attempting to clean his act up.  We all know, though we never say anything, how corporate America, are purely sociopathic when it comes to making money.  This documentary film on Avon Barksdale in my opinion needs serious editing by a serious investigative journalist who is serious, and courageous enough to tell the true story of AvonBarksdale, and the Avon Barksdales throughout America living in depressed neighborhood environments.  Especially in contrast to corrupt corporate money controlling government interest in the twenty-first century.  I'm sure Avon Barksdale and his mother knows this very well.",2,Avon Barksdale himself is intelligent enough to tell you the essential reasons why African ...,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,1843,"['Avon', 'Barksdale', 'Documentary', 'film', 'opinion', 'well', 'honesty', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'Story', 'concerning', 'African', 'American', 'living', 'depressed', 'oppressed', 'ghetto', 'neighborhoods', 'original', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'original', 'personality', 'was', 'interesting', 'However', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'tell', 'essential', 'reasons', 'why', 'African', 'Americans', 'truly', 'do', 'resort', 'selling', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'great', 'deal', 'do', 'corporate', 'America', 'controlling', 'local', 'national', 'government', 'forcing', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'men', 'sake', 'survival', 'get', 'very', 'involved', 'illegal', 'business', 'drug', 'sales', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'well', 'meaning', 'not', 'even', 'began', 'address', 'essential', 'social', 'psychological', 'demographics', 'people', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'decision', 'become', 'illegal', 'drug', 'CEO', 'one', 'could', 'use', 'term', 'Even', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'inclination', 'inspiration', 'educational', 'matriculations', 'business', 'venture', 'procedure', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'documentary', 'how', 'many', 'corporate', 'faction', 'have', 'illegal', 'business', 'transactions', 'making', 'profit', 'illegal', 'street', 'drugs', '8211', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'life', 'mouth', 'shut', 'even', 'now', 'attempting', 'clean', 'act', 'up', 'know', 'never', 'say', 'anything', 'how', 'corporate', 'America', 'are', 'purely', 'sociopathic', 'when', 'making', 'money', 'documentary', 'film', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'opinion', 'serious', 'editing', 'serious', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'who', 'serious', 'courageous', 'enough', 'tell', 'true', 'story', 'AvonBarksdale', 'Avon', 'Barksdales', 'America', 'living', 'depressed', 'neighborhood', 'environments', 'Especially', 'contrast', 'corrupt', 'corporate', 'money', 'controlling', 'government', 'interest', 'twenty-first', 'century', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'mother', 'very', 'well']",N/A

The drama aspect left something to be desired. As a thug, he was unimpressive in the story. What I liked about the tale was that it took place in Baltimore, a city that I frequented during this time period. The narrator/writer attempted to give people a contrast of the Inner Harbor tourist area with the projects, however during this era that Inner Harbor area didn't exist. Camden Yards didn't exist. This was an 80's development.The film is certainly inspirational to handicapped children who aspire to be drug dealers. The real truth is that Avon is most famous for being shot in the head three times and surviving to tell about it.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.
