990178,A13RYFCGR7AM7E,B000FI8MHA,"Andrew Thompson ""a.k.a. Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[2, 3]","I've said before that watching this movie on late-night TV as a kid is one of the reasons I think I became a horror movie fan. I can tell you, I remember being very wary of the neighborhood mutts for weeks after seeing this, and hearing a dog howl or bark in the night gave my eight to ten year old self new meaning to terror.Upon watching it recently (some thirty years of maturity and experience later), it's easy to see the flaws...low budget, overall mediocre acting (in it's defense, all but the four or so principals were local college students, although a standout is to see David McCallum in those post U.N.C.L.E., pre-NCIS years), and sometimes much-too-dark camera work. Still, besides the nostalgic value, it's still fun to watch. It's amazing to me still that the filmmakers were able to get that many different breeds of dog to act in concert, and hats off to the trainers that would get the dogs whipped up into the frenzies that they were in...the sounds of the enraged, attacking dogs is terrifying even still (however, their ""pack howling"" that is heard far too often kind of reminds me of tornado sirens). It's also a surprisingly gory picture all things considered.The video and audio transfers were much better than I expected, although it would have been nice to see in a widescreen format, or a 5.1 Dolby remix (or BOTH, if I'm going to wish).All in all, if you're a die-hard horror/cult film fan, really into the 70's ""Nature Gone Nuts"" genre, or just an old-timer like me that recalls this from your youth, this one is not a bad investment for the price. It's a three star movie for the former, and a four star movie for the latter.",4,A little piece of cultish memory...,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,1656,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'watching', 'movie', 'late-night', 'TV', 'kid', 'one', 'reasons', 'think', 'became', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'can', 'tell', 'remember', 'being', 'very', 'wary', 'neighborhood', 'mutts', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'dog', 'howl', 'bark', 'night', 'gave', 'eight', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'new', 'meaning', 'terror.Upon', 'watching', 'recently', 'thirty', 'years', 'maturity', 'experience', 'later', 'easy', 'see', 'flaws', 'low', 'budget', 'overall', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'defense', 'four', 'so', 'principals', 'were', 'local', 'college', 'students', 'standout', 'see', 'David', 'McCallum', 'post', 'U.N.C.L.E.', 'pre-NCIS', 'years', 'sometimes', 'much-too-dark', 'camera', 'work', 'Still', 'nostalgic', 'value', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'amazing', 'still', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'many', 'different', 'breeds', 'dog', 'act', 'concert', 'hats', 'trainers', 'would', 'get', 'dogs', 'whipped', 'up', 'frenzies', 'were', 'sounds', 'enraged', 'attacking', 'dogs', 'terrifying', 'even', 'still', 'however', 'pack', 'howling', 'heard', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'kind', 'reminds', 'tornado', 'sirens', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'gory', 'picture', 'things', 'considered.The', 'video', 'audio', 'transfers', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'widescreen', 'format', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'remix', 'BOTH', ""'m"", 'going', 'wish', '.All', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'horror/cult', 'film', 'fan', 'really', '70', 'Nature', 'Gone', 'Nuts', 'genre', 'just', 'old-timer', 'youth', 'one', 'not', 'bad', 'investment', 'price', 'three', 'star', 'movie', 'former', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'latter']",N/A

990182,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B000FI8MHA,J. B. Hoyos,"[15, 15]","In ""Dogs,"" man's best friend has become his worst enemy.  At a small California college town, domesticated dogs are mauling cattle.  Soon, a rancher is found dead.  Later, a motorcyclist and an elderly woman are attacked by dogs and dragged away, torn and bleeding.  The bodies begin piling up, but the mayor refuses to believe that domesticated dogs are packing together and killing.  Before the night is over, many people will die.  Linda Gray of ""Dallas"" fame stars in this cult classic 70's thriller.  Her death is reminiscent of the shower scene in ""Psycho.""  Overall, the acting could've been better.  I would've given ""Dogs"" another star if the presentation had been in widescreen in lieu of full.  The film and audio quality were better than expected but there are no subtitle or captions as given in Amazon's advertisement.  If you love nature gone wild fims, such as ""The Swarm,"" ""Ants,"" ""Killer Bees,"" ""Birds,"" and ""Frogs,"" then this film is perfect for you.  The alternate title is ""Slaughter.""

With no real reason given except for increased pherenomes, this town's canine set is going bonkers when they're in packs and attacking and killing everyone.
