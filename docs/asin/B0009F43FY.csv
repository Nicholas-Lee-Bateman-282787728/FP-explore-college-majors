It was a regular hour-long episode that aired April 15, 2002, as part of a truncated (from 23 episodes down to 19) third season. It ended with the fourth wall being broken, and the cast and crew spoke as themselves of what the series meant to them.There's still no word as to when a DVD set of season three will see the light of day. I am so disappointed with Buena Vista over this. Come on, BVHE. There's a real demand for this series. If you're a fan of O&A;, and haven't bought the first two seasons, then PLEASE do so.

Sela Ward, Billy Campbell, Evan Rachel Wood, Shane West and the rest of the cast played these characters with authenticity and strength. Wood went on to star in the incredible film, Thirteen, I just knew her career would take off after this show ended third season. In the second season of Once and Again, her charater Jessie struggles with anorexia, her scenes are so touching and raw, what a gifted young actress, she was the main reason I tuned in every week, just remarkable. Sela Ward is good in everything she is in. My fave episode is the Thanksgiving episode. Patrick Dempsey guest starred as Ward's mentally challenged brother from time to time.

904687,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B0009F43FY,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[6, 6]","I was a huge fan of Once & Again's brand of adult melodrama, but it's worth noting that season 2 was the weak link in its illustrious three years.  I was never nuts about the Atlantor/ Miles Drentel plotline that dominated Rick's (Billy Campbell) year - his ambition was interesting enough, his crises of conscience and ""darker side"" weren't as much.  Campbell does a rousing do-gooder, but in truth, he was always Once's least interesting character, and made a better as a supportive rod in the background than lead.  I was also not nuts about Lily's stint as trailblazing editor's assistant - not because Sela Ward's plotlines were insubstantial (for proof, take one view of her rabblerousing sexual harrassment episode ""Suspicion"" - which likely netted her deserved Emmy for the year), but because Jennifer Crystal Foley's artist/brat-in-a-power-suit-and-pigtails Christie was always more annoying than welcome.  But if some of the bigger plot machinations didn't work, Once & Again moved hearts left and right with its smaller moments and extraordinary support cast.  Grace (the extraordinary, underappreciated Julia Whelan) stealing from Jessie in spite of herself (""Thieves Like Us""), Judy's love of Salinger and singles' nights (""Booklovers""), another terrific guest appearance by Patrick Dempsey (""Aaron's Getting Better""), and, especially, the emergence of Evan Rachael Wood as a major young actress - her heartbreaking work in ""Food For Thought"" steals the season.

Now we hear that Season 2 is about to be released in August, along with a rerelease of Season 1, and that is sensational news. For the many viewers who never got to see this remarkable series, now is your chance to catch up and revel in some amazing writing and some deeply-felt performances by a sterling ensemble cast, led by Sela Ward (an Emmy winner for this) and Billy Campbell (who should have been).

904690,AWZVJVORSYODE,B0009F43FY,"Jenna Wikler ""skulker""","[4, 69]","really, i can't say enough about how terrible this show is. i have a sad suspicion that the creator or ""my so called life"" had only one idea, and after that success just kept trying to recycle the same stuff. it doesn't work the second time around, because ""my so-called life"" would have been nothing without the amazing claire danes. all the high school drama she was involved in made the show spectacular; the adults were like empty shells. i assumed back then that they were supposed to be that way because from a high schooler's point of view, adults really are not people.however, ""once and again"" is all about the adults and the kids are more peripheral. and still, the kids are the only halfway-likeable characters. the adults are simply insufferable. i keep hoping that maybe the writers were being ironic and intended for all the characters to be so insufferable, plastic, simple-minded... but really there's not a touch of irony anywhere to be found. these empty shells are our protagonists and we're supposed to somehow identify with them.it is hard to look at most of them, all issues of writing and acting aside. ""rick"" has a teeny little mouth and a big stick up his ... and the names of everyone else escape me at this moment because they are so boring. the sister is somewhat cute and somewhat worth empathizing with.... but the fact that she wants what her sister has, or wishes she was her sister, is completely inconsistent with her character.i also need to point out that the kids, grace and zoey, have the exact same hairstyles as the two daughters in ""my so-called life."" they are the same ages and have basically the same personalities as well. they even wear similar outfits!!!this series is a bad testament to the very lowest common denominator. perhaps that's why it has such a huge following. i pity the poor suckers who think this is as good as tv can get.",1,unbelievably bad,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,1884,"['really', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'terrible', 'show', 'i', 'have', 'sad', 'suspicion', 'creator', 'so', 'called', 'life', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'idea', 'success', 'just', 'kept', 'trying', 'recycle', 'same', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'work', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'so-called', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'claire', 'danes', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'was', 'involved', 'made', 'show', 'spectacular', 'adults', 'were', 'empty', 'shells', 'i', 'assumed', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 'high', 'schooler', 'point', 'view', 'adults', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'people.however', 'once', 'again', 'adults', 'kids', 'are', 'more', 'peripheral', 'still', 'kids', 'are', 'only', 'halfway-likeable', 'characters', 'adults', 'are', 'simply', 'insufferable', 'i', 'keep', 'hoping', 'maybe', 'writers', 'were', 'being', 'ironic', 'intended', 'characters', 'be', 'so', 'insufferable', 'plastic', 'simple-minded', 'really', 'not', 'touch', 'irony', 'anywhere', 'be', 'found', 'empty', 'shells', 'are', 'protagonists', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'somehow', 'identify', 'them.it', 'hard', 'look', 'most', 'issues', 'writing', 'acting', 'aside', 'rick', 'teeny', 'little', 'mouth', 'big', 'stick', 'up', 'names', 'everyone', 'else', 'escape', 'moment', 'are', 'so', 'boring', 'sister', 'somewhat', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'worth', 'empathizing', 'fact', 'what', 'sister', 'wishes', 'was', 'sister', 'completely', 'inconsistent', 'character.i', 'also', 'need', 'point', 'out', 'kids', 'grace', 'zoey', 'have', 'exact', 'same', 'hairstyles', 'two', 'daughters', 'so-called', 'life', 'are', 'same', 'ages', 'have', 'basically', 'same', 'personalities', 'well', 'even', 'wear', 'similar', 'outfits', 'series', 'bad', 'testament', 'very', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'perhaps', 'why', 'huge', 'following', 'i', 'pity', 'poor', 'suckers', 'who', 'think', 'as', 'good', 'tv', 'can', 'get']",Once and Again - The Complete Second Season

904692,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009F43FY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 15]","Watching ""Once and Again"" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again.  This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date.  I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them.  Watching ""Once and Again: The Complete Second Season"" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning.  There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family (""Scribbling Rivalry"").  Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again.  If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through.If the first season of ""Once and Again"" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance.  There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., ""Scribbling Rivalry"") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell (""Edifice Wrecked""), than there is about them being with each other.  While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, ""Feast or Famine"").  The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well).  So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing (""Best of Enemies""), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating (""Food for Thought"").Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on ""thirtysomething"" all over again.  But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick (""Ozymandias 2.0""), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot.  This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live.  But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting (""Edifice Wrecked""), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison (""Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight"").  When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious.This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters.  Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun (""The Other End of the Telescope""), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby (""Forgive Us Out Trespasses"").  Judy comes up with the great idea of ""Booklovers,"" despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck.  Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music (""I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down""), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue.  Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December.  I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation.  So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation.My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental.  At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring.  The fact that season two ends with the wedding (""The Second Time Around"") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking ""Once and Again"" was simply about Lily getting remarried.  It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD.",5,"Lily, Rick and their

904694,A38QX8P4F7MKJ0,B0009F43FY,Mr. Dude Man,"[88, 90]","Ah, the second season. So dark and complex and utterly lifelike, it may be the most involving and thought-provoking of the three. (If I remember correctly, the ratings really started to flag here because 'Once and Again', Season 2, wasn't much fun to watch for ABC viewers who were better suited to, say, 'Full House' or 'Home Improvement'.)  Much of the activity takes place at night or in dimly lit rooms with windows covered over; unlike Seasons 1 and 3, I can't remember a single cheerful, outdoor daylight scene in the second season, and all this mirrors the moody, turbulent events that take place.It's dense and economical in the amount of material that it covers in one season, making use of each episode to weave together two, sometimes three, story elements that ""resonate back and forth,"" as series creators Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz describe the structure.  It cannot be watched half-way or between bathroom trips, because just as much happens on the characters' faces as in what they do and say, and the performances from the cast are critical to how this works.  Most viewers of 'Once and Again' will no doubt recall Claire Danes' emergence in 'My So-Called Life'; here we get two such revelations, with Julia Whelan and Evan Rachel Wood.  Whelan consistently animates her Grace with complexities that most actors never achieve, and in the masterful episode ""Food for Thought,"" Wood makes it absolutely clear why she is the best actor of her generation.  Her performance here is as powerful as I've seen from a television or film actor of any age.  A lesser cast would have been acted off the screen by these two rising stars, but the sets of 'Once and Again' are fully carpeted with wall-to-wall masters of the subtlety needed for this kind of drama -- people like Jeff Nordling, Susanna Thompson (Does it say something that both exes are played by actors who are highly skilled in stage combat?), Marin Hinkle, Bill Campbell, and Sela Ward, at her best. Reviewers don't always mention Shane West and Meredith Deane, but they're both very good, adding authentic, original textures to characters who could easily have been treated as afterthoughts.  Deane, in particular, is almost supernaturally precocious as she articulates the ambitiously written character of Zoe.  The antithesis of the well-coached but ineffectual child actor, she keeps up with the adult writers at every turn by making her lines seem as if they are not the words of a grown-up but rather her own.  She is one of the many delights of the series.So much happens, and I love the way the writers leave much unsaid. Example: When Lily discovers that Carla has stolen prescription medication from her, she goes to Carla's house to speak with her parent/guardian and meets a woman (perhaps Lily's own age) who's dealing with a crying baby, and the writers do not insult our intelligence by suggesting whose baby it is. There's the brilliant ""Thieves Like Us"" episode, which I adore and treasure for many reasons. (Watch how Rick reacts when his cell phone rings unexpectedly as he's letting the air out of those tires.) I also think of Paul, whom Judy dated briefly, then dumped, only to be haunted by suspicions that he had now begun stalking her.  When Jake confronts him at the restaurant, we do not know whether he was behind the phone calls or the incident at the bookstore, and the creepiness of not knowing reminds us of how such things often go in our own lives. As usual, it's spot-on in rendering those dark, unsettling moments of modern life and showing us how we're not safe anytime, anywhere, from our own character flaws and grim paranoias.One of the most overlooked elements by which 'Once and Again' achieves its authenticity is the direction.  Watch how the cameras in this show capture people moving and occupying space, not only within shots but within the interiors of homes, businesses, schools.  They lean against kitchen counters, drape themselves on furniture, and perch awkwardly on stairways.  They talk while they take out the trash; they brush their teeth and spit in the sink.  The camera almost never circles around in that highly stylized Hollywood way that makes you feel like you're missing something, but rather, it sits still and quietly shows what it needs to show, putting the viewer inside the room with the characters.  Sometimes you see corners of rooms for the first time and think, ""Oh, so that's what's over there.""  It has the effect of making the people and settings seem more real than they usually seem on TV -- so real, in fact, that some fans have drawn floorplans of Lily's house, with astonishing detail and accuracy.  It is a testament to the greatness of the actors and writers that what happens in these places seems worthy of such adoration.'Once and Again' is a towering fictional achievement, and the superb second season, in my mind, really anchors the series and gives it gravity, so that the third season has a feeling of weight and time behind it that makes it so rewarding when, toward the end, beautiful things start to happen to some of the people we've seen suffer so much.",5,"If you like the second season, you're a real fan.",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,5127,"['Ah', 'second', 'season',

904698,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009F43FY,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","The biggest difference between Season One and Two of ONCE AND AGAIN is that while Season One continually came back to Rick and Lily's romance as the anchor of the show, Season Two shifted the action to the characters as a whole.  If Season One was all about Billy Campbell and Sela Ward, along with their extensive supporting cast, Season Two saw the cast transform into a true ensemble.  Instead of Rick and Lily's story overshadowing all others, there are multiple fascinating storylines.  This would change even more in Season Three when their story would frequently not even be the primary one.What I like about ONCE AND AGAIN is that it is a family drama that isn't, like the endless teen-oriented dramas on the WB and the CW.  You get shows like GOSSIP GIRL where the adults are thrown in almost as afterthoughts, or other shows where the adults behave in ways that are almost like you imagine teens think adults behave.  But ONCE AND AGAIN at no point, even in the arcs focusing on kids, feels like a teen drama.  The show also displays a rare intelligence in its writing.  The show does not often resort to clich&eacute; or hackneyed story, and often had some nicely fresh arcs.The only thing I really dislike about this series are the black and white ""asides,"" where character are interviewed away from the central action.  Sometimes these have a documentary feel.  Sometimes they have feel oddly disembodied, as if we have entered an astral plane of sorts.  Sometimes it feels like they are talking to a psychiatrist.  I just detest these digressions.  MY friend who is a huge ONCE AND AGAIN fan doesn't dislike them as much as I do, but agrees that they are exceedingly odd.It is absurd that these DVDs are out of print.  I have only been able to see this thanks to one of my closest friends who not only has Seasons One and Two on DVD but who has recorded Season Three.  If not for her, I would not have been able to see the entire series.  She has for years been checking over and again whether ONCE AND AGAIN will ever see Season Three out on DVD.  Frankly, I would like to own my own copies of all three seasons.  So now I'm hoping for the whole thing to be issued/reissued on DVD.  It is a shame that this fine show was cancelled prematurely.  Now it is a shame that it isn't available at all.

This is a fantastic show with a very loyal fanbase and we will buy the third season the very second it comes out.  A few more extras and perhaps some behind-the-scenes, alternate scenes, and deleted scenes would be great as well.Season 2 unlike season 1 brings the kids, particularly Julia Whelan and Evan Rachel Wood together, working out this strange new relationship that's being thrust upon them by their dating parents - future step-sisters.  I am simply amazed at the incredible talent these two girls, young women, display especially when you consider the emotional moutains and valleys they had to traverse.  I know some adults who who display only two emotions; mad and apathetic.  Whelan and Wood are well-matched as conflicted characters.What's brilliant is that as Wood's character, Jessie, is thrust into her first year of high school (yeah, I noticed they aged her up two or three years from season 1) and thrust into a new relationship with the Mannings; Lily, Judy, Grace, and Zoe.  With each of the Mannings Wood makes us see perfectly which role she assigns them (all subtextually).  With Lily she sees the enemy because this is the woman who is the ""new"" mom, Judy is the cool aunt who relates to Jessie and her issues, Zoe is the younger sister who is just happy to have someone new to be with.  But it's with Grace that Jessie finds herself the most conflicted with.  As with high school she wants to feel like she ""fits in"" and she works this out via Grace's approval or disapproval.  When she finds anger with something the Manning's have done or something in her life is embarassing (therapy), it is through Grace she pits all her ire.  When she's happy she looks to Grace to confirm that it is something she should be happy with.It is too bad this show was cancelled.
