1197252,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001GKJ2DO,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Mamma Mia / B001GKJ2DYI'm generally not a fan of ""jukebox musicals"" - musicals that are based around a group of pre-existing songs, with a loosely strung-together plot to connect the dots between the songs on the soundtrack. I went into Mamma Mia not realizing that it was a jukebox musical for ABBA songs, and I left disappointed.Not that there's anything wrong with the songs on here - they're catchy and upbeat, if you like that sort of thing - that is, if you like ABBA. If you're not here for the ABBA songs, though, the musical comes off as flimsy and anemic - with several plot points seemingly out of place, largely in order to lead into another ABBA song. Indeed, without the basic understanding that ""Mamma Mia"" is a jukebox musical, a lot of songs feel strangely out of place - ""Honey, Honey"", in particular, seems oddly sensual for a young woman to be fantasizing about her mother's lovers. The setting and timeline, too, are badly muddled - the musical takes place in Greece, but ""Mamma Mia!"" carries Italian overtones, and ""Our Last Summer"" wistfully places them in France when, to judge from all other plot points, they weren't. Mama mia, but this is very confusing to a viewer not in the know.If you really like ABBA songs, you may enjoy this musical, but I found the soundtrack to be the strongest feature of this movie. The actual plot itself is very flimsy, and often feels like an excuse to rush to the next song. The acting and singing is superb, and the movie is well-cast, but it's hard to hang a meaningful, compelling plot on a handful of catchy dance songs.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Jukebox Musical... not for everyone.,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,1596,"['Mamma', 'Mia', '/', 'B001GKJ2DYI', ""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'fan', 'jukebox', 'musicals', 'musicals', 'are', 'based', 'group', 'pre-existing', 'songs', 'loosely', 'strung-together', 'plot', 'connect', 'dots', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'went', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'not', 'realizing', 'was', 'jukebox', 'musical', 'ABBA', 'songs', 'left', 'disappointed.Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'songs', 'here', ""'re"", 'catchy', 'upbeat', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'like', 'ABBA', ""'re"", 'not', 'here', 'ABBA', 'songs', 'though', 'musical', 'off', 'flimsy', 'anemic', 'several', 'plot', 'points', 'seemingly', 'place', 'largely', 'order', 'lead', 'ABBA', 'song', 'Indeed', 'basic', 'understanding', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'jukebox', 'musical', 'lot', 'songs', 'feel', 'strangely', 'place', 'Honey', 'Honey', 'particular', 'oddly', 'sensual', 'young', 'woman', 'be', 'fantasizing', 'mother', 'lovers', 'setting', 'timeline', 'too', 'are', 'badly', 'muddled', 'musical', 'place', 'Greece', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Italian', 'overtones', 'Last', 'Summer', 'wistfully', 'France', 'when', 'judge', 'other', 'plot', 'points', 'were', ""n't"", 'Mama', 'mia', 'very', 'confusing', 'viewer', 'not', 'know.If', 'really', 'ABBA', 'songs', 'may', 'enjoy', 'musical', 'found', 'soundtrack', 'be', 'strongest', 'feature', 'movie', 'actual', 'plot', 'very', 'flimsy', 'often', 'feels', 'excuse', 'rush', 'next', 'song', 'acting', 'singing', 'superb', 'movie', 'well-cast', 'hard', 'hang', 'meaningful', 'compelling', 'plot', 'handful', 'catchy', 'dance', 'songs.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

1197254,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001GKJ2DO,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","This poorly made, highly obnoxious and often annoying musical is so over-the-top with deliciously tacky charm that it almost demands you enjoy it.  The scary thing is that, for the most part, I did.  I remember turning to my wife after the film had ended and muttering the words ""that was awkward"" and maybe that is part of the charm.  No one seems entirely comfortable with their role in this film, and that layer of discomfort kind of adds a tinge of adorableness to the film and its vast array of characters.That doesn't mean that this is a good movie, just a fun one.The story is of young Sophie who lives on this crazy island with her single mother who runs a hotel on the verge of a breakdown.  When Sophie decides to get married she wants to have her father walk her down the isle (what young girl doesn't).  There is just one problem; she doesn't know who he is.  After reading her mother's diary she discovers that there are three possibilities; Sam, Bill or Harry.  She decides to invite all of them to her wedding in order to discover who her father really is, but when they arrive she realizes that finding him is going to be harder than she thought.The film is ridiculous and just a hodgepodge of overzealous musical numbers that are so focused on zany choreography that they forget the most important aspect of a musical number is the singing.Despite this, I cannot say I was not entertained.The best acting award goes to Streep (is that really a surprise).  She is so over-the-top yet thoroughly committed so that even when she's all over the place it is in a good way.  She is clearly having a blast filming this and it shows all over her face.  Surprisingly, young Amanda Seyfried actually holds her own and delivers a nicely tuned performance.  It doesn't hurt that out of the entire cast they are the only two who can sing (Streep has a few pitch problems but she actually soars on her final number).  Christine Baranski is funny, as is Walters.  Colin Firth is, well, Colin Firth (you gotta love this guy) and Stellan Skarsgard (who I've been a fan of for some time) delivers one of the more sympathetic `fatherly' performances.Pierce Brosnan is a revelation here, and not in a good way.  His voice is GOD-AWFUL (he sounds like a dying walrus, or a drowning man with Down syndrome; take your pick).  I'm really surprised they allowed him to sing his own songs (I'm really surprised they didn't recast the whole film to be honest beings that the two female leads are the only ones who somewhat make it through this film with dignity).His Razzie was certainly owed him.Don't expect a good film (I hope you aren't), but do expect to have a good time.  I can see why this is so loved, for it is lovable.  It is very poorly made (even the dancing numbers seem choppy and sloppy), but Streep does wonders for the film to be honest.  Her ability to just throw caution to the wind and embrace the campy mess that she has been dealt simply draws in the audience and lets them know that it's okay to turn off your brain and have a good time.Even Meryl Streep knows that this movie is horrible.",3,"Mamma mia, this was awkward...",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,3103,"['poorly', 'made', 'highly', 'obnoxious', 'often', 'annoying', 'musical', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'deliciously', 'tacky', 'charm', 'almost', 'enjoy', 'scary', 'thing', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'remember', 'turning', 'wife', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'muttering', 'words', 'was', 'awkward', 'maybe', 'part', 'charm', 'one', 'entirely', 'comfortable', 'role', 'film', 'layer', 'discomfort', 'kind', 'tinge', 'adorableness', 'film', 'vast', 'array', 'characters.That', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'fun', 'one.The', 'story', 'young', 'Sophie', 'who', 'crazy', 'island', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'hotel', 'verge', 'breakdown', 'When', 'Sophie', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'father', 'walk', 'isle', 'what', 'young', 'girl', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'problem', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'reading', 'mother', 'diary', 'are', 'three', 'possibilities', 'Sam', 'Bill', 'Harry', 'invite', 'wedding', 'order', 'discover', 'who', 'father', 'really', 'when', 'arrive', 'finding', 'going', 'be', 'harder', 'thought.The', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'just', 'hodgepodge', 'overzealous', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'so', 'focused', 'zany', 'choreography', 'forget', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'musical', 'number', 'singing.Despite', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'entertained.The', 'best', 'acting', 'award', 'Streep', 'really', 'surprise', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'yet', 'thoroughly', 'committed', 'so', 'even', 'when', 'place', 'good', 'way', 'clearly', 'having', 'blast', 'filming', 'face', 'Surprisingly', 'young', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'actually', 'own', 'nicely', 'tuned', 'performance', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'Streep', 'few', 'pitch', 'problems', 'actually', 'final', 'number', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'funny', 'Walters', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'well', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'guy', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'time', 'one', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'fatherly', 'performances.Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'revelation', 'here', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'voice', 'GOD-AWFUL', 'dying', 'walrus', 'drowning', 'man', 'Down', 'syndrome', 'take', 'pick', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'allowed', 'sing', 'own', 'songs', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'recast', 'whole', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'beings', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'somewhat', 'make', 'film', 'dignity', '.His', 'Razzie', 'was', 'certainly', 'owed', 'him.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'good', 'film', 'hope', 'are', ""n't"", 'do', 'expect', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'loved', 'lovable', 'very', 'poorly', 'made', 'even', 'dancing', 'numbers', 'seem', 'choppy', 'sloppy', 'Streep', 'wonders', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'ability', 'just', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'embrace', 'campy', 'mess', 'been', 'dealt', 'simply', 'draws', 'audience', 'know', 'okay', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'have', 'good', 'time.Even', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'movie', 'horrible']",N/A

ABBA was at their apex of popularity when I was in college, and hearing this music brought back fun memories.  I thought that the director, writers, choreographers, and sound engineers did a grand job of synchronizing the music, dance, and storyline.The setting for the film is exotic.  The storyline is interesting, and the acting is engaging and fun.  The singing is good for the most part, though my HS aged drama-choir kids seem to gain a sort of pleasure from mocking Pierce Brosnan's solos.  Granted, his solos are probably the weakest link in the show.

The fact that I hadn't seen the stage-play (by the same name) probably added to my surprise.Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried,House, M.D.) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding. Stumbling upon her mother's diary, Sophie finds three candidates that might be her dad. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep,The Devil Wears Prada) has no idea that her daughter has invited three of her former loves to the wedding. And when they arrive, paternal sparks go a-flying, as do the flickers of old romances. Harry (Colin Firth) comes to the wedding out of fear that he'd done something and then left it undone (i.e., not properly fathering his daughter). Bill (Stellan Skarsgard,Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End) comes simply because he's curious. But Sam (Pierce Brosnan,The Matador) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to ABBA!).The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters,Becoming Jane) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.One of the final songs on the track (""Take a Chance on Me"") is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered. This one's a surprisingly good film, even for those folks who aren't into ABBA.",4,"""Take A Chance On"" Mamma Mia...",1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2806,"['Who', ""'d"", 'thought', 'thatABBAsongs', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'operatic', 'Certainly', 'not', 'fact', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stage-play', 'same', 'name', 'probably', 'added', 'surprise.Being', 'fan', 'Swedish', 'rock', 'group', '70s', '80s', 'was', 'doubly', 'surprised', 'find', 'enjoying', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'small', 'measure', 'was', 'enjoyment', 'thanks', 'all-star', 'cast', 'doubt', 'also', 'how', 'well', 'incorporated', 'songs', 'were', 'story.The', 'story', 'worthy', 'Shakespearean', 'comedy', 'high', 'confusion', 'paternal', 'bonds', 'question', 'lady-love', 'finding', 'way', 'audiences', 'heart', 'unusual', 'ways', 'story', 'time', 'Sophie', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'House', 'M.D', 'desire', 'find', 'true', 'father', 'wedding', 'Stumbling', 'mother', 'diary', 'Sophie', 'three', 'candidates', 'might', 'be', 'dad', 'mother', 'Donna', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'idea', 'daughter', 'invited', 'three', 'former', 'loves', 'wedding', 'when', 'arrive', 'paternal', 'sparks', 'go', 'a-flying', 'do', 'flickers', 'old', 'romances', 'Harry', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'wedding', 'fear', ""'d"", 'done', 'something', 'then', 'left', 'undone', 'i.e.', 'not', 'properly', 'fathering', 'daughter', 'Bill', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'World', 'End', 'simply', 'curious', 'Sam', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Matador', 'burning', 'love-gone-by', 'Donna', 'when', 'Donna', 'out', 'three', 'old', 'flames', 'have', 'arrived', 'wedding', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'mixed', 'toe-tapping', 'music', 'Gah', 'Toe-tapping', 'ABBA', 'other', 'element', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'old', 'work', 'friends', 'Donna', 'were', 'trio', 'singers', 'one', 'time', 'who', 'arrive', 'wedding', 'find', 'Donna', 'frazzled', 'state', 'Rosie', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'active', 'playful', 'one', 'plenty', 'spunk', 'Tanya', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'sexual', 'over-achiever', 'who', 'fight', 'off', 'advances', 'few', 'young', 'island', 'abound', 'movie', 'down', 'One', 'person', 'closet', 'two', 'others', 'find', 'love', 'even', 'one', 'running', 'away', 'possible', 'commitment', 'Donna', 'might', 'find', 'love', 'arms', 'one', 'old', 'flames', 'Sophie', 'wedding', 'change', 'venue.One', 'final', 'songs', 'track', 'Take', 'Chance', 'Me', 'extremely', 'funny', 'well', 'thought-out', 'credits', 'roll', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'get', 'watch', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'try', 'dance', 'skin-tight', 'sequined', 'outfit', 'other', 'main', 'players', 'film', 'final', 'positive', 'note', 'movie', 'be', 'director', 'Phyllida', 'Lloyd', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'huge', 'stage', 'production', 'success', 'translation', 'stage', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'well-rendered', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'folks', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'ABBA']",N/A

Or, maybe I should say they went to see it with me!To begin with, my Mom didn't know it featured ABBA music - and who knew - she doesn't like ABBA! Oops. So, this movie was not her favorite thing. In fact, she left the theater before the great credit performance. One of the best things, IMO.My sister doesn't like musicals. Oops, I did it again. Guess I could have chosen some more likely-to-like-it companions for this theater visit, eh? Well, at least she was a great sport and laughed at herself - and maybe even at parts of the movie!Now, me. I. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.It is, as my title says, a total cheese-fest. It is. But when you're having so much fun, who CARES?!? It's campy and silly and there's some definite over-acting going on, but so what? It's brilliant.

I like ABBA, and sometimes musicals are fun, like Chicago.  I didn't realize that by the end of it I'd want to stab myself and then blow myself up for good measure.  It was sickeningly embarrassing, the least of which was the singing, which yes, was atrocious.  Everything from the costuming to the direction to even the g-damn dance numbers left me exhausted and angry.  The casting was ridiculous.  Watching tired-looking bony horse-faced Christine Baranski fend off a young hottie while her bathing suit emphasized her wrinkled chest defied belief.  She's an attractive actress with a lot of brash sex appeal normally; couldn't they have made her look a little better?  Did Meryl have it in her contract that the other actresses couldn't outshine her luminous (goaty-looking) beauty?  And don't get me started on poor mannish elfin Julie Walters.  Watching her wrinkle up her face in song resembling an uncomfortable monkey and dry hump the air in her bad ugly hairdo with her short lumpy body encased in frumpy grandma clothes was beyond disgusting. I understand the premise that ""middle aged women are vibrant and horny too!!!"", but how these poor actresses were costumed only seemed to mock that.

1197282,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B001GKJ2DO,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 3]","Agnetha F&auml;ltskog, Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad are the  ""A's"" and ""B's"" that comprise Abba. Though it was also the name of a canned fish company, Abba made it their own, and became an international sensation with a catalogue of hits built on catchy hooks and a wall-of-sound made of up of multi-tracked harmonies from Agnetha and Anni-Frid.Two fans wanted to base a musical on Abba songs--stringing the tunes together with a little plot to give it a very slight pretext. The band was at first cold to the idea, but the fan/musical producers prevailed, and after many, many performances, and now a movie, Abba has come around.------------------Sophie: [reading Donna's diary] We danced on the beach, kissed on the beach and dot, dot, dot.=================================Mamma Mia! was wildly successful, but lots of critics took aim, some calling it the worst movie of the year. I think that Mamma Mia! appealed to an untapped older audience nostalgic for the days when Dancing Queen ruled the airwaves and the dance hall. I think it was more like a Fantasy Camp for actors who always secretly wanted to be rock stars, and also wanted a chance to get away to a luscious Greek Island. It is like singing Abba at a Karaoke bar--and what is the point of judging it on the basis of the singing? It is the fun factor that is paramount. The people were having so much fun making the movie that you can't help but be caught up in the festive mood. What does Meryl Streep have to prove as an actress? Did you want to see if she could master yet another accent, and emote flawlessly, as if it were her native tongue? Don't you think she could do that blindfolded in her sleep with one hand tied behind her back?----------------Donna: And welcome to- to Sophie's dad. I have to tell you, he is here.Sophie: I know, I invited him.Donna: You couldn't have, I don't even know which one it is.=====================================Meryl Streep's acting was bad, but it was fun to watch her let her hair down and just have fun. How often do you get to see Streep, master thespian that she is, act badly? Pierce Brosnan signed up on the strength of her name alone, without even reading the script. Was he disappointed that she didn't bring her ""A"" Game? No, he was relieved that his acting wouldn't have to be judged in comparison. It was bad enough that of the whole cast, he was judged the weakest singer.Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgrd were the three men from Donna Sheridan's past who might be Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried's) dad. Skarsgrd was the token Swede, and I am only mentioning him at all since I wanted to make use of my Umlaut font set, but I was glad to have him there, as after all, Abba was a Swedish group. The three possible fathers were more than adequate to their roles.----------------Donna: Wh-wh what are you all doing here?Bill: I'm writing a travel piece.Harry Bright: I- I'm on a spontaneous holiday.Sam Carmichael: I-I-I I just dropped in to say... hi.===============================The three woman, led by Streep, were really great. Here is some interesting background trivia. The women who wrote Mamma Mia based the character of Tanya on Mary Ann, a character played by Christine Baranski on Cybill Shepherd's eponymously titled sit com. No wonder Christine Baranski was perfectly cast as Tanya, and the catharsis is complete.---------------------------Tanya: [talking about Donna's money troubles and her life in general] Yeah, but are you being taken care of?Donna: What do you mean?Tanya: Are you getting any?Donna: Oh, you mean...[turns on the screw driver, making loud noises, then says to the screw driver:]Donna: Down, boy.===================================Julie Walters as Rosie was also a little show stealer.------------------------Rosie: [to Tanya] Typical isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad and then three come along at once.============================================So, if you want to pass judgment on a movie and fault it for bad singing, bad acting, and over or under exposed film, then by all means throw those rotten tomatoes. But if you want to have fun, fun, fun 'til your daddy takes your T-Bird away, then what are you waiting for? Mamma Mia!SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF MERYL STREEPThe Devil Wears Prada(2006) ....

It sounds exactly like the original played by ABBA.- The scenes are beautiful with the sea, mountain, beach, sunshine and houses on the mountain.- There are many hilarious scenes too. For instance, Meryl Streep was carried away while singing Mama Mia and fell through a hole. Another is where an older lady flirted with a younger, brown guy. One more is where multiple guys dancing on the pier with their diving fins.- Out of 18 songs in this movie, I love 13 of them. They are: Honey Honey, Money, Mama Mia, Chiquitita, Dancing Queen, Lay All Your Love on Me, Super Trouper, Vouler Vous, SOS, The Winner Takes It All, When All Is Said and Done, Take a Chance on Me, I Have a Dream.- According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production Budget was $52 million.Domestic gross:  $144,130,063+ Foreign gross  $465,711,574= Worldwide gross $609,841,637So it's profit was more than 10 times its cost.The NOT SO GOOD- Some of the songs are incomplete or interrupted with dialogues. This is really annoying because I need to listen to the whole song to completely enjoy it. For example, in the scene of Chiquitita song, the last sentence was omitted. It's replaced with the dialogues between Meryl Streep and her two girlfriends. The director should have the song completely sung before continuing with the actors' conversation.Another is in the scene of Gimme Gimme song. It is broken into 3 pieces by the actors' conversation. That makes it much less enjoyable.- It does not have Karaoke version. That means there's no scene with only instrumental music. So, you have to sing along. You can't sing  Karaoke.- Of course, it's a musical film, so, please don't expect any logic and character development.Well, nothing is perfect. In short, every Karaoke fan or person who loves singing should have one copy. I'm singing along and dancing with this DVD once a month now.

1197303,A1WK8A9S73T3J0,B001GKJ2DO,DA,"[0, 0]","Review for 70's disco band ABBA and the piecemeal grouping of their songs into a show - mouthwash to get the sugary taste out of my mouth and reading a book to make up for the lost I.Q. points - not good. And you can't blame the era, because I would argue Tommy by The Who was near the same time period but didn't feel like the equivalent of babysitting a bunch of 11 year old girls. And sure musicals about promiscuity are some of the best and most respected musicals out there, thank you Camelot and Into the Woods, but I guess this did a good job of summarizing the carefree attitude of the '70s decade, which I'm not sad that I missed.As for the movie I think it was a very good effort on the part of the cast for acting and singing. Meryl Streep had so much energy, at least some of it made it look as though she were genuinely having fun. She and Amanda Seyfried did an excellent job singing for non-singers. Most of the principal males had a little trouble with their songs, but they were pretty well perfectly cast for their parts anyway, no reason to complain. I get this was about dancing and singing, but there were times when there were close ups of singing and there was too much action. Twitching even? It's hard to be expressive with your face when you should be expressive with your voice, and some of the extraneous movement was disconcerting. A director should have told them to stop wiggling so much during those certain scenes. Even having the actors in question watch a musical or stage performance of a professional singer to learn how to hold their bodies and their faces and appendages while performing might have alleviated some of that.The chorus was spot on most of the time for comic relief. There was a lot of pleasant and fun humor in the dances. However much of the story involving the older set of ladies was very blue collar humor, and it really made them all the more pathetic. Set and costume design was strikingly good, even if you haven't been to Greece you can get the feeling you've visited from the vibrant seaside decor and colors used here.Don't think it's spoiling too much to say the daughter makes the ""right"" choice at the end to not go through with getting married, just like her mother did years before her.

Reed,"[3, 4]","Before this movie, the only ABBA songs I knew were Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia and Fernando and thought they were merely a group from the seventies with a few hits and faded into obscurity. And when I bought the soundtrack for my mother for her birthday, I wondered how anybody in they're right mind could construct a musical around the songs of a pop group. So every year, there are movies that I set aside to see when they come out. This, originally, wasn't one of them. But after Indiana Jones, Get Smart, The Dark Knight, and The Mummy (which were all great don't get me wrong) but after all that action, maybe I needed something different. So I went to the theatre, with my mom and sister so as not to feel out of place amongst the miriade of women that would be in attendance, and didn't really expect much. I had the time of my life and this was absolutely one of the most wonderful experiences I ever had at the movies. The cast was amazing: I never saw Meryl Streep in a film before besides her cameo in the god awful Series of Unfortunate Events film adaptation and she astounded me with her voice (especially on her rendition of The Winner Takes It All). Pierce Brosnan was the biggest surprise to me (cause I never imagined a former James Bond being in a musical) but he too had a good singing voice (all of you people who says he can't just shut up and keep your opinions to yourselves. The ones who've criticized him probably have horrible voices themselves and just can't admit it). Her face and voice was familiar but I just couldn't place where I'd seen Christine Baranski before and then I remembered her supporting roles in Addams Family Values and The Grinch. And I couldn't believe that Amanda Seyfried played the dumb girl in Mean Girls so that too was a surprise. All in all it was a movie that made me feel good when I walked out of the theatre (aside from The Dark Knight, something that hardly happens) and the first real musical I've seen (I count The Blues Brothers films but they really aren't a traditional musical when you compare it to this.

1197312,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001GKJ2DO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 8]","""Mamma Mia! The Movie"", the film adaptation from the jukebox musical by British playwright Catherine Johnson and featuring the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (both the male members of the group).  In 1999, the musical has brought in over $2.0 billion in earnings (becoming the highest grossing musical of all time)and what better than to have a film adaptation a decade later.With Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson producing the film, ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" would be directed by British director Phyllida Lloyd and a screenplay by Catherine Johnson.  The film adaptation would feature an all-star cast starring Meryl Streep (""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Adaptation"", ""The Devil Wears Prada""), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007 films, ""The Thomas Crown Affair""), Colin Firth (""The English Patient"", ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Shakespeare in Love""), Stellan Skarsgard (""Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End"", ""Beowulf and Grendel"", ""Dogville), Julie Walters (Harry Potter films, ""Becoming Jane"", ""Billy Elliot) and Christine Baranski (""Happy Family"", ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", ""Chicago"") and a film that would jumpstart the careers of Amanda Seyfried (""Mean Girls"", ""Veronica Mars"") and Dominic Cooper (""The Duchess"").The film which cost $52 million would earn over $609 million worldwide in the box office making the film one of the top 50 highest grossing films of all time and the distinction of the highest grossing movie musical in the world.""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" showcases the music of ABBA and features all main talent taking part in singing of the songs.  Included are:1. ""I Have A Dream"" - Sophie2. ""Honey, Honey"" - Sophie, Ali, and Lisa3.

""Thank You for the Music"" - SophieVIDEO:""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1).  ""Mama Mia! The Movie"" is quite interesting presentation.  For one, the film is shot in Greece and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  But there is also an artistic element that cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos brought to the film (Director Phyllida Lloyd goes more into wanting a dramatical effect for the film through experimental shooting during day and night).  From scenes overlooking the ocean at night with the beautiful black and blues, to the shots of the wedding as lights are seen going up to the church area.  Absolute beautiful!But it's also important to note that Zambarloukos went with colors that are high in contrast at times and colors that may seem a bit oversaturated  at times but for the most part, it added to the vibrancy of the film  and looks incredible on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and comes clear from the front and center channels but the film is obviously going to be musically driven and one is not going to hear an aggressive soundtrack.  Music sounds good but not great as the lossless soundtrack is not as immersive as I would have wanted it to be.  I didn't notice the surround or rear channels being utilized throughout the film.  So, it would have been great if the mix would have incorporated those channels.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" comes with the following special features:** The Making of Mamma Mia! - (24:05) Featuring three features on the making of the film: Birthing Mamma Mia!, The Filmmaking and The Cast.* Deleted Musical Number - ""The Name of the Game"" - (2:57) The deleted musical scene featuring Amanda Seyfried and Stellan Skarsgard's character.* Anatomy of a Musical Number - ""Lay All Your Love On Me"" - (5:42) The making of ""Lay All Your Love On Me"" and Dominic Cooper who is not a singer talks about his experience recording the song and shooting the scene near the beach.* Becoming a Singer - (10:55) Benny Anderson (of ABBA) talks about wanting to bring the musicians together in making the music for the film.  Anderson and Ulvaeus talk about working with the talent and the talents talk about their experience working with the ABBA stars for the film and footage of the recordings of the music at the studio.  The male talent who are not known for singing talk about being worried in recording the music.* A Look Inside Mamma Mia!

The Movie"" since ""Grease"".  I absolutely felt that Amanda Seyfried shined throughout this film.  Seyfried is absolutely radiant in this fim and since the theatrical release of ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"", I have been quite impressed by her work.  She's an amazing actress with so much depth and she shows what she is capable of in ""Mamma Mia!"", definitely far from what we have seen of her in ""Mean Girls"" and ""Veronica Mars"".And Meryl Streep, what a brilliant performance.  It's one thing for Streep to be known as a wonderful award winning actress but somehow there was this synergy that went through the cast and but especially for Meryl Streep, she was electrifying and had so much energy, I was impressed.The cast was absolutely fun to watch and although some of the talent (specifically the male talent) are not known for singing, I suppose the film brought this naturalness to its characters.But it all comes down to the music of ABBA, especially if you enjoyed their music in the past.  For me, it was nostalgic as I grew up during the '70s and my parents were part of those disco years and part of my younger life was at home with plenty of people taking part in these disco parties.  So, the music of ABBA didn't bother me and in some ways, some songs really got me interested in how the original music sounds compared to the movie musical and songs such as ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"" surprised me because I thought the music was first created for Madonna's 2005 song ""Hung Up"".But there is so many things that came together for this film that I absolutely enjoyed.  The location was absolutely beautiful, the editing that helped enhance the musical numbers were well-done and as mentioned, the talents were just enjoyable to watch.  This was an enjoyable film that didn't require any seriousness or surrealistic plot, this was a straight-forward fun, vibrant film with an enjoyable cast.As for the Blu-ray, there are people who enjoy musicals and I know the music of ABBA and disco may be a bit much for some people expecting something along a similar path of movie musicals such as ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Chicago"" or ""Nine"" but ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is a film about having fun and being in love, and I suppose once can say that ABBA's music embodies that.  This is a gorgeous movie on Blu-ray and some may feel the film was too oversaturated for their taste but I felt that there was a sense of artistry in terms of cinematography.Overall, ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" is a wonderful musical on Blu-ray and if you are into musicals, especially the music of ABBA and want something more lively and fun, definitely give this Blu-ray release a try!  Recommended!",5,"Blu-ray:  A lively, fun and highly enjoyable musical!

She appeared wooden throughout.  Pierce Brosnan was a joke as a singer.  Perhaps with some genuine musical theater stars in the role, it may have worked.  Even so, I got so tired of its teeny-bopper mentality, even from the adults, that I soon came to understand why the late-night comedians made such fun of this film.  Is it a feel-good film?  Yes (my 81-year-old mother-in-law liked it), but much of the ""feel-good"" comes from laughing AT it.

The minute the movie started I could tell it was going to be a mess, with the cast in that ""Look at us--we're in a musical!"" mode. The lighting was so terrible, when scenes transitioned I kept thinking they were going to be dream sequences with the overly bright halo effect lighting that was scattered throughout the film.

I didn't have too high expectations when my mum dragged me along to see it in the theatre, I thought it would be just another desperate cheesy attempt from Hollywood to make money, having run out of original movie ideas, all they could think of was to make a movie out of a stage musical. Boy was I proven wrong big time! Not only were there a cast of well-known great actors, but the thing that surprised me the most was that Meryl Streep had an amazing singing voice, as did her ""daughter"" Amanda Seygfried whom to me was not heard of until I saw this movie. Starting off with the first pure, beautiful lines of ""I Have A Dream"" sung to perfection by Seygfried, we're off to a greek island with breathtaking scenery and the party is on, going from one Abba hit song to another, helping to run the story and you'll find yourself tapping your feet along to the beat, singing along to some of Abba's biggest hits being performed in this movie, surprisingly well-sung by a talented cast of actors (all except for Pierce Brosnan, who, in my opinion, should stick to acting). I bet they all must've had a lot of fun shooting this movie and it definitely shows by their great performances. Streep and Seygfried were the ones that stood out the most for me and I can now see why Meryl has gotten so much praise in the past, she definitely shows what an amazing actress she is in this movie and this has made me want to see other movies she's been in as well.

I never did enjoy a musical on the silver screen until I saw 'Mamma Mia'.  I actually went to see this movie for one thing and one thing only -- the MEN (well, two in particular: Brosnan and Firth).  I walked out of the movie theatre smiling, my 13-year-old daughter and I gushing about how awesome it was.  Yes, it's true, Brosnan can't sing but Firth has a decent enough voice (though he only did one number).  Streep, too, has a surprisingly good pair of lungs; her girl friends made for a strong supporting cast, both in the acting and the singing.  To those who don't think this movie is realistic, simple arithmatic will tell you that a 20-year-old girl in the 00s was NOT born of a relationship in the 70s!  So who cares?  It's just a fun movie -- watch it, enjoy it and stop mulling over every little detail!  I don't think the guys would enjoy this movie as much but, hey, we sit through enough shoot-'em-ups with them that they can watch this with us!

I love ABBA music and waited years for the popular musical Mamma Mia to make it to the big screen and now Mamma Mia on DVD.  I have never been a huge fan of Meryl Streep but she gives a wonderful virtuoso performance in this movie.  Same for newcomer Amanda Seyfried.  Neither actress is known for their singing ability, but are simply messmerizing in Mamma Mia.  ABBA's music is timeless and pure joy in this romantic lost and found musical love story.  If you look hard one of the original members of ABBA has a cameo in the movie; one of the two ""BB"" (Bjorn ans Benny) in the sensational signing group's name.  The on location photography is beautiful in this movie as the story unfolds.  The only fairly deserved criticism is the signing of the leading man (aka 007).  Pierce Bronsan is way below par compared to the rest of the cast, but still nails his character's (dramatic) performance in this who's who of a Father-Daughter-Mother love story.  If you've seen the play, the story is still the same, if not a bit over the top.  Still, the signing and even the dancing in the movie version is just as entertaining and enjoyable to the audience.  One thing for sure this movie cries out to be HEARD, so turn up the volume and delight in all the stirring melodies and lyrical music of ABBA.

1197338,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001GKJ2DO,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 6]","Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on thelong-running jukebox musicalfrom the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it wasSophie Zawistowski,Karen Blixen, orMiranda Priestly. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce calledBuona Sera Mrs Campbell, you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark and is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant filmmaking experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic ""Dancing Queen"" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and ""Money, Money, Money"", as well as the more emotive ballads like ""Slipping Through My Fingers"" and ""The Winner Takes It All"".  She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on ""S.O.S."" (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsgrd as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry - are also likeable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, ""I Have a Dream"". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of ""Dancing Queen"" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of ""Waterloo"" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook).

(If ever a gift could keep on giving right back to the givers)!Even though Meryl Streep is old enough to be a grandmother (and probably is), the camera never gets too close to her face, as she plays a barely middle-aged mother of a love-struck daughter on the verge of marriage. The daughter discovers that Mom was a bit wilder in her youth having made love to three men at approximately the same time. The plot unfolds when she decides to invite her ""fathers"" to the wedding without her mother's knowledge. MOMMA MIA!This is loosely based on a late 60's movie titled ""Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell,"" where the twist is that Gina Lollabrigitta tells three American World War II veterans that they are the father of her son. Their guilt and money provide for the same.

The music from this can be found on the CD for the movie (d'uh), or ABBA Gold, which has every one but, ""I do.""So, love me or leave me, but please don't deceive me, because I won't deceive you. Meryl Streep reveals her absolute depth in her performance. Her ending with her co-stars is a triumph of harmony on stage or at Waterloo where Napoleon did surrender. Pierce Brosnan's bellowing efforts might make you want to suck on a lemon while someone is running steel fingernails across a blackboard, but the movie is fun even in a rich man's world, or for a super trouper. The supporting cast was superb. I was particularly impressed with Julie Walters who played one of Meryl Streep's adult sidekicks. Christine Baranski was predictably good. I never imagined that Stellan Skaarsgard could kick up a storm the way he did.My gift included a trailer that allowed the viewer to see the making of the movie, and the songs being replayed in the movie with the words appearing, but without the bouncing ball. It helped me learn a lot of the correct words that men seem to have a harder time identifying them than women do when it comes to song. (Up to age 50, I thought Popeye was strong to the ""pinach"" cuz I eats me spinach).Do I recommend this DVD? I ask in all honesty, without a song or dance what are we? So I say thank you for the music, (and the DVD,) for giving it to me. Just remember there is no comparison between this and what you would see on Broadway, in Toronto or Peoria at Route 24, Junction 8, for that matter. The movie could only leave you disappointed. It is entertaining especially if you are forgiving of Streep and Brosnan not being singers.Thank you, Christian, Gabriella, Samuel Adam, and Emmanuel.Uncle EdFor Barrie Bracken.",4,"Take a Chance On Dot, Dot, Dot",1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,3257,"['two-year', 'old', 'great', 'nephew', 'was', 'derailing', 'runaway', 'Lionel', 'train', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'had', 'totally', 'wrecked', 'ranch-style', 'plastic', 'home', 'other', 'great', 'nephews', 'great', 'niece', 'were', 'exhorting', 'open', 'presents', 'brought', 'Knowing', 'had', 'seen', 'play', 'Broadway', 'three', 'times', 'once', 'Toronto', 'was', 'surprise', 'Momma', 'Mia', 'DVD', 'was', 'decorative', 'Christmas', 'paper', 'Oh', 'can', 'watch', 'Uncle', 'Ed', 'ever', 'gift', 'could', 'keep', 'giving', 'right', 'back', 'givers', 'Even', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'grandmother', 'probably', 'camera', 'never', 'too', 'close', 'face', 'barely', 'middle-aged', 'mother', 'love-struck', 'daughter', 'verge', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'Mom', 'was', 'bit', 'wilder', 'youth', 'having', 'made', 'love', 'three', 'men', 'approximately', 'same', 'time', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'when', 'invite', 'fathers', 'wedding', 'mother', 'knowledge', 'MOMMA', 'MIA', 'loosely', 'based', 'late', '60', 'movie', 'titled', 'Buona', 'Sera', 'Mrs.', 'Campbell', 'where', 'twist', 'Gina', 'Lollabrigitta', 'three', 'American', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veterans', 'are', 'father', 'son', 'guilt', 'money', 'provide', 'same', 'Only', 'here', 'setting', 'unnamed', 'Greek', 'isle', 'instead', 'Italy', 'mom', 'barely', 'scraping', 'running', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'charitably', 'called', 'inn.An', 'unabashed', 'ABBA', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'hit', 'over', 'again', 'could', 'play', 'day', 'play', 'when', 'am', 'good', 'mood', 'when', 'need', 'get', 'good', 'mood', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'CD', 'movie', ""d'uh"", 'ABBA', 'Gold', 'one', 'do', 'So', 'love', 'leave', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'deceive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deceive', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'absolute', 'depth', 'performance', 'ending', 'co-stars', 'triumph', 'harmony', 'stage', 'Waterloo', 'where', 'Napoleon', 'did', 'surrender', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'bellowing', 'efforts', 'might', 'make', 'want', 'suck', 'lemon', 'someone', 'running', 'steel', 'fingernails', 'blackboard', 'movie', 'fun', 'even', 'rich', 'man', 'world', 'super', 'trouper', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'adult', 'sidekicks', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'was', 'predictably', 'good', 'never', 'imagined', 'Stellan', 'Skaarsgard', 'could', 'kick', 'up', 'storm', 'way', 'gift', 'included', 'trailer', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'see', 'making', 'movie', 'songs', 'being', 'replayed', 'movie', 'words', 'appearing', 'bouncing', 'ball', 'helped', 'learn', 'lot', 'correct', 'words', 'men', 'seem', 'have', 'harder', 'time', 'identifying', 'women', 'do', 'when', 'song', 'age', '50', 'thought', 'Popeye', 'was', 'strong', 'pinach', 'cuz', 'eats', 'spinach', '.Do', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'ask', 'honesty', 'song', 'dance', 'what', 'are', 'say', 'music', 'DVD', 'giving', 'Just', 'remember', 'comparison', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'Broadway', 'Toronto', 'Peoria', 'Route', '24', 'Junction', '8', 'matter', 'movie', 'could', 'only', 'leave', 'disappointed', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'are', 'forgiving', 'Streep', 'Brosnan', 'not', 'being', 'singers.Thank', 'Christian', 'Gabriella', 'Samuel', 'Adam', 'Emmanuel.Uncle', 'EdFor', 'Barrie', 'Bracken']",N/A

If one is not an ABBA fan, then forget it. If one is a Colin Firth fan, it has only minutes of Colin at his funniest and most brilliant. ALL the actors sing well.If I may say so, the potshots taken at Pierce Brosnan for his singing are nasty and stupid. There is a very famous songwriter who insists on singing his own music, and his voice is far worse than Pierce's. And as I see in another review, Pierce STUDIED just to be able to sing. I do agree it was a bad decision to give him ""SOS"". He doesn't have the range for it.The cinematography is what one expects from a musical, come on! Did you expect Hitchcockian or Spielbergian work here? It's supposed to be fun. Perhaps the critics of this film are not old enough to know what's good and right. This film is definitely good and right. The storyline is NOT a pathetic contrivance-- SHAME ON YOU AMAZON-- because if one watches it, it touches, it works. That canned corn is from the old critiques of the Broadway version. No one could have staged this; as a film, it's magic. It was lovely purely to watch the actors clearly having the times of their lives!As a rule, I dislike musicals with all my might. I watched this film because of what it is, who's in it, and the music. I was never at any moment disappointed. Having just endured a death in the family, this movie was almost a salvation. I laughed, sang along, and rollicked until it was almost a desecration.It's been since 2000 since I saw a movie that made me act like that.And by the way, if you watch carefully, Sophie DOES learn who her actual father is--but don't expect the film itself to reveal it.One final thing about this plain DVD version: there are no extras to speak of; a deleted scene that is delightful but gives too much away, that's all.

Outside of the wonderfully talented young voice of Amanda Seyfried, I haven't heard singing this bad on film since Jack Nicholson in Tommy or George Burns in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Even though Meryl Streep should be given the ""Best Try"" award for looking like she was having a good time while not showing embarrassment, ""singers"" like Pierce Brosnan sound like they were soulless barking dogs and needed to be put out of their misery. Sure, visually the movie is a fun romp, but if I hear Meryl either sigh, cry, or moan during each song again, I swear I'm gonna buy me a chalkboard and scratch away. I find it hard to believe the Broadway play it's based on is so huge, but then again it's based on music that helped define a generation...just not mine.

Fortunately, however, there's enough of ABBA's irresistible and enduring music to pick up most of the pieces and to lift the entire cast to feel-good heights, making the cast themselves look like they are having a great time in basically a lavish ABBA karaoke-style party of a movie.  And it also helps that there's no weak link in the ABBA musical catalog, with my personal highlights being the lesser known gem ""Our Last Summer"" and, of course, Streep's undeniably solid and emotionally driven ""The Winner Takes It All,"" right from the side of a mountain!  The rest of the very likable and energetic cast includes Pierce Brosnan, who was unnecessarily chastised by critics for his actually very respectable singing (let's see a critic belt out ""S.O.S."" as good as Brosnan did!), as well as Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, the angelic Amanda Seyfried, and Dominic Cooper.  Another strength is its cinematic message that the older women and men in the leads can carry a movie just fine, thank you (as opposed to seemingly youth-targeted Hollywood).  No one can match the magic of the original ABBA music and singing, but this is probably the closest you can get without a genuine ABBA reunion.  Although it undoubtedly will be labeled a chick flick by most, if you like a feel-good movie with a happy ending, one that makes you want to watch it again and again, this one's made especially for you.

I consider myself a loyal ABBA's fan. I still remember how I heard their songs for the first time almost thirty years ago, how happy I was to be able to own their albums on LPs, how much I enjoyed ABBA: The Movie (1977) which came to Moscow in the beginning of the 1980s and was basically the record of their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. I also saw the famous musical Mamma Mia on which the last year movie is based on and I liked it a lot. It would not hurt if you can take with humor outrageous psychedelic outfits of the 1970s and the tight boots with the platforms so huge that it makes your feet hurt just to look at them. If that sounds like your idea of fun, fun you'll have. I sure did, at least for the first hour or to be precise until the very moment, Pierce Brosnan had ruined my favorite ABBA's song S.O.S by attempting to sing it. I guess it is sometimes easier to save the world from all sorts of evil than just to sing a song. While that torture lasted, I kept repeating instead of S.O.S, S.O.E which means Save Our Ears. I later found out that when asked during an interview why he took the role, Brosnan replied that when he heard from his agent, ""Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep"", he took it without asking whom he'd play. Well, acting next to Streep is a great reason, and I believe Brosnan had a lot of fun sharing the screen with her. I also believe that there is nothing impossible for Meryl. She can play anything and anybody. Just to think what she has done in all the movies she has graced with her presence. She did very convincing accents, she learned how to play a violin, she dances, she has been a villain and a saint, and everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie. While watching Mamma Mia, I got the crazy idea. What if Meryl played all six older characters, Donna, her two girlfriends and three men from her past? I know it sounds weird but if Eddie Murphy could do it, I am sure Meryl Streep could act and sing for six characters and she would be simply fabulous. Between Streep and young talented Amanda Seyfried, two of them made a nice singing/acting team. But even with Meryl playing and singing only one part, the film is still entertaining and fun mostly due to the fact that everyone involved had a good time on the charming little island, the serious actors were not afraid to make fools out of themselves for all of us to enjoy, and in the end everyone was happy and got what they wanted even if it was not exactly what they wanted in the beginning of the movie.",3,"Saving the world is easy, singing is difficult",1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2883,"['order', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'fan', 'least', 'ABBA', 'songs', 'whole', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'idea', 'just', 'excuse', 'letting', 'grateful', 'viewers/listeners', 'experience', 'favorite', 'songs', 'relaxing', 'feeling', 'good', 'setting', 'colorful', 'sunny', 'idyllic', 'Greek', 'isle', 'surrounded', 'bluest', 'sea', 'can', 'imagine', 'consider', 'loyal', 'ABBA', 'fan', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'heard', 'songs', 'first', 'time', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'how', 'happy', 'was', 'be', 'able', 'own', 'albums', 'LPs', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'ABBA', 'Movie', '1977', 'came', 'Moscow', 'beginning', '1980s', 'was', 'basically', 'record', 'concerts', 'Sydney', 'Melbourne', 'Perth', 'Adelaide', 'also', 'saw', 'famous', 'musical', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'last', 'year', 'movie', 'based', 'liked', 'lot', 'would', 'not', 'hurt', 'can', 'take', 'humor', 'outrageous', 'psychedelic', 'outfits', '1970s', 'tight', 'boots', 'platforms', 'so', 'huge', 'feet', 'hurt', 'just', 'look', 'idea', 'fun', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'have', 'sure', 'did', 'least', 'first', 'hour', 'be', 'precise', 'very', 'moment', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'had', 'ruined', 'favorite', 'ABBA', 'song', 'S.O.S', 'attempting', 'sing', 'guess', 'sometimes', 'easier', 'save', 'world', 'sorts', 'evil', 'just', 'sing', 'song', 'torture', 'lasted', 'kept', 'repeating', 'instead', 'S.O.S', 'S.O.E', 'Save', 'Ears', 'later', 'found', 'out', 'when', 'asked', 'interview', 'why', 'took', 'role', 'Brosnan', 'replied', 'when', 'heard', 'agent', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'took', 'asking', 'whom', ""'d"", 'play', 'Well', 'acting', 'next', 'Streep', 'great', 'reason', 'believe', 'Brosnan', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'sharing', 'screen', 'also', 'believe', 'nothing', 'impossible', 'Meryl', 'can', 'play', 'anything', 'anybody', 'Just', 'think', 'what', 'done', 'movies', 'graced', 'presence', 'did', 'very', 'convincing', 'accents', 'learned', 'how', 'play', 'violin', 'been', 'villain', 'saint', 'everybody', 'been', 'always', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'watching', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'got', 'crazy', 'idea', 'What', 'Meryl', 'played', 'six', 'older', 'characters', 'Donna', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'three', 'men', 'past', 'know', 'weird', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'could', 'do', 'am', 'sure', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'could', 'act', 'sing', 'six', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'Between', 'Streep', 'young', 'talented', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'two', 'made', 'nice', 'singing/acting', 'team', 'even', 'Meryl', 'playing', 'singing', 'only', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'still', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', 'everyone', 'involved', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'charming', 'little', 'island', 'serious', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'make', 'fools', 'enjoy', 'end', 'everyone', 'was', 'happy', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'beginning', 'movie']",N/A

1197366,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B001GKJ2DO,Giordano Bruno,"[1, 2]","A cold, gloomy, nasty afternoon in a hotel in Canada. Five hours until warm-up time in the orchestra pit. Take a walk? &iexcl;Ni modo, Quasimodo! Rent a flick? Why not!You'll have to believe me that I have no prior ABBA consciousness, despite the fact that I spent half my childhood in Sweden. I was in Mediterranean and Caribbean lands when they 'conquered' the Anglophone pop music world. I heard or read the name. Honestly, I thought they were another 'heavy metal' or Swedish vampyr band. I had no idea what they looked or sounded like. My wife tells me now that we danced to ABBA covers at innumerable family weddings over the past 25 years, but I never pay much attention when I'm trying to shake my booty without looking as dorky as I feel. Okay, do I suddenly love their music now, after seeing/hearing ""Mamma Mia!""? Well... it's bouncy and sweet, but no way will it displace Dufay or Scarlatti on my iPod. ABBA is musically as corny as their costumes -- a 1970s period piece. Apologies to their fans, and to all Swedes everywhere. Hurray for IKEA! Hurray for ABBA! Sweden needs all the export credits it can get.And now the movie review! The most artful thing about Mamma Mia is the integration of the songs and chorus-line numbers into the melodrama. Reviewer JP, whose recommendation of this film was responsible for me picking it up, commented on the ""Greek Chorus"" of Greeks serving as a human and musical backdrop for the jet set cast of English speakers. She's right, and it was effective. I'm so far out of touch with Broadway that I thought JP's praise of the music/drama blend sounded just like Bollywood. I've seen a lot of Bollywood films. I urged JP to have a look at Lagaan, one of my favs. Bottom line? Mamma Mia is almost... almost... as artful at squeezing into and out of musical extravaganzas as Bollywood, though the ABBA songs are less appealing. Keep practicing, USA! You'll catch up with India some day.The story? Mildly amusing, absolutely predictable, jolly enough to keep me watching. Merle Streep looks remarkably like my sister, or vice versa. I get a kick out of the resemblance, and I was delighted to see my 'sister' having so much fun in a role. Streep's enjoyment of her own feeble singing was infectious. I was tickled to watch my usually dour countryman, Stellan Skarsgrd, try to act zany. Zaniness is not intuitive for Swedes. Stellan and I look a lot alike, also, though I'm in better shape. I took a sardonic pleasure in watching him look hopelessly dorky when he danced. At the other extreme, the spark-plug friend of Mamma - I didn't catch her name, the tall one who can really sing and dance - is obviously a real Broadway-ite, and carried the film at times when others were looking vague about their blocking.

Ware Cornell Jr. ""anotherlawyer""","[11, 14]","Back in the eighties when ABBA packed the pop charts, Eddie Murphy's hilarious promotional parody ""Buckwheat Sings"" featured a black member of the Our Gang/Little Rascals ensemble. As living proof that reality can be stranger than Murphy, Pierce Brosnan, who famously stole the identity of Remington Steele in the 80s series of the same name, is cast as a putative father and singer in Mamma Mia! In this role, Brosnan unsuccessfully attempts to carry a tune in a bucket.First the good part-this is a gorgeous movie in Blu-ray. The blue and green hues of a Greek isle, festooned with red and purple flowers and sun-bleached masonry are breath-taking. Movies like this were truly meant to be enjoyed on Blu-ray.Now the bad part-high end audio quality does nothing to enhance the croak of Mr. Brosnan's voice. In fact the producers should have realized that before committing to a Blu-ray edition that accentuates the negatives of one of many casting catastrophes.Basically even though The Streep can sing, she (and her entourage of girlfriends and ex-boyfriends) are about fifteen years older than the plot credibly envisions. Nearly sixty-something women with twenty year old daughters had them either late in life or not at all. The premise after all is that Streep's daughter is about the same age as her mother when she was conceived by one of the three ex-boyfriends. Instead we see a Geritol-swigging parental generation dancing and singing with kids young enough to consider Leonardo diCaprio an elder statesman.All of this just goes to show that marquee stars alone cannot a film make.

So one day I was ""convinced"" to sit down and watch this film. And, because even manly men can channel their more refined dimensions (and without forfeiting their man card), I ended up digging MAMMA MIA and, dammit, even humming some of these Abba songs!The set-up goes like this: It's just before Sophie's wedding, and preparations are lively. But there's just one thing missing to make it all perfect: her father to give her away. All her life, Sophie had gone on, not knowing who her dad is. But then she stumbles upon her mother Donna's diary and discovers that her dad could be one of three possible men. All with whom, the diary states, her mother had spent time, with one thing leading to another, and dot dot dot... Unbeknownst to Donna, Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. And, then, fun shenanigans.For those who've signed up for FeelGoodology 101, know that the first thing the professor does in class is pop in this DVD. Say what you will about MAMMA MIA, kibitz about the campy elements or grouse that some or most of the cast can't carry a tune, but that doesn't alter the fact that this musical simply makes you feel good. I've never seen Meryl Streep in a role like this, which just goes to show that the woman can officially do anything in the acting gig. Pierce Brosnan, no, he can't sing, but so what? He, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard come in with good humor and grace. Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is so damn engaging and so hopefully wistful that she's the perfect choice to open the movie with, because her plight immediately draws you into the story. And she can sing. Her vibrant rendition of ""Honey Honey"" is an exercise in exuberance and catchiness. It may be my favorite song, up there with ""Chiqitita,"" ""Take a Chance on Me"" and ""Dancing Queen,"" this last one to which I, thankfully, managed to abstain from humming along (for I am a manly man and not some disco dude).There's not much here that's rooted in reality, and it's fine. Every now and then, this type of film is exactly what I'm looking for, especially when one's down in the dumps. MAMMA MIA is a fable, full of warmth and great energy and vivid colors. It's set on a stunning Greek island and boasts its very own spirited Greek chorus, which does just fine going into backup singers mode. You get the happy ending that was never in doubt. And, instead of one Prince Charming, the movie presents three.What I've got is the single disc DVD. Its special features include lukewarm audio commentary by Director Phyllida Lloyd (who also directed the stage productions of MAMMA MIA) and the deleted musical number ""The Name of the Game."" And, ooooh, there's an option to play the movie with on-screen lyrics for the musical numbers! And an option to skip right to a song. Score, baby!Okay. And now I'm gonna watch some football (please don't take away my man card).",4,"""Dot, dot, dot... that's what they did in the olden days.""",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,2979,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'before', 'elsewhere', 'am', 'manly', 'man', 'occasionally', 'even', 'manly', 'men', 'are', 'cowed', 'better', 'halves', 'So', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'convinced', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'even', 'manly', 'men', 'can', 'channel', 'more', 'refined', 'dimensions', 'forfeiting', 'man', 'card', 'ended', 'up', 'digging', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'dammit', 'even', 'humming', 'Abba', 'songs', 'set-up', 'just', 'Sophie', 'wedding', 'preparations', 'are', 'lively', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'make', 'perfect', 'father', 'give', 'away', 'life', 'Sophie', 'had', 'gone', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'dad', 'then', 'mother', 'Donna', 'diary', 'discovers', 'dad', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'three', 'possible', 'men', 'whom', 'diary', 'states', 'mother', 'had', 'spent', 'time', 'one', 'thing', 'leading', 'dot', 'dot', 'dot', 'Unbeknownst', 'Donna', 'Sophie', 'three', 'men', 'wedding', 'then', 'fun', 'shenanigans.For', 'who', ""'ve"", 'signed', 'up', 'FeelGoodology', '101', 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'professor', 'class', 'pop', 'DVD', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'kibitz', 'campy', 'elements', 'grouse', 'most', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'tune', ""n't"", 'alter', 'fact', 'musical', 'simply', 'feel', 'good', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'role', 'just', 'show', 'woman', 'can', 'officially', 'do', 'anything', 'acting', 'gig', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'no', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'so', 'what', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'come', 'good', 'humor', 'grace', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Sophie', 'so', 'damn', 'engaging', 'so', 'hopefully', 'wistful', 'perfect', 'choice', 'open', 'movie', 'plight', 'immediately', 'story', 'can', 'sing', 'vibrant', 'rendition', 'Honey', 'Honey', 'exercise', 'exuberance', 'catchiness', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'song', 'up', 'there', 'Chiqitita', 'Take', 'Chance', 'Me', 'Dancing', 'Queen', 'last', 'one', 'thankfully', 'managed', 'abstain', 'humming', 'along', 'am', 'manly', 'man', 'not', 'disco', 'dude', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'rooted', 'reality', 'fine', 'Every', 'now', 'then', 'type', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'down', 'dumps', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'fable', 'full', 'warmth', 'great', 'energy', 'vivid', 'colors', 'set', 'stunning', 'Greek', 'island', 'very', 'own', 'spirited', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'just', 'fine', 'going', 'backup', 'singers', 'mode', 'get', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'never', 'doubt', 'instead', 'one', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'single', 'disc', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'lukewarm', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Phyllida', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'stage', 'productions', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'deleted', 'musical', 'number', 'Name', 'Game', 'ooooh', 'option', 'play', 'movie', 'on-screen', 'lyrics', 'musical', 'numbers', 'option', 'skip', 'right', 'song', 'Score', 'baby', 'Okay', 'now', ""'m"", 'gon', 'watch', 'football', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'man', 'card']",N/A

Perhaps you've got two Oscars to your name and untold nominations for gritty dark roles where you've had to assume  heavy European accents.  Perhaps you have embodied to fantastic accolades one of the staple characters of popular culture, be it Mr. Bond or Mr. Darcy.  You are a Serious Actor, not known for (or possessing) any particular musical theatre ability.  What would compel you to accept a role in an ABBA musical where you had to both sing and dance AND perhaps look generally ridiculous?  Maybe because you want to have some FUN at work, even if it's at your own expense and you have to spend half the movie in overalls and ratty sneakers?  Having a working holiday on a fabulous Greek island surely must render all other objections moot.  Meryl Streep is amazing; a force of nature who looks great for her age or frankly, any age.  She displays a real flair for physical comedy and a more-than-passable voice belting out some of ABBA's greatest hits.  The highlight for me was her empassioned rendering of ""The Winner Takes It All"" on a rocky Greek hillside.  She is the strongest voice in this cast of non-singers, and her zest for life is palpable.

Yes, it is a little over the top -- but when was the last time you watched ""An American in Paris?"" I re-watched it lately, and talk about over the top! But IT WORKS and is considered a classic. That's because the MUSIC works. The same could be said for ""Mama Mia"". Maybe not on the same level -- ABBA is not on par with Gershwin, after all -- but they never pretended to be, either.I knew Meryl Streep could sing (she does it very well in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Postcards from the Edge""), but Colin Firth surprised me pleasantly. And could anything be funnier (or campier) than Christine Baranski's ""Does Your Mother Know?"" And I certainly cannot remember a more unique (or funnier) dance sequence than is in ""Lay All Your Love On Me!""I'm well over 50, so I remember those clothes, those awful platform shoes, and how the music critics savaged ABBA as being ""cotton candy"" music.

""Mamma Mia"" stitches together ABBA's greatest hit (and a few more) into a fun and sometimes funny musical experience. The plot is silly and contrived -- a hippy girl's daughter is getting married and wants to invite her Dad to the nuptials. The singing -- done by the principals themselves, including Meryl Streep -- is mostly good, with the exception of poor Pierce Brosnan's forced efforts at song. The ABBA tunes more or less, kind of, almost fit the action.

I've seen it three times on stage so was prepped for the movie version. It was fun to watch the way they movie-masters opened up the stage version to the panoramic natural setting of the beautiful Greek islands although the expansiveness didn't always click. Originally the musical's creators took some catchy Abba songs and wove them together into a plot-line that was above-average or more sophisticated than is usual when musical-makers start with a canon of songs.In Blu-Ray the Greek island settings are gorgeous. Meryl Streep is exceptionally good in this version as is Pierce Brosnan. Neither one comes over very well in the CD soundtrack when you can't see them acting because their voices can't carry the day alone. The entire cast does a creditable job.Some of the musical numbers are way over-produced and over-peopled. Less would have been better. The early number ""Money, Money, Money"" is way over the top. The yacht scenes bear no reference to the island life and are a phony dream sequence. Some numbers are hectic, frenetic and seem like they're filmed in fast motion. There are too many extras bouncing up and down to the Abba beat and overpopulating the screen. Too many Greek peasant women and armies of dancers come advancing off the screen and into your lap. Everyone is dancing their hearts away.Audiences unused to the unreality of the old-fashioned movie musicals are going to be overwhelmed by the overkill. We have forgotten how to suspend disbelief when it comes to the openness of musicals. Breaking into song has become bizarre for those unused to the old genre.Meryl Streep uses her particular acting skills to put over certain numbers particularly ""The Winner Takes It All.""It seems foolish to quibble about a movie that has a lot of laughs, burlesque turns, snappy popsicle music, a pretty good plot, and keeps you entertained.The movie has a vitality, a joie de vivre that is certainly good for these hard economic times.

Discovering it on DVD, I immediately thought that the critics were a little hard on the movie when it premiered in theaters.

But any flaws are just that, nitpicks, not fatal elements that should drive a viewer away.  I will say that the movie didn't catch fire up to its full potential, based on all the footage of screaming, joyous fans seeing the stage version that is peppered throughout the special features and promo spots on the DVD, but things are energetic enough.  And several of the secondary characters- especially Meryl Streep's two girlfriends- were a little cartoony for my tastes.  But again, nitpicks.  Just enjoy the scenery, music, and romance.

It's dramatic--some of the time. And it is entertaining ALL of the time! I laughed! I cried! I cheered! I sang! I love this film--and the best part was Meryl Streep dancing and singing in all parts--whether as part of the story or in her trio.Everyone was delightful in his/her role. It is true--the singers are not trained professionals--they are more like real people singing in real situations. OK, most people don't blurt out in song, but wouldn't you rather have Meryl sing her own songs than have her lip sync as Audrey Hepburn did in ""My Fair Lady?""Or to see and hear Pierce Brosnan sing so painfully in his role? His struggle lent credence to his role as a once-heartbroken young man who finds himself 20 years later in a place make amends. His singing was sweet and heartfelt.Or Julie Waters' show-stopping number toward the end of the film. ""Take a Chance on Me!"" Indeed! Or the concept of the Greek chorus (you get it?!!)--Greek chorus, made up of local villagers in just the right places for the numbers. Especially the women following Meryl/Donna scene.Mamma Mia--my mamma is known, but who is my dad? Sophie finds her mother's journal the summer she was conceived only to learn that her dad could be one of three men. How this is resolved is one of the great moments of the movie. It's a Greek wedding under the summer sun with a touch of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream of magic and confusion. As in the Bard's play things are set back in order, maybe a new order by movie's end.To get there the viewer will experience a brouhaha of ABBA melodies (the musical is based on their hits) rousing, funny, and serious. When Meryl/Donna sings to Pierce just before the wedding, my heart broke with hers. Wow, that was as powerful a scene as anything she's done dramatically in other roles.But enough.

1197411,A30CXBWNJ83TUG,B001GKJ2DO,J. Whelan,"[1, 1]","There were times, while watching this silly film, that I thought it might win me over through sheer exuberance.  But ultimately, it was not to be, for it suffers from two jointly-fatal flaws:  the whole is less than the sum of its parts; and the parts are less compelling than watching old ABBA videos.I'll give one example of how the film works against itself.  ""The Winner Takes it All"" is a heartbroken lament by a betrayed woman as she parrots the cynical self-justifications of her betrayer.  It works (at least for me) because the heartbreak overwhelms the song and exposes the betrayer's self-serving cruelty.  Meryl Streep cannot sing quite as well as Agnetha, but she can act, and she acts her heart out while singing this to Pierce Brosnan.  But it is all for nothing, because the CONTEXT is all wrong.  He never betrayed her - it's all a silly misunderstanding.  And since he never said those things, the cynicism all comes from HER!  Whatever power the song ever had, it simply cannot survive this one-two punch of fake tragedy plus unsympathetic victim.This happens repeatedly.  Not only does the story fail to add anything to the songs, but it actually works against the ideas or emotions the original songs seemed to convey.  Lyrics make poor sense in light of the plot (a woman singing ""baby I'm still free"" to a man she just met; a woman singing ""building me a fence, building me a home"" about a summer fling where she slept with 3 different men).I won't pick on the quality of the singing, as some viewers do.  In fact, I think one of the most effective moments of the film is when the two sisters sing ""Chiquitita"" to Meryl Streep (badly, but with feeling!).  On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried sings quite well - but when she sings ""I Have a Dream"" I cannot remember why I ever liked the song.  Frida convinced me she really believed in angels, but somehow Amanda cannot.Nor am I sure Amanda's renditions are the real problem.  There is something subtly wrong about the context - an aura of sad, sordid despair, thinly veiled by forced joyfulness.  The happy twist that transforms the wedding banquet into a sort of PG-rated orgy, through the magic of Aphrodite, did not quite have the tone of innocent nostalgia that I was looking for.

1197419,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B001GKJ2DO,Kathy W,"[3, 4]","This is a 2-disc special edition starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, extremely talented veteran actors who have starred in many many movies.  I grew up watching musicals, so it was refreshing to see one today.  Although the plot is a tad weak, and many of the songs are not exactly Rogers and Hammerstein, there are good musical numbers throughout the movie with lots of singing and dancing.  Much (or maybe all?) of the music is Abba. I guess I would say that some of the music is great and some is just ok.  Pierce Brosnan (bless his little heart) sings 3 songs.  Now, he is not exactly Mario Lanza but his numbers add to the overall production (and I'll leave it at that.) EVERYBODY sings in this musical, which is great.The movie opens (and continues) with beautiful scenery.  A wee bit of the film (in the beginning) was filmed in London, but most of the production was filmed in Greece, on 2 small islands and on the mainland (Skopelos, Skiathos, and Mouresi-Magnesia).  Raised on the Greek island of Kalokairi by her unmarried mom Donna (Meryl), beautiful and delicate 20-year old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) explains to her girlfriends, Lisa and Ali, how she has always felt ""empty"" not knowing who her father is. She got her little paws on Donna's diary, and in reading the exciting parts (the ""dot, dot, dot"" parts), she determines that one of Donna's 3 past boyfriends just HAS to be Daddy.  Let's see--Is it Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Harry (Colin Firth), or Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?Sophie is about to marry Sky (Dominic Cooper), so while Donna is sending out invitations to her best friends, Rosie, the stuff-your-vegetables cookbook writer (Julie Walters) and Tanya, the vixen whose 3rd husband paid for her plastic surgery (Christine Baranski), Sophie sends out some invitations too. Sophie invites Bill, Harry, and Sam!  When Sophie signs Donna's name to the invitations, the guys leave their digs and come to Kalokairi for the wedding.  All the time, the guys are wondering why Donna invited them to her daughter's wedding when they haven't heard from Donna in 20 years. Sophie wants her Daddy to give the bride away at the wedding, so she hides the guys in Donna's villa-hotel, but Donna finds them.  Of course, the plot takes off from here but it is pretty simplistic.  There is not a whole lot more that happens.  As i said before, the attention is more on the music. Chick-flick?  Yeah.  I guess it is.Bonus features include a sing-along with on-screen lyrics for 22 musical numbers; a deleted musical number, and a commentary with the director.  Special Edition exclusives are:1) The making of Mamma Mia! the movie;2) Anatomy of a musical number ""Lay All Your Love On Me"";3) Becoming a Singer;4) Behind the Scenes with Amanda;5) On Location in Greece;6) A Look Inside the Movie;7) ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme"" Music Video;8) Bjorn Ulvaues Cameo;9) Deleted Scenes and Outtakes; and10) Digital Copy of the movie (that you can download to your ipod, but you need an internet connection and the password that they give you on the insert).I gave this 4 stars because i kinda averaged it out, which I don't normally do in my reviews.  I gave the storyline a 3, because I thought the plot was much too simplistic, realizing though that the director likely put more attention on the musical part of the production.  I gave the music and dancing a 4, because some of the songs were great and some were just ok,  I gave the gorgeous scenery a 5.  The acting while singing deserved a 4 or 5.  I especially liked the feeling that Meryl put into ""The Winner Takes It All"" scene during her discussion with Pierce right before the wedding, on a cliff in Greece.I would have liked to hear a little Greek music here and there, since they were in Greece (Duh!).  I think I only heard one Greek word in the whole movie (Duh--again). A little unrealistic. But, there was a lot n of singing and dancing, some great numbers, great choreography, many great songs, and sometimes large numbers of townspeople joining in the productions.  I found myself laughing out loud a few times and it was a real feel-good movie--very entertaining. I did enjoy it and would watch it again.  The bonus features were also entertaining.Just DON'T make the same mistake I did!

When they announced the movie and said that Olivia Newton John might be playing Donna, we all cheered, and then when it seemed like Michelle Pfeiffer was getting the nod, we were even happier.  Frankly, Meryl Streep gets everything nowadays, can't they give it to someone whose career could use the boost?  But she can sing and of course she can act up a storm.  Donna never seems to think twice about what she is going to the Greek coastline with her enormous tourist hotel and employing all the Greek islanders as her gofers.  How does she pay any of them I wonder, if the business is as bad as she claims?How did Amanda Seyfried get to meet those two bridesmaids who seem to have wandered in from a movie like BLOW-UP--tall, leggy, older supermodels indistinguishable from each other, not a single personality between them.  They just make Sophie look like a midget, can she really be that short?  I used to like Seyfried, but her goofy swoons every time her mother sings are too forced.  I like exuberance, but hers is cooked up like heroin sizzling in a spoon.  And yet, she's not awful, and in fact she does a pretty good job convincing us that she really wants to find out who her father is.  This must speak to a lot of people who don't know their fathers, I guess, but for the rest of us, it is not motivation enough--it is the opposite of motivation--countermotivation perhaps.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic what's his name have chemistry during their big number Lay All Your Love on Me, possibly ABBA's sexiest tune, but otherwise I'm looking at him wondering what the big deal is.  A star of tomorrow, I don't think so.What a missed opportunity for Meryl Streep to have introduced Abba's ""JUST LIKE THAT"" to the world.  ABBA fans know that ""MAMMA MIA"" the stage musical actually had a ""Just Like That"" scene which was trimmed during out of town tryouts.  Here she does a fine job with ""The Winner Takes It All,"" but no one can actually perform that one better than the original by Agnetha Faltskog... maybe Meryl Streep is too levelheaded a person really to put that song over.  Is she ever really down, or does she find a little bit of hope even in her darkest hour?  With Agnetha we knew that everything in the universe was and is and remains doomed, for the gods, cold as ice, throw a dice and decide our fate.",4,Lay All Your Love on Mamma Mia,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,2464,"['Meryl', 'Streep', 'perfect', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'Just', 'everything', 'else', 'least', 'little', 'hint', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'When', 'announced', 'movie', 'said', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'might', 'be', 'playing', 'Donna', 'cheered', 'then', 'when', 'seemed', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'was', 'getting', 'nod', 'were', 'even', 'happier', 'Frankly', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'everything', 'nowadays', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'someone', 'career', 'could', 'use', 'boost', 'can', 'sing', 'course', 'can', 'act', 'up', 'storm', 'Donna', 'never', 'think', 'twice', 'what', 'going', 'Greek', 'coastline', 'enormous', 'tourist', 'hotel', 'employing', 'Greek', 'islanders', 'gofers', 'How', 'pay', 'wonder', 'business', 'as', 'bad', 'How', 'did', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'get', 'meet', 'two', 'bridesmaids', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'wandered', 'movie', 'BLOW-UP', 'tall', 'leggy', 'older', 'supermodels', 'indistinguishable', 'other', 'not', 'single', 'personality', 'just', 'make', 'Sophie', 'look', 'midget', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'short', 'used', 'like', 'Seyfried', 'goofy', 'swoons', 'time', 'mother', 'sings', 'are', 'too', 'forced', 'like', 'exuberance', 'hers', 'cooked', 'up', 'heroin', 'sizzling', 'spoon', 'yet', 'not', 'awful', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'convincing', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'father', 'must', 'speak', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fathers', 'guess', 'rest', 'not', 'motivation', 'enough', 'opposite', 'motivation', 'countermotivation', 'perhaps', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Dominic', 'what', 'name', 'have', 'chemistry', 'big', 'number', 'Lay', 'All', 'Your', 'Love', 'Me', 'possibly', 'ABBA', 'sexiest', 'tune', 'otherwise', ""'m"", 'looking', 'wondering', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'star', 'tomorrow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.What', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'have', 'introduced', 'Abba', 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'THAT', 'world', 'fans', 'know', 'MAMMA', 'MIA', 'stage', 'musical', 'actually', 'had', 'Just', 'scene', 'was', 'trimmed', 'town', 'tryouts', 'Here', 'fine', 'job', 'Winner', 'Takes', 'All', 'one', 'can', 'actually', 'perform', 'one', 'better', 'original', 'Agnetha', 'Faltskog', 'maybe', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'too', 'levelheaded', 'person', 'really', 'put', 'song', 'ever', 'really', 'down', 'find', 'little', 'bit', 'hope', 'even', 'darkest', 'hour', 'Agnetha', 'knew', 'everything', 'universe', 'was', 'doomed', 'gods', 'cold', 'ice', 'throw', 'dice', 'decide', 'fate']",N/A

1197434,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,B001GKJ2DO,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[3, 6]","Mama Mia! Not That Bad, ActuallyBy Kristin BattestellaWhen I had the opportunity to see Mama Mia! in theaters, I was a little reluctant to go. Despite being a big Bee Gees fan, I don't care for Abba all that much, and I'm not into newer musical chick flicks. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, I kind of liked Mama Mia!.As young Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) readies for her marriage to Sky (Dominic Cooper) on the Greek island of Skopelos, she confesses to her best friends Ali (Ashley Lilly) and Lisa (Rachel McDowall) that she's invited her three prospective fathers to the wedding- unbeknownst to her mother Donna (Meryl Streep). Donna's friends Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Walters) come for the festivities and help Donna relive her glory days when she discovers her previous lovers are close at hand. Who is Sophie's Dad? Rogue Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), uptight Harry (Colin Firth), or divorcee Sam (Pierce Brosnan)?Each major cast member gets a lead turn at the music. Tony winner Christine Baranski (Chicago, Cybill) and Julie Walters (Harry Potter) could steal the show with `Does Your Mother Know' and `Take A chance on Me', respectively, if it were not for Streep's taking down the house with `The Winner Takes It All'. I knew the 14 time Oscar nominee (twice a winner with Kramer vs Kramer and Sophie's Choice) could carry a tune, but I didn't know she could sing that well. Everything the 59 year old actress has is in Donna, vocally and physically. Much was made of the impromptu split for the movie's trailers, but Streep's energy throughout the film's big dance numbers makes me envious. If it weren't for all her other star turns, I could say that this is a definitive and star making role. Streep will most likely get another nomination for Mama Mia!; despite all her dramatic and even comedic achievement, this is the complete variety package.Seyfried (Mean Girls, Veronica Mars) is cute as daughter Sophie. She's pretty, but not in a conventional way, and of course, she can sing. I'm glad, however, that the core of the film is on Donna, not necessarily Sophie's oft seen coming of age quest for her father. I'm not a Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) or Stellan Skarsgard (Pirates of the Caribbean) fan, but both fit their parts here with humor and acceptable tunes. Only Pierce Brosnan (Die Another Day) is out of place. Pierce, Pierce-if this were a straight romantic drama or comedy, he would be to die for as the days of Remington Steele. I like Brosnan a lot, which is why I can watch Mama Mia! and forgive the fact that he can't sing. Not like I can sing myself, but it's easy to pick Brosnan for last place among the cast here. Sorry!At the same time, I discovered Abba music I didn't know was Abba and music that I'd never heard before. Mama Mia! gives us the obligatory `Dancing Queen' and the eponymous track-which was stuck in my head for days after. The sound is done well, even if background singers spring up out of nowhere. It's a musical, you can take a leap of faith when people break out in song. Mama Mia! does gives us a few obvious onscreen music set ups, but for the most part the songs are fun and lighthearted. I didn't how they would work one of the few songs I knew in there, but `Fernando' has its moment. `Money, Money, Money' and `Super Trouper' aren't as upbeat, but the low songs are forgivable when considering the desire to fit every Abba song possible in one under two hour movie.While the dated and hokey nature of seventies styles are now accepted and even hip-we wouldn't be having a musical comprised of Abba's songs if they weren't-it is in fact Mama Mia's contemporary stylings that may hinder its long lasting appeal. The shabby chic look of Donna's villa, the dress of the three males leads, and the all too pretty beachy and bohemian look of Sophie and Sky trap this film in 2008. Sure maybe people copied Clueless for back to school 1995, but come 96, not so much. Mama Mia! does win production values for its great Greek locales. The crystal waters, swift boats, impressive rocks and cliffs blend perfectly with the indoor soundstages. I don't want to say `It's all Greek to me', but there were times when this Italian was out of the loop on the Greek marriage customs. I do wonder how the heck everyone climbed all those steps to that church though. Oiy.Although the script from relative newcomer Catherine Johnson is thin in some places and too obvious in others-like the obligatory father bonding montages and near blatant cues for the music-the elder cast keeps things sardonic or witty where it needs to be. Where I'm sure some actors are embarrassed by musical attempts, I don't think the cast here has anything to be ashamed of-even Brosnan! While there is definitely a hard core group of fans racking up the pre sales for this DVD release (it looks like the two disc edition has all the features) it's the music and the talent that makes Mama Mia! a successful transition from stage to screen. Instead of wallowing in Beach Bingo teeny drama, stage director Phyllida Lloyd keeps the mature members of the cast on top. Even though Lloyd lets the pace drag in between musical numbers, its rare to find a musical with adult fun and maturity that's PG-13 enough for the whole family.I don't think guys will care for Mama Mia!. Macho men might cringe at a wife or daughter's obsession with this film. Those Abba songs over and over! Young guys, however, might like the music or the hot dancing. There's nothing super naughty for tweens and younger-what there is might go over their heads, so Mama Mia! might be a parent's chance to swap out High School Musical for something they can enjoy, too. For surprising musical fun for the whole family, pick up Mama Mia! on DVD this December.",3,"Not Bad, really",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,5763,"['Mama', 'Mia', 'Not', 'Bad', 'ActuallyBy', 'Kristin',

1197448,A2P5813TVIDMEE,B001GKJ2DO,linda n hutchinson,"[1, 1]","A lovely, spirited romantic movie set in the beauty of Greece- its incredulous mountains and cliffs overlooking the sparkling blue sea looked down upon by bluer than blue skies. Whitewashed buildings made blindingly bright by the sun. The audience arrives at the scene along with the cast of attendees of Donna's daughter's wedding and the music draws us in to be full participants.Donna had traveled to Greece as a seventeen year old young woman to enjoy a summer of the sights and carefree life there but never returned home - the consequences of casting fate to the wind and loving freely that impetuous summer.Her light-hearted, free and easy ways of her youth had abruptly ended with that summer. As the movie begins, we learn that she has lived out her life over the past twenty years in financial hardship, having been disowned by her mother when her pregnancy was found out. The three young men with whom she had had romantic encounters that summer had moved on with their lives and never knew of her strife. Having the good fortune of inheriting a goat farm property on a precarious hillside, she has spent all her money and invested her back breaking labor in trying to restore the place into an Inn from which to draw an income. The reality was it was crumbling faster than she could repair it and no amount of whitewash could cover its decline.What was planned as a simple village wedding ceremony with plenty of food and drink exploded over night into something quite unexpected as the guests begin to arrive and partake in the festivities. Donna is horrified when the three men - one of which was the father of her daughter - arrive on the scene. They had received invitations from her daughter whose deep-seated need to find out who her father overtakes all caution following finding her mother's diary about that summer and decides to invite the three possible ""fathers"" to her wedding - never really expecting any to come.This convergence is rounded out by the arrival of Donna's two oldest and dearest friends from her back-in-the-day youth. The friendships of the young bride-to-be and her circle of close friends have their eyes opened to what her mother and friends had experienced in their youth as they provide the entertainment for the ""girls only"" party the night before the wedding by performing their array of disco songs. The young bride-to-be and her friends and the locals are shocked, but totally taken with the freeing tone those songs projected and the whole place goes crazy with everyone joining in along with the three men watching from the edge of the crowd as their old love, Donna, leads the 'playback"" of songs and fun they had each personally shared with her as a young girl some twenty years before in this same breath-taking place.The ending is a happy one. There is a message we come away with upon leaving the theater. For me it is, ""Take time dear girls to form you own set of dreams. Find out who you are, recognize your talents, so that you can choose a career or path that will be the ""work"" of your life and also the source of what fulfills you outside of a relationship  - before the worldly responsibilities of becoming an adult are laid upon you.Donna had swallowed the shame she felt in becoming an unwed mother. Rebuilding her crumbling property into an Inn became her life. An impossible dream given her financial resources yet she would not give up. Deep inside her, it represented a dream talked about with Sam back in that summer of long ago. A dream she would not let go of despite his no longer being there to share in it. For all its crumbling conditions, it was home for her and her daughter.To ensure that unlike her, her daughter would find a safe and happy haven in life. The Rules would be followed! Her wings would be lovingly clipped to protect her from flying away to the temptations of inexperienced youth. A lovely wedding to remember, a devoted husband on which to depend BEFORE a baby came on the scene.... all would come to pass by following the ""Rules"".While the memories of her daughter and her circle of friends are being formed, Donna's old memories - and those of the three men, come flooding back. They are both whimsical and lighthearted, filled with youthful innocence as they came to know one-another's budding interests and then gave way to their over-powering sexual attractions.  Yet the jarring and sobering realities that followed for Donna in how her life had played out after that summer of unfettered fun is unleashed in emotion as she sings, ""The Winner Takes It All"".This is definately a ""Chick Flick"". Men will probably not come away with any of its deeper meaning. So see the movie with your girlfriends instead. Buy the CD and watch it alone to have a good laugh and cry when the load dumped upon your shoulders seems too much. Bring tissues because we women will cry when they see the parallels found in our own lives, others will cry for those in our sisterhood who gave up their young dreams and devoted the balance of their lives to making the most of their own dealt hand of reality. It reminds us of how restorative it is when we connect with our old friends and reminisce about the life journey we shared. But the movie's most important reminder is that there is nothing on earth to equal the deep and abiding connection between a man and a woman in love whose main expression of that love is to allow each to realize their dreams and be the support in those endeavors... It is such love that happens in both Donna's life and her daughter's that makes for the movies happy ending.",5,A mother's surpressed memories of shared loves come bounding back as guests at her

Watched it 4 times, something I never do, and I find myself going to sleep and waking up with the lyrics from Mamma Mia on my lips. Another thing, too: I'm not a rabid dancer. Usually I have to force myself to do it, and it probably shows. But there are few ABBA songs I can listen to without wanting to get up and start gesticulating with my arms and swiveling the old hips.

I don't know what it is about their music, but if you don't want to dance when you hear it, forget it, you'll never be a dancer.I agree that Pierce Brosnan can't carry a tune, but it didn't bother me too much because I didn't expect him to be vocally talented. He was adequate for the role, probably not his best, but he seemed to enjoy himself nonetheless, and I did, too.Anyway, I'm sold on the movie, so I'll look for the best deal I can get on my purchase of it.

ABBA, like most pop groups, wrote the same love song over and over, and here they are trying to use that one song to tell the stories of 1. A young woman searching for her biological father because she hopes this will make her whole 2. The mother facing the here-and-now of her past free spirit 3.Three men facing whether they are (or ever should be) fathers and whether they'll ever be in love again (and with whom)4.A young man deciding whether to give in to a poofy over the top wedding ceremony against his better judgement because it will make the woman he loves happy.In the ""classic"" movie musicals, the sets looked like sets--you can see the backdrops pretty well in Oklahoma! and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers--so if the last time you saw a musical it was from the 40s, the real life location here may be jarring. You'll get used to it. I also was suprised--and am pretty much jumping for joy--that the extras they chose are not Hollywood models but people with average faces and figures who know how to dance. (The nice exception is the beach dancing led by Christine Baranski, and let me tell you, it so works.)And speaking of not overdone, LOVED the singing. Pierce Brosnan is wonderful, ""courageous"" someone put it. He's not portraying a musician. He's portraying a man so overcome with emotion he bursts into song. Meryl Streep, whose voice is wonderful, IS portraying a singer. It so works. Their duets are touching.

Donna has never told Sophie who her father is, and that has left a hole in Sophie's heart.But as her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper) nears, Sophie finds a journal her mother kept 21 years ago.  In it, she finds three potential candidate for her father, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard).  Convinced that she will know her father on sight, she invites all three men without telling her mother.  But when all three men arrive, Sophie finds herself just as confused as she was before.  And their presence just complicates the wedding plans even further.  Will Donna recover from the surprise?  Will Sophie figure out who her father is?  Will the men discover why they are there?  And just how many great songs can be used to capture the feelings of the characters?I was not familiar with ABBA before I saw the movie, so pretty much had no clue what to expect.  And I loved these songs.  Honestly, if I didn't know where the music originated, I would have told you all the songs were written for the musical.  Not bad for a concept I dismissed as silly a few years back.  But these pop/rock sounds fit the story perfectly.And this cast can sing!  Meryl Streep is especially impressive as Donna, and gets the most songs.  The emotion she gets into so many of the songs is outstanding but hardly surprising considering how great an actress she is.  The only weak link in the singing department was Pierce Brosnan.  He is adequate while the others are outstanding.  But that's a minor point.With the number of songs in the movie, there is no way that they can develop all the characters well, especially since the film is under two hours.  Donna and her two friends are the best developed, followed by Sophie.  Honestly, I was disappointed with how little development Sky got.  I thought he'd play a bigger role.

Mamma Mia is set on a Greek island, where a young girl is about to get married and wants to have her father present for the wedding.  Unfortunately, she has been able to narrow the paternalistic possibilities down to three men and no further.  Her mother, who raised her in a hotel she owns on the island, has revealed nothing to her about her parentage.  The daughter secretly writes to the three candidates whose names she discovers in her mother's diary.Fine so far.  If only the characters had not been so vapid...the singing so excrutiatingly awful.  I've enjoyed Pierce Brosnan in plenty of other movies, but I'm afraid his singing will force you out of the room.As for Meryl Streep's two old pals who show up for the event, they reminded me of aging characters from ""Grease"" who never grew up.  The child bride is a giddy airhead who certainly is not capable of carrying the movie as a main character.Streep and Brosnan do their best and might have done ok if not for the musical demands.

The story is simple.  Donna (mother Meryl Streep) was once a wild child and now, twenty years later has a daughter, Sophie who is getting married.  They run a rustic hotel on a tiny Greek island.  The trouble is, Sophie never knew who her father was and neither did Donna.  Sophie figures out it has to be one of three men, so she seceretly invites them while mother Donna invite her two best friends making a perfect excuse to team up three couples during a wedding.  That's it.  Really.Even if you loathe ABBA, you'll find some good humor and songs here amidst the clever (if forced) storyline.  The songs and dancing action are non-stop, although some of the choreograophy could have been improved.  The visuals are stunning and Greece never looked so good.  Sure, some of the songs are goofball and corny, but they  carry the story and for the two male members of ABBA (Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus) to have created such a monster hit is remarkable.  Yes, Meryl Streep really CAN sing as good as the rest of the cast, but Pierce Brosnan is horridly, inexplicably painful to listen to.  No matter.  It's a simple, light-hearted film with lots of good music and good feelings.  The ending is hilarious.

Sophie has no idea who who father is (neither does Donna, for that matter), so she invites the three possible candidates (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding in hopes of reuniting with her true paterfamilias. Needless to say, Donna isn't exactly thrilled when three of her former lovers show up unexpectedly on the eve of her daughter's wedding, and of course hilarious hijinks ensue, followed by a totally unrealistic yet ridiculously happy ending.The best part of this film is watching some of my favorite Hollywood actors sing and dance like crazy.

None of them have any idea that they might be the bride's father.When Meryl sees the three men (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard) she just wants them to go away, but Amanda is not about to let that happen in this very fun, joyous musical comedy.Beautifully photographed under the direction of Phyllida Lloyd, MAMMA MIA! has some terrific musical numbers, performed by Streep, Seyfried and Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, who play Meryl's lifelong girl friends.  Ms. Baranski is particularly delightful.The men are not really singers, but they try hard and, truthfully, none of their songs require a strong voice.Director Lloyd supplies audio commentary and there is also a deleted musical number.

But Sophie has found mama's diary and culled the three names, and has invited all three now middle-aged potential fathers to the wedding. So Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgaard turn up and the games begin. It's all lighthearted and fun, but the real enjoyment for me was in the fact that every single number is an old ABBA tune, from ""Chiquita"" and ""Slipping through My Fingers"" through the boisterous production number, ""Dancing Queen."" It's also a relief to know that even I am a better singer than Pierce Brosnan. There's not a lot of the actor-character chemistry necessary to hold a successful musical together (think John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John), but it's worth watching for the music.

1197483,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001GKJ2DO,mirasreviews,"[2, 5]","""Mamma Mia!"" brings the wildly successful ABBA-inspired stage musical to the screen with a cast of actors who don't usually sing or dance. The film retains the behind-the-scenes talent from the stage show: director Phydilla Lloyd, producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and score by former ABBA member Benny Andersson. It adds one song and leaves a few others out, but this is very much a transfer of the stage musical to the screen. A young woman named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) plans to marry her beau Sky (Dominic Cooper) and dreams that her father will be at her wedding to give her away. But Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Twenty years ago, her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had summer flings with three men. Sophie invites all three to her wedding in Greece in hopes that she will recognize her father. But when Donna sees the men from her past, she's sure that they will ruin the wedding.There's hardly any point in mentioning that the set-up for this musical romp in the Greek Isles is silly beyond words. But the three candidates for Sophie's paternity are appealing guys, and the actors are game: American architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Swedish adventurer and travel writer Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard). The men are counterbalanced by a trio of sprightly middle-aged ladies: Donna and her friends Rosie the author (Julie Walters) and Tanya the serial divorcee (Christine Barnasky). These are fun characters, and I enjoyed them. I wish I could say the same for the younger set. Amanda Seyfried has a nice enough voice, but Sophie is annoying and seems more like a 13-year-old than a woman of 20.The musical numbers are dull. I partly blame the lack of vigor on the locations. This is a jukebox musical, so the songs are not integrated into the plot as seamlessly as they would be if the music had been written for the stage. And since this is a movie, filmed on location in Greece, they don't have the benefit of an intimate venue. On stage in a small venue, energy would be flying off the stage. In these wide open locations, further muted by transfer to the screen, the musical numbers fall flat. I kept hoping that the next scene would not be musical, because the stuff in between was reasonably charming. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most of the principle cast is over 50. Generally an appealing cast, even if they are not the best-suited talent for a musical, but unfortunately, the music that's supposed to be the selling point is the film's weakness.The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has the option of viewing a Sing-a-Long version in which the lyrics to the songs are displayed across the screen during musical numbers. There is one deleted musical number called ""The Name of the Game"" (3 min). And there is a feature commentary by director Phyllida Lloyd. She talks about locations, some photographic techniques, characters, cast, filming, her approach to the musical numbers, and various technical details.

But what I really liked was that the songs were incorporated in a true musical style, to advance the story line and give insight into the characters.  The actors all delivered their songs with such heart and energy, not in a corny ""Disney High School Musical"" fashion, but in a joyful burst of emotion, as if singing were as natural as talking to them.Meryl Streep's voice was a true joy.  She gave me shivers with her delivery and style, especially ""The Winner Takes it All"".  The other singers were also top notch, except for Pierce Brosnan.  And while his voice may leave a bit to be desired, he made up for it with spirit and heart!

We have enjoyed sharing it over and over.  Hurray for a new musical that I could enjoy with my girls, unlike many of the other musicals of recent years, ie Sweeney Todd, Rent, Chicago, Moulin Rouge. Hey Hollywood, bring on more like this one.(For parents, the PG was for the basic premise of the story, that Donna did not know which of the three men was the father of her daughter.  Also there was some other content, including a brief glimpse of a bare male bottom, some homosexual dance partnering, and social drinking.

The film's shortcoming is that there are simply too many songs and not enough story. The thinly-plotted story is merely an excuse to sing and dance, which is why I called it a revue. Consequently, we learn very little about the three men, surely the past lives and personalities of her potential fathers would be of great interest to the girl. All we learn about them is that one is a sort of adventure-travel writer, and the other two are suit-wearing businessmen - one of whom is gay, the other divorced.Acting, from both youthful and veteran actors is at the flamboyant, gushy, everything is a crisis, teenage level.

I bought the soundtrack to the musical before, but something about the sound or tone of songs made me not like it. I disliked it so much, I had to sell it off.  Didn't even want it in my music library.So here comes the movie production.  It didn't excite me much because, so far, many of the movie adaptations have fallen flat.I finally watch the video months later after it is released, and find myself enjoying it.  Enough to keep going, rather than be turned off by some of the earlier, contrived musiscal numbers.  In the end, it was not just a smile here, a memory there (what with the ABBA songs) but a few days later, I am still thinking about the songs and the scenes they went with.  I'd have to say, get a chance to watch it if you can.Now as for the movie itself, I felt like Evita, Phantom of the Opera, and Mamma  Mia movies suffered from the same problem.  This problem is that, the singing doesn't seem like part of the movie.  Breaking out in dance and musical choreography is something I can accept with no issue, but the singing parts feel like they are dubbed in at the studio to have higher sound quality.  As a result, the talking scenes seem so mellow and are only intended to lead into the song numbers, which then take over your sound system with full orchestra and loudness and clarity.  It takes away from feeling like the characters are really singing the song as part of the movie, but rather, you are watching an MTV music video.Short of this, ""Mamma Mia"" made me think about all the ABBA songs I liked, during and days after watching it.

I managed to miss every touring company that played LA, though I would have loved to see and hear Judy Kaye as one of the friends in the original Broadway production.  Now there's another incredible actress singer treading the boards.  But I was lucky enough to have seen Meryl Streep sing on stage (her brilliant version of Surabaya Johnny from HAPPY END on Broadway in the late 70's beat Bette Midler's version recorded around that time).  And that teaser at the end of POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE....c'mon, the woman is a national treasure.So I saw the previews.....take me to that island right away.  Certainly a total rip off of BUONA SERRA, MRS CAMPBELL, but set in Greece.  And a chick flick?  Chicks over 45.....don't forget they are still alive and vibrant.  And Streep, Baranski and Walters lay it on with gusto, joy and lots of fun.  In fact, that's what I liked most about the film: everyone seemed to be having a good time.  And what's the problem with Brosnan's singing?  Does everyone have to sound like Pavarotti?  I think everyone brought a sense of play and fun and romance to a pretty thin script.And what was wrong with the long line dances on piers and patios?

1197503,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B001GKJ2DO,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[3, 6]","Mamma Mia! is a stage musical with a book by British playwright Catherine Johnson, based on the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus. It is an example of a jukebox musical, and is notable for popularizing the genre. A common misconception is that the plot is adapted from the 1968 film Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell starring Gina Lollobrigida. (In that film the mother is a former prostitute who told all three men that they were the father to secure payment for her child's upkeep. This differs vastly from the Mamma Mia story. Donna is not based on a prostitute and the writers deny any knowledge of the 1968 film, any similarity is coincidental.)Although the title of the musical is taken from the group's 1975 chart-topper Mamma Mia, the plot is fictional, not biographical.Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, who composed the original music for ABBA, were involved in the development of the show from the beginning. Anni-Frid Lyngstad has been involved financially in the production, while Agnetha F&auml;ltskog has not, though she was present at the Swedish premiere and final show.The musical includes such hits as ""Super Trouper"", ""Dancing Queen"", ""Knowing Me, Knowing You"", ""Thank You for the Music"", ""Money, Money, Money"", ""The Winner Takes It All"", ""Voulez Vous"", ""I Have a Dream"" and ""SOS"". It had been seen by over ten million people worldwide as of July 2003.[1] Estimates of 2007, is that 30 million have now seen Mamma Mia!. Since its opening in 1999, the production has grossed US$2.0 billion in earnings. [2]A stage-to-film adaptation, Mamma Mia! The Movie, starring Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, premiered in July 2008Mamma Mia! The Movie is a 2008 Golden Globe-nominated stage-to-film adaptation of the 1999 West End musical of the same name, based on the songs of successful pop group ABBA, with additional music also composed by ABBA member Benny Andersson. The film did very well at the box office becoming the most successful Hollywood film musical of all time and the highest grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom.[2] Like the stage musical, the film's title originates from the group's 1975 chart-topper Mamma Mia. It was produced by Universal Pictures in partnership with Playtone and Littlestar.[3]Meryl Streep heads the cast of the film, playing the role of single mother Donna Sheridan. Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgrd play the three possible fathers to Donna's daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried).On August 29, 2008, Mamma Mia!: The Sing-Along Edition, with lyrics to the songs highlighted on the screen, was released in select theaters.[4]On December 15, 2008, it was announced that Mamma Mia! had become the highest grossing film in Britain of all time. The previous record was held by Titanic in 1998.The film takes place on the enchanting Greek island of Skopelos (Kalokairi). The story begins at the remote Aegean island hotel, Villa Donna, run by Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), and Sophie's fiance Sky (Dominic Cooper).Prior to her forthcoming marriage, Sophie nervously posts three wedding invitations (""I Have a Dream"") to three different men, one of whom she believes may be her father. From three cities across the globe, three men set off to return to the island, and the woman that had enchanted each of them 20 years earlier.Back on that island, Donna is rousing her staff for the frenetic day ahead as Sophie's bridesmaids and best friends Ali and Lisa (Ashley Lilley and Rachel McDowall) arrive and she shares with her best mates a scandalous secret: Sophie has found her mother's diary and learned she has three possible dads; American businessman Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Swedish adventurer Bill Austin (Stellan Skarsgard), and British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth). Without telling her mother, she has invited all three to her wedding (""Honey, Honey""), believing that after she spends time with them, she will at last know who her real father is.Meanwhile, back on the Greek mainland, Sam, Bill, and Harry; strangers until today have met at the harbor. Fortuitously, Sam and Harry have missed the ferry to Skopelos (Kalokairi), and Bill offers them a lift on his yacht to reconnect with the woman who broke all their hearts 20 years ago.Back on Skopelos, Donna is ecstatic to reunite with old friends and former ""Donna and The Dynamos"" bandmates, wisecracking author Rosie (Julie Walters) and wealthy multiple divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski), and reveals her mystification at her daughter's desire for a traditional wedding or any wedding at all. At the Villa, Sophie introduces Tanya and Rosie to true love Sky, and tells them about their idea of designing a website to attract tourists to the island. Donna explains her precarious finances (""Money, Money, Money"") to her girlfriends as she takes them on a tour of the Villa. Hounded by her creditors, Donna dreams of a ""rich man's world,"" sunbathing on a yacht and being deliciously pampered. She is brought back to reality as an ominous crack appears in the courtyard.The three men arrive, and Sophie smuggles them to their quarters and sheepishly explains that she, not her mother, sent the invitations. She begs the men to hide so Donna will have a fantastic surprise at the wedding; seeing the old friends of whom she ""so often"" favorably speaks. They overhear Donna working (humming ""Fernando"" to herself) in the storeroom below preparing to fix the crack and the men swear to Sophie they will not reveal her secret. Sophie leaves by the window just in the nick of time, as Donna peeps through the trapdoor.She is dumbfounded to find herself face to face with the three former lovers she could never forget (""Mamma Mia!""), while the men clumsily make up excuses for their presence. Donna is adamant; they simply cannot stay. Visibly shaken, she confides in Tanya and Rosie (""Chiquitita"") a secret she has kept from everyone - she is uncertain which of the three men is actually Sophie's father. No matter, as Tanya and Rosie rally her spirits by getting Donna to join in with the female staff and islanders accompanying a musical number intended to make her forget her woes. Donna and The Dynamos reclaim their glory days and champion the women of the island in a call to liberation (""Dancing Queen"").Sophie finds the men aboard Bill's yacht, and they take a trip around the gorgeous island of Skopelos (""Our Last Summer"") and tell her stories of Donna as a carefree girl. Upon their return, Sophie musters up the courage to speak with Sky about her ploy, but loses her nerve. Sky and Sophie sing passionately to each other (""Lay All Your Love on Me""), but are interrupted by the bachelor party that has descended upon Sky to kidnap him for his last night of freedom.At Sophie's bachelorette party, Donna, Tanya, and Rosie perform in a surprise one-night-only event as Donna and The Dynamos (""Super Trouper""). Sophie is delighted to see her mother rock out, but becomes nervous when the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Sam, Bill and Harry. She decides to get each of her three prospective dads alone to talk.The young bride uses the confusion of her amorous girlfriends' dancing with the men (""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"") to speak with Sam about his love for Donna. Next, she's on to Harry about his desire, if any, for children. Finally, Bill reveals that the old woman who gave Donna the money to invest in her Villa was his Great Aunt Sofia, and Sophie guesses she must be her namesake. That's it! Bill must be her father! Sophie asks him to give her away and to keep their secret from Donna until the weddingOver the moon, Sophie returns to the party. But her happiness is short-lived as Sam and Harry each tell her they must be her dad and will give her away (""Voulez-Vous""). A shocked Sophie can't tell them the truth and, overwhelmed by the consequences of her action, faints on the dance floor.In the morning, Rosie and Tanya reassure a frantic Donna they will take care of the men. Donna confronts Sophie in the courtyard, mistakenly believing Sophie wants the wedding stopped. Sophie angrily says that all she wants is to avoid her mother's mistakes and storms off. An upset Donna is accosted by Sam, full of fatherly concern at Sophie getting married so young. Donna dresses him down, and both realize they still have feelings for each other (""SOS"").Meanwhile, on Bill's boat, Bill and Harry are about to confide in each other, but are interrupted by Rosie who is startled to find Bill, naked, making breakfast. Similarly, pulses are racing down on the sandy beaches as Tanya and young Pepper (Philip Michael) continue their May-December flirtations from the previous night (""Does Your Mother Know"").With her plans falling apart and wedding in jeopardy, Sophie knows it is time to come clean to Sky and ask for his help. He reacts angrily to his fianc&eacute;e's deception and Sophie must turn to her mother for support.As Donna helps her daughter dress for their wedding, the rift is quickly healed and Donna reminisces about Sophie's childhood and how quickly she's grown (""Slipping Through My Fingers""). Then and there, Sophie decides the only parent she's ever known is the only one who should give her away. As the staff and bridesmaids accompany Donna and Sophie to the chapel, Sam lies in nervous wait. Donna waves the wedding party on, and he begs Donna to talk. She cuts him short, however, revealing the deep pain she felt over losing him (""The Winner Takes It All"").After the ceremony begins, Donna can hold her tongue no more. She confesses to Sophie that her father is present but he could be Sam, Bill, or Harry. Sophie, in a shocker of her own, admits she invited them. The three men concur that they would be quite happy to be one-third of a father for such a girl. The surprises keep coming when Sophie tells Sky they should postpone their wedding and travel the world, as they have always wanted. It appears that preparations have been in vain until Sam steps in with the final curveball: he proposes to Donna.She accepts (""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do""); Sam and Donna then go through an impromptu ceremony, surrounded by the churchful of guests.At the wedding reception, Sam sings to Donna, whom he has loved for 21 years (""When All Is Said and Done"" [in the film only, not the musical]), which prompts Rosie to make a coy play for Bill (""Take a Chance on Me""). All the couples present proclaim their love and, magically, water from Aphrodite's fountain of love bursts through the crack in the courtyard at Villa Donna (""Mamma Mia!"").The story concludes as Sophie and Sky bid farewell to Skopelos island and sail away to a new life together (""I Have a Dream""), one full of hope and promise.Donna, Tanya, and Rosie reprise ""Dancing Queen"" during the first part of the credits, then launch into ""Waterloo"" with the rest of the cast. Finally, Amanda Seyfried sings ""Thank You for the Music"".",5,"IF YOU LIKE ABBA, YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE!",1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,11035,"['Mamma', 'Mia', 'stage', 'musical', 'book', 'British',

Of course the plot is simple, and not be taken too serious, but the critics slamming this movie? It was supposed to be a fun musical, happy and sunny, and it should be judged  as entertainment.It was cute and fun. The scenery was so beautiful, interiors and architecture to savor. The movie has a refreshing simplicity. I like very serious artistic movies, but geeez! I also need fun! This one gave me a lot of fun, I saw it twice. Very energizing music, escapist movie, which brings joy and sunshine. I was never Abba fan, but I really enjoyed the music this time.As for singing and dancing: some actors are not musical performers. And they still do great. Different set of performing skills is needed when a musical takes place on stage, and different acting is  needed for a movie. I admire some of the actors for acting and singing and dancing so well. Who knew Meryl Strep could sing so good, as one of the reviewers  said. I didn't know!As for Brosnan who was criticized about his singing: it was not so bad. Some critics teared his flesh, laughing how much he was whining, how bad his singing was.(Outside the Amazon.com critics). Actually, it was a very difficult song to sing, and in addition he was acting and was trying to make the  song as expressive as possible. He got the most difficult song to sing.It reminded me of situation when people listen to old records of opera singers of the turn of the century, and than criticize them they couldn't sing. Without understanding how much of technical difficulity brings singing with such voice, and the technique used for it. Don't get me wrong, I don't equal him with the great voices of the turn of the XIX and XXc. Just pointing similarity of reactions, dismissing the performance without appreciating the fact that such singing is horribly difficult. I think he did quite well, given the challenge he had.",5,Brougt smiles and vacation mood!,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,2050,"['saw', 'movie', 'movie', 'theater', 'big', 'screen', 'so', 'watching', 'one', 'home', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'exhilarating', 'cinema.And', 'tell', 'am', 'not', 'ABBA', 'fan', 'loved', 'course', 'plot', 'simple', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'serious', 'critics', 'slamming', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'musical', 'happy', 'sunny', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'entertainment.It', 'was', 'cute', 'fun', 'scenery', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'interiors', 'architecture', 'savor', 'movie', 'refreshing', 'simplicity', 'like', 'very', 'serious', 'artistic', 'movies', 'geeez', 'also', 'need', 'fun', 'one', 'gave', 'lot', 'fun', 'saw', 'twice', 'Very', 'energizing', 'music', 'escapist', 'movie', 'joy', 'sunshine', 'was', 'never', 'Abba', 'fan', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'time.As', 'singing', 'dancing', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'musical', 'performers', 'still', 'do', 'great', 'Different', 'set', 'performing', 'skills', 'needed', 'when', 'musical', 'place', 'stage', 'different', 'acting', 'needed', 'movie', 'admire', 'actors', 'acting', 'singing', 'dancing', 'so', 'well', 'Who', 'knew', 'Meryl', 'Strep', 'could', 'sing', 'so', 'good', 'one', 'reviewers', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'was', 'criticized', 'singing', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'critics', 'teared', 'flesh', 'laughing', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'whining', 'how', 'bad', 'singing', 'was', 'Amazon.com', 'critics', 'Actually', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'song', 'sing', 'addition', 'was', 'acting', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'song', 'as', 'expressive', 'possible', 'got', 'most', 'difficult', 'song', 'sing.It', 'reminded', 'situation', 'when', 'people', 'listen', 'old', 'records', 'opera', 'singers', 'turn', 'century', 'criticize', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'understanding', 'how', 'much', 'technical', 'difficulity', 'singing', 'such', 'voice', 'technique', 'used', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'equal', 'great', 'voices', 'turn', 'XIX', 'XXc', 'Just', 'pointing', 'similarity', 'reactions', 'dismissing', 'performance', 'appreciating', 'fact', 'such', 'singing', 'horribly', 'difficult', 'think', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'given', 'challenge', 'had']",N/A

The commentary from director Phyllida Lloyd is extremely insightful and explains why they had to remove ""The Name of the Game"" and shortened some of the songs (though I wish they would have kept it in and shortened the ""When All Is Said And Done"" wedding reception number!). Surprisingly, none of the male actors were hired with knowledge that they could sing - so they were all nervous of the challenge of singing and dancing at the same time. I wish they had done a second commentary with the cast, but then they probably wouldn't have been able to release this before Christmas.There aren't too many deleted scenes (mainly of the 3 guys at the beginning reading letters), or many outtakes (the Making of video has more outtakes), but overall the 2nd DVD is well worth having in your library.

I tried to refuse but she overpowered me with her mind-games.I wanted to go to the cinema, sit in the dark and sulk.But they wouldn't let me.Maybe it was the warmth of the Greek sun mixed with the melodies of ABBA but after only a few minutes I couldn't help but feel happier. Damn them.By the middle of the film I was laughing as loudly as everyone else, and finally I jumped up onto my feet during the finale to spin my beloved up the aisle.As I left the cinema, feeling giddy and warm (my wife and I talked about nonsense all the way home on the train - just laughing and joking over silly things) - I realised that the film had transformed the both of us for the night. We did not talk about the film, but the joy and freedom and sense of fun it gave us remained.The next day I read many of the critical reviews, nearly all panned the film, and although I can objectivly see that the film was not the most technically accomplished, I have two reasons why I think my wife and I loved the experience so much.1. I cannot remember seeing a film featuring people my own age actually having fun. Not 'acting' like they are having fun but actually have a romp. Hollywood take note - we live in an ageing population and people of my age like seeing the vitality that can be afforded to us rather than being reminded that we are just too old to face transforming robots.

Integrated into the film, flimsy as the plot is, just produces a renewed vigour to it - like meeting an old friend that you have not seen for years.Forget the critics, like aimless children in a playground they follow whatever the zeitgeist dictates, trying to convince us of what is note worthy and important. They offer analytical pieces that nail all of the technical faults of this film but have managed to miss all of it's emotional triumphs.

The film version of the hit musical offers stunning production values and memorable ABBA tunes with updated arrangements.  What's not to like?  While traditional Hollywood musicals often featured singers of less than stellar talents (e.g. Fred Astaire) these stars were usually paired with someone who was an A-list singer.  A frothy, fun musical doesn't require extraordinary acting skill, so having Meryl Streep in the lead role is a bit odd.  If the producers felt the picture needed someone of that stature, it would have made more sense to go with someone who was also an accomplished singer, such as Glenn Close.  The time-honored alternative is to dub the singing parts with a ghost singer, which is what should have been done for Mr. Brosnan's part.  The off-key, lackluster singing really drags down this otherwise beautiful film as many of the musical sequences are quite long. It reminds me of Ross Hunter's forgotten musical production of ""Lost Horizon"" which as doomed by its cast of casual singers.

After several sub-zero nights and frozen pipes I was in the mood for something that looked warm and sunny.  The picture on the cover of the DVD was ridiculous but at least they appeared to be dancing on a beach in front of blue water.Wow!  It didn't take long for the warmth in this film to melt my mid-winter depression.  I didn't see the stage version so I wasn't handicapped by making that comparison.  And I never liked ABBA so I didn't care if anyone mangled their songs.I admit that I had soured on Meryl Streep, after having been a major fan.  She seemed to have become so mannered and self conscious that I lost interest in her.  But here....another WOW!This and her performance as Julia Child have reinstated her into my personal fan club.  She is just so filled with life!  If anyone is willing to suspend belief in the credibility of the script, and just go along with the sheer exuberance of the film, they can have a great time.True, there are lots of ""flaws"" for the serious film goer which is probaly why critics didn't like it.  Besides a silly story, the casting is somewhat strange, especially the three men.  Colin Firth, whom I adored in so many roles, is awkward and looks embarrased for most of the film.  But that is his character!  And I give him credit for putting himself in such an embarrasing position.Pierce Brosnan is good as the aging cute guy who can't sing but gives it a try.  He is losing his looks but that's good for the role, too.  He's just a guy who made a mistake and has paid for it and now is getting another chance.  The Swedish fellow seemed well cast.Amanda Seyfried was perfect as the prettiest little gumdrop of a girl you'd ever want to see in a movie.  She was more than a pretty face, too, she acted very well.  The scene where Streep prepares her for her wedding brought tears to my eyes.  Christine Baranski, an actress I never liked, was terrific here.  I loved the bit where she has an almost-romance with an adorable young Black barboy.  Julie Walters was terrific, too.  I was glad to see that each of them had a chance to shine.  The numbers with the three of them performing were wonderful!  So much energy, so much joy!I can see now why Streep and the rest chose to make this less-than-Oscar-worthy film---for the sheer fun of it!  It really comes across.

I saw the Broadway showduring its opening week on Broadway in 2001 and it was sensational.It was about a month or two after 9/11 and God knows New Yorkers needed something to take their minds of the recent tragic events and this show filled that request for 2 hours on an Autumn night, with singing and dancing in the aisles of the theater.  This film however, does not come close to the magic of the stage production.  It would have been nice to try and find actors that could actually sing and not just light up a marquee.  I used to think I could watch Colin Firth read the phone book - - maybe I still could but could not tolerate him singing one.  I am not going to explain the storyin this review as it has been done already.  All I can offer is a bunch of great actors that cannot sing who are all seriously miscast in a musical.

I also have to admit that Tom Hanks' and Rita Wilson's movie version of the Broadway musical hit ""Mamma Mia"" (2008) is, well, disappointing. (Their chance to ""clean up"" this potentially fun musical is now lost.)Benny's & Bjorn's music score happily resonates from the stage into this Greek isle flick (in deed, original Abba tunes and singing nicely underscore the entire movie background music). For the Abba-fanatics it is about their music!The acting and singing, however, leave much to be desired. Everyone, except maybe the movie producers, knows that Abba music is best sung by female sopranos. Pierce Brosnan's tenor is higher than Meryl Streep's alto (together they butcher the classics from Agnetta and Frida!). Although James Bond (Brosnan's 55) may fit as Sophie's (well played by Amanda Seyfried) dad (better as granddad), Streep is totally miscast as Donna the mom (her grandma look-a-like jumps about like no other 59 year old can!). Lloyd's direction isn't up to par either- often actor heads bounce off the tops of the screen and sideways, out of view, as the camera can't keep up with chorographic telemetry.The Greek isle and Mediterranean present a fairy tale ambiance, but this movie is not oriented for the family. Alcohol, sexuality, provocative innuendo, questionable language, fleshy dancing, and mature ""comedy"" all flow here (oddly, with all the other nasties going on in this movie, the final credits proffer an apology only for a very minor reference to tobacco- one brief unlit stogie).This Hollywood flick's licentiousness is a far cry from Abba's original music that scores sing along words, images of mutual respect, flirtive romance, and fun spandex. ""Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find..."" in this screen play.Abba purists will find this movie limiting and possibly unattractive. No recommendation is made to those considering watching this flick other than to take Donna the mom's advice in an early scene, ""Don't think about it"".",3,Disappointing,1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,2114,"['admit', 'am', 'life-long', 'Abba', 'fan', 'owning', 'still', 'original', 'vinyl', 'few', '8', 'tracks', 'most', 'earliest', 'posters', 'etc.', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'movie', 'version', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'hit', 'Mamma', 'Mia', '2008', 'well', 'disappointing', 'chance', 'clean', 'up', 'potentially', 'fun', 'musical', 'now', 'lost', 'Benny', 'Bjorn', 'music', 'score', 'happily', 'stage', 'Greek', 'isle', 'flick', 'deed', 'original', 'Abba', 'tunes', 'singing', 'nicely', 'entire', 'movie', 'background', 'music', 'Abba-fanatics', 'music', 'acting', 'singing', 'however', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Everyone', 'maybe', 'movie', 'producers', 'Abba', 'music', 'best', 'sung', 'female', 'sopranos', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'tenor', 'higher', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'alto', 'together', 'butcher', 'classics', 'Agnetta', 'Frida', 'James', 'Bond', 'Brosnan', '55', 'may', 'fit', 'Sophie', 'well', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'dad', 'better', 'granddad', 'Streep', 'totally', 'miscast', 'Donna', 'mom', 'grandma', 'look-a-like', 'jumps', 'other', '59', 'year', 'old', 'can', 'Lloyd', 'direction', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'either-', 'often', 'actor', 'heads', 'bounce', 'off', 'tops', 'screen', 'sideways', 'view', 'camera', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'chorographic', 'telemetry.The', 'Greek', 'isle', 'Mediterranean', 'present', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ambiance', 'movie', 'not', 'oriented', 'family', 'Alcohol', 'sexuality', 'provocative', 'innuendo', 'questionable', 'language', 'fleshy', 'dancing', 'mature', 'comedy', 'flow', 'here', 'oddly', 'other', 'nasties', 'going', 'movie', 'final', 'credits', 'proffer', 'apology', 'only', 'very', 'minor', 'reference', 'tobacco-', 'one', 'brief', 'unlit', 'stogie', '.This', 'Hollywood', 'flick', 'licentiousness', 'far', 'cry', 'Abba', 'original', 'music', 'sing', 'words', 'images', 'mutual', 'respect', 'flirtive', 'romance', 'fun', 'spandex', 'Where', 'are', 'happy', 'days', 'seem', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'screen', 'play.Abba', 'purists', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'limiting', 'possibly', 'unattractive', 'recommendation', 'made', 'considering', 'watching', 'flick', 'other', 'take', 'Donna', 'mom', 'advice', 'early', 'scene', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think']",N/A

Well, I loved it, and judging by the reviews there are a lot of folks who hate it, so mark me down as a strong five.This movie grabbed me so tightly I spent half the time standing five feet in front of the screen, not content to watch from across the family room.  It brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion, and most especially as it reached the cresendo of discovery and shared emotions among the three dads (one of whom emerges as the last man standing), the young couple, and the star of the movie, a vampish Meryl Streep whose eye make-up alone made her a completely different person, a truly remarkable touch of art.The two ""mature"" female supporting actresses were spectacular, and the young actress featured is going to be seen again.  Tom Hanks was involved in this movie as an executive producer, and overall, I could not find a single disappointment in this movie.The cheoreography and imagination--for example, all the men in the cast dancing down the pier in flippers--is great, and over-all this movie hangs together very well.The singing was fine and not the centerpiece for for one who loves musicial, more than enough to check that box--the producers do avery fine job of balancing actual singing ""live"" and studio singing overlain for the longer pieces.  The words mattered, and I can see how a cult might develop around this movie and the songs from the one group that is featured.  The scenery was spectacular and although not a central aspect of the script, breathtaking as a supporting element.Anyone that is a romantic and loves musical should buy this rather than renting--as some other reviewers have noted, this is one of those movies you can watch multiple times, always notice something new, and never tire of having it on.Other romance musicals that I have:De-LovelyBeyond the SeaBride and PrejudiceWalk the Line (Widescreen Edition)My Fair LadyThe Sound of Music (Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition)Grease (Rockin' Rydell Edition)West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)Oklahoma!

Powers ""show maniac""","[2, 3]","Watching this movie is like visiting a seaside amusement park with its ferris wheel and whirling carousel-strolling through a gaudy and brightly colored penny arcade-feasting on cotton candy and salt water taffy-walking barefoot on the sand with your own dancing queen.  Thirty years on the songs of ABBA are still delightful and deliciously infectious as ever and elevate this paper-thin wisp of a story. The main thrust of the movie is a young bride-to-be(Sophie) anxious to find out which of her mothers(Donna) three lovers is her dad. Unlike the original show which made it obvious who the dad was, the movie does not settle the question and instead all three potential dads declare each is 1/3 Sophies father.Meryl Streep playing Donna is wonderful and takes a break from her usual more serious roles and is obviously having a ball.  A new actress named Amanda Seyfried as Sophie is a real find and she is the best singer in the movie.  Unfortunatly one of her songs ""The Name of the Game"" was cut from the film and was presumably sung after she has a spat with her husband-to-be,Sky.  The next time you see the pair they are as happy as clams so both the missing song and the missing subsequent making-up scene leaves a gap in the movie. But why complain? The movie is so vibrant and perky and loaded with some of ABBAS' best songs, fun performances, colorful costumes and scenery the lapse is but a breeze in a hurricane of entertainment.I can't end this without a mention of the much maligned Pierce Brosnan and his attempted homicide of singing.  I think I have solved the problem-he sings through his nose suffering from a headcold.  However I have to give him props for his brave and not bad at all rendition of ""When All is Said and Done""-nose and all.Very nice movie and if you can't have ABBA at least you have some of their biggest hits delightfully performed.",5,MAMMA MIA,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,1875,"['Watching', 'movie', 'visiting', 'seaside', 'amusement', 'park', 'ferris', 'wheel', 'whirling', 'carousel-strolling', 'gaudy', 'brightly', 'colored', 'penny', 'arcade-feasting', 'cotton', 'candy', 'salt', 'water', 'taffy-walking', 'barefoot', 'sand', 'own', 'dancing', 'queen', 'Thirty', 'years', 'songs', 'ABBA', 'are', 'still', 'delightful', 'deliciously', 'infectious', 'ever', 'elevate', 'paper-thin', 'wisp', 'story', 'main', 'thrust', 'movie', 'young', 'bride-to-be', 'Sophie', 'anxious', 'find', 'out', 'mothers', 'Donna', 'three', 'lovers', 'dad', 'original', 'show', 'made', 'obvious', 'who', 'dad', 'was', 'movie', 'not', 'settle', 'question', 'instead', 'three', 'potential', 'dads', 'declare', '1/3', 'Sophies', 'father.Meryl', 'Streep', 'playing', 'Donna', 'wonderful', 'break', 'usual', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'obviously', 'having', 'ball', 'new', 'actress', 'named', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Sophie', 'real', 'find', 'best', 'singer', 'movie', 'Unfortunatly', 'one', 'songs', 'Name', 'Game', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'presumably', 'sung', 'spat', 'husband-to-be', 'Sky', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'pair', 'are', 'as', 'happy', 'clams', 'missing', 'song', 'missing', 'subsequent', 'making-up', 'scene', 'gap', 'movie', 'why', 'complain', 'movie', 'so', 'vibrant', 'perky', 'loaded', 'ABBAS', 'best', 'songs', 'fun', 'performances', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'lapse', 'breeze', 'hurricane', 'entertainment.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'end', 'mention', 'much', 'maligned', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'attempted', 'homicide', 'singing', 'think', 'have', 'solved', 'problem-he', 'sings', 'nose', 'suffering', 'headcold', 'However', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'brave', 'not', 'bad', 'rendition', 'When', 'Said', 'Done', '-nose', 'all.Very', 'nice', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ABBA', 'least', 'have', 'biggest', 'hits', 'delightfully', 'performed']",N/A

Amd whenever any such work is so narrowly aimed, it is bound to be sub-standard.I realize that this was a successful play with music by a popular source.  Maybe the play was okay--but not for me.  The plot of the movie, however, is lame, lame, lame--one for all the prospective fathers of the bride.  The casting was grossly inappropriate with few exceptions.  I just saw the movie and can't remember a single song.  The scenery was nice enough, but most varied, according to IMDB.  It was shot at a couple of places in Greece--and partly in a London studio--and on California beaches, probably because there sere no nice beaches on that Greek isle.  So the producers couldn't even be honest or coherent with the background.  If you want to visit that Greek island after this, you'll need to include the Pacific Ocean, etc.Now, the movie felt interminable.  It was very poorly edited, with meaningless scenes and dialogue.

But, here's how I see that some people will be divided on its overall appeal:For people who've heard of ABBA and may know a couple of their songs, this film will definitely make you wanna run out and buy some ABBA CD's.  For those of us (like me) who already have all of ABBA's CD's and have cherished ABBA all their life, these actors singing ABBA songs is rather dull and much less energetically expressive than the ever-vivacious vocal outbursts of Annafrid and Agnetha (the original girls of ABBA).The original songs from ABBA have incredibly talented harmonizing and enthusiasm.  None of these actors can hit the notes like Agnetha and Annafrid (also known as Frida) did in their day.  And especially Pierce Brosnan. This was an embarrassing transition from being a former James Bond.However, I'm glad to see a movie made as a musical to many of ABBA's fabulous songs.  Pick up ABBA's greatest hits on CD, or just go ahead and get all eight of their original albums.  You will be in for a treat!Let me give you one good example of the girls of ABBA belting their voices out so strong.

Comparing their opinion of the stage show to the movie, I believe this movie could have been much better than it was.My overall comment is that the casting choices were interesting -- and not in a good way -- for a musical.  Perhaps the best feature of the DVD is the option to put it on sing-along mode so you can belt out the great ABBA tunes and not have to hear some of the less-than-fabulous cast singing.First, Pierce Brosnan should never sing anywhere but his shower; and then only if no one is around to hear him.  I used to believe that studio ""tweaking"" could make anyone sound halfway decent.  If that's the best they could do with his voice, he must have been just awful.  Didn't anyone ask him to sing before casting him?  There are many actors old enough to be the father of a 20-year-old; they could have found one who could sing.Colin Firth is probably too young for his role; he's a decade younger than Ms. Streep and the other guys.  He and Stellan Skrsgard sang better than Pierce Brosnan, but neither one is really a singer.  Meryl Streep does OK with the vocals but that role has the most singing so it would have been better to cast a singing actress, like Patti LuPone.  The best cast role is the daughter; Amanda Seyfried did a good job.I loved the setting and the staging of the group musical numbers was good.  And of course the ABBA songs that are the whole point of the musical.  I think if the producers had gone with a cast of singers rather than big name stars, the movie would have been much better.  I'll also note that parents should think about the movie's message before deciding whether to let their children watch it.  In the wedding scene, the daughter tells her mother it's OK she slept around so much she doesn't know who her father is and decides she doesn't want to get married either but just see the world with her fianc&eacute;.

1197563,A27KQ8MMLNFD1B,B001GKJ2DO,Sara,"[2, 3]","This movie reminds me of the romantic comedy musicals of the 1930's: nothing more than pure escapism during tough economic times. Those classic musicals were full of catchy songs, hot stars, and storylines that were fun if not highly improbable. But nobody cared because it was the Depression and anything was better than reality. ""Mamma Mia!"" fits this mold - it's the escapist movie for the Great Recession of 2008-2009. It's full of catchy ABBA music many people know and love. It has hot stars, including the best actress of our day, Meryl Streep (is there a role she can't do?). It takes place on an idyllic Grecian island far away from the problems of the modern world. And it has the rather improbable, but fun, storyline of a bride-to-be inviting three of her mother's past lovers to her wedding to see which one is her real dad. Though musicals are pretty much out of fashion these days, ""Mamma Mia!"" is a bit more accessible to the masses. It uses familiar pop tunes and the singers are pretty average, lending them a more human quality. No polished Broadway voices of the likes of Barbra Streisand or Julie Andrews to make you feel inadequate.

It is such feel good fun, you will love it.In this brilliant, joyful film adaption of the hit stage show, 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) lives with her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on the small Greek island of Kalokairi where Donna runs a hotel called Villa Donna.Sophie is about to be married and discovers that any one of 3 men could be her father. But is it Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) or Bill (Stellan Skarsgard)?Sophie invites all 3 men to her wedding without telling Donna, who was the singer in a group called Donna and the Dynamos.Glorious music and songs, imaginatively staged numbers and a fine sense of fun are present in this film. I loved it!While Pierce Brosnan sounds awful, and sings like a lawnmower - and Colin Firth sounds rather nasal when singing ""Last Summer"" on guitar - in a funny way, the casting of actors who sing like us plebs works and adds to the fun and charm of the film. The wedding setting also works because you can imagine everyone at a wedding getting up and dancing or singing.Meryl Streep has an excellent singing voice which will astonish sceptics, and I also thought the actress playing the daughter sang well!The passionate renditions of The Winner Takes It All and Thank You For The Music are my highlights, and yet some uptempo songs are great too (Waterloo, Lay All Your Love On Me etc). I also think there are 1 or 2 touching moments in the film.Yes the screenplay is very cheesy, and it may be camp as Christmas, but you will surely leave the theatre smiling.Delightful.",5,Don't feel embarrassed - this movie is a delight!,1227830400,"11 28, 2008",2008,1689,"['male', 'probably', 'shouldnt', 'say', 'public', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'ABBA', 'music', 'should', ""n't"", 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'seeing', 'film', 'such', 'feel', 'good', 'fun', 'will', 'love', 'it.In', 'brilliant', 'joyful', 'film', 'adaption', 'hit', 'stage', 'show', '20-year-old', 'Sophie', 'Sheridan', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'mother', 'Donna', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'small', 'Greek', 'island', 'Kalokairi', 'where', 'Donna', 'hotel', 'called', 'Villa', 'Donna.Sophie', 'be', 'married', 'discovers', 'one', '3', 'men', 'could', 'be', 'father', 'Sam', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Harry', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Bill', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Sophie', '3', 'men', 'wedding', 'telling', 'Donna', 'who', 'was', 'singer', 'group', 'called', 'Donna', 'Dynamos.Glorious', 'music', 'songs', 'imaginatively', 'staged', 'numbers', 'fine', 'sense', 'fun', 'are', 'present', 'film', 'loved', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'awful', 'sings', 'lawnmower', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'rather', 'nasal', 'when', 'singing', 'Last', 'Summer', 'guitar', 'funny', 'way', 'casting', 'actors', 'who', 'sing', 'plebs', 'works', 'fun', 'charm', 'film', 'wedding', 'setting', 'also', 'can', 'imagine', 'everyone', 'wedding', 'getting', 'up', 'dancing', 'singing.Meryl', 'Streep', 'excellent', 'singing', 'voice', 'will', 'astonish', 'sceptics', 'also', 'thought', 'actress', 'playing', 'daughter', 'sang', 'well', 'passionate', 'renditions', 'Winner', 'Takes', 'All', 'Thank', 'Music', 'are', 'highlights', 'yet', 'uptempo', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Waterloo', 'Lay', 'All', 'Your', 'Love', 'Me', 'etc', 'also', 'think', 'are', '1', '2', 'touching', 'moments', 'film.Yes', 'screenplay', 'very', 'cheesy', 'may', 'be', 'camp', 'Christmas', 'will', 'surely', 'leave', 'theatre', 'smiling.Delightful']",N/A

1197586,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001GKJ2DO,Stephanie De Pue,"[14, 15]","""Mamma Mia,""a new romantic musical comedy of a film, arrives, bringing joy to many.  It is based on the stage play of the same name that was a major international hit, and, ultimately, on the internationally popular music, largely disco-style, of the 1970's Swedish group ABBA.  The film, which I'd have to guess mainly appeals to women, older women at that, is a product of women to some degree: written by Catherine Johnson, directed by Phyllida Lloyd.  And, as you might expect, it generally has not been popular with mainstream critics, particularly the male ones.The film is lovely to look at: it's set, as was the stage play, on one of those picturesque Greek islands; and the breathtaking exteriors were filmed on one of them.  Interiors, however, and the major setting, Villa Donna, the small resort owned by the major character, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), supposedly on that Greek island, were filmed at Pinewood Studios, England.  Some critics have complained about the cinematography, but really, who can carp when it's showing such lovely views?  I also found it slightly too long; there was a hard-to-believe moment when I was a little tired of big, pull out all the stops, production numbers.The plot's simple enough, even silly, and downright illogical and unscientific.  Donna, who was a tribute performer back in her day - and ABBA's --largely doing their material, it appears, would be the first to tell you, as she labors in her only moderately successful little resort, that she's a reformed slut.  Her daughter, Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried), has, accordingly, never known her father.  And Sophie's getting married now to Sky (Dominic Cooper); she wants her father to give her away.  So she finds Mom's old diary, identifies the three most likely candidates, and sends them invites: apparently Donna was prescient enough to identify them in her diary not only by their full names, but by what would be their addresses twenty years later.  (Pity she didn't identify them by their DNA at the same time; her daughter would have been spared so much uncertainty.)  The three men show up: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan, former James Bond); Harry Bright (the dishy Colin Firth), and Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard, generally considered to be a serious actor, and a good one.) Just to add to the fun, Donna's former singing partners show up too: Tanya (Christine Baranski, an American musical comedy and television performer) and Rosie (Julie Walters, a respected serious British actress).  Two of daughter Sophie's friends show up too, the movie's crazy for triads.Well, these performers have to sing, of course, those ABBA songs.  It was obviously no problem for Streep; she appears to be having a great time of it.  But then, she's that phenomenon that famed Broadway guru Hal Prince once highly praised, an actress that can sing: and I've seen her sing previously inPostcards from the Edge, andA Prairie Home Companion, among other films.  Critics have complained that her ""Winner Takes It All"" is over baked; if they'd seen the stage show, as I have, they'd know that song functions as what Broadway calls ""the 11 o'clock number."" That is, the song, near the end of the show that producers rely on to send the audience out humming, and recommending the entertainment to their friends.  It's supposed to be powerfully presented, guys.  Major complaints about Brosnan's voice, too: we can all agree he'll never be invited to the Metropolitan Opera, but, still, his voice is perfectly adequate to the task.  However, the critics have praised Walters' closing number, delivered as the mythical ancient ""Fountain of Aphrodite,"" which Donna's inn is supposedly built over, explodes during a minor earthquake.  Walters has a get up on the table, knock `em dead, shake your money maker classic here; and she deserves every syllable of praise she gets.Basically, despite the attractive and talented young leads, the show functions as an evocative middle-aged romance, of which the media give us too few.  This one is really meant for people who were around at the time, dancing to ABBA; something for the girls, in particular: that would be the older girls now.  I've seen a TV documentary on ABBA, and all four of the quartet agreed: even while they were recording ""Dancing Queen,"" they knew it would be a monster hit.  And it was, and it is still.  My favorite scene: as the entire island apparently breaks into that song, a Greek farm woman, no longer young, carrying a heavy load of kindling on her head, thinks about it, decides there's time enough to carry kindling, sets it down and joins the dance.  Fellas: throughout life, most women are carrying heavy loads of kindling: and we enjoy the chance to set them down and dance.  As various people have said, life is short and death is long: and you'd better dance while you can, little man.  Little woman, too.  In fact, I've said it before and I'll say it again, Gloria Gaynor's monster, international disco hit, ""I Will Survive,"" functions as an anthem to current day women, well beyond the English-speaking world.  And any English-speaking woman who claims not to know it is a liar.To be sure, rock critics of the day always hated disco, and you still see the odd bumper sticker, ""Disco Sucks.""  Why ever?  Well, having the biggest ""cojones"" was important to those largely male critics, and disco was loved, heavens, by gays.  And women, and quite ordinary people, who liked to dance.  And the songs said nothing whatever about the state of the world, or Euclidean geometry.  Seems to me many of today's movie critics hearken back to these guys.  However, very recently, I saw a newspaper article that said medical men had found that people delivering CPR (Cardio pulmonary resuscitation) to people with failing hearts were most successful doing it to the Bee Gees' seminal disco tune ""Staying Alive."" It helped the rescuers even to be thinking the tune, or singing it to themselves, because, you see, the song has slightly more than 100 beats a minute, and so has the heart.  The medical men didn't know the reason, but I do. Because I once saw a documentary about the Australian group, the Bee Gees, generally considered the fathers of disco, who said that they took that beat from the Australian aborigines.  That song, folks, is in the key of life.",5,Songs In the Key of Life,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,6331,"['Mamma', 'Mia', 'new', 'romantic', 'musical', 'comedy', 'film', 'bringing', 'joy', 'many',

I'm man enough to admit that I actually enjoy musicals.  At least in most cases I do.  With Mamma Mia!, at least the movie version (as found on Blu-ray and DVD), well, not so much.Mamma Mia! has been 'a worldwide phenomenon' for as long as I can remember... going back to TV ads blaring for the broadway type show.  Not quite as far back as the days when the band that the music came from was making music, but still for quite a long time.  Inspired by the music of ABBA (sorry, I can't make the backwards B character there), Mamma Mia! uses many of those songs to provide the sound track and even dialogue for a story about a daughter that is getting married, from a single mother who isn't sure which of 3 men fathered that daughter during a magical year many years ago.As a story Mamma Mia! is entertaining enough, and the actors in the film actually do well with their roles except.... well, except for the fact that they have to sing and need to be convincing enough to not have viewers feeling that they're watching a bunch of lip syncing.  It is in this area that Mamma Mia! fails for me, thanks to singing that seems out of sync with the songs that I remember, and worse, thanks to singing from an actor or two that were cast in the film who frankly shouldn't be allowed to sing at all.As a singer, lets just say that Pierce Brosnan shouldn't consider changing his line of work.  It may not be totally horrible, but it's enough to make you wish that Brosnan was busy working on a Bond film or something similar.Meryl Streep does ok with her vocal stylings, but again the pace of some of the singing she does just seems completely off when compared to the radio played songs that they were taken from.Watch this if you feel inspired to, but think carefully before purchase.

Its thin plot was conceived to tie together a catalogue of ABBA songs.  Donna (Meryl Streep) is an independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on a picture-perfect Greek island.  Her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is about to be married and Donna has invited to the wedding two lifelong friends from her one-time singing group, Donna and the Dynamos -- multi-divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski) and practical, no-nonsense Rosie (Julie Walters).  Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own.  Longing to discover the identity of her father so he can walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier -- Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan), and Harry (Colin Firth).Streep's Donna is far afield from any role the actress has played before.  It's light, almost buoyant, as Donna sings her heart out, dances on a pier, or looks mortified when she meets her three beaus from decades past.  The songs by ABBA include ""Dancing Queen,"" ""S.O.S.,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" and ""Money, Money, Money.""  When you finish watching the film, the songs will remain in your head for hours, if not days.  You'll have to decide if that's a good or a bad thing.  Both Baranski, with her trademark deadpan delivery, and Walters, with take-no-prisoners energy, provide ample comic relief.

As Sophie, Amanda Seyfried carries her songs probably better than anyone here. Even as she is the focal point of ""Mamma Mia,"" the story is ultimately Streep's. It is Donna's crisis of parenthood (the flimsy set-up where Sophie invites her three probable fathers to her wedding) that forms the crux of the movie. The musical numbers spin off in all direction, not always conducive to the plot.Be that as it may, we watched the ""sing-along"" version of the film is great fun, and Streep's version of ""The Winner Takes It All"" is a show-stopper. I also defy you not to sing along to either ""Dancing Queen"" or ""Waterloo"" (done as a campy finale with the principals in ABBA period costumes). Also noted, none of the male leads can sing worth a lick, although the story that Brosnan didn't know he was being cast in a musical is pretty funny (he was approached with the offer to play a male lead in a movie with Meryll Streep, then was told what the movie was AFTER he accepted). But if you accept ""Mamma Mia"" for what it is, a big hunk of feel-good fun, you won't come away disappointed.Now where is that Movie adaptation ofWe Will Rock You?",3,Frothy Fun on the Greek Isles,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2015,"['James', 'Bond', 'sings', 'film', 'adaptation', 'smashMamma', 'Mia', 'Musical', 'Based', 'Songs', 'ABBA', 'lot', 'going', 'least', 'immensely', 'likable', 'songs', 'ABBA', 'anchor', 'movie', 'familiarity', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'cast', 'packed', 'exuberance', 'cheer', 'Then', 'again', '59', 'Meryll', 'Streep', 'film', 'presence', 'former', 'girl-group', 'singer', 'retired', 'island', 'resort', 'Packed', 'good', 'cheer', 'great', 'music', 'eye', 'catching', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'frothy', 'glittery', 'foam', 'riding', 'tops', 'island', 'wave', 'also', 'just', 'about', 'substantial.As', 'Donna', 'Streep', 'just', 'shimmers', 'gal-pals', 'Tanya', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'Rosie', 'Julie', 'Waters', 'have', 'scene', 'stealing', 'moments', 'When', 'Tanya', 'loose', 'flirtatious', 'younger', 'man', 'Does', 'Your', 'Mother', 'Know', 'one', 'funniest', 'bits', 'movie', 'Sophie', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'songs', 'probably', 'better', 'anyone', 'here', 'Even', 'focal', 'point', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'story', 'ultimately', 'Streep', 'Donna', 'crisis', 'parenthood', 'flimsy', 'set-up', 'where', 'Sophie', 'three', 'probable', 'fathers', 'wedding', 'crux', 'movie', 'musical', 'numbers', 'spin', 'off', 'direction', 'not', 'always', 'conducive', 'plot.Be', 'may', 'watched', 'sing-along', 'version', 'film', 'great', 'fun', 'Streep', 'version', 'Winner', 'Takes', 'All', 'show-stopper', 'also', 'defy', 'not', 'sing', 'along', 'Dancing', 'Queen', 'Waterloo', 'done', 'campy', 'finale', 'principals', 'ABBA', 'period', 'costumes', 'Also', 'noted', 'none', 'male', 'leads', 'can', 'sing', 'lick', 'story', 'Brosnan', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'being', 'cast', 'musical', 'pretty', 'funny', 'was', 'approached', 'offer', 'play', 'male', 'lead', 'movie', 'Meryll', 'Streep', 'then', 'was', 'told', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'AFTER', 'accepted', 'accept', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'what', 'big', 'hunk', 'feel-good', 'fun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'disappointed.Now', 'where', 'Movie', 'adaptation', 'ofWe', 'Will', 'Rock']",N/A

Sure, they aren't all recording stars, and Brosnan can scarcely carry a tune, but the premise of the film/musical is delightful.  Getting married?  Look for your Dad, or dads in the case of Sophia.  I think the best part of the film is probably Sophia standing in the church screaming that she doesn't care how many men she slept with while the 'dads' scramble and the priest looks on.  This could have been a Jane Austen ending with two weddings, but it's not!The music is wonderful, and the acting is almost clumsy.  But with the film set up, it can't help it.

I won't belabor what other reviewers have said so well; but, for my own two cents, the thing that most destroys this piece is CASTING.  Meryl Streep is insane beyond belief as the mother of the bride.  Grandmother, maybe; she looks so old in this film that her very first appearance on screen ruins everything before and after.  Streep's face looks like a leather glove with two slits for eyes; apparently, too much cosmetic surgery has tightened her skin until it has pulled her eyes back into small slots.  I became a slightly nauseous at having to look at that face on-screen over the course of the film.Streep's ancient look made everything else absurd- her former lovers look like her children in comparison, and from the apparent age of her ""daughter"" in the film, her character would have had to have given birth in her mid-70's.I am with many other reviewers who marvel at how writers and directors can take top notch actors, music, and scenery and throw it all away, creating a horrific and, if there is any mercy in the world, a quickly forgettable moment in cinema madness.",1,"Lord have mercy!

In addition to those irresistible ABBA numbers, you've got nice locations (of the beautiful coast in Greece), plus the talented cast, veterans and newcomers. Sadly there are two things that ""Mamma Mia!"" doesn't have: story and direction.Well, there is a story, but a very thin one. Three former boyfriends of Donna (Meryl Streep) travel to an old hotel Donna runs on a small island in Greece after so many years' absence. The three men (played by Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgrd and Pierce Brosnan) are in fact secretly invited by Donna's only daughter, 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), who is going to be married.You will be told that far in the first ten minutes and ... that's all. The entire cast did well (OK, Pierce Brosnan needs singling lessen, I admit). Obviously they had a good time making this film and you can feel that in the end credits, but ""Mamma Mia!"" stops there. The characters sing and dance and it is fun to see them doing it, but their dancing and songs, or the lyrics, need to be incorporated into the story. First-time director Phyllida Lloyd (who also did the stage version) just doesn't know the rhythm of filmed musical, missing the timing of music--how to build up the emotion and when to start and stop the tunes. The songs, great as they are, begin and end rather randomly.Great musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" have a good story to tell. You've got great songs and actors in ""Mamma Mia!"" but you need something more to draw the audience into the film's world. To do so ""Mamma Mia!"" depends upon the enthusiastic acting of the cast. You got Meryl Streep and she will not disappoint. Those who have seen such films as ""Postcards from the Edge"" and ""Ironweed"" know Meryl Streep can really sing. And she does not just sing, but bring energy to her performance and she does it again in ""Mamma Mia!"" Maybe too much of energy, but it is fun.

Amanda Seyfried does a very nice job but Pierce Brosnan, et al ruined it for me.

Meryl Streep running around with the stringiest hair I've ever seen was not a fun image to say the least.  I can see the empowerment that this movie brings - especially to older women but sadly very few are familiar with the original songs and who sings them.  For example, my mother loved the movie and wanted the soundtrack, not the ABBA singers.  I later had the opportunity to see &#34;Mamma&#34; on stage by a traveling Broadway cast and that was wonderful - much more what I would've liked to see in the movie.

The music would lift me and help me go on.  Recently I discovered that Mamma Mia performs a similar service.Mamma Mia is an excellent musical.  I remember the musicals of the 1940, 50 and 60s.  Often they had as much dialogue as singing.  Mamma Mia is almost continual singing, and the singing is cheerful and strong.  The music lifts my mood.Meryl Streep stars and sings up a storm.  I have enjoyed Meryl in so many movies and admire her talent.  Her talent, demonstrated in such varied work as  Sophie's Choice Kramer vs. Kramer and The Devil Wears Prada, did not prepare me for her performance as Donna in Mamma Mia.  Not only is she outstanding in her role, she  sings well.Several other actors are excellent in their roles.  Amanda Seyfried is brilliant as Donna's daughter Sophie.  Christine Baranski (recently in The Good Wife) and Julie Walters (Famous as Molly Weasley in Harry Potter films), are superior as Donna's best friends and former singing partners.Colin Firth (Oscar for King's Speech) plays one of Donna's former lovers.  His singing is great and his guitar playing is impressive.The biggest surprise for me was Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007) in the role of Donna's first lover.  Pierce can not sing nearly as well as the other actors but somehow we do not mind.  He is perfect as Donna's love interest.Mamma Mia is an entertaining film with a wonderful musical score.

Then there's the chick-lit comedy that she leads (or tries to), about strange family secrets emerging on the eve of her wedding. Throw in Abba's bouncy music, likeable again now that the disco era is fading from memory. Then add Meryl Streep in a physically comedic role, with Pierce Brosnan and lots of others pulling their weight. You already know that it's going to end up OK - not just in the romantic plot, but as a movie, too.Lots more makes it work, as well. The ongoing visual gag of the ""Greek chorus"" never palls. A few points really stood out, like the bachelor party descending on the bachelorette party, merging them both into some neo-primitive fertility rite (clothes on, if it matters). But Streep and her co-stars really made this movie. She comes across as a strong and active, but decidedly mature character - as befits a woman whose age startled me when I looked it up on IMDB. Two other I-know-that-face actresses form a trio with her, and come from the same age group. I found it absolutely delightful to see these ladies being honest about their ages in these roles, but still as playful as schoolgirls, even to bouncing on the bed and to resurrecting their years-ago girl band to entertain Sophie's wedding eve. Maybe you have to be of the graying age to appreciate it properly, but it was great to see women of my age (and up) with exciting histories and plenty of goofy excitement in their present days, too.But, amid all these enjoyable parts, a few stand out. One was that massive dance routine to ""Dancing Queen"" - I laughed so hard that my eyes watered continuously the whole length of it.

I took a chance on the movie version for one reason and one reason only:  Its cast.  With the possible exception of Pierce Brosnan, I love all of these actors, especially Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, Colin Firth and Christine Baranski, whose previous work I've greatly admired.  This is not so terrible a film as some people have stated.  All I can say to those who love to stamp every movie they don't like with the headline ""worst film I've ever seen"" is that frankly, if this inoffensive little concoction is the worst movie you've ever seen, then you're an extremely lucky movie goer, because I've seen some dogs that make Mamma Mia look like ""A Man For All Seasons.""  The main problem I had with this movie was with my own personal inability to separate the songs from the original artist.  To me it was like watching the ultimate chick flick with some pretty bad renditions of ABBA songs used as a narrative device.  If you're not a longtime ABBA fan and are not too familiar with these classic and first rate examples of pop music, it'll probably not make much difference to you who sings them and how they're sung, but in my head I just kept hearing the originals and couldn't help but feel they were the sole glue holding together an otherwise trite and boring story about young love, female camaraderie and rediscovering the joys of love.  To boot, the script is threadbare and makes no impact whatsoever on the viewer.  In short, fantastic songs, badly sung (for the most part) and used in a really mediocre vehicle.  I'll say this though, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, the location is awesome and it's a harmless enough little movie that the ladies, especially, will like.  The men, though, will no doubt be rolling their eyes and checking their watches begging to be put out of their misery.  I know I was.

It ran for almost 3 months in theaters here in Manila where a hit movie would probably last up to three (3) weeks and a dud would just play for a few days. I saw this film almost 20 times in different theaters around Manila and saw how people from all ages - the teens to the older generation - enjoyed the film. Maybe it was the music, maybe it was the acting and the singing, maybe it was the lush setting in Greece. It was all of these. The producers were able to weave a wonderful story of love lost and found amidst an impending wedding set in a remote Greek island with the timeless tunes of ABBA. What really helped in the appreciation of ABBA's music was the familiar arrangements which Benny and Bjorn did not change but even enhanced a bit. The familiarity really struck a nostalgic chord especially with the generation who grew up with ABBA's music. The showstopper of course was Dancing Queen played in the middle of the film where Donna and the Dynamos start singing in the room and go out into the streets and are joined by the village women in an anthem of woman empowerment. Even the finale is wonderful where they sing Dancing Queen as a trio with Waterloo as the fitting ending song where the Dynamos are joined by the men and the young couple Sophie and Sky. Believe it or not, in the Philippines, people never stay for the credits and in fact automatically head for the exit when a movie or a concert finishes (it's a given - they have no appreciation for credits and would rather be ahead of the rest in getting out of the venue) but with Mamma Mia! people really stayed to see Dancing Queen again and until Waterloo was over - and some stayed until the final notes of Thank You for the Music. I was aghast to read that critics bashed Mamma Mia! But this is plain amusing to most of the people who appreciated this wonderful film. Critics and bashers can say all the negative things they want but the people have spoken with it's resounding commercial success - Mamma Mia's soundtrack hit No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums and has been certified platinum (no ABBA album ever hit the Top 10 in the US). Mamma Mia! the movie has grossed almost $144 MM at the US box-office to make it the 4th biggest grossing musical of all time in the US (behind Grease, Chicago and The Sound of Music). Mamma Mia! the movie did even better in the UK because it has grossed 67 MM pounds and is the second biggest film of all time in the UK behind Titanic which grossed 69 MM pounds. Not bad indeed! Bravo to the cast! Meryl Streep proved in this film that she can do absolutely anything! America's finest actress is poised for a double win at the Golden Globes in 2009 -Best Actress in a Musical / Comedy for Mamma Mia! (her brilliant singing in Winner Takes it All alone can make her win the Globe) and Best Actress in a Drama for Doubt. A fitting reward for a truly great actress! The upcoming DVD deserves all the attention it can get. The perfect Christmas gift. Cheers!!!",5,MAMMA MIA!

What's new is seeing Meryl Streep unwind and let it all fly -- singing, dancing, acting -- well, we all knew she could act with the best, but who knew she could sing and dance as well? A great team of supporting actors and actresses, all of whom could sing (Pierce Brosnan excepted). Actually, I enjoyed Brosnan's performances, including his singing. Sometimes a little less polish and a little more realism carries the day. Brosnan could always deliver a line, and he has some key ones in this movie. I thought the big production numbers were very entertaining. I even enjoyed the plot line, although there were some cruel twists at the end. I won't spoil the movie by revealing the twists I didn't like, but they soured me enough to knock off what would otherwise have been a five star rating.As usual, it is best to ignore the professional movie critics. Something happens when you take money for your movie reviews, and it is not good. My wife and I enjoyed this fine, entertaining movie. I thought most of the cinematography was very good to excellent. The scene that a lot of people seem to be complaining about features a pretty amazing performance by Meryl Streep. That was captivating enough to draw my attention away from some supposed faults in the cinematography. Oh well, too busy enjoying the movie to be hypercritical.

I grew up on ABBA's music as my parents were fans and remember singing and dancing to ""Dancing Queen"" when I was seven (such memories!). I have loved ABBA ever since, and it was only recently that I actually got to watch the movie (sadly, on DVD, as I missed it during its theater run). Though the actors do not remotely resemble (nor sing like) the singers of ABBA, they more than make up for it with genuine chemistry and camaraderie. A viewer can tell these actors had great fun during the production of this musical/movie and their fun is incredibly infectious! I sang out loud and even danced to the old, familiar, classic songs, and had so much fun! The main cast is made up of famous actors - the incomparable Meryl Streep (who really showcases her beautiful singing voice here), the svelte Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters (I remember her most from her role as Mrs Weasley in the Harry Potter movie franchise), Pierce Brosnan (yes, he does not exactly have a great singing voice, but who cares???), Colin Firth (whose performance as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice left an indelible impression on me), Stellan Skarsgaard, and the two young and talented actors, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie, and Dominic Cooper as her fiance, Sky (the pair are a real-life couple and reportedly began dating on the set of the movie).The story begins with 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan who discovers that any one of three men (Brosnan, Firth, or Skarsgaard) could be her father. Wishing to have her father (Sophie was raised by her mother,Donna played by Meryl Streep) walk her down the aisle at her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper), Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. The clueless Donna invites her two former backup singers to the wedding (Baranski and Walters), and when she sees the three men from her past, all hell breaks loose, and so does the music! The plot is quite thin, and the characters are not explored in-depth here - but the focal point of the movie is the music. The plot revolves around the music, and the lively dance numbers showcase great choreography. The fashion is reminiscent of ABBA's heyday and the costumes are in a riot of colors - all in all, pure rip-roaring fun!This is a fun movie that brings back nostalgic memories.
