The fact that these episodes are of the syndication form doesn't upset me but I deducted half a point because it would be nice to see them in their full glory. The other half a point deducted came from the possibility that the episodes MIGHT not be in order. The first episode on the disk Brian had brownish hair and in the episodes that followed he had his blonde hair. On Wikipedia the episode guide lists the episodes in a completely different order then on the dvds. Then again there arent really any story arcs so the order doesnt matter as long as the premier and finale episode are first and last, which im not sure they are. Anyway, as for the show, 5 stars all the way, family friendly, funny, and even jokes intended for older audiences. For example when ALF is imitating the Golden Girls to entertain himself he(as one of the golden girls) ask Blanche, ""who are you sleeping with tonight?"" to which ALF replies as Blanche, ""Everyone""All in all, great show and dvd set but if youre over 25ish i can understand why you might be dissapointed.",4,Should really be 5 stars but.....,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1193,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', ""'m"", '16', 'have', 'never', 'saw', 'episodes', 'original', 'uncut', 'ways', 'only', 'when', 'did', 'rarely', 'did', 're-runs', 'cable', 'fact', 'episodes', 'are', 'syndication', 'form', ""n't"", 'upset', 'deducted', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'full', 'glory', 'other', 'point', 'deducted', 'came', 'possibility', 'episodes', 'MIGHT', 'not', 'be', 'order', 'first', 'episode', 'disk', 'Brian', 'had', 'brownish', 'hair', 'episodes', 'followed', 'had', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Wikipedia', 'episode', 'guide', 'episodes', 'completely', 'different', 'order', 'then', 'dvds', 'Then', 'again', 'arent', 'really', 'story', 'arcs', 'order', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'as', 'long', 'premier', 'finale', 'episode', 'are', 'first', 'last', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'Anyway', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'way', 'family', 'friendly', 'funny', 'even', 'jokes', 'intended', 'older', 'audiences', 'example', 'when', 'ALF', 'imitating', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'entertain', 'one', 'golden', 'girls', 'ask', 'Blanche', 'who', 'are', 'sleeping', 'tonight', 'ALF', 'Blanche', 'Everyone', 'great', 'show', 'dvd', 'set', 'youre', '25ish', 'i', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'might', 'be', 'dissapointed']",Alf: Season 2

As a long time Alf fan, I'm glad to see these on DVD, but my excitement is tinged with disappointment over them being edited.The DVD intros recorded by Alf are quite funny. The bit about more FBI warnings made me laugh out loud, as did some of the blooper reel - to hear Alf (mildly) swear made me and my wife really laugh out loud). The syndicated issue aside, the show is STILL damn funny - there's no getting around that issue. :)NOTE: There's a statement from Lion's Gate on why they have the syndicated versions over the originals online at tvshowsondvd dot com - look in their Alf section.NOTE 2: This is almost the exact same review I wrote for Series 1 of Alf on DVD.  Since Lion's Gate showed no effort in putting the original versions on DVD, I don't think I need to write something different for my S2 review over my S1 review.",3,"Show's funny, gets less stars for the syndicated thing",1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,1246,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'already', 'know', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'not', 'original', 'NBC', 'ones', 'shame', 'wife', 'watched', 'show', 'Day', '1.It', 'nice', 'have', 'DVD', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'original', 'uncut', 'ones', 'Hell', 'yeah', ""'ll"", 'take', 'this.The', 'comments', 'Alf', 'DVD', 'menus', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'blooper', 'reel', 'awesome', 'long', 'time', 'Alf', 'fan', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'DVD', 'excitement', 'tinged', 'disappointment', 'being', 'edited.The', 'DVD', 'intros', 'recorded', 'Alf', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'bit', 'more', 'FBI', 'warnings', 'made', 'loud', 'did', 'blooper', 'reel', 'hear', 'Alf', 'mildly', 'swear', 'made', 'wife', 'really', 'out', 'loud', 'syndicated', 'issue', 'aside', 'show', 'STILL', 'damn', 'funny', 'getting', 'around', 'issue', 'NOTE', 'statement', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'why', 'have', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'originals', 'online', 'tvshowsondvd', 'dot', 'com', 'look', 'Alf', 'section.NOTE', '2', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'review', 'wrote', 'Series', '1', 'Alf', 'DVD', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'showed', 'effort', 'putting', 'original', 'versions', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'write', 'something', 'different', 'S2', 'review', 'S1', 'review']",Alf: Season 2

The episode where ALF tries to change his ways is quite funny, so is the one where he tries to boost the ratings of his favorite television program that's at risk of cancellation.  Many of my favorite ALF episodes are in this season.The second season DVD packaging is much better than the first.  Discs are no longer piled on top of one another.  Pop in a disc, and you'll be treated to a couple minutes worth of the ALF Shopping Network, before being prompted to select an episode.  The menus are, once again, well constructed.The episodes are syndicated again for season 2, but it doesn't bother me that much.  I didn't have the chance to watch ALF when it was new, so I don't know the difference.  Plus, ALF is no longer on TV, meaning the only way to see the shows is on these DVDs.  For a show like The Cosby Show that is still on the air, the DVD producers made a mistake by releasing syndicated episodes.
