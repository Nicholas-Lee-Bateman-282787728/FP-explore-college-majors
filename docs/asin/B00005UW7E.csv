It reminded me of the film: swing kids, or George Orwell's book, 1984. I'm not sure if the author of the film intended it this way, but there is a use of the symbol of ""red riding hood"" that I didn't catch while I watched the film. In the film, the main character becomes friends with a girl who was in a terrorist group called: ""the red riding hoods"". In the fable, Red Riding Hood doesn't realize the danger she is in when she goes into the house that has the disguized, lethal wolf in it.While we watch the film, Jin-Roh, we as members of the audience are like red riding hood. Not all of the people who look good to the audience are hero types and not all of the people who seem bad are bad guys. The characters in the film fall in and out of a lot of emotional traps and lethal traps as the story goes on. In the fable, little red riding hood doesn't realize that she is entering a house with the deadly wolf in it.  When we watch the film, we are also like innocent and vulnerable red riding hood-we don't know the eerie and dark experiences that will happen to us as we watch the film.",5,"Stunning.

686084,A2DSD0YP7IPCZ,B00005UW7E,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","In an alternate post-WWII scenario, Japan is on the brink of social chaos. The occupation has failed to turn Japan into a stable society by the late 1950s. Anti-government protesters and terrorists regularly battle with the authorities, setting off napalm cocktails and bombs. To combat the disorder, a storm-trooperesque division of the police--the Special Forces--is formed. This force is decked out in Nazi-style helmets with glowing red infrared eyeholes, and they are as ruthless as wolves in hunting their prey. But one day, Fuse, an ordinary member of the Forces, encounters an innocent Little Red Riding Hood-like girl clutching a backpack full of explosives. He survives the blast, but she does not. In the aftermath, Fuse goes on a soul-searching journey to discover why he didn't have it in him to shoot her first, all while poltical forces conspire to get rid of the Special Forces altogether.Jin-Roh is a deeply intelligent, mature animated film that seems to belong in a seperate category from most Japanese anime. The dystopian 1950s Japan depicted in the film is bleak, but believable. Oshii's reflective, meditative style serves him well this time, unlike in the pretentious Ghost in the Shell--by keeping the focus on the main character's self-discovery and on the theme of the effects of violence on the human soul, as well as the deft parallels to the original Little Red Riding Hood tale, the film achieves a kind of resonance and significance rare in anime. Sometimes the political relationships between the two different police forces are confusing, but the dramatic core of the story--the budding relationship between the suicide bomber's sister and Fuse--is strong, and is a vehicle for character exploration. Also, the memorable soundtrack by Hajime Mizoguchi (with a little help from Yoko Kanno) shines, accentuating some deeply powerful and unsettling scenes. The film may not be for everyone, as its pacing is deliberate and its politics are tangled. But for those with the patience to look under its surface, there is a rewarding amount of depth to discover. The Special Edition DVD, with a soundtrack CD and an extra disc included, is highly recommended for purchase.",5,"Excellent--reflective, dark, and well-composed",1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,2198,"['alternate', 'post-WWII', 'scenario', 'Japan', 'brink', 'social', 'chaos', 'occupation', 'failed', 'turn', 'Japan', 'stable', 'society', 'late', '1950s', 'Anti-government', 'protesters', 'terrorists', 'regularly', 'battle', 'authorities', 'setting', 'off', 'napalm', 'cocktails', 'bombs', 'combat', 'disorder', 'storm-trooperesque', 'division', 'police', 'Special', 'Forces', 'formed', 'force', 'decked', 'out', 'Nazi-style', 'helmets', 'glowing', 'red', 'infrared', 'eyeholes', 'are', 'as', 'ruthless', 'wolves', 'hunting', 'prey', 'one', 'day', 'Fuse', 'ordinary', 'member', 'Forces', 'encounters', 'innocent', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood-like', 'girl', 'clutching', 'backpack', 'full', 'explosives', 'blast', 'not', 'aftermath', 'Fuse', 'soul-searching', 'journey', 'discover', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'shoot', 'first', 'poltical', 'forces', 'conspire', 'get', 'rid', 'Special', 'Forces', 'altogether.Jin-Roh', 'deeply', 'intelligent', 'mature', 'animated', 'film', 'belong', 'seperate', 'category', 'most', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'dystopian', '1950s', 'Japan', 'depicted', 'film', 'bleak', 'believable', 'Oshii', 'reflective', 'meditative', 'style', 'well', 'time', 'pretentious', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'keeping', 'focus', 'main', 'character', 'self-discovery', 'theme', 'effects', 'violence', 'human', 'soul', 'as', 'well', 'deft', 'original', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'tale', 'film', 'kind', 'resonance', 'significance', 'rare', 'anime', 'political', 'relationships', 'two', 'different', 'police', 'forces', 'are', 'confusing', 'dramatic', 'core', 'story', 'budding', 'relationship', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'sister', 'Fuse', 'strong', 'vehicle', 'character', 'exploration', 'Also', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'Hajime', 'Mizoguchi', 'little', 'help', 'Yoko', 'Kanno', 'shines', 'accentuating', 'deeply', 'powerful', 'unsettling', 'scenes', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'pacing', 'deliberate', 'politics', 'are', 'tangled', 'patience', 'look', 'surface', 'rewarding', 'amount', 'depth', 'discover', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'extra', 'disc', 'included', 'highly', 'recommended', 'purchase']",N/A
686085,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00005UW7E,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 0]","I don't know what took me so long to finally pick Jin Roh up. I had heard so much about it over the past couple years, and very little that was said about it was bad. But I'm an admitted skeptic of real-life anime (Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers) since I believe if you're going to make anime look real, why not just make a live action movie? Thankfully, Tokyo Godfathers changed that for me, and I was willing to take a step towards purchasing Jin Roh.And I don't regret it at all. This is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Deeply plotted with some startlingly violent moments, Jin Roh is easily one of the smartest anime I've seen, and it doesn't have to get complicated in order to be so. It moves from point A to point B in a straightforward line, with only a few surprises along the way to make that line perhaps a little jagged. Jin Roh uses classic storytelling tools, such as symbolism (and there is a lot of that in here), foreshadowing, and metaphor to drive the plot along.The story of Jin Roh is set in an alternate history Japan, where social unrest has become the norm and constant rioting pollutes the streets. To combat the terrorists and keep control, the Japanese government has put together a group of elite soldiers--human tanks, really, creatures uncaring of who they kill, which is why they become known as ""Wolves""--to disband the justice and scare the populace into its place. Kazuki Fuse is one of these soldiers; only he becomes haunted by the death of a girl, who was also a terrorist, and finds himself constantly thinking about what went wrong. That's when he meets the girl's sister, and things really begin to change.I'm not really surprised by how much I loved this movie. Anything made by Mamoru Oshii, or anything he involves himself in, has found a good place on my list, starting with Ghost in the Shell. But, though I'm a little hesitant to admit this right now since I've only recently watched Jin Roh, I believe that Jin Roh is better than the cyberpunk classic, GitS. So, in other words, Jin Roh is an instant classic. If you liked Ghost in the Shell, Perfect Blue, or just enjoy richly plotted stories, then I highly recommend Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade to you.DVD Review: Being apart of the Anime Legends collection, Bandai has made the once $40 box set much more affordable, so that, in my book, makes this DVD instantly worth it. You get the movie, a supplemental material disc, and the CD movie soundtrack all in a thin collection. Though the special features aren't that great, and the CD soundtrack is only instrumentals, it is the truest form of this movie and at only $18 dollars it's difficult to avoid this, especially if you're a collector. I think it was a great buy for me, and if you're a budgeted collector of anime then I recommend this to you.",5,A Darker Little Red Riding Hood,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,2819,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'pick', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'up', 'had', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'very', 'little', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'bad', ""'m"", 'admitted', 'skeptic', 'real-life', 'anime', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'Tokyo', 'Godfathers', 'believe', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'anime', 'look', 'real', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'Thankfully', 'Tokyo', 'Godfathers', 'changed', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'step', 'purchasing', 'Jin', 'Roh.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'masterpiece', 'plain', 'simple', 'Deeply', 'plotted', 'startlingly', 'violent', 'moments', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'easily', 'one', 'smartest', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'complicated', 'order', 'be', 'so', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'straightforward', 'line', 'only', 'few', 'surprises', 'way', 'make', 'line', 'perhaps', 'little', 'jagged', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'classic', 'storytelling', 'tools', 'such', 'symbolism', 'lot', 'here', 'foreshadowing', 'metaphor', 'drive', 'plot', 'along.The', 'story', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'set', 'alternate', 'history', 'Japan', 'where', 'social', 'unrest', 'become', 'norm', 'constant', 'rioting', 'streets', 'combat', 'terrorists', 'keep', 'control', 'Japanese', 'government', 'put', 'together', 'group', 'elite', 'soldiers', 'human', 'tanks', 'really', 'creatures', 'uncaring', 'who', 'kill', 'why', 'become', 'known', 'Wolves', 'disband', 'justice', 'scare', 'populace', 'place', 'Kazuki', 'Fuse', 'one', 'soldiers', 'only', 'haunted', 'death', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'terrorist', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'when', 'girl', 'sister', 'things', 'really', 'begin', 'change.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'movie', 'Anything', 'made', 'Mamoru', 'Oshii', 'anything', 'found', 'good', 'place', 'list', 'starting', 'Ghost', 'Shell', ""'m"", 'little', 'hesitant', 'admit', 'right', 'now', ""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'watched', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'believe', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'better', 'cyberpunk', 'classic', 'GitS', 'So', 'other', 'words', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'instant', 'classic', 'liked', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'just', 'enjoy', 'richly', 'plotted', 'stories', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Jin', 'Roh', 'Wolf', 'Brigade', 'you.DVD', 'Review', 'Being', 'apart', 'Anime', 'Legends', 'collection', 'Bandai', 'made', 'once', '40', 'box', 'set', 'much', 'more', 'affordable', 'book', 'DVD', 'instantly', 'get', 'movie', 'supplemental', 'material', 'disc', 'CD', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'thin', 'collection', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'instrumentals', 'truest', 'form', 'movie', 'only', '18', 'dollars', 'difficult', 'avoid', 'especially', ""'re"", 'collector', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'buy', ""'re"", 'budgeted', 'collector', 'anime', 'then', 'recommend']",N/A
686086,A1AR8HYZ17T5H7,B00005UW7E,"""arxane""","[3, 3]","Anime is best known for its sci-fi and fantasy-themed works. With the power of animation, creators can craft stories that are almost impossible to recreate in real-life without some kind of sacrifice. But anime is also used to craft stories based in reality, stories that can also work in real-life but are more powerfully told in animation. Some of the best examples of such stories include the heartbreaking ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and the psychologically disturbing ""Perfect Blue"", and now the profound movie ""Jin-Roh"" joins their ranks.Contrary to what the front cover might indicate, ""Jin-Roh"" is not an action movie; it is actually a military drama. While there are scenes involving combat, the main focus of the movie is Constable Fuse and how he deals with the events around him. Set in an alternate history version of Tokyo, Fuse, a member of the Capital Police's Special Unit, is on a mission to eliminate members of an anti-government group known as the Sect. But when he fails to follow orders to shoot a young girl, who kills herself before his very eyes, he has to live with the emotional scars. And soon he is forced to face not only the girl's almost-identical sister but also an intricate plot involving the Special Unit, a plot of which he is unwittingly a part.Truthfully, ""Jin-Roh"" cannot be summed up in a single paragraph. The underlying plot is so intricate and complex that it may take several viewings for it to make sense entirely. But even so, the plot is so wonderfully crafted that the viewer really won't mind a repeat viewing. The underlying tensions that Fuse goes through are presented exquisitely, and the movie's close tie-in with the original ""Red Riding Hood"" story is a stroke of genius in storytelling. And while the movie is quite short for a drama, it never bogs down with needless exposition and seems to present exactly what is necessary, nothing more nothing less.Visually, ""Jin-Roh"" is a marvel. While it hardly can be said to possess visual flair, it still looks good enough to amaze. Everything is dark and moody, projecting the movie's atmosphere marvelously, and animation flows smoothly. Character designs are realistic and very well done; you won't find the typical big eyes and long hair of anime in this movie. ""Jin-Roh"" is most certainly a movie for those who demand quality eye candy.Audio-wise, both the English track and the Japanese track are in Dolby 5.1, and sub fans also have the added bonus of the Japanese track in DTS, so audiophiles need not complain here. The music is also a breathtaking accomplishment, creating rich atmospheres of sound to emphasize the movie's emotional strong points. As for the dub, the Oceans Group (""Gundam Wing"", ""Inu-Yasha"") have given ""Jin-Roh"" one of its best performances. With no melodrama or lag of any kind, all of the voice actors manage to get into their roles from the beginning and give solid performances. Anime fans that can't stand subtitles need not worry; ""Jin-Roh"" is an excellent example of how dubbing can be done well.Overall, ""Jin-Roh"" is an excellent movie for those wanting quality and deep storytelling in their anime set in a realistic backdrop. However, this movie is certainly not for everyone; those who don't like psychological drama need not apply here. But for everyone else, ""Jin-Roh"" just might be the anime movie you're looking for.",5,"A powerful, haunting, and teriffic anime movie.",1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,3360,"['Anime', 'best', 'known', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy-themed', 'works', 'power', 'animation', 'creators', 'can', 'craft', 'stories', 'are', 'almost', 'impossible', 'recreate', 'real-life', 'kind', 'sacrifice', 'anime', 'also', 'used', 'craft', 'stories', 'based', 'reality', 'stories', 'can', 'also', 'work', 'real-life', 'are', 'more', 'powerfully', 'told', 'animation', 'best', 'examples', 'such', 'stories', 'include', 'heartbreaking', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'psychologically', 'disturbing', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'now', 'profound', 'movie', 'Jin-Roh', 'ranks.Contrary', 'what', 'front', 'cover', 'might', 'indicate', 'Jin-Roh', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'actually', 'military', 'drama', 'are', 'scenes', 'involving', 'combat', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'Constable', 'Fuse', 'how', 'events', 'Set', 'alternate', 'history', 'version', 'Tokyo', 'Fuse', 'member', 'Capital', 'Police', 'Special', 'Unit', 'mission', 'eliminate', 'members', 'anti-government', 'group', 'known', 'Sect', 'when', 'follow', 'orders', 'shoot', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'very', 'eyes', 'live', 'emotional', 'scars', 'soon', 'forced', 'face', 'not', 'only', 'girl', 'almost-identical', 'sister', 'also', 'intricate', 'plot', 'involving', 'Special', 'Unit', 'plot', 'unwittingly', 'part.Truthfully', 'Jin-Roh', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'single', 'paragraph', 'underlying', 'plot', 'so', 'intricate', 'complex', 'may', 'take', 'several', 'viewings', 'make', 'sense', 'entirely', 'even', 'so', 'plot', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'viewer', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'underlying', 'tensions', 'Fuse', 'are', 'presented', 'exquisitely', 'movie', 'close', 'tie-in', 'original', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'story', 'stroke', 'genius', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'quite', 'short', 'drama', 'never', 'bogs', 'down', 'needless', 'exposition', 'present', 'exactly', 'what', 'necessary', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.Visually', 'Jin-Roh', 'marvel', 'hardly', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'possess', 'visual', 'flair', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'amaze', 'Everything', 'dark', 'moody', 'projecting', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'marvelously', 'animation', 'smoothly', 'Character', 'designs', 'are', 'realistic', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'typical', 'big', 'eyes', 'long', 'hair', 'anime', 'movie', 'Jin-Roh', 'most', 'certainly', 'movie', 'who', 'demand', 'quality', 'eye', 'candy.Audio-wise', 'English', 'track', 'Japanese', 'track', 'are', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sub', 'fans', 'also', 'have', 'added', 'bonus', 'Japanese', 'track', 'DTS', 'audiophiles', 'need', 'not', 'complain', 'here', 'music', 'also', 'breathtaking', 'accomplishment', 'creating', 'rich', 'atmospheres', 'sound', 'emphasize', 'movie', 'emotional', 'strong', 'points', 'dub', 'Oceans', 'Group', 'Gundam', 'Wing', 'Inu-Yasha', 'have', 'given', 'Jin-Roh', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'melodrama', 'lag', 'kind', 'voice', 'actors', 'manage', 'get', 'roles', 'beginning', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'Anime', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'subtitles', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'Jin-Roh', 'excellent', 'example', 'how', 'dubbing', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'well.Overall', 'Jin-Roh', 'excellent', 'movie', 'wanting', 'quality', 'deep', 'storytelling', 'anime', 'set', 'realistic', 'backdrop', 'However', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'psychological', 'drama', 'need', 'not', 'apply', 'here', 'everyone', 'else', 'Jin-Roh', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'anime', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking']",N/A

Set in an alternate history of Japan, Jin-Roh portrays a romance between a member of an elite Special Forces team, set in place to maintain peace in a time of civil unrest, and a Red Riding Hood, or bomb carrier who are caught up in politics and conspiracy. But it also asks an important question; can a ""beast"" or rather a wolf in man's clothing live among humans? Once a ""beast"" always a ""beast"".The second disc has a number of Japanese trailors and one English trailor and althought there are many Japanese trailors most seem to be the same. The second disc, or Extras Disc, also inlcudes interviews with the creator, director, character designer, and music composer. The interviews give you a good picture of what Jin-Roh is {hisory behind it and what the story is about}, as well as their own personal feelings about the movie. The second disc also includes fairly extensive weapon, character, and background sketch galleries for those who enjoy seeing those elements in their first stages before the color, detailing, and animation processes. Personally it's a nice add in.The third disc is the Jin-Roh Soundtrack. The music blends very well with the movie and is good by itself, especially the main theme, but is much better with the movie as most soundtrack music is. If you are a collector of anime music like I am you will enjoy this CD. If not but are a fan of music with action and/or drama and the romantic feel then you won't be disapointed. The music was composed by the same person who composed the music for Macross Plus and Escaflowne.",5,Beautiful Anime,1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,1910,"['beautiful', 'story', 'asthetically', 'pleasing', 'character', 'designs', 'art', 'Jin-Roh', 'Wolf', 'Brigade', 'tells', 'simple', 'terms', 'tale', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Jin-Roh', 'bit', 'more', 'complicated', 'Quoting', 'version', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'are', 'many', 'versions', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'movie', 'explore', 'human', 'nature', 'Set', 'alternate', 'history', 'Japan', 'Jin-Roh', 'romance', 'member', 'elite', 'Special', 'Forces', 'team', 'set', 'place', 'maintain', 'peace', 'time', 'civil', 'unrest', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'bomb', 'carrier', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'politics', 'conspiracy', 'also', 'important', 'question', 'can', 'beast', 'rather', 'wolf', 'man', 'clothing', 'live', 'humans', 'Once', 'beast', 'always', 'beast', '.The', 'second', 'disc', 'number', 'Japanese', 'trailors', 'one', 'English', 'trailor', 'althought', 'are', 'many', 'Japanese', 'trailors', 'most', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'second', 'disc', 'Extras', 'Disc', 'also', 'interviews', 'creator', 'director', 'character', 'designer', 'music', 'composer', 'interviews', 'give', 'good', 'picture', 'what', 'Jin-Roh', 'hisory', 'what', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'personal', 'feelings', 'movie', 'second', 'disc', 'also', 'fairly', 'extensive', 'weapon', 'character', 'background', 'sketch', 'galleries', 'who', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'elements', 'first', 'stages', 'color', 'detailing', 'animation', 'processes', 'Personally', 'nice', 'add', 'in.The', 'third', 'disc', 'Jin-Roh', 'Soundtrack', 'music', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'good', 'especially', 'main', 'theme', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'most', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'are', 'collector', 'anime', 'music', 'am', 'will', 'enjoy', 'CD', 'not', 'are', 'fan', 'music', 'action', 'and/or', 'drama', 'romantic', 'feel', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disapointed', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'composed', 'music', 'Macross', 'Plus', 'Escaflowne']",N/A

Jason (directly below)- case in point: he's given two good reviews and i've seen him review some cracker products.This is not a typical animation. The director of Ghost in the Shell wrote this script and i must say i'm impressed. This is story based first and foremost, but the story is interesting, compelling and down-right amazing. Having won several awards i looked it up and was suprised to see an animation with such a well thought out story. Its a drama and a political masterpiece. But you aren't at a loss to understand the manuovers. Rather than take on the intrigue of the higher powers in the game, it looks at the pawns, those being manipulated and fighting back. It was one of the few films i've ever seen where i was actually surprised to find out that: this person was working here, this person was with the others on the sly etc. etc., but don't worry what i've said won't wreck the experience. Not by a long-shot.At the end i was even wondering: Why? How could that happen?

For the most part Anime distribution in Japan is monopolistic to Bandai Visual / Emotion.  So when I pleasingly saw the Bandai/Emotion symbol on the cover, I figured the quality of the DVD to be similar to other region 2 dvds they carry.  It was just a video transfer.  The only other DVD I have purchased that is similar in quality would be the Macross Plus Movie Edition.

686100,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005UW7E,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 6]","""JIN-ROH: The Wolf Brigade"" is definitely one of those films that keeps your attention as you keep up with who is telling the truth, who is lying and thus twists and turns are set along the way.  A modern day storyline of alternate Japan (takes place in the 1950's and the Germans were the one's that beat the Japanese) and based on the manga series by Mamoru Oshii, this modern day ""Little Red Riding Hood"" storyline is a tragic film but looks great on Blu-ray!  Also, fans of the film will enjoy with the extras that the Blu-ray box set comes with.VIDEO:The video for this anime film is presented in 16:9 1080p Hi-Def. One must remember that this film was created in 1999, because it was in development for three years, it was created via traditional cel animation and not via digital that many people are familiar with these days.But for anime fans, you look at what the art director and their staff had to pull of to make this story come alive.  That involves creating an alternate Japan, awesome visuals that when you see the backdrops and just the amount of detail in each painting, it's quite stunning to look at.  Also, because this film's setting takes place in the 1950's, you get a little aged look and thus you don't get eye popping colors, there is a slight haze to the film.On Blu-ray and at 1080p, the Blu-ray manages to keep that beauty intact for a film of its age but for those not familiar with older anime films, especialy if one views the eye popping, vibrant colors of animated films today, some may have trouble with it.  This film is artistically beautiful when it comes to the details but not vibrant with sharp and bright colors coming at you.In an interview with the director/animator Hiroyuki Okiura, Okiura says that filters were used during the photography to create a certain sense of space.  He also goes on to say that the HD version of the film is closer to the original film than the DVD ever was and even had requests for the engineers to make happen on the Blu-ray version.  Details that were hard to see during the dark in the DVD can now be seen in the Blu-ray version.AUDIO:I watched the film both in Japanese and English.  The Japanese is featured in Linear PCM 5.1ch and Linear PCM Dolby Surround.  The English track is in Dolby Digital 5.1ch.  During the action segments especially the machine gun rattling, your surround system really comes alive.  In fact, I kept repeating the gun shots just to hear it over and enjoy the clarity of that sound.  Both are well-acted in Japanese and English dub.In the interview with the director Okiura (in a booklet that comes with the Blu-ray box set), Okiura talks about how they wanted to use the 5.1ch surround to showcase certain sounds like leaves rustling when one steps on them.SPECIAL FEATURES:As for special features on disc, you can choose from subtitled or non-subtitled trailers (four total).  So, really, there aren't any major special features but in this box set, there is something that will be of satisfaction to ""JIN-ROH"" fans.Included in this Blu-ray box set is a 524-page storyboard booklet.  This has the complete storyboards and of the many anime I do own, outside of the recent Studio 4C ""Amazing Nuts"" DVD special edition which came with an awesome booklet, ""JIN-ROH: The Wolf Brigade"" was simply a great addition for the fans of the film.And that's not it, you also get a 20-page booklet which includes a writeup on ""JIN-ROH"", a booklet featuring a comparison of storyboards and the actual animation but also an interview with the director Hiroyuki Okiura.  In the writeup, Chikashi Saito actually makes some clarifications as many call ""JIN-ROH"" the final analog film.  But we learn that although the film was constructed via analog there are a few scenes that do employ some CG work and the digital editing system Avid was used for post-production work.But the best part of the booklet is the interview with Okiura who talks about the actual colors of the film, the use of sound and also why he made some changes from Oishii's screenplay on his animated version and more.  Overall, a pretty cool interview to read.I have to admit that I really enjoyed watching ""JIN-ROH: The Wolf Brigade"" on Blu-ray.  One thing that I have noticed in animations is that with Blu-ray, things that are in the dark, you are able to see much more detail in the darkness and even the director noted that in his interview.Also, I have to give Bandai Entertainment/Bandai Visual credit for bringing quite a number of their older films on Blu-ray and ""JIN-ROH: The Wolf's Brigade"" is definitely a classic that received awesome treatement in this release.It's one thing to have the release (in Japanese and English) and watch it in 1080p but with ""JIN-ROH"", like ""ROYAL SPACE FORCE"", there is so much detail in the overall artwork that just simply looks stunning on Blu-ray.  Granted, this is not a film that spotlights vibrant colors but it's a film that looked beautiful then and it look beautiful now.  The artistic detail in this film is spectacular and in balance with a film with a unique storyline, you can only hope that there is another animated film that takes place in Oishii's ""Kerberos Saga"" and you can only think what upcoming film will be coming from director Okiura next.I do wish there were more special features included on the Blu-ray disc but Bandai made up for that with the inclusion of the thick storyboard booklet and the addition of the 20-page booklet with an interview with Okiura.If you enjoyed this film, are a fan of the ""Kerberos Saga"" manga series or fans of Okiura or Oishii's work, this Blu-ray release of ""JIN-ROH: The Wolf Brigade"" would make awesome addition to your anime Blu-ray collection.",5,"Visually stunning, detailed artwork, better on Blu-ray

Anime fans often debate which films are the classics of the genre, but I sense most would love to see another film of the quality of Akira, Ninja Scroll, or Ghost in the Shell. I wanted &quot;Jin Roh: The Wolf Brigade&quot; to be that film, and while it certainly doesn't fall on its face, it didn't strike me as a classic.The production values are not at fault. The animation is top-notch, with a dark, muted look that fit with the mood of the film and reminded me of Ghost in the Shell. The soundtrack, by noted composer Hajime Mizuguchi (Escaflowne), is wonderful. The sound mix on the DVD (I think it was a Region 2 DVD) was strong, especially in scenes where the Wolf Brigade soldiers fire their panzer guns in the tunnels below the city.What left me cold was the story, which like many anime plotlines, is highly complex. That in itself is not so bad, as most American cartoons are too simplistic for adults, but Jin Roh's story, a romance/political thriller/drama set in the future, is too complex to be emotionally powerful. The story seeks to use the fairy tale of Red Riding Hood to comment on the hidden depths of human nature, but I would have preferred a more coherent story with less military and political intrigue.

Never underestimate the power of the eternal return of the same, or somesuch...Anyway. I was lucky enough not to have been exposed to anime at all before i saw this movie, and as an introductory foray into japanese anime it was really quite grand. If the tropes seem familiar to you, and you've seen a bajillizion japanese series and movies your mileage may vary, but for someone not accultured to such an expression it was indeed quite powerful.The setting is light-futuristic, and the reason for all the social turmoil is never explained. This works quite well, as you are left wondering, and working with the art style for clues instead of the statements of the characters. On the whole the society has a neo-germanic japanese feel. (How novel! Right? Back to my point about having this as an introduction to the entire anime-scene.) It is brooding and industrial, and it works perfectly for me.The story deals with the best soldier in a special anti-""terror"" brigade and the repercussions of him seeing a girl blowing herself up right in front of him. This leads him on a circuitous route through conspiracies within the anti-terror unit itself and to an inevitable showdown i won't spoil here.For me, this movie is pretty much perfect, but i watched it at an impressionable age w/o any previous exposure to the many tropes within. The art is beautiful. The scenes are slow but meaningful. Action sequences are generally short, and if prolonged they are for a reason, not to stall time.

Most of the crews also in this film worked with Mamoru in GitS, and other animations.  The director himself was the character designer for GitS, and did some key animations.

The design of the weapons and its mechas are just amazing, and the character development is fabulous.  I've seen this film several times, and it just works in a very different way from the typical animes- it works more in a film-esqu manner, and not surprisingly, Mamoru recently directed a live-action film called Avalon.  To people who saw Ghost, and liked it, this film with definitely appeal to you as well.The reason it is four stars, instead of five, is the slow pacing of the film, which can lose its audience at some point.  I've seen some of my friends lose the film after 30-40 minutes into it.

With his ""Patlabor"" TV series, he has a strong emphasis on entertainment with shades of mature themes.  In his ""Patlabor"" movies, he switches to a much more intellectually mature film with shades of ""pure entertainment"".  In his live action, ""Avalon"" he goes into a more ""art film"" focused mode with a disregard of entertainment.  So what did he do with ""Jin Roh""?  With ""Jin Roh"", he covers many profound intellectual themes while retaining a strong narrative that is both entertaining and engaging.  This is not a kid's show...I can't stress that enough.FOR THOSE CONCERNED...There isn't much issue with the language.  Also, fanservice is non-existent.  The director is taking a much more realistic approach to his animation.  That said, the violence can be quite vicious...nothing over the top...but still very vicious and bloody at times.MOVING ALONG...Plot (absolutely no plot spoilers):What makes this particular film brilliant is that it is a dark and masterful re-adaptation of our familiar fairy tale, ""Little Red Riding Hood"" (the Perrault version if I remember correctly).  From start to finish it uses this tale to expound on many serious and mature themes about reality, right/wrong, etc.  One of it's interesting questions about the ""Wolf"" inside.  It's very amazing how he both embellishes while stays true to the tale.Graphics:They are definitely marked by the era it was produced (the '90s I believe), but still beautiful and detailed.  The animators approached this project with a sense of realism that is rarely seen in most of todays commercial/popular anime.  No exaggerations, no embellishments...just normal life.  Strict realism.  In fact, there are a lot of messages that even the visual gives to add more depth to the story.  Very good stuff...and totally fits the mood.Extras:Doesn't exist hahaSUB vs DUBS:Rarely do i dislike dubs.  But this is one of the few instances I have to say that the Subtitles are a little stronger.ALL IN ALL...This was a good purchase.  It's not one that I would pull out often, but the retelling of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and how Oshii uses it to raise questions and issues is astounding.  It can be quite an emotional trip as well.  It is very dark, and very sad at points.  The film raises  some good (though not new) questions for one to ponder.  However, this is not a passive, popcorn/friday-night movie.  It is one that needs attentiveness and intent because there are many messages and allusions in both the dialogue and the visual portrayals.  No time is really wasted.

686115,A3VDC23HUFETP5,B00005UW7E,Jeremy Moses,"[0, 0]","There's so much to be said for this film that it's hard to know where to start. A political and human drama that has the feel of an historical epic, Jin Roh pushes the standards for artistic anime in almost every way.To start, the artwork. Even those who dislike Jin Roh praise its animation. The world it portrays is dark and dreary, effectively setting the tone for the movie. The character designs are by far the most realistic I've ever seen, and that only enhances the historical feel that Jin Roh conveys. While this is not an action-oriented film, the scenes of violence and killing are particularly beautiful and disturbing.In terms of plot, Jin Roh excels the most. The plot is not complex at first, but it soon completely engulfs the charaters in its oppressively dark situations, and the viewer along with them. The two leads, Kazuki Fuse and Kei are good characters if not great ones, but for most of the film it's the machinations of those higher up that seem to define them.On a different note, much has been said, good and bad, about the use of Little Red Riding Hood as a narration (actually, a much more macabre version of the story than I've ever heard before). It might seem silly, but it's really not. It drives home a lot of the key themes in the movie without being at all intrusive. And then again, it helps define the dark feel of the movie.At this point, it's hard to say much more. If you like artistic and dramatic anime, then it seems hard to go wrong here. A lot of people have commented on Akira and Ghost in the Shell in relation to this movie, and for the record, I disliked both films. Jin Roh isn't really like those in terms of pacing or action, so if you're a fan of robots and really big explosions you should stay away.

If all anime was drawn this well I would be in heaven, for instance. In the beginning there is a riot scene and in this scene there may be 20 people all of which are moving independently. One individual may running forward another is throwing and another may be running back and someone may be picking something up off the ground. This is the level of animation from start to finish. Even though it has an older feel it is such a high quality it would fit right in at an American theater.As for the story itself it is believable. There are no monsters, no witches & no demons except those we have inside. All characters are drawn to scale and there is no one with blue hair or purple eyes no funny sounds when they blink their eyes. They are all dark hair and dark eyes and oriental.As I stated this is a believable story. It centers around a military man in the ""Special Unit"".  He sees something that truly bothers him while he is battling Terrorists and the story unfolds from there.This is more of a drama slash espionage tale than it is action.

Green,"[3, 3]","The Wolf Brigade is a name for the special unit within the Capital Police Deparment; this unit is suppose to help the government combat terrorist groups or any other rebel organizations such as the Red Riding Hood group. Kazuki Fuse is one of the officers in this group whose life is about to change. The Man vs. Beast battle is about to take on a fatalistic meaning.Kazuki Fuse is a Capital Police Constable who finds himself face to face with any officer's worst nightmare: killing a seemingly harmless child. There are little kids wondering around blowing up buildings and committing mass terrorism. These kids are called &quot;Red Riding Hoods&quot;. Red Riding Hoods are little girls used to overthrow the current government. Fuse gets caught in the midst of the battle. After having to kill one of the Red Riding Hoods, he becomes consumed by thoughts of the little girl's face as he shot her. He tells himself that he did the right thing but he continues to obsess about the incident. The main question in his mind is why she wouldn't surrender? Why would she choose to die?He meets Kei (who turns out to be the sister of the girl he killed). Fuse and Kei become close; wandering the city, visiting the most obscure places that wreak of melancholy. Melancholy and sacred silences are the dynamics in Fuse and Kei's relationship; They seem to need each other in order to be able to go on day to day.Fuse (chronically silent at times)has so many things he'd like to say but can't get out; Kei (bizarrely optimistic)talks about too much and gets hurt in the end due to her openness. As far as whether Fuse is apart of a secret cabal group w/n the Capital Police well you'll have to watch the movie to find out for sure. In the end, Fuse has to make a choice between being a man or a wolf. It's an old battle man vs. beast except this time the beast is inside of the man.The story of Little Red Riding Hood gets a twist to chill even macabre fans. Does the wolf win? Will Little Red Riding Hood transform the wolf? Or is Red Riding Hood the villain who must be taken down? Fuse must decide if he will end the story like the fairytale that kids are told or finish the story the way it really would have ended? If you don't know what I'm talking about? Watch this movie!

686139,A65M76UVJYRK3,B00005UW7E,sean,"[4, 5]","Last week My DVD copy of ""Jin-Roh"" finally arrived.  I haven't been this blown away with an anime since i finished ""Escaflowne.""I don't know if i can really classify this as an Anime. I actually have it shelved in my films section of dvds.  ""Jin-roh"" takes place in a fictitious post world war II japan, somewhere in the 1950's.  Consistant cival revolts have prompted the govt. to organize a specialized mobile police that fiercly resembles the S.S. & Panzers of Nazi Germany.  This is deliberatly done so much to point that all the weapons (excessivly degailed), helmuts, and much of their gear is very much nazi army.Our main character, ""Fuse"" (foo-say) is a member of the Special Division of the moblile police, which has recently come under controversy due to a break of discibline in the ranks when Fuse is confronted by a young girl in a red hood, carrying a bomb for her terrorist group.Jin-roh has an excellent set of characters, and is exceptionally well directed and informative for a feature length film.  Jin-roh really plays an obvious parallel to the childrens' story, ""Little Red Riding Hood.""  They use the German title, ""Rotkappchen,"" which litterally translates to Red little hood.The first thing you will notice while watching Jin-Roh is how unlike it is to any anime.  The characters are drawn to look VERY japanese.  No big eyes and clown smiles; The characters in Jin-Roh have black hair, fair skin, and small eyes.  Produced by the same team that put together ""Akira,"" and ""Ghost in the shell,"" (neither of which i am a tremendous fan of)' ""Jin-Roh"" is Exceptionally detailed, from the characters... but especially the backgrounds.  So vidid with detail, but not necessarily bright colors.  Jin-Roh isn't a standard Anime filled with humor.  In fact, I can't remember laughing one time during my first or second viewing of this film.This film is so clever; it has an ending and a twist that would remind you of an american film like ""Memento,"" ""Unbreakable,"" ...""Fight club"" even.Upon watching the movie a second time, i found myself immediatly recognizing things at the beggining of the film that allude to circumstances revealed later.""Jin-roh"" is not for the sensitive viewer.  This is a very violent film; however, this is not an action based movie.

686141,AJ6XR403WY88M,B00005UW7E,"Sniff Code ""www.sniffcode.com""","[0, 2]","As is customary of Mamoru Oshii, Jin-Roh, which Oshii penned, offers a complex narrative that may require multiple viewings in order to fully get your mind around its plot. As far as I'm concerned, a movie that rewards my hard earned pesos with multiple viewings is a good thing. Provided the movie itself is a good thing.Jin-Roh starts at the beginning of United States occupation of Japan, right after the bomb was dropped. True to the surrender terms signed by Japan, the Self-Defense Force is limited in how it can exert its military authority. Consequently, Japan has little control over its increasingly hostile citizenry that has found itself on the low-end of Japan's economic social ladder. Here is where Jin-Roh detours into an alternate history. Oshii creates a fictional ""capital police organization"" which Japan has mobilized to keep order over a new class of underground rebels.This is all a backdrop to a slow evolving forbidden romance that develops between a member of the Capital Police, named Fuse and a young girl, Kei, who assists the underground rebels by transporting bombs carried in discreet satchels.Hiroyuki Okiura, who in the past has worked as Oshii's chief character designer and animator, now takes up the task as Director of Oshii's script. Whatever Okiura learned from Oshii has paid off with Jin-Roh. While you can certainly see some of Oshii's influence -- especially in how the Red Riding Hood metaphor is employed -- you can definitely see how Okiura has brought some of his own sense of forward movement to Jin-Roh.  Oshii's movies are generally even paced, which is a polite way of saying they are usually slow. Okiura puts a little more urgency in this movie, which is a glorified way of seeing that he adds a wee-bit more action just to make sure we don't doze off before the climatic ending.Okiura also introduces the forbidden kiss between Fuse and Kei. Until The Sky Crawlers,  Oshii usually dodges overt romantic themes in his movies. Any affection in his stories are often implied and remain unspoken between two love interests. Okiura on the other hand knows that some kind of emotional contract must be signed by his main characters in order for a probable breach of contract to mean anything at all to the audience.That decision alone might be what makes Jin-Roh such a compelling animation. It's a political-action-romance-drama all rolled up in one. And while the politics of the movie aren't always clear, the action is spellbinding and the romance is dramatically heart breaking.",4,An Animated Alternate Past and Present Japan,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,2532,"['customary', 'Mamoru', 'Oshii', 'Jin-Roh', 'Oshii', 'penned', 'complex', 'narrative', 'may', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'order', 'fully', 'get', 'mind', 'plot', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'movie', 'rewards', 'hard', 'earned', 'pesos', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'good', 'thing', 'Provided', 'movie', 'good', 'thing.Jin-Roh', 'starts', 'beginning', 'United', 'States', 'occupation', 'Japan', 'right', 'bomb', 'was', 'dropped', 'True', 'surrender', 'terms', 'signed', 'Japan', 'Self-Defense', 'Force', 'limited', 'how', 'can', 'exert', 'military', 'authority', 'Consequently', 'Japan', 'little', 'control', 'over', 'increasingly', 'hostile', 'citizenry', 'found', 'low-end', 'Japan', 'economic', 'social', 'ladder', 'Here', 'where', 'Jin-Roh', 'detours', 'alternate', 'history', 'Oshii', 'fictional', 'capital', 'police', 'organization', 'Japan', 'mobilized', 'keep', 'order', 'new', 'class', 'underground', 'rebels.This', 'backdrop', 'slow', 'evolving', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'member', 'Capital', 'Police', 'named', 'Fuse', 'young', 'girl', 'Kei', 'who', 'underground', 'rebels', 'transporting', 'bombs', 'carried', 'discreet', 'satchels.Hiroyuki', 'Okiura', 'who', 'past', 'worked', 'Oshii', 'chief', 'character', 'designer', 'animator', 'now', 'up', 'task', 'Director', 'Oshii', 'script', 'Okiura', 'learned', 'Oshii', 'paid', 'off', 'Jin-Roh', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'Oshii', 'influence', 'especially', 'how', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'metaphor', 'employed', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'how', 'Okiura', 'brought', 'own', 'sense', 'forward', 'movement', 'Jin-Roh', 'Oshii', 'movies', 'are', 'generally', 'even', 'paced', 'polite', 'way', 'saying', 'are', 'usually', 'slow', 'Okiura', 'little', 'more', 'urgency', 'movie', 'glorified', 'way', 'seeing', 'wee-bit', 'more', 'action', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'doze', 'off', 'climatic', 'ending.Okiura', 'also', 'forbidden', 'kiss', 'Fuse', 'Kei', 'Sky', 'Crawlers', 'Oshii', 'usually', 'overt', 'romantic', 'themes', 'movies', 'affection', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'implied', 'remain', 'unspoken', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'Okiura', 'other', 'hand', 'kind', 'emotional', 'contract', 'must', 'be', 'signed', 'main', 'characters', 'order', 'probable', 'breach', 'contract', 'mean', 'anything', 'decision', 'alone', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'Jin-Roh', 'such', 'compelling', 'animation', 'political-action-romance-drama', 'rolled', 'up', 'one', 'politics', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'clear', 'action', 'spellbinding', 'romance', 'dramatically', 'heart', 'breaking']",N/A
686142,A2Y1D9287MGNQ4,B00005UW7E,Steven Myers,"[4, 13]","Let me set my biases out first: I'm an animation fan, not a movie buff.  I like story, plot, and characters as much as anyone else, but if I'm buying an animated movie, I want it to make use of its medium.  Jin-Roh, while it succeeds as a movie, fails as animation.The basic point here is that all of this could just as easily have been done with live actors and sets.  It's a character-driven drama, about the choices (and lack of choices) facing people in a decaying society.  The characters are realistic, the setting familiar and urban.  The armor used by the Capital Police--the elite troopers at the heart of the story--is nothing which could not have been better in a dozen U.S. science fiction movies.  Watching this, I wanted to scream, Why is this animated?  The only answer is this: Japan's live action movie industry is almost pathetically small by U.S. standards.  I want to compare Jin-Roh to Wings of Honneamise, which is another anime movie which could have been live action.  But WoH was a powerfully re-imagined world, which would have been constrained had it been created with sets; Jin-Roh has no visual imagination or sense of wonder to it.But what if you're not like me, and just want a good movie?  Jin-Roh may succeed for you.  I found it difficult to generate much sympathy for the characters, as the plot is driven by politicking (this may be a trend: Gasaraki and Patlabor, as just two examples, fell prey to this also).  The political machinations of almost faceless characters is not compelling to me.  Once the story starts in motion, with Fuse, the main character forced to act, it becomes more interesting.  The ending, without spoiling anything, has a sharp emotional impact.In the end, Jin-Roh is a depressing movie which conveys a sense of hopelessness and futility, and the inability of men to escape their hunger for power.  I simply wish it had the visual imagination to make use of the inherent freedom of animation.  This is a live action movie forced into animation because of the economics in Japan.",3,"Powerful, depressing movie, but has no reason to be animated",1036108800,"11 1, 2002",2002,2041,"['Let', 'set', 'biases', 'out', 'first', ""'m"", 'animation', 'fan', 'not', 'movie', 'buff', 'story', 'plot', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', ""'m"", 'buying', 'animated', 'movie', 'want', 'make', 'use', 'medium', 'Jin-Roh', 'movie', 'animation.The', 'basic', 'point', 'here', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'live', 'actors', 'sets', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'choices', 'lack', 'choices', 'facing', 'people', 'decaying', 'society', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'setting', 'familiar', 'urban', 'armor', 'used', 'Capital', 'Police', 'elite', 'troopers', 'heart', 'story', 'nothing', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'dozen', 'U.S.', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'Watching', 'wanted', 'scream', 'Why', 'animated', 'only', 'answer', 'Japan', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'industry', 'almost', 'pathetically', 'small', 'U.S.', 'standards', 'want', 'compare', 'Jin-Roh', 'Wings', 'Honneamise', 'anime', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'live', 'action', 'WoH', 'was', 'powerfully', 're-imagined', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'constrained', 'had', 'been', 'created', 'sets', 'Jin-Roh', 'visual', 'imagination', 'sense', 'wonder', 'it.But', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'movie', 'Jin-Roh', 'may', 'succeed', 'found', 'difficult', 'generate', 'much', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'plot', 'driven', 'politicking', 'may', 'be', 'trend', 'Gasaraki', 'Patlabor', 'just', 'two', 'examples', 'fell', 'prey', 'also', 'political', 'machinations', 'almost', 'faceless', 'characters', 'not', 'compelling', 'story', 'motion', 'Fuse', 'main', 'character', 'forced', 'act', 'more', 'interesting', 'ending', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'sharp', 'emotional', 'impact.In', 'end', 'Jin-Roh', 'depressing', 'movie', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'futility', 'inability', 'men', 'escape', 'hunger', 'power', 'simply', 'wish', 'had', 'visual', 'imagination', 'make', 'use', 'inherent', 'freedom', 'animation', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'forced', 'animation', 'economics', 'Japan']",N/A
