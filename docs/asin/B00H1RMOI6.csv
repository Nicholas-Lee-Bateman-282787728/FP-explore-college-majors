That being said, while they do a fair amount of fighting, nothing like we are used to, the blow ups are a minimum since this is more technical. He is a security expert that gets himself thrown in the most notorious and unbreakable prisons and finds a way out. He is a thinker, he observes and does more than report. He exposes the weakness in the system and he gets paid very well for it. When he is approached to try his Houdini act on the worlds more impenetrable prison he takes the job knowing his friends are always there in case something goes wrong. Soon he finds his identity erased and all trails leading to him are gone. Getting out now is paramount and a matter of life and death, literally. Arnold already an inmate decides to befriend him. Together they attempt the impossible. It does get tense and there are prison fights, no surprise there, but once he figures a way out, he discovers just how hopeless the situation he is in. The last 45 minutes or so are a fight to get away and somehow get help before they discover who Arnold really is and why it is so important to keep Sly in. Things explode in the end and Arnold gets his signature big gun so all things are not lost. This is a different role for both actors and one I found I actually liked. but it could have used a few more booms just because it's Sly and Arnold.

1683024,A3VTCXVTDXUFZ2,B00H1RMOI6,Andrew,"[0, 0]","Action movie buffs rejoice: Escape Plan features the long-awaited onscreen pairing of iconic 1980s muscle men Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. While these two action legends teamed up briefly in The Expendables franchise, Escape Plan is the first time they have done so in starring roles. The result? A satisfying B-movie that delivers just enough to compensate for some gaping plot holes and corny dialogue.For decades action movie junkies dreamed of these two titans sharing the screen. Escape Plan is admittedly a bit of an odd choice for Stallone and Schwarzenegger&#8217;s much-anticipated collaboration. Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom concentrates on building the suspense and only towards the end does the movie unleash the bullets, blood and mayhem that are the hallmarks of a Stallone or Schwarzenegger picture.Fortunately, Escape Plan doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously. A quick glance at the movie&#8217;s synopsis confirms that this will not be another Shawshank Redemption. Stallone plays Ray Breslin, a structural security expert who literally wrote the book on designing escape-proof prisons. He earns his trade by intentionally getting locked up in prisons and subsequently devising clever ways to escape, thus exposing the design flaws to prison authorities. His latest assignment involves breaking out of &#8220;The Tomb&#8221;, a top secret, state-of-the-art prison that houses the world&#8217;s most dangerous criminals. Soon he realizes he&#8217;s been double-crossed and thrown into a seemingly escape-proof prison run by a twisted warden (Jim Caviezel) with an axe to grind. Breslin&#8217;s only hope is to join forces with an enigmatic fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and turn the tables on the warden and his sadistic prison guards.If you can buy Stallone as a high-security mastermind (&#8220;you don&#8217;t look that smart&#8221;, Schwarzenegger quips) then you should be able to overlook the film&#8217;s obvious plot holes and cardboard characters. The two leads may be getting up there in age, but they have lost none of the charm or screen presence that made them famous. Stallone plays it straight, but Schwarzenegger is the scene-stealer here, delivering a live-wire performance as Rottmayer. Schwarzenegger looks like he&#8217;s having the time of his life while ranting in his native German or mowing down bad guys with a huge machine gun. His enthusiasm carries the movie through to its predictably over-the-top finale.At the end of the day, Escape Plan falls somewhere in the middle of Stallone and Schwarzenegger&#8217;s cinematic oeuvre. It doesn&#8217;t reach the highs of Rocky or The Terminator, but it also doesn&#8217;t stoop to the lows of Judge Dredd or Batman & Robin. Despite a weak script and cheesy one-liners, Stallone and Schwarzenegger manage to carry it through to the finish line. It mostly aims to be good, dumb fun, and on that basis, it succeeds.",4,Sly and Arnie deliver solid escapist fun,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,2939,"['Action', 'movie', 'buffs', 'rejoice', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'long-awaited', 'onscreen', 'pairing', 'iconic', '1980s', 'muscle', 'men', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'two', 'action', 'legends', 'teamed', 'up', 'briefly', 'Expendables', 'franchise', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'starring', 'roles', 'result', 'satisfying', 'B-movie', 'just', 'enough', 'compensate', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'corny', 'dialogue.For', 'decades', 'action', 'movie', 'junkies', 'dreamed', 'two', 'titans', 'sharing', 'screen', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'admittedly', 'bit', 'odd', 'choice', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', '8217', 'much-anticipated', 'collaboration', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Mikael', 'Hafstrom', 'building', 'suspense', 'only', 'end', 'movie', 'bullets', 'blood', 'mayhem', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'picture.Fortunately', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'quick', 'glance', 'movie', '8217', 'synopsis', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Stallone', 'Ray', 'Breslin', 'structural', 'security', 'expert', 'who', 'literally', 'wrote', 'book', 'designing', 'escape-proof', 'prisons', 'trade', 'intentionally', 'getting', 'locked', 'up', 'prisons', 'subsequently', 'devising', 'clever', 'ways', 'escape', 'thus', 'exposing', 'design', 'prison', 'authorities', 'latest', 'assignment', 'breaking', '8220', 'Tomb', '8221', 'top', 'secret', 'state-of-the-art', 'prison', 'houses', 'world', '8217', 'most', 'dangerous', 'criminals', 'Soon', '8217', 'been', 'double-crossed', 'thrown', 'seemingly', 'escape-proof', 'prison', 'run', 'twisted', 'warden', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'axe', 'grind', 'Breslin', '8217', 'only', 'hope', 'join', 'forces', 'enigmatic', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'Emil', 'Rottmayer', 'Schwarzenegger', 'turn', 'tables', 'warden', 'sadistic', 'prison', 'guards.If', 'can', 'buy', 'Stallone', 'high-security', 'mastermind', '8220', 'don', '8217', 'look', 'smart', '8221', 'Schwarzenegger', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'overlook', 'film', '8217', 'obvious', 'plot', 'holes', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'two', 'leads', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'up', 'there', 'age', 'have', 'lost', 'none', 'charm', 'screen', 'presence', 'made', 'famous', 'Stallone', 'straight', 'Schwarzenegger', 'scene-stealer', 'here', 'delivering', 'live-wire', 'performance', 'Rottmayer', 'Schwarzenegger', '8217', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'ranting', 'native', 'German', 'mowing', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'huge', 'machine', 'gun', 'enthusiasm', 'movie', 'predictably', 'over-the-top', 'finale.At', 'end', 'day', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', '8217', 'cinematic', 'oeuvre', '8217', 'reach', 'highs', 'Rocky', 'Terminator', 'also', 'doesn', '8217', 'stoop', 'lows', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'weak', 'script', 'cheesy', 'one-liners', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'manage', 'carry', 'finish', 'line', 'mostly', 'be', 'good', 'dumb', 'fun', 'basis']",N/A

It is something to see, although the ultra modern prison is ugly and is the biggest turn-off.The picture is perfect - it was clearly film in digital, so what do you expect?  It is hard watching Stallone as a senior with every vein in his body showing and Popeye forearms, yet he has the walk and body of Fred Sanford!  Arnold is much, much smaller muscle wise than in his younger days, so you know he was on the juice.  Stallone looks stronger and slightly bigger than Arnold does, and he has already been caught on the stuff a few years ago.Stallone has to come to terms with the fact that he is an old man.

The premise doesn't really hold water when you consider why anyone would  build a high tech detention facility to house the most undesirable of the undesirables when it would be much cheaper to dispatch said persons in other ways.  Granted, you wouldn't have a movie so why quibble.  Natch, our heroes have been set up by nefarious organizations so we have a real rooting interest for the bad guys getting their just desserts and Arnie and Sly are pros in that department.  What I like about this movie is it gets by on the charisma and machismo of its stars instead of CGI.  These guys are sculpted like men half their age.  Jim Caviezel looks like an American Ralph Fiennes in an oily turn as the sadistic warden.  Vinnie Jones, missing in action since his auspicious debut in ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", has a menacing bit as a fearsome guard.  Fifty Cent plays Fifty Cent.

It's a fun ride fueled by enough testosterone to power a bulldozer and knows its target audience: men. Although it didn't fare well in the U.S. at the box office, Summit Entertainment gives audiences another chance to see the film at home on Blu-ray, DVD, or Digital Download.Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) spends his life breaking out of maximum security prisons. When he's asked to find a way to escape from a super-prison, he can't resist the challenge. After being locked up, Ray realizes he's been set up. His only chance of escape is with the help of a convict (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who wants out as bad as Breslin does.&#34;Escape Plan&#34; is presented in 1080p High-Definition (2.40:1). Its transfer will please home viewers with a clear picture. Most of the settings in the movie are dark and ominous, but don't lose any clarity.A 7.1 DTS-HD Audio 7.1 Surround Sound mix is provided for &#34;Escape Plan.&#34; It's a perfect way to plunge audiences into the ominously claustrophobic world the film is set in. Every door buzz, explosion, gunshot, and rush of water is systematically placed and comes out at you from every direction.The Blu-ray version of &#34;Escape Plan&#34; comes with some interesting bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Mikael Hafstrom and Co-Writer Miles Chapman. Featurettes for the release include &#34;Executing the Plan: The Making of 'Escape Plan,'&#34; &#34;Maximum Security: The Real-Life Tomb,&#34; and &#34;Clash of the Titans.&#34; Deleted scenes are found as well.&#34;Escape Plan&#34; is rated R for violence and language throughout. There are no sexual situations or nudity to be found. What we do get is a whole lot of shooting, stabbing, and bare-knuckle brawling. It's definitely NOT fun for the whole family.If you're a big fan of overblown action films of the 1980s, you'll love &#34;Escape Plan.&#34; Imagine Stuart Gordon's &#34;Fortress&#34; blended with &#34;Escape from Alcatraz&#34; and you have an idea of what to expect.

This is a solid little action flick, a twist on the classic prison break film, with a great cast that, in addition to its two stars, features Vincent D&#8217;Onofrio, Sam Neill, Amy Ryan, 50 Cent, and Jim Caviezel. Sylvester Stallone portrays Ray Breslin, a prison break specialist who literally wrote the book on escaping. For a fee, he will go undercover in a high security prison and find the holes. Breslin is in partnership with Vincent D&#8217;Onofrio, who runs the business end of their company. When the CIA approaches them with a high fee offer to test a private &#8220;off book&#8221; prison for terrorists, the two leap at the opportunity. As you might imagine, things go awry and Breslin finds himself imprisoned for life who-knows-where, with no view of the outside, under the thumb of an evil warden and his murderous henchman. To add to Breslin&#8217;s woes, the prison is designed specifically around the suggestions in his own book, a copy of which sits on the warden&#8217;s desk. Breslin almost immediately strikes up a wary friendship with the Schwarzenegger character, a rogue financier&#8217;s right hand man who is being held in the prison until he reveals his bosses&#8217;s whereabouts. The two begin to plot an escape, although they have no idea where on Earth they are. How they find out is fun to watch, especially when Breslin constructs a simple sextant from odds and ends. How they use it, when they cannot see the stars, makes for one of the film&#8217;s more interesting alliances. There is a nice twist (the prison location) midway, and two twists at the end. One satisfactorily explains why the Schwarzenegger character warmed so quickly to Stallone, the other is no surprise, as everyone in the theater can see it coming for about an hour (Breslin, for all his demonstrations of genius intelligence, never figures out). One quibble: the villain is obvious to anyone who has seen a movie before, from the moment that actor appears onscreen, such is casting. But it is a quick, fun ride. What is most pleasing about the film is that Schwarzenegger and Stallone aren&#8217;t playing their ages. These characters are portrayed as younger than the stars themselves, so we are spared all the old man references we got in &#8220;The Last Stand&#8221;. Thanks to makeup, hair, and lighting, it is easy to believe this film was shot fifteen to twenty years ago, so well do the stars carry it off.",4,A Nice Surprise,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,2456,"['Escape', 'Plan', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'solid', 'little', 'action', 'flick', 'twist', 'classic', 'prison', 'break', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'addition', 'two', 'stars', 'features', 'Vincent', 'D', '8217', 'Onofrio', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Amy', 'Ryan', '50', 'Cent', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Ray', 'Breslin', 'prison', 'break', 'specialist', 'who', 'literally', 'wrote', 'book', 'escaping', 'fee', 'will', 'go', 'undercover', 'high', 'security', 'prison', 'find', 'holes', 'Breslin', 'partnership', 'Vincent', 'D', '8217', 'Onofrio', 'who', 'business', 'end', 'company', 'When', 'CIA', 'high', 'fee', 'offer', 'test', 'private', '8220', 'book', '8221', 'prison', 'terrorists', 'two', 'leap', 'opportunity', 'might', 'imagine', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'Breslin', 'imprisoned', 'life', 'who-knows-where', 'view', 'outside', 'thumb', 'evil', 'warden', 'murderous', 'henchman', 'add', 'Breslin', '8217', 's', 'woes', 'prison', 'designed', 'specifically', 'suggestions', 'own', 'book', 'copy', 'warden', '8217', 'desk', 'Breslin', 'almost', 'immediately', 'up', 'wary', 'friendship', 'Schwarzenegger', 'character', 'rogue', 'financier', '8217', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'held', 'prison', 'bosses', '8217', 'whereabouts', 'two', 'begin', 'plot', 'escape', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'Earth', 'are', 'How', 'find', 'out', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'Breslin', 'simple', 'sextant', 'odds', 'ends', 'How', 'use', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'stars', 'one', 'film', '8217', 'more', 'interesting', 'alliances', 'nice', 'twist', 'prison', 'location', 'midway', 'two', 'twists', 'end', 'One', 'satisfactorily', 'why', 'Schwarzenegger', 'character', 'warmed', 'so', 'quickly', 'Stallone', 'other', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'theater', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'hour', 'Breslin', 'demonstrations', 'genius', 'intelligence', 'never', 'out', 'One', 'quibble', 'villain', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', 'moment', 'actor', 'onscreen', 'such', 'casting', 'quick', 'fun', 'ride', 'What', 'most', 'pleasing', 'film', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Stallone', 'aren', '8217', 'playing', 'ages', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'younger', 'stars', 'are', 'spared', 'old', 'man', 'got', '8220', 'Last', 'Stand', '8221', 'Thanks', 'makeup', 'hair', 'lighting', 'easy', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'well', 'do', 'stars', 'carry', 'off']",N/A

1683126,AX53DA3FTILL0,B00H1RMOI6,Gene Siskel,"[160, 174]","The Good- The script is surprisingly well-written. Stallone's methods of escape are explained in intricate detail, all of which are believable and logical. Stallone is still likeable as a lead actor and as usual, you find yourself rooting for him. The action is done old school, not much in the way of CGI (with the exception of a pull away shot of the hi-tech prison). The hits are brutal and when people are shot it looks real. Jim Cavizel is great as the soulless warden of the Tomb. He shows menace without raising his voice, but using his eyes and chillingly even tone to show he is a threat. He also has some good humorous villain moments. The plot is again, surprisingly tight. Everything intertwines and is explained in equal detail as Stallone's escape methods. Schwarzenegger is great in this movie. I can't remember the last time he was so solid. Most of his jokes hit and he even shows some decent acting chops.The BAD- '50 cent' and the blonde who play Stallone's team come right out of a B-movie with their acting. There is also no chemistry between Stallone and his group. Fortunately, they are not in the movie very much. I guess between natural aging and plastic surgery, Stallone has lost some of his facial expressions. At times, especially when he smiles, you really can't tell. Not much, but some the dialogue falls flat.THE DEAL- This movie is a pleasant surprise. A lot of critics are incorrectly labeling it as 'dumb fun' eh, no. The Expendables is dumb fun, Escape Plan is not. While there are a few B-movie moments, this movie is a top-notch action film that will have you engaged in the story. Stallone and Schwarzenegger play off each other well and the action is in your face and realistic. Even though they are older, when Sly and Arnold slap people around you still believe it. This long awaited team-up is everything an action fan could hope for.",5,"More like a 4.5, but too good to give a 4",1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1878,"['Good-', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'well-written', 'Stallone', 'methods', 'escape', 'are', 'explained', 'intricate', 'detail', 'are', 'believable', 'logical', 'Stallone', 'still', 'likeable', 'lead', 'actor', 'usual', 'find', 'rooting', 'action', 'done', 'old', 'school', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'CGI', 'exception', 'pull', 'away', 'shot', 'hi-tech', 'prison', 'hits', 'are', 'brutal', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'shot', 'real', 'Jim', 'Cavizel', 'great', 'soulless', 'warden', 'Tomb', 'menace', 'raising', 'voice', 'using', 'eyes', 'chillingly', 'even', 'tone', 'show', 'threat', 'also', 'good', 'humorous', 'villain', 'moments', 'plot', 'again', 'surprisingly', 'tight', 'Everything', 'intertwines', 'explained', 'equal', 'detail', 'Stallone', 'escape', 'methods', 'Schwarzenegger', 'great', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'solid', 'Most', 'jokes', 'hit', 'even', 'decent', 'acting', 'chops.The', 'BAD-', ""'50"", 'cent', 'blonde', 'who', 'play', 'Stallone', 'team', 'come', 'right', 'B-movie', 'acting', 'also', 'chemistry', 'Stallone', 'group', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'not', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'guess', 'natural', 'aging', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Stallone', 'lost', 'facial', 'expressions', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Not', 'much', 'dialogue', 'flat.THE', 'DEAL-', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'lot', 'critics', 'are', 'incorrectly', 'labeling', ""'dumb"", 'fun', 'eh', 'Expendables', 'dumb', 'fun', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'not', 'are', 'few', 'B-movie', 'moments', 'movie', 'top-notch', 'action', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'engaged', 'story', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'action', 'face', 'realistic', 'Even', 'are', 'older', 'when', 'Sly', 'Arnold', 'slap', 'people', 'still', 'believe', 'long', 'awaited', 'team-up', 'everything', 'action', 'fan', 'could', 'hope']",N/A

The once invulnerable Arnie and Sly now look like they belong in a senior living facility instead of a high security prison and I found myself wincing every time somebody hit one of them and screaming at the TV. Walking frames aside, it's fun to see them back at what they do best and the lack of CGI allows every advantage of raiding 80s action tropes and reminding us how great those silly, macho, simplistic and excellent times really were.But seriously, you can drive a truck through the plot holes, from the prison warden who reads the manual on building the escape-proof prison and then fails to implement any of the ideas, to the &#34;wait, why did they do that?&#34; moments that happen every few minutes. The big surprises are signposted from so far away that you'd have to be comatose not to see the ending coming. Ultimately the promised escape plan is pretty weak, with the bad guys boasting a firearm accuracy that the A-Team would be ashamed of, and a scene that demands Arnie screaming &#34;Geyt to da choppa!&#34; but it never happens.Still, it's an entertaining yarn but I think real life prison wardens can sleep soundly at night.

Breslin (Stallone) teams up with another inmate, smack-talking Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and the escape of a lifetime ensues, via torture, pursuit and the usual high stakes are on the line; their lives.The greatest fun in this movie derives from Stallone and Schwarzenegger zinging each other.

(i.e. &#34;The Expendables&#34;)  So here is another action-packed movie where the both of them once again put their efforts to use.The scene starts off with Stallone sitting in a prison.  He makes it his job to use whatever resources necessary to break out -- and he succeeds!  After the guards are diverted to put out a car bomb fire, Stallone makes his escape and gets driven off to a nearby establishment.  However, the police soon find him and arrest him again!  But the show is over when Stallone's boss, Lester Clark, explains to the authorities that he's just an undercover agent testing out the prisons' security system -- which, of course, systematically failed to keep Stallone inside.So Stallone is now sent out to another institution -- but this time, he gets drugged and un-tagged before he arrives at his destination &#34;The Tomb.&#34;  He will encounter the Warden -- a.k.a. Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel).  And he is sure one mean Warden too!!  Along the way, Stallone will meet his inmate counterpart, Arnold.  The two of them eventually team up to find a way out of this horrible prison!  Halfway along the movie, it will be revealed that one of the &#34;good guys&#34; in the film doesn't turn out to be so good after all.  In fact, he's the inside person who set Stallone up all along!But before that person is revealed, Stallone finds out just where he and the other prisoners are -- a thousand foot long ship that's leading towards Morocco, Africa!  So it's his job -- and Arnold's -- to distract the Warden and his faceless goons while they try to break out!  They also employ the prison doctor's help to summon a rescue helicopter.  While a bunch of chaos ensures, both comrades will eventually make it onto the deck of the ship and fly away.  As for what happens to the Warden -- well, you'll just have to tune in to the end of the movie and watch for yourselves!  :)One really cool scene happens before the very end -- the &#34;inside job&#34; person who set up Stallone will get his very own comeuppance.  And trust me people, he'll deserve it too!  It's not much worse than being buried alive, but it's still a fate worse than death itself HA HA!

1683192,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00H1RMOI6,judy,"[1, 2]","There were always those action stars, who you watched countlessly during the 80's as they pumped out actioner after actioner. And you know just as much as I did, that you fantasized about the possibilities of having those two actors in the same film. But it was just a fantasy, a dream that wouldn't reach reality until more than 30 years later with the release of 'Escape Plan'. Generic title aside, the film features the epic mash up of our Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) and our Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) as two old dudes trying to escape from prison. I must say, I had a great time with this brainless popcorn film, but might as well share what I felt about the film, besides the entertainment level. My review of 'Escape Plan' below.'Escape Plan' follows Ray Breslin (Played by Sylvester Stallone) whose profession is literally escaping from prisons. He walks in disguised as a convict and eventually breaks out. His job is to test prisons to make sure they are escape proof. And finally he meets his match, accepting anew prison named The Tomb, Breslin walks in just as he usually would but in this case, he isn't meant to be allowed out. Aided by fellow prisoner, Emil Rottmayer (Played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), Breslin attempts to escape The Tomb.Yes, I'll admit it's an interesting idea, but once you watch the movie, that idea unfolds rather predictably. It's just the fact that the plot doesn't have enough meat to make it tough to break through. It's basically one layered. Once you finally pick off that layer, you reach the bone, and once you reach the bone, you're basically done. The plot is, because by then you know what's going to unfold to the end. The plot isn't anything you haven't already viewed before in countless other brainless action flicks. It's too lazy, too predictable. It plays out just how you would expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's far from being good. Nothing you see makes you say 'Wow, now that's something I've never seen before'.The dialogue is somewhat lazy and very much expected in this type of film. You have three main action movie dialogue. First up are the cheesy one liners, which were ushered out of the mouths of both Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Next you have the grunts and moans, which passed out the mouths of many characters. And lastly you have the vast shouts of foul language that is the seal of action film approval. Nothing here is more than average dialogue; nothing is said that stimulates your thought train.But I must admit we have two talented leads that ride this tale along with ease, as they are in facts veterans of the genre itself, you could even call the two, two of the founding fathers of the genre. I refuse to praise one over the other, clearly there is a more prominent one of the two throughout the film, taking the possessive lead role, but both hold their own, and in t he end tie for the lead awards. Schwarzenegger and Stallone work well together, they play off each other. Both have great chemistry with the other, and when they meet on screen for the first time, ever, the room goes silent. A small smirk appears across your face at that moment, victory, at last dreams have come true. Schwarzenegger coming off a so-so return to the genre in 'The Last Stand' redeems himself in this film, and Stallone still convinces the audience that no matter his Weighing age, he still has what it takes to lead an action film, convincingly. As for the supporting cast, 'Jim Caviezal' comes to mind. In the recent years, Caviezal has reduced his bigger budgeted film appearances in favor of more independent film work. In his return to the big-budget genre, Caviezal plays the sinister, villainous Warden of The Tomb. Every scene he was in, he stole the show. He held his own to the more experienced leads, who were much more acquainted with the genre then he was himself, and he ends up played a formidable foe to Schwarzenegger and Stallone. While I wished he had more screentime then he was given, he manages to make the most of his time, and till his end, he was the most interesting of the lot, both his performance and his character.Speaking of characters, we don't have many unique ones in this lot. Back stories would have been taken kindly, if only there were any. Only one do we receive and that is for Stallone's character. Now, I must admit the character's back-story is heart wrenching and somewhat emotional, but not very much surprising, once you get to know him. Still never the less, he is one of the few characters that isn't just there to be there. The other interesting character is the film's own villain. He is sophisticated, clever, mean, crazy, and calm. He is everything at once; it's a lot to take in, in the few minutes he has per scene he's in. But man, do you solute him off with awe. A spotlighted character in a sea of unmentionables.The sets were pretty marveling. The prison itself was pretty amazing, the cells, and the reckroom. The prison just was perfectly designed from head to toe. The clear glass cells were pretty well set up, and seemed to go on endlessly. They glowed in the darkened area. The different rooms came out looking like a real prison, just more high tec. It was just amazing and how precise the designers were.What makes an action movie, an action movie is of course the action itself. And when you get to the bottom of it, there is plenty of action, more towards the climax but still there is action. And I must admit it was pretty well choreographed. In the shot that watches over the prisoners as they fight the guards toward the end really comes to mind. That action shot looked to include roughly 33 prisoners and 200 guards. And with smoke blaring, and guns firing and men hollering, you need to make sure it comes out just right. And with relief they do succeed in doing just that. You get perfectly quick and practiced punching and fighting and I just loved every moment of it.The editing is so-so. At times it comes out roughly, which at the most part occurs during Stallone's quick plummet into a pile of water after discovering where he was. And sometimes there is a glitch during fight scenes, some shots of the cells weren't angled perfectly but overall it comes out fine.I must spend a moment to praise the entertainment level the film had. Not during one moment did I stop, and yawn. I was wide awake and chewing down on my supply of popcorn. That's what the film is, a popcorn film. Brainless, as it was, it was still very entertaining. And to the common moviegoer that's exactly what they want. Something that distracts their minds from the stress of reality, and the film does just that. It entertains you, and leaves you happy in the end. So that only makes it hard to hate the film.All and all, 'Escape Plan' serves you what you want, brainless entertainment, and with that sacrifices an excellent cast, with an uninspiring story and characters you'll end up forgetting in the end.

Even if the person who wrote the movie has never been to prison, or escape from anything, the truth is always stranger than fiction and the source material for this came from someone's personal experience. Not necessarily breaking out of prison, but Shawshank 2013 was going to come out eventually. Sylvester Stallone, when I see him now versus when he played Rocky, I guess that at some point actors will consider getting some work on their face or the body, and while he gives a good performance, the emotions of a scene seems to Escape him for whatever was Plan-ned. Unless it's a fight scene where his lips have to skew at an angle to show that energy from his punch, Stallone will never again cry like Rocky did when his trainer died or give another gut-wrenching yell, ""Adrienne!"" Arnold, on the other hand, left from being a governor to getting back into the spotlight to make up that revenue he missed out on that being a governor could not match. He seems to accept aging, recognizing Predator would not see him as a threat anymore. The pressure must be intense when an actor wants a roll but a few years have come and gone and the next he or she is being touted as the next great actor to come along in a generation. So what are your options: go under the knife in an feeble attempt to shed a few years, only to look like an age that no one can tell? Or, become a people greeter at Wallie World, and you know to get full time hours is rare with that monopoly? Ah, I digress, Escape Plan was good enough that I purchased it without any regret, good enough that my wife and I have watched it again. If this was the 80s, when they were at the peak of their popularity, matching these two on the same screen would have been the equivalent to The Avengers, or any other billion dollar generating money maker, for sure.

1683241,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00H1RMOI6,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There was a time when just the mention of the names Stallone and Schwarzenegger guaranteed mega-box office receipts. To hear one of them had a movie coming out in theaters was to insure long lines at the box-office. But as they've grown older and as the audience going to the theater has aged as well, it's not quite the same. There is still that small amount of buzz behind their names but not like the glory days. The new movie ESCAPE PLAN taps into those movies they once made. Watching it is like going back to the late 70s/early 80s. In truth they've aged well and remain at the top of their game.Stallone plays Ray Breslin, a security expert who knows how to find the loopholes in any given situation. Currently he's part owner and the main man in a company that sends him into any prison unbeknownst to the warden and guards so that he can find the leaks in their system and escape. There has yet to be a prison he hasn't walked out of. The movie opens with him in prison and finding a way out, demonstrating his abilities.Once his skills have been established we find Ray back in his office when a CIA agent shows offering top dollar for him to escape from a super secret prison that has just been built to house the worst of the worst. With only 24 hours to prepare, something he doesn't do, Ray's partner Lester (Vincent D'Onofrio) urges him to take the job and the $5 million paycheck. Against his better judgment he takes the job. The next day he finds himself in New Orleans, kidnapped and the tracker chip inserted into his arm removed. Something is amiss.Ray wakes to find himself in a prison unlike any other. Rather than concrete cells each cell is made of extreme plexi-glass and surrounding a core stairwell. This is a prison unlike any he's ever experienced with guards rotating at odd hours and no way out that he can see. But when he gives the pass code that is supposed to insure his release, he is ignored. It seems that a double cross was done somewhere along the line and Ray is now an actual prisoner in an escape proof prison.Discovering the day to day routine at the hands of head guard Drake (Vinnie Jones) who seems to enjoy inflicting pain and the warden of the prison Hobbs (Jim Caviezel), Ray sets about learning who is who in the prisoner hierarchy. He soon makes friends with Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) but doesn't reveal who he is. After finding himself on the Hobbes short list, he agrees to a deal: help Hobbes find out the location of Rottmayer's partner on the outside and he'll be set free.But Ray doesn't like being placed not only in a physical cell but a mental one as well. It may seem that he's helping the Hobbes get the information that he wants but in truth he continues doing what he does best, finding an escape from an inescapable prison. He pulls Rottmayer into his plan and the viewer is now caught up in a mix of possible crosses and double crosses as the action unfolds and the escape draws near. Will they get out or is this the one place that offers no hope of escape?Stallone does a wonderful job in this movie. This is classic Stallone where he displays an intelligence in his character that lies beneath that tough exterior. We know that if there is a way out, he will find it. Schwarzenegger also brings back the old Arnie we know and love, the tough as nails fighter and loyal friend who will eventually come up with some catch phrase that will be his signature for this movie. These are the actors we loved back in the 80s doing what they do best, making unbelievable characters believable or at least making us like them so much we don't notice how unbelievable they are.The movie is just a fun roller coaster ride of action combined with brains to make the whole outlandish concept seem real. We thrill to the ride as we plunge over hills and down valleys never knowing what's around the next bend. Through it all we have a great time and enjoy the ride not caring about the construction or safety of it all, just enjoying ourselves. That's what the old Sly and Arnold movies offered so long ago, just a good time watching the movie. It's nice to see that the two of them can still pull it off.",4,POSITIVE PLOTTING,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4161,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'just', 'mention', 'names', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'guaranteed', 'mega-box', 'office', 'receipts', 'hear', 'one', 'had', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'theaters', 'was', 'insure', 'long', 'lines', 'box-office', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'older', 'audience', 'going', 'theater', 'aged', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'still', 'small', 'amount', 'buzz', 'names', 'not', 'glory', 'days', 'new', 'movie', 'ESCAPE', 'PLAN', 'movies', 'once', 'made', 'Watching', 'going', 'back', 'late', '70s/early', '80s', 'truth', ""'ve"", 'aged', 'well', 'remain', 'top', 'game.Stallone', 'Ray', 'Breslin', 'security', 'expert', 'who', 'how', 'find', 'loopholes', 'given', 'situation', 'Currently', 'part', 'owner', 'main', 'man', 'company', 'prison', 'unbeknownst', 'warden', 'guards', 'so', 'can', 'find', 'leaks', 'system', 'escape', 'yet', 'be', 'prison', ""n't"", 'walked', 'movie', 'prison', 'finding', 'way', 'demonstrating', 'abilities.Once', 'skills', 'have', 'been', 'established', 'find', 'Ray', 'back', 'office', 'when', 'CIA', 'agent', 'offering', 'top', 'dollar', 'escape', 'super', 'secret', 'prison', 'just', 'been', 'built', 'house', 'worst', 'worst', 'only', '24', 'hours', 'prepare', 'something', ""n't"", 'do', 'Ray', 'partner', 'Lester', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'take', 'job', '5', 'million', 'paycheck', 'better', 'judgment', 'job', 'next', 'day', 'New', 'Orleans', 'kidnapped', 'tracker', 'chip', 'inserted', 'arm', 'removed', 'Something', 'amiss.Ray', 'wakes', 'find', 'prison', 'other', 'Rather', 'concrete', 'cells', 'cell', 'made', 'extreme', 'plexi-glass', 'surrounding', 'core', 'stairwell', 'prison', 'ever', 'experienced', 'guards', 'rotating', 'odd', 'hours', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'pass', 'code', 'supposed', 'insure', 'release', 'ignored', 'double', 'cross', 'was', 'done', 'somewhere', 'line', 'Ray', 'now', 'actual', 'prisoner', 'escape', 'proof', 'prison.Discovering', 'day', 'day', 'routine', 'hands', 'head', 'guard', 'Drake', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'who', 'enjoy', 'inflicting', 'pain', 'warden', 'prison', 'Hobbs', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Ray', 'learning', 'who', 'who', 'prisoner', 'hierarchy', 'soon', 'friends', 'Rottmayer', 'Schwarzenegger', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'who', 'finding', 'Hobbes', 'short', 'list', 'deal', 'help', 'Hobbes', 'find', 'out', 'location', 'Rottmayer', 'partner', 'outside', ""'ll"", 'be', 'set', 'free.But', 'Ray', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'placed', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'cell', 'mental', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'seem', 'helping', 'Hobbes', 'get', 'information', 'truth', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'finding', 'escape', 'inescapable', 'prison', 'Rottmayer', 'plan', 'viewer', 'now', 'caught', 'up', 'mix', 'possible', 'crosses', 'double', 'crosses', 'action', 'unfolds', 'escape', 'draws', 'Will', 'get', 'out', 'one', 'place', 'hope', 'escape', 'Stallone', 'wonderful', 'job', 'movie', 'classic', 'Stallone', 'where', 'intelligence', 'character', 'beneath', 'tough', 'exterior', 'know', 'way', 'will', 'find', 'Schwarzenegger', 'also', 'back', 'old', 'Arnie', 'know', 'love', 'tough', 'nails', 'fighter', 'loyal', 'friend', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'up', 'catch', 'phrase', 'will', 'be', 'signature', 'movie', 'are', 'actors', 'loved', 'back', '80s', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'making', 'unbelievable', 'characters', 'believable', 'least', 'making', 'so', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'how', 'unbelievable', 'are.The', 'movie', 'just', 'fun', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'action', 'combined', 'brains', 'make', 'whole', 'outlandish', 'concept', 'seem', 'real', 'thrill', 'ride', 'plunge', 'hills', 'down', 'valleys', 'never', 'knowing', 'what', 'next', 'bend', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'not', 'caring', 'construction', 'safety', 'just', 'enjoying', 'what', 'old', 'Sly', 'Arnold', 'movies', 'offered', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'just', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'nice', 'see', 'two', 'can', 'still', 'pull', 'off']",N/A

1683243,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B00H1RMOI6,Marshall Lord,"[0, 0]","&#34;Escape Plan&#34; is an amusing, exciting modern fantasy about an escape from the most impregnable prison ever constructed, starring the two great rival all-action stars Arnold Schwartzenegger and Silvester &#34;Sly&#34; Stallone.If you stop to think about whether any of it actually makes sense you will be in trouble, but the action and plot carries you along so convincingly that it's quite easy to suspend disbelief. Both the main stars have sometimes been accused of wooden performances, partly because both have an impassive style, but I felt that each of them showed in this film that they have become better actors over time, and both were superb in this. No film pleases everyone but I think this was one of the best performances each of the main leads has ever given, and most people who liked the films either has made before will like this.Several of the supporting stars, particularly Sam Neill as the prison doctor, Jim Caviezel as the sinister warden, Hobbes, and Vinnie Jones as a hard man guard, also gave strong performances.Sly Stallone plays Ray Breslin, an expert on discovering and fixing flaws in maximum security prisons. After demonstrating the weaknesses in yet another state penitentiary, he is approached by the CIA who want him to check if there are any flaws in the place they keep their most dangerous prisoners. I don't want to say too much more about the plot to avoid spoilers, but Breslin and a character called Rottmayer played by Arnold Schwartzenegger have to team up to escape from the most secure prison ever created ...Lots of suspense, lots of plot twists some of which most viewers will seecoming a mile off and some which most people won't. Plenty of gallows humour and a few characters face moral dilemmas. Although there is a lot of action and some aspects of the plot don't make much sense, this is a more intelligent film than is common for the genre as Sly and Arnie have to use their wits as well as muscles to defeat the undefeatable barriers put in their way.OK, obviously it's not &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; nor does it try to be, but this film is entertaining and exciting nonsense rather than just nonsense.

The story itself sounded interesting&#8230;but I wasn&#8217;t so sure two actors like Stallone and Schwarzenegger could carry it.  Fortunately, I was dead wrong on my assumptions.  These two screen veterans help to make ESCAPE PLAN a taut and entertaining thrill-ride.If you decide to watch ESCAPE PLAN, and I recommend that you do, be sure to go into it with the right mindset.  You&#8217;re not going to get Jason Bourne-like intrigue or see Donnie Yen-like action.  But instead, you&#8217;ll get bare-knuckles intensity from two legendary action-actors and a slick plot with twists and turns you won&#8217;t see coming.ESCAPE PLAN is shot well and the production value looks very high.  The sets look great, particularly The Tomb itself.  I am impressed with the lengths to which the production team went to make this set a viable and realistic looking prison.  I could definitely see something like this being used already.The acting is what you would expect from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, although some of their supporting cast (specifically Curtis Jackson) didn&#8217;t quite fit for me.  Others helped accentuate the authenticity of a prison setting, including Faran Tahir as a foreign prisoner and Vinnie Jones as a barbaric prison guard.The story itself, however, is the real winner here.  I like the concept, right down to its core; and the twists and turns that are strewn throughout the plot only make the movie that much more enjoyable.  I enjoyed the way the movie ended and feel like everyone pretty much got what they deserved.ESCAPE PLAN is a fun and energetic film that fans of either actor or those that enjoy straight-up action flicks will enjoy.  Full of wit and intensity, this movie should appeal to a variety of fans.  Be sure and snag the Blu-ray if you can; aside from the superior picture and sound quality, you get some great Special Features, including a couple of cool behind-the-scenes featurettes.

1683254,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00H1RMOI6,Micheal Hunt,"[2, 2]","Like many, it's a surprise to see Stallone and Schwarzenegger finally in a movie together (with the exception of The Expendeables, but that was a cameo by Arnie in those). Had these two teamed up back in the 80's or early 90's, it would have probably broken box office records no matter what they where in. Now it just seems like what was a pipe dream years ago is finally a reality, but a few years too late for it ride on the fact these two are in it alone and make it epic.Stallone plays a character whose job is to escape from prisons to determine if they are escape proof or not? That is until he finds himself hired to attempt to escape from a secret prison that is off the radar. Only Stallone finds out where he is sent is designed and run by someone who has studied how he broke out of a bunch of prisons, and has also been paid to keep Stallone from ever escaping.Pretty thin sounding plot, and you can guess the end already. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a prison inmate who takes a liking to Stallone right off the bat. The chemistry between Stallone playing the typical loner character with no emotions but to escape and Arnold trying to act like your average everyday Joe that has always come off laughable just don't mesh well together in this film.Stallone pretty much must have agreed to do the film is Arnie was his side-kick and not the other way around, as Stallone pretty much tries to take control of the movie while Arnie feels like he is phoning it in.Escape plan, where are they, and how will they get out? A predictable ending and not so much action as you would expect these two to deliver. Overall, if one or the other stars of this film where not in it, it would be an easily forgettable flick, had neither of them done it, it would be an episode you would expect to see on &#34;Prison Break&#34;... not to mention this movie has the worst use of Sam Neil I have ever seen in a movie. An almost completely pointless role.Overall: After viewing it and getting over the fact it's Rambo and The Terminator together... you can see why it was not released in theatres.

1683256,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00H1RMOI6,mitchell5954,"[0, 1]","Escape Plan proves that Arnold and Stallone still have some life left in them in terms of their careers as action stars.  The film has an interesting enough premise, great casting, and some decent action.  So it pretty much has nearly everything you would want from an action popcorn film like this.  However, there are some missteps the film makes, but it does not outright ruin the film.  This film definitely will not win any awards, but that is not the aim for a film like this.  Escape Plan&#8217;s primary goal is to entertain and, in my opinion, it succeeded.The story is fairly simple, but that is not always a bad thing.  Many times with action films when they try to make the plot overly complicated it can make what could have been a good action film into a boring and lackluster one.  The film stars a man named Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) who is a famous escape artist.  He is known for breaking out of high security prisons that are deemed in-escapable.  However, he is framed and put into a prison that he indirectly helped to design.  To escape he has to team up with a small group of inmates, mainly a man named Emil (Arnold Schwarzenegger).The acting is fine for what it is.  You do not go to movie like this for Oscar-worthy performances.  Stallone does alright, although whenever he tries to sound like he is super intelligent and explain complex science it comes off a little funny.  I buy Stallone as a scientist as much as I bought Arnold as a scientist in the movie Junior.  The movie even acknowledges it, but it is still silly.  However, I have to admit, this is probably one of Arnold&#8217;s better performances in a long time.  Yes, he does spam the one-liners a lot, but he also tries other forms of acting besides being the badass (which he is in the film).  There are many points were Arnold&#8217;s character is put in many terrible positions and shows much vulnerability and emotion.  This is the first time in a while where Arnold is put in such a vulnerable position.  It is not going to win any awards, but I thought it was pretty good for Arnold.  Sam Neil also appears in a small role, which I like.  I am glad that the man is still getting some, though I wish I could have seen more of him.The film has some good production value.  You can tell that the film has a budget and the money is on the screen.  I do not know how the 3D was because I only saw it in 2D.  The film also has some pretty decent action, though most of it comes at the end.  There is some action in the beginning and middle but it is few and far between.  It is mostly Arnold and Stallone plotting their escape.  This film does not have wall-to-wall action, which some people might be disappointed about.There are some issues with the film as I mentioned earlier.  Firstly, the villains are not that strong.  The main villain of the film, Hobbes, is horrible.  He is played by Jim Caviezel or as I like to call non-Matthew Fox (Jack Shepard from Lost).  It seemed like he was trying to channel Bob Gunton from Shawshank Redemption, and it does not work at all.  Caviezel either overacts his lines or underacts them.  Secondly, there is a twist by the end of the film that you see coming a mile away.  Even the film acknowledged that it was a pretty obvious twist.Overall, Escape plan was an entertaining escape/action film, as well as a good time at the movies.  It was nice to see Arnold and Stallone working together in a film outside of the Expendables.  The film does have good production value and some decent action at the end.

She also happens to be Arnie's daughter,and Arnie is the mysterious Manheim!She also reveals that Sly's boss did a runaround on both him and her and in order to keep the $5 million for himself,had Sly sent away&#34;permanently&#34;.Sly gets back home and his partners have been informed of their bosses double dealings.The film ends with the boss,his SUV with him in it,locked in a cargo container on a freighter bound for......?The film is tension filled throughout as the camera gets in really close  with a you-are-there feel to it.The socko ending really catches one off guard.As Sly says when he learns that Arnie is Manheim,&#34;Gee,I didn't see that one coming&#34;.Neither did we.Both Arnie and Sly work well together,playing off one another.Faran Tahir as Javid also manages to do a very credible job and holds his own with the two main stars.Caviezel is one twisted son of a gun of a warden.The S/FX are good as is the action,which ebbs and flows at just the right moments.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:77:1.Extras include commentary and a featurette.All in all chalk this up as another winner for Mr.Stallone.He is on a definite roll of late and we can only wish for better things to come.Arnie is certainly&#34;baaack&#34; as he and Sly play well off of each other.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,Sly does it again.,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,5976,"['Escape',

1683315,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00H1RMOI6,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","While not every element of this high-tech prison movie clicks, Stallone and Schwarzenegger make for a good cinematic team and save the movie from falling into treacherous b-movie territory. The story is pretty simple: Stallone plays a guy who breaks out of prison for a living to test their security. However, on his latest job, he's set up and left to rot. He ends up joining forces with Schwarzenegger, and the two of them attempt to break out. These stars are the primary reason to see this film because most of the supporting cast just isn't given too much to do, nor are a lot of the bit parts particularly well acted or have compelling characters. Stallone and Schwarzenegger's characters aren't terribly well written either, but just enough detail is given and both of them bring some charisma to their roles. The also play off of one another quite well. The surprise gift in the cast, however, is Jim Caviezel as a sadistic warden. He plays his part with a certain calm and poise, which could be unsettling at times considering some of the violence he perpetrates on the inmates under his charge. In fact, a lot of the violence wasn't particularly fun to watch (not that violence should necessarily be fun to watch, though). Some of the negatives I can point out are a rather weak script that has a lot of implausibilities and narrative contrivances. There were a few twists, but nothing that a discerning moviegoer couldn't tell ahead of time. Out of the cast, Curtis &#34;50 Cent&#34; Jackson stood out as probably the worst of them all. He can't act, and I don't know why he keeps getting roles, especially here as a tech wizard. There was also some bad CGI explosions which looked out of place. Overall, this is an ok piece of &#34;escape&#34;-ist entertainment (see what I did there?).

From the start to the finish this film moves like the thundering roller coaster, and delivers with both barrels. Even the much demeaned Curtis Jackson in my opinion delivers on the level of the prime players. Whilst Sly's character &#34;Ray Breslin&#34; is a security analyst, we are continually left guessing as to who is who for the rest of the film. This delivers two characters that one producer has hinted may be used again in a follow-up film or films. It is very clear that everyone doing the film enjoyed themselves, so it will be just a matter of whether the financial returns can be justified for anyone backing the films. But, as far as this film goes, it's fun it's enjoyable and as one person put it, it's a thinking man's action film, and I agree with that.The extras on the Blu-ray are superb. The audio commentary with the director and cowriter is very insightful and very enjoyable. The feature about the making of the film called EXECUTING THE PLAN runs in at approximately 20 to 22 minutes and is a lot of fun. The feature called CLASH OF THE TITANS is partially a mini bio of sly and Arnold as well as their role in ESCAPE PLAN, and runs approximately 13 to 15 minutes. The documentary THE REAL LIFE TOMB is partially a history of prisons as well as &#34;corrections&#34; in the US; whilst they clearly want you to believe that the maximum security prisons as well as the federal super Max is un-breachable, they do qualify their statements with almost escape proof, and pay close attention to the comments made by Bruce Schneier, since he is a well-respected security analyst who knows his material, and to top it all off he is not the only one who raises a few doubts about the total security of these high and super Max security prisons. They better up their game, since whilst they sneer at ESCAPE PLAN being pure Hollywood, their own prisons are not 100% escape proof. If you want to believe that you are safe from the super criminals, do not watch this documentary called THE REAL-LIFE TOMB.The deleted scenes are a disappointment: key scenes are deleted one was in my opinion essential.

While the basic idea of &#8220;the most secure prison&#8221; may be stretching credibility, it is fun nonetheless watching two stars teaming up for the big screen (though, as the story is basically about Ray, Stallone&#8217;s screen time is longer.)The supporting cast includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Curtis &#34;50 Cent&#34; Jackson, Vinnie Jones, Amy Ryan and Faran Tahir. Except for Faran Tahir&#8217;s role, none of the characters are fleshed out enough, especially Jackson and Ryan&#8217;s that are underwritten and even pointless.So finally Stallone and Schwarzenegger are in one movie together (and not in a cameo role).

He&#8217;s the best of the best and actually wrote the book that all prison designers now use. When his partner, Lester Clark (Vincent D&#8217;Onofrio) gets a hugely profitable contract with a company that has designed an international super-prison. The problem is that the prison is virtually off the grid and Breslin will have to work for awhile without the use of his team. Breslin agrees to the job. However, after his incarceration he realizes that he was set-up by someone and that breaking out of The Tomb is going to be much more difficult than anything he&#8217;s ever done before. Not long after his arrival, he becomes acquainted with another inmate, Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a political prisoner that the warden of The Tomb (Jim Cavizel) is determined to extract information from. Rottmayer agrees to help Breslin, but only on the condition that he gets to escape with him whenever Breslin does break out. Thus begins the action duo movie that people have been wanting to see since the mid-1980s.I really enjoyed ESCAPE PLAN. I found it to be a well-written action movie, with classic elements of a heist picture. It reminded me of a cross between THE GREAT ESCAPE and an 1980s action movie. They don&#8217;t make as many action movies as they did in the 1980s and 1990s . When they do, the movies are full of mostly CGI effects. Although there is some CGI in ESCAPE PLAN, it&#8217;s more of an old-school action film that relies about physical action instead of green-screened scenarios.Movie fans will probably enjoy watching the ESCAPE PLAN if for no other reason that it&#8217;s finally the duo movie the Stallone and Schwarzenegger star in together. The two men had been rumored to be starring in a movie together since the 1980s, but it never happened. They did appear together on screen in the recent EXPENDABLES films, but Schwarzenegger&#8217;s role was nothing more than a bloated cameo. ESCAPE PLANE is the movie where the audience finally gets to see them starring on screen together. They&#8217;re both a bit more wizened and grizzled than they were back their action-starring days of the 1980s and 1990s, but that doesn&#8217;t make the pleasure of seeing them on screen together any less.Of course, even if you don&#8217;t care about seeing Stallone and Schwarzenegger together in a movie, ESCAPE PLAN is still a pretty decent action/heist flick.The DVD version of the movie includes an audio commentary with the director and one of the co-writers and a featurette entitled &#8220;Executing the Plan: The Making of ESCAPE PLAN.&#8221;",4,Starring Together for the First Time,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2722,"['ESCAPE', 'PLAN', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Ray', 'Breslin', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'being', 'sent', 'prisons', 'test', 'security', 'levels', '8217', 'best', 'best', 'actually', 'wrote', 'book', 'prison', 'designers', 'now', 'use', 'When', 'partner', 'Lester', 'Clark', 'Vincent', 'D', '8217', 'Onofrio', 'hugely', 'profitable', 'contract', 'company', 'designed', 'international', 'super-prison', 'problem', 'prison', 'virtually', 'grid', 'Breslin', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'awhile', 'use', 'team', 'Breslin', 'job', 'However', 'incarceration', 'was', 'set-up', 'someone', 'breaking', 'Tomb', 'going', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'anything', '8217', 'ever', 'done', 'before', 'Not', 'long', 'arrival', 'acquainted', 'inmate', 'Emil', 'Rottmayer', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'political', 'prisoner', 'warden', 'Tomb', 'Jim', 'Cavizel', 'determined', 'extract', 'information', 'Rottmayer', 'help', 'Breslin', 'only', 'condition', 'escape', 'whenever', 'Breslin', 'break', 'out', 'Thus', 'action', 'duo', 'movie', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'mid-1980s.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'ESCAPE', 'PLAN', 'found', 'be', 'well-written', 'action', 'movie', 'classic', 'elements', 'heist', 'picture', 'reminded', 'cross', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ESCAPE', '1980s', 'action', 'movie', 'don', '8217', 't', 'make', 'many', 'action', 'movies', 'did', '1980s', '1990s', 'When', 'do', 'movies', 'are', 'full', 'mostly', 'CGI', 'effects', 'CGI', 'ESCAPE', 'PLAN', '8217', 's', 'more', 'old-school', 'action', 'film', 'about', 'physical', 'action', 'instead', 'green-screened', 'scenarios.Movie', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'ESCAPE', 'PLAN', 'other', 'reason', '8217', 'finally', 'duo', 'movie', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'star', 'together', 'two', 'men', 'had', 'been', 'rumored', 'be', 'starring', 'movie', 'together', '1980s', 'never', 'happened', 'did', 'appear', 'together', 'screen', 'recent', 'EXPENDABLES', 'films', 'Schwarzenegger', '8217', 's', 'role', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'bloated', 'cameo', 'ESCAPE', 'PLANE', 'movie', 'where', 'audience', 'finally', 'see', 'starring', 'screen', 'together', '8217', 're', 'bit', 'more', 'wizened', 'grizzled', 'were', 'back', 'action-starring', 'days', '1980s', '1990s', 'doesn', '8217', 'make', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'screen', 'together', 'less.Of', 'course', 'even', 'don', '8217', 'care', 'seeing', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'together', 'movie', 'ESCAPE', 'PLAN', 'still', 'pretty', 'decent', 'action/heist', 'flick.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'one', 'co-writers', 'featurette', 'entitled', '8220', 'Executing', 'Plan', 'Making', 'ESCAPE', 'PLAN.', '8221']",N/A

Each time they pan from Sly to Arnold it's like you're watching one of their own separate movies. Rarely do they actually &#34;feel&#34; like a team, like having De Niro and Pacino on the screen both at once (that was a failed attempt already). They both have their own great presence, so it's like watching two different films. Anyway, the concept is pretty cool, and a lot of the ideas Stallone comes up with are pretty cool, yet a bit far fetched, using milk cartons, cotton balls and basic pieces of metal just aren't very convincing for an &#34;Escape Plan&#34;. The action is well paced, and the acting is good. Actually the worst being one of the better actors, Jim Caviezil. He just really doesn't cut it as an evil warden, Sam Neil on the other hand (who plays the doc), would have made an excellent bad guy. That's really one of the few downfalls of the movie.It drops the basic F-bombs but nothing to overbearing. The violence is pretty minimal, and the gun play is pretty good as well, but not until you start getting towards the end of the film. They try to make you think through the majority of it. So all and all it's a pretty good action flick with some good scenes. That's about the extent of it, not much &#34;substance&#34;, or storyline here. Although there is a nice surprise at the end. (wink)Btw-Something funny on one of the other posters it shows them both standing in cells with machine guns. Oddly enough Stallone never touches a machine gun in the whole movie.

I got excited by the teaming up of my two action idols and made the purchase.  Now I am doing time financially.  Can't escape it.  But you can.  DO NOT BUY this movie.  Here's why:1) The dialogue is absolutely terrible at some points.  Remember in the 80's when these two used to spout silly catch phrases and witty (?) comebacks?  Well, opportunities are manufactured for each of them to say things, but they say the lamest, most meaningless things to each other.  Almost as if they do not want to say something corny, but they have no writer to help them with wit!2) The first half of the movie is more interesting.  The second half has better action.  The movie is just not that exciting all the way through.  If I explain more, I will dump spoilers, so maybe I should just say the film is unbalanced.3) For a movie about escaping prisons, there is not much being done.  Two prisons.  A couple techniques exercised.  That's all.  Don't expect an intricate and interesting plot.  It's not bad, but this is no heist movie with many working parts that cause tension.4) Incredibly predicable twist at the end.  Cheap even.  I expected better writing.  This is A-Team level writing.  (The TV show)5) Unexplained character connections.  Why should we care about Stallone's crew?  Why do they care about each other?  No idea.  Why do Arnold's contacts help him?  Why do they have access to the hardware they bring?  No idea.Is it entertaining?  Yes.  Is it deep and interesting?  No.  There are a few tense moments, some good violence, and that's it.  This is a superficial story which is really just an excuse to see two heroes act together.Remember the thrill and promise of a good ride that Arnold and Carl Weathers meeting each other gave us in Predator?

A Sly and Arnie team-up action thriller, this is the movie we had been waiting years to see! Despite not being hits at the box office, I really enjoyed The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head so I was very excited to see Escape Plan and hoped it would be up there with the other previously released films.While the film had a good start and some decent moments, it ended up being one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. First off, the film despite starring two of the biggest action stars of all time, feels much more like a generic prison escape thriller than an action movie. It does have action here and there, but not nearly as much as you'd expect. And without enough action, there just isn't enough there to keep the film entertaining for it's nearly 2 hour runtime. While Arnold who looked like he was having a blast was very fun to watch, Stallone looked tired and seemed like he really didn't want to be there and just showed up for a paycheck. I love Stallone, but he really did take some of the much needed energy out of a film that was in need of it. The story was interesting for the first half of the film, but I felt like it really dragged around the halfway point and really wanted it to wrap things up. The action that is in the film is actually very good and the climax which goes on for a good 20 minutes is awesome!It did have it's moments, but being a huge fan of the two actors, I couldn't help but feel extremely letdown. It just felt dull and rather generic for what it could've been. Worth renting, but it's just disappointing knowing how great this could've been. I'd recommend The Last Stand, Bullet to the Head, or Homefront if you are looking for 80's-esque action films.",2,"As a fan of Sly and Arnold, This was very disappointing!",1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1825,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'titled', '34', 'Tomb', '34', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Sly', 'Arnie', 'team-up', 'action', 'thriller', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'see', 'not', 'being', 'hits', 'box', 'office', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'Escape', 'Plan', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'other', 'previously', 'released', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'start', 'decent', 'moments', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', 'year', 'First', 'film', 'starring', 'two', 'biggest', 'action', 'stars', 'time', 'feels', 'much', 'more', 'generic', 'prison', 'escape', 'thriller', 'action', 'movie', 'have', 'action', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'enough', 'action', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'there', 'keep', 'film', 'entertaining', 'nearly', '2', 'hour', 'runtime', 'Arnold', 'who', 'looked', 'was', 'having', 'blast', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'watch', 'Stallone', 'looked', 'tired', 'seemed', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'paycheck', 'love', 'Stallone', 'really', 'did', 'take', 'much', 'needed', 'energy', 'film', 'was', 'need', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'felt', 'really', 'dragged', 'halfway', 'point', 'really', 'wanted', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'action', 'film', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'climax', 'good', '20', 'minutes', 'awesome', 'did', 'have', 'moments', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'two', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'extremely', 'letdown', 'just', 'felt', 'dull', 'rather', 'generic', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Worth', 'renting', 'just', 'disappointing', 'knowing', 'how', 'great', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Bullet', 'Head', 'Homefront', 'are', 'looking', ""80's-esque"", 'action', 'films']",N/A
