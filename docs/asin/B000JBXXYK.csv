She's had several fine performances, but this time she outshines herself in 'Sherrybaby'.  In this movie she plays an ex-convict on parole after three years in prison.  Getting out is a hard transition, and Gyllenhaal knows her character thoroughly.  Being someone who stole money to supply a heroin addiction, her road to recovery in and out of prison is rocky at best.  She has tough parole officers who won't give her an inch and starts living in a half-way house with others who are a living hell.  A recovering addict and former inmate, her nerves are frayed, so it is understandable that she is impatient to get her life back together.  Her daughter, Alexis, has stayed with her brother, Bobby (Brad William Henke) and sister-in-law, Lynette (Bridget Barkas).  Alexis is happy to see her mother, but is torn between her and her uncle's family whom she accepts as her own.  Her sister-in-law is protective and isn't willing just to give up her foster child at the drop of a hat.The film is written and directed by Laurie Collyer, who, along with Gyllenhaal, keep the movie real throughout.  It is always a step forward for Sherry who is torn between being a good citizen and model mother, and the old Sherry who got herself into trouble in the first place.  Often times she finds herself going to AA meetings one minute; then offering sex to get ahead, the next.  We don't always like the character, but, this is really to the film's credit.  She's a believable, but not always a good, protagonist.  One old acquaintance, has some good advice, ""If you wouldn't talk about what you want all the time...Maybe it will come to you.""  Her recitation of the St. Francis Prayer at AA meetings pinpoints her condition, ""Give me the help to change what I can,  accept what I can't, and the ability to know the difference.""  It's at the crux of the problem.  While some of the movie develops like a fine TV adventure, key elements, especially Gyllenhaal's remarkable performance, make the movie a fine film.",3,Cutting off the Ball and Chain,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2035,"['Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'roll', 'had', 'several', 'fine', 'performances', 'time', ""'Sherrybaby"", 'movie', 'ex-convict', 'parole', 'three', 'years', 'prison', 'Getting', 'out', 'hard', 'transition', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'thoroughly', 'Being', 'someone', 'who', 'stole', 'money', 'supply', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'road', 'recovery', 'prison', 'rocky', 'best', 'tough', 'parole', 'officers', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'inch', 'living', 'half-way', 'house', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'hell', 'recovering', 'addict', 'former', 'inmate', 'nerves', 'are', 'frayed', 'understandable', 'impatient', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'stayed', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'sister-in-law', 'Lynette', 'Bridget', 'Barkas', 'Alexis', 'happy', 'see', 'mother', 'torn', 'uncle', 'family', 'whom', 'own', 'sister-in-law', 'protective', ""n't"", 'willing', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'foster', 'child', 'drop', 'hat.The', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Laurie', 'Collyer', 'who', 'Gyllenhaal', 'keep', 'movie', 'real', 'always', 'step', 'forward', 'Sherry', 'who', 'torn', 'being', 'good', 'citizen', 'model', 'mother', 'old', 'Sherry', 'who', 'got', 'trouble', 'first', 'place', 'going', 'AA', 'meetings', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'offering', 'sex', 'get', 'ahead', 'next', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'character', 'really', 'film', 'credit', 'believable', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'protagonist', 'One', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'good', 'advice', 'would', ""n't"", 'talk', 'what', 'want', 'time', 'Maybe', 'will', 'come', 'recitation', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Prayer', 'AA', 'meetings', 'condition', 'Give', 'help', 'change', 'what', 'can', 'accept', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ability', 'know', 'difference', 'crux', 'problem', 'movie', 'fine', 'TV', 'adventure', 'key', 'elements', 'especially', 'Gyllenhaal', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'make', 'movie', 'fine', 'film']",Sherrybaby

1025942,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000JBXXYK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","A little more honest than I expected, `Sherrybaby' really delivers a severe punch to the gut thanks to a daring performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.The film tells the story of Sherry Swanson, a former wild child who was just released from prison after serving a three-year stint for stealing and drug use.  She has tight rules to follow in order to ensure her freedom, but her main concern is her young daughter Alexis.  Alexis has been living with Sherry's brother Bobby and his wife Lynette for the entirety of Sherry's jail-stay, and now that she is out there is an obvious tension mounting between the three of them.  Sherry wants to take over instantaneously as a mother, yet she's never really been one and so making that transition is difficult.  As the pressure begins to suffocate her, she begins to crave her former life as a way to escape the inevitable.Has she really learned her lesson?The film is certainly flawed in areas, and there are times when the construction can seem almost `Lifetime' worthy, but the deeply rooted performances and the scripts ability to remain honest without being preachy (there are insinuations that help explain Sherry's behavior without ever feeling the need to divulge the truth, which is commendable because it allows the audience to think for themselves instead of spoon feeding them sympathies) anchors the film rather well.  I will admit that the film has us sympathize with Sherry a little too much.  While it brings itself back in towards the end (when we witness Sherry realize her own faults), it lacks an objectivity that I think would have made this film nearly perfect.  Despite the brilliant way in which Maggie exposes Sherry's selfishness, we tend to see everything as Sherry sees it, and so we stand firmly at her side, and technically she doesn't deserve that from us; at least not yet.The performances here are all so richly developed.  If you sidestep Lynette's character (which is really nothing but a walking clich&eacute;) and the truly unnecessary love interest (for me, it totally takes away from the film in an odd way) you have a deeply moving look at a broken family.  Sam Bottoms, Brad William Henke and Maggie Gyllenhaal are all superb here.  Sam Bottoms only has a few scenes (two I think), but he works an uncomfortable subtlety into his character that really underlines his serious flaws without making them the forefront of the scene.  In fact, this film carries with it an uncomfortable subtlety that really helps make it feel more human.  I loved what Henke did with his character, maybe because I've lived it and so I completely sympathize with his position.  Being stuck between your wife and her opinions and your blood and their mistakes is a very hard place to be, and despite your own emotions, you can continually feel neglected because everyone around you is selfishly expecting you to be 100% on their side.And then there is Maggie.  The way she crafted this character, with such daring and fearless gusto (yet always maintaining the discomfort that comes from realizing you are a train wreck) is just superb.  She permeates each scene with a radiance that draws you to her.  There is this beautiful honesty that comes from the tragedy she unfolds before us.  Just watch her eyes while others are talking to her.  Gyllenhall understood that Sherry needed to be faulty, yet she needed to be honest.  She's honest to a fault.  She craves everything she feels as though she lost while locked away, and she wants it right now.  Her dinner scene, the singing scene, to me was the most raw and personal because you could see a desperation to be loved and noticed that just bled into her every word.  The way she bounces on the sofa when the family seems to be ignoring her.  She needs to be at the center of everyone's lives because she needs to be sure that they love her.So, I do recommend this film.  It needed a little polishing, but it is far more honest than I expected.  It reminds me a tad of `Rachel Getting Married'.  The two films are very different in structure but they carry a similar weight and they craft a similar portrait of a young woman trying to atone for her past mistakes.Watch them both.",4,"No pain, no gain...",1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,4190,"['little', 'more', 'honest', 'expected', 'Sherrybaby', 'really', 'severe', 'punch', 'gut', 'thanks', 'daring', 'performance', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal.The', 'film', 'story', 'Sherry', 'Swanson', 'former', 'wild', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', 'three-year', 'stint', 'stealing', 'drug', 'use', 'tight', 'rules', 'follow', 'order', 'ensure', 'freedom', 'main', 'concern', 'young', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'Alexis', 'been', 'living', 'Sherry', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'wife', 'Lynette', 'entirety', 'Sherry', 'jail-stay', 'now', 'obvious', 'tension', 'mounting', 'three', 'Sherry', 'take', 'over', 'instantaneously', 'mother', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'one', 'so', 'making', 'transition', 'difficult', 'pressure', 'suffocate', 'crave', 'former', 'life', 'way', 'escape', 'inevitable.Has', 'really', 'learned', 'lesson', 'film', 'certainly', 'flawed', 'areas', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'construction', 'can', 'seem', 'almost', 'Lifetime', 'worthy', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'performances', 'scripts', 'ability', 'remain', 'honest', 'being', 'preachy', 'are', 'insinuations', 'help', 'explain', 'Sherry', 'behavior', 'ever', 'feeling', 'need', 'divulge', 'truth', 'commendable', 'audience', 'think', 'instead', 'spoon', 'feeding', 'sympathies', 'anchors', 'film', 'rather', 'well', 'will', 'admit', 'film', 'sympathize', 'Sherry', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'back', 'towards', 'end', 'when', 'witness', 'Sherry', 'realize', 'own', 'faults', 'objectivity', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'brilliant', 'way', 'Maggie', 'Sherry', 'selfishness', 'tend', 'see', 'everything', 'Sherry', 'so', 'stand', 'firmly', 'side', 'technically', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'least', 'not', 'yet.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'richly', 'developed', 'sidestep', 'Lynette', 'character', 'really', 'nothing', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'truly', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'interest', 'totally', 'away', 'film', 'odd', 'way', 'have', 'deeply', 'moving', 'look', 'broken', 'family', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'are', 'superb', 'here', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'two', 'think', 'uncomfortable', 'subtlety', 'character', 'really', 'serious', 'flaws', 'making', 'forefront', 'scene', 'fact', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'subtlety', 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'human', 'loved', 'what', 'Henke', 'did', 'character', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'so', 'completely', 'sympathize', 'position', 'Being', 'stuck', 'wife', 'opinions', 'blood', 'mistakes', 'very', 'hard', 'place', 'be', 'own', 'emotions', 'can', 'continually', 'feel', 'neglected', 'everyone', 'selfishly', 'expecting', 'be', '100', '%', 'side.And', 'then', 'Maggie', 'way', 'crafted', 'character', 'such', 'daring', 'fearless', 'gusto', 'yet', 'always', 'maintaining', 'discomfort', 'realizing', 'are', 'train', 'wreck', 'just', 'superb', 'scene', 'radiance', 'beautiful', 'honesty', 'tragedy', 'Just', 'watch', 'eyes', 'others', 'are', 'talking', 'Gyllenhall', 'understood', 'Sherry', 'needed', 'be', 'faulty', 'needed', 'be', 'honest', 'honest', 'fault', 'everything', 'lost', 'locked', 'away', 'right', 'now', 'dinner', 'scene', 'singing', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'raw', 'personal', 'could', 'see', 'desperation', 'be', 'loved', 'noticed', 'just', 'bled', 'word', 'way', 'sofa', 'when', 'family', 'be', 'ignoring', 'be', 'center', 'everyone', 'lives', 'be', 'sure', 'love', 'her.So', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'needed', 'little', 'polishing', 'far', 'more', 'honest', 'expected', 'tad', 'Rachel', 'Getting', 'Married', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'structure', 'carry', 'similar', 'weight', 'craft', 'similar', 'portrait', 'young', 'woman', 'trying', 'atone', 'past', 'mistakes.Watch']",Sherrybaby

She brings this train-wreck of a woman to vivid life, totally disappearing into the character. Many have described this film as sad, bleak, and disturbing. It is all of these things because the story seems so authentic and real, and her performance is so good. She seems like a real person rather than an actress playing a role: everyone has met someone like Sherry. I believe this is a much better film than some of the reviews here would suggest. So many films today are fluffy, forgettable and emotionally unengaging. This one is strong medicine: it grabs you and pulls you in. My wife liked it a lot, but actually had trouble sleeping after watching it. Since when do all movies have to be syrupy, feel-good confections with an unambiguous happy ending? It is refreshing to see one that seems so honest and real. Ms. Gyllenhaal's performance made me empathize with, and ultimately root for a junkie ex-con.

And although Maggie Gyllenhaal's (WORLD TRADE CENTER) performance as an embittered, used-up druggie just released from prison is well-rendered, the story, as a whole, wasn't completely entertaining nor cohesive.We first meet Sherry Swanson as she walks down the street after being released from jail. She journey's to a half-way house for recent parolees and rents a room. Her goal, though, is to reconnect with her estranged four-year-old daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who lives with Sherry's brother Bobby (Brad William Henke, NORTH COUNTRY) and protective wife Lynette (Bridget Barkan). Bobby and Lynette have taken on the mantle of parents to Alexis, and although Bobby is willing to let Sherry get close to Alexis, Lynette is anything but willing. This obviously angers Sherry and conflicts with her desire to be a good, close mother.Added to this stressor is Sherry's physical desire for male companionship and the heroin she used to use. She tries to stay on the straight-and-narrow but soon falls back into her old lifestyle.Battling her motherly bond along with a history of incestuous abuse by her father, Sherry has so much on her plate that it overwhelms her, causing her to make bad choices.The culmination of these poor judgements presents itself when she tries to abscond with Alexis and crosses state lines (a huge parole violation). But can she understand what's happening to her? Can she make the connection between her own poor upbringing and that of her daughter's uncertain future? This comes to fruition in a public bathroom where Sherry loses her cool and frightens Alexis to the point of incontinence.In the end, Sherry does the right thing and returns Alexis to the safety of Bobby and Lynette's home. But at what cost to herself? What will happen to Sherry now that she's given over much of her parental and motherly duties to her brother and sister-in-law?This is where the biggest script concern lay for Sherrybaby. The resolution is too loose, only showing us Sherry driving away from Bobby and Lynette's home with no understanding as to what will happen to her and Alexis.Nothing should be taken away from Gyllenhaal's performance, though. She is the shining star in this otherwise mundane story.

Pfleeger,"[3, 6]","Laurie Collyer's Sherrybaby presents the bleak picture of a woman just released from prison trying to reconnect with her life, her family, and most importantly with the child she left behind.Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the performance of her career as the title character who is caught in a life spinning out of control. Fighting her own demons and addictions she must come face to face with her past in order to reclaim her present. The film features stand out performances by Brad William Henke as her brother Bobby, Giancarlo Esposito as her parole officer, Danny Trejo as Dean Walker, the man trying to get into her life and a surprisingly good performance by Ryan Simkins as her daughter Alexis. Despite all these performances the film is dominated by the work of Gyllenhaal. She appears in literally every seen and is fearless in her determination to get the part right.The disc does not offer any special features but does include a 5.1 soundtrack. The cinematography by Russell Lee Fine perfectly shows off the New Jersey landscapes that make up Sherry Swanson's life. First time director Collyer deserves kudos for her work also.This small gem was one of the sleepers of 2006 and should not be missed.",4,Stunning Performance By Gyllenhaal,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,1206,"['Laurie', 'Collyer', 'Sherrybaby', 'bleak', 'picture', 'woman', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'life', 'family', 'most', 'importantly', 'child', 'left', 'behind.Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'career', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'caught', 'life', 'spinning', 'control', 'Fighting', 'own', 'demons', 'addictions', 'must', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'past', 'order', 'reclaim', 'present', 'film', 'features', 'stand', 'out', 'performances', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'parole', 'officer', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Dean', 'Walker', 'man', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Ryan', 'Simkins', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'performances', 'film', 'dominated', 'work', 'Gyllenhaal', 'literally', 'seen', 'fearless', 'determination', 'get', 'part', 'disc', 'not', 'offer', 'special', 'features', 'include', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'cinematography', 'Russell', 'Lee', 'Fine', 'perfectly', 'New', 'Jersey', 'make', 'up', 'Sherry', 'Swanson', 'life', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Collyer', 'kudos', 'work', 'also.This', 'small', 'gem', 'was', 'one', 'sleepers', '2006', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Sherrybaby
1025948,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,B000JBXXYK,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[7, 9]","About halfway through watching this fine movie, I realized that I was just as tense as hell.  Tension, of course, implies emotional investment, and emotional investment implies that a movie is really clicking.The movie is about a recovering heroin addict who has just been released on parole from prison, and about her increasingly frustrated attempts to get to know the daughter she had to leave behind.  I won't go into the rest of the plot, but suffice it to say that Sherry's struggles had me on edge.  I wouldn't even consider classifying the movie as a suspense film . . . but I found myself in absolute suspense, feeling during practically every scene that things were on the verge of going wrong, and BADLY wrong at that.  I found that I was feeling more suspense over what was going to become of poor Sherry than I can remember feeling at the movies in a while.Needless to say, the best reason to see the movie is Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Shr's really pretty great.  She really inhabits the character, and what's she's doing often feels less like Acting than it does like . . . well, like you're just watching a real person.  Some people are put off by that kind of performance, but for the rest of us, she's pretty sublime here.  (And I've got to say it . . . DAMN is she hot.  Call me whatever you like, but it's true.  The costume designer for this movie, who apparently had the idea for Gyllenhall to AT NO POINT wear a bra, ought to be given some sort of special Oscar.  Sexist rant now ceases.  Seriously, though . . . HOT.)I was also delighted to find Danny Trejo playing a normal character in this movie.  He's usually playing a criminal or some other type of thug, but here he's just a charming, helpful ex-con trying to help Sherry stay clean.  I suppose there's a darker side to that story if you really care to see it, but I'm too pleased to see Trejo getting different kind of work, and being good at it, too.I also admire how economical the screenplay is.  The film is only 96 minutes long, but it feels neither too short nor too long.  Every scene serves a solid purpose, and none of them are squandered.  You don't get that in very many movies.  Usually even the best movies have scenes that could easily have been cut.Highly recommended for anyone who likes movies about character.(One final note.  I'm interested in how this movie serves as a darker sort of companion piece to one of 2006's biggest moneymakers, ""The Pursuit of Happyness.""  Both movies are about troubled single parents who spend the entire movie on a nearly Homeric quest to achieve a specific goal.  It would make for an interesting double feature, and I'm intrigued by the fact that two of the year's most-lauded performances come from such thematically similar movies.)",4,a different kind of suspense,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,2762,"['halfway', 'watching', 'fine', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'tense', 'hell', 'Tension', 'course', 'emotional', 'investment', 'emotional', 'investment', 'implies', 'movie', 'really', 'clicking.The', 'movie', 'recovering', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'parole', 'prison', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'attempts', 'get', 'know', 'daughter', 'had', 'leave', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'rest', 'plot', 'say', 'Sherry', 'struggles', 'had', 'edge', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'classifying', 'movie', 'suspense', 'film', 'found', 'absolute', 'suspense', 'feeling', 'practically', 'scene', 'things', 'were', 'verge', 'going', 'wrong', 'BADLY', 'wrong', 'found', 'was', 'feeling', 'more', 'suspense', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'poor', 'Sherry', 'can', 'remember', 'feeling', 'movies', 'while.Needless', 'say', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Shr', 'really', 'pretty', 'great', 'really', 'character', 'what', 'doing', 'often', 'less', 'Acting', 'well', ""'re"", 'just', 'watching', 'real', 'person', 'people', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'kind', 'performance', 'rest', 'pretty', 'sublime', 'here', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'DAMN', 'hot', 'Call', 'like', 'true', 'costume', 'designer', 'movie', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'idea', 'Gyllenhall', 'AT', 'NO', 'POINT', 'wear', 'bra', 'ought', 'be', 'given', 'sort', 'special', 'Oscar', 'Sexist', 'rant', 'now', 'Seriously', 'though', 'HOT', 'was', 'also', 'delighted', 'find', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'playing', 'normal', 'character', 'movie', 'usually', 'playing', 'criminal', 'other', 'type', 'thug', 'here', 'just', 'charming', 'helpful', 'ex-con', 'trying', 'help', 'Sherry', 'stay', 'clean', 'suppose', 'darker', 'side', 'story', 'really', 'care', 'see', ""'m"", 'too', 'pleased', 'see', 'Trejo', 'getting', 'different', 'kind', 'work', 'being', 'good', 'also', 'admire', 'how', 'economical', 'screenplay', 'film', 'only', '96', 'minutes', 'long', 'too', 'short', 'too', 'long', 'Every', 'scene', 'solid', 'purpose', 'none', 'are', 'squandered', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'many', 'movies', 'Usually', 'even', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'scenes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cut.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'character', 'One', 'final', 'note', ""'m"", 'interested', 'how', 'movie', 'darker', 'sort', 'companion', 'piece', 'one', '2006', 'biggest', 'moneymakers', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'movies', 'are', 'troubled', 'single', 'parents', 'who', 'spend', 'entire', 'movie', 'nearly', 'Homeric', 'quest', 'achieve', 'specific', 'goal', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'double', 'feature', ""'m"", 'intrigued', 'fact', 'two', 'year', 'most-lauded', 'performances', 'come', 'such', 'thematically', 'similar', 'movies']",Sherrybaby

She succumbs to whatever it is, sex, heroin, alcohol, nicotine...love.  She is impulsive and she flies off the handle easily.  She doesn't know that she behaves badly.  She doesn't know that is not the way to dress.  Or perhaps she does.  She needs to be gratified, and so probably that is why she dresses that way.She was sexually abused by her father who loved her.  But who does she love?  She desperately wants her daughter to love her.  Do you love me? she asks.  Say, ""I love you, Mommie.""  The child does, but suddenly--and this is the denouement of the movie--Sherry realizes that there is some question about whether the child should love her.  Yes, she has the stretch marks, but really does she deserve the title of ""mother""?  And does she love herself?  Probably not, and maybe that is her biggest problem.  It is said that women who are always seeking sex are really seeking a love that they cannot find.  One always feels that if only they would pick the right man.  But this is an illusion.  There is no right man until she is the right woman.Maggie Gyllenhaal does an outstanding job of becoming this woman who is lost in this world without a compass as to how she should behave and why, who is lost to everything but her immediate feelings.  She is a child emotionally and she cannot understand why it is that life is so hard for her and why the world is so cruel.This is a masterful portrait of a kind of person that is part of humanity.  A good person at heart, not someone who would do others deliberate harm, but a person who is blind to who she is and to how others see her.  Into what world does she belong? is a question I kept asking myself.  I don't know the answer.Laurie Collyer's direction is exquisite.  The players and especially the little girl are wonderfully directed.  Everything is like the people next door without a hint of anything phony.  The contemporary Garden State setting is real and the details and the atmosphere are as genuine as the New Jersey Turnpike.  And the ending surprises.  It is perfect but in a way that I suspect most viewers will not be able to predict.  I know it surprised me.My hat is off to Laurie Collyer and Maggie Gyllenhaal.

1025955,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000JBXXYK,Ed Uyeshima,"[17, 18]","Maggie Gyllenhaal emerges as an undeniably powerful actress in the title role of this low-budget 2006 indie. Rather than providing her usual scene-stealing turn, she gets to convey the nuances of a full-blown character by delivering an astonishing range of emotion as a struggling ex-convict. The film reminds me quite a bit of Ulu Grosbard's overlooked 1978 ""Straight Time"" in which Dustin Hoffman plays a paroled ex-burglar who cannot shake his former life.  Both provide incisive looks into the hardscrabble existence of people trying desperately to reform, but in doing so, the stories become so desultory and the situations start to have a by-the-numbers feeling that the dramatic momentum dissipates toward their inevitable conclusions.Directed and written by Laurie Collyer, the film takes an unflinching look at Sherry Swanson, a former heroin addict just released on parole after three years in prison for robbery. Returning home to New Jersey, she is desperate to stay clean and sober in order to reclaim her young daughter Alexis from her sympathetic brother Bobby and his conflicted wife Lynette. Without drugs, Sherry's addictive behavior manifests itself in cigarettes, alcohol and emboldened sexual acts to get what she needs. Yet, her biggest addiction is her relentless pursuit of an idealized image of herself as a mother, and it is her disconnect with reality that produces the film's most poignant moments. Otherwise, the movie gets increasingly frustrating to watch because Collyer provides only hints of what Sherry brought her to her dilemma. What we see mainly are flashes of short-tempered narcissism when we see people understandably looking to emotionally disengage from her, including her indiscriminate father.There are some surprisingly graphic scenes that show how Sherry uses her shopworn beauty as emotional armor when Collyer could have better used them to underline her melancholy mental state. In the face of these script shortcomings, Gyllenhaal displays enough dexterity to fill in a lot of the blanks, especially when she shows how Sherry starts realizing the depth of her accountability for her problems. Brad William Henke provides solid support as Bobby, as does Bridget Barkan as Lynette, Danny Trejo as a supportive fellow addict, Giancarlo Esposito as Sherry's hardened parole officer, and ebullient little Ryan Simpkins as Alexis. I have to admit I could not wait for the 96-minute movie to be over, but it is worthwhile for Gyllenhaal's courageous work as it is she who holds the film together.

1025957,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000JBXXYK,Grady Harp,"[21, 23]","Laurie Collyer both wrote and directed this very fine little film that examines the world in which addicted people live, even after they have 'paid their debt to society' by being imprisoned.  She does not play to the sympathy of the audience: she rather empathizes with one woman's plight in her struggle to gain control of a life she has never been able to successfully assemble.Sherry Swanson (a brilliant tour de force by Maggie Gyllenhaal) has been in prison for robbery, drug possession and heroin addiction for several years and as the film opens she is released to her hometown in New Jersey where she is assigned a parole officer (Giancarlo Esposito) and a 'safe haven' home.  She longs to see her five-year-old daughter Alexis (Ryan Simpkins) whom she barely knows and who has been living with her brotherBobby (the excellent Brad William Henke) and his wife Lynette (Bridget Barkan). After encountering much prejudice and abuse heaped on ex-cons looking for work, Sherry manages to find a job working with kids and tries desperately to re-connect with Alexis but is rebuffed by Lynette and warned by Bobby that should she bring drugs in the house he will send her back to prison.Sherry stumbles through her out-of-prison existence, connecting with old friends at an AA meeting, having a fling with her old flame Dean (Danny Trejo), attending a birthday party for Alexis given at her parents home where her father (Sam Bottoms) comforts her in a sexually intrusive way, and struggling with her roommates until she moves out on her own.  She aches from not belonging, from the fact that her life on the 'outside' is as much a prison as on the 'inside', and she returns to drugs.  Given an ultimatum by her parole officer she finally thinks she can put her life back together, but a planned outing with daughter Alexis forces Sherry to face the fact that she is not capable of the skills of mothering and she is able finally to ask for help from her caring brother.Maggie Gyllenhaal is Sherry with every  fiber of her being. It is a performance worthy of top honors.  The beauty of the film is the fact that it does not opt for Hollywood happy endings: it merely stops with many questions unanswered - as is the case in life with people who suffer the agonies of addiction.  It is beautifully acted and filmed and it deserves the attention of not only lovers of fine film, but also people who want to try to understand the horrors of drug addiction in a society unprepared to cope with it.

1025958,AAIL33CYCT47J,B000JBXXYK,Gregory Baird,"[10, 11]","I'll start with a warning: ""Sherrybaby"" is a very downbeat, gloomy movie.  Sherry Swanson, played brilliantly by Maggie Gyllenhaal, has had a very depressing life and the movie's bare-bones look at her attempts to reform and become a good mother to her daughter hits some abysmal lows in the way she continues to be degraded by the harsh judgments of the world and, predominantly, herself.  It's just not a feel good movie, so anyone looking for frivolity or endless repeat viewing had best look elsewhere.Now, having gotten that out of the way, I want to implore you to watch ""Sherrybaby"" anyway, because while the movie isn't bouncy fun it is an unflinchingly honest and devastating portrait of a young woman in crisis.  Sherry makes some bad choices, sure, but thanks to Gyllenhaal you see the extent of the damage that has been done to her, and you find yourself on the edge of your seat because you desperately want her to be all right in the end.  To say that Sherry's life hasn't gone according to plan would be an egregious understatement.  By sixteen she was performing for seedy older men for money under the moniker 'Lolita,' hooked on heroin, and it is implied that she was sexually molested by her father.  Most of her old acquaintances are either dead of overdoses or in jail, and she has no idea where her daughter's father is -- assuming he's still alive, that is.  In Gyllenhaal's blank stare you can feel every wound and imagine every dream that has been dashed forever in Sherry's bleak existence, and in her prematurely world-weary creases the fear that she will never get the normal life she so desperately craves becomes palpable.  It is a performance that is at once bold and understated, and the fact that Gyllenhaal failed to get nominated for an Academy Award seems to be the final nail in the coffin of that institution's ability to reward such daring indie performances as this one.  It's a triumph so lived-in that you can almost smell the stale aroma of cigarettes following around her.  The supporting players are also very good, but this is Gyllenhaal's vehicle, and it is her work that makes the film work so well.And what a film!  Sherry's fumbling attempts at motherhood and sobriety don't tug at your heartstrings so much as rip them out and scrape them across the floor, but rarely does that experience feel so exhilarating as it does here.  ""Sherrybaby"" is not a movie for the faint of heart, but it is a movie for anyone who has a heart -- and it will stay with you long after the final reel.

1025961,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,B000JBXXYK,Jessica Lux,"[3, 4]","Sherrybaby is the story about starting life over when you've hit rock bottom.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Sherry, a 22 year-old ex-junkie on parole with a sincere desire to turn her life around and regain custody of her 5 year-old daughter.  While Sherry was in jail, her daughter lived with Sherry's brother and his wife, and the sister-in-law now has an iron resolve about keeping the child and not returning her to the flaky ex-con mother.Actor Maggie Gyllenhaal expertly captures the spirit of a woman who desires change, and desperately wants to be a mother, but for whom motherhood and stability do not come naturally.  The climax of the move features her attempt on a day on the town with her daughter, a disaster of a day despite all of Sherry's best efforts.  Throughout the movie, Sherry battles addiction, past demons, and the hard luck reality that not many employers or professionals want to take a chance on an ex-con.  Since she's known nothing else, Sherry often turns to using her body to get what she wants in the ""real world.""Gyllenhall's outstanding performance is complimented by that of Danny Trejo as a tough, tattoo-ed recovering addict who provides Sherry with stability and wisdom.  Actor Trejo's appearance is that of an ex-con (which he is in real life) tough guy who knows a bit about how the world works, but in this role, he plays a spiritual man with a soft, kind resolve under his tough exterior.  His character is a guardian angel in an unlikely disguise.Sherrybaby proves once again that Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of the most outstanding actors of her generation, and gives Trejo a chance to shine in a leading role.

Her brother and his wife have spent the last three years taking care of her daughter, and she desperately wants to be a part of her daughter's life again. Sherry, though, doesn't seem to have ever learned social graces, and this extends not only to offering favors to the director of her halfway house, but also in her explanation to her five-year-old daughter as to why she was gone so long. She tells her daughter, rather inappropriately, that she stole money from people to buy drugs.When we meet Sherry's alcoholic father, we understand her inability to cope, although it's not terribly surprising. What surprised me was that we learned that her brother was aware of whatever relationship the two of them had and didn't talk to Sherry about it.

1025963,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000JBXXYK,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[1, 3]","The intelligent, engaging ""Sherrybaby"" probably reveals more about the people who watch it than it ultimately does about its own characters.  As seen in many of these reviews, some viewers will empathize with Sherry, feeling bad that her kid is essentially being taken from her by her brother and his wife.  Others will recognize and appreciate the sacrifice Sherry's brother and his wife are doing in raising a little girl who'd otherwise be subject to an unstable mother.I related to both views.  Sherry has a good heart and is a strong woman in many ways, but she's in a damaged emotional state that makes it all too easy for her to weaken and turn again to drugs.  Sherry's brother Bobby and his wife just want Sherry's daughter to have a decent upbringing, but they can often be needlessly insensitive when discussing the little girl with her mother.  In other words, these characters are genuinely complex and make for an interesting, thoughtful film.  But you'll have to be open to a film that doesn't offer easy answers.Myself, I saw a ray of hope at the end for these characters' futures.  In the unlikely event that there's a ""Sherrybaby II"" (for better or worse, small, interesting art house movies generally don't get sequels), I like to think that we'd see that these characters had eventually reached a situation or accommodation among themselves where everyone has gained a little peace and a sense of being fairly treated.""Sherrybaby"" features an anamorphic widescreen image that looks great on a flatscreen TV, and the movie sounds great, too.

1025970,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B000JBXXYK,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[15, 20]","Out of prison, clean at last, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) dreams of being a mother to daughter Alexis, who has spent the last three years with her brother and sister-in-law. Sherry was arrested on drug possession charges, her drug of choice being heroine.  Now she confronts her demons in the form of family....sister-in-law Lynnette has bonded with the young girl, and has postponed her own family to raise her.  How can Lynnette reconcile giving up her care to the fragile, emotionally shattered Sherry?Moving from man to man and trying to erase her memories of life with her own father, Sherry is a selfish and childish shell of what she might have been, who can only relate to men on the basis of her sexuality.  She couples with the manager of a half-way house, finds a troubled partner from her days as a stripper, and tries to seduce her parole officer (Giancarlo Esposito in a wonderfully understated role on the big screen...you remember his intensity from television's ""Homicide"").  A meeting with her father results in a reinforcement of this childlike behavior.  The film is a frank and seamless report of Sherry's encounters with life, bouncing off the bad times without learning from them and continuing on in a subtle dance of drifting from place to place, of living with life without coping or facing down your own issues.The encounters that Sherry wants the most, the times she gets to be with Alexis, don't go well; Alexis is uncomfortable, a little defiant, afraid.  As Sherry begins to realize that what she hoped for, what she left her addiction for, what she focused on in prison...the relationship with her daughter is almost impossible to repair, she begins the slow spiral downhill of giving up on herself.  Cheap and brassy, surrounded by a gritty, realistic portrayal of the surroundings of the worst of New Jersey, Maggie Gyllenhaal as a bottle blonde is incredibly believable as Sherry.  You sense her vulnerability, you are drawn to her charisma, but ultimately, you are repulsed by her behavior and afraid to believe in her.  She doesn't believe in herself, after all.  The breathless waiting you have for Sherry to give up on herself, to return to her destructive self, to feed her demons, creates suspense in the film.Laurie Collyer directs a character study of Gyllenhaal's challenge with real life and backs it up with tight, focused camera shots of Sherry from every angle, revealing her inner thoughts, with the contrast of middle class New Jersey and the ugly, dirty streets available to ex-cons.  She sets the mood with the music and tries hard to present Sherry's tale as a feature film; but it disintegrates into more of a documentary as Collyer lets the tale meander and repeat itself through Sherry's ups and downs - there is no clarity to the point that is being made.  The film becomes a showcase for the central performance.Gyllenhaal, who opened my eyes with her work in ""The Secretary"", chose the role in character with what she consistently presents on the screen - her ability to inhabit the character.  Contrary to most actresses of her generation, Gyllenhaal is not afraid to make unique choices and to build her reputation as an actress to be reckoned with.  In  ""Sherrybaby"", a film that was less than a critical success, that went almost directly to video, she shows that she can carry a film, and doubtless will reap the rewards of better and better scripts in upcoming years.  She is marvelous here.The film is less so, but still worth a view.  Don't buy the DVD for the extras, there are none - it is a stripped down version designed to allow the public to experience Gyllehaal's performance, ashamedly at award season.",4,Maggie Gyllenhaal shines in Sherrybaby.,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,3684,"['prison', 'clean', 'last', 'Sherry', 'Swanson', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'dreams', 'being', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'Sherry', 'was', 'arrested', 'drug', 'possession', 'charges', 'drug', 'choice', 'being', 'heroine', 'Now', 'demons', 'form', 'family', '.sister-in-law', 'Lynnette', 'bonded', 'young', 'girl', 'postponed', 'own', 'family', 'raise', 'How', 'can', 'Lynnette', 'reconcile', 'giving', 'up', 'care', 'fragile', 'emotionally', 'shattered', 'Sherry', 'Moving', 'man', 'man', 'trying', 'erase', 'memories', 'life', 'own', 'father', 'Sherry', 'selfish', 'childish', 'shell', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'relate', 'men', 'basis', 'sexuality', 'manager', 'half-way', 'house', 'troubled', 'partner', 'days', 'stripper', 'tries', 'seduce', 'parole', 'officer', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'role', 'big', 'screen', 'remember', 'intensity', 'television', 'Homicide', 'meeting', 'father', 'results', 'reinforcement', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'film', 'frank', 'seamless', 'report', 'Sherry', 'encounters', 'life', 'bouncing', 'off', 'bad', 'times', 'learning', 'continuing', 'subtle', 'dance', 'drifting', 'place', 'place', 'living', 'life', 'coping', 'facing', 'down', 'own', 'issues.The', 'encounters', 'Sherry', 'most', 'times', 'be', 'Alexis', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'Alexis', 'uncomfortable', 'little', 'defiant', 'afraid', 'Sherry', 'realize', 'what', 'hoped', 'what', 'left', 'addiction', 'what', 'focused', 'prison', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'almost', 'impossible', 'repair', 'slow', 'spiral', 'downhill', 'giving', 'up', 'Cheap', 'brassy', 'surrounded', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'surroundings', 'worst', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'bottle', 'blonde', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'Sherry', 'sense', 'vulnerability', 'are', 'drawn', 'charisma', 'ultimately', 'are', 'repulsed', 'behavior', 'afraid', 'believe', ""n't"", 'believe', 'breathless', 'waiting', 'have', 'Sherry', 'give', 'up', 'return', 'destructive', 'self', 'feed', 'demons', 'suspense', 'film.Laurie', 'Collyer', 'character', 'study', 'Gyllenhaal', 'challenge', 'real', 'life', 'backs', 'up', 'tight', 'focused', 'camera', 'shots', 'Sherry', 'angle', 'revealing', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'contrast', 'middle', 'class', 'New', 'Jersey', 'ugly', 'dirty', 'streets', 'available', 'ex-cons', 'mood', 'music', 'hard', 'present', 'Sherry', 'tale', 'feature', 'film', 'more', 'documentary', 'Collyer', 'tale', 'meander', 'repeat', 'Sherry', 'ups', 'downs', 'clarity', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'film', 'showcase', 'central', 'performance.Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'opened', 'eyes', 'work', 'Secretary', 'chose', 'role', 'character', 'what', 'consistently', 'screen', 'ability', 'inhabit', 'character', 'Contrary', 'most', 'actresses', 'generation', 'Gyllenhaal', 'not', 'afraid', 'make', 'unique', 'choices', 'build', 'reputation', 'actress', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Sherrybaby', 'film', 'was', 'less', 'critical', 'success', 'went', 'almost', 'directly', 'video', 'can', 'carry', 'film', 'doubtless', 'will', 'reap', 'rewards', 'better', 'better', 'scripts', 'upcoming', 'years', 'marvelous', 'here.The', 'film', 'less', 'so', 'still', 'view', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'none', 'stripped', 'down', 'version', 'designed', 'allow', 'public', 'experience', 'Gyllehaal', 'performance', 'ashamedly', 'award', 'season']",Sherrybaby

1025972,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000JBXXYK,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","(4.5 stars)SherryBaby features a tour de force performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sherry Swanson, a recovering drug addict just released from prison wanting new chances in life and a real relationship with her five year old daughter. The plot moves along at a good pace and the acting was very convincing; I was never bored and unlike some other reviewers I thought the acting by the principle cast was uniformly well done. The cinematography and the choreography show careful forethought and good judgment; and there's excellent character development, too.When the film begins, we see Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) returning home on a bus after being released from prison for possession of drugs and robbery. Sherry desperately wants to contact her brother Bobby (Brad William Henke) and his wife Lynette (Bridget Barkan) who have been taking care of Sherry's very young daughter Alexis (Ryan Simpkins). However, Sherry first checks into a halfway house and a drug rehab plan, there she meets Andy (Rio Hackford) who doesn't exactly mind some time alone with Sherry even though he's the director of the halfway house! Look also for an excellent performance by Michelle Hurst as Dorothy Washington, the matron of the halfway house who settles fights and organizes things; and this gets important when Sherry fights pretty badly with Desi (Sandra Rodr&iacute;guez), another resident of the halfway house.Sherry realizes the halfway house is too rough an environment for her; the stress could cause her to relapse and use drugs. Her brother Bobby and his wife Lynette, who aren't too thrilled to even see her again, decide anyway to let Sherry stay with them a brief while. Sherry also looks for work; she wants to work with kids and she's prepared to do whatever it takes--including romantic favors to a total stranger and countless promises to her parole officer Mr. Hernandez (Giancarlo Esposito) that she'll avoid drugs and be good with the kids.Unfortunately, however, the tension only mounts and other reviewers are right to note that life on the outside is somewhat like a prison in that there are so many social barriers and law enforcement restrictions that could cause trouble for Sherry. Ultimately, Bobby and Lynette throw Sherry out although they pay for her motel room; they just can't deal with her. They themselves cause part of the trouble by telling Sherry's daughter Alexis to call her Sherry instead of ""mommy."" Ouch! Sherry's father also does his share of damage, too.Of course the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Sherry be able to bond with her daughter Alexis and her other family members once again? What about Sherry's job working with kids--how will that play out? Will Sherry be able to stay clean? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!The DVD has the theatrical trailer; I wish we had some commentary or an interview or two but we don't get any of that. That's a disappointment. I'll take off half a star for that!SherryBaby does an excellent job of portraying the struggles of a woman who desperately wants to reenter society after being in jail for drug possession and robbery. The movie shows us that this is far from easy; people in Sherry's position aren't truly free at all even after they are released from jail. They have their personal problems in addition to social barriers and responsibilities to law enforcement officers who may have to monitor them. I highly recommend this film for people interested in these issues. Indeed, anyone who wants a film about life with gritty realism and excellent acting would do well to add this DVD to their collection.",5,gritty realism and excellent acting,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,3615,"['4.5', 'stars', 'SherryBaby', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sherry', 'Swanson', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'just', 'released', 'prison', 'wanting', 'new', 'chances', 'life', 'real', 'relationship', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'acting', 'principle', 'cast', 'was', 'uniformly', 'well', 'done', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'show', 'careful', 'forethought', 'good', 'judgment', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'too.When', 'film', 'see', 'Sherry', 'Swanson', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'returning', 'home', 'bus', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'possession', 'drugs', 'robbery', 'Sherry', 'desperately', 'contact', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'wife', 'Lynette', 'Bridget', 'Barkan', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'care', 'Sherry', 'very', 'young', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'Ryan', 'Simpkins', 'However', 'Sherry', 'first', 'halfway', 'house', 'drug', 'rehab', 'plan', 'Andy', 'Rio', 'Hackford', 'who', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mind', 'time', 'alone', 'Sherry', 'even', 'director', 'halfway', 'house', 'Look', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Michelle', 'Hurst', 'Dorothy', 'Washington', 'matron', 'halfway', 'house', 'who', 'fights', 'organizes', 'things', 'important', 'when', 'Sherry', 'pretty', 'badly', 'Desi', 'Sandra', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'resident', 'halfway', 'house.Sherry', 'halfway', 'house', 'too', 'rough', 'environment', 'stress', 'could', 'cause', 'relapse', 'use', 'drugs', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'wife', 'Lynette', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'even', 'see', 'again', 'decide', 'anyway', 'let', 'Sherry', 'stay', 'brief', 'Sherry', 'also', 'work', 'work', 'kids', 'prepared', 'do', 'whatever', 'including', 'romantic', 'favors', 'total', 'stranger', 'countless', 'promises', 'parole', 'officer', 'Mr.', 'Hernandez', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', ""'ll"", 'avoid', 'drugs', 'be', 'good', 'kids.Unfortunately', 'however', 'tension', 'only', 'mounts', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'right', 'note', 'life', 'outside', 'somewhat', 'prison', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'social', 'barriers', 'law', 'enforcement', 'restrictions', 'could', 'cause', 'trouble', 'Sherry', 'Ultimately', 'Bobby', 'Lynette', 'throw', 'Sherry', 'out', 'pay', 'motel', 'room', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'cause', 'part', 'trouble', 'telling', 'Sherry', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'call', 'Sherry', 'instead', 'mommy', 'Ouch', 'Sherry', 'father', 'also', 'share', 'damage', 'too.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'Will', 'Sherry', 'be', 'able', 'bond', 'daughter', 'Alexis', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'once', 'again', 'What', 'Sherry', 'job', 'working', 'kids', 'how', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'Will', 'Sherry', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'clean', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'wish', 'had', 'commentary', 'interview', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'disappointment', ""'ll"", 'take', 'off', 'star', 'SherryBaby', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'struggles', 'woman', 'who', 'desperately', 'reenter', 'society', 'being', 'jail', 'drug', 'possession', 'robbery', 'movie', 'far', 'easy', 'people', 'Sherry', 'position', 'are', ""n't"", 'truly', 'free', 'even', 'are', 'released', 'jail', 'have', 'personal', 'problems', 'addition', 'social', 'barriers', 'responsibilities', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'monitor', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'issues', 'Indeed', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'life', 'gritty', 'realism', 'excellent', 'acting', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection']",Sherrybaby

Tragically that same friend had passed away at the age of 27 last year (May 2011) of a heroin overdose. To this day we're not sure if it was intentional or accidental. Watching this film again the other night reminded me how much it hits close to home - in more ways than one. 'Sherrybaby' tells what lies in store for a woman (Gyllenhall, in an Oscar-worthy performance) who has fallen into the abyss of hard drugs, prison, loss of her child and is trying to return within a system that seems to be hell bent on controlling every aspect of her life (led by the phenomenal Giancarlo Esposito, a hardassed parole officer). Seeing behind her habit and what drove Sherry to her irresponsible behaviors displayed, it could be difficult to watch the destructive and depressing scenes that are shown. Danny Trejo appears as well, perfectly cast as Sherry's on-again/off-again lover and former addict.

Frustrated that her brother (Brad William Henke) and sister-in-law have become parents to her daughter and quickly reminded of the family problems that scarred her in the past, Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) finds freedom more difficult than imprisonment. Harassed by a hardened parole officer (Giancarlo Esposito) and helped by one newfound friend (Danny Trejo), Sherry tries to cope in the only ways she can -which have never been especially successful.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an actress who banishes her own ego from her roles, and that's just what is required to embody a woman like Sherry Swanson. She's fragile and desperate but must make do with limited emotional resources and overwhelming emotional needs that can only be satiated temporarily by drugs -the thing that will land her right back in prison. Gyllenhaal makes Sherry's pain visible, so that we sympathize with her deeply while rebuking her selfishness. Coincidentally, Maggie Cheung's portrayal of another drug-addicted mother struggling to reclaim her child in ""Clean"" is also among 2007's most memorable performances. Both films are brilliant portraits of fragility and frustration.

ZALESKI ""m.zaleski""","[3, 5]","Looking at the accolades on the DVD box, I am going tohave to take a minority view here and go with 3 stars,a lukewarm recommendation with some cautionary thoughts.Yes, the acting is first rate.  The film is not boringand it is certainly well paced.But as I watched this film, I had two big reservations.First, it is relentlessly depressing.  What little signof ""hope"" there is for Sherry at the end is very littleand pretty late considering the completely messed upperson she is.  I did not see anything in her post releasebehavior to indicate a genuine desire to reform.  Indeed,her use of sex to get what she wants shows just how she stillwants the quick fix to everything.  She goes back to drugsand drinking pretty quickly.  She has anger management issues,impulse control problems, and a sick need to be the center ofattention.  Put bluntly, I did not see anything here to suggestthat she was anywhere near being in a position to deserve to bepart of her daughter's life.  (Despite what events may haveled her down her path.)Second, this film seemed really fast and loose withwhat I would think is acceptable reality.1. Within days of her release she engages in sex acts withthe manager of her halfway house and a rather lecherous jobplacement officer.  It seems more than a little unlikely thatshe would meet TWO men who would risk their jobs (and health)to have sexual relations with this woman.2. As a convicted felon, I do not think she would have beeneligible for any position working with children.3. I think her interaction with the parole department is notvery believable.  Either she would have, as a low level threat,been ""lost in the system"" or she would have been violated andsent back to jail for her numerous transgressions (fighting inthe halfway house, moving around without permission, drugs, etc).4. As a convicted felon and single parent, she would almostcertainly have lost custody of her child and minimally, I wouldexpect DYFS to have an interest in her interaction with the childafter her parole.The film left me with the impression her family had little orno contact with her during her incarceration.  And now that sheis out, they wish she would just go away.This film is a work of fiction, but I bet there are many familieswho face a very similar situation in real life.  For those people,watching this film would probably be torture.For the rest of the world, an okay film, not very uplifting, andI believe just a little too unrealistic in portraying the worldSherry would encounter.One other side note.

Once she's released, she contacts her brother, Bobby, who has been keeping her child (Alexis) for her while she's been in the clink. The movie then follows Sherry as she tries to stay clean and put her life back together post-prison.Gyllenhaal is AMAZING in this film. Really amazing.

She dominates her scenes with a realistic honesty that you can only admire.  My ONLY complaint is the films pacing.

In the first role where she is asked to carry an entire movie, Maggie displays impressive acting chops...( and nice gams, too.)Sherry Swanson (Gyllenhaal) is first seen as she returns to her hometown area, on parole from prison.  She is a dirty sweet, tough-on-the-outside girl who flaunts a cool, but thin veneer of confidence.  She also smokes cigarettes with more moxie than any movie blonde since Gena Rowlands.  As she checks into the halfway house, she takes no guff from the girls, and immediately begins using her sexuality on men to get what she wants. Her single-minded goal is to reunite with her very young daughter, Lexie,and  take custody of her again.  To do that, she has to fight through the barrier of her brother and his wife, who have cared for Lexie while Sherry was in prison.When she finally reaches her brother Bobby's home, Gyllenhaal's character begins to reveal her true self.  Her look, which before was predominantly one of blankness, dissolves into expressions of repressed anger, sadness, and need.  Gyllenhaal's expressive face registers every emotional state without having to resort to overacting.When her father arrives at Bobby's house, Sherry shows that beneath it all, she is more of a needy child than Lexie.  Later on, the reasons for her arrested development are made obvious, when her father comforts her in a very inappropriate manner.  As Sherry undergoes a transition from blonde to brunette, her facade of toughness begins to dissolve.  Sherry begins to crumble.  In the end, she finally admits that she's not ready to raise her daughter, and belatedly acknowledges her brother's role as caretaker.Maggie Gyllenhaal's expertly shaded performance is the primary reason to see this movie.  But, beyond that the movie doesn't have that many strong points. It is good at showing the way that social workers interact with offenders--sometimes with toughness, sometimes with a coziness that borders on impropriety.""Sherrybaby"" is a movie with limited ambitions.  It amounts to a good, but not great ""Indie"".

She is amazing at getting you to care about a burned out self-destructive, selfish, drug addict.The script leaves a lot to be desired.  Somewhere I read that the writer based the film on the life of friend of hers.  So it is a stunning portrait of this person, be she fictional or real.  However, as a film, the structure is weak.  We see Sherry as she encounters problem after problem and I had the feeling that disaster was around the corner at every moment. And it usually was. There were a few happy moments when she worked with kids at a daycare center, but most of the action was about pain and trouble.  Too much of this makes for a one-dimensional film.At one point, near the end of the film, we see an encounter with her father when his comforting hug turns sexual which I guess is supposed to account for how Sherry became a drug addict in the first place.  As much as I appreciate the writer not hitting us over the head with this bit of information, it is glossed over so casually that it left me wondering if that was really it?  Surely she seems addicted to sex as well as drugs. Well, the girl really is a mess.  And yet I kept pulling for her.Somehow this seems closer to a documentary of what a person goes through upon emerging from prison, than a piece of fiction.  It is hard to watch and I think a lot of people might have a hard time with it.  Gyllenhaal's beauty and charm carry the show.  She is a fearless actress and for that I give the movie four stars.

-- the film is boring when shes in scenes--every one else in the movie is very believable-- esp compared to her- glueinhall acts generalities--neglects to create a character-- shes one of these so called actresses who is just a hottie that tasteless producer directors who also have minimal talent (?) want to work w--you wont ever see this gluein hall in anything substantial-- you will never see her create a character---she can act natural enough in front of a camera- shes only slightly self conscious---a lot of actors of this generation think acting is  just acting natural -- because they are not capable of anything more--  furthermore-this is a movie w no real plot---the prurient meaningless sex may keep the eyes of the dullards who expect nothing out of a movie interested i guess--- nothing real or creative goes on here- another emporers new clothes--  an embarassing paucity of riches here- the scene where glue in hall sings off key at the dinner table-- supposed to be poignant telling--- its just annoying---- when she slams the door at the end of that scene--- its a rich example of this actress who can curse and slam a door-- but w no character having been created-- its just meaningless---the reason why we have never seen betty davis meryl streep hepburn---or other actresses nude is not only because of standards imposed by themor others-- its because they were too busy acting  & creating a character involved in compelling stories---and want that shown !! brando said the key to film acting is not blinking-- the eyes are the windows to the soul ! in a better movie for example nicholson and ann margaret lets say -- these were compelling characters first---- not just hot bodies---another great nicholoson movie where hes got an actress around his waist--- doing it and banging into walls--etc--- that was compelling !! but this nonsense is disgusting not because of the gratuitous sex--but because of whats missing besides the sex and prurience--- its shocking to see the characters father molest her as she cries in his arms-its mildly interesting watching a bad actresss doing drugs and all the other pathetic things going on here-- but we have little sympathy for her-- due to her not makling the character real enough---stars usually insist on their being shot from the front in scenes--so we can see their work !!!!!!!!! she had no work to show so we see her eyes-- blank and dead anyway-- for only fleeting moments-- in a movie where shes in almost every scene !! i know a druggies eyes are supposed to look dead sometimes i guess-- but an actress playing her has to give more to keep us interested-- theres a new surreal tv show on now-- where we see real drug addicts acting badly-- and the last one i saw -- a young girl -obv on drugs-- was so much more compelling to watch than poor maggie here---if maggie was doing any realwork here wouldnt the myriad scenes w her have been shot so we could see her eys and face !  and one more thing-- i learned in college-- that drama involves a character changing somehow--- since this character stays the same throughout -- theres no real drama going on anyway---- we see her more clearly in each scene as the spoiled screwed up white trash sexually abused mess she was in the first scene---supposed to see it anyway----mediocre movie-- acted better by everyone but the lead---sad indeed !,1,sad really sad,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,3870,"['what', 'do', 'w', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'act', '-shoot', 'isnt', 'much', 'anything', 'going', 'face', 'eyes', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'resort', 'apparently', 'shooting', 'film', 'way', 'check', 'out', 'yerself', 'most', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'way-we', 'see', 'hair', 'not', 'eyes', '-not', 'face', 'why-', 'nothings', 'going', 'w', 'actress', '-shes', 'cute', 'shes', 'sexy', 'see', 'nude', 'shot', 'shot', 'cleavage', 'legs', 'ok', 'acting', 'film', 'boring', 'when', 'shes', 'scenes', 'one', 'else', 'movie', 'very', 'believable', 'esp', 'compared', 'her-', 'glueinhall', 'generalities', 'neglects', 'create', 'character', 'one', 'so', 'called', 'actresses', 'who', 'just', 'hottie', 'tasteless', 'producer', 'directors', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'minimal', 'talent', 'want', 'work', 'w', 'wont', 'ever', 'see', 'gluein', 'hall', 'anything', 'substantial', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'create', 'character', 'can', 'act', 'natural', 'enough', 'front', 'camera-', 'shes', 'only', 'slightly', 'self', 'conscious', '-a', 'lot', 'actors', 'generation', 'think', 'acting', 'just', 'acting', 'natural', 'are', 'not', 'capable', 'anything', 'more', 'furthermore-this', 'movie', 'w', 'real', 'plot', '-the', 'prurient', 'meaningless', 'sex', 'may', 'keep', 'eyes', 'dullards', 'who', 'expect', 'nothing', 'movie', 'interested', 'i', 'guess', 'nothing', 'real', 'creative', 'here-', 'new', 'clothes', 'embarassing', 'paucity', 'riches', 'here-', 'scene', 'where', 'glue', 'hall', 'sings', 'key', 'dinner', 'table', 'supposed', 'be', 'poignant', 'telling', 'just', 'annoying', 'when', 'slams', 'door', 'end', 'scene', 'rich', 'example', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'curse', 'slam', 'door', 'w', 'character', 'having', 'been', 'created', 'just', 'meaningless', '-the', 'reason', 'why', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'betty', 'davis', 'meryl', 'streep', 'hepburn', 'other', 'actresses', 'nude', 'not', 'only', 'standards', 'imposed', 'themor', 'others', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'acting', 'creating', 'character', 'involved', 'compelling', 'stories', '-and', 'want', 'shown', 'brando', 'said', 'key', 'film', 'acting', 'not', 'blinking', 'eyes', 'are', 'windows', 'soul', 'better', 'movie', 'example', 'nicholson', 'ann', 'margaret', 'lets', 'say', 'were', 'compelling', 'characters', 'first', 'not', 'just', 'hot', 'bodies', '-another', 'great', 'nicholoson', 'movie', 'where', 'hes', 'got', 'actress', 'waist', 'doing', 'banging', 'walls', 'etc', 'was', 'compelling', 'nonsense', 'disgusting', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'whats', 'missing', 'sex', 'prurience', 'shocking', 'see', 'characters', 'father', 'molest', 'arms-its', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'watching', 'bad', 'actresss', 'doing', 'drugs', 'other', 'pathetic', 'things', 'going', 'here', 'have', 'little', 'sympathy', 'due', 'not', 'makling', 'character', 'real', 'enough', '-stars', 'usually', 'insist', 'being', 'shot', 'front', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'work', 'had', 'work', 'show', 'so', 'see', 'eyes', 'blank', 'dead', 'anyway', 'only', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'movie', 'where', 'shes', 'almost', 'scene', 'i', 'know', 'druggies', 'eyes', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'dead', 'sometimes', 'i', 'guess', 'actress', 'playing', 'give', 'more', 'keep', 'interested', 'new', 'surreal', 'tv', 'show', 'now', 'where', 'see', 'real', 'drug', 'addicts', 'acting', 'badly', 'last', 'one', 'i', 'saw', 'young', 'girl', '-obv', 'drugs', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'watch', 'poor', 'maggie', 'here', '-if', 'maggie', 'was', 'doing', 'realwork', 'here', 'myriad', 'scenes', 'w', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'could', 'see', 'eys', 'face', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'i', 'learned', 'college', 'drama', 'character', 'changing', 'somehow', 'character', 'same', 'real', 'drama', 'going', 'anyway', 'see', 'more', 'clearly', 'scene', 'spoiled', 'screwed', 'up', 'white', 'trash', 'sexually', 'abused', 'mess', 'was', 'first', 'scene', '-supposed', 'see', 'anyway', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'acted', 'better', 'everyone', 'lead', '-sad', 'indeed']",Sherrybaby

Her child is frightened of her with good reason, and she has no idea how to re-build a fundamental relationship that she has ruined by her own failures and compulsions.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","****1/2Rarely have I seen a performer more completely inhabit a role than Maggie Gyllenhaal does in ""Sherrybaby,"" an exquisitely realized drama that hits nary a single false note en route to its heartrending climax.Sherry Swanson is a recovering heroin addict who has, as she herself puts it, ""made all the wrong choices in life.""  Now out on parole and living in a halfway house in Northern New Jersey, Sherry finally has the chance to make things right both in her own life and with the young daughter she was forced to give up to her brother and sister-in-law when she went into rehab and prison.  Sherry is a survivor, but one whose hold on life is often a precarious and tenuous one even at the best of times - and these are clearly not the best of times.The beautiful thing about ""Sherrybaby"" is how, in her first full-length fictional film, writer/director Laurie Collyer allows the drama to unfold naturally, never pushing the material in any particular direction just to make a point.  Indeed, there is nothing forced or contrived about the narrative at all.  Displaying remarkable confidence as both a filmmaker and a storyteller - and evincing a strong feeling for the rhythms of everyday life - Collyer never allows the movie to slip over into the realm of melodrama despite endless opportunities to do so.  As a director, she's smart enough to know what a great thing she has in Gyllenhaal, and thus she allows the actress full rein in developing the character.  Every action, every movement, every facial expression on the part of the actress feels absolutely authentic to the person Sherry is.  Like any living, breathing, fully developed character, Sherry is a walking mass of contradictions.  Feisty, hardnosed and quick-to-anger as she can be at times, she also possesses a tenderness and vulnerability that make us believe she can truly change.  And Gyllenhaal captures all those moods and contradictions perfectly without ever once veering into overstatement or scenery-chewing histrionics.Although I don't think Gyllenhaal is ever off the screen for a single moment in the film, her tour de force performance is not the only one worth taking note of here.  There is also exceptional work by Brad William Henke, Bridget Barkin, Danny Trejo, Sam Bottoms, Giancarlo Esposito, and, above all, Ryan Simpkins, who, at the tender age of seven, is already a powerhouse of acting talent as Sherry's beloved daughter, Alexis.Naturalism in both performance and atmosphere is what makes ""Sherrybaby"" such a compelling and convincing movie-watching experience.  The film has the rare power to draw viewers into its own private world and to make them an integral part of the characters' lives.""Sherrybaby,"" in addition to being one of the best movies of 2006 in its own right, will be forever remembered as a showcase for one of the finest pieces of acting ever put on the screen.",4,mesmerizing Gyllenhaal performance,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,2887,"['****1/2Rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'performer', 'more', 'completely', 'inhabit', 'role', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sherrybaby', 'exquisitely', 'realized', 'drama', 'single', 'false', 'note', 'route', 'heartrending', 'climax.Sherry', 'Swanson', 'recovering', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'made', 'wrong', 'choices', 'life', 'Now', 'parole', 'living', 'halfway', 'house', 'Northern', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Sherry', 'finally', 'chance', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'own', 'life', 'young', 'daughter', 'was', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'brother', 'sister-in-law', 'when', 'went', 'rehab', 'prison', 'Sherry', 'survivor', 'one', 'hold', 'life', 'often', 'precarious', 'tenuous', 'one', 'even', 'best', 'times', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'best', 'times.The', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'Sherrybaby', 'how', 'first', 'full-length', 'fictional', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Laurie', 'Collyer', 'drama', 'unfold', 'naturally', 'never', 'pushing', 'material', 'particular', 'direction', 'just', 'make', 'point', 'Indeed', 'nothing', 'forced', 'contrived', 'narrative', 'Displaying', 'remarkable', 'confidence', 'filmmaker', 'storyteller', 'evincing', 'strong', 'feeling', 'rhythms', 'everyday', 'life', 'Collyer', 'never', 'movie', 'slip', 'over', 'realm', 'melodrama', 'endless', 'opportunities', 'do', 'so', 'director', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'great', 'thing', 'Gyllenhaal', 'thus', 'actress', 'full', 'rein', 'developing', 'character', 'action', 'movement', 'facial', 'expression', 'part', 'actress', 'feels', 'absolutely', 'authentic', 'person', 'Sherry', 'living', 'breathing', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'Sherry', 'walking', 'mass', 'contradictions', 'Feisty', 'hardnosed', 'quick-to-anger', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'also', 'tenderness', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'believe', 'can', 'truly', 'change', 'Gyllenhaal', 'moods', 'contradictions', 'perfectly', 'ever', 'once', 'veering', 'overstatement', 'scenery-chewing', 'histrionics.Although', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Gyllenhaal', 'ever', 'screen', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'tour', 'force', 'performance', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'worth', 'taking', 'note', 'here', 'also', 'exceptional', 'work', 'Brad', 'William', 'Henke', 'Bridget', 'Barkin', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'Ryan', 'Simpkins', 'who', 'tender', 'age', 'seven', 'already', 'powerhouse', 'acting', 'talent', 'Sherry', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'Alexis.Naturalism', 'performance', 'atmosphere', 'what', 'Sherrybaby', 'such', 'compelling', 'convincing', 'movie-watching', 'experience', 'film', 'rare', 'power', 'draw', 'viewers', 'own', 'private', 'world', 'make', 'integral', 'part', 'characters', 'lives', 'Sherrybaby', 'addition', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2006', 'own', 'right', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'remembered', 'showcase', 'one', 'finest', 'pieces', 'acting', 'ever', 'put', 'screen']",Sherrybaby

A recovering drug user, her life is barely on the upswing after hitting bottom, and it's clear that getting a life on track that maybe never was will be a long uphill battle. A diffident brother, a prickly sister-in-law, and a sleazy father make up the dysfunctional family who half-heartedly support her, and her daughter is confused and fearful. Meanwhile, a humorless parole officer and a male friend from a 12-step group provide the sole sources of stability in her life.This is a story that has been told before, and like a similar film, ""Down to the Bone,"" it is told without sentimentality or false hope. While each film ends after its heroine has pulled through a personal crisis, one is left with the very real prospect that further trials and ordeals lie ahead. Hardly any scene in this film allows the tension in its dramatic situations to relax. Even moments of release are filmed and cut in an edgy way that portends disaster.

1025991,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000JBXXYK,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[64, 68]","Unflinchingly absorbing from the first scene to the last, Maggie Gyllenhaal brings a candid, earthy aura to ""Sherrybaby,"" her most impressive acting vehicle up to this point. New to DVD, this gut-wrenching look at an ex-convict's struggle to establish control over her life truly sizzles.Any doubt of Gyllenhaal's abilities is erased only minutes into the film. At the drop of a hat, she makes Sherry Swanson turn from sexual to vulnerable, violent to passive, indifferent to invested, self-assured to insecure. Through it all, she is endearing enough to win over even the most ignorant viewers - the kind who shield their eyes when real-life Sherrys pass them on the street.When we first meet her, she saunters off the bus in Newark, finally home after three years in prison. Contrasting with the business suits that surround her skimpy strawberry blonde get-up, she hollers after a man merely for brushing against her in a hurry to cross the street; the unfolding of a misfit begins.Parole Officer Hernandez is played by the ever-brilliant Giancarlo Esposito, who has a knack for playing deceivingly straightforward authority figures. Appropriately hard-headed in his treatment of Sherry yet sympathetic to her misfortune, his character provides a three-dimensional look at the work of those who look after prisoners post-incarceration.Sherry's heart-rending yet uneasy reunion with her tiny daughter Alexis, portrayed by Ryan Simpkins, sets the stage for the crux of the plot. Having been raised during her mother's incarceration by Sherry's brother Bobby and his wife Lynette, played by Brad William Henke and Bridget Barkan, Alexis is thrown a curveball when her mother suddenly arrives. With an ability to act natural on screen, Simpkins makes Alexis a fully realized character despite her extreme youth, underscoring key plot elements with a pure, uncensored nature par for the course in young children.Fully intent on being a better mother, Sherry collides with her brother and sister-in-law, who closely regulate her interactions with Alexis out of legitimate concern. When she realizes they have instructed Alexis to address her not as ""mommy"" but as simply Sherry, tremendous tension ensues, finally ballooning out of control. Sensing the tension between the three adults, the toddler breaks down in tears, unsure of her position at an age when it is all she has to rely on. The juxtaposition of Sherry's urban life with her family's quiet existence in suburban Mountainside underscores their inevitable differences.Dominant male figures are perhaps overly important to Sherry's definition of herself. Her relationship with her father, wisely underplayed by Sam Bottoms, is more pivotal than first meets the eye, providing context for her conflicted past. She also develops a relationship with recovered addict Dean, played by Danny Trejo, who becomes an unlikely anchor with his wizened, world-weary outlook.It's easy to dismiss Sherry as someone who is raunchy and immoral, but an attentive viewing reveals the reasons behind her complexities.

One scene in particular - during the reunion between Sherry and her father, has little dialogue, but watch the way she tries to get his attention; it's sad and disturbing.  The viewer sees the entire reason why Sherry turned into an ex-con and a drug addict, in one moment.The story itself is very emotional and thought-provoking.  Sherry rolls into her daughter's life after being in prison.  In her absence, her daughter was raised by her brother and his wife, and instead of being grateful, Sherry is angry and belligerent.  The stark realism of the movie tells a sad and painful truth - most of the time, in real life, this is exactly the way things happen.I really enjoyed this movie, even though watching it was a painful and emotionally draining experience.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[11, 12]","This is certainly not the ""feel good"" movie of the year but it is one of the best actibg turns I've seen recently. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has been known mostly for roles as quirky women (""Secretary"" was just one), is the reason to see this tale of a drugged out criminal who is trying to get her life back in order and regain her young daughter. We never learn who the child's father is or the circumstances of the child's birth. Actually all we know is that ""mommy was sent to prison for stealing"". And, though you keep rooting for Sherry (Maggie's title role) to ""make it"", you know it's a tough road.Despite the plot flaws, and missing pieces, you will be unable to take your eyes off of Maggie. (The fact that there are multiple scenes of Gyllenthaal's gorgeous nude body are just ""icing on the cake""). There's lots of expletives here too so it's not a family film.Her acting is stunning!The star rating is based on the fact that the DVD release is devoid of any supplementals except for the film's trailer. There must have been deleted scenes - helping to flesh out Sherry's background - but none are included. And a Director's commentary would have helped too!Maggie was nominated for a Golden Globe - but lost - and should be in the Oscar noms, which will be announced next week.This film is definitely worth watching just to see this performance , which ranks on a par with Charlize Theron's turn in Monster a few years ago.Steve Ramm",4,Maggie Gyllenhaal will hold your attention for the whole 96 minutes!,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,1442,"['certainly', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'actibg', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'been', 'known', 'mostly', 'roles', 'quirky', 'women', 'Secretary', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'tale', 'drugged', 'out', 'criminal', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'order', 'regain', 'young', 'daughter', 'never', 'learn', 'who', 'child', 'father', 'circumstances', 'child', 'birth', 'Actually', 'know', 'mommy', 'was', 'sent', 'prison', 'stealing', 'keep', 'rooting', 'Sherry', 'Maggie', 'title', 'role', 'make', 'know', 'tough', 'road.Despite', 'plot', 'flaws', 'missing', 'pieces', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'take', 'eyes', 'Maggie', 'fact', 'are', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'Gyllenthaal', 'gorgeous', 'nude', 'body', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'lots', 'expletives', 'here', 'too', 'not', 'family', 'film.Her', 'acting', 'stunning', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'fact', 'DVD', 'release', 'devoid', 'supplementals', 'film', 'trailer', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'helping', 'flesh', 'out', 'Sherry', 'background', 'none', 'are', 'included', 'Director', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'too', 'Maggie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'lost', 'should', 'be', 'Oscar', 'noms', 'will', 'be', 'announced', 'week.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'performance', 'par', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'turn', 'Monster', 'few', 'years', 'ago.Steve', 'Ramm']",Sherrybaby

1025997,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B000JBXXYK,Thomas Glebe,"[3, 13]","After seeing this movie uncut on cable, while I am a big fan of Maggie, and while her performance is second to none, overall, this is one of her films I'd rather not see a second time, so I couldn't honestly advise anyone to buy this DVD without checking it out first.  It's a film I'm glad I saw at least once since I am a Maggie fan, but it is really a totally depressing experience on a number of levels throughout, the script needed major rewrites, especially as to believability issues, the ending is all wrong and contradicts the whole movie, and there really was no call to more or less exploit Maggie's beauty here in needlessly graphic sexual encounters and nudity, in way too many such scenes.  She agreed to such to make the film, I suppose, so who am I to judge?  Still, her acting talents are enough to do without the ""soft-porn"" and those several segments only detract from the viewer's finding of some empathy and understanding of her character.The movie, one of many Gyllenhaal has been in these days, is compelling enough to sway one from fast forwarding, but aside from the excessive nudity/sex, there are just too many negatives here for me to imagine anyone actually wanting to repeatedly watch this, let alone buy the DVD which has few extras and seems not to have even put in closed-captions, which is unacceptable in these days.Gyllenhaal's character is interesting, but it's never really background, explained enough with her story starting somewhere in the middle and never really explores the roots of same, except for too subtle and brief references throughout the film, none of which add much to the overall experience.  There are too many unanswered questions all along the way, which could've been easily incorporated into the mix with perhaps some flashback sequences, or at the very least, more exposition which would make our understanding and sympathy for who we're apparently supposed to be pulling for, Sherrybaby, much more rewarding.  An off-screen narration could've easily solved this problem as well, but such is nowhere to be found.On one hand, we are asked to identify with Sherry, and her state of mind, but her behavior contradicts her deepest held wishes, and there are just too many unbelievable characters and situations surrounding her, to make the whole into something the viewer can identify with.  Until the very end, which seems tacked on as a shallow ""happy ending"" but which comes out of nowhere (maybe they ran out of film or the production company out of money to give this a decent finish), Sherry is not only not likeable, but is obviously living in some selfish, drug/alcohol fantasyland, which only serves to hurt her young daughter, even moreso than she already has when we meet up with her.  While the movie deals with her attempted reconciliation and reconnection with her ""baby,"" aside from the little girl's equally powerful performance, surrounding characters all seem quite unlikely and undeveloped, and for a film which attempts to be a slice of ""real"" life, perhaps the makers of this should've spent a little more time developing those ""supporting"" characters.  For most, if not all of them, are dealt short shift here in the writing, and eventually detract from the film's seeming potentials.Hints are given along the way which suggest that Sherry's childhood and early adult experiences led and lead to her self-destructive nature, but it would've been nice to see a more believable and detailed explanation.  This would've obviously necessitated less Maggie screen time, and more from her supporting cast, and made less of her amazing performance, but in this case, it is really needed.  By the end of this movie, which presented some sort of revelation in Maggie's character, both inner and behavior-wise, for the good, it felt unrealistic and was most unsatisfying.I can't help but to think that this would've been so much better with at least just a little bit less sex and nudity, and at least just a little bit more of basic character development.  The film asks us to identify with Sherrybaby but mostly, she is a mess even after being released from prison for silly drug ""law"" reasons, and her prayerful longing to just reconnect with her most loved thing in life, her daughter, would've never happened in the real world we live in.  Let alone the fictional world this film portrays.Any movie in this genre primarily demands as its first and foremost tenet, that we CARE about the main character we're SUPPOSED to care about, but Gyllenhaal's ""Sherry"" never comes close to that.  By the film's soapy, sappy end, that needed quality never really materialized.  At least, this viewer didn't care at the finish whether she ever got close to her daughter or not.  In fact, all I came away from it with was the feeling that she was an unfit ""mommy"" from giving birth to way beyond the phony ending.  All I could empathize with were her psychologically abused daughter, and her brother and his wife, and I would've liked to see a more ""tough love"" solution, and a restraining order till Sherry ever got her act together.Maggie Gyllenhaal is a great actress, and her performance is superb, but she needs to concentrate more on selecting better material, and quality over quantity in the projects she agrees to in the future.  The excessive sex and nudity was also and remains beneath her plain old acting talents at this stage in her career.  Her genuine beauty and amazing ability to brilliantly capture the essence of any character she's ever played, should be enough by now (and hopefully in the future), to garner less exploitive roles, where she doesn't seem to need to shed her clothes without necessity, several times in a film, where doing such seems to eventually damage her overall talents and prospects for better films.  As well as subtract from the audience's feeling of empathy and compassion for whatever character she's playing.  Especially such as Sherrybaby.I didn't like ""Sherry"" from beginning to end, and I find it hard to believe anyone would, given the weak material and her character's past and present abuse of her supposedly loved child.  Again, this would've been a lot better with a lot of rewrites and more careful thought about audience identification as a driving force in overall believability and enjoyment of a film that is just too much of a downer for me to ever recommend actually buying this for anyone except a Maggie Gyllenhaal collector.",2,"Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting is a gem, the film is not...",1191110400,"09 30,

I was concerned why her patrol officer gave her so many breaks in the beginning that lead to her down fall. Did her father always molest her and did that lead to her inevitable down fall? Her use of her body to get a job, housing and drugs tells of the perpetual downward spiro. This along with her inability to resist re-addition tells the terrible tale all should heed. VERY GOOD movie but not a cheerful one and not even a good cry, just an over all feeling of depression. Its message is simply about the hopelessness of drugs and sex that leads to an attitude and conduct she does not really see, that would continue to drag her down.",3,Good acting but a depressing movie of the effects of drugs,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,940,"['acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'wonderfully', 'shaped', 'cleavage', 'close', 'ups', 'behind', 'bending', 'cheapened', 'otherwise', 'good', 'performance', 'negative', 'feelings', 'result', 'hopelessness', 'life', 'only', 'likeable', 'character', 'being', 'brother', 'took', 'while', 'develope', 'was', 'concerned', 'why', 'patrol', 'officer', 'gave', 'so', 'many', 'breaks', 'beginning', 'lead', 'down', 'fall', 'Did', 'father', 'always', 'molest', 'did', 'lead', 'inevitable', 'down', 'fall', 'use', 'body', 'get', 'job', 'housing', 'drugs', 'tells', 'perpetual', 'downward', 'spiro', 'inability', 'resist', 're-addition', 'terrible', 'tale', 'should', 'heed', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'not', 'cheerful', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'cry', 'just', 'feeling', 'depression', 'message', 'simply', 'hopelessness', 'drugs', 'sex', 'attitude', 'conduct', 'not', 'really', 'see', 'would', 'continue', 'drag', 'down']",Sherrybaby

I went out and bought it and I am glad I did. It isn't a great movie and it isn't full of big laughs or big action or CGI or anything like that. It is just an interesting character study of a woman who is down on her luck and who is trying to regroup and trying to change her ways. Maggie Gyllenhaal was perfectly cast as Sherry and she was great in the performance. Danny Trejo was just wonderful and cast against his usual 'heavy' type and shows a lot of range and ability.

1026003,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000JBXXYK,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 4]","The reason I was interested in seeing this movie was the Oscar buzz on Maggie Gyllenhaal. I was certainly hoping she would be getting a more challenging role after Secretary. Sherrybaby is a very heavy duty film to watch, because there's a lot issues involved by Sherry. She gets out of jail, on a probation and intends to reconnect to her little girl. She had to start all over again by finding a job and trying to stay clean at the same time. She was willing to offer her potential employer sexual favors if she gets hired. She goes to AA meetings and still ramdomly has casual sex with strangers while trying to stay away from substances. At this point I am already comparing Maggie's performance and character to Maggie Cheung's Clean, because it's almost like watching a remake of Clean with some additional disturbing issues like father-daughter incestious love and a ton of nudity and sex. Yes, the movie really focused well on the road of recovery in Sherry's life, and about the choices she makes and how she must survive her past in order to make better choices. After viewing this film, I am thinking had the studio pushed for Gyllenhaal, she could've taken the Oscar nomination held by Meryl Streep.",4,Perfect movie to let Gyllenhaal shine!,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1211,"['reason', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'was', 'certainly', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'challenging', 'role', 'Secretary', 'Sherrybaby', 'very', 'heavy', 'duty', 'film', 'watch', 'lot', 'issues', 'involved', 'Sherry', 'jail', 'probation', 'reconnect', 'little', 'girl', 'had', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'finding', 'job', 'trying', 'stay', 'clean', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'willing', 'offer', 'potential', 'employer', 'sexual', 'favors', 'hired', 'AA', 'meetings', 'still', 'ramdomly', 'casual', 'sex', 'strangers', 'trying', 'stay', 'away', 'substances', 'point', 'am', 'already', 'comparing', 'Maggie', 'performance', 'character', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Clean', 'almost', 'watching', 'remake', 'Clean', 'additional', 'disturbing', 'issues', 'father-daughter', 'incestious', 'love', 'ton', 'nudity', 'sex', 'Yes', 'movie', 'really', 'focused', 'well', 'road', 'recovery', 'Sherry', 'life', 'choices', 'how', 'must', 'survive', 'past', 'order', 'make', 'better', 'choices', 'viewing', 'film', 'am', 'thinking', 'had', 'studio', 'pushed', 'Gyllenhaal', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'held', 'Meryl', 'Streep']",Sherrybaby
