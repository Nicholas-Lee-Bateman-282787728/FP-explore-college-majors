Nevertheless, i think the movie does work as intended. It is a pretty disturbing plot, in which all the characters are affected in a negative way by the events, and the frequent unfairness and injustice of life is presented rather accurately.Definitely, not a Hollywood ending. I think it was worth 99 cents for those who like this type of movie, but i would rather not have seen it and studied instead...",3,Flawed but thought provoking...,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,589,"['genre', 'not', 'something', 'i', 'enjoy', 'only', 'watched', 'was', 'cheap', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'studying', 'flaws', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'are', 'definitely', 'Nevertheless', 'i', 'think', 'movie', 'work', 'intended', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'affected', 'negative', 'way', 'events', 'frequent', 'unfairness', 'injustice', 'life', 'presented', 'rather', 'accurately.Definitely', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'think', 'was', 'worth', '99', 'cents', 'who', 'type', 'movie', 'i', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'studied', 'instead']",N/A

The storyline is what stands out not that much action or anything. I think it's great and will hook you early. Picture quality is excellent and sounds great. This movie will stay with you for a long time after it's over. There are some great lines from the movie also. Again, one of the best of it's kind with a great director at the helm. Great acting also by the stars.
