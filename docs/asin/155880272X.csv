178218,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,155880272X,Chris 'raging bill' Burton,"[3, 4]","As ""rseeman"" said, ignore the editorial review. If reviewer Marshall Fine didn't like the film, I can live with that. But the amount of inaccuracies in the review is inexcusable. Firstly, the father, Fred, is played by Alan Arkin, and is not particularly tyrannical, merely cranky. Joseph Bologna plays his brother, Uncle Phil. Secondly, the car isn't brand new - its 9 years old (its a 1954 Cadillac - the film is set in 1963). Thirdly, while one of the younger brothers (played by Arye Gross) is supposed to be goofy, the youngest (played by Patrick Dempsey) clearly is not.As for mediocre moviemaker, Joe Roth also wrote the film. Anyone who has seen will be able to tell you not just how funny it is, but also how well scripted generally. Very often the three brothers talk over each other the way people argue in real life, and the consistency in behavior is also very well done. The characters are also not cliched. It's hard to explain - just watch the film. On top of that, all three actors are very settled in their roles - the look on Marvin's (Daniel Stern) face when he gets angry makes me laugh every time.While the plot could be regarded as quite predictable, there is more going on here than merely a story. There is the study of the relationships between the 3 brothers, not to mention also between them and their dad. Special note also to the music, which fits the period and helps everything go along smoothly.This is much much more than a formulaic comedy.

I couldn't wait to surprise my wife with it. We got all set up, I told her I had a special surprise for her, and pushed ""Play"". Nothing happened for about 15 seconds, then the disc popped back out and a message appeared on the screen; ""Disc Error!"" I tried it again several times and then gave up.

It is a laugh-out-loud movie, if you have ever had siblings that wooped up on each other, you must see this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The three boys are just wonderful, with the youngest played by Grey's Anatomy ""Dr. McDreamy"", (Derrick)Patrick Dempsey! What a talent! Perfect timing, and that grin of his............it's a comedy with a message, heart-warming, and it'll have you screaming with laughter, not to mention, it's a romance, too. The oldest son is played by Daniel J. Stern, from City Slickers and the Home Alone films, he's a hoot, and then the middle son is played by Arye Gross, from the ""Ellen"" TV series. He is the lovable, nervous middle child, certainly picked on by Patrick Demsey's character. The banter between the brothers is totally believable. Arye Gross' character is in love with Annabeth Gish, who was just wonderful in ""Shag: The Movie"" and of course, ""Mystic Pizza"" an early film of hers and Julia Roberts.  Where the DVD is of this excellent film is the big mystery. Don't wait for it, though, grab a copy of the VHS, you will want to watch it over and again. Oh, and the old cars are cool, and the soundtrack is superb! Listen for when the three boys disagree on the lyrics and meaning to the song ""Louie, Louie""!!!

178226,A3TDJYEQCXG1DA,155880272X,Sera69,"[1, 1]","This road movie is something of a lost gem. Still no DVD release? Unbelievable!Starring Alan Arkin in one of his best roles, playing Alan Arkin the acerbic, single minded father who instructs his three disperate sons to drive an old cadillac across the country as a present for their mothers birthday. The proviso, of course, is that it must be delivered in mint condition.Can the three brothers: the career military man, the intelligent, sensitive middle brother and rebellious, teenage petty-crook of a third brother get it together long enough to succeed? It's not exactly rocket science to see where this is movie is heading. Cue bickering, shouting, arguing, crashing, romance and reconcilliation all set against the hazy, summer backdrop and 1963 vibe of an 'innocent America'.The film has a defiant message about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts and of the necessity of working at something even if a situation seems hopeless. It's summed up by a nice twist at the end that'll make you laugh and cry at the same time. However, all this is presented in such a realistic and warm manner you cannot help but get swept along in the brothers' cross country adventure and Arkin as the sour spirited, constant anchor keeps everything from sinking into too much schmaltz and syrup.In fact, all the actors acquit themselves superbly; stereotypical though their characters may be, the performances bring life and heart to the movie. You feel for the older brother (Daniel Stern,Home Alone,City Slickers) giving up his military career to continue the family business. The wayward younger brother (Patrick Dempsey,Sweet Home Alabama,Some Girlsand recently Grey's Anatomy) is teenage angst personified, rebellious but too scared to accept that anyone would (or could) help him. Best, for me is Arye Gross (Hexed,Big Eden) as the nerdy middle brother, forever trying to be peacemaker and the butt of big brothers disappointments and little brothers jokes. When he finally gets the girl, as it were (and it is!), you'll be cheering and what happens subsequently will see you letting off fireworks and calling in the marching band!!So, three arguing brothers drive a car across the country to deliver it in time for their Mom's birthday... Yup, that's about it... And SO much more! Coupe de Ville is a feel good movie that, for once, really does feel good.Considering the success these actors have achieved and of Arkins, pretty much, legend status, it's criminal this isn't out on DVD yet.",5,Warm hearted and wonderful.
