Also, like another reviewer said, it's very much like a home video. I'm really stuck trying to find a video for my twin girls that is fun, educational and appealing.

She loves to dance to Dancing with the Stars, so I thought this DVD would be perfect for her.  Well, unless I really get up and do it with her and do lots of coaxing, she's totally bored.  The instructor on this DVD has absolutely no personality.  I realize these are ballet drills, but come on, lighten up a little, these are kids.  This would probably be better for a kid who is already in a ballet class and needs practice at home.  But just for the fun of doing ballet, I would look for something else.  I got her one the Yoga Kids dvd, and the instructor makes it fun, so my daughter runs over to the tv to do the yoga very excitedly.  I think when you made a dvd for kids, especially one called ""Baby Ballet,"" there should be some effort to actually engage them.  This ballet video is a major yawn.",3,Very dry to watch for toddler,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,892,"['2.5', 'y/o', 'daughter', 'loves', 'dance', 'house', 'very', 'bright', 'little', 'thing', 'dance', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'thought', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'Well', 'really', 'get', 'up', 'do', 'do', 'lots', 'coaxing', 'totally', 'bored', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'personality', 'realize', 'are', 'ballet', 'drills', 'come', 'lighten', 'up', 'little', 'are', 'kids', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'kid', 'who', 'already', 'ballet', 'class', 'practice', 'home', 'just', 'fun', 'doing', 'ballet', 'would', 'look', 'something', 'else', 'got', 'one', 'Yoga', 'Kids', 'dvd', 'instructor', 'fun', 'daughter', 'tv', 'do', 'yoga', 'very', 'excitedly', 'think', 'when', 'made', 'dvd', 'kids', 'especially', 'one', 'called', 'Baby', 'Ballet', 'should', 'be', 'effort', 'actually', 'engage', 'ballet', 'video', 'major', 'yawn']",N/A
