When their refuge is overrun, and hearing that a scientist has discovered a cure, they leave the island to seek him out.This has to be one of the better zombie movies that has come from The Asylum, as of late. Of course, with its' accomplished cast, that's to be expected. However, I was rather disappointed with everyones' acting performances. It seemed to me that most of the cast dialed in their performances, there just wasn't much passion in their performances at all. Still, it's not enough to spoil the whole movie. There's plenty of zombie action, an interesting storyline that would-indeed-rival one on The Walking Dead, and even a little humor thrown in..if you look for it(you'll know what I mean, when you see it).This is a keeper for the Zombie fan...if not, for anything else, seeing(Spoiler)Danny Trejo turning into a flesh-eater.

(But I didn't think it was as good as Chiller Channel's Steve Nile's Remains!)  The acting was not as bad as I was expecting... in fact, I think it was pretty decent from most of the seasoned actors ... what I thought could have used a little work was the script ...and thinking the story out a little more, which might have fleshed out the characters a bit too. We are given a look into a character's journal but why, cause the revelation added nothing to the character. One character decides to separate from her beau to go into the zombie infested city to search for a cure but then looses her bravery and lust for life and love near the end! Senior ""Bad Ass"", who I was expecting to survive to the very end, gets overtaken by a yoga / ""The Grudge"" looking zombie! And oh my gosh, you would think that by now folks would realize that noise attracts zombies... there seems to be a lot of just standing around making noise and then watching as zombies surround the survivors!  There are a few slow bits (standing around as masses of zombies close in on them!) and a ton of over the top stupid bits that really didn't need to be in the movie, but added to the gore! ... Golden gate bridge baby delivery and Lamar Burton's character becomes mad scientist ... (surely even the dullest survivor realizes that it is flesh that the infected crave, hence all the munching they do on the living! But no, Professor Lamar didn`t know it until he got a boo boo)! And what I don't understand... if you got the cure... then why are you chopping off the arm of one guy and just giving another person a shot?  I just wish the writers had been a little more interested in writing a great zombie movie instead of seeing how much gore they could pack into the movie.Make up / zombies were pretty durn good looking! And these zombies are much like the ones in the remake of Day of The Dead... they are runners and great climbers... and I do believe a lot smarter than our group of survivors! I too think this might be one to save your money on and just wait and catch a rerun if you have nothing better to do!

1607283,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B00AAQ7JZI,Moviedude,"[2, 2]","The Asylum. Love them or hate them, you have almost certainly encountered this studio's work at least once in the form of those knockoff scifi movies that are shoveled out in order to confuse gift-hunting oldsters. If you woke up Christmas morning to a stocking with Transmorphers in it when you asked for Transformers, you probably curse the Asylum's name, but if you love the scholck filmmaking of the 60s then the Asylum is one of the few studios carrying on the tradition of having a cast of nobodies run around outside scared of something silly.Except in this case.The first thing you will notice about Rise is that there are many names in the cast that you will recognize. Most Asylum films contain one washed up famous actor, but Rise contains Levar Burton, Danny Trejo, Mariel Hemmingway, and Ethan Suplee! Some of those people have careers still! You will be further shocked to see that it is not a conspicuous ripoff of any particular film or television series; while it's initial title of The Dead Walk suggests a halfhearted mockbusting of The Walking Dead, this movie is also a Syfy original and as such had its name changed for TV. The end result is a zombie film that is more or less original, albeit slavishly adherent to all the tropes of Zombie cinema.The third thing you will notice is that the folks at the Asylum seem to want to break from their TV-friendly roots with this one. For those not in the know, the Asylum started life as a film-making branch of Blockbuster video, and as such their films have always been pretty PG-13 (even when they get an R). This movie, however, gleefully rains bloodshed and body horror upon the viewer as zombies are shot, non-zombies are mauled, and horrible stuff of every stripe happens. In one particularly upsetting scene, Levar Burton (who plays the requisite ""scientist who wants to cure the zombies"" character) cuts a slice out of his own arm in order to feed fresh human flesh to his zombie daughter. This pales next to another scene in which Mariel Hemmingway cuts the baby out of a dead, infected, pregnant woman (who Ethan Suplee has just shot) and hands it off to Heather Hemmens' character who watches in horror as the baby turns as well, then stomps it to death (then reveals she is also pregnant, then self-immolates in a trolly car). This scene is unrelentingly grim and is what most reviewers are talking about when they mention ""one scene that turned me off.""Sadly, while every stop has been pulled out for this film, it suffers from the two archenemies of cheapo film-making: writing and effects. The script is forgettable and the cuts are jumpy, and the ruination a zombie plague has brought on San Fransisco is hard to believe when speeding traffic is not removed from most of the long shots. The makeup for the zombies is good enough, but other effects such as electricity and fire just sort of suck. Nonetheless, this movie represents a bold step forward for the Asylum, into a world where horror movies can be R-rated and films don't have to be ripoffs.Of interest to some is that DTV action/horror films inevitably put the heroes at the helm of a huge truck of some sort, as big trucks are cheap and lend themselves to action. This film features two big action trucks, some flavor of Chevy (I think it's a Tahoe or a Suburban) and later an oldschool Toyota Tacoma. Also Ethan Suplee flies a helicopter because it turns out Randy is actually kind of a badass.",4,So help me this Asylum movie is almost good,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,3439,"['Asylum', 'Love', 'hate', 'have', 'almost', 'certainly', 'encountered', 'studio', 'work', 'least', 'once', 'form', 'knockoff', 'scifi', 'movies', 'are', 'shoveled', 'out', 'order', 'confuse', 'gift-hunting', 'oldsters', 'woke', 'up', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'stocking', 'Transmorphers', 'when', 'asked', 'Transformers', 'probably', 'curse', 'Asylum', 'name', 'love', 'scholck', 'filmmaking', '60s', 'then', 'Asylum', 'one', 'few', 'studios', 'carrying', 'tradition', 'having', 'cast', 'nobodies', 'run', 'outside', 'scared', 'something', 'silly.Except', 'case.The', 'first', 'thing', 'will', 'notice', 'Rise', 'are', 'many', 'names', 'cast', 'will', 'recognize', 'Most', 'Asylum', 'films', 'contain', 'one', 'washed', 'up', 'famous', 'actor', 'Rise', 'Levar', 'Burton', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'Mariel', 'Hemmingway', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'people', 'have', 'careers', 'still', 'will', 'be', 'further', 'shocked', 'see', 'not', 'conspicuous', 'ripoff', 'particular', 'film', 'television', 'series', 'initial', 'title', 'Dead', 'Walk', 'halfhearted', 'mockbusting', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'movie', 'also', 'Syfy', 'original', 'such', 'had', 'name', 'changed', 'TV', 'end', 'result', 'zombie', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'original', 'albeit', 'slavishly', 'adherent', 'tropes', 'Zombie', 'cinema.The', 'third', 'thing', 'will', 'notice', 'folks', 'Asylum', 'seem', 'want', 'break', 'TV-friendly', 'roots', 'one', 'not', 'know', 'Asylum', 'started', 'life', 'film-making', 'branch', 'Blockbuster', 'video', 'such', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'pretty', 'PG-13', 'even', 'when', 'get', 'R', 'movie', 'however', 'gleefully', 'bloodshed', 'body', 'horror', 'viewer', 'zombies', 'are', 'shot', 'non-zombies', 'are', 'mauled', 'horrible', 'stuff', 'stripe', 'one', 'particularly', 'upsetting', 'scene', 'Levar', 'Burton', 'who', 'requisite', 'scientist', 'who', 'cure', 'zombies', 'character', 'slice', 'own', 'arm', 'order', 'feed', 'fresh', 'human', 'flesh', 'zombie', 'daughter', 'next', 'scene', 'Mariel', 'Hemmingway', 'baby', 'dead', 'infected', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'just', 'shot', 'off', 'Heather', 'Hemmens', 'character', 'who', 'horror', 'baby', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'death', 'then', 'also', 'pregnant', 'then', 'trolly', 'car', 'scene', 'unrelentingly', 'grim', 'what', 'most', 'reviewers', 'are', 'talking', 'when', 'mention', 'one', 'scene', 'turned', 'off', 'Sadly', 'stop', 'been', 'pulled', 'out', 'film', 'two', 'archenemies', 'cheapo', 'film-making', 'writing', 'effects', 'script', 'forgettable', 'cuts', 'are', 'jumpy', 'ruination', 'zombie', 'plague', 'brought', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'hard', 'believe', 'when', 'speeding', 'traffic', 'not', 'removed', 'most', 'long', 'shots', 'makeup', 'zombies', 'good', 'enough', 'other', 'effects', 'such', 'electricity', 'fire', 'just', 'sort', 'suck', 'Nonetheless', 'movie', 'bold', 'step', 'forward', 'Asylum', 'world', 'where', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'R-rated', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'ripoffs.Of', 'interest', 'DTV', 'action/horror', 'films', 'inevitably', 'put', 'heroes', 'helm', 'huge', 'truck', 'sort', 'big', 'trucks', 'are', 'cheap', 'lend', 'action', 'film', 'two', 'big', 'action', 'trucks', 'flavor', 'Chevy', 'think', 'Tahoe', 'Suburban', 'later', 'oldschool', 'Toyota', 'Tacoma', 'Also', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'helicopter', 'out', 'Randy', 'actually', 'kind', 'badass']",N/A
1607284,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00AAQ7JZI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Rise of the Zombies (Nick Lyon, 2012)By the time the title card with &#8220;The Asylum Presents&#8221; came up five minutes into this movie, I already knew that its place at the very bottom of my 321-item Netflix Instant queue was well-deserved. I didn't realize it was going to get as much worse as it did, though, and by the time I was through I was sitting there slack-jawed trying to figure out (a) how casting director Gerald Webb (who would soon after cast the immortal Sharknado) managed to convince so many former A-list actors to appear in this piece of s*** and (b) how I managed to avoid stopping it halfway through. Rise of the Zombies runs eighty-nine minutes. It feels more like eighty-nine days.If you can get through the movie's first scene, with a group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse fleeing through San Francisco to try and make it to Alcatraz&#8212;one of the flat-out most ridiculous single scenes I have ever seen in a movie&#8212;you'll get to Alcatraz itself, where another small group is holed up trying to find a cure for the plague, led by Dr. Halpern (Star Trek: The Next Generation's LeVar Burton). After everyone in the compound makes a number of, shall we say, questionable choices (this is one of those movies where the plot is driven entirely by people doing stupid things), they...well, continue making stupid decisions. (Spoiler alert!)I have seen hundreds of zombie movies over the years, and a lot of them have been some of the worst pieces of garbage to which I have exposed myself over the years. Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence. Zombie Apocalypse and its even worse sequel Redemption. Survival of the Dead, the Romero movie not even diehard fans will defend. Infested. Legion of the Dead. I haven't quite decided yet&#8212;it would be pretty tough to be worse than Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie&#8212;but Rise of the Zombies may in fact be the worst of them I have ever seen. Not just because it's so irredeemably stupid, the effects are terrible, and (of course, it's an Asylum picture) everything about the movie that might once have been decent was ripped off shamelessly from another, much superior, movie. No, what really gets my goat about this one is that once again The Asylum managed to rope in people like Mariel Hemingway, LeVar Burton, and Danny Trejo in yet another cameo.

Do not buy it JUST due to Trejo being in it, his role is very limited in the later part of the film.  Typical over CGI uses but still worked well and you know this is a B-film type (not a slam, many best films that exist were not A-listed films) so there will be CGI to aid the budget constraints...if you cannot find it locally for say $10, or find it to rent, then I would not let the $12 price tag scare you off.

1607287,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00AAQ7JZI,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 6]","I didn't realize this was an Asylum production until after I purchased it. That said, I was not disappointed. The action takes place San Francisco. It is implied that due to government cutbacks (blame the Tea Party first crowd) the water supply got infected which lead to the zombie outbreak. There is a group doing research on Alcatraz headed by Dr. Lynn Snyder (Mariel Hemingway). There is another guy trying to develop a vaccine at Berkley who makes regular transmissions. When zombies start floating up at Alcatraz, that forces the two groups to come together.I like the zombie effects. We had the split in half crawling zombie; the limb out of joint zombie; a suicide zombie; a new born baby zombie; and an amputation to prevent infection. Being California, long handled tasers and not AR-15s are the weapons of choice versus zombies. There is a an over abundance of zombie action. In one weird unconvincing scene Hemingway pulls a knife on Trejo who then looked scared. The dialouge needed some improvement, but considering it was Asylum, I can't complain. The really bad special effect was the new born baby, which was obviously a doll from behind, and a several months old live baby from the front. It gave me a chuckle. Trejo's appearance is slightly more than a cameo.Also known as ""Dead Walking"" this appears to be the opening of a series like ""Walking Dead.""Parental Guide: TV-14. No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1607288,AXYK35P5RCPJ2,B00AAQ7JZI,Trejofan,"[0, 0]","I am not really a zombie movie fan but this one was better than I expected and that was undoubtedly due to the talented (and for the most part until they turned into zombies) attractive cast.  But, after seeing a few zombie movies, the story always seems to be basically the same.  Zombies are caused by a pathogen of some sort, and everyone but a small group is infected, and someone is always trying to find a cure--which is what happened in the one a short time  back with a big &#34;Z&#34; in the name. The main characters are always running away and the zombies who are apparently as astute as a detective on a case, always manage to find them.I can understand the zombies all having rotting flesh, and there being lots of blood and gore, visible missing and strewn about body parts, lots of intestines showing and blood splattered on walls.  However, what I don't understand is that their teeth--and most teeth are pretty durable--instantly turn rotted and crooked after they become zombies. And, since this takes place in San Francisco, in the state of California, where blindingly white teeth and veneers are the norm, all zombies apparently instantaneously overcome these cosmetic issues and they all rot--natural or not.  Perhaps someone can enlighten me on the theory behind this point?  Even Vampires have better teeth than these poor slobs. My hairless dog even has better teeth and she started out missing a few from the time she was born and will never have a full set. Even in the most recent zombie movie I'd seen (had a big Z in the name) this happened.  However, I did get a kick out of the way they make the teeth look, because after they instantly go bad, they look like the teeth of a former relative of mine. What kind of surprised me was that the first 4 people you see who are trying to make it out of San Francisco to Alcatraz were not the main characters.  Only one of those 4 even meets up with the others. And the time they spent at Alcatraz isn't that long.  Also, Mariel Hemmingway was and always will be a class act.  Levar Burton was really adorable with those huge dark eyes as the one who stays behind at Alcatraz to find a cure, and French Stewart sort of played a character that was a cross between the nutty professor and the character he played on Third Rock From the sun although he's been very effective in the few dramatic roles I've seen him in.  Although I've always thought he was very cute, the male lead was the delightful young man who played &#34;Randy&#34; on &#34;My Name is Earl.&#34; I couldn't seem to get past that, although he did a good job of acting.  Of course the delightfully macho Mr. Trejo did a great job as always. I just wish I could have had more time listening to his gravely voice and enjoying his physique (he was not dressed in a suit --yay!) and distinctive face. (Wonder what shampoo he uses--his hair is always shiny.) I also really liked the younger male lead who looked like a very young, thin, lighter-haired Sylvester Stallone. Mainly, this movie made me want to go to San Francisco and visit Alcatraz.  My favorite scene took place at the very beginning of the movie, which I believe was partially or totally animated.  It was when an SUV literally rolls down all the curves of the curvy part of Lombard, and this would have been rolling right past my ex-brother-in-law's apartment which looks out on that street.  Wonder if the filming kept him awake. This movie would.",3,enjoyed the san francisco scenes and of course Mr. Trejo's impressive appearance,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,3449,"['am', 'not', 'really', 'zombie', 'movie', 'fan', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'due', 'talented', 'most', 'part', 'turned', 'zombies', 'attractive', 'cast', 'seeing', 'few', 'zombie', 'movies', 'story', 'always', 'be', 'basically', 'same', 'Zombies', 'are', 'caused', 'pathogen', 'sort', 'everyone', 'small', 'group', 'infected', 'someone', 'always', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'what', 'happened', 'one', 'short', 'time', 'back', 'big', '34', 'Z', '34', 'name', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'running', 'away', 'zombies', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'as', 'astute', 'detective', 'case', 'always', 'manage', 'find', 'them.I', 'can', 'understand', 'zombies', 'having', 'rotting', 'flesh', 'there', 'being', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'visible', 'missing', 'strewn', 'body', 'parts', 'lots', 'intestines', 'showing', 'blood', 'splattered', 'walls', 'However', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'teeth', 'most', 'teeth', 'are', 'pretty', 'durable', 'instantly', 'turn', 'rotted', 'crooked', 'become', 'zombies', 'place', 'San', 'Francisco', 'state', 'California', 'where', 'blindingly', 'white', 'teeth', 'veneers', 'are', 'norm', 'zombies', 'apparently', 'instantaneously', 'overcome', 'cosmetic', 'issues', 'rot', 'natural', 'not', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'can', 'enlighten', 'theory', 'point', 'Even', 'Vampires', 'have', 'better', 'teeth', 'poor', 'slobs', 'hairless', 'dog', 'even', 'better', 'teeth', 'started', 'out', 'missing', 'few', 'time', 'was', 'born', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'full', 'set', 'Even', 'most', 'recent', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'had', 'big', 'Z', 'name', 'happened', 'However', 'did', 'get', 'kick', 'way', 'make', 'teeth', 'look', 'instantly', 'go', 'bad', 'look', 'teeth', 'former', 'relative', 'mine', 'What', 'kind', 'surprised', 'was', 'first', '4', 'people', 'see', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Alcatraz', 'were', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'Only', 'one', '4', 'even', 'up', 'others', 'time', 'spent', 'Alcatraz', ""n't"", 'that', 'long', 'Also', 'Mariel', 'Hemmingway', 'was', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'class', 'act', 'Levar', 'Burton', 'was', 'really', 'adorable', 'huge', 'dark', 'eyes', 'one', 'who', 'behind', 'Alcatraz', 'find', 'cure', 'French', 'Stewart', 'sort', 'played', 'character', 'was', 'cross', 'nutty', 'professor', 'character', 'played', 'Third', 'Rock', 'sun', 'been', 'very', 'effective', 'few', 'dramatic', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'delightful', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', '34', 'Randy', '34', '34', 'Name', 'Earl.', '34', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'past', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'course', 'delightfully', 'macho', 'Mr.', 'Trejo', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'always', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'listening', 'gravely', 'voice', 'enjoying', 'physique', 'was', 'not', 'dressed', 'suit', 'yay', 'distinctive', 'face', 'Wonder', 'what', 'shampoo', 'hair', 'always', 'shiny', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'younger', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'looked', 'very', 'young', 'thin', 'lighter-haired', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Mainly', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'San', 'Francisco', 'visit', 'Alcatraz', 'favorite', 'scene', 'took', 'place', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'believe', 'was', 'partially', 'totally', 'animated', 'was', 'when', 'SUV', 'literally', 'down', 'curves', 'curvy', 'part', 'Lombard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rolling', 'right', 'ex-brother-in-law', 'apartment', 'out', 'street', 'Wonder', 'filming', 'kept', 'awake', 'movie', 'would']",N/A
