1507982,AAZRWLML88IZK,B0060WH7JE,A kids review,"[5, 8]","If you haven't heard of Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, then you are extremely fortunate. Considering it only made about $2.5 million in box office receipts and left theaters after two weeks, it's an understandable oversight. Produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison studio, the film stars comic Nick Swardson as the titular Bucky, a man-child who discovers his uptight parents were once famous porn stars. With this newfound knowledge, Bucky decides to follow in his parents' footsteps and sets his sights on Hollywood, where his small genitalia make him a popular gimmick. There's more to the story, but it's really not worth getting into. This aggressively unfunny and severely misguided comedy is the worst movie I saw in 2011; do what you will with that information.",1,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,772,"['have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Bucky', 'Larson', 'Born', 'Be', 'Star', 'then', 'are', 'extremely', 'fortunate', 'Considering', 'only', 'made', '2.5', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'left', 'theaters', 'two', 'weeks', 'understandable', 'oversight', 'Produced', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'studio', 'film', 'stars', 'comic', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'titular', 'Bucky', 'man-child', 'who', 'uptight', 'parents', 'were', 'once', 'famous', 'porn', 'stars', 'newfound', 'knowledge', 'Bucky', 'follow', 'parents', 'footsteps', 'sights', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'small', 'genitalia', 'make', 'popular', 'gimmick', 'more', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'worth', 'getting', 'aggressively', 'unfunny', 'severely', 'misguided', 'comedy', 'worst', 'movie', 'saw', '2011', 'do', 'what', 'will', 'information']",N/A
1507983,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0060WH7JE,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star is intended for people that like lots of sexual-related comedy.  Now I definitely fall into this category much to many peoples dissatisfaction but... when used in a comedy, the sex jokes need to be backed up with a solid storyline and interesting characters.  Unfortunately Bucky Larson doesn't contain either (despite how attractive Christina Ricci is of course!)It's about the immature, unattractive, sex-happy character of Bucky Larson going to his friends house one evening as a way to discover himself shall we say, and upon watching a porno he recognizes the characters in the movie... because they are his *parents*.  Now wouldn't THAT be the ultimate surprise?  Not in a good way either!After confronting his parents, Bucky realizes that he'd like to travel to Hollywood and make it big as a porn actor.  This is when the storyline gets going.  He meets several people including Christina Ricci at a diner and when Bucky realizes he has no place to go, Christina introduces Bucky to a roommate that's probably the funniest person in the entire movie because he's so incredibly direct and demanding that Bucky do whatever he says and that's that.  A segment involving Bucky seeing this man on the toilet is hilarious.Ironically enough, Christina Ricci plays a normal and rational woman and not a quiet weirdo like in other movies!Later on Bucky eventually finds himself in a porn audition after meeting the right people that give him the chance.  However everyone makes fun of his tiny man parts and laughs at his desire to be a legitimate porn actor based on his ugly and unsatisfying appearance.  The movie sort of falls into this seemingly constant pattern for an extended people of time and the storyline never accomplishes much as a result.  Plus the sex jokes reach a level of such mindlessness that you might be tempted to turn the movie off halfway through (and I wouldn't blame you if you did).Overall, not enough substance from a storyline point of view, and Bucky's character is too dim-witted and clueless to really care about either.  I'm not a fan of Nick Swardson either so that certainly doesn't help.

Once the Peanut Butter and Goat credits finally ended we see Bucky at his job as a grocery sacker at ""Fooders"" where his boss played by Curtis Armstrong (AKA Booger) fires poor Bucky (Not clear why but it does not really matter anyways). I'll skip over the dinner seen with Bucky's Parents and get to where Bucky goes to his friends house to watch a new movie. The movie that Bucky watches (And at the same time gets off to) is a 1970's porno of his parents. At this point Bucky realizes his destiny and decides to go to Hollywood to be a porn star. The rest of this you will have to rent from Red Box and experience the holocaust yourself, I can't bring myself to type anymore. I'm having violent flashbacks as it is with the little I managed to hammer out. Please GOD, Strike down these unholy images from my brain! Take me to my special place where I may forget.My first thoughts was to trash both my TV and Blu-Ray player so I could sanctify my entertainment system but came to my senses in time before I had found my sons metal bat in the garage. Upon returning ""Bucky"" back to the Red Box Kiosk I hesitated briefly because I was afraid the machine would abruptly catch fire after inserting Bucky back into it, luckily it went without incident.I never truly recognized how bad the economy had gotten until watching Bucky, seeing good actors like Don Johnson, Christina Ricci, Stephen Doriff, Jimmy Fallen, Curtis Armstrong and Pauly Shore (Yes I said Pauly Shore, Bio-Dome was a park walk with what Nick Swardson did) give up what integrity they may have had to actually use their real names with this movie.The really sad thing my son who is an Adam Sandler fan (as myself) is hoping that Adam just put his name on the script and can have plausible deniability that he had any ""creative input"" concerning this abomination. Before anybody says anything we are not defending the stuff that Adam has put out over the years but you can usually get a laugh even if it was unintentional. This cannot be said for this unholy horror. I'm just hoping after this Adam Sandler revives Rob Schneider's mediocre career, it will be a welcome site after seeing Nick's first starring role.So in Conclusion both I and my Son who are both card carrying Golden Razzberry Members have found what will be our sure fire pick for the 32nd Razzies this year.",1,Bucky Larson - Career Killer,1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,2786,"['Stay', 'as', 'Far', 'can', 'atrocity', 'buy', 'something', 'good', 'Benchwarmers', 'know', 'was', 'horrible', 'least', 'laughed', 'was', 'clearly', '1st', 'sign', 'what', 'direction', 'Bucky', 'was', 'heading', 'when', 'saw', 'inbreed', 'farmer', 'probably', 'left', 'over', 'Deliverance', 'smacked', 'peanut', 'butter', 'Junk', 'goat', 'could', 'snack', 'was', 'still', 'middle', 'intro', 'credits', 'even', 'get', 'Bucky', 'Once', 'Peanut', 'Butter', 'Goat', 'credits', 'finally', 'ended', 'see', 'Bucky', 'job', 'grocery', 'sacker', 'Fooders', 'where', 'boss', 'played', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'AKA', 'Booger', 'poor', 'Bucky', 'Not', 'clear', 'why', 'not', 'really', 'matter', 'anyways', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'dinner', 'seen', 'Bucky', 'Parents', 'get', 'where', 'Bucky', 'friends', 'house', 'watch', 'new', 'movie', 'movie', 'Bucky', 'watches', 'same', 'time', '1970', 'porno', 'parents', 'point', 'Bucky', 'destiny', 'decides', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'porn', 'star', 'rest', 'will', 'have', 'rent', 'Red', 'Box', 'experience', 'holocaust', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'type', 'anymore', ""'m"", 'having', 'violent', 'flashbacks', 'little', 'managed', 'hammer', 'out', 'Please', 'GOD', 'Strike', 'unholy', 'images', 'brain', 'Take', 'special', 'place', 'where', 'may', 'forget.My', 'first', 'thoughts', 'was', 'trash', 'TV', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'could', 'sanctify', 'entertainment', 'system', 'came', 'senses', 'time', 'had', 'found', 'sons', 'metal', 'bat', 'garage', 'returning', 'Bucky', 'back', 'Red', 'Box', 'Kiosk', 'hesitated', 'briefly', 'was', 'afraid', 'machine', 'would', 'abruptly', 'catch', 'fire', 'inserting', 'Bucky', 'back', 'went', 'incident.I', 'never', 'truly', 'recognized', 'how', 'bad', 'economy', 'had', 'gotten', 'watching', 'Bucky', 'seeing', 'good', 'actors', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Stephen', 'Doriff', 'Jimmy', 'Fallen', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'Yes', 'said', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'Bio-Dome', 'was', 'park', 'walk', 'what', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'did', 'give', 'up', 'what', 'integrity', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'actually', 'use', 'real', 'names', 'movie.The', 'really', 'sad', 'thing', 'son', 'who', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'myself', 'hoping', 'Adam', 'just', 'put', 'name', 'script', 'can', 'have', 'plausible', 'deniability', 'had', 'creative', 'input', 'concerning', 'abomination', 'anybody', 'anything', 'are', 'not', 'defending', 'stuff', 'Adam', 'put', 'out', 'years', 'can', 'usually', 'get', 'laugh', 'even', 'was', 'unintentional', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'unholy', 'horror', ""'m"", 'just', 'hoping', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'mediocre', 'career', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'site', 'seeing', 'Nick', 'first', 'starring', 'role.So', 'Conclusion', 'Son', 'who', 'are', 'card', 'carrying', 'Golden', 'Razzberry', 'Members', 'have', 'found', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'fire', 'pick', '32nd', 'Razzies', 'year']",N/A

Well, I for one give BUCKY LARSON 5 stars without a moment's hesitation!  This is one those films that I found by accident and it pulled me in like a hungry fisherman reeling in a prized rainbow trout.  It had everything you could ask for in a film, a great star, NICK SWARDSON, great co-stars, DON JOHNSON, CHRISTINA RICCI,...and of course a poignant, sweet and funny story.  I can't say enough about how much I just loved this movie.  If you are feeling down, BUCKY LARSON will turn that frown upside down!  This movie really is uplifting.  It portrays a life that most people would kill for.  Bucky has parents who love him, neighbors who care about him, friends who want to help him, a girlfriend who would sacrifice everything for him, and why?  Well Bucky is just that awesome!  People question Nick Swardson's acting ability, well, I can't imagine that anyone else could have pulled this character off without being phony or smarmy.  Nick Swardson gave Bucky incredible charm, humanity, warmth, heart and likability, and to me, that is award winning acting!  Plus the co-stars were just a perfect addition.  Don Johnson and Christina Ricci were fantastic!  They were absolutely believable, sincere and likable.  I want them to be MY friends!  And Bucky's parents,...I love my parents but I would be honored to have Bucky's parents be my own.  I can go on and on here, but just take a look.

1507992,A356RFKNIG043B,B0060WH7JE,K. Swanson,"[1, 1]","3.2 starsIf you really like Ed Wood movies, precisely because they are terrible, then you are Bucky-ready. If not, and even the most hilariously wretched movies just seem plain bad to you, then please move on to the next film. But if you like 'em so bad they're good, then here you go...Bucky Larson is now infamous for being the lowest rated Rotten Tomato of them all: zero percent thumbs up! So I was expecting the worst film ever made, which some reviewers claim Bucky is. But let me damn them with some faint praise for Bucky (that will probably be the only Shakespeare reference ever made within ten miles of this film).Is this film ""good""? No. But, it was never meant to be. It's clearly an uber-parody, a satire about how bad movies can be, especially romantic comedies. I think a lot of people miss that, or just didn't see enough of the truly execrable romcoms that came out from about 1974-1992 or so. Some of those films were so bad because they thought they were kinda good. Not in this case! Bucky takes every trope and cliche from bad comedies and milks them, as it were, until they cover the wall. It's even got a Journey song during the final ""they-get-together-forever"" scene. Now that's the romcom seal of approval. And don't forget that Adam Sandler is one of the writers, so Citizen Kane is not exactly on the radar...I love to laugh in general, so I was ready to take what came my way here. The thing most miss is that this film actually has a pretty good heart; they could have gone for meaner laughs but didn't, which makes this almost kind of gee shucksy at points. And frankly, there were more laughs than expected. Kevin Nealon is very funny at moments, as is Swardson, simply because he is such a truly weak actor.

1507995,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B0060WH7JE,Mike,"[1, 4]","Synopsis:  Bucky Larson (played by Nick Swardson) is a man-child living in rural Iowa who believes he is destined for better things after getting fired from his job at the local grocery store.  During a night of fooling around with his friends, he finds found that his reserved parents Jeremiah (Edward Hermann) and Debbie (Miriam Flynn) were popular and prolific porn stars during the 1970s.  Inspired, Bucky packs up his things and moves to Los Angeles, where he plans on continuing the family legacy.  Though he knows no one in Los Angeles, a waitress by the name of Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci) takes him under her wing and ensures that he sees to it that his dreams are fulfilled.  Under the pressure to get money for his new roommate Gary (Kevin Nealon), Bucky tries to get into the adult business, but is publicly humiliated by his lack of endowment by the over-endowed Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff).  This doesn't dissuade down-and-out porn producer Miles Deep (Don Johnson) from attempting to make a buck off Bucky and his family's reputation, however, so he offers to make Bucky Larson ""a star.""  Will Miles regret taking a gamble on Bucky?  Will Bucky Larson be a star?  And if so, will Kathy accept who he is for who he is and take their relationship to the next level?  Pauly Shore and Jimmy Fallon make cameo appearances.The premise is convoluted and it seems odd that everyone in Bucky's life is so nonchalant about his newfound choice of vocation. BThe movie followed a lot of the humor that the other Happy Madison films followed and the acting as a whole seemed rather weak.  Kevin Nealon is singlehandedly the reason why I would even consider watching this film again.  Had he not played the role of Gary, I could see myself enjoying this as much as I would have enjoyed a root canal.  I was expecting more with that kinda star power.Members of the 18-35 crowd who like to party while watching movies may find something worthwhile in watching this.  Anyone else, however, probably wouldn't enjoy it enough to watch, let alone own or rent.",1,Kevin Nealon Was The Only Reason This Was Worth Watching,1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,2056,"['Synopsis', 'Bucky', 'Larson', 'played', 'Nick', 'Swardson', 'man-child', 'living', 'rural', 'Iowa', 'who', 'destined', 'better', 'things', 'getting', 'fired', 'job', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'night', 'fooling', 'friends', 'found', 'reserved', 'parents', 'Jeremiah', 'Edward', 'Hermann', 'Debbie', 'Miriam', 'Flynn', 'were', 'popular', 'prolific', 'porn', 'stars', '1970s', 'Inspired', 'Bucky', 'up', 'things', 'moves', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'continuing', 'family', 'legacy', 'one', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'waitress', 'name', 'Kathy', 'McGee', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'wing', 'dreams', 'are', 'fulfilled', 'pressure', 'get', 'money', 'new', 'roommate', 'Gary', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Bucky', 'get', 'adult', 'business', 'publicly', 'humiliated', 'lack', 'endowment', 'over-endowed', 'Dick', 'Shadow', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', ""n't"", 'dissuade', 'down-and-out', 'porn', 'producer', 'Miles', 'Deep', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'attempting', 'make', 'buck', 'Bucky', 'family', 'reputation', 'however', 'make', 'Bucky', 'Larson', 'star', 'Will', 'Miles', 'regret', 'taking', 'gamble', 'Bucky', 'Will', 'Bucky', 'Larson', 'be', 'star', 'so', 'will', 'Kathy', 'accept', 'who', 'who', 'take', 'relationship', 'next', 'level', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances.The', 'premise', 'convoluted', 'odd', 'everyone', 'Bucky', 'life', 'so', 'nonchalant', 'newfound', 'choice', 'vocation', 'BThe', 'movie', 'followed', 'lot', 'humor', 'other', 'Happy', 'Madison', 'films', 'followed', 'acting', 'whole', 'seemed', 'rather', 'weak', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'singlehandedly', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'Had', 'not', 'played', 'role', 'Gary', 'could', 'see', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'root', 'canal', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'kinda', 'star', 'power.Members', '18-35', 'crowd', 'who', 'party', 'watching', 'movies', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'Anyone', 'else', 'however', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'enough', 'watch', 'let', 'alone', 'own', 'rent']",N/A

Swardson and Sandler have been moving away from knee-slapping comedy and making films that are more message oriented. I am perplexed by some of the &#34;message&#34; which tends to be highly raunchy and out of my league, but I know going in that the content is going to be very liberal and frankly absurd. The Swardson/Sandler crew did much better with Jack and Larry or Grandma's Boy. Both were a lot funnier than this one. I am not a fan of alternative lifestyles or sex humor stemming from same, but I am open-minded enough to set aside my preferences for an hour or so. I wish it had been funnier. There was no DRIVE MONKEY DRIVE scene. What I did find was that beneath the unadulterated sickness, there was a message of honesty and love.
