The problem is that what they say does not match what I have seen on other documentaries and read in books. Specifically, they white wash the crass incompetence of the leadership of the SOE in their discussion of operation north pole. This video claims that it took some time for them to realize that the agents were captured. What actually happened is that all captured agents, from the first one, inserted prearranged things in their transmissions back to England to indicate that they had been captured. This was told to the colonel in charge of SOE and other leaders and nothing was done about it. Other sources, such as the RAF and a statistician, reported that something was wrong and nothing was done about it.",4,something is wrong,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,789,"['have', 'only', 'viewed', 'first', 'episode', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'later', 'problem', 'what', 'say', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'documentaries', 'read', 'books', 'Specifically', 'white', 'wash', 'crass', 'incompetence', 'leadership', 'SOE', 'discussion', 'operation', 'north', 'pole', 'video', 'took', 'time', 'realize', 'agents', 'were', 'captured', 'What', 'actually', 'happened', 'captured', 'agents', 'first', 'one', 'inserted', 'prearranged', 'things', 'transmissions', 'back', 'England', 'indicate', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'was', 'told', 'colonel', 'charge', 'SOE', 'other', 'leaders', 'nothing', 'was', 'done', 'Other', 'sources', 'such', 'RAF', 'statistician', 'reported', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'nothing', 'was', 'done']",Secrets of War - Shadows of The Reich - 10 Episodes

It's NOT, I repeat NOT that I approve of the terrible things he did to Germany or the Jews.  I have always been interested on how one man could convince one race to wipe out another.  What did this monster have to make so many German men kill so many innocent people.  This DVD is very detailed and explains what Hilter;s plan for world domination started back in 1925.  I like a lot of people think that he was able to carry out his terrible acts in a short period of time.  It took many years of lies to the German's to attempt his goal.  So many German's were &#34;tricked&#34; into joining the Third Reich thinking that it was to better Germany.  This DVD informed me of many things I did not know, and I think I have a pretty good grasp of what happened.

Narrated by Charlton Heston this is good stuff. I wanted anyone looking here to check out the complete box set of 65 episodes, if you buy them through an amazon seller they come out to less then 30 cents an episode (less then 20 dollars).
