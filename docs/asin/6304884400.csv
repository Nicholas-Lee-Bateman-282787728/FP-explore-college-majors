438629,A14B73GG8OFXKH,6304884400,Amazon Customer,"[10, 21]","(spoilers, but don't worry; you'll never want to watch it anyway)Every few years or so, I come across a movie that seriously contends for the title of &quot;worst movie ever made.&quot;  Godzilla was one of them, then 200 cigarettes, tomb raider... Anyhow, if it weren't for the respectable effort made by Denzel Washington, this movie just might take the cake..Denzel plays a cop-turned-DA and Lithgow is a psycopathic hitman who has an obsession with breaking out of prison and getting his revenge on the man who put him away.Nothing here seems to make any sense.  For example, the sword fight at the beginning between Blake (John Lithgow) and his cellmate -- first of all, Blake already established his dominance as soon as he entered the jail cell and beat up his new roommate.  This bizarre neo-medeival sequence, using books and newspaper as armor, has no point at all.  It's just a excuse to showcase some really bad dialogue.And as for really bad dialogue, Ricochet is unequalled.  I cringed at least once every two minutes.  Lithgow is so ridiculously serious in his role that anything he says sounds like it's a mockery of himself.  It reminds me of the head gangster in the movie Ghost Dog, except in that movie it's *supposed* to be ridiculous.  Who knows - maybe that was the idea here.The end is totally gratuitous.  The plan that Denzel comes up with is completely foolish for one thing - if his plan were to fail, which would almost certainly happen, he would end up completely ruining himself.  But in the movie, it doesn't fail.  Ok, fine.  But then, when he has Blake surrounded and could easily have him captured, or at least video-taped to prove that he's still alive (oh yeah, Blake made a preposterous escape at the beginning of the movie and then faked his death), he draws the charade on longer and has Blake chase him down to the Watts Towers.. (The fact that the towers are used  is the only cool thing about this movie besides Denzel..)  It just seems like he's making things as difficult as possible for himself.  He comes off like an idiot.A good mainstream suspense movie should have a very intellegent protaganist and a slightly more intellegent antaganist; the only reason the protaganist should ever win is because of his absolute commitment to survival and justice, not because the antaganist is easily tricked into silly little scenarios, like being electricuted on Watts Towers (would those towers really conduct that much electricity??)I misread the title of the movie on my Satellite TV guide and thought I was going to watch a movie about Pinochet..",1,I watched it because I thought it was about Chile,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,2589,"['spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'never', 'want', 'watch', 'anyway', 'Every', 'few', 'years', 'so', 'come', 'movie', 'seriously', 'title', 'quot', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made.', 'quot', 'Godzilla', 'was', 'one', 'then', '200', 'cigarettes', 'tomb', 'raider', 'Anyhow', 'were', ""n't"", 'respectable', 'effort', 'made', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'movie', 'just', 'might', 'take', 'cake..Denzel', 'cop-turned-DA', 'Lithgow', 'psycopathic', 'hitman', 'who', 'obsession', 'breaking', 'prison', 'getting', 'revenge', 'man', 'who', 'put', 'away.Nothing', 'here', 'make', 'sense', 'example', 'sword', 'fight', 'beginning', 'Blake', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'cellmate', 'first', 'Blake', 'already', 'established', 'dominance', 'as', 'soon', 'entered', 'jail', 'cell', 'beat', 'up', 'new', 'roommate', 'bizarre', 'neo-medeival', 'sequence', 'using', 'books', 'newspaper', 'armor', 'point', 'just', 'excuse', 'showcase', 'really', 'bad', 'dialogue.And', 'really', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'Ricochet', 'unequalled', 'cringed', 'least', 'once', 'two', 'minutes', 'Lithgow', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'serious', 'role', 'anything', 'mockery', 'head', 'gangster', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'movie', '*supposed*', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'Who', 'maybe', 'was', 'idea', 'here.The', 'end', 'totally', 'gratuitous', 'plan', 'up', 'completely', 'foolish', 'one', 'thing', 'plan', 'were', 'fail', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'happen', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'completely', 'ruining', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fail', 'Ok', 'fine', 'then', 'when', 'Blake', 'surrounded', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'captured', 'least', 'video-taped', 'prove', 'still', 'alive', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Blake', 'made', 'preposterous', 'escape', 'beginning', 'movie', 'then', 'faked', 'death', 'charade', 'longer', 'Blake', 'chase', 'down', 'Watts', 'Towers..', 'fact', 'towers', 'are', 'used', 'only', 'cool', 'thing', 'movie', 'Denzel..', 'just', 'making', 'things', 'as', 'difficult', 'possible', 'off', 'idiot.A', 'good', 'mainstream', 'suspense', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'intellegent', 'protaganist', 'slightly', 'more', 'intellegent', 'antaganist', 'only', 'reason', 'protaganist', 'should', 'ever', 'win', 'absolute', 'commitment', 'survival', 'justice', 'not', 'antaganist', 'easily', 'tricked', 'silly', 'little', 'scenarios', 'being', 'electricuted', 'Watts', 'Towers', 'would', 'towers', 'really', 'conduct', 'much', 'electricity', 'misread', 'title', 'movie', 'Satellite', 'TV', 'guide', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'Pinochet..']",N/A

It was on HBO right after the George Foreman vs. Lou Savarese fight a few years back. Being a film with Denzel Washington and John Lithgow, I was surprised that I hadn't heard of it before then but was in for a big surprise.Being a 1991 film (and an HBO Original Production), this was made before Denzel Washington really hit it big but it's one of his finest films in my opinion. While Washington portays a young cop turned bright futured district attorney, the best job in the film is done by John Lithgow, who plays one of the best psychotic yet genius characters in recent memory (Earl Talbot Blake). Lithgow, in fact, does such a good job playing this insane yet calculating killer hell bent on revenge that it's very strange to turn around and watch him on 3rd Rock From The Sun!The supporting characters played by Ice-T and Kevin Pollak are well done and well written, but also very important in the storyline...something that isn't always true in mainstream films.The plot is very interesting, and not something that has been 'done to death'. As the film winds down, it seems a little predictable but also the only suitable way for everything to end. Ok, so it's not a blockbuster 4 star masterpiece, but RICOCHET is still a very well written film that is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.

A lot of his movies fit those categories.Washington plays a preacher's kid and its nice to see he has such respect for him.So many times, Hollywood portrays fathers and especially clergymen in a bad light. John Lithgow is the villain and is such a crazy over-the-top loon he's fun to watch. There are no lulls in this story, yet the action scenes weren't overdone.It gets predictable in the end but I like the analogy in the film to the classic movie, ""White Heat."" I was sorry to see a few things: once again, white people are all the bigots; Lindsay Wagner, television's nice lady of the past, now using very profane language here and looking hard.Overall, this sometimes looks like a ""B"" action film more than a classy one but it's still an interesting crime film that sports a few different angles.

Otherwise, that and the city of L.A. and the LAPD are the only connections to the later film.  Personally, I'm just fine with that.  This film occasionally gets a bit goofy and comical, but it stands up quite well on it's own.  My only real problem in regard to its plot is when Denzel Washington's character strips down in order to get the gun with which he takes down John Lithgow's character...seriously, I could have done without that entire scene.  But it got the story moving, so I'll let it go.  John Lithgow was perfectly creepy and self-serving throughout the film (it's very important to aknowledge that second trait), making him a man I so dearly wanted to take down myself.  Denzel Washington countered him with a man who knows his morals and principles but has to contend with everyone else's growing doubts about these atributes of his and he gets perfectly more and more frustrated as the movie goes on.  Perhaps my favorite performance was that of Ice-T...I'm just so used to seeing him as Finn on Law and Order:  SVU that it was nice to see him doing something besides that and doing it well, though his organization of the press and cops at the end was kind of goofy.  Again, I'll let that go.  If you're like me and you can let the minor silliness go, then this is a decent cat-and-mouse chase to watch.
