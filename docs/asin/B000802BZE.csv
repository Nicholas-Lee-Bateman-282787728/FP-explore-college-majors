896896,A1L3ZKSZAOU0HW,B000802BZE,gussy73,"[2, 2]","From the opening scene, the movie GRABS you.  Haunting, simply haunting!!! Bill Bast,(Dean's best friend through the last five years of his life), retelling his therapist of a constant dream involving Dean inside an abandoned church, sitting on a bed, and just waiting. Upon seeing Bast, Dean walks  towards him and hugs him with a smile of sheer joy and relief upon seeing an old friend.  This mood quicky changes to panic and despair when Dean sees an ambulance through the window, pull up with some orderlies holding a stretcher and a nurse slowly walking towards the building....""Willy, they're coming to get me...Willie, don't let them take me..Please, don't let them take me!!!"" The scene is chilling and to think that Bast was haunted my this reoccuring dream for YEARS after Dean's death gives the viewer an idea of the bond they had and the guilt he must have felt to lose his friend under those cicumstances. It is interesting that this dream resembles a scene from ""East of Eden"" where Dean sees his mother and is pulled away from her by two men while he pleads to them to let him go...Perhaps this scene really resonated with Bass and from it the fantasy blurred with reality...This movie is very good...I thought it gave an honest, poignant portrayal of Dean. Also, for a 70's TV movie, it was bold enough to address to some degree Dean's sexual attraction to women as well as men. I have read over and over ""The Little Prince"" and analyze every paragraph and wonder what and how  Dean interpreted the very same lines in the story..knowing that he loved and cherish this book!!!",4,Nostalgic Gem,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,1591,"['opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'GRABS', 'Haunting', 'simply', 'haunting', 'Bill', 'Bast', 'Dean', 'best', 'friend', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'life', 'retelling', 'therapist', 'constant', 'dream', 'involving', 'Dean', 'abandoned', 'church', 'sitting', 'bed', 'just', 'waiting', 'seeing', 'Bast', 'Dean', 'walks', 'towards', 'hugs', 'smile', 'sheer', 'joy', 'relief', 'seeing', 'old', 'friend', 'mood', 'quicky', 'changes', 'panic', 'despair', 'when', 'Dean', 'ambulance', 'window', 'pull', 'up', 'orderlies', 'holding', 'stretcher', 'nurse', 'slowly', 'walking', 'building', 'Willy', ""'re"", 'coming', 'get', 'Willie', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'take', 'me..Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'take', 'scene', 'chilling', 'think', 'Bast', 'was', 'haunted', 'reoccuring', 'dream', 'YEARS', 'Dean', 'death', 'viewer', 'idea', 'bond', 'had', 'guilt', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'lose', 'friend', 'cicumstances', 'interesting', 'dream', 'scene', 'East', 'Eden', 'where', 'Dean', 'mother', 'pulled', 'away', 'two', 'men', 'let', 'go', 'Perhaps', 'scene', 'really', 'resonated', 'Bass', 'fantasy', 'blurred', 'reality', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'gave', 'honest', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'Dean', 'Also', '70', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'bold', 'enough', 'address', 'degree', 'Dean', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'have', 'read', 'Little', 'Prince', 'analyze', 'paragraph', 'wonder', 'what', 'how', 'Dean', 'interpreted', 'very', 'same', 'lines', 'story..knowing', 'loved', 'cherish', 'book']",N/A
896897,AEIZTTNHRON6B,B000802BZE,"Neil Elliot ""DEMYgogue""","[2, 2]","This T.V. film version focusing on the start of the professional period of James Dean's life, up to his untimely death, written by his friend William Bast, attempts to deal with Dean's bisexuality in conjunction with his private and professional life.  When the film was made in the 80's, there was obviously still a concern about dealing openly with homosexuality.  Things today in the 21st Century have, fortunately, become much more open and accepting by many.However, Bast has done his best in showing what went on in his own life, paralleling his emotional relationship with Dean.  Don't forget, the 50's were rife with prejudice and fear of anything that questioned the status quo....probably the most telling moment regarding the frustration and pain experienced by many gay men at that time (and, unfortunately, even today) was when Bast's character (wonderfully underplayed by Michael Brandon) sits in the empty bathtub and just IS, letting the camera bring to us a taste of love unfulfilled....I was a grad student at UCLA in the theatre department back in the 60's, and there were always little bits and pieces floating around about the GREAT James Dean's time there.  Unquestionably a brilliant talent, a troubled soul and a great addition to the list of actors who made or could have made a great difference in the art form, James Dean is a tough spirit to capture.  Which is why the not-so-long-ago T.V. biopic directed by Mark Rydell staring James Franco in a spot-on channeling of Dean should not be missed if it is indeed available on CD.  McHattie was good, but Franco is superb.This video is similar to those often found in supermarket bins filled with films in the public domain.  There are a great deal of excellent t.v. films out there that are slowly seeping into the public view.  Warner Bros. is leading the way.  This CD, JAMES DEAN, is one that anyone interested in the creative process, or genius, some might say, of a lost star, should take a close look at.",4,"Jimmy, we hardly knew ya",1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,1986,"['T.V', 'film', 'version', 'focusing', 'start', 'professional', 'period', 'James', 'Dean', 'life', 'up', 'untimely', 'death', 'written', 'friend', 'William', 'Bast', 'deal', 'Dean', 'bisexuality', 'conjunction', 'private', 'professional', 'life', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'made', '80', 'was', 'obviously', 'still', 'concern', 'dealing', 'openly', 'homosexuality', 'Things', 'today', '21st', 'Century', 'have', 'fortunately', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'open', 'accepting', 'many.However', 'Bast', 'done', 'best', 'showing', 'what', 'went', 'own', 'life', 'paralleling', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', '50', 'were', 'rife', 'prejudice', 'fear', 'anything', 'questioned', 'status', 'quo', '.probably', 'most', 'telling', 'moment', 'regarding', 'frustration', 'pain', 'experienced', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'Bast', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'underplayed', 'Michael', 'Brandon', 'empty', 'bathtub', 'just', 'IS', 'letting', 'camera', 'bring', 'taste', 'love', 'unfulfilled', '.I', 'was', 'grad', 'student', 'UCLA', 'theatre', 'department', 'back', '60', 'were', 'always', 'little', 'bits', 'pieces', 'floating', 'GREAT', 'James', 'Dean', 'time', 'there', 'Unquestionably', 'brilliant', 'talent', 'troubled', 'soul', 'great', 'addition', 'list', 'actors', 'who', 'made', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'difference', 'art', 'form', 'James', 'Dean', 'tough', 'spirit', 'capture', 'Which', 'why', 'not-so-long-ago', 'T.V', 'biopic', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Rydell', 'staring', 'James', 'Franco', 'spot-on', 'channeling', 'Dean', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'indeed', 'available', 'CD', 'McHattie', 'was', 'good', 'Franco', 'superb.This', 'video', 'similar', 'often', 'found', 'supermarket', 'bins', 'filled', 'films', 'public', 'domain', 'are', 'great', 'deal', 'excellent', 't.v', 'films', 'are', 'slowly', 'seeping', 'public', 'view', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'leading', 'way', 'CD', 'JAMES', 'DEAN', 'one', 'anyone', 'interested', 'creative', 'process', 'genius', 'might', 'say', 'lost', 'star', 'should', 'take', 'close', 'look']",N/A
