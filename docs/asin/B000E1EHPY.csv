I bought it for the pilot,an episode of Police Story and I was a huge Police Story fan. The foolish powers that be have not seen fit to release Police Story to the public and I had to get some of it where ever it was available. The pleasant surprise to me however was how enjoyable I found the show to be. Granted the story line is remarkably similar episode to episode but the ensemble is very entertaining. As a middle aged man I find I often love shows I didn't like as a child, and can't sit through shows I adored at age 10. I think any fan of 1970's crime dramas will do well to buy Police Woman.

The scripts are boring, disjointed, and there is only about 30 seconds of real action in each episode I saw.I looked at the episodes on the first two discs, they were boring, nothing but talk. Looked at disk 3 and this would not play at all.  Finally got rid them in the bin where rubbish belongs, a total waste of money.  Even the Pilot episode taken from the POLICE STORY Series was slow, no action. If I had been able to see the pilot episode before buying I would have saved my money.  Regrettably now, I ordered the 1st series of POLICE STORY before I received POLICE WOMAN, I expect this (hopefully wrong) to be the same kind of boring materialwhen it arrives.

I realize it prob doesn't sell huge numbers but I hope us fans aren't left in the cold over the show - it really is a great to see again. I'm ready for more!Fans of this show should buy Season 1 so we can maybe get the rest of the show. For some odd reason Sony didn't do the best with pricing on the set. Yes it is retail 49.99 39.99 would have been better to help sell the show BUT I still think it was worth every cent. However for some odd reason the very day the show was released all of the Best Buy stores that stocked the set had it priced $49.99 which was retail That was it! Not Best Buys fault but Sony for what they had it priced at towards retailers. In the end it drove sales of the show to be very weak. it is a real shame the show is great .. Sure it doesn't have the power of selling like shows that are still airing today but had DVD been released back in Police Womans day then you would have seen sales like Desperate Housewives etc.Sony Should release the remaining seasons for fans. Finish what you begin .. don't release a season of a show and move on to something else.

In some ways, POLICE WOMAN is surprisingly violent. When was the last time you saw an episode of a cop show where a bank robber shoots a witness with a shotgun? And in that same episode, the POLICE use shotguns to blow people away. The controversial lesbian episode, FLOWERS OF EVIL, (which was only shown once on TV) is very entertaining and nothingthat GLAAD would get upset about. In fact, one of the final scenes has Angie getting one of the women to confess by relating that she isn't shocked or judgmental and in fact had a gay roommate in college who fell in love with her. The colors on the show are vibrant and the acting is swell with lots of fun guest stars (William Shatner, Larry Hagman, Bob Crane, Rhonda Fleming, Monte Markham, Marian Mercer, William Katt, Smokey Robinson, Della Reese, Robert Vaughn, Lara Parker, etc). Best of all is the numerous commentaries--two solo one with Angie Dickinson butthe majority with Angie and Earl Holliman chatting. Their great chemistry is still strong 30 years later...esspecially when they start bickering over facts (their Who's On First-like monologue about Mark Harman is laugh-out-loud funny; and Angie still has an infectious laugh--at one point she laughs at a piece of dialogue and just cant stop laughing).

965057,A1BICROS328E6G,B000E1EHPY,S. Firtch,"[18, 19]","In the mid-1970's Police Woman was one of my favorite shows.  I longed to grow up to be like Angie Dickinson, and admired her so.  (I still do).  Earl Holliman was gorgeous too!  It is so nice to see this show on DVD.  The cast and chemistry were fantastic--especially between Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman.  Except for the occasional use of 70's phrases--like ""Turkey"" and ""pad,"" some of the guys' sideburns, and Charles Dierkopf's (I am probably spelling that wrong) funky hat, the show has held up well.  It does not appear obviously outdated the way some other 70's shows do.  The stories are typical 70's--drugs, hookers, murderers and rapists--with time spent on character development, rather than on forensics and technical stuff. Well written and acted. The presentation on this set is very nice for the price.  There are 3 clear slim plastic cases inside the master case.  Each one has a different paper insert with a great photo of Angie Dickinson on the inside, and one on the outside.  There are really 3 photos--all from the same shoot, but different poses, and they are alternated so that the outside of one is the inside of another, etc. The discs themselves look very nice too.  The whole set looks classy, particularly compared to the way some other shows are being released (for example, the dismal job Universal did with the presentation of MacMillan & Wife).  Someone put care and thought into the Police Woman set, and it shows.  I have just finished watching 1 1/2 disks over a rainy weekend, and the quality has been terriffic. The picture is clear and bright, and the sound is crisp.  They even included the little promo bits that used to show before each episode (or as coming attactions after the previous show). I like that! As aonther person already pointed out--the show had a really great theme song.  I have to say that after all this time, I really only remember bits of one or two episodes, so I can't say if the episodes are in order, or cut or anything.  However, if anything is cut (and I don't know that it was) it was done seamlessly, because nothing appears to be missing.  This is a class act of a set!  I highly recommend it. I'm going back to watch the rest!  Can't wait for Season 2.***************After writing this, I watched one of the ""special features.""  It was fabulous--it was an entire episode, with a running audio commentary by Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman as they sat and watched it together!  It was so neat to listen to them chat and comment!!

I have to admit that I did'nt remember much about this show during it's orginal run, because I was just a kid, but to be taken back to my favorite time warp was FABULOUS!!! Only Philip Michael Thomas could still look fine as wine in a pink three-piece suit!!! Right on Baby!!!Angie Dickinson was so cool as Pepper Anderson. She kicked butt and nabbed the bad guys and girls for that matter, BCA (Before Charlie's Angels). Angie also had a dynamite supporting cast, and I just loved when Sargeant Styles played her pimp ""Silky""! He could be my pimp anytime!!!Although this season is filled with some really strong episodes, I absolutely hated when Pepper wore a wire.

Put her together with Earl Holliman and you have a female/male team that never gets old, always seems fresh and real and human.

965062,A3ILFAT3HHYOXE,B000E1EHPY,widowedwalker,"[83, 84]","In 1975, this became the hottest show in the United States and many other countries, and ALSO became the first successful drama series in TV history to feature a woman in the title role.And although this may sound like faint praise, in an era where Emma Peel had regrettably become a faded memory, if it hadn't been for ""Police Woman"", there literally would have been no (albeit more-fanciful) ""Charlies Angels"", ""Wonder Woman"", ""Bionic Woman"" or, a few years later, muscular ""Cagney & Lacey"".But suffice it to say that Season 1 of ""Police Woman"" is easily its best year: the show was, for the period, edgy and focused, with Angie Dickinson (then) chewing the scenery with a mesmerizing blend of toughness and effervesence; and her chemistry with co-star and onscreen boss Earl Holliman is very good as well... In this freshman season, ""Police Woman"" often felt like a taut, foreboding movie, both dark and sun-streaked... No wonder it went to Number One for a few months that summer.Subsequent seasons weren't quite the same... There was pressure to tone down Miss Dickinson's almost effortless sex-appeal, and in so caving to pressure, the series wound-up squelching her personal power and strength as well, and so the show went off-track a bit: as a result, only about 50% of the episodes of seasons 2 and 3 are really up to par, and season 4 contained just a small handful of good installments.Perhaps all that's why the show seems to have disappeared from view for quite a while...Regardless, season 1 is an absolutely great '70s cop show classic-- funny, dramatic, a bit shocking for TV (at the time) in places, with a moody and often-cinematic '70s flavor--- and Angie Dickinson and Earl Holliman NEVER had such a good vehicle.4/17/06: Unfortunately, no one seems to know it's on DVD, and the mediocre sales reflect that.
