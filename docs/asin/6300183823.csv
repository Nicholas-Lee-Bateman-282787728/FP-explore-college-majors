If you know and love Edward Abbey, the whole story clicks into his perspective.  Even so, the spine of the story is rather clunky and under motivated, with preposterous situations.  Abbey was digging deeper into the basic point than anyone else, and focused on that rather than on the overall demands of storytelling.  Yet that in itself adds magically to the charm of this movie, which deconstructs the assumptions of modern sensibilities, showing how they don't fit so well with anyone determined to be free.  There were other naturalists and environmentalists before Abbey, but none so militant.  Lots of funny, brainy, engaging aspects throughout the story.Kirk Douglas hired Dalton Trumbo to write the screenplay, and insisted that Trumbo be openly credited, which Douglas says broke the blacklist.  Kirk was a real humanist, and you can see in this movie, among his favorites, how closely he identifies with the central character.

I had heard that it was a good adaptation, but what I was not prepared for was the emotionally-charged way in which Kirk Douglas acted the part of Jack Burns.  Douglas has repeatedly called this his favorite movie, and in fact it was one which the studio was not going to produce, but which a clause in Douglas's contract allowed him to make.  In watching the film, you can definitely see Douglas's love for the part.Jack Burns is a man from a dying era.  Caught in a world of highways, steel-barred prisons, and barbed-wire fences, Burns is unable to adapt himself to modern life, and pays for his failure to compromise his cowboy ideals.  Burns is a true cowboy--tough, uncompromising, and good-hearted--but this movie shows that there isn't always a place for such people in today's society.  In the ultimate showdown between horse and horsepower, there is little question of which will win.This movie is splendidly done.  The directing and acting is great, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  Seeing all that rugged terrain really brings Abbey's novel to life.  This is not only one of the few movies that remains true to the book on which it is based, it is also one of the great underrated classics in film.",4,A great adaptation of Edward Abbey's novel,1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,1296,"['decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'reading', 'book', 'Brave', 'Cowboy', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'good', 'adaptation', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'was', 'emotionally-charged', 'way', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'acted', 'part', 'Jack', 'Burns', 'Douglas', 'repeatedly', 'called', 'favorite', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'studio', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'produce', 'clause', 'Douglas', 'contract', 'allowed', 'make', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'Douglas', 'love', 'part.Jack', 'Burns', 'man', 'dying', 'era', 'Caught', 'world', 'highways', 'steel-barred', 'prisons', 'barbed-wire', 'fences', 'Burns', 'unable', 'adapt', 'modern', 'life', 'pays', 'failure', 'compromise', 'cowboy', 'ideals', 'Burns', 'true', 'cowboy', 'tough', 'uncompromising', 'good-hearted', 'movie', ""n't"", 'always', 'place', 'such', 'people', 'today', 'society', 'ultimate', 'showdown', 'horse', 'horsepower', 'little', 'question', 'will', 'win.This', 'movie', 'splendidly', 'done', 'directing', 'acting', 'great', 'scenery', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Seeing', 'rugged', 'terrain', 'really', 'Abbey', 'novel', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'true', 'book', 'based', 'also', 'one', 'great', 'underrated', 'classics', 'film']",N/A
204063,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6300183823,Bomojaz,"[2, 5]","Kirk Douglas as the outcast cowboy in a modern world that has squeezed his kind out - though he goes down fighting. It's a familiar role in American movies: think of Bogart in ""Casablanca"" or Eastwood as ""Dirty Harry,"" each the loner in a world that expects conformity. Although the movie gets off to a shaky start with Douglas purposely getting arrested in order to help a friend bust out of the slammer (the friend would rather just serve his time), once Douglas breaks out himself and takes to the hills on his horse, the movie really picks up. Pursued by sheriff Walter Matthau, who secretly admires Douglas's gumption and individuality, Douglas is able to outwit him and his battery of modern appliances - until the night he and his horse are run over by an 18-wheeler while crossing a highway. The irony of that is unmistakable. Douglas admired this picture a lot, and he plays the part of Jack Burns with great vigor and respect. Somewhat ahead of its time regarding the anti-hero fighting the ""establishment,"" the movie set an early precedent of what would become a mainstream theme only a handful of years later.

The myriad laws governing polite behavior confuse him. He's his own man, and this is the story of his last attempt and failure in encountering modern life. For most of the movie, its the cowboy and his horse against the world, in a fascinating struggle of old ways against new, old values of rugged independence against new sensibilities of conforming, rustic techniques of fitting into nature against new technologies.Kirk Douglass was exceptionally proud of this film, and its easy to see why. It wasn't the blockbuster type story, it didn't have a conventional ending. It was a deep character study of a man who can at the same time frustrate you and grab your admiration. It fit perfectly with Douglass' policy of playing hard edged characters who weren't easy to like. He found a unique role, and he excelled in it.Not everyone will like this film.

204067,A3DSTOJPRMV674,6300183823,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[159, 162]","It is difficult to imagine a film like &quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; being released today. Everything about this near-forgotten 1962 semi-classic seems unconventional. A bittersweet ending, a flawed hero/protagonist, quirky law enforcement officials, character-establishing scenes which move slowly though perceptibly, underlying brutality (during a vicious barroom brawl) and a thematic mourning for a time long since passed. And of course the film is in black and white.Like great poetry, the film &quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; must be savored several times, it's taste acquired, it's ideas earned through thought and contemplation. Quite simply, the film is one of the finest westerns ever made.A simple tale, though with crisp dialogue and underlying substance, &quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; tells the story of the modern-day loner cowboy Jack Burns, brilliantly played by Kirk Douglas. Upon his horse, Burns rides into a dusty New Mexico town to visit old friends, dodging speeding cars on a highway. He soon discovers his best friend, a childhood chum he used to carouse with, has been jailed for transporting illegal immigrants from Mexico. In the blink of an eye, Douglas has himself arrested in an attempt to help his buddy break out of jail.But his friend refuses, instead choosing the life of a family man, wishing to return to his wife and child as soon as possible. Douglas promptly breaks out of jail, deciding to cross the mountains into Mexico and wait for &quot;things to blow over.&quot; A chase ensues, with a relaxed sheriff (superbly played by a young Walter Matthau) trying to cut off &quot;the cowboy.&quot; The chase contrasts the loner (Douglas) on horseback in the mountains versus the modern-day technology of radios, helicopters, the U.S. military and jeeps.But it is the small scenes in &quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; that truly give the film its depth and status. A quiet moment as Douglas pauses at the bedroom door of his friend's son, perhaps imagining what his life could have been under different circumstances; a firm hug and kiss with his friend's wife (Gena Rowlands in one of her earliest roles) insinuating past love; a conversation with a mountain squirrel while waiting for a helicopter to fly past; a humorous soliloquy while washing his hands discussing the variety of signs hanging from a barbed wire fence; and other telling, comfortable scenes creating a character of fierce independence trapped within a shrinking land of convention.&quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; harkens back to a time of literate drama and well-written dialogue born of the theater and literature. It is also a film that, like its protagonist, slowly moves along the trail until its inevitable, heartbreaking conclusion. But that's the way it should be. Kirk Douglas' character wouldn't have it any other way.&quot;Lonely are the Brave&quot; is an unforgettable film. If you have not seen this gem before, you are in for a western treat.",5,"A unique, unforgettable classic",1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2967,"['difficult', 'imagine', 'film', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'quot', 'being', 'released', 'today', 'Everything', 'near-forgotten', '1962', 'semi-classic', 'unconventional', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'flawed', 'hero/protagonist', 'quirky', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'character-establishing', 'scenes', 'move', 'slowly', 'perceptibly', 'underlying', 'brutality', 'vicious', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'thematic', 'mourning', 'time', 'long', 'passed', 'course', 'film', 'black', 'white.Like', 'great', 'poetry', 'film', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'quot', 'must', 'be', 'savored', 'several', 'times', 'taste', 'acquired', 'ideas', 'earned', 'thought', 'contemplation', 'Quite', 'simply', 'film', 'one', 'finest', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made.A', 'simple', 'tale', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'underlying', 'substance', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'quot', 'story', 'modern-day', 'loner', 'cowboy', 'Jack', 'Burns', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'horse', 'Burns', 'dusty', 'New', 'Mexico', 'town', 'visit', 'old', 'friends', 'dodging', 'speeding', 'cars', 'highway', 'soon', 'best', 'friend', 'childhood', 'chum', 'used', 'carouse', 'been', 'jailed', 'transporting', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'Mexico', 'blink', 'eye', 'Douglas', 'arrested', 'attempt', 'help', 'buddy', 'break', 'jail.But', 'friend', 'instead', 'choosing', 'life', 'family', 'man', 'wishing', 'return', 'wife', 'child', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Douglas', 'promptly', 'jail', 'deciding', 'cross', 'mountains', 'Mexico', 'wait', 'quot', 'things', 'blow', 'over.', 'quot', 'chase', 'relaxed', 'sheriff', 'superbly', 'played', 'young', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'trying', 'cut', 'off', 'quot', 'cowboy.', 'quot', 'chase', 'loner', 'Douglas', 'horseback', 'mountains', 'modern-day', 'technology', 'radios', 'helicopters', 'U.S.', 'military', 'jeeps.But', 'small', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'quot', 'truly', 'give', 'film', 'depth', 'status', 'quiet', 'moment', 'Douglas', 'bedroom', 'door', 'friend', 'son', 'perhaps', 'imagining', 'what', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'circumstances', 'firm', 'hug', 'kiss', 'friend', 'wife', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'insinuating', 'past', 'love', 'conversation', 'mountain', 'squirrel', 'waiting', 'helicopter', 'fly', 'past', 'humorous', 'soliloquy', 'washing', 'hands', 'discussing', 'variety', 'signs', 'hanging', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'other', 'telling', 'comfortable', 'scenes', 'creating', 'character', 'fierce', 'independence', 'trapped', 'shrinking', 'land', 'convention.', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'quot', 'back', 'time', 'literate', 'drama', 'well-written', 'dialogue', 'born', 'theater', 'literature', 'also', 'film', 'protagonist', 'slowly', 'trail', 'inevitable', 'heartbreaking', 'conclusion', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way.', 'quot', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'quot', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'gem', 'are', 'western', 'treat']",N/A

A year later you would know Rausch as the one-armed man Dr. Richard Kimble chased for 4 seasons on ""The Fugitive."" Adapted from,""Brave Cowboy,"" a simple story about a drifter-cowboy who didn't like fences, this is more fleshed out, with Kirk Douglas trying to  talk sense into his friend, by breaking in jail with him, a plausible sub-plot to explain his visit. Douglas has some touching scenes with Gena Rowlands where, at times, he struggles with his conscience and allegiance to his friend. Nevertheless, Douglas escapes and the entire locals pursue. Douglas and his valiant horse outwit all armed forces aganst him as he ascends the mountains to freedom, leading to a terrifying, heart-wrenching climax on a rain-swept highway. The on-lccation scenes are sparingly shot, symbolically at times, never slowing the suspense. There are poetic moments and moments of stark violence, handled with deft assurance.

The film, if anything, was much more powerful and emotional than I remembered.  All of the performances were first rate, but Douglas clearly gave the best performance of his life.  I'm not surprised that it is his favorite film.  It's too bad he (and the film) got no recognition at the time.  I like a lot of Douglas's films, but he never did anything as natural or convincing as this.  I know he wasn't thrilled with the director, David Miller, but I can't fault his direction; some of the shots are beautifully framed and they used lenses that kept everything in focus, both what is close up and what is far away, which works beautifully in those sweeping scenes of the mountains and valleys during the getaway sequence.  The script by Dalton Trumbo (whom Douglas got off the Hollywood blacklist on ""Spartacus"") is perfect, and Jerry Goldsmith's spare score is one of his best. A lot of the players were unknown at the time, but later became stars, like Carrol O'Connor, Walter Mathau, Gena Rowlands and George Kennedy.  All played their roles to a ""T"".  This film has often been praised as a ""little gem,"" but there's nothing little about it.  It is the bittersweet story of a man out of his time, but desperately fighting to preserve his way of life, even after it has clearly vanished.

Now, I see in it an individual very much like cowboys who were around in my childhood; fiercely independent, hard-drinking, hard-working men who, because of their disdain for fences, rules, and conformity, are themselves responsible for being alone. They are men who were born too late, who are old fashioned cowboys in a West where round-ups are now by helicoptor and ATR vehicles. A man on horseback, as a way of life, is rapidly fading away. You can see that sadness and loneliness in this film. That the hero in the film could actually believe that he could out-run modern police pursuit on horseback only adds poignancy; he is really trying to out-run modern times and loss of individuality.

Unlike the airborne jet fighters, which are mesmeric because they reject boundaries in the vast openness of space above him, yet are still regimented, Jack's spirit for autonomy and independence that drive him, in actuality, restricts him to a life of confrontation and struggle. Nonconformity is Jack's fix. The battle grounds that lay before him are set in limited space and race against time. Still, his quench for self-rule heartens this rugged cowboy's risk taking while clashing with accord and conformity.Jack's mode of transportation - an unruly horse named Whiskey, is a far cry from those jet fighters. In a sense, he is one of those pilots on a mission of his own. Whiskey represents Jack's uncultivated character. Like the jets that defy gravity, both man and animal are at odds with each other because of their self-determination, which proves to be their eventual collapse, despite their mutual respect in a world neither belongs.Ultimately, Sheriff Johnson (Walter Matthau), Jack's nemesis, determined to bring him in by any means he can marshal, including dismissing the Army General, may be the only person who truly understands Jack, aside from Jack's imprisoned friend's wife (classy Gena Rowlands) who clearly loves him. Johnson realizes, perhaps too late, that any man willing to die for liberty deserves to be set free.I first saw this film as a child when it was released in theatres during the early sixties. This is not only my favorite Kirk Douglas film, but my personal favorite unparalleled American film. It is a tender movie that must be experienced to value its natural poignancy.

It attempts to eulogize the death of the ""wide open spaces"", the loss of the alleged ""simple life"" and unfettered freedom of the mythical West, while begging us to empathize with an ""anti-heroic"" cowboy, played by Kirk Douglas.However, upon reflection, Douglas' character seems reckless and obnoxious, even. His apparent macho disregard for authority reeks of a childish compulsion to have his own way at any cost. He is an outcast not because he rebels, but because his rebellion is selfish. He commits himself to nothing and to no one, so his non-conformist actions ultimately seem foolish and suicidal.If his character stands for anything, it could only be for a way of life that is rootless, greedy and arrogant. What happens to him in the end, is what you would expect to happen to a man who behaved as though he could do whatever he wanted, when and wherever he wanted to do it. If he was lonely, it wasn't because he was brave, but because he was a user and a taker, two ways of being that typically don't win you friends. And Hollywood tries to make those repellent and unattractive personal traits look charming and noble and ""heroic.""Besides, as a nation, we threw away our only chance to enjoy the simple life when we attempted to exterminate the very people who could have taught us how to live it: the aboriginal indigenous people of the North and South American continents.",1,An awkward attempt at myth-making,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,1485,"['Lonely', 'Are', 'Brave', 'dishonest', 'mixed-up', 'piece', 'misplaced', 'nostalgia', 'sentimentality', 'eulogize', 'death', 'wide', 'open', 'spaces', 'loss', 'alleged', 'simple', 'life', 'unfettered', 'freedom', 'mythical', 'West', 'begging', 'empathize', 'anti-heroic', 'cowboy', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Douglas.However', 'reflection', 'Douglas', 'character', 'reckless', 'obnoxious', 'even', 'apparent', 'macho', 'disregard', 'authority', 'reeks', 'childish', 'compulsion', 'have', 'own', 'way', 'cost', 'outcast', 'not', 'rebellion', 'selfish', 'nothing', 'one', 'non-conformist', 'actions', 'ultimately', 'seem', 'foolish', 'suicidal.If', 'character', 'anything', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'way', 'life', 'rootless', 'greedy', 'arrogant', 'What', 'end', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'happen', 'man', 'who', 'behaved', 'could', 'do', 'wanted', 'when', 'wherever', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'lonely', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'brave', 'was', 'user', 'taker', 'two', 'ways', 'being', 'typically', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'friends', 'Hollywood', 'tries', 'make', 'repellent', 'unattractive', 'personal', 'traits', 'look', 'charming', 'noble', 'heroic', 'Besides', 'nation', 'threw', 'away', 'only', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'simple', 'life', 'when', 'attempted', 'exterminate', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'taught', 'how', 'live', 'aboriginal', 'indigenous', 'people', 'North', 'South', 'American', 'continents']",N/A

One that never back down from a fight and is willing to put himself on the line-each and every time.  If he's in the frame your eyes are on him.  I agree with other reviewers, this is a very simple storyline about small events that quickly get out of hand.  There are quite a bit of coincidences-and you just can't help wondering why he told the police his real name-since the plan was always to break out of jail.

One of the best films ever made. It is, in fact, Kirk Douglas' favorite film out of all the great ones he has made. Impeccably directed, written, acted, paced and with a Jerry Goldsmith music score that should be on CD, this film is a moving must-see.  Part ""Western,"" part family drama, part prison film, part chase, ""Lonely are the Brave"" is a low-key epic simply but boldly depicting the age-old conflict of the Individual versus Conformity.  They really do not make movies like this anymore.  Don't miss it!  Try to see it the way all films should be seen - with knowing as little as possible about it...if that is possible to do at all.  Even the back of the DVD gives away much of the plotline.The extras are better than nothing, but could have been better still.  It would have been nice to know more about the actual making of the movie - but to see Kirk and son Michael and the grand Gena Rowlands talk of this quiet masterpiece is priceless in itself.

204092,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,6300183823,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 17]","I'm going to give this film three stars because thus far noone else has given the film simply three stars. My ratingwill be the 75 on this film. Of the ratings, 65 are 5 stars, 8 are 4 stars and one is a 1 star rating. I'm going to go straight up the middle with my rating at 3 stars.I give this movie 3 stars for the following reasons. First, I doubt seriously that I saw all of the film. I watchedthis film on the AMC channel and there were constant commercials. The commercials were a constant nuisance. Second, I give the film 3 stars only because it was fairly predictable in its outcome. I didn't think Kirk Douglas would succeed in the end. Still the movie was quite entertaining. I especially loved seeing all of the familiar actors.First George Kennedy was a policeman, a role he has played many times. The unbelieveable part of Kennedy's role was to try to make him Spanish. When I first saw Kennedy at the jail I can't recall that he acted or talked at all with a Spanish accent, but later in the film he was trying to be Spanish and with an accent. Second, it was very cool to see Walter Matthau as a sheriff. He played that part well. Another familiar face was of Carrol O' Connor who portrayed a trucker hauling as he called it ""privies"", or bathroom furnishing. I knew that O' Connor would be back to play a promiinent part in the film because he kept appearing in the film for some apparrent reason. In any other film he might have appearred once as a driver stopping for lunch and then leaving for the next town. And finally, Bill Bixby was in the film as a co-pilot in a helicopter.The film consists of the Douglas character getting into a bar fight and going to the jail. The jail was full up so they were going to let him go so Douglas slugged it out with the police to be thrown into jail. In jail he was to see someone he knew, perhaps his friend or his brother. I'm not really sure who the guy was but Douglas had come to bust him out. Douglas smuggled two hacksaw blades into the cell inside of his boot. Douglas cut the bar and made it back to his friends girlfriend where he had left his horse. Douglas fled into the mountains on horseback to evade the police. Douglas was trying to get to Mexico. In the end Douglas and his horse are hit by O' Connor's truck. The horse is shot and Douglas is sent to the hospital.I agree with ""L Spain"" who gave the movie 1 star. Douglas was an anti-hero, arrogant, lawbreaking, wild, and he brought the tragic end upon himself. All I am saying is that Douglas' character shouldn't be embraced as some sort of hero. The movie is trying to portray the old world clashing with the new world. Douglas was a throwback, a cowboy, a man who roamed the hills and plains on horseback cutting fences when he came upon them.The film is interesting and entertaining but I don't think it quite sold the character of Douglas. Douglas does a fine job of acting but he cannot redeem the character of an arrogant and selfish man who merely wanted to live his life by his own rules.The final shot of the film has Douglas's cowboy hat in the highway as rain falls. That shot tells you everything. At least the shot didn't include a car running over the cowboy hat. Other ways the conflict of machinery versus man were developed included the horse vs. the jeep, chewing tobbacco vs. chewing gum, the commitment of the guy in jail to his girlfriend, and Douglas's lack of commitment to anyone. I'm sure there is probably more to movie but as I said, my viewing was interrupted with commercials and it may have been edited as well.All in all Douglas played the typical western tough guy, but in this picture he is not out in the old west but playing in the America as it was in 1962.

204093,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6300183823,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[5, 7]","No Western could be more out of time-scale than ""Lonely are the Brave,"" and yet, paradoxically, no central character was ever more truly Western than Jack Burns, the strange wanderer, played by Kirk Douglas...Douglas in this film version of Edward Abbey's moving novel 'Brave Cowboy' is, among a number of other things, a man who hates barbed wire... He showed, a similar dislike for it in King Vidor's ""Man Without a Star"" (1955), which was a traditional cattle range movie, and in those circumstances that seemed reasonable enough... But ""Lonely are the Brave"" is a film set in the New Mexico of 1953 and such behavior now seems totally irrational...But then he's an irrational, quite extraordinary man... He rides a horse called Whisky when the world flashes past him in Cadillacs... He carries a guitar and sings folksy ballads of the old West... Arriving in the concrete of Duke City he is quite confident that in order to free a pal he has only got to break into jail, fool a sheriff and make his getaway... After all, it's Western territory and this was always the way of it...Who and what is he? The question bears examination for he is one of the most intriguing characters in the whole Western portrait gallery... He is never really explained in the book, nor indeed in the film... He is drawn and stated and the rest is left to the reader or audience... You watch the way he moves, you listen to what he says and the way he says it... You observe his strange actions and reactions... But most1y you are left to make your own conclusions...Is it a case of a fantasist totally hooked on the Western legend? Has he seen too many Western movies (probably 'B' features)? Has he read too much Western pulp fiction? Is he so deep in thought by it all that he is incapable of realizing that the world has moved on, is running out of grass, or tolerance for oddballs with a preference for grass?Is he making a protest about what the West has become, and is seeking, in his inarticulate way, after different values? Is he just pure throwback, a man belonging to another time? This figures, as he might say... He would belong so splendidly, with his simple values...Whatever he is, he's a profoundly tragic conception....The old friend he is there to aid (Michael Kane) has been jailed for giving shelter to over-the-border illegal immigrants... Douglas calls on his buddy's wife, sensitively played by Gena Rowlands, who seems as touched and dazed by him as anyone in the audience... In order to get Kane out of prison he decides that he first needs to get into it himself and so after a saloon bar fight, followed by more fisticuffs at the jail, he gets the cell he wants...In jail, however, he finds himself once more knocking up against the twentieth century--its mores and inhibitions... The pal doesn't want to conform to the old Western pattern by making a break for it... Far better to serve out his two years and then return to his wife and child knowing that his 'debt to society' has been paid and they will have nothing else to worry about... This is not just pure self-interest... He honestly thinks it the right thing to do...So having fought his way in, Douglas now has to fight his way out... This he does with the aid of files he brought with him to effect his friend's escape... And out with him go a couple of characters not inhibited by fears and scruples...So he becomes a man on the run, but, since he still has his horse, an old-style outlaw on the run, heading for the mountains with--naturally--a posse after him...But no ordinary posse... This is the 20th century version, supplied with all sorts of technological devices... If this very recent cowboy in his strange, ancient times way, is challenging the rule of technology, it is only logical that the long cold arm of science should reach out for him... It does so with walkie-talkie radios, jeeps and even a specially borrowed helicopter...What chance has he? The sheriff seems puzzled by the situation--that a man on a horse should dare everything against such a formidable array of gadgetry... Since the enigmatic wanderer is determinedly playing out a Western drama he must inevitably come up against a compassionate sheriff...The sheriff is a man doing a job, without any keen enjoyment for the job or, in fact, for anything particularly... He's bored, skeptical, laconic, and you feel that he would like nothing better than for Burns to get out of his territory...But while the sheriff goes about his manhunting duties in a routine way he lets slip another implication--that deep, down in the lethargy and disillusion there's a soft spot for the man on a horse... Is the sheriff at heart--if you could ever find his heart--a bit of a rebel, too?Kirk Douglas will be remembered most of all for his performance as the man out of step, out of his proper time... His Jack Burns in ""Lonely are the Brave"" is one of the warmest, most deeply felt characterizations in all Western movies... David Miller directed the film with simplicity and a similar warmth...

204094,AQE41QO3NEUMW,6300183823,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[5, 6]","Edward Abbey wrote ""The Brave Cowboy"" (1956) on which screenwriter Dalton Trumbo based his script for this 1962 movie adaptation. And Trumbo did a fine job of focusing in on what's translatable to cinema in Abbey's novel. His script, meanwhile, is well served by veteran movie director David Miller, especially in the action scenes, and excellent black and white cinematography. The casting directors couldn't have known at the time, but they picked a supporting cast for lead star Kirk Douglas, many of whom went on to distinguished careers in film and television - Gena Rowlands, Walter Matthau, Carroll O'Connor, and George Kennedy.For me, the most stunning scenes in the film are the pursuit of Douglas and his horse across a New Mexico mountainscape. Loose rocks tumble down a steep incline, toward the camera, as the two of them struggle precariously upward, the horse expressing terror and confusion and the cowboy a kind of foolhardy courage. The irony and ambiguity of Abbey's ""brave cowboy"" is expressed dramatically and cinematically in these scenes.Lovers of the novel, however, have to be disappointed in other aspects of the film, for it truncates and simplifies the character of the sheriff, played by Matthau, who is a central character through long segments of the novel. While Kirk Douglas is fine, the part calls for a much younger actor, someone who can play youthful confidence and idealism more plausibly. At the ripe old age of 45, he has the appearance of a man who should have outgrown the impulsiveness that the part calls for.Abbey readers will also note that Hollywood has reduced the political charge in Abbey's book by having one of its main characters imprisoned for transporting Mexicans illegally into the U.S. In the novel, both he and the cowboy played by Douglas are guilty of not registering for the draft, which as a plot device was a bit early for the young Vietnam era audience it might have appealed to. Finally, both film and novel can leave the viewer a little puzzled by how to measure the rugged individualism of Abbey's cowboy. In the closing chapter of the novel, it is the cowboy's love of his friend that seems to be what has motivated him. In the film, there is a good deal more heat and physical attraction between him and his friend's wife, played by Rowlands. And there are no final words in the last scene as a clue to his ""brave"" behavior.It's a fine film, nonetheless. With others who have reviewed it here, I look forward to a DVD release.

It's a tale of the passing of the old West and the disappearance of men--independent men--who couldn't or wouldn't change.Douglas--Jack Burns--in the film is a man intolerant of rules, fences and civilization.  He's a cowboy with an ideology.  His sense of honor is antequated, perhaps, but all the more powerful because of it.  In the interest of freedom he makes a series of preventable and deliberate mistakes.  He breaks into jail to save an old friend, only to find that his friend doesn't want saving.  Burns then breaks out of jail to be pursued across the desert and into the mountains by all the modern police contraptions.Burns, of course, is doomed by both fate and history and we realize, long before the heartrending conclusion, that he will fail.

I suspect the criticism many have of the film is actually a testimony to the film's power to move audiences.  But because it doesn't provide the expected, virtually required, formulaic Hollywood happy ending, viewers feel compelled to rationalize their disappointment into a denial of the film.Combine Thomas Hardy's poem &quot;Convergence of the Twain&quot; with William Blake's criticism of modern industrial life in &quot;London&quot; and insert a story about the &quot;last American cowboy,&quot; a rugged individualist in an imprisoning social order.

William Schallert - who may best be remembered as playing Patty Duke's dad on her TV show, is the Deputy and is often a cross between Don Knotts' Barney Fife and Jim Nabors' Gomer Pyle on The Andy Griffith Show"". The Black and white remastered Panavision print is crisp and sharp and the sound was the cleanest I've heard from my 30 year-old television's speakers.The added bonus on the 2009 DVD release is a 29 minute ""Tribute"" film with comments from both Douglas and his son, Michael, as well as Director Steven Spielberg - which includes a discussion of Darton Trumbo's script - plus a 9-minute discussion of Jerry Goldsmith's film score.Though I'd heard of the film over the years, this is the first time I've seen it.

I owned the VHS tape, then I got a Region 2 DVD in 2008.  I wonder if the new Region 1 DVD will be any different from the widescreen Region 2 version?UPDATE (1-9-10):  I finally got the newly released Universal update of this great film, and was mildly disappointed to discover that the Spanish [PAL] edition has better picture quality; I would also note, though, that the Spanish edition is approximately four minutes shorter.UPDATE (1-11-10):  After doing some research (PAL vs. NTSC, at ""[...]""), I discovered that the PAL film-to-dvd transfer process results in approximately 20% more pixilation ... ergo (I suppose), better picture quality.  I also discovered that--because of the nature of the film-to-dvd transfer process--a PAL film-to-dvd transfer will be shorter by 4% than an NTSC transfer.  Originally, I had assumed that the shorter (PAL) length version of ""Lonely are the Brave"" meant that there had been scene cuts.  I now believe that the PAL (103 minutes) and the NTSC (107 minutes) editions of this film are (essentially) carbon copies of each other, although the PAL version is shown in four less minutes.  [I'm not sure which version is truer to the actual original film length, but having watched both, I did not discern any (""speeded-like"", or ""slowed-like"", speech or dialogue) differences between them, except that (somehow) the PAL version does finish four minutes sooner].I would also note that the Spanish PAL edition does not have the extras (including an interview with Kirk Douglas) that the newly released Universal edition has.  Assuming, however, that the viewer has a region-free dvd player (that plays PAL), along with an hdtv that is 50"", or larger, (and cost is not a factor), the improved picture quality (of the Spanish edition) is--from my perspective--to be preferred over the Universal extras.",5,The sad side of progress,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,1961,"['Modern', 'civilization', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'let', 'cowpoke', 'live', 'wits', 'alone', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'heckuva', 'shot', 'Great', 'film', 'owned', 'VHS', 'tape', 'then', 'got', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', '2008', 'wonder', 'new', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'widescreen', 'Region', '2', 'version', 'UPDATE', '1-9-10', 'finally', 'got', 'newly', 'released', 'Universal', 'update', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'mildly', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'Spanish', '[', 'PAL', ']', 'edition', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'would', 'also', 'note', 'though', 'Spanish', 'edition', 'approximately', 'four', 'minutes', 'shorter.UPDATE', '1-11-10', 'doing', 'research', 'PAL', 'vs.', 'NTSC', '[', ']', 'discovered', 'PAL', 'film-to-dvd', 'transfer', 'process', 'results', 'approximately', '20', '%', 'more', 'pixilation', 'ergo', 'suppose', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'also', 'discovered', 'nature', 'film-to-dvd', 'transfer', 'process', 'PAL', 'film-to-dvd', 'transfer', 'will', 'be', 'shorter', '4', '%', 'NTSC', 'transfer', 'Originally', 'had', 'assumed', 'shorter', 'PAL', 'version', 'Lonely', 'are', 'Brave', 'meant', 'had', 'been', 'scene', 'cuts', 'now', 'believe', 'PAL', '103', 'minutes', 'NTSC', '107', 'minutes', 'editions', 'film', 'are', 'essentially', 'carbon', 'copies', 'other', 'PAL', 'version', 'shown', 'four', 'less', 'minutes', '[', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'version', 'truer', 'actual', 'original', 'film', 'length', 'having', 'watched', 'did', 'not', 'discern', 'speeded-like', 'slowed-like', 'speech', 'dialogue', 'differences', 'somehow', 'PAL', 'version', 'finish', 'four', 'minutes', 'sooner', ']', '.I', 'would', 'also', 'note', 'Spanish', 'PAL', 'edition', 'not', 'have', 'extras', 'including', 'interview', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'newly', 'released', 'Universal', 'edition', 'Assuming', 'however', 'viewer', 'region-free', 'dvd', 'player', 'PAL', 'hdtv', '50', 'larger', 'cost', 'not', 'factor', 'improved', 'picture', 'quality', 'Spanish', 'edition', 'perspective', 'be', 'preferred', 'Universal', 'extras']",N/A

There is a background image of some kids playing stick-ball or baseball or something that is just NOT a scene from the film.  Where did that come from? It is really not that important, but perhaps illustrates the lack of respect the film had, even with the company that released the DVD.Thanks to Kirk Douglas and his influence, we finally now have this movie on DVD.  I found the video and audio quality excellent.  If you love this film, this is the time to buy it, while it is still in print.As many others have pointed out, this is one great film.  There are few, if not NO, weaknesses.  Screenplay, acting, cinemetography, music, etc.  All are so tightly attuned to the story.  It is almost frightening to see just how well a movie can be made.At the same time as the film's debut on DVD, the music score by Goldsmith has also had a release (on Varese Sarabande CD).No, this movie would not likely get made today.
