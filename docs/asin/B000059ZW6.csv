575434,A3JMWIOTUBOJI7,B000059ZW6,Donkey Dick,"[3, 3]","Roy Scheider (as Cohen) and Adam Baldwin (as Tate) are bickering mob hit men who kidnap a 9-year old kid who witnessed a mob-related killing. They also kill his parents. Cohen is older and more logical, Tate is a violet hot-head who wants nothing more than to kill the little boy. Pretty much all of this film takes place over a few hours one night on the road, as the trio head back to the city. It's very tense, clever, and well-written, and delivers an unconventional, powerful ending. The kid is never annoying, only cries once, and is portrayed as calm and cunning without being ridiculously precocious. The only downfall is Adam Baldwin's amateurish, too-obvious, over-the-top performance, and that unfortunately prevents this from being a classic. Also, Baldwin spews expletives left and right, however many of them are badly dubbed over as &quot;sucker&quot; or &quot;freakin.&quot; That doesn't really make sense. But, at least Baldwin constantly threats the kid, hits him, and points giant guns in his face. That's fun. I really loved this film; you can get it cheap on VHS in a cut-out bin near you.",4,SCHEIDER 4 LIFE,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1110,"['Roy', 'Scheider', 'Cohen', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'Tate', 'are', 'bickering', 'mob', 'hit', 'men', 'who', 'kidnap', '9-year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'witnessed', 'mob-related', 'killing', 'also', 'kill', 'parents', 'Cohen', 'older', 'more', 'logical', 'Tate', 'violet', 'hot-head', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'kill', 'little', 'boy', 'Pretty', 'much', 'film', 'place', 'few', 'hours', 'one', 'night', 'road', 'trio', 'head', 'back', 'city', 'very', 'tense', 'clever', 'well-written', 'delivers', 'unconventional', 'powerful', 'ending', 'kid', 'never', 'annoying', 'only', 'once', 'portrayed', 'calm', 'cunning', 'being', 'ridiculously', 'precocious', 'only', 'downfall', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'amateurish', 'too-obvious', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'unfortunately', 'being', 'classic', 'Also', 'Baldwin', 'expletives', 'left', 'right', 'however', 'many', 'are', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'quot', 'sucker', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'Baldwin', 'constantly', 'kid', 'points', 'giant', 'guns', 'face', 'fun', 'really', 'loved', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'cheap', 'VHS', 'cut-out', 'bin']",N/A

575436,A2X25C107CSLOR,B000059ZW6,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[2, 7]","The best thing about writer director Eric Red's action film is Roy Scheider as one of the two kidnappers, hired to bring 9 year old gangland murder witness Harley Cross to Texas from the Oklahoma house in the open planes where he is laughably under FBI protection. Scheider's underplayed contempt for fellow kidnapper Adam Baldwin provides some amusement in this otherwise routine narrative. Baldwin's cartoon psychopath favours a huge gun which seems to be an expression of the greatness of his need for revenge. There is the suggestion that this gum-chewing adolescent-minded neurotic who has arias of blather is the product of abuse, in the way he reacts to Scheider's condemnation at one point like a wounded puppy, though this hardly makes him likeable, and Baldwin doesn't help by snarling. That the boy's allegiance should go towards Scheider may provoke an act of kindness, but we're fully aware that Cross is choosing the lesser of two fates. I like how Red presents Cross as not just an innocent, sparing us the details of the child's abduction, and having him using psychological games to pit the kidnappers against each other. Red's writing also features some gaping holes of credibility, where the boy's car door is left unlocked, when the first sign of trouble at the Oklahoma farm is the telephone being out but then Scheider uses it later to ring the gangland headquarters, having Scheider and Baldwin address each other as Mr Cohen and Mr Tate so that the boy can know their names (the comic effect wears thin very quickly), and Scheider not seeming to mind when Cross initially escapes from the kidnapper's car by striking Scheider in the back of the head. However on the plus side is one bloodbath mercifully avoided, and the climactic double pursuit, where a drilling site location with heavy machinery gets a payoff.",1,hired killers up against the deadliest force  - each other,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,1837,"['best', 'thing', 'writer', 'director', 'Eric', 'Red', 'action', 'film', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'one', 'two', 'kidnappers', 'hired', 'bring', '9', 'year', 'old', 'gangland', 'murder', 'witness', 'Harley', 'Cross', 'Texas', 'Oklahoma', 'house', 'open', 'planes', 'where', 'laughably', 'FBI', 'protection', 'Scheider', 'underplayed', 'contempt', 'fellow', 'kidnapper', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'amusement', 'otherwise', 'routine', 'narrative', 'Baldwin', 'cartoon', 'psychopath', 'huge', 'gun', 'be', 'expression', 'greatness', 'need', 'revenge', 'suggestion', 'gum-chewing', 'adolescent-minded', 'neurotic', 'who', 'arias', 'blather', 'product', 'abuse', 'way', 'Scheider', 'condemnation', 'one', 'point', 'wounded', 'puppy', 'hardly', 'likeable', 'Baldwin', ""n't"", 'help', 'snarling', 'boy', 'allegiance', 'should', 'go', 'towards', 'Scheider', 'may', 'provoke', 'act', 'kindness', ""'re"", 'fully', 'aware', 'Cross', 'choosing', 'lesser', 'two', 'fates', 'how', 'Red', 'presents', 'Cross', 'not', 'just', 'innocent', 'sparing', 'details', 'child', 'abduction', 'having', 'using', 'psychological', 'games', 'pit', 'kidnappers', 'other', 'Red', 'writing', 'also', 'gaping', 'holes', 'credibility', 'where', 'boy', 'car', 'door', 'left', 'unlocked', 'when', 'first', 'sign', 'trouble', 'Oklahoma', 'farm', 'telephone', 'being', 'out', 'then', 'Scheider', 'later', 'ring', 'gangland', 'headquarters', 'having', 'Scheider', 'Baldwin', 'address', 'other', 'Mr', 'Cohen', 'Mr', 'Tate', 'boy', 'can', 'know', 'names', 'comic', 'effect', 'wears', 'thin', 'very', 'quickly', 'Scheider', 'not', 'seeming', 'mind', 'when', 'Cross', 'initially', 'kidnapper', 'car', 'striking', 'Scheider', 'back', 'head', 'However', 'plus', 'side', 'one', 'bloodbath', 'mercifully', 'avoided', 'climactic', 'double', 'pursuit', 'where', 'drilling', 'site', 'location', 'heavy', 'machinery', 'payoff']",N/A

The story is very interesting and makes you listen as to what is going on. Some twist and turns with the hit men making a run after they shoot the witness and the guards not having a chance. Taking a hostage who causes more pain than they expected. Now its not boring as it has a bit off a pace but not too fast as to spoil a fantastic show. I rated this an A grade plus for a classic with plenty of suspense attached with the excitement that goes with it, and that keeps you glued to your chair not wanting to miss anything, so what are you waiting for, get to it and collect the popcorn, put your feet up for an great night for entertainment and enjoy.",5,Very Different,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,759,"['Love', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'tape', 'very', 'different', 'most', 'shows', 'bit', 'off', 'flair', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'listen', 'what', 'going', 'twist', 'hit', 'men', 'making', 'run', 'shoot', 'witness', 'guards', 'not', 'having', 'chance', 'Taking', 'hostage', 'who', 'more', 'pain', 'expected', 'Now', 'not', 'boring', 'bit', 'off', 'pace', 'not', 'too', 'fast', 'spoil', 'fantastic', 'show', 'rated', 'A', 'grade', 'plus', 'classic', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'attached', 'excitement', 'glued', 'chair', 'not', 'wanting', 'miss', 'anything', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'get', 'collect', 'popcorn', 'put', 'feet', 'up', 'great', 'night', 'entertainment', 'enjoy']",N/A
