If you are reading this for another format, then some of this information may not apply.Film:  4/5, Picture Quality:  4/5, Audio Quality:  5/5, Extras:  4/5, Overall:  4/5Quality:I can detect a slight amount of jagged lines, aliasing, pixilation, and banding. But it's very slight and small, and almost unnoticeable unless you got your face glued to the screen. It's just a slight problem for me; the image still looks insanely sharp and clean, with good-looking colors and contrast (once again, I don't see a problem with coloring). I seem to remember ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" having worse issues than this. Sound quality did not disappoint.Extras include a commentary, a bunch of documentaries, some games, a deleted scene, and plenty of other cool stuff. My copy came with a bonus DVD copy of the film as well.My copy also came with a slipcover.Film:Superheroes typically win the fight and get the girl in the end, but what happens when a supervillain succeeds? We see maybe a little bit of that scenario with ""Despicable Me,"" but ""Megamind"" throws superpowers and heroism in the mix to more effectively lampoon off of the ""Superman"" mythos. As a result, we get a rather intriguing premise, gracious amounts of action and eye-candy, and quite a few amusing laughs. The comedy's nice and slappy, with plenty of funny lines. Will Ferrell's style of humor works well for the movie. It's quite fun overall, and I'd put it on the same level as ""Monsters vs Aliens.""The story's pretty unique; it borrows a little from other sources, but once it gets going it develops a brilliant tale of deception and dramatic irony. The middle of the movie drags maybe a little, and the film overall feels a little hectic as it jumps from one mad situation to another, and then tossing one or two bizarre twists. But it all works out sublimely in the end. It also helps that the characters receive decent treatment with some solid emotional depth.The film shows strong animation quality. Movements are smooth, textures rendering and lighting are great, and the overall designs are stylish. It's similar in style and quality to ""Monsters vs Aliens."" Voice-acting seems good; Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, Ben Stiller, are all decent. Music features a lot of rock songs, which seem a little arbitrary, but usually do fit their given scenes.4/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",4,"""Bad guys always LOSE!""",1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,2419,"['2-D', 'Blu-Ray', 'review', 'are', 'reading', 'format', 'then', 'information', 'may', 'not', 'apply.Film', '4/5', 'Picture', 'Quality', '4/5', 'Audio', 'Quality', '5/5', 'Extras', '4/5', 'Overall', '4/5Quality', 'can', 'detect', 'slight', 'amount', 'jagged', 'lines', 'aliasing', 'pixilation', 'banding', 'very', 'slight', 'small', 'almost', 'unnoticeable', 'got', 'face', 'glued', 'screen', 'just', 'slight', 'problem', 'image', 'still', 'insanely', 'sharp', 'clean', 'good-looking', 'colors', 'contrast', 'once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'coloring', 'seem', 'remember', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'VII', 'Advent', 'Children', 'having', 'worse', 'issues', 'Sound', 'quality', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'bunch', 'documentaries', 'games', 'deleted', 'scene', 'plenty', 'other', 'cool', 'stuff', 'copy', 'came', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', 'well.My', 'copy', 'also', 'came', 'slipcover.Film', 'Superheroes', 'typically', 'win', 'fight', 'get', 'girl', 'end', 'what', 'when', 'supervillain', 'see', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'scenario', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'Megamind', 'superpowers', 'heroism', 'mix', 'more', 'effectively', 'lampoon', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'result', 'get', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'gracious', 'amounts', 'action', 'eye-candy', 'quite', 'few', 'amusing', 'laughs', 'comedy', 'nice', 'slappy', 'plenty', 'funny', 'lines', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'style', 'humor', 'works', 'well', 'movie', 'quite', 'fun', 'overall', ""'d"", 'put', 'same', 'level', 'Monsters', 'vs', 'Aliens', 'story', 'pretty', 'unique', 'little', 'other', 'sources', 'once', 'going', 'brilliant', 'tale', 'deception', 'dramatic', 'irony', 'middle', 'movie', 'maybe', 'little', 'film', 'overall', 'little', 'hectic', 'one', 'mad', 'situation', 'then', 'tossing', 'one', 'two', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'out', 'sublimely', 'end', 'also', 'characters', 'receive', 'decent', 'treatment', 'solid', 'emotional', 'depth.The', 'film', 'strong', 'animation', 'quality', 'Movements', 'are', 'smooth', 'textures', 'rendering', 'lighting', 'are', 'great', 'overall', 'designs', 'are', 'stylish', 'similar', 'style', 'quality', 'Monsters', 'vs', 'Aliens', 'Voice-acting', 'good', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'are', 'decent', 'Music', 'lot', 'rock', 'songs', 'seem', 'little', 'arbitrary', 'usually', 'do', 'fit', 'given', 'scenes.4/5', 'entertainment', '4.5/5', 'story', '4/5', 'film', '4/5']",Megamind

For a while, it flirts with being a demented remake of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie -- or maybe just appropriates a few ideas from that film in the way all animated movies now shamelessly pander to the assumed tastes of the parents of the rugrats watching it [1] -- but it always settles back into the groove of Kid-Approved Plot #4: Misunderstood Loner Makes Good.Megamind (voice of Will Ferrell, sounding like he's actually playing a character rather than doing the Will Ferrell thing, and that's good) has the funny version of Superman's origin: rocketed to Earth from a doomed planet, but landed in a prison. His nemesis, Metroman (voice of Brad Pitt, and in the movie much less than you'd expect from the ads), has the good-guy version of that origin, and so they fight, starting when they both go to the same little red schoolhouse as tots. The Lois Lane figure is Roxanne Ritchie (voice of Tina Fey, not really sounding like herself, either), who's feisty enough that you almost don't notice that her entire role in the movie is to be the girl that strong men will fight over.The bulk of the movie, though, takes place after the Megamind-Metroman conflict has been permanently resolved, leaving Megamind at loose ends. And, since this is a movie for kids, his devotion to evil is purely based in liking to wear capes with dark colors and an appreciation for the stoner anthems of my childhood. To be blunt, he's not actually evil in any sense, and his nefarious schemes were all entirely devoted to killing Metroman -- not to stealing anything, or conquering the world, or any more traditionally evil doings.And we all know that the ending has to have Megamind turning into a good guy and saving everyone, right? Even supposedly edgy and goofy animated movies these days have to be massively renormative in the end, and MEGAMIND is no exception; everything turns out as nice as nice can be. It is pretty funny along the way, though -- even Megamind's random mispronunciations, which I was expecting to become horrible very quickly, stay few and funny, and even become an important plot point -- which is about what should be expected from a movie like this.[1] This movie has one particularly egregious example: all of the music in it is at least twenty years old, the songs we parents remember from our own youths.",3,Predictably entertaining,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2444,"['nothing', 'wrong', 'MEGAMIND', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'while', 'being', 'demented', 'remake', 'first', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'movie', 'maybe', 'just', 'few', 'ideas', 'film', 'way', 'animated', 'movies', 'now', 'shamelessly', 'pander', 'assumed', 'tastes', 'parents', 'rugrats', 'watching', '1', ']', 'always', 'back', 'groove', 'Kid-Approved', 'Plot', '4', 'Misunderstood', 'Loner', 'Makes', 'Good.Megamind', 'voice', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'sounding', 'actually', 'playing', 'character', 'rather', 'doing', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'thing', 'good', 'funny', 'version', 'Superman', 'origin', 'rocketed', 'Earth', 'doomed', 'planet', 'landed', 'prison', 'nemesis', 'Metroman', 'voice', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'movie', 'much', 'less', ""'d"", 'expect', 'ads', 'good-guy', 'version', 'origin', 'so', 'fight', 'starting', 'when', 'go', 'same', 'little', 'red', 'schoolhouse', 'tots', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'figure', 'Roxanne', 'Ritchie', 'voice', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'not', 'really', 'sounding', 'either', 'who', 'feisty', 'enough', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'entire', 'role', 'movie', 'be', 'girl', 'strong', 'men', 'will', 'fight', 'over.The', 'bulk', 'movie', 'though', 'place', 'Megamind-Metroman', 'conflict', 'been', 'permanently', 'resolved', 'leaving', 'Megamind', 'loose', 'ends', 'movie', 'kids', 'devotion', 'evil', 'purely', 'based', 'liking', 'wear', 'capes', 'dark', 'colors', 'appreciation', 'stoner', 'anthems', 'childhood', 'be', 'blunt', 'not', 'actually', 'evil', 'sense', 'nefarious', 'schemes', 'were', 'entirely', 'devoted', 'killing', 'Metroman', 'not', 'stealing', 'anything', 'conquering', 'world', 'more', 'traditionally', 'evil', 'doings.And', 'know', 'ending', 'have', 'Megamind', 'turning', 'good', 'guy', 'saving', 'everyone', 'right', 'Even', 'supposedly', 'edgy', 'goofy', 'animated', 'movies', 'days', 'have', 'be', 'massively', 'renormative', 'end', 'MEGAMIND', 'exception', 'everything', 'out', 'as', 'nice', 'nice', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'funny', 'way', 'even', 'Megamind', 'random', 'mispronunciations', 'was', 'expecting', 'become', 'horrible', 'very', 'quickly', 'stay', 'few', 'funny', 'even', 'become', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'movie', '[', '1', ']', 'movie', 'one', 'particularly', 'egregious', 'example', 'music', 'least', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'songs', 'parents', 'remember', 'own', 'youths']",Megamind

Enlisting big names in comedy like Will Ferrell and Tina Fey along with newcomer Jonah Hill (who is easily the funniest character in the film) and superstar Brad Pitt was a smart move, especially since their voices lend themselves well to voice over work (you may think it's easy to `voice a cartoon', but you really have to have the right voice for it).The film tells the story of two young orphans, both aliens who are transported to Earth when their home planets are being destroyed.  Young Megamind and Metro Man have an instant rivalry considering that their fates were so very different.  Pegged as the loser, the outcast, the shamed one since he was ten days old, Megamind began to resent others and soon he embraced the only thing he was good at, being bad.  Metro Man, on the other hand, became swallowed up in his own ego, having others fawn all over his heroic acts and soon he became a hero, a legend in his own time.  The citizens of Metro City watched with baited breath as Metro Man consistently defeated Megamind, until...Metro Man was killed.After finally getting his wish and defeating Metro Man, Megamind realizes that his evil ways are pointless if he doesn't have someone to battle.  It was too easy being bad when there was no good to counteract it, and so he devises a plan to replace Metro Man.It backfires.In the process, Megamind learns a slew of life lessons we could have seen coming a mile away (maybe ten miles at that) and the eventual outcome is rather easy to predict (the bad guy NEVER gets the girl...unless you're watching a kid's movie where the bad guy isn't really that `bad') but there is still a lot of fun to be had here.  The laughs come rather fluidly and the repartee between the characters is fun to watch.  Brad Pitt sounds like a here, Will Ferrell sounds like a dimwitted villain and Jonah Hill is just, well, hilarious.  It looks sharp and it delivers thrills, but never in a way that would startle or scare a kid.  This is a battle between good and evil that you don't need to be scared to show the youngsters.",4,Mega-fun!,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,2301,"['Megamind', ""n't"", 'feel', 'something', 'new', 'fact', 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'already', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'comic', 'nature', 'beast', 'fact', 'heart', 'still', 'pretty', 'memorable', 'film', 'Enlisting', 'big', 'names', 'comedy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'newcomer', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'who', 'easily', 'funniest', 'character', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'especially', 'voices', 'lend', 'well', 'voice', 'work', 'may', 'think', 'easy', 'voice', 'cartoon', 'really', 'have', 'have', 'right', 'voice', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'orphans', 'aliens', 'who', 'are', 'transported', 'Earth', 'when', 'home', 'planets', 'are', 'being', 'destroyed', 'Young', 'Megamind', 'Metro', 'Man', 'have', 'instant', 'rivalry', 'considering', 'fates', 'were', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'Pegged', 'loser', 'outcast', 'shamed', 'one', 'was', 'ten', 'days', 'old', 'Megamind', 'began', 'resent', 'others', 'soon', 'embraced', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'good', 'being', 'bad', 'Metro', 'Man', 'other', 'hand', 'became', 'swallowed', 'up', 'own', 'ego', 'having', 'others', 'fawn', 'heroic', 'acts', 'soon', 'became', 'hero', 'legend', 'own', 'time', 'citizens', 'Metro', 'City', 'watched', 'baited', 'breath', 'Metro', 'Man', 'consistently', 'defeated', 'Megamind', 'Metro', 'Man', 'was', 'killed.After', 'finally', 'getting', 'wish', 'defeating', 'Metro', 'Man', 'Megamind', 'evil', 'ways', 'are', 'pointless', ""n't"", 'have', 'someone', 'battle', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'being', 'bad', 'when', 'was', 'good', 'counteract', 'so', 'plan', 'replace', 'Metro', 'Man.It', 'backfires.In', 'process', 'Megamind', 'slew', 'life', 'lessons', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'maybe', 'ten', 'miles', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'rather', 'easy', 'predict', 'bad', 'guy', 'NEVER', 'girl', ""'re"", 'watching', 'kid', 'movie', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'laughs', 'come', 'rather', 'fluidly', 'repartee', 'characters', 'fun', 'watch', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'here', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'dimwitted', 'villain', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'just', 'well', 'hilarious', 'sharp', 'thrills', 'never', 'way', 'would', 'startle', 'scare', 'kid', 'battle', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'scared', 'show', 'youngsters']",Megamind

But it also had the same events that other animated movies have: the hero (or in this case, the villain) goes wrong, realizes that this isn't what he wants to do (usually because of loneliness or a romantic interest) and changes himself.  I didn't mind this movie, but I don't think it was a must-see.  I recommend it for younger kids who are tired of seeing your everyday animated movie with a regular hero in it.

1364530,A3LPA9D5IOQ1XY,B003UESJF6,Ashley Billings,"[1, 2]","Megamind is an computer-animated comedy produced by Dreamworks and directed by Tom Mcgrath.  It features the voice talents of Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross, Ben Stiller, and Jonah Hill.  The movie takes place in a fictitious city called ""Metro City"" in modern day times.Plot: The story centers around Megamind (Will Ferrell) a blue alien with a problem pronouncing words who is supposedly super intelligent, (though I'm not so sure on that one) who was sent to Earth as a baby, along with his fish, Minion (David Cross).  At the same time, another baby, by the name of Metro Man(Brad Pitt), is also on his way to Earth, and outclasses Megamind in every way.  Once they arrive on earth, Metro man is sent to a mansion with a rich family, where life is handed to him on a silver platter, meanwhile Megamind is sent to the prison to be raised by inmates.  The two end up going to school together and Metro Man is the popular one because of his super powers, while Megamind is the outcast and is the last one picked for everything, such as sports (even picked after a kid with a broken leg during dodge-ball).  Megamind realizes that the only way to get respect, is to be the bad guy, and thus we fast forward to the future.  Megamind is an adult now who has become a super villain with his sidekick Minion. (who has a diving helmet with robot body taken from an old sci fi movie)  Megamind still remains arch enemy of Metro Man, and is always kidnapping his supposed girlfriend, Roxanna Ritchie (Tina Fey).  For his latest scheme he routinely kidnaps Roxanne and waits for Metro Man to come rescue her.  Megamind tricks Metro Man into getting trapped in an old observatory where plans to shoot a death ray directly at him.  While the death ray is taking forever to gather energy, Metro Man tries to escape, but the observatory is lined with copper, which Metro man claims is his weakness, so finally the death ray fires and Metro Man is incinerated, meaing that for the first time in history, bad has triumphed over good.Megamind can't believe his luck and celebrates by taking over the town, but after just a short time he becomes depressed and feels as though he has no purpose, and if not to make matters worse, he is starting to fall for Roxanne and is now dating her, disguised as a museum curator named Bernard (Ben Stiller).  Roxanne, unaware that she is really dating Megamind, gives him an idea to create a new super hero.  Megamind is thrilled with the idea, finally he will have a purpose again. But when he accidentally turns Roxanne's overweight, socially inept cameraman, Hal Stewart(Jonah Hill) into the new superhero, Tighten, Megamind has to train him to be just like Metro Man, a noble superhero that lives to serve the people and be the good guy.  But what if the superhero isn't such a good guy, and what if the supervillain must become the good guy to save himself and the ones he loves?  Two questions never answered until now.My thoughts:  At first I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this movie, the cover just seemed unappealing to me, but never judge a book by its cover, this movie is amazing.  The animation is very well done to the T.  You also will get very invested in the characters, all of them are very well portrayed and Megamind is silly and very likable.  His sidekick Minion is an ugly fish in a giant robot body, but by the end of the movie I thought he was really cute, I don't know why.The music is also a great addition to this movie, instead of kiddie songs, we get Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N Roses, AC/DC, and even Michael Jackson.  I loved this soundtrack, there aren't too many kids movie I would consider buying the soundtrack for lol.So in conclusion, this is an instant hit, a lot of people were drawn away from it like me in the beginning because of the cover, but looks can be deceiving, this movie is great for kids and adults alike, and I recommend it to anyone.",5,Code...Great Movie Sir!,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,3912,"['Megamind', 'computer-animated', 'comedy', 'produced', 'Dreamworks', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Mcgrath', 'voice', 'talents', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'David', 'Cross', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'movie', 'place', 'fictitious', 'city', 'called', 'Metro', 'City', 'modern', 'day', 'times.Plot', 'story', 'centers', 'Megamind', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'blue', 'alien', 'problem', 'pronouncing', 'words', 'who', 'supposedly', 'super', 'intelligent', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'Earth', 'baby', 'fish', 'Minion', 'David', 'Cross', 'same', 'time', 'baby', 'name', 'Metro', 'Man', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'also', 'way', 'Earth', 'Megamind', 'way', 'arrive', 'earth', 'Metro', 'man', 'sent', 'mansion', 'rich', 'family', 'where', 'life', 'handed', 'silver', 'platter', 'meanwhile', 'Megamind', 'sent', 'prison', 'be', 'raised', 'inmates', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'school', 'together', 'Metro', 'Man', 'popular', 'one', 'super', 'powers', 'Megamind', 'outcast', 'last', 'one', 'picked', 'everything', 'such', 'sports', 'even', 'picked', 'kid', 'broken', 'leg', 'dodge-ball', 'Megamind', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'respect', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'thus', 'fast', 'forward', 'future', 'Megamind', 'adult', 'now', 'who', 'become', 'super', 'villain', 'sidekick', 'Minion', 'who', 'diving', 'helmet', 'robot', 'body', 'taken', 'old', 'sci', 'fi', 'movie', 'Megamind', 'still', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Metro', 'Man', 'always', 'kidnapping', 'supposed', 'girlfriend', 'Roxanna', 'Ritchie', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'latest', 'scheme', 'routinely', 'Roxanne', 'waits', 'Metro', 'Man', 'come', 'rescue', 'Megamind', 'Metro', 'Man', 'getting', 'trapped', 'old', 'observatory', 'where', 'plans', 'shoot', 'death', 'ray', 'directly', 'death', 'ray', 'taking', 'forever', 'gather', 'energy', 'Metro', 'Man', 'escape', 'observatory', 'lined', 'copper', 'Metro', 'man', 'claims', 'weakness', 'so', 'finally', 'death', 'ray', 'fires', 'Metro', 'Man', 'incinerated', 'meaing', 'first', 'time', 'history', 'bad', 'triumphed', 'good.Megamind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'luck', 'celebrates', 'taking', 'over', 'town', 'just', 'short', 'time', 'depressed', 'feels', 'purpose', 'not', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'starting', 'fall', 'Roxanne', 'now', 'dating', 'disguised', 'museum', 'curator', 'named', 'Bernard', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Roxanne', 'unaware', 'really', 'dating', 'Megamind', 'idea', 'create', 'new', 'super', 'hero', 'Megamind', 'thrilled', 'idea', 'finally', 'will', 'have', 'purpose', 'again', 'when', 'accidentally', 'Roxanne', 'overweight', 'socially', 'inept', 'cameraman', 'Hal', 'Stewart', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'new', 'superhero', 'Tighten', 'Megamind', 'train', 'be', 'just', 'Metro', 'Man', 'noble', 'superhero', 'serve', 'people', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'what', 'superhero', ""n't"", 'such', 'good', 'guy', 'what', 'supervillain', 'must', 'become', 'good', 'guy', 'save', 'ones', 'Two', 'questions', 'never', 'answered', 'now.My', 'thoughts', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'cover', 'just', 'seemed', 'unappealing', 'never', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'movie', 'amazing', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'T.', 'also', 'will', 'get', 'very', 'invested', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Megamind', 'silly', 'very', 'likable', 'sidekick', 'Minion', 'ugly', 'fish', 'giant', 'robot', 'body', 'end', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'cute', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why.The', 'music', 'also', 'great', 'addition', 'movie', 'instead', 'kiddie', 'songs', 'get', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'Guns', 'N', 'Roses', 'AC/DC', 'even', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'kids', 'movie', 'would', 'consider', 'buying', 'soundtrack', 'lol.So', 'conclusion', 'instant', 'hit', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'drawn', 'away', 'beginning', 'cover', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'movie', 'great', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'recommend', 'anyone']",Megamind

Megamind is a Super villain, who like his adversary came from another world, but there, the similarity ends, While Metro-man was thrust into the lap of luxury and gifted with every advantage growing up, Megamind grew up literally in a prison and was thrust into the shadows, reviled for being bad when he tried to do good, until he finally decided to give up and accept his role as a villain. At the center of this conflict is a newswoman Roxanne Richie who is currently enamored with Metro man, until one day, he loses a fight with Megamind, and all that remains is a cape draped skeleton. At first, Megamind is ecstatic and plans to rule with an iron hand, but soon grows bored as he longs for the battles he fought before. he begins a hidden Romance with Roxie disguised as Bernard the Metro man's museum attendant and he soon creates a serum that will grant a human with Metro Man's powers and by accident, Hal Stewart, Roxie's cameraman is injected, and Titan is created, but Hal is no hero and Megamind soon finds an adversary worse than anything he ever imagined, one that he isn't too sure that he can stop.

But Dreamworks has reached a new level of awesome with Megamind.The movie is not only hilarious and entertaining, but it also has a lot of emotion. There are scenes where you really feel for the main character. You relate to him, everyone can relate to being pushed into becoming something you didn't want to be. All the characters are strong and not annoying at all. The action is superb, and I am so getting this on Blu-Ray because the animation is just great! You can tell Dreamworks has come a long way since Shrek. The relationship between Megamind and Roxanne (the female lead) is funny and sweet at the same time. I love everything about this movie, and I don't think I can find anything wrong with it if I tried. Critics may say it's predicable and cliched, but there are a few twists thrown in that even I didn't expect. This movie, like Megamind, is something special :)The lesson ""Choose your own Destiny"" shines through in this movie, and it's great for both kids and adults. I would definitely by the Blu-Ray dvd (comes with a mini movie and a ton of extras) or at least buy the single disc.

However, in this superhero plot line, the evil villain eventually wins, then suffers through the reality that without the hero to contend against, there's no fun left in his life. Things go wrong when he tries to create a new superhero to fight, and suddenly he experiences a rather strong need for a role reversal.The movie is highly amusing and very touching at times.

1364558,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJF6,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 3]","Part of what makes ""Megamind"" so enjoyable is that it's both an homage to and a parody of ""Superman."" In this version, not one but two doomed planets send a newborn son to Earth. One can fly, has super strength and suave good looks, and, after his pod crash lands on the property of a wealthy couple, is destined to become a superhero. The other has blue skin, a bulbous head, a fish-like minion encased in a glass ball, and, after his pod crash lands within the confines of a prison, is destined to become a villain. We follow this villain, who has called himself Megamind, as he gradually realizes that maybe - just maybe - there's more to him than merely being bad. Perhaps it was merely a phase, an unhealthy outlet for his jealously at being teased and neglected during his formative years.This may not be the most original computer animated film of our time, but it certainly is one of the most compelling. It's also one of the funniest; I think I laughed harder during ""Megamind"" than during any animated film released this year, and this includes highly enjoyable fair such as ""Toy Story 3,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" and ""Despicable Me."" It follows in the footsteps of most new releases, both animated and live action, by being released in 3D. While I still feel that the process is overhyped, overused, and overrated, there are select moments when it proves itself adequate (it so rarely makes a movie great). ""Megamind"" is a perfectly adequate 3D film; I can't say that I felt completely immersed, but I certainly enjoyed gawking at the action, the textures, and the shapes. That being said, all that would have just fine to look at in 2D, so if you have the choice, save yourself the extra cash - and yet another pair of 3D glasses.And now for the plot. Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) has for years been the archenemy of Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt), a goody-two-shoes Superman caricature who defends the citizens of Metro City. Despite being well-crafted, Megamind's evil schemes have all been foiled, and by now, it has gotten to the point that they no longer carry any weight - least of all for Metro City's star news reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voiced by Tina Fey), who has been kidnapped by Megamind more times than she can remember.On the day a museum opens in honor of Metro Man, Megamind appears to achieve the impossible by defeating his rival and taking control of the city. He's happy about this, but only at first; after a while, it seems that, without a hero to battle against, his life has absolutely no meaning. Using technology of his own invention, he creates a new adversary, hoping it will help him relive his glory days as a criminal mastermind. Here enters Roxanne's cameraman, Hal Stewart (voiced by Jonah Hill), who's transformed from a pudgy computer nerd into a muscular superhero named Tighten (apparently a spoof of the word ""titan""). Hal hopes to use his new abilities to woo Roxanne, who he has always had a crush on. Unfortunately, Roxanne is already dating someone else, and of that, I will say no more.In due time, Tighten devolves into Metro City's newest enemy. With Metro Man out of the picture, it seems the only hero the city has left is Megamind. Does he have it in him to be a defender of the people? The answer lies in a strange but appropriate skewing of a line Aaron Eckhart delivered in ""The Dark Knight"": ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""It's practically a guarantee that children will enjoy this movie. It has a lot of action, the sight gags are plentiful, the colors are bright, the 3D is noticeable, and some of the dialogue is just silly enough to hold their attention. But adults will enjoy this movie, too. One of the funniest subplots involves Megamind's ability to disguise himself with a series of holographic projections, controlled by a wristwatch-like mechanism; as he trains Hal into becoming a superhero, he transforms himself in a short, stocky send-up of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, complete with a hilariously pronounced lisp. I also enjoyed the parody of Shepard Fairey's ""Hope"" poster, made famous during Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. Let's just say that the phrase, ""Yes, We Can,"" no longer applies.This is, in short, a highly enjoyable animated comedy that everyone will enjoy. There is, in fact, only one thing about ""Megamind"" I took issue with: A brief but disturbing shot of Metro Man juggling three babies before tossing them back to their star-struck mothers. One of them lands in his mother's arms upside down. Even within the context of a family-friendly cartoon, this pushes the limits of what is and isn't acceptable.

I am not a big Will Ferrell fan and the previews of the film reminded me too much ofMonsters vs. Aliens, a film which I despised greatly. So I wasn't thrilled at the idea of seeing this film. But I did, and I liked it.The story is about a supervillain, Megamind, and his attempts to outwit heroes and take over Metro City. But what happens if he were to actually win?The previews for the film were deceiving in the sense that you thought you knew what the story was going to be about and you thought it was just another predictable superhero film. Not so. The storyline showcased in the previews took place for the first ten minutes of the film and then everything moved on. The rest of the film was full of twists and turns and you won't know what to expect next. The storyline was fun and unique, the characters were engaging, and the development of story and characters was believable.On the other hand, the comic wit of the film was not fully there for me. There were some very funny moments and gags, but also some very lacking comedy as well. But... not enough to take away much from the film.So, overall, a fun movie that had lots of surprises and made for an enjoyable experience.

The intricacy and charm of the story outdid the animation - and even the characters. Charmless though they seemed at first, there is a depth and meaning to them that I found entrancing. Same with the storyline, which is actually unique among all superhero fare.Uber-villain Megamind (Will Ferrell in a just-above-mediocre performance - which they originally wanted to title UBERMIND) is lost after he eliminates Metro Man (Brad Pitt); this is the first part of the story after their introductions that captivated me because Megamind actually loves Metro Man. Now don't get all flighty: there is no homosexual subtext, only a loneliness for a lost friendship.Reporter Roxanne Ritchie (a brilliant Tina Fey) throws into the mix a sense of forlorn romance, yet manages to be a sort of glue between the villain and the hero.The humor, though stalling at times like a familiar old car you just can't junk, is actually just as enjoyable. Megamind's penchant for mispronunciations (""school"" comes out as ""schul"", very funny for Jewish people since schul means ""synagogue"" - and ""Metro City"" as one word rhyming with ""atrocity"") - classic! While the vocal talent appears weak, it is the content and delivery that makes this film. I defy the average viewer to catch the adroitly inserted and hilariously delivered line from Shakespeare.Also do not miss the allusions to ""Cyrano de Bergerac"".Megamind's solid Minion (David Cross) adds the perfect touch as handyman and valet. Minion also recites a classic line practically no one will catch: when Megamind is getting ready to go out, Minion sniffs him like a dog, then says, ""Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's Pour Homme?"" - a surefire hit with a perfume/cologne lover like me, anyway. Trouble is, I can't remember if that really is a genuine Gaultier scent.The rest I will not spoil, but believe me when I say this is one of the best stories I've enjoyed in a long time. It's regretful this wasn't made into a live-action film instead. So loveable, full of homage and complex is MEGAMIND, I've never worked so slavishly over a film review!There is everything here for a bored kid - I think I can identify, but I can't guarantee the kids will stick around for it. It's hard telling what they'll like ... but this is solid family fun.

Willard,"[1, 2]","I have to say, maybe I dropped my review from 4 to 3.5 stars due to watching a funnier, cuter movie right before it but it's still worth your $$ and 3.5 - 4 stars is a very respectable rating.You may wonder what I watched right before it? Despicable Me. Yeah, that was so cute and funny that Megamind kinda seemed to fall short.But, I will still rate it pretty good since it definately does entertain and has extra features that are pretty good as well.Trailers I had seen had shown Megamind (Will Ferrel) as simply an anti-hero and he was fighting Titan (Jonah Hill). This is not the case. If you saw that trailer, do not be fooled.It is a story of - Lets say - Superman didn't fall to a little homestead in Kansas but to a prison instead? What if every time he tried to make friends, it just backfired and he eventually realized that he is good at being bad? But, another alien took your destiny from you and has had the good life (Metro Man - Brad Pitt)? Battles occur between the two that they both follow the rules of, ""thou shalt not kill but only imprison."" until one of Megamind's ultimate weapons ""kills"" Metro Man. Now, he has no enemy, is bored and decides to create a new hero using Metro Man's DNA. This backfires as all his plans do and the hero (Titan) decides to be a villian. Titan does not follow any rules and steals, destroys, even tries to kill Megamind and the reporter Roxi (voiced by Tina Fey).Megamind and his minion (a fish with a mecha-gorilla body voiced by David Cross) must find a way to stop Titan.I like Jonah Hill in most of his work but here in this movie he is a nerd that you don't feel sorry for and he is a loser for more reason than one. If they had given us a better reason to hate him, I'd have liked his villian character more. Simply being imbalanced mentally is not a fun villian.The only reason it's not a 5 star movie is that it is for the best of the best or something that blows you away. This won't do that.

The movie starts out with a very cute blue baby being sent to earth in a rocket by his parents to save the infant from the destruction of the planet. As the little blue child is rocketing toward earth, a another child (who is very handsome) is also heading toward earth in a similar rocket. Both children crash land on earth, but to different fates. The beautiful child crash lands on a big estate where he is adopted by a rich family and given everything. While the little blue child crash lands in a prison and is adopted by the prisoners who teach him the ways of evil. Both children are highly intelligent, but due to their circumstances, one grows up to be a superhero -Metroman (voiced by Brad Pitt) and the other a supervillain - Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell).Metroman and Megamind spend their lives locked in the classic battle of good vs. evil with Megamind always losing and ending up in jail. Until one day, Megamind's evil strategy works and Metroman is destroyed. Megamind takes over Metro City and turns it into a dump yard. But he comes to realize that being evil is boring without someone good to fight against. The rest of the story is Megamind coming to terms with his real destiny and realizing that looks and circumstances don't always have to dictate your success in this life.""Megamind"" is one of those animated movies that has a lot more going on than meets the eye.  The animation is totally brilliant.  The scenes look almost real and seeing the movie in 3D is a must if you want to get the best animated viewing experience.  The ending is exciting with complex animation that is out of this world.The story is one of the most complex that I have seen in a children's film.  There are many twists and turns in the plot and, since I did not see the trailer, I did not see a lot of them coming.  But I find it rare in an animated film (and any movie where Will Ferrell is involved) to have such a rich storyline were good and evil are shown as shades of gray that can be affected by circumstances and our own choices in life.  Just because you are raised in a prison does not mean you have to be villain any more than being raised in a palace means you have to be a prince.The kids in the audience loved the obvious jokes and slapstick comedy, but there were many funny one-liners where only parents were laughing since you had to have seen ""The Godfather"" to understand the comedy references.

1364604,A2WMDDDW6POOR5,B003UESJF6,Gemseeker,"[1, 1]","I've seen this movie four times in two weeks. The last time I loved a movie enough to watch it that many times was in 1987, at the age of 13.  I'm 37 now, and much more critical about quality in movies than I was then, and I tell you now that Megamind is a brilliant film.They Got It Right.  This movie incorporates the best elements that we've all seen before, remarkably few flaws, and turns out a hilarious, intelligent movie with a lot of heart. And kid-safe, too, although adults will get a lot more of the in-jokes.First, the humor.  This movie is just plain fun to watch!  Just the right balance between silly-slapstick and witty irony, lots of hilarious one-liners, references to other sci-fi films and comics, and, rare for an animated film, tiny subtle shifts in body language that betray what a character is thinking without any words necessary.Next, the characters.  All five of the main characters have a surprising amount of depth, making it easy to empathize with them, in part due to the gorgeous animation and incredibly realistic facial expressions.  Megamind in particular has very expressive eyebrows, and you can literally see wrinkles appear in his forehead when he's upset, or smile lines in his cheeks when he gives that irrepressibly gleeful grin of his...you can't help but love him.The Story:  Megamind begins the movie as a mischievous, fun-loving, blue-skinned alien super-genius with a crush on pixie-haired reporter Roxanne Ritchi, (whose cameraman, Hal, also has his sights set on her) and a love of playing ""the game"" with the other (human-looking) resident alien, Metroman.  Metroman is not the typical Superman clone he appears to be at the beginning, either.Having been raised in the city prison, Megamind is inexperienced, almost innocent, about many things in the outside world, which is one more reminder for us of his outsider status despite his being culturally of Earth. His only companion is his best friend Minion, a loyal fish sent with him to Earth who wears a robot gorilla suit.The Twist:  When Megamind unexpectedly wins the ""game"", he is at a loss.  A surprise meeting with Roxanne while in disguise as a handsome museum curator abruptly changes the course of his life (and this movie!) Megamind experiences a phenomenal amount of character growth, a coming-of-age that is rife with hilarious zaniness and agonizing drama with a show-stopper finale ends on an incredibly satisfying note.There are several extras you'll want to check out; all the standard stuff plus a sweet-sad deleted scene, an animated comic book that lets you see some of the past battles between Megamind and Metroman, and a 16-minute short adventure (Button of Doom, either included on the Blu-ray or make sure to get the DVD set that has it!), set after the movie that has Megamind hilariously battling one of his own inventions!Gorgeous animation: The sheer amount of rich detail in this film make it worth watching many times. I highly recommend the Blu-ray, though, I watched a dvd version and you couldn't make out details like young Megamind's sheepish, sad-yet-hopeful smile in the class picture.  And unlike several other reviewers, I didn't notice any aliasing at all, and I looked for it.All the characters have such tender attention to detail, including fingerprints, realistic freckles, and eyes that reflect different colors from the sources of light around them.  I'm not a fan of weapon design, but Megamind's De-gun (a ray gun that has multiple functions, including dehydrating animate objects instantly so they shrink into small cubes) has what looks like decorative bronze insets in graceful curves, truly lovely to behold.  The glass catwalks in the museum are beautiful, too.Who won't care for Megamind?  In middle of the film is light on action and things blowing up, as Megamind learns to care for Roxanne while developing a plan centered around Hal, which could bore some die-hard action fans or young children.I also appreciate the lessons taught: The choices you make control your destiny, not fate.  Intelligence will win out over brawn.  Prejudice is wrong and unfair.  Forgiveness.  Redemption.  When life gives you lemons, make lemonade...or giant robots!",5,"If you liked Darkwing Duck, you'll love Megamind!",1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,4206,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'four', 'times', 'two', 'weeks', 'last', 'time', 'loved', 'movie', 'enough', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'was', '1987', 'age', '13', ""'m"", '37', 'now', 'much', 'more', 'critical', 'quality', 'movies', 'was', 'then', 'tell', 'now', 'Megamind', 'brilliant', 'film.They', 'Got', 'Right', 'movie', 'best', 'elements', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'remarkably', 'few', 'flaws', 'out', 'hilarious', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'kid-safe', 'too', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'in-jokes.First', 'humor', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', 'Just', 'right', 'balance', 'silly-slapstick', 'witty', 'irony', 'lots', 'hilarious', 'one-liners', 'references', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'comics', 'rare', 'animated', 'film', 'tiny', 'subtle', 'shifts', 'body', 'language', 'what', 'character', 'thinking', 'words', 'necessary.Next', 'characters', 'five', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'making', 'easy', 'empathize', 'part', 'due', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Megamind', 'particular', 'very', 'expressive', 'eyebrows', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'wrinkles', 'appear', 'forehead', 'when', 'upset', 'smile', 'lines', 'cheeks', 'when', 'irrepressibly', 'gleeful', 'grin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'him.The', 'Story', 'Megamind', 'movie', 'mischievous', 'fun-loving', 'blue-skinned', 'alien', 'super-genius', 'crush', 'pixie-haired', 'reporter', 'Roxanne', 'Ritchi', 'cameraman', 'Hal', 'also', 'sights', 'set', 'love', 'playing', 'game', 'other', 'human-looking', 'resident', 'alien', 'Metroman', 'Metroman', 'not', 'typical', 'Superman', 'clone', 'be', 'beginning', 'either.Having', 'been', 'raised', 'city', 'prison', 'Megamind', 'inexperienced', 'almost', 'innocent', 'about', 'many', 'things', 'outside', 'world', 'one', 'more', 'reminder', 'outsider', 'status', 'being', 'culturally', 'Earth', 'only', 'companion', 'best', 'friend', 'Minion', 'loyal', 'fish', 'sent', 'Earth', 'who', 'robot', 'gorilla', 'suit.The', 'Twist', 'When', 'Megamind', 'unexpectedly', 'game', 'loss', 'surprise', 'meeting', 'Roxanne', 'disguise', 'handsome', 'museum', 'curator', 'abruptly', 'course', 'life', 'movie', 'Megamind', 'phenomenal', 'amount', 'character', 'growth', 'coming-of-age', 'rife', 'hilarious', 'zaniness', 'agonizing', 'drama', 'show-stopper', 'finale', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'note.There', 'are', 'several', ""'ll"", 'want', 'check', 'out', 'standard', 'stuff', 'sweet-sad', 'deleted', 'scene', 'animated', 'comic', 'book', 'see', 'past', 'battles', 'Megamind', 'Metroman', '16-minute', 'short', 'adventure', 'Button', 'Doom', 'either', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'DVD', 'set', 'set', 'movie', 'Megamind', 'hilariously', 'battling', 'one', 'own', 'inventions', 'Gorgeous', 'animation', 'sheer', 'amount', 'rich', 'detail', 'film', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'times', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Blu-ray', 'watched', 'dvd', 'version', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'details', 'young', 'Megamind', 'sheepish', 'sad-yet-hopeful', 'smile', 'class', 'picture', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'aliasing', 'looked', 'it.All', 'characters', 'have', 'such', 'tender', 'attention', 'detail', 'including', 'fingerprints', 'realistic', 'freckles', 'eyes', 'reflect', 'different', 'colors', 'sources', 'light', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'weapon', 'design', 'Megamind', 'De-gun', 'ray', 'gun', 'multiple', 'functions', 'including', 'dehydrating', 'animate', 'objects', 'instantly', 'shrink', 'small', 'cubes', 'what', 'decorative', 'bronze', 'insets', 'graceful', 'curves', 'truly', 'lovely', 'behold', 'glass', 'catwalks', 'museum', 'are', 'beautiful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'Megamind', 'middle', 'film', 'light', 'action', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'Megamind', 'care', 'Roxanne', 'developing', 'plan', 'centered', 'Hal', 'could', 'bore', 'die-hard', 'action', 'fans', 'young', 'children.I', 'also', 'appreciate', 'lessons', 'taught', 'choices', 'make', 'control', 'destiny', 'not', 'fate', 'Intelligence', 'will', 'win', 'out', 'brawn', 'Prejudice', 'wrong', 'unfair', 'Forgiveness', 'Redemption', 'When', 'life', 'lemons', 'make', 'lemonade', 'giant', 'robots']",Megamind

1364616,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003UESJF6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 6]","And there came a day when Lex Luthor finally slew Superman, when Doctor Doom outwitted Reed Richards, when the World bested Scott Pilgrim, when Elmer Fudd finally bagged Bugs Bunny. It's rare that a super-villain achieves his end goal, and so you can't blame Megamind for being out of sorts when ultimate triumph finally came his way. I thought DESPICABLE ME was really terrific, and then the similarly-themed MEGAMIND came along and I enjoyed it even better than DESPICABLE ME.I've never liked Will Ferrell better. The cast is across-the-board fine, but Ferrell had to carry the load, and he hits all the right notes as Megamind, playing up the megalomaniacal side while retaining enough wounded vulnerability that you can't help but root for the bad guy. The movie sets out to make Megamind sympathetic from jump, opening with a passage which chronicles baby Megamind's rocky rocket ship flight from his doomed native planet to Earth. The little guy is established as a hard luck character, thanks to his early thunder getting stolen by another infant - destined to grow up as the superhero Metro Man - also fleeing a dying world. It's this second, aesthetically more pleasing baby who settles under the Christmas tree in a posh mansion and a silver spoon upbringing. Little Megamind's rocket ship, knocked off course by the other baby's ship, careens straight into a maximum security prison, where the baby grows up mentored by hardened convicts. It's that old Nature versus Nurture conundrum again, only played out in tights. Growing up blue-skinned, bulbous-noggined, friendless except for his fish sidekick, and in school always picked last for everything, an embittered boy determines to be villainous.Which is cool, since the villain of the piece is almost always more interesting. Metro City's champion, Metro Man, is adored by the citizens, glorified even by the local television reporter, Roxanne Ritchi: ""His heart is an ocean inside a bigger ocean,"" she gushes. But dude's a bore. Megamind's greatest asset, we eventually learn, is his tenacity. Year after year his flamboyant criminal acts are confounded by Metro Man. But there's no quit in Megamind. And then, one day, shockingly, Megamind finally comes out on top. Not even he expected that.The film looks fantastic with its bright colors and impeccable animation. It's almost a shame that we've gotten used to animation graphics being this stellar nowadays, because it does take away from this film's visual accomplishments. But, with that being a given, it all comes down to the story content, like it always should. MEGAMIND offers snappy one-liners and many wonderful visual gags, and I grin whenever Megamind mispronounces Metro City (to something that rhymes with ""monstrosity"") and also when Titan spells his name as ""Tighten."" But there's also a core narrative which is textured and laced with a richness and nice bits of character development, with the most thought provoking element centering around a villain's melancholy. Megamind finds that holding dominion over Metro City isn't as gratifying when no hero comes to save the day. Long moments of agonizing produce a solution, and so Megamind quickly puts his plan into motion. He'll invent a superhero to challenge him again, create his very own playmate. Good thing Metro Man has dandruff.It's a neat topsy-turvying of superhero conventions, and I don't think anyone will miss out on all the references, from the awesome nod to Marlon Brando's Jor-El to the sassy news reporter (and token damsel in distress) Roxanne Ritchi, obviously a Lois Lane clone. Tina Fey makes her come alive, and Roxanne actually provides the story's grounding element. Her strange relationship with Megamind figures in many of the film's emotionally satisfying moments. Meanwhile, her creepy cameraman also pines for Roxanne, except that she wants no truck with him. That last sentence, by the way, drips with foreshadowing.MEGAMIND isn't quite as top shelf as THE INCREDIBLES or as evocative as TOY STORY or WALL-E, but it's marvelous enough with its heart and pathos and non-stop laughs. Even more than Gru, I rooted like mad for this underdog to win out, to beat his adversary, to get the girl, to find acceptance. ""I did my best. But he was too fantastic!"" wails Megamind in an early scene. I wasn't looking for that in the climax.This single DVD's bonus material: the filmmakers' audio commentary; ""Meet the Cast of MEGAMIND"" (00:09:22 minutes long); the deleted toothbrush scene (00:01:34 minutes), and the ""World of DreamWorks Animation"" which showcases song excerpts and selected video game and DVD promos for the KUNG FU PANDA, MADAGASCAR, and SHREK franchises, and for HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.",5,"""He would win some...

So here we have a super villain who starts wondering why he's a villain, a villain's henchman wondering why he's content to be a henchman, characters who are supposed to be heroic who decide they just want to slack off for a while or (in a third act tour-de-force) even be villainous.And, oh yes, there's also a cute Lois Lane-type who questions why she always has to be the one being rescued and pined over by the guys in capes.Peppered throughout all this are lots of affectionate pokes at every remaining convention of the superhero genre that the characters I just mentioned weren't already addressing.  Imaginative character designs, good action, and a decent little story round things out.In the end, ""Megamind"" is sort of like Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" (which I also liked a lot), only tighter and funnier.

And I think the only people buying this DVD are folks who already love the film. But if you at least want an opinion, I'll tell you what I thought:I found this movie charming, sweet, funny, and not scary (like some kids' animated films can be) unless someone gets freaked out by the one scene with the skull on the floor.  But even that was silly.Megamind became evil because he was always sort of rejected at school.  And everything he did to try and help or be a good guy always went badly.  He finally decided that the only thing he was good at was being bad.  But, apparently, he was not too great at that either since he always lost in the end.  His... er... unique sidekick, Minion (a fish in a bowl connected to a giant robot gorilla body) is as lovable as poor Megamind.I am writing this review to try and be helpful, but I've found that everyone's taste in movies is like their taste in food: What one person absolutely loves, another may find impossible to swallow.  By no means is Megamind hard to swallow (although I did find myself &#34;choking&#34; on the movie, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs), and I cannot imagine anyone not liking this movie, but you just never know.If anyone remembers the Disney film, The Little Mermaid, you must remember Ursula the Witch. Remember how scary she was? I had brought my 3-year-old to see a happy little movie and was incredibly surprised that they put such a scary image in an otherwise delightful and harmless movie. You won't get surprised like that by this film. However, if your child might be freaked out by little flying robots with steel chompers (Megamind's pets) just be warned. They only appear for a few seconds 2 or 3 times in the movie.",5,Loving a movie is so personal isn't it?,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,1795,"[""'re"", 'I-net', 'can', 'almost', 'find', 'out', 'everything', 'want', 'know', 'movie', 'think', 'only', 'people', 'buying', 'DVD', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'already', 'love', 'film', 'least', 'want', 'opinion', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'thought', 'found', 'movie', 'charming', 'sweet', 'funny', 'not', 'scary', 'kids', 'animated', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'someone', 'freaked', 'out', 'one', 'scene', 'skull', 'floor', 'even', 'was', 'silly.Megamind', 'became', 'evil', 'was', 'always', 'sort', 'rejected', 'school', 'everything', 'did', 'try', 'help', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'always', 'went', 'badly', 'finally', 'decided', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'being', 'bad', 'apparently', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'great', 'always', 'lost', 'end', 'er', 'unique', 'sidekick', 'Minion', 'fish', 'bowl', 'connected', 'giant', 'robot', 'gorilla', 'body', 'as', 'lovable', 'poor', 'Megamind.I', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'try', 'be', 'helpful', ""'ve"", 'found', 'everyone', 'taste', 'movies', 'taste', 'food', 'What', 'one', 'person', 'absolutely', 'may', 'find', 'impossible', 'swallow', 'means', 'Megamind', 'hard', 'swallow', 'did', 'find', '34', 'choking', '34', 'movie', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'liking', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'know.If', 'anyone', 'Disney', 'film', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'must', 'remember', 'Witch', 'Remember', 'how', 'scary', 'was', 'had', 'brought', '3-year-old', 'see', 'happy', 'little', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'surprised', 'put', 'scary', 'image', 'otherwise', 'delightful', 'harmless', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'surprised', 'film', 'However', 'child', 'might', 'be', 'freaked', 'out', 'little', 'flying', 'robots', 'steel', 'chompers', 'Megamind', 'pets', 'just', 'be', 'warned', 'only', 'appear', 'few', 'seconds', '2', '3', 'times', 'movie']",Megamind

1364662,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B003UESJF6,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","As I stated before in my review ofThe Croods, Dreamworks' films have always been rather hit-or-miss for me.  While their animation has gotten considerably better over the years, easily on par with Pixar's output, many of their films lack the heart, soul, and charm of Pixar's classics, instead choosing to rely on celebrity voicework and pop-culture humor.  A few of their films in recent years have managed to break out of this mold and put story and characters above cheap gags (How To Train Your DragonandRise of the Guardiansbeing the best examples), but for every one of these films it seems we have to suffer through another soulless ""Shrek"" or ""Madagascar"" sequel, or some other lackluster film.  At least we didn't get a ""Shark Tale"" sequel, I suppose...""Megamind"" is a different sort of film -- it's still primarily a humorous film, with its share of pop-culture-ish jokes (though mostly drawn from comic books rather than more current media).  But it also has a heart behind its story, and characters that are both well-developed and able to take the classic superhero tropes and stereotypes and turn them on their heads.  And of course, its a LOT of fun.The titular Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell in a surprisingly clean-mouthed role) is an over-the-top supervillain who delights in his wicked ways, waging war on his lifelong rival Metroman (voiced by Brad Pitt) with the help of his trusty companion Minion (voiced by David Cross).  In a shocking twist, one of his villainous schemes actually works and leaves the city without its hero, and for a time he revels in his victory.  But he soon grows bored, wanting the challenge that constantly fighting a hero provided, and so creates a new superhero named Titan (voiced by Jonah Hill) to pick up where Metroman left off.  But when Titan goes out of control and proves to be even more a villain than even Megamind could hope to be, it falls on Megamind and a sassy TV reporter (voiced by Tina Fey) to set things right.  Will a villain turn out to be the hero a beleaguered city needs?As always, the animation in this film is top-notch.  The look of the film is sleek and stylish, with the sort of over-the-top feeling of classic comic books.  The human characters have their own unique style, without looking like living dolls or ultra-realistic.  When a CGI film tries to make its human characters look photo-realistic, they usually fall just a bit short, resulting in the characters looking creepy or zombie-like (I'm looking at you, ""Polar Express""...).  Some of Dreamworks' earlier films fell into this trap, but ""Megamind"" keeps a stylish design that avoids the ""uncanny valley"" effect.The characters are what make this film really shine, though.  Megamind isn't just a one-dimensional ""villain,"" but a socially awkward being who decides that if he can't fit in, then he'll simply stand out in his own way.  His performance is campy and over-the-top, but purposefully so, reveling in spiky leather costumes and elaborate gadgetry and classic-rock anthems at every appearance.  And ironically, he has a stronger sense of good and evil than many other characters in the film, and provides some of the most heartfelt scenes in the film.  Metroman is comparatively bland, but given that he's pretty much Superman in a different costume that's to be expected, and he does show some surprising depth to his role later on in the film.  Roxanne, the reporter, is a spirited character who provides some delightfully snarky humor throughout the film, while Titan starts off dorky but turns out to be surprisingly creepy and effective as time goes on.This film hits a good balance between Dreamworks' usual humor-driven fare and Pixar's heartfelt storytelling, turning classic superhero tropes on their heads and exploring what makes a villain and what makes a hero.  It's fun, pleasant to look at, and has strong voice acting that never jars the viewer out of the story with a ""hey, isn't that so-and-so?"" moment.  And while I still consider ""How To Train Your Dragon"" and ""Rise of the Guardians"" to be Dreamworks' best films, ""Megamind"" is a close third.  Probably best for kids 8 and up due to action violence and some scary scenes.",5,Fun and heartfelt Dreamworks' films that turns the superhero story upside-down,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,4192,"['stated', 'review', 'Croods', 'Dreamworks', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'rather', 'hit-or-miss', 'animation', 'gotten', 'considerably', 'better', 'years', 'easily', 'par', 'Pixar', 'output', 'many', 'films', 'lack', 'heart', 'soul', 'charm', 'Pixar', 'classics', 'instead', 'choosing', 'rely', 'celebrity', 'voicework', 'pop-culture', 'humor', 'few', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'managed', 'break', 'mold', 'put', 'story', 'characters', 'cheap', 'gags', 'How', 'Train', 'DragonandRise', 'Guardiansbeing', 'best', 'examples', 'one', 'films', 'have', 'suffer', 'soulless', 'Shrek', 'Madagascar', 'sequel', 'other', 'lackluster', 'film', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Shark', 'Tale', 'sequel', 'suppose', 'Megamind', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'still', 'primarily', 'humorous', 'film', 'share', 'pop-culture-ish', 'jokes', 'mostly', 'drawn', 'comic', 'books', 'rather', 'more', 'current', 'media', 'also', 'heart', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'able', 'take', 'classic', 'superhero', 'tropes', 'stereotypes', 'turn', 'heads', 'course', 'LOT', 'fun.The', 'titular', 'Megamind', 'voiced', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'surprisingly', 'clean-mouthed', 'role', 'over-the-top', 'supervillain', 'who', 'wicked', 'ways', 'waging', 'war', 'lifelong', 'rival', 'Metroman', 'voiced', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'help', 'trusty', 'companion', 'Minion', 'voiced', 'David', 'Cross', 'shocking', 'twist', 'one', 'villainous', 'schemes', 'actually', 'works', 'city', 'hero', 'time', 'victory', 'soon', 'bored', 'wanting', 'challenge', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'hero', 'provided', 'so', 'new', 'superhero', 'named', 'Titan', 'voiced', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'Metroman', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'Titan', 'control', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'villain', 'even', 'Megamind', 'could', 'hope', 'be', 'Megamind', 'sassy', 'TV', 'reporter', 'voiced', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'Will', 'villain', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'hero', 'beleaguered', 'city', 'needs', 'always', 'animation', 'film', 'top-notch', 'look', 'film', 'sleek', 'stylish', 'sort', 'over-the-top', 'feeling', 'classic', 'comic', 'books', 'human', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'looking', 'living', 'dolls', 'ultra-realistic', 'When', 'CGI', 'film', 'tries', 'make', 'human', 'characters', 'look', 'photo-realistic', 'usually', 'fall', 'just', 'bit', 'short', 'resulting', 'characters', 'looking', 'creepy', 'zombie-like', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Dreamworks', 'earlier', 'films', 'fell', 'trap', 'Megamind', 'stylish', 'design', 'uncanny', 'valley', 'effect.The', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'really', 'shine', 'though', 'Megamind', ""n't"", 'just', 'one-dimensional', 'villain', 'socially', 'awkward', 'being', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', 'then', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'stand', 'out', 'own', 'way', 'performance', 'campy', 'over-the-top', 'purposefully', 'so', 'reveling', 'spiky', 'leather', 'costumes', 'elaborate', 'gadgetry', 'classic-rock', 'anthems', 'appearance', 'ironically', 'stronger', 'sense', 'good', 'evil', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'scenes', 'film', 'Metroman', 'comparatively', 'bland', 'given', 'pretty', 'much', 'Superman', 'different', 'costume', 'be', 'expected', 'show', 'surprising', 'depth', 'role', 'later', 'film', 'Roxanne', 'reporter', 'spirited', 'character', 'who', 'delightfully', 'snarky', 'humor', 'film', 'Titan', 'dorky', 'out', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'creepy', 'effective', 'time', 'on.This', 'film', 'good', 'balance', 'Dreamworks', 'usual', 'humor-driven', 'fare', 'Pixar', 'heartfelt', 'storytelling', 'turning', 'classic', 'superhero', 'tropes', 'heads', 'exploring', 'what', 'villain', 'what', 'hero', 'fun', 'pleasant', 'look', 'strong', 'voice', 'acting', 'never', 'viewer', 'story', 'hey', ""n't"", 'so-and-so', 'moment', 'still', 'consider', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'be', 'Dreamworks', 'best', 'films', 'Megamind', 'close', 'third', 'Probably', 'best', 'kids', '8', 'up', 'due', 'action', 'violence', 'scary', 'scenes']",Megamind

I'm not particularly fond of Will Ferrell, who often seems to be adlibbing to amuse only himself.  I'm over the whole ""superheroes are celebrities"" angle.  And at this point I think we all know most villains are just misunderstood.But Megamind nails it.  Ferrell, as Megamind, is a giant blue-headed geek that's easy to sympathize because he's not a muscle-bound villain.  He's the scheming nerd to rival Metro Man's (Brad Pitt, but it should have been Bruce Campbell) ridiculous physical stature.  Megamind, you see, is a victim of his upbringing, raised in a prison, unlike his rival Metro Man who was raised on a farm.  The two go to school together and Megamind learns quickly that being smart isn't the same as being popular.Tina Fey is pitch-perfect as Roxanne Ritchi, lending a cute lisp to a gal reporter that has played the damsel in distress a dozen times too many. She has the majority of the dialogue and shoulders it well.Rounding out the cast is Minion (David Cross), a fish in a robotic gorilla suit. Cross, like Ferrell, can occasionally overdo it, but here his comedy is perfectly nuanced as a worrywart mother-figure that happens to be a fish in a gorilla suit. He and Ferrell are a great team, like an old married couple that just happens to share a supervillain lair.All these characters' fates collide when Megamind finally succeeds in killing Metro Man.  Momentarily elated, Megamind discovers that life isn't quite the same without his archnemesis. It leaves him feeling hollow, and Megamind soon comes to realize that the issue isn't Metro Man, but himself.  Two competing interests help fill the void in the form of his burgeoning romance with Ritchi (disguised as Bernard) and his mentoring of new superhero Tighten.There are two other characters that actually carry much of the plot: Bernard (Ben Stiller) and Tighten (Jonah Hill).  Bernard is the alter-ego of Megamind, who puts his hologram device to work by disguising himself as a hapless museum curator.  Tighten (originally Titan, but kids these days!)  is the inverse of Megamind - if Megamind is a nerd with outside ambitions, Tighten is a geek with no ambition whatsoever.What Megamind does so well is contrast the supervillain archetype.  Every nerd has faced off against a jock and felt inferior. Every geek secretly harbors a brilliant, raging Megamind-like ego and a needy, insecure Tighten. And for every clean-cut celebrity espousing healthy living and high morals, there's a heavy metal opposite who craves the same spotlight.  Megamind and Metro Man are also Gen X heroes, representing the uncertainty of thirty-somethings trying to figure out what they want to be now that they've grown up.  The contrast is heightened by Tighten, a Gen Y punk who would rather waste his superhero powers playing videogames (kids these days!).In the end, what Megamind does best can be summed up in the one word he uses to distinguish a true supervillain from a jerk: PRESENTATION!",5,One word: PRESENTATION!,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,2989,"['love', 'Megamind.I', 'should', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'often', 'be', 'adlibbing', 'amuse', 'only', ""'m"", 'whole', 'superheroes', 'are', 'celebrities', 'angle', 'point', 'think', 'know', 'most', 'villains', 'are', 'just', 'misunderstood.But', 'Megamind', 'Ferrell', 'Megamind', 'giant', 'blue-headed', 'geek', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'not', 'muscle-bound', 'villain', 'scheming', 'nerd', 'rival', 'Metro', 'Man', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'ridiculous', 'physical', 'stature', 'Megamind', 'see', 'victim', 'upbringing', 'raised', 'prison', 'rival', 'Metro', 'Man', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'farm', 'two', 'go', 'school', 'together', 'Megamind', 'quickly', 'being', 'smart', ""n't"", 'same', 'being', 'popular.Tina', 'Fey', 'pitch-perfect', 'Roxanne', 'Ritchi', 'lending', 'cute', 'lisp', 'gal', 'reporter', 'played', 'damsel', 'distress', 'dozen', 'times', 'too', 'many', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'shoulders', 'well.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Minion', 'David', 'Cross', 'fish', 'robotic', 'gorilla', 'suit', 'Cross', 'Ferrell', 'can', 'occasionally', 'overdo', 'here', 'comedy', 'perfectly', 'nuanced', 'worrywart', 'mother-figure', 'be', 'fish', 'gorilla', 'suit', 'Ferrell', 'are', 'great', 'team', 'old', 'married', 'couple', 'just', 'share', 'supervillain', 'characters', 'fates', 'collide', 'when', 'Megamind', 'finally', 'killing', 'Metro', 'Man', 'Momentarily', 'elated', 'Megamind', 'life', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'archnemesis', 'feeling', 'hollow', 'Megamind', 'soon', 'realize', 'issue', ""n't"", 'Metro', 'Man', 'Two', 'competing', 'interests', 'help', 'fill', 'void', 'form', 'burgeoning', 'romance', 'Ritchi', 'disguised', 'Bernard', 'mentoring', 'new', 'superhero', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'actually', 'carry', 'much', 'plot', 'Bernard', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Tighten', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Bernard', 'alter-ego', 'Megamind', 'who', 'hologram', 'device', 'work', 'disguising', 'hapless', 'museum', 'curator', 'Tighten', 'originally', 'Titan', 'kids', 'days', 'inverse', 'Megamind', 'Megamind', 'nerd', 'outside', 'ambitions', 'Tighten', 'geek', 'ambition', 'whatsoever.What', 'Megamind', 'so', 'well', 'contrast', 'supervillain', 'archetype', 'nerd', 'faced', 'off', 'jock', 'felt', 'inferior', 'geek', 'secretly', 'brilliant', 'raging', 'Megamind-like', 'ego', 'needy', 'insecure', 'Tighten', 'clean-cut', 'celebrity', 'espousing', 'healthy', 'living', 'high', 'morals', 'heavy', 'metal', 'opposite', 'who', 'same', 'spotlight', 'Megamind', 'Metro', 'Man', 'are', 'also', 'Gen', 'X', 'heroes', 'representing', 'uncertainty', 'thirty-somethings', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'now', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'contrast', 'heightened', 'Tighten', 'Gen', 'Y', 'punk', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'waste', 'superhero', 'powers', 'playing', 'videogames', 'kids', 'days', '.In', 'end', 'what', 'Megamind', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'word', 'distinguish', 'true', 'supervillain', 'jerk', 'PRESENTATION']",Megamind

In the past few years we've seen some really good ones like Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon and now we have Megamind. The animation is great but what gets this film 4 stars is the fact that while the animation adds to the movie, it is only one aspect of the film's appeal. The dialogue and characterization are strong too.It is, of course, the thinly disguised story of Superman, but told from his arch enemie's(Lex Luthor) point of view. It's also a look at what happens when society fails a child who just doesn't fit neatly into a pigeon hole. Because Megamind is different than his peers(because of his looks and intelligence) he relates to them a bit awkwardly which in turn makes him feel even more different and alienated. At some point he reasons that if he is treated like a bad kid, that he might as well be a bad kid, and  "" MegaMind, incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy! "" was born.Megamind is also pretty even handed. When characters in this movie are bad,or cowardly, or act in ways that are beneath them, it's for an understandable human reason. I think the movie makes the arguement that if people could reach a more mutual understanding of each other, then we might be able to start to eliminate much(but not all) of the evil and misery in this world. It has real heartThat's just the underlying philosphy though. It's nowhere nearly as preachy as I might be making it sound.  The movie is peppered with cool regferences to various Superman incarnations and plenty of humor.The animation is fantastic, especially Megamind's ""Death Blimp"". I saw it for the first time with a huge audience which connsisted of both older animation fans and young families and everyone had a great time. I looked around occassioanlly and saw people of every description laughing through out the movie. There is something for eveyone to enjoy in Megamind.

Building up sympathy for him right from the start, viewers will find themselves drawn to the spectacular hi-jinks of this eccentric villain who has a flair for dramatic appearances. When Megamind seemingly eliminates his arch-foe, Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt), he finds himself, suddenly, without a cause. After a life spent in conflict with this opponent, what's a villain to do with no hero to tussle with anymore?

Metro Man (voiced by Pitt) has the good fortune to land in a mansion, where he's adopted by a wealthy family. Megamind (voiced by Ferrell) lands in the yard of a prison.As the two grow up, they find themselves at odds. Metro Man is always receiving praise and saving people. Megamind, unfortunately, undertakes several science experiments that go wrong, bringing scolding and punishment from the same teachers that dote on lucky Metro Man. In exasperation, Megamind finally decides being bad is the only thing he's good at, so he chooses a life of crime.For the next decade or so, the two aliens battle it out against the backdrop of Metro City, their epic struggle covered in detail by local news reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Fey). In a fluke plan, Megamind apparently kills poor Metro Man. Suddenly, the outcast has achieved his dream - a city he can rule with impunity. But all the stolen loot and fancy paintings in the world don't satisfy him now that his archenemy is gone.

1364711,AHF97M45JFCB,B003UESJF6,ONENEO,"[4, 4]","I have to admit it; I think I let my expectations for this one get a little out of control.  As out of control as Megamind's ambitions of world domination? Well maybe not quite that bad, but still, despite plans of doing my best to maintain a level head going in, I was pretty swept up in the hype surrounding this big budget computer animated feature.  So did it live up to such stratospheric expectations you ask?  Surprisingly, yes it did and I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that the film does a fantastic job of referencing the little nuances that comic book heroes (or most pertinently, villains) have to endure to keep the hero, well, heroic.Kinda like another tale we're all familiar with, this film opens with a world in eminent danger of being sucked into a black hole and some loving parents placing their infant child into an escape pod.  With his pet/ protector (a fish named Minion), young Megamind (Will Ferrell) finds himself hurdling toward a small blue planet at the edge of the Milky Way only his exodus isn't the only one taking place.Apparently another planet, one with very human-like inhabitants, had very similar ambitions for the survival of their species and sent a pod of their own.In true born loser fashion, this second pod enjoys a smooth trip to Earth and lands on the property of a rich loving couple while Megamind's route traverses endless asteroid belts before finally landing within the gated walls of a prison.  With very different upbringings, a rivalry is born between the two alien refugees only unlike the do-gooding Metro Man (Brad Pitt), Megamind has no real powers save for a massive brain.  Since Metro Man has the ""city's good guy"" role pretty well filled, Megamind has little choice but to take up villainy.Despite a pretty good heart, Megamind finds himself repeating tried and true schemes like kidnapping news reporter, Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) only to end up in a custom-painted cellblock in Metro City's prison.Things take an incredible twist when the villain actually gets the upper hand and the reality of the hero/villain symbiotic relationship is finally made clear to Megamind.There's a few central questions behind Megamind, that actually serve as the catalyst for the entire prose, many of which fans of comic books will really take to heart.  Sure on the surface what we're looking at is essentially a spoof at the Superman/ Lex Luthor relationship (with a little Lois Lane thrown in for good measure) only unlike the famous DC tale, DreamWorks slaps a few welcomed twisted to the equation.  Not the least of these is what if the bad guy didn't want to be evil so much as it was forced upon him from the onset.  Another really explores the idea that the relationship between the hero and the villain is one that demands the presence of the other to work.The latter has been explored in films like 1999's Mystery Men but the point is really driven home here in MegaMind.The comedy feels a little bit strained at times but the cast here just plays so well off one another that laughter's inevitable regardless of the viewer's mood going in.  Will Farrell dazzles with his trademark blend of casual dryness and additional props are due to David Cross as Minion and Jonah Hill as Titan.Pacing is quit spot on, and actually succeeds over Pixar's superhero attempt ""The Incredibles""- which did bog down in spots.  Megamind is consistently lively, enthusiastic and visually rich.Hans Zimmer is responsible for the scoring here and does his usual charming work even if the softer tones are often lost to the wailing guitars of Guns n Roses and AC/DC (even the late Michael Jackson isn't overlooked on this explosively charged soundtrack).About the biggest complaint I've located surrounding this film is that the whole genre has been covered by Pixar's Incredibles and Universal's Despicable Me and this is a valid concern, although a legitimate argument can be made that compared directly against Pixar's 2004 entry, these latter two pieces serve as reminders to the ever-advancing computer generated film industry.  From a visual standpoint, the small details are just outstanding.  Perfection of facial systems, textures and lighting simulations are evident in nearly every frame here.In all I have to confess that DreamWorks' collective grasp on the medium of computer generated feature filmmaking is subtly becoming masterful, if undeniably commercial.  While biggest rival Pixar is often limited by what can be accomplished within the confines of a G rating, DW seems increasingly proficient at packing as much into their PG pictures as possible.  There is no confusing the fact that this is an adult-oriented comedy that children will enjoy too (not the other way around).Considering the past two DreamWorks releases were How to Train Your Dragon and MegaMind, it's clear that Disney/ Pixar has their proverbial hands full.  Megamind may not be quite as butter-smooth, adventurous, or as grand-scoped as How to Train Your Dragon but it does harken back to the type of pacing and comedic brilliance viewers have come to expect from films like Kung-Fu Panda.  Megamind offers a whole lot of fun, some solid visuals, and an interesting spin on the ""Man of Steel"" legacy.",4,A Fun Piece That Will Resonate with Comic Lovers and Non-fans Alike,1299283200,"03 5,

But it made me truly belly laugh.  I'm not sure any other animated movie that isn't a Warner's cartoon has made me laugh so much - and I feel we're living in a new golden age (platinum? diamond?)  of animation.  The laughs alone win me over.  I watched it again just to see if I wasn't in a ""mood"" the first go round and it was even funnier the second time.The animation is top notch.  Megamind's wild gesticulations - even his lips get in on the act - are true physical comedy.  I think about Woody's ""You are a toy!"" speech from TS1, where you could watch the scene in Swahili and it would still be funny.  Even the camera gets in on the act.  If there was an award for best comic performance that included animated characters...Some feel that this is an inferior effort because it supposedly is not heartfelt.  Perhaps I have a weakness for the character, being misunderstood and evil myself.  The heart is there, but the comedy comes first.  Is that so wrong?  It makes this movie the perfect bookend with ""HTTY Dragon"", which never mis-stepped into modern references.And references?  Some reviewers seem to claim the movie is just a mish-mash of pop references that will be outdated by this time next year.  I'm not sure they actually payed attention to the movie.  Sure, it is heavily indebted to the standard superhero genre, but that's about it.  Even the music is 80s rock - hardly a sop thrown to get tweeners into theater seats.  Okay, there is the ""No You Can't"" poster ref, but I want that on a t-shirt.As for those who for some reason can't seem to get over the fact that this movie (not labeled in anyway as 3-D) is not in 3-D (and there do seem to be a solid handful of such folks) - learn to read.  Learn to wait for the product you want.  Figure out that Megamind 3D is a Samsung exclusive and deal with it.  Don't run down a movie that you obviously enjoyed in some weird reverse psychology attempt to get something you want.  The lower the rating, the lower the sales, and the less likely it will get a 3D release.  Your evil has backfired.  Music Man wants to sing for you.So, in conclusion, laughs, comedy, great animation, great voicework.

1364724,AQR22MPF45M3P,B003UESJF6,Rachel Ford,"[1, 2]","Seriously, this film was not bad, but it didn't quite make the ""great"" category, either. It is the story of a supervillain, Megamind, who, finally, defeats his nemesis. This one had a lot of potential, setting up the supervillain-superhero epic conflict well, in a humorous manner (funny, at least, in a culture that has suffered through countless superhero stories, few of which have ever been worthy of a second glance)...and then...well, then what? Outrageous can be good, and worked to carry the beginning of the movie...but there has to be more...outrageous has to morph into genuinely funny, and not just because it plays outlandishly off of something that the audience is already familiar with, at some point. Megamind didn't really do this. Certainly, there were a few funny jokes (feeling mulonKULy, anyone?), but it relied too much on ""see how crazy this is?"" and too little on actual puns. Also, very little time was allotted to showing us how Megamind actually became bored with his victory (one of the pivotal pieces of the story)...one minute, he's victoriously looting the city, destroying fire trucks, and whatnot...and the next he's having a heart-to-heart with a plastic desk toy. Uhhh, did I miss something there?All of that said, there were moments that were better than others...like, the way the new villain figures out that he's battling Megamind during the final fight scene...and, the film is visually appealing, so kids will no doubt find it fascinating. If you're looking for something mildly amusing in the superhero/supervillain genre, this film will not waste your time.

1364729,A39W3263A9HCMN,B003UESJF6,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[6, 38]","I'm looking at some of these reviews right now, and wondering if Dreamworks paid some of these people here to write the reviews, because it seems I am in the minority yet again. :/This film is 1/3 a great movie, 1/3 a decent flick that could make for at least a decent studio filler before Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda 2, and 1/3 a boring snoozefest that was deinitely not worth catching a 9 PM screening of. Maybe Dreamworks is starting to run out of original ideas- it seems to be their best animated stuff is adaptations- Shrek, How To Train Your Dragon, etc. Not to say I didn't like Monsters Vs. Aliens or Kung Fu Panda, but I feel as if when they derive, they are in their own little league.I saw the trailer with Toy Story 3. It looked like a good movie- Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, etc. That, plus its concept of a deconstruction of superhero movie seemed funny, except I already saw that 3 months beforehand when I went and saw Despicable Me 3D. Nonetheless I chose to ignore the warning signs and went in.The movie was working for 20 minutes. Especially in its opening scenes, with how we're introduced to how Megamind is apparently having the worst day of his life, as he is falling to his death. I will admit I laughed at the ""Aw, a baby! How flattering."" line, the childhood was cute, and I was just generally loving it.Then the second act came, where Megamind was bored because he's officially defeated Metro Man and there's nothing to do. That's quite symbolic because not a lot happens (at least that I am able to remember for the life of me) happens in this period of time, except for Megamind posing as a janitor and falling in love with Tina Fey. This is where the film nearly made me fall asleep. At that point, I started worrying and kept thinking ""Who approved of this deft, uneven script?""However, the last 10 minutes is where the film started to feel like it found its niche and at least passed for an entertaining action packed finale. It's like, there's a good 20 minutes of brilliance, an hour of boring filler, then 10 minutes of the brilliance that got the film off to a good start. As satisfied as I was that the film had a good last 10 minutes, 30 minutes out of 90 doesn't a good film make.It just seems like Dreamworks thought that they hit their mark with the stellar How To Train Your Dragon, found Universal was producing Despicable Me while someone had The Incredibles playing in the background and thought ""OMG GUYS. UNIVERSAL HAS A SWEET CONCEPT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO IT AND RISE TO THEIR LEVEL OF BRILLANCE. OH AND LET'S BRING IN SOME STUFF FROM THE INCREDIBLES!!!"" I crap you not. I got reminded several times of Despicable Me and The Incredibles, which is not a good thing. It just shows that they felt like they needed more money, so after doing what was said above, they'd release it as a sort of filler flick for their paychecks before KFP2 came out. Because they've gotta keep bringing in bucks by the buckets somehow. It also doesn't help that the equally mediocre Shrek Forever After had the same feel, despite being better than Shrek 3.To be fair, a lot of the movie has a ""going through the motions"" feel to it. It seems like the writers got really lazy halfway into writing and went, ""Hey, we released a real sleeper hit this year!!! No need to be creative or make sure people find the jokes funny, we can turn our grocery shopping lists into a 3D movie and it'd be a smash!!!"". None of the jokes seem fresh. The plot seems bored and done a million times before. It just feels done, and I could have spent my money elsewhere.In short, Megamind is really just a boring movie, obviously released so Dreamworks can get more money. It just feels flat, tired, bored, done a million times before and even beautiful animation/good 3D cannot save this film from being the boring, convoluted mess it is.

1364731,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B003UESJF6,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","Megamind has been called a cheap imitation due to its similarities to The Incredibles and Despicable Me. I don't think that's fair. First and foremost, it isn't very similar to Despicable Me at all, unless you want to say every single story told from a villain's perspective is also an imitation. If not, then that's where Megamind and Despicable Me's likeness end. Megamind is not a cheap DreamWorks version of The Incredibles either, because while The Incredibles is a serious homage to superheroes, Megamind is a light-hearted, satirical look at the life of a supervillain. Completely oppposite sides of the spectrum. Family-focused drama is at the base of The Incredibles, comedy is at Megamind's. The cast is quite funny, and very entertaining on their own. Just listening to the tones in the characters voices can be a good time. Add in the various facial expressions and bodily mannerisms, and the characters feel very real. Sure Brad Pitt could have had a bigger role, but his absence didn't bother me much, because Will Ferrell more than carried the film on his own.Despite the occasional stupid joke, like the mispronunciation of simple words and such, Megamind has its moments for both adults and children. And along with the humor, there are some soft spots as well. Honestly, they may not phase older audiences much, because the comedic aspect is so overpowering that it can be hard to feel other emotions, but nevertheless, the drama is there. Unfortunately, Megamind never really rises above being just another fun animated movie. It favors younger children more than adults, but it would be stupid to call that a flaw. That's not to say it won't resonate with older audiences though. Granted I'll probably pull The Incredibles off of my shelf if I'm in the mood for an animated superhero/villain flick, but I can still see myslef returning to Megamind in coming years. The script could have been a bit more inspired, but the animation is top notch. Textures were spot on. Leather and fabric, dust and smoke, fire and water, fur and hair, etc. They all looked real and natural. Everything was overly detailed to the point of being a distraction at times (in a god way). With that being sai, it's not another Shrek or How To Train Your Dragon, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to Pixar's work, but it's stil good enough to recommend.7/10",4,Childish Humor Drags Down a Fun Family Film,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2357,"['Megamind', 'been', 'called', 'cheap', 'imitation', 'due', 'similarities', 'Incredibles', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'First', 'foremost', ""n't"", 'very', 'similar', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'want', 'say', 'single', 'story', 'told', 'villain', 'perspective', 'also', 'imitation', 'not', 'then', 'where', 'Megamind', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'likeness', 'end', 'Megamind', 'not', 'cheap', 'DreamWorks', 'version', 'Incredibles', 'Incredibles', 'serious', 'homage', 'superheroes', 'Megamind', 'light-hearted', 'satirical', 'look', 'life', 'supervillain', 'Completely', 'oppposite', 'sides', 'spectrum', 'Family-focused', 'drama', 'base', 'Incredibles', 'comedy', 'Megamind', 'cast', 'quite', 'funny', 'very', 'entertaining', 'own', 'Just', 'listening', 'tones', 'characters', 'voices', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'Add', 'various', 'facial', 'expressions', 'bodily', 'mannerisms', 'characters', 'feel', 'very', 'real', 'Sure', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'bigger', 'role', 'absence', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'more', 'carried', 'film', 'own.Despite', 'occasional', 'stupid', 'joke', 'mispronunciation', 'simple', 'words', 'such', 'Megamind', 'moments', 'adults', 'children', 'humor', 'are', 'soft', 'spots', 'as', 'well', 'Honestly', 'may', 'not', 'phase', 'older', 'audiences', 'much', 'comedic', 'aspect', 'so', 'overpowering', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'feel', 'other', 'emotions', 'nevertheless', 'drama', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'Megamind', 'never', 'really', 'being', 'just', 'fun', 'animated', 'movie', 'younger', 'children', 'more', 'adults', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'call', 'flaw', 'not', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'older', 'audiences', 'Granted', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'pull', 'Incredibles', 'shelf', ""'m"", 'mood', 'animated', 'superhero/villain', 'flick', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'myslef', 'returning', 'Megamind', 'coming', 'years', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'inspired', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'Textures', 'were', 'spot', 'Leather', 'fabric', 'dust', 'smoke', 'fire', 'water', 'fur', 'hair', 'etc', 'looked', 'real', 'natural', 'Everything', 'was', 'overly', 'detailed', 'point', 'being', 'distraction', 'times', 'god', 'way', 'being', 'sai', 'not', 'Shrek', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Pixar', 'work', 'stil', 'good', 'enough', 'recommend.7/10']",Megamind
1364732,AVYHQVH6XYOF2,B003UESJF6,Robin,"[14, 18]","I don't especially care for Will Ferrell's humor. In fact, I go out of my way to tell people that I spell my last name differently than he does (Farrell/Ferrell). I'm not entirely sure why I dislike his acting and comedy so much; I just don't. I was underwhelmed by his performance in Stranger Than Fiction, though I respected the attempt at a more serious role (of course, he hasn't done anything even remotely similar since), but, on the whole, I tend to avoid his comedy/acting...the man entirely.That being said, I honestly never thought that I would see a movie in which I empathize and sincerely care about a character voiced by him.When I first saw the trailer for Megamind, I was immediately interested, before I knew who was providing the voice for the title character. Upon finding out, I was taken aback, since the movie seemed different from his usual faire; not so much his traditional humor, though the repeated lines about ""unbelievably handsome"" seemed a little rich and midly annoying within a 1 minute teaser trailer. Still, I was optimistic about the casting choice (encouraged by Tina Fey's involvement) and looked forward to seeing the movie. The concept was interesting, the characters amusing and fun.Now, though it took me two viewings, I've come to the conclusion that I do, genuinely, like the film, in spite of Ferrell and in spite of the film's many and distinctive flaws.As far as positives go, the film was surprisingly sweet and adorable.  There were several remarkable moments that stood out, pure gems - much like ones in How to Train Your Dragon. They came off the screen and touched you, emotionally...even in plain, ol' 2D. I didn't expect that from a kids' comedy that's supposedly poking fun at superheroes and comic book canon. I wasn't at all prepared for a romantic sub-plot or an underlying theme about the desire for acceptance and companionship, about fitting in and just trying to belong. In one specific scene in the beginning, there's a brief moment where we see a photograph of Megamind's class, where he and his Minion are standing entirely separate from the rest of the group, off to the side. In spite of that isolation, both of them wear smiles. In that one instant, you completely sympathize. It took me right back to my early school days and how very tough a time it could be. And I certainly didn't have a giant blue head, cause accidental disasters, or live in a prison.On a more cheerful note, I enjoyed tremendously the motifs the film played with; not just the superhero-stuff, but the clash of musical styles. I loved that Metro Man is, essentially, Elvis (even down to the joke that he's still alive somewhere), and that Megamind is sort of a personification of classic rock, complete with the black leather and silver spikes. They are both extremely theatrical, but in entirely different ways. But the superher0 references and puns are, without a doubt, a great deal of fun and wholeheartedly amusing.It has to be said, too, that a sure-fire way to impress me is for a film that's released in 3-D to be completely enjoyable in 2-D. Megamind did. There are some scenes here and there where it's clear the filmmakers played around with the device, sure, but it managed to still be subtle about it.  A million brownie points earned. That's two films in a row - keep it up, Dreamworks.On the other hand, the film is NOT without it's problems. While the heart of the movie lies in the characters, specifically Megamind's inner yearning to belong and be normal, the film more bluntly pushes the idea of ""destiny"" and ""what makes you who you are."" It comes across as conflicting, almost confusing, as though you have to switch back and forth between two themes. The ideal situation would be that they compliment each other and that one, ultimately, stands over the other, but they honestly seem to be side-by-side and it's frustrating; it made the film seem disjointed in places, rather than cohesive. I think a bit more time in story development would have done the film a lot of good. Not to mention some re-writes on the often clich&eacute; dialogue.It comes back to a fundamental difference between Dreamworks and Pixar.  People often tell me that they can't keep the two studios' work straight, as far as which released which films. To me, it's ridiculously blatant. While both studios are brilliant when it comes to the quality of the animation itself, Dreamworks tends to rely more on humor, gags and antics, whereas Pixar's films dig deeper and really flesh out their themes, characters and emotional core. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" was the first time I saw Dreamworks really compare to the likes of ""Toy Story,"""" ""Monsters' Inc.,"" or ""Up."" I'm not sure that ""Megamind"" did. It had all the potential in the world - it had all the right pieces, but they didn't fit together properly - not the way they could have, anyway - and it shows. It's like... ""the little movie that could've.""In the end, though, apart from a slightly weak ending, the film was fun, enjoyable and surprisingly sweet and endearing. Will Ferrell somehow managed to not be obnoxious to those of us who usually can't stand him, and I'm sure his fans will be quite pleased with his performance. As I said after I saw him in ""Stranger Than Fiction"" I respected the gamble and had hoped to see him take on similar roles in the future (though steer clear of things like my beloved ""Bewitched""). It would seem that this go-round was much better than anything thus far, at least in my humble opinion. Here's hoping he continues in this direction.I recommend this movie, but as long as you go in with an open mind.Get it?",3,Aren't We Just Full of Surprises?,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,5646,"['do',

Zwick,"[0, 0]","***1/2The blue-skinned, bulbous-headed, shape-shifting, malapropism-spouting space-creature known as Megamind (Will Ferrell) prides himself on being the baddest bad guy around.  His arch nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt), also a creature from beyond this world, is a squeaky-clean, universally beloved superhero who literally walks on water and keeps thwarting the plans Megamind has for ruling Metro City (which he mistakenly pronounces ""metrocity"").  When Megamind, much to his own surprise actually, manages to do away with Metro Man in a contentious battle-to-the-death, he begins to realize that being a villain isn't all it's cracked up to be without a worthy hero to call an opponent.  Thus, Megamind hatches a plot to clone another Metro Man figure out of some remnants of the dead hero's DNA.  But Megamind gets more than he bargained for when his creation comes to life.Though ""Megamind, "" directed by Todd McGrath, has the distinction of being one of the only family-oriented animated films ever to feature a bad guy as its main character, the movie may be too cerebral and esoteric to completely enthrall children and too undisciplined and gimmicky to appeal all that much to adults.  Still, the movie has a clean, sparkling look, filled with a whole host of futuristic devices in the foreground and stunning cityscapes in the background, and it moves fast enough to keep its audience focused on the screen for the duration.  It also features the voice of Tina Fey as the Sweet Polly Purebred-type TV news reporter who is a constant bone of contention between Metro Man and Megamind - and Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller add their own vocal support in minor but key roles.

I enjoyed the switch in the familiar pattern of hero vs. villain.  For once, the bad guy won, and when he did, it wasn't anything like he hoped.  Deep down, Megamind was never a bad guy, which is why the beginning is so important to the movie.  It was fun to watch him morph from a bad guy into a good one.I especially liked how instead of the hero disguising himself as a normal person, it was the villain who did it.  Then he made a hero who turned out to be a truly evil villain.  At that point, he had to decide which he was going to be: the good guy or the bad guy.I loved the movie for several reasons.  One, the usual hero/villain movie took on an unexpected twist.  Two, the humor was great.  I know some people didn't think so, but I was laughing through most of it. An example is ""You were right.  I was less right"" as an apology. Even the subtle things in how Megamind eyed Metro Man's cape was funny.  Three, it's a clean movie.  There are no subtle sexual jokes.  This is a movie I was comfortable showing to my four sons who are ages 5-8.  Four, I loved the moral of the story.  Fate isn't something that is decided for us; it's what we choose for ourselves. I'm a firm believer that we have a hand in how our lives turn out by what we do.So this movie has a lot going for it, and though I've watched it enough to quote most of it, I'll be watching it again.",5,One of the Best!,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,1477,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'kids', 'are', 'sick', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'switch', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'hero', 'vs.', 'villain', 'once', 'bad', 'guy', 'won', 'when', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'hoped', 'Deep', 'down', 'Megamind', 'was', 'never', 'bad', 'guy', 'why', 'beginning', 'so', 'important', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'morph', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'one.I', 'especially', 'liked', 'how', 'instead', 'hero', 'disguising', 'normal', 'person', 'was', 'villain', 'who', 'did', 'Then', 'made', 'hero', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'truly', 'evil', 'villain', 'point', 'had', 'decide', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'several', 'reasons', 'One', 'usual', 'hero/villain', 'movie', 'took', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'Two', 'humor', 'was', 'great', 'know', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'was', 'laughing', 'most', 'example', 'were', 'right', 'was', 'less', 'right', 'apology', 'Even', 'subtle', 'things', 'how', 'Megamind', 'eyed', 'Metro', 'Man', 'cape', 'was', 'funny', 'Three', 'clean', 'movie', 'are', 'subtle', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'movie', 'was', 'comfortable', 'showing', 'four', 'sons', 'who', 'are', '5-8', 'Four', 'loved', 'moral', 'story', 'Fate', ""n't"", 'something', 'decided', 'what', 'choose', ""'m"", 'firm', 'believer', 'have', 'hand', 'how', 'lives', 'turn', 'out', 'what', 'do.So', 'movie', 'lot', 'going', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'enough', 'quote', 'most', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'again']",Megamind

Big hit back in 2010, director Tom McGrath (Madagascar) comes out with another hit for Dreamworks.I really liked the animation, quite realistic.  The story starts with Megamind and Metroman, battling it out.  The thing is they've been doing this for so many years and having the same outcomes, that both are getting quite bored with the whole thing.When Metroman disappears, apparently destroyed by Megamind, the big blue head has trouble adjusting.  When he starts falling for the girl, things really get interesting.  The puns and parodies, like Megamind's constantly mispronouncing words, always getting it wrong, was fun but a bit overdone.Megamind also wants to make a hero so he can battle him and get back some of the good old days.  Unfortunately this backfires, with the former nerdy cameraman becoming Titan (or as he spells it, ""Tighten"") the new super villain.How will Megamind adjust to being a super hero?  He's not supposed to win or get the girl.  What is up with that?  And having a Marlon Brando knock-off was frankly hilarious.Themes:I really liked the theme of becoming more than you really are and being willing to make big changes in your life.  Megamind had a lot of hard choices to make.  And Roxie, the girl from Channel 8 (a clear homage to Lois Lane from the Superman comics) realizes she's been judging a book by its cover rather than seeing what lies behind it.DVD:I really liked the ""making of"" segment with Wil Ferrell, Tina Fey and others talking about the film and how much fun they had making it.  There are also the usual previews and advertisements on the DVD as well.  Listen to another rendition of ""Move It"" from Madagascar!Bottom Line:  Quite enjoyable homage, almost a parody in some scenes, and I think will be enjoyable, especially to comic book fans or those familiar with Superman's origins.  The movie does run out of gas in the second third of the film.  I felt the producers spent too much time on Megamind's depression rather than having some more action.Overall, recommended!",4,Mega-Fun!,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,2060,"['Wow', 'finally', 'got', 'watch', 'Big', 'hit', 'back', '2010', 'director', 'Tom', 'McGrath', 'Madagascar', 'out', 'hit', 'Dreamworks.I', 'really', 'liked', 'animation', 'quite', 'realistic', 'story', 'Megamind', 'Metroman', 'battling', 'out', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'having', 'same', 'outcomes', 'are', 'getting', 'quite', 'bored', 'whole', 'thing.When', 'Metroman', 'apparently', 'destroyed', 'Megamind', 'big', 'blue', 'head', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'When', 'falling', 'girl', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'interesting', 'puns', 'parodies', 'Megamind', 'constantly', 'mispronouncing', 'words', 'always', 'getting', 'wrong', 'was', 'fun', 'bit', 'also', 'make', 'hero', 'can', 'battle', 'get', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Unfortunately', 'backfires', 'former', 'nerdy', 'cameraman', 'becoming', 'Titan', 'Tighten', 'new', 'super', 'villain.How', 'will', 'Megamind', 'adjust', 'being', 'super', 'hero', 'not', 'supposed', 'win', 'get', 'girl', 'What', 'up', 'having', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'knock-off', 'was', 'frankly', 'hilarious.Themes', 'really', 'liked', 'theme', 'becoming', 'more', 'really', 'are', 'being', 'willing', 'make', 'big', 'changes', 'life', 'Megamind', 'had', 'lot', 'hard', 'choices', 'make', 'Roxie', 'girl', 'Channel', '8', 'clear', 'homage', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Superman', 'comics', 'been', 'judging', 'book', 'cover', 'rather', 'seeing', 'what', 'it.DVD', 'really', 'liked', 'making', 'segment', 'Wil', 'Ferrell', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'others', 'talking', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'making', 'are', 'also', 'usual', 'previews', 'advertisements', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'Listen', 'rendition', 'Move', 'Madagascar', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Quite', 'enjoyable', 'homage', 'almost', 'parody', 'scenes', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'familiar', 'Superman', 'origins', 'movie', 'run', 'gas', 'second', 'third', 'film', 'felt', 'producers', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Megamind', 'depression', 'rather', 'having', 'more', 'action.Overall', 'recommended']",Megamind

Brad Pitt plays his equally gifted rival Metro Man. Tina Fey plays a very energetic, vivacious, and upbeat woman named Roxanne that is very important to the character development of Megamind. The beautiful and uplifting message of the movie is that everyone has good in them. I also enjoy the message that seems to be tailored to both kids and adults that persistence can pay off even after multiple setbacks. There are plenty of scenes to make a person laugh. In addition, I like how the movie portrayed how a person that may seem like a villian on the outside is not always what they initially appear to be at the surface. In addition, the movie also sends a message that those that create mischief can many times be the ones that are yearning to be accepted and loved the most. All of the actors and actresses voiced their parts in a superb fashion. However, Will's Megamind character really helped to increase the humour and life into this great animated movie.

Viewers, especially in North America, enjoy recapturing childhood memories and seeing their heroes on the big screen. Most of the plots are predictable, but that doesn't detract from the fun.Megamind deviates from the traditional plot in the same way that Despicable Me did. We are asked to sympathize with the villain.The movie begins with Megamind (Ferrell) leaving his parents in a ship when his planet is on the verge of destruction. Does that sound familiar? References are made to Superman throughout the film. While this is happening, a child is sent to safety from another world close to destruction. The two children fall to Earth and experience very different childhoods. Megamind lands in a prison yard, while the other child falls to wealthy parents and grows up to be Metro Man (Pitt).Metro Man is squeaky clean and spends his time doing good deeds. He can fly and he's invulnerable. The city worships him. Megamind leaves jail and decides that he can't compete on those terms, so he decides to be bad. Metro Man is loved by the media and Roxanne Ritchi (Fey) is the reporter who plays the equivalent of Lois Lane in the story. Megamind decides to capture her to lure Metro Man into a trap. It works and Megamind discovers an apparent vulnerability in his rival, resulting in Metro man's death just 20 minutes into the movie.The city mourns the loss of its hero and Megamind begins his reign as an evil overlord with the help of his sidekick, Minion. It's hard to hear the name Minion without thinking of Despicable Me. This Minion looks like a happy piranha balanced on the body of a robot. Some of the humor is left to our imagination. For instance, what kind of reaction would Minion get when he buys coffee and donuts to take home to Megamind?Both movies ask us to focus on the villain and see that they are not all bad. Megamind regrets the death of Metro Man and finds that he can't adjust to life without him. He functioned better when he had a natural enemy. To remedy the situation, he develops a gun designed to infuse its victim with special powers. He inadvertently shoots Roxanne's cameraman, Hal (Hill), and decides to groom him to replace Metro Man.Megamind has the ability to change shape for limited periods of time and that's the source of much of the humor. Hal is renamed Titan. Megamind gives him a costume and begins to school him while appearing as Jor-El and sounding like Marlon Brando. Titan isn't cut out to be a hero and struggles to learn. He eventually finds that he prefers using his powers for criminal purposes rather than for good. Megamind has created a monster.This is where the movie deviates from the expected path somewhat. Megamind is the only one who can stand up to Titan and so he starts to become the good guy. We root for him when he's battling Titan in scenes similar to those in The Incredible Hulk when Bruce Banner fights Emil Blonsky.There are a few more plot twists and I won't reveal them here, but the movie works. It's funny, fast-paced, and the action scenes are frequent. Megamind is a character with many frailties and we're allowed to see them. That's why we are drawn in and made to care about the outcome. Ferrell is particularly good as the voice of Megamind, but none of the actors disappoint.Video Quality 4/5Modern animation is well-suited to Blu-ray and usually results in flawless transfers, but Megamind falls short of a perfect rating. It looks good for the most part; colors are bright and detail is strong. However, on closer inspection, you'll find frequent aliasing. Whether it's in hair, buildings, escalators or fire escapes, you'll see it often. This causes a slight flickering which can be distracting at times. The other problem is not a fault of the transfer, but the source material. Compare Megamind to a Pixar title and you'll see what I mean. The image, particularly in the background, appears flatter and lacking in detail. It looks less realistic than something like Up. These quibbles aside, it's still a good-looking title.Audio Quality 5/5The English: Dolby TrueHD 7.1 track does not disappoint. This is one of the better titles for showing off your sound system. There's a lot going on at all times and you'll find yourself completely immersed in the action. Ambient sounds are strong and well separated throughout. The soundtrack includes a number of driving rock songs and they sound great on this track.Special Features 4/5Audio Commentary with the director, producers and writersThe Animator's Corner with a PiP trackComic CreatorBehind the MindDeleted Scene (1 minute)Meet the Cast of Megamind (9 minutes)Inside Megamind's Lair (7 minutes)AnimatorMan (2 minutes)You Can Draw Megamind (13 minutes)Mega Rap (1 minute)The Reign of Megamind: Video Comic BookSpot the Difference gameMegamind: The Button of Doom - animated short (15 minutes)World of Dreamworks AnimationTrivia TrackPreviewsMegamind is an enjoyable romp with plenty of laughs.

1364768,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003UESJF6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 20]","***What is it about Dreamworks' animated films? They just don't measure up. Which is a shame. They employ inventive stories, top-notch animation, yet they always seem to fall short.  When compared to Pixar and Disney offerings. Maybe they need to develop a reputation, a following for a particular kind of animation, much like Warner Bros. was known for creating some truly ""Looney Tunes"". Get it?.I love animated films and see many every year. The best are always from Pixar; they always set and consistently raise the bar for all others combining brilliant animation, funny characters and superb storytelling. How often are you so moved by a sequence in an animated film that it brings you to tears? I can name a few from Pixar films. Disney is a fairly close second. The animation is beautiful (they created the feature length animated film and have a rich and bountiful history to draw from), the films are usually funny and the storytelling is good. Disney is best at adapting fairy tales, giving them a little spin, so they start off with some pretty good source material. Dreamworks is a distant third. The animation is always beautiful and rich, but they just aren't very funny. This is strange, surprising, and even maddening given the huge amount of comedic talent employed in their films. Also, they seem unable to capture the same depth of detail Pixar brings to their films. Perhaps this is why Dreamworks seems all over the map; they change animation and narrative styles with each new film, something Pixar also does. But Pixar has mastered this. Dreamworks hasn't.""Shrek"" really established Dreamworks as a possible contender to the animation throne. Based on a children's book, the character and subject matter allow the filmnmakers to take pot shots at everything that makes Disney Disney. Add incredible voice talent from Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas and John Lithgow and you have the makings of a huge hit. Because of the success of this film, Dreamworks has since made three sequels, continuing the story of the popular ogre and delivering films with wildly differing results. What ""Shrek"" also did was establish the prescedent o using established film actors as voice talent in animated films. This was something Robin Williams proved could work, but the studios were reluctant to part with so much money sticking primarily with television, Broadway and undiscovered talent. But ""Shrek"" made it a reality. Now, every Dreamworks film boasts big name talent with mixed results. Will Smith, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Reese Witherspoon, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Anjelina Jolie continue to lend their talents to various projects.The reason I continue to go to these films? The animation is usually pretty beautiful. ""King Fu Panda"" was one of the most beautlfully animated films I have ever seen. But it isn't very funny.Now, we have ""Megamind"" starring Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey and Jonah Hill. Again, great to look at and fun to watch in 3-D, but surprisingly few laughs. Also it seems a little too close to the superb ""The Incredibles"", knocking it down a few points for originality.Megamind (Ferrell) and Metro Man (Pitt) have been rivals since they first arrived on this planet as babies. Megamind spends his every waking moment trying to figure out how to escape prison and finally out do his nemesis, Metro Man. His plans usually involve some sort of elaborate contraption in his lair, with many of the details set forth by his minion (David Cross). But Metro City (pronounced very differently with great comedic effect by the villain) loves Metro Man and his seems to thrive on the adulation. Roxanne Richie (Fey), a local news reporter, always seems to get caught in the middle of the tug of war, spending time as the bait in Megamind's plan. One day, Megamind surprises everyone and beats his rival. But he becomes bored and decides to create a new hero, Tighten, fashioning his new nemesis from Hal (Hill), Richie's cameramen. But Hal likes his new powers too much and becomes bored being a hero, so he starts to wreak havoc on Metro City. Who will save the day? Megamind soon realizes he has to step in and set things right.Directed by Tom McGrath (""Madagascar"" and its sequel), ""Megamind"" is fun to watch, especially in 3-D, but it isn't very memorable.Ferrell does an interesting job of bringing the alien orphan to life, narrating the life story of both he and Metro Man and bringing us up to speed. His character is more amusing than funny. He frequently mispronounces words and his ""diabolical"" plans are engaging and fun to watch. Pitt is also good as Metro Man, the super hero who does good things, but his ego is also clearly something that needs to be fed. Luckily, the people of Metro City are only too glad to feed it, heaping adulation on him. Tina Fey is fun as the street wise reporter who isn't really afraid of Megamind, she has been his captive too often and Metro Man always saves her.But when Megamind begins to groom Hal to become the new superhero, Tighten becomes a little too similar to Syndrome, the character played by Jason Lee in ""The Incredibles"". Once this happens, you start to see other similarities and the new Dreamworks production feels a bit like a retread.All animated features are now being produced and released in 3-D. The extra money is too lucrative to the theaters and the studios, and these extra few dollars per ticket helped make ""Toy Story 3"" the #1 animated film of all time. And I like watching these films in 3-D, even when it doesn't really seem necessary. The 3-D adds a layer of texture to the universe created by the filmmakers. Thankfully, in a Pixar film, you embrace this extra level of detail because the tapestry is so beautiful to begin with. It isn't necessary to have things flying at your face to take advantage of the 3-D process. In ""Megamind"", they go the same route. It seems to add another texture to the story and little else. It doesn't even really seem to enhance all of the flying sequences.The story also seems to meander a bit. When Megamind becomes bored, he takes on another persona and... Well, I'll stop before I reveal too much but this part seems a bit slow.""Megamind"" is a wash. Not memorable or funny enough to make it a family classic which is a shame because the animation is good.I think Dreamworks needs to rethink their strategy. Come up with a consistent type of story and animation. One moment, we have the stylized retro characterizations of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", the next, we have the almost painterly backdrops of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and gorgeous animation that almost looks hand drawn. First ""Shrek"", featuring computer generated characters taking aim at the fairy tales of the most famous Disney features, then we have ""Over the Hedge"", a cutesy animated film based on a popular newspaper comic strip. If they were to develop a particular style, it might help them strive to make it the best and to make the best films. As it stands, they seem like they are all over the place.And ""Megamind"" rests firmly in the middle.",3,Dreamworks is no Pixar,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,7059,"['Dreamworks', 'animated', 'films',

It has the perfect combination of drama and comedy that easily keeps an audience surprised and riveted.  The actors portray the characters perfectly, I do not believe they could have done a better job with casting.  There is a lot of emotion in the movie and it causes the simple plot to be more complex.When a young alien is shipped to earth by his parents, he has only the people around him to learn from.  While being raised in a prison, this isn't ideal.  While on the other hand, Metro Man lives a life of perfection; He has parents that love him, friends that adore him and adults who dote on him.  Megamind, knowing only bad and rejection, decides as a child he will be an evil villain.  When grown, Megamind has an evil plan to rid the world of Metro man.  By kidnapping Roxanne Richins, the supposed girlfriend of Metro man, his plan seems to be going well.  Metro man, attempting to save Roxanne Richins, fails miserably resulting in his death.With the world at his fingertips and all of Metrocity under his control, Megamind thinks he has it all.  Until, he realizes he has no purpose without a hero.  What will he do?  So in true villain spirit, Megamind decides to create a new superhero.  While working hard on this project, Megamind has time on the side to woo Roxanne Richins in disguise.When everything is said and done, what will Megamind choose?

1364773,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003UESJF6,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Despite its rather conventional ending, 'Megamind' proves to be a highly entertaining twist on the superhero genre. Satirizing the origin of the Superman comics stories, we're introduced to two different superheros, Megamind and Metroman, as they arrive on earth from separate dying planets, in space capsules at the same time. Metroman's  is smooth but Megamind's is anything but--crashing into various meteors and debris like an out of control bumper car. A flashback chronicles how Metroman ends up with an all-American family but Megamind plops down in middle of the Metro City prison where he's raised by inmates to be a 'villain'. But Megamind is actually more like The Wizard of Oz than a hardened criminal--his dark side can best be described as a mischievous youthful offender, capable of rehabilitation.If Megamind's delinquent mindset is his Achilles heel, Metroman is also trapped by his celebrity status. An Adonis with a chiseled jaw, Metroman flings babies in the air with aplomb as police officer shoot their guns as part of a blind celebratory approbation. Megamind and Metroman periodically battle one another for the affection of love object Roxanne (Roxie) Ritchie, a perky TV newscaster voiced by the talented Tina Fey. Roxie isn't impressed by their clumsy attempts to win her affections. She's bored after being kidnapped by Megamind and after being brought to his lair bluntly tells Megamind that your ""plan never works"". When Metroman arrives and engages Megamind in yet another physical confrontation that always ends in a stalemate, Roxie wittily queries: ""Girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?""'Megamind' breaks into its second act when Metroman fakes his own death and the blue-skinned Conehead finds himself experiencing an 'existential crisis'. Without Metroman, Megamind laments, ""it's just too easy now"". In his 'despair', Megamind's delinquency in Metro City (or 'Metrocity' as he puts it) multiplies exponentially. Megamind steals all the artwork in the city's museums and places them inside his own office inside City Hall. He throws currency all over the streets as if it's confetti, but none of the mischief makes him happy. Finally, using an idea he appropriates from Roxie, he decides to create his own superhero so he can once again find some meaning in his existence. NY Times critic Stephen Holden puts it most succinctly: ""The movie's central joke -- that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition -- is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie.""Megamind's new opponent turns out to be Roxie's cameraman, Hal, a geek who expects women to flock to him without mustering any effort to charm them. Before being injected with Megamind's new preparation that alters his DNA, Hal is a harmless nerd who reminds me of a caricature of Bill Murray's cameraman in the classic comedy, 'Groundhog Day'.There are tons of funny moments in 'Megamind'. Here a few that come to mind: when Megamind tells Roxie they're making renovations at the Metroman Museum (""we're having the walls and ceilings removed""); when Megamind throws the dynamite at his mini-bots and apologizes (""Daddy's sorry""); Minion's expression when he leaves Megamind (stifling his tears and then displaying a stiff upper lip); Titan's lame comment after Roxie rejects him (""Wow, our first fight""); the reaction of the man with the baby in the restaurant when Bernard is transformed back to Megamind (his eyes are wide open in disbelief!).Despite all the good stuff, 'Megamind' loses its way when introducing 'Titan', a character that diminishes the comic tone of the film's second half. Although Megamind was always up to mischief , he never had murderous intentions (remember how surprised he was, when he thought he had killed Metroman). Before Megamind's misguided intervention, Hal was like many other geeky guys who simply hadn't discovered the right way to charm women. Remember it was Roxanne herself who confronted Titan and reminded him that he was not such a bad guy after all, BEFORE he was transformed. This is what Roxanne says to Titan right before he ties her up on the tower: ""I want to talk to the real Hal...I want to talk to the guy who liked being a cameraman, and eating dip and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal."" In Roxanne's view, before the injection, Hal may have been ""self-absorbed"" and perhaps a little ""selfish"", but certainly not in her eyes, a creepy stalker. He had his ""issues"" just like Megamind and Metroman, but they were all multi-dimensional characters.Only Titan is a one-note character. He has no charm and doesn't really fit in the Megamind universe due to his unpleasant attitude and non-stop nastiness. When he actually tries to kill Roxanne by lobbing the bus at her, the movie suddenly turns in a rather sour, unfunny direction. I realize that once he was injected, all of Hal's bad points were magnified to the point where he became a psychopath. But why was that? Why couldn't Hal remain the goofy nerd, even after Megamind injected him? Everything else in the movie was FUN, but once Titan turned into who he was, things weren't much fun anymore.In essence, there needed to be some kind of explanation in the script as to WHY Titan became a psychopath. Perhaps he encountered some Kryptonite type substance that made him act that way or perhaps Minion used the wrong DNA when the formula was being prepared. Some may believe on the other hand that Hal was innately bad and Titan merely represented a magnification of his evil nature. Whatever the case, the Titan character was so unlikeable that the film's denouement turned into the standard comic book 'good triumphs over evil' narrative.Why belabor Megamind's obvious shortcomings? There's enough excellent, clever stuff here to keep the critical film goer eminently satisfied. 'Megamind' is without a doubt, worth more than just one viewing.

Dreamworks took the classic good vs. evil battle and gave all of us the answer to that burning question. So, what exactly does happen when evil finally triumphs? Megamind is Metro City's most notorious villain and all he wants to do is finally thwart Metroman or as he prefers to call him...Mr. Goody Two-shoes. After years and years of planning and plotting he finally did it! Then suddenly, something unusual happens...Megamind has nothing to do! He then realizes...there is only one thing left to do, create a new hero. Now, he has that accomplished it looks like the new hero has plans of his own and they are not for the good of mankind.This film was such a great comedy. While Pixar gave us 'The Incredible', 'Megamind' is a completely different story that plays on the fan boy fantasies. Throw a great comedic cast together and some of the best CGI Dreamworks has given us in years and you get a classic. Will Ferrel, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill and Brad Pitt give us a great combination of laughs and heart. It brings us into the minds of heroes and villains and shows us that they actually are more than just crazy gadgets and cheesy monologues. They are people and when the action takes a back seat in this film you see it and it is done quite well. Probably the biggest surprise in this film is David Cross as the voice of Minion. He always runs hot and cold with the average movie goers, but this time he shines and gives us such awesome moments in the film. It's the smart comedy and the timing of the jokes that makes this movie a real winner.If you are a parent looking for a movie for your young ones or if you are a classic comic book geek 'Megamind' delivers a one two punch.

1364782,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B003UESJF6,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[109, 126]","Megamind is something of a mix, but a good one. On the one hand, it takes the existing traditional tropes of comic-book superhero and supervillain and works within them, but at the same time it ventures into territory that one rarely sees, going one step beyond the traditional to answer two questions: (1) What really makes a supervillain truly 'bad'? and (2) What happens when the supervillain unexpectedly wins?The film starts off with a traditional hook - Megamind apparently falling to his doom - and then flashes back to the beginning, with the origins of the two classic protagonists, superhero Metro Man and supervillain Megamind, each sent out as an infant in a spacepod from their respective doomed homeworlds. From there, however, things begin to take a twist.  Megamind is the supervillain, but more from bad luck than anything else (Metro Man's pod lands in a mansion where he is adopted by rich parents who give him everything, Megamind's pod on the other hand lands in a penitentiary where he is adopted by the inmates).  Megamind doesn't become a supervillain so much out of evil as much as lack of options, his main talent apparently being wreaking havoc and scaring the hell out of people. He and Metro Man become enemies/rivals in a series of confrontations where, in Megminds own words ""Our battles quickly got more elaborate. He would win some, I would ALMOST win others!"".And, in classic comic-book tradition, a plucky news reporter, Roxanne Ritchie, and her hapless and socially inept camerman, Hal Stewart, are always on the scene when one of Megamind's schemes unfolds, with the result that Roxanne gets abducted so many times that it becomes almost routine (""Alligators, yeah, mm-hmm. I was thinking about it on the way over..."").But things take an unexpected twist when, in spite of all the glitches, Megamind's scheme actually works and Metro Man is apparently destroyed, leaving only a skeleton bearing his cape behind. At first Megamind is ecstatic, but after only a few days the supervillian finds himself at a loss as to what to do next.  What _does_ a supervillain do when he has no superhero to challenge or to be challenged by?In his existiential angst, Megamind unexpectedly ends up talking to Roxanne, albeit disguised as Bernard, a museum attendent at the Metro Man Museum. From her, he gets the inspiration to create a new superhero to restore the balance in his life. Unfortunately his plan goes hideously awry when the recipient of his superhero formula turns out to be Hal, Roxanne's inept and all too flawed camerman.And once again the story turns back to the question of just what makes a supervillain truly bad. Hal isn't evil per se, but he is lazy, petulant, completely self-centered and prone to tantrums when he doesn't get his way.  Highly destructive tantrums once he discovers that he, as the intended new superhero Titan, has powers that put him beyond anyone else's control. Jonah Hill as the voice of Hal/Titan manages to perfectly bring out these serious flaws in Titan's character that result in Titan becoming a far more menacing threat to society than the ostensibly 'evil' Megamind ever was.Craftsmanship-wise, everything in Megamind works well. The animation is colorful and eye-catching, the character design superb, and the voice actors distinctive and entertaining (Will Ferrell as Megamind, Brad Pitt as Metro Man, Tina Fey as Roxanne Ritchie, Jonah Hill as Hal Stewart/Titan, and David Cross as Minion). There are also a lot of references and in-jokes worked in, some fairly obvious (Minion's exo-suit with the diving helmet head and gorilla-like body are a direct take from the classicly-bad scifi film Robot Monster) and fairly subtle (the museum attendant Bernard is voiced by Ben Stiller, who played a museum guard named Bernard in the two Night At The Museum movies).Though the film was released at the theaters in 3D, you won't miss a thing seeing it on a DVD.  Quite frankly, the whole 3D thing is a waste in most movies that have come out with it and Megamind is no exception.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys good animation with entertaining characters and story.",5,What happens when the supervillain unexpectedly wins?,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,4145,"['Megamind', 'something', 'mix', 'good', 'one', 'one', 'hand', 'existing', 'traditional', 'tropes', 'comic-book', 'superhero', 'supervillain', 'works', 'same', 'time', 'ventures', 'territory', 'one', 'rarely', 'going', 'one', 'step', 'traditional', 'answer', 'two', 'questions', '1', 'What', 'really', 'supervillain', 'truly', '2', 'What', 'when', 'supervillain', 'unexpectedly', 'film', 'traditional', 'hook', 'Megamind', 'apparently', 'falling', 'doom', 'then', 'flashes', 'back', 'beginning', 'origins', 'two', 'classic', 'protagonists', 'superhero', 'Metro', 'Man', 'supervillain', 'Megamind', 'sent', 'out', 'infant', 'spacepod', 'respective', 'doomed', 'homeworlds', 'there', 'however', 'things', 'begin', 'take', 'twist', 'Megamind', 'supervillain', 'more', 'bad', 'luck', 'anything', 'else', 'Metro', 'Man', 'pod', 'mansion', 'where', 'adopted', 'rich', 'parents', 'who', 'give', 'everything', 'Megamind', 'pod', 'other', 'hand', 'lands', 'penitentiary', 'where', 'adopted', 'inmates', 'Megamind', ""n't"", 'become', 'supervillain', 'so', 'much', 'evil', 'as', 'much', 'lack', 'options', 'main', 'talent', 'apparently', 'being', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'scaring', 'hell', 'people', 'Metro', 'Man', 'become', 'enemies/rivals', 'series', 'confrontations', 'where', 'Megminds', 'own', 'words', 'battles', 'quickly', 'got', 'more', 'elaborate', 'would', 'win', 'would', 'ALMOST', 'win', 'others', '.And', 'classic', 'comic-book', 'tradition', 'plucky', 'news', 'reporter', 'Roxanne', 'Ritchie', 'hapless', 'socially', 'inept', 'camerman', 'Hal', 'Stewart', 'are', 'always', 'scene', 'when', 'one', 'Megamind', 'schemes', 'unfolds', 'result', 'Roxanne', 'abducted', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'almost', 'routine', 'Alligators', 'yeah', 'mm-hmm', 'was', 'thinking', 'way', '.But', 'things', 'take', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'when', 'spite', 'glitches', 'Megamind', 'scheme', 'actually', 'Metro', 'Man', 'apparently', 'destroyed', 'leaving', 'only', 'skeleton', 'bearing', 'cape', 'first', 'Megamind', 'ecstatic', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'supervillian', 'loss', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'What', '_does_', 'supervillain', 'do', 'when', 'superhero', 'challenge', 'be', 'challenged', 'existiential', 'angst', 'Megamind', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'talking', 'Roxanne', 'albeit', 'disguised', 'Bernard', 'museum', 'attendent', 'Metro', 'Man', 'Museum', 'inspiration', 'create', 'new', 'superhero', 'restore', 'balance', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'plan', 'hideously', 'awry', 'when', 'recipient', 'superhero', 'formula', 'out', 'be', 'Hal', 'Roxanne', 'inept', 'too', 'flawed', 'camerman.And', 'once', 'again', 'story', 'back', 'question', 'just', 'what', 'supervillain', 'truly', 'bad', 'Hal', ""n't"", 'evil', 'se', 'lazy', 'petulant', 'completely', 'self-centered', 'prone', 'tantrums', 'when', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'Highly', 'destructive', 'tantrums', 'once', 'intended', 'new', 'superhero', 'Titan', 'powers', 'put', 'anyone', 'else', 'control', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'voice', 'Hal/Titan', 'manages', 'perfectly', 'bring', 'out', 'serious', 'flaws', 'Titan', 'character', 'result', 'Titan', 'becoming', 'far', 'more', 'menacing', 'threat', 'society', 'ostensibly', 'Megamind', 'ever', 'was.Craftsmanship-wise', 'everything', 'Megamind', 'works', 'well', 'animation', 'colorful', 'eye-catching', 'character', 'design', 'superb', 'voice', 'actors', 'distinctive', 'entertaining', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Megamind', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Metro', 'Man', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Roxanne', 'Ritchie', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'Hal', 'Stewart/Titan', 'David', 'Cross', 'Minion', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'references', 'in-jokes', 'worked', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'Minion', 'exo-suit', 'diving', 'helmet', 'head', 'gorilla-like', 'body', 'are', 'direct', 'take', 'classicly-bad', 'scifi', 'film', 'Robot', 'Monster', 'fairly', 'subtle', 'museum', 'attendant', 'Bernard', 'voiced', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'who', 'played', 'museum', 'guard', 'named', 'Bernard', 'two', 'Night', 'Museum', 'movies', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', '3D', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'thing', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'whole', '3D', 'thing', 'waste', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'Megamind', 'exception.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'animation', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'story']",Megamind
