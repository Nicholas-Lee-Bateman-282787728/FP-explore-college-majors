814846,A2TAPL67U2A5HM,B0001W1BZU,Bjorn Viberg,"[1, 3]",Children of the Corn II~ Terence Knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage. The special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst. The acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production. The gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to Holly Upstairs acting school to write such junk. And to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me.,2,Children of the Corn II  ~ Terence Knox,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,684,"['Children', 'Corn', 'II~', 'Terence', 'Knox', 'movie', 'out', 'well', 'then', 'implodes', 'utter', 'garbage', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'then', 'first', 'movie', '9', 'years', 'later', 'even', 'worst', 'acting', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'liken', 'parody', 'then', 'one', 'serious', 'production', 'gore', 'factor', 'been', 'pushed', 'rediculous', 'level', 'storyline', 'out', 'well', 'then', 'implodes', 'utter', 'nonesense', 'dialogue', 'so', 'poorly', 'written', 'one', 'wonders', 'went', 'Holly', 'Upstairs', 'acting', 'school', 'write', 'such', 'junk', 'imagine', 'are', 'more', 'sequells', 'abomination', 'just']",N/A

814848,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0001W1BZU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","And so begins one of the most lame and downright inexplicable series of sequels in cinematic history.  While the original Children of the Corn was at least watchable, this first sequel is just stupid - there, I said it.  I could have said lame or amateurish or torturously boring, but I think stupid really is the best word for it.  As a huge Stephen King fan, I think it is important to forthrightly disavow this and a number of other pathetic movie sequels that exploit his name; King had nothing to do with the putrid storyline of this horrible film.Eight years after the release of Children of the Corn, we finally find out what happened to the children of Gatlin.  What is their punishment for murdering all of the adults in that town, including their parents?  Prison?  A loony bin?  Juvenile hall?  Try none of the above.  With Isaac dead, the authorities absolve the other children of any guilt whatsoever - and so all the rest of the murderous kids are shipped down the road to Hemingford to be welcomed into the homes of the townsfolk there.  Yeah, that makes sense.  All these schmucks apparently trust these bloodthirsty kids implicitly because they do nothing to stop them from wandering around town in spooky groups by day or roaming the corn fields by night as they seek guidance from He Who Walks Behind the Rows.  Yes, this great god of blood and corn is still so incredibly lame that he doesn't even have a proper name.  That's not all. Not content to simply torture viewers with the stupid storyline of the kids, the filmmakers also throw in an annoying tabloid reporter, his hateful and alienated son, and the revelation of a clich&eacute;d money-making conspiracy.I don't know what is more thrilling - watching this alienated father and son trade barbs or watching the herd of wholly non-photogenic kids chanting more of their mumbo jumbo.  Ryan Bollman does put a lot of effort into his role of Micah, the new leader of the corn-obsessed children, but I'm afraid he couldn't scare a hungry crow away from one of his beloved corn stalks.  He lacks any presence or charisma whatsoever.  All in all, Children of the Corn 2 is an exercise in cinematic futility, plagued by bad acting, a poorly written story, laughable special effects, and an almost complete lack of suspense.",2,These children shouldn't be seen or heard,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2294,"['so', 'one', 'most', 'lame', 'downright', 'inexplicable', 'series', 'sequels', 'cinematic', 'history', 'original', 'Children', 'Corn', 'was', 'least', 'watchable', 'first', 'sequel', 'just', 'stupid', 'there', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'lame', 'amateurish', 'torturously', 'boring', 'think', 'stupid', 'really', 'best', 'word', 'huge', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'think', 'important', 'forthrightly', 'disavow', 'number', 'other', 'pathetic', 'movie', 'sequels', 'name', 'King', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'putrid', 'storyline', 'horrible', 'film.Eight', 'years', 'release', 'Children', 'Corn', 'finally', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'children', 'Gatlin', 'What', 'punishment', 'murdering', 'adults', 'town', 'including', 'parents', 'Prison', 'A', 'loony', 'bin', 'Juvenile', 'hall', 'Try', 'none', 'above', 'Isaac', 'dead', 'authorities', 'absolve', 'other', 'children', 'guilt', 'whatsoever', 'so', 'rest', 'murderous', 'kids', 'are', 'shipped', 'road', 'Hemingford', 'be', 'welcomed', 'homes', 'townsfolk', 'there', 'Yeah', 'sense', 'schmucks', 'apparently', 'bloodthirsty', 'kids', 'implicitly', 'do', 'nothing', 'stop', 'wandering', 'around', 'town', 'spooky', 'groups', 'day', 'roaming', 'corn', 'fields', 'night', 'seek', 'guidance', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'Yes', 'great', 'god', 'blood', 'corn', 'still', 'so', 'incredibly', 'lame', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'proper', 'name', 'not', 'Not', 'content', 'simply', 'torture', 'viewers', 'stupid', 'storyline', 'kids', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'throw', 'annoying', 'tabloid', 'reporter', 'hateful', 'alienated', 'son', 'revelation', 'clich', 'eacute', 'money-making', 'conspiracy.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'more', 'thrilling', 'watching', 'alienated', 'father', 'son', 'trade', 'barbs', 'watching', 'herd', 'wholly', 'non-photogenic', 'kids', 'chanting', 'more', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'Ryan', 'Bollman', 'put', 'lot', 'effort', 'role', 'Micah', 'new', 'leader', 'corn-obsessed', 'children', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'could', ""n't"", 'scare', 'hungry', 'crow', 'away', 'one', 'beloved', 'corn', 'stalks', 'presence', 'charisma', 'whatsoever', 'Children', 'Corn', '2', 'exercise', 'cinematic', 'futility', 'plagued', 'bad', 'acting', 'poorly', 'written', 'story', 'laughable', 'special', 'effects', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'suspense']",N/A

Children of the Corn II is basically more of the same with some some pretty lame love stories thrown in, along with a single father and his teenage son who can't seem to get along.  Well, let me get these elements out of the way first.  The love stories are dull and uninteresting, though distract us enough in between the horror stuff to actually sit through an hour and half film.  The teenage son meets a young girl in the area and after meeting she already wants him to take her to New York...ah, young love.  And it doesn't take long for them to kiss, and then eventually, well, you know...and then there is dad, who easily comes across as a womanizer at times, and gets lucky with a local young woman as well.  By the end of the film, dad and son save each others lives from the corn children, and behold...good as new.But the film really comes down to the horror and these crazy children.  The group of kids we knew from the first film is dead, and a new group has emerged.  Like Isaac, there is a leader of the bunch who is possessed by evil, but his character is far less convincing than Isaac (not that Isaac made me want to do jumping jacks either).  Adults are murdered in various scenarios throughout the film, none of which are very scary, but only worth watching to see how original the death scenes can get.  Only one had somewhat of a scary impact, and it was in the local church.  A random man in the congregation begins bleeding out his nose, ears, and eventually spews blood over everyone.  It was the only creepy scene I felt in the movie.The ending of the film was extremely blah.  I suppose I don't want to give it away, so I won't say what happens, but it's all too cheesy and easy and somewhat similar to the first film's conclusion, minus all the ridiculous extra cheap effects.  Speaking of cheap, beware of this particular dvd.  For some reason it seems to be the only one available, but it views and sounds like a vhs tape.  Overall, its a bland horror film that just does not scare, and barely entertains.

814851,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B0001W1BZU,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[5, 7]","With the events in the original ""Children of the Corn"" having taken place, the Nebraska media swarms to the scene of the crime in Gatlin for part II of the ""Children of the Corn"" series, entitled simply ""Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice"".  The movie picks up with the media interviewing some of the surviving children from Gatlin about the horrible events they witnessed.The authorities decide that it is in the best interests of the children to be shipped to Hemingford which is only about 20 miles away from the terrible tragedy that occurred in Gatlin.  What ensues is not just a so-called horror movie but an incredible drama and a beautifully interwoven love story between a failed newspaper reporter and a local school teacher who has taken in one of the surviving members of the children of the corn.  However, not to be outdone, is the son, Danny, of the newspaper reporter who also has his sights set on a beautiful teenaged girl who just happens to be riding the desolate roads of Nebraska on her trusty moped, showing off her incredible beauty and dazzling the 80s flashback haircut of Danny.The drama is just as incredible as Danny and his father must face the disdain and resentment that each has for the other or they will utterly destroy each other.  However, will this drama and dual love stories be interrupted by the horror of the corn?!?  Fear not, for enter the brilliant indian professor whose powers go beyond that of just a college professor.  His all-knowing and ancient knowledge holds the key to the evil of not only the children of the corn, but also to evil itself, including all of the problems of the world.Will the indian professor and the failed journalist be able to stop the evil that now inhabits the town of Hemingford or will the town of Hemingford die like that of Gatlin?  Will the devil take over Hemingford and cause a chain reaction of disasters of epic proportions in corn fields all around the world??  Will the rest of the world ever be able to eat another ear of corn in peace???  And what of the love that the journalist and his son have for their beloved dansels in distress?  What will become of the greatest love story on film since ""Gone With the Wind""?  You must watch ""Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice"" to find out!  What a powerful drama-horror hybrid that sports syringe-injecting children, the nose-bleed that wouldn't quit, flying old women in wheelchairs and falling houses, on old women no less.If this sounds incredible ridiculous to you, I think you are on the right track.  If you're actually interested in this garbage, I guess you didn't pick up on my sarcasm.  At any rate, while the original ""Children of the Corn"" was not a great horror movie, it was original and entertaining to some degree even if it was light on the scares.  At least, there was a degree of creepiness in the original ""Children of the Corn"" that is clearly not present in the sequel.  However, ""Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice"" is as corny (pun intended!) as it sounds, and is really nothing more than a cheesy piece of film-making devoid of scares and totally devoid of atmosphere.  The sad thing is that this movie does take itself seriously, but it's completely laughable!!!  Even if it did not take itself seriously, it would still be terrible, but at least the creators would be smart enough to already realize this fact, which obviously they were not.I cannot recommend this garbage to any serious horror movie fan, notwithstanding the father-son drama or the love story which was beautifully interwoven into this masterpiece of garbage.  The acting wasn't awful, but it did come across as rather wooden at times, and the evil child who led the children this time was not nearly as convincing as Isaac and Malakai in part I of this series.  Finally, the creators did not do a good job of the corn ceremonies like they did in the original, and the dreaded ""He who walks behind the rows"" was more of an afterthought in this one instead of the ultimate focus of the evil in the original.  At least, the mystery of the unknown with the demon in the original was present, but, in the sequel, the treatment of the demon was not nearly as developed.""Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice"" comes off very artificial, superficial, and completely lifeless unlike its predecessor which was at least original and entertaining (admittedly, a guilty pleasure of mine) even if it was not a good horror movie.",1,"""He who walks behind the rows"" is at it again!!!",1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,4480,"['events', 'original', 'Children', 'Corn', 'having', 'taken', 'place', 'Nebraska', 'media', 'swarms', 'scene', 'crime', 'Gatlin', 'part', 'II', 'Children', 'Corn', 'series', 'entitled', 'simply', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'movie', 'up', 'media', 'interviewing', 'surviving', 'children', 'Gatlin', 'horrible', 'events', 'witnessed.The', 'authorities', 'decide', 'best', 'interests', 'children', 'be', 'shipped', 'Hemingford', 'only', 'about', '20', 'miles', 'away', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'occurred', 'Gatlin', 'What', 'not', 'just', 'so-called', 'horror', 'movie', 'incredible', 'drama', 'beautifully', 'interwoven', 'love', 'story', 'failed', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'local', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'taken', 'one', 'surviving', 'members', 'children', 'corn', 'However', 'not', 'be', 'outdone', 'son', 'Danny', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'also', 'sights', 'set', 'beautiful', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'riding', 'desolate', 'roads', 'Nebraska', 'trusty', 'moped', 'showing', 'off', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'dazzling', '80s', 'flashback', 'haircut', 'Danny.The', 'drama', 'just', 'as', 'incredible', 'Danny', 'father', 'must', 'face', 'disdain', 'resentment', 'other', 'will', 'utterly', 'destroy', 'other', 'However', 'will', 'drama', 'dual', 'love', 'stories', 'be', 'interrupted', 'horror', 'corn', 'Fear', 'not', 'enter', 'brilliant', 'indian', 'professor', 'powers', 'go', 'just', 'college', 'professor', 'all-knowing', 'ancient', 'knowledge', 'key', 'evil', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'corn', 'also', 'evil', 'including', 'problems', 'world.Will', 'indian', 'professor', 'failed', 'journalist', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'evil', 'now', 'town', 'Hemingford', 'will', 'town', 'Hemingford', 'die', 'Gatlin', 'Will', 'devil', 'take', 'Hemingford', 'cause', 'chain', 'reaction', 'disasters', 'epic', 'proportions', 'corn', 'fields', 'world', 'Will', 'rest', 'world', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'eat', 'ear', 'corn', 'peace', 'what', 'love', 'journalist', 'son', 'have', 'beloved', 'dansels', 'distress', 'What', 'will', 'become', 'greatest', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'must', 'watch', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'find', 'out', 'What', 'powerful', 'drama-horror', 'hybrid', 'sports', 'syringe-injecting', 'children', 'nose-bleed', 'would', ""n't"", 'quit', 'flying', 'old', 'women', 'wheelchairs', 'falling', 'houses', 'old', 'women', 'less.If', 'incredible', 'ridiculous', 'think', 'are', 'right', 'track', ""'re"", 'actually', 'interested', 'garbage', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'sarcasm', 'rate', 'original', 'Children', 'Corn', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'original', 'entertaining', 'degree', 'even', 'was', 'light', 'scares', 'least', 'was', 'degree', 'creepiness', 'original', 'Children', 'Corn', 'clearly', 'not', 'present', 'sequel', 'However', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'corny', 'pun', 'intended', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'cheesy', 'piece', 'film-making', 'devoid', 'scares', 'totally', 'devoid', 'atmosphere', 'sad', 'thing', 'movie', 'take', 'seriously', 'completely', 'laughable', 'Even', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'terrible', 'least', 'creators', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'already', 'realize', 'fact', 'obviously', 'were', 'not.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'garbage', 'serious', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'notwithstanding', 'father-son', 'drama', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'beautifully', 'interwoven', 'masterpiece', 'garbage', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'awful', 'did', 'come', 'rather', 'wooden', 'times', 'evil', 'child', 'who', 'led', 'children', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'convincing', 'Isaac', 'Malakai', 'part', 'series', 'Finally', 'creators', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'corn', 'ceremonies', 'did', 'original', 'dreaded', 'who', 'walks', 'rows', 'was', 'more', 'afterthought', 'one', 'instead', 'ultimate', 'focus', 'evil', 'original', 'least', 'mystery', 'unknown', 'demon', 'original', 'was', 'present', 'sequel', 'treatment', 'demon', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'developed', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'off', 'very', 'artificial', 'superficial', 'completely', 'lifeless', 'predecessor', 'was', 'least', 'original', 'entertaining', 'admittedly', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'horror', 'movie']",N/A

I was lucky enough to get half my money back from this terrible DVD, and used the money to buy the newly released version for only $6.99 shipped. The 2011 version is much better, clearer, brighter, and more colorful. It also has scenes that were cut from the Top Ten Media release. I really feel sorry for the people that still have the Top Ten Media release. They'll never be able to sell it now, especially since the new 2011 DVD is really cheap, and way better quality. If they are lucky enough to sell it, they will just get pennies, and not even get close to what they paid for it. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! Buy the 2011 official DVD release!!",1,fantastic sequel.

Well, lets get right into this.This movie focuses around the surviving kids from Gatlin, are getting adopted by a neighboring town. All the kids seem to be normal at this point, lots of older kids in this one that the original. Well, our main characters are a reporter and his son, trying to find information about the happenings. The reporter eventually teams up with a native American, who tries to help him.One night, the kids have a meeting in the cornfield, while one of the children gets possessed by a spirit in the cornfield, and he starts controlling all the other kids, and soon they end up killing the whole town, a majority of the adults die in a building fire.So its up the Native American, reporter, his son, and the son and the reporters girlfriend that have to try to stop the evil. Unfortunatly, one of them die, but the ending still played in out in a peacful manner. Also towards the ending they had a great corn harvester death, which was a pretty cool death scene, this movie had great effects throughout.Theres one warning I have for you about, DO NOT buy this DVD, it is so overpriced, buy the Paramount VHS, the VHS has way better picture, plus it has some added effects, added scenes, and alternate music at some points, the DVD does not feature it, but I still recommend the VHS. Even though I recommend it, it was nothing too special, so I gave it 3/5.",3,Children of the Corn II (1993),1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,1555,"['Well', 'Children', 'Corn', 'was', 'decent', 'horror', 'flick', 'was', 'only', 'COTC', 'film', 'be', 'made', '80s', 'now', 'are', '90s', 'where', 'majority', 'sequels', 'take', 'place', 'Well', 'get', 'right', 'this.This', 'movie', 'surviving', 'kids', 'Gatlin', 'are', 'getting', 'adopted', 'neighboring', 'town', 'kids', 'seem', 'be', 'normal', 'point', 'lots', 'older', 'kids', 'one', 'original', 'Well', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'reporter', 'son', 'trying', 'find', 'information', 'happenings', 'reporter', 'eventually', 'up', 'native', 'American', 'who', 'help', 'him.One', 'night', 'kids', 'have', 'meeting', 'cornfield', 'one', 'children', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'cornfield', 'controlling', 'other', 'kids', 'soon', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'whole', 'town', 'majority', 'adults', 'die', 'building', 'fire.So', 'Native', 'American', 'reporter', 'son', 'son', 'reporters', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'try', 'stop', 'evil', 'Unfortunatly', 'one', 'die', 'ending', 'still', 'played', 'out', 'peacful', 'manner', 'Also', 'ending', 'had', 'great', 'corn', 'harvester', 'death', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'death', 'scene', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'effects', 'one', 'warning', 'have', 'DO', 'NOT', 'buy', 'DVD', 'so', 'overpriced', 'buy', 'Paramount', 'VHS', 'VHS', 'way', 'better', 'picture', 'added', 'effects', 'added', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'music', 'points', 'DVD', 'not', 'feature', 'still', 'recommend', 'VHS', 'Even', 'recommend', 'was', 'nothing', 'too', 'special', 'gave', '3/5']",N/A

Unfortunately, this is also the only copy of this movie that is in region one; there's a region two set with this and the first CotC movie plus the third one, but beyond that it seems like CotC will never have an official release and if you want to see it you better kick it into high gear because this item may be uber rare in the near future.The menu is lame, with only six options for scene selecting, the obviously photoshopped title and a button to play the whole thing, which only furthers my suspicions. I only wish I knew if my DVD player was multi-region or not, so I could just buy the UK box set and maybe the Argentinan sixth enstallment (apparently it has extra footage).My advice: if you live in the US and you want to see every CotC film including this one, you may want to pick it up. Otherwise, just go with the UK set; it has commentary and a trailer, a lot more than this cheap conversion has. In fact, I may just have to purchase the UK set soon.Actually, just get the VHS. This DVD has some footage cut from it that's present in the US VHS.
