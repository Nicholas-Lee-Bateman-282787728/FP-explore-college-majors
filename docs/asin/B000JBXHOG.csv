Plenty of historical scenes.  What I didn't like about it is that it doesn't give you anything new that someone who has studied ancient religion would not already know.

You will get a quick introduction to the major gods spelled out by experts.  Happily, they are all reasonably entertaining speakers.  The material is presented at a good pace but if you are a novice there is a LOT of material here for a single sitting.  One nice feature that others have not mentioned is the discussion of the integration of Greek/Roman religions and cultures into/with other cultures.  The discussion of the parallels between these religions and Christianity is thought provoking.  If you don't know much about the Greek/Roman gods and want to start building a foundation this is a great place to start.",4,Introduction to the gods and culture,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,704,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'solid', 'video', 'introducing', 'Greek/Roman', 'mythology', 'will', 'get', 'quick', 'introduction', 'major', 'gods', 'spelled', 'out', 'experts', 'Happily', 'are', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'speakers', 'material', 'presented', 'good', 'pace', 'are', 'novice', 'LOT', 'material', 'here', 'single', 'sitting', 'One', 'nice', 'feature', 'others', 'have', 'not', 'mentioned', 'discussion', 'integration', 'Greek/Roman', 'religions', 'cultures', 'into/with', 'other', 'cultures', 'discussion', 'parallels', 'religions', 'Christianity', 'thought', 'provoking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Greek/Roman', 'gods', 'want', 'start', 'building', 'foundation', 'great', 'place', 'start']",Gods And Goddesses
