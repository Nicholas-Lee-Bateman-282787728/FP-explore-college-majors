Definitely not a show to recommend to kids.Warning, this show is very HEAVY on ecchi content (think girls wearing very revealing outfits, if anything at all), with a lot of allusion towards sexual content (though it never happens, although the included OVA does get really close to it). In fact, the main heroine, Chizuru, constantly tries to force the main hero, Kouta, into doing naughty things with her almost once an episode, but he largely resists it. If you're not into that type of stuff, this show may not be for you. There is a lot of comedy in this show as well, but if you don't want to deal with the ecchi elements, you may want to try another anime.Story-wise, this is a show about a boy, Kouta, who is attending a high school where some youkai (Japanese word for demons) also attend, mainly to learn about human life and culture so they can adapt and live in a world dominated by humans. He runs into Chizuru almost immediately, and she becomes obsessed with him almost instantly. He later finds out that she's actually a 400 year old kitsune (Japanese for ""fox""). Throughout the series, he learns to handle her antics, as well as those around him, including a second girl also attempting to get into his pants, Nozumu, who forms the other part of the love triangle in this show.Aside from the previously mentioned ecchi, this show is mostly slice-of-life, which shows the character's everyday lives and how they go about it, along with lots of fantasy and comedy thrown into it. Some battles do take place, but most of the violence is largely cartoonish and mostly meant to be funny. Overall, it's not too the greatest nor most memorable anime ever, but if you like ecchi material, this show delivers it in spades.",3,Kind of generic ecchi anime.,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,1854,"['Figured', 'should', 'start', 'review', 'disclaimer/warning', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'show', 'Definitely', 'not', 'show', 'recommend', 'kids.Warning', 'show', 'very', 'HEAVY', 'ecchi', 'content', 'think', 'girls', 'wearing', 'very', 'revealing', 'outfits', 'anything', 'lot', 'allusion', 'towards', 'sexual', 'content', 'never', 'included', 'OVA', 'get', 'really', 'close', 'fact', 'main', 'heroine', 'Chizuru', 'constantly', 'force', 'main', 'hero', 'Kouta', 'doing', 'naughty', 'things', 'almost', 'episode', 'largely', ""'re"", 'not', 'type', 'stuff', 'show', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'lot', 'comedy', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'deal', 'ecchi', 'elements', 'may', 'want', 'try', 'anime.Story-wise', 'show', 'boy', 'Kouta', 'who', 'attending', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'youkai', 'Japanese', 'word', 'demons', 'also', 'attend', 'mainly', 'learn', 'human', 'life', 'culture', 'can', 'adapt', 'live', 'world', 'dominated', 'humans', 'Chizuru', 'almost', 'immediately', 'obsessed', 'almost', 'instantly', 'later', 'out', 'actually', '400', 'year', 'old', 'kitsune', 'Japanese', 'fox', 'series', 'handle', 'antics', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'second', 'girl', 'also', 'attempting', 'get', 'pants', 'Nozumu', 'who', 'forms', 'other', 'part', 'love', 'triangle', 'show.Aside', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'ecchi', 'show', 'mostly', 'slice-of-life', 'character', 'everyday', 'lives', 'how', 'go', 'lots', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'thrown', 'battles', 'do', 'take', 'place', 'most', 'violence', 'largely', 'cartoonish', 'mostly', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'Overall', 'not', 'too', 'greatest', 'most', 'memorable', 'anime', 'ever', 'like', 'ecchi', 'material', 'show', 'spades']",Kanokons: The Girl Who Cried Fox TV & OVA Collection
1531205,A2AOUHBZ1HXO5D,B007I1TGOA,Avantel,"[3, 5]","Japanese anime mixes humor with sexiness very often, which I like a lot a bit often. ""Kanokon"" is one more of these series about  a beautiful girl(s) in crazy love of total wimp, to the point of willing to become his servant(s). Kanokon is quite comic at the beginning with the girls teasing and chasing this wimp, Kouta. However it also gets serious shortly after the first chapters when his main chaser, Chizuru, gets quite stressed and miserable because of Kouta's confusing attitudes: he recognizes Chizuru's love at times and at others he's dismissive in his typically infuriating nice ways covered-up with his smile. For example, he rejects to introduce whichever relatives of his to Chizuru. But the very worst is rejecting Chizuru's love-making offers like if they were pure poison, you couldn't believe how repulsively feminine he cried when covering Chizuru's vagina while shocked in terror.Besides making me laugh, the show left me thinking. To start with, Kouta -like any man- had as much right as any woman to refuse any proposal, regardless of how hurt his prospects get and likewise she must be incarcerated if she forced him. However many men may well disagree with me.At least what is clear to me is that while ""pervert"" is mentioned all the time in this type of anime when a man simply likes women (a totally natural thing) the real perversion in these Japanese programs is righteous guys rejecting forbidden love, sex & simple company that normal people want; righteous guys who somehow do accept their prospects services, like their food offering. At the end, the biggest perversion is this whole fantasy of getting someone highly  desirable begging to a worthless wimp, just to be rejected by this wimp being so righteous when in fact the very reason he (or she as well) rejects is because of: (A) being a wimp,(B) crazy, (C) stupid or all of the above. In any case I think Kanokon stands out above the rest in these traits, with the truly nice exception that the ""nice"" guy doesn't keep yelling the whole time, but that's due to his outstanding wimpness.Finally, if you want to see sex skip these programs and instead go to some porn rental shop. Ironically anime seems to have more sane options in porn than in these types that I don't even know how to classify. The only 3 porn anime shows that I chose to rent showed healthy relations that either continued `til marriage or finished their deal, nobody insanely after some moron. There weren't comic though.",2,What the real perversion is,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,2481,"['Japanese', 'anime', 'mixes', 'humor', 'sexiness', 'very', 'often', 'like', 'lot', 'bit', 'often', 'Kanokon', 'one', 'more', 'series', 'beautiful', 'girl', 's', 'crazy', 'love', 'total', 'wimp', 'point', 'willing', 'become', 'servant', 's', 'Kanokon', 'quite', 'comic', 'beginning', 'girls', 'teasing', 'chasing', 'wimp', 'Kouta', 'However', 'also', 'serious', 'shortly', 'first', 'chapters', 'when', 'main', 'chaser', 'Chizuru', 'quite', 'stressed', 'miserable', 'Kouta', 'confusing', 'attitudes', 'Chizuru', 'love', 'times', 'others', 'dismissive', 'typically', 'infuriating', 'nice', 'ways', 'covered-up', 'smile', 'example', 'introduce', 'whichever', 'relatives', 'Chizuru', 'very', 'worst', 'rejecting', 'Chizuru', 'love-making', 'offers', 'were', 'pure', 'poison', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'repulsively', 'feminine', 'cried', 'when', 'covering', 'Chizuru', 'vagina', 'shocked', 'terror.Besides', 'making', 'show', 'left', 'thinking', 'start', 'Kouta', 'man-', 'had', 'much', 'right', 'woman', 'refuse', 'proposal', 'regardless', 'how', 'hurt', 'prospects', 'get', 'likewise', 'must', 'be', 'incarcerated', 'forced', 'However', 'many', 'men', 'may', 'well', 'disagree', 'me.At', 'least', 'what', 'clear', 'pervert', 'mentioned', 'time', 'type', 'anime', 'when', 'man', 'simply', 'likes', 'women', 'totally', 'natural', 'thing', 'real', 'perversion', 'Japanese', 'programs', 'righteous', 'guys', 'rejecting', 'forbidden', 'love', 'sex', 'simple', 'company', 'normal', 'people', 'want', 'righteous', 'guys', 'who', 'somehow', 'do', 'accept', 'prospects', 'services', 'food', 'offering', 'end', 'biggest', 'perversion', 'whole', 'fantasy', 'getting', 'someone', 'highly', 'desirable', 'begging', 'worthless', 'wimp', 'just', 'be', 'rejected', 'wimp', 'being', 'so', 'righteous', 'when', 'fact', 'very', 'reason', 'as', 'well', 'rejects', 'being', 'wimp', 'B', 'crazy', 'C', 'stupid', 'above', 'case', 'think', 'Kanokon', 'out', 'rest', 'traits', 'truly', 'nice', 'exception', 'nice', 'guy', ""n't"", 'keep', 'yelling', 'whole', 'time', 'due', 'outstanding', 'wimpness.Finally', 'want', 'see', 'sex', 'skip', 'programs', 'instead', 'go', 'porn', 'rental', 'shop', 'Ironically', 'anime', 'have', 'more', 'sane', 'options', 'porn', 'types', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'classify', 'only', '3', 'porn', 'anime', 'chose', 'rent', 'showed', 'healthy', 'relations', 'continued', 'til', 'marriage', 'finished', 'deal', 'nobody', 'insanely', 'moron', 'were', ""n't"", 'comic']",Kanokons: The Girl Who Cried Fox TV & OVA Collection
1531206,A2NM2VS0KAJ3CC,B007I1TGOA,Green Dragon,"[0, 0]","Kanokon is an anime based on a manga and light novel series of the same name. The story involves a boy who transfers to a new high school, only to fall in love with a girl who's also a supernatural being (fox spirit)! Sounds familiar doesn't it?Despite its cliches, it is pretty funny and  has its heart-felt moments. It's a romantic comedy that filled with ecchi humor and has relationship obstacles  that the main characters have to overcome.The anime follows the manga rather well. There's plenty of memorable moments and characters that you would remember from the original story. The anime has its own unique moments, while also honoring the most memorable events from the manga/light novel. The animation is pretty good for this kind of anime, and the music is both fitting and AWESOME!The OVA collection is FAN SERVICE, FAN SERVICE, FAN SERVICE!! You either love it or hate it!I first saw this anime on CrunchyRoll and I enjoyed it right away. I would highly recommend it to any fans of supernatural/ecchi anime. If you liked Rosario+Vampire, High School DXD and Sekirei, then you will definitely like this anime!My only disappointment is that there was some potential for a second season but there was never a follow-up on that idea.

Flat-chested monotone-speaking wolf-demon who is equally flirtatious and closer to his age who is okay with being the one he ends up cheating on her for in the future. Tons of panties, breasts, cleavage, and also... there is a photo gallery. The photo gallery is amazingly ecchi! This anime is very sexy and fun to watch.

1531208,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B007I1TGOA,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[12, 12]","Kanokon is a lot of fun to watch. It reminded me a lot of Rosario Vampire, Maburaho, or Tenchi. It's your typical story about a high school guy that has a couple chicks that are way out of his league hanging all over him. Kota , the main character, is kind of a short and underdeveloped kid that could pass for like 12 years old. He's a good kid, but it's hard to fathom this hot chick that's totally stacked trying to give it all to him in the music room during school hours. That's one of the things that makes anime interesting though. Kota is a new high school student who attracts the attention of a Yokai Fox girl named Chizuru. She's a ditzy girl, but she's totally loyal and devoted to Kota. Her favorite thing is nearly suffocating him in her huge chest. Kota also gains antoher potential lover named Nozomu. Nozomu is a Yokai Wolf. She's kind of small and underdeveloped like he is. The anime is basically about the two girls competing for his attention. Anyway, the animation is great, the music is good, and there are plenty of fun magical characters that keep you wanting to know what happens next. There's not a real concrete story line, but Kanokon is a whole lot of fun from beginning to end. I recommend Kanokon and all the other animes I mentioned earlier to anyone who likes a lot of laughs and a good romantic comedy. WARNING!
