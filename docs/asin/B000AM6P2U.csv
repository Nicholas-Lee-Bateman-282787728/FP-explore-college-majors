928578,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000AM6P2U,Alex Udvary,"[0, 1]","Since 1969 Woody Allen has made one film every year, more or less, although last year he didn't make one. So Allen has decided to give us two films in one, to make up for things.""Melinda and Melinda"" is about two writers, who are with some friends, sitting down discussing what is life? Is it a comedy or drama? Wallace Shaw (""Manhattan"", ""Shadows & Fog"") plays the comedy writer, Larry Pine (Malle's ""Vanya on 42nd Street"") plays the dramatic writer. They are each told a story about a woman named Melinda and are asked how they see the story. Each writer gives us different scenarios in which Melinda will find herself.Allen has sort of played around with alternating stories in a single movie before, right now I'm thinking of ""Deconstructing Harry"", where Allen played a novelist who inserts his real life into his work. So we would get the book version of his life and then see what actually happened in real life. In both cases there is room for confusion. Which version are we seeing. There were moments, when for a split second I become confused because you see Melinda is played by the same actress in both stories; Radha Mitchell. Although the supporting players are different. Allen decided on using a musical gimmick to seperate the stories. You see, whenever the scenes are played for drama Allen puts in classical music, Stravinsky or Bartok, when scenes are played for comedy we hear jazz music, usually Erroll Garner strumming away at the piano with such tunes as ""The Best Things In Life Are Free"" and ""Will You Still Be Mine?""In the drama part of the film Melinda is a recently divorced woman who was cheating on her husband, and is no longer able to see her two children. She is also an alcoholic and depressive.In the comedy part Melinda is a divorced woman who's husband cheated on her (See the difference between comedy and drama?) And is a pill popper.The drama stars Chloe Sevigny as Melinda's old college pal and Johnny Lee Miller as her husband. In the comedy Amanda Peet and Will Ferrell are her upstairs neighbors. With Will Farrell in the ""Woody Allen"" role. If you thought Kenneth Branagh was annoying and out of place in ""Celebrity"" wait till you see Farrell. He stutters, waves his hands, and mimics Allen's body lanuage down to the tee. We almost cringe at a scene in the Hamptons. The ""Woody Allen"" style of acting simply does not suit Farrell. Why does Allen allow these people to mimic his behavior? It only seems to be truly effective when Allen does it. There is just something funny about his voice, his phrasing that can make certain jokes work that if someone else tries it doesn't have the same appeal.Of the two stories the comedy actually works best and grabs our interest more. The drama seems a bit hazy and on autopilot. The comedy part of the film could stand alone as its own film. Though Mitchell and Chloe Sevigny are quite good in their roles. But the comedy really pulls the film together as Allen has written some great one-liners for Ferrell.If ""Melinda and Melinda"" has faults they lie in the casting. Allen, whom has said many times before prefers stories dealing with female characters has given the men, except for Ferrell and Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Dirty Pretty Things""), who plays a pianist named Ellis Moonsong in the drama version, some pretty bland dialogue but has given the women, except for Amanda Peet, the best parts in the film.But what is ""Melinda and Melinda"" really all about? The film suggest it is trying to tell us life is what we make of it. There are good moments and bad. Life can be funny or sad, But the film could also be seen as a look inside the creative process. How exactly do we seperate comedy and drama? How do we decide which would be the best way to tell a story. Or how does Allen decide himself?I, unlike many people have enjoyed Woody Allen's recent films. But, if I've been wrong to do so, ""Melinda and Melinda"" is one of his best in recent years. It is much better than ""Small Time Crooks"", ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and ""Anything Else"". Here he has a film that seems to have some substance to it. It gives the viewer something to think about. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this movie will mke any new Woody Allen fans. I think those days are over with. We are all pretty much set in where we stand. We enjoy his films are we don't. It has become very fashionable to dislike his films and give the age old standard complaints that he is too old to act along side younger women (although Allen has no part in this film), are his movies are not as good as they were 30 years ago..ect. I've reviewed a lot of films by Allen and have praised them and I usally get a low amount of feedback (positive or negative) but the one time I was hardest on him and offered a good amount of hard comments I received the most amount of helpful votes I've ever gotten for a Woody Allen film. I think that says a lot.So I recommend this movie to Woody Allen fans and no one else.Bottom-line: One of Woody Allen's best films in recent times. Has a couple of low spots but the film still works. Has some very funny one-liners.",4,The Sorrow & The Witty,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,5114,"['1969', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'made', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'more', 'less', 'last', 'year', 'did', ""n't"",

With one of these Melinda's, he presents a woman contagiously destructive but simultaneously appealing. As if speaking of the director, a female character says, ""Doug always likes complicated women."" He also continues his long ode to the metrosexual, sensitive man with lines like, ""I saw you crying over Mahler."" These men cry over music and the women are totally impressed. The women here lust poetry, and are enthralled by conversation not involving their own persons. All of which I renounce with the phrase, ""Yeah, right."" Go tell it to Oprah, Woody. Once again, the characters depicted showcase our liberal director's distaste and avoidance of the common man. Everyone of these characters is an elitist yuppie. They all went to Brandeis and Northwestern, and their music is being played by ensembles at Yale. They go to the Hamptons and eat at the Caf&eacute; Gitane. Caf&eacute; Gitane, indeed. The black character is presented as being the perfect man. He is amused when told how slutty his girlfriend is, and that she was ""post-modern in bed."" Sure he is.Some of his dialogue, with its reflexive anti-male posturing, suggests that he may have developed a feminist outlook stemming from his own personal guilt. Not surprisingly then, this dialogue is as absurd as it could possibly be. There probably is not a woman on this earth who talks like Malinda in the first scenario. One of the characters strings  together an appalling string of clich&eacute;s like, ""you're music's full of feeling,"" and ""I looked right through to your soul."" One has to wonder how the key grip or boom man avoided taking a red pen to this droll text. The biggest obstacle, I believe, to Woody's success with these later films is that the actors are far too attractive for the subjects portrayed. Will Farrell is too masculine and buoyant to be an Allensesque metrosexual. I simply could not buy it; despite Farrell's fine efforts.At this point, I have to say that Woody Allen had several brilliant stories within him. He told them all masterfully years ago, but clearly, his talent has waned. He knows nothing of this age. The men and women he shows us bare no relation to what actually is.

One writer interprets the situation as a tragedy and the other interprets the situation as a comedy.The remainder of the movie plays out the two different plots with a single actress, Radha Mitchell, playing the central character, Melinda, in both the comedy and the tragedy. Unlike a similar scenario in the famous Kurasawa movie, `Rashoman', the two interpretations are not different ways of seeing the same events. The plot in the two threads diverges markedly after the initial arrival of Melinda at the dinner party of two completely different sets of characters.Unlike most of Allen's other movies, this cast is not packed to the gills with famous names and faces itching to appear in one of the Woodman's films. The only three actors who I recognize by name or face are Will Ferrell, Amanda Peet, and Allen regular, Wallace Shawn. Woody doesn't even appear in the movie himself, although I swear Ferrell's lines and personality were written for the stock Woody Allen nebbish character. Even though Ferrell looks much more like the character typically played by Tony Roberts in earlier Allen films, in this work, the tall guy with the short curly hair is the out of work clueless character, being supported by his wife in her job as a film writer and director.Another twist which raises the story above the mundane is the fact that the two story lines are neither purely comedy or tragedy, although the comic story, woven by Shawn and starring Ferrell does end on a happy note, while the tragic story line does end unhappily, albeit not in total tragedy as you would understand that term as applied to `Macbeth' or `Hamlet'.On the back of the CD case, Rolling Stone is quoted as saying that `You'll laugh till it hurts'. Well, I didn't even laugh once. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie. The charm and the humanity of the performers in playing out Allen's ideas was well worth the price of admission. Another blurb declares that Ferrell delivers a `laugh out loud performance', making it sound like his performance in `Elf'. Ferrell committed himself much better in this movie than in his more slapstick / comic strip efforts in recent movies, proving to me that he is as good an actor as people have so often said he is. This may very well be my favorite Ferrell performance since his appearance in Kevin Smith's `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'.This is not Allen's best effort, although it may be his best among his last few outings. It is also not quite as crisp as, for example, `Sideways', one of the few intelligently funny movies other than Herr Doktor Allen's works lately. But, as intelligent, adult entertainment goes, this will tide me over until Woody produces another `Manhattan'.Recommended.",4,"Excellent little work.

Even if you look at it as a drama, the character of Melinda is far too needy to find sympathy for her. She's just pathetic. A group of friends try to straighten out this emotional woman in two different versions of her sappy life, creations of another group of people sitting around a table. Melinda has had a perfect marriage to a doctor and two great kids. She gets bored with her perfect life, has an affair that blows up in her face, and is forbidden to see her children ever again (sound familiar?). Sometimes I wonder if Allen isn't caught up in a 'dog chases its tail' mode where he can't shake his own marital failures long enough to write something different so his movies must make us suffer through a long line of men or women with self-inflicted wounds. As for the character of Melinda, both versions get so frustrating that I'm mouthing 'Oh, kill yourself already!' If I were wallowing in self pity presently, I just might have been able to tolerate the over the top, poor-pitiful-me circle going on.

The two- nebbishy New York intellectual and gorgeous blond Australian actress- are the two essential ingredients in Allen's latest film, Melinda And Melinda, which just opened in Texas last week. While not at the level of the greatest Allen films from his Golden Age of 1977-1992 it is a significant step above his last few meager outings, and hearkens back to some of those earlier classics. Like Broadway Danny Rose it is a film that is told to the audience via raconteurs at a restaurant, like Annie Hall it is a romantic comedy, and like Interiors it is a European type parlor drama.The film opens with four people discussing philosophy- more cogently the merits of tragedy versus comedy, after one of them proffers a tale, and asks two older playwrights (the two sides of Allen himself) to opine on whether the tale would work better as a comedy or tragedy. The tragedian Max (Larry Pine), who thinks life funny, expounds the tragic aspects of it while the comic writer Sy (Wallace Shawn), who thinks life is sad, does the comedic aspects, and thus the viewer is taken into the two tales of Melinda, whose `real' tale has been elided at the beginning.... In a sense, a film that this is reminiscent of is the late 1990s Gwyneth Paltrow film Sliding Doors, which follows the lives of the same character if and if she did not make a choice to do something. In this film, Melinda is two different conceptions, not the same character in two differently conceived settings, although Radha Mitchell excels as both versions- an augury of her major talent. Neither film, as constituted, would work separately, and I doubt either could, even if rounded out. But, because of its bifurcated nature, and the lack of traditional structuring in each half there is a sense of wanting more left on the viewer's palate- not a bad thing, but knowing we see more on the plate, yet cannot touch it is frustrating; the definition of a Woody Allen film in his post-Golden Age.",3,Solid,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,2022,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'big', 'star', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'will', 'be', 'big', 'star', 'two-', 'nebbishy', 'New', 'York', 'intellectual', 'gorgeous', 'blond', 'Australian', 'actress-', 'are', 'two', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'Allen', 'latest', 'film', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'just', 'opened', 'Texas', 'last', 'week', 'not', 'level', 'greatest', 'Allen', 'films', 'Golden', 'Age', '1977-1992', 'significant', 'step', 'last', 'few', 'meager', 'outings', 'back', 'earlier', 'classics', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'film', 'told', 'audience', 'raconteurs', 'restaurant', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Interiors', 'European', 'type', 'parlor', 'drama.The', 'film', 'four', 'people', 'discussing', 'philosophy-', 'more', 'cogently', 'merits', 'tragedy', 'versus', 'comedy', 'one', 'tale', 'two', 'older', 'playwrights', 'two', 'sides', 'Allen', 'opine', 'tale', 'would', 'work', 'better', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'tragedian', 'Max', 'Larry', 'Pine', 'who', 'life', 'funny', 'tragic', 'aspects', 'comic', 'writer', 'Sy', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'who', 'life', 'sad', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'thus', 'viewer', 'taken', 'two', 'tales', 'Melinda', 'real', 'tale', 'been', 'elided', 'beginning', 'sense', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'late', '1990s', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'film', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'lives', 'same', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'choice', 'do', 'something', 'film', 'Melinda', 'two', 'different', 'conceptions', 'not', 'same', 'character', 'two', 'differently', 'conceived', 'settings', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'excels', 'versions-', 'augury', 'major', 'talent', 'film', 'constituted', 'would', 'work', 'separately', 'doubt', 'could', 'even', 'rounded', 'out', 'bifurcated', 'nature', 'lack', 'traditional', 'structuring', 'half', 'sense', 'wanting', 'more', 'left', 'viewer', 'palate-', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'knowing', 'see', 'more', 'plate', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'touch', 'frustrating', 'definition', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'post-Golden', 'Age']",N/A

I've been a fan of Sevigny since Boys Don't Cry and her performance here is spot on.  The stories are similer yet different and the outcomes are purly the authors perseptions of life.

928596,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000AM6P2U,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[1, 5]","I liked Woody Allen's ""Melinda And Melinda"" for a few main reasons. Its two stories were both extremely well done and not in any way underdeveloped. It had Radha Mitchell, a great actress who shined in a cameo in ""Phone Booth"" and brought me to tears in both ""Man On Fire"" and ""Finding Neverland"", is in two roles here, and great in both. The movie also had three plots among its two stories. In the drama plot, Laurel (Chloe Sevigny) and her husband Lee (Johnny Lee Miller) try to set up a desperate, suicidal, and alcoholic Melinda (Radha Mitchell) with a man. This also happens in the comedy, but things go horribly arry. I loved how the plots reflected each other in most ways, that is except for the tragedy and comedy. I also liked how likeable Melinda was even though she is in fact a suicidal drug addict.  Will Ferrell is another story here. He is obviously channelling Woody Allen, and he does a great job. Walter (Steve Carrell) is Hobie's (Will Ferrell's) friend, and he actually pulls off a little pitifullness in his portrayl of a compulsive gambler. In many of his movies, Ferrell is made out to be a goofy, kooky kind of guy with no sense of right or wrong, but here he is given a real attitude and feeling that makes him seem all the more real.The plot(s) of the movie, are, like I stated before, intricate and quite interesting. Mostof the people reading this may be put off by the fact that the film has almost no action, and is really talky. I, for one, loved this. I don't need 15 car wrecks to enjoy a movie. The comedic plot involves Hobie, a failed actor, and his wife, Susan (Amanda Peet), a director looking for $2 million dollars to produce a film, and their lives being changed by Melinda. Hobie develops a crush on her, and Susan tries to set her up with a rich dentist named Greg (played by Josh Brolin, who oddly resembles Thomas Haden Church). They slip in and out of one anothers lives, eating out and going to parties. They help each other out, like removing ticks from each other, and they all entertain each other with stories and long nights of just talking. The drama story involves Lee and Laurel as a married couple whose marriage is detiriorating slowly. Lee is a part time stage actor, full time pretensious prick. Laurel is a music teacher who is only teaching when she is not shopping and lunching. Laurel knows Melinda from college, and her and her friend Cassie (Arija Bareikis) try to set her up with Ellis ( Chiwetel Ejiofor), a piano composer. The Melinda in this story is sad and depressed, as the other is light and flighty. Melinda in the drama has kids that were taken away from her, and Peter (Zak Orth), Cassie's husband, is the lawyer trying to get them back. Melinda has many woes, and I won't mention alot of them soo that you can be suprised.One of the details in this movie (and there are many) is that Melinda's hair is curly in the drama and straight in the comedy. The curly hair, I believe, represents the frenetic pace of her life, as the straight hair represents the straight line life she leads. I preferred the  comedy plot, as it was not left as open ended or depressing and it was much lighter. I also liked the fact that nothing really works out for the tougher to like characters. Of course, the plot is based on two playwrites (Larry Pine and Wallace Shawn) discussing what comedy is, as what is tragedy, and what life really is. Do we laugh to mask our sadness, or do we cry to make ourselves seem more sympathetic? Do we laugh because we want to, or do we cry because we want to? Sound confusing? It really isn't. ""Melinda And Melinda"" is a truly great movie, the first good movie of 2005 (""Sideways"" was 2004). It was not what I thought it would be, which is a movie that masks its lack of plot with sad/funny elements. Better than Woody Allen's last two films (""Anything Else"" and ""Hollywood Ending""). This is infact, one of Woody Allen's best films.Rating: PG-13Sex/Nudity: 9Several marital and extramarittal sexual situations that range from non-graphic to fairly noisy and mildly graphic, but not with any nudity. We see a naked couple in bed, they are not married to each other (one is married to another man), but we only see their shoulders and his bare chest. A woman talks about how her fiance cheated on her with her friend, and a man has an erotic dream about another woman. A man professes his love for a woman. People talk about sex deprevation and addiction. A woman references a movie she directed called ""The Castration Sanadas"". Another woman talks about having two children out of wedlock. A man talks about ""getting some of her"".Profanity: 81 f-word variation, 1 mild obscenity, 5 sexual references, 45 references to drug addiction, 3 references to alcoholism, 1 mild racial obscenity.Violence/Gore: 6Two suicide attempts, one very intense and it is left unclear whether she will try again or not (she is pulled away from the ledge). Another is doen for comic relief, and there is a struggle in which someone gets a glass broken over his head (the woman does not commit suicide). There is a lengthy monalogue about how a woman killed her cheating husband. She describes the trial, and how easy it was to buy the gun and load it. She describes how she shot him, when, and where. There is a brief mention of how much blood there was, and how her children were taken away as a result. A man jumps on a trampoline near a pool and ledge. Animal heads adorn a houses interior, and a man asks (jokingly) how many shots it took to kill the animal.",5,"Two Stories, One Great Actress, And Three Great Plots",1112486400,"04 3,

By the mid 70's, it was quite common - and Woody Allen produced some wonderful ""tragic comedies"" (especially ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" - undoubtedly Woody Allen's best work, and one of my all time favorite movies).  Melinda and Melinda asks this question: is life itself tragic or comic?The concept is simple - two successful playwrights are arguing this exact question.  One of them writes tragedies, and says that life itself is tragic, and the other writes comedies (and of course, is of the opinion that life is comic).  When presented with a scenario of a young woman (Melinda) who comes into the lives of a struggling New York couple, each of the playwrights has their own tragic/comic take on the story.As the movie unfolds, it interweaves both the tragic and the comic versions of the story.  Although a little confusing at times, the execution is wonderful and thoroughly engaging.The casting is excellent, with Wallace Shawn as the ""Comic"" playwright.  Will Ferrell does a credible job - I wouldn't have ever thought of him in a Woody Allen movie (and for some strange reason he reminded me of a young Chevy Chase).Overall, an excellent movie that really brought me back to the early Woody Allen days, when he spent more time exploring interesting concepts such as this.",5,Perfect execution of an intriguing concept,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,1362,"['Up', '60', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'mixed', 'tragic', 'comic', 'themes', 'mid', '70', 'was', 'quite', 'common', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'tragic', 'comedies', 'especially', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'undoubtedly', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'work', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'question', 'life', 'tragic', 'comic', 'concept', 'simple', 'two', 'successful', 'playwrights', 'are', 'arguing', 'exact', 'question', 'One', 'tragedies', 'life', 'tragic', 'other', 'writes', 'comedies', 'course', 'opinion', 'life', 'comic', 'When', 'presented', 'scenario', 'young', 'woman', 'Melinda', 'who', 'lives', 'struggling', 'New', 'York', 'couple', 'playwrights', 'own', 'tragic/comic', 'take', 'story.As', 'movie', 'tragic', 'comic', 'versions', 'story', 'little', 'confusing', 'times', 'execution', 'wonderful', 'thoroughly', 'engaging.The', 'casting', 'excellent', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Comic', 'playwright', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'credible', 'job', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'strange', 'reason', 'reminded', 'young', 'Chevy', 'Chase', '.Overall', 'excellent', 'movie', 'really', 'brought', 'back', 'early', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'days', 'when', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'exploring', 'interesting', 'concepts', 'such']",N/A

928601,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000AM6P2U,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","Woody Allen's recent series of misfires has not been for lack of trying, as he remains one of our most informed filmmakers when it comes to the delicacy and foibles of human interactions. This 2005 feature is perhaps his most ultimate conceit, as it starts with four long-winded friends having dinner at the trendy Pastis in New York. Two are playwrights, one a sober-minded dramatist and the other a romantic comedy writer, the latter played fittingly by Wallace Shawn in a mini-throwback to Andre Gregory's ""My Dinner with Andre"". One of the diners tells a story about a distraught woman named Melinda, who shows up unexpectedly at his home, at which point the two writers take dramatic license and tell their versions of the same premise in their individual ways.In the tragic version, a disheveled, obviously troubled Melinda is a self-obsessed alcoholic whose intrusiveness works like a battering ram on her hosts, a married couple who appear to be already unraveling - Lee is a perpetually unsuccessful actor who coaches young, nubile students on the side, while his wife Laurel is a frustrated ""Park Avenue princess"" whose passion for music is smothered by her bouts of shopping. The comic version is typical Woody with Melinda now the desirable downstairs neighbor who drops by unexpectedly to meet another married couple coming unglued - Hobie is another failed New York actor, and his wife Susan is a young independent filmmaker kowtowing to a potential financial backer for her next film.Casting is pretty critical in realizing the two stories with enough contrast, and here Allen does well. He cast a dour Jonny Lee Miller as the psychologically abusive Lee and Chloe Sevigny as the not-so-innocent Laurel in the drama. Both serve the purpose of the piece proficiently but are saddled with over-literary lines that seem more indicative of a Chekhov play than real life. Allen has more luck with his comedy couple with an ideally cast Will Ferrell doing a spot-on Woody impersonation as Hobie (and a far more convincing failed actor here than in Nora Ephron's miserable ""Bewitched"") and Amanda Peet effectively controlling as the overly distracted Susan. Also worth mentioning is Chiwetel Ejiofor in the underdeveloped role of Ellis, a sweet-talking musician who switches between women very quickly in the drama and probably the first major black character in an Allen film.Holding the two stories together with uncommon dexterity is Radha Mitchell who plays Melinda not as an example of contrasts but in shades of nuance that show how comedy and drama are not so far removed from each other. In both stories, Melinda just seems to let life happen to her, and it is in her character's idiosyncratic responses that Mitchell defines her two performances. It's impressive work from a relative unknown. Everything else about the film reflects Allen's typical style - the strong pervasive use of music as a dramatic counterpoint (Stravinsky and Bart&oacute;k for the drama, Ellington for the comedy), impeccably tailored set designs by Santo Loquasto, and earth-toned cinematography by the estimable Vilmos ZsigmondAllen alternates between the two stories fluidly, with occasional shifts back to the restaurant, but part of the film's basic problem is visual, as he chooses the same upper class Manhattan milieu for both, making the stories hard to distinguish at times. Ultimately, the film does not resonate as much as it could when one realizes that these characters are merely spontaneous creations around a dining table. If Allen is trying to convey that comedy and tragedy are not mutually exclusive, he overcompensates by making the resolution of each story so pronounced and ultimately contrived.

It's rare that any of his films earn less than a perfect score from me, and maybe Melinda and Melinda will grow on me more in future viewings.  But at this point, although it has lots of positive qualities, it's a good example of why originality and unique artistic ideas do not equal a superb work.  Aesthetic quality is something else, in my view, far more related to excellence of execution, detectable passion about the work/about what the artist(s) want to express and resonance than it is to originality or uniqueness.  Melinda and Melinda is difficult viewing (in a phrase borrowed from one more common in music criticism) and never seems to flow quite right.  So as interesting as it is structurally, and as good as it is in some scenes, I can't give it a higher score.Melinda and Melinda interweaves essentially the same story told two different ways--as a tragedy and as a comedy.  The story is about an unexpected woman, named Melinda, entering and bringing major changes to the lives of a group of artists (actors, directors, musicians, etc.).  On a charitable view, Allen began the film having in mind the philosophical idea that there's not much difference, or at least there's a lot of overlap, between tragedy and comedy.On a less charitable view, he was conflicted over whether he should make another challenging ""serious"" film, ala Interiors (1978), September (1987), or Another Woman (1988), or do another comedy, so he decided to not really decide, and made the best of it.  Allen first wanted to do a more serious film with Annie Hall (1977), so beginning with that work, a lot of his comedies had far more serious material incorporated into them than in his earlier work.  I mention this because Melinda and Melinda's comedy sections are in this more serious comedy style--basically a serious film with Allen's voice as a comic heckling the proceedings through various characters--so that the comedy sections often resemble tragedy, but the tragedy sections rarely resemble comedy.That may be part of what affects the flow of the film.  It's not really tragedy alternated with comedy, or tragedy with comedy necessarily poking through alternated with comedy with tragedy necessarily poking through.  It's 80-something percent tragedy--tragedy alternated with tragedy with a bit of comedy poking through.Melinda and Melinda is most intriguing on its structural level, in terms of the interweaved retelling of the story.  Characters in each telling are often paralleled, but the relationships are not quite the same, and most interestingly, Allen seems to use many formal techniques of musical composition--characters, relationships and events are often transposed, inverted, displaced, reharmonized, and so on.Some of the performances are excellent, particularly Radha Mitchell as Melinda, who often seems like two different people, as she should, in each version of the story.  On the other hand, the tragedy sections sometimes feel a bit laborious, and that's partially because of the performances.  I don't get a lot of passion from the film overall.  Both the actors and Allen sometimes feel like they're going through the motions.I'm a fan of Will Ferrell's work, and he's good here, but I wish that Allen had let him become unleashed more often--and it would have helped the comedy of the comedy sections, although the comedy of the tragedy sections needed more help.But Allen seems to be telling us not so much that he's learned to see comedy in tragedy, but the opposite.  While that may very well be true, I'm not sure how resonant that will be for the audience.  It doesn't resonate well with me.  It may instead serve to alienate much of the audience, and while I can understand not caring about that as an artist--I'm sure there are alienating aspects to my work at times, too--the artist has to understand that it might not help the work be a success in the eyes of the audience.",3,Tragedy and Tragedy and comedy,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,3951,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'work', 'rare', 'films', 'earn', 'less', 'perfect', 'score', 'maybe', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'will', 'grow', 'more', 'future', 'viewings', 'point', 'lots', 'positive', 'qualities', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'originality', 'unique', 'artistic', 'ideas', 'do', 'not', 'equal', 'superb', 'work', 'Aesthetic', 'quality', 'something', 'else', 'view', 'far', 'more', 'related', 'excellence', 'execution', 'detectable', 'passion', 'work/about', 'what', 'artist', 'want', 'express', 'resonance', 'originality', 'uniqueness', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'difficult', 'viewing', 'phrase', 'borrowed', 'one', 'more', 'common', 'music', 'criticism', 'never', 'flow', 'quite', 'right', 'So', 'as', 'interesting', 'structurally', 'as', 'good', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'higher', 'score.Melinda', 'Melinda', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'different', 'ways', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'story', 'unexpected', 'woman', 'named', 'Melinda', 'entering', 'bringing', 'major', 'changes', 'lives', 'group', 'artists', 'actors', 'directors', 'musicians', 'etc.', 'charitable', 'view', 'Allen', 'began', 'film', 'having', 'mind', 'philosophical', 'idea', 'not', 'much', 'difference', 'least', 'lot', 'overlap', 'tragedy', 'comedy.On', 'less', 'charitable', 'view', 'was', 'conflicted', 'should', 'make', 'challenging', 'serious', 'film', 'ala', 'Interiors', '1978', 'September', '1987', 'Woman', '1988', 'do', 'comedy', 'decided', 'not', 'really', 'decide', 'made', 'best', 'Allen', 'first', 'wanted', 'do', 'more', 'serious', 'film', 'Annie', 'Hall', '1977', 'so', 'beginning', 'work', 'lot', 'comedies', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'material', 'incorporated', 'earlier', 'work', 'mention', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'comedy', 'sections', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'comedy', 'style', 'basically', 'serious', 'film', 'Allen', 'voice', 'comic', 'heckling', 'proceedings', 'various', 'characters', 'so', 'comedy', 'sections', 'often', 'resemble', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'sections', 'rarely', 'resemble', 'comedy.That', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'what', 'flow', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'tragedy', 'alternated', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'necessarily', 'poking', 'alternated', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'necessarily', 'poking', '80-something', 'percent', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'alternated', 'tragedy', 'bit', 'comedy', 'poking', 'through.Melinda', 'Melinda', 'most', 'intriguing', 'structural', 'level', 'terms', 'interweaved', 'retelling', 'story', 'Characters', 'telling', 'are', 'often', 'paralleled', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'most', 'interestingly', 'Allen', 'use', 'many', 'formal', 'techniques', 'musical', 'composition', 'characters', 'relationships', 'events', 'are', 'often', 'transposed', 'inverted', 'displaced', 'reharmonized', 'so', 'on.Some', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Melinda', 'who', 'often', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'should', 'version', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'tragedy', 'sections', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'bit', 'laborious', 'partially', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'passion', 'film', 'overall', 'actors', 'Allen', 'sometimes', 'feel', ""'re"", 'going', 'motions.I', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'work', 'good', 'here', 'wish', 'Allen', 'had', 'let', 'become', 'unleashed', 'more', 'often', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'sections', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'sections', 'needed', 'more', 'help.But', 'Allen', 'be', 'telling', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'learned', 'see', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'opposite', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'true', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'resonant', 'will', 'be', 'audience', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'well', 'may', 'instead', 'serve', 'alienate', 'much', 'audience', 'can', 'understand', 'not', 'caring', 'about', 'artist', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'alienating', 'aspects', 'work', 'times', 'too', 'artist', 'understand', 'might', 'not', 'help', 'work', 'be', 'success', 'eyes', 'audience']",N/A

L'hoir,"[0, 0]","Or Woody vs. Woody?The Either/Or Proposition, in which there is no middle ground, is usually considered a fallacy, but Woody Allen, like many major political figures, is a lightening rod of controversy, as many of the reviews here indicate: one either loves him or hates him. There is very little in-between!I count myself in the former group, but I can certainly understand those who count themselves in the latter. Woody Allen, who--with the aid of his brilliant casting director, Juliet Taylor--has assembled his usual ensemble cast of talented actors, makes films according to his own criteria, rather than according to that of some Hollywood focus group. Consequently, his films occupy a category of their own. As an author-director, Woody Allen has travelled well beyond the point of worrying whether his movies appeal to the public or not.""Melinda and Melinda,"" which explores the nature of tragedy and comedy, is probably too intellectual for its own good (It would not be out of place in a university course--not only drama and film, but also philosophy and classics). The film is bursting with talent--including the two Melindas, British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (whose American accent is impeccable), and Will Farrell, who delivers canonic Woody-isms with aplomb. The cinematography of New York conveys an undeniably nostalgic and even a melancholy charm.Although I liked the premise of tragedy and comedy converging in life (depending on one's point of view), I found the film's structure to be problematic; repeatedly asking myself, ""Now which Melinda is this? What is her story? Who are all these other characters?"" In other words, at times the boundaries of narrative became so blurred that I had difficulty distinguishing the individual facets of the two plots. I do, however, look forward to watching this well-acted film several times, but I certainly empathise with viewers who have neither the time nor the patience to do so.Woody Allen brings to mind a delightful old saying told to me by a German friend: ""Does the Moon notice when the little dogs bark?"" Woody Allen is clearly the Moon, and we, his critics, are the little dogs. Whether we bark or not, he will continue to make films according to his own standards.

928608,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AM6P2U,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","Woody Allen's finest film that dealt with the potency of interpersonal relationships in a purely serious mode was the magnificent 'Interiors', a film that remains one of the most visually beautiful and hauntingly touching films of the past. In MELINDA & MELINDA he seems to be looking at his life in films from a high vantage that has revealed to him just how closely related comedy and tragedy are, how the lives we live and the stories we tell depend a great deal on personal perception drawing on our individual past experiences that bring us to the unique human we each become.  This seems to be the point of the bifurcated stories presented here by a fine cast in a very successful format.The opening, intervening, and closing scenes in a cafe where four people debate over drinks the differences between comedy and tragedy (two are writers specializing in one of the two forms of drama) set a marvelous 'Greek chorus' effect for the film.  The same story, essentially, is adapted by each of the two writers who share how they see the development of the accidental entry of a strange woman into the lives of two different couples/environments.  And it is this parallel of thought lines that propels this film.  There are some constants: the strange woman Melinda (brilliant Australian actress Rhada Mitchell) plays both forms of the character, the basic incidents of marital dysfunction, extramarital affairs, racially mixed couples, the 'woman on the edge' persona that pervades all of Allen's films, etc are the ideas that, while core, alter in each tale.  The two stories are closely interwoven so that acute attention from audience concentration is demanded.Rhada Mitchell gives a bravura performance as the two Melindas, and she is surrounded by some very fine actors as the various couples and lovers:  Chlo Sevigny, Jonny Lee Miller, Brooke Smith, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Sunjata, among others.  There are fans out there of Will Ferrell who probably would include his performance, but for this reviewer he is an awkward actor who vacillates between his own persona and that of Woody Allen here.Allen's script and direction are uniquely Woody Allen and in this film that combo succeeds.  There are some holes in the script and some dallying on certain moments that grow tiresome, but the ideas are smart and the concept rings true.  Recommended.

The conversation cuts in throughout the film, serving as narration to the stories of Melinda, a rather non-descript, insubstancial person who drags the film terribly whenever she has a story to tell. The cast is almost uniformly insecure in their roles. In contrast, the film ignites, for only a moment, as one of the storytellers; a lovely brunette who had the same sort of role in Allen's ""Hollywood Ending"", simply 'takes the stage' as she compares the concepts of comedy and tragedy. Why not more of her, or more of that? I can't help but think of the first Woody Allen film I ever saw. As kids we used to camp out in tents in each other's yards in the summer, stay up late and watch black and white late night TV.

928610,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B000AM6P2U,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[3, 5]","Woody Allen once more opens the Pandora 's box to carve in relief an old but passionate issue on the red carpet: tragedy and comedy. What role do they perform throughout all our existence?.Allen places four characters around a table in the middle of Manhattan: kind spirits discuss friendly about their points of view about the tragedy and comedy, exhibiting each one their arguments. From this perspective (who reminds the famous film Louis Malle ' s Dinner with Andre), Allen bets for to put in action an admirable proposal: to present two different ways around an imaginary dilemma seen with tragic and comedy glasses. Both stories will unfold in parallel, exchanging roles, attitudes and characters but always turning around Melinda as principal dramatic axis. We have always known about Allen' s  prodigious musical culture: and the proposed examples were simply fantastic: Bartok ' s  Third Quartet and the mention of Mahler' s Second. Both works typify essentially the anguish of the modern man.The comedy, obviously is starred by Allen in the accustomed role we have always seen him from Play it again, Sam (under the direction of Martin Ritt) and repeated over and over in many other conveyances. Allen: the understood looser, who seeks desperately the muse of his most desired dream: An Aphrodite woman but with the brain, spirit and will of Athena (The Wisdom, Arts and Prudence Goddess). Nevertheless, when such kind of woman  appears in the affective universe of Woody, the attraction is not always mutual. So this brief instant of immortality with the cosmos exploits before him as soup' s pomp. In last instance, it doesn't seem arguable he was the kind of man sought by this idealized femme. As you know, Allen had suggested and even bet his previous concern in Mighty Aphrodite (1995) with the expected results that we know. He makes an admirable script around the comic perspective of the life, placing Melinda not precisely as a centered woman but perhaps thinking of her as Don Quixote and his beloved  Dulcinea del Toboso. In fact, maybe I' m wrong but I guess this was the hidden Ace of Allen: to render a tangential but deserved homage to this famous artwork precisely in this year in which we are celebrating the 400th anniversary of its publishing.On the other hand, the tragic vision of Melinda would seem to give us the impression Woody reflects in the feminine character his mirror image. All her tribulations and disagreements suggest us a profound sense of hopeless and disillusion respect all the men she engages, searching certain virtues but being attracted by others than apparently weigh much more in the emotional balance. Melinda 's  existential depression has been portrayed in previous feminine characters such Annie Hall, Alice, Broadway Danny Rose or Manhattan around Diane Keaton ' s role. Allen walks to the opposite side of the sex and places also, the immense burden of disaffection and ontological loneliness in tragic mood.

However, when he was in his serious role, he was as good as anyone else.  And as usual, everyone else was great.  Allen or his casting director has a way of getting the absolute best out of all his actors.  Enough has been said about this plot.  So I won't say it too.  Only it's better than just that.  And why doesn't anyone but the ""Rolling Stone"" review Woody Allen movies?  Their line that, ""You'll laugh till it hurts"" was absurd.  There was hardly a chuckle in the whole thing, stem to stern.  According to the Greeks, a comedy is a play that ends happily.  That was about as funny as the comic version of this story got.  But it was enough.  I preferred the tragic version because the guy who impersonated Woody Allen was so bad, he ruined the whole thing.  Why would Melinda (or his wife or anyone else) have fallen in love with him?  I wouldn't have.  There was a let down in this flick.  And that was the paucity of jokes (guess who had them all) in the comic version.  Particularly after the build-up in the prologue.  It ended snappy, but the epilogue was also embarrassing considering the lack of wit in the comic version they touted.  Now then.  If this movie had been made 30 years ago, and Woody Allen had played the Woody Allen character, it would have been a wonderful movie, both the tragic and the comic versions.  I could of course see where the jokes were supposed to be. And there were lots of them.  But they needed Woody Allen (or sigh in his younger days one of his regulars, usually female) to put them across.  In spite of all this caviling, I'm still glad I watched it, and I thought the tragic version (which I've said virtually nothing about) was sad and deep and wonderful.  The humor would have been deep too if someone else had played the husband in the comic version.  Oh.  I haven't read the reviews, so maybe everyone says this, but don't be misled into thinking (as I did before I watched it) that this is 2 separate flicks back to back.  It isn't.

Woody Allen is one of the last genuis directors we have.  Everyone uses a seperate standard to judge his films.  If this film were made by anyone else, then everyone would rave about it.  This is the best film you will see this year, if you like artistic films.  But some people feel this is ""not up to Woody's standards.""  More about that later.The film is, in its concept, more daring than 99% of the crap you will see this year, last year, or next year.  Is the world comic or tragic, the film asks (in a world where films usually ask: how many explosions can I create).Woody then gives us an interesting comic tale, and an interesting tragic tale, both well shot, well directed, and well acted.  Let me repeat: both of these are IN THE SAME FILM!  Woody constantly re-invents himself in an intelligent way.The comic tale is indeed FUNNY, and intellectually so.  Will Ferrell is perfect and perfectually directed to play his role, and we are not given the easy, expected storyline, but one that keeps us paying attention.  In the tragic role I challenge reviewers to find a more emotional scene than the final one of Melinda's breakdown.Antything Else was wonderful: a film with teen stars Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci in which the director gets an artistic performance out of both, a film in which intelligent TALKING, not car chases and fart scenes, dominate.  But Melinda and Melinda is willing to be a pure concept film, but one in which each story is told with loving care and attention to the details of each characters humanity, capturing the magic of Woody's past films like Manhattan, Annie Hall, or Deconstructing Harry.

Radha Mitchell plays two parts, or maybe it would be more accurate to say she plays one part with two different hairdos, a modified Reese Witherspoon bob for the comedy scenes, and a depraved Glenn Close tease for the scenes in which her character falls into an alcoholic Butterfield 8 meltdown.  A group of New York intellectuals, led by insufferable Wallace Shawn, construct her destiny out of a heap of movie cliches, including an Arabian type lamp she can rub to get a wish with.  This frame story is pretty reprehensible, but so is any movie insofar as it contains a Wally Shawn quotient.  A movie with him in it is by definition, a bad movie dressed up as high class to appeal to middlebrow arrivistes.Otherwise the acting is good, even when the script forces the actors to spout speeches a first year playwrighting student would red pencil, tons of exposition, particularly poor Chloe Sevigny, and tons of ""thematic"" dialogue designed to set up groans throughout the house, many of which stem from Chiwetel Ejiofor's hokey speeches about how life is so short, we have to live it for today.  Wasn't this the movie that Winona Ryder was set to play Radha Mitchell's part, while Robert Downey had the Jonny Lee Miller part?  And both of them were facing personal crises which prevented them from making this movie?  I don't even want to think about it.At this point I'd rather see Will Ferrell impersonating Woody Allen than I would seeing the real Woody playing himself.  Ferrell's good here, even in thankless scenes like the one where he runs up to Melinda's apartment to spy on her, and accidentally gets a corner of his bathrobe caught in her thrice-bolted door, and fearing discovery, has to run down the stairs in his boxers, past a scandalized neighbor.  Josh Brolin is great as always, spoofing his own image as a sensitive ladies' man, in a giant Hamptons summerhouse decorated, like Roger Livesay's townhouse in THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP, with animal heads, souvenirs of safaris.

928617,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B000AM6P2U,L.A. Scene,"[7, 8]","After watching ""Melinda and Melinda"", I discovered that this was a Woody Allen film.  I've just never been a fan of Woody Allen and have always found him overrated as a screenwriter and filmmaker.  However, after watching ""Melinda and Melinda"", I admit I was pleasantly surprised how good a movie this was.  In fact, I was also surprised why this movie didn't do well at the box office.  With Hollywood being focused on remakes, the concept of this movie is definitely something that is ""out of the box"" .  I was entertained throughout the movie.  It also features an unsung performance by Will Ferrell.""Melinda and Melinda"" actually has two parallel stories taking place around a character named ""Melinda"".  The movie starts off with two filmmakers conversing with a group of people over dinner.  One filmmaker makes comedies and the other focuses on the tragedy - and the two engage in a debate over why one is better than the other.  During the dinner gathering one proposes a story where a distressed woman shows up at the door crashing the dinner party - that woman being Melinda.  From that premise, we see the parallel stories develop as told from the two filmmakers - one from the comedic end and one from the tragic end.  Melinda, who is played by Radha Mitchell in both storylines is the central character in each of the storylines.  While Mitchell does play Melinda in each story, the character of Melinda are really two different people - with two different personalities.  At the same time, while these are two separate storylines, there are a lot of parallels between the two storylines.  For example:* Each Melinda crashes a dinner party in a distraught mood* Each Melinda is returning from the Midwest* Each Melinda will be rebounded from a broken marriage that involved  infidelity* Each Melinda wrecks havoc on a married couple* Each Melinda will be fixed up on dates, who are both dentists - and each will end up going up with different menMitchell's character of Melinda will appear in both of the storylines, but none of the other characters will appear in both.  In the tragic version, the married couple that Melinda will wreck havoc will be Lee and Laurel (played by Jonny Lee Miller and ""Big Love""'s Chloe Sevigny).  In the comedic version, the married couple is Susan and Hobie (played by Amanda Peet and Will Ferrell).  The two storylines could have easily been made into individual movies - and while both versions of the story are highly entertaining, I found myself more interested in the comedic version.  The comedic version took on much more of the form of a romantic comedy as opposed to a classic comedy.  A lot of why the comedic version worked was because of the performances by Peet and Ferrell.  Peet seemed born to play the career-driven Susan - and was very believable in the role.  However it is Will Ferrell that really shines as Hobie, the laid-back unlucky husband of Susan.  Ferrell has really emerged as one of the top Hollywood actors with audiences accustomed to his ""big name"" movies he has starred in (many are most familiar with his classic role of ""Frank the Tank"" in ""Old School"").  At the same time, Ferrell proves he can do the ""artsy"" film.  The amazing thing is while Melinda was the central character of the film, I found myself gravitating to Hobie's character throughout the comedic storyline.  By the end of the film, I felt that Hobie emerged as the hero of the storyline - and of the whole film.The tragic story isn't bad either, but it just didn't stand out compared to the comedy.  Miller and Sevigny's portrayal of Lee and Laurel were good, but didn't really standout to the characters of Peet and Ferrell.  At times I felt the tragic story was dragging on compared to the comedic story.  This is seen in the tragic story when Melinda and Laurel's friend pregnant friend Cassie (played by Brooke Smith) throws a dinner party to fix up Melinda with a dentist - it was just very slow.  I found the elements of the tragic storyline more difficult to follow.  I also found the ending of the tragic storyline unsatisfactory.  There were more loose-ends that could have been pulled in that storyline (i.e. such as Cassie being pregnant) that were just never explored.  Still this wasn't a bad story - it was just one that could have shined, but didn't.Another thing that one must be careful of is ""coming in during the middle of the film"".  The viewer will definitely be confused if they don't understand the premise of the film as both stories switch back and forth.With Radha Mitchell playing both Melindas, she has to be given credit for such a performance.  She does an excellent job in both movies - and does a great job at coming across as two different Melindas. Like Ferrell,  I'm surprised Mitchell's performance didn't get more attention - as it was a good one.  Wallace Shawn is very believable as the comedic filmmaker.The setting for both storylines (as well as where the filmmakers debating tragedy and comedy) is New York City.  This seemed to be the perfect setting for the entire film.  Most of the characters are definitely yuppie-like characters and New York City seems to be the perfect backdrop for this movie.Despite some of the weaknesses of the tragic storyline, overall this is still a very good film.  I have to give Woody Allen credit for keeping the storylines flowing and knowing when to switch back and forth between the storylines.  This is definitely a movie that shouldn't have flopped at the box office and is something worth checking out.",4,Tale of Two Stories - One is Better than the Other,1154217600,"07 30,

928618,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AM6P2U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" begins with a couple of playwrights sitting in a Manhattan restaurant arguing out whether the world is essentially tragic or comic.  Max (Larry Pine) sees it as tragedy and Sy (Wallace Shawn) insists it is a comedy.  To argue out the case they take the story of a woman named Melinda (Radha Mitchell) who shows up on the doorstep of her friends and Max tells a tragic tale while Sy makes it a comedy.  Melinda becomes the only familiar face in each version and we understand that when we see Laurel (Chloe Sevigny) and Lee (Jonny Lee Miller) we are in Max's story and when we switch to Hobie (Will Ferrell in what we would instantly recognize as the Woody Allen role at which he is much better than Kenneth Branagh) and Susan (Amanda Peet) we are back to Sy's story.The couples end up being bigger factors in why the stories are so different more so than Melinda.  Laurel has money but not happiness and a husband who is an alcoholic actor who has trouble landing a job.  Susan is an independent filmmaker and her husband is an actor who has trouble landing a job because he wants to play every character from Lear on down with limp.  Besides Melinda the other common factor is that her arrival leads to adultery, although in neither case would you say it is a direct result of her presence.Be forewarned that this is one of those movies that you can better appreciate the second or third time you see it.  I had a hard time getting into ""Melinda and Melinda"" because as soon as I heard the premise I thought I knew what the movie would be about and I was wrong.  Even with the different casts for each version I thought they would be playing the same characters and that the basic story would stay the same but one would take a sharp turn towards tragedy and the other would go in the opposite direction.  This was not the case.  The differences between the two tones are shaded in gray at best and as the two stories diverged it took me a while to wrap my mind around what Allen was really up to this time around.Even when you are on board with the idea it is still difficult to keep up because if you stop to remember these stories are being told by two guys making them up as they go along.  There are some holes and those are not just indicative of Allen's failure to connect the dots but a clue that he is talking about more than whether the world is best defined by comedy or tragedy.  We already knew Allen's position on that before we started watching this 2005 film, which probably explains why one part plays better than the other.  ""Melinda and Melinda"" is one of Allen's most ambitious films in years, but the execution is either way off or the Woodman is really on a completely different wavelength at this point in his filmmaking career.  But I round up because the second time because I an inclined to give Allen the benefit of the doubt and because the second time through I started to unpack more of the meaning.",4,An intriguing idea but Allen gets a bit too subtle with the execution,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2966,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'couple', 'playwrights', 'sitting', 'Manhattan', 'restaurant', 'arguing', 'out', 'world', 'essentially', 'tragic', 'comic', 'Max', 'Larry', 'Pine', 'tragedy', 'Sy', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'comedy', 'argue', 'out', 'case', 'take', 'story', 'woman', 'named', 'Melinda', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'up', 'doorstep', 'friends', 'Max', 'tragic', 'tale', 'Sy', 'comedy', 'Melinda', 'only', 'familiar', 'face', 'version', 'understand', 'when', 'see', 'Laurel', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Lee', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'are', 'Max', 'story', 'when', 'switch', 'Hobie', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'what', 'would', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'role', 'much', 'better', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Susan', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'are', 'back', 'Sy', 'story.The', 'couples', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'bigger', 'factors', 'why', 'stories', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'more', 'so', 'Melinda', 'Laurel', 'money', 'not', 'happiness', 'husband', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'actor', 'who', 'trouble', 'landing', 'job', 'Susan', 'independent', 'filmmaker', 'husband', 'actor', 'who', 'trouble', 'landing', 'job', 'play', 'character', 'Lear', 'down', 'limp', 'Melinda', 'other', 'common', 'factor', 'arrival', 'leads', 'adultery', 'case', 'would', 'say', 'direct', 'result', 'presence.Be', 'forewarned', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'see', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'as', 'soon', 'heard', 'premise', 'thought', 'knew', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'wrong', 'Even', 'different', 'casts', 'version', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'characters', 'basic', 'story', 'would', 'stay', 'same', 'one', 'would', 'take', 'sharp', 'turn', 'towards', 'tragedy', 'other', 'would', 'go', 'opposite', 'direction', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'differences', 'two', 'tones', 'are', 'shaded', 'gray', 'best', 'two', 'stories', 'diverged', 'took', 'while', 'wrap', 'mind', 'what', 'Allen', 'was', 'really', 'up', 'time', 'around.Even', 'when', 'are', 'board', 'idea', 'still', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'stop', 'remember', 'stories', 'are', 'being', 'told', 'two', 'guys', 'making', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'are', 'holes', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'indicative', 'Allen', 'failure', 'connect', 'dots', 'clue', 'talking', 'more', 'world', 'best', 'defined', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'already', 'knew', 'Allen', 'position', 'started', 'watching', '2005', 'film', 'probably', 'why', 'one', 'part', 'better', 'other', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'one', 'Allen', 'most', 'ambitious', 'films', 'years', 'execution', 'way', 'Woodman', 'really', 'completely', 'different', 'wavelength', 'point', 'filmmaking', 'career', 'round', 'up', 'second', 'time', 'inclined', 'give', 'Allen', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'second', 'time', 'started', 'unpack', 'more', 'meaning']",N/A

The writing was so poor that almost all of the characters did lines that Woody would typically do.  I suggest that the movie would have been funnier if Woody himself had played all the parts, male and female.  It would have fit their lines.  I might have liked that movie, but I didn't like this one.This is by far the best work that Will Ferrell ever did.  That is because everything else he ever did was obscenely horrid, for which he deserves to be beaten severely, but in this movie he is simply nothing at all, and can be left alone.  He is the single worst actor in America today, ruining every so-called comedy and skit he appears in, because there isn't anything funny about him, but the absolute nothingness of his performance in this role really amazed me.  I didn't think he was capable of rising to these heights.Since Will Ferrell gave such a sterling performance, I can't give this movie a 1.  I think it deserves a 2.  I'm thinking that a rating of 2 1/2 means that a movie was just about worthy of the hour and change you spend watching it, so for this movie, I think Woody Allen owes us all about two dollars each for wasting our time.",2,"Pay up, Woody, you owe us",1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1333,"['was', 'obvious', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'was', 'playing', 'usual', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'found', 'thinking', 'EVERYBODY', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'usual', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'writing', 'was', 'so', 'poor', 'almost', 'characters', 'did', 'lines', 'Woody', 'would', 'typically', 'do', 'suggest', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'Woody', 'had', 'played', 'parts', 'male', 'female', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'lines', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one.This', 'far', 'best', 'work', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'ever', 'did', 'everything', 'else', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'obscenely', 'horrid', 'be', 'beaten', 'severely', 'movie', 'simply', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'single', 'worst', 'actor', 'America', 'today', 'ruining', 'so-called', 'comedy', 'skit', ""n't"", 'anything', 'funny', 'absolute', 'nothingness', 'performance', 'role', 'really', 'amazed', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'capable', 'rising', 'heights.Since', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'gave', 'sterling', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', '1', 'think', '2', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'rating', '2', '1/2', 'means', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'worthy', 'hour', 'change', 'spend', 'watching', 'so', 'movie', 'think', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'two', 'dollars', 'wasting', 'time']",N/A

On the one side, you have the Woody Allen purists that seem to believe that everything he creates is equally important and well made.  On the other hand, you have the critics that will state that it's a *nice idea* but could have been done better.  And yet the truth is somewhere in the middle.  Because while this idea is not unique to Woody Allen, the way he blends the movie's themes with his own unique writing and film-making style make this movie unique and worthwhile.  Like many Woody Allen movies, and perhaps like the man himself, it is not perfect and it does not try to be.  But it is a very good movie that has a lot to offer on many different levels.The Story and the ScriptFor starters, the basic premise of the movie has been overstated many times, yet I may have understood it in a different way.  It's true, this movie is about two separate versions of one woman's life.  Yet each version is the creation of a writer, and as such not a true representation of reality.  One writer sees life as a tragedy and the other sees life as a comic farce.  And yet in fusing the elements of each one sided view with normal story-telling elements, both writers prove that their version has plenty of the other side to it.The film alternates between the writers discussing their points of views and the two different stories without warning.  In some cases it's obvious that there has been a transition and in others it takes a few seconds to catch on.  Radha Mitchell plays Melinda in both stories. As the stories diverge we can see how more absurd plot elements are introduced by the writers to meet their own objectives.Most of the funny elements of this movie can probably be described as a mix of dark humor along with the double entendres that Woody Allen is famous for.The CastWill Ferrell surprises me most of all in his role as Hobie, an unemployed actor.  He shows once again that he can play both the buffoon and the straight man to perfection.  Radha Mitchell is also good in both roles, though the tragic role has her deliver some forced dialogue.  Chiwetel Ejiofor puts in a strong performance as the intellectual composer, and Chloe Sevigny delivers a standard high level performance as one of Melinda's best friends.  There are also many smaller roles filled by extremely good actors.  The list goes on and all in all the casting for this movie was superb.ConclusionOverall, this is a movie worth watching for writers, aspiring writers, actors and lovers of independent film.  If you are a huge fan of Woody Allen, it might not be what you are expecting.  But as long as you don't mind subtle story and plot development, you will enjoy the many layers this movie has to offer.Enjoy!",4,Melinda and Melinda - A Surprising Woody Allen Movie Without Woody Allen,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,2775,"['Melinda', 'Melindahas', 'elicited', 'full', 'range', 'reactions', 'fans', 'one', 'side', 'have', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'seem', 'believe', 'everything', 'equally', 'important', 'well', 'made', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'critics', 'will', 'state', '*nice', 'idea*', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'yet', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'idea', 'not', 'unique', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'way', 'movie', 'themes', 'own', 'unique', 'writing', 'film-making', 'style', 'make', 'movie', 'unique', 'worthwhile', 'many', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'man', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'lot', 'offer', 'many', 'different', 'levels.The', 'Story', 'ScriptFor', 'starters', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'been', 'overstated', 'many', 'times', 'yet', 'may', 'have', 'understood', 'different', 'way', 'true', 'movie', 'two', 'separate', 'versions', 'one', 'woman', 'life', 'version', 'creation', 'writer', 'such', 'not', 'true', 'representation', 'reality', 'One', 'writer', 'life', 'tragedy', 'other', 'sees', 'life', 'comic', 'farce', 'yet', 'fusing', 'elements', 'one', 'sided', 'view', 'normal', 'story-telling', 'elements', 'writers', 'prove', 'version', 'plenty', 'other', 'side', 'it.The', 'film', 'alternates', 'writers', 'discussing', 'points', 'views', 'two', 'different', 'stories', 'warning', 'cases', 'obvious', 'been', 'transition', 'others', 'few', 'seconds', 'catch', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Melinda', 'stories', 'stories', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'more', 'absurd', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'writers', 'meet', 'own', 'objectives.Most', 'funny', 'elements', 'movie', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'described', 'mix', 'dark', 'humor', 'double', 'entendres', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'famous', 'for.The', 'CastWill', 'Ferrell', 'most', 'role', 'Hobie', 'unemployed', 'actor', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'play', 'buffoon', 'straight', 'man', 'perfection', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'also', 'good', 'roles', 'tragic', 'role', 'deliver', 'forced', 'dialogue', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'strong', 'performance', 'intellectual', 'composer', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'standard', 'high', 'level', 'performance', 'one', 'Melinda', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'smaller', 'roles', 'filled', 'extremely', 'good', 'actors', 'list', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'superb.ConclusionOverall', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'writers', 'aspiring', 'writers', 'actors', 'lovers', 'independent', 'film', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'expecting', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtle', 'story', 'plot', 'development', 'will', 'enjoy', 'many', 'layers', 'movie', 'offer.Enjoy']",N/A

I have seen maybe half of Woody Allen's movies and he is truly a wonderful maker of movies.  This is among my favorites of his.This story, or rather, these two stories, the way it was done, seemed to me so unique.  It wasn't one story told two ways, it was several small facts woven quite differently two ways into two totally different stories.I loved that Melinda was played by the same actress but the other actors were different.At the end, although their stories were different, it was so clear to me that the tragic Melinda had made her life tragic herself, the choices she had made and continued to make proved her undoing and the happy Melinda had also had some bad things happen to her, and possibly made bad choices, but obviously had decided to make better choices.What a human being is compelled to do for whatever inner reason, who knows, and it's easy to criticize someone's choices in hindsight, to say that the tragic Melinda brought it all on herself, but she did.  She continued to do the same stupid things over and over.  The ""comic"" Melinda obviously decided to look at her own life differently.It's hard to explain it and do it justice.  You just have to see it.After watching this movie, immediately afterwards, I felt better about my own life.  The past year has been not one of my best, some due to my own stupidity and passions and some from outside things I have no control over and, overwhelmed, I have been rather blue, but this movie, watching it, for whatever reason, helped me turn a corner, a good corner.I recommend it as entertainment and as a mild but effective anti-depressant.

Can the same events give birth to a comedy or a tragedy, depending on the point of view? That is the central issue in this short but fairly original movie.I don't want to spoil things for you. Suffice it to say that ""Melinda and Melinda"" kicks off with a scene in a restaurant, where some friends are having dinner. Two of them are writers, but one is into comedies, while the other prefers to write tragedies. They start a discussion on the essence of life, something that leads one of their friends to propose a challenge: each writer must interpret some facts regarding the story of a young woman, Melinda, from his own unique perspective.Truth to be told, both writers manage to weave extremely good stories that mirror each other but are at the same time quite different. The spectator is able to compare the stories within the story, and to enjoy the excellent acting of a uniformly good cast.

It's a bit of a feud between the two, to discuss which is better..tragedy or comedy. We see one version of Melinda who is completely tragic. She is divorced, unstable, in complete hysterics. While, we see another Melinda who has well..seen her fairshare of unhappiness, but is quite optimistic and fun when it comes to life.I absolutely LOVED Radha Mitchell in this film, I thought she shined.

The 2 stories consist of Melinda, both played by the lovely Radha Mitchell (High Art, Pitch Black) who does a good job juggling two roles and shes fantastic in both of them. The tradgic story has Melinda moving in with her friend Chloe Sevigny (Kids, Party Monster) and her husband Jonny Lee Miller (Trainspotting, Dracula 2000) who does deodarant commericals and what not. Melinda's life is really crappy, so Sevigny tries to brighten her up with a date but Melinda ends up falling for Piano man, Ellis, played by the suave Chiwetel Ejiofor (Serenity, Dirty Pretty Things). On the comic end, Mitchell is Melinda, who interrupts the dinner party of unemplyed actor Hobie, played by Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Elf), who is hilarious here and is filling Allen's shoes here because who wants to watch Woody fiddle around with 20 year olds when hes like almost 60 or whatever? Hobie (Ferrell) is married to script supervisor Amanda Peet (Somethings Gotta Give, Whipped). When Hobie invites Melinda to the track with Hobie's friend, played by Steve Carell (40 Year Old Virgin, Anchorman) in a small role, Hobie falls madly in love with Melinda and even gets jealous even when she dates guys.

Two New York playwrights argue life's meaning over their restaurant dinner table. One believes life is essentially comic, while the other believes it is tragic. Their companion begins to tell them a story about a woman named Melinda, and each playwright interprets the story in his own way: as comedy or as tragedy. In both versions, Melinda's (Radha Mitchell) unexpected appearance on their doorstep disrupts the already disintegrating marriages of friends, while Melinda searches for a new man to love.""Melinda and Melinda"" could have been interesting. It's a great idea. The trouble is that the comic story of Melinda isn't funny, and the tragedy isn't moving. The fundamental difference between them is that Melinda is genuinely unstable and dysfunctional in the tragedy and simply impulsive in the comedy. This is kind of a cheat on writer/director Woody Allen's part, since it is more a comment on personalities than on the human condition. But it's the stories that make it fall flat. The narrative and characters are simplistic and completely fail to engage.

The central conceit of the film -- that the ""same"" story can be told quite differently from the point of view of tragedy and of comedy -- works as a clever reminder and allusion to films like Rashomon (in which the narration of events is shown to be inseparable from the values and perspectives of the narrator) but also as an intriguing reflection on Allen's own body of work that for some time was alternating between slapstick comedy and Bergmanesque drama.  His best films, like Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanors have alternated between a tragic core and a comic and usually hilarious undercurrent.  Here Woody Allen has opted for a separation between these, and told the whole story both ways at once.  As a thought experiment it is a very intriguing idea, and as a set of stories it is fairly effective though not quite as effective as some of his very best work.  One very nice touch was to have the theoretical discussions about tragedy and comedy that form the backdrop of his story take place at a dinner conversation, with Wallace Shawn as one of the central figures.  In this way, the discussions, which are only partially effective, can work as a modest parody (or homage?) of ""conversation"" films like ""My Dinner with Andre"" that starred Wallace Shawn.  Will Ferrell does a great reworking of the traditionally insecure and neurotic character that Woody Allen plays; and Radha Mitchell gives a brilliant dual performance as Melinda and Melinda.

That actually fits well into the film's theme - the existence of two parallel universes; For some, life is a comedy, for others, a tragedy.A discussion between two writers as to whether life is a tragedy or a comedy ends with two radical reinterpretation of what is basically the same situation.

In both tales Melinda is part in a love triangle or two, and in both there is a suicide attempt.Other than that, the stories couldn't have been more different.

928630,A361LE16VBQDP8,B000AM6P2U,Robert Bezimienny,"[3, 4]","It was with great misgivings that we purchased tickets to Melinda and Melinda, hoping that the newspaper reviewers had not, yet again, exaggerated a 'return to form' from Woody Allen, but, frankly, fearing the worst.  So many of his recent films have been close to unwatchable.  Deconstructing Harry was the last that really impressed.  We left the cinema thrilled - this is a good film, at times utterly surprising, with elements of his past work (to both good and bad effect) and visits to unexpectedly new emotional territories.*Firstly, it is patently clear that Allen is not suggesting that tragedy and comedy is simply a matter of perspective (yes, such an analysis is rather banal, as pointed out by various critics); instead, the film exemplifies the fact that there is less difference between the two genres than might be expected.  Thus, the allegedly 'tragic' story-line holds as much black comedy as does the 'comedic' tale, and vice versa for the tragedy quota. It is incredibly ungenerous to think this accidental - Allen knows full well that he is playing with expectations. Both comedy and tragedy are, accordingly to Allen, motivated ultimately by the same fear - that of mortality.*The framing of the stories by the debate between playwrights in a restaurant risks being pretentiously self-referential, but against the odds succeeds, and if anything hints at how Allen himself generates stories and characters. It is also great to see Wallace Shawn on screen again.*Radha Mitchell's performance is stunning.  In the 'tragic' role, she is asked to portray a woman not just on the verge of madness, but one who has stepped several times over the edge.  The veneer of normality which she wears is, in part, cast over her by those around her, for they are not able to grant that she is truly unlike them - and Allen has written a role here that goes further than those he has created previously (perhaps Judy Davis' part in Deconstructing Harry is the most direct antecedent). The mental anguish here is wild enough to warrant diagnosing the Melinda character as having Borderline Personality Disorder, and the effect such a person has on their peers is tellingly depicted.  Her inner emptiness, her lack of a stable self, is painful to watch.  The incoherent way in which her desires coexist and conflict is evident in both her expressions and her actions.  It seems to me a masterful portrayal made possible by an uncomfortably insightful script.*Allen does suggest that even the more apparently functional characters suffer an inner hollowness.  The urbanity of the composer, Ellis Moonsong, is a thin camouflage for his narcissism, and his romanticism is an excuse, one that he hardly can acknowledge, for philandering.  The Laurel and Lee couple have married for all the superficially right reasons, yet he seeks oblvion in drink and sex, and she in shopping - their behaviour is not incomprehensible, but springs from their inner frailty and disjointedness.  In the comedic tale, all the characters seemingly celebrate their superficiality, and this accounts for the difference in tone - the message, Allen's take on life, is surprisingly similar (and pessimistic).*The main problem I have with Allen is his 'message'.  He writes his own psychological limitations large, and dramatises them skilfully, wonderfully, in his varied cast of characters - not just in the Will Ferrell Woody impersonator, but in all the characters.  The limitation which shapes things too pervasively is the inability to embrace change, and hence to envisage positive change - related to this is the inability for couples to change in response to each other.  Thus, and this holds for all his films, the male characters are incapable of change, and if compelled to by their female partners they refuse, leading to the end of the relationship, and the male 'going back to the beginning', that is recreating the status quo, by having a new 'love', a new affair, which is new in name only - emotionally the male has not travelled one inch.  The women, misogynistically, generally collapse and fracture in the face of this 'rejection' or, more accurately, intransigence.  Thus Allen is incapable of depicting a deep ongoing loving relationship between a man and a woman.  Change is terrifying, especially for the man.  And this fear of change is dignified by calling upon a fear of death, a fear that unconvincingly is said to justify living for the moment - the latter, for Allen, means succumbing to sexual whims - of the many ways to live for the moment, Allen always suggests the same limited options.  Having seen his films, one might think that the only reply available to our recognising ourselves to be mortal is to have yet another one-night-stand (even if the one night was in fact drawn out to one month and included several evenings listening to Mahler).  The history of the world suggests that other replies do exist.*Speculating still further, perhaps Allen is committed to exemplifying some crudely Freudian idea, that a man under the undue influence of a mother, can't change - he is condemned to forever be a child.  He is being asked to always remain pre-adolescent.  How seriously Allen embodies this is unclear: it does, at least, furnish him with some hilarious titles for his characters' works, such as 'The Castration Sonata' here, and 'The Castrating Zionist' (a story about his mother) elsewhere.*Nevertheless, Allen brilliantly succeeds in externalising his inner demons.  His own psychopathology comes alive in the drama.  And, yes, there are some great one-liners.",4,Jewish humour is not without a tragic element...,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,5585,"['was', 'great', 'misgivings', 'purchased', 'tickets', 'Melinda',

928633,A3P6XT8Y1FEF3,B000AM6P2U,Seamus,"[11, 11]","The biggest challenge facing Woody Allen as a filmmaker these days is that every movie he makes is directed by Woody Allen.  As soon as his name is attached to a film people want to judge it by a different set of rules.  You have a group of people who don't like Woody Allen films, they don't ""get"" them, and they never will.  You have another group that chooses to judge Allen based on his personal life, not his work, and they've openly despised him for the last decade.Of course, the worst group is made up of the so-called ""Allen fans"" who always want to compare Woody to Woody.  Every film he makes is destined to be criticized because it's not as excellent as ""Annie Hall"" or some of his other instant classics.  That hardly seems fair.  The truth is that a lot of Allen's recent films would be praised if they were made by a young director on the way up, but because it's Woody Allen he's unjustly scrutinized for not making the films that other people expect.  Again, this hardly seems fair.""Melinda and Melinda"" might not be a great movie, but it is very good.  If you've previously enjoyed any of Allen's lighter movies, then it's safe to say you should enjoy this one.  The film begins with two writers having a dinner conversation about comedy versus tragedy in life.  Another diner relates an anecdote to the two men and they each claim it for their preferred genre.  The movie then turns into each author telling his story.  We see the character, Melinda, arriving at two different dinner parties followed by two stories that play out differently.  One is a tragedy about a woman leading a cursed life and the other turns into a romantic comedy.  Just as you get a feel for one story, the movie jumps to the other.  It can be a bit frustrating if you're getting involved with the first tale, but it's still an interesting idea for a movie.The two stories told by the writers don't really go anywhere, and some viewers might have a problem with that.  The point of the film isn't the actual story.  Instead, it's to show how tragedy and comedy are intertwined and how two people can see the same thing in a different light.  The stories each feature over-the-top performances and story lines that fit their respective dramas.  In the tragedy the Melinda character chain smokes, takes pills, and gives monologues straight out of a Lifetime movie.  The comedy doesn't inspire hysterics, but instead it's a witty send up of Allen's own movies, complete with Will Ferrell and Amanda Peet doing their best Allen and Diane Keaton impersonations, while the Melinda character seems like your average, overwhelmed sitcom lead.  It's almost as if Allen intended to satirize each genre.As I mentioned earlier, the movie can get frustrating at times.  Ultimately, neither story amounts to much and they lack the type of conclusion that some people might expect in a movie.  In the case of the comedy, it seems like there was enough of a story to make a fun, inconsequential movie that would easily top most the romantic comedies made today.  But the acting in each segment is great.  In the tragedy, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloe Sevigny do an excellent job of impersonating dramatic stage actors.  As previously mentioned, Peet and Ferrell adequately imitate the screwball comedies of the studio era, though you have to wonder if Ferrell should have been given more opportunities for physical comedy.In the end, this is a satisfying movie that should entertain the biggest of Allen fans, but it might not be of interest to casual fans or those in search of something deep.",4,Perhaps Best Left for Real Allen Fans,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,3571,"['biggest', 'challenge', 'facing', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'filmmaker', 'days', 'movie', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'As', 'soon', 'name', 'attached', 'film', 'people', 'want', 'judge', 'different', 'set', 'rules', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'never', 'will', 'have', 'group', 'judge', 'Allen', 'based', 'personal', 'life', 'not', 'work', ""'ve"", 'openly', 'despised', 'last', 'decade.Of', 'course', 'worst', 'group', 'made', 'so-called', 'Allen', 'fans', 'who', 'always', 'want', 'compare', 'Woody', 'Woody', 'Every', 'film', 'destined', 'be', 'criticized', 'not', 'as', 'excellent', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'other', 'instant', 'classics', 'hardly', 'fair', 'truth', 'lot', 'Allen', 'recent', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'praised', 'were', 'made', 'young', 'director', 'way', 'up', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'unjustly', 'scrutinized', 'not', 'making', 'films', 'other', 'people', 'expect', 'Again', 'hardly', 'fair', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'good', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'enjoyed', 'Allen', 'lighter', 'movies', 'then', 'safe', 'say', 'should', 'enjoy', 'one', 'film', 'two', 'writers', 'having', 'dinner', 'conversation', 'comedy', 'versus', 'tragedy', 'life', 'diner', 'anecdote', 'two', 'men', 'claim', 'preferred', 'genre', 'movie', 'then', 'author', 'telling', 'story', 'see', 'character', 'Melinda', 'arriving', 'two', 'different', 'dinner', 'parties', 'followed', 'two', 'stories', 'play', 'out', 'differently', 'One', 'tragedy', 'woman', 'leading', 'cursed', 'life', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Just', 'get', 'feel', 'one', 'story', 'movie', 'other', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'frustrating', ""'re"", 'getting', 'involved', 'first', 'tale', 'still', 'interesting', 'idea', 'movie.The', 'two', 'stories', 'told', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'viewers', 'might', 'have', 'problem', 'point', 'film', ""n't"", 'actual', 'story', 'Instead', 'show', 'how', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'are', 'intertwined', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'same', 'thing', 'different', 'light', 'stories', 'feature', 'over-the-top', 'performances', 'story', 'lines', 'fit', 'respective', 'dramas', 'tragedy', 'Melinda', 'character', 'chain', 'smokes', 'pills', 'monologues', 'straight', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'hysterics', 'instead', 'witty', 'send', 'Allen', 'own', 'movies', 'complete', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'doing', 'best', 'Allen', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'impersonations', 'Melinda', 'character', 'average', 'overwhelmed', 'sitcom', 'lead', 'almost', 'Allen', 'intended', 'satirize', 'genre.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'frustrating', 'times', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'amounts', 'much', 'lack', 'type', 'conclusion', 'people', 'might', 'expect', 'movie', 'case', 'comedy', 'was', 'enough', 'story', 'make', 'fun', 'inconsequential', 'movie', 'would', 'easily', 'top', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'made', 'today', 'acting', 'segment', 'great', 'tragedy', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'impersonating', 'dramatic', 'stage', 'actors', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Peet', 'Ferrell', 'adequately', 'imitate', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'studio', 'era', 'have', 'wonder', 'Ferrell', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'opportunities', 'physical', 'comedy.In', 'end', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'should', 'entertain', 'biggest', 'Allen', 'fans', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'interest', 'casual', 'fans', 'search', 'something', 'deep']",N/A

I followed him through thick and thin and supported him despite his morally questionable personal life.  But the sad fact about Woody is that his time has come and gone.He was a genius and produced some of the funniest and most provocative works in Hollywood with Annie Hall, Manhattan, Everything You Wanted to Know about Sex, and Hannah and Her Sisters.  But then he began to repeat his same old obsessive themes about sex and death, fidelity and irresistible sexual impulses towards people half his age (or half his character's age.  I'm not judging that.  I understand.  I just don't want to see that same scenario played out over and over again!)The concept of Melinda and Melinda is wonderful.  Woody poses the question: can the same story be told twice, the first time round as a tragedy and second time round as a comedy?  Does all comedy have a tragic element?  Is the sadness and sorrow of life only bearable if we can learn to laugh at ourselves and see the absurd?Excellent questions, unique and original idea.  But the movie itself flops.  It goes back-and-forth and we get confused with the characters.  Frankly, I hardly found anything funny in the supposedly comic version of the story.  Moreover, I believe that this would have worked better if Allen had created two separate stories and played them back to back.  One would have been the comedy and the next would have been a tragedy.  That would have worked much better than the choppiness of this current flick.  But in general, I would say that Woody lost his hilarity a good 10 years ago.Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road",2,Don't waste your time,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,1675,"['would', 'like', 'say', 'decades', 'was', 'ardent', 'fan', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'followed', 'thick', 'thin', 'supported', 'morally', 'questionable', 'personal', 'life', 'sad', 'fact', 'Woody', 'time', 'come', 'gone.He', 'was', 'genius', 'produced', 'funniest', 'most', 'provocative', 'works', 'Hollywood', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'Everything', 'Wanted', 'Know', 'Sex', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'then', 'began', 'repeat', 'same', 'old', 'obsessive', 'themes', 'sex', 'death', 'fidelity', 'irresistible', 'sexual', 'impulses', 'towards', 'people', 'age', 'character', 'age', ""'m"", 'not', 'judging', 'understand', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'same', 'scenario', 'played', 'out', 'over', 'again', 'concept', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'wonderful', 'Woody', 'question', 'can', 'same', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'tragedy', 'second', 'time', 'round', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'have', 'tragic', 'element', 'sadness', 'sorrow', 'life', 'only', 'bearable', 'can', 'learn', 'laugh', 'see', 'absurd', 'Excellent', 'questions', 'unique', 'original', 'idea', 'movie', 'back-and-forth', 'get', 'confused', 'characters', 'Frankly', 'hardly', 'found', 'anything', 'funny', 'supposedly', 'comic', 'version', 'story', 'Moreover', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'Allen', 'had', 'created', 'two', 'separate', 'stories', 'played', 'back', 'back', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'comedy', 'next', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tragedy', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'choppiness', 'current', 'flick', 'general', 'would', 'say', 'Woody', 'lost', 'hilarity', 'good', '10', 'years', 'ago.Sigrid', 'MacdonaldAuthor', ""D'Amour"", 'Road']",N/A
928635,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B000AM6P2U,Sirin,"[0, 0]","Woody Allen's humour is picking up a distinctly wintry chill in his late period. He still runs through the old riffs, the gags, the playfulness with form, the one liners. But more and more, these days, he overlays it with the growing mortal fear - that has existed throughout his filmic and comedic careers - that life is ultimately meaningless ('a soap bubble' as Chekhov called it, referenced in this movie) and could end in a snap of a finger.Melinda and Melinda is an interesting exercise in form. Two plots played out side by side, Sliding Doors style. A distressed and dishevelled woman knocks on the door of an apartment where a smart dinner party is taking place. How does this work? One interpretation - the tragic, takes the story with this incident as its climax. The woman, Melinda, has suffered a suicidal breakdown after her love life has run into deception and infidelity and betrayal. The second interpretation takes this incident as the start point, and Melinda enters the lives of an out of work actor (played by Will Ferrell the 'Woody Allen' character as it were) and his ambitious movie producer wife. Ups and downs and wrangles and walks in Central Park and pouring out of feelings and intellectual navel gazing all follow in this story too, but it is ultimately a comedy in the Shakespearean sense, with an uplifting resolution.What is life? So tragic in its base facts that all you can do is laugh at it and appreciate the romantic moments? Or something else.

As they have dinner, their male guest begins relating the events of a woman's life. As Max and Sy interpret them, we see two halves of the same whole, presenting the events as comedy or tragedy. In each story, Melinda (Radha Mitchell) attempts to put her life back together again. In the tragedy, she and her friend, Laurel (Chloe Sevigny), are both interested in the same man, Ellis Moonsong (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Stephen Frear's ""Dirty Pretty Things""). Laurel is bored with her husband, Lee (Johnny Lee Miller), an actor who teaches the students he has affairs with. Melinda is so distraught by other events in her life that this might be the last straw. In the comedy, Melinda moves into a sublet downstairs from Hobie (Will Farrell) and Susan (Amanda Peet). Susan is an aspiring director trying to raise money for her first film. Hobie is a struggling actor. Hobie finds himself attracted to Melinda, but he is married. As the attraction grows, events in their lives keep changing.Woody Allen's newest film, ""Melinda and Melinda"", is a dull, unlikable story that will probably alienate many of his most ardent admirers.The concept is an interesting one. To present what is basically the same story, in two different interpretations. Allen cuts back and forth and many of the locations and events in both stories are similar. Unfortunately, the comedy is only mildly amusing and the tragedy concerns such an unlikable group of people that we simply can't muster any sympathy for them, therefore we don't care what might happen to them.I have heard comments about how the cutting back and forth confused some people. It plays pretty straight forward. Radha Mitchell is in most of the scenes and she has two different haircuts and personalities, which help establish the two stories quite a bit. Some of the settings are shared by both stories, but this isn't all that confusing. For instance, a small candle lit restaurant is visited by Melinda and Laurel in one scene and by Melinda and Hobie in another. This doesn't seem very confusing to me. In each story, different characters attempt similar things. Again, each story is populated with different actors. Each story even begins in a different building.In most of Allen's recent films, if he doesn't appear in them, he finds an actor to play the role that he would've played. It is fairly easy to spot who that character is, because the actors appear to be doing an impersonation of Allen. In a way, this is a positive step forward. Watching Allen romance actresses who are twenty or thirty years his junior is just painful. Hearing them talk about how they are attracted to his `intellectual wisdom' is mind-numbing. In these films, he is hiring younger actors to play the character, so the romances involving younger actresses are easier to stomach. In ""Melinda"", the Allen character is Hobie and he is played by Will Farrell. I find it easier to believe that Farrell and Amanda Peet's character would get married. However, they still have conversations that only Allen can write. Farrell does manage to inject a little of his manic persona into the character, but at times, he also appears to be impersonating Allen. He speaks the lines with the same mannerisms Allen would use. If Allen is going to use a surrogate for his persona, he should also let them interpret the characters more freely.The comedy portion of the film is mildly funny, during short periods. On a couple of occasions, Farrell is allowed to let loose and it seems like the screen lights up. More often than not, the characters walk through the story like mummies sleepwalking, reading Allen's dialogue, which seems more and more stiff with every film.In an early scene, Lee (Miller) describes to a party of friends how he walked in on Laurel (Sevigny), his wife, late one night, and she ""was listening to Mahler, with tears streaming down her face."" Each of these characters is in their late 20s or early thirties. Who, who, who in this age group talks like that and who in this group listens to Mahler? I think it is great that Allen is trying to contemporize his films, but unless he can actually write younger characters, the experiment won't work. The characters seem like actors playing in a play, delivering dialogue written by a well-meaning writer, trying to present a story that is well-meaning and powerful. But nothing is working, no matter how hard anyone is trying.Also, Allen seems to be going a bit off the deep end. Some of his characters have the most ludicrous names. At the mention of these names, people in the audience started laughing, clearly in on the joke. However, some of the names are used in the tragedy part of the story. People shouldn't be laughing during a tragedy. The man that Laurel and Melinda are attracted to is Ellis Moonsong (Ejiofor). Someone tries to fix Melinda up with Sal Silverbeam. A character in the comedy, a private detective is called Crutchfield. I may not remember the names correctly, but the concept is correct. These are the types of names someone in Junior High would use in the creative writing essays.So the comedy part of the story only works sporadically. How about the tragedy? Melinda shows up in the middle of Lee and Laurel's dinner party and appears distraught, and begins telling the assembled guests about her problems. Some of these guests are strangers, yet everything about Melinda is about Melinda. She rambles on and expects people to fetch her a drink. Throughout this portion of the story, everyone acts so horribly to everyone else it seems a miracle than any of them are able to survive in the real world. People cheat on one another; lie to each other, etc. Not a single person is likable and we are unable to feel any sympathy for any of them. If we don't feel sympathy, we don't care for them. If we don't care for them, we are merely watching a bunch of actors spouting overwritten dialogue.""Melinda and Melinda"" is not an enjoyable effort by Woody Allen. He is making a couple of steps in the right direction, but he needs to make a couple of more steps before he subjects people to another film.",2,Very Disappointing Effort by Allen,1111622400,"03 24,

928641,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000AM6P2U,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 6]","A few years ago, Woody Allen criticized directors who spend two or three years between making pictures only for many critics to respond that with the quality of his recent output, maybe he ought to spend more time honing his own material. They have a point. Certainly of late it's too often felt that he's a disinterested businessman fulfilling a deal that'll keep him ticking over until something better comes along. Case in point, Melinda and Melinda, an unfortunate misfire that, like much of The Mighty Aphrodite, feels like Woody Allen has taken a premise and just thrown one-liners at it in the hope that some of them will stick rather than properly fleshing it out. Unfortunately, in the mouths of a rather second-rate cast of (mostly) underachievers who never really gel with each other despite (mostly) giving technically competent but unengaging performances, both the dramatic and comic interpretations of Miranda's story feel stale and tedious - and surprisingly badly written. Maybe the two rival playwrights are meant to be palpably bad writers, but even that doesn't excuse the clumsiness of Allen's exposition and characterization here.Sadly there's no single great performance to pull the film together. Radha Mitchell tries but, while her comic face is sporadically engaging, never really catches fire, with her dramatic scenes feeling too premeditated and overly prepared. Chloe Sevigny, Amanda Peet and Chiwetel Ejiofor are the more successful of the supporting players, but most, like Jonny Lee Miller, simply feel like they're third or fourth choice actors reciting awkward lines in a bad play rather than flesh and blood people. And it's getting genuinely tiresome to see his leading men doing Woody Allen impersonations instead of giving a performance (here a weak Will Ferrell). Worse, the film feels incomplete, as if a third interpretation, mixing tragedy and comedy to show how it should be done, is missing. Instead, we're left with a hole waiting to be filled while a disinterested group of thespians watch from the sidelines while waiting for a bus.",2,Weak stuff by anyone's standards,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2080,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'criticized', 'directors', 'who', 'spend', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'making', 'pictures', 'only', 'many', 'critics', 'respond', 'quality', 'recent', 'output', 'maybe', 'ought', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'honing', 'own', 'material', 'have', 'point', 'Certainly', 'late', 'too', 'often', 'felt', 'disinterested', 'businessman', 'fulfilling', 'deal', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'ticking', 'something', 'better', 'along', 'Case', 'point', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'unfortunate', 'misfire', 'much', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'feels', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'taken', 'premise', 'just', 'thrown', 'one-liners', 'hope', 'will', 'stick', 'rather', 'properly', 'fleshing', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'mouths', 'rather', 'second-rate', 'cast', 'mostly', 'underachievers', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'gel', 'other', 'mostly', 'giving', 'technically', 'competent', 'unengaging', 'performances', 'dramatic', 'comic', 'interpretations', 'Miranda', 'story', 'feel', 'stale', 'tedious', 'surprisingly', 'badly', 'written', 'Maybe', 'two', 'rival', 'playwrights', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'palpably', 'bad', 'writers', 'even', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'clumsiness', 'Allen', 'exposition', 'characterization', 'here.Sadly', 'single', 'great', 'performance', 'pull', 'film', 'together', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'tries', 'comic', 'face', 'sporadically', 'engaging', 'never', 'really', 'catches', 'fire', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'feeling', 'too', 'premeditated', 'overly', 'prepared', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'are', 'more', 'successful', 'supporting', 'players', 'most', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'simply', 'feel', ""'re"", 'third', 'fourth', 'choice', 'actors', 'reciting', 'awkward', 'lines', 'bad', 'play', 'rather', 'flesh', 'blood', 'people', 'getting', 'genuinely', 'tiresome', 'see', 'leading', 'men', 'doing', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'impersonations', 'instead', 'giving', 'performance', 'here', 'weak', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Worse', 'film', 'feels', 'incomplete', 'third', 'interpretation', 'mixing', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'show', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'missing', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'left', 'hole', 'waiting', 'be', 'filled', 'disinterested', 'group', 'thespians', 'watch', 'sidelines', 'waiting', 'bus']",N/A
928642,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AM6P2U,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","What I say may sound very harsh, but as a fan of his films, I have to say sincerely to Woody Allen, 'You don't have to make a film every year.'  Of course, things were deifferent until the 90s, when Allen and stars in his films were nominated for some awards including Oscar like every year, and we were introduced to the talents like Jennifer Tilley, Mira Sorvino and Samantha Morton through his films.In 'Melinda & Melinda,' however, that doens't happen.  As an avid fan I go to see it, and leave the theater with perplexed feelings, knowing that this is not Allen's best, nor worst, and trying to imagine whether or not I am not the only one who is disappointed with what I had seen.  I didn't like 'Sweet and Lowdown' very much, but I really liked the adorable Samantha Morton.  Even when flawed, Allen's films had something that impressed me one way or another.  But not here.[TWO MELINDAs} In 'Melinda & Melinda' we see a group of filmmakers discussing the nature of comedy and tragedy.  One of them starts of tell a story out of a situation, in which a woman named Melinda knocks on the door of a New York loft.  In there the host and guests were having a dinner, but all interrupted by the sudden visit of uninvited Melinda.Now, following the heated argument of the characters in the opening frame section, the film uses this familiar premise about Melinda, and presents two versions of Melinda's story told one after the other.  One is the tragedy version and ther the comedy version.  Allen's idea is that the same actor (Radha Mitchell, 'Pitch Black') plays the both Melindas.[CONFUSING AND HALF-HEARTED] The gimmick works only for the first few scenes.  The problem is that we soon realize the two versions are after all different stories, and none of them is interesting at all.  The characters including Melinda are unmemorable except a few.  Even Roger Ebert, who praised this film very much, admits we don't care the characters, but tries to defend the film by saying that maybe that is Allen's point.  Is so, what's the point of making a tragedy or comedy of which character we don't care?But I have to admit some good things about the film.  Among the players including Amanda Peet, Chlo Sevigny, Jonny Lee Miller, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, it is Will Ferrell who gets the best prize.  Will Ferrell plays the role Allen usually gives to himself, and without relying on his goofy mugging of his face in other films, Will Ferrell is quite funny and likable (much likable and better than Kenneth Branaugh in 'Celebrity').  Also good is Mitchell who plays the double roles, and their acting proves that Allen has not lost his skills to induce the actors to give their best.But as to the film itself, all I can say is that you cannot pack comedy and tragedy in one film in this way.  Suppose some one else directed a film like this, what would you say?  Only Allen is allowed to make a film like this, but even he cannot make it little better than a curiosity in his impressive filmography.",2,"Two Melindas, Comedy Version and Tragedy Version: None of Them Is Impressive",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2999,"['What', 'say', 'may', 'sound', 'very', 'harsh', 'fan', 'films', 'have', 'say', 'sincerely', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""'You"", 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'film', 'year', 'course', 'things', 'were', 'deifferent', '90s', 'when', 'Allen', 'stars', 'films', 'were', 'nominated', 'awards', 'including', 'Oscar', 'year', 'were', 'introduced', 'talents', 'Jennifer', 'Tilley', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'films.In', ""'Melinda"", 'Melinda', 'however', ""doens't"", 'happen', 'avid', 'fan', 'go', 'see', 'leave', 'theater', 'perplexed', 'feelings', 'knowing', 'not', 'Allen', 'best', 'worst', 'trying', 'imagine', 'not', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'disappointed', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', ""'Sweet"", 'Lowdown', 'very', 'much', 'really', 'liked', 'adorable', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Even', 'when', 'flawed', 'Allen', 'films', 'had', 'something', 'impressed', 'one', 'way', 'not', 'here', '[', 'TWO', 'MELINDAs', ""'Melinda"", 'Melinda', 'see', 'group', 'filmmakers', 'discussing', 'nature', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'One', 'starts', 'tell', 'story', 'situation', 'woman', 'named', 'Melinda', 'knocks', 'door', 'New', 'York', 'loft', 'host', 'guests', 'were', 'having', 'dinner', 'interrupted', 'sudden', 'visit', 'uninvited', 'Melinda.Now', 'following', 'heated', 'argument', 'characters', 'opening', 'frame', 'section', 'film', 'familiar', 'premise', 'Melinda', 'presents', 'two', 'versions', 'Melinda', 'story', 'told', 'one', 'other', 'One', 'tragedy', 'version', 'ther', 'comedy', 'version', 'Allen', 'idea', 'same', 'actor', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Black', 'Melindas', '[', 'CONFUSING', 'HALF-HEARTED', ']', 'gimmick', 'only', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'problem', 'soon', 'realize', 'two', 'versions', 'are', 'different', 'stories', 'none', 'interesting', 'characters', 'including', 'Melinda', 'are', 'unmemorable', 'few', 'Even', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'praised', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'defend', 'film', 'saying', 'maybe', 'Allen', 'point', 'so', 'what', 'point', 'making', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'have', 'admit', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'players', 'including', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'best', 'prize', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'role', 'Allen', 'usually', 'relying', 'goofy', 'mugging', 'face', 'other', 'films', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'quite', 'funny', 'likable', 'much', 'likable', 'better', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', ""'Celebrity"", 'Also', 'good', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'double', 'roles', 'acting', 'Allen', 'not', 'lost', 'skills', 'induce', 'actors', 'give', 'best.But', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'pack', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'one', 'film', 'way', 'Suppose', 'one', 'else', 'directed', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'Only', 'Allen', 'allowed', 'make', 'film', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'little', 'better', 'curiosity', 'impressive', 'filmography']",N/A
928643,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B000AM6P2U,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[2, 4]","The opening of ""Melinda and Melinda"" is set in a Chinese restaurant where four friends discuss the topic of comedy vs. tragedy. Do people prefer comedy since it provides a means of escape, or do they prefer tragedy's identifiable humanity? The question is interesting and relevant, thus giving the audience something to connect with right off the bat. Two of the four friends each give an example of either tragedy or comedy using a similar story of a woman (Melinda, played by Radha Mitchell) barging in on a dinner party.The first story concerns Laurel (Chlo Sevigny) and her actor husband Lee (Jonny Lee Miller). Lee is unfaithful to Laurel, has a rough drinking problem, and is out-of-work. In fact, the opening dinner party includes a man from who Lee is trying to coax a job opportunity. Melinda bursts in and Laurel and her best friend Cassie (Brooke Smith) are surprised to see her; they are old friends from their school days and haven't seen her in ages. In this story, the tragedy, Melinda is arguably insane, spilling out sob stories left and right and downing white wine and cigarettes like it's nobody's business.The second story is the comedy, surrounding the independent film maker Susan (Amanda Peet), her neurotic husband Hobie (Will Ferrell, the Woody Allen surrogate) and Melinda's random run-in with the couple on the night of Susan's dinner party with an important producer. This is a romantic tale of willing infidelity and those delicious Allen one-liners. Here, Melinda isn't a melodramatic mess but a rather normal human being, able to cope with every day downers and happy most of the time regardless. Both Melindas are very different and while Melinda epitomizes the tragedy in the former tale, she blends in with the latter which is more distinctly comic than the former is tragic.The tales intertwine and have been accused of being confusing, but in some ways Allen's direction is effective in emphasizing the film's ultimate point that life is capable of containing both aspects; it is not strictly sad or hilarious, but one within the other: it all depends on how you look at things. Also, the men telling each story are basing it on a similar beginning of a woman bursting in on an important dinner party. The finer, more crucial details in each story differentiate them enough that the integration in no way hinders the film's direction. To top it all off, Allen's masterful eye allows for a refreshing pace: the movie felt neither too long nor too short. Aiding in ""Melinda""s unusually compelling aura is Radha Mitchell.Mitchell gives a complex, well-modulated performance that can be wise and naive, sad and hilarious (in their respective genres, of course). I had not seen Mitchell do work anywhere near this good since her breakthrough in 1998's near-masterpiece ""High Art"". In ""Melinda"" she balances the vulnerability and intensity in each version of the title character. Sevigny also impresses with her portrait of romantic conflict. She is luminously mature and this may be her best performance yet (excluding ""Boys Don't Cry,"" which I've not yet seen). The rest of the cast is warm and well-cast, including a hilarious Will Ferrell, the matter-of-fact Brooke Smith, and Chiwetel Ejiofor (who, I may add, only continues to impress since his nomination-worthy turn in 2003's ""Dirty Pretty Things""). The tech contributions are all well-done, including the usual jazz underscore and well-framed cinematography, recreating yet again Allen's gorgeous interpretation of New York City.",4,"A fine, complex, and witty experiment",1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,3519,"['opening', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'set', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'where', 'four', 'friends', 'discuss', 'topic', 'comedy', 'vs.', 'tragedy', 'Do', 'people', 'prefer', 'comedy', 'means', 'escape', 'do', 'prefer', 'tragedy', 'identifiable', 'humanity', 'question', 'interesting', 'relevant', 'thus', 'giving', 'audience', 'something', 'connect', 'right', 'bat', 'Two', 'four', 'friends', 'give', 'example', 'tragedy', 'comedy', 'using', 'similar', 'story', 'woman', 'Melinda', 'played', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'barging', 'dinner', 'party.The', 'first', 'story', 'concerns', 'Laurel', 'Chlo', 'Sevigny', 'actor', 'husband', 'Lee', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Lee', 'unfaithful', 'Laurel', 'rough', 'drinking', 'problem', 'out-of-work', 'fact', 'opening', 'dinner', 'party', 'man', 'who', 'Lee', 'trying', 'coax', 'job', 'opportunity', 'Melinda', 'Laurel', 'best', 'friend', 'Cassie', 'Brooke', 'Smith', 'are', 'surprised', 'see', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'school', 'days', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'ages', 'story', 'tragedy', 'Melinda', 'arguably', 'insane', 'spilling', 'out', 'sob', 'stories', 'left', 'right', 'downing', 'white', 'wine', 'cigarettes', 'nobody', 'business.The', 'second', 'story', 'comedy', 'surrounding', 'independent', 'film', 'maker', 'Susan', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'neurotic', 'husband', 'Hobie', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'surrogate', 'Melinda', 'random', 'run-in', 'couple', 'night', 'Susan', 'dinner', 'party', 'important', 'producer', 'romantic', 'tale', 'willing', 'infidelity', 'delicious', 'Allen', 'one-liners', 'Here', 'Melinda', ""n't"", 'melodramatic', 'mess', 'rather', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'able', 'cope', 'day', 'downers', 'happy', 'most', 'time', 'regardless', 'Melindas', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Melinda', 'tragedy', 'former', 'tale', 'latter', 'more', 'distinctly', 'comic', 'former', 'tragic.The', 'tales', 'intertwine', 'have', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'confusing', 'ways', 'Allen', 'direction', 'effective', 'emphasizing', 'film', 'ultimate', 'point', 'life', 'capable', 'containing', 'aspects', 'not', 'strictly', 'sad', 'hilarious', 'one', 'other', 'how', 'look', 'things', 'Also', 'men', 'telling', 'story', 'are', 'basing', 'similar', 'beginning', 'woman', 'bursting', 'important', 'dinner', 'party', 'finer', 'more', 'crucial', 'details', 'story', 'differentiate', 'enough', 'integration', 'way', 'film', 'direction', 'top', 'off', 'Allen', 'masterful', 'eye', 'refreshing', 'pace', 'movie', 'felt', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'short', 'Aiding', 'Melinda', 's', 'unusually', 'compelling', 'aura', 'Radha', 'Mitchell.Mitchell', 'complex', 'well-modulated', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'wise', 'naive', 'sad', 'hilarious', 'respective', 'genres', 'course', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Mitchell', 'do', 'work', 'anywhere', 'good', 'breakthrough', '1998', 'near-masterpiece', 'High', 'Art', 'Melinda', 'vulnerability', 'intensity', 'version', 'title', 'character', 'Sevigny', 'also', 'portrait', 'romantic', 'conflict', 'luminously', 'mature', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'excluding', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', ""'ve"", 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'rest', 'cast', 'warm', 'well-cast', 'including', 'hilarious', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'matter-of-fact', 'Brooke', 'Smith', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'who', 'may', 'add', 'only', 'impress', 'nomination-worthy', 'turn', '2003', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'tech', 'contributions', 'are', 'well-done', 'including', 'usual', 'jazz', 'underscore', 'well-framed', 'cinematography', 'recreating', 'yet', 'again', 'Allen', 'gorgeous', 'interpretation', 'New', 'York', 'City']",N/A
928644,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000AM6P2U,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[4, 7]","Melinda and Melinda is a concept film. And a good concept at that. Basically, two writers are having dinner with some friends and discussing whether life is comic or tragic. A friend begins to tell a story and each writer gives their perspective on how to make it a tragic or a comic tale. So begins our two movies within the movie.With the director, and such a great cast, you'd think this film would easily be bound for greatness. On the contrary, you're bound for boredom. The biggest problem with the movie is the casting of Radha Mitchell as Melinda, the only character that is involved in both stories. Her acting is stilted and she stumbles along taking scene after scene down with her. Another fault is the fact that none of the other actors are in both stories. Melinda and Melinda would have been a much more interesting film (both for the audience and for the actors) if the entire cast would have been involved in both sides of the story.As it is, the story switches back and forth between the two at a confusing pace, and doesn't apologize for moving slowly and drudgingly along. Will Ferrell offers the only breath of fresh air in this film as a married man who falls in love with Melinda and can't tell her.Overall, this movie is quite slow and although there are moments of clarity and even brilliance, you will find yourself wishing to fast forward til something intersting happens... and if you do so, you may find you've missed the whole movie.",2,Melinda + Melinda = Boring,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,1463,"['Melinda', 'Melinda', 'concept', 'film', 'good', 'concept', 'Basically', 'two', 'writers', 'are', 'having', 'dinner', 'friends', 'discussing', 'life', 'comic', 'tragic', 'friend', 'tell', 'story', 'writer', 'perspective', 'how', 'make', 'tragic', 'comic', 'tale', 'So', 'two', 'movies', 'movie.With', 'director', 'great', 'cast', ""'d"", 'think', 'film', 'would', 'easily', 'be', 'bound', 'greatness', 'contrary', ""'re"", 'bound', 'boredom', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'casting', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Melinda', 'only', 'character', 'involved', 'stories', 'acting', 'stilted', 'along', 'taking', 'scene', 'scene', 'down', 'fault', 'fact', 'none', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'stories', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'audience', 'actors', 'entire', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'sides', 'story.As', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'confusing', 'pace', ""n't"", 'apologize', 'moving', 'slowly', 'drudgingly', 'along', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'only', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'film', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'Melinda', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'her.Overall', 'movie', 'quite', 'slow', 'are', 'moments', 'clarity', 'even', 'brilliance', 'will', 'find', 'wishing', 'fast', 'forward', 'something', 'intersting', 'happens', 'do', 'so', 'may', 'find', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'whole', 'movie']",N/A
