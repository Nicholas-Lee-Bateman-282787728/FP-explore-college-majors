730808,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B00007KQA0,Brian,"[1, 1]","Director Patrick Garland's interpretation of Ibsen's famous play 'A Doll's House,' while competent and loyal to the source material, lacks effect, I think, mainly for its needlessly dry, Victorian take on a vital, perpetually contemporary theme: the systematic marginalization of those who resist the roles assigned to them by the prevailing mores and conventions of society. Missing in this production is the spirit of Ibsen's wit, which I believe would help us chuckle sympathetically, rather than scowl from a distance, at the vain hopes, hypocrisies and excesses of the playwright's bourgeois set staged in the first two acts, thus providing a much broader context, dramatically speaking, for fleshing out the universal relevancy of the poignant but potentially period-bound subject matter revealed in the third. Ironically, the film's earnest attempts to portray the play's events and characters so literally, so BBCeriously, ultimately work against it and by the final scene the whole exercise seems to have been reduced to a rather dull and dour polemic proposing feminism as an imperfect, last-ditch remedy for 19th century social injustice. Hopkins turns in a skillful but too-restrained performance as the phallocentrically rigid and self-admiring banker/husband Torvald, and Bloom (probably herself over-mature for the role) comes across as too wise and conniving to be believed as the flighty doll-wife Nora. All that having been said, though, the movie is well done. The sets are rich and befitting the era; the actors, however possibly miscast the principals (I'd like to have seen Albert Finney and Susannah York take a crack at the time), are all technically first-rate; and the story, even told as it is, without a hint of caricature, is engaging and paced efficiently by the director. 3-plus stars.",3,Competent but bloodless,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,1816,"['Director', 'Patrick', 'Garland', 'interpretation', 'Ibsen', 'famous', 'play', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'competent', 'loyal', 'source', 'material', 'effect', 'think', 'mainly', 'needlessly', 'dry', 'Victorian', 'take', 'vital', 'perpetually', 'contemporary', 'theme', 'systematic', 'marginalization', 'who', 'resist', 'roles', 'assigned', 'prevailing', 'mores', 'conventions', 'society', 'Missing', 'production', 'spirit', 'Ibsen', 'wit', 'believe', 'would', 'help', 'chuckle', 'sympathetically', 'rather', 'scowl', 'distance', 'vain', 'hopes', 'hypocrisies', 'excesses', 'playwright', 'bourgeois', 'set', 'staged', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'thus', 'providing', 'much', 'broader', 'context', 'dramatically', 'speaking', 'fleshing', 'out', 'universal', 'relevancy', 'poignant', 'potentially', 'period-bound', 'subject', 'matter', 'revealed', 'third', 'Ironically', 'film', 'earnest', 'attempts', 'portray', 'play', 'events', 'characters', 'so', 'literally', 'so', 'BBCeriously', 'ultimately', 'work', 'final', 'scene', 'whole', 'exercise', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'rather', 'dull', 'dour', 'polemic', 'proposing', 'feminism', 'imperfect', 'last-ditch', 'remedy', '19th', 'century', 'social', 'injustice', 'Hopkins', 'skillful', 'too-restrained', 'performance', 'phallocentrically', 'rigid', 'self-admiring', 'banker/husband', 'Torvald', 'Bloom', 'probably', 'over-mature', 'role', 'too', 'wise', 'conniving', 'be', 'believed', 'flighty', 'doll-wife', 'Nora', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'sets', 'are', 'rich', 'befitting', 'era', 'actors', 'however', 'possibly', 'miscast', 'principals', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Susannah', 'York', 'take', 'crack', 'time', 'are', 'technically', 'first-rate', 'story', 'even', 'told', 'hint', 'caricature', 'engaging', 'paced', 'efficiently', 'director', '3-plus', 'stars']",N/A

730811,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00007KQA0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[48, 51]","In 1973 two theatrical version of Henrik Ibsen's classic play ""A Doll's House"" were filmed.  This version, starring Claire Bloom as Nora, won national release, while the other, with Jane Fonda, ended up on ABC television.  No other play from the 19th-century continued to be performed as often as ""A Doll's House.""  The story is of what appears to be a normal family, Torvald Helmer (Anthony Hopkins), a bank lawyer, and his wife Nora, and their three small children.  Torvald has blithely assumed his wife to be a flighty little thing, but Nora has been creating a facade to please her husband.  Then we discover that in the past Nora forged a signature to get money to save her husband's life.  When this act is revealed, Torvald is outraged and renounces his wife.  Nora finally sees her husband for the miserable fraud he truly is and walks away from him and her children, leaving a stunned Torvald still trying to figure out who he has been married to all these years.  Ibsen's play is a major classic of modern drama, one of the first superb character studies that provided a psychological portrait of an actual human being.As in any production, this version of ""A Doll's House"" rests on the actress playing Nora.  With Bloom's characterization Nora is presented as being more noble than usual; her habit of lying is played down and we get the sense she is clever and cunningly playing the game of being her husband's ""doll.""  However, the result of this approach is less of an emotional range than I would expect with Nora.  Hopkins is, as you would expect, fully up to the pompous, hollow figure of Torvald.  Indeed, the final scene succeeds largely on his reactions to Nora's departure.  For me, choosing between these two 1973 films is pretty much a toss up since I am not overly enamored with either of the interpretations of Nora, although there are parts of both performances that are quite strong.  However, Bloom does have the advantage of a better supporting cast.

He was Ryan.  It is funny to think of him as a soap opera actor.  He was actually a lot more Shakespearian.One of the things we concentrated on was A Doll's House.  We took it apart.  We worked on the blocking, the intention of each line, even the unstated intention behind each line.Bernie seemed to be a big fan of Bernard Shaw.  And Shaw had a unique interpretation of A Doll's House.  Shaw thought of this play as a pure comedy about a pair of endearing and funny people, Nora and her stupid husband.  I'm paraphrasing.  Perhaps Shaw wouldn't describe it this way.  But it is what I took out of Shaw's comments.In any event, and Bernard Shaw aside, though he was my main influence here, I believe that A Doll's House was written as a comedy more than a social statement.  Ibsen himself describes it as a comedy.  Sure, there are social lessons to be learned.  But the play was meant to be funny, as far as I can tell.That leaves Claire Bloom out of the lead role.  It also leaves Jane Fonda out of it.  They are both far too serious, not doll-like enough.We are ""supposed to"" see Nora Helmer as cute, doll-like, immature, funny.  There is a reason that her father and her husband treat her the way they do.  She invites it.  She is a bit of a ditz.  She is not simply their creation.  You don't take a daughter like Claire Bloom or Jane Fonda and treat her like a ditz.  This ""doll"" is childlike.  You love her, you treasure her, you respect her, but you enjoy her for the childlike girl she is.Do you remember the tv series Laugh In?  Do you remember Goldie Hawn's role, the tattooed dancing girl with the adorable and silly smile?  There's your Nora Helmer.  Goldie Hawn in Laugh In.  There's your doll.As for her husband, you need a male version of a ditz, a bit of a pompous fool, someone like the father in Mary Poppins.I would absolutely love to see a version of this play using my interpretation.",3,Another misinterpretation,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2092,"['When', 'was', 'college', 'had', 'one-on-one', 'course', 'professional', 'actor', 'Bernie', 'Barrow', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'television', 'audience', 'star', 'soap', 'opera', 'called', 'Ryan', 'Hope', 'was', 'Ryan', 'funny', 'think', 'soap', 'opera', 'actor', 'was', 'actually', 'lot', 'more', 'Shakespearian.One', 'things', 'concentrated', 'was', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'took', 'apart', 'worked', 'blocking', 'intention', 'line', 'even', 'unstated', 'intention', 'line.Bernie', 'seemed', 'be', 'big', 'fan', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'Shaw', 'had', 'unique', 'interpretation', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'Shaw', 'thought', 'play', 'pure', 'comedy', 'pair', 'endearing', 'funny', 'people', 'Nora', 'stupid', 'husband', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'Perhaps', 'Shaw', 'would', ""n't"", 'describe', 'way', 'what', 'took', 'out', 'Shaw', 'comments.In', 'event', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'aside', 'was', 'main', 'influence', 'here', 'believe', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'was', 'written', 'comedy', 'more', 'social', 'statement', 'Ibsen', 'comedy', 'Sure', 'are', 'social', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'play', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell.That', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'lead', 'role', 'also', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'serious', 'not', 'doll-like', 'enough.We', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'Nora', 'Helmer', 'cute', 'doll-like', 'immature', 'funny', 'reason', 'father', 'husband', 'treat', 'way', 'do', 'bit', 'ditz', 'not', 'simply', 'creation', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'treat', 'ditz', 'doll', 'childlike', 'love', 'treasure', 'respect', 'enjoy', 'childlike', 'girl', 'remember', 'tv', 'series', 'Laugh', 'Do', 'remember', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'role', 'tattooed', 'dancing', 'girl', 'adorable', 'silly', 'smile', 'Nora', 'Helmer', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Laugh', 'doll.As', 'husband', 'need', 'male', 'version', 'ditz', 'bit', 'pompous', 'fool', 'someone', 'father', 'Mary', 'Poppins.I', 'would', 'absolutely', 'love', 'see', 'version', 'play', 'using', 'interpretation']",N/A

730816,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B00007KQA0,Yasha Banana,"[3, 20]","This movie version of Henrik Ibsen's world-famous play, ""A Doll's House,"" is well done; the acting, directing, photography, etc. are fine.  What I find disappointing is the ""message"" contained in ""A Doll's House.""Nora, a trophy wife, realizes that she's being treated like a child by her husband (a doll living in a doll's house) and she rebels, liberates herself as a woman. ... Ok, got it.  But is that all there is to the story?  That premise may have been controversial back in 1879 when Ibsen wrote ""A Doll's House,"" but today it's hardly controversial at all.Nora questions her role as a women, questions what her husband and what society in general expects from her as a female, but she in no way questions the *class structure* of the society in which she lives.  Nora leaves her husband and strikes out on her own; but here's the question Ibsen's doesn't answer ...Once Nora is on her own, will she go beyond mere gender politics and question a class structure that unduly rewards the economic elite while at the same time systematically exploits the general population?None of that troubles Nora's classless view of the world.  Her consciousness as a woman is raised, but what about her consciousness as a full member of society.  Meaning: as a liberated woman, will she continue to ignore, as she most certainly did as a trophy wife, the brutish, exploitive, dehumanizing nature of market-oriented class relationships.Like a great many modern-day women, Nora may declare herself a feminist but, still the same, she's not quite ready to give up her credit card at Bloomingdale's, thank-you-very-much.I don't mean to be unduly harsh on Nora.  After all, she made a, you'll excuse the expression, seminal decision leaving her husband; thumbing her nose at him and at society if they don't like ""The New Woman"" she's determined to become.  That's no mean accomplishment on her part.  She should be admired for her guts.  But what are Nora's/Ibsen's feelings about *class* politics, not just gender politics?  We don't have a clue, do we?What about, for example, the plight of the servants in the story?  They live in the doll's house, too, don't they?  What about the plight of the poor?  Shouldn't it occur to the audience to ask: What will Nora do, economically-speaking, once she leaves her husband?  What kind of work is available to her?  What kind of work is available to a woman with limited marketable skills -- especially back in 1897 when Ibsen wrote ""A Doll's House""?This never occurred to him?Or, rather, did it occur to him but he demurred, realizing that tackling *that* subject would really get him in trouble!The play could have *started* at the point where Nora leaves her husband; then we would have seen not just a liberated feminist dealing with the world around her but also a female *worker* struggling with a system that not only exploits workers in general but is especially hard on minimally-marketable female employees.Will Nora marry another man after she leaves her husband?  If so, will she marry into the same upper-class lifestyle that she just left?  That's a rather crucial question, isn't it?  But it's a question Ibsen doesn't bother to answer.Nora questions ""her-role-as-a-woman"" -- good -- but she doesn't question a society where wealth is polarized, empire revered, and where to support and protect the polarization of wealth and the prerogatives of empire the social, political, and economic deck is stacked against not just women but against all classes other than the wealthy? ... Don't you think an audience, then and now, would find it interesting to see how a sexually-liberated Nora deals with those class-oriented, transgender realities?By ending the story where he does, Ibsen limits Nora's transformation to a ""who-she-is-as-a-woman"" awakening.  Fine, but that's a decidedly limited, circumspect awakening.  It's an awakening that only goes as far as gender politics can take her.  The world, as it turns out, is far more complex.Nora is a heroine; she seeks ""gender justice.""  This takes a great deal of courage on her part.  Once the scandal that threatened their happy, well-fed home passes and is no longer a threat, she could if she chose go back to being a docile, subservient wife.  To her credit she doesn't do that.  But what about *economic* justice?  Does she say to her husband, ""You're exploiting me as a woman; oh and, by the way, let's talk a while about how you, your cronies and the crowd we run with are reaping the advantages of an ecomomic system that feeds, clothes and shelters the rich on the backs of the masses.""That confrontation doesn't happen.  Ibsen, along with many modern-day well-fed, well-clothed and well-sheltered feminists, conveniently -- or rather should we say *tellingly* -- leave that reality unexamined.The overwhelming majority of books, movies and plays, especially as these vehicles are dealt with by Hollywood filmmakers, concern themselves with the *psychological* relationships between people --love and hate, commitment and abandonment, loyalty and betrayal, greed and selflessness, kindness and insensitivity -- with an examination of those psychological realities very often taking place within the context of male-female relationships.But not everything can be explained in terms of interpersonal psychological relationships.  Important as those relationship are, unless one's worldview is societal and not merely psychological, those kinds of books, movies and plays only go so far and no further.They may be very well done, as Ibsen's play is very well done, and as this movie adaptation of the play is very well done -- but a drama that excludes history, excludes sociology, excludes politics and excludes economics has limited value if it hopes to speak to the human condition.  Ibsen's play, as well as this 1973 movie adaptation of his play, may both rise to the level of art, but they're not courageous art; they are, instead, cautious, circumspect.In short: Nora is courageous, her creator is not.  Ibsen lacked courage in creating Nora in that he has her question a deeply held convention of society, i.e., the prescribed way a woman should act back in 1879; but he fails to have her ask more important, more fundamental questions of the world in which she lives.It's quite clear in ""A Doll's House,"" that there's an upstairs/downstairs dichotomy in Nora's home.  The servants, those who live downstairs, are treated one way, while the economic elite, those who live upstairs (Nora, her husband, their well-to-do friends), given their economic status, are treated quite differently.  Those who live upstairs reap rewards greatly out of proportion to what they deserve, living as they do on the backs of the masses; moreover, their often wreckless behavior is harmful to not only those within reach but to society as a whole.  So that while Nora wants to know ""who-she-is-as-a-woman,"" what about who she might become once she has to leave her upstairs/downstairs world?  Where will she wind up in her future life, upstairs or downstairs?  Ibsen never bothers to tell us.Ibsen shows us Nora's awakening as a feminist, but what about an awakening that goes beyond feminism; an awakening that goes beyond the psychology between men and women?(Remember the movie ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner""?  A white woman, I forget the actress' name, brings home Sidney Poitier and announces to her parents that they're going to get married.  This is a typical example of Hollywood solving a complex, multi-faceted societal problem, interracial marriage, by referring to the pyschological realites between a man and a woman while, at the same time, completely ignoring the *other* realities that exist in the world, chief among them the economic system in which the individuals live. ... So, too, with Ibsen's ""A Doll's House."")Let's suppose that after Nora leaves her husband she supports herself, as more and more modern women are doing nowadays.  What kind of work can she get?  How does her society in 1879 as well as today's soceity in 2009 hold back such liberated woman?  And are such women truly liberated if their liberation is merely a sexual liberation and not a more general socio-economic liberation?How *will* she make her way in the world after she leaves her husband?  What's the story there?  One would think that Ibsen -- like all writers, always on the hunt for an intriguing story -- would *jump* at the prospect of telling that tale!  But he doesn't.  Because if he took that path he would be questioning something that it takes real courage to question.Had Ibsen in his play challenged the class relationships of a mercantile, capitalist, market-oriented society back in 1879, his message would continue to resonate to this day.  Were he to do that, producing his play then and producing his play now would require a genuine act of courage on the part of all those participating in the production.Seeing Nora's husband get p-whipped at the end of the story (Oh, Anthony Hopkins, beware the rolling pin!) must have intrigued audiences back when Ibsen wrote the play in 1879, but today it's merely ... entertainment. ... Gender politics -- and shallow gender politics at that -- devoid of class and economic consciousness.It's not inconceivable that Nora striking out on her own might have become a maid.  Think of that, Henrik Ibsen!  At that point, to be fully human, she would have to become more than simply a feminist.  To remain courageous, her worldview would have to expand.  (She'd have to not only burn her Bloomingdale's credit card but her draft card as well.)  At that point Ibsen would have to create for Nora a far more dramatic, far more inclusive, far more *astonishing* awakening than the limited, measured awakening he offers in ""A Doll's House.""Courageous as Nora's act of defiance is, it only goes so far. She's clueless when it comes to the fundamental, first-order realities of the society in which she lives.  Her heightened consciousness succeeds in throwing off only *some* of the chains society has shackled her with.  Others remain, unexamined.",1,Courageous But Clueless.,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,10092,"['movie', 'version', 'Henrik', 'Ibsen', 'world-famous', 'play', 'Doll', 'House', 'well', 'done', 'acting',
