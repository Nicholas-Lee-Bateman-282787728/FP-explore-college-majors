The hybrid kills a bunch of Chinese people with very nice bodies and a Filipina because she covets a harbor view (but she's a native HKer so how does she not remember that the harbor is always shrinking with reclaimed land so that no one gets to keep their harbor view forever?)How can the casting be an accident when the home invasions are so awful and reminiscent of the Japanese home invasions upon the Chinese?Very brutal a la Wrong Turn.

Real estate in Honk Kong is outrageously expensive. Cheng Lai is working 3 jobs to buy a place that is way above what she can afford so she adopts a peculiar scheme to bring the price of the unit down.This may be a true crime type thriller but a lot of time is spent on the details of some horribly brutal killings. Watching this film will give you a good idea of how gruesome, and protracted, death by suffocation really is. And you'll be surprised at how long someone can live with his guts sitting in his lap. And I was truly surprised at how a bed slat can be inserted in someone's mouth and still not kill them. Wonders abound here believe me.This populates (I suppose) the WTF school of film making. I watched this and couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. It was a good story idea and it was put together well in the sense of writing, directing, effects etc. but I couldn't help but wonder what it would have been like had those involved taken a higher road. Did I really need to see this stuff?!This is for gore hounds. Though it ends on an odd, but real, socio-economic note, don't think you're getting anything deep here.

The english sub titles are in white and easy to read, but quite often the actors speak cantonese very fast causing the sub titles to flash by too quickly. Many of the conversations in this film were a pleasure to follow, alot like Quentin Tarantino's movie conversations. There were alot of different guys having affairs and cheating on their wives with alot of problems and pitfalls as would be expected. There are alot of flashback scenes, but most flash a year on screen so you know, but not always.There is female and male nudity, T&A , no full frontal. One pretty good sex scene. But what everyone is talking about is the killings. You will not know why these people are singled out and killed until the end of the movie. The kills were very interesting, and many, I've never seen before. There is blood, even gore, and most of these people do not die quickly. There are some interesting ways police flex cuffs are used. The pretty killer is not a professional and at times gets almost as bad as she gives. You never know what to expect next. There are some slow spots, as her story is being told in flashbacks, but nothig serious. Some nice views of Hong Kong. The movie was well done, and the special effects were fantastic, but not really over the top, quite believable. This film brought alot of new goodies and ideas to the worn out killer/slasher gender.

Didn't know much about it but read the jacket description and decided to take a flyer on it. Good decision!""dream Home"" (2010 release from Hong Kong; 96 min.) brings the story, set in 2007 and supposedly based on true events, of a Hong Kong woman Ms. Cheng (played by Josie Ho, who also co-produced the movie) who desparately wants to buy a condo ""with a sea view"", but the crazy Hong Kong real estate market being what it was in those days, it's seemingly an impossible dream. Cheng gets driven to a murderous rampage when she thought she had a deal on her dream condo, only for the owners to renig at the last minute. Much has been made about the violence in this movie, and to be clear, this isn't for the faint of heart. I had to look away on a number of occasions, to be honest. But it is done in such a stylish way! Beauty in the orchestrated (and of course fake) violence.Hong Kong the city plays a huge role in the movie and really is the other ""star"" beside Josie Ho. I've visited Hong Kong, and what an incredibly beautiful place it is. But when you go away from the ""touristy"" part of the city (the harbor) and see how people live there (as I did by taking a local bus just going around the city's layers away from the haror), it just blows the mind how crammed everyone lives. That aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Stick around for the great extras on the DVD, with plenty of behind the scenes interviews with the director, the producers and the actors, as well as how they staged the bloody murder scenes.

Still, for someone with just the right sense of humor, this would probably be right up your alley, and enough glimmers of what could have been come through that the average filmgoer (at least, the average filmgoer who can stand movie screens awash in gore) will at least not think it sucks.Plot: As we open, Lai-sheung Cheng (&lt;em>Contagion&lt;/em>'s Josie Ho) is sneaking into a building's security room and offing the guard. After which we jump back to her at her desk, working a phone bank, trying to sell stuff. (This time shuffle is likely to confuse you for well over half the film unless you read something that tells you what the filmmaker is doing. It's not handled well at all, and this is the movie's main flaw.) Lai-sheung has craved an apartment in Victoria Harbor, an ultra-swank Hong Kong waterfront apartment building. She works two jobs, spends just enough to keep herself alive, and is deeply in debt, trying to save up the $800,000 she'll need for an efficiency. When one comes open, she jumps at the chance--but thanks to an act-of-god style timing mishap, she misses an appointment with the sellers and they tell her agent they're thinking of offering the apartment to someone else. This would be a spoiler if every major review, the movie's press packet, etc. hadn't all spelled it out before me: Lai-sheung snaps, breaks into the building, and starts killing people in order to get her hands on that apartment. The real estate game in Hong Kong really &lt;em>is&lt;/em> that deadly.The movie, the first for Ho's production company 852 Films, came out to mixed reviews that all said basically the same thing I was thinking while I watched it: there are two halves to this movie, the gore film and the satire on Hong Kong real estate, and the two don't mesh all that well. I think a lot of this has to do the the confusing time-shifting I mentioned in the plot synopsis; had that been handled a little better, this probably would have been a stronger movie than it is. Once you understand what's going on there, things come together and the movie picks up; maybe by telling you what's going on from the outset I'll have made it so you will get more out of the first half-hour-ish of this movie than you otherwise would. ***",3,Can never quite decide what it wants to be.,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,2473,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Wai', 'dor', 'lei', 'ah', 'yut', 'ho', 'lt', '>', 'Ho-cheung', 'Pang', '2010', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'English', 'title', 'lt', '>', 'Dream', 'Home', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'actually', 'did', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'Still', 'someone', 'just', 'right', 'sense', 'humor', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'enough', 'glimmers', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'come', 'average', 'filmgoer', 'least', 'average', 'filmgoer', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'movie', 'screens', 'awash', 'gore', 'will', 'least', 'not', 'think', 'sucks.Plot', 'open', 'Lai-sheung', 'Cheng', 'lt', '>', 'Contagion', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Josie', 'Ho', 'sneaking', 'building', 'security', 'room', 'offing', 'guard', 'jump', 'back', 'desk', 'working', 'phone', 'bank', 'trying', 'sell', 'stuff', 'time', 'shuffle', 'likely', 'confuse', 'well', 'film', 'read', 'something', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'doing', 'not', 'handled', 'well', 'movie', 'main', 'flaw', 'Lai-sheung', 'craved', 'apartment', 'Victoria', 'Harbor', 'ultra-swank', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'waterfront', 'apartment', 'building', 'two', 'jobs', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'alive', 'deeply', 'debt', 'trying', 'save', 'up', '800,000', ""'ll"", 'need', 'efficiency', 'When', 'one', 'open', 'chance', 'thanks', 'act-of-god', 'style', 'timing', 'mishap', 'appointment', 'sellers', 'tell', 'agent', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'offering', 'apartment', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'major', 'review', 'movie', 'press', 'packet', 'etc', 'had', ""n't"", 'all', 'spelled', 'out', 'Lai-sheung', 'snaps', 'breaks', 'building', 'killing', 'people', 'order', 'get', 'hands', 'apartment', 'real', 'estate', 'game', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'really', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'deadly.The', 'movie', 'first', 'Ho', 'production', 'company', '852', 'Films', 'came', 'out', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'said', 'basically', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'thinking', 'watched', 'are', 'two', 'halves', 'movie', 'gore', 'film', 'satire', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'real', 'estate', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'confusing', 'time-shifting', 'mentioned', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'little', 'better', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'movie', 'Once', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'things', 'come', 'together', 'movie', 'up', 'maybe', 'telling', 'what', 'going', 'outset', ""'ll"", 'have', 'made', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'first', 'half-hour-ish', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'would', '***']",Dream Home
