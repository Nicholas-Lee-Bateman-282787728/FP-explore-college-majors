1071735,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B000PKG694,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[1, 1]","`Partition' is a film easily missed.  A small budget Canadian production devoid of big names, `Partition` tells a tale of divided love set against the partition of the British Raj into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.  With its talented and fetching leads and inspired direction, `Partition' makes for an engrossing and moving film.Sikh soldier, Gian (Jimi Mistry) returns from fighting the Japanese disorientated and traumatized.  He makes his way back to his home village and attempts to put the killing behind him.  When a band of Muslim refugees is attacked outside his village, he shelters a young girl from the mayhem and murder.Gian`s `rescue' is soon discovered by his fellow villagers who demand her immediate expulsion.  In one of the film`s dramatic highlights, Gian bravely faces off the mob.  Thus saved, the Muslim girl, Naseem (Kristin Kreuk) helps Gian with the upkeep of his home and eventually ventures out into the village.  `Let them see their enemy,"" she states.Gradually, Gian and Naseem share more than household chores and an intimacy develops that is wonderfully shaped through Vic Sarin`s understated direction.`Partition`s' defining moment comes when Gian and Naseem, now happily married with a son, receive word that Naseem`s mother and two brothers survived the massacre and are living in Pakistan.  Naseem must make a difficult choice:  stay with Gian and son in India or visit her family with the risk she might never return to India.  Kristen Kreuk plays the scene perfectly with a complex mix of joy, sorrow, and trepidation.Naseem chooses to visit and thus makes a fateful decision for Gian and their son.  When Naseem is held captive by her brothers, Gian embarks on a fateful pilgrimage to save his love.While Naseem and Gian`s dilemma of family versus each other is hardly original, their story and its tragic conclusion remains powerful nevertheless.  This is in part due to the film`s impeccable pace and direction that captivate while never allowing d&eacute;j&agrave; vu to rear its ugly head.Furthermore, the story`s success is assisted most importantly with the two charismatic leads. Jimi Mistry gives Sikh Gian a silent, commanding, and very handsome presence.  Kreuk`s attractive and radiant Naseem makes for a perfect partner for Gian.  Moreover, Mistry`s Gian is struggling to accept his violent past.  With a Gandhi-like hunger for inner peace and external righteousness, Gian finds both in the innocence of Naseem.  `Naseem saved me,' he tells her family when they refuse to let her return.Finally, `Partition`s` cinematography is simply stunning.  With scenes shot both in Canada and India (where an actual village was constructed for the film), the film captures the color and radiance of India perfectly.  Along with a sumptuous score, the luscious camera work helps you focus on Gian and Naseem`s troubled yet transcendent love.Is `Partition' an Indian Romeo & Juliet?  Yes and no.  Instead of Montagues and Capulets you have Sikhs and Muslims trying to keep love from uniting their children.  Yet, something about Gian and Naseem`s love, while timeless and universal, felt virgin and untried as well.  If you are hungering for an under-the-radar love story, long on beauty and tragedy, then choose `Partition.'  You won`t be disappointed.",5,Divided love,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,3293,"['Partition', 'film', 'easily', 'missed', 'small', 'budget', 'Canadian', 'production', 'devoid', 'big', 'names', 'Partition', 'tale', 'divided', 'love', 'set', 'partition', 'British', 'Raj', 'Hindu', 'India', 'Muslim', 'Pakistan', 'talented', 'fetching', 'leads', 'inspired', 'direction', 'Partition', 'engrossing', 'moving', 'film.Sikh', 'soldier', 'Gian', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'fighting', 'Japanese', 'disorientated', 'traumatized', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'village', 'attempts', 'put', 'killing', 'When', 'band', 'Muslim', 'refugees', 'attacked', 'village', 'young', 'girl', 'mayhem', 'murder.Gian', 's', 'rescue', 'soon', 'discovered', 'fellow', 'villagers', 'who', 'demand', 'immediate', 'expulsion', 'one', 'film', 's', 'dramatic', 'highlights', 'Gian', 'bravely', 'off', 'mob', 'Thus', 'saved', 'Muslim', 'girl', 'Naseem', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Gian', 'upkeep', 'home', 'eventually', 'ventures', 'out', 'village', 'Let', 'see', 'enemy', 'states.Gradually', 'Gian', 'Naseem', 'share', 'more', 'household', 'chores', 'intimacy', 'wonderfully', 'shaped', 'Vic', 'Sarin', 's', 'understated', 'direction.', 'Partition', 's', 'defining', 'moment', 'when', 'Gian', 'Naseem', 'now', 'happily', 'married', 'son', 'receive', 'word', 'Naseem', 's', 'mother', 'two', 'brothers', 'survived', 'massacre', 'are', 'living', 'Pakistan', 'Naseem', 'must', 'make', 'difficult', 'choice', 'stay', 'Gian', 'son', 'India', 'visit', 'family', 'risk', 'might', 'never', 'return', 'India', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'complex', 'mix', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'trepidation.Naseem', 'chooses', 'visit', 'thus', 'fateful', 'decision', 'Gian', 'son', 'When', 'Naseem', 'held', 'captive', 'brothers', 'Gian', 'embarks', 'fateful', 'pilgrimage', 'save', 'love.While', 'Naseem', 'Gian', 's', 'dilemma', 'family', 'other', 'hardly', 'original', 'story', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'powerful', 'nevertheless', 'part', 'due', 'film', 's', 'impeccable', 'pace', 'direction', 'captivate', 'never', 'allowing', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head.Furthermore', 'story', 's', 'success', 'assisted', 'most', 'importantly', 'two', 'charismatic', 'leads', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'Sikh', 'Gian', 'silent', 'commanding', 'very', 'handsome', 'presence', 'Kreuk', 's', 'attractive', 'radiant', 'Naseem', 'perfect', 'partner', 'Gian', 'Moreover', 'Mistry', 's', 'Gian', 'struggling', 'accept', 'violent', 'past', 'Gandhi-like', 'hunger', 'inner', 'peace', 'external', 'righteousness', 'Gian', 'innocence', 'Naseem', 'Naseem', 'saved', 'family', 'when', 'refuse', 'let', 'return.Finally', 'Partition', 's', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Canada', 'India', 'where', 'actual', 'village', 'was', 'constructed', 'film', 'film', 'color', 'radiance', 'India', 'perfectly', 'sumptuous', 'score', 'luscious', 'camera', 'work', 'focus', 'Gian', 'Naseem', 's', 'troubled', 'yet', 'transcendent', 'love.Is', 'Partition', 'Indian', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Yes', 'Instead', 'Montagues', 'Capulets', 'have', 'Sikhs', 'Muslims', 'trying', 'keep', 'love', 'uniting', 'children', 'something', 'Gian', 'Naseem', 's', 'love', 'timeless', 'universal', 'felt', 'virgin', 'untried', 'well', 'are', 'hungering', 'under-the-radar', 'love', 'story', 'long', 'beauty', 'tragedy', 'then', 'choose', 'Partition', 'won', 't', 'be', 'disappointed']",Partition

It has been the subject of numerous books and movies, and is truly a tragic period in history.The movie here centers around Gian [Jimi Mistry], a Sikh who served in WWII, and who is haunted by memories of his friend Walter, who was a war casualty. Gian returns to India to find a nation torn apart by hostilities between Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs, and teetering on civil war [which eventually led to partition]. He returns to his little village in Punjab where his old battle comrade, Avtar [Irfan Khan, who played the role of the father in Namesake] leads a group of Sikh villagers to massacre Muslims on their way to migrating to Pakistan. Avtar justifies it as part of the 'war effort', but Gian wants no part in it.Things get more complicated when a Muslim girl, Naseem [played by Kristin Kreuk] escapes the massacre and is eventually found and sheltered by Gian, earning him the ire of the villagers. Gian and Naseem predictably end up being romantically entangled, but things are not all rosy for the pair. The rest of the story deals with the aftermath of Gian and Naseem's relationship amidst the turmoil of Partition.Though a lot of the plot seems a bit contrived and predictable, the main actors, esp Mistry's Gian and Kreuk's Naseem, do a credible job of fleshing out the characters. I was initially perturbed by the choice of Kreuk as a Muslim-Pakistani woman, but she pulls it off with aplomb, in fact is quite credible in her portrayal! She conveys scenes of raw emotion with great skill, as does Mistry.There are good supporting roles, esp the role of Avtar and also Neve Campbell as Margaret, a British citizen who aids Gian and Naseem.The movie is beautifully shot - the cinematography is breathtaking, esp of the Indian countryside, the period feel of the movie is well-portrayed by the sets, and the score is beguiling.Partition reminds me of a Hindi movie, Gadar, starring Sunny Deol as a Sikh who rescues a Muslim woman, played by Amisha Patel. The two movies have interesting parallels, but Partition benefits non-Hindi speaking audiences in that it is shot primarily in English, with a few smatterings of local dialect.On the whole, Partition is a well-made movie on a controversial and painful subject and though it is primarily a romance, the conflicts aroused by Partition are well-conveyed.
