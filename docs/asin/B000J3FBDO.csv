Well, I was pretty far off the mark! THE NIGHT LISTENER (based on a true story) isn't a very physical, or exhillerating movie. Instead, it is a movie that crawls under the skin with creeping dread. The story deals w/ the unpredictability of the mentally damaged. Robin Williams (ONE HOUR PHOTO, INSOMNIA) is his normal / abnormal stellar self as radio storyteller, Gabriel Noone who gets drawn into what he believes to be a close phone relationship w/ a horribly abused 14yo boy named Peter Logand. Of course, things are never quite as they appear to be. This time out, Williams gets to play the goodguy, plagued by Peter's caretaker, Donna (the incredible Toni Collette from The Dead Girl), who could be playing games w/ Noone, and just might be dangerous. Is Donna leading Gabriel along for some dark purpose? Worse, is she leading him deeper into her own insanity? I usually don't mention extras, but I recommend watching ""The Night Listener Revealed"" on this disc, as it explains a lot. Robin Williams actually gives the most chilling statement when he describes the real ""Donna"" making her presense known during the films production. Brrr!

1024318,A3CXLAWCNPH93G,B000J3FBDO,Blue Sky,"[0, 0]","I was really interested in watching The Night Listener because it looked like it would be a great thriller but it never really delivered.  There wasn't enough of getting to know the characters to really develop any kind of emotional connection.The film being based on a true story could have gone down much deeper, darker avenues to really hit home that all human beings are looking for love from each other in some way but some are so wounded and lonely that they will take those measures to the extreme to fulfill that emptiness.  In this day and age of dating websites and social networking, it's easy to get caught up with believing in something that may be one-sided and projecting one's own feelings onto another person one has never met or even spoken to in real life.Toni Collette gave a great  performance.  The desperation and creepiness she brought out in her character were believable.  Robin Williams was okay; he seems to be drawn to playing psychologically needy or off-kilter psychos these days.  I wish Rory Culkin would have been in the film more because his character could have been that bridge between the two main characters and their need to find some emotional truth in their lives.  To conjure up a fictional boy dying of AIDS to get attention and love is a very desperate act by any human being, and that premise could've opened up many, many dark insights into the the theme this movie tried to communicate.  Didn't care much for the use of the f-word so much....it cheapened the serious nature of the story in my opinion.I think that the deleted scene in the bonus features should have been included.

1024319,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000J3FBDO,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[13, 18]","Night Listener is a movie based on the true story of Anthony Godby Johnson and stars Robin Williams and Toni Collette in the main roles. Williams' Gabriel character develops a phone relationship with a young boy named Pete but eventually becomes suspicious that his ""friend"" may not exist because no one has ever seen him. He doesn't want to accept this but he starts to wonder if it really is true. His suspicions are deepened with another person tells Gabriel that a psychological disorder exists that explains this type of behavior. Gabriel is bound and determined to find closure to this mystery and he sets off to Wisconsin in seek of the truth.This sounds like the buildup to a great thriller/suspense film but the fact of the matter is The Night Listener doesn't quite deliver the amount of pulse- pumping, heart- thumping suspense action its premise suggests. There are a few creepy scenes in the film and some surprises. But the creepiness and the shock value never quite approach the level of a great suspense thriller. This isn't to say that Night Listener doesn't have its moments because there are a few. Toni Collette is responsible for most of the film's best and most memorable moments. Her Donna character is a blind woman; a little unstable and a little weird. You don't know exactly what she might do next and she is responsible for the few moments of suspense present in this film.Besides the suspense, there is a deeper message to this movie and it is one that becomes more obvious as the movie drags on. It is a message of wanting to gain attention and feel the strong ties of a relationship. The lengths that some people will go to fulfill this need are varied from person to person. But you see it happening in this film. Gabriel is dumped by Jess so he ends up seeking the attention of Pete and won't stop his search until he knows for sure whether or not Pete really exists. Donna has such a need for relationship fulfillment that she makes up another person and plays the parts of him and herself.The Night Listener is a slow, quiet film that never quite reaches the all- out terror that many viewers will be looking for. The slowness and relative calm do add a certain degree of suspense because you keep expecting something big to take place. But nothing major ever happens. The film just keeps plodding along until it finally reaches the end in mostly dissatisfying way.Toni Collette is the standout in this movie and Robin Williams is also quite good. Collette looks quite different from the glamorous star we all know and love. She is a little on the tattered side in this movie and those glaring eyes of hers are befitting of the character she plays. Robin Williams is also very good and convincing in his role as a man who wants to find out the truth even if it means breaking into Donna's home and searching every hospital in the city for this person named Pete.Overall, Night Listener is an okay film that will probably appeal to only about half of those who watch it. I would rate it 2.5 stars if I could because while I like the premise of the film and the performances, I am disappointed that director Patrick Stettner didn't do more with such an interesting true story. I will round my rating to three stars and give it a minor recommendation. It is worth a look if you're a fan of Toni Collette or Robin Williams and it will take up only 91 minutes of your day, making it worthy of watching just once.",3,In Search of a Friend Who May Not Exist,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,3442,"['Night', 'Listener', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Anthony', 'Godby', 'Johnson', 'stars', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'main', 'roles', 'Williams', 'Gabriel', 'character', 'phone', 'relationship', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Pete', 'eventually', 'suspicious', 'friend', 'may', 'not', 'exist', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', ""n't"", 'want', 'accept', 'wonder', 'really', 'true', 'suspicions', 'are', 'deepened', 'person', 'Gabriel', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'type', 'behavior', 'Gabriel', 'bound', 'determined', 'find', 'closure', 'mystery', 'Wisconsin', 'seek', 'truth.This', 'buildup', 'great', 'thriller/suspense', 'film', 'fact', 'matter', 'Night', 'Listener', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'amount', 'pulse-', 'pumping', 'heart-', 'thumping', 'suspense', 'action', 'premise', 'are', 'few', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'film', 'surprises', 'creepiness', 'shock', 'value', 'never', 'quite', 'approach', 'level', 'great', 'suspense', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'say', 'Night', 'Listener', ""n't"", 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'responsible', 'most', 'film', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Donna', 'character', 'blind', 'woman', 'little', 'unstable', 'little', 'weird', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'next', 'responsible', 'few', 'moments', 'suspense', 'present', 'suspense', 'deeper', 'message', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'obvious', 'movie', 'message', 'wanting', 'gain', 'attention', 'feel', 'strong', 'ties', 'relationship', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'fulfill', 'need', 'are', 'varied', 'person', 'person', 'see', 'happening', 'film', 'Gabriel', 'dumped', 'Jess', 'up', 'seeking', 'attention', 'Pete', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'search', 'sure', 'not', 'Pete', 'really', 'Donna', 'need', 'relationship', 'fulfillment', 'up', 'person', 'parts', 'herself.The', 'Night', 'Listener', 'slow', 'quiet', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'all-', 'out', 'terror', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'slowness', 'relative', 'calm', 'do', 'add', 'certain', 'degree', 'suspense', 'keep', 'expecting', 'something', 'big', 'take', 'place', 'nothing', 'major', 'ever', 'film', 'just', 'plodding', 'along', 'finally', 'end', 'mostly', 'dissatisfying', 'way.Toni', 'Collette', 'standout', 'movie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Collette', 'quite', 'different', 'glamorous', 'star', 'know', 'love', 'little', 'tattered', 'side', 'movie', 'glaring', 'eyes', 'hers', 'are', 'befitting', 'character', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'convincing', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'even', 'breaking', 'Donna', 'home', 'searching', 'hospital', 'city', 'person', 'named', 'Pete.Overall', 'Night', 'Listener', 'okay', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'appeal', 'only', 'half', 'who', 'watch', 'would', 'rate', '2.5', 'stars', 'could', 'like', 'premise', 'film', 'performances', 'am', 'disappointed', 'director', 'Patrick', 'Stettner', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'such', 'interesting', 'true', 'story', 'will', 'round', 'rating', 'three', 'stars', 'give', 'minor', 'recommendation', 'look', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'only', '91', 'minutes', 'day', 'making', 'worthy', 'watching', 'just', 'once']",N/A

1024323,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000J3FBDO,C. Middleton,"[0, 0]","There have been many criticisms of this unusual film - some warranted, others not so - though it is adeptly written, well thought-through, perfect atmosphere, excellent acting from the entire crew, including Mr. Williams as the broken hearted radio story teller and Toni Collette in the role as a social worker for a sick little boy. This is not a horror story with all the clich&eacute;d trimmings, but a true to form thriller including that required eeriness to pull off this kind of strange psychological tale.As the film unfolds there began a cold tingle at the back of my neck which instinctively told me there was something terribly sinister hovering just under the surface. In fact, the word sinister adequately describes the entire film.The plot itself is bizarre enough: publisher receives manuscript, a well-written manuscript from a 14 year old boy, and asks Noone (Williams) if he will take a look at it. At first reluctant, he reads the manuscript and becomes obsessed about the young author. Evidently the boy had been a victim of pornographic abuse, paedophilia and now is dying. A relationship ensues between Noone and the boy by way of the telephone.

1024325,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000J3FBDO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 6]","I have to admit I was a little disappointed by this movie.  I was expecting a tense, psychological thriller (Robin Williams has more than proved his ability to deliver along these lines before), but for whatever reason The Night Listener never truly captured my imagination.  I must disagree with those who designate the film as a horror movie - it's not scary, it's only marginally suspenseful, and its twists and turns don't really have any oomph to them.  In my opinion, it's a bit of a reach to even refer to The Night Listener as a psychological thriller.Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noone, a writer/radio personality who develops a friendship with a mysterious young man in Wisconsin.  It starts with a publishing friend giving him an advance copy of a book the young man has written - it's a harrowing tale about a childhood full of sexual abuse.  Now, at 14, young Pete Logand is living with the social worker who helped save him and facing a terminal fight against AIDS.  Gabriel soon begins talking to the boy and his caregiver on a daily basis.  It's a vulnerable time in his life, as Jess (Bobby Cannavale), his male companion of the past eight years, has moved out, espousing the need for some space of his own.  As it happens, though, Jess is actually the first person to express doubts about Pete's story.  Gabriel rejects the very idea out of hand, but developments ultimately lead him to ask his own questions about Pete and his caregiver Donna (Tini Collette).  Intent to get to the bottom of everything, he flies to Wisconsin to see Pete and Donna for himself.  What he finds there, though, are more questions than answers.Frankly, I never really cared whether Pete existed or not.  Robin Williams is good in the role of Gabriel, but I never connected with his character emotionally.  Without that connection, the suspenseful scenes just weren't that suspenseful.  Additionally, there's never really a climactic moment in the entire story.  All of our questions are answered by the very end, but those answers are presented in a somewhat clinical fashion.  My ultimate judgment is that The Night Listener is a good movie, but I just don't think it's capable of generating a lot of water cooler conversation.",3,A good movie that doesn't live up to its potential,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,2226,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'tense', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'more', 'proved', 'ability', 'deliver', 'lines', 'reason', 'Night', 'Listener', 'never', 'truly', 'captured', 'imagination', 'must', 'disagree', 'who', 'designate', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'only', 'marginally', 'suspenseful', 'twists', 'turns', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'oomph', 'opinion', 'bit', 'reach', 'even', 'refer', 'Night', 'Listener', 'psychological', 'thriller.Robin', 'Williams', 'Gabriel', 'Noone', 'writer/radio', 'personality', 'who', 'friendship', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'Wisconsin', 'publishing', 'friend', 'giving', 'advance', 'copy', 'book', 'young', 'man', 'written', 'harrowing', 'tale', 'childhood', 'full', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'Now', '14', 'young', 'Pete', 'Logand', 'living', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'helped', 'save', 'facing', 'terminal', 'fight', 'AIDS', 'Gabriel', 'soon', 'talking', 'boy', 'caregiver', 'daily', 'basis', 'vulnerable', 'time', 'life', 'Jess', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'male', 'companion', 'past', 'eight', 'years', 'moved', 'out', 'espousing', 'need', 'space', 'own', 'though', 'Jess', 'actually', 'first', 'person', 'express', 'doubts', 'Pete', 'story', 'Gabriel', 'very', 'idea', 'hand', 'developments', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'ask', 'own', 'questions', 'Pete', 'caregiver', 'Donna', 'Tini', 'Collette', 'Intent', 'get', 'bottom', 'everything', 'Wisconsin', 'see', 'Pete', 'Donna', 'What', 'there', 'are', 'more', 'questions', 'answers.Frankly', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'Pete', 'existed', 'not', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'good', 'role', 'Gabriel', 'never', 'connected', 'character', 'emotionally', 'connection', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'suspenseful', 'Additionally', 'never', 'really', 'climactic', 'moment', 'entire', 'story', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'very', 'end', 'answers', 'are', 'presented', 'somewhat', 'clinical', 'fashion', 'ultimate', 'judgment', 'Night', 'Listener', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'capable', 'generating', 'lot', 'water', 'cooler', 'conversation']",N/A

Wend,"[3, 4]","I have not read Armistead Maupin's book that The Night Listener was based upon or seen the trailers for the film; instead I read the description on the DVD box that included Roger Ebert's comment that this is a ""Hitchcockian thriller.""  I was looking forward to seeing the film since Robin Williams and Toni Colette are such excellent actors.  Sad to say, my wife and I found the film to be slow, if not boring, in starting and we did not find the movie all that mysterious, and after a while found the characters unsympathetic.A problem with the film is that you are plunged into the middle of a story.  Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams) is bleakly depressed: he is breaking up with a long-time partner (who is dying) because he uses the people around him as fodder for his own writing and he is unable to do his radio show, walking out on a recording session.  We do not have a lot of background on Noone and Jess but they keep meeting with acrimonious results that take away from the main thread of the story: who is this boy. Then, there is the book that publisher Joe Morton wants him to read supposedly written by a 14-year old that is literary dynamite (someone that the publishers had never met) about sexual abuse.  I found this implausible from the beginning since what publisher would want to print a book from an unknown author they never had met (nor could they meet due to his poor health).  Then, after agreeing to publish the book the publishing house refused to go ahead with the book.Robin Williams' performance was good but I found I did not care for him in the role, which was overwrought, consumed with anger and dialogue punctuated with an excess of foul language.  Toni Colette does her best in a role that is mildly sinister but we were not fooled by her character's blindness.  One does wonder why the people in the small Wisconsin town are so protective of her to the point where the police drive Noone to a deserted lake and zap him several times with a kind of stun gun.  There does not seem to be anything for anyone to hide or even protect, so what might be construed as something sinister falls flat.The story might have worked better if there the suggestion of a murder or kidnapping but there is no one to fear for just Toni Colette assuming a personality and there is nothing very creepy in her believing she is someone else.  I never felt that Noone was seriously threatened as he tried to find the boy and death is not lurching around the corner if he uncovered Colette's secret.  I cannot judge how well the film was adapted from Armistead Maupin's book but this appears a case where the adaptation has become muddled with the story suffering as a result: too much to say and not enough time to say it.",2,Not Much of a Mystery,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,2736,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Armistead', 'Maupin', 'book', 'Night', 'Listener', 'was', 'based', 'seen', 'trailers', 'film', 'instead', 'read', 'description', 'DVD', 'box', 'included', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'comment', 'Hitchcockian', 'thriller', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'are', 'such', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Sad', 'say', 'wife', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'slow', 'not', 'boring', 'starting', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'mysterious', 'while', 'found', 'characters', 'unsympathetic.A', 'problem', 'film', 'are', 'plunged', 'middle', 'story', 'Gabriel', 'Noone', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'bleakly', 'depressed', 'breaking', 'up', 'long-time', 'partner', 'who', 'dying', 'people', 'around', 'fodder', 'own', 'writing', 'unable', 'do', 'radio', 'show', 'walking', 'out', 'recording', 'session', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'background', 'Noone', 'Jess', 'keep', 'meeting', 'acrimonious', 'results', 'take', 'away', 'main', 'thread', 'story', 'who', 'boy', 'Then', 'book', 'publisher', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'read', 'supposedly', 'written', '14-year', 'old', 'literary', 'dynamite', 'someone', 'publishers', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'found', 'implausible', 'beginning', 'what', 'publisher', 'would', 'want', 'print', 'book', 'unknown', 'author', 'never', 'had', 'met', 'could', 'meet', 'due', 'poor', 'health', 'Then', 'agreeing', 'publish', 'book', 'publishing', 'house', 'refused', 'go', 'ahead', 'book.Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'was', 'good', 'found', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'role', 'was', 'overwrought', 'consumed', 'anger', 'dialogue', 'punctuated', 'excess', 'foul', 'language', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'best', 'role', 'mildly', 'sinister', 'were', 'not', 'fooled', 'character', 'blindness', 'One', 'wonder', 'why', 'people', 'small', 'Wisconsin', 'town', 'are', 'so', 'protective', 'point', 'where', 'police', 'drive', 'Noone', 'deserted', 'lake', 'several', 'times', 'kind', 'stun', 'gun', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'anything', 'anyone', 'hide', 'even', 'protect', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'construed', 'something', 'sinister', 'flat.The', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'suggestion', 'murder', 'kidnapping', 'one', 'fear', 'just', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'assuming', 'personality', 'nothing', 'very', 'creepy', 'believing', 'someone', 'else', 'never', 'felt', 'Noone', 'was', 'seriously', 'threatened', 'tried', 'find', 'boy', 'death', 'not', 'lurching', 'corner', 'uncovered', 'Colette', 'secret', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'Armistead', 'Maupin', 'book', 'case', 'where', 'adaptation', 'become', 'muddled', 'story', 'suffering', 'result', 'too', 'much', 'say', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'say']",N/A

As more and more evidence begins to unfold pointing to the woman as being very unbalanced and ""making up"" the existance of the boy to garner sympathy, Williams' character is at first in angry denial.

In brief, Robin Williams plays New York DJ Gabriel Noone (&#34;no one&#34;, get it?), a gay, washed-up radio personality who starts getting calls from a fan in Wisconsin: an adolescent boy (Rory Culkin). This boy, who is questioning his own sexuality, seems to become more and more obsessed with Noone. Noone is affected by the apparent plight of this kid, and agrees to try to meet him.Noone arrives in Wisconsin and is confronted by Donna Logand (Toni Collette) - a very crazy blind woman, who claims to be the boy's adopted mother. The question right off the bat is, how crazy is she, and is she really blind? She leads Noone around by the nose. Where is her son? - Noone was supposed to meet him. Oh, he's in the hospital, he's very ill, could he give her a ride? - and round and round it all goes.Soon Noone is haunted by two possibilities: this crazy woman has no true relationship to the boy, has him imprisoned somewhere, or worse, there is no boy. Soon the unfortunate Noone will find himself investigating and getting pounded by the cops in the process. He will also come close to losing his life due to the dependent clutches in which Vicki places him.I have to say, I was deeply angered because there is a boy in the beginning of the film (played by Rory Culkin). He does make the calls to Noone's radio show, he sounds real enough - but by the 30-minute mark, this kid sounds like Toni Collette and it is obvious she is speaking, not Rory Culkin. After the initial &#34;bait&#34; is set for poor Noone, the boy vanishes. Was any boy ever there, on the phone, at all?The ending is as stupid as the beginning. Somehow the crazy woman has convinced everyone else that her son has been kidnapped ... and she makes it look like Noone did it. She manages to paint him as a weirdo who has the boy hidden someplace. The whole town thinks, well, maybe he could be the bad guy, but Noone himself investigates. That is when Noone gets everyone to admit that they have never actually seen this boy.The circular story is too goofy to be drunk in, too unintentionally funny to work on any level. The casting of Williams is one of his bigger casting errors, because he lends a humorous air to whatever he does (witness ONE HOUR PHOTO, AUGUST RUSH or the Canadian disaster THE FINAL CUT). But Williams managed to make some sort of weak impression here. It seemed to me this role was made for George Clooney - ah well.Written by Armistead Maupin and based on his novel, directed by small-fry Patrick Stettner, this thing is a 100% JUST-GIVE-IT-A-MISS unless you're hardcore for Maupin, Williams, Collette or anything remotely gay-related. However, you must read for yourself the allegedly true story behind this mess, which I gleaned from a Hollyweird website:&#34; ... in 1993 Maupin was sent the galleys of a book by a publisher in New York, written by a 14-year-old boy who was dying of AIDS and had suffered abuse at the hands of his parents, who had been in sort of a pedophile ring, and he had been rescued by a social worker. [Maupin] was asked to write a blurb. [At the beginning of the film there's that line, uttered to Noone by his boyfriend: 'Don't worry. You won't have to write a blurb.']&#34;That book was Rock and a Hard Place: One Boy's Triumphant Story, the poignant, horrific and supposedly true memoir of one Anthony Godby Johnson. The book came with a forward from Los Angeles author Paul Monette, another renowned essayist on gay relationships and a friend of Maupin's ... Monette had been contacted by [this boy], and was coaxed into providing the forward .... Maupin said the story 'came with pretty impeccable credentials.'&#34;As a result both Paul Monette and Fred Rogers had established ... long-distance relationships with the terminally ill ... boy, who lived with an adoptive guardian in Union City, New Jersey, in a highly secretive arrangement for fear that his abusive parents or their sick sexual circle might hunt him down. Maupin was thunderstruck by Tony Johnson's story, and immediately provided a cover blurb, but found himself wanting to do more.&#34;With Tony's 'adoptive mother' Vicki Fraginals serving as go-between, Maupin and the boy developed a deep connection through their frequent phone conversations ... though Tony was always too sick for a one-on-one meeting. Maupin was blissfully ignorant that there might be something entirely more outlandish going on until one fateful telephone call. &#34;-thanks to the site, which I cannot reveal on Amazon.So, that fateful day, Maupin's boyfriend took a call from the boy's adopted mother Vicki. After ten minutes, Maupin's boyfriend concluded that it was the exact same voice as the boy's. He chided Maupin for not having noticed it before. Maupin decided to play along for SIX YEARS, all the while fighting internally about whether this boy was a real person or not.Maupin learned through an expos&eacute; by &#34;The New Yorker&#34; magazine that there was no boy - all the voiceprints of Tony and those of Vicki were those of one woman. But the &#34;boy&#34; - by phone, of course - even appeared with Maupin on an episode of &#34;Oprah Winfrey&#34; about abused children.The woman, Vicki, suffers from what is known as &#34;Factitious Disorder&#34;, a compulsive lying in which the sufferer pretends to be ill, or pretends a relative is ill. In this event, Vicki suffered an extreme form of FD in which she first invented a 'son' and then said he was ill.Maupin published his fact-based &#34;The Night Listener&#34; in 2000, after a legal threat from Vicki  ... and it was the last time Maupin spoke with her (or her fake son). When the film was in production, Toni Collette nixed the idea of talking with Vicki, which had been proposed to her.Sadly, Collette presents the Vicki-character as potentially violent and psychopathic. It doesn't seem the real Vicki was as bad as all that. Who knows, and who cares? Maupin himself says that to this day, people believe in the boy &#34;Tony&#34;, in his existence, and there are even those who speak to or email &#34;Tony&#34; regularly. &#34;Tony&#34;, of course, is Vicki and she is still conning people, apparently.Robin Williams judged the real-life Vicki to be a sort of &#34;extreme voyeur&#34;. &#34;Munchausen by ventriloquism&#34; is what Williams called Vicki's little game. Both Williams and Toni Collette received chilling fan letters from Vicki when the film was being made. She asked Collette to do her justice in the film.The trouble I had with this all along is: how true is any of this? I realize &#34;The New Yorker&#34; exposed Vicki, but ... how devious is Maupin? Did HE create it all, in order to get work? Did he need to, or did Monette? Why did Fred Rogers - yes, THE &#34;Mr. Rogers&#34; - write the Afterward to Tony's fake memoires, while Monette wrote the Foreword?In the end, both book and film will convince you that truth is not a commodity: it is an obligation. But you don't need this dreadful film (or the rotten novel behind it) in order to learn that lesson.",2,"""Listen for the truth ...

1024335,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000J3FBDO,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Armistead Maupin's novel THE NIGHT LISTENER is a terrifyingly disturbing examination of a disintegrating mind and the manner in which such a mind deals with needs and reality.  It is a stunning work, one in which the reader is never quite sure where reality stops and delusions start.  Though Maupin co-wrote the screenplay adaptation with Terry Anderson and Director Patrick Stettner, some of the inherent magic of the story is lost in translation when the camera makes the novel visual.Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams in a fine, understated serious performance), a writer who reads the 'fiction of his life' on a late night talk show, is having a writer's block, due in part to his devastation of losing his AIDS ridden but stabilized lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale), having nursed him for years but now feeling discarded so that Jess can feel life again.  A literary agent Ashe (Joe Morton) asks Gabriel to read a galley of a book written by a 14 year old boy Pete Logand ('Rory Culkin') who is describing his years of sexual abuse as a child and his current coping with AIDS in Wisconsin and is under the faster care of a social worker Donna (Toni Collette, once again proving there is no role she can't master!).  Gabriel reads the book galley, and is fascinated by a story about a life that makes his own situation seem minor.  He receives a call from Pete and subsequent calls from Donna and when he shares the story and events with Jess he is warned of a possible fraud.  Does Pete really exist? It seems Gabriel needs to discover the truth and heads to Wisconsin where he meets the blind Donna but is unable to get in to see Pete.  Where the story goes form there is important to leave unsaid, as the mystery must be kept intact for the individual viewer.Each of the cast turns in credible performances, not an easy feat when the line between illusion/delusion/reality is so tenuous.  One character has been added - Anna (the always superb Sandra Oh) - and it is her analysis of the facts that holds much of the storyline together.  The mood of the piece is perfectly captured by cinematographer Lisa Rinzler and music writer Peter Nashel.  But credit director Patrick Stettner for pulling performances form Williams, Collette, Cannavale and Oh that represent some of their finest work on film.

1024339,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000J3FBDO,James Morris,"[5, 7]","I am not the biggest Amistead Maupin fan.  I enjoyed his first two Tales of the City books quite a bit, but the later entries in the series were just too surreal.  After a while, I found his quirky characters and far-fetched situations more annoying than amusing, although I don't begrudge him his enormous following, or feel he doesn't deserve to be read.  But I have not sought his fiction out since the third or fourth ""City"" book tried my patience over a dozen years ago.And so, I did not read the ""semi-autobiographical"" novel that this film was based on, but I figured that I had enough respect for Maupin and the creators and cast to expect that I would enjoy it anyway, so I plunked down the purchase price of the DVD.  I then went home to relax into an evening of mystery and suspense.What a disappointment!  For some reason, the usually competent Robin Williams just didn't convince me that he was a gay man, a writer or a radio celebrity.  And although I found the character of Donna to be as creepy and weird as other reviewers have suggested, there wasn't a moment of genuine suspense (well, maybe one) in the whole film, and when it was over, I felt very definitely cheated.  I don't doubt that there are some sick, twisted people out there who will pretty much do anything to stroke their own egos or grab some attention, but the villain in this piece was not particularly shocking, or for that matter, very interesting.Maybe I have just seen one too many films that were touted as ""taut psychological thrillers"".  Maybe I have had my fill of suspense films with the word ""Night"" in the title.  Maybe the old ""two thumbs up"" is a bit overused, since this is not the first film so labeled that seemed to offer mediocrity instead of excellence.  Or maybe, as some others have suggested, the film lets out too many details too soon to leave much room for any real mystery.  Who knows?  The story did manage to keep my interest until the last five minutes or so, but when I discovered that there wasn't as much to it as I expected, and the ending held no real surprise at all, I decided it was a bigger waste of time than I ever could have anticipated from the mostly excellent reviews.Toni Collette and Joe Morton were outstanding as always, but shortly after I finished watching, I found I had practically forgotten the whole thing.",3,A Near Miss,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,2345,"['am', 'not', 'biggest', 'Amistead', 'Maupin', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'Tales', 'City', 'books', 'quite', 'bit', 'later', 'entries', 'series', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'surreal', 'while', 'found', 'quirky', 'characters', 'far-fetched', 'situations', 'more', 'annoying', 'amusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'enormous', 'following', 'feel', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'read', 'have', 'not', 'sought', 'fiction', 'third', 'fourth', 'City', 'book', 'tried', 'patience', 'dozen', 'years', 'ago.And', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'figured', 'had', 'enough', 'respect', 'Maupin', 'creators', 'cast', 'expect', 'would', 'enjoy', 'anyway', 'plunked', 'down', 'purchase', 'price', 'DVD', 'then', 'went', 'home', 'relax', 'evening', 'mystery', 'suspense.What', 'disappointment', 'reason', 'usually', 'competent', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'was', 'gay', 'man', 'writer', 'radio', 'celebrity', 'found', 'character', 'Donna', 'be', 'creepy', 'weird', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'suggested', 'was', ""n't"", 'moment', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'well', 'maybe', 'one', 'whole', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'felt', 'very', 'definitely', 'cheated', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'are', 'sick', 'twisted', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'anything', 'stroke', 'own', 'egos', 'grab', 'attention', 'villain', 'piece', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'shocking', 'matter', 'very', 'interesting.Maybe', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'were', 'touted', 'taut', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'Maybe', 'have', 'had', 'fill', 'suspense', 'films', 'word', 'Night', 'title', 'Maybe', 'old', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'bit', 'overused', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'labeled', 'seemed', 'offer', 'mediocrity', 'instead', 'excellence', 'maybe', 'others', 'have', 'suggested', 'film', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'too', 'soon', 'leave', 'much', 'room', 'real', 'mystery', 'Who', 'story', 'did', 'manage', 'keep', 'interest', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'discovered', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'expected', 'ending', 'held', 'real', 'surprise', 'decided', 'was', 'bigger', 'waste', 'time', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'anticipated', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'reviews.Toni', 'Collette', 'Joe', 'Morton', 'were', 'outstanding', 'always', 'shortly', 'finished', 'watching', 'found', 'had', 'practically', 'forgotten', 'whole', 'thing']",N/A

When we see him, the boy is whittling away his final days communicating with the radio host and using him as a sort of support group.  Ironically, the radio host uses the boy as a sort of support group as well as he is suffering through realtionship troubles himself.The boy resides with a foster parent who also communicates with the radio host and shares the radio host's great sympathy for the young boy's plight.  After a short time the validity of the boy's story comes in to question to the point where his actual existence is even doubted.The Night Listener has potential but is lazily directed.  With a surprisingly brief 80 minute run time, The Night Listener never really achieves a dramatic arc.  Rather it plods along with the faint promise that danger may lurk ahead.  Yet when all is revealed, the truth is anti-climactic to say the least.  It's a journey that leaves you feeling as if it should have led you someplace more worthwhile.

After listening to all the different possibilities casually considered and more or less mocked, it leaves the viewer wondering, ""Well, if it's not any of those things, what could it be?""  Who would have thought the ending of the movie would be given away at the beginning?Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams) is a writer who hosts a radio show called ""Noone at Night,"" an hour-long show in which he reads some of his own fiction.  He gets a hold of manuscript written by one of his fans, a 14-year-old boy whose novel details years of sexual abuse.  Noone, desperate to find love in any form, quickly develops an over-the-phone, almost paternal relationship with the boy. He learns that the young author has AIDS (apparently a result of the abuse) and might not have long to live.  Noone even considers going to meet the boy and his adoptive mother in Wisconsin, but then things take a strange turn when someone makes a disturbing observation after hearing a message from the boy on Noone's answering machine.""The Night Listener"" starts out with a strange vibe, and it only gets eerier as Noone gets closer to the truth.  The atmosphere and mood often feel like something out of a Twilight Zone episode.  It feels like it could go anywhere, and because of it, the ride is often enjoyable.  Right up until the very end, the tension and weirdness builds, but once the mystery is revealed, it proves to be all too probable and reality-based.""The Night Listener"" is adapted for the screen by Armistead Maupin, based on his own novel which was based on real-life events he experienced.  Maupin exploits the creepiness of the situation to full effect and manages to find some meaning in it, but it ends up almost sticking too close to the truth.

Plus, it's been far too long since Toni Collette got to take the leading part in a movie and she probably could have handled the domestic part as well, although the relationship she would have been in with Bobby Cannavale (a younger man whose AIDS diagnosis had, until very recently, doomed him to a death sentence, and now he wants a new taste of freedom away from Toni Collette) would have been a straight relationship--but still poignant, and possibly more poignant than it is right now.

What's that supposed to tell us?  Isn't Pete supposed to live in the house too?  Does he recognize all the letters because he wrote them all?  Or are they all from different famous people whom Peter has reached out to, just like the real JT LeRoy?

You can't help but read it and think of JT LeRoy.  I kept looking at that name ""Peter Logand"" and thinking it must be sort of an anagram (like Gabriel ""Noone"" was a shorthand for ""No One."")

This story, which can be very difficult to display, has a very compelling story line to it which is mostly left out. It's like they took just a slice of life and left off the part that truly explains what happened to a pivotal character to behave the way she does.Toni Colette's character is by far the driving force in this story. And yet they don't delve deep enough to show what brought her to do what she is doing to Robin Williams' character.Although the real-life events that are behind this are probably there in some way, they didn't take the time to probe any further than that. There are reasons why people end up in the psychological realms that they do. And although they may not know why in this instance, they didn't try to suppose either.Bringing a story of this nature to view is difficult at best because most of the 'action' happens inside the character's head so I'm sure they had enough to do in adapting what they did. However, as Ms Collette's charater states in the film... your story has no ending.Indeed, it may not. But there should be an explanation.Kudo's to each and every one of the actors in this movie... they all played great. Exceptional performance by Ms Collette.

1024348,A202FGBQHO5638,B000J3FBDO,L. Alper,"[11, 14]","Armistead Maupin's novel, The Night Listener, was a departure from his usual light hearted looks at metrosexuals. The roman-a-clef was based on an episode in Maupin's own life that coincided with the break up of his relationship with Terry Anderson. During this period, Maupin became involved in a phone relationship with what he thought was a 14 year old boy who was dying of AID's & the boy's care-giver, Donna. Eventually doubts were raised about whether the boy actually existed or was Donna herself.The novel tells its story primarily through conversation, on the telephone & between Gabriel Noone (Maupin's alter-ego) & his ex, his publisher, and his personal assistant. This works in a novel, but can be hard to translate to a visual medium due to its lack of action. The film of The Night Listener does not succeed in crossing over, possibly due to the fact that Maupin & ex-partner Anderson wrote the screenplay. The film doesn't work in many places, mostly due to adhering too closely to the book.One of the biggest problems with the film is that it is dark. Not just emotionally dark, but filmed with so little light in many interior scenes that it is difficult to tell where the action is taking place. Although the film is supposed to be a `thriller of the heart', the darkness does nothing to add to a sense of tension.Another set of problems are related to the screenplay: first, that the initial build up of the relationship between Noone and the boy Pete isn't shown. The viewer sees 2 phone calls and immediately Noone becomes obsessed with Pete Logan. In this case the film would benefit from a more gradual arc. Secondly, the scene with Gabriel Noone & his father, played by Northern Exposure's John Collum. In the novel, Noone's relationship with his father is a subtext that partly explains his attachment to the boy Pete. In the film, the lone scene comes out of nowhere & goes nowhere. The few minutes spent on it would be better used in the early period of Noone's & Pete's phone conversations.In trying to create more of a standard thriller, Donna Logan has morphed from being a friendly, sensible, no-nonsense person whose conversations Noone enjoys into a blatantly disturbed woman in the film. It's a bit difficult to tell if the characterization was written this way for the screenplay or if Toni Collette made the choice to portray Donna as a twitchy nutcase. The ultimate blame lies with the director for allowing clich&eacute;s to trump subtlety.But the biggest problem with The Night Listener is Robin Williams. As Gabriel Noone, he is literally in every scene of the film. Williams has turned down the level of his energy to such a degree that he appears to be sedated throughout the entire film. He mumbles his lines, sits in the dark looking depressed, and rarely holds either the attention or the sympathy of the viewer. Although in the throes of a break-up that was entirely unexpected, the viewers' sympathies lie with the ex-boyfriend. There is simply nothing lovable or particularly attractive about Gabriel Noone as embodied by Robin Williams. A flash of humor, a twinkle in the eye, a little energy, all would have gone a long way towards engaging the interest of the audience.So, does The Night Listener succeed on any level? No, not really. The book is hardly a classic, but the film is entirely disposable.

Thank goodness there are no scary monsters, no over-the-top scary music that keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat, and no excessive violence or gun fights...... Just good old fashion story telling in the form of a psychological thriller.Robin Williams does a wonderful job, as usual, portraying the lead character, radio personality, Gabriel Noone. Noone is going through a difficult break-up with his partner, when he is given a pre-released copy of a book from a friend that is about to be published by a boy with AIDS who was physically abused/sexually molested by his parents. Noone and this boy form a unique, long distance friendship over the phone and via mail.It isn't until Noone's ex-boyfriend suggests after he hears both the voice of the boy and that of his newly adoptive mother, that they are one in the same person. Noone denies this suggestion, but decides to investigate his ex-boyfriend's allegations, if nothing more than to prove his ex-boyfriend's allegations wrong! As Noone begins investigating the situation, this is where the storyline picks up the pace as you are left wondering if the adoptive mother and this boy are one in the same and if so why?

1024352,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B000J3FBDO,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[2, 5]","Both of these films--The Night Listener and He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not--are ""thrillers of the heart"" based on unusual psychological disorders which, in the course of normal life, one does not typically run across. AND both of these films are based on real-life events--i.e., inspired by real people who had/have these disorders who engaged in the behavior(s) depicted in the films.I think it's worth seeing both films to get a fascinating perspective on how some people can seriously delude themselves into thinking/feeling that others really love them when that is clearly not the case. Without giving anything away here, it's riveting to see some excellent actors--Robin Williams and Toni Colette, in particular in The Night Listener, and Audrey Tatou in He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not--dramatize and personalize the emotional complexities these real people deal with on a daily basis in their lives.In The Night Listener, the complexity is found in the relationship between three people--a well-known author (Robin Williams standing in for real-life writer Armistead Maupin), a social worker (Toni Colette) and a 14-year old boy (Rory Culkin) whom Colette's character has adopted because of severe emotional trauma the boy suffered when very young.The device of an actor playing a real writer who then introduces a real-life case the real writer used as the basis for his real novel (of the same name as the film) is done simply, effortlessly--and easily brings the viewer into the story of the film itself which is gripping from beginning to end.One of the key reasons this film works so well is that the filmmakers (writers Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson--his former partner, and director Patrick Stettner) parallel the writer's own breakup with his partner with the writer's ongoing pursuit of the real nature of the relationship between the social worker and the 14-year old boy. What does the search for real love do to us as people? How does it change us? How does it disappoint us and make us feel things we don't want to feel?Ever-present doubt drives this film, providing a momentum that carries us straight through to the fascinating ending. This is an excellent example of a psychological thriller that does not need to rely on physical violence to make us not only sit up and take notice, but really feel something in our gut.Very highly recommended.",4,"A companion piece to He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not",1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,2370,"['films', 'Night', 'Listener', 'Me', 'Me', 'Not', 'are', 'thrillers', 'heart', 'based', 'unusual', 'psychological', 'disorders', 'course', 'normal', 'life', 'one', 'not', 'typically', 'run', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'real-life', 'events', 'i.e.', 'inspired', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'had/have', 'disorders', 'who', 'engaged', 'behavior', 'depicted', 'films.I', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'films', 'get', 'fascinating', 'perspective', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'seriously', 'delude', 'thinking/feeling', 'others', 'really', 'love', 'when', 'clearly', 'not', 'case', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'here', 'riveting', 'see', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'particular', 'Night', 'Listener', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'Me', 'Me', 'Not', 'dramatize', 'personalize', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'real', 'people', 'deal', 'daily', 'basis', 'lives.In', 'Night', 'Listener', 'complexity', 'found', 'relationship', 'three', 'people', 'well-known', 'author', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'standing', 'real-life', 'writer', 'Armistead', 'Maupin', 'social', 'worker', 'Toni', 'Colette', '14-year', 'old', 'boy', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'whom', 'Colette', 'character', 'adopted', 'severe', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'boy', 'suffered', 'when', 'very', 'young.The', 'device', 'actor', 'playing', 'real', 'writer', 'who', 'then', 'real-life', 'case', 'real', 'writer', 'used', 'basis', 'real', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'done', 'simply', 'effortlessly', 'easily', 'viewer', 'story', 'film', 'gripping', 'beginning', 'end.One', 'key', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'writers', 'Armistead', 'Maupin', 'Terry', 'Anderson', 'former', 'partner', 'director', 'Patrick', 'Stettner', 'parallel', 'writer', 'own', 'breakup', 'partner', 'writer', 'ongoing', 'pursuit', 'real', 'nature', 'relationship', 'social', 'worker', '14-year', 'old', 'boy', 'What', 'search', 'real', 'love', 'do', 'people', 'How', 'change', 'How', 'disappoint', 'make', 'feel', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'Ever-present', 'doubt', 'film', 'providing', 'momentum', 'straight', 'fascinating', 'ending', 'excellent', 'example', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'not', 'need', 'rely', 'physical', 'violence', 'make', 'not', 'only', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'really', 'feel', 'something', 'gut.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1024353,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000J3FBDO,Linda Linguvic,"[9, 14]","About five years ago I read this book. I loved it.  Armistead Maupin is a fine writer and I considered this book an intriguing journey of angst and self discovery.  Naturally, I wanted to see the film.I sure was disappointed.  The tone of suspense and creepiness that the book had was gone.  Instead, all I felt was impatience as the film very slowly told the story of an aging late-night radio storyteller, played by Robin Williams, who is going through the end of a relationship.  His live-in young gay lover who has AIDS has a new lease on life due to new medications and, after eight years of living together, is moving out.  The actors play their parts well and I could feel the pain of this breakup.But then Williams gets a new lease on life.  He is given an unpublished non-fiction book to review, and the story of a young boy with AIDS who had been sexually abused in his early childhood, is one that moves his heart.  Soon, he is speaking by telephone with the young boy and his caretaker, a woman named Donna, played by Toni Collette.  She is supposedly a social worker who has rescued the boy and is nursing him in her home in Wisconsin.  However, there is something about the whole story that doesn't seem quite right.This causes Williams to travel to Wisconsin from his home in New York City.  This is where the lines between reality and illusion become blurred.  There are surprises here that play like a horror film.  And yet, there are no real conclusions.  This is what makes the story weak.  I wanted it to be tied up all neatly and answers given.  That didn't happen.  And while I could accept this in a book because of the fine writing, I hated it in the film.And so, in spite of good acting, the screenplay just didn't work for me.  I was bored most of the time and couldn't wait for it to end.  And so, unless, like I was, you are a fan of the writer and are curious as to how this adaptation works, I cannot recommend this film.",3,The book doesn't adapt well to the screen.

This is the best movie I have seen Robin Williams in in a long time.Gabriel Noone (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and alte-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). When troubling questions arise about the boy's identity, however, Noone finds himself drawn intoa widening mystery that hides a deadly secret!There are some disturbing sexual scenes in this movie that relate to the young listener.

This is, at least, partly understandable, as to blurt out the synopsis is to give away the whole of the movie.Suffice it to say this is about a series of letters and conversations between a self-important and opportunistic (and shallow) radio personality (played aptly by Robin Williams) and what appears to be a 14 year old abused boy who happens to be a fan.  That all may not be exactly as it appears is a great understatement.There is hardly a beat missed in this film, and the actors and action and sequences are all first-rate and maybe a little too convincing for my comfort.  (That the film has this affect is tribute to the skill of these film-makers.)  Although it seems that truth is, in fact, stranger than fiction, this film chronicles the best and worst in humanity and how the worst and most opportunistic can feed off the best intentions of others.This film is foremost about the Robin Williams character, playing a composite character, principally, of Armisted Maupin.  As much as this is the case, the psychosis of other characters is not examined very closely.  If you are unsatisfied with the ending, you can watch a great extra on the DVD that gives you some insight into the story and the characters and offers a few suggestions on the motivation of some of them.

If I were a movie expert perhaps I would be better able to explain what exactly was missing from this film, but as a lay person I just felt like it didn't live up to its potential, despite the interesting plot and wonderful acting.

He works hard here, but it's a safe bet many other actors would have been more successful in this role.  On the other hand, the always-impressive Toni Collette adds another indelible portrait to her gallery of screen women; eerie and frightening, she's like some creature hauled, gasping and blinking, from a subterranean lake.

1024366,A387BD735MI50R,B000J3FBDO,R. Schultz,"[1, 4]","This is a gripping drama with shadows of a psycho-like dementia lurking in its corners. But unlike the gothic surrealism of ""Psycho,"" this is a more realistic drama that focuses on what might be a disturbed person's obsessive need to create an alter-ego. However we don't know for sure, until the very end of the movie, whether Robin Williams has been talking with two people - or only one dangerously schismed individual.However there are at least two ways in which you might find this movie a bit unsatisfying. First of all, there isn't enough conversation between Robin Williams and his young phone-friend to establish sufficient reason for William's attachment to the youth. Everything is too compressed. We see Williams reading the boy's autobiography, apparently a gruesome tale of childhood abuse. Then we see Williams chatting with the boy a few times on the phone. During these brief exchanges, the boy almost goes out of his way to be insulting and vulgar about the older man's homosexuality. Certainly nothing endearing about the boy comes across here.The real-life experience on which this movie is based was very different. Author Armistead Maupin kept up a phone friendship with a presumably very ill young man for years before he even began to question whether this doomed, delicate boy actually existed. In interviews he's given about the genesis of this movie, Maupin said that what kept him on the phone so much was the boy's brightness and heart. He said he actually wouldn't have cared if his night talker/listener had been a boy, or in fact a middle-aged woman. (Well, I can't help but think that might be a slight overstatement.) But in any case, the movie should have taken a little more time to let the long-distance rapport develop. Viewers need to understand why Williams' character would have taken such risks, venturing into such eerie byways in order to establish the truth about this boy. A few breezy phone calls and an autobiography don't seem enough to compel anyone down such dark roads.And talk about dark roads! The other thing you might find a little unsatisfying about this movie is its persistently murky lighting. Some thrillers maintain gloom as a way of covering up their essential lack of any suspense. But this movie has plenty of inherent suspense. It doesn't need to rely on virtual screen blackouts or on smudgy, dim ember glow to create effect. A little light on the subject wouldn't have detracted from the mood.But these are minor quibbles.

After a ten-year relationship, his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale), decides to move out, as his ill-health caused by HIV has taken a turn for the better, making him no longer dependent.Though he tries to hide his devastation, Noone's vulnerability comes to light when a book publisher hands him a copy of an autobiography by a young boy named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin).Detailing routine sexual and psychological abuse suffered at the hands of many adults, most shockingly his own parents, the novel deeply affects Noone, not only because Pete is dying of AIDS, but because listening to Noone's program is his only source of comfort.The duo soon becomes intimate after Noone phones him, sharing stories and observations for hours at a time, with Pete's caregiver Donna (Toni Collette), close at hand.However, when Jess listens to the voices of both Donna and Pete on Noone's answering machine, he is convinced that they are both the same person.Noone lashes out at him, but soon finds reason for suspicion with the help of Anna (Sandra Oh), and decides to pay an unexpected visit to their remote Wisconsin residence.What ensues is pure edge of the seat tension. Williams, who tends to apt for a cliched scruffy look whenever he does a serious role, is enrapturing.His portrayal of a man in pursuit of validating a likely fictional emotional bond is so moving that the bizarre actions Noone takes (breaking into a house, peeping into hospital rooms) are not entirely unfathomable.Still, the best reason to see ""The Night Listener"" is Collette, who is startlingly creepy yet alternately sympathetic as Donna, a troubled, mentally bankrupt figure who shifts personalities and personas in mere instants. That she did not receive an Oscar nomination can only be owed to the little attention the film received.The crux of ""The Night Listener"" is best summed by Noone as he is about to recount his experience to his listeners: ""As a storyteller, I've spent years looting my life for fiction. Like a magpie, I tend to steal the shiny stuff and discard the rest.""In the end, I'm not sure what really happened. But it is clear that Donna and I are more alike than not.

Robin Williams stars as Gabriel Noone, a broadcasting doppelganger for bookwriter Maupin, who is given a horrific book by a 14 year old boy who claims he was sexually abused and exploited and is also an admirer of Noone's radio show. Noone and the boy, Peter, become phone and pen pals, but Noone's partner soon suspects that there is no Peter, and the social worker claiming to care for the boy is faking the story for attention.Apparently that was where the real life situation with Maupin ended and the novel began. Noone is soon sucked into a deceitful web of promises, voices and broken appointments. He finally forces himself to fly from NYC to Wisconsin to learn the truth for himself. The movie gets a bonus star from Toni Collete, who plays the social worker with a creepy vulnerability, making the question of Peter's existence all the tougher to determine.While all the actors are great in their roles (including Sandra Oh as Gabriel's book keeper), the movie drags.

This film is no exception but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. It is very engrossing and keeps you guessing all the way through. It's based on a true story. Robin Williams' understated performance was just right for the character of Gabriel Noone, a gay radio personality who becomes involved over the phone with people he is not sure exist. Toni Collette is excellent in her role too. The directing is unobtrusive and gladly features no MTV-style camera trickery like oversaturated color or other visual gimmicks that so many other movies use these days. The story is mysterious and surprisingly very emotional. My only criticism is that the movie should have been longer than 82 minutes.I read the book after seeing it and it was great---a real page turner with a lot of heart, but also quite sad. The movie could have included a lot more of the story. The screenplay was co-written by Armistead Maupin, the author of the book, so its hard to understand why it was so truncated. However, the content left out was largely about the character's gayness and family life. Perhaps they thought it would be more acceptable to the general public this way, but it lacks the depth of character you get from the book. My recommendation is to see this film and if you like it, read the book afterward. You will enjoy both that way, but if you have read the book already, you might be disappointed in the film. Still, it is worth seeing for yet another excellent performance by Robin, who seems to have shed his comic persona for more serious and substantial roles, with great success.",4,keeps you in suspense,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,1671,"['books', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'better', 'movies', 'made', 'films', 'mostly', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'film', 'exception', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'engrossing', 'guessing', 'way', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'understated', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'character', 'Gabriel', 'Noone', 'gay', 'radio', 'personality', 'who', 'involved', 'phone', 'people', 'not', 'sure', 'exist', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'excellent', 'role', 'too', 'directing', 'unobtrusive', 'gladly', 'features', 'MTV-style', 'camera', 'trickery', 'oversaturated', 'color', 'other', 'visual', 'gimmicks', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'days', 'story', 'mysterious', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'emotional', 'only', 'criticism', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', '82', 'minutes.I', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'was', 'great', '-a', 'real', 'page', 'turner', 'lot', 'heart', 'also', 'quite', 'sad', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'screenplay', 'was', 'co-written', 'Armistead', 'Maupin', 'author', 'book', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'truncated', 'However', 'content', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'largely', 'character', 'gayness', 'family', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'acceptable', 'general', 'public', 'way', 'depth', 'character', 'get', 'book', 'recommendation', 'see', 'film', 'like', 'read', 'book', 'afterward', 'will', 'enjoy', 'way', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'already', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'yet', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Robin', 'who', 'have', 'shed', 'comic', 'persona', 'more', 'serious', 'substantial', 'roles', 'great', 'success']",N/A

That is the premise behind The Night Listener, based on a phone conversation between a radio show host and a young boy whose existence could never be proven.  Unfortunately, in this case the true life events were likely more compelling than this bland adaptation.For a basic plot summer, ""Night Listener"" tells the store of a radio talk show host (played by Robin Williams) who takes a liking to a young boy supposedly dying from a terrible disease.  However, as the relationship builds, ""Williams"" has reason to believe that the boy may not be who he says he is (or even exist at all), thus leading to a personal investigation to find out the truth.Now, had the film actually stuck to that basic plotline, it might have been a halfways decent thriller.  Instead, for whatever reason, it focuses far too much on the personal demons of ""Williams"" (e.g. his character's homosexuality really doesn't add anything to the film, yet is explored in great detail).  Also, the relationship between ""Williams"" and the mystery boy in question's mother is ultimately crucial to understanding the film's conclusion, but is again too much about HIS perspective, not HERS.  Like I said, more focus on the mystery at hand would have made for a more compelling experience.Thus, I think a 1.5-star rating perfectly pegs this movie, as it was only good enough to make you want to see how things turn out in the end, not so much caring about the journey to get to that point.  Also, it comes nowhere close to, say, ""One Hour Photo"" in terms of establishing Williams as a serious actor and not just a manic comedian.",2,True Story Sounds More Interesting Than This Adaptation,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,1686,"['What', 'person', 'were', 'talking', 'phone', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'premise', 'Night', 'Listener', 'based', 'phone', 'conversation', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'young', 'boy', 'existence', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'proven', 'Unfortunately', 'case', 'true', 'life', 'events', 'were', 'likely', 'more', 'compelling', 'bland', 'basic', 'plot', 'summer', 'Night', 'Listener', 'store', 'radio', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'liking', 'young', 'boy', 'supposedly', 'dying', 'terrible', 'disease', 'However', 'relationship', 'Williams', 'reason', 'believe', 'boy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'who', 'even', 'exist', 'thus', 'leading', 'personal', 'investigation', 'find', 'out', 'truth.Now', 'had', 'film', 'actually', 'stuck', 'basic', 'plotline', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'halfways', 'decent', 'thriller', 'Instead', 'reason', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'personal', 'demons', 'Williams', 'e.g', 'character', 'homosexuality', 'really', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'explored', 'great', 'detail', 'Also', 'relationship', 'Williams', 'mystery', 'boy', 'question', 'mother', 'ultimately', 'crucial', 'understanding', 'film', 'conclusion', 'again', 'too', 'much', 'HIS', 'perspective', 'not', 'HERS', 'said', 'more', 'focus', 'mystery', 'hand', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'compelling', 'experience.Thus', 'think', '1.5-star', 'rating', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'end', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'caring', 'journey', 'get', 'point', 'Also', 'nowhere', 'close', 'say', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'terms', 'establishing', 'Williams', 'serious', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'manic', 'comedian']",N/A

So, I was pleasantly surprised to find out how good this movie actually is.I haven't read the book, so I can't compare the movie to the novel as some have done. What I can do is offer my thoughts on the movie itself.The Night Listener is an eerily realistic (well, it's based on actual events, so what do you expect) thriller about a radio personality that is presented with a novel supposedly written by an abused 14-year old boy. After keeping up a friendly relationship with the boy and his caregiver for several months, he begins to suspect that the situation is not entirely real. (I won't say how and give away the central theme of the film).What ensues is a dramatic chilling film that has you wondering what will happen next and really thinking about the kinds of people that live in this world with us.Robin Williams and Toni Collette are both amazing in their own ways, and Rory Culkin is equally impressive in his brief role.The film moves along slowly, allowing the reality and the eerieness of the situation to really sink in and sit with the audience. Nothing over-the-top or overtly shocking happens, which is also nice to see in a movie trying to frighten the viewer. This is the stuff that real horror movies are made of.The DVD extras are pretty standard: a making of featurette and a deleted scene. The making of featurette is very interesting, though, including interviews with the writer and his partner (to whom this story actually happened to), the director, and Robin Williams. The deleted scene is pretty silly, but hey, that's why it was deleted.",4,A darkly thrilling psychological drama,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,1661,"['had', ""n't"", 'really', 'heard', 'much', 'movie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'great', 'So', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'actually', 'is.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'novel', 'have', 'done', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'offer', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'itself.The', 'Night', 'Listener', 'eerily', 'realistic', 'well', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'thriller', 'radio', 'personality', 'presented', 'novel', 'supposedly', 'written', 'abused', '14-year', 'old', 'boy', 'keeping', 'up', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'boy', 'caregiver', 'several', 'months', 'suspect', 'situation', 'not', 'entirely', 'real', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'give', 'away', 'central', 'theme', 'film', '.What', 'dramatic', 'chilling', 'film', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'really', 'thinking', 'kinds', 'people', 'live', 'world', 'us.Robin', 'Williams', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'are', 'amazing', 'own', 'ways', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'equally', 'impressive', 'brief', 'role.The', 'film', 'moves', 'slowly', 'allowing', 'reality', 'eerieness', 'situation', 'really', 'sink', 'sit', 'audience', 'Nothing', 'over-the-top', 'overtly', 'shocking', 'happens', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'trying', 'frighten', 'viewer', 'stuff', 'real', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'of.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'standard', 'making', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scene', 'making', 'featurette', 'very', 'interesting', 'though', 'including', 'interviews', 'writer', 'partner', 'whom', 'story', 'actually', 'happened', 'director', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'deleted', 'scene', 'pretty', 'silly', 'hey', 'why', 'was', 'deleted']",N/A
