79409,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,078881107X,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[2, 2]","I must admit that I love Hayao Miyazaki's film KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE! Everything from the storyline, the background music, the wonderful animation (and especially when Kiki and Jiji fly high above the city on her broom) has captivated me since I first saw it years ago.The only thing I didn't really like was the English dub with Kristen Dunst and Phil Hartman, but not a problem. The DVD has the option of choosing the original Japanese language track and using English subtitles, so I'm a happy camper.Anyway, the story is about a 13-year old witch named Kiki and her best friend, a little black cat named Jiji, who leave their home and move to a new city, which all witches must do at that age, so that she can develop her magical powers and make a home for herself. She meets both good and snooty people in the new city, and like anyone who moves to an unknown place, Kiki is plagued with fears, self-doubt, and homesickness. So great is her self-doubt that she begins to lose her witchcraft and must some how find a way to get it back.The story is great for all ages and even though it may seem to be a simple story on the surface it deals with issues about trust, the belief in one's self, and about starting over.The new 2010 release of KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE: SPECIAL EDITION 2-DVD has some cool extras on it, but I think some of them might also be on the special Blu-ray ofPonyo (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo). The really unique featurette on this set is the ""Locations Of Kiki""-which I'll describe below.======  SPECIAL FEATURES  ======* Creating Kiki's Delivery Service * -- 02:28-minutes -- Miyazaki-san talks about the movie.* Kiki & Jiji * -- 03:28-minutes -- Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about character development.* Flying With Kiki * -- 02:51-minutes -- Miyazaki-san talks about the challenges in animating the flying sequences.*** Locations Of Kiki *** -- 29:03-minutes -- This is worth buying the new 2010 DVD release! It's a featurette where a film crew goes to the real location that inspired the fictional ""Korico"" city in the movie. This is fascinating to watch as they compare the storyboards, movie, and the real locations in Stockholm and Visby. It's only in Japanese but has English subtitles. This is part of a Japanese documentary called ""The Scenery In Ghibli,"" which profiles the real world locations that inspired Miyazki-san's world.* Scoring Miyazaki * -- 07:20-minutes -- Producer Suzuki talks about composer Joe Hisaishi, who has scored all of Miyazki-san's films, and Hisaishi talks about creating the music for ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition),"" ""Castle in the Sky: Special Edition - 2 Disc DVD,"" and ""Ponyo (Two-Disc Edition)."" This featurette was also on the PONYO BLU-RAY.* Trailers ** Behind The Microphone * -- 05:00-minutes -- this is for the English dub with Dunst et al.* Sneak Previews * -- These are teasers for the special features of ""Ghibli Worlds"" on the other 2010 releases of Miyazaki-san's movies: ""Ponyo""-creating Ponyo; ""My Neighbor Totoro""-creating Totoro; ""Castle In The Sky""-character sketches.* Original Storyboards * -- here you can watch the entire movie with just the storyboards.

79410,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,078881107X,Alex Udvary,"[13, 27]","Depending on how you view the work of Hayao Miyazaki your reaction to this film could be quite mixed. Some may feel it is another example of Miyazaki's genius. A film that is accessible to children as well as adults. Others may view it as a charming, sweet disappointment. I belong to the latter.Many people feel Miyazaki (and I am one of them) is one of the greatest animators of all time. What I personally enjoy about his films is the fact his work is more complex then say a Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny cartoon. Mickey and Bugs always remain cartoon characters. We can not relate to them because they do not inhabit our world. Those cartoons are specifically designed for children. Miyazaki on the other hand creates more than just cartoon characters. He simply creates characters. They are complex people. They are motivated by the same emotions as we are and face dilemmas we can understand. Children may enjoy these films but it would be for completely different reasons than adults, who will be able to fully understand what his work is about.If anyone other than Miyazaki had made this film I would be recommending it. But my failure to do so is not done out of spite, instead it is done out of affection, as odd as that may sound. Because I think Miyazaki has made films that have been far more complex ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" comes off as ""too simple"". It doesn't dwell as deeply as some of his other films in offering a social or even slightly political message. ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" though is made in the tradition of previous Disney classics. And from what I have seen by Miyazaki it is his most accessible to children.The story is about a young witch, Kiki (voiced in the American version by Kirsten Dunst) who having turned 13 must now leave home and spend a year on her own so she can develop her special powers. She travels to a new town with her cat (Phil Hartman) where she is greeted somewhat coldly. The fact that she literally flies into town does not impress anyone but instead frightens them. Kiki meets a boy, Tombo (Matthew Lawrence) who is fascinated by her, especially the fact that she can fly on a broom since he is interested in aviation. Because of her powers Kiki opens a delivery service working in a bakery.The movie's message is you should always believe in yourself because when you doubt yourself you can lose your ability to help people. When you believe in yourself you can accomplish anything.""Kiki's Delivery Service"" has all the traits that make a Miyazaki film memorable as well. There is the precocious female character, aviation, and of course magic.I think I've given you a fair description of the plot and have expressed why I don't think the movie is better than Miyzaki's other works. So it is now up to you to decide if you want to see it. If you have children they will like this movie, and I'll bet you will to. If you've never heard of Miyazaki you may also enjoy the film because if for any other reason, you won't be able to compare it to anything else he has made. Even I have to admit I liked the film. ** 1/2 out of *****p.s. I would also like to take the time out and tell you if you haven't seen his lastest film ""Howl's Moving Castle"" please do so. It is not only Miyazaki's best film, but it is also the greatest animated film I have ever seen.Bottom-line: Enjoyable if slight Hayao Miyazaki film that doesn't quite seem as complex as his other films. From what I have seen from Miyazaki though it is probably his most accessible to children. It is made in the great tradition of Disney cartoons.",2,"""Kiki"" May Not Quite Deliver Depending On How You View Miyazaki",1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,3566,"['Depending', 'how', 'view', 'work', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'reaction', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'mixed', 'may', 'feel', 'example', 'Miyazaki', 'genius', 'film', 'accessible', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'Others', 'may', 'view', 'charming', 'sweet', 'disappointment', 'belong', 'latter.Many', 'people', 'feel', 'Miyazaki', 'am', 'one', 'one', 'greatest', 'animators', 'time', 'What', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'films', 'fact', 'work', 'more', 'complex', 'then', 'say', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoon', 'Mickey', 'Bugs', 'always', 'remain', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'do', 'not', 'inhabit', 'world', 'cartoons', 'are', 'specifically', 'designed', 'children', 'Miyazaki', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'just', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'simply', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'people', 'are', 'motivated', 'same', 'emotions', 'are', 'face', 'can', 'understand', 'Children', 'may', 'enjoy', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'reasons', 'adults', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'work', 'about.If', 'anyone', 'other', 'Miyazaki', 'had', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'recommending', 'failure', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'done', 'spite', 'instead', 'done', 'affection', 'as', 'odd', 'may', 'sound', 'think', 'Miyazaki', 'made', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'off', 'too', 'simple', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'as', 'deeply', 'other', 'films', 'offering', 'social', 'even', 'slightly', 'political', 'message', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'though', 'made', 'tradition', 'previous', 'Disney', 'classics', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Miyazaki', 'most', 'accessible', 'children.The', 'story', 'young', 'witch', 'Kiki', 'voiced', 'American', 'version', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'having', 'turned', '13', 'must', 'now', 'leave', 'home', 'spend', 'year', 'own', 'can', 'develop', 'special', 'powers', 'new', 'town', 'cat', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'where', 'greeted', 'somewhat', 'coldly', 'fact', 'literally', 'town', 'not', 'impress', 'anyone', 'instead', 'Kiki', 'boy', 'Tombo', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'who', 'fascinated', 'especially', 'fact', 'can', 'fly', 'broom', 'interested', 'aviation', 'powers', 'Kiki', 'delivery', 'service', 'working', 'bakery.The', 'movie', 'message', 'should', 'always', 'believe', 'when', 'doubt', 'can', 'lose', 'ability', 'help', 'people', 'When', 'believe', 'can', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'traits', 'make', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'memorable', 'as', 'well', 'precocious', 'female', 'character', 'aviation', 'course', 'magic.I', 'think', ""'ve"", 'given', 'fair', 'description', 'plot', 'have', 'expressed', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'better', 'Miyzaki', 'other', 'works', 'now', 'up', 'decide', 'want', 'see', 'have', 'children', 'will', 'like', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'will', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Miyazaki', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'compare', 'anything', 'else', 'made', 'Even', 'have', 'admit', 'liked', 'film', '**', '1/2', '*****p.s', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'tell', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lastest', 'film', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'please', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'Miyazaki', 'best', 'film', 'also', 'greatest', 'animated', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Bottom-line', 'Enjoyable', 'slight', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'as', 'complex', 'other', 'films', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'Miyazaki', 'probably', 'most', 'accessible', 'children', 'made', 'great', 'tradition', 'Disney', 'cartoons']",N/A
79411,AK0CENM3LUM28,078881107X,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Kiki's Delivery Service / B00005JM2O*Spoilers*I absolutely lovedNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,Princess Mononoke, andSpirited Away, but I have to confess that I found ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" a bit slow.The movie is a delightful and charming 'coming of age' type film, featuring a kind-hearted little girl (barely thirteen), setting off on her own in an ancient tradition to become a witch, as her mother is. Once you accept the setup, that witches are real, and very normal (except, apparently, in the charming little seaside village that Kiki eventually takes residence in), the movie becomes mostly just another charming ""day in the life of"" films, not totally unlikeMy Neighbor Totoro. Which is fine, if you're looking for something relatively slow-paced, charming, and wholesome - I'd recommend this over pretty much any other children's movie that's come out in the past decade - but if you're looking for the action and philosophy of ""Mononoke"" or ""Nausicaa"", you won't really find it here, and if you're drawn to the mysticism of ""Spirited Away"", there's not much of that here either - except for flying, Kiki doesn't know any magic or spells to perform.Not that there's anything wrong with that - not every movie has to be incredibly action-oriented, or deeply philosophical, or stocked with unusual or intriguing monsters. But I found myself mildly irked by Kiki's massive mood-swings - and while they are certainly realistic for a young thirteen-year-old out on her own for the first time, I tend to prefer the maturity of Nausicaa or at least the emotional growth of Sen (""Spirited Away""). While Kiki 'grows' in the sense that she finds a purpose in her flying (although I would have preferred it to be 'saving people' as opposed to 'saving my crush', since that seems a little limiting), she doesn't really seem to grow in terms of how she relates to the people around her, and I'm not sure how I feel about that.Or perhaps I'm being too hard on the movie because, for some reason, I found Kirsten Dunst's voice-acting distracting. I don't know how to explain that except that she sounded too much like Kirsten Dunst, and I kept slipping out of the immersion as a result. That's probably more my fault than anything else, though.Waffling aside, I enjoyed ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" well enough. Adults will find it charming, and I think children will genuinely love the idea of striking out on your own with nothing but a talking cat and a flying broom.

79415,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,078881107X,Andres C. Salama,"[2, 2]","Hayao Miyazaki animated feature of a 13-old year witch leaving his parents and settling in a new town to form a (broom-based) delivery service is irresistible. As in many of his movies, the protagonist here is a plucky heroine defying all odds. What I found most enjoyable about the movie - though - is its background details. Miyazaki loves European culture - and the movie is set in neverland Europe - a fantasized Europe that never existed.

There are no forest creatures, no warring nations, no conflicts with nature. All it has is one little girl (as we all know, this is a Miyazaki standard, having a young girl as a protagonist) who wants nothing more than to find her place in an unfamiliar setting. In this, Miyazaki shows just how tender his heart is, and also shows his love for the sky and for story-telling in generalKiki is a thirteen-year-old witch-in-training who is just about to set out on a journey that will not only help her achieve her place as a witch, but to also prove to herself that she's an adult. Leaving behind her witch mother and a doting father, Kiki travels to a distant city at the edge of the ocean, where she is instantly over-taken by the goings-on in the city. Yet she's determined to find her place, and ends up doing so in the strangest of ways: by delivering a lost pacifier to a crying baby. Thus, she gets her job in a bakery as a delivery girl, and goes about finding her place as the city's resident witch. Along the way she meets many people that help her prove to herself that she's a worthy witch, and also meets a potential, future, love interest.All around, this is a fun and simple movie to watch, one great for an entire family, and probably the absolute best anime to introduce people to the world of Japanese Animation. I personally saw this movie years ago on the Disney Channel. It was my first ever Miyazaki film and one I would remember as the movie that got me back into anime after a few years off. The one problem this movie has is that it's only comparable to other Miyazaki films, so I gave it a four simply because it's neither the best nor the worst Ghibli film out in the states, and definitely something that should be seen by both veterans and new-comers alike.As an aside, this is also a bitter-sweet movie to watch, as it was one of the last places that Phil Hartman (Saturday Night Live) contributed his skills. He plays Kiki's ever present cat Jiji and does so with a gentler Hartman style. As a voice-actor, he was great, but as a comedian, he was brilliant.",4,Miyazaki Shows His Soft Side...

I had a chance to see this many years ago after the success of My Neighbor Totoro allowed this film to get the quality Disney dub treatment as well. For some reason, this film which actually made it into a few theatres disappeared into obscurity. The success of Spirited Away prompted Disney to get off their butts and let the world see another of Miyazaki's magnificent films.When I first saw this film, it didn't leave the same impression on me as any of Miyazaki's other films did. Sure, I felt it was good, but I think I found it too girlish for my taste. Of course, I was younger then (probably still in high school), and seeing it now allows me to have a better appreciation for the film. In all honesty, I do still expect this film to appeal much more to women and girls; it is a coming of age story about a young girl after all. However, I wouldn't compare it to a &quot;chick flick&quot;.I was pleasantly surprised to discover I liked this film more than I remembered. Kirsten Dunst (who was much younger when this film was originally dubbed) perfectly portrays Kiki, the films main character, and Phil Hartman brings a lot of charm and personality to the film as Kiki's cat.This film has all the magic you'd come to expect from Miyazaki. For guys, I recommend checking out Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, and Spirited Away first as you will probably like them more than this film. Girls, I'd recommend Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, and Spirited Away before seeing the rest. I recommend anyone see all of Miyazaki's films, but everyone's gonna have favorites.

Kiki is a 13-year old girl who's also a witch.  Following tradition, she must set out on the night of a full moon to a town (with no witches I gather) and begin her training away from home -- to learn her skills.This movie is unique in that there are no bad guys.  It is simply a story of a young girl, her cat Jiji, and her coming to the threshold of womanhood.  So she has her first ""romance"" with one of the local boys who's into flying and really digs Kiki because she can fly on a broom.  The romance is sweetly done and is nothing more than the romances many of us had at 12-13 -- totally innocent.I've not yet seen the Japanese version (though I plan to), so I don't know how well of a job at translation Disney did.  I hear it is pretty good though.  Certainly, the English dub is very good -- maybe some of the best for anime.  Phil Hartman is perfect in the role of Jiji the black cat.  There are a few areas where I suspect things didn't translate as well, but that's to be expected since there are things in the Japanese language that don't translate well into English.My only problem with the movie is that it really feels rushed at the end.  So the ending wasn't very satisfying.

And I also bought the video for my private collect.  Hayao Miyazaki is a true master when it comes to  animating his own creations; this film is a refreshingly innocent work of  art set apart from most of the anime, which consists a little too  frequently of underaged sex objects all dressed up in sailor-style school  uniforms as well as gut-wrenchingly graphic violence, eye-popping gore, and  sexual exploitation of young girls far below the legal age.  In the film,  we become one with a budding young witch first setting out on her  coming-of-age journey and learning to cope with her newly found  independence in another town - the kind you can find in well-illustrated  storybooks. We can feel Kiki's truimphs and frustations throughout the  tale, including her frostiness with a really charming young boy named  Tombo. And the scene where Tombo takes Kiki for a ride on his  propellel-powered bicycle will literally lift you right off your feet!  However, there are a couple of things in the film that kind of disappoint  me. First, there's a bit of really wild action where young Tombo is  dangling in great peril from a runaway blimp. This affects the believablity  of this situation quite a bit, but the tension buildup itself is  marvelously carried out nevertheless. And I am really sorry that the  talking kitty never spoke ever again after he made it with a lady cat.Overall, it is truly a wonderful vision all about innocence and joyness  that everyone should share!",5,What a sweet sweet tale about a good little witch!,945993600,"12 24, 1999",1999,1595,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'raised', 'steady', 'diet', 'anime', 'most', 'life', 'saw', 'film', 'anime', 'club', 'college', 'also', 'bought', 'video', 'private', 'collect', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'true', 'master', 'when', 'animating', 'own', 'creations', 'film', 'refreshingly', 'innocent', 'work', 'art', 'set', 'apart', 'most', 'anime', 'little', 'too', 'frequently', 'underaged', 'sex', 'dressed', 'up', 'sailor-style', 'school', 'uniforms', 'as', 'well', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'graphic', 'violence', 'eye-popping', 'gore', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'young', 'girls', 'far', 'legal', 'age', 'film', 'become', 'one', 'budding', 'young', 'witch', 'first', 'setting', 'out', 'coming-of-age', 'journey', 'learning', 'cope', 'newly', 'found', 'independence', 'town', 'kind', 'can', 'find', 'well-illustrated', 'storybooks', 'can', 'feel', 'Kiki', 'truimphs', 'frustations', 'tale', 'including', 'frostiness', 'really', 'charming', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Tombo', 'scene', 'where', 'Tombo', 'Kiki', 'ride', 'propellel-powered', 'bicycle', 'will', 'literally', 'lift', 'right', 'feet', 'However', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'film', 'kind', 'disappoint', 'First', 'bit', 'really', 'wild', 'action', 'where', 'young', 'Tombo', 'dangling', 'great', 'peril', 'runaway', 'blimp', 'believablity', 'situation', 'quite', 'bit', 'tension', 'buildup', 'marvelously', 'carried', 'out', 'nevertheless', 'am', 'really', 'sorry', 'talking', 'kitty', 'never', 'spoke', 'ever', 'again', 'made', 'lady', 'cat.Overall', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'vision', 'innocence', 'joyness', 'everyone', 'should', 'share']",N/A

Kiki has just turned 13 and found her own city by the sea. She is befriended by a kind, and very pregnant baker woman, who suggests Kiki uses her flying broom to start a delivery service to make some money. She meets a boy a nice old lady, gets a cold, makes friends with a strange artist and delivers stuff. The End.A few spoilers I left out aside, that's the gist of the movie. I read once in an interview with writer/director Hayao Miyazaki that he does not sit down and write scripts so much as he sits and draws, letting the story evolve from there. This method has worked beautifully for Miyazaki in movies like PRINCESS MONONOKE and SPIRITED AWAY (two far superior films). Sadly, KIKI is not such a film. The movie, like the story's heroine Kiki, just kind of wanders around, pointless. The movie tells the audience Kiki has to go away for a year to ""learn how to use her powers,"" but how exactly is she supposed to learn without anyone to teach her? She has no real mentor. And Kiki's main ability is flying. But she can already fly before she leaves home on her journey in the first place. The reclusive artist lady who lives in the woods is also another mind-boggler. Other than a semi-sage like character (who doesn't give any really great advice), she serves no real purpose.The translation for this film was also the worst. Stay away altogether from the English dub with a young Kirsten Dunst as the voice of Kiki and the late Phil Hartman as the voice of Kiki's talking black cat, Gigi. The translation for that dub was terrible.A good example of the variations in translation and their impact on the film is the scene when Kiki encounters another witch while looking for her own city. The original Japanese has the witch being a bit curt, by Western standards, yet polite to Kiki. In the English subtitles she is a bit snobby and in the English dub she is an outright jerk! The suits at Disney were obviously trying to turn this into an American film and also added all sorts of unfunny, smart-aleck dialogue for Gigi the black cat that is nowhere in the Japanese dub!I think the point the film is trying to make under all these silly adventures is that young women can be strong and independent and overcome obstacles.

So Kiki leaves her home in the country with her black cat Jiji for the big city.  But what can a young witch with no special skills do to find her place?KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, originally released in 1989, is a charming story told with gorgeous animation and art.  It was the first film by Hayao Miyazaki that I saw, and it's still my favorite.  I love spending time with the characters in the city, which although a bustling place, retains its village-like atmosphere.  I always enjoy revisiting it.Although all Miyazaki films are generally suitable for the whole family, I'd recommend this (as well as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO) for younger viewers especially, as it is not frightening or as intense (or as heavily-themed) as PRINCESS MONONOKE or HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, for example.The film appears on the DVD in both the original Japanese language, and an English dialogue version.  The English dub is fairly well-done (with voices provided by Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman, Debbie Reynolds, Matthew Lawrence and Janeane Garofalo) but for some reason the American producers felt the need to add an obscene amount of extra dialogue for Jiji (the late Hartman's role.)  Apparently they thought American audiences couldn't bear scenes where people weren't talking, so the character is saddled with a lot of gratuitous commentary which is intended to be humorous but isn't.  I call it Disney sidekick syndrome.  It's very distracting, and the film suffers for it.  I don't blame the actor - he was just doing his job - but for this reason I don't recommend watching the movie in English.Apart from that, this is a rather nice package.  There is a ""Behind the Microphone"" feature with Dunst, Hartman and Lawrence, original Japanese trailers, previews for other Studio Ghibli, Disney and Pixar films, and an introduction by Pixar's John Lasseter.  The film is presented in widescreen enhanced for 16x9 television sets.  The English soundtrack is in 5.1 stereo.  The Japanese is in standard stereo, but the world is so alive you won't notice.  The second disc contains the storyboards for the entire film and you can watch them with the Japanese or English soundtrack.  I don't think I'd ever view the whole thing from start to finish, but it is interesting to poke around in.This is a beautiful, magical film, with wholesome lessons for the kids (if you're concerned about that sort of thing) that should delight anyone who appreciates the art of animation.  Five stars for the original movie, maybe one less for the slightly less than wonderful English version.

To train for one year and find  what she is good at.Famed Director Hiyao Mizasaki does give Kiki any  hidden talents, any grand abilities...actually Kiki is can't do anything  other than the typical flying on a broomstick (a standard ability among  witches).

She makes an impression on the townfolk by blowing in with a broomstick, along with her wisecracking cat, Gigi. She searches for a job, and finds one as a delivery girl for a local bakery. Kiki encounters what all teenagers go through: insecurity, loneliness, boredom, and eventually loses her greatest talent--flying. From that experience, she learns from a former struggling artist that you need to do what you love from the heart.Voice acting is brilliant. Kirsten Dunst sounds believable as Kiki, and Phil Hartman is hilarious as Gigi. Unlike other animes, the voices aren't too squeaky or sound really stupid.Also, there is a great message, as I mentioned earlier, underneath this movie. There are wonderful role models and rememberable characters that will stay in your heart, whether you like it, or not.",5,A Breezy Adventurous Ride,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,1146,"['Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'favorite', 'anime', 'creator', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'carrying', 'hidden', 'message', 'light', 'weight', 'action', 'drama', 'Kiki', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'witch-in-training', 'customs', 'sent', 'live', 'city', 'Kiki', 'delightful', 'European', 'city', 'bustling', 'buzz', 'impression', 'townfolk', 'blowing', 'broomstick', 'wisecracking', 'cat', 'Gigi', 'job', 'one', 'delivery', 'girl', 'local', 'bakery', 'Kiki', 'what', 'teenagers', 'go', 'insecurity', 'loneliness', 'boredom', 'eventually', 'greatest', 'talent', 'flying', 'experience', 'former', 'struggling', 'artist', 'need', 'do', 'what', 'love', 'heart.Voice', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'believable', 'Kiki', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'hilarious', 'Gigi', 'other', 'animes', 'voices', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'squeaky', 'sound', 'really', 'stupid.Also', 'great', 'message', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'are', 'wonderful', 'role', 'models', 'rememberable', 'characters', 'will', 'stay', 'heart', 'not']",N/A
79443,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,078881107X,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","Just putting in my two cents here:I have viewed this in the two English dub versions as well as the original Japanese.  I must say that the original Japanese is the best of the three by far.  I enjoy foreign films and anime, so I am used to hearing films in their original dialogue.  The actor who voices Jiji is absolutely amazing (in the Japanese version), the perfect mix of wit, sarcasm, narcissism, and cuteness.The film is one of Miyazaki's more lighthearted pieces.  You won't find boar demons or sky pirates or evil wizards casting curses here.  Though on the surface it does appear simple and heartwarming, there is a bit more to it than that.  Kiki grapples with coming to age and understanding her witchy powers.  As with most Miyazaki films, the heroine is rather ordinary looking but possesses strength and courage and a kind heart.  She is well liked by those she meets and often performs good deeds.  This creates an instantly likable protagonist, with whom the viewer sympathizes.  Add to this an interesting cast (although the Waldo look alike kid gets kind of annoying at times!), and you have the recipe for a wonderful feel-good film.Though Disney casts these films well for the English track, I still think it best to at least watch the original Japanese version of these films at least once.  Though Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle (with the exception of Christian Bale) have better English tracks than the English dubs on other Miyazaki films.This is certainly as good and lighthearted a film as My Neighbor Totoro and deserves a viewing by any Miyazaki fan.  I am an adult (no kids) and I still love his films.Also recommended: My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited AwayRecommended but a little more grown up themes: Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, Nausicaa",5,Possibly the cutest cat voice ever (the Japanese version)!,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,1827,"['Just', 'putting', 'two', 'cents', 'here', 'have', 'viewed', 'two', 'English', 'dub', 'versions', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'Japanese', 'must', 'say', 'original', 'Japanese', 'best', 'three', 'far', 'enjoy', 'foreign', 'films', 'anime', 'am', 'used', 'hearing', 'films', 'original', 'dialogue', 'actor', 'who', 'Jiji', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Japanese', 'version', 'perfect', 'mix', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'narcissism', 'cuteness.The', 'film', 'one', 'Miyazaki', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'pieces', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'boar', 'demons', 'sky', 'pirates', 'evil', 'wizards', 'casting', 'curses', 'here', 'surface', 'appear', 'simple', 'heartwarming', 'bit', 'more', 'Kiki', 'coming', 'age', 'understanding', 'witchy', 'powers', 'most', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'heroine', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'looking', 'possesses', 'strength', 'courage', 'kind', 'heart', 'well', 'liked', 'meets', 'often', 'performs', 'good', 'deeds', 'instantly', 'likable', 'protagonist', 'whom', 'viewer', 'sympathizes', 'Add', 'interesting', 'cast', 'Waldo', 'look', 'alike', 'kid', 'kind', 'annoying', 'times', 'have', 'recipe', 'wonderful', 'feel-good', 'film.Though', 'Disney', 'films', 'well', 'English', 'track', 'still', 'think', 'best', 'least', 'watch', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'films', 'least', 'once', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'exception', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'have', 'better', 'English', 'tracks', 'English', 'dubs', 'other', 'Miyazaki', 'films.This', 'certainly', 'as', 'good', 'lighthearted', 'film', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'viewing', 'Miyazaki', 'fan', 'am', 'adult', 'kids', 'still', 'love', 'films.Also', 'recommended', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Spirited', 'AwayRecommended', 'little', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'themes', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Nausicaa']",N/A
79444,A1YWUPCT83WY48,078881107X,"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader""","[78, 80]","It's great that Americans are finally discovering the dazzling animation of Japanese genius Hayao Miyazaki (whose film ""Spirited Away"" won the award for Best Animated Film in 2003), and that Disney has started to release excellent DVD editions of his films with both Japanese and English language options. Miyazaki's 1989 film ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (""Majo no takkyubin"" in Japanese; literally ""Witch's Express Mail"") is his most easily accessible and the best place to start in watching his movies. ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is an honest-to-goodness `family' film. Children will adore it, and adults will find themselves enchanted with its charm, delightful characters, and the sheer beauty of the animation. I once watched the film with a room of twenty and thirty year-olds, a few young children, and an 84 year-old woman, and everybody LOVED it and cheered the heroine on at the end. Simply put, there are few films out there that are as loveable and likable as this.In terms of story, it's an odd film: there's not much in the way of `plot.' The film depends strongly on its heroine and the way she learns from the world and the people around her as she grows up. Kiki is a thirteen-year-old witch in training who leaves her home to start her required period of living on her own to discover her talents. Kiki and her cat sidekick Jiji jet out on her broom to a city (vaguely European, with traces of Paris, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam) and settle down at a friendly baker's shop, where Kiki establishes her own broom-powered delivery service (look out, Fed-Ex!). The story follows her troubles and joys, such as her friendship with a local boy inventor Tombo, her meeting with nature-loving artist Ursula, the tricks and difficulties of making deliveries, and the possible loss of her powers when she starts to lose belief in herself. It all climaxes in a thrilling action sequence that Superman would be proud of.The movie leaps from wonderful sequence to wonderful sequence: Kiki's passionate farewell to her parents, her first flight over the city, Tombo's wild ride on his experimental flying bike, a dangerous flight through a flock of birds, the action-packed finale, and the many terrific meetings between Kiki and other charming characters. Watching Kiki learn and grow will have an affect on children young and old: everybody can take something away from the lessons Kiki learns about herself. And of course, the animation is dazzling; not only the sweeping visuals, but the nuances of the characters' expressions and movements.The DVD offers the film in English and Japanese (oh, and Spanish too). If you watch the film in Japanese, you have the choice to watch it with two different sets of subtitles. One set is a literal translation of the Japanese script. The second are taken directly from the English version, and therefore have a distinctly ""American"" feel to them. I recommend when watching the Japanese version to stick with the literal subtitles. Since the English dub of the film often adds extra lines to characters (especially Jiji), it can be confusing to see subtitles pop up when nobody is speaking.The Americanized dubbed version, however, is fantastic as well, and done with great respect and intelligence. The voice cast is superb: Kirsten Dunst as Kiki, Janeane Garofola as Ursula, and Debbie Reynolds as sweet old Miss Dora. But the scene-stealer is the late Phil Hartman as Kiki's smart-aleck cat companion, Jiji. Hartman is hysterical in every scene, totally nailing down the character, and his performance is a bittersweet reminder of what a great comedian we lost with his premature death. If you're going to watch the film with children or a large, general group of people, stick with the English version. It's quite an achievement, and just as enjoyable as the Japanese version.There are some extras, although a lot less than you would expect for a 2-DVD set. John Lassiter (director of ""Toy Story"") introduces the film, and there's a short documentary about the English language actors. The second disc contains the whole film in storyboard and rough sketch form: this will really only be of interest to animators and hardcore Miyazaki fans.Every family should have ""Kiki's Delivery"" service in their library, although the adults may find themselves returning to it as much as the children; and it's a great introduction to Miyazaki. Make sure you also watch ""Castle in the Sky,"" ""Spirited Away,"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" (the last one isn't really for kids, however).",5,A film that everyone will enjoy.

Although Kiki does not use much magic except to fly on  her broom, the animator, Miyazaki (The Castle of Cagliostro, Princess  Mononoke) uses all the magic available to him.  You must see the way the  wind ruffles Kiki's hair, the expressiveness of Jiji the cat's saucer eyes,  the attack of the angry crows/magpies.  There is motion in every frame, and  all it of rings true.  The true magic lies in the characters, however.  Every one is well drawn (and not just visually), with distinctive  characteristics and roles in the plot.  The best of all is Kiki, with her  fresh-faced energy and her longing to fit into her new town.  So much is  conveyed here with a well-timed blink of Kiki's eyes that it's hard to  believe her part is not acted but drawn onto a cel.You MUST get this  video.  It puts Disney to shame.

79456,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,078881107X,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 3]","In 1989, Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli began work on their fifth film (their fourth theatrical film) titled ""Majo no Takkuybin"" (translates to ""Witch's Delivery Service"" but known as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"") directed by Hayao Miyazaki and is an adaptation of a 1985 novel by Eiko Kadono.  The film was a winner of the Animage Anime Grand Prix that same year and nearly a decade later, the film was the first Studio Ghibli film released by Disney (on VHS) back in 1998 and on DVD in 2003.With the release of Miyazaki's latest film ""Ponyo"", Disney is re-releasing DVD's of the ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Castle in the Sky"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" but this time in a special edition format in 2010 which includes more content.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is presented in widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions. Similar to ""My Neighbor Totoro"", Studio Ghibli continues its beautifully painted scenery with detail galore.  With Miyazaki inspired with a variety of cities and mishmashing European and Japanese architecture, Studio Ghibli was able to create this beautiful city with so much detail when it comes to the bricks that make up a building.  The plants and flowers that cover certain buildings.  There is a lot of detail and for the animation, capturing that feeling of flight when Kiki rides her broom through the air.  Absolutely well-done animation for a film back in 1989.As for the audio, audio is presented in remastered English Dolby Digital Surround Sound and comes with English, Japanese and French language tracks.  Dialogue is clear and understandable for each of the soundtracks. The sound of the wind and the leaves rustling can be heard quite clearly.  I preferred to have my home theater receiver's audio set at stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape but for the most part, dialogue and Joe Hisaishi's beautiful musical score can be heard clearly through the front and center channels.For those who watch the Japanese soundtrack will love the pairing of ""Ranma 1/2' voice actress Minami Takayama (Kiki and Ursula) and Kappei Yamaguchi (Tombo), interesting enough that ""Ranma 1/2' voice actress Noriko Hidaka was also the lead in Miyazaki's ""My Neighbor Totoro"".  For the English dub, Kirsten Dunst did a very good job as the voice of Kiki and Phil Hartman as Jiji, one of his final acting roles before his death in 1998.Subtitles are in English and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Kiki's Delivery Service"" comes with the following special features on a second DVD disc. Included are:* An Introduction by John Lasseter - Intro by PIXAR's John Lasseter (note: This intro. is on disc one).* Original Japanese Storyboards - Watch the entire film but this time with the video showcasing the original storyboards.* Creating Kiki's Delivery Service - (2:26) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the creation of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and how he ended up being the director and the cities that inspired the creation of the village.* Kiki & Jiji - (3:28)Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about Miyazaki before the making of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" while Miyazaki talked about his inspiration for the character of Kiki.* Flying with Kiki & Beyond - (2:50) Miyazaki talks about the challenges of creating the animation for the flying sequences and trying to make the scenes look natural.* Producer's Perspective: Collaborating with Miyazaki - (1:48) Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki talks about working with Miyazaki.* The Locations of Kiki - (28:34) An excerpt from a Japanese documentary on the scenery of ""Kiki's Delivery Service""* Scoring Miyazaki - (7:17) A featurette about Joe Hisaishi's scoring Miyazaki films and more.* Original Japanese Trailers - The original Japanese theatrical trailers for ""Kiki's Delivery Service"".* Behind the Microphone - (5:00) Featuring the English dub voice talents talking about their role, their appreciation for Miyazaki and his films. Also, behind-the-scenes of the talent recording their voices.* Ponyo - Creating Ponyo - (3:56) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the creation of ""Ponyo"" and wanting to create a film for young children.* My Neighbor Totoro: Creating My Neighbor Totoro - (2:57) Hayao Miyazaki discussing the creation of """"My Neighbor Totoro"".* Castle in the Sky: Character Sketches - (2:37) Miyazaki talks about the characters of ""Castle in the Sky"" and discussing how his audiences are loyal to his films over time.* Enter the Lands - Visit the land featuring various small animated Studio Ghibli characters (from all films). Click on a character from that film (note: only ""Ponyo"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky"" are available) to get a Q&A; or a small video info. of that film and its characters.EXTRAS:Also, included is a postcard featuring Kiki flying high in the air (similar to the image used for the cover).JUDGMENT CALL:Similar to ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I first watched ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" back in 1993 during a Japanese animation club screening at a local mall.  Granted, the film was in Japanese but during that time, many people would gather and watch a lot of animation in Japanese but for Miyazaki films, they were absolutely magical and just beautiful to look at. I can easily remember not knowing too much of what was being said but you can easily understand the storyline.Here we are over 15-years-later when I first watched the film and even now, I still find ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" to be a very magical and beautiful film.  The coming of age storyline of Kiki trying to get her life as a witch started in a bigger city and dealing with life challenges and personal insecurities is the main theme of this film and a theme that everyone can relate to.Although, the film is not exact to Eiko Kadono's original novel and at one point she was very unhappy with the direction of how the film was going, fortunately Hayao Miyazaki and producer Toshio Suzuki was able to convince her of why he included these personal obstacles in the film (it's important to note that the novel was written episodically and the film covers just a few episodes).I am aware of the DVD's reception back in 1998 when Disney originally dubbed the film.  Bare in mind that anime fans were not as easily encouraging towards English dubbing of their favorite Japanese animation during that that time period, compared to today.  There are slight differences in dialogue between the Japanese and its English counterpart in that Jiji in the Japanese version featured a female voice actress and also with certain dialogue which Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki did approve.Overall, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is a Studio Ghibli classic that is such a lovely and magical tale.  Featuring gorgeous animation and painted backgrounds, the storyline is heartwarming and captivating.  If you are wanting to catch up on Hayao Miyazaki films, definitely give ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" a try.  It's definitely recommended!",5,2010 DVD Release: A magnificent Studio Ghibli film with gorgeous animation and painted backgrounds and a heartwarming story.,1268179200,"03 10,

You want to choose carefully, since you will be spending so much quality time with this video. Kiki's Delivery Service won't disappoint you. This sweet, gentle movie is a coming-of-age story about Kiki, a 13-year-old witch-in-training. As part of said training, she is required to spend a year away from home practicing her craft. Her subsequent adventures are the subject of this endearing film by Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki. The animation is splendid, the casting mostly inspired (Kirsten Dunst, Janeane Garofalo, Debbie Reynolds, and even the late Phil Hartman as the voice of Kiki's companion cat). Unlike the standard Disney fare, this movie has no violence, no sex, no profanity, and not even a dysfunctional family.The themes of Kiki's Delivery Service are noble ones.

In the original when kiki was first flying away from home the song was in english called ""Soaring"" (look it up on Youtube it's a really good song). They changed all the english songs to japanese. Third, a lot of the back round track for other animals, and objects are gone too. Overall if you can find an older copy of the movie then buy that one.

79464,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,078881107X,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is a perfect example of a story idea that is merely decent, but is turned into a brilliant story because it's handled by a master storyteller. It's a literally enchanting story of a young witch who goes out to begin her life as an apprentice witch -- but it's the lovely animation, endearing characters and upbeat message of having confidence in yourself that are really striking.It's witch tradition that when a young witch begins her training, she spends a year living alone in a strange city. So Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) and her grumpy cat Jiji (Phil Hartman) for a big city. Despite her iffy flying skills and a sudden storm, Kiki successfully makes it to a seaside town -- and soon she has found a room to stay in, job as a delivery-witch, and some new friends (as well as an admiring young boy named Tombo, who's crazy about flying machines).It doesn't take long for Kiki's business to start booming, and for the townspeople to become very fond of their resident witch. But when she starts feeling like an outsider around Tombo's friends, Kiki finds that she can no longer fly or hear Jiji's voice. Is her magic gone forever -- or does it need something special to finally make a return? Will the little witch learn her greatest lesson, or will she fail before she even really starts?Personally, most stories that emphasize ""believing in yourself,"" ""doing your best"" and so on end up being pretty nauseating because it never feels like the filmmakers actually believe it. I can't speak for Hayao Miyazaki's outlook on life, but he is one of the few who actually makes you believe that there's a kind of magic in self-confidence.The story itself is so simple that it could be summed up in just a couple sentences, but Miyazaki weaves in enough complications and twists that it stays interesting (such as Kiki losing one of her deliveries). Things get rather bittersweet when Kiki loses her powers, but most of the movie is fairly lighthearted and sunny -- and there's some dry humor from Jiji to counterbalance Kiki's earnestness (""Okay, first: don't panic. Second: don't panic. And third: did I mention not to panic?"").And he sketches a truly enchanting backdrop for Kiki's coming-of-age -- a idyllic little village by the sea, framed by the blue sea and rolling green fields. The people are almost unreally kind and generous, leaving you wishing you were in Kiki's place.And Kiki may be a witch, but she's probably the most realistic ""kid"" heroine that I've ever seen in a movie. She worries about what people think of her, works hard to do her best,  and feels lonely at times after leaving her loving home -- just what you'd expect of a thirteen-year-old. Jiji is a hilariously sardonic familiar with an eye for the lady cats, and Tombo is an endearing young aviation geek who clearly has a crush on Kiki. And Miyazaki sketches out a supporting cast of lovable characters -- kind old ladies, a forest-dwelling artist, a pregnant baker, and others.""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is a simple story with a simple message, but it's delivered with such warmth and sweetness that you don't care at all.

In fact, she has no real skill other than she can fly on a broom, poorly (she is constantly colliding with buildings, trees, the ground..........).  It's an odd premise, purporting to be a coming of age story, in which the main character, a girl of 13, takes off for a distant city to ply her trade as a witch (who can't do anything).  So she randomly settles on delivering things for people for a price.  Along the way there's a few adventures of a sort, she makes a few friends, has a chance to finally prove her mettle as a flyer and almost screws that up........It's not great but it is cute in its own way.  Her sidekick Jiji is amusing for a time.  There's an artist who gives great advice.  The artwork is exceptional.

The story of Kiki's Delivery Service is really more character-driven than plot-driven.  I feel the movie really excels in this department.  The characters are very likeable/endearing.  I fully enjoyed seeing Kiki come into her own as she gained some confidence in a new place.  Overall, this is just a simple, sweet film about growing up, and I think ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" really succeeds in being this.

The second disc only contains storyboards, which most people (including me) will not watch (because they are boring).

A tween-age witch leaves home for a journey on her own as part of her training, settling in a small fictional town that is somewhat Germanic in look. The storyline is not as intricate as, say, that of Spirited Away, but the characters are no less charming or memorable.In this Disney-produced English translation (you can watch it subtitled in Japanese at once), Kirsten Dunst's earnest performance reminds me of Pamelyn Ferdin, the go-to young actress of late 60s/early 70s TV and animation. Debbie Reynolds has a small role as a kindly old woman, partnered with Edie McClurg as her housekeeper.But the scene-stealing role is that of the late Phil Hartman as Jiji, the cat who accompanies Kiki on her journey, making acerbic comments along the way. It only serves to underscore the great loss of a gifted performer and the potential never realized.One of the most interesting things about Kiki's Delivery Service is the way the general populace reacts to her magical gifts. She belongs to a group of individuals that are not feared, hidden or scorned, but instead treated matter-of-factly. A prime example is a scene in which Kiki's takes off on her broom and a village lady looks on with a ""well, what do you know, how interesting"" reaction.

Beginning with Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and continuing with Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Grave of the Fireflies and Totoro, I have now finished Kiki's Delivery Service. Kiki's Delivery Service is a magical coming-of-age tale about one witch's journey to find herself.In a far off land where magic exists, but is almost forgotten by most, we meet Kiki, a young witch who must leave home now that she has turned 13. Kiki, along with her talking cat, Jiji, leave home and journey to a seaside town where they set up shop making deliveries for the locals. Once again, the mother is out of the picture, although Kiki does end up living with a woman who is quite motherly and helps Kiki during the latter's many moments of doubt. In the end, Kiki, through the aid of the people she has come to surround herself with, manages to overcome her self-doubts and become a successful witch.The story itself is sweet and short. The journey that Kiki goes on is like that of any young person discovering themselves, unsure about who they are and who they want to be. This is unlike some of the previous Studio Ghibli outings that involved more action. If I had to compare it, I would say it was more like Totoro than anything else. And that is a good thing.

I'm 40 years old and my wife bought this for me for my birthday because I love animation, and because Roger Ebert spoke well of it in his reviews.  My wife and Roger Ebert were not wrong.  I sat  spellbound for the whole film. There is so much to like about this film  that it is hard to know where to begin praising it.  The animation is  exquisite, with attention to tiny details in every scene.  The characters  are believable and appealing.  The American voice actors are exactly right  for the parts they play, in particular the late Phil Hartman as JiJi the  cat and Janeane Garofalo as the artist Ursula.  Of course Kirsten Dunst  voices Kiki exactly the right way. The storyline is as strong as the  animation, and this video will reward multiple viewings on all levels.  Note the details in the animation, as in the dust blowing off the street  when Kiki takes off, or Kiki using her feet to bounce her off buildings  when she tries her unsteady flying skills.  Pay attention to Ursula, the  independent, strong and yet kind female artist, who manages to be a great  character and a terrific role model, as is Kiki herself, capturing the  experience of being 13 without cloying sentimentalism or straining the  imagination. Look at the town she settles in and note the details of this  mix of all the cities in the world.  Wiccans and pagans can also note that  this video presents a very positive view of witchcraft and witches, unlike  so many other movies that attempt to deal with magic.  The storyline is  involving and compelling, and oddly enough, quite realistic in the way the  characters interact and express themselves. No matter whether you're 4, 14,  24, or 40, this is an unqualifiedly great movie and a masterful work of the  animator's art.  I would recommend this movie without hesitation to anyone.

The 1:85 anamorphic widescreen picture is generally very good and the new 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is full of life.For those of us who have waited years for this film to be available on DVD the wait is over. However, a couple of problems blemish what could have been a very nice event.First and foremost, the picture runs slightly (about a 1/2 second) out-of-sync behind the sound. Many won't notice it or will blame the effect on poor dubbing. But, those (like me) who have closely watched this film on VHS will see that a sync problem does exist (at least) on Disney's initial run of Kiki's Deliver Service on DVD. Because, this film (like the other Miyazaki offerings) was carefully and successfully dubbed to avoid the dreaded lip-flap effect. Unfortunately, the problem is apparently on all three language tracks as well.Another less important (but still annoying) defect is found in the Japanese trailers that accompany this film. Most of them are mis-flagged in anamorphic and the result makes them look like they're squished in Cinemascope, when they should just be 1:85 letterboxed widescreen. They can be manually corrected, but shouldn't have to be.I do hope Disney finds it in their hearts to reissue Kiki with a fixed soundtrack in the near future as this true gem should be seen as good as it can be.At least, Miyazaki's other two recently released animes (Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky) look and sound right. Disney has done a good job of offering both English and Japanese versions in not only sound but picture as well. So, the Japanese versions contain their original titles and music tracks.

Don't get me wrong, I like it. But there isn't really a lot of story or character to make a feature length film out of.I watched the English dub with Kirsten Dunst doing the voice of Kiki and the late, great Phil Hartman doing her talking cat Jiji. Much like Sabrina The Late-Thirties Teenage Witch, Jiki is black, cynical and funny. He provides most of the film's laughs and is impossibly cute.As I have said, the film is very light.

79491,A2SAA88HCSS7RB,078881107X,Jack,"[3, 3]","Miyazaki's films never disappointed me, this one is not an exception. The movie, like Totoro, is a heartwarming one, it does not involve war, fighting, ghosts, whatsoever, which may be a disturbance to the hardcore war movie fans... but learning to appreciate different types of movies is importantThis movie is released in Japan in 1989, a fairly old film if you ask me, but the drawings are no where near the line of ""old"", the background is amazingly detailed, every brick on the roof is drawn with care and attention, which tells you how much work Miyazaki has put into this film. The characters' facial expressions are reflected perfectly with the animation, even without the voice acting, you can tell how they are feeling by looking at their faces.The story adds fantasy into reality, in an instrial world where cars and planes dominate, there are still witches and magics, which are believed to exist during the 16th century... this is past vs. present, magic vs. science scenario, but with Miyazaki's imagination, these seemingly contradicting factors melt and fuse together, giving the audience an experience they never had before... the story presents themes related to stepping into adolescence, living in a new environment independently, making new friends with a sincere heart, etc. As an environmentalist, Miyazaki also portrays the problem with polution caused by factories and car exhaustions in many parts of the film, which is a message people should understand.The voice acting in the US version is great, some anime fans that prefer original Japanese soundtracks may find the English dub sucked, but keep in mind that English and Japanese are two different languages, you cannot simply expect something in Japanese to be fully translated into English, plus with the cultural differences, what is presented in the Japanese version may not be understood by the western audiences, so a few comments and lines added into the movie in the English dub don't hurt the overall storyline. From what I heard and experienced, I can tell the voice actors in the US version have put their feelings and emotions into the film, unlike some dull dubbings such as Gundam Wing.

It is one of the simplest stories, but I think that Miyazaki tells it extremely well.  This animated movie is about a young witch who must move to another town to practice her craft as a solo apprentice witch.Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) is turning 13 years old, and it is a tradition that when a witch turns thirteen she must go out on her own to practice in another city.  She takes along her cat Jiji (Phil Hartman) and flies off on her broom to find a city by the ocean.  After seeing a little bit of the town and interacting with some townspeople, Kiki doesn't know where to go or what special skill she has.  All she can do is fly on her broom.  In exchange for minimal help around the bakery, Kiki is taken in by a kind woman named Osono (Tress MacNeille).  While living with Osono, Kiki decides that since her one skill seems to be flying on her broom she should open a delivery service.  She does, and runs it out of Osono's home and bakery.Kiki's Delivery Service is a beautiful, gentle movie about a young girl trying to find her place in the world as well as trying to figure out who she is as a witch and as a person.  As I mentioned earlier, this is my favorite of all the Miyazaki films I've seen.  It is just an easy going movie that is a lot of fun to watch, and is very engaging.  All of the English voice acting is fantastic.

My review title just says it all. The plot of the movie is benevolent, but the main thing about his movies from this period of his work is just that they are all so beautiful. This movie, and others are set in a romantic European-esque period about the turn of the last century. The buildings are stately, the people are beautiful and well dressed and for the most part well behaved, the scenery is wonderful. if I were a cartoon character this is the type of movie I would choose to inhabit too. It's just a real fairytale setting that you would imagine that a later date Cinderella would settle in, and something the polar opposite of Tim Burton.The plot is nice and fun too, with just the right ingredients, benevolent witch folk, a young witch out to make her way in the world where witches are part of the ordinary world, just like doctors or postmen. She is befriended by a friendly baker, and is given a base from where she embarks on her career and makes new friends.The dubbing is just great as well and provide just the right feel for the characters.

As a young witch coming of age, she sets out to find and make a town her own at the age of 13 along with her talking black cat.

And I owe it to this cute little gem called KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that really turned me around for the better.  It introduced me to arguably one of the greatest animators of all time, Hayao Miyazaki, who happens to be dubbed as the Walt Disney of Japan.  Having since seen virtually ALL of his films, from CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO to SPIRITED AWAY, I can see why he is such a highly acclaimed artist -- his works (and I mean every one of them) are a stroke of genius.KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE may have been my first real exposure to Miyazaki, but this happens to be the director's fifth film, which was the highest grossing movie of its year in Japan.  Adapted from a children's book by Eiko Kadono (which is to be released in America as of this writing), the film is not a typical good-versus-evil conflicted, dysfunctional story but a gentle, character-driven story with endearing characters, beautiful artistry, and a strong, positive message about confidence and independence that are quite encouraging for all, from the youngest of children to the oldest at heart.  (On a side note, it persuaded me to get some exercise!  The ""fat, fat, FAT!!!"" line did it for me.)The story is about 13-year old Kiki, an adorable witch-in-training, who, on one moonlit night, leaves her hometown to seek her independence and fortune.  She's accompanied by her wisecracking and hilarious pet black cat, Jiji, and a little wobbly when it comes to takeoffs and landings while maneuvering her broomstick.  Kiki arrives at a luxurious town with an ocean view where she eventually finds work at a bakery run by the generous Osono and her silent, gruff husband.  There, she starts a high-flying delivery service which opens up many new relationships for the budding witch -- including a friendly painter, Ursula, a kind old woman, Madame, and a boy named Tombo, who dreams of flying.The above synopsis may sound dull, but KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE certainly is not.  It is a joy to watch from start to finish as we see Kiki slowly grow up and learn to have faith in herself, especially when her powers begin to fade away toward the end of the movie.  It's engrossing enough to keep one's attention and there are a number of tear-jerking moments that make it more than just a movie.  This is a characteristic you'll only be able to find in Miyazaki, and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE ""delivers"" a wonderful movie which shows that movies don't have to be about overcoming evil or action-packed or angst-ridden to be entertaining.In 1996, Disney struck a deal with Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki's studio, to distribute the director's movies worldwide.  KIKI was their first release.  It proved to be a very successful release when it was released to video on September of 1998; it sold over a million copies in the US - a record for any Anime video.  But since then, the movie has been out of print, and there was never a DVD release.  Recently, however, Disney has given this movie its first ever DVD release in America (debuting alongside CASTLE IN THE SKY and SPIRITED AWAY).The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek of Streamline Pictures, but Disney redubbed the movie when they struck a deal with Miyazaki's Studio Studio Ghibli (for worldwide distribution of his movies, starting with this) with an all-star cast whose performances hold up well even today.  Thirteen-year-old Kirsten Dunst is perfect as Kiki, eliciting just the right touch of cuteness, spunkiness, independence, and poignancy to her role.  The other actors, which include Debbie Reynolds (Madame), Tress MacNeille - of TINY TOONS and ANIMANIACS fame - (Osono), Jeanane Garofolo (Ursula), and Matthew Lawrence (Tombo), give similarly superb performances.  Of the actors, however, it is the late Phil Hartman's witty, sarcastic take on Jiji that steals the show.  He added in some new dialogue and proved to be so good at his role that he actually expanded the character.  I swear, I just cannot get enough laughs every time I hear his lines.  (""First, don't panic!  Second, don't panic!  And THIRD, did I mention not to panic?!?"")  The opening and ending songs were replaced by two gorgeous, rollicking numbers from Sydney Forest, but even they seem to suit the story wonderful.  In fact, I find myself bouncing to them every time they pop up over the opening and closing credits of the show.Recently, however, Disney has given KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE a second DVD edition, which offers a lot more extras than its previous edition did (there's newly recorded interviews with Miyazaki and a half-hour long documentary on the locations Miyazaki and his staff visited in order to get ideas for the film's settings).  Controversially, though, the new edition also makes some significant edits to the English dub--all the extra dialogue for the dub is gone (which includes much of Hartman's one-liners for Jiji:  although one of them omitted--the last in the film which alters an important plot point--is beneficial), and so are the Forest songs.  In fact, the entire sound mix has been reverted to the original Japanese music and sound effects, but the vocals aren't as well mixed--there are times when the actors sound like they're talking into a fan.  Whether the extras warrant a double-dipping of this revised special edition is up to the customer.",5,"Beautiful, uplifting, and yes, magical.",1042675200,"01 16, 2003",2003,5418,"['used', 'believe',

My entire family - my husband, 11-year old daughter, 3-year old daughter, and me - all absolutely love Kiki. We have watched it many, many times, and it is still as fresh and cute and captivating as it was the first time.KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE is the story of a 13-year old witch-in-training (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), who, in the tradition of her people, must leave home for a year, and make her own way in the world.  She must find a new city and provide it a service.  Her mother, whose talent is potion making, serves her city as a sort of cross between a pharmacist and a doctor.  Kiki leaves her family at midnight on a beautiful, warm night with just her broom, her cat Jiji (voiced by Phil Hartman), and father's transistor radio.  Once Kiki finds the perfect city, she settles right in to help.  Since she has no special gift other than flying by use of her broom, she naturally sets up a delivery service, delivering packages and messages all over town.Kiki learns about many things over the course of the year:  responsibility, how to support herself, trust, belief in herself, loyalty, friendship, and even a first crush.  She slowly finds her own way, learning and growing as she goes.  By the end she is stronger, more sure of herself, and settled in her new community.  She has made a life, through learning life's lessons.Myazaki's animation is, as always, simply delightful.  The rich textures and delicate details bring his characters to life.  It is the little nuances that draw you in:  the way the wind tousles Kiki's hair, the expressions on Jiji's face, the depth of the background scenery.  The pallet is soft and lovely.  The entire film is quite gorgeous.As I said earlier, my entire family is enthralled by Kiki's coming of age story; none more so than my youngest daughter.  For Halloween last year (2007), she wanted to be a witch.  I asked her if she wanted to be a witch like the one in the Little Einsteins' Hansel and Gretel episode or one like Kiki. ""I want to be Kiki, Mommy! I want to be Kiki!!!""  She was very definite on that point. So she had a black dress, red shoes, a red hair bow, a small broom, and a stuffed Jiji (ordered from Japan!). She was so excited and so cute.  I think the impression that KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE made on a then 2 year old speaks volumes.  This quiet, simple story of learning to be happy with and to trust in yourself is timeless and appeals to all ages and generations.",5,"Adorable, Sweet, and Fun.

(I'll have to add Spirited Away, as soon as we get a copy after its release in April 2003.)The other two movies being Totoro, which I like better and Go Panda Go, which does not have the same quality of animation as the other two.Kiki's Delivery Service is actually complex, with something for adults and children to enjoy and to be capitivated by. Kiki struggles while trying to make her own way during the rite of passage from being a kid, to being a young adult. She's 13, (I thought, hmmm, 13 Batmitzvah age)and ready to try her wings, or in this case, her broom.No freaky witchcraft stuff here, nothing frightening or creepy. Kiki's powers seem connected with her confidence in herself and her ability to believe in herself. A great message for girls and all kids, and heck, for everybody.And the animation is amazing.

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","One of the fortuitous results of ""Spirited Away"" (""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"") winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film for the great anime director Hayao Miyazaki is that his other works are becoming readily available on DVD in the United States as well.  A case in point is ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (""Majo no takkyubin,"" literarlly ""The Witch's Express Mail""), which tells the story of Kiki O'Connell (voice by Kirsten Dunst), a young witch who has turned 13 and has to go off on her own for a year of training, accompanied only by her black cat Gigi (voiced by Phil Hartman).  ""Training"" is actually a misnomer, because what Kiki does is get on her broomstick, fly off towards the ocean and finds a beautiful European styled city that does not have a witch.  Instead of serving some sort of formal apprenticeship to an older witch, Kiki has to survive on her own, and when she helps Osono (Tress MacNeille) return a pacifier to a customer who left I behind at the bakery, she stumbles upon a job that will help her earn her way.What makes ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" work is that fact that everybody in the city accepts Kiki's presence.  It has been years since the city had a witch, and the police think she has to obey the rules just like everybody else and not cause accidents flying around on her broomstick, but everybody accepts Kiki at face value and offers her encouragement and support.  Included in this group would be Ursula (Janeane Garofalo), an artist living in the forest, Madame (Debbie Reynolds) and her housekeeper Bertha (Edie McClurg), a couple of old ladies who take a liking to the young witch, and especially Tombo (Matthew Lawrence), a young boy who would like to fly just like Kiki.  Ultimately ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is not about what others think about Kiki but rather what she thinks about herself, especially when she starts confronting the doubts of adolescence that could ground a young witch who starts doubting herself.True, this film suffers in comparison to ""Spirited Away,"" but then that is going to be true of most animated films.  The important thing is that ""Kiki's Delivery Serivces"" represents Miyazaki's vivid imagination and his painstaking attention to detail and insistence on putting in as much into each frame of animation as possible.  The result is not great, but utterly charming, which is high praise given what most animation is like even today where computers are doing too much of the heavy lifting.  Note: I am not sure if this was Phil Hartman's last work before his death, but it should be noted that his Gigi has a lot more lines than in the original Japanese version (you will notice this and other changes when you watch the film with subtitles instead of the dubbed track, which, of course, is something you always want to do with anime at some point while watching the film again).",5,There's magic in the air with Kiki's delivery service!,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,2852,"['One', 'fortuitous', 'results', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Sen', 'Chihiro', 'kamikakushi', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Film', 'great', 'anime', 'director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'other', 'works', 'are', 'becoming', 'readily', 'available', 'DVD', 'United', 'States', 'as', 'well', 'case', 'point', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Majo', 'takkyubin', 'literarlly', 'Witch', 'Express', 'Mail', 'story', 'Kiki', ""O'Connell"", 'voice', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'young', 'witch', 'who', 'turned', '13', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'year', 'training', 'accompanied', 'only', 'black', 'cat', 'Gigi', 'voiced', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'Training', 'actually', 'misnomer', 'what', 'Kiki', 'get', 'broomstick', 'fly', 'off', 'towards', 'ocean', 'beautiful', 'European', 'styled', 'city', 'not', 'have', 'witch', 'Instead', 'serving', 'sort', 'formal', 'apprenticeship', 'older', 'witch', 'Kiki', 'survive', 'own', 'when', 'Osono', 'Tress', 'MacNeille', 'return', 'pacifier', 'customer', 'who', 'left', 'behind', 'bakery', 'job', 'will', 'help', 'earn', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'work', 'fact', 'everybody', 'city', 'Kiki', 'presence', 'been', 'years', 'city', 'had', 'witch', 'police', 'think', 'obey', 'rules', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'not', 'cause', 'accidents', 'flying', 'around', 'broomstick', 'everybody', 'Kiki', 'face', 'value', 'encouragement', 'support', 'Included', 'group', 'would', 'be', 'Ursula', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'artist', 'living', 'forest', 'Madame', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'housekeeper', 'Bertha', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'couple', 'old', 'ladies', 'who', 'take', 'liking', 'young', 'witch', 'especially', 'Tombo', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'fly', 'just', 'Kiki', 'Ultimately', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'not', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'Kiki', 'rather', 'what', 'especially', 'when', 'confronting', 'doubts', 'adolescence', 'could', 'ground', 'young', 'witch', 'who', 'doubting', 'herself.True', 'film', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'then', 'going', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'animated', 'films', 'important', 'thing', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Serivces', 'Miyazaki', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'painstaking', 'attention', 'detail', 'insistence', 'putting', 'as', 'much', 'frame', 'animation', 'possible', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'utterly', 'charming', 'high', 'praise', 'given', 'what', 'most', 'animation', 'even', 'today', 'where', 'computers', 'are', 'doing', 'too', 'much', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'Note', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'last', 'work', 'death', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Gigi', 'lot', 'more', 'lines', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'will', 'notice', 'other', 'changes', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'subtitles', 'instead', 'dubbed', 'track', 'course', 'something', 'always', 'want', 'do', 'anime', 'point', 'watching', 'film', 'again']",N/A

Disney's DVD presentation gives the picture an absolutely beautiful transfer, but is extremely spare in terms of extras. The film is a wonderful family film filled with innocence and charm. Someone said cynicism is the death of art and Kiki is a breath of fresh air to the cynical sarcasm of today's entertainment. The only drawback to the film is that some might find the film a ridiculous fantasy in regard to our violent modern world. As a college student I have found it hard to sell a film to my peer that concerns a teenage witch delivering gifts to friendly townspeople. Much of my generation will be turned off by the content. Even fans of Miyazaki might be put off in the difference between Kiki and Mononoke or Spirited Away. Others including myself love the film and continue to be touched by the universal feelings and details that Miyazaki evokes.Picture quality on the DVD release is amazing. The gorgeous print of Miyazaki's breathtaking animation makes this one of the best looking DVDs in my collection. It has to be seen to be believed. The picture's aspect ratio is kept in 1:85:1, giving limited black for small tv users.I'm not a sound expert but it sounded just fine. I don't have a home theater set-up, so I can't judge the audio. The Japanese track is vastly superior if only for the original Japanese version of the catching opening and the extremely different vocal performance of Jiji. This track is not in 5.1. The english dub features several celebrities and is fine, but stick with the Japanese. I guess there is Spanish, but I don't remember it being an option on the storyboard disc. The menu design is annoying in that you cannot switch the audio or subs on the fly. You have to go back to the menu and then resume play. Yellow subs are within the frame, not in black. This is good for widescreen tvs, but on my regular tv, it tends to blend with the image and cover stuff.Extras is the weak spot on the disc. Lasseter's intros were cool the first time I heard one, but get tiring after more than one Miyazaki film. The film starts with Lasseter's comment if you change to Japanese and select &quot;resume film&quot; to start. The english cast interviews are nothing special, accept for a brief appearance of Toshio Suzuki and a very very young and cute Kirsten Dunst. Be sure to pause and catch the Jiji robe she wears in one scene!I didn't finish watching the Japanese trailers, they run one after another, mostly clips with limited Japanese ad flair. Disc Two only has the storyboarding of the whole film with both soundtracks. The storyboards are more completely drawn then other Miyasaki films, but you cannot switch angles to a film comparison which made the Spirited Away disc interesting.A total masterpiece of animation, Disney's disc has a mind blowing picture transfer with limited extras.Highly recomended.",5,DVD Review,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,2975,"['Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'masterwork', 'canon', 'greatest', 'animation', 'director', 'world', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'picture', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'transfer', 'extremely', 'spare', 'terms', 'extras', 'film', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'filled', 'innocence', 'charm', 'Someone', 'said', 'cynicism', 'death', 'art', 'Kiki', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'cynical', 'sarcasm', 'today', 'entertainment', 'only', 'drawback', 'film', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'fantasy', 'regard', 'violent', 'modern', 'world', 'college', 'student', 'have', 'found', 'hard', 'sell', 'film', 'peer', 'teenage', 'witch', 'delivering', 'gifts', 'friendly', 'townspeople', 'Much', 'generation', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'content', 'Even', 'fans', 'Miyazaki', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'difference', 'Kiki', 'Mononoke', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Others', 'including', 'love', 'film', 'continue', 'be', 'touched', 'universal', 'feelings', 'details', 'Miyazaki', 'evokes.Picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'amazing', 'gorgeous', 'print', 'Miyazaki', 'breathtaking', 'animation', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'picture', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'kept', '1:85:1', 'giving', 'limited', 'black', 'small', 'tv', 'users.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sound', 'expert', 'sounded', 'just', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'home', 'theater', 'set-up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'audio', 'Japanese', 'track', 'vastly', 'superior', 'only', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'catching', 'opening', 'extremely', 'different', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Jiji', 'track', 'not', '5.1', 'english', 'dub', 'features', 'several', 'celebrities', 'fine', 'stick', 'Japanese', 'guess', 'Spanish', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'option', 'storyboard', 'disc', 'menu', 'design', 'annoying', 'can', 'not', 'switch', 'audio', 'subs', 'fly', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'menu', 'then', 'resume', 'play', 'Yellow', 'subs', 'are', 'frame', 'not', 'black', 'good', 'widescreen', 'tvs', 'regular', 'tv', 'blend', 'image', 'cover', 'stuff.Extras', 'weak', 'spot', 'disc', 'Lasseter', 'intros', 'were', 'cool', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'one', 'get', 'tiring', 'more', 'one', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'film', 'Lasseter', 'comment', 'change', 'Japanese', 'select', 'quot', 'resume', 'film', 'quot', 'start', 'english', 'cast', 'interviews', 'are', 'nothing', 'special', 'accept', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Toshio', 'Suzuki', 'very', 'very', 'young', 'cute', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Be', 'sure', 'pause', 'catch', 'Jiji', 'robe', 'one', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'run', 'one', 'mostly', 'limited', 'Japanese', 'ad', 'flair', 'Disc', 'Two', 'only', 'storyboarding', 'whole', 'film', 'soundtracks', 'storyboards', 'are', 'more', 'completely', 'drawn', 'then', 'other', 'Miyasaki', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'switch', 'angles', 'film', 'comparison', 'made', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'interesting.A', 'total', 'masterpiece', 'animation', 'Disney', 'disc', 'mind', 'blowing', 'picture', 'transfer', 'limited', 'extras.Highly', 'recomended']",N/A

Without a doubt, it is not Miyazaki's best (to this day, among the ones I have seen, that honor goes to ""Spirited Away""). Perhaps it's not a coincidence given that it is an adaptation, instead of an original script written by him, as it is usual with him. However, this movie is far from bad. Indeed, it's just a tad less fantastic than most of his other classics, and it doesn't deal with ghosts or spirits, nor does it deal with the traditional environmental topic, which is so common in his movies.This is the story of a young witch (Kiki) who turned 13, which meant that her time to leave her parents' home had arrived, so that she could get trained. She finds the place of her dreams in a sea town which reminds every bit of small city by the French Riviera. There she wins the hearts of the townpeople and finds great uses for her magical talents.

I was understandably nervous when I heart that  Disney had optioned all of his animated films for distribution here in  North America. A part of me was even sure Disney was doing so just to keep  them out of circulation here, thereby eliminating competition for their own  animated films. I was also worried that they would a rotten job of  translating it into English by hiring second-rate actors as so many other  companies do. Case in point, Streamline's dubbing of the Nadia Secret of  Blue Water was so bad, I couldn't even watch the entire half-hour episode,  because not only did the voice acting stink, but they had changed major  portions of dialog.When I was given the chance to watch Kiki's  Delivery Service at a friends place, the fear of watching one of my  personal favorite anime movies ruined took over. But, I wasn't  disappointed, Disney had done an excellent job in their selection of actors  for the voices, including Kiki. That is, except, Phil Hartman who performs  the voice for Kiki's familiar cat, Jiji. In the original, Jiji is a male  cat with the voice of a young, often nervous girl and the voice is high  pitched for a reason. Phil Hartman? Can he do that? No, what he does is a  sort of snide, lippy New Jersey style voice, and BOOM! The character is  ruined. However, once I was past all of that I sat down to enjoy one of the  most endearing and charming films ever made.Set in the 1940's, Kiki  is a young witch, who at the age of thirteen, is now old enough to strike  out on her own and lay down roots in a new city. She says good-bye to her  mom and dad, grabs her broom, Jiji and a radio and takes off into the  night. There are some beautiful flying sequences over Italian villages and  vistas, (which would later inspire an episode of the animated Superman  cartoon show), but like many Miyazaki films, this isn't quite our earth.  Kiki arrives in a beautiful sea-side city where she sets herself delivery  goods for a local bakery where she befriends Ohsono and Barsa, who take her  in and practically adopt the little witch (Witches are often good people in  Kiki's). She also meets a boy her own age named Tombo, who is as smitten  with her as he is with the fact that she can fly on her own. However,  Kiki's inexperience with people, especially the opposite sex causes her  behave in ways she isn't used to-suffice it to say she doesn't treat Tombo  very well.Two things that will strike anyone watching this film;  first, there is no villain who has a massive plot to do something nefarious  and second, there is no violence-no guns, no people getting killed, and  instead the film relies on a zeppelin accident as the focus of the story  and the trigger for Kiki's return. One of the film's overriding themes is  being true to oneself, which Kiki fails to do as she rebuffs Tombo's boyish  advances, and as a result she loses her magical powers after she comes down  with a cold. And when Tombo goes to see the zeppelin and becomes ensnared  in a tether when it breaks free of its moorings, Kiki must overcome her  fears-both of others and of the feelings she has for him to get her magic  back.Like all Miyazaki films there is much within the movie that I  haven't mentioned, because I don't want to spoil all of the fun. It is the  sort of film that everyone can watch, can marvel at and enjoy. The  interplay between Kiki and Jiji is endearing, the other characters, such as  Ursula and Ohsono the artist, are charming and memorable. The world in  which they live is rich-lavishly depicted in stunning detail as only  Miyazaki can while the music has a melodic and playful feel to it. Kiki  herself is every bit a strong female character who grows and changes and I  found her similar to Nadia (Secret of Blue Water).

Based upon a book written by Eiko Kadono, the film was originally titled &quot;Majo no takkyubin&quot;, which translates literally as &quot;The Witches Express Mail&quot;.  As the original implies, the film is about a young, 13-year-old witch named Kiki, who, like all other witches in the story, is required to spend one year away from home and live an independent life.  At the beginning of the film, Kiki (whose English voice was done by Kirsten Dunst) is still at home and very excited about her impending year away.  On the night of the full moon, Kiki decides that it is time to leave.  Her parents (voices done by Kath Soucie and Jeff Bennett) watch Kiki rise into the air upon her broomstick with her talking black cat Jiji (voice of Phil Hartman, 1948-1998) and travel to a city along the ocean.  There, Kiki eventually finds a place to live: a bakery owned by Osono (voice of Tress MacNeille), where she starts her own delivery service.  Along the way, Kiki meets an artist named Ursula (voice of Janeane Garofalo), a boy named Tombo (voice of Matthew Lawrance) and an elderly woman named Miss Dora (voice of Debbie Reynolds).Like many of Miyazaki's films, there is no &quot;bad guy&quot; in &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;, but there are some exciting moments and the story tends to focus on self-discovery and interpersonal relationships.  The film is very charming and is sure to entertain any child that watches it and adults will more than likely enjoy it too.  The quality of animation isn't quite as spectacular as in Miyasaki's later animated films, but like looking at paintings by the same artist, &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; is in Miyasaki's beautiful artistic style.

79540,A1WX42M589VAMQ,078881107X,Mir,"[0, 0]","Kiki's Delivery Service has the same sort of optimistic delightfulness as that other much-beloved and much-praised Miyazaki offering, My Neighbor Totoro. It has a way of making you not only wish you were young again, but it actually makes you feel as if a few years (or decades) have fallen away and the world is all shiny again, and so are you.There is no villain. There is no terrible abuse or viciousness. This is a totally sparkly story of a young witch who is sent from home to get her training, which means traveling to a new town and living there for a year. (To some, that might sound rather harsh, like child labor or a dangerous lack of parenting wisdom.) You have to surrender yourself to the idea of this rite of passage, and that Kiki will be all right.She ends up with her cat, her radio, her purple witch's dress, her mother's trusty broom, in a new city, where she befriends a kindly bakery shop owner who lets her live in the attic. From there, Kiki embarks on a delivery service, taking packages on her broom. The story follows that journey in setting up her business and learning about her capabilities and flaws, as wella as her new city world.The magic is in the details of both the story and the artwork. The city is beautifully done, and the city feels like a welcoming European city, with some buildings as stately and rich as Viennese jewels and others having a more Mediterranean seaside feel. It's a city that you'd want to visit, and the artwork makes it accessible. The sky takes on astounding colors and depth at times. Small details of characterization in expression and movement--in both humans and animals--or in the setting--a bit of grocery that falls to the floor, the way toes are depicted--add to the richness and are so charming.And Kiki's a typical 13 year old of a more innocent age--she can be hasty, emotional, enthusiastic, helpful, worried about fashion, respectful of elders, and she is inately good and kind and industrious. (Miyazaki's films seem to uphold the value of kindness, compassion, and hard work quite a bit.) She finds out things about her own abilities, and she makes friends.Kirsten Dunst does a terrific job of voicing Kiki, and the tone has the ebullience and girlishness that's perfect for the characer. The late Phil Hartman is an amusing black cat familiar.It's a gentle story, but it's never boring. Even my 47 year old engineer husband found it a fun, sweet, watchable tale.There is this enveloping magic that I've found in Mr. Miyazaki's movies, whether it's My Neighbor Totoro or Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, there is something in the combination of story and character and artwork that makes you feel the wonder again of being young and diverted by the adventures in magical worlds where good, ultimately, wins out over bad.This is the sort of film parents and kids can treasure together. And if you've seen or read or heard too many dark and terrible things, this is the sort of movie that restores a bit of youthful innocence.Highly Recommended.",5,"Fresh, Lovely, Humorous, Uplifting: Another Miyazaki Delight",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,3028,"['Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'same', 'sort', 'optimistic', 'delightfulness', 'other', 'much-beloved', 'much-praised', 'Miyazaki', 'offering', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'way', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'young', 'again', 'actually', 'feel', 'few', 'years', 'decades', 'have', 'fallen', 'away', 'world', 'shiny', 'again', 'so', 'are', 'villain', 'terrible', 'abuse', 'viciousness', 'totally', 'sparkly', 'story', 'young', 'witch', 'who', 'sent', 'home', 'get', 'training', 'traveling', 'new', 'town', 'living', 'there', 'year', 'might', 'sound', 'rather', 'harsh', 'child', 'labor', 'dangerous', 'lack', 'parenting', 'wisdom', 'have', 'surrender', 'idea', 'rite', 'passage', 'Kiki', 'will', 'be', 'right.She', 'up', 'cat', 'radio', 'purple', 'witch', 'dress', 'mother', 'trusty', 'broom', 'new', 'city', 'where', 'kindly', 'bakery', 'shop', 'owner', 'who', 'live', 'attic', 'there', 'Kiki', 'delivery', 'service', 'taking', 'packages', 'broom', 'story', 'journey', 'setting', 'up', 'business', 'learning', 'capabilities', 'flaws', 'as', 'wella', 'new', 'city', 'world.The', 'magic', 'details', 'story', 'artwork', 'city', 'beautifully', 'done', 'city', 'feels', 'welcoming', 'European', 'city', 'buildings', 'stately', 'rich', 'Viennese', 'jewels', 'others', 'having', 'more', 'Mediterranean', 'seaside', 'feel', 'city', ""'d"", 'want', 'visit', 'artwork', 'accessible', 'sky', 'astounding', 'colors', 'depth', 'times', 'Small', 'details', 'characterization', 'expression', 'movement', 'humans', 'animals', 'setting', 'bit', 'grocery', 'floor', 'way', 'toes', 'are', 'depicted', 'add', 'richness', 'are', 'so', 'charming.And', 'Kiki', 'typical', '13', 'year', 'old', 'more', 'innocent', 'age', 'can', 'be', 'hasty', 'emotional', 'enthusiastic', 'helpful', 'worried', 'fashion', 'respectful', 'elders', 'inately', 'good', 'kind', 'industrious', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'seem', 'uphold', 'value', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'hard', 'work', 'quite', 'bit', 'out', 'things', 'own', 'abilities', 'friends.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'terrific', 'job', 'voicing', 'Kiki', 'tone', 'ebullience', 'girlishness', 'perfect', 'characer', 'late', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'amusing', 'black', 'cat', 'familiar.It', 'gentle', 'story', 'never', 'boring', 'Even', '47', 'year', 'old', 'engineer', 'husband', 'found', 'fun', 'sweet', 'watchable', 'enveloping', 'magic', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Mr.', 'Miyazaki', 'movies', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'something', 'combination', 'story', 'character', 'artwork', 'feel', 'wonder', 'again', 'being', 'young', 'diverted', 'adventures', 'magical', 'worlds', 'where', 'good', 'ultimately', 'out', 'bad.This', 'sort', 'film', 'parents', 'kids', 'can', 'treasure', 'together', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'read', 'heard', 'too', 'many', 'dark', 'terrible', 'things', 'sort', 'movie', 'bit', 'youthful', 'innocence.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

ALSO THIS END PART HASNT BEEN DIGITALLY MASTERED AS YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE LOTS OF GRAINS AND POOR PICTURE QUALITY!!!!lets now look at the extras given in this so called ""2disc special edition"" release.it would have been really sensible to add the storyboards of the film on the first disc alongwith the film. giving one disc extra just for the boards doesnt make any sense, that too when there's no angle feature given to switch between the film and boards.other ""extras"" on disc one include the ever annoying jahn lasseter's introduction, which you just cant skip and have to bear everytime you see the film. WHAT A TORTURE, INDEED!!! another extra ""behind the microphone"", features the actors behind the english language track. it has absolutely nothing to do with the making of the film. that too after listening to the terrible english language track, i'm sure none would be interested in knowing how it was done.it would have been highly appreciated, if disney had included some real good old stuff showing studio ghibli and miyazaki san work!! something like ""nippon tv special"" which they have included in the extras of spirited away dvd. or at least the same feature on ""the painting of ursula' which is available on the japanese dvd release of this film by buena vista itself.also, watching it in japanese was a real pain as the menus are not quite user friendly. this was never expected from a buena vista dvd. come on disney, grow up! we all know you can never produce something like this or anything that studio ghibli has ever done. insulting these films wont help. its about time the people at disney learnt a lesson or two to respect and honour studio ghibli-miyazaki films rather than just showing off on their own disney special edition dvds (mr lasseter listening??).lastly here's a very small suggestion for mr john lasseter. if you are so madly in love with yourself, you dont have to show up on every ghibli film that disney releases. disney releases enough of their own titles that can fulfill your desire to be on camera. you dont have to ruin every such film and the viewer's mood right at the very beginning.",3,SOMEONE SAVE ME FROM JOHN LASSETER!!!!!!!!!!!!,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,3666,"['first', 'let', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'NOT', 'review', 'film', 'kiki', 'delivery', 'service', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'five', 'stars', 'dvd', 'certainly', 'couldnt', 'believe', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'kiki', 'original', 'japanese', 'version', 'quite', 'sometime', 'i', 'was', 'absolutely', 'delighted', 'get', 'region1', 'dvd', 'english', 'track', 'watching', 'beautifully', 'dubbed', 'princess', 'mononoke', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'were', 'shattered', 'very', 'moment', 'started', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'words', 'see', 'sub', 'par-dvd', 'release', 'such', 'great', 'film', 'greatest', 'animation', 'director', 'hayao', 'miyazaki', 'what', 'insult', 'character', 'jiji', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'english', 'voice', 'just', 'didnt', 'make', 'sense', 'watching', 'japanese', 'additional', 'dialogues', 'given', 'were', 'rather', 'annoying.i', 'never', 'expected', 'one', 'big', 'blow', 'came', 'watching', 'japanese', 'track', 'YES', 'disney', 'even', 'changed', 'song', 'end', 'credits', 'japanese', 'tune', 'new', 'song', 'been', 'matched', 'same', 'terrible', 'pop', 'song', 'disney', 'used', 'english', 'track', 'was', 'sheer', 'disappointment', 'i', 'was', 'so', 'madly', 'fond', 'original', 'japanese', 'song', 'played', 'end', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'japanese', 'version', 'know', 'what', 'i', ""'m"", 'talking', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'disney', 'got', 'recomposed', 'remember', 'what', 'did', 'english', 'track', 'laputa', 'castle', 'sky', 'even', 'japanese', 'version', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'english', 'too', 'ALSO', 'THIS', 'END', 'PART', 'HASNT', 'BEEN', 'DIGITALLY', 'MASTERED', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'CLEARLY', 'SEE', 'LOTS', 'OF', 'GRAINS', 'AND', 'POOR', 'PICTURE', 'QUALITY', 'lets', 'now', 'look', 'extras', 'given', 'so', 'called', '2disc', 'special', 'edition', 'release.it', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'sensible', 'add', 'storyboards', 'film', 'first', 'disc', 'film', 'giving', 'one', 'disc', 'extra', 'just', 'boards', 'doesnt', 'make', 'sense', 'too', 'when', 'angle', 'feature', 'given', 'switch', 'film', 'boards.other', 'extras', 'disc', 'one', 'include', 'ever', 'annoying', 'jahn', 'lasseter', 'introduction', 'just', 'cant', 'skip', 'have', 'bear', 'everytime', 'see', 'film', 'WHAT', 'TORTURE', 'INDEED', 'extra', 'microphone', 'actors', 'english', 'language', 'track', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'making', 'film', 'too', 'listening', 'terrible', 'english', 'language', 'track', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'none', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'how', 'was', 'done.it', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'highly', 'appreciated', 'disney', 'had', 'included', 'real', 'good', 'old', 'stuff', 'showing', 'studio', 'ghibli', 'miyazaki', 'san', 'work', 'something', 'nippon', 'tv', 'special', 'have', 'included', 'extras', 'spirited', 'away', 'dvd', 'least', 'same', 'feature', 'painting', 'ursula', 'available', 'japanese', 'dvd', 'release', 'film', 'buena', 'vista', 'itself.also', 'watching', 'japanese', 'was', 'real', 'pain', 'menus', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'user', 'friendly', 'was', 'never', 'expected', 'buena', 'vista', 'dvd', 'come', 'disney', 'grow', 'up', 'know', 'can', 'never', 'produce', 'something', 'anything', 'studio', 'ghibli', 'ever', 'done', 'insulting', 'films', 'wont', 'help', 'time', 'people', 'disney', 'learnt', 'lesson', 'two', 'respect', 'honour', 'studio', 'ghibli-miyazaki', 'films', 'rather', 'just', 'showing', 'off', 'own', 'disney', 'special', 'edition', 'dvds', 'mr', 'lasseter', 'listening', '.lastly', 'here', 'very', 'small', 'suggestion', 'mr', 'john', 'lasseter', 'are', 'so', 'madly', 'love', 'dont', 'have', 'show', 'up', 'ghibli', 'film', 'disney', 'releases', 'disney', 'own', 'titles', 'can', 'fulfill', 'desire', 'be', 'camera', 'dont', 'have', 'ruin', 'such', 'film', 'viewer', 'mood', 'right', 'very', 'beginning']",N/A

Although I recognize it as a good form of art and I often admire some of the illustrations I've seen, it's just never been my thing. TV series such as Pokemon just make me roll my eyes and I find the more adult-oriented programs to be a bit too violent. Since I had never really liked the anime I've been exposed to, I thought that I wouldn't be into any kind of anime. Kiki's delivery service proved this little theory wrong.Kiki is a witch and like all witches, at 13 she decides to leave home and create a life for herself using her magic. Unfortunately things don't go as smoothly as she plans. When it comes to flying on her broom she's not too good at landings and takeoffs. People aren't all that accepting of witches away from home. And she doesn't have any real special talents as a witch, besides of course flying. Still she had her little black cat Jiji, are going to hit it big. She comes up with the idea of creating a delivery service where she will fly deliveries on her broom. This of course is easier said then done. And as she fumbles through her delivers Kiki faces other problems. She's dealing with her first crush on a unique boy named Tombo that lives in the city she's come to. And she's also dealing with the fact that, as a witch, she doesn't really fit in with the rest of the kids her age. What will happen to Kiki?I've always been a fan of kids movies and I found Kiki's delivery service to be great. The idea is original and I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the things that inspired JK Rowling to create the wizard phenomenon, Quidditch. The characters are all very amusing, especially Jiji the black cat. I'm not sure if I will ever really get into anime, like I said it's not really my thing, but I wouldn't say no to seeing another film by this talented director Hayao Miyazaki.

79548,A38RF06HMSYVLO,078881107X,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[4, 19]","I first became aware of this movie in the late ninties.  I never had a chance to see it, but always intended too.  With the new Disney release, and a new daughter in the family, I decided to give it a try.  I have to say however, I found it wanting.I'll give a little background on the story w/o spoiling too much.The film centers around Kiki, a young teenaged witch in training, who must leave her family to develope her skills further.  She sets off on her broom with her talking cat Jiji and settles down in a big city.  While in the city Kiki realizes she dosn't have any skills other than flying on her broom. By chance she stumbles into the business of delivery, where her one skill comes in handy.  During the couse of the film, she makes deliveries and a couple of new friends, but becomes discouraged because she is not well off like some of the other girls in town.  She also has a boy chasing after her whom she ignores at first due to her feeling of self-conscienceness.  She also begins to loose her witche's abilities of flying on brooms and being able to understand her cat.She diverts her attention to regaining her skills with little succes, until her new boyfriend needs help.  Rescuing him brings her skills back to her, and she becomes comfortable with herself again.Well Kiki's Delivery Service was a good idea in theory, but in execution it had some problems.  For one, Kiki is a witch.  But in this film it's treated more like an aside. As if that were an everyday occurance.  Her reasoning for leaving home, and blindly adventuring into a new big city is never really explained to a suitable end.  It's as if she has to leave with no plan or idea of what she is supposed to be doing.  The characters and situations help the story somewhat, but never to an engrossing level.  I never really felt a genuine concern for Kiki or her situation.  And just when the movie seems like it should pick up into something dramatic, (like Kiki loosing her powers) it falls flat.It also seemed to me like Miyazaki had an idea to make a film about a witch delivering things and tried to build a film around it, but never brings it to a strong conclusion.  He'd have been better off exploring the aspect of Kiki being a witch and how that played a storng role in her life instead.The tech aspects on the disc include the original Japanese, an English, and a Spanish language track.  It's in wide screen and has some behind the scenes interviews with Kirsten Dunst (Kiki) and Phil Hartmam.Overall I gave the film two stars because Miyazaki did a good job with the animation for an older film. (1989) I'm also glad that Disney is putting out quality versions of his films with widescreen and a few features.I'd say this film is one of Miyasaki's weaker prodcutions though.

Like so many of the great Japanese film directors, Miyazaki's films achieve a contemplative beauty. There is an almost Zen like quality to the way in which he patiently allows his images to unfold. One event flows seamlessly to the next without the slightest trace of artifice. Miyazaki's unwillingness to rush the narrative allows the audience to share in Kiki's journey of self discovery.

Much of the reason for this has to do with Hayao Miyazaki, whose films are for the most part some of the best stuff being released in any country in any genre, and have been for twenty years. Dismissing Miyazaki as simply a fantasist or an anime director (or, in cases like this, a director of kids' movies) is fair neither to the man or to his films; there is far more to the average Miyazaki film than meets the eye. Kiki's Delivery Service, my fourth journey into the wonderful world of Miyazaki, continues the trend.The tone of this film is lighter than that of Spirited Away, but don't let that fool you. Kiki, a witch in training, goes off for a year to study on her own and learn the ways of the world (a common rite of passage for witches in the world of this film, it would seem). Along with her talking cat Gigi (hmm, wonder where the Sabrina the Teenage Witch folks got the idea?), Kiki flies into a town that has been witchless for enough time that the locals have mostly learned to be suspicious of them. Kiki has to figure out how to worm her way into their acceptance, as well as deal with a nervous suitor, set up a business, and watch out for crows (you'll understand when you see it). That Miyazaki's take on prejudice is subtle and light-hearted makes it no less valid than in ""serious"" films (and because Miyazaki works it into the story, in fact, it's more valuable than many of those), etc.Excellent stuff. Those who would pass off anime as ""just kid stuff"" may be better off starting with the obviously adult-themed Grave of the Fireflies, but this is one to watch relatively early on in the process. ****",4,"Miyazaki delivers, as usual.",1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,1753,"['Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', '1989', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'record', 'turning', 'out', 'top-quality', 'films', 'Much', 'reason', 'do', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'best', 'stuff', 'being', 'released', 'country', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'twenty', 'years', 'Dismissing', 'Miyazaki', 'simply', 'fantasist', 'anime', 'director', 'cases', 'director', 'kids', 'movies', 'fair', 'neither', 'man', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'average', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'eye', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'fourth', 'journey', 'wonderful', 'world', 'Miyazaki', 'trend.The', 'tone', 'film', 'lighter', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'Kiki', 'witch', 'training', 'year', 'study', 'own', 'learn', 'ways', 'world', 'common', 'rite', 'passage', 'witches', 'world', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'talking', 'cat', 'Gigi', 'hmm', 'wonder', 'where', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', 'folks', 'got', 'idea', 'Kiki', 'town', 'been', 'witchless', 'enough', 'time', 'locals', 'have', 'mostly', 'learned', 'be', 'suspicious', 'Kiki', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'worm', 'way', 'acceptance', 'as', 'well', 'deal', 'nervous', 'suitor', 'set', 'up', 'business', 'watch', 'out', 'crows', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'when', 'see', 'Miyazaki', 'take', 'prejudice', 'subtle', 'light-hearted', 'less', 'valid', 'serious', 'films', 'Miyazaki', 'story', 'fact', 'more', 'valuable', 'many', 'etc.Excellent', 'stuff', 'who', 'would', 'pass', 'off', 'anime', 'just', 'kid', 'stuff', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'starting', 'obviously', 'adult-themed', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'one', 'watch', 'relatively', 'early', 'process', '****']",N/A

And indeed it was.The beautiful and cute 13-year old girl, Kiki, runs a delivery service by using her magical power to fly after she leaves her home to train for a year with her cat, Gigi. The setup is similiar to the novel of the same name(which is now available in america), but the events that occur are quite different. For instance, Kiki never loses her power in the novel, nor does the blimp scenario ever happen in the novel either.But that doesn't keep this movie from being a good film. Hayao Miyazaki usually takes different stories and molds them into a different sort, sometimes making them better. This is one of those cases, in my opinion. As for the DVD, it includes the japanese version(finally!), which has its' differences from the english one. Namely, the music. There are long moments of silence, which work really well in some parts. Though Disney went and added some new musical pieces and piano solos. They even REPLACED some of the old music too! The only thing they added that I liked was the music that was put in when Kiki goes into a forest in search of the cat toy. It made the atmosphere more mysterious.I enjoyed listening to Disney's newly added songs to the opening and ending credits, though I love the japanese ones better. As for the voice acting, I thought all of the English voices were good. Though I'm a bit mixed on the new direction gave to Gigi's character. I'm fond of the sarcastic, witty Gigi that Phil Hartmen portrays, but then again I also like the japanese 'feminine' sounding voice too. 'Tis a tradition in most animes to give the sidekick animal character that sortof voice (ala Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, etc.). I loved Kirsten Dunst as Kiki's voice; she managed to sound just about as cute and bubbly as the original. Ursula sounded OK, but it would've been nice if Disney gave her a lighter, sweeter sounding voice like in the japanese version.Either way, I suggest you get this DVD if you love anime, or a good story. Adults CAN enjoy this as well as kids, if they have an open mind about it. Heck, the superb animation is enough of a reason to see this. That, and Kiki herself. ;)",5,Quite the charming tale!,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2458,"['Ever', 'first', 'saw', 'film', '1998', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'story', 'girl', 'experiences', 'delivery', 'girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'exciting', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'directed', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'produced', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'thought', ""'What"", 'heck', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'indeed', 'beautiful', 'cute', '13-year', 'old', 'girl', 'Kiki', 'delivery', 'service', 'using', 'magical', 'power', 'fly', 'home', 'train', 'year', 'cat', 'Gigi', 'setup', 'similiar', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'now', 'available', 'america', 'events', 'occur', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'instance', 'Kiki', 'never', 'power', 'novel', 'blimp', 'scenario', 'ever', 'happen', 'novel', 'either.But', ""n't"", 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'good', 'film', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'usually', 'different', 'stories', 'molds', 'different', 'sort', 'sometimes', 'making', 'better', 'one', 'cases', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'japanese', 'version', 'finally', 'differences', 'english', 'one', 'Namely', 'music', 'are', 'long', 'moments', 'silence', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'parts', 'Though', 'Disney', 'went', 'added', 'new', 'musical', 'pieces', 'piano', 'solos', 'even', 'REPLACED', 'old', 'music', 'too', 'only', 'thing', 'added', 'liked', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'put', 'when', 'Kiki', 'forest', 'search', 'cat', 'toy', 'made', 'atmosphere', 'more', 'mysterious.I', 'enjoyed', 'listening', 'Disney', 'newly', 'added', 'songs', 'opening', 'ending', 'credits', 'love', 'japanese', 'ones', 'better', 'voice', 'acting', 'thought', 'English', 'voices', 'were', 'good', ""'m"", 'bit', 'mixed', 'new', 'direction', 'gave', 'Gigi', 'character', ""'m"", 'fond', 'sarcastic', 'witty', 'Gigi', 'Phil', 'Hartmen', 'portrays', 'then', 'again', 'also', 'like', 'japanese', ""'feminine"", 'sounding', 'voice', 'too', 'tradition', 'most', 'animes', 'give', 'sidekick', 'animal', 'character', 'sortof', 'voice', 'ala', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'etc.', 'loved', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Kiki', 'voice', 'managed', 'sound', 'just', 'about', 'cute', 'bubbly', 'original', 'Ursula', 'sounded', 'OK', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'Disney', 'gave', 'lighter', 'sweeter', 'sounding', 'voice', 'japanese', 'version.Either', 'way', 'suggest', 'get', 'DVD', 'love', 'anime', 'good', 'story', 'Adults', 'CAN', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'Heck', 'superb', 'animation', 'enough', 'reason', 'see', 'Kiki']",N/A

Yes, the animation quality is remarkable;  in this as in other high-quality Japanese animated features, the background artists  transcend prettiness and achieve real beauty.One thing that other  reviewers have not said, which I would like to emphasize, is that this is a  particularly wonderful film for girls.  As we all know, the pattern of  traditional movie making is that heroes are always boys or men;  and even  when a female hero gets the spotlight, she is often the *only* female  character of any significance.  What makes Kiki magically different is the  presence of strong supporting female characters -- of all ages -- who play  essential roles in Kiki's story:  not just her Mom, but delightful  strangers who become good friends.Another point that distinguishes KDS  from other kid films is the clever &quot;surprise&quot; treatment of  traditionally scary situations.  I can't comment in detail without spoiling  some plot delights, but the essential message of KDS is that appearances  are deceptive, and that things are seldom as frightening (or as simple) as  they seem.  Many stereotypical &quot;frightening&quot; situations get  turned on their heads.  It's not only a sweet and lovable story, but a real  confidence-builder for little girls!  And what a healthy antidote, for  little boys, to the damaging diet of violent video games and films in which  girls and women are just scenery (or prizes).The theme of *respect*  which was developed in Totoro recurs in Kiki and demonstrates clearly that  children's films do not need to be loud, violent, sexist, crass, and  mindless to entertain kids.  The makers of Kiki have a higher opinion of  kids than that -- respect, in fact, for their audience.  What a concept.",5,Best Kid's Movie Ever?

79574,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,078881107X,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 4]","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is based on a series of children's stories by Eiko Kadono. Kiki is a thirteen-year-old witch, and must go out into the world to begin her training. Her mother is also a witch, a vanishing breed. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) and her black cat Jiji (voiced by Phil Hartman) set out to find a town to call their very own. After a disheartening evening of meeting up with a snooty witch-in-training and getting caught flying in a thunderstorm, the pair wakes up to a sunny day and new adventures.Kiki finds herself in Koriko, a beautiful seaside city modeled after Europe's genteel capitals, and in the capable, grateful hands of Osono, a pregnant baker. Her new talent seems to be delivering items on her broomstick, and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is born. Kiki and Jiji take up lodgings at the bakery and soon are delivering every sort of item imaginable, from fish pies to stuffed cats to heavy boxes, and naturally, get into scrapes along the way. Young Jeff is fascinated by Kiki and her ability to fly (he is in a young pilots' club), and the two begin a bashful courtship of sorts. But one day, Kiki finds that her magical powers are fading--she can no longer fly or talk to Jiji....Many of Miyazaki's films feature strong female heroines, and Kiki is no exception. From Kiki's mother mixing potions, to Osono's successful bakery, to Ursula's career as a female artist and Kiki's own quest for independence, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" promotes a message of ""girl power"" and believing in oneself that makes it a good role model for young girls. Part of Kiki's charm is her awkwardness at becoming a teenager, and her magical troubles stem from self-doubt that, when corrected, finds her in flying form once again.Beautiful artwork, an old world musical score full of Parisian accordion and European charm, and a timeless story are enhanced by Disney's choice of A-list actors for the English dub (Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman, Janeane Garofalo). DVD comes in English, Spanish, and the original Japanese dub (with two choices of subtitles: the literal translation and the captions used in the English version), along with several extras (original Japanese trailers, ""Behind the Microphone"" with John Lasseter).",5,This film is an absolute charmer!,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2243,"['Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'based', 'series', 'children', 'stories', 'Eiko', 'Kadono', 'Kiki', 'thirteen-year-old', 'witch', 'must', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'begin', 'training', 'mother', 'also', 'witch', 'vanishing', 'breed', 'Kiki', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'black', 'cat', 'Jiji', 'voiced', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'town', 'call', 'very', 'own', 'disheartening', 'evening', 'meeting', 'up', 'snooty', 'witch-in-training', 'getting', 'caught', 'flying', 'thunderstorm', 'pair', 'up', 'sunny', 'day', 'new', 'adventures.Kiki', 'Koriko', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'city', 'modeled', 'Europe', 'genteel', 'capitals', 'capable', 'grateful', 'hands', 'Osono', 'pregnant', 'baker', 'new', 'talent', 'be', 'delivering', 'items', 'broomstick', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'born', 'Kiki', 'Jiji', 'take', 'up', 'lodgings', 'bakery', 'soon', 'are', 'delivering', 'sort', 'item', 'imaginable', 'fish', 'pies', 'stuffed', 'cats', 'heavy', 'boxes', 'naturally', 'get', 'scrapes', 'way', 'Young', 'Jeff', 'fascinated', 'Kiki', 'ability', 'fly', 'young', 'pilots', 'club', 'two', 'begin', 'bashful', 'courtship', 'sorts', 'one', 'day', 'Kiki', 'magical', 'powers', 'are', 'fading', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'fly', 'talk', 'Jiji', '.Many', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'feature', 'strong', 'female', 'heroines', 'Kiki', 'exception', 'Kiki', 'mother', 'mixing', 'potions', 'Osono', 'successful', 'bakery', 'Ursula', 'career', 'female', 'artist', 'Kiki', 'own', 'quest', 'independence', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'message', 'girl', 'power', 'believing', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'young', 'girls', 'Part', 'Kiki', 'charm', 'awkwardness', 'becoming', 'teenager', 'magical', 'troubles', 'stem', 'self-doubt', 'when', 'corrected', 'flying', 'form', 'once', 'again.Beautiful', 'artwork', 'old', 'world', 'musical', 'score', 'full', 'Parisian', 'accordion', 'European', 'charm', 'timeless', 'story', 'are', 'enhanced', 'Disney', 'choice', 'A-list', 'actors', 'English', 'dub', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'DVD', 'English', 'Spanish', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'two', 'choices', 'subtitles', 'literal', 'translation', 'captions', 'used', 'English', 'version', 'several', 'extras', 'original', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'Microphone', 'John', 'Lasseter']",N/A

However, I rank this at the top of the list of children's films I have seen (a long list, with a 3 year old!), for a myriad of reasons.  It is appropriate for even the youngest kids, although its gorgeous animation style and well-paced story will keep adults intrigued as well.The 13 year old witch Kiki must, in accordance with tradition, set out for a year on her own to hone a special witching skill.  She departs her hometown and her family with her best friend, the traditional black cat Jiji, and finds herself in a seaside city that is reminiscent of both Europe and Japan.  This acultural locale is just the first of dozens of breathtaking imaginative achievements; Kiki faces trials along the way that are neither fantastical nor pedestrian.  If you accept Miyazaki's universe at its face value, nothing that happens in the film seems the least bit unlikely.Owning the film on DVD really opened my eyes - both to the incredible detail in the art, and to the original film as compared to its Disney-produced American version.  Kirsten Dunst and Phil Hartman provide the voices of Kiki and Jiji in the American version, and they both do extremely well - but the ""traveler and sidekick"" Disney formula has been applied to something where it did not originally exist!  I saw the film first on the Disney channel and thoroughly enjoyed Hartman's performance as the somewhat neurotic Jiji.  However, the DVD contains the original Japanese language track with English subtitles, and the Jiji of Miyazaki's film is a calm and sparingly-employed counterfoil to Kiki's experiences.  Note how rarely Jiji is in the frame when Hartman is speaking, or the occasional cases where Jiji speaks but his mouth does not move - all additions of Disney.One of the most beautiful things about this film in its original version is its willingness to be silent - to be about a young girl and her cat, alone in a new place, without a constant patter of dialogue. They are allowed to simply ""be"".  Later adaptations of Miyazaki's work for American audiences have been more respectful of this element of his stories.

Along the way, through her challenge of temporarily losing her power to fly she discovers that the key to her power lies in trusting her spirit and believing in herself.

But before I do, I'd like to pay tribute to the great Japanese director.If I think about my favorite directors, Miyazaki would be high on the list. He might not be number one, but he's probably brought me more pure joy than any other director. Miyazaki has 11 features to his credit as a director, along with several shorts and TV series. He's also written screenplays for other Studio Ghibli directors, including Whisper of the Heart, From Up on Poppy Hill and The Secret World of Arrietty.All of those movies have the unmistakable Miyazaki feel. His films usually feature strong female characters, elements of fantasy, and a feeling of innocence and purity that is lacking in animated films from other studios. I'm happy that he can finally enjoy his retirement, but I'm sad that the upcoming The Wind Rises will be his last film.But let's talk about Kiki's Delivery Service.Although my favorite Studio Ghibli title changes depending on my mood, Kiki's Delivery Service is one of several titles from the studio that I would rate as perfect. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) is a 13-year-old witch who is about to leave home for one year to further her training. She takes Jiji (Phil Hartman), her black cat, and finds a town where she can settle. Her mother makes potions, but Kiki is unsure what services she will provide, until an opportunity presents itself. She returns a pacifier to a young mother and realizes that she can make her living by flying all over town to deliver other items.Like most Ghibli worlds, the people in Kiki's new town are kind and generous. She's given a place to stay by Osono (MacNeille), who runs the local bakery. In return, she'll mind the store on occasion and deliver things for its customers. The locals are all impressed by her ability to fly, but it's her character that eventually charms most of them. She's simply a good person, and everyone she comes into contact with likes her.One boy. Tombo (Matthew Lawrence) develops a crush the moment he sees her, and tries to get to know her better as the story progresses. Like Hayao Miyazaki, Tombo has a fascination with flying. He's trying to build a machine that will do just that, and he's eager to show his work to Kiki.There are no villains of any kind, but the story does contain moments of peril. However, I would recommend Kiki's Delivery Service to anyone, whether they are four years old or over 80. It's the kind of movie that will make you smile right from the start, and keep delighting you throughout the 103 minutes. Phil Hartman has most of the best lines, and some of his remarks provide the funniest moments.I recently loaned the movie to a friend and her 5-year-old insisted on watching it three times. As soon as I got it back, I was compelled to watch it again myself.There is no North American Blu-ray at the time of writing, but you can import it from Japan if you require a Region A disc. It's also available in other parts of the world, including the UK (Region B locked). I suspect a North American release will happen next summer.I'll close by thanking Hayao Miyazaki for Kiki's Delivery Service and the many other memorable titles he has been involved with. I can't imagine another animation studio coming close to his lofty achievements.Overall score 5/5",5,One of many perfect films from Studio Ghibli,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,3401,"['day', 'learned', 'impending', 'retirement', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'wanted', 'take', 'time', 'review', 'yet', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'title', 'do', ""'d"", 'like', 'pay', 'tribute', 'great', 'Japanese', 'director.If', 'think', 'favorite', 'directors', 'Miyazaki', 'would', 'be', 'high', 'list', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'number', 'one', 'probably', 'brought', 'more', 'pure', 'joy', 'other', 'director', 'Miyazaki', '11', 'features', 'credit', 'director', 'several', 'shorts', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'written', 'screenplays', 'other', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'directors', 'including', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty.All', 'movies', 'have', 'unmistakable', 'Miyazaki', 'feel', 'films', 'usually', 'feature', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'elements', 'fantasy', 'feeling', 'innocence', 'purity', 'lacking', 'animated', 'films', 'other', 'studios', ""'m"", 'happy', 'can', 'finally', 'enjoy', 'retirement', ""'m"", 'sad', 'upcoming', 'Wind', 'Rises', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'film.But', 'let', 'talk', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service.Although', 'favorite', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'title', 'changes', 'depending', 'mood', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'one', 'several', 'titles', 'studio', 'would', 'rate', 'perfect', 'Kiki', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', '13-year-old', 'witch', 'who', 'leave', 'home', 'one', 'year', 'further', 'training', 'Jiji', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'black', 'cat', 'town', 'where', 'can', 'settle', 'mother', 'potions', 'Kiki', 'unsure', 'what', 'services', 'will', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'pacifier', 'young', 'mother', 'can', 'make', 'living', 'flying', 'town', 'deliver', 'other', 'items.Like', 'most', 'Ghibli', 'worlds', 'people', 'Kiki', 'new', 'town', 'are', 'kind', 'generous', 'given', 'place', 'stay', 'Osono', 'MacNeille', 'who', 'local', 'bakery', 'return', ""'ll"", 'mind', 'store', 'occasion', 'deliver', 'things', 'customers', 'locals', 'are', 'impressed', 'ability', 'fly', 'character', 'eventually', 'most', 'simply', 'good', 'person', 'everyone', 'contact', 'likes', 'her.One', 'boy', 'Tombo', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'crush', 'moment', 'tries', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'story', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Tombo', 'fascination', 'flying', 'trying', 'build', 'machine', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'eager', 'show', 'work', 'Kiki.There', 'are', 'villains', 'kind', 'story', 'contain', 'moments', 'peril', 'However', 'would', 'recommend', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'anyone', 'are', 'four', 'years', 'old', '80', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'right', 'start', 'keep', 'delighting', '103', 'minutes', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'most', 'best', 'lines', 'remarks', 'provide', 'funniest', 'moments.I', 'recently', 'loaned', 'movie', 'friend', '5-year-old', 'insisted', 'watching', 'three', 'times', 'As', 'soon', 'got', 'back', 'was', 'compelled', 'watch', 'again', 'North', 'American', 'Blu-ray', 'time', 'writing', 'can', 'import', 'Japan', 'require', 'Region', 'disc', 'also', 'available', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'including', 'UK', 'Region', 'B', 'locked', 'suspect', 'North', 'American', 'release', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'summer.I', ""'ll"", 'close', 'thanking', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'many', 'other', 'memorable', 'titles', 'been', 'involved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'animation', 'studio', 'coming', 'close', 'lofty', 'achievements.Overall', 'score', '5/5']",N/A

It's the traditional age when they leave the nest to on their own.  Except in today's age, witches wait till they are a little older.  Kiki wants to be traditional and thus, she leaves her home with her cat, Jiji. Kiki ends up in a town by the sea, and starts a delivery service.I watched this DVD in the original Japanese and read the sub-titles.  It is a cute, delightful tale, but I wouldn't call it breadth-taking. The animation of Hayao Miyazaki is superb, as usual.  This one is a little interesting because the stereotypical anime style is sub-dued and a more ""cartoony"" style is employed - maybe because the film seems to take place at an unknown city in Europe.  But what really stands out visually are the scenes of the town, both the panoramic and the close-ups of the buildings.My issue has to do with the story. I like the characters; I like the sarcastic attitude of Jiji the cat, Kiki's relationship with customer Madame, and her relationship with the owners of the bakery.  However, a big part of the story is her friendship with Tombo.  It's easy enough to understand their relationship, but I wish it was developed better - I don't know how, but it just didn't completely click with me.Given that the plot of her delivery service directly affects the story which involves Tombo - perhaps the tie-in could have been better developed. Again, I don't know how.

79588,A3AC7H2Q6DFMVK,078881107X,"Sur-reel Life, All About My Movies ""Phil X""","[8, 8]","This older film by Japanese animator Miyazaki tells the story of Kiki, a cute 14-year old girl about to begin her training in witchcraft. In Kiki's family, witching appears to be a family tradition; her mother mixes explosive potions downstairs from her room, and when the time comes to depart, even passes down her flying broomstick. Those enchanted brooms only have a limited amount of trunk space, however. Enough for a small radio and a talking black cat. As far as clothing, Kiki has to bring what fits on her back, which happens to be the standard uniform of young witches: an oversized, dark-purple dress.The night Kiki leaves, she encounters a driving rainstorm. She takes shelter in the open car of a train, which drives off while she sleeps. The next morning, she awakens to find herself in a sprawling town beside the ocean. After making sure no other witches live there (Apparently, each town/city has a maximum witch-in-training quota of one), Kiki decides to settle in the bustling port. Unfortunately, the busy pace constantly interferes with her studies. Who has time to master the intricacies of witchcraft, when living costs are so high? In exchange for a room, Kiki takes a job at a bakery (the proprietors are a kindly couple, one expecting mother and her mostly non-verbal partner). She also starts the titular business, which quickly begins to thrive, thanks to her ability to take parcels anywhere by air.Despite this rare ability, Kiki's main draw is her everyday girl appeal. She's plucky and sweet, and the way she won't hesitate to perform good deeds for strangers earns her fast friends. At the same time, I hoped no one would take advantage of her naivete. After all, this is her first visit to the big city. Luckily, in this film-as is the case for Miyazaki films I've seen so far-just about every character is good at heart. The nerdy boy who shouts excitedly at Kiki when she first touches down, rubbing her the wrong way, turns out to be nice. He makes wicked innovations to a bicycle. And the nature-loving artist who initially seems aloof becomes a valuable friend. She teaches Kiki an important lesson about how to work through stress.Even the pals of the glasses-wearing boy, Tombo, don't seem so bad in the end. When they first meet Kiki, they seem unimpressed by her plain style of dress. She's the new girl meeting the cool kids. Trust that by the end credits, however, they accept the young witch for who she is (in-line with the film's central theme: the importance of being true to oneself).Exactly how does Kiki manage to gain acceptance in the town, without having to give up those traits that make her special? Let's just say there is a plot occurrence, involving a zeppelin that breaks loose on a windy day. This particular set piece would look spectacular in a live-action movie, but it seems almost quaint in this one, where the main character spends much of her time soaring above the ground like Superman. But at this point in the film, Kiki has become increasingly distracted with her new life, and as a result, her powers have begun to fade. Will Kiki rediscover her focus, and regain use of her abilities, in time to fly to a friend's aid?It's a safe bet. After all, this is a cartoon for general audiences. And while a lot of Japanese anime is serious and disturbing on the level of a Coppola film, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" happens to be charming good fun. Hayao Miyazaki, who directed it, has made several great animation masterpieces, including ""Castle in the Sky"" (1986) and ""Princess Mononoke"" (1997). He has been called the Walt Disney of Japan, and certainly deserves comparison. His films feature fluid, detailed animation, and imaginative designs of characters and backdrops.Meanwhile, even if a talking cat like Jiji doesn't hurt Miyazaki's chances of scoring with the young children's market, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" also appeals to older audiences. Even those who might not plunk down $9.50 for Disney's ""Chicken Little"" come November. Why the wider demographic appeal? My guess would be the more sophisticated storytelling. By this, I am not referring to the quality of animation, which might have been superior at Disney (There's amazing visuals in ""The Rescuers Down Under,"" which came out roughly the same time). What I mean is, there's more substance in a film like ""Kiki..."" (And less of those annoying musical numbers, too).Sure, the main character is a witch, and her witchly powers do play a pivotal role. However, the plot of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is not some operatic rehash of good versus evil, right versus wrong, absolute power corrupting absolutely, etc. Stripped down to its bare bones, the film is really about a young person's first fateful steps into the wide world. It's about entering the world, and learning how to navigate it-not just in terms of paying rent and buying food, but the holding onto of ideals, especially those pertaining to the self, what we think we should be. All this, as a maelstrom of change occurs all around.Anyone who has ever left home for college, or moved to an unfamiliar new city, can relate to Kiki. Witchly powers aside, she lives a scenario where her struggles and responses feel like those of a real person. Which brings me to another trait I have always admired about Miyazaki: In the vast majority of his films which I have seen, his characters always have unusual depth for cartoon folk. Yes, I know those are two-dimensional drawings cavorting up there on the big screen. But as I watch them, I feel there's a backstory I can detect, something which comes across in every word or action.Perhaps the best compliment I can give the master animator is that his characters all seem to live real lives. Even in the case of a witch, it's really neither blessing nor curse to be born that way. It's just another kind of living.",5,A Most Be-Witch-ing Good Time,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,5852,"['older', 'film', 'Japanese', 'animator', 'Miyazaki', 'story', 'Kiki', 'cute', '14-year', 'old',

And the characters and the European-like location reminds me Anne of Green Days era WMT. In 1974 animation drama Heidi, the Girl In The Alps, Miyazaki contributed a lot with his scene cuts so well described that we feel as if we were watching the real ones.Such toils he experienced during WMT days were much well paid to convert fairy tale like original story to easy-to-believe daily drama. Just like say, Harry Potter series. For many Miayzaki fans who expect fast-paced drama like the others this may be a bit boring but the last dramatic sequence might quench such thirst.

First,second theme was adventure story by brave girl or boy, third is funny story by sisters, and this movie is a witch's story. I think that the main theme was written to young girl fans for the first time. First and second movie was moved men or boys by the adventure story. On those days(1988) that Kiki's delivery was released, I was 10 years old boy, fifth grade of preliminary school. I went to theater at Tokyo, Japan to watch this movie with my family. I had not so expectation to the movie because I was a boy before watching this. I wished adventure story tempted boys like Naushica or Rapyuta. But this movie was reversed my imagination on good mean. The real graphic on this movie, even if I consider with that this movie was made on 80's was marvelous. besides, that was not only just real artificial graphic, but also great painting that I could feel tender atmosphere by the movie. I could felt Hayao Miyazaki's warm making mind.As Girls or Boys get old, someday they are apart the hometown and family.That will be uneasy with excitement, and trial age, too. That is time that everybody have experience over the border of countries, on Japan,U.S.A or Russia.. This movie expressed such process that we have experience very well.Miyazaki continue to say from 80's till now"" I continue to make animation movie for children""  The mind was included into the movie well. By making movies with such stance, he give dream to children and they must feel great things from his movies, and as they get old, may get great adults. Miyazaki's mind is just for children's future.Girls that watched this movie at 1988 will be around 30 years old now. Maybe they must become wonderful ladies.

79597,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,078881107X,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 8]","One of the most incredible things about the filmography of Hayao Miyazaki happened in 1988 when they released delightful 'My Neighbor Totoro' as part of a double feature in Japan. (The other film was 'Grave of the Fireflies' and these films had to wait a while to gain deserved popularity they have now after repeated showings in theaters and re-runs on TV.)  You believe that?  double feature program of new films, one of which is Miyazaki's!One year later, in 1989, things suddenly changed when 'Kiki's Delivery Service' was released theatrically.  I clearly remember watching it the first show of the first day, which started very early in the morning, and the theater was already full-packed.  Since then, Miyazaki and his films have been Japan's household name.'Kiki's Delivery Service' which is based on a children's book by Kadono Eiko shows what a good animation film can do without violence, CGIs, or obligatory musical scenes.  It's about a girl Kiki who must leave her house flying on a broomstick in order to live alone among the strangers.  Kiki, warm-hearted, strong-willed, but still a novice witch, must learn many things in this town where she gets a job at a kind baker's -- and of course her job is delivery service of the film title.There is one hair-raising big action sequence, but the film' charms are all based on credible characters including Jiji a talking cat, Tombo (meaning dragonfly in Japanese) a boy who dreams of flying, and Ursula, an artist living in the woods.  Even minor characters are memorable not because they are eccentric but because they are realistic, like someone among your relatives or friends you no longer meet but still remember.The film is entertaining and fun for kids and adults alike, and is strongly recommended, as well as Miyazaki's 'Totoro,' another favorite of mine.[ENGLISH VERSION] English-dubbed versions of non-English films are often criticized for many reasons, but I didn't find anything wrong with this version featuring the voice of Kirsten Dunst as Kiki's.  Interestingly in Japanese original version the voice of Jiji is played by actress Sakuma Rei while in American by Phil Hartman.  The voices sound considerably different with Sakuma's high-pitched voice.  If you have a chance to see the original version, compare them.[JAPANESE VERSION] Just one trivial thing about this original version which I hope might interest you.  ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW is that in the original version, the voices of Kiki and Ursula were played by same actress Takayama Minami.

The premise sounds a little silly, but do not let it keep you from watching this great film. In this magical world, if you are a witch, at the age of 13 you must move out for a year to learn about your powers and yourself. In the beginning of this movie, Kiki is just at the spot on age and is determined to fly out to the city. Saying goodbye to her parents is not too hard and she seems very excited to begin her adventure along with her talking cat, Jiji. The city is an overwhelming and big place for a little girl like her! Eventually, she finds a job working as a delivery girl at G&uuml;tiokip&auml;nja Bakery and must fly on her broomstick to deliver presents, baked goods, etc. to others. Kiki not only learns about her powers as a witch but she learns about herself and her social surroundings. The city boy, Tombo, takes a quick liking to her and becomes one of the most likeable characters. You will have to watch for yourself to see how everything plays out for the adorable Kiki!I absolutely love the animation of Kiki's Delivery Service. It is refreshing to look at compared to today's constant 3D animation. The effort and detail in the scenery is just breathtaking. All of the characters are extremely likeable, even the talking sarcastic cat! An animated talking animal always has the potential to be annoying but this is not the case in this film. He provides good comic relief and is cute to look at. One of the other highlights of the movie is the original Japanese music. This is much more fun and less silly than the English music put in the VHS tapes before. Most importantly, it is refreshing to see an animated movie that even deal with magic not have a generic plot. This is a movie about life and growing up, not an evil villain forcing the plot to move along. Kiki proves to be a positive role model who grows as a person as the movie carries on, does save the day, makes mistakes like any human, and discovers new friendship and young love is hinted at. Her friend, Tombo, is quirky and an excellent supporting character. He is a boy looking for fun and admires Kiki almost unconditionally.I highly recommend this movie to anyone, young or old, who enjoys a good animated movie.

They evoke a sense of magic and the high level of sensitivity portrayed through the various characters make these features endearing to both children and adults, at different levels.In ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", a young girl, 13-year-old Kiki (voiced by Kirsten Dunst)  is an apprentice witch, and as part of her training, she needs to spend a year away from her family and friends in a coastal town, honing her craft and finding her `voice' as a witch. The rest of the film explores how she achieves this through various adventures and misadventures in an incredibly endearing manner. Kiki is accompanied on said adventures by Jiji, her familiar in the form of a cynical black cat (voiced by Phil Hartman). Though the subject matter deals with witchcraft, it is the theme of adolescence and coming of age that permeates the story and appeals to viewers. Kiki deals with some real conflicts in trying to come into her own and discover her inspiration, proving herself  and developing self-esteem in the process. These are universal themes that many youngsters will relate to. Both my 7-year-old and I love this charming story.
