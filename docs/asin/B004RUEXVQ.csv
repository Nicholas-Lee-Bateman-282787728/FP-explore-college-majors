I found it just browsing.  Since I myself am a Christian, I thought it sounded very interesting.  My son was recently baptized into our church, as well so  I thought this would be a good film for us to watch together (along with his friend) to escape the heat of the afternoon and then have a family discussion about it.It is spot on...and is an interesting take on how come God sometimes does what He does.  The film delves into why sometimes God allows negative things to happen to good people.  It's very thought provoking.  It was interesting how Sting's character ALMOST cracked...but I believe this is a very accurate depiction of how it would happen too.  It's also a great illustration of how Christ still loves the sinner but hates the sin and gets people back on the right track, if they have faith and just listen.This is one movie we will more than likely be watching over and over again.  It is one I will also be recommending to all my friends at church and elsewhere.

1426925,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B004RUEXVQ,David Bower,"[2, 2]","We watched this movie last night knowing almost nothing about what we were going to see. The movie is touching and powerful as it portrays Jesus in a contemporary setting making appeals to a variety of people who are all drawn together in a small roadside diner by an approaching storm. The people's individual lives and personal problems tracked many typical situations today and demonstrated the traditional objections to faith in Jesus one hears.What is of particular interest is the timing of this movie when one considers what is happening in the Middle East; visions of Jesus are causing a large number of skeptics and unbelievers to receive Jesus as their Savior for the first time. The power of the Gospel of Christ is reaching those who could not be reached any other way through visions of Jesus appearing to them in various ways. The large number of people to whom this is happening is causing a great disturbance among leaders of more traditional Eastern religions as one would expect; it is being seen as a tragedy by those leaders.The character of Jesus is tenderly played by Bruce Marchiano who deals with the typical objections one hears about accepting the gift of salvation. In the story there is a rich ex football player who owns a string of restaurants and taunts and ridicules Jesus; I was reminded of Luke 12:20, ""But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'"" There is also a young abused teenager from a dysfunctional home effectively played by Madison Gibney; a couple whose marriage is in jeopardy played by Jamie Nieto and Danah Davis and a young Christian woman on her way to marry the wrong man played by Jaci Valesquez.The movie has a feeling of urgent uncertainty about it which is actually true of life; none of us knows how much time we have left or what the future may hold for us. It is a great comfort for the believer to know that the one who loved us and gave himself for us knows all of that perfectly.This movie will appeal to all ages and should even hold the attention of the fairly young.

It is about 5 people traveling and getting stuck on a rainy road that has been shut down due to  dangerous conditions. They all go back to a diner that is supposed to be closed according to the evil looking cop, but they saw it was opened. The owner of the dinner is a man named Jesus. As the plot unfolds He convinces them that He is Jesus the son of God (and God Himself) as He knows all about their lives, (shocking them). Each person came from a very different background.  Jesus challenges them to make the necessary changes in their lives so they can follow him, and live Fulfilling their purpose here on earth, and spending eternity in Heaven.  Though he told them life would not be easy He said He will always be there for them.  Jesus answered some of the hard questions we all have in this fallen world. Bruce Marchiano is a very gifted Minister and actor. He played the part of a modern day Jesus incredibly well. This movie was a very family friendly movie, yet it was not boring or slow.

This movie is... Just.  So.  Bad.  I mean, it's trying to be serious, and it comes off looking like a sketch for Saturday Night Live.  It's laughably awful.

Sounds intriguing doesn't it?Unfortunately, this movie turns into little more than a Christian propaganda movie. Old cliches, stereotypes, cheesiness, bad acting, poor direction, and mediocre production quality. The 'reveal' that this diner owner is supposedly Jesus - for real - is made just 10min into the film and the rest is a back and forth discussion about rather simplistic moral questions. But, I know - there are some who say it deserves 5 stars if you just open your ears to hear to the message. If this movie's goal was to speak to the choir, I think it probably succeeds, which accounts for all the glowing positive reviews by Christians. However, as a former Christian, I find the delivery and substance of the message to be patronizingly ineffective.  The sledgehammer approach getting the message across will easily work on those looking for simple answers without nuance, without depth of thought, and just wanting to feel happy and clappy. No spiritual depth at all, just the old blah blah ""believe or you go to hell'. Yea, very uplifting. Very superficial. Very superstitious. Very contrived.Look, if you are into Happy Clappy Feel Good religion, watch it and enjoy. If you're looking for something that is thought provoking and perhaps entertaining, you're not likely to find it here unless you are interesting in how Happy Clappy religion is viewed by those who love it so.How I would have done it differently:Build up the mystery - give subtle hints that this guy is perhaps either a nut, a zealot, or something more...Keep people guessing - have frequent twists.Make the guy Mexican named Jesus, not some blue eyed white guy named Jesus. or better still - how about make HER a Latina named Jesua.Show that Jesua is really just an ordinary human who just happens to be a good listener and can help people see thru their own problems.

I would call ""The Encounter"" ""message driven"", becuase both characters and plot are entirely secondary to, and exist only to support, the movie's message, which could be summarized as ""Jesus offers salvation for free if you'll just accept it, and if you don't, you'll spend eternity in Hell after you die."" and ""Jesus loves you and wants what's best for you"". The plot device involved in getting this message across is that a number of people get caught in a storm and have to seek shelter in a roadside diner, run by a man namned Jesus, and he's not just any Jesus, but THE Jesus. Our travellers are an assorted group of clich&eacute;d christians, non-christians, poor and rich, from very different walks of life, and they react very differently to Jesus's claims and offers of salvation. What we get is a long discussion, taking place almost entirely in the diner, about some of the usual basic questions in Christian theology (i.e. ""Why do bad things happen?"", ""Where were you (Jesus) when I suffered during my childhood"", etc., much in the same way asThe Perfect Stranger.Except for this long discussion there's minimal plot going on, making the whole movie feel more like a 90 minute sermon than an actual movie. If you like that sort of thing and are a Christian and want to give your faith a boost, you'll probably enjoy ""The Encounter"", judging from the many 5 star reviews. If you don't fall into that catergory you're likely to be very bored by the movie and find it very tiresome, as I did. Some Christians may think this would be a good witnessing tool for trying to convert people to Christianity but I seriously doubt it.

It was very interesting and I enjoyed watching it. It had a great Christian message and it made me think about my walk with Christ.This great movie was about five people who are all driving on the same small road during a storm only to be turned away by Officer Deville because the road was flooded. They retreat a few miles to the ""Last Chance Diner"" to wait out the storm and find that the store is owned by a man named Jesus. Jesus tells each of them the story of their lives and asks them to come to him and be saved. There is an unhappy couple, a sexually abused teenager, a soft-hearted woman intent on marrying her unchristian boyfriend and a bitter rich business man who have one ""last chance"" to ""see"" or ""know"" him.This was an amazing movie and I really liked learning from it.
