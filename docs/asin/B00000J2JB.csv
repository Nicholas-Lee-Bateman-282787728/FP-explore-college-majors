If you don't like fluffy, feel good movies with happy endings, chances are you won't like this movie.But, for those of us who aren't quite so cynical, this movie is pretty good.  I don't really care for Jessica Biel's acting ability, so that's basically my only issue with it.  On the other hand, I felt Jonathan Taylor Thomas (J.T.T. as he was known as by my teenybopper sister back in his heyday) was perfect in his role.  (What ever happened to that kid?)Anyway, J.T.T. plays Jake, a college (or prep school, not sure which) student, who is trying to get home for Christmas because if he does so, he gets his dad's vintage Porsche.  Not only does Jake have the Porsche over his head, he also needs to make good with his girlfriend Ally, who after being stood up by Jake, takes up an offer of a trip back east with Jake's archenemy, Eddie.What follows is Jake's cross-country journey where he runs into one adventure after another all the while being dressed in a Santa suit.  All of which we found to be pretty entertaining!  Of course, he eventually makes it home and he fixes his relationship with Ally and all is happy by the time the closing credits role.

But when his father promises him a Porsche if he's there by Christmas Eve dinner, Jake decides to spend the holidays with them.  Only things aren't that simple.  A scheme to help some jocks cheat on a final backfires, and he finds himself in the desert in a Santa costume.  Now, he must use all his wits to get from California to New York before the deadline.I remember thinking this film would be fun when it first came out.  I was wrong then, and watching it again didn't change my mind.  The problem is with Jake.  Watching the guy lie and scheme his way across the country for an hour and a half to get a car is hard to watch.  You're supposed to be rooting for him, but he's so despicable you want him to fail.  And his supposed change of heart at the end is too little too late to redeem him.  Because of this, the funny situations along the way aren't as funny because you don't care about the character.Frankly, I find this disappointing because I do enjoy Jonathon Taylor Thomas's work.  He's a good actor, but he can't raise the level of the comedy above poor.  If you want to get into the spirit of the season, skip this and watch many of the other, better holiday themed movies available.

When some arch rivals play a prank on him, leaving him in the middle of a desert wearing a Santa Clause suit and with no money or way home, he must find his way home so he can be home in time for Christmas to be with his girlfriend (Jessica Biel) and his family. I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS is a fun, romantic comedy for the entire family. It's fun to see how Jake actually does get home. If you're a JTT fan, you must see this movie. Adam LaVorgna (who can be seen now on TV's &quot;7th Heaven&quot; with Jessica Biel, who also stars on &quot;7th Heaven&quot;), is also great in this film.

He promises Jake if he comes home, he can have the Porsche his father restored. Now he's going home! The problem is, his college rivals play a prank on him and leave him stranded in the desert with nothing and wearing a Santa costume.So to get home, he hitches a ride with a theif who almost killed him with his van while Jake was walking on the side of the road. Then he comes accross a cop who asks Jake for help in getting his wife back. Jake does it because the cop promises to give him a bus ticket home if he succeeds. It's hilarious how Jake does it. Then, while at the bus station, Jake sees on TV his girlfriend with Eddie, who stranded him in the desert. ""I'll kill him!"" So he chases down Eddie and then ends up stranded again. So he enters a Santa Claus race and the winner gets money. Of course Jake wins because he's competing against old fats guys.I'll let you see the rest. How will he find a way to get home?

So we went to  see it. From the moment it started, I knew this wasn't going to be a  Christmas classic. For one thing, it's supposed to take place in a college  somewhere in L.A. For some reason, none of the teenagers in the movie even  look like college students, they communicate with one another often using  corny phrases such as, &quot;Am I witnessing an overage of niceness  here?&quot;, and, &quot;If you try to feel me up, I am going to SLUG  you!&quot;. I don't know anyone who talks like that, and I doubt that  anyone does. There are so many things that are terribly wrong in this  movie. For one thing, the plot revolves around this guy named Jake  (Jonathon Taylor Thomas) who thinks he rules the universe. He is a snob,  and everyone knows it, even his girlfriend. But, anyways, Jake's dad calls  him up the day before Christmas and begs for him to come over for the  holidays. Jake claims that he has more important things to do. Thats pretty  low. His dad makes a pact with him. If he can make it home on Christmas  Eve, his dad will give him the Porsce. He calls it a deal, and says that he  will be there. What a nice son...NOT! The whole time I was thinking,  &quot;YOU IDIOT&quot;! I know that if my parents wanted me to visit them on  the holidays, I would drop everything I was doing, and I most definitly  would go. But, Jake has a little problem. He forgot to give these students  the answers to the school quiz that they were having. He had promised them  that he would help them cheat. He forgets. They catch him, glue a Santa hat  and beard onto his head, and throw him out into the middle of the desert.  How sweet. How jolly. Anyways, Jake goes through hell and high water to get  home, all the while learning the true meaning of Christmas! Awwww! I guess  you already know how this is going to turn out, so I'll stop there.
