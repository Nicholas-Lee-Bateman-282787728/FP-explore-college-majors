This 2 part documentary covers 4 hours of material presented in a meticulous and sincere manner.The first half of this program begins with a detailed timeline beginning in 1981 exploring the first AIDS cases diagnosed in America.  What started as a purported homosexual disease quickly became a heterosexual disease and then splintered into intravenous drug user groups and eventually ended up threatening the national blood supply system.  In this same year, a few European countries diagnosed new AIDS cases of their own and this was the early warning signs of the soon to be massive AIDS epidemic.Medical research is explored next and it spotlights not only the discovery of the HIV virus in 1983 but looks at the many difficulties experienced by scientists as they try to combat and eradicate this deadly organism.  The drug AZT, designed to assist in controlling the disease is touched on briefly but its overall impact later on was not as significant as once hoped.Social, economical, and the often turbulent political elements of the AIDS crisis are examined in-depth for the latter half of this first installment.  This was a very good idea considering all these factors have such a pivotal and influential impact on a global scale.The second part of this documentary starts with an examination of AIDS spreading throughout the African continent at an alarming rate and then looks at how AIDS cases have pervaded Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, India, and China.  The implications of this disease spreading throughout some of the world's most populous countries are scary enough in itself.A watershed event occurred many years into this epidemic and it was the medical discovery of an aggressive drug treatment used to combat AIDS, but it wasn't a cure.  Unfortunately, it came with an astronomical price tag to treat each individual patient and the dilemma this caused for underdeveloped and poor countries is discussed in this segment.Finishing off this documentary is an examination of activist's efforts, prevention programs, and sex education as these all play vital supporting roles in the continuing efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic.If I ever see another presentation on the topic of AIDS, I am going to measure it against this wonderful PBS documentary.  The scope and detail of this material is far ranging, very informative, and exceedingly well presented.  I highly recommend this program to everyone.",5,Frontline does itself proud with this definitive study on AIDS,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,2562,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'comprehensive', 'history', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'covering', 'last', '25', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', '2', 'part', 'documentary', '4', 'hours', 'material', 'presented', 'meticulous', 'sincere', 'manner.The', 'first', 'half', 'program', 'detailed', 'timeline', 'beginning', '1981', 'exploring', 'first', 'AIDS', 'cases', 'diagnosed', 'America', 'What', 'started', 'purported', 'homosexual', 'disease', 'quickly', 'became', 'heterosexual', 'disease', 'then', 'splintered', 'intravenous', 'drug', 'user', 'groups', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'threatening', 'national', 'blood', 'supply', 'system', 'same', 'year', 'few', 'European', 'countries', 'diagnosed', 'new', 'AIDS', 'cases', 'own', 'was', 'early', 'warning', 'signs', 'soon', 'be', 'massive', 'AIDS', 'epidemic.Medical', 'research', 'explored', 'next', 'not', 'only', 'discovery', 'HIV', 'virus', '1983', 'many', 'difficulties', 'experienced', 'scientists', 'try', 'combat', 'eradicate', 'deadly', 'organism', 'drug', 'AZT', 'designed', 'assist', 'controlling', 'disease', 'touched', 'briefly', 'overall', 'impact', 'later', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'significant', 'once', 'hoped.Social', 'economical', 'often', 'turbulent', 'political', 'elements', 'AIDS', 'crisis', 'are', 'examined', 'in-depth', 'latter', 'half', 'first', 'installment', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'considering', 'factors', 'have', 'pivotal', 'influential', 'impact', 'global', 'scale.The', 'second', 'part', 'documentary', 'examination', 'AIDS', 'spreading', 'African', 'continent', 'alarming', 'rate', 'then', 'how', 'AIDS', 'cases', 'have', 'pervaded', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'India', 'China', 'implications', 'disease', 'spreading', 'world', 'most', 'populous', 'countries', 'are', 'scary', 'enough', 'itself.A', 'watershed', 'event', 'occurred', 'many', 'years', 'epidemic', 'was', 'medical', 'discovery', 'aggressive', 'drug', 'treatment', 'used', 'combat', 'AIDS', 'was', ""n't"", 'cure', 'Unfortunately', 'came', 'astronomical', 'price', 'tag', 'treat', 'individual', 'patient', 'dilemma', 'caused', 'underdeveloped', 'poor', 'countries', 'discussed', 'segment.Finishing', 'off', 'documentary', 'examination', 'activist', 'efforts', 'prevention', 'programs', 'sex', 'education', 'play', 'vital', 'supporting', 'roles', 'continuing', 'efforts', 'combat', 'AIDS', 'epidemic.If', 'ever', 'see', 'presentation', 'topic', 'AIDS', 'am', 'going', 'measure', 'wonderful', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'scope', 'detail', 'material', 'far', 'ranging', 'very', 'informative', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'presented', 'highly', 'recommend', 'program', 'everyone']",Frontline: The Age of AIDS
