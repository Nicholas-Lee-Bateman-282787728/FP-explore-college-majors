1683699,A2V3M6G0BBYKF3,B00H540KMM,Bernd Kotz,"[1, 7]",The first part of the story is left outside how Onegin gets to the countryside after his uncle died. The opera begins with Larina and she is listening to her girls Olga and Tatyana. Onegin is introduced by Lenskij. Tatyana falls immediate in love with him.  He rejects her love and kills Lenskij in a duel after the party of her Saints day. Time pass and Onegin finds her well educated. The story turn inside out and Onegin is the one with strong love and passion but Tatyana rejects him as he did early on. The kiss is a little bit dramatic in the end. It is a lyrical opera and Tchaikovsky transformed the book by Pushkin very well. The opera is traditionally performed and the pictures are beautiful. I like the orchestral part very much. The actors interpreted the characters in their own way and the opera is very well played. Anna Netrebko sings the letter scene very well and the final scene is good.,3,nice but not so stunning,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,907,"['first', 'part', 'story', 'left', 'outside', 'how', 'Onegin', 'countryside', 'uncle', 'died', 'opera', 'Larina', 'listening', 'girls', 'Olga', 'Tatyana', 'Onegin', 'introduced', 'Lenskij', 'Tatyana', 'immediate', 'love', 'love', 'kills', 'Lenskij', 'duel', 'party', 'Saints', 'day', 'Time', 'pass', 'Onegin', 'well', 'educated', 'story', 'turn', 'Onegin', 'one', 'strong', 'love', 'passion', 'Tatyana', 'did', 'early', 'kiss', 'little', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'end', 'lyrical', 'opera', 'Tchaikovsky', 'transformed', 'book', 'Pushkin', 'very', 'well', 'opera', 'traditionally', 'performed', 'pictures', 'are', 'beautiful', 'orchestral', 'part', 'very', 'much', 'actors', 'interpreted', 'characters', 'own', 'way', 'opera', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Anna', 'Netrebko', 'letter', 'scene', 'very', 'well', 'final', 'scene', 'good']",Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin

Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[7, 8]","Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that having Slavic speaking artists for the major roles and minor roles as well, does make a difference in the final product of this Russian story and Russian opera. I'll not rehash the accolades, well deserved as they are, also given by most previous reviewers except to say the whole project - sets, scenery, lighting, costumes, chorus, principals and extras were all right on and first rate. The whole atmosphere was set by the first few notes in the orchestra as Valery Gergiev led with a restrained hand this delicate, magnificent Tchaikovsky score. What enfolded was a true theatrical performance, again restrained as would be a Chekov drama but as deep as life itself.Anna Netrebko looking more &#34;solid&#34; than in her &#34;Lucia&#34; and &#34;Puritani&#34; days, continues to conquer yet another opera standard as well as many specialist and lesser known roles. In all of these she does her homework and really &#34;gets into&#34; the character she is playing. For &#34;Tanya&#34; she had the great advantage of having memorized verses of the Pushkin drama as most Russian children do, as a child in school. So her superb acting was based on long familiarity with this material and it showed. She was youthful, awkward, shy and bumbling in her first encounter with Onegin and in the following letter-writing scene. Ah but the transformation to Princess Gremin was a caterpillar-to-butterfly change and the new refined lady worked it's magic on the enthralled Onegin. He is now the pleading one. She now calls the tune.Poor Lenski, played and sung superbly by Piotr Beczala was an innocent country boy who believes and accepts everything at face value. He could not believe the mock playing-up to his betrothed Olga by Onegin was all in jest. M. Beczala  played him as clueless and guileless but a beautiful person and that's the way Pushkin makes him out to be. This innocence is particularly apparent in his deservedly famous &#34;aria&#34; in which he encapsulates his view of life and the world, the happiness he has known here as a child in the Larina household and regrets his impetuousness as later does Onegin. But the duel takes place and Lenski is killed.The most telling performance of this disc is the Onegin of Mariusz Kwiecien. His face, his whole body, his every word and action speaks of disdain and boredom with this &#34;country-life&#34; world he's in now with his uncle's estate that he's inherited. His lips and eyes give credence to his dialog in the post letter-scene encounter with Tanya. (This is an advantage of seeing the opera on disc as compared to in the opera house). Yet all of this veneer is utterly destroyed upon later meeting Tanya as Tatiana, now the refined lady, Princess Gremin. He is now disheveled and his worldliness crumbled away as he now is the pleading rejected one. Superb acting!The other hero of this production is Gergiev and the Metropolitan Orchestra. They made it &#34;sing&#34; with a clear quiet voice. I've heard this opera dozens of times, often loud and slippery with pathos. No! It is fragile, delicate, clearly beautiful and introspective.And that last scene as done here is really great drama.",5,among the best opera recordings ever made,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,3204,"['Yes', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'having', 'Slavic', 'speaking', 'artists', 'major', 'roles', 'minor', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'difference', 'final', 'product', 'Russian', 'story', 'Russian', 'opera', ""'ll"", 'not', 'rehash', 'accolades', 'well', 'deserved', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'most', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'say', 'whole', 'project', 'sets', 'scenery', 'lighting', 'costumes', 'chorus', 'principals', 'extras', 'were', 'all', 'right', 'first', 'rate', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'set', 'first', 'few', 'notes', 'orchestra', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', 'led', 'restrained', 'hand', 'delicate', 'magnificent', 'Tchaikovsky', 'score', 'What', 'enfolded', 'was', 'true', 'theatrical', 'performance', 'again', 'restrained', 'would', 'be', 'Chekov', 'drama', 'as', 'deep', 'life', 'itself.Anna', 'Netrebko', 'looking', 'more', '34', 'solid', '34', '34', 'Lucia', '34', '34', 'Puritani', '34', 'days', 'conquer', 'yet', 'opera', 'standard', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'specialist', 'lesser', 'known', 'roles', 'homework', 'really', '34', '34', 'character', 'playing', '34', 'Tanya', '34', 'had', 'great', 'advantage', 'having', 'memorized', 'verses', 'Pushkin', 'drama', 'most', 'Russian', 'children', 'do', 'child', 'school', 'superb', 'acting', 'was', 'based', 'long', 'familiarity', 'material', 'showed', 'was', 'youthful', 'awkward', 'shy', 'bumbling', 'first', 'encounter', 'Onegin', 'following', 'letter-writing', 'scene', 'Ah', 'transformation', 'Princess', 'Gremin', 'was', 'caterpillar-to-butterfly', 'change', 'new', 'refined', 'lady', 'worked', 'magic', 'enthralled', 'Onegin', 'now', 'pleading', 'one', 'now', 'tune.Poor', 'Lenski', 'played', 'sung', 'superbly', 'Piotr', 'Beczala', 'was', 'innocent', 'country', 'boy', 'who', 'everything', 'face', 'value', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'mock', 'playing-up', 'betrothed', 'Olga', 'Onegin', 'was', 'jest', 'M.', 'Beczala', 'played', 'clueless', 'guileless', 'beautiful', 'person', 'way', 'Pushkin', 'out', 'be', 'innocence', 'particularly', 'apparent', 'deservedly', 'famous', '34', 'aria', '34', 'view', 'life', 'world', 'happiness', 'known', 'here', 'child', 'Larina', 'household', 'regrets', 'impetuousness', 'later', 'Onegin', 'duel', 'place', 'Lenski', 'killed.The', 'most', 'telling', 'performance', 'disc', 'Onegin', 'Mariusz', 'Kwiecien', 'face', 'whole', 'body', 'word', 'action', 'speaks', 'disdain', 'boredom', '34', 'country-life', '34', 'world', 'now', 'uncle', 'estate', 'inherited', 'lips', 'eyes', 'give', 'credence', 'dialog', 'post', 'letter-scene', 'encounter', 'Tanya', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'opera', 'disc', 'compared', 'opera', 'house', 'veneer', 'utterly', 'destroyed', 'later', 'meeting', 'Tanya', 'Tatiana', 'now', 'refined', 'lady', 'Princess', 'Gremin', 'now', 'disheveled', 'worldliness', 'crumbled', 'away', 'now', 'pleading', 'rejected', 'one', 'Superb', 'acting', 'other', 'hero', 'production', 'Gergiev', 'Metropolitan', 'Orchestra', 'made', '34', 'sing', '34', 'clear', 'quiet', 'voice', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'opera', 'times', 'often', 'loud', 'slippery', 'pathos', 'No', 'fragile', 'delicate', 'clearly', 'beautiful', 'introspective.And', 'last', 'scene', 'done', 'here', 'really', 'great', 'drama']",Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin

Each and every performer has wonderful insight into their character, and with the exception of &#34;Mama&#34; not a wobble in the bunch.  I've not been a huge Anna Netrebko fan, but I'd never seen her in opera performed in her own language.  Her Tatiana is youthful and charming as a shy teenager, and regal and womanly as the Princess Gremin.  Mariusz Kwiecien is both handsome and loathsome (as he should be) as Onegin, the manly womanizer with a wonderful opinion of himself.  Piotr Beczala is handsome, foolish and heartrending as Lenski, and if you're not in tears at the end of his aria on the field of duel you're not doing it right!  The soprano singing Olga, Tatiana's sister and Lenski's beloved, is both beautiful and on point in that role and the Met Chorus and Orchestra are top notch.  I wish someone would buy Valery Gergiev, the talented and sensitive orchestral director, a decent suit.  It looks like the same one he wore to the Olympic opening, and as if it had not been pressed since this recording.  That was my only &#34;down&#34; observation in this whole thing.

Her voice has rounded with age to produce truly breathtakingly beautiful tones. I don't think I will ever witness a better performance in my lifetime. She was absolutely stunning in her red gown in the final act.I love Triquet's aria and was disappointed by the singer's interpretation. The voice was very harsh and unpleasant.

Add to that the quality of singing, not just the principals but the secondary roles as well, absolutely superb!  We benefit much from the availability of Slavic singers.  There is a quality of inflection, tonality that you get from a Slavic voice doing Tchaikovsky that western voices just can't match - - in my humble opinion.  Did I mention that the conductor was Valery Gergiev?  I was eager to see this because the principals were Anna Netrebko, Mariusz Kwiecien, & Piotr Beczala the same principals from the MET Lucia.  Beczala is a much better actor this time around, but all are stellar.  Forgive the superlatives, but this really deserves high praise.In case your wondering, no, I don't own this disc yet. I've ordered based on having seen the telecast last night.UPDATE: Received my copy yesterday.  In process of viewing again several things stand out.  First, the stagecraft.  Interior and exterior space are combined so we see interior action with exterior action viewed through the windows in background.  Lighting enhances the effect with candles inside, sunlight streaking through translucent windows. Second, the direction.  Many bits of action between the principals add dimension to their characters, such as playful bits of horseplay on the part of Olga provoking retaliation on the part of Tatiana who would rather be left to her solitude, reverie and reading.  Third, choreography.  Bits of dance added during the chorale numbers enhance the relationships between nobles, staff, and peasants.I also found the interviews informative.  We learn that Netrebko and Kwiecien read Pushkin as children, having to memorize vast sections of verse adding to their understanding of the story.  The interview with Valery Gergiev touched on how Netrebko has matured as an artist over the past 20 years.  Something we are fortunate to witness in her recorded videos ranging from Betrothal in a Monastery, to I Puritani to the present day Onegin.I have to mention the Onegin production staring Renee Fleming and Dimitri Hvorostovsky, also from the MET.
