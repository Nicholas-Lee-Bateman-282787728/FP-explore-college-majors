The pace was good and kept me engaged in what was going to happen next. It didn't drag at all. The acting was competent. The production values fine. I liked the story, which I won't spoil, as half the fun was figuring out what was up. The blockhead military guy was a nice touch. Good comedic value there. I liked the ending, unsentimental, as I prefer my horror. I rented this at the end of the night, getting ready for bed and it was perfect for that time slot.

They each had there own reasons on why they chose to be a part of this study, however, the government is trying to create a bio weapon for the president that has at least fail twice already.

I love independent films, but I didn't become endeared to any of the characters, so I couldn't care what happened to any of them. Better camerawork and direction could have improved the experience. The actors were ok, but when so much is wrong, it no longer matters what's right. There's plenty of gore, but since I'm not into lots of that, the film fell short for me. The storyline was solid but not executed well. I wouldn't recommend it.

In her ethics class they discuss ""the greater good"" as a theme for the film. (Note: Most film class discussions relate to the theme.)

They are told they will be given an experimental anti-anxiety drug with some minor side effects.40 minutes into the film things start to happen as the military lied.The characters were decent. There was a quick and effective build-up while they sat around a table. The opening scene with a slow motion bullet and blood splatter made for a promising film that never reached its potential.
