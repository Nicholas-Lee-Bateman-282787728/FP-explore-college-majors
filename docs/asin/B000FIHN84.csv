990671,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B000FIHN84,,"[3, 3]","I knew little about ""She's the Man"" before I bought the dvd. I bought this movie because of the ads and reviews I've seen and because I happen to like Channing Tatum (who was fab in ""Step Up"") and Amanda Bynes.  I also happen to enjoy ""Twelfth Night"" and the fact that this movie 'lifts' from its story did not escape my notice. Now that I've seen it a few times I certainly would consider this a keeper. It's a movie that my whole family can enjoy.The plot has already been covered by most other reviewers. Amanda Bynes succeeds in this because of her pure comedic talents. She does well as tomboy-ish, soccer-loving, rough-around-the-edges Viola and also as the 'fake' goofy and awkward twin brother Sebastian.  Her crazy antics as a girl-pretending-to-be-a-boy are often hilarious and this movie has surprisingly good writing and engaging characters.  I especially like Tatum (very easy on the eye) as soccer star Duke Orsino, Duke's hapless best friends, Viola's frustrated socialite mother, Vinnie Jones as the scene-stealing soccer coach, and David Cross as the eccentric principal.Most people would dismiss this as a movie geared towards teenagers but, like ""Clueless"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" before it (which are also loosely based on famous classic literary works), it is actually a clever film and one that a wide range of age groups would enjoy.  It's wacky, laugh-out-loud funny and, most importantly, it's one of those films that the whole family can enjoy.",5,Loads of fun.

With the `ever so spunky' Amanda Bynes and the new age heartthrob Channing Tatum (my wife drools and begs me to do more sit-ups), `She's the Man' has enough eye-candy for both genders, not to mention humor both can enjoy and a storyline (straight from Shakespeare) that is engaging, entertaining and memorable.Viola likes to play soccer, but when her school drops the girl's soccer team she finds herself out of luck.  When her brother, Sebastian, decides to ditch school for a chance to play with his band in London, Viola decides to take his place (it's a new school, and she's his twin, so no one should notice; right?) in order to play on their soccer team and defeat her old school's boy's soccer team (who refused to let her join).  Then she falls in love with Duke, her (his) roommate.  Duke is in love with Olivia, and he asks Sebastian (Viola) to hook him up, but Olivia ends up falling for Sebastian instead.It's a mess all around, but it's a funny mess.The acting is fine for a film of this nature.  Bynes is a delightful over-actor (I've mentioned my adoration of her recently) but here she grates my nerves a tad when she's in Sebastian mode.  Her Viola is stunning, charming and endearing.  Her Sebastian is rather forced and unbelievable; but I think that's what they were going for.The rest of the cast is a bunch of hot young things that are just as serviceable as the next flock of hot young things, with no real standout aside from Channing, who is really a notch above the rest to be honest.  He's actually got some talent to back up that six-pack.  I also really liked Vinnie Jones here; as the soccer coach Dinklage.For those of you who enjoy a good teen comedy then this one is a surefire hit.  It has all the elements to make an enjoyable, if rather brainless, cinematic experience.  It's nice to turn off every once in a while, and this provides the desired escape.  If you're a fan of Bynes or any of her movies then this will not disappoint.

990685,A1WGHAW0YRSG7G,B000FIHN84,"Bookworm Extraordinaire ""Me""","[2, 2]","""She's the Man"" is a perfect weekend movie.  It's easy to understand, the actors are all pretty good-looking, and it gives some great laughs.Based loosely on Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"", this film tells the story of high-schooler Viola Hastings (Bynes), a star soccer player.  When the girls team at her school gets cut due to lack of sign-ups, she wants to try out for the boys team.  When the coach laughs in her face and tells her that girls can never beat boys, Viola impersonates her twin brother to join the team of the rival school.  Predictably, Viola finds that twisted love triangles are a lot more complicated when she's a girl pretending to be a boy.This plot is much easier to digest on screen.  As Viola, Amanda Bynes is at her comedic best!  Her facial expressions and confidence will keep you laughing throughout nearly the entire movie.Some lines are unnecessarily dramatic, however, and the actors' best efforts cannot keep these parts of the script from being corny.  At points ""She's the Man"" also requires viewers to suspend reality.  The high schools seem more like colleges (dorms, full-size stadiums) and, though they can pass as twins, Viola and Sebastian (the brother she impersonates) certainly don't look enough alike to carry off such an audacious plan.To sum things up, if you are able to forgive the corny scenes and abandon reality for 105 minutes, you will get a good laugh and some endorphins out of this film.4-stars...give it a try!",4,Easy Entertainment,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,1470,"['Man', 'perfect', 'weekend', 'movie', 'easy', 'understand', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'good-looking', 'great', 'laughs.Based', 'loosely', 'Shakespeare', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'film', 'story', 'high-schooler', 'Viola', 'Hastings', 'Bynes', 'star', 'soccer', 'player', 'When', 'girls', 'team', 'school', 'cut', 'due', 'lack', 'sign-ups', 'try', 'out', 'boys', 'team', 'When', 'coach', 'face', 'girls', 'can', 'never', 'beat', 'boys', 'Viola', 'twin', 'brother', 'join', 'team', 'rival', 'school', 'Predictably', 'Viola', 'twisted', 'love', 'triangles', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'girl', 'pretending', 'be', 'boy.This', 'plot', 'much', 'easier', 'digest', 'screen', 'Viola', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'comedic', 'best', 'facial', 'expressions', 'confidence', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'nearly', 'entire', 'movie.Some', 'lines', 'are', 'unnecessarily', 'dramatic', 'however', 'actors', 'best', 'efforts', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'parts', 'script', 'being', 'corny', 'points', 'Man', 'also', 'viewers', 'suspend', 'reality', 'high', 'schools', 'seem', 'more', 'colleges', 'dorms', 'full-size', 'stadiums', 'can', 'pass', 'twins', 'Viola', 'Sebastian', 'brother', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'enough', 'alike', 'carry', 'off', 'such', 'audacious', 'plan.To', 'sum', 'things', 'up', 'are', 'able', 'forgive', 'corny', 'scenes', 'abandon', 'reality', '105', 'minutes', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'laugh', 'endorphins', 'film.4-stars', 'give', 'try']",N/A
990686,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000FIHN84,Boss Fan,"[2, 3]","There are two minor, yet central problems with ""She's the Man.""  The most obvious is the fact that this story has been done in various ways and countless times over the years:  From the most obvious comparison ""Just One of the Guys (1985),"" to more recent junk like ""White Chicks,"" and ""The Hot Chick"" (to run down the long list of examples would take all night and this entire page).  The mistaken identity and trading places comedies are as tried and true a lazy film fallback genre as the teen slasher flick or underdog team sports movies (""She's the Man"" even throws in this clieche for good measure).  And just like ""Ten Things I hate About You,"" ""O,"" and ""She's All That"" before it, ""She's The Man"" lifts from the Bard; this time ""updating"" his ""Twelfth Night.""But the great, surprising thing about ""She's the Man"" is that it's better than most of its type, and far funnier.  Most of the credit for this must go to the surprisingly fabulous Amanda Bynes who has a real gift for comic timing, is rather fearless, and is also very cute.  Almost all by herself, she not only saves a rather mediocer movie from itself, but she elevates it and makes it something more.  But that also brings us to the second problem with this film; something I like to call the Jessica Alba/""Fantastic Four"" mistake.  When you have stars as appealing and beautiful as these, you do not cast them as the invisible woman or a guy for a majority of the film.  There is a scene about 45 minutes into this movie where Bynes has been in disguise for over a half an hour or so; she rips her wig off and it is just a seething reminder that you do not like to see her as a man.  But absence makes the heart grow fonder, so it goes without saying that every time she pulls off her stupid drag wig throughout the movie it works to the same effect.The movie is also witty and well written, at least in the early going.  It takes no major skill to write jokes about how men differ from women; but again, it is the line readings and the deadpanning from Bynes that makes all of this seem so much smarter and funnier than any of this has any right to be.  There is a silly, smartassness to the script that pops up every once in awhile (""This has been fun, but I gotta go, um, shave!""  ""What does your heart tell you?  Er, um, I mean, which one would you rather see NECKED?!""  There's a ton of them, all of them that much better due to Bynes' game delivery) and some of the supporting performances, esspecialy from David Cross as the school dean and the soccer coach, add a welsome absurdity to the script.I thought it was also winkingly funny that they cast a dead ringer for Lindsey Lohan as the ""mean girl"" in this film.  The entire scene in a pizza parlor about a half hour in to the movie warrants repeat viewing, as does a workout scene in the gym, and Bynes' eating habbits at a formal rehearsal. But the dumb romantic triangle that creeps in halfway through the story and the predictable way it all plays out almost blows a lot of the good will the writers have earned up to that point (indeed, the guys, and most everyone over 17, will be rolling their eyes though much of this).  It seems that with a little more work this could have been a much smarter and more original comedy that would actually have the chance of standing out and earning a lot of praise.  As it is it takes the easy way out, but Bynes still manages to rise above it and the film itself still manages to earn enough laughs (again, mostly thanks to Bynes) to place it ahead of its similar counterparts.Also consider that this film's key demo is likely not to care about any of the gripes I had.  I'm sure this is just what teen girls want.  As such, they could do a lot worse.""She's the Man"" is technically noting special, even though Bynes is, but I can't deny it made me laugh more than I thought it would.

She pretends to be her brother Sebastian and dresses up as him and plays on the boys soccer team. A funny romantic relationship between her and Channing Tatum's character develop and I especially liked the part where Viola tells him he is hot as a boy.The relationship between Viola and Tatum's character really start to warm as the movie progress and then later hits a wall when his character thinks she is trying to steal Olivia (played by Laura Ramsey) away from him. Things start to get really tricky here and it is just a matter of time before her act is revealed in front of a stadium of people. This is because her brother Sebastian returns from London early and plays on the Soccer team. It was funny when she flashes the whole stadium her breasts just to show that she is female and then her brother Sebastian flashes his manhood. That part really cracked me up, but fortunately no actual nudity is shown so it is only PG-13. When the romance between Olivia and Tatum's character suceed at the end it really warmed my heart. Hopefully there will be a sequel to this movie; a She's The Man 2!If you enjoy this movie then you will really like Soccer Mom played by Missi Pyle and Emily Osmont.

Amanda Bynes is a cut above all the other teen actress scoring movie role after movie role these days, especially when it comes to doing comedy. She scored HER OWN Nickelodean variety show, THE AMANDA SHOW, at the ripe old age of 13.She's a natural. Uninhibited. Loose. Funny. The 4 years she spent on her skit show have paid off. She's a joy to watch. Her facial reactions and her goofiness are engaging. Then you throw in the fact that she, for the majority of the movie, is playing a young girl named Viola who is pretending to be her twin brother Sebastian so she can play soccer on a men's team because her girls team got cut, and you have the makings of a good film.Yet, there's something more going on in SHE'S THE MAN. There were numerous times in the movie that I caught myself busting out laughing... and not always at Amanda. The writer's of the film did a good job of engaging the audience and not letting them go.There are rich characters throughout. Channing Tatum plays Duke, a soccer stud and Viola/Sebastian's roommate, who is a complete basketcase when he gets around Olivia, played by a very attractive Laura Ramsey, who is infatuated with Sebastian/Viola, who is falling for Duke and trying to fight off Sebastian's real girlfriend, who keeps trying to find out why he or Viola broke up with her.It's a movie that never rests and is always moving and twisting and becoming more and more entertwined. All the while, being very very funny.The only thing I had a problem with was from time to time, some pretty film reality things happened... in other words... yeah right occurences. Not to mention, some pretty unbelievable soccer occurences. I guess anytime a movie tries to do a sporting event, it very rarely looks believable, and this is no exception. Although, the writers had the GREAT common sense to throw in some solid comic moments that make you forget you're watching some pretty unrealistic stuff and even though you are, you're still smiling.I mean, come on... you can't beat the line, ""Is it just me, or is there more nudity in this soccer game than most?""",4,She's  a HOOT,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,2153,"['was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'SHE', 'MAN', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'cut', 'other', 'teen', 'actress', 'scoring', 'movie', 'role', 'movie', 'role', 'days', 'especially', 'when', 'doing', 'comedy', 'scored', 'HER', 'OWN', 'Nickelodean', 'variety', 'show', 'AMANDA', 'SHOW', 'ripe', 'old', 'age', '13.She', 'natural', 'Uninhibited', 'Loose', 'Funny', '4', 'years', 'spent', 'skit', 'show', 'have', 'paid', 'off', 'joy', 'watch', 'facial', 'reactions', 'goofiness', 'are', 'engaging', 'Then', 'throw', 'fact', 'majority', 'movie', 'playing', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Viola', 'who', 'pretending', 'be', 'twin', 'brother', 'Sebastian', 'can', 'play', 'soccer', 'men', 'team', 'girls', 'team', 'got', 'cut', 'have', 'makings', 'good', 'film.Yet', 'something', 'more', 'going', 'SHE', 'THE', 'MAN', 'were', 'numerous', 'times', 'movie', 'caught', 'busting', 'out', 'laughing', 'not', 'always', 'Amanda', 'writer', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'engaging', 'audience', 'not', 'letting', 'are', 'rich', 'characters', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'plays', 'Duke', 'soccer', 'stud', 'Viola/Sebastian', 'roommate', 'who', 'complete', 'basketcase', 'when', 'around', 'Olivia', 'played', 'very', 'attractive', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'infatuated', 'Sebastian/Viola', 'who', 'falling', 'Duke', 'trying', 'fight', 'off', 'Sebastian', 'real', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Viola', 'broke', 'up', 'her.It', 'movie', 'never', 'always', 'moving', 'twisting', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'entertwined', 'while', 'being', 'very', 'very', 'funny.The', 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'time', 'time', 'pretty', 'film', 'reality', 'things', 'happened', 'other', 'words', 'yeah', 'right', 'occurences', 'Not', 'mention', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'soccer', 'occurences', 'guess', 'anytime', 'movie', 'do', 'sporting', 'event', 'very', 'rarely', 'believable', 'exception', 'writers', 'had', 'GREAT', 'common', 'sense', 'throw', 'solid', 'comic', 'moments', 'make', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'stuff', 'even', 'are', ""'re"", 'still', 'smiling.I', 'mean', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'line', 'just', 'there', 'more', 'nudity', 'soccer', 'game', 'most']",N/A

I'm a fan of Amanda Bynes despite the fact that she's a chronic over actor, and here she is likable despite that flaw (she's not so bad when playing Viola, but when imitating her brother Sebastian she can be borderline annoying).The story revolves around Viola (Bynes) who is obsessed with playing women's soccer.  When the girl's soccer team is cut from her school and the boys team refuses to allow the girls to join Viola decides to try another route.  With her twin brother Sebastian (Kirk) ditching his first few weeks at his new school, Illyria, for an opportunity to play with his band in London, Viola disguises herself as her brother in order to get on the boys soccer team and win the match against her old school, Cornwall, proving that girls can play as well as boys.  What she never counted on was falling in love with her roommate Duke (Channing Tatum) who is in love with Olivia (Laura Ramsey).  When Duke asks Sebastian to hook him up with Olivia neither of them expected Olivia to fall for Sebastian.Truly enjoyable and full of laughs, `She's the Man' is a worthwhile watch through and will provide the viewer with enough eye candy and enough likeability to make it memorable.

Secondly, this is not Brazil soccer, the entire school doesnt show up for a soccer game and act like it is the freaking Super Bowl. Most importantly there is no way that the people of the school wouldnt have been able to tell the difference in Viola & her brother Sebastian. Now I do relize that those things are hard to aviod in this specific screenplay as well as the all around film but personally they bugged me AND the other people that I watched it with ...I cant give the film to hard of a time though, it was funny, entertaining. With all of the story changes and social drama surrounding the film, you have a hard time not being glued to Television.After reading some of the reveiws from other people I have found that alot of reveiwers found the acting to be poor, I personally did not think that the acting was much of an issue.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 2]","When the girls' soccer team at her high school is cut due to a lack of participation, Viola Hastings decides to take advantage of her twin brother's impromptu trip to London and join the soccer team at his new school.  To complete her transformation, she wears a short wig, binds her breasts, and practices talking and actling like a guy.  What she doesn't expect is how difficult it will be to be a first-string player at her new school, or that she might fall for her brother's roommate, Duke Orsino.In case you didn't know, this movie is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.  What you also might not know is that this movie borrows heavily from the 80's flick Just One of The Guys.  In fact, the first thirty minutes of the movie is basically Just One of The Guys with soccer instead of journalism.  I'm all for remakes and creative reinvention, but I also think the makers of this film need to give credit where credit is due.  While the love story is the same pattern as Twelfth Night and the characters have the same names, for all intents and purposes it's basically just a JOTG remake.Other than that blatant omission, I liked this movie well enough.  Channing Tatum is my new teen crush and since he spent more than half the movie with his shirt off, that was good enough for me.  If you like JOTG or if you like this movie, I'd say you'd probably like the other as well.  If you haven't seen either, it's just another teen movie.

990732,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FIHN84,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","When it comes to thinking outside of the box on the plays of William Shakespeare, I am inclined to point back to 1936 when the Federal Theater Projects assigned Orson Welles to direct a project in Harlem.  Welles mounted a production of ""Macbeth"" set in Haiti at the court of King Henri Christophe that was wildly successful.  After World War II on the other side of the world Akira Kurosawa did his own versions of ""Macbeth"" and ""King Lear,"" as ""Throne of Blood"" and ""Ran"" respectively.  Then we come to a pivotal moment in the history of Shakespeare when the musical ""West Side Story,"" written by Arthur Laurents (book), Leonard Bernstein (music), and Stephen Sondheim (lyrics), which took ""The Tragedy of Romeo & Juliet"" and turned the family strife between the Montaques and the Capulets into a turf ware on the lower east side of New York City between the Jets and the Sharks.  True, ""Kiss Me Katetook ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and made it part of a musical in a musical, but ""West Side Story"" was important because it was the movie that said Shakespeare is for kids.That is why in recent years we have seen both Shakespearean tragedies like ""Othello"" and comedies such as ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" set in the world of teenage angst in the films ""O)"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You.""  In addition to both of those films having Julia Stiles as the female lead, they were both relatively serious films, at least in terms of pretending they took place in the realm world.  But ""She's the Man"" is a version of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" that is totally willing to play up the comedy, going more for slapstick (although the catfight in the ladies room between the three principle young women in the cast is rather violent slapstick).  So this really gets beyond the tongue in cheek stage.If you know ""Twelfth Night"" then you will be able to figure this one out.  If not, the film's tagline explains it all: ""Duke (Channing Tatum) wants Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian (James Kirk) who is really Viola (Amanda Bynes) whose brother is dating Monique (Alex Breckenridge) so she hates Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who's with Duke (Channing Tatum) to make Sebastian (James Kirk) jealous who is really Viola (Amanda Bynes) who's crushing on Duke (Channing Tatum) who thinks she's a guy...""  So basically it is a love story complicated by mistaken identity, which for most of the film involves three people being four until the fourth shows up and helps everything work out.  The screenplay by Ewan Leslie, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kristen Smith is able to streamline things a bit by having Viola pretend to be her brother Sebastian, instead of pretending to be a boy named Cesario (which is now the name of a pizza joint), so that when Sebastian shows up people think he is Sebastian, which he is, only not the Sebastian they know that is really Viola, and not Cesario, whom he is not.The other key change is that Shakespeare did not write about football (what we Yanks call soccer), which is what Viola plays.  But Cornwall High cuts its girls soccer team and she is not allowed to try out for the boys team, she decides the only thing to do is to take advantage of her brother's quick trip to London to play music to go to his school, Illyria, and make their boys soccer team so when they play Cornwall, she can beat them and show them (which, in more than one way, she does).  This is a world where the adults stay mostly out of the way, and I was going to say that with Viola and Sebastian's mom (Julie Hagerty) and Principal Gold (David Cross) that this was sort of like the Charlie Brown world where the grownups just make noise, except Vinnie Jones shows up to play Coach Dinklage, and I dare any of you to tell him what he says is meaningless.This is a fun movie.  Bynes is not trying too hard, which is what is just what is needed for the role at the center of ""She's the Man.""  If she tried any less, then it would just be total silliness from start to finish.  But if she tried any harder then we would have to deal with the obvious fact that she does not look like a boy and that her Sebastian is a lot shorter than the real Sebastian.  On stage when you see ""Twelfth Night"" performed this is always the case, but we go along with that, so certainly a movie that is based on it deserves the same consideration.  Fortunately Bynes is still associated much more with Nickelodeon than the tabloids so her aura of innocence and inherent likeability allow us to enjoy the nonsense and just go ahead for the ride.  It will be some time before we get around to the likes of ""Titus Andronicus"" set in a high school, but you know the day is coming, so lighthearted fare such as """"She's the Man"" is a fun movie to watch in the meantime.",4,"""Twelfth Night"" set in a high school, but with more nudity in the soccer game than usual",1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,4739,"['When', 'thinking', 'box', 'plays', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'am', 'inclined', 'point', 'back', '1936', 'when', 'Federal', 'Theater', 'Projects', 'assigned', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'direct', 'project', 'Harlem', 'Welles', 'mounted', 'production', 'Macbeth', 'set', 'Haiti', 'court', 'King', 'Henri', 'Christophe', 'was', 'wildly', 'successful', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'other', 'side', 'world', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'did', 'own', 'versions', 'Macbeth', 'King', 'Lear', 'Throne', 'Blood', 'Ran', 'respectively', 'Then', 'come', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'history', 'Shakespeare', 'when', 'musical', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'written', 'Arthur', 'Laurents', 'book', 'Leonard', 'Bernstein', 'music', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'lyrics', 'took', 'Tragedy', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'turned', 'family', 'strife', 'Montaques', 'Capulets', 'turf', 'ware', 'lower', 'east', 'side', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Jets', 'Sharks', 'True', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Katetook', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'made', 'part', 'musical', 'musical', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'was', 'important', 'was', 'movie', 'said', 'Shakespeare', 'kids.That', 'why', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedies', 'Othello', 'comedies', 'such', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'set', 'world', 'teenage', 'angst', 'films', 'O', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'addition', 'films', 'having', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'female', 'lead', 'were', 'relatively', 'serious', 'films', 'least', 'terms', 'pretending', 'took', 'place', 'realm', 'world', 'Man', 'version', 'Shakespeare', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'totally', 'willing', 'play', 'up', 'comedy', 'going', 'more', 'slapstick', 'catfight', 'ladies', 'room', 'three', 'principle', 'young', 'women', 'cast', 'rather', 'violent', 'slapstick', 'really', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'stage.If', 'know', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'one', 'out', 'not', 'film', 'tagline', 'Duke', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Olivia', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'Sebastian', 'James', 'Kirk', 'who', 'really', 'Viola', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'brother', 'dating', 'Monique', 'Alex', 'Breckenridge', 'Olivia', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'Duke', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'make', 'Sebastian', 'James', 'Kirk', 'jealous', 'who', 'really', 'Viola', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'who', 'crushing', 'Duke', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'who', 'guy', 'basically', 'love', 'story', 'complicated', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'most', 'film', 'three', 'people', 'being', 'four', 'fourth', 'up', 'helps', 'everything', 'work', 'out', 'screenplay', 'Ewan', 'Leslie', 'Karen', 'McCullah', 'Lutz', 'Kristen', 'Smith', 'able', 'streamline', 'things', 'bit', 'having', 'Viola', 'pretend', 'be', 'brother', 'Sebastian', 'instead', 'pretending', 'be', 'boy', 'named', 'Cesario', 'now', 'name', 'pizza', 'joint', 'so', 'when', 'Sebastian', 'up', 'people', 'think', 'Sebastian', 'only', 'not', 'Sebastian', 'know', 'really', 'Viola', 'not', 'Cesario', 'whom', 'not.The', 'other', 'key', 'change', 'Shakespeare', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'football', 'what', 'Yanks', 'call', 'soccer', 'what', 'Viola', 'Cornwall', 'High', 'girls', 'soccer', 'team', 'not', 'allowed', 'try', 'out', 'boys', 'team', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'take', 'advantage', 'brother', 'quick', 'trip', 'London', 'play', 'music', 'go', 'school', 'Illyria', 'make', 'boys', 'soccer', 'team', 'so', 'when', 'play', 'Cornwall', 'can', 'beat', 'show', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'world', 'where', 'adults', 'stay', 'mostly', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'Viola', 'Sebastian', 'mom', 'Julie', 'Hagerty', 'Principal', 'Gold', 'David', 'Cross', 'was', 'sort', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'world', 'where', 'grownups', 'just', 'make', 'noise', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'up', 'play', 'Coach', 'Dinklage', 'dare', 'tell', 'what', 'meaningless.This', 'fun', 'movie', 'Bynes', 'not', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'what', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'role', 'center', 'Man', 'tried', 'less', 'then', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'total', 'silliness', 'start', 'finish', 'tried', 'harder', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'deal', 'obvious', 'fact', 'not', 'look', 'boy', 'Sebastian', 'lot', 'shorter', 'real', 'Sebastian', 'stage', 'when', 'see', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'performed', 'always', 'case', 'go', 'along', 'so', 'certainly', 'movie', 'based', 'same', 'consideration', 'Fortunately', 'Bynes', 'still', 'associated', 'much', 'more', 'Nickelodeon', 'tabloids', 'aura', 'innocence', 'inherent', 'likeability', 'allow', 'enjoy', 'nonsense', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'ride', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'get', 'around', 'likes', 'Titus', 'Andronicus', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'know', 'day', 'coming', 'so', 'lighthearted', 'fare', 'such', 'Man', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'meantime']",N/A

990740,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000FIHN84,Mark,"[5, 9]","First came ""10 Things I Hate About You"", a contemptable and miserable teen modernization of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" and now director Andy Fickman brings us ""She's the Man"" yet another teen-targeted modernization, this time of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night, or What You Will"".  Like ""10 Things"", ""She's the Man"" is loosely based on the Shakespeare play, but absolutely does not offer a replacement for the Shakespeare text.  My theory is that filmmakers have the public pretense of getting high-school-age kids to be more, shall we say, involved with Shakespeare, only to make a tragedy (or perhaps travesty) out of brilliant Shakespeare comedies.  Amanda Bynes, popularized by her Nickelodeon show and her previous roles in ""Big Fat Liar"" and the tween ""What a Girl Wants"", plays Viola, a young girl forced to impersonate her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) after he conveniently jets off to England for two weeks (whereas, in the play, Viola believes her brother to be dead, and her name becomes Cesario).  Whilst impersonating her brother, Viola must make everyone at the Illyria Prep. school (no doubt inspired by the setting of ""Twelfth Night"") believe she is Sebastian.  Is this possible?  Absolutely not.  Would she pass for a boy?  Doubt it.  The film seems to stick to the basic plot line of ""Twelfth Night"" and Viola/Sebastian finds herself crushing on Duke (no doubt inspired by Duke Orsino in the play), played by a miscast Channing Tatum.  While I'm on the subject, I must reiterate a fact that I discovered while reading Roger Ebert's review (and an overgenerous review at that) of this film.  Channing Tatum, in real life, is 26 years old.  I half expected the filmmakers to be ex-90210 casting directors.  Is it really that much of a necessity to cast a 26-year-old to play a high school student?  I won't let you think about that too long before telling you that it isn't necessary.  It usually helps even more to cast a good actor for this film, as well as other films, and Tatum is not (see the dopey ""Step Up"").  Viola finds herself in a bind, wanting Duke, but, alas, she must go on impersonating her brother.  Duke finds himself after the moody Olivia (much different from the Shakespeare), played by Laura Ramsey, who in turn, finds herself after Viola, who she thinks is Sebastian.  Hilarity (or something posing as hilarity) ensues in a final scene, semi-close to the final act in ""Twelfth Night"" and then I realized that I had wasted my time.  This film does not serve as a parallel to Shakespeare, and absolutely does not work in any of the ways the play does.  There are brilliant characters in the Shakespeare who are dulled down in this version, probably to keep up with the PG-13 rating, like Sir Andrew, Sir Toby, Maria, and the ever-entertaining Feste.  If you are looking for a better version of ""Twelfth Night"" on film, check out Trevor Nunn's 1996 film of the same name, starring Helena Bonham Carter, Ben Kingsley (as Feste), Imelda Staunton, and the hilarious Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio.",2,A shout against teen modernization,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3044,"['First', 'came', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'contemptable', 'miserable', 'teen', 'modernization', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'now', 'director', 'Andy', 'Fickman', 'Man', 'yet', 'teen-targeted', 'modernization', 'time', 'Shakespeare', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'What', 'Will', '10', 'Things', 'Man', 'loosely', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'absolutely', 'not', 'offer', 'replacement', 'Shakespeare', 'text', 'theory', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'public', 'pretense', 'getting', 'high-school-age', 'kids', 'be', 'more', 'shall', 'say', 'involved', 'Shakespeare', 'only', 'make', 'tragedy', 'perhaps', 'travesty', 'brilliant', 'Shakespeare', 'comedies', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'popularized', 'Nickelodeon', 'show', 'previous', 'roles', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Liar', 'tween', 'What', 'Girl', 'Wants', 'Viola', 'young', 'girl', 'forced', 'impersonate', 'twin', 'brother', 'Sebastian', 'James', 'Kirk', 'conveniently', 'England', 'two', 'weeks', 'whereas', 'play', 'Viola', 'brother', 'be', 'dead', 'name', 'Cesario', 'Whilst', 'impersonating', 'brother', 'Viola', 'must', 'make', 'everyone', 'Illyria', 'Prep', 'school', 'doubt', 'inspired', 'setting', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'believe', 'Sebastian', 'possible', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'Would', 'pass', 'boy', 'Doubt', 'film', 'stick', 'basic', 'plot', 'line', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'Viola/Sebastian', 'crushing', 'Duke', 'doubt', 'inspired', 'Duke', 'Orsino', 'play', 'played', 'miscast', 'Channing', 'Tatum', ""'m"", 'subject', 'must', 'reiterate', 'fact', 'discovered', 'reading', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'overgenerous', 'review', 'film', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'real', 'life', '26', 'years', 'old', 'half', 'expected', 'filmmakers', 'be', 'ex-90210', 'casting', 'directors', 'really', 'much', 'necessity', 'cast', '26-year-old', 'play', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'think', 'too', 'long', 'telling', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'usually', 'even', 'more', 'cast', 'good', 'actor', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'Tatum', 'not', 'see', 'dopey', 'Step', 'Up', 'Viola', 'bind', 'wanting', 'Duke', 'alas', 'must', 'go', 'impersonating', 'brother', 'Duke', 'moody', 'Olivia', 'much', 'different', 'Shakespeare', 'played', 'Laura', 'Ramsey', 'who', 'turn', 'Viola', 'who', 'Sebastian', 'Hilarity', 'something', 'posing', 'hilarity', 'final', 'scene', 'semi-close', 'final', 'act', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'then', 'realized', 'had', 'wasted', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'serve', 'parallel', 'Shakespeare', 'absolutely', 'not', 'work', 'ways', 'play', 'are', 'brilliant', 'characters', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'are', 'dulled', 'down', 'version', 'probably', 'keep', 'up', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Sir', 'Andrew', 'Sir', 'Toby', 'Maria', 'ever-entertaining', 'Feste', 'are', 'looking', 'better', 'version', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'Trevor', 'Nunn', '1996', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Feste', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'hilarious', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Malvolio']",N/A

Eventually, she finds herself disguised as her brother Sebastian (James N. Kirk), and attending Illyria Prep school. When Viola is assigned a shared dorm room with campus cool guy Duke (Channing Tatum), her fa&#65533;ade slowly begins to crumple as she begins harboring a deep-rooted crush on her unsuspecting new roommate. The situation begins to take a turn for the worse, however, when Duke reveals his affection towards campus knockout Olivia (Laura Ransey), who in turn seems increasingly drawn towards the sensitive impostor known as Sebastian. The problem is, the real Sebastian has decided to cut his London trip short, and upon arriving on campus two days earlier than expected, Viola's elaborately execute ruse hits an unexpected hitch that sends the entire situation spiraling into chaos.Amongst the hype of Lindsay Lohan and Hillary Duff, there's another young actress ready to break out big time: Amanda Bynes. Fresh from doing sketch shows like ""All That"", Bynes has appeared in comedies like ""Big Fat Liar"" and, in her first leading role, ""What A Girl Wants"". Sadly, critics haven't been too appeased, despite her charms and decent comic timing. Enter ""She's The Man"", based on William Shakespeare's play ""Twelvth Night"".Directed by Andy Fickman (""Reefer Madness: The Musical""), ""She's The Man"" kicks off as a growing-up party for Amanda Bynes, where we get to see her in a bikini top and jeans. And, honestly, she looks really good. However, Fickman kind of gets lost in teen movie clich&#65533;s 101. While it's cool to hear Bynes say ""bi-atch"" and ""you suck"", it's the world she's populated in: a geeky villain (played by James Snyder), a typically sexy love interest, and a soundtrack comprised of punk rock and girly pop. Plus, it doesn't go above and beyond gender-bending clich&#65533;s. There is comic potential here, but with an overdose of subplots, and the PG-13 rating, it fails.But, as I already stated, at least Bynes is reliable to turn in a good performance. Despite the fact that she is not capable of being bought as a boy (maybe she should've watched ""Transamerica""), at least she can mug her way and deliver some funny lines to stay above Fickman's lame direction.There are a couple mixed bag performances. Julia Hagerty reprises her role from ""Just Friends"" as an over-the-top mother, Channing Tatum is surprisingly funny even for a love interest of a girl, and David Cross is sadly underused and wasted.Much like with Amy Smart, Bynes is a surprisingly talented - and underrated - comic actress (and it doesn't hurt that she did sketch comedy at a young age) whose talents deserve to be in a larger-scaled project. And she looks really good at 19 going on 20. ""She's the Man"" is not a bad piece of work, but one wonders if they hired a better director who can avoid teen movie clich&#65533;s and make something like ""Mean Girls"".

She doesn't look the part, doesn't sound the part and has absolutely no clue how to act as a boy. It was painful and no where close to convincing. I don't know what the filmmakers were hoping to achieve; perhaps to show how stupid teenage guys can be and how ridiculous their behavior is. I'm not sure. However, none of this comes across because Bynes can't pull off being a guy. The film does have its share of moments. But overall, I'd skip this one if you can.",2,Mildly Amusing,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1233,"['Viola', 'Bynes', 'really', 'upset', 'when', 'girls', 'soccer', 'team', 'high', 'school', 'cut', 'boys', 'team', 'not', 'want', 'girls', 'girls', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'boys', 'so', 'Viola', 'impersonate', 'brother', 'Sebastian', 'Kirk', 'who', 'playing', 'hookie', 'London', 'trying', 'become', 'musician', 'also', 'starting', 'new', 'boarding', 'school', 'where', 'one', 'Sebastian', 'Viola', 'can', 'play', 'soccer', 'try', 'get', 'revenge', 'own', 'school', 'team.The', 'problem', 'when', 'Viola', 'love', 'roommate', 'Tatum', 'course', 'interested', 'Olivia', 'Ramsey', 'Olivia', 'got', 'eye', 'Viola', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'complicated', 'Viola', 'brother', 'were', 'come', 'home', 'early', 'film', 'tries', 'portray', 'Amanda', 'Bynes', 'teenage', 'boy', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', ""n't"", 'sound', 'part', 'absolutely', 'clue', 'how', 'act', 'boy', 'was', 'painful', 'where', 'close', 'convincing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'hoping', 'achieve', 'perhaps', 'show', 'how', 'stupid', 'teenage', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'behavior', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'However', 'none', 'Bynes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'being', 'guy', 'film', 'have', 'share', 'moments', 'overall', ""'d"", 'skip', 'one', 'can']",N/A

After ""Boys Don't Cry,"" I needed reassurance.I was impressed with Amanda Bynes' ability to play a boy. My favorite line was ""Which one would you rather see naked?""""She's The Man"" reminded me of a Lindsay Lohan movie, but it was a lot better. The soccer reminded me a lot of ""Bend It Like Beckham"" but a little less complicated and without the English accents.""She's The Man"" follows the Hollywood teen movie formula, but it has enough originality to keep you interested, and the last 30 minutes don't get all melancholy.By the way, the song toward the end in the ""cheese"" scene is ""Hold You In My Arms"" by Ray LaMontagne.
