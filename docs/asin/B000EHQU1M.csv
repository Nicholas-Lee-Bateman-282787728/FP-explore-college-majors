The movie is a little strange and the strained relationship with his daughter at first a little disconcerting.  But the story is so intriguingly quirky that all else is forgiven.

972982,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000EHQU1M,maskirovka,"[5, 5]","I saw ""Gideon's Daughter"" largely because Emily Blunt (who I --along with probably 10-20 percent of my fellow men-- am smitten by) is in the film.  And I'm glad I did because it's a good and affecting story.  But while the film is called ""Gideon's Daughter,"" the movie isn't so much about Blunt's character Natasha.  Rather it's about Gideon (Bill Nighy) and Stella (played very well by Miranda Richardson).  Gideon, an uber-public relations wonk, a man who seemingly has it all, is slowly dying inside over fears that he has permanently lost Natasha's love.  Stella is a working class divorcee whose marriage fell apart after the tragic death of her son in a traffic accident.  The two come into each other's orbit and fall in love while Gideon tries desperately to reach out to his daughter.I only have three criticisms of this film.  One is that it did not give Emily Blunt very much to do.  In most of her scenes she comes across as cold and aloof when she talks with her dad (which is appropriate but I think she could have been given more to work with).  She only really comes alive near the end of the movie.  Second, I didn't really like the narration of the movie.  Combined with the score, it almost came across as though the film makers felt ""Gideon's Daughter"" needed to be depicted as something profound and almost mythological.  Finally, while I felt Blunt did well in the limited role she had, she was not really plausible as a 17 or 18 year old (she was either 21 or 22) when the film was made, and it was a stretch to see her as the equivalent of a high school senior or college freshman (just a minor point but I think casting an actual teenager would have made more sense).What's interesting to me is that this is not the only time where Nighy and Blunt have worked together.  She and he starred in the 2010 black comedy ""Wild Target"" in which she played a confidence woman and he an assassin and they were a couple instead of father and daughter (and despite the age gap, I thought they pulled it off).  What is truly impressive about both actors is that both of them appear totally different and one would have to be looking to see they are the same people, which is testimony to their skill.Wild Target",4,"A Good Story, Mostly Down to Nighy and Richardson",1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,2224,"['saw', 'Gideon', 'Daughter', 'largely', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'who', 'probably', '10-20', 'percent', 'fellow', 'men', 'am', 'smitten', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'good', 'affecting', 'story', 'film', 'called', 'Gideon', 'Daughter', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'Blunt', 'character', 'Natasha', 'Gideon', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Stella', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Gideon', 'uber-public', 'relations', 'wonk', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'slowly', 'dying', 'inside', 'fears', 'permanently', 'lost', 'Natasha', 'love', 'Stella', 'working', 'class', 'divorcee', 'marriage', 'fell', 'apart', 'tragic', 'death', 'son', 'traffic', 'accident', 'two', 'come', 'other', 'orbit', 'fall', 'love', 'Gideon', 'desperately', 'reach', 'out', 'daughter.I', 'only', 'have', 'three', 'criticisms', 'film', 'One', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'Emily', 'Blunt', 'very', 'much', 'do', 'most', 'scenes', 'cold', 'aloof', 'when', 'dad', 'appropriate', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'work', 'only', 'really', 'alive', 'end', 'movie', 'Second', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'narration', 'movie', 'Combined', 'score', 'almost', 'came', 'film', 'makers', 'felt', 'Gideon', 'Daughter', 'needed', 'be', 'depicted', 'something', 'profound', 'almost', 'mythological', 'Finally', 'felt', 'Blunt', 'did', 'well', 'limited', 'role', 'had', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'plausible', '17', '18', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'either', '21', '22', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'stretch', 'see', 'equivalent', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'college', 'freshman', 'just', 'minor', 'point', 'think', 'casting', 'actual', 'teenager', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', '.What', 'interesting', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'where', 'Nighy', 'Blunt', 'have', 'worked', 'together', 'starred', '2010', 'black', 'comedy', 'Wild', 'Target', 'played', 'confidence', 'woman', 'assassin', 'were', 'couple', 'instead', 'father', 'daughter', 'age', 'gap', 'thought', 'pulled', 'off', 'What', 'truly', 'impressive', 'actors', 'appear', 'totally', 'different', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'looking', 'see', 'are', 'same', 'people', 'testimony', 'skill.Wild', 'Target']",Gideon's Daughter

972984,A2FV4Y4I7BBL6I,B000EHQU1M,R. Crane,"[24, 24]","""Gideon's Daughter"" is a film written and directed by the brilliant Stephen Poliakoff.  Poliakoff's movies focus on a slice of life at a particular moment in history; he tries to capture what is then happening in England and how it might affect the future.  The second disk in this set explores his philosophy in depth and how it impacts his films.In this movie, Poliakoff captures the emptiness of celebrity culture, particularly at the time of Princess Diana's death, when it had reached unheard of heights. Bill Nighy, one of England's best actors, portrays a PR guru who is at the pinnacle of his career, and whose ""guidance"" just everyone wants.  Ironically, Nighy's character is divorced from all those around him, grieving over the broken relationship with his hostile daughter.  He is also immersed in a new relationship with Miranda Richardson.  His unresponsiveness is interpreted by different people to meet their own expectations, so the farther he drifts from PR, the more they clamor for his help.This is an outstanding film, beautifully acted, superbly written that is totally absorbing.
