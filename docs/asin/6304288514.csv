You can let go and stop imagining an unreal comic  universe and pick up this movie and watch a great adaptation with more  substance than 99% of any issue ever made. Banner(David, Bruce, whatever!)  is beautifully played by the late Bill Bixby in what many consider his  finest work.There is no need to go into the story because most know it.

412976,A3MQVJ1JNGHDSP,6304288514,"Henry  Cooper ""&#34;Still One Me&#34;""","[0, 0]","I actually loved the show and the TV pilot that once aired on CBS and soon got back to TV like on SCI-FI when I 1st catch the premiere of the back-to-back episodes. Yep this is not something to disappoint, it's a great movie that shows a real side of Bruce Banner (whom Stan Lee, the founder of Marvel Comics) changed to David 'cuz Bruce was too homosexual. Reason why they did that 'cuz of the reason of the name. So they add it along the TV series from '78 until it's demise in 1982. So sad Bill Bixby is not here. He was a good actor and definitely my all-time favorite stars. He's such a good man and I miss him deerly. Wish if he would've stay long. But long period short, it started off when David Banner begin losing his wife from an automobile accident, soon transformed into a doctor along with his associtate Dr. Elaina Marks (played my Susan Sullivan), begin testing people 'bout their health and what they feel about stress, then started doing a lil experiement of gamma reactions probably known as gamma rays which I'll say, and once he leaves the office, he soons gets into his car and when he's get mad, he transformed into the 7-foot green tall man known as the Hulk (played by Lou Ferrigno). And before the concl. he comes back until Jack McGee (played by Jack Colvin) wanted him 4 murder. Y'know David Banner would be real serious here about what he's doing. To me he could be a Dr. Jekyll while the Hulk could be a Mr. Hyde. Similar to the book I read from Robert Louis Stevenson. This movie is such interesting to me b/c of the action, the effects, and the mixing to the set. Wish Hulk fans would be proud if this was a classic. I recommend this who wants to feel any difference to it.And definitely check out:Return of the Incredible Hulk (1988)Trial of the Incredible Hulk (1989)Death of the Incredible Hulk (1990)The Incredible Hulk TV Series (Seasons 1 & 2)The Incredible Hulk- Return of the Beast (1997)Like I told ya you won't be dissappointed if u see this 'cuz I'ma get it DVD also even tho I have it on VHS. Rest in peace to my man Bill Bixby who is in good spirits now. Wish he could've made it on the 4th installment of the Hulk film THE REVENGE OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK or REBIRTH OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK.",5,Give it 2 thumbs up 4 the pilot movie,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2234,"['actually', 'loved', 'show', 'TV', 'pilot', 'once', 'aired', 'CBS', 'soon', 'got', 'back', 'TV', 'SCI-FI', 'when', '1st', 'catch', 'premiere', 'back-to-back', 'episodes', 'Yep', 'not', 'something', 'disappoint', 'great', 'movie', 'real', 'side', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'whom', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'founder', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'changed', 'David', ""'cuz"", 'Bruce', 'was', 'too', 'homosexual', 'Reason', 'why', 'did', ""'cuz"", 'reason', 'name', 'add', 'TV', 'series', ""'78"", 'demise', '1982', 'So', 'sad', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'not', 'here', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'definitely', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'stars', 'such', 'good', 'man', 'miss', 'deerly', 'Wish', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stay', 'long', 'long', 'period', 'short', 'started', 'off', 'when', 'David', 'Banner', 'begin', 'losing', 'wife', 'automobile', 'accident', 'soon', 'transformed', 'doctor', 'associtate', 'Dr.', 'Elaina', 'Marks', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sullivan', 'begin', 'testing', 'people', ""'bout"", 'health', 'what', 'feel', 'stress', 'then', 'started', 'doing', 'lil', 'experiement', 'gamma', 'reactions', 'probably', 'known', 'gamma', 'rays', ""'ll"", 'say', 'once', 'office', 'car', 'when', 'get', 'mad', 'transformed', '7-foot', 'green', 'tall', 'man', 'known', 'Hulk', 'played', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'concl', 'back', 'Jack', 'McGee', 'played', 'Jack', 'Colvin', 'wanted', '4', 'murder', ""Y'know"", 'David', 'Banner', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'serious', 'here', 'what', 'doing', 'could', 'be', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Hulk', 'could', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Similar', 'book', 'read', 'Robert', 'Louis', 'Stevenson', 'movie', 'such', 'interesting', 'action', 'effects', 'mixing', 'set', 'Wish', 'Hulk', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'was', 'classic', 'recommend', 'who', 'feel', 'difference', 'it.And', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Return', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', '1988', 'Trial', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', '1989', 'Death', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', '1990', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'Series', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Incredible', 'Hulk-', 'Return', 'Beast', '1997', 'told', 'ya', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissappointed', 'u', 'see', ""'cuz"", ""I'ma"", 'get', 'DVD', 'also', 'even', 'tho', 'have', 'VHS', 'Rest', 'peace', 'man', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'who', 'good', 'spirits', 'now', 'Wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', '4th', 'installment', 'Hulk', 'film', 'THE', 'REVENGE', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'HULK', 'REBIRTH', 'THE', 'INCREDIBLE', 'HULK']",N/A
