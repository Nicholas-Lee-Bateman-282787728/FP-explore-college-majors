The original songs created for the DVD are really good (I cannot stand them myself but my daughter loves, loves, loves them, and that's what it's all about, right?) Anyway, don't worry about your baby not ""getting"" it. Sure they talk about advanced concepts like pitch and tempo, but they make it very interesting. It is also a good introduction to the different musical instruments and various types of music (rock, blues, etc.)",5,Best Brainy Baby Video,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,553,"['daughter', 'been', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', '18', 'months', 'old', 'now', '3', 'still', 'now', 'again', 'original', 'songs', 'created', 'DVD', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'daughter', 'loves', 'loves', 'what', 'right', 'Anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'baby', 'not', 'getting', 'Sure', 'talk', 'advanced', 'concepts', 'pitch', 'tempo', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'also', 'good', 'introduction', 'different', 'musical', 'instruments', 'various', 'types', 'music', 'rock', 'blues', 'etc']",Brainy Baby Music Classic

There are exercises right after that for the kids to practice. They're easy and fun to do.The BAD RESULTAt the back of the DVD cover, it says ""Special Features: Sing Alongs"". However, there are only 2 songs with lyrics displayed on screen for singing along. Moreover, they are hidden in Extra section. These songs are bad, not interesting to sing.In the main section, there are many interesting songs but they have no lyrics displayed on screen. Consequently, we can't sing along. I think as a music DVD for kids, it should have on-screen lyrics so that the kids can sing along while watching it. In this regard, Sing-along DVDs by Sesame Street and VeggieTales are better.Because of this, I gave it 3 stars.",3,MIXED RESULTS,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,836,"['DVD', 'MIXED', 'RESULTSThe', 'GOOD', 'RESULTIt', 'cleverly', 'visually', 'concepts', 'rhythm', 'tempo', 'melody', 'harmony', 'are', 'exercises', 'right', 'kids', 'practice', ""'re"", 'easy', 'fun', 'do.The', 'BAD', 'RESULTAt', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Special', 'Features', 'Sing', 'Alongs', 'However', 'are', 'only', '2', 'songs', 'lyrics', 'displayed', 'screen', 'singing', 'along', 'Moreover', 'are', 'hidden', 'Extra', 'section', 'songs', 'are', 'bad', 'not', 'interesting', 'sing.In', 'main', 'section', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'songs', 'have', 'lyrics', 'displayed', 'screen', 'Consequently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'along', 'think', 'music', 'DVD', 'kids', 'should', 'have', 'on-screen', 'lyrics', 'kids', 'can', 'sing', 'along', 'watching', 'regard', 'Sing-along', 'DVDs', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'VeggieTales', 'are', 'better.Because', 'gave', '3', 'stars']",Brainy Baby Music Classic

An older child may thoroughly enjoy it however. The lessons are presented in short increments but not the most exciting manner. If you have a little one, check out the ""Trebellina"" DVD instead.  Not only are little kids riveted, but they actually learn more advanced material (like how to read written note music -- yes, really -- and pitch training) than on this DVD.  It is all in the way it is presented.  From a parents' perspective, the music on Trebellina is really fun as well.  My toddler liked Brainy Baby but LOVED Trebellina and learned much more from it.  She was reading music at 3 yo and started taking piano lessons.  Her teachers were amazed at what she already knew, how good her ear was, and how quickly she picked up concepts.  If you want your little one to learn music, look at another product but keep this in mind for an older child.",1,I've seen better!,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,964,"['DVD', 'very', 'educational', 'much', 'not', 'interesting', 'one', 'two', 'even', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'older', 'child', 'may', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'however', 'lessons', 'are', 'presented', 'short', 'increments', 'not', 'most', 'exciting', 'manner', 'have', 'little', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'Trebellina', 'DVD', 'instead', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'little', 'kids', 'riveted', 'actually', 'learn', 'more', 'advanced', 'material', 'how', 'read', 'written', 'note', 'music', 'yes', 'really', 'pitch', 'training', 'DVD', 'way', 'presented', 'parents', 'perspective', 'music', 'Trebellina', 'really', 'fun', 'well', 'My', 'toddler', 'liked', 'Brainy', 'Baby', 'LOVED', 'Trebellina', 'learned', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'reading', 'music', '3', 'yo', 'started', 'taking', 'piano', 'lessons', 'teachers', 'were', 'amazed', 'what', 'already', 'knew', 'how', 'good', 'ear', 'was', 'how', 'quickly', 'picked', 'up', 'concepts', 'want', 'little', 'one', 'learn', 'music', 'look', 'product', 'keep', 'mind', 'older', 'child']",Brainy Baby Music Classic

Babies can listen to this, I always played all kinds of music to my children when they were small, and they turned out to be very bright.

When we received it I sat my son down and watched it with him. He just was NOT interested in this video. After a few minutes he went off and started playing with his toys. At 2 he's not interested in knowing wind instruments, string instruments, quartets, harmony, etc. My son loves music and he loves making music on his keyboard and he owns alot of musical instruments he loves playing. This video seemed a bit to advanced to be understood by a 2 or 3yr old unless they're gifted. I'm going to put this video up and try it when my son's 3.5 or 4yrs old. If you've got a 2yr old who's interested in music I'd suggest ""Blue's Big Musical"" wich is more toddler friendly.
