The only thing I didn't like about this product was the fact instead of having the select all to watch each episode simultaneously; you select an episode and it plays through and then goes back to main menu for the next episode in line.

What I want to say is this Chuck Norris is one of the most irresponsible public personalities right now.  On his Facebook page he and his wife are denouncing our President, Barack Obama, and claiming in pseudo mystical words that when our President is re-elected it will be the most terrible time for this country.  The end of the world kind of terrible.  Their rant is alarming.  Alarming because Mr. Norris has a supportive fan base.  And it is irresponsible simply because of that.  Say what you will about our President to state and use your fame to bolster your words that the end of the world IS quite literally on the horizon is irresponsible, unprofessional and just plain stupid.  John Wayne, another die hard steely jarred Republican would NEVER talk like this.  I don't know what the motive is behind the Facebook rant of Mr. Norris.  But I do know it is irresponsible and dumb.  About as dumb as most of his films, some of which I've seen, and as dumb as this series.  As an aside no more dumb than alot of current television.But Mr. Norris, you'd better hope Mr. Obama wins another 4 years.  Because if Romeny/Ryan wins, this $119.00 price tag for your complete series will be totally beyond the abilities of the white working class people who from my perspective seem to be your biggest audience.  They won't be able to afford this at all.  Not after Romney/Ryan dismantles every program that is currently in place helping to put working class lives back together.Mr. Norris your blatant words will come back to haunt you in the pocketbook if people are silly enough swallow your Facebook rant.  The poor will be even poorer and the middle class will become a cypher and none of these people will be able to buy any of you films.  No purchases, no money.Another Republican ""acting"" against his self interest.  Why am I so suprised?But I'll say one thing for Mr. Norris and that is by the early 80's he was one of the first who openly supported our Vietnam Vets.  How years later he can come up with this diatribe on Facebook, this ""Revelations"" style rant is beyond me.  I hope it will be beyond anyone one else who reads it too.",1,Give me a break!,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,2221,"['watched', 'steely', 'jarred', 'character', 'couple', 'times', 'Cowboy', 'hat', 'Ninja', 'What', 'want', 'say', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'one', 'most', 'irresponsible', 'public', 'personalities', 'right', 'now', 'Facebook', 'page', 'wife', 'are', 'denouncing', 'President', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'claiming', 'pseudo', 'mystical', 'words', 'when', 'President', 're-elected', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'terrible', 'time', 'country', 'end', 'world', 'kind', 'terrible', 'rant', 'alarming', 'Alarming', 'Mr.', 'Norris', 'supportive', 'fan', 'base', 'irresponsible', 'simply', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'President', 'state', 'use', 'fame', 'bolster', 'words', 'end', 'world', 'IS', 'quite', 'literally', 'horizon', 'irresponsible', 'unprofessional', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'John', 'Wayne', 'die', 'hard', 'steely', 'jarred', 'Republican', 'would', 'NEVER', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'motive', 'Facebook', 'rant', 'Mr.', 'Norris', 'do', 'know', 'irresponsible', 'dumb', 'as', 'dumb', 'most', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'as', 'dumb', 'series', 'aside', 'more', 'dumb', 'alot', 'current', 'television.But', 'Mr.', 'Norris', ""'d"", 'better', 'hope', 'Mr.', 'Obama', '4', 'years', 'Romeny/Ryan', '119.00', 'price', 'tag', 'complete', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'abilities', 'white', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'who', 'perspective', 'seem', 'be', 'biggest', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'Not', 'Romney/Ryan', 'program', 'currently', 'place', 'helping', 'put', 'working', 'class', 'back', 'together.Mr', 'Norris', 'blatant', 'words', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'pocketbook', 'people', 'are', 'silly', 'enough', 'swallow', 'Facebook', 'rant', 'poor', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'poorer', 'middle', 'class', 'will', 'become', 'cypher', 'none', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'films', 'purchases', 'money.Another', 'Republican', 'acting', 'self', 'interest', 'Why', 'am', 'so', 'suprised', ""'ll"", 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'Mr.', 'Norris', 'early', '80', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'who', 'openly', 'supported', 'Vietnam', 'Vets', 'How', 'years', 'later', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'diatribe', 'Facebook', 'Revelations', 'style', 'rant', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'anyone', 'one', 'else', 'who', 'too']",N/A

1316086,A2TRDBTC8AF943,B0030Y12AU,rdaaamg,"[12, 13]",I like this series because Cordell Walker is a half indian and half white man who also is a Texas Ranger.  He believes in the law and justice.  He does whatever it takes to bring in the bad guys. He also is very well known and feared by villians and run when he comes their way.  Walker is very active in the community helping children stay away from drugs through a program he helped to create for the kids.  He also helps anyone who wants to change from being a bad guy to a good guy.  Walker even learns that love is the most important thing and living without it makes life less interesting.  He gets married and learns the challenges of marriage.  He also loses a very close friend but he uses it to reach out to people.  This is a really good series that shows how the law works and lives get intertwined through everday contact.,5,"Walker, Texas Ranger series",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,835,"['like', 'series', 'Cordell', 'Walker', 'half', 'indian', 'half', 'white', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'law', 'justice', 'whatever', 'bring', 'bad', 'guys', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'feared', 'villians', 'run', 'when', 'way', 'Walker', 'very', 'active', 'community', 'helping', 'children', 'stay', 'away', 'drugs', 'program', 'helped', 'create', 'kids', 'also', 'anyone', 'who', 'change', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'Walker', 'even', 'love', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'living', 'life', 'less', 'interesting', 'married', 'challenges', 'marriage', 'also', 'very', 'close', 'friend', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'really', 'good', 'series', 'how', 'law', 'get', 'intertwined', 'everday', 'contact']",N/A
