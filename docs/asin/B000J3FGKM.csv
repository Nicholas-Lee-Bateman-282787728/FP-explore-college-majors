That's what happened when I saw this DVD.  Now, I'll be the first to admit, I'm down with the Hotties of the Pussycat Dolls.  I love their sexy, hot bodies, crawling across the screen in their awesome videos.  Don' cha! is one of my favorite songs I hear on the radio, and I always crank it as I'm rolling down the block in my sweet Toyota Sienna mini-van!But I didn't expect much from this eye candy, beyond a hit or two, and 90% filler.  Not the case with these SBILF's (Single B I'd like to F).  They are very talented and very yummy to watch.  A great combination.I highly recommend this little package.

1024421,A1ZFJSOOPTLK2I,B000J3FGKM,Lara,"[2, 2]","This DVD is a must have for any die-hard Pussycat Dolls fans out there.The DVD begins with an intro of all the Dolls, with Don't Cha music playing in the background as the girls come on the screen along with each of their names.After that the main menu screen comes up for you to choose which area of the disc you'd like to see.  They have a cute kitty paw when you change to each selection :)The choices you have at this menu are:-Play the LIVE show. (Buttons, Beep, I Don't Need A Man, Feelin' Good, Stickwitu, Show Me What You Got Interlude, Wait A Minute, & Don't Cha).-View all the videos (which have 2 behind the scenes extras for Buttons and Beep).-Meet the Dolls (the Dolls go through telling you their backgrounds and so forth).-Extras (Plays the video for Don't Cha in the Karaoke version so you can sing along to it yourself as the words are highlighted at the bottom)-Credits (that sort of explains itself)-Dress Like A Doll (brings up a screen with Melody on the right with PCD merchandise on the left and tells you about their boutique collection).As someone said previous to my post, the color on the live performance is a bit off, but it definitely doesn't take away from the overall feel of the DVD.  They all still look beautiful!On the inside of the DVD, there is a booklet with the same cover on it as the front displays, on the inside gives more detailed info about the videos etc. and on the back of it is a big Pussycat Dolls heart symbol.This is a great DVD to purchase and is cheaper to get it here at Amazon than at WalMart at the moment, f.y.i.

They even introduce themselves and each perform their own brief solo dances.  My main complaint is that the concert itself is too short.  It seemed to be only 5-6 songs.The bonus material includes interviews with all the girls and how they got to the group (I didn't realilze that Nicole was Hawaiian).  The girls look very different in those interviews as they wear very little makeup.There are also all the videos and there is an additional version of ""Don't Cha"" that is Karaoke.

Well, yes it is great but there is a few minor things wrong with it that knock a star off it. I'll get onto these in a minute, first I'd like to mention the good things.Yes, I'm a PCD fan. I don't care what you think, I love the Dolls! I got excited when I heard they were releasing a DVD, especially as it has live performances on it.When I say live, I mean LIVE. No miming for these girls, the 6 songs and the interlude they do is all completely utterly live. Nicole proves how amazing her voice is, I wasn't such a fan of hers beforehand but after watching her sing ""Feelin Good"" I now ADORE her voice, she is superb. Melody and Carmit have also proven they should be given more lead vocals. All the hits are included on this live performance, and most have dance breakdowns in the middle and sound fabulous live. The Dolls sound great singing live, anybody who says they can't sing should give this a watch. The ""Show Me What You Got"" interlude is one of my favourite parts - the Dolls all sing about each other and do a little dance by theirselves - a highlight is Ashley putting her foot over her head! I was very impressed with the Dolls live performance, but the crowd wasn't so enthused, they didn't scream or sing along or anything. It kind of ruined the vibe.The next bit on the DVD is the videos - they include all 6 videos to the singles. My fave video is ""I Don't Need A Man"" - it's funny, girly and pink and the Dolls look amazing! All the videos are great though. Also included is behind the scenes footage for the ""Beep"" and ""Buttons"" video -in the ""Buttons"" footage there is a segment of Nicole singing ""Feelin Good"" with Snoop Dogg and she changes the lyrics to be about him, it's very cute.The third bit is a section where the Dolls introduce themselves - they each have a video segement where they talk about how they made it into the PCD and the other Dolls talk about them. I felt like I knew a bit more about them afterwards! The girls seem very sweet and real, and like such nice people. There's also a segment on how the PCD got started and about how their music is made.Now what are the bad things? Well, like a previous reviewer said, you can't skip the intro when you first start the DVD - you have to sit through it, and it gets annoying at times. The behind the scenes footage during the live performances was also mentioned - I'd like to see the whole performance of a song not just bits of it. And I think even though the stuff on the DVD is great, there's not enough.But don't let those things put you off, this is worth it just for the live gig! The Dolls are talented and it definitely shows on this DVD - they seem genuinelly nice and friendly. The Dolls RULE!",4,A great DVD,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2756,"['think', 'DVD', 'great', 'then', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'Why', 'not', '5', 'Well', 'yes', 'great', 'few', 'minor', 'things', 'wrong', 'star', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', 'first', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'good', 'things.Yes', ""'m"", 'PCD', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'think', 'love', 'Dolls', 'got', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'especially', 'live', 'performances', 'it.When', 'say', 'live', 'mean', 'LIVE', 'No', 'miming', 'girls', '6', 'songs', 'interlude', 'do', 'completely', 'utterly', 'live', 'Nicole', 'how', 'amazing', 'voice', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'fan', 'hers', 'beforehand', 'watching', 'sing', 'Feelin', 'Good', 'now', 'ADORE', 'voice', 'superb', 'Melody', 'Carmit', 'have', 'also', 'proven', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'more', 'lead', 'vocals', 'hits', 'are', 'included', 'live', 'performance', 'most', 'have', 'dance', 'breakdowns', 'middle', 'sound', 'fabulous', 'live', 'Dolls', 'sound', 'great', 'singing', 'live', 'anybody', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'should', 'give', 'watch', 'Show', 'Me', 'What', 'Got', 'interlude', 'one', 'favourite', 'parts', 'Dolls', 'sing', 'other', 'do', 'little', 'dance', 'theirselves', 'highlight', 'Ashley', 'putting', 'foot', 'head', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Dolls', 'live', 'performance', 'crowd', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'enthused', 'did', ""n't"", 'scream', 'sing', 'along', 'anything', 'kind', 'ruined', 'vibe.The', 'next', 'bit', 'DVD', 'videos', 'include', '6', 'videos', 'singles', 'fave', 'video', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Need', 'Man', 'funny', 'girly', 'pink', 'Dolls', 'look', 'amazing', 'videos', 'are', 'great', 'Also', 'included', 'scenes', 'footage', 'Beep', 'Buttons', 'video', '-in', 'Buttons', 'footage', 'segment', 'Nicole', 'singing', 'Feelin', 'Good', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'lyrics', 'be', 'very', 'cute.The', 'third', 'bit', 'section', 'where', 'Dolls', 'introduce', 'have', 'video', 'segement', 'where', 'talk', 'how', 'made', 'PCD', 'other', 'Dolls', 'talk', 'felt', 'knew', 'bit', 'more', 'afterwards', 'girls', 'seem', 'very', 'sweet', 'real', 'such', 'nice', 'people', 'also', 'segment', 'how', 'PCD', 'got', 'started', 'how', 'music', 'made.Now', 'are', 'bad', 'things', 'Well', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'intro', 'when', 'first', 'start', 'DVD', 'have', 'sit', 'annoying', 'times', 'scenes', 'footage', 'live', 'performances', 'was', 'also', 'mentioned', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'whole', 'performance', 'song', 'not', 'just', 'bits', 'think', 'even', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'great', 'not', 'enough.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'things', 'put', 'off', 'worth', 'just', 'live', 'gig', 'Dolls', 'are', 'talented', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'seem', 'genuinelly', 'nice', 'friendly', 'Dolls', 'RULE']",N/A
