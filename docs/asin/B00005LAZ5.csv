It is about two strangers that come to trust each other and become great friends. I have seen this movie numerious times and have never tired of seeing it.

This movie is one of those gems, and I'm not suprised, because the 80's produced several memorable movies for me. This movie deals with longing, hopefulness, virginity, and some fun. I used to try to look for this movie from time to time, and had forgotten the title. I was irritated , because I remembered the name Eddie, and everytime I'd look it up; the title; Eddie, that basketball movie w/ Whoop would show up, and I'm like NOoooo!!!
