But the vast majority of these clips are more for sentimental value than exemplars of his genius.  Obviously, watching MG lip-synch is of limited appeal, made none the more enticing because of the mediocre video quality.  And some of the live performances are simply frustrating.  He performs Heard It Through the Grapevine without back up singers or musicians so he can't perform much of the song.  (Although it is hilarious watching him perform in front of a crowd of old white folk who sit and watch as if they are listening to a lecture on cleaning products.  How those people were able to avoid moving to the music at least a little bit . . . well, it's quite disturbing.)Thinking about all of the great performers from the sixties like Marvin, Sam Cooke or Jackie Wilson for who there is so little quality performance footage is heartbreaking.  If you'd like a scrapbook to prompt thoughts of the magic that Marvin offered, this dvd is fine.

This collection only leaves fans wanting more.  Some Marvin is better than none, but this left me wishing there were more hits and interviews.

Just watch him the first couple minutes, sliding his smooooth phrases in there like a great sax player blowing perfect and free, his timing beyond impeccable, his voice so silky and mellow but sharp and tight. And then watch one of the greatest electric bass players who ever lived, the man who made really made that thing come alive in a whole new way, James Jamerson, standing right behind Marvin, just killin' it with sinewy, bouncing lines...that's the real thing, period.It don't get no better than that. The audience knows it too, and are clearly transfixed; that song and album defined the moment and the whole vibe of this clip is transcendent.The '81 Let's Get It On is almost as good, and dig that mic technique. Very nice dance moves too and even though his voice is shot from basing Mr. Gaye still delivers the goods and takes it out into the realm of pure floating soulfulness.The other live peak is Marvin on the piano singing Grapevine. Gorgeous music.I love the clips of picnics in the 'hood during WGO, and how they danced in the park and generally had fun. It took me back to my childhood in the late 60s/early 70s, and my memories of people being a lot happier and freer than ever since are borne out by these clips. We've really lost that groove. Sigh.The many other tracks, most of which are lip syncs, are varied and nowhere near the good live stuff (though all the songs are classics so who can mind hearing them in good remastered sound?), but it's still a trip to see Marvin in action, and the interview  clips have some good moments. The man was smooth, and still so sincere. You can believe it when he says it, whatever it is.And look at those actresses sitting beside MG during the talk shows. Kate Jackson and the other girl are both mesmerized. The man had the kavorka! Hilarious to see them so transfixed. No wonder Marvin had a sex jones; he could get anything he wanted, all the time.But he deserved it, because he delivered the soul goods like none except Sam, JB, Smokey and a few others.Watch him trying to get the conga player to mellow out during the break in WGO, and finally just force him to chill, and then floooow into a fine little rap that bubbles over with feeling and dynamics. Magic. I get chills watching that tune. The picnic clips and Jamerson funkin' it up behind Gaye only make it that much more perfect.I'll be loving this What's Going On for the rest of my life.Thank you, brother Marvin.

Pictures of various promotional posters and such line the inner cover and the liner booklet is most informative and extensive!  A Forward written by Otis Williams of the Temptations is Otis' fond memories of Marvin.  He mentions sitting at the piano with Marvin while Marvin plays with some jazz chords, asking Otis what the root note of each one is.  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall to catch that memory!Watching Marvin's performances from the 60s to the early 80s gave me a new light on the hits!  Most was lip-synched, but still just to see him on stage is a treat!  There is a video of Marvin singing GRAPEVINE, playing piano at one point, and towards the end he was given a false ending, but he WORKED IT!  Marvin and Tammi's duet AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH I have never seen in its entirety and just watching that chemistry was awesome!Now as for the 70s Marvin, two videos were included: WHAT'S GOING ON/WHAT'S HAPPENING BROTHER, which were taken from the SAVE THE CHILDREN movie.  You can see Earl Van Dyke, James Jamerson, and Eddie Bongo jammin'!  There is also a promotional video from Motown for A FUNKY SPACE REINCARNATION...very space age! Imagine Marvin in a glitter outfit with his band, smoke and female dancers flocking all around him!  There is also COME GET TO THIS/LET'S GET IT ON where he does his famous ""turn of the lights"" monologue.  His guitarist was shown and I believe he played on the 1980 LIVE IN MONTREUX DVD as well!  Then there's the EGO TRIPPIN' OUT video he did on Dinah Shore's show with yet another female dancer.  The single was included on 81's IN OUR LIFETIME LP, but apparently it was being promoted in 1979 for the LOVE MAN album, which never saw the light.1981's highlight for me was HEAVY LOVE AFFAIR on FOLLLIES, a show out of Belgium where Marvin was living at the time.  I had to pull out my LP after listening to it as I had forgotten how funky this song is!  HEAVY (once again talks about him and Jan) has always reminded me of Rick James, everything from the music down to the phrasing of the lyrics!Even added treats: in between songs, Marvin spoke about his life and his music, even at one point describing seeing his daughter Nona being born!  There is also an acapella section where you watch the videos while listening only to his vocal track of 7 of his 60s hits!Still a great DVD to own, although the IMPORT version has the entire Belgium concert (why must we Americans SUFFER!?!?!?!?!?)!Reelin' and Universal...can't wait for the Temptations DVD!

976136,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000EPFDAI,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[11, 11]","I used to watch live performances of Michael Jackson and people would be falling all over the place. I'd always wonder ""How in the world can you connect with an artist THAT much?""  Those were the days before I was old enough to understand what music can do to someone's soul.  Marvin Gaye makes my heart beat faster and my eyes water. I am CRAZY about that man's voice. When I walked into a bookstore, I snatched this DVD up so fast you would've thought I was on fast forward.His voice is beautiful and the emotion that comes out of him is outstanding. The first six performances were frustrating for me to watch because it showed how strong segregation was.  The audience was predominantly white and the atmosphere very stiff, but I wanted to hear his songs.  Even in an audience that seemed to look at him as more of a puppet than respect him as an artist, he went into his own little world and boooooooy, did he sing those songs.  When I got to #7 ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and saw his very lustful performance with Tammi Terrell...that was IT.  It was what I'd been looking for all along.  Those two looked like they wanted to get a room and stop the song, and I cracked up. I felt like I was sneaking and watching the performance, but they didn't know they were live.  I'll tell you one thing...those two must've made one helluva couple!Every single song he sang moved my spirit and made me dance around the room, but the two that stood out most to me were ""What's Going On?"" when they showed how black neighborhoods looked, how the war was treating the world, the bungalows reminded me of my old neighborhood, and he was so vulnerable in the song.  The second song was my all-time favorite song in the world ""Let's Get It On.""  HE DID THAT SONG!  That man sang that song like a woman was standing right in front of him...I wonder what kind of actor he'd have made, because you couldn't tell me he wasn't doing one helluva an acting job imagining what he'd do to that woman.  When he started whispering at the end like he was trying to coax her into going into the dark...wow.There is no better R&B; artist than Marvin Gaye, in my eyes. He has the soul, the heart, the spirit, the class, and the voice of an artist that could move through any decade and still be THE top artist. I really wish he'd have had the chance to do more songs...but I don't know what made his father do what he did and I'm not here to judge that.  I didn't know him personally and can make no judgments about his personal business.

976137,A3KOMZ79UJSZ2I,B000EPFDAI,Soulboogiealex,"[16, 16]","Marvin Gaye is one of the most legendary Soul singers of all time. Yet up on till now he didn't have a proper DVD release. A mistake that ""The Real Thing"" Justly corrects. The DVD paints a picture of how Marvin's career looked like on stage. Motown chose for a clips approach, which is probably best in Marvin's case. Marvin Gaye never liked to be on stage, never liked to be out there shaking his ass. It is known that Marvin only toured when he really had to. Gaye hit rock bottom financially a couple of times during his career and usually around those times he would be persuaded to tour in order to pay of his debts. This unwillingness to perform often showed on his live albums. In concert Marvin only reached the stellar heights he did in the studio, periodically. By taking the clip approach this DVD avoids that problem and manages to give us an insight in how his music developed over the years.""The Real Thing"" is pretty much a greatest hits overview. It starts out with young Marvin performing his first hit, Hitch Hike, and then continues thru the stellar Tammi Terrell duets to his later work. The clips stop where Marvin left Motown at Heavy Love Affair. All the way you can't help but marvel over the flexibility of his voice and the diversity of the material he's tackled over the years.For those curious how an entire show of Marvin looked like, the DVD features a lot of great bonus material. Included is the full performance used in the Belgium documentary ""Save the Children"". We can only hope that Motown will one day decide to release this film entirely. As I recall its one of the better documentaries on Marvin Gaye around. Other bonus material is a nice and sometimes insightful interview and some a cappella versions of his biggest hits. Nothing essential but proper bonus material.The sum in total makes a fun and great DVD. Let's hope Motown will make this a first in a series.",5,Hopefully one of many to come,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1906,"['Marvin', 'Gaye', 'one', 'most', 'legendary', 'Soul', 'singers', 'time', 'up', 'till', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'proper', 'DVD', 'release', 'mistake', 'Real', 'Thing', 'Justly', 'DVD', 'picture', 'how', 'Marvin', 'career', 'looked', 'stage', 'Motown', 'chose', 'clips', 'approach', 'probably', 'best', 'Marvin', 'case', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'never', 'liked', 'be', 'stage', 'never', 'liked', 'be', 'there', 'shaking', 'ass', 'known', 'Marvin', 'only', 'toured', 'when', 'really', 'had', 'Gaye', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'financially', 'couple', 'times', 'career', 'usually', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'persuaded', 'tour', 'order', 'pay', 'debts', 'unwillingness', 'perform', 'often', 'showed', 'live', 'albums', 'concert', 'Marvin', 'only', 'reached', 'stellar', 'heights', 'did', 'studio', 'periodically', 'taking', 'clip', 'approach', 'DVD', 'problem', 'manages', 'give', 'insight', 'how', 'music', 'developed', 'years', 'Real', 'Thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'greatest', 'hits', 'overview', 'out', 'young', 'Marvin', 'performing', 'first', 'hit', 'Hitch', 'Hike', 'then', 'stellar', 'Tammi', 'Terrell', 'later', 'work', 'clips', 'stop', 'where', 'Marvin', 'left', 'Motown', 'Heavy', 'Love', 'Affair', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'marvel', 'flexibility', 'voice', 'diversity', 'material', 'tackled', 'years.For', 'curious', 'how', 'entire', 'show', 'Marvin', 'looked', 'DVD', 'lot', 'great', 'bonus', 'material', 'Included', 'full', 'performance', 'used', 'Belgium', 'documentary', 'Save', 'Children', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Motown', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'decide', 'release', 'film', 'entirely', 'recall', 'one', 'better', 'documentaries', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Other', 'bonus', 'material', 'nice', 'sometimes', 'insightful', 'interview', 'cappella', 'versions', 'biggest', 'hits', 'Nothing', 'essential', 'proper', 'bonus', 'material.The', 'sum', 'total', 'fun', 'great', 'DVD', 'Let', 'hope', 'Motown', 'will', 'make', 'first', 'series']",N/A
