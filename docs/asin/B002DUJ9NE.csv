1264302,A17EN3U7FW6CDP,B002DUJ9NE,Matthew DeLuca,"[20, 21]","This movie, ""Ghost Cat"" was very well done. It was featured on Animal Planet near Halloween time, a couple of years ago.I have been asking the studio to release it on DVD ever since.Ghost Cat stars a young Ellen Page, who already had quite the screen presence in this movie, before she hit it big in future movies.It is the story about a young girl (Page) who's Mom dies, and the girl and her Dad move to a new house in the town where her deceased Mom had grown up.While looking for a new house the Father and daughter see a charming house for sale. The house is owned by Mrs Ashboro, who lives there with her cat, Margaret. Mrs Ashboro points out that she doesnt want to sell the house, that her overzealous nephew, put the ""For Sale"" sign out without her permission.We later learn that the Nephew has an ulterior motive for wanting the house sold..namely the money that he would get from the sale.Mrs Ashboro is surprised when she sees the young girl (Page) petting her cat, Margaret, because Margaret isnt used to alot of visitors and doesnt do well with alot of folks.To make a long story short, Mrs Ashboro dies, and her cat Margaret dies shortly after...obviously of a broken heart.That's where the fun begins......Margaret, the caring soul that she is, comes back in spirit and helps the young girl and her friends to keep the house out of the hands of the greedy Nephew.Margaret saves the day, as cats so often do in movies and in real life.This is a charming movie that you will want to watch over and over again with your family members (two legged AND four legged).It is spooky, but not scary like a horror movie.It has just the right balance of fun, happiness, spookiness, and joy.I will be buying the DVD.I hope that you will too....it makes a great movie to watch every Halloween season with your family.",5,Ghost Cat is a Treat for the Whole Family!,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,1818,"['movie', 'Ghost', 'Cat', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'featured', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'Halloween', 'time', 'couple', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'studio', 'release', 'DVD', 'ever', 'since.Ghost', 'Cat', 'young', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'who', 'already', 'had', 'quite', 'screen', 'presence', 'movie', 'hit', 'big', 'future', 'movies.It', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'Page', 'who', 'Mom', 'dies', 'girl', 'Dad', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'town', 'where', 'deceased', 'Mom', 'had', 'grown', 'up.While', 'looking', 'new', 'house', 'Father', 'daughter', 'see', 'charming', 'house', 'sale', 'house', 'owned', 'Mrs', 'Ashboro', 'who', 'there', 'cat', 'Margaret', 'Mrs', 'Ashboro', 'out', 'doesnt', 'want', 'sell', 'house', 'overzealous', 'nephew', 'put', 'Sale', 'sign', 'permission.We', 'later', 'learn', 'Nephew', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'wanting', 'house', 'sold..namely', 'money', 'would', 'get', 'sale.Mrs', 'Ashboro', 'surprised', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'Page', 'petting', 'cat', 'Margaret', 'Margaret', 'isnt', 'used', 'alot', 'visitors', 'doesnt', 'do', 'well', 'alot', 'folks.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Mrs', 'Ashboro', 'cat', 'Margaret', 'shortly', 'obviously', 'broken', 'heart.That', 'where', 'fun', 'Margaret', 'caring', 'soul', 'back', 'spirit', 'young', 'girl', 'friends', 'keep', 'house', 'hands', 'greedy', 'Nephew.Margaret', 'day', 'cats', 'so', 'often', 'do', 'movies', 'real', 'life.This', 'charming', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'family', 'members', 'two', 'legged', 'four', 'legged', '.It', 'spooky', 'not', 'scary', 'horror', 'movie.It', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'fun', 'happiness', 'spookiness', 'joy.I', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'DVD.I', 'hope', 'will', 'too', '.it', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'Halloween', 'season', 'family']",Ghost Cat

Knowing it was a made-for-TV movie, I was a bit worried about the quality, although I really didn't need to be.It's a great story with lots of cute animals and a little (very sweet-not raunchy) romance. I watched it by myself first, but I would feel completely comfortable letting my kids watch this, and they're still pretty small - all except for the seance scene, but even that could be okay with some careful explanation of why you really don't want to mess with that stuff.This movie exceeded my expectations (I LOVED the opening scenes showing the relationship between the little &#34;old&#34; lady and her cat), and I highly recommend it for animal lovers and for those who like their &#34;scary&#34; stories to be a little less scary and much less gory/violent.",5,"Sweet, heartwarming fun for the whole family",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,923,"['love', 'cats', 'love', 'ghost', 'stories', 'so', 'when', 'found', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'was', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'members', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'Knowing', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'quality', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be.It', 'great', 'story', 'lots', 'cute', 'animals', 'little', 'very', 'sweet-not', 'raunchy', 'romance', 'watched', 'first', 'would', 'feel', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'letting', 'kids', 'watch', ""'re"", 'still', 'pretty', 'small', 'seance', 'scene', 'even', 'could', 'be', 'okay', 'careful', 'explanation', 'why', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'mess', 'stuff.This', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'LOVED', 'opening', 'scenes', 'showing', 'relationship', 'little', '34', 'old', '34', 'lady', 'cat', 'highly', 'recommend', 'animal', 'lovers', 'who', 'like', '34', 'scary', '34', 'stories', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'scary', 'much', 'less', 'gory/violent']",Ghost Cat
1264306,A36P4BN517L760,B002DUJ9NE,Platinu,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed it. I think Ellen Page is cute and funny, with vast potential as an actress. The storyline was simple and the entire movie would have benefited greatly if the script had followed the book more closely, but for what it is, it's a movie worth watching. One major thing I would done is have the main 'bad guy' explain at some point, even if it were just out loud to himself, that he needs 200,000 dollars in order to fix everything at the bank back to normal so he wouldn't be caught. The way the movie portrays it, you'd think he gave the house away and only needs 50,000 dollars. It would have made more sense if it had shown him cash a 150k check and perhaps mutter, &#34;Still 50,000 short...&#34; or something similar. That is, of course, just my opinion. That point just seemed a tad muddled.

1264308,A1S13O7V60UM9O,B002DUJ9NE,"Valerie ""ValsVicinity""","[1, 1]","On a whim we decided to stream this movie, simply because the idea of a ""ghost cat"" was intriguing. It's actually a television film that was made for Animal Planet, and appropriately there is a fairly large emphasis on the animals in the story--but not overly so. The animals don't talk or anything like that, they are portrayed in a more realistic fashion...with the exception of the ghost cat, of course! She tends to act like a feline Lassie, guiding people to important discoveries or emergencies.The acting is decent, and even the animals do a good job. The actions of the ""bad guys"" do tend to be a bit overdone, but this just makes it easy to root for the good guys, who are actually pretty likable despite the fact that some things (romances, in particular) are rather easy to predict. The casting was done well; everyone fit into their roles nicely with the exception of Kurt (Shawn Roberts), who looked quite a bit too old for the part he was playing. This made the slowly budding romance between him and Natalie a bit weird, since she was said to be in 9th grade, but Kurt looked early 20's--despite the fact that he was supposedly only in 11th grade. (In reality the actors only have 3 years separating them, but the age difference looked far larger on screen.) This is really the only flaw I can find to mention, and with a bit of imagination you can fairly easily overlook it.There's no inappropriate content, and the language is mild as well. There were a few instances of ""Oh my God!"", but I can't remember anything else that might be offensive.Animal lovers will obviously enjoy the story the most, but I'd be willing to bet that alot of kids would probably like it, too. Those who aren't animal lovers will likely scoff at it, and admittedly it's not very realistic...however, the idea of a ""ghost cat"" is amusing and I found it to be a decent way to spend 90 minutes of the evening. Even our dog got a kick out of the movie, with all the different animal noises heard at various times! :)",4,Amusing story for animal lovers,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,2007,"['whim', 'decided', 'stream', 'movie', 'simply', 'idea', 'ghost', 'cat', 'was', 'intriguing', 'actually', 'television', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'appropriately', 'fairly', 'large', 'emphasis', 'animals', 'story', 'not', 'overly', 'so', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'anything', 'are', 'portrayed', 'more', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'exception', 'ghost', 'cat', 'course', 'act', 'feline', 'Lassie', 'guiding', 'people', 'important', 'discoveries', 'emergencies.The', 'acting', 'decent', 'even', 'animals', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'actions', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'overdone', 'just', 'easy', 'root', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'likable', 'fact', 'things', 'romances', 'particular', 'are', 'rather', 'easy', 'predict', 'casting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'everyone', 'fit', 'roles', 'nicely', 'exception', 'Kurt', 'Shawn', 'Roberts', 'who', 'looked', 'quite', 'bit', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'was', 'playing', 'made', 'slowly', 'budding', 'romance', 'Natalie', 'bit', 'weird', 'was', 'said', 'be', '9th', 'grade', 'Kurt', 'looked', 'early', '20', 'fact', 'was', 'supposedly', 'only', '11th', 'grade', 'reality', 'actors', 'only', 'have', '3', 'years', 'separating', 'age', 'difference', 'looked', 'far', 'larger', 'screen', 'really', 'only', 'flaw', 'can', 'find', 'mention', 'bit', 'imagination', 'can', 'fairly', 'easily', 'overlook', 'inappropriate', 'content', 'language', 'mild', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'few', 'instances', 'Oh', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'else', 'might', 'be', 'offensive.Animal', 'lovers', 'will', 'obviously', 'enjoy', 'story', 'most', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'bet', 'alot', 'kids', 'would', 'probably', 'too', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'animal', 'lovers', 'will', 'likely', 'scoff', 'admittedly', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'however', 'idea', 'ghost', 'cat', 'amusing', 'found', 'be', 'decent', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'evening', 'Even', 'dog', 'got', 'kick', 'movie', 'different', 'animal', 'noises', 'heard', 'various', 'times']",Ghost Cat
