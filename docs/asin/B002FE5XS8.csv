1266089,A3C3HOGOHQIVN,B002FE5XS8,Addicted2blogs,"[2, 3]",Katt Williams is a complete and utter FOOL LOL!  Bernie Mac and George Carlin were my fav comedians up until there deaths. But now I think I've found a new favorite comedian. Please folks do not sleep on this! This DVD gives you a backstage & inside look into the man known as Katt Williams. It gives you a better understanding of who he is and why he does the things he does. This is not a traditional stand-up DVD but more behind the scenes documentary. A good buy!,5,OMG! LOL! SMH!

So when we saw this new release on the shelf in the store, we didn't hesitate to immediately toss it in with our groceries. With GREAT anticipation, we threw it into the player with some friends that night. It turned out to be some old footage from an older show made up almost entirely of material which can also found on his previously-released, BETTER DVDs- mixed in with a retarded interview that did nothing but break up the laughter with dull crap every 5 minutes. Some of the material was done slightly different then on the other DVDs which was OK, but there was only about 5% new material here, and none of it that great. Then we watched the special features, which ended up being a handful of really short and lame clips from poorly-recorded older shows.In short, I would get ""It's Pimpin Pimpin"", or ""The Pimp Chronicles pt 1"", or even ""American Hustle"" WAY before I would waste money or time on this one!This was VERY annoying. I'm going to try returning it to get my money back.

I messed around, viewed the DVD and sadly, I'm very disappointed! He recycled the same ol' jokes that he has been using for years with a little bit of alteration but they are still the same. He is in front of an audience, from 2005 in Washington D.C. It looks like a comedy house of some sort and not only are the jokes tired but the entire video is too. The only difference with this video is he has commentary while he is riding in a limo, which still is not worth the purchase of this DVD. If you are a Katt Williams fan, like myself, don't waste your money on this DVD. It's been a minute since he has released something and I figured he would have come up with some new stuff but as soon as it started I said to myself....SAME OL' MATERIAL! I hope this helps.... YMMV.

I had seen him the previous year as well but his last performance there was PHENOMENAL. I'm assuming this is the DVD for his last performances so this should be hilarious. It is unfortunate that Katt is now in retirement because he definitely went out at his peak. I read that there's also an intimate sit down interview with Katt on this DVD so I'm definitely looking forward to that as a true Katt fan. I hope he pull's a Mason Betha/Michael Jordan/Brett Favre/etc. move and flip flop his way back into comedy!Definitely copping this!",5,Come back to Comedy!!,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,634,"['had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'one', 'Katt', 'last', 'performances', 'Palace', 'Theatre', 'Albany', 'NY', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'year', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'performance', 'was', 'PHENOMENAL', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'DVD', 'last', 'performances', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'hilarious', 'unfortunate', 'Katt', 'now', 'retirement', 'definitely', 'went', 'out', 'peak', 'read', 'also', 'intimate', 'sit', 'down', 'interview', 'Katt', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'looking', 'forward', 'true', 'Katt', 'fan', 'hope', 'pull', 'Mason', 'Betha/Michael', 'Jordan/Brett', 'Favre/etc', 'move', 'flip', 'flop', 'way', 'back', 'comedy', 'Definitely', 'copping']",N/A

1266097,ADR1VF71TC8OL,B002FE5XS8,"Ryan ""Seller202""","[0, 0]","Well I have a little mixed reviews on this movie.  The stand up portion of this movie was pretty funny.  Not the most funny I have every seen from Kat but it was worth a laugh.  But what was disappointing was that it was not solely a Stand up special.  I guess that was my fault for buying it and not researching it first.  I found that he is REALLY REALLY FAKE when he is on stage.  He is not gangster, funny, and he even talks different.  It kind of turned me off to him.  I can honestly say I won't be buying anything else from him but if you are a huge Kat Williams fan than you will probably love it.  Like I said in my other reviews I am just opinionated and I know what I like.  This wasn't it.  No disrespect to those who do but it just wasn't for me.  There are some funny parts in it but not on the quality of say a ""Dane Cook"" or a ""Dave Chappelle"" or anything.  So purchase at your own risk.  If you have the money to blow check it out and see what you think.  Thanks again for reading and please leave some comments and tell me what you think.  I am curious to see if I am alone in thinking that it wasn't that good.Ryan",3,A little Disapointed,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1133,"['Well', 'have', 'little', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'stand', 'up', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Not', 'most', 'funny', 'have', 'seen', 'Kat', 'was', 'worth', 'laugh', 'what', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'solely', 'Stand', 'up', 'special', 'guess', 'was', 'fault', 'buying', 'not', 'researching', 'first', 'found', 'REALLY', 'REALLY', 'FAKE', 'when', 'stage', 'not', 'gangster', 'funny', 'even', 'different', 'kind', 'turned', 'off', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'anything', 'else', 'are', 'huge', 'Kat', 'Williams', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'just', 'opinionated', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'was', ""n't"", 'disrespect', 'who', 'do', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'are', 'funny', 'parts', 'not', 'quality', 'say', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'anything', 'So', 'purchase', 'own', 'risk', 'have', 'money', 'blow', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Thanks', 'again', 'reading', 'please', 'leave', 'comments', 'tell', 'what', 'think', 'am', 'curious', 'see', 'am', 'alone', 'thinking', 'was', ""n't"", 'good.Ryan']",N/A
