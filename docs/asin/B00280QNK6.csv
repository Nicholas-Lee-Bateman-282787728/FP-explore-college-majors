1254956,A1QS9CHFCEB3WJ,B00280QNK6,"Daniel Murphy ""Dan Murphy""","[27, 27]","You know how it goes:  Someone tells you an ""art"" film is good, you put it on your list, you Netflix or rent it.  And then it sits, because you don't have quite enough energy to watch something that might require your brain to kick into first gear.  Such was 12, with me, until I decided to give it the ""30 minute test"":  if I wasn't hooked in 30 minutes, back to Netflix with this sucker.I was hooked inside of ten minutes.  This Russian language film (English subtitles)serves notice that the Russki's really can make good films, REALLY good films.  Based on the premise of the original American drama Twelve Angry Men, a Chechen teen is accused of murdering his Russian stepfather.  The jury expects deliberation will take less than a half hour, the audience knows otherwise.Though borrowed from an American film, 12 is uniquely, and in many ways, purely Russian.  Using sharply defined acting and amazingly detailed character studies, 12 unfolds for Westerners an intimate portrait of Russia in the 21st century, and a fascinating and engaging portrait it is.  In a way reminiscent of Slumdog Millionaire, the story unfolds as each juror tells a story about life in Russia, each story but one whittling down the guilty votes.  Each story reveals the Russian soul and temperament in ways that a dry treatise simply cannot.Complete with a twist at the end that is engaging and powerful, this film will please any viewer that prides him/herself on being a student of foreign cinema.  A bit lengthy (hey, ever heard of a Russian novel that was SHORT?) 12 will reward a bit of patience richly.",4,"12 Is Not a 10, But Close!",1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,1592,"['know', 'how', 'Someone', 'art', 'film', 'good', 'put', 'list', 'Netflix', 'rent', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'enough', 'energy', 'watch', 'something', 'might', 'require', 'brain', 'kick', 'first', 'gear', 'Such', 'was', '12', 'decided', 'give', '30', 'minute', 'test', 'was', ""n't"", 'hooked', '30', 'minutes', 'back', 'Netflix', 'sucker.I', 'was', 'hooked', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Russian', 'language', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'notice', 'Russki', 'really', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'films', 'REALLY', 'good', 'films', 'Based', 'premise', 'original', 'American', 'drama', 'Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'Chechen', 'teen', 'accused', 'murdering', 'Russian', 'stepfather', 'jury', 'deliberation', 'will', 'take', 'less', 'half', 'hour', 'audience', 'borrowed', 'American', 'film', '12', 'uniquely', 'many', 'ways', 'purely', 'Russian', 'Using', 'sharply', 'defined', 'acting', 'amazingly', 'detailed', 'character', 'studies', '12', 'unfolds', 'Westerners', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'Russia', '21st', 'century', 'fascinating', 'engaging', 'portrait', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'story', 'unfolds', 'juror', 'story', 'life', 'Russia', 'story', 'one', 'whittling', 'down', 'guilty', 'votes', 'story', 'Russian', 'soul', 'temperament', 'ways', 'dry', 'treatise', 'simply', 'can', 'not', '.Complete', 'twist', 'end', 'engaging', 'powerful', 'film', 'will', 'please', 'viewer', 'being', 'student', 'foreign', 'cinema', 'bit', 'lengthy', 'hey', 'ever', 'heard', 'Russian', 'novel', 'was', 'SHORT', '12', 'will', 'reward', 'bit', 'patience', 'richly']",12

We are so use to remakes of foriegn films by hollywood. It was refreshing to see the reverse. Its as good as the original and better than Friedkin's remake. The Director even tied AC/Heat problems to construction issues and callousness. Very smart.Here are my cons resulting in a one point deduction. The Russians speak fast, and the subtitles had me rewinding a bit. This is a personal gnostic problem I have. I'm wondering if there are double meanings or hidden allegories, so I have to rewind when something is said I might chew on. Also, this movie is very long, so it was challenging.The Director did something remarkable, and unexpected. He played it like the original, deconstructing contemporary society past and present. I'll admit, my sympathies had long been for the far removed Caucuses, Jews and Siberian folk. Here the characters deal with their own pasts, their prejudices. The flashback sequencies and long personal stories make each flawed character sympathetic. No punches pulled. All along while the 12 very angry men are sitting in judgement of the youth, we see the tragic life of the youth revealed through the horror of war, the death of his parents, and the warmeth of his first adopted father. (Number of Dads is 3).This is 12 angry men placed in the Russian societal context, and yet a slight wink is made toward the hypothetical of the American form of courtroom justice. Very clever. The Director takes it farther, by revealing the faces of the killer(s), and leaves me rooting for FSB hit squads. That was neat trick.I came out of watching the film feeling intense hope for the future of Russia.The future of the youth is laid out in a myriad of possible tragic conclusions, not unlike the abyss of the US Foster Care program but worse. Yet, one glimmering hope for the boy is revealed and its tied to Greater Russian (ie Multi-cultural) Unity and Decency. The Law is a brick to build walls, and only mercy, respect and other virtues cultivated can tear down the prison we build for ourselves and our cultures.",4,"Hope for Russia, Hope for us all.",1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,2151,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'original', 'Friedkin', 'remake', 'might', 'leave', 'wondering', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'are', 'so', 'use', 'remakes', 'foriegn', 'films', 'hollywood', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'reverse', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'better', 'Friedkin', 'remake', 'Director', 'even', 'tied', 'AC/Heat', 'problems', 'construction', 'issues', 'callousness', 'Very', 'smart.Here', 'are', 'cons', 'resulting', 'one', 'point', 'deduction', 'Russians', 'speak', 'fast', 'subtitles', 'had', 'rewinding', 'bit', 'personal', 'gnostic', 'problem', 'have', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'are', 'double', 'meanings', 'hidden', 'allegories', 'have', 'rewind', 'when', 'something', 'said', 'might', 'chew', 'Also', 'movie', 'very', 'long', 'was', 'challenging.The', 'Director', 'did', 'something', 'remarkable', 'unexpected', 'played', 'original', 'deconstructing', 'contemporary', 'society', 'past', 'present', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'sympathies', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'far', 'removed', 'Caucuses', 'Jews', 'Siberian', 'folk', 'Here', 'characters', 'deal', 'own', 'pasts', 'prejudices', 'flashback', 'sequencies', 'long', 'personal', 'stories', 'make', 'flawed', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'punches', 'pulled', '12', 'very', 'angry', 'men', 'are', 'sitting', 'judgement', 'youth', 'see', 'tragic', 'life', 'youth', 'revealed', 'horror', 'war', 'death', 'parents', 'warmeth', 'first', 'adopted', 'father', 'Number', 'Dads', '3', '.This', '12', 'angry', 'men', 'placed', 'Russian', 'societal', 'context', 'yet', 'slight', 'wink', 'made', 'hypothetical', 'American', 'form', 'courtroom', 'justice', 'Very', 'clever', 'Director', 'farther', 'revealing', 'killer', 's', 'rooting', 'FSB', 'hit', 'squads', 'was', 'neat', 'trick.I', 'came', 'watching', 'film', 'feeling', 'intense', 'hope', 'future', 'Russia.The', 'future', 'youth', 'laid', 'out', 'myriad', 'possible', 'tragic', 'conclusions', 'not', 'abyss', 'US', 'Foster', 'Care', 'program', 'worse', 'one', 'glimmering', 'hope', 'boy', 'revealed', 'tied', 'Greater', 'Russian', 'ie', 'Multi-cultural', 'Unity', 'Decency', 'Law', 'brick', 'build', 'walls', 'only', 'mercy', 'respect', 'other', 'virtues', 'cultivated', 'can', 'tear', 'down', 'prison', 'build', 'ourselves', 'cultures']",12

But if you are familiar with ""Twelve Angry Men"" and know a bit of Russian, as I did, avoiding the abstraction of subtitles adds to the sense of contemporary Russian and Caucasian culture.I wish Mikhalkov had stuck to the ""one set"" rule of the original, which took place in a claustrophobic jury room (perhaps in a nod to everything falling apart in Russia over the years, Mikhalkov's court is in repair and the jurors have to use a high school gym; we also meet the Chechen defendant they are discussing, in scenes of his early life with the father he's charged with killing, and as he paces nervously in his cell awaiting his fate).Thoroughly enjoyable!

1254965,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00280QNK6,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","Nikita Mikhalkov has re-worked Sidney Lumet's 1957 film ""12 Angry Men"" for post-communist Russia in ""12"", which he co-wrote and directed. In contemporary Moscow, twelve jurors are to decide the fate of a Chechen young man (Apti Magamaev) who is accused of the stabbing death of his foster father, a former Russian army officer who adopted young Umar when he was orphaned in the Chechen War. As the jury room is undergoing renovations, the jurors are compelled to conduct their deliberations in the gymnasium of a nearby middle school. The court expects a quick verdict; so do the jurors. They are surprised to find that one among them, a physicist and recovered alcoholic (Sergei Makovetski), votes ""not guilty"". This begins a long day and night of arguments, re-enactments, and speculation about the case, until they reach a unanimous decision.Conventions of the American judicial system have been superimposed on Russia for dramatic purposes. In reality, Russian juries must only reach a majority, not unanimous, verdict, and appeals are unlimited. To give the deliberations more weight, the film's jury is working within the constraints of the American system. ""12"" seems to have been better received by foreigners than by Russians or Chechens, though. It's easy for foreigners to see the film as a social commentary in which the jurors represent different perspectives, classes, and backgrounds of a diverse and modern Russia. Like ""12 Angry Men"", it is not so much a comment on the working of the courts as an examination of the sources and consequences of people's prejudices, as well as a condemnation of moral laziness.I gather that Chechens see ""12"" as misleading in claiming that a Chechen defendant could get justice from a Russian court. They think it's unrealistic that a jury would be so diligent in deciding the fate of a Chechen. But that is true anywhere in the world. People don't care that much. The premise was never intended to be realistic. One Russian opposition journalist accused the film of being pro-corruption and pro-Putin. It seems opaque on the issue of corruption. And, while the filmmaker is a Putin supporter, it is difficult for a foreigner to judge the film's politics. I don't recognize the various allusions presented by the jury members. I was only struck by the long-held Russian view that businesspeople are corrupt and parasitic. And the film does seem to support jury trials, which have been a contentious issue in Russia since their revival in 1993.In the end, I was impressed by this film's ability to hold my attention for 2 hours and 37 minutes, even though it is talky, and I had to read subtitles the whole time. It gets going after a dull first 20 minutes. Predictably, most of the jurors give us their life stories so that we understand why they are so quick to find the defendant guilty -and so quick to change their minds. Intercut with the jury deliberations are flashbacks to Umar's experiences in wartorn Chechnya, as he awaits the verdict in his cell. Some speculation about the crime's true motives seems to be based on hearsay and overactive imaginations, which undercuts the film's themes to an extent. And the final moments of the deliberations feel contrived. But the characters and their speeches are generally engrossing.

The actors are brilliant in their portrayals, the script is a gem, the cinematography is perfect for the context. However, in the interest of full disclosure, to get the most out of this film, to fully appreciate it for the gem that it is, probably requires that the viewer is either a native Russian, or one that has been extensively exposed to Russian culture, to the language... to have a feeling for, an understanding of, the Russian ""soul"", the very unique modern Russian personality. For those that do not have such familiarity, the movie can provide an excellent vehicle with which to discover, to experience that unique personality.

1254972,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00280QNK6,Randy Keehn,"[3, 3]","It wasn't too many years ago when I first saw ""Twelve Angry Men"".  I was duly impressed but, like many things you wait a long time for, there were aspects of the movie that left me mildly disappointed.  I suppose it was the way it ended; it seemed to have been too abrupt.  When I saw that the Russians had made a new version of TAM I was skepticle and when I saw how long it was, I put it aside.When I watched ""12"" last Saturday night, I quickly became aware that the scope of ""12"" went beyond the scope of TAM.  We were to know the accused, his background, the conflict from which the tensions and prejudices arose.  The bulk of the movie was still the focus of 12 different men.  The drama of ""12"" (and TAM) was how each of them was confronted with themselves.  Each of them had their story to tell and in each of those stories was the unique perspective it brought to them and to those who would listen.  It took longer for these stories to come out and they went a lot longer than in TAM but the impact, to me, was greater in ""12"".The stories of the jury are interspliced with scenes from the accused, the circunstances and the crime.  While many of the aspects of the original play were there (the knife, the witnesses's testimony, etc), ""12"" adds to the outcome by adding a chapter (and a significant one at that) after the point in which TAM has concluded.  The gist of it was the question that the jurors had to confront.  In reaching the verdict they chose, were they willing to walk the walk besides just talking the talk.  Sounds simple enough but it was impressive how ""12"" challenged the viewers to consider the responsibilities of judgement; it's not so hard to do if you don't have to help clean up the mess.Finally, there was another compelling aspect of the movie in the form of a small bird which somehow got caught in the rather large jury room.  In the end, the last juror leaving opened a couple of large windows to give the bird a means of escape from its' comfortable prison.  The opened windows revealed a cold winter's storm with blowing snow.  What would the bird chose; challenging freedom or comfortable captivity?",4,Angry Men,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2143,"['was', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'was', 'duly', 'impressed', 'many', 'things', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'were', 'aspects', 'movie', 'left', 'mildly', 'disappointed', 'suppose', 'was', 'way', 'ended', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'abrupt', 'When', 'saw', 'Russians', 'had', 'made', 'new', 'version', 'TAM', 'was', 'skepticle', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'long', 'was', 'put', 'aside.When', 'watched', '12', 'last', 'Saturday', 'night', 'quickly', 'became', 'aware', 'scope', '12', 'went', 'scope', 'TAM', 'were', 'know', 'accused', 'background', 'conflict', 'tensions', 'prejudices', 'arose', 'bulk', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'focus', '12', 'different', 'men', 'drama', '12', 'TAM', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'confronted', 'had', 'story', 'tell', 'stories', 'was', 'unique', 'perspective', 'brought', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'took', 'longer', 'stories', 'come', 'out', 'went', 'lot', 'longer', 'TAM', 'impact', 'was', 'greater', '12', '.The', 'stories', 'jury', 'are', 'interspliced', 'scenes', 'accused', 'circunstances', 'crime', 'many', 'aspects', 'original', 'play', 'were', 'there', 'knife', 'witnesses', 'testimony', 'etc', '12', 'outcome', 'adding', 'chapter', 'significant', 'one', 'point', 'TAM', 'concluded', 'gist', 'was', 'question', 'jurors', 'had', 'confront', 'reaching', 'verdict', 'chose', 'were', 'willing', 'walk', 'walk', 'just', 'talking', 'talk', 'simple', 'enough', 'was', 'impressive', 'how', '12', 'challenged', 'viewers', 'consider', 'responsibilities', 'judgement', 'not', 'so', 'hard', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'help', 'clean', 'up', 'mess.Finally', 'was', 'compelling', 'aspect', 'movie', 'form', 'small', 'bird', 'somehow', 'got', 'caught', 'rather', 'large', 'jury', 'room', 'end', 'last', 'juror', 'leaving', 'opened', 'couple', 'large', 'windows', 'give', 'bird', 'means', 'escape', 'comfortable', 'prison', 'opened', 'windows', 'revealed', 'cold', 'winter', 'storm', 'blowing', 'snow', 'What', 'would', 'bird', 'chose', 'challenging', 'freedom', 'comfortable', 'captivity']",12
1254973,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00280QNK6,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 22]","""12"" is two title-words shorter and a full sixty-three minutes longer than ""Twelve Angry Men,"" the 1957 Sydney Lumet classic on which this turgid Russian drama is based.  Despite the obvious language difference, the Nikita Mikhalkov/Alexandr Novotosky/Vladimir Moiseyenko screenplay follows the Reginald Rose original - which began life as a ""Studio One"" teleplay in 1954 - fairly closely in form and outline.  Again, eleven members of a jury stand ready to convict a young man of first-degree murder (in this case, for killing his foster father, an officer in the Russian army, for money) - until, that is, the lone holdout is able to sow enough doubt in the other jurors' minds to eventually get them to vote his way.  And while in the original film the suspect faced racism and xenophobia on account of his being Hispanic, the suspect here suffers a similar fate for being Chechnyan.In the central role of the original dissenter, Sergei Makovetsky lacks the easily recognizable charm and charisma of Henry Fonda - and while this may make him a bit more believable as an ""everyman"" figure, it also makes him a less compelling focal point for a drama that takes far too long to play itself out.  The extended length results, primarily, from the inclusion of brief flashbacks to the defendant's past, recounting the lead-up to the crime and the crime itself, as well as from individual speeches that drone on long past the point where any point can still be made.  Each of the twelve jurors gets his moment in the spotlight to ham it up and declaim wildly on his theories about the case, his hatred of one ethnic group or another (in addition to anti-Chechnya sentiment, there's a great deal of anti-Semitism floating around the room as well), and the deplorable state of life in Russia - till the point where we no longer care about these people or the decision they're being forced to make.  Eventually, we just want to get out of that place as badly as the men who are trapped inside it.  And not all the talk about the Russian soul, not all the discussions of national politics or personal spleen-venting on the part of the participants can make us care one iota about the drama that`s unfolding.The question one must finally ask when watching ""12"" is why anyone would want to take a work like ""Twelve Angry Men,"" celebrated for its brevity and dramatic precision, and turn it into a lumbering, ponderous, elephantine bore - replete with endless speechifying and scenery-chewing performances.
