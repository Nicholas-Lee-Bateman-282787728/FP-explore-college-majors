Burke also talks about Darwin and evolution, discusses inventors such as Faraday and Edison, and examines how new scientific knowledge changes our values.  The narrator, in a prescient view of the Internet, mused then that the entire world might one day be connected electronically by computer.I saw an episode in this series as part of a course in college and was glad to see the series available on DVD.

1232886,A1QSSKI2U33K4R,B001RCL5SQ,"flashgordon ""flashgordon""","[2, 69]","I thought I'd note that this applies to ""The Day the Universe Changed"" as much as James Burke's ""Connections.""  The applicability comes from that of how the dark ages essentialy acts as a social 'clearing of the fields'.  There's also the way use of the pole star leads to problems when the sailors try to sail around Africa and find that they can't use it anymore.James Burke in his ""Connections"" and ""The Day the Universe Changed"" tries to show connections between science and history.  He finds all kinds of connections; but, it seems to me that sometimes some of his connections are not quite I guess the word is true, but that word is problematical, which I'm sure you know(probably better than me; i've only read general accounts . . . including ""Godel's Proof"" by I do believe a Nagel guy).  I like his third chapter of his ""Connections"" where he shows how the events that led to England speaking English and not something else are very much tied up with at least technological developments.  His accounts of the Knight and its influence on Medieval culture shows a kind of 'connections' that seem similar to other 'connections' throughout his books and videos.  He points out how the use of the horse as a vehicle for someone to perform jousting.  It's like the anser to one problem leads to two or more problems.  The knight on horseback subsequently needs a saddle which is connected to feet supports(forgetting the actual names here), and the horse needs a special collar devise to keep from getting choked.  The use of the horse needs horseshoes to help out the horse.  The use of the horse needed a certain amount of farming and so on and so forth. This example reminds me of other such connections.Like in his first chapter of his ""Connections"" he notes how farming leads to various technologies like irrigation.  He shows a few different connections actualy.  But, my point here is that it seems to me the really interesting connections are those that come about by a kind of daming up of nature(as in like a hydro-electric dam), or a clearing of the fields in farming.  You clear the fields and all of a sudden, your taking on the job of irrigation, pest control, and fertilizing.  Or, to get back to the daming up of nature, you dam it up and all of a sudden, you get electricity out.  In a similar way, you dam up nature somehow, and the pertinant fundamental concepts one needs to play with in an intellectual exercise comes out.I'm thinking that daming up nature is kind of like idealization in mathematics.  Idealization is one side of the abstraction coin of abstraction.  Philip Davis and Rueben Hersh explain the other kind of abstraction in their ""Mathematical Experience"" book.  They call it extraction.  Suzanne Langer in her ""Introduction to Symbolic Logic"" still gives the best account of this.  Everything has structure.  A structure consistes of a set of elements connected by a relation(s). A given structure's relations can take on many different sets of elements; i ran to the store; you ran to the movies.  Basicaly, the form stays the same in this case.  This defines abstraction in the sense of extraction.  Theorems are kindof proved generalizations.  Generalizations are abstractions.Numbers start out as idealizations, and then with ever more mathematical development take on higher levels of abstraction. When you count, you note certain phenomenon like sets of elements, a matching operation, and one-to-one correspondence.  But, then when addition comes along, your mapping from those idealizations to each other.  Number went from idealization to abstraction.  I mean 2+3=4+1.The point is that idealization led to problems like how do these idealizations combine?  The Pythagorean theorem led to irrationals, diophantine analyses, algebraic numbers.  The calculus led to calculus of variations, complex analyses.  The fundamental theorem of the Calculus led to Real analyses and the Lebegue integral because when mathematicians took a close logical look at it, they found cases that couldn't be accounted for by even Newton and Liebniz's initial understanding.  Once some land is cleared out, or an answer is established to some degree, more problems/questions arise.  The reason is kind of Godel's theorem.  A finite set of axioms cannot prove an infinity of truths. Or, to say the least, some phenomenon cannot be accounted for from a given finite set of axioms.  There's still points of vagueness.I mean like in Galileo's laws of speed.  They need reference points.  What reference points. This problem wasn't solved by Newton or Laplace.  It was solved by Einstein.  Then, he was able to derive Newtonian mechanics from his higher general theory.I get this idea about Godel's theorems and connections to everything from science and mathematics to Jacob Bronowski's ""Origin of Knowledge and Imagination."" He's saying how the universe is this infinitely detailed continuum.  And, that when we establish some boundary, it's really an artificiality.  Do you see a little number two laying around on the ground somewhere?  How about a bunch of zero dimensional points all lined up in a row?(I hope you don't think that I think that you do)  We establish a clearing.  We solve some problems, but there's still points of vagueness.  And, so by finding a way of defining those points of vagueness, we have new problems to solve.  When reading David Hilbert's article about the 23 unsolved problems around 1900, most problems were about defining some point of vagueness.Just to get back to James Burke for a second. The major interesting connections are either about how mathematics led to some technology like the Nuremburg Egg watch and clock making.  Or!  They're about the vacuum!  I mean by finding the vacuum, we're able to investigate gases, sound(or the absence of).  He mentions this in his second episode of his connections and the third one.  The steam engine then had something more to do with the vacuum than not as well.  And that's the major technological development in the second half of his connections.  And then, there's the lightbulb.  In his global warming videos, he notes how shifts in the weather for whatever reason led to this or that civilization appearing and technological developments.  I can't help noting how scientific periods comes after a dark ages.  The first one was really the Mesopotamians(in general) around 3000B.C. to the 1000 B.C.s.  Then, after a dark ages, the Greeks took much of that knowledge and put it in a deductive framework.  Then, then went further in conics and trigonometry, the three delian problems, number theory, and with Archemides, center points of odd shapes.  Then, as we all know the Kepler/Tycho Braha, Galileo, Newton  . . . came after a dark ages.I was watching Jacob Bronowski's ""Ascent of Man"" again maybe a month ago, and couldn't help noting that back in the times when people followed herds wherever they went(before the agricultural times), they couldn't think much of love.  Peope didn't select one another.  They just delt with each other.  They did it when they're time was to do it.  I've often thought that intelligence itself may come from some process of 'clearing of the fields.'  As Jacob Bronowski notes, non-human language does not abstract out words from the sentences.  They are all whole with nature. I mean people are socialy bound up for the most part.  For the most part, they don't stop to question it.  I mean how back in pre-industrial era certainly, an agricultural worker didn't have time to sit down and work out whatever mathematical mystery was bothering him(generaly speaking).  This doesn't mean they were stupid; just that (s)he needs to work almost twenty four hours a day.  Must the same for most non-human animals and life.  They're too busy to think.  The thing is that with Homo Australipithicus on, it did happen. Although, each time we'd become dependent on knowledge, we'd still find ourselves consumed by nature - unable to sit down and work on some new mystery.  Usually, the problems eventualy would catch up with us(that is the problems being dependent on a finite understanding represented by that technological existence forces on us), and in the spur of the moment, somebody cooked up some rough solution and away we went again.  One implication of all this is we are the technological and hence knowledge dependent species.I'd like to note connections between all this and logical proof; but, I think I've proved enough(maybe not with symbolic logic; but, well . . . ;), and I thought I'd point out something else.Godel's theorem says that a finite set of consistent axioms cannot prove an infinity of truths.  But, an inconsistent statement can. It just seems to me that supernatural religions do exactly this.  That god(s) are algebraic X's standing for ""I don't know.""  and, ""I don't want to know because that will force me to think(possibly because it would force someone to break social ties).  They say ""god works in mysterious ways"" because sometimes god does things that in the eyes of someone thinking logicaly, god just murdered someone(since he's all powerfull and all knowing and did everything).  So, good or bad, god did it; and if god did bad somehow, he must of had some purpose; god is testing their faith. An old testament example of inconsisten statements would be Exodus 3:14, where god says I am that I am.  A new testament example would be ""9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.""  This is 1Coninthians 9:22.It just seems to me that most people are vagueness gamers.  Instead of reasoning, they fear monger; they play vagueness games, and if that doesn't work, they resort to violence and fear mongering of some kind. Just to give an example . . . recently, my family had their thanksgiving, and my father wanted me to take a shower.  I'm assuming this because he couldn't ask me about taking a shower, He always had to speak indirectly.  He'd say things like there's plenty of hot water, or something else.  He just could not(cannot think rationaly; this is just one recent case I managed to jot down; i see this all the time, but I don't write them down; i forget, and well; i'm just amazed at the psychological nightmare this society is).",3,the real connections,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,10315,"['thought', ""'d"", 'note', 'Day', 'Universe', 'Changed', 'as', 'much', 'James', 'Burke',

1232889,A1SG5LXDO7TPY9,B001RCL5SQ,John Robertson,"[84, 86]","If you're reading this, chances are you already know about James Burke masterworks ofConnections 1and The Day The Universe Changed, and are finally looking to own this magnificent collection on DVD, but I will try to help those not familiar with the series to understand what all the fuss is about.  I will also try to update the review with a description of the product's video and sound quality once I've watched a few episodes, but I know the content well enough to review it now, having watched it on old video tapes twice within the last few years.If you haven't watched TDTUC yet, I envy you.  To see this series for the first time is a treat.  Television production values have changed since this was filmed in the early 1980's, but in case you are not used to watching 26 year old British documentaries, please do not quickly judge this material based on the music, costumes or James' classic green outfit, as some reviews for Connections have done.  This isn't going to be high-def, back-and-forth action, nor does it need to be.  In fact, if you're like most who watch this, it will draw you in slowly.  You will initially think you are learning about science and inventions, but by the closing credits of final episode World's Without End, you will probably have become a somewhat-changed person, learning about history, culture, as well as why things were invented, or often just stumbled upon.  The series defies any existing class or style of documentary -- it is unique.To be sure, both Connections and TDTUC are ""a personal view by James Burke"", but if you want to debate his research and the fascinating, sometimes humorous nature of the stories and demonstrations, you will have to come well prepared.  James' most controversial idea might be technological development has run amok, and that we depend upon it too much, but I see this balanced by the rest of the series' emphasis on what amazing and useful things that inventions have done.  In the end, I don't think he offers a clear answer, as there can be none.I also found it interesting all of the places they were allowed to film -- I doubt a similar documentary crew today would be given the same access to various military or research premises, for example.Though one might think the list price of $150 USD (current Amazon list is $135) is expensive, I don't think you can value this set as you might with most movies.  You will almost certainly want -- perhaps need -- to watch it a couple of times as it is one of those series where you won't catch it all on the first pass.  And as indicated in many reviews, it is highly educational, but also highly entertaining.  I am not purchasing a lot of DVD's today, anticipating the upcoming dominance of BluRay format movies and documentaries, but I am not waiting to own this on DVD.UPDATE:  Video quality and sound are very good, and seemed to have been mastered from broadcast tape.  Episode 1's opening has the slight bit of video noise, and the rising sun seems slightly blurry, but seconds later as the program gets going, the video is sharp.  I've always been able to see a slight difference between DVD's 450 lines of resolution, and super-VHS 420 lines in other recorded media, and I'd estimate the quality of TDTUC to be the latter.  If that worries some, believe me it's far better than any VHS copy you would have.  Sound is also very clear.  In some of the vignettes, I can now understand for the first time some of the mumbling or quiet talking as the characters interact behind James' voice.  Absolutely worth the money, which as of this update, just went down to $119 per copy.There are no extras, and perhaps not surprisingly, no subtitles or really any other kind of DVD features you'd expect to see with movies.  The publisher Ambrose DVD seems to have obtained the rights from BBC to make these DVD's, and I am guessing they did not have the budget for extras??  Still, a nice intro from James would have been appreciated.  But I cannot lower the product's score because of any of this.  5/5 stars.",5,Finally on DVD,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,4041,"[""'re"", 'reading', 'chances', 'are', 'already', 'know', 'James', 'Burke', 'ofConnections', '1and', 'Day', 'Universe', 'Changed', 'are', 'finally', 'looking', 'own', 'magnificent', 'collection', 'DVD', 'will', 'try', 'help', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', 'understand', 'what', 'fuss', 'will', 'also', 'try', 'update', 'review', 'description', 'product', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'once', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'few', 'episodes', 'know', 'content', 'well', 'enough', 'review', 'now', 'having', 'watched', 'old', 'video', 'tapes', 'twice', 'last', 'few', 'years.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'TDTUC', 'yet', 'envy', 'see', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'treat', 'Television', 'production', 'values', 'have', 'changed', 'was', 'filmed', 'early', '1980', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'watching', '26', 'year', 'old', 'British', 'documentaries', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'quickly', 'judge', 'material', 'based', 'music', 'costumes', 'James', 'classic', 'green', 'outfit', 'reviews', 'Connections', 'have', 'done', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'high-def', 'back-and-forth', 'action', 'need', 'be', 'fact', ""'re"", 'most', 'who', 'watch', 'will', 'draw', 'slowly', 'will', 'initially', 'think', 'are', 'learning', 'science', 'inventions', 'closing', 'credits', 'final', 'episode', 'World', 'Without', 'End', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'become', 'somewhat-changed', 'person', 'learning', 'history', 'culture', 'as', 'well', 'why', 'things', 'were', 'invented', 'often', 'just', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'series', 'existing', 'class', 'style', 'documentary', 'unique.To', 'be', 'sure', 'Connections', 'TDTUC', 'are', 'personal', 'view', 'James', 'Burke', 'want', 'debate', 'research', 'fascinating', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'nature', 'stories', 'demonstrations', 'will', 'have', 'come', 'well', 'prepared', 'James', 'most', 'controversial', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'technological', 'development', 'run', 'amok', 'depend', 'too', 'much', 'see', 'balanced', 'rest', 'series', 'emphasis', 'what', 'amazing', 'useful', 'things', 'inventions', 'have', 'done', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'clear', 'answer', 'can', 'be', 'none.I', 'also', 'found', 'interesting', 'places', 'were', 'allowed', 'film', 'doubt', 'similar', 'documentary', 'crew', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'same', 'access', 'various', 'military', 'research', 'premises', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'list', 'price', '150', 'USD', 'current', 'Amazon', 'list', '135', 'expensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'value', 'set', 'might', 'most', 'movies', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'want', 'perhaps', 'need', 'watch', 'couple', 'times', 'one', 'series', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'catch', 'first', 'pass', 'indicated', 'many', 'reviews', 'highly', 'educational', 'also', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'am', 'not', 'purchasing', 'lot', 'DVD', 'today', 'anticipating', 'upcoming', 'dominance', 'BluRay', 'format', 'movies', 'documentaries', 'am', 'not', 'waiting', 'own', 'DVD.UPDATE', 'Video', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'mastered', 'broadcast', 'tape', 'Episode', '1', 'opening', 'slight', 'bit', 'video', 'noise', 'rising', 'sun', 'slightly', 'blurry', 'later', 'program', 'going', 'video', 'sharp', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'slight', 'difference', 'DVD', '450', 'lines', 'resolution', 'super-VHS', '420', 'lines', 'other', 'recorded', 'media', ""'d"", 'estimate', 'quality', 'TDTUC', 'be', 'latter', 'believe', 'far', 'better', 'VHS', 'copy', 'would', 'have', 'Sound', 'also', 'very', 'clear', 'vignettes', 'can', 'now', 'understand', 'first', 'time', 'mumbling', 'quiet', 'talking', 'characters', 'interact', 'James', 'voice', 'Absolutely', 'money', 'update', 'just', 'went', 'down', '119', 'copy.There', 'are', 'extras', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'subtitles', 'really', 'other', 'kind', 'DVD', 'features', ""'d"", 'expect', 'see', 'movies', 'publisher', 'Ambrose', 'DVD', 'have', 'obtained', 'rights', 'BBC', 'make', 'DVD', 'am', 'guessing', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'extras', 'Still', 'nice', 'intro', 'James', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'can', 'not', 'lower', 'product', 'score', '5/5', 'stars']",N/A

1232892,A2H4SX356GPXHS,B001RCL5SQ,Phil Wernig,"[18, 18]","James Burke is a fellow you would love to have at your dinner party. Affable, articulate, avuncular, with his friendly nimbus of windblown hair crowning a broad forehead with dark thick eyebrows behind heavy framed glasses, his impeccable Oxford diction coddling every phrase with dry wit and charming colloquialisms, he is the perfect paragon of the beloved college professor. You and your guests would never be bored because he can talk agreeably about, well... everything.Art, architecture, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, math, medicine, languages, philosophy, social movements, political history - you name it. Other than in your living room or in a classroom, there is no better place for James Burke than on television.From its earliest days, psychologists have been skeptical of television's suitability for education because the medium plays to a passive audience and is not designed for the mind's active participation. This view is valid as far as it goes but may slight the power of drama to edify, of well-executed productions to transport and the appeal of charismatic individuals to engage the imagination.Burke enjoyed a long association with the British Broadcasting Corporation, commencing in 1966, both behind and in front of the camera. In July 1969 he covered the Apollo 11 moon landing for the BBC. From 1996 to 2001 he wrote a regular final page column for ""Scientific American"" magazine. His discourses maintained a chatty air, constructed with a satisfying circularity, beginning  with a fascinating scientific observation, retreating to a salient historical moment, retracing steps and knitting up stitches until returning to his original point. He followed this general outline in four popular science and technology programs for the BBC and PBS networks.In 1978, ""Connections"", Burke's series about discovery and inventions, aired in 10 half hour episodes. The 20 segments of ""Connections 2"" appeared in 1994, with 10 more parts arriving as ""Connections 3"" in 1997.In 1985, ""The Day The Universe Changed"" followed a more leisurely pace, highlighting the social and philosophical ideas that influenced science history in 10 one-hour episodes. Its central premise is that we are ""what we know"" and that our definition of ""knowledge"" and our means of ascertaining it arise from cultural frameworks that change over time. The series features:1. ""The Way We Are"" The birth of rationalism. Thales of Miletus and the Ionian Greeks begin to see nature as impersonal and explainable in its own terms rather than as a product of supernatural agencies.2. ""In the Light of the Above"" The fall of Toledo to 11th century Spanish crusaders yields vast accumulations of ancient learning previously lost to European culture that had been preserved by the Islamic civilization. After a century and a half of translation efforts, medieval scholars gain enough knowledge to found universities and launch the Renaissance.3. ""Point of View"" The recovery of the principles of perspective drawing initiates new approaches in art and architecture. Grid lines applied to cartography enable maritime exploration of the African coastline and the discovery of the New World.4. ""A Matter of Fact"" Gutenberg's invention of the moveable type printing press banishes human memory as the repository of wisdom, engenders the spread of literacy, empowers free communication of ideas, transforms the meaning of factual information, and undermines the authority of the Church.5. ""Infinitely Reasonable"" Copernicus overturns Aristotle's celestial notions that had dominated scholastic thought for nearly 1900 years by locating the sun at the center of the universe. Kepler and Galileo confirm the Copernican worldview through observation and experiment. Newton's ""Principia Mathematica"" demonstrates in precise mathematical language the laws of motion and gravitation that explain the mechanics of the observable universe.6. ""Credit Where It's Due"" Great Britain adopts the Dutch banking and credit system that provides the capital to build canals, harness steam power, spur technological invention, expand factory production, distribute goods to broader markets, transfer labor from farms to cities, and create the Industrial Revolution.7. ""What the Doctor Ordered"" The work of surgeons and the survival rate of their patients is improved by the invention of anesthesia and the discovery that deadly sepsis is caused by microorganisms that can be destroyed during medical procedures and controlled during recuperation. Chronic outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and plague are traced to their sources in contaminated water and city planners learn to separate sewage from water intended for consumption.8. ""Fit To Rule"" Advances in zoology and comparative anatomy applied to collections of fossils lead to recognition that past species have become extinct. The new science of geology proves that the Earth is far more ancient than anyone knew. Wallace and Darwin propose theories of evolution to explain the diversity and inter-relationships of species. Darwin's ideas are appropriated by social theorists to rationalize utopian ideals.9. ""Making Waves"" Electromagnetic phenomena, the wave theory of light, and the discovery of sub-atomic particles force a reevaluation of Newtonian classical physics. Einstein's ideas on gravity and relativity, along with the application of probability theory to quantum mechanics, lead present day physicists to increasingly complex models of the fabric of nature.10. ""Worlds Without End"" What is reality? Different societies coexisting in the modern world apprehend different structures of reality. Is there anything objective and ultimate that human beings can universally accept?With impressive geographic scope, ""The Day The Universe Changed"" was filmed in the locations where the events occurred that precipitated conceptual departures, often depicted in realistic mini-dramas with period costumes and authentic props. It is James Burke himself, however, who stands front and center, narrator, guide, exhibitor, storyteller, and wit. We are ""what we know"". ""The Day The Universe Changed"" is James Burke.",5,Bringing Home The Burkean,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,6136,"['James', 'Burke', 'fellow', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'dinner', 'party', 'Affable',

He has a most pleasing manner about him that encourages you to listen and think. Think about what he says yes but, more importantly, think about what HE thinks.His theme is abundantly sensible. 'Knowledge' is only what we think TODAY. Most often this 'knowledge' is totally different - even diametrically opposed to -the  'knowledge' of yesterday and, it must be said, very likely totally different from the 'knowledge' of tomorrow!In spite of 'knowledge' being thought of very often as the genius of  one person, 'Knowledge' is shown by Burke to be a compilation of many people's important input.If you are not almost spellbound by the many revelations in Burke's commentary, I suspect you are a dull and unthinking person. Burke's views, of course, are purely personal. After viewing this most excellent series I doubt many of us are not wiser and more aware of how the 'western world' has evolved - and WHY!I would venture to state that every intelligent child should be presented with this series  of DDV's as soon as they are able to appreciate the language.
