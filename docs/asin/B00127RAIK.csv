1135592,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00127RAIK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Like a number of the ""8 Films to Die For,"" this entry in the original 2007 series leaves something to be desired.  I got excited when I saw that Charlie Murphy landed a role in the film, but, unfortunately, Unearthed leaves him little room to be funny.  Yes, I know this is a horror movie, but I've found that a little dark humor can sometimes make this kind of clich&eacute;d, formulaic B-movie a little less painful to watch.  The only laughs you might get out of Unearthed come at the expense of the CGI monster, and those aren't the kind of laughs you want in a horror movie.  The CGI isn't all bad overall, as some of the close-up shots of the monster (apparently a blood relative of the monster in Alien) play out pretty effectively, but the long-range views, especially those showing the monster in motion, pretty much scream the word fake.  While I'm criticizing this brainchild of writer/director Matthew Leutwyler, I also have to point to a number of unanswered questions, inadequately developed subplots, significant leaps in logic, and plenty of self-produced fodder for the likes of a Mystery Science Theater 3000.  One of my favorite moments comes during the lead-in to the film's final act, when a character who was previously at a loss to explain what was going on suddenly lays out the entire story for us in great detail.The last thing Sheriff Annie Flynn (Emmanuelle Vaugier) needs is the unleashing of some ancient alien killing machine on four legs into her relatively quiet desert community.  She's already haunted by a tragic accident that will surely cost her her job when the townsfolk have their say at a town meeting scheduled for next week; she's well on her way to becoming a bona fide alcoholic; and she has never gotten the respect she deserves just because she's a female - and rather an attractive one, at that.  She is also very young, which made it hard for this viewer to really accept her as a full-blown sheriff (if we extrapolate using Vaugier's age, she would have become sheriff at the tender age of twenty-seven).  Getting back to the monster, he is basically an old Indian legend unearthed and brought back into the world by a rogue Indian archaeologist (they thought he was mad at the university) who wanted to prove that his people were indeed all but decimated centuries ago by a monstrous creature.  I think we can all agree that he definitely proved his point.Alongside the sheriff, our list of would-be survivors includes two blondes and a hitchhiker they picked up along the way to California, a businessman (Charlie Murphy) who - like the other strangers - is stranded there because the gas truck that was supposed to replenish the tanks crashed several miles down the road (and the next town in this desert landscape is well over a hundred miles away); a young botanist who came back home to help take care of her Native American grandfather, and - of course - the idiot who unearthed the monster in the first place.  They spend most of the movie fleeing from one place to another in diminishing numbers as the monster takes them out one by one.  By the time they finally come up with an appropriately cockamamie way to stop the thing, you start to wonder if anyone is going to be left to actually execute the plan.  Don't worry too much, though, because you probably won't care a lot about any of the characters (although I must admit I was seriously rooting for Charlie Murphy to survive).I guess the film gets a little gory in places, but it's certainly not enough to land Unearthed on any gorehound's list of must-sees.  In fact, there's really nothing special about this film at all, which is why I'm giving it three stars - a rating which is probably a little generous on my part given all of the film's plot holes and logical leaps.  Unearthed won't bore you to tears, but it's not really going to get your heart pumping, either.",3,"Pretty much just your typical, clich&eacute;d monster B-movie",1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,3888,"['number', '8', 'Films', 'Die', 'entry', 'original', '2007', 'series', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'got', 'excited', 'when', 'saw', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'landed', 'role', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'Unearthed', 'little', 'room', 'be', 'funny', 'Yes', 'know', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'found', 'little', 'dark', 'humor', 'can', 'sometimes', 'make', 'kind', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'formulaic', 'B-movie', 'little', 'less', 'painful', 'watch', 'only', 'might', 'get', 'Unearthed', 'come', 'expense', 'CGI', 'monster', 'are', ""n't"", 'kind', 'laughs', 'want', 'horror', 'movie', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'bad', 'overall', 'close-up', 'shots', 'monster', 'apparently', 'blood', 'relative', 'monster', 'Alien', 'play', 'out', 'pretty', 'effectively', 'long-range', 'views', 'especially', 'showing', 'monster', 'motion', 'pretty', 'much', 'scream', 'word', 'fake', ""'m"", 'criticizing', 'brainchild', 'writer/director', 'Matthew', 'Leutwyler', 'also', 'have', 'point', 'number', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'inadequately', 'developed', 'subplots', 'significant', 'leaps', 'logic', 'plenty', 'self-produced', 'fodder', 'likes', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'lead-in', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'previously', 'loss', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'suddenly', 'out', 'entire', 'story', 'great', 'detail.The', 'last', 'thing', 'Sheriff', 'Annie', 'Flynn', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'unleashing', 'ancient', 'alien', 'killing', 'machine', 'four', 'legs', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'desert', 'community', 'already', 'haunted', 'tragic', 'accident', 'will', 'surely', 'cost', 'job', 'when', 'townsfolk', 'have', 'say', 'town', 'meeting', 'scheduled', 'next', 'week', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'bona', 'fide', 'alcoholic', 'never', 'gotten', 'respect', 'just', 'female', 'rather', 'attractive', 'one', 'also', 'very', 'young', 'made', 'hard', 'viewer', 'really', 'accept', 'full-blown', 'sheriff', 'extrapolate', 'using', 'Vaugier', 'age', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'sheriff', 'tender', 'age', 'twenty-seven', 'Getting', 'back', 'monster', 'basically', 'old', 'Indian', 'legend', 'unearthed', 'brought', 'back', 'world', 'rogue', 'Indian', 'archaeologist', 'thought', 'was', 'mad', 'university', 'who', 'wanted', 'prove', 'people', 'were', 'indeed', 'decimated', 'centuries', 'ago', 'monstrous', 'creature', 'think', 'can', 'agree', 'definitely', 'proved', 'point.Alongside', 'sheriff', 'list', 'would-be', 'survivors', 'two', 'blondes', 'hitchhiker', 'picked', 'up', 'way', 'California', 'businessman', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'other', 'strangers', 'stranded', 'there', 'gas', 'truck', 'was', 'supposed', 'replenish', 'tanks', 'crashed', 'several', 'miles', 'down', 'road', 'next', 'town', 'desert', 'landscape', 'well', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'young', 'botanist', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'home', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'Native', 'American', 'grandfather', 'course', 'idiot', 'who', 'unearthed', 'monster', 'first', 'place', 'spend', 'most', 'movie', 'fleeing', 'one', 'place', 'diminishing', 'numbers', 'monster', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'time', 'finally', 'come', 'up', 'appropriately', 'cockamamie', 'way', 'stop', 'thing', 'start', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'going', 'be', 'left', 'actually', 'execute', 'plan', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'though', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'lot', 'characters', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'seriously', 'rooting', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'survive', '.I', 'guess', 'film', 'little', 'gory', 'places', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'land', 'Unearthed', 'gorehound', 'list', 'must-sees', 'fact', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'film', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'rating', 'probably', 'little', 'generous', 'part', 'given', 'film', 'plot', 'holes', 'logical', 'leaps', 'Unearthed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'tears', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping']",Unearthed

1135597,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00127RAIK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","""Unearthed,"" the second of the 8 Films 2 Die 4 from Horrorfest 2007 I am checking out on DVD, is a dormant monster brought to live to kill (almost) everybody in the movie type of movie.  The setting is a desolate New Mexico town, so isolated that an oil tanker can turn over and block what is apparently the only road out of town.  Equally important to the plot, the oil tanker was coming to deliver gasoline to the place run by Grandpa (Russell Means), which means the bad news for the people who show up in the first part of the movie is that there is no gasoline for them to get out of town.  The good news is that all of the women in this small town in New Mexico are big time babes.  But then there is the really bad news that a monster has been, well, unearthed.Our heroine is Sheriff Annie Flynn (Emmanuelle Vaugier of ""Saw II), who has an incident in her past that everybody is always making veiled references to; in fact, when Grandpa does not bring up the incident, Annie does herself, before going back to drinking to forget what everybody keeps alluding to.  It gets to the point where you expect the strangers who show up to be fodder for the creature to all know about this incident as well.  By the time the deep dark secret (that everybody knows about) is revealed, I was totally apathetic.  Caya (Beau Garrett of ""Turistas""), Ally (Whitney Able), and Nodine (Tonantzin Carmelo), are other babes on the menu, whith Nodine being the important one since she is not only Grandpa's granddaughter, but also a botanist.  Yes, it is strange that a botanist would be of big help in explaining the monster in a monster movie, but that is part of what attempts to make this monster different.I noted that once people started dying that there was not a whole lot of discussion about what was happening, although I suppose it does make sense to a certain extent not to engage in conversation while fleeing.  But then we get to a scene where there is an explosion of exposition (who knew that pictographs could be so detailed?).  The most interesting character int he story is Kale (Luke Goss), a tattooed archeologist who is sort of Mulder and Scully wrapped into one as he is out there digging alone to prove his Anaszi ancestors were wiped out by something more personal than drought.  Most of his dialogue comes in the exposition scene, and you are never sure if he is crazier than he is smart or the other way around.  But you know full well that the last man standing in this horror movie is going to be a woman, so you take his presence with a  grain of blood-soaked salt.I was stunned that ""Unearthed"" was made by writer-director Matthew Leutwyler because I had absolutely loved his previous film, ""Dead and Breakfast,"" which I thought should have been the next great midnight movie in the ""Rocky Horror"" tradition.  Of course I realize that you cannot make a career out of zombie musicals and it is not like Leutwyler should not be trying to make serious horror films (remember, Steven Spielberg's first World War II movie was neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Schindler's List,"" for which he won Oscars as Best Director, but the raucous comedy ""1941"").  But there is nothing memorable about this film, which like way too many films these days suffers from the overuse the hand held camera.  Beyond that, ""Unearthed"" comes across as a film cobbled together from bits and pieces of other films.  I was thinking that you could take the end of ""Duel,"" most of ""Feast,"" and some moments from ""Alien,"" and edit together a better movie than this one.  Across the board ""Unearthed"" comes up with too little in the blood, gore, suspense, shock, and any other department you want to mention from the horror film checklist.  The net result is a horror film that avoids being offensive, but has nothing to particularly recommend it to fans of the genre.The only bonus feature on the DVD are the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which are included on all of the DVDs in this round of the After Dark Horrorfest (good to know that a scream queen can actually scream).  The absence of any extras besides the standard choice between English and Spanish subtitles squelched any second thoughts about rounding up instead of down on this one.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Unearthed, another disappointment from the second round of the After Dark Horror Fest, is a pure creature feature with piles of blood and gore thrown on for good measure.  Too bad that Unearthed is a dim-witted and cliched ride for the most part that borrows way too heavily from other (and better) films of the genre.  Emmanuelle Vaugier (Saw II, CSI: NY) stars as an alcoholic sheriff who, along with a handful of others, runs afoul of a bloodthirsty beast that looks like a cross between the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise and the monsters from Feast.  And while Unearthed is derivative as can be, it does manage to be a little bit enjoyable, and the gore effects are very nicely done.  However, Unearthed ends up going down the predictable route as the film moves forward, and the cast (including Hellboy II's Luke Goss, Charlie Murphy, and MC Gainey) don't do themselves any favors either.

The creature itself looks a lot like Alien, actually it's entire head is almost the exact replica.  I'm sure if HR Giger knew there would be a lawsuit pending.The plot revolves around this ""creature"" terrorizing a small village and primarily a plant scientist and her father.  A dig has unearthed this title creature and it is now lose.  We are told in the film that it's over 900 years old and it's up to our crack crew of ""heros"" including a drunk female sheriff, the scientist, the indian father and some passerbys that can't leave the area due to a truck blocking the highway, one of the earlier kills of the creature.Generally that's it.  I can't highly recommend this unless you just want to kill about 90 mins of your time and you have nothing else to do.

1135604,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00127RAIK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Unearthed (Matthew Leutwyler, 2007)There was a time when I would have said that the great Russell Means lent a little class to every movie in which he appears. That time, unfortunately, has now passed forever with Unearthed, the latest outing for Dead and Breakfast director Matthew Leutwyler. Now, this is not Russell Means' fault by any stretch of the imagination, but it's depressing to see that he's no longer batting a thousand.Plot: Annie Flynn (Emanuelle Vaugier), an alcoholic sheriff in a small southwestern town, is going to be forced out in a week after the town holds a no-confidence election. She's managed to hang onto her job for a year after the incident that caused the town to lose faith in her (and her to lose faith in herself), but everyone's lost patience. So, needless to say, something earth-shattering has to happen in that last week to give herback her confidence and let the town see her as a savior. Of course, that is, if anyone's left in the town by the time the mysterious, seemingly supernatural killer (this isn't a spoiler, we see what's happening in the opening scene; the only suspense there is what it is) is through eating its way through them.As is usually the case with films picked up by the guys who run the After Dark Horrorfest, this wasn't actually a movie that was too scary for theaters; it's a movie that was so mediocre, even by the standards of the crap Hollywood's been churning out and calling ""horror"" for the past decade or so, that no studio would pick it up for distribution. Unearthed stands apart from the usual Horrorfest fare in that there's actually some starpower to be found here; former model Vaugier has recently been taking a turn on TV's CSI:NY, while male lead Luke Goss should be familiar from Blade II. But it's the supporting cast who'll really wow you--aside from the great Means, you've also got M. C. Gainey, Beau Garrett, Whitney Able, and other folks who, if their names don't look familiar, their faces will. Shouldn't surprise you, then, that the acting is above average for a Horrorfest outing. Problem is, the acting isn't enough to carry the ridiculous script, which combines the worst parts of seven or eight Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies without taking any of the good from them. (See how much this movie has addled my brain? I'm conceding there may be something good in Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies.) Given a few original twists, or Leutwyler allowing someone better to write the script, this might have been a good movie. Of course, had that happened, it wouldn't have been a Horrorfest movie. Sometimes, you really can judge a movie by its cover (and its distribution company). *",1,Unearthed = Unscary.,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,2668,"['Unearthed', 'Matthew', 'Leutwyler', '2007', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'great', 'Russell', 'Means', 'lent', 'little', 'class', 'movie', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'now', 'passed', 'forever', 'Unearthed', 'latest', 'outing', 'Dead', 'Breakfast', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Leutwyler', 'Now', 'not', 'Russell', 'Means', 'fault', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'depressing', 'see', 'no', 'longer', 'batting', 'thousand.Plot', 'Annie', 'Flynn', 'Emanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'alcoholic', 'sheriff', 'small', 'southwestern', 'town', 'going', 'be', 'forced', 'out', 'week', 'town', 'no-confidence', 'election', 'managed', 'hang', 'job', 'year', 'incident', 'caused', 'town', 'lose', 'faith', 'lose', 'faith', 'herself', 'everyone', 'lost', 'patience', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'something', 'earth-shattering', 'happen', 'last', 'week', 'give', 'herback', 'confidence', 'let', 'town', 'see', 'savior', 'course', 'anyone', 'left', 'town', 'time', 'mysterious', 'seemingly', 'supernatural', 'killer', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'see', 'what', 'happening', 'opening', 'scene', 'only', 'suspense', 'what', 'eating', 'way', 'them.As', 'usually', 'case', 'films', 'picked', 'up', 'guys', 'who', 'run', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'scary', 'theaters', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'mediocre', 'even', 'standards', 'crap', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'churning', 'out', 'calling', 'horror', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'studio', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'distribution', 'Unearthed', 'stands', 'apart', 'usual', 'Horrorfest', 'fare', 'actually', 'starpower', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'former', 'model', 'Vaugier', 'recently', 'been', 'taking', 'turn', 'TV', 'CSI', 'NY', 'male', 'lead', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'Blade', 'II', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', ""'ll"", 'really', 'wow', 'aside', 'great', 'Means', ""'ve"", 'also', 'got', 'M.', 'C.', 'Gainey', 'Beau', 'Garrett', 'Whitney', 'Able', 'other', 'folks', 'who', 'names', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'familiar', 'will', 'Should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'then', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'Horrorfest', 'outing', 'Problem', 'acting', ""n't"", 'enough', 'carry', 'ridiculous', 'script', 'worst', 'parts', 'seven', 'eight', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movies', 'taking', 'good', 'See', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'addled', 'brain', ""'m"", 'conceding', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'good', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Movies', 'few', 'original', 'twists', 'Leutwyler', 'allowing', 'someone', 'better', 'write', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'course', 'had', 'happened', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Horrorfest', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'really', 'can', 'judge', 'movie', 'cover', 'distribution', 'company', '*']",Unearthed

1135607,A1F6Q5Q0U6MS5X,B00127RAIK,Tim F. Martin,"[0, 0]","I saw _Unearthed_ on the Sci Fi Channel recently as one of its Sci Fi movies of the week (usually every Saturday night and sometimes on Sunday night). Though in years past they had been unwatchable and awful I think the last two years they had considerably improved in terms of casting, acting, writing, production values, and special effects. Heck even the titles have gotten more sophisticated; it used to endlessly amuse my friends and I that it wasn't hard to guess what _Ogre_ or _Basilisk_ was about.The premise of this movie was pretty good. There is a small town in the American Southwest, the site of some mysterious dig in Anasazi ruins, a dig that unearths something awful, something alive. We don't know much about what is uncovered at first but it is terrible and the creature unleashed kills the driver of a tanker trunk of much needed gas for the town's apparently only filling station, destroying the truck and blocking the road. The townsfolk, mostly ranchers, and a few people passing through the area are stranded, at first merely upset at the inconvenience but later worried as something is killing livestock and then people.It is up to the town's sheriff, Annie Flynn, played rather well by the attractive Emmanuelle Vaugier, to investigate. She is apparently something of an alcoholic, not because she is a worthless individual but because she is still dealing with stress and grief from some un-discussed (at first) trauma in her recent past involving a little girl and a hostage situation. Most in the town dislike her, saying openly to her face that they will gladly vote her out of her job at the next town meeting (there are overtones of sexism too). Annie acknowledges this but still says she has a job to do and with her loyal deputy does the best she can to calm the townsfolk and find out what is afoot. She does have a few supporters, including the grandfatherly Native American man who owns the filing station and his visiting botanist daughter who is there ostensibly to help her grandfather but really still doing research (thus explaining the useful lab equipment at the gas station that come to such good use later).The movie becomes basically a story of the scientist trying to understand the creature and find a way to defeat it (its background, while underdeveloped, I have to admit was interesting) while in other scenes Annie tries to keep the townsfolk and travelers alive and kill the monster.The monster special effects were pretty good though the creature could have been shown more often. I think they still have problems making CGI creations really ""live"" in a physical environment with sets and actors, probably part of the reason why these movies tend to gravitate towards flying creatures (look at all the Sci Fi Channel movies of the week involving gargoyles, sphinxes, gryphons, pterosaurs, and dragons). At times it still didn't seem part of the same world but I think they have made great strides in that area.The movie does have its flaws. I thought some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped or even stereotypical, such as the very loyal, over earnest deputy, the hateful, boastful, arrogant, sexist rancher tycoon, and the urbanite African-American traveler. The person doing the dig, the one who uncovered the creature, and his motives was very undeveloped and I thought the weakest thing about the movie. He came off as a bit  crazy with unclear motives, not like any real scientist I have ever heard of.",3,"Good premise, ok execution",1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,3470,"['saw', '_Unearthed_', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'recently', 'one', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'movies', 'week', 'usually', 'Saturday', 'night', 'sometimes', 'Sunday', 'night', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'unwatchable', 'awful', 'think', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'had', 'considerably', 'improved', 'terms', 'casting', 'acting', 'writing', 'production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', 'Heck', 'even', 'titles', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'used', 'endlessly', 'amuse', 'friends', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'guess', 'what', '_Ogre_', '_Basilisk_', 'was', 'about.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'Southwest', 'site', 'mysterious', 'dig', 'Anasazi', 'ruins', 'dig', 'unearths', 'something', 'awful', 'something', 'alive', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'what', 'uncovered', 'first', 'terrible', 'creature', 'unleashed', 'driver', 'tanker', 'trunk', 'much', 'needed', 'gas', 'town', 'apparently', 'only', 'filling', 'station', 'destroying', 'truck', 'blocking', 'road', 'townsfolk', 'mostly', 'ranchers', 'few', 'people', 'passing', 'area', 'are', 'stranded', 'first', 'merely', 'upset', 'inconvenience', 'later', 'worried', 'something', 'killing', 'livestock', 'then', 'people.It', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Annie', 'Flynn', 'played', 'rather', 'well', 'attractive', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'investigate', 'apparently', 'something', 'alcoholic', 'not', 'worthless', 'individual', 'still', 'dealing', 'stress', 'grief', 'un-discussed', 'first', 'trauma', 'recent', 'past', 'involving', 'little', 'girl', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Most', 'town', 'saying', 'openly', 'face', 'will', 'gladly', 'vote', 'job', 'next', 'town', 'meeting', 'are', 'overtones', 'sexism', 'too', 'Annie', 'still', 'job', 'do', 'loyal', 'deputy', 'best', 'can', 'calm', 'townsfolk', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'afoot', 'have', 'few', 'supporters', 'including', 'grandfatherly', 'Native', 'American', 'man', 'who', 'filing', 'station', 'visiting', 'botanist', 'daughter', 'who', 'there', 'ostensibly', 'help', 'grandfather', 'really', 'still', 'doing', 'research', 'thus', 'explaining', 'useful', 'lab', 'equipment', 'gas', 'station', 'come', 'such', 'good', 'use', 'later', '.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'story', 'scientist', 'trying', 'understand', 'creature', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'background', 'underdeveloped', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'interesting', 'other', 'scenes', 'Annie', 'tries', 'keep', 'townsfolk', 'travelers', 'alive', 'kill', 'monster.The', 'monster', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'creature', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'more', 'often', 'think', 'still', 'have', 'problems', 'making', 'CGI', 'creations', 'really', 'live', 'physical', 'environment', 'sets', 'actors', 'probably', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'movies', 'tend', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'flying', 'creatures', 'look', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'movies', 'week', 'involving', 'gargoyles', 'sphinxes', 'gryphons', 'pterosaurs', 'dragons', 'times', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'part', 'same', 'world', 'think', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'strides', 'area.The', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', 'even', 'stereotypical', 'such', 'very', 'loyal', 'earnest', 'deputy', 'hateful', 'boastful', 'arrogant', 'sexist', 'rancher', 'tycoon', 'urbanite', 'African-American', 'traveler', 'person', 'doing', 'dig', 'one', 'who', 'uncovered', 'creature', 'motives', 'was', 'very', 'undeveloped', 'thought', 'weakest', 'thing', 'movie', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'crazy', 'unclear', 'motives', 'not', 'real', 'scientist', 'have', 'ever', 'heard']",Unearthed

An archaeological dig in a remote New Mexico town releases a creature that's been trapped for 900 years and it soon begins preying on the town's residents and the only road out of town has been blocked by a fuel tanker accident.  Hmm, small desert town, residents trapped, a creature feasting on them...yeah, seen it before.  It was called Tremors and it was vastly superior.The town's regular residents include alcoholic sheriff Annie Flynn (Vaugier), Rancher Rob Horn (Gainey) Scientist Nodin and her grandfather (Means).  A few passing motorists also find themselves trapped in the little town, all there to buy gas from the service station run by Grandpa.  As Nodin tries to analyze the creature's alien DNA and find a means to kill it, Sheriff Flynn attempts to keep the rest of the survivors alive and one step ahead of the beast.  I'd love to tell you what the creature looks like but that's somewhat difficult.  We get only fleeting glimpses of the thing as it dashes by the camera.  On top of that, much of the film takes place at night with those green glow sticks as the only source of illumination.  It sort of looks like the Xenophobes from ""Aliens"" but done in poor CGI.  Director Leutwyler borrows liberally from numerous other films including Descent, Relic, and Reeker.  In fact you'd be hard pressed to find one original idea in the entire film.Nodin eventually figures out some sort of voodoo scientific solution about the characters DNA and making a poison from uranium but by that time, I was nodding off and only wanted the film to come to a merciful end.  Vaugier usually is able to give a bit of a spark to some of the low-budget films she's been in but seems completely bored here.  I didn't buy her role as a guilt-stricken, alcoholic sheriff at all.  Frankly she looked just too good.  Gainey is a great character actor but he seemed out of place.Leutwyler also loves doing that thing with the camera where he has it shake and bounce during some of the monster's attack scenes, presumably to make it seem more real and get the feel for the attack.  It's a novelty trick that doesn't work and this, along with the choppy editing, only serves to annoy the viewer and make the creature even harder to see.With three down and only one more for me to review, my hopes are fading fast for finding one good film in this year's group of Horrorfest releases.

She and the local 'misunderstood guy' figure out how to return it to that state...ok, how did they arrive at this conclusion?  There were just way to many holes for this movie.  If you want to make a simple creature feature that focuses on the gore, leave out the backstory and do that, this movie tried to be a bit more and failed.The town sheriff, played with aplomb by Emmanuelle Vaugier, struggles to answer the very same questions we as the viewers have.  Usually, Vaugier is a capable actress, not afraid to get her hands dirty and not simply rely on her beauty, and she tries here, but she is given little to do.  The rest of the players are forgettable.IF you are looking at Horrorfest movies try The Deaths of Ian Stone, a much better film.",2,Weak Retread of Alien/Predator *SPOILERS*,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,1149,"['Many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Aliens', 'marks', 'Predator', 'well', 'creature', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'backstory', 'been', 'awakened', 'centuries', 'think', 'number', '6000', 'was', 'bandied', 'old', 'slumber', 'hungry', 'learn', 'creature', 'alien', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'God', 'ok', 'why', 'young', 'lady', 'how', 'creature', 'was', 'put', 'sort', 'suspended', 'animation..ok', 'how', 'local', ""'misunderstood"", 'guy', 'figure', 'how', 'return', 'state', 'ok', 'how', 'did', 'arrive', 'conclusion', 'were', 'just', 'way', 'many', 'holes', 'movie', 'want', 'make', 'simple', 'creature', 'feature', 'gore', 'leave', 'out', 'backstory', 'do', 'movie', 'tried', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'failed.The', 'town', 'sheriff', 'played', 'aplomb', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'answer', 'very', 'same', 'questions', 'viewers', 'have', 'Usually', 'Vaugier', 'capable', 'actress', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'not', 'simply', 'rely', 'beauty', 'here', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'rest', 'players', 'are', 'forgettable.IF', 'are', 'looking', 'Horrorfest', 'movies', 'try', 'Deaths', 'Ian', 'Stone', 'much', 'better', 'film']",Unearthed
