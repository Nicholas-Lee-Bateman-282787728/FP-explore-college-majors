1299228,A1JN63QBBNGB78,B002YKFLBM,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]","Hallmark continues its fine tradition of delivering outstanding quality movies.  This one is no exception.  After seeing the advertisement trailers on TV, my family anxiously awaited its showing.  The wait was justified.  Don't think there was a dry eye in the house in some parts of the movie and we weren't subjected to what appears as fast becoming the norm for the majority of movies made these days i.e., foul language, the ""F"" word being about every other word spoken, over the top amount of T&A and/or sexually oriented scenes being consistently shown.  (I'm no prude but do wonder if morality en total isn't, unfortunately, becoming a thing of the past).  What this movies does provide is both realistic and believable family situations as well as animal/human interaction, superb acting and another bit of proof that animals are in fact human's best friends in that they give so much love, comfort, companionship and loyalty and ask for so little in return.  How anyone can abuse any animal is beyond my comprehension. Hallmark, whose life long motto has always been ""When you care enough to send the very best"" demonstrated their caring by stepping up to the plate and publicly endorsing support of and encouragement in adoption of pets from local shelters (rather than spending huge amounts to buy a pet who may have come from a questionable source.  One prime example is puppies that come from one of the horrible ""puppy mills"" recently showcased on several of the national news programs).  As a family who has a loving, precious yellow lab mix we got as a puppy from our local shelter, we have first hand knowledge about adopting from a shelter.  Huge kudos to Hallmark for supporting this most worthwhile program.  And while others were standing in line to buy high-priced e.g., jewelry, electronics etc., we stood in line to buy this movie the next day after it was shown.  Glad we did.  When we finally made it to the counter we got one of only three copies left.  (Our local Hallmark store is a small one but the owner indicated that he had received 50 copies).  Think the kids have watched it at least three times since we bought it.  Highly recommend this movie.",5,Hallmark Quality Movie Tradition Scores Again!,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,2181,"['Hallmark', 'fine', 'tradition', 'delivering', 'outstanding', 'quality', 'movies', 'one', 'exception', 'seeing', 'advertisement', 'trailers', 'TV', 'family', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'showing', 'wait', 'was', 'justified', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'dry', 'eye', 'house', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'subjected', 'what', 'fast', 'becoming', 'norm', 'majority', 'movies', 'made', 'days', 'i.e.', 'foul', 'language', 'F', 'word', 'being', 'other', 'word', 'spoken', 'top', 'amount', 'T', 'A', 'and/or', 'sexually', 'oriented', 'scenes', 'being', 'consistently', 'shown', ""'m"", 'prude', 'do', 'wonder', 'morality', 'en', 'total', ""n't"", 'unfortunately', 'becoming', 'thing', 'past', 'What', 'movies', 'provide', 'realistic', 'believable', 'family', 'situations', 'as', 'well', 'animal/human', 'interaction', 'superb', 'acting', 'bit', 'proof', 'animals', 'are', 'fact', 'human', 'best', 'friends', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'comfort', 'companionship', 'loyalty', 'ask', 'so', 'little', 'return', 'How', 'anyone', 'can', 'abuse', 'animal', 'comprehension', 'Hallmark', 'life', 'long', 'motto', 'always', 'been', 'When', 'care', 'enough', 'send', 'very', 'best', 'demonstrated', 'caring', 'stepping', 'up', 'plate', 'publicly', 'endorsing', 'support', 'encouragement', 'adoption', 'pets', 'local', 'shelters', 'rather', 'spending', 'huge', 'amounts', 'buy', 'pet', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'questionable', 'source', 'One', 'prime', 'example', 'puppies', 'come', 'one', 'horrible', 'puppy', 'mills', 'recently', 'showcased', 'several', 'national', 'news', 'programs', 'family', 'who', 'loving', 'precious', 'yellow', 'lab', 'mix', 'got', 'puppy', 'local', 'shelter', 'have', 'first', 'hand', 'knowledge', 'adopting', 'shelter', 'Huge', 'kudos', 'Hallmark', 'supporting', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'program', 'others', 'were', 'standing', 'line', 'buy', 'high-priced', 'e.g.', 'jewelry', 'electronics', 'etc.', 'stood', 'line', 'buy', 'movie', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'shown', 'Glad', 'did', 'When', 'finally', 'made', 'counter', 'got', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'copies', 'left', 'local', 'Hallmark', 'store', 'small', 'one', 'owner', 'indicated', 'had', 'received', '50', 'copies', 'Think', 'kids', 'have', 'watched', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'bought', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",A Dog Named Christmas DVD (Hallmark Hall of Fame)

1299234,AOCDM5AZDBDEJ,B002YKFLBM,brian steven ruiz,"[0, 0]","A dog named christmas from hallmark hall of fame is a great movie. It's a holiday movie that takes place in the state of kansas in the summer time. They filmed it when it was 100 degrees and over in july and august. They fluffed out the snow from rain and sleet. What's nice about this movie is you get your full money for when you buy this is worth the purchase. It's a nice movie for everybody including young children, children, kids, teens, and adults. It's suitable for all ages starting at ages 3 to 113 and older. I'll clarify my point of view to finish my sentence. People who are that age can watch the movie. It depends what people like and prefer. I prefer it as a family film for all ages. You can watch it on the hallmark movie channel or you can own it on digital video disc which means dvd. You can even get this movie on vhs. I want to go a little in depth on this movie. Before I do that the  dvd on the front cover itself is a gold crown collector's edition. Hallmark hall of fame  with the cast Bruce greenwood Linda edmond and noel fisher a wish, a gift, and a journey. A dog named christmas is based on the best-selling novel by greg Kincaid. On the dvd digital video disc dvd. Is a 1:85 wide screen film with a duration of ninety 90 minutes long. On vhs of video it is a full screen movie which is rare. On the back it includes the making of &#34;a dog named christmas&#34; conversation about the production cast & credits biographies wide screen version 5.1 Dolby surround Bruce greenwood Linda edmond and noel fisher. A dog named christmas. &#34;This is no place for a dog. They are just a distraction.&#34; George McCray and it so often his friends were amazed to learn that a start had been &#34;invited&#34; to spend the holidays with george, his wife mary Ann and their son Todd on their kansas farm. When todd, a developmentally-challenged twenty 20 year old with an affinity for animals hears the animal shelter is looking for families to foster a dog for the holidays, he's eager to to sign up. But george says &#34;no adoptions&#34; -even temporary ones claiming he wants to protect Todd from disappointment. Mary Ann knows better. Something else is troubling her husband - something he doesn't want to face. With Mary Ann's support, Todd's persistence pays off. He chooses a friendly yellow lab from the shelter and names him &#34;christmas.&#34; Bringing christmas home is a revelation for george. The dog seems to know immediately that this is where he belongs. Watching Todd and christmas together, george sees his son in a new light. And it soon becomes obvious that Christmas has actually &#34;adopted&#34; george, creating a bond that is stronger than past disappointments. A dog named christmas is a joyful movie that is destined to become s holiday tradition. The making of &#34;a dog named christmas&#34; author greg Kincaid will be the first to admit that when he wrote this little christmas story for his children, he never could have imagined the series of events  that would follow. See how the hallmark hall of fame created a snowy kansas farm from a thriving summer landscape in Saskatchewan. I want to tell the amazon.com customers I'm not forcing them to buy anything it's their preference. They can buy whatever they need and want. About the story from my perspective point of view is that about The film Bruce greenwood told the boy no you can't adopt a dog or have a dog because the boy had a health problem in the story. He was forgetting things. The boy had a disorder he was autistic but a very smart young man. He always obeyed his father and he got what he wanted. At the beginning of the story the dog named christmas journeyed west and almost got runner over by a semi truck. The father and the son painted together and they got on the same band wagon together. But the boy liked taking care of many different animals. He was a painter they called the boy Todd. His father didn't even want him to get on the ladder.the father told the boy you can't have a dog unless you clean up your room. He has to do his chores or no dog. His room is messy so he has to behave and clean his room nice clean which is thourghly clean. He has so many animals that if he wants another animal he has to do what his father tells him. His mother even gets on the boy case but it was sad. He had to let Jake the parrot go because he fixes wounded animals then he let's them go. On the radio he heard about a contest about raising all kind of dogs so he went to pick them out. The mother was less lenient but Tha father was very strict with his son but the mother was not to hard on him. The father had his own dog when he was in the service. My favorite part of the film of the story is that christmas the dog liked to play with a ball a lot. He rolled it to the father and son.

This feel-good movie was directed by Peter Werner, with Jenny Wingfield writing the script from the New York Times Best Selling book by author Greg Kincaid. It stars Bruce Greenwood as George McCray, Linda Emond as his wife Mary Ann and Noel Fischer as their developmentally challenged, 20-year old son, Todd.This wonderful story opens with the McCray family who own a farm in Kansas. George and Mary Ann's son, Todd has a way with animals and when he learns of a local animal shelter's 'Adopt a Dog for Christmas' program, he immediately sets out to convince his dad what a great idea it would be to foster a dog for the holidays. George and Todd visit the shelter and find a dog with no name. Todd decides that the dog's name is Christmas . But there are 32 other dogs in the shelter without homes for the holidays and Todd begins his own campaign to insure that they all get placed and loved by a family, for Christmas.While Christmas is with the McCray's, Mary Ann tries to convince George that Todd should be allowed to keep the animal, but personal trauma in George's past causes him to resist the idea.This film was not just a movie about a dog, but a movie about the love of a family, one person's impact on a community and the inner turmoil of a man who is trying to resolve his past.

Not so in this movie.  Here, a father who suffers from his own issues (PTSD, Viet Nam) wants to teach his special needs son how to survive on his own, after he and his wife are no longer living, so commitments are very important to him.The writing was realistic, and the acting...not the usual over-acting saccharin of Hallmark, but down to earth, credible performances, including subtle face expressions and non verbals.The cast was terrific.  The father's pain, along with his joy, was never overdone, and the dog was not deified, which is often the case.  Even small details, such as the special needs boy having outdated headphones lent credibility to the story.This was a beautiful family story that did not distort real families, with real values, struggling with real decisions, but left the audience with the warm sense of family, and the bonds that keep us together.  This was a nice heart tugging movie that did not rely on violence, nudity or vulgarity, yet the skill of the actors was enough to bring us the reality, and the story enough to hold our interest.Kudos to the writer, as much as to the performances, especially the father and the special needs son!  ***** Stars.",5,Intelligent Writing,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,1321,"['anyone', 'who', 'special', 'needs', 'child', 'who', 'worked', 'one', 'Hollywoodization', 'portrayals', 'are', 'always', 'unrealistic', 'Not', 'so', 'movie', 'Here', 'father', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'PTSD', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'teach', 'special', 'needs', 'son', 'how', 'survive', 'own', 'wife', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'living', 'commitments', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'him.The', 'writing', 'was', 'realistic', 'acting', 'not', 'usual', 'over-acting', 'saccharin', 'Hallmark', 'down', 'earth', 'credible', 'performances', 'including', 'subtle', 'face', 'expressions', 'non', 'verbals.The', 'cast', 'was', 'terrific', 'father', 'pain', 'joy', 'was', 'never', 'overdone', 'dog', 'was', 'not', 'deified', 'often', 'case', 'Even', 'small', 'details', 'such', 'special', 'needs', 'boy', 'having', 'outdated', 'headphones', 'lent', 'credibility', 'story.This', 'was', 'beautiful', 'family', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'distort', 'real', 'families', 'real', 'values', 'struggling', 'real', 'decisions', 'left', 'audience', 'warm', 'sense', 'family', 'bonds', 'keep', 'together', 'was', 'nice', 'heart', 'tugging', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'rely', 'violence', 'nudity', 'vulgarity', 'skill', 'actors', 'was', 'enough', 'bring', 'reality', 'story', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest.Kudos', 'writer', 'as', 'much', 'performances', 'especially', 'father', 'special', 'needs', 'son', '*****', 'Stars']",A Dog Named Christmas DVD (Hallmark Hall of Fame)
