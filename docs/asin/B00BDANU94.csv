1625889,A2W1FEPSD6EOCI,B00BDANU94,cinephile,"[1, 2]","I heard about this film and looked it up. The premise seemed fascinating and the first thing that came to mind is ""I must watch this"". Anticipating, from the visuals and advertising, this film would be a trippy ride through prison lane. Unfortunately as soon as I started watching, I got the sense of a very sanitized film with actors who I am sure had lots of terms and conditions imposed on the filmmakers prior to diving into making the film. In one word, the film just does not seem authentic. A simple a word as that maybe, it is the lifeblood of films of this type. If you are going to go through the troubles of doing a prison drama, get in there and get your feet wet. The actors skimped on all situations. Not sure if the script was written like that or what happened between the production and final cut. Whatever may have happened in the process, it is obvious many things got chopped and with them the fear and tension that this sort of situation brings about for any straight attorney who would have been wrongly classified in a prison system. The girl that the attorney meets at the beginning is so obviously female, she was miscast in the first place. Nowhere did her performance remotely resemble that of someone who may have been previously male. If you are going to do something like this.. go all the way. Get the real thing. You would never see obviously real women in a K-11 section and that is what spoiled it for me. Sometimes playing it safe can inhibit your film from all of the wonderful possibilities that could have been effective if more time and effort was placed in finding actors who could accurately portray a grim situation successfully in a rather dark place. My suspension of disbelieve got interrupted several times and at every attempt I made to try to immerse myself in the reality of what should have been a very dark, disturbing, spine tingling situation for the viewer. In other words I expected something around the realm of ""OZ"" the very successful cable series that did exemplify the tensions and fears that prison life entail. Sad to say, I felt instead of OZ I got something along the lines of ""the wizard of OZ"" version sprinkled with mild to light tension. Unfortunately, this was a missed opportunity.  1.5/10",1,a great concept fails for playing it safe,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2259,"['heard', 'film', 'looked', 'up', 'premise', 'seemed', 'fascinating', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'must', 'watch', 'Anticipating', 'visuals', 'advertising', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'trippy', 'ride', 'prison', 'lane', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'watching', 'got', 'sense', 'very', 'sanitized', 'film', 'actors', 'who', 'am', 'sure', 'had', 'lots', 'terms', 'conditions', 'imposed', 'filmmakers', 'prior', 'diving', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'word', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'authentic', 'simple', 'word', 'maybe', 'lifeblood', 'films', 'type', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'troubles', 'doing', 'prison', 'drama', 'get', 'there', 'get', 'feet', 'wet', 'actors', 'skimped', 'situations', 'Not', 'sure', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'what', 'happened', 'production', 'final', 'cut', 'may', 'have', 'happened', 'process', 'obvious', 'many', 'things', 'got', 'chopped', 'fear', 'tension', 'sort', 'situation', 'brings', 'straight', 'attorney', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wrongly', 'classified', 'prison', 'system', 'girl', 'attorney', 'meets', 'beginning', 'so', 'obviously', 'female', 'was', 'miscast', 'first', 'place', 'Nowhere', 'did', 'performance', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'previously', 'male', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'something', 'this..', 'go', 'way', 'Get', 'real', 'thing', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'obviously', 'real', 'women', 'K-11', 'section', 'what', 'spoiled', 'Sometimes', 'playing', 'safe', 'can', 'inhibit', 'film', 'wonderful', 'possibilities', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'was', 'placed', 'finding', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'accurately', 'portray', 'grim', 'situation', 'successfully', 'rather', 'dark', 'place', 'suspension', 'disbelieve', 'got', 'interrupted', 'several', 'times', 'attempt', 'made', 'try', 'immerse', 'reality', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'spine', 'tingling', 'situation', 'viewer', 'other', 'words', 'expected', 'something', 'realm', 'OZ', 'very', 'successful', 'cable', 'series', 'did', 'exemplify', 'tensions', 'fears', 'prison', 'life', 'entail', 'Sad', 'say', 'felt', 'instead', 'OZ', 'got', 'something', 'lines', 'wizard', 'OZ', 'version', 'sprinkled', 'mild', 'light', 'tension', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', '1.5/10']",K-11
1625890,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BDANU94,Grady Harp,"[5, 9]","Someone likely had a good idea in planning this film: place a straight man in a prison cell area reserved for homosexuals and all variations of gender role playing. That concept could prove interesting as an exploration of `community' among the `unwanted' of detainees. But as written by Jared Kurt and Jules Stewart and especially as directed by Jules Stewart the film loses all semblance of originality, for one reason - because it casts women in the roles of transsexuals and transvestites so as not to offend the actors or the audience with same sex variations.But that is only one reason this film sinks. The script is tepid to poor, a story is practically nonexistent, and the characters are tropes played by actors who seem embarrassed by what they are asked to do. What little story there is can be summarized as follows: a wealthy but drug addicted and alcoholic record produced named Raymond Saxx (Goran Visnjic, one of our stronger actors usually) passes out, is arrested for homicide, and thrown into LA County Jail in a unit reserved for Homosexuals and sexual deviants K-11. From there it is a power struggle run by transvestite Mousey (the first female - Kate del Castillo - cast as a male and it doesn't work). Cocaine and other drugs are readily available through the corruption of Ben (Jason Mewes) who works in the office of the deputy Sgt. Johnson (DB Sweeney) who is likewise drug addled and preys on the inmates for sexual favors. Bad things happen, such as the murder of child molester Detroit (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister) by transsexual Butterfly (Portia Doubleday) and Raymond finally comes out of his cloudy drug abused head and figures a way out of this very odd confinement, but not without a series of meaningless circumstances that serve only to point out the depravity of the inmates.Yes, it is that bad. Try as you may to find a saving grace to this film is without success. Perhaps if the writers and director had had the courage to use an all male cast instead of putting female actors in the roles of men who are range from simply nelly to butch to surgically transformed (in various stages) into transsexuals the film may have had a reason for being made. As it is, it is an embarrassment for Goran Visnjic, and DB Sweeney and the rest of the actors who for some reason signed on to this poorly conceived and made project.

But being an ethnic minority and sexual minority, I can certainly sympathize with issues of representation in art and media.  There is a saying:  &#34;Representation saves lives.&#34;  I believe that.I did not like K-11 because of its portrayal of transgender people in incarceration.  Specifically, I do not like that the transgender women were portrayed by cisgender women.  I think that was unnecessary and inauthentic to the story being told.  I am not speaking of &#34;passability&#34; per se - even though I never once believed these actresses as trans-women.  I am moreso speaking on the blatant disrespect of the trans community and trans actors and actresses.  For as low-budget as this film had to be, it would have been a wise investment to find new and emerging trans actresses to give these characters more authenticity.The story itself was flimsy and largely unengaging and the performances were cartoonish.

1625893,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00BDANU94,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","Raymond Saxx (Goran Visnjic) finds himself in jail and needing a fix. He is charged with murder, which he is unaware (bad plot point) and through the dealings of a sadistic drug loving gay guard (D.B. Sweeney) he finds himself locked up in K-11 section of the grocery aisle with fruits and nuts. He manages to get along fairly well. There are personality differences and corruption abounds which makes for the plot, consisting mostly of interesting character interaction, but moves slow linearly.I enjoyed watching a prison film with the diverse characters. Mousey (Kate del Castillo) was not the tough transsexual cardboard character, but was rather realistic, showing weakness as well. Butterfly (Portia Doubleday) was an interesting hermaphrodite who sometimes spoke poetically. They should have named her Swan and had her speak in rhyme all the time. The could have done so and might of added some humor to the tale.The DVD cover makes it look like Raymond spends his whole time in a dungeon like cell. That was not the case. This is a film for those who enjoy the interactions of unique indie characters. The gay couplings, what few there were, are not graphic.
