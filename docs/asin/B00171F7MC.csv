1155589,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,B00171F7MC,Andrew Kear,"[0, 0]","Quincy was in a way the predecessor to shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV. The show was one of the first to feature actually forensic equipment that was used in the real world, and many of the first season episodes felt authentic. The show was originally apart of NBC mysteries movies, but proved popular enough to branch out of its own. ""The Thigh Bone's Connected to the Knee Bone"" was typical of one of the early episode where believable forensic investigate was used to reconstruct the remains of a football player. That show won an Emmy. The first few seasons were actually pretty convincing for their time, and for the most part hold up today, without having to resort to the gore of shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV.However, as the show progressed the shows become preachier, and it was not uncommon for Quincy to get up on his soap box. Quincy in later seasons went beyond being a coroner and became a voice against pollution, corporate greed, and even Tourettes syndrome.There is nothing wrong with this but it is not really the job of a coroner. Never-the-less, even these episodes were entertaining. Some of these episode have become camp classics like the infamous punk rock episode, where you had the feeling the writers had little grasp of the subject matter.Still, I find Quincy far more entertaining than the dry CSI series, whose characters just don't really interest me. Even when Jack Klugman sometimes hams it up on the screen at least he is interesting to watch.

1155610,A2E9TRM8096BXU,B00171F7MC,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[3, 3]","Season Three of QUINCY saw the show come fully and finally into its own, and with wonderful results. It's the first truly ""full"" season of the show, and begins the overdue process of fleshing out the show's characters and taking more of the episodes off soundstages and backlots and actually exploiting Los Angeles as a location. Mostly, however, it's where Jack Klugman really comes into his own as Quincy, M.E. - crusty, hot-tempered, and always ready to throw down will all manner of evildoers, using not a gun but his brains and medical training to be, in essence, a one man CSI team.The formula of QUINCY was pretty simple, yet very daring for its time. Quincy (the rusty-voiced Jack Klugman, a walking force of nature) is a medical examiner in Los Angeles County who lives on a houseboat and is never, ever content to leave well enough alone. Not only is he too nosy to let any suspicious death ever slip past his considerable nose, he's got a heart as big as all outdoors and is constantly battling his paper-pushing superior, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin), and the ever-disbelieving Lt. Monahan (Garry Walberg) - essentially Agent Scully before there was an Agent Scully) to let him get to the bottom of (seemingly) accidental deaths, (seeming) suicides and (seeming) murders. At his side is the long suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito), who has no social life thanks to Quincy, and Danny (Val Visoglio), the owner of Danny's Bar & Restaurant, who endures Quincy's endless jokes about the quality of his food. Arrayed against them are the best character actors the late 1970s/early 80s had to offer...veterans of such TV shows as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, STAR TREK, M*A*S*H and so on.As I said above, Season 3 is not only fleshier and more sure of itself than its predecessors, it's simply better in quality, period. It's also probably the first season that really embraced ""causes"" (immigration, race, problems in amateur sports, corporate greed, etc.) rather than ""mystery"" as its meat and drink...a fact of the show that made it unusual, even unique. Nearly all the episodes are good and quite a few of them are outstanding. A few of my faves:""A Blow To The Head"" - Quincy butts heads with an old friend while investigating the death of a boxer (Joe Louis appears in a cameo).""A Dead Man's Truth"" - Quince reconstructs what happened during a complex police shooting.""Death Casts A Vote"" - An episode about California's immigration politics which is as timely today as when it was shot.""Tissue of Truth"" - A race-against-time episode in which Quince has to locate a kidnapped boy who has been buried alive...after his kidnappers have been killed without revealing the location.""Main Man"" - Quincy grapples with a ""football dad"" who seems willing to risk his son's life for the sake of winning the big game.""The Hero Syndrome"" - A man claims (Peter ""Spider-Man"" Thorwall) claims responsibility for a murder Quincy thinks he didn't commit.""Touch of Death"" - A martial arts movie star dies mysteriously, but his cousin - Sam - doesn't want the body autopsied because of the departed's Bhuddist beliefs.""Passing"" - Quincy needs help from a forensics expert when trying to put a face on a skull he accidentally discovers in the desert.""Requiem For The Living"" - A mobster who has been fatally poisoned kidnaps Quince and Sam and forces them to help him investigate his own murder.One thing that particularly pleased me about this season was that it started the process of exploring the supporting characters, who up to that point were simply cardboard cutouts. ""Touch of Death"" is Sam's not-just-a-sidekick moment, just as""Double Death"" gives a much-overdue third dimension to the Asten character (who in subsequent seasons becomes one of the best things about QUINCY). But in truth, few shows ever revolved so totally around the personality of their lead actor as this one did. Klugman is one of those rare actors who is so charismatic and vital that anything he does, from complaining about the crappy coffee in the lab to running from hit-men, is equally compelling. His relish for life galvanizes his character, whose almost unbelievably bad temper and tendency to shout at the slightest provocation might otherwise have been a bit off-putting (now it's just funny).It's true, of course, that the show often has a cheesy ""after-school special"" heavy handedness, what with its ""causes"" and warnings and moral messages and all. It's equally true that it is very dated, not just in the fashion and technology senses but in its rather nave outlook and its tendency to force happy endings on almost every story; but this too is part of its charm. And what the hell, you've gotta give Quince major propers for solving his cases without DNA, cell phones, the Internet, or even much in the way of computers. He's an old fashioned gumshoe detective, except that he wields a scalpel (and a hot temper) instead of a pistol and is about as gold-hearted as any character ever written for television. And you know what? In an age where ""moral ambiguity"" is almost a byword, that's all right by me. Quincy can perform my autopsy anytime.",5,"Quincy, A.M.
