354779,AGEIT17HENDIS,6303079660,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","No one has ever doubted Woody Allen's sentimental attachment to the power of the movies to make some strong cultural statements about its place in modern American society. This film cleverly addresses that issue by going to the source- the audience. And in this particular case a significant demographic part of that audience-young women, married or not, who peopled the theaters in the hey day of movie going before World War II.Here Mia Farrow plays the put upon wife of a ne'er do well husband who seeks solace through getting wrapped up in celluloid. And, lo and behold, then up pops Mr. Right (Jeff Daniels) right off the screen.  Unfortunately his existence is mere celluloid but in the end he may be more real than the movie industry moguls who in real life care about the bottom line more than the delivery of dreams. This theme has been done many times in many ways, including variations by Woody himself, but it is nice to see it done with a nice touch of humor, pathos and bathos and a well done performance by Farrow.",4,The Stuff of Dreams,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,1029,"['one', 'ever', 'doubted', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'sentimental', 'attachment', 'power', 'movies', 'make', 'strong', 'cultural', 'statements', 'place', 'modern', 'American', 'society', 'film', 'cleverly', 'issue', 'going', 'source-', 'audience', 'particular', 'case', 'significant', 'demographic', 'part', 'audience-young', 'women', 'married', 'not', 'who', 'peopled', 'theaters', 'hey', 'day', 'movie', 'going', 'World', 'War', 'II.Here', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'put', 'wife', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'husband', 'who', 'solace', 'getting', 'wrapped', 'up', 'celluloid', 'lo', 'behold', 'then', 'pops', 'Mr', 'Right', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'right', 'off', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'existence', 'mere', 'celluloid', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'real', 'movie', 'industry', 'moguls', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'care', 'bottom', 'line', 'more', 'delivery', 'dreams', 'theme', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'ways', 'including', 'variations', 'Woody', 'nice', 'see', 'done', 'nice', 'touch', 'humor', 'pathos', 'bathos', 'well', 'done', 'performance', 'Farrow']",N/A
354780,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303079660,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","If there is one Woody Allen film that I think anyone can enjoy, it is `The Purple Rose of Cairo' (although `Hannah and Her Sisters' is quite universal too).  There is something about the way that Mia Farrow's character Cecilia connects so well with the average human being, and the way that her love affair with screen character Tom Baxter feels so genuine even when it is impossible.  I just can't help but feel this wonderful feeling of closure every time I watch this movie (which has only been a few times since I just recently have been turned onto Allen in general).  I just feel such a raw connection to this movie, and I know that many have felt the same connection.The film takes place in 1930's New Jersey and follows unhappily married Cecilia as she smothers her sorrows by frequenting the local movie theater to watch a film entitled `The Purple Rose of Cairo'.  Cecilia's husband is abusive and unfaithful and her clumsy demeanor has just cost her her job.  Feeling low and worthless she decides to watch `The Purple Rose of Cairo' once again to lift her spirits only to have her world turned upside down when one of the characters, archaeologist Tom Baxter, walks right off the screen into the theater and drags her out the back door.  Tom is everything that Cecilia needs and she him, but their romance is ill fated.  Hollywood is up in arms at the fact that Tom Baxter's all over the country are walking off the screen and the film is suffering since none of the other characters can function without things back to normal.  Cecilia's husband begins to suspect something fishy with regards to his wife's newfound affair and the actor Gil Shepherd, who plays Tom Baxter, is desperately trying to convince his character to return to the film from which he escaped.The film sounds like frothy fun, and it is fun, but it is also far from frothy.`The Purple Rose of Cairo' is a very strong character study on the fact that all of us make a difference.  Even a small character in a film is there for a reason and without him the rest of the world ceases to operate.  It also shows the desperation in all of us to break free from the confines of expectation and just be our own person, instead of what the world has conditioned us to be.  Cecilia wants to be like the characters in her favorite movies and Tom wants to be like the average Joe sitting in the seat in front of him.  We all want what we can't have, but in the end have to find that balance that makes us happy.Woody Allen is a classic director, and the more I watch of his films the more enamored I am by the creative genius that he was (and at times still is).  I have never been a huge follower of directors, always being more of an actor's man than anything else, but recently I've been researching directors and their body of work and I must say that Woody Allen is one of the most impressive.  A lot of people that I know are put off by Allen's style of filmmaking, but what I find most impressive about films like `The Purple Rose of Cairo', `Hannah and Her Sisters' and `Alice' is that they have so much of Allen's style while building themselves into another bracket altogether from his more famed work like `Annie Hall'.  This is without doubt a Woody Allen film, but it is an Allen film that any and everyone can enjoy.",5,One of the sweetest smells in Woody's rosebush...,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,3302,"['one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'Hannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'quite', 'universal', 'too', 'something', 'way', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'character', 'Cecilia', 'so', 'well', 'average', 'human', 'being', 'way', 'love', 'affair', 'screen', 'character', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'feels', 'so', 'genuine', 'even', 'when', 'impossible', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'feeling', 'closure', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'been', 'few', 'times', 'just', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'Allen', 'general', 'just', 'feel', 'such', 'raw', 'connection', 'movie', 'know', 'many', 'have', 'felt', 'same', 'connection.The', 'film', 'place', '1930', 'New', 'Jersey', 'unhappily', 'married', 'Cecilia', 'sorrows', 'frequenting', 'local', 'movie', 'theater', 'watch', 'film', 'entitled', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'Cecilia', 'husband', 'abusive', 'unfaithful', 'clumsy', 'demeanor', 'just', 'cost', 'job', 'Feeling', 'low', 'worthless', 'watch', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'once', 'again', 'lift', 'spirits', 'only', 'have', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'archaeologist', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'walks', 'right', 'off', 'screen', 'theater', 'drags', 'out', 'back', 'door', 'Tom', 'everything', 'Cecilia', 'needs', 'romance', 'ill', 'fated', 'Hollywood', 'up', 'arms', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'country', 'are', 'walking', 'off', 'screen', 'film', 'suffering', 'none', 'other', 'characters', 'can', 'function', 'things', 'back', 'normal', 'Cecilia', 'husband', 'suspect', 'something', 'fishy', 'regards', 'wife', 'newfound', 'affair', 'actor', 'Gil', 'Shepherd', 'who', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'desperately', 'trying', 'convince', 'character', 'return', 'film', 'film', 'sounds', 'frothy', 'fun', 'fun', 'also', 'far', 'frothy.', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'very', 'strong', 'character', 'study', 'fact', 'make', 'difference', 'Even', 'small', 'character', 'film', 'there', 'reason', 'rest', 'world', 'operate', 'also', 'desperation', 'break', 'free', 'confines', 'expectation', 'just', 'be', 'own', 'person', 'instead', 'what', 'world', 'conditioned', 'be', 'Cecilia', 'be', 'characters', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Tom', 'be', 'average', 'Joe', 'sitting', 'seat', 'front', 'want', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'end', 'have', 'find', 'balance', 'happy.Woody', 'Allen', 'classic', 'director', 'more', 'watch', 'films', 'more', 'enamored', 'am', 'creative', 'genius', 'was', 'times', 'still', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'follower', 'directors', 'always', 'being', 'more', 'actor', 'man', 'anything', 'else', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'researching', 'directors', 'body', 'work', 'must', 'say', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'lot', 'people', 'know', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'Allen', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'what', 'find', 'most', 'impressive', 'films', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'Alice', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'Allen', 'style', 'building', 'bracket', 'altogether', 'more', 'famed', 'work', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'doubt', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'Allen', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy']",N/A

354782,A9Y947FCJZPVL,6303079660,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 1]","I think everyone is familiar with idealization. Idealization is, after all, what we always do. It is how we deal with the real, we adapt it in a way that can provides us with reassurance, with a certain logic. Philosophers like Zizek would affirm that, in fact, fantasy can be stronger than reality. Because, in the end, what is reality but an amount of statements and common sense that we all agree upon?Cecilia, a waitress trying to survive in the middle of the greatest financial depression in America, lives a common life. She barely makes enough money to get by, she's married to an abusive, alcoholic and jobless man. And she has no real future ahead of her, rather than spend her youth, her whole life washing dishes in the local diner.Her only cheerful moments take place in the cinema. She goes every day and watches the same movie. For a couple of hours she feels transported into a world of glamour, of beautiful men and women, a world in which everything makes sense, a world where happy endings are possible. In an era of poverty, movies are the ideal escapism. Movies are a window that allows the impoverished people to see life not as it is but as it could or should be.Woody Allen is not only a great director but also a true connoisseur of cinema. Hollywood's films in the 20s relied deeply on spectacular images just as they do now, but what today is CGI (and explosions or big action sequences), decades ago was grand sets, hundreds of extras, complex choreographies, exotic scenarios and so on. That's the kind of films that Cecilia has access to. And as enamored as she is with this world of richness and splendor, she must come to reality and accept the hardships of life.That is of course, until Tom Baxter, the adventurer, the handsome hero from the film, starts talking to her through the screen. He knows she loves the movie, she's been there every day. And he knows he loves her. And just like that, Tom Baxter is no longer a black and white, two dimensional character, he is now a person walking out of the screen and reaching out to her.It happens in the movies, but it can also happen in real life: love at first sight. Cecilia and Tom are in love, but she doesn't know how to deal with this strange situation. He is a fictional character, he has never been in the real world, and he carries a certain naivet&eacute; but also a certain magic, a sense of wonder that reminds her that being alive, and making choices, is all that matters.With a very ironic venue, Woody Allen reminds us that Hollywood is a cruel machinery in which profits and lawyers are more important than directors or actors. And once that these businessmen realize that the impossible has happened in New Jersey, they decide to fix the situation. Giles Shepherd, the actor that plays Tom Baxter, is worried about having a duplicate of him running amok in the streets. He has a career to protect, a reputation to uphold. When he discovers that Cecilia knows where to find Tom Baxter he tries to convince his creation to return to the screen, where he belongs, but to no avail.Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan used to say that desire towards our 'object a' depends on the phantasm (Ecrits: The First Complete Edition in English); which in a way means that the object of our desire is never ours, our thirst is never quenched and we are doomed to unsatisfactory pursuits, always. This happens because the object of desire comes to us mediated through a veil that conceals the real, and thus strengthens what in this case is only an idealized image, a reflection of something that doesn't necessarily has to be there although that is all our eyes can see. Tom Baxter is the mirrored ideal that originates from Giles Shepherd, but at the same time, both are the ideal partners for Cecilia. One of them is fictitious and because of that he is also perfect; the other one is human, flawed, but authentic.As the days go by, Cecilia falls in love with Giles, and dreams of leaving behind an awful reality, a mediocre existence. At the same time, she has some of the most amazing experiences of her life with Tom Baxter, as he takes her into the screen and into the very world she has always fantasized about. He takes her to the exclusive clubs and the mansions she had only seen in screen. He makes her know a new world, visually stunning; a black and white universe where things have a way of always working out in the end.And then comes a moment, a moment in which she has to make a decision. Will she stay with Tom Baxter or Giles Shepherd? The character or the actor? The fiction or the reality? The ideal or the real? Making decisions is what makes us humans, but then again, pain, hunger, poverty and decay inevitably come with humanity. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice to say that I have never seen a greater, sadder and more significant sacrifice than the one seen here. The Purple Rose of Cairo is truly one of the most magnificent classics ever.",5,Idealization versus the real (spoilers),1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,4948,"['think', 'everyone', 'familiar', 'idealization', 'Idealization', 'what', 'always', 'do', 'how', 'deal', 'real', 'adapt', 'way', 'can', 'reassurance', 'certain', 'logic', 'Philosophers', 'Zizek', 'would', 'affirm', 'fact', 'fantasy', 'can', 'be', 'stronger', 'reality', 'end', 'what', 'reality', 'amount', 'statements', 'common', 'sense', 'agree', 'Cecilia', 'waitress', 'trying', 'survive', 'middle', 'greatest', 'financial', 'depression', 'America', 'common', 'life', 'barely', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'married', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'jobless', 'man', 'real', 'future', 'ahead', 'rather', 'spend', 'youth', 'whole', 'life', 'washing', 'dishes', 'local', 'diner.Her', 'only', 'cheerful', 'moments', 'take', 'place', 'cinema', 'day', 'same', 'movie', 'couple', 'hours', 'transported', 'world', 'glamour', 'beautiful', 'men', 'women', 'world', 'everything', 'sense', 'world', 'where', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'possible', 'era', 'poverty', 'movies', 'are', 'ideal', 'escapism', 'Movies', 'are', 'window', 'impoverished', 'people', 'see', 'life', 'not', 'could', 'should', 'be.Woody', 'Allen', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'director', 'also', 'true', 'connoisseur', 'cinema', 'Hollywood', 'films', '20s', 'relied', 'deeply', 'spectacular', 'images', 'just', 'do', 'now', 'what', 'today', 'CGI', 'explosions', 'big', 'action', 'sequences', 'decades', 'was', 'grand', 'sets', 'hundreds', 'extras', 'complex', 'choreographies', 'exotic', 'scenarios', 'so', 'kind', 'films', 'Cecilia', 'access', 'as', 'enamored', 'world', 'richness', 'splendor', 'must', 'come', 'reality', 'accept', 'hardships', 'course', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'adventurer', 'handsome', 'hero', 'film', 'talking', 'screen', 'movie', 'been', 'there', 'day', 'just', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'no', 'longer', 'black', 'white', 'two', 'dimensional', 'character', 'now', 'person', 'walking', 'screen', 'reaching', 'out', 'her.It', 'happens', 'movies', 'can', 'also', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Cecilia', 'Tom', 'are', 'love', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'strange', 'situation', 'fictional', 'character', 'never', 'been', 'real', 'world', 'certain', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'also', 'certain', 'magic', 'sense', 'wonder', 'being', 'alive', 'making', 'choices', 'very', 'ironic', 'venue', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Hollywood', 'cruel', 'machinery', 'profits', 'lawyers', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'directors', 'actors', 'once', 'businessmen', 'realize', 'impossible', 'happened', 'New', 'Jersey', 'decide', 'fix', 'situation', 'Giles', 'Shepherd', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'worried', 'having', 'duplicate', 'running', 'amok', 'streets', 'career', 'protect', 'reputation', 'uphold', 'When', 'Cecilia', 'where', 'find', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'convince', 'creation', 'return', 'screen', 'where', 'avail.Psychoanalyst', 'Lacan', 'used', 'say', 'desire', ""'object"", 'phantasm', 'Ecrits', 'First', 'Complete', 'Edition', 'English', 'way', 'object', 'desire', 'never', 'ours', 'thirst', 'never', 'quenched', 'are', 'doomed', 'unsatisfactory', 'pursuits', 'always', 'object', 'desire', 'mediated', 'veil', 'real', 'thus', 'what', 'case', 'only', 'idealized', 'image', 'reflection', 'something', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'be', 'there', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'mirrored', 'ideal', 'Giles', 'Shepherd', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'ideal', 'partners', 'Cecilia', 'One', 'fictitious', 'also', 'perfect', 'other', 'one', 'human', 'flawed', 'days', 'go', 'Cecilia', 'love', 'Giles', 'dreams', 'leaving', 'awful', 'reality', 'mediocre', 'existence', 'same', 'time', 'most', 'amazing', 'experiences', 'life', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'screen', 'very', 'world', 'always', 'fantasized', 'about', 'exclusive', 'clubs', 'mansions', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'screen', 'know', 'new', 'world', 'visually', 'stunning', 'black', 'white', 'universe', 'where', 'things', 'have', 'way', 'always', 'working', 'out', 'end.And', 'then', 'moment', 'moment', 'make', 'decision', 'Will', 'stay', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'Giles', 'Shepherd', 'character', 'actor', 'fiction', 'reality', 'ideal', 'real', 'Making', 'decisions', 'what', 'humans', 'then', 'again', 'pain', 'hunger', 'poverty', 'decay', 'inevitably', 'come', 'humanity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'suffice', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'greater', 'sadder', 'more', 'significant', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'seen', 'here', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'magnificent', 'classics', 'ever']",N/A
354783,A20IIR0422G3A5,6303079660,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 3]","`The Purple Rose of Cairo', written and directed by Woody Allen, is one of those rare movies which is so strongly and imaginatively crafted that it is almost painful to watch a second or third time. While it is certainly not Allen's best, it almost seems like Allen, his actors, and his crew almost flawlessly craft it. Even the fact that Allen does not appear in the film seems to heighten its quality.While movies (or fiction) in movies play a big role in many of Allen's films such as `Play it again, Sam', `Stardust Memories', and `Deconstructing Harry', this film is unlike those, most especially since this one is not at all biographical. It is most similar to `Zelig' in that the primary premise of the plot has something of a sci-fi twist to it. In addition to the foreground story of the principle characters played by Mia Farrow, Jeff Daniels, and Danny Aiello, there is the comic relief provided by the actors on the screen in the New Jersey theatre who are free to ad lib their time on the screen, since they cannot follow through with the plot with one of the main characters out roaming the streets of New Jersey. One has to thank Allen for this, as without the relief of the figures coming alive on the screen, the movie would be almost unbearably sad.As Allen's movies are typically done on a small budget and he has a great reputation for bringing projects in on time and within budget, it is a little surprising to see the quality of the filming in this movie. Of course, since the whole premise is based on the contrast between the fictional film and the `real' film, much effort was put into the quality of both. The quality of the `film within a film' is especially well done, as the characters really look like they are from an early 1930's film, except for the very recognizable Edward Herrmann.And, the acting in the `real' film is even better, as the `fictional' film acting is just a bit over the top. Daniels and Aiello are especially strong throughout the film. Farrow seems just a little too much like her usual `Rosemary's Baby' mousy character until the final scene when she shows a transformation on her face over the course of about two minutes which is so subtle, you may miss it if you were not expecting it. Since you do look for it, the incredibly slow but obvious transformation from sadness to engagement in the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rodgers movie is a tour de force.This may be one of Allen's most philosophically deep films, which enhances the film's interest without weighing it down so that you can no longer appreciate the story. I can attest to the deep philosophical content with the fact that when I was young, I wondered whether I was `real' or only part of a movie. And, this was at least 25 years before the release of `The Purple Rose of Cairo'. This puzzle led me to take up the study of philosophy in college.None of Allen's films have any director's commentary, but this is one where I would be most interested in hearing where Allen got some of his inspiration. Then again, there is very little here which is entirely new. Allen is giving us a new treatment of many of his usual themes using many of his usual devices. But, as usual, every time Allen throws all these ingredients into to the mix for a new movie, he seems to come up with a new and engrossing way to bring them all together.Surprisingly, for a film with a fantasy premise, this work has a lot less humor than the very realistic movies such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors' and `Hannah and Her Sisters'. For that reason, it may be less enjoyable to own, but I think it is easily among the upper half of Allen's films in overall quality.",5,Woody's Most Philosophica Film.

""Rose"" is witty, thoughtful, masterfully directed and acted, and, for once, we get a chance to enjoy Woody Allen's great talent as a skillful director, without his setting foot on the screen (not even in a cameo--like Alfred Hitchcock did in all of his films).Cecilia (Mia Farrow), is a waitress at a diner, during a time in the 1920s when the Great Depression has set in, times are tough, jobs are scarce and the people are looking  for an escape.  What better way to seek a diversion than in a movie theatre, where one can live a life of romance, comedy, drama and adventure, vicariously through the larger-than-life actors on the projecting screen?Cecilia's all-consuming passion for films is her one refuge from the grim life she has built with her abusive, philandering husband (Danny Aiello).  One of her favorite films, by far, is ""The Purple Rose of Cairo.""  When she likes a film she will see it over and over again, almost nightly.  Furthermore, when she isn't in the movie theatre watching the film she knows almost line-for-line, she discusses the plot and the smoldering actors with her co-workers.  Cecilia may have stepped away from the fantasy of the silver screen, once the picture has ended, but it lives on in her heart long afterwards.One night, when she goes to ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" for the upteenth time, the adventuresome and brawny Tom Baxter, the romantic lead (Jeff Daniels), sees the starstruck Cecilia sitting alone in the theatre, and literally steps off of the screen to be with this mysterious and beautiful woman whose life revolves around films and melding life on screen with life in the day-to-day world.  This has never happened before, and Tom causes quite a stir in the film world, as well as up on screen, because the characters literally cannot leave the scene they were acting in until he returns.  Also, the actor who portrays Tom Baxter is stunned and concerned that his clone, or, rather, his character has taken on a life of his own in the 3-D world!This film truly has staying power from beginning to end.  It is packed with witty dialogue, clever insight and plenty of warm, over the top humor that is, oftentimes, uproariously funny.

""The Purple Rose..."" is wonderful, is one if Allen's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor, romance and drama, reality and fiction. It is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and Depression Era New York City where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater. The story focuses on Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man (Danny Aiello). Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities. One day, as she watches ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" for the 10th or maybe 15th time, the leading man Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels) decides to leave the movie and be with Cecilia in real life. His screen partners are left confused and ""trapped"" in a scene they can't get out of. The live actor who plays Baxter is blamed by the film's producer for his character's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen. Cecilia's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening.

The Purple Rose of Cairo is, ifI'm not mistaken, the second time in his career he'd stayed behind thecamera (the previous one was Interiors), and much like he would againin the 90's with Everyone Says I Love You and Sweet & Lowdown, Woodyhas taken the opportunity to examine film and entertainment from adifferent angle, and not use the kind of sly dialog and dry humor thatusually character his starring roles.These films, of course, don't quite have the depth of his earlier, morepersonal works - namely and especially, Annie Hall and Manhattan. Noris it as daringly original like 1983's underrated masterpiece Zelig.The Purple Rose of Cairo is closer to it's predecessor of the previousyear, Broadway Danny Rose, and like that film it's, on most levels,entertainment as pure in form as Woody has ever made. Still, what boththese movies have in abundances is charm and atmosphere, and in myopinion, Purple Rose is the better of the two. In Purple Rose Allenrevisits his great love-hate relationship with Hollywood, and hecreates a charming ode to Hollywood of the 30's while never neglectingto point out how naive and out of context it really was. Clearly,there's no room for a Manhattenite Woody Allen character in there - hegracefully gives center stage to his spouse and muse Mia Farrow, whogives one of her most powerful performances in an Allen film. She'ssupported by a lovely young Jeff Daniels and a fantastic Danny Aiello,who both highlight the huge gaps between Hollywood life, small townlife and the movies during the Great Depression.The Purple Rose of Cairo is neither deep or particularly involving; thecharacters and relationships are, for the most part, stereotypical andsymbolic and lack any real intense exploration. What Allen does succeedin creating in it, and wonderfully so, is atmosphere, an amazingatmosphere that manages to capture the viewers and transport them. Andso, even if it's neither extremely important nor extremely funny,Purple Rose is grabbing and entertaining all the way through, and itmanages to blend the comedy, romance and fantasy elements into aperfectly charming piece of cinema. Purple Rose is a pleasure,recommended for viewing with a loved one, in a darkened living room, ona big screen TV, with a big bowl of popcorn.",4,"Not Allen's best, but charming and entertaining",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,2443,"['something', 'appealing', 'few', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'whichhe', ""n't"", 'act', 'give', 'chance', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'hisamazing', 'talent', 'different', 'angle', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'ifI', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'second', 'time', 'career', ""'d"", 'stayed', 'thecamera', 'previous', 'one', 'was', 'Interiors', 'much', 'would', 'againin', '90', 'Everyone', 'Says', 'Love', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'Woodyhas', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'examine', 'film', 'entertainment', 'adifferent', 'angle', 'not', 'use', 'kind', 'sly', 'dialog', 'dry', 'humor', 'thatusually', 'character', 'starring', 'roles.These', 'films', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'depth', 'earlier', 'morepersonal', 'works', 'namely', 'especially', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'Noris', 'daringly', 'original', '1983', 'underrated', 'masterpiece', 'Zelig.The', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'closer', 'predecessor', 'previousyear', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'film', 'most', 'levels', 'entertainment', 'pure', 'form', 'Woody', 'ever', 'made', 'Still', 'what', 'boththese', 'movies', 'have', 'abundances', 'charm', 'atmosphere', 'myopinion', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'better', 'two', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Allenrevisits', 'great', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Hollywood', 'charming', 'ode', 'Hollywood', '30', 'never', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'naive', 'context', 'really', 'was', 'Clearly', 'room', 'Manhattenite', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'hegracefully', 'center', 'stage', 'spouse', 'muse', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Allen', 'film', ""She'ssupported"", 'lovely', 'young', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'fantastic', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'who', 'highlight', 'huge', 'gaps', 'Hollywood', 'life', 'small', 'townlife', 'movies', 'Great', 'Depression.The', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'neither', 'deep', 'particularly', 'involving', 'thecharacters', 'relationships', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'stereotypical', 'andsymbolic', 'lack', 'real', 'intense', 'exploration', 'What', 'Allen', 'succeedin', 'creating', 'wonderfully', 'so', 'atmosphere', 'amazingatmosphere', 'capture', 'viewers', 'transport', 'Andso', 'even', 'extremely', 'important', 'extremely', 'funny', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'grabbing', 'entertaining', 'way', 'itmanages', 'blend', 'comedy', 'romance', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'aperfectly', 'charming', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'pleasure', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'loved', 'one', 'darkened', 'living', 'room', 'ona', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'big', 'bowl', 'popcorn']",N/A

354801,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6303079660,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","An absolutely masterpiece, Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" is a great movie that even people who don't usually like Woody Allen might like. I love Woody Allen and out of all of the films I've seen by him (7, I think) this is in my top 3 (below Annie Hall and Manhattan). The movie blends comedy, romance, drama, and features a genuinely sad ending. Allen's baby mama (and wife's mama) Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a Depression-era housewife trapped in an unhappy marriage. She works as a waitress, makes little money, and is clumsy which frequently pisses off her boss. To escape from everything, she goes to the movies. When she sees the newest movie, 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' she falls in love with the character Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels); When Cecilia is finally fired from her job, she sees the movie five times in a row prompting the character Tom to take notice. In doing so, he walks right out of the screen and into the arms of Cecilia. Leaving his fellow characters trapped in the movie and needing him to come back, Tom takes off from the theatre prompting management to call the films producers. When the actor who plays Tom, Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels again) gets wind of it...He fears his career may be in jeopardy and he seeks out Tom, but falls in love with Cecilia in the process. Meanwhile, on screens across America; The Tom Baxters are going haywire, forgetting their lines and trying get out of the movie. It's definitely a strange and original idea that could fail in the wrong hands. Any fan of Allen's should love it, but I did say that non-Allen fans would like it too. Here's why. If you don't like Woody Allen because of his work (a lot of people don't like him because of the Soon-Yi debacle), then it's probably because you don't like the neurotic character that's featured in almost all of his films (and almost always played by him) or you don't look his way of storytelling (the Greek thing in ""Mighty Aphrodite"" or the three endings in ""Sweet and Lowdown""); This film has no neurotic Woody character, straight-forward storytelling. The only way you could even tell it's a Woody Allen movie is from the score and the credit sequences. This is a truly wonderful movie and I highly recommend it.GRADE: A",5,A Masterpiece,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2240,"['absolutely', 'masterpiece', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'great', 'movie', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'might', 'like', 'love', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', '7', 'think', 'top', '3', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'movie', 'comedy', 'romance', 'drama', 'genuinely', 'sad', 'ending', 'Allen', 'baby', 'mama', 'wife', 'mama', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Cecilia', 'Depression-era', 'housewife', 'trapped', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'waitress', 'little', 'money', 'clumsy', 'frequently', 'boss', 'escape', 'everything', 'movies', 'When', 'newest', 'movie', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'love', 'character', 'Tom', 'Baxter', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'When', 'Cecilia', 'finally', 'fired', 'job', 'movie', 'five', 'times', 'row', 'prompting', 'character', 'Tom', 'take', 'notice', 'doing', 'so', 'walks', 'right', 'screen', 'arms', 'Cecilia', 'Leaving', 'fellow', 'characters', 'trapped', 'movie', 'needing', 'come', 'back', 'Tom', 'theatre', 'prompting', 'management', 'call', 'films', 'producers', 'When', 'actor', 'who', 'Tom', 'Gil', 'Shepherd', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'again', 'wind', 'career', 'may', 'be', 'jeopardy', 'out', 'Tom', 'love', 'Cecilia', 'process', 'Meanwhile', 'screens', 'America', 'Tom', 'Baxters', 'are', 'going', 'haywire', 'forgetting', 'lines', 'trying', 'get', 'movie', 'definitely', 'strange', 'original', 'idea', 'could', 'fail', 'wrong', 'hands', 'fan', 'Allen', 'should', 'love', 'did', 'say', 'non-Allen', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'too', 'Here', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'work', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Soon-Yi', 'debacle', 'then', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'neurotic', 'character', 'featured', 'almost', 'films', 'almost', 'always', 'played', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'way', 'storytelling', 'Greek', 'thing', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'three', 'endings', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'film', 'neurotic', 'Woody', 'character', 'straight-forward', 'storytelling', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'even', 'tell', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'score', 'credit', 'sequences', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.GRADE']",N/A

There she becomes hook on &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo,&quot; which she watches so many times that Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), the dashing archaeologist of the film becomes so distracted he decides to leave the film and walks off the screen into Cecilia's life. Suddenly Cecilia is happy, even if Tom is just a fictional character. Meanwhile, Hollywood is in an uproar as other Tom Baxters are threatening to walk out of the picture as well, leaving it to actor Gil Shepherd to try and reign in the character he created.Some critics dismissed this Woody Allen film as a flip on Buster Keaton's silent classic &quot;Sherlock Jr.,&quot; a surreal fantasy about a film projectionist and amateur detective who climbs into a movie. But so what if the idea is not new? The chief charm here is what Allen does with the idea. The romantic triangle between Cecilia, Tom and Gil is pleasant enough, but for me what is hysterical is what is going on back at the theater with the characters in the movie who are waiting to find out what happens. Henry (Edward Herrmann) is worried they will turn off the projector and make everything dark, while Jason (John Wood) insists the movie is really about him so they do not need Tom to come back. Rita (Deborah Rush) points out she is rich and does not have to put up with this nonsense while the maid, Delilah (Annie Joe Edwards) objects to people being in the wrong reel. Of course the time comes for Cecilia to go through the looking glass to join Larry (Van Johnson) and the Countess (Zoe Caldwell) at the swank nightclub, where Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers) is quite upset to find Tom with another woman. The idea that movies are truly &quot;screen plays&quot; that the actors play out several times a day is carried off marvelously. Meanwhile, the audiences are staying at the theater to see what happens next. The non-movie is as interesting as the real thing.Mia Farrow actually has the Woody Allen part in this Woody Allen movie in which Woody Allen does not appear. The accent is a bit much (not as grating as her comic turn in &quot;Radio Days&quot;), but Cecilia is clearly a sweet soul and there is something about the way the light of the movies plays with her eyes that captures her happiness at finding the escape. Of course, reality, not to mention the Hollywood studio system, are out for money and not happiness, so that there cannot be a storybook ending. &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; is more than a one-joke film, although certainly it is more streamlined that your average Allen film. Besides, despite the enticing impulse to do so, I do not see this as an indictment of Hollywood or the para-social interaction of real audiences with fictional characters.

354807,A1U6B2LDK3BUVU,6303079660,"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are...","[2, 7]","This is a very strong movie, a gem as other reviewers have said.  It is Woody Allen entering the world of fantasy, mixing a very large dose of fantasy in with his reality.  Characters in the movies relate directly with the audience and in one case, walk off the movie screen and into the theatre to mix with the people.  Jeff Daniels of Dumb and Dumber is a small player in a film who walks right off the screen to be with the real life girl he has fallen in love with, Mia Farrow, wife of the loutish Danny Aiello, during the Depression.Mia is frustratingly weak.  She allows herself to be hit by Danny, to be cheated on and ridiculed.  She is a sponge and a sap who supports a worthless taker of a husband.  When his entreaties and his threats both fail to make her stay with him and continue to support him, he lets her go, knowing she won't last out there alone, knowing she'll return to him in a little while, and he's always right.  So Mia is a frustrating character to root for.  She never wins.Danny isn't the most realistic character, or at least I don't think he is.  In almost every one of his scenes I am left believing that his words and his behavior are not realistic.  A real man wouldn't talk and act that way.  Of course a real man might cheat on his wife, lie to her, smack her.  I'm not disputing that.  But I think every one of his scenes is poorly written and unrealistically played.  Woody is dabbling, making it up as he goes along, creating a character who doesn't behave as a cheating, lying, brutish man would.  Are you a sensitive enough viewer to pick that up about him and recognize the lack of realism in the lines he is given?  Probably not.  Most people aren't.  But it's there.  If you have an ear for realistic dialogue and motivation, Danny Aiello's scenes will all be jarring.  His quick changes are all artificial, maybe because Woody doesn't have a feel for how a guy like that would really be.  Does the fight scene and its aftermath ring true for you?  If so, you don't have a feel for reality either.  None of Danny's scenes are very good, and it's Woody's fault, not Danny's.I suppose he could argue that the whole movie is a fantasy, so what am I looking for reality for.  He doesn't really care about realism.  He's just painting, like a French impressionist, so enjoy the ride.  But I prefer some realism in my characters.  Otherwise what's the point.Still, I was debating between four stars and five, because it is an excellent movie.  The reason I settled on only four isn't the lack of reality in Mia's marriage, but the dud of an ending.  It didn't have to be that way.  Woody didn't have to leave us with a dud ending.  He thinks he did have to, I think he didn't.Look, Mia, you are too weak and stupid, too chained to your circumstances, to do anything about your marriage or your life, and besides that, we will see to it that you don't catch a break anywhere you turn.  So just live out your futile life and then die a loser and a sap.Thank you Woody for that excellent view of life on Earth.  For that, I take away one of your stars.The strongest thing about this movie for me is the way Woody tears away the veil of reality from our present lives.  I happen to agree that this world is a stage set, that there really is another, a more real world, call it Heaven, and that everything here on Earth is a stage prop.  As Macbeth says, we are poor players strutting and fretting our hour upon the stage, and yes, I think this Earth is nothing but a stage to play out our dramas before we return home to reality, to our home in Heaven.  So I like the way Woody strips away the illusion of reality to our lives here on Earth.  I don't think Earth is ""real"", and if you read a modern physics book you will see that our top scientists don't either.  Earth is just the view that we are set up to see, based on what we're made of.  A tiny subatomic particle would pass right through the space between the atoms of the Earth and not even know a planet is here.  And its reality is as ""real"" as ours.",4,Realism and the lack of it,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,4044,"['very', 'strong', 'movie', 'gem', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'entering', 'world', 'fantasy', 'mixing', 'very', 'large', 'dose', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'Characters', 'movies', 'relate', 'directly', 'audience', 'one', 'case', 'walk', 'movie', 'screen', 'theatre', 'mix', 'people', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'small', 'player', 'film', 'who', 'walks', 'right', 'screen', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'girl', 'fallen', 'love', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'wife', 'loutish', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Depression.Mia', 'frustratingly', 'weak', 'be', 'hit', 'Danny', 'be', 'cheated', 'ridiculed', 'sponge', 'sap', 'who', 'worthless', 'taker', 'husband', 'When', 'entreaties', 'threats', 'fail', 'make', 'stay', 'continue', 'support', 'go', 'knowing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'there', 'alone', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'return', 'little', 'while', 'always', 'right', 'So', 'Mia', 'frustrating', 'character', 'root', 'never', 'wins.Danny', ""n't"", 'most', 'realistic', 'character', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'almost', 'one', 'scenes', 'am', 'left', 'believing', 'words', 'behavior', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'real', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'talk', 'act', 'way', 'course', 'real', 'man', 'might', 'cheat', 'wife', 'lie', 'smack', ""'m"", 'not', 'disputing', 'think', 'one', 'scenes', 'poorly', 'written', 'unrealistically', 'played', 'Woody', 'dabbling', 'making', 'up', 'along', 'creating', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'behave', 'cheating', 'lying', 'brutish', 'man', 'would', 'Are', 'sensitive', 'enough', 'viewer', 'pick', 'up', 'recognize', 'lack', 'realism', 'lines', 'given', 'Probably', 'not', 'Most', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'have', 'ear', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'motivation', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'jarring', 'quick', 'changes', 'are', 'artificial', 'maybe', 'Woody', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'how', 'guy', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'fight', 'scene', 'aftermath', 'ring', 'true', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'reality', 'either', 'None', 'Danny', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Woody', 'fault', 'not', ""Danny's.I"", 'suppose', 'could', 'argue', 'whole', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'what', 'am', 'looking', 'reality', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'realism', 'just', 'painting', 'French', 'impressionist', 'so', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'prefer', 'realism', 'characters', 'Otherwise', 'what', 'point.Still', 'was', 'debating', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'excellent', 'movie', 'reason', 'settled', 'only', 'four', ""n't"", 'lack', 'reality', 'Mia', 'marriage', 'dud', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'way', 'Woody', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'leave', 'dud', 'ending', 'did', 'have', 'think', 'Mia', 'are', 'too', 'weak', 'stupid', 'too', 'chained', 'circumstances', 'do', 'anything', 'marriage', 'life', 'will', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'break', 'turn', 'So', 'just', 'live', 'out', 'futile', 'life', 'then', 'die', 'loser', 'sap.Thank', 'Woody', 'excellent', 'view', 'life', 'Earth', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'stars.The', 'strongest', 'thing', 'movie', 'way', 'Woody', 'away', 'veil', 'reality', 'present', 'lives', 'happen', 'agree', 'world', 'stage', 'set', 'really', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'call', 'Heaven', 'everything', 'here', 'Earth', 'stage', 'prop', 'Macbeth', 'are', 'poor', 'players', 'strutting', 'fretting', 'hour', 'stage', 'yes', 'think', 'Earth', 'nothing', 'stage', 'play', 'out', 'dramas', 'return', 'home', 'reality', 'home', 'Heaven', 'So', 'like', 'way', 'Woody', 'away', 'illusion', 'reality', 'lives', 'here', 'Earth', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Earth', 'real', 'read', 'modern', 'physics', 'book', 'will', 'see', 'top', 'scientists', 'do', ""n't"", 'either', 'Earth', 'just', 'view', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'see', 'based', 'what', ""'re"", 'made', 'tiny', 'subatomic', 'particle', 'would', 'pass', 'right', 'space', 'atoms', 'Earth', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'planet', 'here', 'reality', 'real', 'ours']",N/A

Each time, we pick up little scenes from the movie that is unfolding within the  movie.  Imagine the surprise, when a scene we've watched before isn't quite right.  The Tom Baxter character seems distracted.  Is it possible he just glanced out into the audience?This is exactly what Tom Baxter does, as he's noticed Ceclia watching the movie night after night.  We watch as he starts speaking to her as she sits in her theater seat and eventually he jumps down off of the screen to the surprise of the audience and the cast of the Purple Rose of Cairo.The comedy is great, as the movie cast can't proceed without Tom.  They start to bicker amongst themselves and even take out their frustration on the audience...&quot;You think you've got problems?  We've got problems of our own!&quot;  Tom and Ceclia begin an offscreen adventure that makes clever use of the fact that Tom isn't actually a real person.  There are plenty of gags and some great lines, particularly when Cecila proclaims that she's finally met the perfect man, &quot;although he is fictional.&quot;This is one of my favorite Allen films that doesn't actually star Allen.

354809,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6303079660,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Woody Allen's The Purple Rose Of Cairo ranks among his better films. The film centers on the experiences of a poor woman named Cecilia who is played wonderfully by Mia Farrow. Cecilia is trapped in a loveless marriage to a brute named Monk who is played by Danny Aiello.Cecilia has a job as a waitress in a small diner during the depression and although she tries to work hard she can't help but fantasize and chat about the movies with her sister who also works at the same diner. Cecilia's only comfort is in the movie theater watching glamorous but highly contrived movies about rich people who aren't suffering from poverty and the scorn of her husband. Cecilia eventually loses her job and after catching Monk being unfaithful to her she winds up watching The Purple Rose Of Cairo endlessly at the small movie theater in their town.Imagine Cecilia's surprise when one of the characters, the dashing all-American type guy Tom Baxter, decides to leave the film, jump from the screen into the audience, and run away with Cecilia! Tom represents the purity of heart and the true compassion that Cecilia longs for in her real marriage. She knows Tom is fictional because he came off the movie screen; but Tom maintains he's never going back because he wants to experience the real world with Cecilia as his new bride.Of course, all of this horrifies the movie theater manager and the Hollywood studio that produced the film entitled The Purple Rose Of Cairo. How inconvenient this is for Gil Shepherd, too, the actor who portrayed Tom Baxter in the film! The movie studio executives and Gil Shepherd hatch a plan to get Tom to return to the movie--but will it work? What would happen if Tom returned to the movie but took Cecilia with him into the land of make believe?The Purple Rose Of Cairo is a film you cannot afford to miss. Mia Farrow as Cecilia, Danny Aiello as Monk, Cecilia's husband and Jeff Daniels as both Gil and Tom all give some of the most convincing performances I've ever seen. Their performances moved me and engaged my attention much longer than I initially thought they would.This movie deals with the universal human desire to escape the pain and boredom of everyday life so many of us experience and to replace that misery with a world in which there are no real problems and everyone has money or at the very least a secure job. Cecilia represents us all as she delights to Tom's world of relative innocence and harmony. Therein lies the true strength of this film.The cinematography shines: I like the scenes in the movie house where you see the film being screened within Woody Allen's picture. The scenes filmed in the amusement park reflect careful forethought concerning lighting and camera angles. The choreography amazes me: I love the scenes in which both the movie theater patrons and the actors in the film are stunned by Tom's decision to leave the movie and they all move about simultaneously in ways that prove good judgment on the part of Woody Allen and his colleagues who worked on this film.Overall, The Purple Rose Of Cairo will remain an excellent film as long as the human condition and the quality of our lives are imperfect. Everybody dreams of a world where their true desires are reality and their troubles disappear. The Purple Rose Of Cairo elegantly explores this theme with sophistication, wit and poignancy.",5,I just met a wonderful new man.

354814,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303079660,Randy Keehn,"[1, 1]","In my humble opinion, Woody Allen is the best movie director that's currently out there practicing the trade.  He says more, amuses more, and creates more on a relatively ""shoestring"" budget than any other director today.  His popularity is apparently rather limited to the point that his movies usually don't even get shown in my town.  Allen's films get praised by a lot of people ""in the know"" but, come Oscar time, about the only award handed out for his productions goes for Best Supporting Actress.  Well, to each his own but I'll recommend every movie he's ever been involved in (with the lone exception of ""What's New Pussycat?""); even the ones I haven't seen yet.Last night I got my first look at ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" and I ended up rating it ""4 Star"" mainly because I thought it moved along rather awkwardly at times (by Woody Allen standards).  The concept is certainly original; an actor in a movie steps out of the screen and into real life (seems they're watching us as closely as we're watching them).  I started seeing all sorts of possibilities and, I admit, I was disappointed that some of them didn't emerge.  What did emerge was an excellent study of fantasy vs. reality.The setting for the film was in the midst of the Depression which was a brilliant idea because it gave a readily understood backdrop of gloom and doom.  Anyone would love to escape from such an existance.  Our main character, played by Mia Farrow, finds her escape in the movie theatre.  As the strange events unfold, she finds herself ultimately having to choose between fantasy and reality and we, the audience, find ourselves rooting for one choice or the other.  (Even the exasperated screen characters were cheering sides as well).  In the end she makes her choice and has to live with the consequences...or does she?I saw this movie on TCM on a night they were celebrating Van Johnson.

Geatz,"[13, 15]","Woody Allen has long admired the works of both Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini, and while he has done other movies that intentionally (and not very successfully, in my opinion) mimic those two great directors, I think ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" is his better homage to Fellini.  He captures the same poignant combination of humor and pathos as Fellini does in his earlier masterpieces ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria.""  In fact, the concluding scene of Cecilia (Mia Farrow) staring at the movie screen, her eyes transforming from despair to hope (as her life has just gone down the toilet) is a mirror of the concluding scene in Fellini's ""Cabiria.""  This is also Allen's most loving tribute to ""the movies."" Movies allow us to escape to a better world and--at least temporarily--to escape our selves. The cast is great--especially the wonderful supporting characters who seem right out of the Depression era, as are those who play the movie characters who get stranded on-screen when one of their colleagues steps out into the real world.

Add a perfectly cast Mia Farrow as a waif-like dreamer of a girl, living in the grinding poverty of the 1930's Depression and married to an blustering, brutal man.  Top it off with a brilliant dual performance by Jeff Daniels who is a cinematic film hero who steps out of the screen and the actor who plays this hooky playing fictional character.Cecilia (Mia Farrow) works as a waitress (on the verge of being fired).  Her life is grim, living in a tenement with her no-account husband (Danny Aiello).  Her one pleasure is the movies that she attends daily.  Her favorite is ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" and the explorer character ""Tom Baxter"" brings radiance to her eyes that never leave him.  After multiple viewings, one day ""Tom"" falters in his lines, seems distracted, then steps out of the film and joins Cecilia in the audience.  The cast and audience are suitably stunned; the cast enjoining him to get back on the screen so they can finish the movie, and the audience grumbling they didn't pay good money to watch the cast arguing among themselves.  ""Tom"" is resolute, and out they walk, he in his pith helmet and explorer togs, Cecilia radiant.  The movie industry is appalled. They worried about litigation and insurrection if characters start walking off the screen.  Gil Shepard, the actor who played""Tom"" is sent to the scene to talk ""Tom"" into getting back onscreen where he belongs.  ""Tom"" clearly is innocent of what the ""real"" (as opposed to ""reel"") world is about.  He is in love with Cecilia and she allows that he ""is the perfect man.  Of course, he's fictional.""  Real life ""Gil,"" Tom, and Cecilia meet. The ending is surprisingly intense.Jeff Daniels is dazzling as Gil/Tom. He handles both roles to perfection.  The interaction among Daniels, Farrow, and Aiello is flawless.  Much as I wanted to thoroughly despise Aiello as the low-life husband, he managed to make me laugh and feel sorry for him with his bravado performance.  All the jokes and humor work in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" which isn't the case in many Allen movies.  I believe this is Woody Allen's valentine to his beloved movies.  It couldn't be better.

Her husband Monk (Danny Aiello)is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and Cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent. The only escape that Cecilia has is going to the movies--the fantasy world of Hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world.

He says he's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except Cecilia's sister cares about.

Allen hasn't done commentary tracks are allowed extras on his releases which is too bad as there's cut footage of Viggo Mortensen and Michael Keaton (who was originally cast in the lead instead of Daniels)that would be of interest. I don't know if that footage still exists but if it did it would make a lovely addition to this. Why MGM didn't choose to include archieved footage of Allen talking about the film and new interviews with the stars is beyond me.
