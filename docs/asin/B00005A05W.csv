The Metabolic Booster workout is amazing though. It's a great mix of stretching, light weights, and balance/posture moves that moves fast enough to keep me interested.

It's nice to be guided through postures but she doesn't shut up.  She also takes atleast five minutes of each segment and tells you how to breathe.  It felt like a Lamaze class.  The first segment is Core Conditioning.  It concentrates on your abs and lower spine.  It's not half bad and she does explain things nicely, which is good if you've never done Pilates.The second segment, Metabolic Booster, is ridiculous.  She's jumping and dancing all over the place.  You'd have to watch it quite a few times to get the moves down.  The last segment, Rejuvination, is based on yoga.  Again, she babbles on for about five minutes then finally takes you through a few common postures.

I watched most of it before I started so I could get an idea of what was involved, and that helped (although I am so uncoordinated I still don't have the middle segment down yet).The first section is a classic Pilates routine with some yoga interspersed in the middle.  Yes, you feel it in your abs right when she says your going to.  I like that she shows modifications but also encourages you to challenge yourself.  I probably benefited from learning first with the Ana Caban tapes, but I was able to keep up and try some new things.  I think Jennifer's roll-up variation with the feet flexed is more challenging that with the toes pointed, but I'm going to play around and see which feels best.  The neck pull was a surprise, but I was glad she had some different exercises in there.The Metabolic Booster section was my favorite.  When I first watched it I thought ""Oh, this will be fine- will it get my heart rate up enough?""  Well, yes it did!  The moves are so pretty and graceful (although of course I'm still learning to get all of the steps down) that you don't really you're working your butt- or should I say glutes?- off.  Again, when she says you should feel this in your glutes, you will.  I love this part!The Rejuvenation section was a great way to end the workout.  I don't know if it's Jennifer's extra dose of inspiration or if the other two workouts just loosened me up, but I definitely felt my hamstrings loosen up.  For me, that's huge.  I'm pretty flexible (except for the hamstrings) and I've been doing yoga for a while, so I didn't need most of the modifications she introduced, but they didn't bother me, either.Again, this is a great workout- I recommend it to anyone who wants a total body workout but wants a softer (though not slower) pace.Perfect!",5,It IS perfect!,1001635200,"09 28, 2001",2001,1824,"['[', ']', 'what', 'great', 'workout', 'delivered', 'watched', 'most', 'started', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'involved', 'helped', 'am', 'so', 'uncoordinated', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'middle', 'segment', 'down', 'yet', '.The', 'first', 'section', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'routine', 'yoga', 'interspersed', 'middle', 'Yes', 'feel', 'abs', 'right', 'when', 'going', 'like', 'modifications', 'also', 'challenge', 'probably', 'benefited', 'learning', 'first', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'tapes', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'roll-up', 'variation', 'feet', 'flexed', 'more', 'challenging', 'toes', 'pointed', ""'m"", 'going', 'play', 'around', 'see', 'best', 'neck', 'pull', 'was', 'surprise', 'was', 'glad', 'had', 'different', 'exercises', 'there.The', 'Metabolic', 'Booster', 'section', 'was', 'favorite', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'thought', 'Oh', 'will', 'be', 'fine-', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'enough', 'Well', 'did', 'moves', 'are', 'so', 'pretty', 'graceful', 'course', ""'m"", 'still', 'learning', 'get', 'steps', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', ""'re"", 'working', 'butt-', 'should', 'say', 'glutes', 'off', 'Again', 'when', 'should', 'feel', 'glutes', 'will', 'love', 'part', 'Rejuvenation', 'section', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Jennifer', 'extra', 'dose', 'inspiration', 'other', 'two', 'workouts', 'just', 'loosened', 'up', 'definitely', 'felt', 'hamstrings', 'loosen', 'up', 'huge', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'flexible', 'hamstrings', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'while', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'most', 'modifications', 'introduced', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'either.Again', 'great', 'workout-', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'softer', 'not', 'slower', 'pace.Perfect']",New Method - Perfect Mix VHS

575602,A2F7UCDYPS7YBA,B00005A05W,Michelle Lee,"[18, 21]","I tried this Pilates DVD, going on a suggestion from a friend that Pilates was the way to go. It focuses a lot on isometric exercises (which I love...see my review for ""Callanetics"") and core control. However, this DVD was not what I was expecting it to be.Granted, I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, as well as one of those ""freakishly flexible"" people that the Amazon editors call Jennifer Kries, so my review may be biased for the already-in-shape exerciser.  However, this DVD doesn't do as much as it could.The core conditioning segment focuses on the abdomen and somewhat on the back. Here, I would strongly highlight the Amazon editor's comment about Kries not doing a lot of reps of each exercise. She doesn't. She does maybe 8 and stops. You do feel it in your abs, and then all of a sudden, the workout is over!  Kind of frustrating for someone who likes ab exercises.  If you are a beginner, you will probably find these exercises challenging.  Most are traditional Pilates maneuvers, and each can be modifed to the difficulty level you wish.The metabolic booster section, meant to be a cardio workout, was more of an exercise in awkward choreography. If you had bad knees AVOID THIS SECTION OF THE VIDEO. She does a lot of lunges, with weights no less, and twisting...you're basically asking for a torn knee ligament.I admit that Jennifer Kries is a very empathic instructor, and her style is very gentle and encouraging.  It's a good start for a beginner, but if you're in decent shape and are looking for an alternative to a complete body toning workout, this is probably not the DVD for you.

575603,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005A05W,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[13, 13]","Jennifer Kries is definitely the Pilates goddess of the workout video/DVD world. Not only does she create challenging Pilates workouts, she gives perfect instruction and teaches you to respect your body in a new way. This is her New Method style workout. It is a combination of Pilates, Weight Training, Dance and Yoga.Workout 1 - Core Conditioning - Classic Pilates routine and Yoga moves. You will recognize all the basic Pilates moves with the roll-ups and modified roll-ups. Jennifer gives a lot of advice on modifying, but I just have to say that I have my own secret ways for getting from the flat-on-back position to the bending over one's legs position. I'm not sure she would approve. While Jennifer shows each position, she gives even more ""breathing"" instructions. I love ""rolling like a ball"" and the challenge of making each exercise so precise.Workout 2 - Metabolic Booster - Light weight training segment to increase cardiovascular strength. I love this almost ""dance-style"" workout. Jennifer is working out with four workout partners/instructors. The music is motivational, the colors are inspirational and the setting is so classic. You flow through the stretches like a dancer and then learn to get fancy with the weights. You are moving fairly fast so it is advisable to really learn the moves before increasing your speed. I found that once I was distracted by anything, I had to refocus, rewind and begin again. This is the most challenging weight workout I've ever done. Not only does this push you to the limit of your coordination, you are also moving in a very creative way. I love this section because it will be one I will be perfecting for months. Your arms will feel toned and the addition of the weights also helps you burn extra calories during the cardiovascular moments.Workout 3 - AM/PM Rejuvenation - Yoga-based workout to release tension and promotes flexibility. You will recognize all the basic yoga moves and there are a few variations with an added dose of creative appeal.Breath of Fire is an exercise I've recently seen in many yoga workouts. Jennifer almost seems to relax into this workout, although she is still just as precise. Her personality comes across especially well in the newer videos. She not only talks the viewer through the exercises, she is very comfortable with the entire process.I like the way you can actually hear Jennifer breathing in various exercises, it reminds you to breathe! She teaches some breathing techniques I've been seeing in a number of yoga workouts. It only took me about three videos to get that breathing technique under control. Ironically, the secret is to let go of control.This workout is the most challenging Jennifer Kries workout I've ever completed. If you do all three workouts one after the other, there is no need to do any cardiovascular work before starting this routine. Normally, I'd suggest walking for about 30-40 minutes, but with this workout, you don't need any additional exercise. You will strengthen and tone your entire body in 60 minutes. ""Perfect Mix"" has all the elements of a full-body workout and stretch. I noticed immediate results in how toned my body felt and also in my posture. Jennifer has the perfect body and now we know why. It takes intense determination and when you do this workout over a short period of time, you will almost become addicted to the demanding aspects.Intermediate to Advanced.The workout you need to move into an entirely new realm of fitness. If you have working out for a few years and want to test your strength, ""Perfect Mix"" will invigorate and energize you.

It gave me a headache!  The sound is also bad.  At times it sounds like she is talking into a cup.  Also, the Pilates segment has no music until halfway through.But it's not just that.  She spends a lot of time sitting and talking about the moves you are going to do.  This is great - the first couple times you do it.
