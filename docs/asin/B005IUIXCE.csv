1461962,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B005IUIXCE,,"[0, 0]","13 is a remake of a French film,13 Tzameti(which I haven't yet seen), about a particularly extreme gambling ring where rich folk sponsor and place bets on a russian roulette tournament.  It stars Sam Riley as a broke electrician with a sick father in the hospital who overhears an employer's cryptic claims of a big payday.  When the employer overdoes a fix of heroine, the down-on-his-luck handyman takes the instructions to attempt to claim the payday in his place, but has no idea what he just signed up for.The film boasts an impressive cast of real and fictional tough guys like Jason Statham (whose character springs his own brother, played by Ray Winstone, from a mental ward to enter him in the competition), 50 Cent, Alexander Skarsgard (of True Blood fame), and the incomparable Mickey Rourke with cameos from MMA stars Don Frye and Forrest Griffin.  The core of the film naturally centers around the abject intensity of the tourney itself, and everyone (except maybe Fiddy) does a really great job of acting their part as either awed spectator or terrified contestant.  The high stakes gambling/entertainment thing has been done before, but the fact that the game of choice involves people shooting each other in the head, but not knowing who's going to get a live round makes for some serious tension in the moments leading up to the big splash.  My wife literally covered her face, which is unusual for her. I felt the shots of the crowd in these parts were particularly effective. But the film doesn't take the easy way out and quit after the climax either, as the winner still has to face getting away with his winnings as a man who has already fallen off the face of the earth, which leads to a pretty stunning conclusion that puts an average premise a cut above the rest.  I'll spare you the obvious gambling/entertainment/evil rich people allegory breakdown....this time.I can't give the film full credit to since it is an American rip-off of a fairly recent foreign film (kind of a pet peeve of mine), but I can't say it's a bad one either.  Having not seen the original I can't compare the two, but on general principle, I'd recommend seeing the original if you have a choice.  I'd recommend 13 to anybody looking for a decent thriller that isn't afraid to turn the heat up past PG-13 with a cool cast (and one bad rapper in it) and lots of testosterone.  It isn't going to set your world on fire, but it'll be 90 minutes well spent.3 1/2 stars rounded up for solid execution (so to speak).",4,A man's sport,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,2510,"['13', 'remake', 'French', 'film,13', 'Tzameti', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'particularly', 'extreme', 'gambling', 'ring', 'where', 'rich', 'folk', 'sponsor', 'place', 'bets', 'russian', 'roulette', 'tournament', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'broke', 'electrician', 'sick', 'father', 'hospital', 'who', 'employer', 'cryptic', 'claims', 'big', 'payday', 'When', 'employer', 'fix', 'heroine', 'down-on-his-luck', 'handyman', 'instructions', 'attempt', 'claim', 'payday', 'place', 'idea', 'what', 'just', 'signed', 'up', 'for.The', 'film', 'impressive', 'cast', 'real', 'fictional', 'tough', 'guys', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'character', 'own', 'brother', 'played', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'mental', 'ward', 'enter', 'competition', '50', 'Cent', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'True', 'Blood', 'fame', 'incomparable', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'cameos', 'MMA', 'stars', 'Don', 'Frye', 'Forrest', 'Griffin', 'core', 'film', 'naturally', 'centers', 'abject', 'intensity', 'tourney', 'everyone', 'maybe', 'Fiddy', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'part', 'awed', 'spectator', 'terrified', 'contestant', 'high', 'stakes', 'gambling/entertainment', 'thing', 'been', 'done', 'fact', 'game', 'choice', 'people', 'shooting', 'other', 'head', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'going', 'get', 'live', 'round', 'serious', 'tension', 'moments', 'leading', 'up', 'big', 'splash', 'wife', 'literally', 'covered', 'face', 'unusual', 'felt', 'shots', 'crowd', 'parts', 'were', 'particularly', 'effective', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'quit', 'climax', 'either', 'winner', 'still', 'face', 'getting', 'away', 'winnings', 'man', 'who', 'already', 'fallen', 'off', 'face', 'earth', 'pretty', 'stunning', 'conclusion', 'average', 'premise', 'cut', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'obvious', 'gambling/entertainment/evil', 'rich', 'people', 'allegory', 'breakdown', '.this', 'time.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'full', 'credit', 'American', 'rip-off', 'fairly', 'recent', 'foreign', 'film', 'kind', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'one', 'either', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'general', 'principle', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'seeing', 'original', 'have', 'choice', ""'d"", 'recommend', '13', 'anybody', 'looking', 'decent', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'turn', 'heat', 'up', 'PG-13', 'cool', 'cast', 'one', 'bad', 'rapper', 'lots', 'testosterone', ""n't"", 'going', 'set', 'world', 'fire', ""'ll"", 'be', '90', 'minutes', 'well', 'spent.3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'solid', 'execution', 'so', 'speak']",13

Jason Statham's presence would indicate a fast-paced action thriller like CRANK but 13 is neither fast paced nor action-packed.  It's a dark rather gloomy psychodrama focusing on a gentlemen's club who stage Russian roulette competitions to make millions of dollars by betting on the outcome.  A chance eavesdropping brings young Sam Riley into the fray.  Riley's father needs costly surgery and he sees the contest as a way to get the money.  Riley then becomes the movie's hero as his killings are justified in a Robin Hood sort of way.  Statham plays a small-time hood who enters his mentally ill brother (Ray Winstone) in the contest and Mickey Rourke is an imprisoned con offered a chance of freedom.  Rounding out the cast is 50 Cent, Alexander Skaarsgard and Ben Gazzara as promoters and Michael Shannon as the strangest emcee since CABARET's Joel Grey.The main problem with 13 is its slow pacing, and the lack of a moral focus.

For some reason they gave Stathams brother's character(Winstone) some filling out as we are first introduced to him as just another participant.Then there's a flashback as to where he came from and how he got there,and it shows the tension between the two brothers.And that ending of Statham steeling away with what he thinks is Riley's winnings,leaves one scratching ones head.Statham disappears through the other end of the tunnel and the camera just hangs there watching for about 10 seconds.....then it suddenly fades to black.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There is a featurette and interviews.But for the most part,what is in the interviews is in the featurette!Kind of a waste of space,if you ask me.All in all an uneven film with its premise,of men being either willing or unwilling participants in a human ring of Russian roulette,being a very disturbing one indeed.The film makes no apologies for it and as a viewer I can accept it.I think my criticism here lies in just HOW the story was told and executed,one might say.",3,A disturbing yet unsatisfying film,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,4891,"['13', 'released', 'Oct/11',

The world of Russian Roulette is deadly as depicted by the film, but the fact that Vince, the main character, seems to just fall into it more or less accept it by the end is unrealistic in many ways.  I have not seen the original, but I am tempted to in order to find out if it is in fact better and the problem lies in translation because 13 just did not do it for me.

He has no idea what he's walking into, and the scheme turns out to be much more dangerous than he ever anticipated. Shrouded in secrecy and set up for the amusement of bored, wealthy men, a deadly competition pits desperate man against desperate man. Vince quickly moves from a young man with noble intentions for his family to a frantic man trying to keep his life.I'm fascinated by the premise of this story. It is so stunning and chilling in its simplicity. I'm also a big, big fan of Jason Statham and have to admit that his name alone compelled me to grab this DVD before even reading the synopsis. Unfortunately, the execution (no pun intended) of this plot leaves a lot to be desired. I am willing to sit through nearly any movie and see it through to the end because I'm always convinced that once I quit a movie, *that's* when it will get good. That's not the case here. I was so bored within the first 25 minutes that I really wanted to give up on watching this one. The dialogue is weak, the characters are one-dimensional, and this fantastic cast is wasted. Rourke is reduced to a caricature. And, by the way, where's the suspense in this suspense thriller?When I first came across this title, I was amazed that I hadn't heard of the movie. A Jason Statham flick that escaped my attention? How could this be? After watching it, I wish I had remained in the dark as to its existence. I will, however, check out the original version. The Swedes have been putting out some stunning films, and I'm willing to bet that the original version will erase the dull image of this flat remake.",2,"Great cast, great premise, not-so-great delivery",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2113,"['Give', 'dark', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'day', 'week', 'Fill', 'interesting', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', '50', 'Cent', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'even', 'better', 'right', 'case', 'formula', 'flat.Vince', 'down-on-his', 'luck', 'electrician', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'family', 'when', 'potential', 'get-rich-quick', 'scheme', 'father', 'hospital', 'awaiting', 'very', 'pricey', 'medical', 'procedures', 'family', 'verge', 'homelessness', 'Vince', 'plunge', 'what', 'idea', 'what', 'walking', 'scheme', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'ever', 'anticipated', 'Shrouded', 'secrecy', 'set', 'up', 'amusement', 'bored', 'wealthy', 'men', 'deadly', 'competition', 'pits', 'desperate', 'man', 'desperate', 'man', 'Vince', 'quickly', 'young', 'man', 'noble', 'intentions', 'family', 'frantic', 'man', 'trying', 'keep', 'life.I', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'premise', 'story', 'so', 'stunning', 'chilling', 'simplicity', ""'m"", 'also', 'big', 'big', 'fan', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'have', 'admit', 'name', 'alone', 'compelled', 'grab', 'DVD', 'even', 'reading', 'synopsis', 'Unfortunately', 'execution', 'pun', 'intended', 'plot', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'am', 'willing', 'sit', 'nearly', 'movie', 'see', 'end', ""'m"", 'always', 'convinced', 'once', 'quit', 'movie', ""*that's*"", 'when', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'first', '25', 'minutes', 'really', 'wanted', 'give', 'up', 'watching', 'one', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'wasted', 'Rourke', 'reduced', 'caricature', 'way', 'where', 'suspense', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'When', 'first', 'came', 'title', 'was', 'amazed', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'flick', 'escaped', 'attention', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'wish', 'had', 'remained', 'dark', 'existence', 'will', 'however', 'check', 'out', 'original', 'version', 'Swedes', 'have', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'stunning', 'films', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'original', 'version', 'will', 'erase', 'dull', 'image', 'flat', 'remake']",13

He is an electrician who has a family who is in debt.  At a work site, he overhears a conversation concerning a illegal ""job"" that can pay huge.  The person involved in the conversation who is going to take this ""job"" ends up dying of a drug overdose, so Riley decides to show up in his place to do the ""job.""  The clandestine ""job"" turns out to be a russian roulette game.  There is only one winner out of thirteen, so he decides to hold it out-he can't back out anyway-to see if he can get his family out of debt.The setting in the midwest effects the film in a negative way.  This is a remake of a film set in Paris entitled "" 13 Tzameti"".  Why not set this movie in New York, or Los Angeles California-I think that would have been more realistic.This film was intense, but I was not as scared during the screnes of roulette playing as I thought I should be.  This was probably due to a lack of character developement.  This movie has a huge cast-Ray Winstone, ""50 Cent"" Curtis Jackson, Mickey Rourke, Jason Statham,Alexander Skarsgard, etc.-but they are not given a whole lot to do.  We only know the motivation of Sam Riley to play roulette, not the others.  Unfortunately, I also did not really like any of the characters either-they all seemed creepy and looked menacing most of the time.  Yes, I realize this is a thriller, however, character developement and good acting always help the plot along.

The bulk of the movie had all of the characters, from the cops to the contestants, from the high stakes betters to the money counters mostly dressed in black and white.  It surely set the mood for the dire consequences of this movie.The basic premise is that desperate contestants who will do anything for money are invited to a game of Russian Roulette played at night in an ominous mansion where they've been routed by complex directions.  The last man standing is in for a lucrative payday; in this case Vince, played by Sam Riley, can pay for his father's much needed operation.  The film is filled with talented stars, among them: Ray Winstone, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Mickey Rourke and Jason Statham.  Each carries his roll well.  There are lots of odd camera angles which actually add to the plot.Only a few of the players had any biographical background disclosed.

1461974,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B005IUIXCE,,"[0, 0]","**May contain some spoilers.**Plot: A young electrician needs cash to help his family. As the medical bills pile up, Vince (AKA #13), played by Sam Riley, believes that stealing a man's identity (one who overdoses) and attending an event that will pay him millions, is the only solution to his problems. As he sets out to discover what the dead guy was willing to do to make money, Vince finds himself entrenched in a world that he never imagined. His number (aptly #13) is symbolic of his journey. What is he willing to risk to win the ultimate prize?What worked:(1) The concept behind the movie. While I did not know that this was a remake, I liked the underlying theme that there are some in our society (in this case the rich and privileged) who look to other venues to entertain themselves even if it is this version of a barbaric and meaningless sport (this version of Russian Roulette. So it is no surprise when Vince finds himself involved in a game of life or death. Participants must stand in a circle, load their weapons (with one bullet), spin the chamber and pull the trigger (which is pointing at the head of a fellow contestant). As the bodies fall, the number of bullets are increased and the suspense mounts. Who will be the last man standing. This movie definitely makes you evaluate human nature and reminded me of some of those movies I have seen in the past (with a similar premise) where actual humans (instead of animals) are being hunted for sport and entertainment. You ponder the issue of how would the prospect of winning tons of money weigh in your mind when considering the cost of a human life, even if it is yours. In the end would cold hard cash and the thrill of it all be more persuasive than your humanity and compassion. On the other hand, you may simply look at Vince's dilemma as he did and ask yourself what wouldn't you do for your family?(2) The imagery and tone. What else could symbolize the issue more than have this ""Russian Roulette Club"" meeting in an old mansion? Men risking their lives while surrounded with the trappings of wealth, something they all desire. And in the mist of all that wealth (men dressed to the nines and an opulent setting), there is still a dark underbelly....signified by the single light bulb with the spider drawn on it, and the undercurrent of betrayal and perhaps even simply madness. I simply loved the dark atmosphere and pulp noir/crime noir feel of the movie. It offered foreboding and sense of gloom that settled on the story like a second skin.(3) The symbolism. Not only is the entire movie symbolic, but the participant Vince (AKA #13) is as well. While most people fear that the number 13 is bad luck, you cheer and hope that it will be the opposite for Vince.(4) The cast. There were some pretty decent actors in the movie. The problem is that they never really peaked, although that may be just the point. They were all good, but none of them you really invested in with the exception of maybe the main character, Sam Riley (#13). You cheered for him and hoped that it would all end well.What didn't necessarily work:(1)While the cast was stuffed full of talent (the sexy Alexander Skargard, the talented Mickey Rourke, the brooding Jason Statham, the calculating Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson), none of them stood out in the crowd. Most were in the same roles that they always play, so really you did not form an attachment with any of them. Watching them in this movie was like watching in others during their career: Skargard from True Blood broods in a sexy way; ""50 Cents"" comes across as the sophisticated hoodlum;  Rourke manages to always seem reckless, fearless and daring. To be honest, there were no real standouts with the exception of Riley, and maybe that was because he was an unknown to me. I have never seen him in a film that I can remember. So his innocence and sincerity made him endearing and likeable. Otherwise, I thought that the actors, with some additional material could have really shined even those who were acting in supporting roles.(2) And finally there was something missing. I can't put my hand on it, but something was lacking. Maybe because I was expecting a little ""more"" when I saw the actors involved, and read the plot, but it didn't deliver. I mean in terms of surprises or unresolved issues there were none. It was pretty cut and dry. And while this isn't always a bad thing, I wanted a little more and even found myself (when the movie was fading into black) asking myself was that it?Overall ""13"" was a solid 3. There was a captivating premise, some decent actors and decent imagery.  And while there was ""something"" missing (and I can't figure out what it is), I don't regret the almost 2 hours I spent viewing of it.

Except for the main character, who has no idea what he's gotten himself into, all the rest know exactly what they're doing - including the guy who is risking his own brother's life just to make a ""killing"".  The thing about this ""game"" that I don't get is - it's based completely on chance.  The way it's set up, there's no skill involved at all, just blind luck.  They could just as well be flipping a coin or throwing dice and they'd probably come out with the same outcomes as far as the betting goes.  But then no one would die, so the real point of all this must be the entertainment of watching men kill each other in a random haphazard game.  Heh, I meant to write a fairly positive review when I started this - because the movie is actually put together pretty well.  The ending does pay off the premise.  While I've kind of rambled on about the pointlessness of the game, the movie does have a point at the end.  But if I tell you that, it will give away too much - so you'll just have to see it for yourself.  Just be prepared to sit through the middle half of the movie asking yourself...

1461979,A84FLVDK2R5JF,B005IUIXCE,,"[0, 0]","The film 13 is a type of Russian roulette for American audiences. There's a decent amount of star power and established actors collected for this, at times, drama, and those new to the premise might find themselves drawn into this foul underworld saga.An electrician watching his family slide into crippling debt, Vince (Sam Riley) finds his curiosity elevated when he spies a client dealing with secretive materials in his house, talking about large paydays for taking part in a ""game."" When the homeowner dies, Vince steals the information, taking the man's place in the enigmatic scheme, following strict instructions that bring him into the lower levels of a remote mansion. Branded ""13,"" Vince finds himself caught up in a secret society that permits the wealthy and connected to bet on the lives of strangers, using brutal matches of Russian roulette that pit these 13 men against one another, some by choice (Ray Winstone), others by force (Mickey Rourke). With the moneymen (including Jason Statham and Ben Gazzara) calling the shots, Vince learns there is no escape, coerced into playing until the last man stands.To the director's credit he doesn't inflate the material to blockbuster standards, keeping ""13"" low to the ground in terms of execution. It's a hard-edged premise that doesn't need over-the-top razzle-dazzle to connect with the viewer, best communicated through panicked close-ups and icy stares, using the dire ambiance of the game room to fuel the suspense. The film actually does a commendable job finding a macabre rhythm, utilizing the mysteries of the opening act to shape Vince's curiosity and desperation, finding the clueless young man committing to a threatening offer and its numerous security checkpoints without knowledge of what's to come. The director regrettably attempts to jumpstart the nightmare with a pointless flash-forward before the film begins (revealing Vince's ultimate level of competition), but the creep of the situation remains strong in the early going, producing interest in seeing what happens next.The gaming sequences form the core of the picture, taking viewers to the brink of madness as the players are arranged in a circular formation, each with a loaded gun pointed at the brain stem of the man in front of them. It's a startling scenario, milked well by the cast, including Michael Shannon as the master of ceremonies, perched high on a ladder, barking orders to the players as though possessed by the Devil himself. The violence is minimal, yet the build-up to the trigger pulls is unrelenting, isolating the fear factor of assured doom, with Vince, the newcomer to the game, unsure of his willingness to participate. Though familiar in design, the Russian roulette events retain their primitive sense of horror, establishing substantial tension for the midsection of the movie.""13"" is an icy film, and it seems like the director felt the need to inject some emotional texture into the piece, making Vince a whimpering victim of the lousy economy, while gambler Jasper (Statham) prods his mentally ill brother (Winstone) into defending his title, creating an irritable family dynamic. Characters never blossom, but performances by Riley and Winstone carry a passable weight, while the supporting cast is permitted brief blasts of personality. Color by Rourke and Gazzara is welcome, but there's also Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in the mix, playing a member of the onlookers, furthering his reputation as one of the worst actors in the business today. Thankfully, his screen time is limited.Given the quiet way it came and went from theaters it isn't surprising that the DVD has nothing to offer in the way of features, other than looking good through a HDTV.The bleak space of Russian roulette is exactly where ""13"" should remain, yet the film feels the need to extend beyond the game to sniff out more of a conventional resolution. Its material best suited for blunt shocks, not tired thriller elements, stumbling to find a sickening closing irony in a story that lacks the final one-two punch to bring it home.

Even his family isn't particularly endearing.  Along the way you meet the supporting characters behind each of the competitors, and none of them give the viewer any real reason to root for them.

1461992,A3PE884TA8529G,B005IUIXCE,,"[0, 1]","There are few movies that I do not like.  I can sit and watch a chick flick like Notting Hill or Bridemaids and love it and then I can turn around and watch the Expendables and cheer with a Budweiser in hand.  I can see beauty in most stories told on stage and screen.  However, I just did not really feel it with this movie.I had not seen the original of this movie and I was unaware that this was any sort of remake until I read the Amazon product review page.  For the most part, the story line was ""original"" to me.  The story is of an electrician whose father is in dire need of surgery.  The movie opens with him trying to figure out how they will pay for the surgery.  While on a job, the electrician, Vince Ferro, overhears the homeowner talking about making a large sum of money quickly.  The homeowner dies and Vince steals the message and takes the homeowners place.  He then find himself in an underground Russian Roulette game where the wealthy bring their ""players"" to the arena and bet on who will be left standing in the end.Personally, I thought the story line at the beginning and the end of the movie were quite terrible.  To me, the whole dying father thing really did not add to the movie at all.  As a matter of fact, it reminded me a lot of an old Tales from the Crypt episode (Easel Kill Ya) about what a starving artist would do for money, especially as his lover falls victim to an accident and he needs big bucks to pay for the surgery.  The story does add in part to the desperation of the main character, but it is just not a compelling part of the story.I did find the middle of the movie quite intriguing.  I found the Russian Roulette tournament quite interesting.  It was a good mix of decent acting, a fairly interesting storyline, decent use of flashbacks to let us know a little about many of the main characters, and good old fashion blood and violence.  This portion of the movie did have its drawbacks.  I do not bet on sporting events (or Russian Roulette tournaments for that matter).  While it showed the interactions of the people betting on the players and the managers of the players, I had no idea of what they were really talking about.  I got the sense that they were betting on winners and losers and it seemed that they were ""trading"" players somehow, but even after watching the movie three times, I still did not get a sense of what was going on behind the scenes in the betting rooms and the deals between managers.  Also, there is little character development in this portion of the move (or most of the movie in general).  Most of the main characters are referred to by numbers.  After watching the movie several times, I knew some of the main characters, most of them I knew by number only.The ending of the movie was a typical chase the good guy down and steal his money plot, except it went a lot slower with much less excitement.  It was about as exciting as watching a car chase involving golf carts.  Personally, I think they could of just ended the film after the tournament completed and I think it would have been a better movie.Overall, this is far from a standout movie.  The cast is great and there are moments of great acting.  I thought Michael Shannon as the ""arena master"" was a great bit of acting, even though the character was pretty insignificant.  50 Cent also had a small, insignificant part which I thought he did a good job with, given the lack of depth of the character.  Sam Riley did have a few good moments in the movie, but for the most part I felt his acting made the character unbelievable and overall I thought it was a poor performance.  I thought Jason Statham was the standout character of the movie with Mickey Rourke being second.  Despite a few good moments of acting in the movie, those moments with the story line just did not meld together at all to make a good flick.This is one of those movies I would recommend you rent unless you can get it for a few bucks.  I think this could have been a good movie, but the pieces just did not fit together that well.  After everything was said and done, you are left with a finish product that just was not appealing.  I am giving the movie 2 stars as I thought one third of the movie was worthy of 4 stars and the other two-thirds were worthy of 1 star, thus averaging it out it was a two star movie.  I would not go as far as to call it a waste of time, but if a friend borrowed my copy and never brought it back, I would not even bother asking them to return it.",2,"Two-thirds Boring As Can Be, One-Third Decent Movie",1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,4502,"['are', 'few', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'can', 'sit', 'watch', 'chick', 'flick', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Bridemaids', 'love', 'then', 'can', 'turn', 'around', 'watch', 'Expendables', 'cheer', 'Budweiser', 'hand', 'can', 'see', 'beauty', 'most', 'stories', 'told', 'stage', 'screen', 'However', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'feel', 'movie.I', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'unaware', 'was', 'sort', 'remake', 'read', 'Amazon', 'product', 'review', 'page', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'original', 'story', 'electrician', 'father', 'dire', 'need', 'surgery', 'movie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'pay', 'surgery', 'job', 'electrician', 'Vince', 'Ferro', 'homeowner', 'talking', 'making', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'quickly', 'homeowner', 'dies', 'Vince', 'steals', 'message', 'homeowners', 'place', 'then', 'find', 'underground', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'game', 'where', 'wealthy', 'bring', 'players', 'arena', 'bet', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'standing', 'end.Personally', 'thought', 'story', 'line', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'were', 'quite', 'terrible', 'whole', 'dying', 'father', 'thing', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'movie', 'matter', 'fact', 'reminded', 'lot', 'old', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'episode', 'Easel', 'Kill', 'Ya', 'what', 'starving', 'artist', 'would', 'do', 'money', 'especially', 'lover', 'victim', 'accident', 'big', 'bucks', 'pay', 'surgery', 'story', 'add', 'part', 'desperation', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'not', 'compelling', 'part', 'story.I', 'did', 'find', 'middle', 'movie', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'found', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'tournament', 'quite', 'interesting', 'was', 'good', 'mix', 'decent', 'acting', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'decent', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'let', 'know', 'little', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'blood', 'violence', 'portion', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'drawbacks', 'do', 'not', 'bet', 'sporting', 'events', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'tournaments', 'matter', 'showed', 'interactions', 'people', 'betting', 'players', 'managers', 'players', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'were', 'really', 'talking', 'got', 'sense', 'were', 'betting', 'winners', 'losers', 'seemed', 'were', 'trading', 'players', 'somehow', 'even', 'watching', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scenes', 'betting', 'rooms', 'deals', 'managers', 'Also', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'portion', 'move', 'most', 'movie', 'general', 'Most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'referred', 'numbers', 'watching', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'knew', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'knew', 'number', 'only.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'typical', 'chase', 'good', 'guy', 'down', 'steal', 'money', 'plot', 'went', 'lot', 'slower', 'much', 'less', 'excitement', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'exciting', 'watching', 'car', 'chase', 'involving', 'golf', 'carts', 'Personally', 'think', 'could', 'just', 'ended', 'film', 'tournament', 'completed', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie.Overall', 'far', 'standout', 'movie', 'cast', 'great', 'are', 'moments', 'great', 'acting', 'thought', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'arena', 'master', 'was', 'great', 'bit', 'acting', 'even', 'character', 'was', 'pretty', 'insignificant', '50', 'Cent', 'also', 'had', 'small', 'insignificant', 'part', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'given', 'lack', 'depth', 'character', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'acting', 'made', 'character', 'unbelievable', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'poor', 'performance', 'thought', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'was', 'standout', 'character', 'movie', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'being', 'second', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'acting', 'movie', 'moments', 'story', 'line', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'meld', 'together', 'make', 'good', 'flick.This', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'recommend', 'rent', 'can', 'get', 'few', 'bucks', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'pieces', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'together', 'well', 'everything', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'are', 'left', 'finish', 'product', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'appealing', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'thought', 'one', 'third', 'movie', 'was', 'worthy', '4', 'stars', 'other', 'two-thirds', 'were', 'worthy', '1', 'star', 'thus', 'averaging', 'was', 'two', 'star', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'waste', 'time', 'friend', 'borrowed', 'copy', 'never', 'brought', 'back', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'asking', 'return']",13

I was definitely not on the edge of my seat, even when guys had guns to each other's heads.Another complaint I have is I didn't really feel I knew much about most of the characters.  In many cases I didn't even know their names.  It took a little straining to remember the ""hero"" is named Vince, in large part because for 2/3 of the movie he's referred to as ""Number 13.""The reason for this is that Vince finds an invitation to a Russian roulette tournament.  The mechanics of this are a little hazy to me.  I think Vince is working at renovating this guy's house.  The guy overdoses on morphine after he gets the invitation.  Vince finds it and since he needs money for an operation for his dad (I think), he goes to New York to take the other guy's place.The tournament is held in a mansion (or something) out in the middle of nowhere.  I don't know how far you have to get from New York City for that.  There are at least 17 players.  Each one has essentially a sponsor.  I'm not really sure who Vince's was.  At the house we meet some of the other participants.  There's #17 (Mickey Rourke) who was in a Mexican prison before being smuggled into the US for the tournament.  He keeps telling his handler (50 Cent) that he knows where there's a large stash of money.  17 and his money really have no bearing on the overall plot.Vince's main rival is #6 Robert Lynn (Ray Winstone) who was in a mental institution until his brother Jasper (Jason Statham) signs him out to be in the tourney.  #6 has won the tourney a few times before.  For some reason, Jasper borrows 2 million from someone to gamble in the tourney on his brother.I think part of the reason I was never too excited is besides being located in a mansion--and not somewhere seedy like a back alley--is there are so many rules.  For the first two rounds everyone stands in a circle.  They're given a gun and one bullet.  They put the guns in the air and spin the chamber around at the behest of the referee who sits in a chair like a tennis umpire.  Then each player puts his gun at the head of the guy in front of him.  (They are all guys.)  When a light with spiders on it (why spiders? I don't know) goes on, they fire.  Some people die and others live.  For the next round, there are two bullets in the guns.  The final round features two players chosen at random to ""duel.""  They get three bullets in their guns.  If you can't guess who is chosen to duel they show you A) on the DVD back cover and B)A few minutes into the film.  So I guess that's another strike as it spoils a little of the drama.Anyway, with so many rules and everything so well-mannered (they even let the ""survivors"" go free!) it felt more like watching tennis than Russian roulette.  That and I didn't really know much about the important characters and a lot of characters weren't that important anyway, like #17.So this definitely could have been a better movie.  Maybe the original version was better; I might have to go look for it on Netflix or something.BTW, there were no extras on the copy I was given from the Vine newsletter.

1462002,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005IUIXCE,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Georgian writer G&eacute;la Babluani found such success in his film 13 Tzameti n 2005 that he decided to recreated the story, this time placing it in the United States. Co-writing this version with Gregory Pruss is the only aspect of this adaptation he shared.  The story is a tough one to watch, not unlike `Fight Club', but with higher stakes. It share how far gambling men will go to get their thrills, making cock fights seem very tame.  The game at hand is based on gathering quasi-desperate men (prisoners, men deeply in debt, criminals who have little to lose, etc), placing them in a room with tee shirts bearing numbers, giving them guns, placing them in a circle, and on the command of the master of ceremonies they are to fire their gun into the head of the person in front of them. A smarmy form of Russian roulette, at first each man's gun has one bullet in the chamber, but as the game goes on more bullets are placed and the game continues until there is one man left alive.  The gamblers place bets on the various numbered men and the stakes are high. This process is performed in a isolated meeting space and is closely scrutinized by detectives who seek to uncover the scheme and stop it.Vince (Sam M. Riley of `Control' and `Brighton Rock') is a young electrician whose father has been in an accident resulting in sever injuries that require multiple surgeries.  Vince's family must put their house up for sale to pay the expenses unless Vince can find a quicker way to make big money to pay the hospital and surgeons.  Quite by accident while doing an electrical job he over hears the house owner discuss a `job' that promises to pay a lot of money.  The man plans on doing the job, receives an envelope with instructions, but then shoots up heroin and dies of an overdose.  Vince helps the police who investigate, but before leaving the house Vince takes the envelope that contains instructions and a cell phone and a piece of bark with the number 13 printed on it.  Vince follows the instructions and ends up in a complex scheme - the ultimate result of which is the fact that he becomes #13 in the gambling game.  Others sequestered for the killer game include Mickey Rourke, Ray Winstone, and among those involved in the offensive debacle are Alexander Skarsgard, Ben Gazzara, and emcee Michael Shannon.  The ending of the film is a complete surprise and revealing even part of it would ruin the impact of the film.This is definitely not a film for the fainthearted.  That such a gruesome gambling scheme could exist is terrifying.  But the production and the acting and the grisly atmosphere is well worth the moviegoer's attention.

1462003,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005IUIXCE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 19]","A few years ago, I came across an odd little foreign film that I absolutely fell in love with named ""13 Tzameti.""  At the time, I had no clue what the movie was about and, without preconceived notions, I was fascinated by the dark and twisted tale that unraveled.  As a young man is drawn into a complicated and deadly underground battle for survival, the movie is rather stunning in its simplicity.  As a very low budget endeavor, it used its sparseness to great advantage.  Claustrophobic, tense, and unrelenting, the camera pushes up close and personal as the tension escalates throughout and it is truly a riveting and, at times, unsettling experience.  Its writer/director Gela Babluani has been given the opportunity to adapt his thrilling and award winning sensation (Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, Best Director at Venice Film Festival) into an English language version with a pretty impressive cast.  The resultant ""13"" lacks a bit of the intensity of its predecessor, and opening up the story doesn't necessarily serve the material well.  Also, its intriguing premise is a little harder to buy in an American Midwest setting, but the movie still has a visceral punch that a certain audience might enjoy.The movie stars Sam Riley (so great in Control) as an electrician whose family is in dire financial straits.  At a work site, he hears talk of a clandestine ""job"" that has the potential to pay huge.  When the person planning on attending the job dies of an overdose, Riley nabs the instructions and heads off to take his place.  He has no idea what is in store for him!  What he finds is a chilling sports contest in which people bet on life and death itself in increasingly challenging rounds.  He can't back out and there can be only one winner, and Riley has no choice but to try to make it to the end.  The testosterone fueled plot is headlined by some talented individuals--Mickey Rourke and Ray Winstone are fellow contestants, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson and Alexander Skarsgard are two of the contestant minders, Ben Gazzara and Jason Statham are financially invested, and Michael Shannon is the evening's intense emcee.  While it is a fantastic cast, though, no one (aside from Riley and maybe Statham) really has a lot to do.Herein lies the problem, Babluani tries to adapt his screenplay to accommodate this roster of actors.  So we get flashbacks and character development for peripheral and non-important characters.  Yes, now we get more of Mickey Rourke and 50 Cent, but this actually detracts from the central contest.  And that is the movie!  The contest is inescapable and the original movie put viewers on the front lines until the very end.  It was exquisitely uncomfortable in confining us in the small and deadly space.  But while I wasn't necessarily blown away by ""13,"" I still appreciated its unsavory premise.  The cast is quite good, even if underutilized, and it's not a movie you feel like you've seen a hundred times before.  Those expecting big action may have to look elsewhere, this plays more as a psychological thriller.  I suspect this movie might be a bit divisive--you could think it is outlandish and hate it or you could like it for its uniqueness.  I liked, but didn't love, ""13.""  But I do recommend it and, if you ever get the chance, check out the original as well for something a bit more harrowing.  About 3 1/2 stars.

This quick description promises what could be a Great Guy Movie.Unfortunately, the movie we're talking about is ""13,"" and it's pretty bad.For one thing, the movie has no idea whose story it's telling. For a movie with the aforementioned cast, you'd expect any one of them to make a compelling protagonist.  But the movie instead revolves around a young down-on-his-luck electrician named Vince (Sam Riley).  Odd jobs aren't enough for him to help his struggling family, and through a mix of coincidences and bad choices Vince finds himself a ""player"" in a demented game of Russian Roulette where various wealthy men wager millions on who will survive.The tournament is simplicity itself.  Each player gets a revolver and, in the first round, a single bullet is spun into a random chamber.  They stand in circle, each aiming at the fellow in front of them.  A light bulb goes off, and everyone shoots.  Survivors make the next round.  In the second round, two bullets are loaded, and so forth.  These scenes are surprisingly devoid of suspense or charm - due in no small part that we really don't care a whit about Vince, who's a pretty unsympathetic guy.""13"" has no idea what to do with its macho cast.  Alexander Skarsgard does little more than look concerned.  Mickey Rourke has a poorly-explained back story and does little more than grumble and flex.  Jason Statham has some good moments as the guy who's making millions entering his mentally-challenged brother (Ray Winstone) in these tournaments, but these two gifted actors are wasted as well.The story simply meanders.  One major character makes it through and is told, ""you can go.""  Apparently he does, because we never see him again.  In another scene, a man attempts to garrote a player when another man walks in.  ""Stop that!"" he barks, and the assassination attempt ceases, but apparently with no hard feelings because nothing comes of it.  Most characters have no back story, no motivation, no compelling reason to be in this life-or-death tourney . . . they are simply there because the half-baked screenplay requires them to be.Hollywood has a long if not proud history of milking the ""tournament of death"" sub-genre of action movies.  Some of these can be quite good - such as ""The Quick and the Dead,"" ""Gladiator,"" etc.  These movies give their characters just enough back story to justify their role in such an insane contest and they have more than a ibt of sly fun with the whole thing.  They can be great guilty pleasures.

1462010,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B005IUIXCE,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[1, 1]","""13"" is the first movie, I can recall, since ""The Deer Hunter"" that uses Russian roulette as a plot device.  I would go out on a limb and say that ""13"" utilizes Russian roulette even more than ""The Deer Hunter"" did.  Therefore, I found this movie to have a very unique and different vibe about it.  I found it to be very intense and extremely well acted.  Unfortunately, certain aspects of this film keep it hostage from being an amazing motion picture.The plot is somewhat basic; Vince (Sam Riley) and his family have hit hard times with money.  His father is in the hospital for a reason that is never disclosed (a textbook MacGuffin) and needs various operations to get him back on his feet.  Since the family has exhausted all their options, Vince ends up taking extreme measures to aid his family.  Using the ruse of paraphrasing, Vince blindly uses someone else's identity believing it will bring him some quick money.  However, Vince finds himself being player number ""13"" in an underground gambling circuit in a round robin style game of Russian roulette.There a couple of subplots in this movie, one involving Mickey Rourke and Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, another involving Ray Winstone and Jason Statham.  I found these subplots, well acted and very, very engaging. Alexander Skarsgrd known by most as Eric on the show ""True Blood"" gives a strong performance in a supporting role.  As I noted prior, the acting in this movie is excellent.  I knew Sam Riley played Ian Curtis in ""Control"". I haven't seen that movie yet, which is odd because I am fond of Joy Division. Nevertheless, Sam Riley played a good protagonist and I look forward to see him in other films.  As for Jason Statham, I have always had mixed feelings about him as an actor. In some movies I roll my eyes and at other I enjoy his work. I would have to say he gave a strong performance in this film.  In addition, he doesn't throw a single punch, which is different for him.  Rourke and Winstone were solid as always and even good old 50 Cent provided a good performance.The problem I had with this film was the last half an hour.  The pace became a jumbled mess, appearing as too many things needed to be addressed before the 90 minute mark came.  For instance, there was an unneeded side story with the police attempting to find this underground circuit.  As for the final scene, without spoiling it, there was an excellent irony to the denouement. Yet I also felt like, ""I sat through 90 minutes for this"".This movie is a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the original so I cannot make any comparisons.  Nor am I aware if this film has been honest to the source material.  I believe if the last half an hour could be reworked and subplots either expanded or eliminated, this could have been an amazing film.  I believe the film could even have the same ending, if the former and latter issues could be addressed.In the end this film is interesting, different, and at times very intense and has really good acting.  I would recommend giving this movie a go, there are definitely worse movies a person could watch.  I for one am interested to see the original.",3,Starts out very strong and ends very flat.,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,3142,"['13', 'first', 'movie', 'can', 'recall', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'plot', 'device', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'say', '13', 'utilizes', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'even', 'more', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'did', 'Therefore', 'found', 'movie', 'have', 'very', 'unique', 'different', 'vibe', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'intense', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'Unfortunately', 'certain', 'aspects', 'film', 'keep', 'hostage', 'being', 'amazing', 'motion', 'picture.The', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'basic', 'Vince', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'family', 'have', 'hit', 'hard', 'times', 'money', 'father', 'hospital', 'reason', 'never', 'disclosed', 'textbook', 'MacGuffin', 'various', 'operations', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'family', 'exhausted', 'options', 'Vince', 'up', 'taking', 'extreme', 'measures', 'aid', 'family', 'Using', 'ruse', 'paraphrasing', 'Vince', 'blindly', 'someone', 'else', 'identity', 'believing', 'will', 'bring', 'quick', 'money', 'However', 'Vince', 'being', 'player', 'number', '13', 'underground', 'gambling', 'circuit', 'round', 'robin', 'style', 'game', 'Russian', 'roulette.There', 'couple', 'subplots', 'movie', 'one', 'involving', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Curtis', '50', 'Cent', 'Jackson', 'involving', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'found', 'subplots', 'well', 'acted', 'very', 'very', 'engaging', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'known', 'most', 'Eric', 'show', 'True', 'Blood', 'strong', 'performance', 'supporting', 'role', 'noted', 'prior', 'acting', 'movie', 'excellent', 'knew', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'played', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Control', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'odd', 'am', 'fond', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Nevertheless', 'Sam', 'Riley', 'played', 'good', 'protagonist', 'look', 'forward', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'about', 'actor', 'movies', 'roll', 'eyes', 'other', 'enjoy', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'gave', 'strong', 'performance', 'film', 'addition', ""n't"", 'throw', 'single', 'punch', 'different', 'Rourke', 'Winstone', 'were', 'solid', 'always', 'even', 'good', 'old', '50', 'Cent', 'provided', 'good', 'performance.The', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'pace', 'became', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'appearing', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'needed', 'be', 'addressed', '90', 'minute', 'mark', 'came', 'instance', 'was', 'unneeded', 'side', 'story', 'police', 'attempting', 'find', 'underground', 'circuit', 'final', 'scene', 'spoiling', 'was', 'excellent', 'irony', 'denouement', 'also', 'felt', 'sat', '90', 'minutes', '.This', 'movie', 'remake', 'French', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'comparisons', 'am', 'aware', 'film', 'been', 'honest', 'source', 'material', 'believe', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'could', 'be', 'reworked', 'subplots', 'expanded', 'eliminated', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'film', 'believe', 'film', 'could', 'even', 'have', 'same', 'ending', 'former', 'latter', 'issues', 'could', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'interesting', 'different', 'times', 'very', 'intense', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'would', 'recommend', 'giving', 'movie', 'go', 'are', 'definitely', 'worse', 'movies', 'person', 'could', 'watch', 'one', 'am', 'interested', 'see', 'original']",13

After a impulse decision to steal a man's identity, Vince (Riley) becomes a contestant in a game of Russian roulette. The winner gets a little more then a million, the loser...dies. Never having seen the original I wasn't sure what to expect, and honestly I watched this because of Statham. The beginning was a little slow, but when the game started it really picked up and was interesting and very disturbing at the same time. Comparing this to ""Death Race"" I think is acceptable as it involves people doing their best to survive in a grotesque game. While ""Death Race"" was about cars and you had more of a separation from the killing, this one is in your face. Spin the chamber, cock the hammer, point at someone's head, while someone does the same to you, then shoot. Either you live for next round or you don't. This is a pretty good movie with a good cast (not counting 50 Cent) and is a neat idea. I just think it was missing something. I think it was making you feel for the characters. You just don't seem to care who lives or dies, and that hurts the movie. Overall, an entertaining movie that is worth watching, if for no other reason then morbid curiosity.

Like Ole Bornedal's ""Nightwatch"" (based on ""Nattevagten"") and George Sluizer's ""The Vanishing"" (based on ""Spoorloos""), it is a remake by the same director of the original. And like these two unnecessary remakes, ""13"" only makes me ask myself: ""Do we need it?"" (Yes, I know, Hitchcock did ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" twice, but we all know that an exception makes the rule.)The story is largely the same as the original. Sam Riley (""Control"") is Vince, a young electrician living in Ohio, whose father has been in hospital. Vince really needs money when he overhears a strange conversation about what he thinks could be a great chance to make a lot of money quickly.If you have seen the trailer, you know what awaits Vince in a remote mansion in the woods. The idea of ""the most dangerous game"" is intriguing and the game sequences are intense, but as there is almost nothing the contestants can do to make the chance of ""winning"" bigger, the tension slowly drains out of it. Though Jason Statham's character refers to ""experiences,"" we know it's all about chance. No thinking, no outwitting others. And chance alone is not enough to keep us interested in the proceedings.The cast also includes Ben Gazzara, Curtis Jackson, Mickey Rourke, Michael Shannon (over-the-top as a game's referee) and Ray Winstone. The characters of Jackson and Rourke are created for the remake. The acting is certainly solid, but with familiar faces and the photography that has become crispy (the original was shot in grainy black-and-white), something is missing from the new version.Most of the traits that rendered the original film unique and fascinating are gone, and ""13"" looks more like an average thriller with one intriguing aspect: the game.

Each of those who play the game, enter a circle and point a revolver to the man's head in front of them. The players all have a number, and the film's title is based on the number of the film's hero, such as he is--number 13.The film drags the viewer through a series of ""games"" managed by what amounts to a game show host as the paying customers place their bets on who will survive and stand way too close to the circle of men who point and shoot at the person in front of them.
