I mean today is 11.11.11 and what? I am having a good day. Maybe there is a real meaning behind this date, but so far the movies are using too much of this and too much of that. Take paranormal activity 1,2 and 3, take the doomsdays movies like 2012, anything that leads to destruction in a unique matter (like global extinction by any unbelievable reason, something that we fear of and yet did never happen to us, or our generation).  It's just too much. The way this movie depicts 11.11.11 is just unbelievable. Surely yeah there are unexplained by science things, but to believe in all that, I will not. Not a bad movie though, it was entertaining, but the end wasn't exactly the best part of the movie. No spoilers, see for yourself. Also the end is not quite having all of the answers. For instance what happened to the main ''hero''? Will I recommend the movie? Yes, get yourself a treat. Will I recommend this to people who seek answers on number 11? Actually yes, BUT remember: a) the special effects= Hollywood movie= don't expect that to happen in real life b) there are few explanations given in the movie, but don't believe everything you hear. Explore the internet yourself, search and compare. Because some information in this movie could simply be false. And just know that it's a movie. Just watch it and enjoy it. Why did I rate it 4 stars? Because it was entertaining and didn't have plenty of information on this subject (which I would love to know), too many ''creepy moments'' made for audience (too much like any other Hollywood movie. Was it original? yes and no. I would still draw connections to other movies. The only original thing in here is the use of this specific date. And finally there is another movie with almost identical name 11/11/11 (I would advice you to avoid it, it's a waste of time, cheap and very bad).

I, however, like to give movies the benefit of the doubt. I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down and watched this film. In this case the saying ""never judge a book by its cover"" is very fitting. I won't go into details of the premise since you can read that in the description but for the most part the acting was pretty good. Michael Lands who played Joseph's brother was a little over-the-top at times but I think part of this problem might have come more from the script than the actor. The premise of the story is very intriguing and there were quite a few moments that had me unnerved. Anything involving demons is terrifying to me and this was no exception. I also liked that this film was subtle on effects and not ridden with over-the-top CGI or gore. It was more about the slow burn and characterization, kind of in the vein of such classics as The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. I'll take Supernatural/Psychological Horror over Slasher/gore any day. Is this a done deal? Definitely not, the film suffers from an uneven flow at times and the script could have used some fine-tuning. All quibbles aside, in my humble opinion this was not a terrible film. Definitely worth a rental, at least, but for how cheap the retail price is you could waste your hard-earned cash on a lot worse.

1508575,A3JBLXCH954NMV,B0062LQEHE,"Jared M. Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[1, 1]","11-11-11 is the very low-budget, psychological horror film directed and written by Darren Lynn Bousman. When a troubled author Joseph Crone (Timothy Gibbs) goes to Spain, where his father is dying, his estranged and religious brother Samuel tries to comfort him as he begins to see 11-11 everywhere. Upon researching the topic, he discovers that the numbers are believed to coincide with 11-11-11, the date when a door will open to another realm, but where? Heaven or hell, all Joseph knows is that all these terrible events don't exactly pave the way to ultimate glory.This was and is honestly a good movie! It's very enjoyable, different and refreshing, with the ""found-footage"" subgenre movies like the terrible Paranormal Activity saga, the even worse Chernobyl Diaries and the good sci-fi thriller Chronicle. The only true problem with the film was the script. The sad thing is, it's not Darren's fault for writing something that was sloppy in places and well-paced in others. The production was rushed because the producers didn't have much faith in the film. The acting was decent, ranging from goofy to very good. Bousman's direction was really good; the very little use CG was nice, with mainly practical effects and scares, and Joseph Bishara's score is hauntingly fantastic (you can see my review on the soundtrack's own page). Overall, 11-11-11 was a fine movie that had a great concept/plot that ended up being less than what it could have been. Still a must-see for horror fans and those who like intriguing conspiracy/race-against time-style movies. Very thrilling and creepy.

Soon clues regarding the Biblical reference to the numbers leads him to a final devilish confrontation.The film's pacing is a tad lethargic and the performances of Timothy Gibbs as the author and Michael Landes as his brother are adequate but not remarkable.

While there he comes upon various events all associated with 11-11, from the day his mother died to the date his wife and child were murdered.

Joesph Crone is an author trying to deal with the loss of his wife and child. After getting a call from his brother he travels to Spain to see him and his dying father. When the date and time of 11:11 keeps showing up in his life he wonders if it has meaning. I will start by saying that I actually did like this movie. I also have to say that it is still a high class B movie though. The best way to describe this is that it is a little better and scarier version of ""Number 23"". If you like that movie you will like this one. The movie deals with some very religious issues and makes you wonder who is right and what is real. The movie rode the line of serious and cheesy the whole time. Stepping over to the cheesy side more often but still I liked it. There really isn't much else to say about this one but for any hardcore horror fans this is a good one to watch. For everyone else I will say I liked it, but don't go in expecting a great movie. Overall, a movie that I enjoyed and fans of ""Number 23"" will love. I give it a B+.",4,"11-11-11 - A scarier version of ""Number 23"" that was better and cheesier then I expected. I liked it.
