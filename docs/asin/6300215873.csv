And the movie itself was technically a critical and box office failure (that changed somewhat years later) However because of the palpable sexual and emotional tension that the two leads generated their talents were put to better use in This Property Is Condemned the very next year.The story itself is a bit too simple and more than a bit too melodrama, but Redford and Wood really elevate it with every interaction together.

219114,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,6300215873,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[111, 118]","How could a movie fanatic go wrong with this one? Sidney Pollack directing, with Francis Ford Coppola helping out with the adaptation of a Tennessee Williams play? A great cast , with especially memorable performances from Natalie Wood, Kate Reid and Mary Badham (as younger sister, Willie Starr)? Roberts Redford and Blake and Charles Bronson thrown in for lagniappe? Sounds like great gumbo to me.Natalie Wood is absolutely alluring in this one. She and Redford, who also teamed together in the memorable INSIDE DAISY CLOVER, did indeed appear to have a lot of screen chemistry. He is the cynical company man who appears like the Grim Reaper in a small, shabby, depression-era southern town, carrying pink slips with him, instead of a scythe. The role has a lot of resonance now, what with all the corporate downsizing currently going on. Needless to say, the townfolk don't much cotton to Mr Owen Legate, with his fancy suit and self-assured ways.With a couple notable exceptions. Tom boyish Willie Starr is taken by him right away and the minute her big sister Alma sets eyes on him, she's putty. Wood's expression in that initial glance is part of film history.Owen further antagonizes the townfolk because they see that Alma has taken a shine to an outsider. Alma's been something of a tramp up this point, givining it up to varying degrees to most of the men in the town. Several of them, including an old geezer with an invilid wife, have been fantazising about further adventures with Alma. And Alma's mother is upset with Owen, because she sees that he is going to take away her gravy train. Hazel Starr is one of Williams' great eccentric female characters, and perhaps his most unctuous (though Amanda Wingfield, in THE GLASS MENAGERIE, is no prize, either. Kate Reid is perfect in the role. This, to me is her most memorable performance, followed closely by her title role in AND MISS REARDON DRINKS A LITTLE, which unfortunatley appears to be impossible to find. It's hard to believe she never won an Oscar or a Tony.This was only the second feature film that Pollock directed. He of course went on to great things with such films as THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY and TOOTSIE. He and Cinematographer James Wong Howe do a great job of capturing small southern town lethargy, as well as 30's New Orleans ambience. The print, unfortunately, could definitely use a full restoration. It's faded noticeably over time. The film certainly warrants the extra work. Yet time cannot wither Natalie Wood. She's still one of the most lovely women a camera ever made love to. This film definitely belongs near the top of the list for screen adaptations of Williams' plays.BEK",5,A Southern Gothic Treat,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,2674,"['How', 'could', 'movie', 'fanatic', 'go', 'wrong', 'one', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'directing', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'helping', 'out', 'adaptation', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'great', 'cast', 'especially', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Kate', 'Reid', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'younger', 'sister', 'Willie', 'Starr', 'Roberts', 'Redford', 'Blake', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'thrown', 'lagniappe', 'great', 'gumbo', 'me.Natalie', 'Wood', 'absolutely', 'alluring', 'one', 'Redford', 'who', 'also', 'teamed', 'together', 'memorable', 'INSIDE', 'DAISY', 'CLOVER', 'did', 'indeed', 'appear', 'have', 'lot', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'cynical', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'small', 'shabby', 'depression-era', 'southern', 'town', 'carrying', 'pink', 'slips', 'instead', 'scythe', 'role', 'lot', 'resonance', 'now', 'what', 'corporate', 'downsizing', 'currently', 'going', 'Needless', 'say', 'townfolk', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'cotton', 'Mr', 'Owen', 'Legate', 'fancy', 'suit', 'self-assured', 'ways.With', 'couple', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Tom', 'boyish', 'Willie', 'Starr', 'taken', 'right', 'away', 'minute', 'big', 'sister', 'Alma', 'eyes', 'putty', 'Wood', 'expression', 'initial', 'glance', 'part', 'film', 'history.Owen', 'further', 'townfolk', 'see', 'Alma', 'taken', 'shine', 'outsider', 'Alma', 'been', 'something', 'tramp', 'up', 'point', 'givining', 'varying', 'degrees', 'most', 'men', 'town', 'Several', 'including', 'old', 'geezer', 'invilid', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'fantazising', 'further', 'adventures', 'Alma', 'Alma', 'mother', 'upset', 'Owen', 'going', 'take', 'away', 'gravy', 'train', 'Hazel', 'Starr', 'one', 'Williams', 'great', 'eccentric', 'female', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'most', 'unctuous', 'Amanda', 'Wingfield', 'THE', 'GLASS', 'MENAGERIE', 'prize', 'either', 'Kate', 'Reid', 'perfect', 'role', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'followed', 'closely', 'title', 'role', 'AND', 'MISS', 'REARDON', 'DRINKS', 'A', 'LITTLE', 'unfortunatley', 'be', 'impossible', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'never', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Tony.This', 'was', 'only', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Pollock', 'directed', 'course', 'went', 'great', 'things', 'such', 'films', 'THEY', 'SHOOT', 'HORSES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'THEY', 'TOOTSIE', 'Cinematographer', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'lethargy', 'as', 'well', '30', 'New', 'Orleans', 'ambience', 'print', 'unfortunately', 'could', 'definitely', 'use', 'full', 'restoration', 'faded', 'noticeably', 'time', 'film', 'certainly', 'warrants', 'extra', 'work', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'wither', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'lovely', 'women', 'camera', 'ever', 'made', 'love', 'film', 'definitely', 'top', 'list', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'Williams', 'plays.BEK']",N/A

Sad, touching; I felt like I was eavesdropping through the whole thing. I  kept craving something to quench my thirst.  Natalie Wood gives one of her  finest performances in this.  When she had to get &quot;tight&quot; for the  scene, she drank real wine to loosen up, and her tipsy acting is truly  authentic.  She slurrs her words, because she IS drunk and it's a great  scene.  If you're not into that crawly feeling, when it comes to poor  morals and sleazy thinking, you won't like this; there are poor, needy,  perverts living in denial the entire movie. (I watch it from the &quot;I  can't believe this stuff goes on&quot; standpoint)  Robert Redford can  generally do little wrong when it comes to his performances; he's an egnima  in this movie; this film is an enigma to me. I can really understand how  someone can't like it, not just DON'T, but can't, but to portray all this  sadness and bring the audience into it.....excellent. Now, &quot;Mama&quot;  is nothing but an icky 43 year old sleazy, slutpuppy who happens to also be  a narcissistic pimp, sad;  (She's the reason for all the grief in Alva's  life) I wished she'd died and I wanted to smack her sometimes!

Make up your own mind.  It's not for viewers  expecting a happy movie, certainly for people appreciating great writing  and excellent acting.  PS.  Mary Badham fans (To Kill a Mockingbird) this  is a must. She didn't make more than a few films; as far as I know.  It's  not her &quot;Mockingbird&quot; performance but nothing compares to that  movie. She does her job as Willie, storyteller. She trapeses around in her  sister's old red dress, sad.  Jon Provost is her &quot;instantly discovered  friend&quot;; not a big part but the vehicle through whom we hear tell of  the beautiful, fanciful Alva.  Great acting. I know the ending.

Better no music than what they lacquered the movie with. This was one of the worst, most ill-adapted scores I have ever seen matched with a film.-The main roles were miscast. Redford and Wood are fine actors, but they're decidedly not the southern characters called for. Wood was worst. I never felt for a minute that she was anything but a Hollywood actress cast in the role. I did not believe her. She certainly was no southerner. Her accent was terrible. Yes, she had nice acting bits, but she did not live in it. The difference between stage acting and movies is the intimacy. Film captures the inner life; the stage captures the outer. Lots of late 50s, and 60s movies were cast with big names, assuming they would just deliver the lines well. Redford was better at it, but still out of place.-Willie was probably the best actress in the movie, but....well, first, she's cast as a wraith subsisting in a train car. This is a stage motif, not for film. People ask questions: what is she living on, where is the state in this, how did she get here, etc? All of which wouldn't be asked, if the music and the color weren't wrong. Technicolor flattens things. It puts the drama in the color but takes it away from the characters. It makes the set, the background too real, too everyday.-Plot. Oh, come on, she doesn't tell him she's not planning on going to Memphis? She doesn't tell him she had a bad night with Charles Bronson? Stuff like that is okay if she is a typical wispy, frail, frightened Tennessee Williams' heroine. Natalie Wood is a healthy girl. She's not going to die from a run in the rain. (Actually, you could have had a Vivien Leigh-type or Julie Harris do the role. The fact that Alva is a stunner could be handled in a small town by any decent-looking woman because she IS in a small town.)-Almost none of the men are believable. Bronson is, but his part is mechanical, a plot saver--he's not a real character, and certainly neither he nor any of the others give you the impression of southerners. When I saw Brando's Mutiny on the Bounty, I said I couldn't believe it--all the sailors were clean shaven and clean and good looking--like they'd just come off the South Pacific set. These men were 'acting' rowdies. You didn't believe them.-The mother probably was closest to being a real presence, but finally she didn't make it  because, oddly, she wasn't sinister enough. Kudos still go to Willie.-The plot was ill-built. Nothing moved right. In other words, the music of the plot was wrong, the timing for events wrong.-Redford's character made this leap from hard-bitten firer of men to dreamer (dreams are at the core of this plot--as all TWilliams' are) with no worthwhile transition.

219125,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300215873,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Written in 1946, the Tennessee Williams play THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED consisted of two characters, a little girl named Willie and a boy Tom.  The two meet while playing on the train tracks, and Willie tells Tom about the boarding house the family once owned and her sister Alva, who was a small-town floozie and the boarding house's ""main attraction.""  It is an elegant little play with tremendous pathos and a running time of about fifteen minutes.  Some twenty years later, after Williams had become world famous for such dramas as A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, this very short play was adapted to a full-length motion picture, and it strains in the transition.Although set in the deep south of the great depression and referencing the same characters, the story has only a vauge relationship with the original play.  Hazel Starr (Kate Reid) is a grass widow of questionable morality, and with the assistance of daughters Alva (Natalie Wood) and Willie (Mary Badham) she owns and operates a boarding house that caters to railroad men.  Alva's chief contribution to the enterprise is her youth and beauty, which provides a bullpen of boarders.  Hazel is pushing Alva to become the mistress of older, unattractive, married, but comparatively wealthy Mr. Johnson (John Harding)--but Alva falls hard for Owen Legate (Robert Redford), a handsome stranger who has come to town begin a series of lay-offs that will close the railroad line and ultimately force the Starr Boarding House to close.  Like most Williams stories, the movie has a dark conclusion.The film is quite handsome in a visual sense.  The cinematography by the legendary James Wong Howe is nothing short of spectacular, with rich colors and textures, and Howe makes notable use of location: exteriors for THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED were filmed in the small Mississippi community of Bay St. Louis, and through Howe's lense one really does have a sense of place and time.  (The building that was used for The Starr Boarding House still survives, is now home to Bay St. Louis Little Theatre, and is on the historic register.)  Performances are also very good, with Kate Reid and Mary Badham (better known as Scout in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD) particular standouts.  But the script feels both superficial and overwrought, and although the look of the movie is very atmospheric, the story itself has a ho-hum quality and quickly becomes predictable.  The DVD does not include any extras, but the sound and picture elements are in very good condition.  Mildly recommended for fans of the stars, of Tennessee Williams, and the Southern Gothic genre.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Ho-Hum Script Undercuts Memorable Stars and Cinematography,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2647,"['Written', '1946', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'THIS', 'PROPERTY', 'IS', 'CONDEMNED', 'consisted', 'two', 'characters', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Willie', 'boy', 'Tom', 'two', 'meet', 'playing', 'train', 'tracks', 'Willie', 'Tom', 'boarding', 'house', 'family', 'once', 'owned', 'sister', 'Alva', 'who', 'was', 'small-town', 'floozie', 'boarding', 'house', 'main', 'attraction', 'elegant', 'little', 'play', 'tremendous', 'pathos', 'running', 'time', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Williams', 'had', 'become', 'world', 'famous', 'such', 'dramas', 'A', 'STREET', 'CAR', 'NAMED', 'DESIRE', 'CAT', 'ON', 'A', 'HOT', 'TIN', 'ROOF', 'very', 'short', 'play', 'was', 'adapted', 'full-length', 'motion', 'picture', 'transition.Although', 'set', 'deep', 'south', 'great', 'depression', 'referencing', 'same', 'characters', 'story', 'only', 'vauge', 'relationship', 'original', 'play', 'Hazel', 'Starr', 'Kate', 'Reid', 'grass', 'widow', 'questionable', 'morality', 'assistance', 'daughters', 'Alva', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Willie', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'boarding', 'house', 'railroad', 'men', 'Alva', 'chief', 'contribution', 'enterprise', 'youth', 'beauty', 'bullpen', 'boarders', 'Hazel', 'pushing', 'Alva', 'become', 'mistress', 'older', 'unattractive', 'married', 'comparatively', 'wealthy', 'Mr.', 'Johnson', 'John', 'Harding', 'Alva', 'hard', 'Owen', 'Legate', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'who', 'come', 'town', 'begin', 'series', 'lay-offs', 'will', 'close', 'railroad', 'line', 'ultimately', 'force', 'Starr', 'Boarding', 'House', 'close', 'most', 'Williams', 'stories', 'movie', 'dark', 'conclusion.The', 'film', 'quite', 'handsome', 'visual', 'sense', 'cinematography', 'legendary', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'rich', 'colors', 'textures', 'Howe', 'notable', 'use', 'location', 'exteriors', 'THIS', 'PROPERTY', 'IS', 'CONDEMNED', 'were', 'filmed', 'small', 'Mississippi', 'community', 'Bay', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Howe', 'lense', 'one', 'really', 'have', 'sense', 'place', 'time', 'building', 'was', 'used', 'Starr', 'Boarding', 'House', 'still', 'now', 'home', 'Bay', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Little', 'Theatre', 'historic', 'register', 'Performances', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Kate', 'Reid', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'better', 'known', 'Scout', 'TO', 'KILL', 'A', 'MOCKINGBIRD', 'particular', 'standouts', 'script', 'superficial', 'overwrought', 'look', 'movie', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'story', 'ho-hum', 'quality', 'quickly', 'becomes', 'predictable', 'DVD', 'not', 'include', 'extras', 'sound', 'picture', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'condition', 'Mildly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'stars', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'genre.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Looking back on it I feel the idea may have been stronger than the execution, though I did find myself interested in the story and the camerawork and set locations were good.  Sydney Pollack directed and Francis Ford Coppola (hit and miss for me) wrote the screenplay (based on a one-act play by Tennessee Williams).

This film was not to me sulty, sexy or smoldering, and it lacked the scented decadence that I've come to associate with a Tennessee Williams play.  (He was a hero of mine in high school.)  However, Williams didn't write this screenplay, though it's from a shorter work of his.  It was a wonderful movie, everyone acted it to the hilt.  Redford was great, and had his usual inflections and mannerisms.  Wood covered all the emotions exactly, from nervous anxiety at the start, though joy, grief and horror, indignant rage, dreamy fantasizing, the works.  I thought she deserved an Oscar.  The flick also had a very young shy Robert Blake in it.  I never hated a character so much in my movie-going life as I did Kate Reid, Wood's mother in the movie.

Natalie Wood (Alva) continues to demonstrate her unusual knack for deep psychological roles. To this she adds her own blossoming to full womanhood with a beauty that is at once mezmarizing and perfectly wedded to her seductively meschievous character. Kate Reid excels as the ""toxic parent"" whose ruthless possessiveness and manipulation form a trap from which Alva only escapes through fantasy. Robert Redford (railroad exec Own Legate) delivers as her unlikely would be savior, while at the same time sounding the death knell for the small Depression Era railroad town that sustains her. And Carles Bronson adds a surprisingly fit performance as the roughneck who courts the mother only to get close to the daughter, but instead unwittingly plays a role in her destruction.Critics panned this film that clearly goes against the grain of what was considered tasteful for the times, but that deftly describes the destructive patterns of co-dependency and toxic parenting before they were understood in those terms.

219147,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6300215873,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""This Property Is Condemned"" is a good movie, maybe not brilliant, but certainly riveting in its way.  An early screenplay adaptation of Tennessee Williams' one act play was supposed to serve as an Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton project, but eventually came to Natalie Wood whose star was riding high.  Wood brought in Redford, as it's related inRobert Redford: The Biography.  The project almost fell through because of screenplays that didn't work well, eventually bringing Francis Coppola as writer.Redford's muted intensity shines throughout the film, which is his film as much his as Wood's.  A classic moment comes when Wood's Alva invades Redford's Owen Legate's rented boardinghouse room and Redford asks if she comes with the room because he'd like to get on with it, which results in Wood storming out.  Natalie Wood's flighty interpretation of Alva, small town flirt apparently lacking in common sense, earned her a Golden Globe nomination for the film.I was most impressed with Kate Reid's range and intensity as the mother Hazel.  Reid was later nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in ""Death of a Salesman.""  As Hazel, Reid manipulates Wood, lays guilt trips, and in every way takes advantage of her beautiful daughter's charms.Charles Bronson turns in a sterling supporting performance as J.J. Nichols who tries to seduce Alva while skinny dipping in the lake, even as he dates Alva's mother.  Robert Blake also turns in a great performance as Sidney, a working stiff who is smitten by Alva's charms.  Mary Badham plays Willie, through whose child eyes we see the film.  John Harding also does a nice job as Mr. Johnson, the train conductor who is married to an invalid and wants to earn Alva's attention with expensive gifts.In the Redford biography, it's related that when Redford suggested his pal Sydney Pollack, Wood responded, ""Sydney Pollack?  Who's he?""  Pollack does a great job of keeping the pacing going and the relationships riveting throughout the film.  Yes, the resulting screenplay seems a bit bumpy.  Natalie Wood's last frame as she runs into the New Orleans night seems abrupt, with Willie then relating Alva's fate.  The performances in the film make it an underrated gem.  The DVD gives a good but no-frills presentation of the film.

Wistful, sad, big-sister party girl Alva Starr, whose cheerful promiscuity covers up a heart that is lacerated by her father's abandonment and her mother's exploitation of her beauty... Wise, perceptive, yet innocent and ignorant, little sister Willie...  And, an absent father (never seen in the film, but who is referred to constantly), who abandoned these three tragic females during the Great Depression... leaving them to their own dysfunctional, survival-level devices as they run a sleazy boarding house in a piddling, Mississippi railroad town.In walks a handsome stranger named Owen Legate... an efficiency expert who has been commissioned to shut down the railroad shops.  He is as handsome as Alva is beautiful.  Alva quickly realizes that this gorgeous, decent, steady-Eddie is different from the roughneck wolves that surround her mother's boarding house.  However, he also clearly represents the family's missing father.  Upon his arrival in town, mother Hazel sizes up Mr. Owen Legate, and instructs Willie to &#34;put him in Papa's room&#34; (referenced in the movie as a room that is never used for boarding house clients, it is a room that holds beloved trinkets, paintings that he did himself, and his children's photographs).  Owen makes an instant connection with little sister Willie; he listens to Alva with firm compassion.  Owen also forces Alva to own up to what she has become for her mother... the town tramp who can bring more customers to the boarding house.It doesn't take Alva long to realize that she not only loves this man, but he is also a ticket to a better life... a life that is sane, loving, meaningful, and structured.  Meanwhile, Owen falls in love with Alva's fanciful, dreamy tendency to think of life as more special than it might be in reality.  Despite his good looks, kindness, and calm confidence, he is actually emotionally closed-off; Alva makes him smile and laugh, and makes him realize how much he is needed, and how much he loves others.  He cares about Alva and Willie in the same way that a husband and father would.  Back to the &#34;Papa&#34; thing again... but if one watches the movie carefully, it's clear that the emotional and structural damage of father abandonment is its central, running theme.It's a tragic story, and parts of the movie are just too difficult to watch.  Those who have experienced this type of manipulative, wretched dysfunction are likely to turn the movie off without finishing it... and they would be right to do so, as it's very well-acted.

Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[10, 11]","Director Sidney Pollack surrounds his two top stars with a great cast of actors and in so doing created a small masterpiece of this story of a Mississippi Camille.  He recreates the depression era south with meticulous detail and creates an atmosphere of steamy nights and sweltering days at a dilapidated rail line boarding house that is on it's last legs. In this one of his early films he shows that he is about to become one of the great directors of Cinema.The adaptation of the play by Francis Ford Coppola, Fred Coe, and Edith Sommer crackles with the music of William's dialog. All the elements of a William's female character on the edge of her fate and dreaming of a better life are blended and expanded by the writers.Robert Redford as Owen Legate, the railroad ""spotter"" who changes everyone's lives when he arrives with pink slips for most of Dodson Mississippi turns in another strong performance. He is practical man without dreams of his own. Owen is cool, surgical and disassociated from his own feelings. Only the dreamy and deluded magic of Wood's Alva can open his heart and eyes to the possibilities of love. He and Natalie Wood have a palpable chemistry as they circle and spar their way into a star-crossed love affaire.Kate Reid as Alva's scheming middle-aged mother hit's the nail right on the head in her hard and sometimes funny performance. Her manipulation of Alma into an unacknowledged succession of love for pay relationships with the male boarders of her house is chilling to witness. She is a monster of a mother who hangs around to catch the discarded crumbs of Alva's spurned admirers. When faced with the possibility that this may end she tears at her daughter using every thing in her arsenal of lies to hold her life together and to keep the men in her bed.The part of Alma's batty little sister is played by Mary Badham, most famous for her role as Scout in ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""  She is perfect for the roll and adds a touch of madness at the end which is so right for the story.In the small roll of J.J. Charles Bronson, on the edge of breaking out into major rolls brings an animal sensuality to the screen in his scenes with Wood.  His craggy face is still and cagey as he sizes up Redford, bemused when confronted with Kate Reid's unwanted advances. In the skinny dipping scene with Natalie he takes her in his arms with tender menace and yet there is a neediness in his eyes that belies his lack of trust in even her, the woman he would have at any price.All of these great actors lend support to the wonderful showcase of Natalie Wood as Alva.  She was one of the rare childhood stars that flourished as an adult actress. Beautiful and talented she did her best work in the early to mid 1960's. ""This Property Is Condemned"" is her film all the way. She is at once softly sensuous, charming, and when her dreams and fantasies are boxed into a corner by her mother she becomes ferocious.  Her scene with Kate Reid, where the mother is begging Alva to stay with her is incredible in its drama and Wood's ability to let it all go and give the scene the power it needs. As mentioned before her chemistry with Redford is electric and never more so than in the scene where she angrily confronts him only to be thrown against the bedroom door and kissed into an admission of her desire for him. She shines throughout the picture proving that she is indeed an actress of not only rare beauty but a staggering talent.There are only a few flaws, such as, with all the meticulous attention to detail of the 1930's the women in the film are coiffed in height of mid-sixties hairstyles.  Not until the 70's did moviemakers even attempt to leave this practice behind.All the talents involved lift this minor play to a level to stand with any of the great works by Williams. ""This Property Is Condemned"" is a must have for any film collector who enjoys great performances by real stars and a solid story.",5,Star Power Add Value To This Property,1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,3938,"['Director', 'Sidney', 'Pollack', 'two', 'top', 'stars', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'so', 'doing', 'created', 'small', 'masterpiece', 'story', 'Mississippi', 'Camille', 'depression', 'era', 'south', 'meticulous', 'detail', 'atmosphere', 'steamy', 'nights', 'sweltering', 'days', 'dilapidated', 'rail', 'line', 'boarding', 'house', 'last', 'legs', 'one', 'early', 'films', 'become', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'Cinema.The', 'adaptation', 'play', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Fred', 'Coe', 'Edith', 'Sommer', 'crackles', 'music', 'William', 'dialog', 'elements', 'William', 'female', 'character', 'edge', 'fate', 'dreaming', 'better', 'life', 'are', 'blended', 'expanded', 'writers.Robert', 'Redford', 'Owen', 'Legate', 'railroad', 'spotter', 'who', 'everyone', 'lives', 'when', 'pink', 'slips', 'most', 'Dodson', 'Mississippi', 'strong', 'performance', 'practical', 'man', 'dreams', 'own', 'Owen', 'cool', 'surgical', 'disassociated', 'own', 'feelings', 'Only', 'dreamy', 'deluded', 'magic', 'Wood', 'Alva', 'can', 'open', 'heart', 'eyes', 'possibilities', 'love', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'have', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'circle', 'spar', 'way', 'star-crossed', 'love', 'affaire.Kate', 'Reid', 'Alva', 'scheming', 'middle-aged', 'mother', 'hit', 'nail', 'right', 'head', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'performance', 'manipulation', 'Alma', 'unacknowledged', 'succession', 'love', 'pay', 'relationships', 'male', 'boarders', 'house', 'chilling', 'witness', 'monster', 'mother', 'who', 'catch', 'discarded', 'crumbs', 'Alva', 'spurned', 'admirers', 'When', 'faced', 'possibility', 'may', 'end', 'tears', 'daughter', 'using', 'thing', 'arsenal', 'lies', 'hold', 'life', 'together', 'keep', 'men', 'bed.The', 'part', 'Alma', 'batty', 'little', 'sister', 'played', 'Mary', 'Badham', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Scout', 'Kill', 'A', 'Mockingbird', 'perfect', 'roll', 'touch', 'madness', 'end', 'so', 'right', 'story.In', 'small', 'roll', 'J.J.', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'edge', 'breaking', 'out', 'major', 'rolls', 'animal', 'sensuality', 'screen', 'scenes', 'Wood', 'craggy', 'face', 'still', 'cagey', 'up', 'Redford', 'bemused', 'when', 'confronted', 'Kate', 'Reid', 'unwanted', 'advances', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'scene', 'Natalie', 'arms', 'tender', 'menace', 'yet', 'neediness', 'eyes', 'lack', 'trust', 'even', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'price.All', 'great', 'actors', 'lend', 'support', 'wonderful', 'showcase', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Alva', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'childhood', 'stars', 'flourished', 'adult', 'actress', 'Beautiful', 'talented', 'did', 'best', 'work', 'early', 'mid', '1960', 'Property', 'Condemned', 'film', 'way', 'once', 'softly', 'sensuous', 'charming', 'when', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'are', 'boxed', 'corner', 'mother', 'ferocious', 'scene', 'Kate', 'Reid', 'where', 'mother', 'begging', 'Alva', 'stay', 'incredible', 'drama', 'Wood', 'ability', 'let', 'go', 'give', 'scene', 'power', 'mentioned', 'chemistry', 'Redford', 'electric', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'scene', 'where', 'angrily', 'only', 'be', 'thrown', 'bedroom', 'door', 'kissed', 'admission', 'desire', 'picture', 'proving', 'indeed', 'actress', 'not', 'only', 'rare', 'beauty', 'staggering', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'flaws', 'such', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'detail', '1930', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'coiffed', 'height', 'mid-sixties', 'hairstyles', 'Not', '70', 'did', 'moviemakers', 'even', 'attempt', 'leave', 'practice', 'behind.All', 'talents', 'involved', 'lift', 'minor', 'play', 'level', 'stand', 'great', 'works', 'Williams', 'Property', 'Condemned', 'must', 'have', 'film', 'collector', 'who', 'great', 'performances', 'real', 'stars', 'solid', 'story']",N/A

It will certainly be the undoing of the small town and the families who live there. Owen rents a room in the Starr boardinghouse and comes to know the oldest daughter, town flirt, dreamer and screaming to get outta Mississippi, Alva Starr, played to sheer perfection by Natalie Wood.Alva's mother has a relationship &quot;of sorts&quot; with a snake of a man named JJ, played very understatedly and well by a young Charles Bronson. JJ is really hot after young, beautiful and promiscuous Alva, not Alva's 43 year old dried up horrible witch of a mother who plays Alva's pimp during the entire movie.Owen gets to know Alva in more ways than one as they start a torrid love affair.

Well, I got older ... and saw it again. And it's still pretty romantic. In fact, it's still a film I watch over and over.The performances are really juicy. Everyone in it seems to understand the over-the-top quality of Tennessee Williams, and no one disappoints. You'll find Charles Bronson and a very young Robert Blake in supporting roles here. Both Kate Reid, as Wood's driving, ambitious `Mama' using her beautiful daughter to hook the town's men, and Mary Badham, as `Willie', the not-so-beautiful younger sister who idolizes Wood, are quite simply superb. Every move, every look from both are truly sublime.Natalie Wood has always been one of my favorite stars, and she is every inch the star in this one. It's clear from her first closeup how special, how different, and how exciting Alva Starr is to everyone she comes in contact with. She meets her match in Robert Redford, the man who has no dreams, who sees her in  unvarnished black and white but comes to appreciate her need to color life ... in fact, realizes he can't live without it when he's separated from her.Is it great drama? No. But it's glorious soap opera. The best soap opera, the most memorable Southern soap opera, you're likely to find. These people have real problems, real needs, and they're beautifully drawn by the screenwriters (thank you, Francis Coppola, among others) and by the actors who play them.

219170,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6300215873,Themis-Athena,"[53, 58]","A year after Tennessee Williams's 1945 breakthrough success with ""The Glass Menagerie,"" a collection of his then-existing one-act plays was published under the title ""27 Wagons Full of Cotton.""  Included in that collection was ""This Property Is Condemned,"" a two-person play describing a chance encounter between a boy named Tom and an orphaned school drop-out named Willie by the railroad tracks outside a near-abandoned, post-depression-era Southern town.  During their conversation, Willie tells Tom about her sister Alva, who was once the town's ""Main Attraction"" with suitors galore, fancy clothes and always out to party; but died young when her lungs ""got affected.""  Yet, everything about Willie already spells ""doom"" as well:  Her dreaminess and lack of realism, her cheap rhinestone bracelet and raggedy old-fashioned party dress (which were once her sister's), her shabby doll, and of course the fact that she still lives in her family's old railroad-side boarding house, long-since shut down and bearing the sign ""This Property Is Condemned,"" from which the story thus takes its symbolic title.Inspired by Tennessee Williams's play, Francis Ford Coppola sat down with TV writer-producers Fred Coe and Edith Sommer (as well as uncredited David Rayfiel) and created a screenplay fleshing out the backstory; the story of Alva, who dreams of nothing more than getting out of her small backwater home town and seeing the world (or at least New Orleans, which is more or less the same thing), but is trapped between lack of money and prospects on the one hand and a mother heavily capitalizing on her physical attractions on the other hand.  And both the screenwriters and Natalie Wood, who stars as Alva, did the famous playwright proud:  Their heroine is as much an inhabitant of Williams's ""Dragon Country"" - that place too painful to live in, yet somehow endured - as are her sisters-in-spirit Blanche DuBois (""A Streetcar Named Desire"") and Amanda and Laura Wingfield (""The Glass Menagerie""); like them hiding from a reality deemed intolerable behind a gauze veil of make-believe, and prone to immediate destruction when robbed of her illusions.For Alva, however, doom doesn't come at the hands of a man:  In fact, although she has acquired the reputation of the town's easiest girl, with suitors ranging from her own mother's boyfriend (a marvelously, tightly controlled Charles Bronson) to a wealthy old visitor from Memphis named Johnson (John Harding), railroad executive Owen Legate (Robert Redford), in town with a suitcase full of pink slips and thus the quickly-maligned catalyst of the railroad-dependent community's demise, falls for her when he begins to see through her easygoing facade.  (She, of course, was smitten the minute she laid eyes on him ... and sister, I sure am with you there.  We're talking about Redford in his prime, after all.)  Owen and Alva are a classic case of ""opposites attract"" - he the realist who never dreams, dislikes his job but does it because someone has to, and tries to make her face the reality of her situation, albeit with the aim of empowering, not destroying her; and she the romantic, who can dream herself inside a snow globe when she wants to feel cold, believes that places vividly imagined are almost as good as places actually visited, and sometimes feels so suffocated by her town's encroaching atmosphere that she has physical trouble breathing (which of course also foreshadows other things).  Natalie Wood and Robert Redford have incredible chemistry - their prior collaboration in ""Inside Daisy Clover"" quite obviously helped a lot - and truly bring to life the precarious, only seemingly carefree young Southern belle and her reluctant lover.  But just as crucial is the relationship between Alva and her manipulative mother (Kate Reid), who stands for everything that her daughter is not and, although practically inexistent in Tennessee Williams's play, as an agent of destruction is a worthy peer to his most brutal characters, first and foremost ""Streetcar""'s Stanley Kowalski.While it can hardly be said that the movie is ""based"" on Tennessee Williams's play - the opening credits aptly use the term ""suggested by"" - the play itself remains largely intact as an outer frame; using Willie (Mary Badham of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" fame) as a narrator and taking the majority of the dialogue between her and Tom (""Lassie""'s Jon Provost) straight from the play.  Much the same is true for the Starr boarding house, which in the movie's opening and closing shots quite closely matches Tennessee Williams's (as always) elaborate stage directions, describing the building as ""a large yellow frame house which has a look of tragic vacancy:"" only one example of James Wong Howe's and Stephen Grimes's excellent cinematography and production design, complimented in turn by the great, venerable Edith Head's period-sensitive costumes.For most of the movie's participants, ""This Property Is Condemned"" was a harbinger of even bigger things to come:  Although Natalie Wood was a bona-fide star (and the only actor receiving ""above the line"" billing) and both child actors' parts did not come close to the earlier ones that had made them famous, Francis Ford Coppola was yet to create ""The Godfather,"" Sydney Pollack would go on to direct the much-acclaimed ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,"" Robert Redford's career would skyrocket with ""Butch and Sundance,"" and for Pollack and Redford together this was only the first in a seven-film run, including blockbusters like ""The Way We Were"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" and culminating in 1985's multiple-award-winning ""Out of Africa.""  Thus, this is also an important testament to the level of work that facilitated their respective paths to glory.  Conversely, in Natalie Wood's case this was probably her last truly great appearance, unmatched by any of her remaining work in the 15 years until her untimely death.  For everybody involved, however, it was an important career milestone - and with its spot-on atmosphere, fine acting and all-around great production values it's a movie I'll take over many a more recent release any time; no questions asked.Also recommended:Tennessee Williams: Plays 1937-1955 (Library of America)Tennessee Williams: Plays 1957-1980 (Library of America)Tennessee Williams Film
