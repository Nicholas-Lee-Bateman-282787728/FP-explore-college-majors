1316968,A1YD20Z43RESOQ,B00317LMAG,"Don Eldredge ""Old Man""","[5, 6]","Garry Shandling gets started here in situation comedy, but he turns the genre upside down in a way that help establish (in 1986) a place for comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld to become legitimate television sit-com personalities. The writing of this show rivals that of Seinfeld, but what has always made this thing click for me is the direct contact with the audience, both in the studio and through the TV screen. His idea of admitting he's doing a television show before a live audience -- showing the audience and even, in one episode, appearing to invite them onto the set of his home while his is on another set. It's pure craziness from the start. Even the theme song is classic. This is a four-disc set that includes some commentary and a few outtakes, as well as an interview with Shandling, post-Larry Sanders. Most definitely worth the price, although I would suggest buying the set containing the entire series.",5,Only the beginning,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,922,"['Garry', 'Shandling', 'started', 'here', 'situation', 'comedy', 'genre', 'upside', 'down', 'way', 'help', 'establish', '1986', 'place', 'comedians', 'such', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'become', 'legitimate', 'television', 'sit-com', 'personalities', 'writing', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'what', 'always', 'made', 'thing', 'click', 'direct', 'contact', 'audience', 'studio', 'TV', 'screen', 'idea', 'admitting', 'doing', 'television', 'show', 'live', 'audience', 'showing', 'audience', 'even', 'one', 'episode', 'appearing', 'invite', 'set', 'home', 'set', 'pure', 'craziness', 'start', 'Even', 'theme', 'song', 'classic', 'four-disc', 'set', 'commentary', 'few', 'outtakes', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'Shandling', 'post-Larry', 'Sanders', 'Most', 'definitely', 'price', 'would', 'suggest', 'buying', 'set', 'containing', 'entire', 'series']",It's Garry Shandling's Show: Season 1

Bibi hitting on Garry was histerical. But then the episode went down from there.

This sitcom still holds up today as one of the most inventive, creative and groundbreaking TV shows in history.  It's the classic, ""talk to the viewer"" TV format and no one pulls this off better than Shandling.  While the rest of the cast never plays to the audience, Shandling makes playing both sides of the camera look effortless and easy.  Silly plots make this series even more hysterical.
