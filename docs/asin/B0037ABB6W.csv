1329492,A1V7RL4ODXXWDM,B0037ABB6W,"Jennifer Bogart ""@ Quiverfullfamily.com""","[2, 3]","A History of Christianity is a six-disc BBC documentary hosted by historian Diarmaid MacCulloch (author of a series of extensive, scholarly works on the history of the faith.  I've had the opportunity to review the first disc in the series - The First Christianity.  MacCulloch takes viewers to modern-day sites and churches as he follows the path of Christianity from Jerusalem to the East.With most of us being fairly unfamiliar with Eastern forms of Christianity, MacCulloch's exploration of the roots of various Orthodox faiths is certainly fascinating and informative.  However, if you're looking primarily for a documentation of the spiritual life of the church, or of theology, you won't find it here, though some major doctrinal watersheds are explored.Personally, the lack of division between the actions and beliefs of common believers from what could very well be political machinations (as opposed to faith-based decisions) makes me slightly uncomfortable, and always has.  Admittedly, this is difficult to hash out in the history of the Christian church, as only God can truly judge the heart and the motives of man.  Perhaps wading into this fray is a place that even angels fear to tread!Interestingly, though MacCulloch isn't promoting Christianity as a faith, there is a fair amount of the gospel presented - sadly it is also mixed in with some `works-based' beliefs such as asceticism as a way of `earning' one's way into heaven.MacCulloch is clearly fascinated by the institution and traditions of the church (which often have a tendency towards extra-biblical injunctions), and as such the first disc in the series is geared heavily in this direction.  Like most BBC productions, Christianity is presented in a secular (though respectful) point of view, and is placed on par with other ""world religions"".Starting in Jerusalem, traveling through the Middle East, and even to China, there is a good deal of great footage of historical sites (many of which you just don't tend to see in most documentaries profiling the early church - they tend to go towards Rome.)  Christianity's early interactions with Islam (some of which proved to be surprisingly peaceful) are also explored.This first informative episode runs 60 minutes in length, and subsequent discs offer historical overviews of Christianity in Rome, Orthodoxy, the Reformation, Protestantism, and an episode entitled ""God in Dock"" (don't ask me what this is about!)  From what I've seen of this first disc, A History of Christianity is more respectful of our faith than many secular documentaries that I've seen - taking what Christians say at face value without denigrating it, or speaking against it.  MacCulloch does a good job of keeping the first disc fairly `neutral', if you can say that there is such a thing.I'm certainly interested in watching the rest of the series, and my husband has found this first installment absolutely fascinating!",4,First DVD - Interested in Seeing the Others,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,2928,"['History', 'Christianity', 'six-disc', 'BBC', 'documentary', 'hosted', 'historian', 'Diarmaid', 'MacCulloch', 'author', 'series', 'extensive', 'scholarly', 'history', 'faith', ""'ve"", 'had', 'opportunity', 'review', 'first', 'disc', 'series', 'First', 'Christianity', 'MacCulloch', 'viewers', 'modern-day', 'sites', 'churches', 'path', 'Christianity', 'Jerusalem', 'East.With', 'most', 'being', 'fairly', 'unfamiliar', 'Eastern', 'forms', 'Christianity', 'MacCulloch', 'exploration', 'roots', 'various', 'Orthodox', 'faiths', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'informative', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'primarily', 'documentation', 'spiritual', 'life', 'church', 'theology', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'major', 'doctrinal', 'watersheds', 'are', 'explored.Personally', 'lack', 'division', 'actions', 'beliefs', 'common', 'believers', 'what', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'political', 'machinations', 'opposed', 'faith-based', 'decisions', 'slightly', 'uncomfortable', 'always', 'Admittedly', 'difficult', 'hash', 'out', 'history', 'Christian', 'church', 'only', 'God', 'can', 'truly', 'judge', 'heart', 'motives', 'man', 'Perhaps', 'wading', 'fray', 'place', 'even', 'angels', 'fear', 'tread', 'Interestingly', 'MacCulloch', ""n't"", 'promoting', 'Christianity', 'faith', 'fair', 'amount', 'gospel', 'presented', 'sadly', 'also', 'mixed', 'works-based', 'beliefs', 'such', 'asceticism', 'way', 'earning', 'one', 'way', 'heaven.MacCulloch', 'clearly', 'fascinated', 'institution', 'traditions', 'church', 'often', 'have', 'tendency', 'extra-biblical', 'injunctions', 'such', 'first', 'disc', 'series', 'geared', 'heavily', 'direction', 'most', 'BBC', 'productions', 'Christianity', 'presented', 'secular', 'respectful', 'point', 'view', 'placed', 'par', 'other', 'world', 'religions', '.Starting', 'Jerusalem', 'traveling', 'Middle', 'East', 'even', 'China', 'good', 'deal', 'great', 'footage', 'historical', 'sites', 'many', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'see', 'most', 'documentaries', 'profiling', 'early', 'church', 'tend', 'go', 'towards', 'Rome', 'Christianity', 'early', 'interactions', 'Islam', 'proved', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'peaceful', 'are', 'also', 'explored.This', 'first', 'informative', 'episode', '60', 'minutes', 'length', 'subsequent', 'discs', 'offer', 'historical', 'overviews', 'Christianity', 'Rome', 'Orthodoxy', 'Reformation', 'Protestantism', 'episode', 'entitled', 'God', 'Dock', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'what', 'about', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'disc', 'A', 'History', 'Christianity', 'more', 'respectful', 'faith', 'many', 'secular', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'taking', 'what', 'Christians', 'say', 'face', 'value', 'denigrating', 'speaking', 'MacCulloch', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'first', 'disc', 'fairly', 'neutral', 'can', 'say', 'such', 'thing.I', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'interested', 'watching', 'rest', 'series', 'husband', 'found', 'first', 'installment', 'absolutely', 'fascinating']",N/A
1329493,A2OCXCD2GALADH,B0037ABB6W,Michael Dalton,"[50, 52]","Among other things, A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years shows that seeds planted in youth flower in adulthood. This six-part series, co-produced by the BBC, the Open University and Jerusalem Productions, is hosted and narrated by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of St. John Cross College in Oxford.When MacCulloch's father, an Anglican minister, and his mother took their young son Diarmaid on their explorations of historic churches, they probably never realized they were sowing the seeds of his future. Diarmaid became fascinated with church history and so began his life work, of which this series is a part.Now, instead of his parents leading the way, it is MacCulloch taking viewers through ancient structures and landmarks around the world. Ever the explorer, he searches for meaning in places that hold clues to the past, interviewing local experts and people who provide a diversity of thought.MacCulloch is not only a well-respected historian, but an excellent narrator and a likeable guide. He unashamedly professes his fondness for the Anglican faith, he being the last of three generations of Anglican clergy. If he has a bias, it may be against the western form of Christianity as practiced by the Roman Catholic Church. He seems more charitable toward the eastern wing, exhibited in the Orthodox Church. The good news is that over the course of the six episodes shown below, he gives equal coverage to each of the major branches of the church.1. The First Christianity2. Catholicism: The Unpredictable Rise of Rome3. Orthodoxy: From Empire to Empire4. Reformation: The Individual Before God5. Protestantism: The Evangelical Explosion6. God in the DockOne of the highlights is that MacCulloch tells more than just the same old story. He is not afraid to correct conventional wisdom and to bring out what might be overlooked. For example, he believes that Christianity stayed closer to its Middle-Eastern roots than many people realize. To illustrate that point, rather than initially tracing the spread of the faith to Rome, he takes the eastern road, which goes from Jerusalem to Asia, including parts of China.In another segment, he takes us to Skellig Michael, a place that might be overlooked by many historians, but significant because this remote island was a center for the monastic life of Irish Christian monks for 600 years. Equally interesting is his account of Russian history and orthodoxy.Filmed in HD, everything about the production is first-rate. This is no surprise given that the series is licensed by the BBC.For all its merits, it falters somewhat in the last episode. Calling himself a ""candid friend"" rather than a Christian, MacCulloch asserts that the church failed to resist the Nazis. He reasons that since the Jews were considered killers of Christ and enemies of the church, the church is ""implicated in the murder of Jews.""It gets even more controversial in his interview with Rev. Nicholas Holtam of St. Martin Church-in-the-Fields, London. MacCulloch believes that questions about gender and sexuality present significant challenges to the church. He identifies himself as a gay man, and in response to an inquiry from MacCulloch, Rev. Holtam states, ""The Scriptures don't say anything about faithful, same-sex relationships and therefore, what's condemned in Scripture isn't what we are dealing with now.... I think the Bible's answer is that what matters between human beings is loving, faithful, honest relationships.""It should be noted that MacCulloch does not accept the authority of the Scriptures. He alludes to being unconvinced that the Bible is different from all other books.Throughout the series, MacCulloch continually emphasizes that the Church has survived by its ability to adapt. He may wonder if the Church will successfully adjust to changing gender and sexual norms. Conservative Christians must be prepared to discuss these concluding ideas if they want to use this in a group setting. Unfortunately, this last segment detracts from the overall excellence of the series. Even so, this production provides a thought-provoking overview of Church history, and I give MacCulloch credit for telling it like he sees it.",4,A candid friend tells the story of the Church,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,4271,"['other', 'things', 'A', 'History', 'Christianity', 'First', 'Three', 'Thousand', 'Years', 'seeds', 'planted', 'youth', 'flower', 'adulthood', 'six-part', 'series', 'co-produced', 'BBC', 'Open', 'University', 'Jerusalem', 'Productions', 'hosted', 'narrated', 'Diarmaid', 'MacCulloch', 'Professor', 'History', 'Church', 'University', 'Oxford', 'Fellow', 'St.', 'John', 'Cross', 'College', 'Oxford.When', 'MacCulloch', 'father', 'Anglican', 'minister', 'mother', 'took', 'young', 'son', 'Diarmaid', 'explorations', 'historic', 'churches', 'probably', 'never', 'realized', 'were', 'sowing', 'seeds', 'future', 'Diarmaid', 'became', 'fascinated', 'church', 'history', 'so', 'began', 'life', 'work', 'series', 'part.Now', 'instead', 'parents', 'leading', 'way', 'MacCulloch', 'taking', 'viewers', 'ancient', 'structures', 'landmarks', 'world', 'Ever', 'explorer', 'meaning', 'places', 'hold', 'clues', 'past', 'interviewing', 'local', 'experts', 'people', 'who', 'provide', 'diversity', 'thought.MacCulloch', 'not', 'only', 'well-respected', 'historian', 'excellent', 'narrator', 'likeable', 'guide', 'unashamedly', 'fondness', 'Anglican', 'faith', 'being', 'last', 'three', 'generations', 'Anglican', 'clergy', 'bias', 'may', 'be', 'western', 'form', 'Christianity', 'practiced', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'more', 'charitable', 'eastern', 'wing', 'exhibited', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'good', 'news', 'course', 'six', 'episodes', 'shown', 'equal', 'coverage', 'major', 'branches', 'church.1', 'First', 'Christianity2', 'Catholicism', 'Unpredictable', 'Rise', 'Rome3', 'Orthodoxy', 'From', 'Empire', 'Empire4', 'Reformation', 'Individual', 'Before', 'God5', 'Protestantism', 'Evangelical', 'Explosion6', 'God', 'DockOne', 'highlights', 'MacCulloch', 'more', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'not', 'afraid', 'correct', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'bring', 'out', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'overlooked', 'example', 'Christianity', 'stayed', 'closer', 'Middle-Eastern', 'roots', 'many', 'people', 'realize', 'illustrate', 'point', 'rather', 'initially', 'tracing', 'spread', 'faith', 'Rome', 'eastern', 'road', 'Jerusalem', 'Asia', 'including', 'parts', 'China.In', 'segment', 'Skellig', 'Michael', 'place', 'might', 'be', 'overlooked', 'many', 'historians', 'significant', 'remote', 'island', 'was', 'center', 'monastic', 'life', 'Irish', 'Christian', 'monks', '600', 'years', 'Equally', 'interesting', 'account', 'Russian', 'history', 'orthodoxy.Filmed', 'HD', 'everything', 'production', 'first-rate', 'surprise', 'given', 'series', 'licensed', 'BBC.For', 'merits', 'somewhat', 'last', 'episode', 'Calling', 'candid', 'friend', 'rather', 'Christian', 'MacCulloch', 'church', 'failed', 'resist', 'Nazis', 'reasons', 'Jews', 'were', 'considered', 'killers', 'Christ', 'enemies', 'church', 'church', 'implicated', 'murder', 'Jews', 'even', 'more', 'controversial', 'interview', 'Rev', 'Nicholas', 'Holtam', 'St.', 'Martin', 'Church-in-the-Fields', 'London', 'MacCulloch', 'questions', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'present', 'significant', 'challenges', 'church', 'gay', 'man', 'response', 'inquiry', 'MacCulloch', 'Rev', 'Holtam', 'states', 'Scriptures', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'faithful', 'same-sex', 'relationships', 'therefore', 'what', 'condemned', 'Scripture', ""n't"", 'what', 'are', 'dealing', 'now', 'think', 'Bible', 'answer', 'what', 'human', 'beings', 'loving', 'faithful', 'honest', 'relationships', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'MacCulloch', 'not', 'accept', 'authority', 'Scriptures', 'being', 'unconvinced', 'Bible', 'different', 'other', 'series', 'MacCulloch', 'continually', 'Church', 'survived', 'ability', 'adapt', 'may', 'wonder', 'Church', 'will', 'successfully', 'adjust', 'changing', 'gender', 'sexual', 'norms', 'Conservative', 'Christians', 'must', 'be', 'prepared', 'discuss', 'concluding', 'ideas', 'want', 'use', 'group', 'setting', 'Unfortunately', 'last', 'segment', 'detracts', 'overall', 'excellence', 'series', 'Even', 'so', 'production', 'thought-provoking', 'overview', 'Church', 'history', 'give', 'MacCulloch', 'credit', 'telling']",N/A
1329494,A8N3FYDA2VUYY,B0037ABB6W,"Pirate2240 ""Kat""","[3, 7]","A History of Christianity - The First Three Thousand YearsDVD 6 Part Documentary from BBCFor those of you that know me, know how much I love history and anything that pertains to it. I was so fortunate to be provided with a complimentary DVD by B & B Media Group to review the first episode of this amazing DVD series. The DVD is titled ""The First Christianity"".A History of Christianity, a six-part series presented by Diarmaid MacCulloch, an Oxford history professor whose books about Cranmer and the Reformation have been acllaimed as masterpieces. A History of Christianity will reveal the true origins of Christianity and delve into what it means to be a Christian. Intelligent, thought-provoking and magisterial in its scope the series will reveal how a small Jewish sect that preached humility became the biggest religion in the world.In Episode 1 - The First Christianity, Professor MacCulloch goes in search across of Christianity's forgotten origins. He overturns the familiar story that it all began when the apostle Paul took Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome. Instead, he shows that the true origins of Christianity lie east, and that at one point it was poised to triumph in Asia, maybe even in China. The headquarters of Christianity may well have been in Baghdad not Rome. And if that had happened Western Christianity would have been very different.In viewing this 60 minute DVD I kept an open mind to the information that Professor MacCulloch details. He takes you from where Paul left off when he carried Jesus' message to Rome and instead followed the growth of Christianity into the east to see if it did in fact exist. What he found there was pretty amazing. He shows evidence of Christianity in Syria, Baghdad and even China before most of the religious wars had taken place.One of the most interesting arguments in this DVD from Christians is the explaination of Jesus. Was He God? Was He just a man? Or was He as we, believe both? If so, how can a perfect being like God, create a human to dwell among us and still be part God?The best explaination I have heard is simply this. Take a glass and call the glass Jesus.Add water which represent his Divine Godly nature to the glass. Add some oil which is the part of Jesus that is now a human. This explains it. Jesus as both God and Man but still Jesus.Some like it seen another way in which you take the glass and call it Jesus. Add water which represents his Divine Nature but this time also add wine to it. This represent Jesus as a human. Now mix them together. You can no longer see them as separate but we know that both the water and wine are together, just like the divine nature was combined with the human flesh known as Jesus.If you are interested in more information about the DVD series or even where to purchase it, please click on the link below:A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years 6 DVD Set presented by Diarmaid MacCullochMarch 2010[...]",5,Understanding the true origins of Christianity,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,2951,"['History', 'Christianity', 'First', 'Three', 'Thousand', 'YearsDVD', '6', 'Part', 'Documentary', 'BBCFor', 'know', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'history', 'anything', 'was', 'so', 'fortunate', 'be', 'provided', 'complimentary', 'DVD', 'B', 'B', 'Media', 'Group', 'review', 'first', 'episode', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'series', 'DVD', 'titled', 'First', 'Christianity', '.A', 'History', 'Christianity', 'six-part', 'series', 'presented', 'Diarmaid', 'MacCulloch', 'Oxford', 'history', 'professor', 'books', 'Cranmer', 'Reformation', 'have', 'been', 'acllaimed', 'masterpieces', 'History', 'Christianity', 'will', 'reveal', 'true', 'origins', 'Christianity', 'delve', 'what', 'be', 'Christian', 'Intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'magisterial', 'scope', 'series', 'will', 'reveal', 'how', 'small', 'Jewish', 'sect', 'preached', 'humility', 'became', 'biggest', 'religion', 'world.In', 'Episode', '1', 'First', 'Christianity', 'Professor', 'MacCulloch', 'search', 'Christianity', 'forgotten', 'origins', 'familiar', 'story', 'began', 'when', 'apostle', 'Paul', 'took', 'Christianity', 'Jerusalem', 'Rome', 'Instead', 'true', 'origins', 'Christianity', 'lie', 'east', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'poised', 'triumph', 'Asia', 'maybe', 'even', 'China', 'headquarters', 'Christianity', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Baghdad', 'not', 'Rome', 'had', 'happened', 'Western', 'Christianity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'different.In', 'viewing', '60', 'minute', 'DVD', 'kept', 'open', 'mind', 'information', 'Professor', 'MacCulloch', 'details', 'where', 'Paul', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'carried', 'Jesus', 'message', 'Rome', 'instead', 'followed', 'growth', 'Christianity', 'east', 'see', 'did', 'fact', 'exist', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'evidence', 'Christianity', 'Syria', 'Baghdad', 'even', 'China', 'most', 'religious', 'wars', 'had', 'taken', 'place.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'arguments', 'DVD', 'Christians', 'explaination', 'Jesus', 'Was', 'God', 'Was', 'just', 'man', 'was', 'believe', 'so', 'how', 'can', 'perfect', 'being', 'God', 'create', 'human', 'dwell', 'still', 'be', 'part', 'God', 'best', 'explaination', 'have', 'heard', 'simply', 'Take', 'glass', 'call', 'glass', 'Jesus.Add', 'water', 'represent', 'Divine', 'Godly', 'nature', 'glass', 'Add', 'oil', 'part', 'Jesus', 'now', 'human', 'Jesus', 'God', 'Man', 'still', 'Jesus.Some', 'seen', 'way', 'take', 'glass', 'call', 'Jesus', 'Add', 'water', 'Divine', 'Nature', 'time', 'also', 'add', 'wine', 'represent', 'Jesus', 'human', 'Now', 'together', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'separate', 'know', 'water', 'wine', 'are', 'together', 'just', 'divine', 'nature', 'was', 'combined', 'human', 'flesh', 'known', 'Jesus.If', 'are', 'interested', 'more', 'information', 'DVD', 'series', 'even', 'where', 'purchase', 'please', 'click', 'link', 'History', 'Christianity', 'First', 'Three', 'Thousand', '6', 'DVD', 'Set', 'presented', 'Diarmaid', 'MacCullochMarch', '2010', '[', ']']",N/A

I have always been grateful for this generosity, and I am trying to improve at being consistent in taking the time to thank these wonderfully giving individuals in a public forum. I really appreciate your time, effort and expense in making a reviewer copy available to me.In ""The First Christianity"", Episode 1 of ""A History of Christianity:  The First Three Thousand Years"", Diarmaid MacCulloch educates the viewer about the beginnings of Christianity.  This DVD runs about an hour and is filled with lots of terrific on location footage in the Middle East where Christianity was born.  There are also several fact-gathering interviews that provide informative insight about traditions and locations.  MacCulloch explains the affects of faith on culture and vise versa.  It really got me thinking about how the Christian church should look throughout the world in order to fulfill Christ's prayer in John 17 for unity.  I believe that we really do need to get back to the roots of the faith, and over our denominational differences.  We need to understand scripture so that we can be obedient, and to do that, we must understand where Christianity came from.This is only the first of several disks in this enlightening series.
