He doesn't look the part and Karloff doesn't hide his English accent. The plot of the film begins with a businessman coming to Wong for help. He feels he is in danger but can't explain why or from whom. Wong doesn't get a chance to start investigating before the man drops dead in his office the next day. His business partners are obvious suspects as they have all just signed a document giving ownership to the other two if one dies. There is another suspect, Carl Roemer, who has developed a formula that he believes the dead man stole from him. Just before the man died, Roemer had threatened him with a gun.The police investigate working with Wong which is good because the police in this movie were as dumb as bricks. The other business partners die one by one which leaves Roemer as the only viable suspect but it takes Wong to figure out the clever way he killed them when they always died alone, locked in a room.This movie is another one of those enjoyable to watch but nothing spectacular movies. The plot is just interesting enough to make you want to see how it all turns out.",3,Just interesting enough to keep watching,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",2013,1220,"['Boris', 'Karloff', 'James', 'Lee', 'Wong', 'Chinese', 'private', 'detective', 'Little', 'done', 'convince', 'Chinese', 'apart', 'name', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', 'Karloff', ""n't"", 'hide', 'English', 'accent', 'plot', 'film', 'businessman', 'coming', 'Wong', 'help', 'danger', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'whom', 'Wong', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'start', 'investigating', 'man', 'dead', 'office', 'next', 'day', 'business', 'partners', 'are', 'obvious', 'suspects', 'have', 'just', 'signed', 'document', 'giving', 'ownership', 'other', 'two', 'one', 'suspect', 'Carl', 'Roemer', 'who', 'developed', 'formula', 'dead', 'man', 'stole', 'Just', 'man', 'died', 'Roemer', 'had', 'threatened', 'gun.The', 'police', 'investigate', 'working', 'Wong', 'good', 'police', 'movie', 'were', 'as', 'dumb', 'bricks', 'other', 'business', 'partners', 'die', 'one', 'one', 'Roemer', 'only', 'viable', 'suspect', 'Wong', 'figure', 'out', 'clever', 'way', 'killed', 'when', 'always', 'died', 'alone', 'locked', 'room.This', 'movie', 'one', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'movies', 'plot', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'out']",N/A

1113547,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000X7SCUA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","Having been the guest star in &quot;Charlie Chan at the Opera,&quot; Boris Karloff takes his own turn at being a brilliant Chinese detective in &quot;Mr. Wong, Detective,&quot; in an obvious effort by Monogram, a poverty row studio, to capitalize on the popular Charlie Chan series.  When Simon Dayton (John Hamilton), a chemical manufacturer in San Francisco receives anonymous death threats after his company begins making poision gas, he seeks the help of James Lee Wong. Of course, the next day the man is killed by his own gas, quickly followed by two of his business partners. Soon Mr. Wong and Police Captain Street (Grant Withers) are on the trail of a group of foreign spies who want to steal the formula for the poison gas.This is an okay mystery of this type and I really thought they came up with a rather ingenious way of delivering the poison gas (remember the fear that people had of such a weapon after World War I). The plot is better than the acting, but that is standard for a film put out by Monogram (they did sixteen John Wayne B Westerns earlier in the decade).  This 1938 film was directed by William Nigh and is based on the stories of Hugh Wiley, and gave Karloff something to do besides monster movies. You do not really buy that he is Chinese, but he does bring a certain dignity to the role, which is nice to see given the time when this film was made.Ironically, while the Mr. Wong films were made to capitalize on the success of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto, &quot;Mr. Wong, Detective&quot; was remade in 1948 as a Charlie Chan film, &quot;Docks of New Orleans&quot; (when Monogram finally bought the rights to the series they apparently had no money left to buy a new script).  There were six Mr. Wong films, all made relatively quickly and cheaply.  As you would expect, if you have seen one you have essentially seen them all.  They are minor diversions at best.",3,Boris Karloff's first case as detective James Lee Wong,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,1893,"['Having', 'been', 'guest', 'star', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'Opera', 'quot', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'own', 'turn', 'being', 'brilliant', 'Chinese', 'detective', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'Detective', 'quot', 'obvious', 'effort', 'Monogram', 'poverty', 'row', 'studio', 'capitalize', 'popular', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'series', 'When', 'Simon', 'Dayton', 'John', 'Hamilton', 'chemical', 'manufacturer', 'San', 'Francisco', 'anonymous', 'death', 'threats', 'company', 'making', 'poision', 'gas', 'help', 'James', 'Lee', 'Wong', 'course', 'next', 'day', 'man', 'killed', 'own', 'gas', 'quickly', 'followed', 'two', 'business', 'partners', 'Soon', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'Police', 'Captain', 'Street', 'Grant', 'Withers', 'are', 'trail', 'group', 'foreign', 'spies', 'who', 'want', 'steal', 'formula', 'poison', 'gas.This', 'okay', 'mystery', 'type', 'really', 'thought', 'came', 'up', 'rather', 'ingenious', 'way', 'delivering', 'poison', 'gas', 'remember', 'fear', 'people', 'had', 'such', 'weapon', 'World', 'War', 'plot', 'better', 'acting', 'standard', 'film', 'put', 'out', 'Monogram', 'did', 'sixteen', 'John', 'Wayne', 'B', 'Westerns', 'earlier', 'decade', '1938', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'William', 'Nigh', 'based', 'stories', 'Hugh', 'Wiley', 'gave', 'Karloff', 'something', 'do', 'besides', 'monster', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'buy', 'Chinese', 'bring', 'certain', 'dignity', 'role', 'nice', 'see', 'given', 'time', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made.Ironically', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'capitalize', 'success', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'Mr.', 'Moto', 'quot', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'Detective', 'quot', 'was', 'remade', '1948', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'film', 'quot', 'Docks', 'New', 'Orleans', 'quot', 'when', 'Monogram', 'finally', 'bought', 'rights', 'series', 'apparently', 'had', 'money', 'left', 'buy', 'new', 'script', 'were', 'six', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'films', 'made', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'cheaply', 'would', 'expect', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'have', 'essentially', 'seen', 'are', 'minor', 'diversions', 'best']",N/A
