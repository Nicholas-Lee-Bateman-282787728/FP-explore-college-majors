1423930,A1GDVEPEQ9APM,B004Q4XZ5I,CNS,"[0, 0]","I'm a die hard L&O; fan (I own the whole series on dvd), but this movie passed by on tv before I got a chance to see it.  So I was really looking forward to checking out the only movie of the franchise.  But after finally watching it, I can now tell why there is only one.  This movie is just dull, plain and simple.  It moves at an amazingly slow pace, focuses way too much on Mike Logan's personal life (including a ridiculous side-story where he hooks up with a witness to his case completely out of the blue), and doesn't have anywhere nearly enough roles for all the characters it insists on including.This movie features quite a few familiar faces from the franchise, including Jerry Orbach, Ben Bratt, S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Watterston, and Dann Florek.  But it gives them practically nothing to do.  Out of all the aforementioned actors, Florek (Capt Cragen) is literally the only one with a vital role in the case.  The others are just sort of hanging out just for the purpose of being seen, and for some, the neglect they get is just shameful.  Watterston is limited to just a single scene where he argues with Logan about forming a special task force for the case, and that's it.  You just get the feeling all these characters were thrown in just for the sake of making the viewer feel at home in the law or order universe.To some extent, that's actually understandable, as this brings up another key flaw with the film:  It doesn't feel anything like a Law and Order production at all!  The classic Law and Order theme song is totally absent from the movie, as well as the classic ""chung chung"" (or however you pronounce it) jump cuts between locations.  There's also no district attorney segment in the film at all!  The offender is not shown being prosecuted, so the DA characters (with the slight exception for Watterson in his dinky little scene) are completely left out.  How on earth could they do such a thing?  The core of Law and Order is its half police investigation/half DA prosecution format.  When they completely leave out the DA/prosecution segment, it totally butchers anything that might have resembled a Law and Order production at all.But even if I were to overlook the total neglect of the DA aspect (which is impossible), the police investigation is pretty lame on its own merit.  There is very little suspense due to the slow pacing, and most of the evidence is found very early on.  Combine that with a very small pool of potential suspects, and basically all the happens is the show just sort of spins its wheels aimlessly until Logan is able to put the evidence he originally discovered into good use.  The key lead that breaks the case is open is a simple lab report on something found at the initial crime scene.  So really Logan didn't have to do anything to solve the case.  He could have simply hung out with his old detective buddies (which is what he spends most of his time doing) until the lab report came back without doing any real police work and he still would have solved the closed the case just as effectively.If ""Exiled"" was a Law and Order episode, I'd call it one of the worst ever made.  It's just boring, poorly paced, and simply doesn't feel like it belongs in the franchise.  Really, how could it belong when one of the most vital aspects of the original show is completely left out?  This was supposed to provide proper closure for Chris Noth's character, but all it did was make him look way worse.I swear this film must have had Max Greevey spinning in his grave.",2,"Slow, Drawn out, overly simplistic, and doesn't feel one bit like a part of the franchise",1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,3529,"[""'m"", 'die', 'hard', 'L', 'O', 'fan', 'own', 'whole', 'series', 'dvd', 'movie', 'passed', 'tv', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'checking', 'out', 'only', 'movie', 'franchise', 'finally', 'watching', 'can', 'now', 'tell', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'dull', 'plain', 'simple', 'amazingly', 'slow', 'pace', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Mike', 'Logan', 'personal', 'life', 'including', 'ridiculous', 'side-story', 'where', 'up', 'witness', 'case', 'completely', 'blue', ""n't"", 'have', 'anywhere', 'nearly', 'enough', 'roles', 'characters', 'including.This', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'familiar', 'franchise', 'including', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Ben', 'Bratt', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'Sam', 'Watterston', 'Dann', 'Florek', 'practically', 'nothing', 'do', 'Out', 'aforementioned', 'actors', 'Florek', 'Capt', 'Cragen', 'literally', 'only', 'one', 'vital', 'role', 'case', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'sort', 'hanging', 'out', 'just', 'purpose', 'being', 'seen', 'neglect', 'get', 'just', 'shameful', 'Watterston', 'limited', 'just', 'single', 'scene', 'where', 'Logan', 'forming', 'special', 'task', 'force', 'case', 'just', 'get', 'feeling', 'characters', 'were', 'thrown', 'just', 'sake', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'home', 'law', 'order', 'universe.To', 'extent', 'actually', 'understandable', 'up', 'key', 'flaw', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'Law', 'Order', 'production', 'classic', 'Law', 'Order', 'theme', 'song', 'totally', 'absent', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'chung', 'chung', 'however', 'pronounce', 'jump', 'cuts', 'locations', 'also', 'district', 'attorney', 'segment', 'film', 'offender', 'not', 'shown', 'being', 'prosecuted', 'DA', 'characters', 'slight', 'exception', 'Watterson', 'dinky', 'little', 'scene', 'are', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'How', 'earth', 'could', 'do', 'thing', 'core', 'Law', 'Order', 'half', 'police', 'investigation/half', 'DA', 'prosecution', 'format', 'When', 'completely', 'leave', 'out', 'DA/prosecution', 'segment', 'totally', 'anything', 'might', 'have', 'resembled', 'Law', 'Order', 'production', 'all.But', 'even', 'were', 'overlook', 'total', 'neglect', 'DA', 'aspect', 'impossible', 'police', 'investigation', 'pretty', 'lame', 'own', 'merit', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'due', 'slow', 'pacing', 'most', 'evidence', 'found', 'very', 'early', 'Combine', 'very', 'small', 'pool', 'potential', 'suspects', 'basically', 'happens', 'show', 'just', 'sort', 'spins', 'wheels', 'aimlessly', 'Logan', 'able', 'put', 'evidence', 'originally', 'discovered', 'good', 'use', 'key', 'lead', 'case', 'open', 'simple', 'lab', 'report', 'something', 'found', 'initial', 'crime', 'scene', 'So', 'really', 'Logan', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'solve', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'hung', 'out', 'old', 'detective', 'buddies', 'what', 'most', 'time', 'doing', 'lab', 'report', 'came', 'back', 'doing', 'real', 'police', 'work', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'solved', 'closed', 'case', 'just', 'effectively.If', 'Exiled', 'was', 'Law', 'Order', 'episode', ""'d"", 'call', 'one', 'worst', 'ever', 'made', 'just', 'boring', 'poorly', 'paced', 'simply', ""n't"", 'feel', 'franchise', 'Really', 'how', 'could', 'belong', 'when', 'one', 'most', 'vital', 'aspects', 'original', 'show', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'supposed', 'provide', 'proper', 'closure', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'character', 'did', 'was', 'make', 'look', 'way', 'worse.I', 'swear', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'Max', 'Greevey', 'spinning', 'grave']",N/A
