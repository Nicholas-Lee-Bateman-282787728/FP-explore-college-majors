236680,A33FCLUEQSUD68,630027036X,Claire,"[0, 0]","I got this dvd used but it seemed brand new and was only about $2 plus about $4 for s/h. It arrived promptly within like 2 days. I'm so glad I got it used since the Amazon price for new was almost $40 and definitely not worth that much. I had been curious to see this movie but have never seen it ever come on tv so decided just to buy it used and cheap.This was a cute sweet little movie. It was touching but a little sad. It is probably one of the more realistic storylines, though, for a Goldie Hawn movie. She plays Kay, a sweet, quirky officer's wife who goes to work while her husband fights in World War II. She, like many other women during that time, goes to work in a factory filling in for the men who are off at war. She is romanced by a man named Lucky who is her superior at work and also befriended by a neighbor named Hazel who, up until that time had been the brunt of jokes from Kay's husband.This is the movie that led to Goldie Hawn's romantic real-life involvement with Kurt Russell. I didn't find him to be the charmer he usually plays but their relationship is believable after he finally convinces her to acknowledge it. At first Kay resists his advances saying she's married but then after several months gives in and seems to fall hopelessly in love with him. Needless to say, her husband then surprises her by coming home unannounced. I won't give anything more away but I will say that I was not too thrilled with the ending.Goldie Hawn did a great job and manages to play her character with vulnerability as well as believability. Like I said, Kurt Russell is not his usual charming self but is still believable as the feisty musician Lucky. (I read Kevin Costner was wanted for this role but was unavailable.) Great supporting work here from Christine Lahti who plays Kay's wild singer friend Hazel. Ed Harris plays Kay's husband and Holly Hunter also has a small role. Carly Simon sings the opening theme song.I read in Goldie Hawn's memoir that this movie was completely different when it was first made but that the producers and Goldie were not happy with Jonathan Demme's direction so it was almost completely re-shot.

236682,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,630027036X,Deborah Earle,"[23, 29]","""Swing Shift"" has proven to be a marvelous nostalgia trip for those who remember the '40s, and for those self-proclaimed nostalgia buffs like myself who enjoy the music of the era.Goldie Hawn has a childlike innocence as a housewife to Ed Harris in a working class neighborhood in 1941 California. Jack and Kay Walsh deal with Jack's having to work on Saturdays, a rather vampy neighbor at whom they make derogatory remarks when they see her going to work, and enjoy time at the roller rink.While they are at the roller rink, the attack on Pearl Harbor is announced and their world changes. Jack enlists in the Navy and Kay decides to work as riveter, who helps to build airplanes at a local munitions plant.She develops an antagonistic relationship with her neighbor, Hazel(Christine Lahti), the singer-turned riveter, whom she and her husband used to taunt, and an even closer relationship with a plant worker named Lucky (Kurt Russell)who repeatedly invites her out to hear him play his trumpet at a club leading to gossip and speculation about their relationship among their co-workers.During the course of the film, we see the reluctance of the women's male co-workers to accept them as equals in the workplace, and one of the male instructors gets a little too familiar with Hazel while instructing her on how to drill.The unspoken problem in all this is the women's inability to defend themselves against sexual harrassment in the workplace  at that time. In modern times, Lucky never would have been able to make the kind of advances that he made towards her in this film, at least not without Kay filing a complaint. This film suggests that such situations may have been common back then, largely because of this fact.It leads a viewer to wonder how many affairs between the female swingshifters and their male counterparts took place at that time, regardless of the marital status of either of them.But we share the triumphs as well as the tragedies of the swing shifters; Holly Hunter, as Jeanne Sherman, receives her husband's death notice while at work, but later gives the audience a lesson in how life can go on afterwards.Jack discovers his wife's affair when he comes home on furlough, and is heartbroken. As Kay tries to figure out how best to resolve the situation, Hazel and Lucky begin a dallience of their own after Hazel's relationship with her former boss appears to be over.After the inevitable fight between the two women, they avoid each other at work. Lucky gets his big break as a musician, and leaves the plant, which makes it easier for Hazel and Kay to eventually make peace with each other.I found this film--a counterpart to that other portrayal of life in World War II California, ""Racing With the Moon"", which was released the same year--to be a fine tribute the the women who helped win World War II--to their endurance of heartache and sacrifice, demeaning treatment, the realism of the marginalized  treatment of the African American women at the plant, and the support that women in general can give each other in times of crisis. When Kay is promoted after saving a co-worker's life,  we see how the men begin to respect their female co-workers for their intelligence. Interestingly, these themes were later echoed in the 1992 film, ""A League of Their Own"".Sadly, these women had to give up their jobs once the men returned home from the war. But those who see this film should come to appreciate the way the women of this era paved the way for equality in the workplace.",5,The Unspoken Issue,1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,3512,"['Swing', 'Shift', 'proven', 'be', 'marvelous', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'who', 'remember', ""'40s"", 'self-proclaimed', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'who', 'enjoy', 'music', 'era.Goldie', 'Hawn', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'housewife', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'working', 'class', 'neighborhood', '1941', 'California', 'Jack', 'Kay', 'Walsh', 'deal', 'Jack', 'having', 'work', 'Saturdays', 'rather', 'vampy', 'neighbor', 'whom', 'make', 'derogatory', 'remarks', 'when', 'see', 'going', 'work', 'enjoy', 'time', 'roller', 'rink.While', 'are', 'roller', 'rink', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'announced', 'world', 'changes', 'Jack', 'Navy', 'Kay', 'work', 'riveter', 'who', 'build', 'airplanes', 'local', 'munitions', 'plant.She', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'neighbor', 'Hazel', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'singer-turned', 'riveter', 'whom', 'husband', 'used', 'taunt', 'even', 'closer', 'relationship', 'plant', 'worker', 'named', 'Lucky', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'out', 'hear', 'play', 'trumpet', 'club', 'leading', 'gossip', 'speculation', 'relationship', 'co-workers.During', 'course', 'film', 'see', 'reluctance', 'women', 'male', 'co-workers', 'accept', 'equals', 'workplace', 'one', 'male', 'instructors', 'little', 'too', 'familiar', 'Hazel', 'instructing', 'how', 'drill.The', 'unspoken', 'problem', 'women', 'inability', 'defend', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'workplace', 'time', 'modern', 'times', 'Lucky', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'kind', 'advances', 'made', 'towards', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'Kay', 'filing', 'complaint', 'film', 'such', 'situations', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'common', 'back', 'then', 'largely', 'fact.It', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'affairs', 'female', 'swingshifters', 'male', 'counterparts', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'regardless', 'marital', 'status', 'them.But', 'share', 'triumphs', 'as', 'well', 'tragedies', 'swing', 'shifters', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'Jeanne', 'Sherman', 'husband', 'death', 'notice', 'work', 'later', 'audience', 'lesson', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'go', 'afterwards.Jack', 'discovers', 'wife', 'affair', 'when', 'home', 'furlough', 'heartbroken', 'Kay', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'best', 'resolve', 'situation', 'Hazel', 'Lucky', 'begin', 'dallience', 'own', 'Hazel', 'relationship', 'former', 'boss', 'be', 'over.After', 'inevitable', 'fight', 'two', 'women', 'avoid', 'other', 'work', 'Lucky', 'big', 'break', 'musician', 'plant', 'easier', 'Hazel', 'Kay', 'eventually', 'make', 'peace', 'other.I', 'found', 'film', 'counterpart', 'other', 'portrayal', 'life', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'California', 'Racing', 'Moon', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'be', 'fine', 'tribute', 'women', 'who', 'helped', 'win', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'endurance', 'heartache', 'sacrifice', 'demeaning', 'treatment', 'realism', 'marginalized', 'treatment', 'African', 'American', 'women', 'plant', 'support', 'women', 'general', 'can', 'give', 'other', 'times', 'crisis', 'When', 'Kay', 'promoted', 'saving', 'co-worker', 'life', 'see', 'how', 'men', 'begin', 'respect', 'female', 'co-workers', 'intelligence', 'Interestingly', 'themes', 'were', 'later', 'echoed', '1992', 'film', 'League', 'Their', 'Own', '.Sadly', 'women', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'jobs', 'men', 'returned', 'home', 'war', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'should', 'come', 'appreciate', 'way', 'women', 'era', 'paved', 'way', 'equality', 'workplace']",N/A

Produced in 1984, SWING SHIFT tells the story of a young woman (Goldie Hawn), who begins working in an airplane factory soon after her husband (Ed Harris) joins the U.S. Navy in December of 1941. She is tempted to indulge in an illicit affair with her foreman at the factory (Kurt Russell), while knowing full well that this would be wrong and inexcusable behavior. I won't reveal the plot for you, in case you have a chance to see this interesting film, but the acting is believable, the dialogue sounds natural, and the period detail is convincing. These characters seem like real people. I enjoyed it very much and found funny girl Goldie Hawn to be a talented and likeable dramatic actress.
