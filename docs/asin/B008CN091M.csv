So, she would get the songs stuck in her head and then prance around like a Princess.We got the movie from Redbox after WEEKS of begging from my daughter. I can't stand Barbie. And as opposed to Barbie DOLLS as I am, the movies actually aren't too bad. I was able to watch it twice. My daughter on the other hand, watched it a bazillion times!So, when this movie went on sale for $5 on amazon, I scooped it up.

1550195,A1FQAQO2VKWRN,B008CN091M,Andy,"[1, 2]","When this movie was announced, I was concerned and a bit put off by the similarity in concept to Princess and the Pauper, which I thought had been done quite well and did not need any sort of make over.  In fact, I had no intention of buying it either, but rather put myself on a list at the library to wait for my turn to check it out.  There are a lot of reviews that touch on plot, I'm really not, because this is directed more at buyers who may also be unsure if they want to purchase this given the potential similarities with Princess and the Pauper.Having seen the movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  Though both movies have their origin in the same Mark Twain novel (The Prince and the Pauper) I felt that this movie was different enough to hold it's own as a separate piece of art.  The new songs were catchy.  What other reviewers have noted about the reuse of some songs is true, however this is a tried and true Hollywood formula that has been used so much it didn't bother me...some Irving Berlin songs for example have appeared time and time again in movies, like the one about the Easter Bonnet and then there is White Christmas. And a certain Smash Mouth song keeps cropping up in movies also... Plus, it was believable under the context of a Pop Star...many bands do cover songs of other people's music in real life, so I just felt it did not detract from the credibility of the movie.I enjoyed the artistic direction of this piece a lot.  The Graphics on the performance sections were quite sophisticated in their simulation of over the top music videos and productions and I was actually pretty impressed by that.  As an adult, I could say that it would be nice to have the message about embracing your own life made a bit clearer, but this is a movie directed at kids, and so it can be seen as justifiable that it wasn't more substantive in that regard. And once I thought about it, I realized that from a kid's perspective, similarities in plot probably aren't even a concern.  Not that I want to see lots of reused movie concepts...And my daughter did love it.  Overall, it was actually a very charming little movie I thought. I would still really like to see celebrity and materialism embraced less in the Barbie movies, but it wasn't enough of a distraction for me to give it fewer stars.  So if you are sitting on the fence on getting this movie, I think it is worth giving it a try...I think you could end up enjoying it more than you expected.  And your daughters probably won't care about any similarities any more than mine did.",5,A Review For the Fence Sitters,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,2557,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'concerned', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'similarity', 'concept', 'Princess', 'Pauper', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'sort', 'make', 'fact', 'had', 'intention', 'buying', 'either', 'rather', 'put', 'list', 'library', 'wait', 'turn', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'lot', 'reviews', 'touch', 'plot', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'directed', 'more', 'buyers', 'who', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'unsure', 'want', 'purchase', 'given', 'potential', 'similarities', 'Princess', 'Pauper.Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movies', 'have', 'origin', 'same', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'novel', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'enough', 'hold', 'own', 'separate', 'piece', 'art', 'new', 'songs', 'were', 'catchy', 'What', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'reuse', 'songs', 'true', 'however', 'tried', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'songs', 'example', 'have', 'appeared', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'movies', 'one', 'Easter', 'Bonnet', 'then', 'White', 'Christmas', 'certain', 'Smash', 'Mouth', 'song', 'keeps', 'cropping', 'up', 'movies', 'also', 'was', 'believable', 'context', 'Pop', 'Star', 'many', 'bands', 'do', 'cover', 'songs', 'other', 'people', 'music', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'felt', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'credibility', 'movie.I', 'enjoyed', 'artistic', 'direction', 'piece', 'lot', 'Graphics', 'performance', 'sections', 'were', 'quite', 'sophisticated', 'simulation', 'top', 'music', 'videos', 'productions', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'adult', 'could', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'message', 'embracing', 'own', 'life', 'made', 'bit', 'clearer', 'movie', 'directed', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'justifiable', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'substantive', 'regard', 'once', 'thought', 'realized', 'kid', 'perspective', 'similarities', 'plot', 'probably', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'concern', 'Not', 'want', 'see', 'lots', 'reused', 'movie', 'concepts', 'daughter', 'did', 'love', 'Overall', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'charming', 'little', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'still', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'celebrity', 'materialism', 'embraced', 'less', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'distraction', 'give', 'fewer', 'stars', 'So', 'are', 'sitting', 'fence', 'getting', 'movie', 'think', 'worth', 'giving', 'try', 'think', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', 'more', 'expected', 'daughters', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'similarities', 'more', 'mine', 'did']",Barbie: The Princess & The Popstar

This definitely appeals to my daughter - she loves the girly-girl aspect of being a princess, but also the center-stage diva aspect of a singing popstar, to her it's the best of both worlds.The songs are catchy and fun, and as with all of the Barbie movies there's a happy ending as a result of friends helping each other and working as a team.",5,Barbie: The Princess & The Popstar,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,745,"['4', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'almost', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'one', 'far', 'favorite', 'Even', 'fairly', 'new', 'already', 'mostly', 'memorized', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'singing', 'songs', 'day.This', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'unique', 'classic', 'story', ""'princess"", 'problem', 'twist', 'adding', 'popstar', 'story', 'modern', 'clothing', 'songs', 'definitely', 'appeals', 'daughter', 'girly-girl', 'aspect', 'being', 'princess', 'also', 'center-stage', 'diva', 'aspect', 'singing', 'popstar', 'best', 'worlds.The', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'fun', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'happy', 'ending', 'result', 'friends', 'helping', 'other', 'working', 'team']",Barbie: The Princess & The Popstar

Meanwhile, Nikki stars as popstar Keira - who wears a wig in the same tradition of Hannah Montana and is a popstar by day and normal girl by night.  Keira longs to be away from the responsibilities of being a popstar (making the next album, paying her employees, the late and long hours).  Tori is hounded by her Aunt to become a proper and noble princess - but Tori is too full of mischief to be a boring girl like that. With the aid of a magic microphone (Keira) and hair brush (Tori), the girls are able to exchange places and enjoy each other's worlds.The DVD contains all the singing and original songs you expect from the friends' series of Barbie DVDs.  And, of course, that bit of fashion and magic that has come to be the hallmark of the modern Barbie movies.My 9 year old loves each new DVD the best and this one is no exception.

Many reviewers complain about this being a rip-off of Barbie: Princess and the Pauper, but it should be understood that this is not a rip-off, merely a different telling of a classic tale. The pop-style songs in this movie are vastly different than anything in Princess and the Pauper, which had a more traditional Broadway style, so I'm not sure what other reviewers are referring to when they say the same songs are being reused here. Similar themes represented in various songs does not make them the 'same songs', just like the same theme of the movie doesn't make it 'the same movie.' This is a fun, enjoyable movie with a light, pleasant touch. If you are looking for deep, meaningful themes and profound messages, you won't find yourself beaten over the head with them here. This is a fun movie, made for fun, for little girls (and anyone who likes a good movie) to enjoy. As with all of the newer Barbie movies, this is more modern in its overall feel, but happily, still retaining a good traditional foundation. The pop songs are, for me anyway, less enjoyable than the classical music of the early Barbie movies, but while they aren't brilliant, the movie still has a light and easy sense of fun, so if you're not too obsessed with this being the greatest movie of all time, just take it on its own merits and enjoy it for the truly fun movie it is, you'll be thoroughly pleased with it.
