Both films have good picture and sound and the price is just right. Am I imagining things, or has this Double bill attracted more than it's share of sensible, well written, but CONTRASTING opinions as to which is the best film!! Lovely stuff! I go for the ""Oblong Box"" because I feel it's plot is better written and the film has pace in it's editing and direction (it is such a subjective thing - opinions!). Also Price actually has a part which is more than he has in ""Scream..."". Then there is Hilary Dwyer... Her agent should have been sacked! She is the female lead (love and later wife of Vincent), and she is billed about 9th below Uta Levka (6' of screen time) and Sally Geeson as a servant ""slut"" as Lee says. A role almost anyone could have played...better, and she is in it for around 12' possibly. Enough grumbling I hear you say.

Poor Edward went quite mad after being disfigured by a voodoo priest in africa. Fortunately for Edward, he has friends who are willing to aid in his escape. By using more voodoo, they will give Edward the appearance of death and wisk him away at the opportune moment. Unfortunately, these ""friends"" are more interested in money than Ed's freedom. Surprise! Julien decides to nail Edward in his coffin and have a stand-in corpse for the viewing! When Edward is buried, his co-conspirators leave him in the ground! Luckily, some graverobbers are in the area and inadvertantly rescue Edward, taking him to a local doctor (Christopher Lee). The good doctor helps Edward, who dons a red velvet mask and becomes his own avenging angel. This ghoulish gothic is perfct for cold, damp nights! SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN- Vincent is back again as Dr. Browning, a scientist working on secret government experiments with ""composite"" super-humans. One of them runs amok, becoming known as ""the vampire killer"" for his trademark blood-draining of victims. His exploits are a good part of the story, leading police to Dr. Browning's place. Christopher Lee is the government-type who is somehow involved in all the mysterious experiments and cover-ups. Peter Cushing is a tyrannical leader of a militaristic nation, who is in this movie just long enough to be killed by a super-human sadist named Konratz. Konratz is out to put an end to the whole Dr. Browning project, now that the vampire killer has made the headlines. SASA has lots of action and intrigue. There's also a healthy dose of humor throughout the proceedings to keep things fun. Watch for the poor jogger who has a heart attack, only to be taken in by Dr. Browning. Every time he wakes up in his hospital bed, another piece of him is missing! He's a stitch!

705557,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,B000068TPF,Bruce Rux,"[5, 5]","Vincent Price and American International Pictures were at a lull in their respective careers  -  the Dr. Phibes films and Theater of Blood, which revived them both, were just around the corner  -  when these two were churned out.  Neither film is that good, though Scream and Scream Again was quite successful, both critically and commercially, at the time  -  which is ironic, since it's the weaker of the two.Scream and Scream Again is a weak updated Frankenstein ripoff, with Price  -  in virtually nothing more than a cameo role  -  utilizing a synthetic process to graft and reanimate dead tissues into superhuman pseudo-living ""proto-people.""  The plot sounds better than the movie is.  Director Gordon Hessler put plenty of gruesome gore effects and gallons of blood into the mix, but missed the boat (along with screenwriter Christopher Wicking) on plot development  -  the movie is disjointed and often incomprehensible.  I've seen it a couple of times, once even not that long ago, and really couldn't tell you precisely what happens.  Except for the occasional splashes of gore, it just isn't really that memorable.The Oblong Box, directed the preceding year by Hessler, is the better of the two, but still nothing worth writing home about.  Price sells out his brother for fame and fortune while the two are on expedition in Africa, grotesquely disfiguring him and burying him alive.  The brother manages to escape and pursue Price back to England, there to work out his own bit of personal revenge.  The plot and makeup effects are pretty good, but the script is on the plodding side.Christopher Lee is on hand in both films  -  he and Price met, making them  -  but has little more to do than Price in the first.  They both get more action in The Oblong Box.  And Peter Cushing has a role as an ex-Nazi, in Scream and Scream Again.These films are for serious collectors who want a complete  -  or at least representative  -  collection of AIP's or Vincent Price's (or Christopher Lee's, for that matter) output.

Vincent Price plays Sir Julian Markham, an aristocrat, charged with the care of his brother, Edward, who was horribly disfigured in a voodoo ritual as punishment for some apparent crime he committed against the native tribe. Edward's face is messed up, along with his mind, and creates a devious plan to escape from his brother, who keeps him locked away in the attic. Well, the best-laid plans and such...something goes wrong, and Edward gets buried alive, but manages to escape and plots revenge. Christopher Lee has a bit part as an unscrupulous surgeon who performs experiments on freshly dead and buried bodies. The movie seems a little long-winded, and I felt about ten or fifteen minutes could have been shaved off, but no matter. The movie was passable, even though I saw the surprise ending coming a mile away.The second feature was much more difficult to watch. Scream and Scream Again was a big mess of a movie. The first hour of the movie jumps between three different plot threads, and finally gets around to trying to tying them together late into the movie. The first thread involves a man who wakes up in a hospital room and only to find a limb missing. He wakes up at some later point, another limb is missing, and so on...the second thread involves Vincent Price as a doctor and a serial killer...the third involves a plot within a military state (the solders look Nazi in the way they dress, but the insignia is different). I ultimately think this movie was about the creation of a super race of human beings, but the scope of the story was too wide to convey this accurately. As I said, it's difficult to follow this movie until about an hour in, when they start to try and tie the loose plot threads together, but not very successfully. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing make appearances, for like five minutes each, and Vincent price shows up early for a short bit and then at the end for like 15 minutes.The quality on both pictures is pretty good and the audio is not too bad, although on Scream and Scream Again, I felt the dialogue got drowned out by the music at some points, causing it to become muddled. A couple of trailers, and that is it for extras. I like how MGM seems to now be releasing their Midnight Movies in a two for one deal, as if I had paid full price for one of these movies, I would have felt ripped off.",3,TRIPLE DISTILLED HORROR... maybe a little watered down,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,2416,"['Oblong', 'Box', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'deals', 'voodoo', 'revenge', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'plays', 'Sir', 'Julian', 'Markham', 'aristocrat', 'charged', 'care', 'brother', 'Edward', 'who', 'was', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'voodoo', 'ritual', 'punishment', 'apparent', 'crime', 'committed', 'native', 'tribe', 'Edward', 'face', 'messed', 'up', 'mind', 'devious', 'plan', 'escape', 'brother', 'who', 'locked', 'away', 'attic', 'Well', 'best-laid', 'plans', 'such', 'something', 'wrong', 'Edward', 'buried', 'alive', 'escape', 'plots', 'revenge', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'bit', 'part', 'unscrupulous', 'surgeon', 'who', 'experiments', 'freshly', 'dead', 'buried', 'bodies', 'movie', 'little', 'long-winded', 'felt', 'about', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shaved', 'off', 'matter', 'movie', 'was', 'passable', 'even', 'saw', 'surprise', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away.The', 'second', 'feature', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'was', 'big', 'mess', 'movie', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'jumps', 'three', 'different', 'plot', 'threads', 'finally', 'trying', 'tying', 'together', 'late', 'movie', 'first', 'thread', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'hospital', 'room', 'only', 'find', 'limb', 'missing', 'up', 'later', 'point', 'limb', 'missing', 'so', 'second', 'thread', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'doctor', 'serial', 'killer', 'third', 'plot', 'military', 'state', 'solders', 'look', 'Nazi', 'way', 'dress', 'insignia', 'different', 'ultimately', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'creation', 'super', 'race', 'human', 'beings', 'scope', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'wide', 'convey', 'accurately', 'said', 'difficult', 'follow', 'movie', 'hour', 'when', 'start', 'try', 'tie', 'loose', 'plot', 'threads', 'together', 'not', 'very', 'successfully', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'make', 'appearances', 'five', 'minutes', 'Vincent', 'price', 'up', 'early', 'short', 'bit', 'then', 'end', '15', 'minutes.The', 'quality', 'pictures', 'pretty', 'good', 'audio', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'felt', 'dialogue', 'got', 'drowned', 'out', 'music', 'points', 'causing', 'become', 'muddled', 'couple', 'trailers', 'extras', 'how', 'MGM', 'now', 'be', 'releasing', 'Midnight', 'Movies', 'two', 'one', 'deal', 'had', 'paid', 'full', 'price', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'ripped', 'off']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again

The town is vulnerable to vampire killings, replicants that can lift cars with their brute strength, and healthy persons unsuspectingly being decapitated.  This is all very engaging and you can throw in a malevolent organization that reminds you of KAOS from ""Get Smart"" seemingly orchestrating these events.

Honestly, it is probably my least favorite of the Price-Poe movies, but that still means that I enjoy it.  I think that Vincent Price and Christopher Lee are good in their roles, but the movie moves along a little slowly for my taste.  It is an interesting take on the story and real fans of Poe and Price will most likely enjoy it.I hadn't seen Scream and Scream Again until I purchased this DVD.  I was expecting something along the lines of Dr. Phibes or Theater of Blood.  I was a bit surprised when Price only appeared for a couple of minutes in the first hour, but he returns at the end to tie things together albeit loosely.  It did seems strange that one of the longest sections that didn't jump around between different characters involved a long car chase.  Now, I must admit that it is kind of a fun car chase, but it seemed a little long for this movie.  I really don't understand why the police wouldn't shoot the guy after he had attacked several officers, but that's just me.  It definitely has an interesting twist that I don't want to give away.  If you are watching it for Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee I have to give you a warning.  They are both brilliant in their parts, but their screen time is incredibly short.  I doubt that either movie will really scare you, but the stories are interesting enough that I recommend giving them a chance.

705566,A2HYKU8KGHL1SR,B000068TPF,Henry R. Kujawa,"[3, 3]","The opening premise of THE OBLONG BOX is almost identical to the Peter Davison DOCTOR WHO story, ""Black Orchid"".  A man returns from Africa, cursed by tribal magic, disfigured & insane, and kept a prisoner in his own home by his family.  But whereas on the WHO story that was the punch line, here's it's just the springboard.  Said victim secretly pays some friends to help him escape his brother-- Vincent Price-- who comes across as much nicer than most of these films, but all the same seems to be hiding something.  Via more witch doctor ""magic"", the man fakes his own death... but then things go astray.  SERIOUSLY astray.  He's buried alive, then his ""body"" is stolen by grave-robbers in the employ of an unscrupulous medical adventurer. (One expects Peter Cushing in such a role, but NO! --it's Christopher Lee!)  WHY his ""friends"" failed to follow-thru on their plan is a complete mystery to me-- I blame an unpolished script.  It would have been a much more entertaining (and sensible) twist if they'd actually TRIED digging him up only to find the grave-robbers got their FIRST...!  But no.  The result:  in addition to wanting to find out WHY he had a jungle curse put on him, Price's brother now wants REVENGE on everyone involved.  Armed with a mask and a VERY sharp knife, his antics in the film's 2nd half make this seem like a Victorian-era installment of the HALLOWEEN series!!!I understand the late Michael Reeves was scheduled to direct; this may explain why Price, Rupert Davies (DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE) and Hilary Dwyer (CRY OF THE BANSHEE) are all together again following WITCHFINDER GENERAL-- and why there's so much pointless VIOLENCE in the story.  While that film disturbed me in the EXTREME each time I sat thru it, OBLONG BOX is a LOT more ""fun""-- if you can get past the growing number of bodies, most of which were killed in particularly brutal and senseless fashion.  2 interesting things I noticed about this plot, as it goes on nearly every character seems to be BLACKMAILING somebody (it seems EVERYBODY has some secret they don't want known), and the sympathetic-yet-INSANE victim/SLASHER only seems to kill people who've done wrong.  (The sweet, innocent housekeeper gets terrified and dragged thru the woods, but nothing REALLY happens to her!)Interesting cameos to watch for:  Colin Jeavons (Inspector Lestrade on the Jeremy Brett HOLMES series) plays a police inspector, as does Ivor Dean (Inspector Teal on the Roger Moore SAINT series!).With this film, producer Louis M. Heyward & director Gordon Hessler began a string of collaborations, all of which were somewhat iffy.  Like WAR-GODS OF THE DEEP (which Heyward produced) OBLONG BOX feels like the script could have used to fine-tuning.  (WHY did Price do what he did before the picture started?  HOW was it nobody at his brother's viewing realized the body on display was SOMEBODY ELSE?  etc.)  All the same, I find it more watchable than most of these.",4,"OBLONG BOX:  Stylish, Complex, and Senselessly Violent!",1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,2958,"['opening', 'premise', 'THE', 'OBLONG', 'BOX', 'almost', 'identical', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'story', 'Black', 'Orchid', 'man', 'Africa', 'cursed', 'tribal', 'magic', 'disfigured', 'insane', 'kept', 'prisoner', 'own', 'home', 'family', 'whereas', 'WHO', 'story', 'was', 'punch', 'line', 'here', 'just', 'springboard', 'Said', 'victim', 'secretly', 'friends', 'help', 'escape', 'brother', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'who', 'much', 'nicer', 'most', 'films', 'same', 'be', 'hiding', 'something', 'Via', 'more', 'witch', 'doctor', 'magic', 'man', 'own', 'death', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'astray', 'SERIOUSLY', 'astray', 'buried', 'alive', 'then', 'body', 'stolen', 'grave-robbers', 'employ', 'unscrupulous', 'medical', 'adventurer', 'One', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'such', 'role', 'NO', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'WHY', 'friends', 'failed', 'follow-thru', 'plan', 'complete', 'mystery', 'blame', 'unpolished', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'sensible', 'twist', ""'d"", 'actually', 'TRIED', 'digging', 'only', 'find', 'grave-robbers', 'got', 'FIRST', 'result', 'addition', 'wanting', 'find', 'out', 'WHY', 'had', 'jungle', 'curse', 'put', 'Price', 'brother', 'now', 'REVENGE', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Armed', 'mask', 'VERY', 'sharp', 'knife', 'antics', 'film', '2nd', 'half', 'make', 'seem', 'Victorian-era', 'installment', 'HALLOWEEN', 'series', 'understand', 'late', 'Michael', 'Reeves', 'was', 'scheduled', 'direct', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'Price', 'Rupert', 'Davies', 'DRACULA', 'HAS', 'RISEN', 'FROM', 'THE', 'GRAVE', 'Hilary', 'Dwyer', 'CRY', 'THE', 'BANSHEE', 'are', 'together', 'again', 'following', 'WITCHFINDER', 'GENERAL', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'pointless', 'VIOLENCE', 'story', 'film', 'disturbed', 'EXTREME', 'time', 'sat', 'thru', 'OBLONG', 'BOX', 'LOT', 'more', 'fun', 'can', 'get', 'growing', 'number', 'bodies', 'most', 'were', 'killed', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'senseless', 'fashion', '2', 'interesting', 'things', 'noticed', 'plot', 'nearly', 'character', 'be', 'BLACKMAILING', 'somebody', 'EVERYBODY', 'secret', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'known', 'sympathetic-yet-INSANE', 'victim/SLASHER', 'only', 'kill', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'done', 'wrong', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'housekeeper', 'terrified', 'dragged', 'thru', 'woods', 'nothing', 'REALLY', 'Interesting', 'cameos', 'watch', 'Colin', 'Jeavons', 'Inspector', 'Lestrade', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'HOLMES', 'series', 'police', 'inspector', 'Ivor', 'Dean', 'Inspector', 'Teal', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'SAINT', 'series', '.With', 'film', 'producer', 'Louis', 'M.', 'Heyward', 'director', 'Gordon', 'Hessler', 'began', 'string', 'collaborations', 'were', 'somewhat', 'iffy', 'WAR-GODS', 'THE', 'DEEP', 'Heyward', 'produced', 'OBLONG', 'BOX', 'feels', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'fine-tuning', 'WHY', 'did', 'Price', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'picture', 'started', 'HOW', 'was', 'nobody', 'brother', 'viewing', 'realized', 'body', 'display', 'was', 'SOMEBODY', 'ELSE', 'etc', 'same', 'find', 'more', 'watchable', 'most']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again

Price is in top form and, in both movies, he stars with horror icon, Christopher Lee, who is most notable for his Dracula role in the Hammer productions.  Unfortunately, however, they only share one scene in each film.""The Oblong Box,"" based on an Edgar Allan Poe story, is gothic horror sent in 1865 and is the best of the pair.  This is the tale of the two Markham brothers who own an African plantation.  A native boy is seriously disfigured in a riding accident.  The tribal voodoo witch doctor curses Edgar Markham with a disfiguring illness that drives him insane.  Upon returning to England, Julian (played by Price) keeps his brother Edgar locked in the attic.  Edgar escapes by feigning death and is buried alive.  His co-conspirators betray him and do not dig up his grave.  Meanwhile, Lee is an evil doctor who needs fresh bodies for his experiments.  His ghouls dig up Edgar's grave.  Donning, a red hood, Edgar begins killing those who betrayed him.""The Oblong Box"" is a good slasher film and a good mystery for those who love gothic horror.  The plot is intricate, the acting is good, and the throat slashings are graphic and gory.""Scream and Scream Again"" is another high body count horror film set in the ""groovy"" sixties.  A new political Communist-like party has taken over England; they utilize strong, ruthless mad men who are robots (i.e., composites) to carry out their evil plans.  Price is a government funded scientist who created the composites.  Lee is a politician who wants to cover up Price's projects because one of his earlier experiments has been murdering beautiful young women and draining them of blood like a vampire.The plot for ""Scream and Scream Again"" is very complex, almost too complex, and it has too many villains.  There is never a dull moment as the bodies begin piling high.  Three horror icons star in this movie.  One of them, Peter Cushing, has a cameo.  Christopher Lee is underused .  The lead character appears to be the young medical examiner who performs the autopsies on the ""vampire"" victims; he investigates Price.

705570,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B000068TPF,Jerry McDaniel,"[16, 17]","this DVD combines two of Vincent's under-rated horror films from this era. &quot;Scream and Scream Again&quot; is a great movie...but the people at AIP ruined the film's legacy by giving Vincent top billing. the reason? Vincent is only in maybe 20 minutes of the movie...and this isn't an uninterrupted 20 minutes either. his big scene is in the lab at the end of the film as he kills one of his own robots that have gone corrupt, only to be confronted by Christopher Lee's character in an eerie scene. Peter Cushing's role is two scenes, and he's killed by the main robot or &quot;composite&quot; as Vincent calls them. However, these three horror legends have no scenes together and each one has nearly a minute or two of on-screen time sandwiched between other scenes with the London police and the scientist/coroner on the case. this is a good movie...but beware that the three horror legends that get top billing ARE NOT the stars of the film! the other film, &quot;The Oblong Box&quot;, IS a Vincent Price starring film. He plays the brother of a man who was mutated in Africa by a bunch of witch-doctors for a crime he didn't do. Price's character {Julian Markham} had killed a child {the victim of a horse trampling} but the natives grabbed the brother by mistake! forced to wear a crimson mask because of his scars, the brother {named Edward Markham} plots revenge on everybody. Christopher Lee plays a doctor named Neuhart who can't help the brother but nevertheless the brother demands satisfaction. later, when the insecure Edward {played by Alister Williamson} feels that the doctor is double-crossing him, a swift slice of the neck with a blade does the trick and Lee meets his demise midway through the film. Lee is wearing a grey wig for some reason!? it's rather funny seeing him in it and deliver his lines in that voice we all know and love! &quot;The Oblong Box&quot; is a mixture of voo-doo, cult, and African cultures very different from typical Price horror movies of the previous years by Roger Corman and William Castle. &quot;Scream and Scream Again&quot; is a good movie for what it deals with {1970, release} and &quot;The Oblong Box&quot; is also good {1969, release}.",5,late '60s Vincent,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,2197,"['DVD', 'two', 'Vincent', 'under-rated', 'horror', 'films', 'era', 'quot', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'quot', 'great', 'movie', 'people', 'AIP', 'ruined', 'film', 'legacy', 'giving', 'Vincent', 'top', 'billing', 'reason', 'Vincent', 'only', 'maybe', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'uninterrupted', '20', 'minutes', 'either', 'big', 'scene', 'lab', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'own', 'robots', 'have', 'gone', 'corrupt', 'only', 'be', 'confronted', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'character', 'eerie', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'role', 'two', 'scenes', 'killed', 'main', 'robot', 'quot', 'composite', 'quot', 'Vincent', 'However', 'three', 'horror', 'legends', 'have', 'scenes', 'together', 'one', 'nearly', 'minute', 'two', 'on-screen', 'time', 'sandwiched', 'other', 'scenes', 'London', 'police', 'scientist/coroner', 'case', 'good', 'movie', 'beware', 'three', 'horror', 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'stars', 'film', 'other', 'film', 'quot', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'quot', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'starring', 'film', 'brother', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'mutated', 'Africa', 'bunch', 'witch-doctors', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Price', 'character', 'Julian', 'Markham', 'had', 'killed', 'child', 'victim', 'horse', 'trampling', 'natives', 'grabbed', 'brother', 'mistake', 'forced', 'wear', 'crimson', 'mask', 'scars', 'brother', 'named', 'Edward', 'Markham', 'plots', 'revenge', 'everybody', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'doctor', 'named', 'Neuhart', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'brother', 'nevertheless', 'brother', 'satisfaction', 'later', 'when', 'insecure', 'Edward', 'played', 'Alister', 'Williamson', 'doctor', 'double-crossing', 'swift', 'slice', 'neck', 'blade', 'trick', 'Lee', 'demise', 'midway', 'film', 'Lee', 'wearing', 'grey', 'wig', 'reason', 'rather', 'funny', 'seeing', 'deliver', 'lines', 'voice', 'know', 'love', 'quot', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'quot', 'mixture', 'voo-doo', 'cult', 'African', 'cultures', 'very', 'different', 'typical', 'Price', 'horror', 'movies', 'previous', 'years', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'William', 'Castle', 'quot', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'quot', 'good', 'movie', 'what', '1970', 'release', 'quot', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'quot', 'also', 'good', '1969', 'release']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again
705571,A2DYLP69KB1GZ6,B000068TPF,J. L. Probert,"[9, 9]","Another excellent release from the Midnight Movie series of double features gives us the first and second collaborations of director Gordon Hessler & screenwriter Christopher Wicking. The first is `The Oblong Box'. Replacing the tragic Michael Reeves as director and getting Wicking to rewrite Laurence Huntingdon's script, Hessler's first AIP horror film isn't by any means a bad effort, beautifully shot and with some nice performances by Price and AIP's then-current scream queen Hilary Dwyer.Of course, it's the second film, `Scream & Scream Again', that we have all been waiting for. Subject of one of Tim Lucas' very first Video Watchdog columns before he made it into a magazine, this has until now only been available on home video with a different music score composed by Kendall Schmidt, replacing the original music composed by David Whitaker. Well, the Whitaker score is now back, and its interesting to watch the film having got so used to Schmidt's electronic doodlings, which it turns out actually weren't that bad. In fact sometimes his score is better than Whitaker's own jazz-inspired music, which in places is quite inappropriate to the action taking place on screen.Some of the reviews on this site have criticized the plotting. Certainly Hessler & Wicking have always maintained that the fragmentary disjointed nature of the story was always intentional. Anyone who has read the original novel `The Disorientated Man' by ""Peter Saxon"" (a pseudonym for any number of writers working at that particular publishing house at that time) will know that the novel is constructed like that anyway, possibly because multiple writers may have contributed to it. `We took out the blobs from space' said Wicking in an interview, but to be honest they don't seem to have done much else. On the other hand, the original screenplay was written  by Milton Subotsky who put everything into logical order, so maybe Hessler and Wicking deserve praise simply for going with a different kind of narrative style. Certainly `Scream & Scream Again' has often been beloved of `art-house horror' critics who have praised its paranoid conspiracy plotline. At least now we get to see it in 1:1.85 and with the original music as intended",4,Price Hessler & Wicking Double Bill,1031616000,"09 10, 2002",2002,2229,"['excellent', 'release', 'Midnight', 'Movie', 'series', 'double', 'features', 'first', 'second', 'collaborations', 'director', 'Gordon', 'Hessler', 'screenwriter', 'Christopher', 'Wicking', 'first', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'Replacing', 'tragic', 'Michael', 'Reeves', 'director', 'getting', 'Wicking', 'rewrite', 'Laurence', 'Huntingdon', 'script', 'Hessler', 'first', 'AIP', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'effort', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'nice', 'performances', 'Price', 'AIP', 'then-current', 'scream', 'queen', 'Hilary', 'Dwyer.Of', 'course', 'second', 'film', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Subject', 'one', 'Tim', 'Lucas', 'very', 'first', 'Video', 'Watchdog', 'columns', 'made', 'magazine', 'now', 'only', 'been', 'available', 'home', 'video', 'different', 'music', 'score', 'composed', 'Kendall', 'Schmidt', 'replacing', 'original', 'music', 'composed', 'David', 'Whitaker', 'Well', 'Whitaker', 'score', 'now', 'back', 'interesting', 'watch', 'film', 'having', 'got', 'so', 'used', 'Schmidt', 'electronic', 'doodlings', 'out', 'actually', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'score', 'better', 'Whitaker', 'own', 'jazz-inspired', 'music', 'places', 'quite', 'inappropriate', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'screen.Some', 'reviews', 'site', 'have', 'criticized', 'plotting', 'Certainly', 'Hessler', 'Wicking', 'have', 'always', 'maintained', 'fragmentary', 'disjointed', 'nature', 'story', 'was', 'always', 'intentional', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'Disorientated', 'Man', 'Peter', 'Saxon', 'pseudonym', 'number', 'writers', 'working', 'particular', 'publishing', 'house', 'time', 'will', 'know', 'novel', 'constructed', 'anyway', 'possibly', 'multiple', 'writers', 'may', 'have', 'contributed', 'took', 'out', 'blobs', 'space', 'said', 'Wicking', 'interview', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'else', 'other', 'hand', 'original', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Milton', 'Subotsky', 'who', 'put', 'everything', 'logical', 'order', 'so', 'maybe', 'Hessler', 'Wicking', 'deserve', 'praise', 'simply', 'going', 'different', 'kind', 'narrative', 'style', 'Certainly', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'often', 'been', 'beloved', 'art-house', 'horror', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'praised', 'paranoid', 'conspiracy', 'plotline', 'least', 'now', 'get', 'see', '1:1.85', 'original', 'music', 'intended']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again

Vincent Price plays a plantation owner who goes to Africa. His brother Edward Markham is captured by the natives and is burned and left insane. Julian Markham(Price) takes his brother Sir Edward back home to England.The year is 1865. Edward is kept locked in an upstairs room in Julian's house. Sir Edward escapes his captivity by faking his death with the help of the family lawyer Trench. Trench  hires a witchdoctor N'Galo to give Sir Edward a drug to put him in a death like trance. Julian finds his brother and thinking he is dead puts him in the oblong box. Julian asks lawyer Trench to find another body for people to see instead of the disfigured Edward.Trench and the witchdoctor murder a landlord and he is presented as the corpse. Then after the funeral the body is thrown into the river. Julian has Edward buried in secret. Later Julian marries his sweetheart Elizabeth (Hilary Dwyer). Sir Edward is buried alive!Later Edward is dug up by grave robbers. He is taken to Dr. Neuhartt(Christopher Lee). The doctor opens the oblong box! Sir Edward blackmails the doctor into helping him. Edward wears a red hood to hide his features. Then insane and vengeful; he goes on a killing spree. Can Julian stop his brother before he comes for him?Scream and Scream Again is also a 1970 thriller. A little more horrific than most of Price's films. Starring Vincent Price, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing this film was directed by Gordon Hessler. Price plays a doctor that specializes in organ transplantation. Christopher Lee plays head of Britain's intelligence service. Peter Cushing plays an unidentified official in Eastern Europe. He does a brief cameo performance. The plot is a London detective investigate the deaths of young women in the city. Some of the bodies have been drained of blood! These two movies were not like the 1960 movies Price played. The movies were O.K. in my opinion. Oblong Box is better than the 1970 Scream and Scream Again. Price's films took a different twist upon the late 60's and early 70's. The Oblong Box did not take place in a dark castle like Haunted Palace or Pit and The Pendulum. Scream was a little graphic as a serial killer is killing women. I prefer Price's films from the 40's, 50's and early to mid 60's. Roger Corman did 8 of Price's films which include a reading of Poe's work. All of the Roger Corman films were fabulous. These later Price films were just to different to digest for me. The Oblong Box was good but I liked The Fall of The House of Usher, Haunted Palace, The Masque of The Red Death and other Roger Corman movies. I also preferred Price's B/W horror films The Bat, The Tingler, Tower of London ect. All in all a good package of horror films but I could have done without the movie Scream and Scream Again. I just prefer earlier works of Price.",3,The Oblong Box/Scream and Scream Again,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,2952,"['Here', 'are', 'two', 'horror', 'classics', '1969', 'film', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'was', 'directed', 'Gordon', 'Hessler', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'plantation', 'owner', 'who', 'Africa', 'brother', 'Edward', 'Markham', 'captured', 'natives', 'burned', 'left', 'insane', 'Julian', 'Markham', 'Price', 'brother', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'back', 'home', 'England.The', 'year', '1865', 'Edward', 'kept', 'locked', 'upstairs', 'room', 'Julian', 'house', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'captivity', 'faking', 'death', 'help', 'family', 'lawyer', 'Trench', 'Trench', 'witchdoctor', ""N'Galo"", 'give', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'drug', 'put', 'death', 'trance', 'Julian', 'brother', 'thinking', 'dead', 'oblong', 'box', 'Julian', 'lawyer', 'Trench', 'find', 'body', 'people', 'see', 'instead', 'disfigured', 'Edward.Trench', 'witchdoctor', 'murder', 'landlord', 'presented', 'corpse', 'Then', 'funeral', 'body', 'thrown', 'river', 'Julian', 'Edward', 'buried', 'secret', 'Later', 'Julian', 'marries', 'sweetheart', 'Elizabeth', 'Hilary', 'Dwyer', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'buried', 'alive', 'Later', 'Edward', 'dug', 'up', 'grave', 'robbers', 'taken', 'Dr.', 'Neuhartt', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'doctor', 'oblong', 'box', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'doctor', 'helping', 'Edward', 'red', 'hood', 'hide', 'features', 'Then', 'insane', 'vengeful', 'killing', 'spree', 'Can', 'Julian', 'stop', 'brother', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'also', '1970', 'thriller', 'little', 'more', 'horrific', 'most', 'Price', 'films', 'Starring', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Gordon', 'Hessler', 'Price', 'doctor', 'organ', 'transplantation', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'head', 'Britain', 'intelligence', 'service', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'unidentified', 'official', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'brief', 'cameo', 'performance', 'plot', 'London', 'detective', 'investigate', 'deaths', 'young', 'women', 'city', 'bodies', 'have', 'been', 'drained', 'blood', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'not', '1960', 'movies', 'Price', 'played', 'movies', 'were', 'O.K', 'opinion', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'better', '1970', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'Price', 'films', 'took', 'different', 'twist', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'dark', 'castle', 'Haunted', 'Palace', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Scream', 'was', 'little', 'graphic', 'serial', 'killer', 'killing', 'women', 'prefer', 'Price', 'films', '40', '50', 'early', 'mid', '60', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'did', '8', 'Price', 'films', 'include', 'reading', 'Poe', 'work', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'films', 'were', 'fabulous', 'later', 'Price', 'films', 'were', 'just', 'different', 'digest', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'was', 'good', 'liked', 'Fall', 'House', 'Usher', 'Haunted', 'Palace', 'Masque', 'Red', 'Death', 'other', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'movies', 'also', 'preferred', 'Price', 'B/W', 'horror', 'films', 'Bat', 'Tingler', 'Tower', 'London', 'ect', 'good', 'package', 'horror', 'films', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'movie', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'just', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'works', 'Price']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again
705575,A1YHHM3QFKCBCK,B000068TPF,M2,"[2, 2]","An interesting pairing of two late 1960s Vincent Price epics, one of which is a bit hidebound, while the other is a fascinating enigma.  The hidebound one is ""The Oblong Box,"" ostensibly part of AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series, but having nothing whatsoever to do with Poe.  It is the story of two brothers, one of whom has been cursed and disfigured by a voodoo witch doctor, becoming a sort of mad ""Phantom of the Opera""-like masked figure.  Meanwhile brother Julian (Price) is trying to live a normal life, while keeping his brother locked up in the attic.  He gets out, of course, and wreaks havoc.  Australian character actor Alister Williamson plays the role of the disfigured brother, but not particularly well.  His voice behind the mask is apparently dubbed, and he possesses no particular gift for pantomime.  Christopher Lee, who has a thankless marquee-value-only role as a doctor, would have been wonderful as the brother, given his ability to physicalize his acting, but by 1969 he was too big a star to keep masked throughout (originally, Price was slated to play both roles, which might have worked with a masked double).  ""The Oblong Box"" was supposed to be director Michael Reeves' follow-up to ""Witchfinder General"" (""The Conquerer Worm"" in the US) and features both Hillary Dwyer and Rupert Davies from ""Witchfinder,"" but Reeves died before filming began, and the project was given to Gordon Hessler.  The last-minute-takeover quality of the direction shows.  The biggest problem, perhaps, is that the final revelation of Williamson's disfigured face definitely disappoints, particularly after the build-up it has been given.  Instead of something as shocking as Chaney's Opera Phantom, we are confronted with what looks like a middle-aged man hit in the face with a pie. ""The Oblong Box"" is not without its moments, but it is one of the least of the Poe cycle.""Scream and Scream Again,"" however, is a must-see for anyone addicted to the cinema of the weird.  The story is so scattershot it is hard to summarize--something about synthetic vampires made by a mad doctor, a foreign goverment planting spies, and a shadowy Whitehall office--but it is undeniably entertaining.  Think of ""The Prisoner"" meeting Jack the Ripper, with a little Dracula thrown in, all set in ""1984"" and you get an idea of the overall effect. Vincent Price is the mad doctor, Christopher Lee the mysterious government official, and Peter Cushing (in a thankless cameo) is the leader of the unnamed foreign power.  There's also a terrific extended chase scene, some really bad disco sequences, vats of acid in country manor houses, and...oh, what's the point of listing it all?

After all the Poe hits American International had during the sixties, they must have been disappointed with these films' lack of audience approval.  Although SCREAM is a cult favorite, it still suffers from many flaws.In THE OBLONG BOX, Vincent Price is somewhat subtler in earlier roles, and his character who starts out sort of heroic is later seen as the real culprit of the film.  The movie's snail pacing doesn't help, and Christopher Lee looks like he wishes he had done another Dracula movie.  What hurts the film the most is its treatment of the ""villain,"" Edward Markham.  Supposedly horribly disfigured for killing a native in Africa, it takes the film forever to show us the man's face and when they do, it's about as frightening as a butterfly.  Its ending is also wickedly tame, and it is not one of the better Poe adaptations.In SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN, screenwriter Christopher Wicking's plot is so disjointed, ineffectively tying the threads to all the different scenarios; the direction is uninspired and has one of the most boring car chases in cinema; and the pursuit of the Vampire Killer (horribly played by Michael Gothard) is so overdrawn, with countless scenes of inept police work, and scenes of Gothard running up hillsides and through valleys.  The club band, Amen Corner, is absolutely atrocious, even singing a song called ""Scream and Scream Again.""  Yipes.Why bother?  It's always good to see three masters of horror in any film, although Lee, Cushing and Price have very little screen time in SCREAM.  Lee also has little screen time in BOX.

While Lee and Cushing worked together often, collaborations with Price were much less frequent. This DVD offers two such rare collaborations.Scream and Scream Again is definitely the better of the two movies. It has its flaws: the plot is overly complicated and certain plot lines don't tie together for a long time, if truly ever. The story has something to do with a mad scientist (Price) who is performing mysterious experiments and a serial killer who frequents discos and is seemingly unkillable. Add to all this some intrigue with a East German-country, and you have a mess, but somehow a fun one.Although billed as starring all three actors, this is misleading. Cushing is in the movie for all of five minutes, Lee not much longer. Only Price has a significant role, and even he's got a relatively small part. On the other hand, both Lee and Price have significant roles in the Oblong Box.Unfortunately, this movie is pretty weak. Price plays a wealthy gentleman who has just returned from his African plantation, where his brother was hideously deformed as part of a native ritual. The brother, confined to Price's house, fakes his death and is buried alive, only to wind up in the custody of some grave robbers, who sell him to Lee, a doctor who hides him. The brother's quest for revenge occupies the rest of the movie.The Oblong Box is pretty slow-moving and suspenseless, and even the big payoff, seeing the deformed brother's face at long last, is a disappointment: he's hardly scary or even grotesque.At best, these are minor horror movies; for big fans of the genre, especially from the 1960s and 1970s, it may be worth watching.

705585,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000068TPF,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[0, 1]","It's hard to give an accurate star rating to this dvd considering one film is good and the other is not so good.  I figure three stars will be good enough.  The Oblong Box is a cool little number in the Price tradition.  While Price and his brother are in Africa, a voodoo priest puts the wammy on Price's brother and he ends up disfigured.  Back home, he lives chained up in Price's mansion coz he, like Mrs. Bates, goes a little mad sometimes.  A series of events leaves Price's brother literally buried alive, and when he gets out he's understandably pissed, and he's out for a little payback.  That's the general idea, I spared you the details.  It's a good movie.  Not Price's best by a long shot, but worth the time.Scream And Scream Again on the other hand isn't so good.  It's got a great idea behind it, but it actually ends up being quite boring, especially in a sequence where police chase a killer. This scene goes on waaaayyyyyyyyy too long.  In this film, we have a creepy organization that plays Frankenstein by trying to create a race of synthetic, perfect human beings.  And the cast is an eye catcher-Price, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  How can you turn that down?  Well, don't expect to see much of either three stars in this film.  Price pops up in two short scenes and in the last 5 minutes or so.  Cushing has only one scene!!!  I wonder why he even agreed to do it at all.  And Lee's in about three short scenes.  Pretty disappointing that these three horror giants would be in such throwaway roles.  It's worth watching to say you've seen it.  Hell, I might even give it a second chance and watch it again.....but not anytime soon.",3,"Two For The ""Price"" Of One",1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,1662,"['hard', 'give', 'accurate', 'star', 'rating', 'dvd', 'considering', 'one', 'film', 'good', 'other', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'figure', 'three', 'stars', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'cool', 'little', 'number', 'Price', 'tradition', 'Price', 'brother', 'are', 'Africa', 'voodoo', 'priest', 'wammy', 'Price', 'brother', 'up', 'disfigured', 'Back', 'home', 'chained', 'up', 'Price', 'mansion', 'coz', 'Mrs.', 'Bates', 'little', 'mad', 'sometimes', 'series', 'events', 'Price', 'brother', 'literally', 'buried', 'alive', 'when', 'out', 'understandably', 'pissed', 'out', 'little', 'payback', 'general', 'idea', 'spared', 'details', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'Price', 'best', 'long', 'shot', 'time.Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'got', 'great', 'idea', 'actually', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'boring', 'especially', 'sequence', 'where', 'police', 'chase', 'killer', 'scene', 'waaaayyyyyyyyy', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'have', 'creepy', 'organization', 'Frankenstein', 'trying', 'create', 'race', 'synthetic', 'perfect', 'human', 'beings', 'cast', 'eye', 'catcher-Price', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'How', 'can', 'turn', 'down', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'three', 'stars', 'film', 'Price', 'up', 'two', 'short', 'scenes', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'Cushing', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'wonder', 'why', 'even', 'agreed', 'do', 'Lee', 'about', 'three', 'short', 'scenes', 'Pretty', 'disappointing', 'three', 'horror', 'giants', 'would', 'be', 'such', 'throwaway', 'roles', 'worth', 'watching', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hell', 'might', 'even', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'watch', 'again', 'not', 'anytime', 'soon']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again
705586,A2IL4AJIXXXLEM,B000068TPF,the smart guy,"[2, 4]","The Oblong Box is an excellent movie. It is about two brothers that are afflicted by an African curse.  One of the brothers is deformed throughout the movie and seeks revenge on various characters.  Christopher Lee plays a low-key role as a doctor who accidentally gets involved with Vincent Price's scheme. There is more to the plot, some high-drama, and a twist at the end. The cinematography is not as artistic or brilliant as Vincent Price's other films. And that is the only drawback. Grade: AScream and Scream again is a poorly constructed corn-ball movie.  It features brief appearances of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Vincent Price. However; brilliant they may be, it does not make up for the absurd plot and silly chase scenes. The film boasts no suspense or interesting characters. The cinematography is mediocre at best.

705587,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000068TPF,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[7, 7]","This is an interesting, entertaining and somewhat disappointing double feature from amazing ghoulish Vincent Price (and Christopher Lee).  The former statement might befuddle some readers so please allow me to elaborate on each film.The first movie is ""The Oblong Box"", based off a story of Edgar Allan Poe.  I am familiar with Poe's work, but not this tale, as strange as that might sound. Nevertheless, Vincent Price plays noble man named Julian who has his brother Edward locked in a room due to some unfortunate event that transpired in Africa. It appears that Edward is under an African voodoo curse and has been left with a disfigured face.Well to paraphrase, Edward plans an escape which ends up having him being mistaken for dead.  Until he is discovered by Dr. Neuhartt (Christopher Lee) who is in the grave robbing business in order to study human anatomy.  Edward ends up black mailing Dr. Neuhartt and starts a murderous spree that leaves his brother Julian scratching his head. There is a bit more to it, but this is basically it.  The movie is a period piece taking place near the turn of the century. As a matter of fact, it looks a lot like a Hammer Horror movie.The second movie is ""Scream and Scream Again"".  This movie is a bit more challenging for me to describe. This is due to the fact the multiple storylines never really seem to gel. There is this militant fascist group who is taking various body parts and is creating pseudo people.  Meanwhile there is a vampire like killer running around accosting young women.  The police are investigating these murders, while a young medical doctor aids in the search, Vincent Price also plays another medical doctor who might be linked to both the killings and ""make a person project"".  Christopher Lee plays a business man and Peter Cushing plays a general.The major problem I have with ""Scream and Scream Again"" is the lack of the marquee stars.  Vincent Price is in the movie maybe fifteen minutes, Christopher Lee present for six minutes and Peter Cushing is in a scene that lasts maybe two and half minutes, isn't that disgusting?  I was also very disappointed with the lack of interaction between the three stars.  Price & Lee share a scene; Cushing is on an island alone.However once I got pass the lack of the ""big 3"" and confusing story, this was one entertaining movie.  There was plenty of action and the pathos of the 1970s is extremely apparent, right down to the theme song that shares the name of the film.  In other words I never felt like I was bored.  There is one scene where a pseudo man ripped his hand off from a hand cuff, interesting stuff.  I truly wish that ""Scream and Scream Again"" didn't even mention that Peter Cushing was in the movie.  A surprise cameo would have been cooler, if one can't tell I am a Cushing fan.I personally felt that ""The Oblong Box"" is the stronger movie out of the two.  The performances are better, the mood is more eerie, and the film is leveled yet not schizophrenic. I didn't find the pace of this movie slow or languid, rather it allowed for quite a nice zenith.  Christopher Lee was sporting a gray wig in this movie, great stuff.  It was also cool to see Mr. Lee call his housekeeper a slut, priceless.  It is unfortunate that Lee and Price only share one small scene. However, in this movie Christopher Lee is listed as a ""special guest star"" yet has a much larger role than in ""Scream and Scream Again"".The DVD is a flipper disc, one movie on each side.  As for special features, the movies have options for subtitles and the original trailer/preview is included. One footnote about the trailer for ""Scream and Scream Again"", when Peter Cushing's name is displayed it is over another actor. Huh? I digress, these movies are presented in letterbox and the picture is very clear.  I would say these movies are a nice way to pass a couple of hours. I much rather watch them then mow the lawn.",4,"Good, campy movies, despite some flaws....",1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,3917,"['interesting', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'double', 'feature', 'amazing', 'ghoulish', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'former', 'statement', 'might', 'befuddle', 'readers', 'please', 'allow', 'elaborate', 'film.The', 'first', 'movie', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'based', 'off', 'story', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'am', 'familiar', 'Poe', 'work', 'not', 'tale', 'as', 'strange', 'might', 'sound', 'Nevertheless', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'plays', 'noble', 'man', 'named', 'Julian', 'who', 'brother', 'Edward', 'locked', 'room', 'due', 'unfortunate', 'event', 'transpired', 'Africa', 'Edward', 'African', 'voodoo', 'curse', 'been', 'left', 'disfigured', 'face.Well', 'paraphrase', 'Edward', 'escape', 'up', 'having', 'being', 'mistaken', 'dead', 'discovered', 'Dr.', 'Neuhartt', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'who', 'grave', 'robbing', 'business', 'order', 'study', 'human', 'anatomy', 'Edward', 'up', 'black', 'mailing', 'Dr.', 'Neuhartt', 'murderous', 'spree', 'brother', 'Julian', 'scratching', 'head', 'bit', 'more', 'basically', 'movie', 'period', 'piece', 'taking', 'place', 'turn', 'century', 'matter', 'fact', 'lot', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'second', 'movie', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'describe', 'due', 'fact', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'never', 'really', 'seem', 'gel', 'militant', 'fascist', 'group', 'who', 'taking', 'various', 'body', 'parts', 'creating', 'pseudo', 'people', 'Meanwhile', 'vampire', 'killer', 'running', 'around', 'accosting', 'young', 'women', 'police', 'are', 'investigating', 'murders', 'young', 'medical', 'doctor', 'aids', 'search', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'also', 'medical', 'doctor', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'linked', 'killings', 'make', 'person', 'project', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'business', 'man', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'general.The', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'lack', 'marquee', 'stars', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'movie', 'maybe', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'present', 'six', 'minutes', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'scene', 'maybe', 'two', 'half', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'disgusting', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'interaction', 'three', 'stars', 'Price', 'Lee', 'share', 'scene', 'Cushing', 'island', 'alone.However', 'once', 'got', 'pass', 'lack', 'big', '3', 'confusing', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'was', 'plenty', 'action', 'pathos', '1970s', 'extremely', 'apparent', 'right', 'down', 'theme', 'song', 'shares', 'name', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'bored', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'pseudo', 'man', 'ripped', 'hand', 'off', 'hand', 'cuff', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'truly', 'wish', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'was', 'movie', 'surprise', 'cameo', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cooler', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'am', 'Cushing', 'fan.I', 'personally', 'felt', 'Oblong', 'Box', 'stronger', 'movie', 'two', 'performances', 'are', 'better', 'mood', 'more', 'eerie', 'film', 'leveled', 'yet', 'not', 'schizophrenic', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'pace', 'movie', 'slow', 'languid', 'rather', 'allowed', 'quite', 'nice', 'zenith', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'was', 'sporting', 'gray', 'wig', 'movie', 'great', 'stuff', 'was', 'also', 'cool', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'call', 'housekeeper', 'slut', 'priceless', 'unfortunate', 'Lee', 'Price', 'only', 'share', 'one', 'small', 'scene', 'However', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'listed', 'special', 'guest', 'star', 'yet', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', '.The', 'DVD', 'flipper', 'disc', 'one', 'movie', 'side', 'special', 'features', 'movies', 'have', 'options', 'subtitles', 'original', 'trailer/preview', 'included', 'One', 'footnote', 'trailer', 'Scream', 'Scream', 'Again', 'when', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'name', 'displayed', 'actor', 'Huh', 'digress', 'movies', 'are', 'presented', 'letterbox', 'picture', 'very', 'clear', 'would', 'say', 'movies', 'are', 'nice', 'way', 'pass', 'couple', 'hours', 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'then', 'mow', 'lawn']",Midnite Movies Double Feature: The Oblong Box / Scream and Scream Again
