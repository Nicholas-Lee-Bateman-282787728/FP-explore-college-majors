Not overly bloody, some fun characters and a decent plot. Yvonne DeCarlo (Lily Munster) is perfectly cast as Barbara's creepy mother. Check out Barbara Steele in Pit and The Pendulum, Black Sunday, Castle Of Blood if you like 60's horror. Also Shivers and Piranha (70's). Of course her fans loved her in the remake of Dark Shadows in 1990.",4,Barbara Steele Returns!!!!,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,507,"['would', 'have', 'been', 'typical', '80', 'horror', 'flick', 'nice', 'camera', 'work', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'famous', 'Italian', 'horror', 'films', '60', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'Not', 'overly', 'bloody', 'fun', 'characters', 'decent', 'plot', 'DeCarlo', 'Lily', 'Munster', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Barbara', 'creepy', 'mother', 'Check', 'out', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'Pit', 'Pendulum', 'Black', 'Sunday', 'Castle', 'Blood', 'like', '60', 'horror', 'Also', 'Shivers', 'Piranha', '70', 'course', 'fans', 'loved', 'remake', 'Dark', 'Shadows', '1990']",N/A
242100,A2RST4Y2LXRQW5,630100499X,Avery Hemming,"[6, 12]","I never saw this movie when it first came out in 1980.  I saw the trailer for it on Youtube and it looked great!  A lonely girl ascending the stairs cautiously and discovers a secret room and in a split second the unknown attacker pulls the victim inside the room.  Wow, that was a scary trailer.  The secret passage looked creepy in the trailer.  It's a great tool/setting for a horror movie. I'm sure other horror writers wished they thought of it first.I watched the movie today and it was a boring experience for me to sit through.  The good characters were dull and the evil enemies were embarrassing.  I'm convinced that Barabara Steele accepted the role for employment only.  I'm not convinced that she read the script in awe dying to play the character.  The same for Yvonne De Carlo.  Maybe it was an attempt by the movie studio to convince the public by having Barbara and Yvonne was a guarantee of a high quality movie.  Otherwise, not having the two actress would result in a lower box office performance.When a movie is not good, generally there's an excuse that it had a small budget, horrendous location, cheap setting, untalented actors, lousy directors, or bad choice of editing.  The house was a good idea and the secret passage was a great tool for the movie.  The story was a bad idea and it's quite a task to make a script from a useless story.  I'm not placing the blame on the actors or the director for me not liking the movie:  it's the Wheat brothers fault for the creation of the story.  If the story was read as a novel, the pages would stop turning and the landfills would be flooded.  After you see this movie, can you stomach listening to it as an audio book?  I hope not!  If I had a movie company, and the Wheat brothers told me their story from start to finish, I would not finance the movie at all.The Wheat brothers idea of a scary movie was not clever.  Their villains were weirdos that convinced me they could bump off a comatose bedridden patient.  It had to be a miserable situation to be an actor or actress trying to be a believable victim throughout the movie. I won't give the plot away on Barbara Steele's character, but her being silent and acting childishly looney made me sad for her role she played:  was this the only offer she received from the celluloid world?  The suspicious ""mother"" harboring a dark secret that her career could be over as an actress.  The weird boy going crazy and wearing his ""father's"" military uniform was not a terrifying transoformation, but convincing that it's not going to look good on your resume. In the beginning of the movie, there's a slow motion scene of the police entering inside the house viewing the brutality of the crime scene was supposed to make me feel disturbed of what I'm about to see.  It didn't work.  I didn't cover my eyes.  I didn't hurl.  I didn't have nightmares.  I felt sleepy staring at dead bodies laying in a position as if they never had a romantic fling in their whole life.  Not even a dog would be excited enough to hump their legs. Imagine watching a person in slow motion flashing the middle finger at you.  I would imagine the majority of the reaction from the crazy finger incident would be shaking your head in bewilderment, ""That was stupid!""  It was one of the dullest crime scenes I've ever seen in a movie.After watching this movie ""Silent Scream,"" no one will ever dress up as any of the characters from the movie for a Halloween party.  None of their characters had that impact.  A manufacturing company will not waste it's time pursuing a license to make a t-shirt or even publishing a novel from this movie.  The plot is miserable and I'm sure someone else could come up with a better story of the house and the secret passage.  The best thing to do is enjoy watching the trailer of ""Silent Scream"" and let your imagination create a better plot than the original movie.",1,Silent yawn....zzz...,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,3897,"['never', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1980', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Youtube', 'looked', 'great', 'lonely', 'girl', 'ascending', 'stairs', 'cautiously', 'secret', 'room', 'split', 'unknown', 'attacker', 'victim', 'room', 'Wow', 'was', 'scary', 'trailer', 'secret', 'passage', 'looked', 'creepy', 'trailer', 'great', 'tool/setting', 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'other', 'horror', 'writers', 'wished', 'thought', 'watched', 'movie', 'today', 'was', 'boring', 'experience', 'sit', 'good', 'characters', 'were', 'dull', 'evil', 'enemies', 'were', 'embarrassing', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'Barabara', 'Steele', 'accepted', 'role', 'employment', 'only', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'read', 'script', 'awe', 'dying', 'play', 'character', 'same', 'Yvonne', 'De', 'Carlo', 'Maybe', 'was', 'attempt', 'movie', 'studio', 'convince', 'public', 'having', 'Barbara', 'Yvonne', 'was', 'guarantee', 'high', 'quality', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'having', 'two', 'actress', 'would', 'result', 'lower', 'box', 'office', 'performance.When', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'generally', 'excuse', 'had', 'small', 'budget', 'horrendous', 'location', 'cheap', 'setting', 'untalented', 'actors', 'lousy', 'directors', 'bad', 'choice', 'editing', 'house', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'secret', 'passage', 'was', 'great', 'tool', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'quite', 'task', 'make', 'script', 'useless', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'placing', 'blame', 'actors', 'director', 'not', 'liking', 'movie', 'Wheat', 'brothers', 'fault', 'creation', 'story', 'story', 'was', 'read', 'novel', 'pages', 'would', 'stop', 'turning', 'landfills', 'would', 'be', 'flooded', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'stomach', 'listening', 'audio', 'book', 'hope', 'not', 'had', 'movie', 'company', 'Wheat', 'brothers', 'told', 'story', 'start', 'finish', 'would', 'not', 'finance', 'movie', 'all.The', 'Wheat', 'brothers', 'idea', 'scary', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'clever', 'villains', 'were', 'weirdos', 'convinced', 'could', 'bump', 'off', 'comatose', 'bedridden', 'patient', 'had', 'be', 'miserable', 'situation', 'be', 'actor', 'actress', 'trying', 'be', 'believable', 'victim', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'character', 'being', 'silent', 'acting', 'childishly', 'looney', 'made', 'sad', 'role', 'played', 'was', 'only', 'offer', 'received', 'celluloid', 'world', 'suspicious', 'mother', 'harboring', 'dark', 'secret', 'career', 'could', 'be', 'over', 'actress', 'weird', 'boy', 'going', 'crazy', 'wearing', 'father', 'military', 'uniform', 'was', 'not', 'terrifying', 'transoformation', 'convincing', 'not', 'going', 'look', 'good', 'resume', 'beginning', 'movie', 'slow', 'motion', 'scene', 'police', 'entering', 'house', 'viewing', 'brutality', 'crime', 'scene', 'was', 'supposed', 'make', 'feel', 'disturbed', 'what', ""'m"", 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'eyes', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurl', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nightmares', 'felt', 'sleepy', 'staring', 'dead', 'bodies', 'laying', 'position', 'never', 'had', 'romantic', 'fling', 'whole', 'life', 'Not', 'even', 'dog', 'would', 'be', 'excited', 'enough', 'hump', 'legs', 'Imagine', 'watching', 'person', 'slow', 'motion', 'flashing', 'middle', 'finger', 'would', 'imagine', 'majority', 'reaction', 'crazy', 'finger', 'incident', 'would', 'be', 'shaking', 'head', 'bewilderment', 'was', 'stupid', 'was', 'one', 'dullest', 'crime', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie.After', 'watching', 'movie', 'Silent', 'Scream', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'dress', 'up', 'characters', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'party', 'None', 'characters', 'had', 'impact', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'will', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'pursuing', 'license', 'make', 't-shirt', 'even', 'publishing', 'novel', 'movie', 'plot', 'miserable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'else', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'story', 'house', 'secret', 'passage', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'trailer', 'Silent', 'Scream', 'let', 'imagination', 'create', 'better', 'plot', 'original', 'movie']",N/A

242103,A31A9GENAJYD64,630100499X,David M. Rossi,"[0, 0]","It had been quite some time since I last saw Silent Scream, that previous time having been on VHS. After seeing it again on dvd, I felt a review was necessary.Silent Scream is every bit as enjoyable as Halloween which preceeded it, and for all the same reasons (and more). This film has the creepy elements of a weird house and it's owners are far less than normal and off- putting from the start. You just know something is going or has gone wrong with this family.Silent Scream builds slowly, like a good mysterious horror film should, and we are treated to several moments that raise the hair on your neck. It's what you don't see that's often more frightening, a fact that's true of any great horror film, and as a vehicle, it's used to great extent for two thirds of the film.What's even more rewarding though, is that even when we finally find out who's really behind all the shocking behavior, the surprise doesn't end there, as it would with many horror films just killing time with a predictable finale. Instead, the killer's identity is only the tip of very tall iceberg of shocks to come in the form of further revelations, sanity unravellings and several edge of your seat moments that make the final third of Silent Scream a film that far surpasses pretty much every horror finale of the day. You think the Myers family in Halloween or the Voorhees family in Friday the 13th were chock full of moments to cringe at? Silent Scream's Engels family's got them beat by miles, and you really can't predict exactly what end it's all going to finally come to.If you're a true fan of the genre, you can't really call yourself that unless you've spent some time getting to know the Engels. Silent Scream really is a cut above most slasher films because of it's creators' use of proper atmosphere and expertly crafted story telling that pulls you in and keeps your heart beating hard against your chest until the final moment when the screen fades to black. That's the mark of a TRUE horror film.

242106,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,630100499X,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[1, 6]","Poor movie. The movie is badly directed, badly acted has very little effects and as a slasher flick it fails to deliver the required amount of sex and violence to make it worthwhile to sit through. Then there is the twist, there is none!!! The movie begins by showing us the ending for the film which is dumb and leaves little surprises to the viewer.Scotty (Rebecca Balding, longtime tv actress) and her take room and board at Mrs. Engel's (Yvonne De Carlo) seaside mansion complete with a bumbling idiotic young man as their servant. Mrs. Engels and her son are hiding a secret, their crazy mother Victoria Engels (Barbara Steele) likes killing the guests.This movie fails on many levels everything is predictable and the killings are not even gory but look ripped of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" including the music.Barbara Steele has really no lines in the movie and her character isn't really scary at all. Both Yvonne and Barbara look very tired in this movie as if they needed the money or new they were acting in a poor budgeted movie that no one would see. Allegedly Denny Harris made $15 million of this movie but if that's the case why didn't he do another movie or why doesn't this movie get the exposure it deserves if it really is a classic? That's an easy question because it's not a classic.  Some people might like and they have a right too but I find to be uninspiring, generic, boring and tedious to watch.

Amazingly, the film didn't end up a disjointed mess, but is a reasonably stylish, though slow moving, trip into the early days of the genre, before excessive blood and guts took over post-Friday the 13th. Rebecca Balding (The Boogens and t.v.'s Soap) is an engaging and cute lead, and unlike many of these types of actresses, she can act. Some of the supporting cast is not as good, but the worst offenders are killed by the 2/3 mark.

The extras are great, especially the informative and amusing discussion with Rebecca and the Wheat brothers, who stepped in and re-wrote the script to make it salable.

242111,AEXB86K5OEM3L,630100499X,Luis,"[5, 5]","I agree with some previous reviewers in that Psycho is probably a major source of inspiration to this movie. However, that's not a unique sin to this one: many horror movies from 1980s and later have used the original Psycho plan. Despite that, the movie has a pretty descent script and acting if you take into account the standard for horror movies in the 1980s (e.g., Friday the 13th). Despite very few ""fatal errors"" that come with horror movies (e.g., the killer keeps coming back after being shot or heavy wounded), the movie has a good pace and is entertaining. I recommend it.

242112,AW4GWTVF4UA7Q,630100499X,Martin Montag,"[7, 12]","I hate to write a negative review for low-budget horror, my favourite movie genre, and was genuinely excited by the prospect of Silent Scream. Having never seen the film back in the 1980's during my BETA/VHS initiation into un-televised horror films and after reading on IMDB the many favourable user comments I thought I had to buy what seemed to be one that went under my radar back in the day.How wrong I was, apart from the fairly atmospheric slow-motion prologue and one effectively creepy slow-motion camera point-of-view exploration of a basement, this film literally put me to sleep. Cameron Mitchell dials in his performance as if after swallowing a bottle of mogadons. Barbara Steele is effective, though by the time she makes her appearance I was in the land of nod, having to watch the film again to catch up with her performance. The rest of the actors aren't too bad, but failed to engage me in their story. The romance between the female lead and fellow male college student has all the chemistry of washing powder and so ineffectually overplayed as to make me question the film-makers intent; leaving me incredulous and distracted into mild anger. The too few horror elements are delivered without requisite bite or panache or at least explicitly visceral enough for the time period Silent Scream was made and the whole endeavour whilst not incompetent moves along like a slug in treacle.The score is unmemorable; I can't recall it as I write this, having watched the film recently. Bottom line being my lack of concern for anyone involved, probably the worse crime a filmmaker can commit and doubly so for a horror film. What a terrible shame, I was all set for what I had been led to believe was something above average and whilst the picture and sound quality are both very good on the DVD my overall response to this film is one of a crushing sense of induced apathetic disappointment. I really can't recommend this film, and am baffled by the other highly favourable reviews here on Amazon and IMDB",1,"Silent sleep, scream for horror",1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,2019,"['hate', 'write', 'negative', 'review', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'favourite', 'movie', 'genre', 'was', 'genuinely', 'excited', 'prospect', 'Silent', 'Scream', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'back', '1980', 'BETA/VHS', 'initiation', 'un-televised', 'horror', 'films', 'reading', 'IMDB', 'many', 'favourable', 'user', 'comments', 'thought', 'had', 'buy', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'one', 'went', 'radar', 'back', 'day.How', 'wrong', 'was', 'apart', 'fairly', 'atmospheric', 'slow-motion', 'prologue', 'one', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'slow-motion', 'camera', 'point-of-view', 'exploration', 'basement', 'film', 'literally', 'put', 'sleep', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'dials', 'performance', 'swallowing', 'bottle', 'mogadons', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'effective', 'though', 'time', 'appearance', 'was', 'land', 'nod', 'having', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'catch', 'up', 'performance', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'failed', 'engage', 'story', 'romance', 'female', 'lead', 'fellow', 'male', 'college', 'student', 'chemistry', 'washing', 'powder', 'so', 'ineffectually', 'overplayed', 'make', 'question', 'film-makers', 'intent', 'leaving', 'incredulous', 'distracted', 'mild', 'anger', 'too', 'few', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'delivered', 'requisite', 'bite', 'panache', 'least', 'explicitly', 'visceral', 'enough', 'time', 'period', 'Silent', 'Scream', 'was', 'made', 'whole', 'endeavour', 'whilst', 'not', 'incompetent', 'moves', 'slug', 'treacle.The', 'score', 'unmemorable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'write', 'having', 'watched', 'film', 'recently', 'Bottom', 'line', 'being', 'lack', 'concern', 'anyone', 'involved', 'probably', 'worse', 'crime', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'commit', 'doubly', 'so', 'horror', 'film', 'What', 'terrible', 'shame', 'was', 'set', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'something', 'above', 'average', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'overall', 'response', 'film', 'one', 'crushing', 'sense', 'induced', 'apathetic', 'disappointment', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'am', 'baffled', 'other', 'highly', 'favourable', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'IMDB']",N/A

This 1980 film has all the elements of a good horror movie:  suspense, creepy characters and settings, and chilling music.  It even has a few lines of cheesy dialogue (something no horror flick should be without!).  The plot is interesting and has a number of twists - including the revelation of a family secret, which leads to grave consequences.College student Scotty Parker (Rebecca Balding) is unable to find on-campus housing.  As a result, she rents a room at the Engels seaside mansion, which has been turned into a boarding house.  Three other students also rent rooms there.  When one of them is found murdered on the nearby beach, the police (Cameron Mitchell, Avery Schreiber) begin an investigation - with a special focus on the Engels family - but can they solve the mystery before the other students meet the same grisly fate?Barbara Steele delivers a terrifying, outstanding performance as the mute and disturbed Victoria Engels.  Her eyes alone are enough to frighten you.  Yvonne De Carlo, in her 50s at the time, plays her mother and also delivers a credible, albeit brief, performance.  The pair is perfectly cast, due to both their talent and very noticeable resemblance.Special features include the following:* Mastered in HiDef from the Original InterPositive* Brand New 5.1 Surround Sound* Audio commentary with Writer/Producers Ken and Jim Wheat, and star Rebecca Balding* Three all-new Featurettes:  ""Scream of Success: 30 Years Later,"" ""Silent Scream: The Original Script,"" and ""The Wheat Bros: A Look Back""* Director Denny Harris' Final Audio Interview* Theatrical Trailer* TV SpotI am definitely looking forward to owning this movie on DVD...finally.

Smith ""bookworm""","[2, 2]","The plot of ""Silent Scream"" is a good, if not somewhat rehashed formula...student looks for a place to live off campus, can't find anywhere that suits her needs, and then discovers a seemingly ideal home shared by an odd bunch.  Viewers will immediately sense that something isn't quite right when she first spots the house, looming over the shoreline.  The style of the house reminded me of Stephen King's home in Bangor, Maine (except this film was shot in California and King's home is painted red).Brad Reardon plays Mason Engel, an introverted young man who rents out the home, along with his eerie mother who stares at people but hardly speaks.  The carefree innocence of the tenants is juxtaposed with images of a dank basement/attic lined with cobwebs and someone (or something) trying to escape through a window.Later, after two gruesome murders have been committed, we see Victoria (played by British horror queen Barbara Steele) alone in her attic bedroom, hidden away from the world.  Steele is brilliant in her role as a mute, catatonic madwoman with piercing eyes and a penchant for stabbing people to death.  This movie really isn't as dull as some reviewers would have you believe...although I guess it's a matter of opinion.The plot is full of twists and turns, like who is Mason's real mother?  The answer will surprise you.  Who was his real father?  The film hints that Mason is a product of incest or rape, which explains Victoria's madness and suicide attempt during her pregnancy as a teenager, but we never really find out.  And why does Victoria never speak?  Has her past trauma rendered her unable to talk?  In all, I give ""Silent Scream"" a solid 4 stars.
