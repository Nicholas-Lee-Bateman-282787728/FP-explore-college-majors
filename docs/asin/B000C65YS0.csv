Like many fans of this movie, I look forward to a restored/enhanced/widescreen treatment one day.  Although this is not it, I was appreciative of the fact that the movie looks acceptable on this DVD.  It's fullscreen with widescreen credits, no real cleanup as evident by a moderate degree of speckling and faded color, and weak stereo audio with limited range.  But at least it isn't as low as the quality of the GoodTimes series of DVD releases.  For the price, this was acceptable, and it was nice to see this movie again.  In the meantime, I still look forward to seeing an enhanced widescreen version someday.As far as Man Friday, same comments.Both are enjoyable movies with excellent acting and great stories.  And with the low price, very worth the purchase even for basic fullscreen copies.Now get to work on the enhanced versions please.",3,OK For the Price,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,985,"['movies', 'DVD', 'are', 'entertaining', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'reason', 'bought', 'was', 'see', 'Raise', 'Titanic', 'again', 'many', 'fans', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'restored/enhanced/widescreen', 'treatment', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'was', 'appreciative', 'fact', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'DVD', 'fullscreen', 'widescreen', 'credits', 'real', 'cleanup', 'evident', 'moderate', 'degree', 'speckling', 'faded', 'color', 'weak', 'stereo', 'audio', 'limited', 'range', 'least', ""n't"", 'as', 'low', 'quality', 'GoodTimes', 'series', 'DVD', 'releases', 'price', 'was', 'acceptable', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'meantime', 'still', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'enhanced', 'widescreen', 'version', 'someday.As', 'far', 'Man', 'Friday', 'same', 'comments.Both', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'excellent', 'acting', 'great', 'stories', 'low', 'price', 'very', 'purchase', 'even', 'basic', 'fullscreen', 'copies.Now', 'get', 'work', 'enhanced', 'versions', 'please']",Red Carpet Double Feature: (Man Friday / Raise the Titanic)

The godawful tripe that Hollywood has been pumping out for over a decade now only raises the street value of films like this, I believe; films that were made with a firm dedication to the project and not part of some mass production line of throwaway, soulless garbage like today.I doubt I will ever watch Man Friday, but as far as RTT goes it does appear rather aged on this release. Sadly, no special treatment has been given to it.But no matter. There is no less of an emotional impact now to watch the ship break the surface than there ever was. Sure, some shots are sickeningly revealing of the miniature ship that was used, but by god that overhead shot in the sunlight--the one also used for the ending credits--looks as authentic as the real deal.

955223,A7Y6AVS576M03,B000C65YS0,gobirds2,"[18, 20]","I purchased this DVD primarily to get a copy of RAISE THE TITANIC in this format. It is not the best transfer of this film. Some scenes are grainy and the stereo sound is right on the fringe of even being called stereo. However there are stereo elements there and you will just have to play with your receiver to maximize the effect.  I threw the sounds through my rear speakers to achieve the best effect I could manage. However, I like RAISE THE TITANIC and this copy is actually very viewable and I can recommend it as the best DVD copy out there at this time designed for Region 1. Just savor the moment.There is something about RAISE THE TITANIC that continues to draw me to it. If I were unbiased I know that this is not one of the best films ever made and is probably not even considered a good film by many. However, beyond two scenes that I actually consider good filmmaking, there is a hokey but appealing quality to this film that I cannot seem to shake. I still remember the first time I saw RAISE THE TITANIC. What impressed me most about the entire film was its prologue. It was a montage of black & white photographs depicting the construction, the launching and the setting sail of the Titanic on its maiden voyage. The montage was accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful piece of music composed by John Barry. In this short yet effective composition John Barry captured the majesty of the Titanic, the romanticism of the sea and the mystique of Britain's maritime heritage in what I consider to be one of the best pieces of film scoring that I ever heard. John Barry's score seems more inspired by the actual tragedy of the Titanic and the unknown dangers of the cold Atlantic waters. Despite the shortcomings of the film, which can probably be attributed to weak editing and not necessarily the script, John Barry's music remains focused on the ship and the sentimentality its tragedy holds for Richard Jordan and Alec Guinness. Jordan and Guinness seem to be quixotically tied to the sea. The scene where Alec Guinness reminisces over his experiences aboard the sinking of the Titanic is a haunting and beautiful piece of histrionics. Guinness' heartbreaking sentimentality as he reverently hands over to Jordan the flag he took from the sinking Titanic many years before is one of the best pieces of film I have ever seen. Alec Guinness and Richard Jordan's performances and John Barry's score in this scene are truly heartfelt renderings by these craftsmen and stand as a genuine memoriam to the actual tragedy. This scene and the prologue really touched me and for that reason I always have enjoyed this film and it remains one of my favorites.I have not watched this film in a while and I am very impressed by Richard Jordan's performance. This man died much too young and this film almost seems like a tribute to an actor who deserved much greater recognition. He gives a performance of determination tempered with a dedication to the memory of the TITANIC and is sincerely convincing as a man of strength who has braved the elements of the cruel Atlantic yet maintains a reverence for the perils of the sea and those who succumbed to those perils. I can't say any more.",5,"Barry, Jordan and Guinness Raise this Film to Prominence",1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,3192,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'primarily', 'get', 'copy', 'RAISE', 'THE', 'TITANIC', 'format', 'not', 'best', 'transfer', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'grainy', 'stereo', 'sound', 'right', 'fringe', 'even', 'being', 'called', 'stereo', 'However', 'are', 'stereo', 'elements', 'there', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'play', 'receiver', 'maximize', 'effect', 'threw', 'sounds', 'rear', 'speakers', 'achieve', 'best', 'effect', 'could', 'manage', 'However', 'like', 'RAISE', 'THE', 'TITANIC', 'copy', 'actually', 'very', 'viewable', 'can', 'recommend', 'best', 'DVD', 'copy', 'there', 'time', 'designed', 'Region', '1', 'Just', 'savor', 'moment.There', 'something', 'RAISE', 'THE', 'TITANIC', 'draw', 'were', 'unbiased', 'know', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'considered', 'good', 'film', 'many', 'However', 'two', 'scenes', 'actually', 'consider', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'hokey', 'appealing', 'quality', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'shake', 'still', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'RAISE', 'THE', 'TITANIC', 'What', 'impressed', 'most', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'prologue', 'was', 'montage', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'depicting', 'construction', 'launching', 'setting', 'sail', 'Titanic', 'maiden', 'voyage', 'montage', 'was', 'accompanied', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'music', 'composed', 'John', 'Barry', 'short', 'yet', 'effective', 'composition', 'John', 'Barry', 'captured', 'majesty', 'Titanic', 'romanticism', 'sea', 'mystique', 'Britain', 'maritime', 'heritage', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'film', 'scoring', 'ever', 'heard', 'John', 'Barry', 'score', 'more', 'inspired', 'actual', 'tragedy', 'Titanic', 'unknown', 'dangers', 'cold', 'Atlantic', 'waters', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'attributed', 'weak', 'editing', 'not', 'necessarily', 'script', 'John', 'Barry', 'music', 'focused', 'ship', 'sentimentality', 'tragedy', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Jordan', 'Guinness', 'seem', 'be', 'quixotically', 'tied', 'sea', 'scene', 'where', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'over', 'experiences', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'histrionics', 'Guinness', 'heartbreaking', 'sentimentality', 'reverently', 'Jordan', 'flag', 'took', 'sinking', 'Titanic', 'many', 'years', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'performances', 'John', 'Barry', 'score', 'scene', 'are', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'renderings', 'craftsmen', 'stand', 'genuine', 'memoriam', 'actual', 'tragedy', 'scene', 'prologue', 'really', 'touched', 'reason', 'always', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'one', 'favorites.I', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'film', 'while', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'Richard', 'Jordan', 'performance', 'man', 'died', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'film', 'almost', 'tribute', 'actor', 'who', 'deserved', 'much', 'greater', 'recognition', 'performance', 'determination', 'tempered', 'dedication', 'memory', 'TITANIC', 'sincerely', 'convincing', 'man', 'strength', 'who', 'braved', 'elements', 'cruel', 'Atlantic', 'yet', 'reverence', 'perils', 'sea', 'who', 'succumbed', 'perils', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more']",Red Carpet Double Feature: (Man Friday / Raise the Titanic)

955235,A2JH1Q6THV4ONL,B000C65YS0,Romeo Quixote,"[0, 0]","MAN FRIDAY is an excellent take on the Robinson Crusoe story, as told through the eyes of Crusoe's servant, Friday.I remember renting this film 25 years ago when I was going to school in New York, and it is as good today as it was back then.  O'Toole (as Crusoe) is at his passionate best, whether flying into a fury, going nearly mad, getting deeply reflective and grief-filled, or prancing through the many whimsical, comic moments in the film.  Watching him in this film made me imagine what his Hamlet on stage must have been like, because Hamlet runs the same gamut of emotions that Crusoe does in this film.  Roundtree (as Friday) is fantastic, too, and plays off O'Toole extremely well, matching his mood, scene for scene, whether serious or comic.I kept asking myself while watching the film, why wasn't this a bigger hit, especially in the mid-70's when it came out?  Seems to me a perfect reflection on what was going on socially in the country back then--an examination of who the real &#34;savage&#34; is.  The only answer I could think of was it was probably like Dustin Hoffman's &#34;Ishtar&#34;--a fine movie that was before its time, and people just &#34;didn't get&#34;.Anyway, well, WELL worth the purchase, especially to diehard O'Toole fans, who will LOVE seeing him in one of the many brilliant performances of his distinguished career.",5,Peter O' Toole at his passionate best,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,1358,"['MAN', 'FRIDAY', 'excellent', 'take', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'Crusoe', 'servant', 'Friday.I', 'remember', 'renting', 'film', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'as', 'good', 'today', 'was', 'back', 'then', ""O'Toole"", 'Crusoe', 'passionate', 'best', 'flying', 'fury', 'going', 'nearly', 'mad', 'getting', 'deeply', 'reflective', 'grief-filled', 'prancing', 'many', 'whimsical', 'comic', 'moments', 'film', 'Watching', 'film', 'made', 'imagine', 'what', 'Hamlet', 'stage', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Hamlet', 'same', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'Crusoe', 'film', 'Roundtree', 'Friday', 'fantastic', 'too', 'off', ""O'Toole"", 'extremely', 'well', 'matching', 'mood', 'scene', 'scene', 'serious', 'comic.I', 'kept', 'asking', 'watching', 'film', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'bigger', 'hit', 'especially', 'mid-70', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Seems', 'perfect', 'reflection', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'socially', 'country', 'back', 'then', 'examination', 'who', 'real', '34', 'savage', '34', 'only', 'answer', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'was', 'probably', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', '34', 'Ishtar', '34', 'fine', 'movie', 'was', 'time', 'people', 'just', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '34', '.Anyway', 'well', 'WELL', 'purchase', 'especially', 'diehard', ""O'Toole"", 'fans', 'who', 'will', 'LOVE', 'seeing', 'one', 'many', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'distinguished', 'career']",Red Carpet Double Feature: (Man Friday / Raise the Titanic)
