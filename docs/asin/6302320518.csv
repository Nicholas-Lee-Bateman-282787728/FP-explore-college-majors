This DVD copy of the film was a quality one with a good picture and good sound.  I liked the Quaker way of seeing Quirt Evans and every person in a human and kind way, loving everyone and being healers, not destroyers of men.  The Dual emphasis on the Sheriff first showed us the very all too real emphasis of killing three human beings with one stone that some lawmen have had versus the better way to be towards human beings as when Quirt Evans rode off with Penelope in a beautifully restored life.  And of course the statement made by the Sheriff at the end of the movie supports the second emphasis by stating that the only man who needs a gun is the one who carries one, and of course he himself had been carrying one.

I wasn't expecting much from a 1940's western, and the first 15 minutes or so seemed to prove my worst fears right.  There is some terribly preachy philisophical dialog between Gail Russell's Quaker father and the local athiest doctor, arguing about the inherent good in all men vs the stupidity of living life by high-ideals alone, blah blah blah.  It was spoken in that stilted voice that every bit actor of the time seemed to imitate, as if they were reading the news.  I could just see the ending, with the hero dead and the philosophers saying something like &quot;All men pay the price who...&quot;  blah blah blahIn comes John Wayne to save the day, with a wonderful freshness in his every manner and word.  Young, cocky, Wayne's performance is totally deserving of his superstar status, and is only matched by Gail Russell, who is perhaps the best female lead of any Wayne film.  Russell brings some real life to the peaceful ideals of the Quakers (which appear terribly naive given the setting), and you can't help but fall in love with her hope and beauty.  The Duke matches her step for step, playing a wild boy who is only a few trigger-pulls away from a hanging.  Wayne always obeys Russell's requests for non-violent, peaceful solutions to problems, yet he can't help but putting his own mischievious country-boy spin on everything.In one short scene, we discover that a mean neighbor has damed the local water source.  Russell and her family pray for his cold heart to melt while Wayne rides off and intimidates him into undamming it.  When the Quakers shower the neighbor with food and kindness, his heart does melt, and he thanks Wayne for &quot;asking&quot; him to undam the water.  The Duke is stunned.  And moments like these litter this movie.Watching the Duke's heart melt to Russell's charms is the best part of this movie.  Their romance is perfectly paced and entirely believable.  Wayne is at his romantic best, and Russell has enough ability and looks to match him.  The ending is a little too neat and sudden, but I just wished I could watch another 2 hours.

307999,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6302320518,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Angel and the Badman is as good a proof as you can find that good westerns aren't just about riding, shooting, dueling, and killing.  The truly great old westerns featured some of the tightest, most compelling plots that you will ever find.  This is the first of the John Wayne Productions released by Republic Pictures, and it is a true John Wayne classic.  Needless to say, the Duke plays the ""badman"" as opposed to the angel, an outlaw of sorts with a complicated past in which he evolved from a lawman alongside Wyatt Earp in Tombstone to a cattle-rustling, gambling man with an eye for the ladies.  To quote only one of the great lines in this film, Quirt Evans (John Wayne) closed the eyes of many a man and opened the eyes of many a woman.  Quirt starts to change, though, when he collapses from a gunshot wound outside the home of a Quaker family transplanted from Pennsylvania to the Old West.  Penelope, the young lady of the family immediately falls in love with him, and it is obvious that Quirt is in turn touched by this angel from the very start.  It seems a little odd that the family of Friends would be so welcoming and accommodating to the budding attraction going on, considering Quirt's past, but they see only the good in the man.  Farm life is not Quirt's natural calling, and he admittedly slips from the path of virtue, but in time he faces up to the fact that he has indeed changed.  Of course, happiness is not insured at this point, as the local marshal still has hopes of hanging Quirt some day, and the man who killed Quirt's foster father remains a real threat to him.  The ending is not exactly unpredictable, but it is heart-warming and entertaining all the same.Great actors filling great roles from top to bottom really make Angel and the Badman a benchmark film to which other westerns should be judged.  Gail Russell is indeed an angel more than capable of touching and reforming the crustiest of men, and I can assure you she is not the kind of Quaker woman I would quite have envisioned; she could easily make an instant farmer out of me.  The Duke is, well, he's the Duke; the man incapable of giving a bad performance is at his best in this film.  You have to love the minor characters, as well.  Not only does Angel and the Badman feature a string of unforgettable, entertaining minor players, it incorporates each of them into the story itself in a meaningful way, from Quirt's old buddy with a penchant for telling tales Quirt would rather not have his angel hear to the local telegraph operator whose chance encounter with the legendary cowboy sets him off bragging about his friend Quirt and their long history of friendship.  Everyone associated with this movie obviously cared a great deal, and it shows; not a single facet of film-making was overlooked or ignored.  Angel and the Badman clearly belongs on the short list of the greatest westerns ever made.",5,One of the best westerns ever made,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,2905,"['Angel', 'Badman', 'as', 'good', 'proof', 'can', 'find', 'good', 'westerns', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'riding', 'shooting', 'dueling', 'killing', 'truly', 'great', 'old', 'westerns', 'featured', 'tightest', 'most', 'compelling', 'plots', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'first', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Productions', 'released', 'Republic', 'Pictures', 'true', 'John', 'Wayne', 'classic', 'Needless', 'say', 'Duke', 'badman', 'opposed', 'angel', 'outlaw', 'sorts', 'complicated', 'past', 'evolved', 'lawman', 'alongside', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Tombstone', 'cattle-rustling', 'gambling', 'man', 'eye', 'ladies', 'quote', 'only', 'one', 'great', 'lines', 'film', 'Quirt', 'Evans', 'John', 'Wayne', 'closed', 'eyes', 'many', 'man', 'opened', 'eyes', 'many', 'woman', 'Quirt', 'change', 'though', 'when', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'home', 'Quaker', 'family', 'transplanted', 'Pennsylvania', 'Old', 'West', 'Penelope', 'young', 'lady', 'family', 'immediately', 'love', 'obvious', 'Quirt', 'turn', 'touched', 'angel', 'very', 'start', 'little', 'odd', 'family', 'Friends', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'welcoming', 'accommodating', 'budding', 'attraction', 'going', 'considering', 'Quirt', 'past', 'see', 'only', 'good', 'man', 'Farm', 'life', 'not', 'Quirt', 'natural', 'calling', 'admittedly', 'path', 'virtue', 'time', 'up', 'fact', 'indeed', 'changed', 'course', 'happiness', 'not', 'insured', 'point', 'local', 'marshal', 'still', 'hopes', 'hanging', 'Quirt', 'day', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'Quirt', 'foster', 'father', 'real', 'threat', 'ending', 'not', 'exactly', 'unpredictable', 'heart-warming', 'entertaining', 'same.Great', 'actors', 'filling', 'great', 'roles', 'top', 'bottom', 'really', 'make', 'Angel', 'Badman', 'benchmark', 'film', 'other', 'westerns', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'indeed', 'angel', 'more', 'capable', 'touching', 'reforming', 'crustiest', 'men', 'can', 'assure', 'not', 'kind', 'Quaker', 'woman', 'would', 'quite', 'have', 'envisioned', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'instant', 'farmer', 'Duke', 'well', 'Duke', 'man', 'incapable', 'giving', 'bad', 'performance', 'best', 'film', 'have', 'love', 'minor', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'only', 'Angel', 'Badman', 'feature', 'string', 'unforgettable', 'entertaining', 'minor', 'players', 'story', 'meaningful', 'way', 'Quirt', 'old', 'buddy', 'penchant', 'telling', 'tales', 'Quirt', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'have', 'angel', 'hear', 'local', 'telegraph', 'operator', 'chance', 'encounter', 'legendary', 'cowboy', 'sets', 'off', 'bragging', 'friend', 'Quirt', 'long', 'history', 'friendship', 'Everyone', 'associated', 'movie', 'obviously', 'cared', 'great', 'deal', 'not', 'single', 'facet', 'film-making', 'was', 'overlooked', 'ignored', 'Angel', 'Badman', 'clearly', 'short', 'list', 'greatest', 'westerns', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

It is a rare Wayne movie where he plays a ""bad"" guy (but not really). Moreover, it is a western you can view with gals who would normally steer away from this genre. I wouldn't come right out and call it a chick-flick, but it does have feminine appeal. The lesson given is how does a Quaker family (who call themselves 'The Society of Friends') behave when the water is cut off to their ranch by a cranky neighbor. Taken in by this high minded family when he is wounded, Wayne's character finds a plaque on the wall of his bedroom that reads as follows:""Each human being has an integrity that can be hurtonly by the act of that same human beingand not by the act of another human being""Wayne is transformed upon witnessing how his Quaker hosts respond to the life threatening action taken by the neighbor. He is also touched by the angelic devotion shown to him by his pretty-as-can-be love interest Gail Russell. If you have seen all the great westerns and are now seeking then ones you may have overlooked, this is a great place to start.BTW - another Wayne western that is not played all that often is ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".

The sheriff follows this badman around, expecting to nail him on a new misdeed.All this seems to change, in this romantic old western, when Penelope, a young woman of the Quaker family that is nursing the bullet-wounded Evans back to health, falls in love with him. He gradually warms up to her. But she wonders--does love come all at once, or gradually? More important, are the feelings mutual?The Quaker family prays that a greedy neighbor will let them have enough water for their flocks. Evans goes to the neighbor, and uses ""friendly persuasion"" to get him to release the water. It is even better than that. He completely changes his attitude to the Quaker family. ""God works in mysterious ways,"" the family concludes.In time, Evans has had enough of all the religiosity and ""dullness"". He leaves the farm, and goes back to his old life.

Angel and the Badman is also one of John Wayne's earliest famous, full length films. The plot involves a skilled gunfighter, (Wayne), who is wounded after killing opponents in a shootout. He rides into a Quaker hometown, where he falls seriously ill. A Quaker family takes the man in and treats him like a person in a hospital that cares deeply for their patients. The family daughter (Russell), shows genuine affection for the outlaw, and takes him away from the violent life of killing and drinking. However, Wayne shows hatred for the gang that has arrived in town, and is tempted to kill the leader (Bruce Cabot). The strong and mysterious hangman appears like a ghost to convince John Wayne's character that he is going to be hanged sooner or later. The climax is exciting, with Wayne having to make a fateful decision.The sets, costumes, and story are all well made. However, the killings that take place during a cattle rustling scene and end gunfight are very realistic, and make the scenes in the new (bad) slasher flick ""Kill Bill"" look even more cartoonish and fake than they already do. But, forget that film and watch ""Angel and Badman"" for western entertainment and exciting moments. Fans of the Duke and Gail Russell will also consider this a classic.

308014,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6302320518,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is a delicious, clever, funny and heart-warming old western, which I watched with real pleasure. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.Quirt Evans (John Wayne), a gunman with quite a reputation, a shady past, a loud mouth, an attitude and a bullet in his body, is found and given shelter and care by a family of deeply religious quaker farmers, the Worths. Their young daughter, Penelope (Gail Russell), quickly fells under the charm of the wounded desperado and he also takes interest in her. But Evans past catches up with him - quickly and mercilessly...The principal strenghts of this film reside mostly in the excellent, brilliant, witty and funny dialogue, the ENORMOUS cultural shock between sober, pacifist quakers and a gunman with a pronounced taste for whisky and sin and in the youthful charm of Gail Russell, who although aged 23 at this time looked much younger and played her Penelope as a REALLY angelical (albeit strong minded) creature.There are also two secondary characters, who greatly contributed the value of this film - Wistful McClintock and Randy McCall.Marshal Wistful McClintock is an aged but clearly still greatly respected hunter of bandits, who is after Quirt Evans, just waiting for the latter to give him an opportunity to arrest and execute him. McClintock clearly considers Evans as a worthy oponent and even keeps a new, never before used rope for his hanging... This old sheriff has also a gift to arrive in total silence very close to people and surprise them - and he seems to be as patient and calm (and as ancient) as the surrounding mountains themselves. In fact, I almost had the impression that his character is supposed to be not entirely human, but rather the personalisation of Fate - and Death... An impressive character with extremely fitting first name, Marshal Wistful McClintock is played in this film by Harry Carey, an actor who was already 69 at this time (sadly, Carey died six months after ""Angel and Badman"" was released). Carey was a veteran of Hollywood, who began his career in silent cinema in 1909(!) and played in more than 250 films! As almost all of them were westerns, at his own request he was buried in a cowboy outfit. In 1963 John Wayne played himself a (very different) character named McClintock and I believe this was a mark of respect to Harry Carey, whom Wayne admired a lot.The other important secondary character, Randy McCall, is played by Lee Dixon, a stage and vaudeville actor for whom it was one of the rare (and the last) apparitions in films. Randy McCall provides tons of tongue-in-cheek humor in this film as Quirt Evans faithful, talkative and a little odd sidekick (his style of humor reminded me a little of some of Steve Buscemi roles). Sadly, this actor destroyed himself with alcohol and died in 1953 aged only 39...Lee Dixon was not the only one from ""Angel and Badman"" cast to succumb to the bottle demon. The delicious Gail Russell, who so much shined in this film, ruined in the following years her career by a drinking habit of a magnitude impressive even by Hollywood standards. She ultimately died in 1961, at age of only 36, from a heart attack caused, it seems, by years of legendary binge drinking.Now, this is an old film and today some people will probably find it naive - but I liked it a LOT! Certainly, the scenario keeps us deliberately in the dark about Quirt Evans past and we never know for sure if he is a really bad man, with innocent blood on his hands (McClintock seems once to hint that Evans killed people only in fair gunfights). This helps us (and Penelope) to like him - but it also makes this films easier and softer...That being said, there are few scenes in all history in cinema who can match in their power (and humor) the one in which, after trying drinking, gambling, whoring and even getting a dozen of cowboys beat the holy cr@p out of him in an epic saloon fistfight, Quirt Evans realizes with dismay that all greatest pleasures of a man's life are now tasteless and without interest for him - because SHE is not here...)))Bottom line this is an excellent oldie but goldie western which will cheer you up no end. Warmly recommended. Enjoy!",5,"""Quirt Evans...

To avoid that, I will have to make sure I have a free couple hours to watch the whole movie at one sitting.  That's the only reason I deduct 1 star.  I guess it's better than nothing.  Otherwise, the movie itself is great and enjoyable to watch featuring John Wayne and Gail Russell.

308020,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6302320518,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","This is I think one of the stranger John Wayne westerns in many respects, with a mostly pacifistic message and virtually no gunplay.  It's the first film he made with his own production company, John Wayne Productions - which eventually became the better-known Batjac - and it's one of just a handful of films he made in the genre from 1940-47, a period when most of his output was war films.  The director is James Edward Grant, a screenwriter who was a friend of the Duke's and worked mostly with him and only had one other directorial credit seven years later - a Mickey Spillane film with the writer playing himself.  It's probably fair to assume that Wayne had a lot of input on the direction of the film, which isn't necessarily a good thing, unless you think THE ALAMO and THE GREEN BERETS represent him at his finest.But not to worry, this is pretty decent, all around.  Our lead is Quirt Evans, onetime lawman and now apparent gunfighter-for-hire, holed up just as the film begins at the farm of the Worths, a family of Quaker settlers, with a gunshot wound.  Penelope Worth, the daughter, played by the stunningly gorgeous Gail Russell, can't help but fall for our hero of course, who decides to stick around and avoid his troubles for a little while after he heals up.  Soon enough though he gets the itch to hit the trail again - and also feels self-conscious about this peaceful religious family helping him out (they go so far as to give him a Bible with his name embossed on it) and so takes off.  After a period of hellraising in a wild town and losing money at a casino he decides to go into some rustling, but eventually has some second thoughts and ends up back with the Worths.  That doe-eyed Penny is really something.Alas peace and quiet are not to be, as bad guy Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and his henchmen just won't let ol' Quirt be, despite his being reputedly the fastest gun in that part of the west.  And Marshall Wist McClintock (gotta love the names in this film - there's also a ""Hondo"" which, like McClintock, provided a title for a later Wayne film) is keeping a serious eye on Quirt too, not believing for a second that he's ready to settle down with the peaceful Friends.  Eventually Penny gets hurt, and Quirt can't take Laredo & company's actions any longer, and he decides to do something about it...but the ending of the film is in keeping (generally speaking) with the violence-as-last-resort theme, and I think you'll be able to guess what kind of choice Quirt will make, and also how Marshall McClintock will deal with the matter.It's a bit silly and the moralism a bit simplistic, but Wayne is fine, Russell is just lovely and quite believable as the lovestruck kid, and there's some terrific work from old stalwarts like Carey and Lee Dixon as Quirt's rather cynical but good-natured friend Randy, as well as a solid saloon brawl and some good riding stunts for all the action aficionados.  All in all well worth a look for any fans of Wayne or westerns from this period.  Alas there don't seem to be any really good prints of it around; I have this fairly poor VHS but it doesn't look like the DVDs that exist are all that much better, except possibly the Goodtimes disc that a few other reviewers have mentioned.

308023,A2TY359PR45ATP,6302320518,"R. Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","This is one of my favorite John Wayne Westerns...especially among his earlier work. The Duke plays a fish-out-of-water gunslinger, aptly named Quirt Evans, who winds up being cared for by a Quaker family after being injured in a gunfight. Written and directed by James Edward Grant (who was Wayne's favorite writer) it is a departure from the old school formula Westerns so predominant in the 40s. It was also the first movie Wayne produced. Wayne's leading lady was the hauntingly beautiful, Gail Russell, who turns in a superb performance as the young daughter of the Quaker family. She falls in love with Wayne and tries to turn the gunslinger into a farmer. If you're wondering why we didnt see more of this beautiful actress, tragically she suffered from alcoholism most of her adult life, dying at the young age of 36. The support acting is pretty good too, especially Bruce Cabot as Laredo, and Harry Carey (in one of his last films) as the marshal. If you watch closely you will see an uncredited Hank Worden in a cameo role early in the film. Worden was a fixture in Wayne Westerns through the 50 & 60s. My only gripe is the quality of the DVD transfer resulting in poor visuals and a sound track that doesn't synchronize w/the actors dialogue.

Quirt insist he must reach town to send a telegram, but Thomas  insists that he and Penny will take him in their wagon. On reaching town Quirt sends a telegram registering a claim with the Land Recorder's Office.The Quakers then take Quirt back to their farm house and send for Dr. Mangram (Tom Powers)  to remove the bullet, it was several days before Quirt fully regained consciousness at that time Penny explains to him the Quakers belief in non-violence. Three weeks later, four riders come into town lead by Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and Hondo Jeffries (Louis Faust) asking questions about the whereabouts of Quirt Evans. Penny's younger brother Johnny (Stephen Grant) rushes home to warn Quirt of the strangers.Hearing the sound of approaching horses Quirt grabs his gun only to find it had been emptied when he was unconscious he quickly decides to bluff it out pointing his empty six-gun at the doorway, the visitors believe he has the drop on them! Laredo wants Quirt's land deed and offers him $5,000 but Quirt says he wants $20,000. Laredo hands over $5,000 on account, challenging him to collect the balance if he dares! When they've gone Quirt saddles up ready to leave, but Penny begs him to stay. Quirt changes his mind and stops to help out on the farm.The Worth's are having trouble a local rancher who has dammed up the stream that ran through the farm. Quirt pays a visit to the rancher who knowing of his reputation soon has the water flowing over the Worth's land. Later a visit by Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) who has  come to question Quirt about a stagecoach robbery, the Worth's  swear that Quirt was with them at the time of the robbery.

An insecure introvert who was literally pushed into pictures after a talent scout sought the ""Hedy Lamarr of Santa Monica High"" Russell became a shy, neurotic alcoholic. Russell was astonishingly beautiful and spoke with a soft sexy voice, but Stardom eluded her because of her limited acting ability combined with her fear of the cameras and of all the people around her while making films. Eventually known as ""Hollywood's Haunted Heroine"" (two of her most famous roles was Stella in THE UNINVITED, a superior ghost story, and as the governess in ...THE UNSEEN with Joel McCrea). Russell was more than adequate in such pictures as OUR HEARTS WERE YOUNG AND GAY (1944)(as Cornelia Otis Skinner) THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES (1948), a thriller with Edward G. Robinson. Some consider her work (as Sunny Garcia) in the 1950 film THE LAWLESS as her best. Russell married handsome heart-throb Guy Madison in 1949 and they divorced in 1954.

308030,AK61LQI92GTCH,6302320518,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[9, 12]","The first shot of a character in a movie often tells you quite a bit about them, and Gail Russell has a doozy of a first shot in THE ANGEL AND THE BADMAN.  While the title is running an unidentified cowboy is being chased and shot at by another group of cowboys.  Although he evades them, his horse stumbles and he falls to the ground.  Thomas Worth (John Halloran) and daughter Penelope (Gail Russell) are nearby.  Thomas jumps off the cart they're riding and rushes to the fallen stranger.  He calls to Penelope to come here, quick, and she whips the horses into a quick gallop.The first center-framed image in the film is of Penelope in the cart, shot from far below, standing tall with a dark and troubled sky framing her ethereal beauty.  There is something, this shot tells us, that is majestic and strong about her.  It's a beautiful shot.The injured cowboy is Quirt Evans (John Wayne), the Badman.  This being Wayne, and this being a film from a different era, you'll have to take his Bad-ness with a grain of salt.  When the Worth's announce they're going to tend to the injured cowboy, a bystander tells them he'd ""as soon have a black powder bomb in my house.""The Worth's are Quakers, and the movie convincingly traces the developing love between Quirt and Penelope.  Not so convincing is the interest the Law, Marshall Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) and the Bad Guys show in Quirt.  They have to be there, I guess, because Evans will have to renounce the gun or renounce the girl.  They have to be there, but the sub-plots are half-cooked.What would thee do if thee were pitching woo at a Quaker beauty?  Probably pretty much the same thing Wayne did - bounce a baby in your arms, pick a few blackberries, and leave your guns behind at the worst possible times.For an action movie this one is a little too wordy.  The Marshall and the doctor (Tom Powers) are given pages and pages of script to read.  What action there is - particularly the stampede and the cart chase - are well choreographed.THE ANGEL AND THE BADMAN is good clean fun, pleasant enough for all audiences.",3,The chased and the chaste,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,2086,"['first', 'shot', 'character', 'movie', 'often', 'quite', 'bit', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'doozy', 'first', 'shot', 'THE', 'ANGEL', 'AND', 'THE', 'BADMAN', 'title', 'running', 'unidentified', 'cowboy', 'being', 'chased', 'shot', 'group', 'cowboys', 'horse', 'stumbles', 'ground', 'Thomas', 'Worth', 'John', 'Halloran', 'Penelope', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'are', 'nearby', 'Thomas', 'cart', ""'re"", 'riding', 'rushes', 'fallen', 'stranger', 'Penelope', 'come', 'here', 'quick', 'horses', 'quick', 'gallop.The', 'first', 'center-framed', 'image', 'film', 'Penelope', 'cart', 'shot', 'far', 'standing', 'tall', 'dark', 'troubled', 'sky', 'framing', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'something', 'shot', 'majestic', 'strong', 'beautiful', 'shot.The', 'injured', 'cowboy', 'Quirt', 'Evans', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Badman', 'being', 'Wayne', 'being', 'film', 'different', 'era', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'Bad-ness', 'grain', 'salt', 'When', 'Worth', 'announce', ""'re"", 'going', 'tend', 'injured', 'cowboy', 'bystander', ""'d"", 'as', 'soon', 'have', 'black', 'powder', 'bomb', 'house', 'Worth', 'are', 'Quakers', 'movie', 'convincingly', 'developing', 'love', 'Quirt', 'Penelope', 'Not', 'so', 'convincing', 'interest', 'Law', 'Marshall', 'Wistful', 'McClintock', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'show', 'Quirt', 'have', 'be', 'there', 'guess', 'Evans', 'will', 'have', 'renounce', 'gun', 'renounce', 'girl', 'have', 'be', 'there', 'sub-plots', 'are', 'half-cooked.What', 'would', 'thee', 'do', 'thee', 'were', 'pitching', 'woo', 'Quaker', 'beauty', 'Probably', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'Wayne', 'did', 'bounce', 'baby', 'arms', 'pick', 'few', 'blackberries', 'leave', 'guns', 'worst', 'possible', 'times.For', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'little', 'too', 'wordy', 'Marshall', 'doctor', 'Tom', 'Powers', 'are', 'given', 'pages', 'pages', 'script', 'read', 'What', 'action', 'particularly', 'stampede', 'cart', 'chase', 'are', 'well', 'choreographed.THE', 'ANGEL', 'THE', 'BADMAN', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'audiences']",N/A

It looked like it was done by pressing Silly Putty onto the film stock and then onto the DVD. Just wanted to give everyone a warning to avoid that edition.Other reviews indicate this edition is a good transfer, so once I confirm that, I'll give it another star.-- Edit --This is, indeed, an excellent transfer.

The story and filming technique definitely put this film in the ""B"" western categoty. Seems Quirt Evans(Wayne)is a bad hombre, decending from a one time role as Wyatt Earp's deputy. Everybody is instantly wary when they hear his name, except for his adoptive Quaker family. Clearly, Quirt has had a colorful past, but we are never let in on the details. The story begins with Quirt on foot shooting at we don't know who in our direction, then being chased on horse by a large gang. We never get an explanation. Later, Laredo Stevensand hands come calling on Quirt with guns drawn, then hand over a bag of gold in exchange for his signature on a deed for some land. We are never given an explanation of what this was all about. Some weeks later, Quirt bolts form a Quaker meeting and his apparent girlfriend, joins two friends and waits for Laredo's gang to take over a cattle herd being driven. They then club or shoot this gang and take over the herd themselves! Next thing we know, they are celebrating in a saloon with some familiar women. Quirt starts a fight that turns into a general melee that wrecks most of the break-away saloon furnishings and banisters, before retiring to a brothel with his friends. He suddenly bolts out the door and on to his Quaker girlfriend's house! This is the man that Gail Russell's character has been making goo-goo eyes at ever since she picked him off the ground, unconscious. In the climactic scene, we have an apparent ""high noon"" stand off developing, Quirt believing Gail is dying as a result of injuries after the pair were chased by Laredo's hands. But, Gail miraculously appears just before the anticipated shootout. See the movie to find out how it ends.There are much better developed, more complicated, stories among Wayne's '40s westerns, but few of them were made by Republic, as was this one. The main attractions here are Wayne's  conflicitng reactions to his adoptive Quaker family, Gail Russell's endearing shy but persistent pursuit of what she instantly decides is her man, right or wrong, and her frequent long Loretta Young-like gazes designed to win him. Harey Carey has a most unusual role as the sheriff who keeps popping up threatening to find a valid reason to hang Quirt, yet really hoping that he will settle down with his new Quaker friends. He also has an important role in the finale.",4,"rustle from the rustlers, then marry thy quaker woman",1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,2461,"['have', 'film', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Enough', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'good', 'copy', 'story', 'filming', 'technique', 'definitely', 'put', 'film', 'B', 'western', 'categoty', 'Seems', 'Quirt', 'Evans', 'Wayne', 'bad', 'hombre', 'decending', 'one', 'time', 'role', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'deputy', 'Everybody', 'instantly', 'wary', 'when', 'hear', 'name', 'adoptive', 'Quaker', 'family', 'Clearly', 'Quirt', 'had', 'colorful', 'past', 'are', 'never', 'let', 'details', 'story', 'Quirt', 'foot', 'shooting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'direction', 'then', 'being', 'chased', 'horse', 'large', 'gang', 'never', 'get', 'explanation', 'Later', 'Laredo', 'Stevensand', 'come', 'calling', 'Quirt', 'guns', 'drawn', 'then', 'hand', 'bag', 'gold', 'exchange', 'signature', 'deed', 'land', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'explanation', 'what', 'was', 'weeks', 'later', 'Quirt', 'form', 'Quaker', 'meeting', 'apparent', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'friends', 'waits', 'Laredo', 'gang', 'take', 'over', 'cattle', 'herd', 'being', 'driven', 'then', 'club', 'shoot', 'gang', 'take', 'over', 'herd', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'celebrating', 'saloon', 'familiar', 'women', 'Quirt', 'fight', 'general', 'melee', 'most', 'break-away', 'saloon', 'furnishings', 'banisters', 'retiring', 'brothel', 'friends', 'suddenly', 'out', 'door', 'Quaker', 'girlfriend', 'house', 'man', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'character', 'been', 'making', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'ever', 'picked', 'off', 'ground', 'unconscious', 'climactic', 'scene', 'have', 'apparent', 'high', 'noon', 'stand', 'off', 'developing', 'Quirt', 'believing', 'Gail', 'dying', 'result', 'injuries', 'pair', 'were', 'chased', 'Laredo', 'hands', 'Gail', 'miraculously', 'just', 'anticipated', 'shootout', 'See', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'ends.There', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'developed', 'more', 'complicated', 'stories', 'Wayne', ""'40s"", 'westerns', 'few', 'were', 'made', 'Republic', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'attractions', 'here', 'are', 'Wayne', 'conflicitng', 'reactions', 'adoptive', 'Quaker', 'family', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'endearing', 'shy', 'persistent', 'pursuit', 'what', 'instantly', 'man', 'right', 'wrong', 'frequent', 'long', 'Loretta', 'Young-like', 'gazes', 'designed', 'win', 'Harey', 'Carey', 'most', 'unusual', 'role', 'sheriff', 'who', 'popping', 'up', 'threatening', 'find', 'valid', 'reason', 'hang', 'Quirt', 'yet', 'really', 'hoping', 'will', 'settle', 'down', 'new', 'Quaker', 'friends', 'also', 'important', 'role', 'finale']",N/A
