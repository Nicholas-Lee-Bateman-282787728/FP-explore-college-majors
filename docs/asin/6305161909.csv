451734,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,6305161909,absent_minded_prof,"[0, 7]","Matthew Modine does an amazing job in this film, as Louden Swain. He plays a high school wrestler, learning about life and love, with the help of a high-energy soundtrack and the stupendous Linda Fiorentino.  Louden decides that this, his senior year in high school, is the year his true life will begin, and starts pushing hinself to achieve superhuman performance levels as a wrestler.  He sets himself the goal of dropping to a lower weight class in order to wrestle against the titan of wrestling in his state, just to show he's got it in him.This movie has an amazing soundtrack, and an incredibly high energy level.  Viewers with a wrestling background might also like the book &quot;The World According to Garp,&quot; by John Irving, in case someone out there hasn't heard of that book.  I myself was never into wrestling, but I did do track and field, which is similar in a lot of ways -- there's no ball to seize control of, for one thing, and you basically just have to abuse yourself.Probably most people seeing this review saw this movie back when it came out in the eighties, and are looking for a trip down memory lane.  For younger, school age people, who might be looking for a good movie to get them psyched, I have a few thoughts.  One of Louden Swain's reasons for getting so into his wrestling in this movie is to get a scholarship to a good university.  He wants, at least at the beginning of the movie, to become a doctor.  If you are in a similar position, and perhaps from a family that isn't very well-informed about how such things happen, let me just tell you that wrestling wasn't really his &quot;only way out.&quot;  Far from it.  I enjoyed the excitement of this movie, but I found myself wondering if Louden Swain might have somehow used up so much energy, beating himself up as an athlete  that it might have had a negative effect on his ability to draw upon quieter, less frenzied sources of energy in his chosen career path as a healer.  Think about this, if you are a high school student seeing this movie.  Every hour Louden Swain spent doing laps, or jumping rope, or listening to &quot;Lunatic Fringe,&quot; was an hour he COULD have spent studying human anatomy in the library, or writing to college pre-med professors to see if they needed lab assistants.  Face it, high school sports feel important at the time, but...  does it really matter?  Come on.This movie is a lot of fun, but I do have a few problems with its message, and its energy.  Just a thought.  Basically, however, it is a movie with heart, which is rare, so I give it four stars.",4,Almost TOO energetic,987811200,"04 21, 2001",2001,2588,"['Matthew', 'Modine', 'amazing', 'job', 'film', 'Louden', 'Swain', 'high', 'school', 'wrestler', 'learning', 'life', 'love', 'help', 'high-energy', 'soundtrack', 'stupendous', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Louden', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'year', 'true', 'life', 'will', 'begin', 'pushing', 'achieve', 'superhuman', 'performance', 'levels', 'wrestler', 'goal', 'dropping', 'lower', 'weight', 'class', 'order', 'wrestle', 'titan', 'wrestling', 'state', 'just', 'show', 'got', 'him.This', 'movie', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'incredibly', 'high', 'energy', 'level', 'Viewers', 'wrestling', 'background', 'might', 'also', 'book', 'quot', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'quot', 'John', 'Irving', 'case', 'someone', 'there', ""n't"", 'heard', 'book', 'was', 'never', 'wrestling', 'did', 'do', 'track', 'field', 'similar', 'lot', 'ways', 'ball', 'seize', 'control', 'one', 'thing', 'basically', 'just', 'have', 'abuse', 'yourself.Probably', 'most', 'people', 'seeing', 'review', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'eighties', 'are', 'looking', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'younger', 'school', 'age', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'good', 'movie', 'get', 'psyched', 'have', 'few', 'thoughts', 'One', 'Louden', 'Swain', 'reasons', 'getting', 'so', 'wrestling', 'movie', 'get', 'scholarship', 'good', 'university', 'least', 'beginning', 'movie', 'become', 'doctor', 'are', 'similar', 'position', 'perhaps', 'family', ""n't"", 'very', 'well-informed', 'how', 'such', 'things', 'happen', 'let', 'just', 'tell', 'wrestling', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'quot', 'only', 'way', 'quot', 'Far', 'enjoyed', 'excitement', 'movie', 'found', 'wondering', 'Louden', 'Swain', 'might', 'have', 'somehow', 'used', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'beating', 'up', 'athlete', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'negative', 'effect', 'ability', 'draw', 'quieter', 'less', 'frenzied', 'sources', 'energy', 'chosen', 'career', 'path', 'healer', 'Think', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'seeing', 'movie', 'hour', 'Louden', 'Swain', 'spent', 'doing', 'laps', 'jumping', 'rope', 'listening', 'quot', 'Lunatic', 'Fringe', 'quot', 'was', 'hour', 'COULD', 'have', 'spent', 'studying', 'human', 'anatomy', 'library', 'writing', 'college', 'pre-med', 'professors', 'see', 'needed', 'lab', 'assistants', 'Face', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'feel', 'important', 'time', 'really', 'matter', 'Come', 'on.This', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'problems', 'message', 'energy', 'Just', 'thought', 'Basically', 'however', 'movie', 'heart', 'rare', 'give', 'four', 'stars']",N/A

451737,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6305161909,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 3/14Rate: 93/14: Vision Quest is my favorite Matthew Modine picture, and he is just perfect in it. He is quirky, charming, and likeable who made the role to work. To me, he is the poor man's Jeff Bridges. Linda Fiorentino is surprisingly good and effective playing Carla, the tough Jersey girl. Everybody else is superb as well. The whole plot is wonderful and believable. I love the energy about the film, and it's one of the those feel-good films that isn't afraid to play around with serious questions. Probably the best of them all is how realistic the wrestling angle is. I've wrestled for a decade and have gone to wrestling tournaments almost every weekend, wrestled for a school, watched thousands of matches, and witnessed dramatic moments. Wrestling is one of the rare sports that anyone can beat anyone; it just takes focus and determination. I've seen a girl pin a boy even though he, prior to the match, bragged about the fact that his opponent was a girl. I've seen a nobody take down a state champion. I've seen somebody who dominated the wrestling scene pre-high school, winning the AAU nationals, and then had an overrated high school career, failing to place once in the states. I've seen an artist who only wrestled for fun to beat a multiple state champion for the conference title and never wrestled again after that year. A countless of times, I've seen a unseeded wrestler to take down seeded wrestlers to win the entire tournament. I've seen some of the most thrilling matches that got the people in the stands to shake the building. I've seen a wrestler to go through high school undefeated and then get beaten silly in college. I've seen a flabby pushover to get really good within few years and take the district title. I've seen a boy get paralyzed on the mat even though he was warned not to face his opponent. I've seen alpha males to get dominated by other alpha males, and I found it impressive because I didn't think it was possible. I've seen a boy who won multiple state championships to end up in prison for good. I think I've seen it all in wrestling but maybe the sight of a coach in his singlet during practice...never ever seen that in my life. So yeah, this Brian Shute thing happens regularly. Everything I saw about wrestling in Vision Quest is pretty much true and still practiced today. The only complaint I have is that Louden's nose bleed looks minor and should have not resulted in a medical forfeit. The medical job on his nose during the match wasn't well-done. It happens all the time and is a natural part of wrestling. All in all, Vision Quest is definitely a winner.",5,My Favorite Matthew Modine Picture.,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",2014,2628,"['Viewed', '3/14Rate', '93/14', 'Vision', 'Quest', 'favorite', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'picture', 'just', 'perfect', 'quirky', 'charming', 'likeable', 'who', 'made', 'role', 'work', 'poor', 'man', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'effective', 'playing', 'Carla', 'tough', 'Jersey', 'girl', 'Everybody', 'else', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'whole', 'plot', 'wonderful', 'believable', 'love', 'energy', 'film', 'one', 'feel-good', 'films', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'play', 'around', 'serious', 'questions', 'Probably', 'best', 'how', 'realistic', 'wrestling', 'angle', ""'ve"", 'wrestled', 'decade', 'have', 'gone', 'wrestling', 'tournaments', 'almost', 'weekend', 'wrestled', 'school', 'watched', 'thousands', 'matches', 'witnessed', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Wrestling', 'one', 'rare', 'sports', 'anyone', 'can', 'beat', 'anyone', 'just', 'focus', 'determination', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'girl', 'pin', 'boy', 'even', 'prior', 'match', 'bragged', 'fact', 'opponent', 'was', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nobody', 'take', 'down', 'state', 'champion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'somebody', 'who', 'dominated', 'wrestling', 'scene', 'pre-high', 'school', 'winning', 'AAU', 'nationals', 'then', 'had', 'overrated', 'high', 'school', 'career', 'failing', 'place', 'once', 'states', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'artist', 'who', 'only', 'wrestled', 'fun', 'beat', 'multiple', 'state', 'champion', 'conference', 'title', 'never', 'wrestled', 'again', 'year', 'A', 'countless', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'unseeded', 'wrestler', 'take', 'down', 'seeded', 'wrestlers', 'win', 'entire', 'tournament', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'thrilling', 'matches', 'got', 'people', 'stands', 'shake', 'building', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wrestler', 'go', 'through', 'high', 'school', 'undefeated', 'then', 'get', 'beaten', 'silly', 'college', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'flabby', 'pushover', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'few', 'years', 'take', 'district', 'title', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'boy', 'get', 'paralyzed', 'mat', 'even', 'was', 'warned', 'not', 'face', 'opponent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'alpha', 'males', 'get', 'dominated', 'other', 'alpha', 'males', 'found', 'impressive', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'boy', 'who', 'won', 'multiple', 'state', 'championships', 'end', 'up', 'prison', 'good', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wrestling', 'maybe', 'sight', 'coach', 'singlet', 'practice', 'never', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'So', 'yeah', 'Brian', 'Shute', 'thing', 'regularly', 'Everything', 'saw', 'wrestling', 'Vision', 'Quest', 'pretty', 'much', 'true', 'still', 'practiced', 'today', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'Louden', 'nose', 'bleed', 'minor', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'resulted', 'medical', 'forfeit', 'medical', 'job', 'nose', 'match', 'was', ""n't"", 'well-done', 'time', 'natural', 'part', 'wrestling', 'Vision', 'Quest', 'definitely', 'winner']",N/A

It is only when he decides to take on the biggest challenge of his young life - with a little inspiration from his best friend masquerading as an Indian, and a nubile Linda Fiorentino as Carla - that he truly finds out about his inner strength.Shortly before Louden's senior year of high school, he decides that he is going to change weight classes and take on the best wrestler in state, Chute.  Now, Chute is basically one or two steps to the left on the evolutionary chart, a hulking, neckless, monosyllabic, Neanderthal wrestling machine who likes to watch his opponents bleed.  Unfortunately, Louden's weight loss has left him depleted, and he has been experiencing nose-bleeds since he began his drastic preparation for the state meet.The rest of the movie is an inspirational journey from adolescence into manhood, where Louden not only has to train at a breakneck pace to get himself ready for the state championship (e.g. exercising with a suit that causes extreme sweating, doing countless strengthening drills, running like Forrest Gump), but he also prepares himself psychologically by confronting his issues of fear and failure.  Along the way he also experiences his first real crush, and first genuine interaction with a woman.The drama is believable, the wrestling is credible, and the soundtrack is phenomenal.  The requisite 80s-movie montage is absolutely perfect.  Linda Fiorentino has never looked better, and her presence doesn't turn a sports movie into a borderline chick flick.  It is the quintessential, formulaic sports movie.  If you aren't inspired, touched, or excited by this movie, then I suggest that you check for a pulse.",5,Best wrestling movie ever (but we all know Chute would have won),1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,2016,"['easily', 'best', 'wrestling', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'topped', 'Louden', 'Swain', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'role', ""'ll"", 'never', 'top', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'wrestling', 'team', 'accounts', 'life', 'relatively', 'normal', 'rural', 'community', 'School', 'work', 'wrestling', 'practice', 'friends', 'helping', 'house', 'are', 'daily', 'occurrences', 'only', 'when', 'take', 'biggest', 'challenge', 'young', 'life', 'little', 'inspiration', 'best', 'friend', 'masquerading', 'Indian', 'nubile', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'Carla', 'truly', 'out', 'inner', 'strength.Shortly', 'Louden', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'going', 'change', 'weight', 'classes', 'take', 'best', 'wrestler', 'state', 'Chute', 'Now', 'Chute', 'basically', 'one', 'two', 'steps', 'left', 'evolutionary', 'chart', 'hulking', 'neckless', 'Neanderthal', 'wrestling', 'machine', 'who', 'watch', 'opponents', 'bleed', 'Unfortunately', 'Louden', 'weight', 'loss', 'left', 'depleted', 'been', 'experiencing', 'nose-bleeds', 'began', 'drastic', 'preparation', 'state', 'meet.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'inspirational', 'journey', 'adolescence', 'manhood', 'where', 'Louden', 'not', 'only', 'train', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'get', 'ready', 'state', 'championship', 'e.g', 'exercising', 'suit', 'extreme', 'sweating', 'doing', 'countless', 'strengthening', 'drills', 'running', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'also', 'psychologically', 'confronting', 'issues', 'fear', 'failure', 'way', 'also', 'first', 'real', 'crush', 'first', 'genuine', 'interaction', 'woman.The', 'drama', 'believable', 'wrestling', 'credible', 'soundtrack', 'phenomenal', 'requisite', '80s-movie', 'montage', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'presence', ""n't"", 'turn', 'sports', 'movie', 'borderline', 'chick', 'flick', 'quintessential', 'formulaic', 'sports', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'inspired', 'touched', 'excited', 'movie', 'then', 'suggest', 'check', 'pulse']",N/A

From it's captivating central character Louden Swain (Modine) right down to it's fantastic soundtrack (Red Rider, Journey). The film centers around a high school seniors' attempt to become the absolute best wrestler he can be by dropping 30 pounds to wrestle the undefeated state champion Brian Chute. Louden is nothing short of obsessed with making the weight and getting on the mat with Chute but that all changes when a homeless artist (Carla) enters his life. Vision Quest is at once a romance and a fascinating look into amateur wrestling. I can still to this day remember my wrestling coach showing us this film and being so totally pumped after it.
