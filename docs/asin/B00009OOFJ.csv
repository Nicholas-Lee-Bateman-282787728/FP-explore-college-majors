The story is wholly unbelievable, the laughs are few and far between, and the overall production makes one wonder about the sobriety of all concerned.  It isn't a screwball; it isn't black comedy; it isn't much of anything.  Arkin has never made anything this bad.",1,Bow wow,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,370,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'big', 'name', 'cast', 'script', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'dog', 'complete', 'dog', 'story', 'wholly', 'unbelievable', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'overall', 'production', 'one', 'wonder', 'sobriety', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'screwball', ""n't"", 'black', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'Arkin', 'never', 'made', 'anything', 'bad']",N/A

I figured with Arkin and Falk it would have the same chemistry as ""The In-laws"" but it never gets off the ground.  It starts out like a parody of ""Double Indemnity"" and then goes haywire.  It could have been a screwball comedy but goes off in too many directions and just falls flat.  I gave it 2 stars because Arkin and Falk do some good acting, too bad they didn't have a good script.",2,I should have listened to the 1 star reviews.,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,503,"['WOW', 'What', 'disappointment', 'should', 'have', 'listened', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'movie', 'search', 'script', 'figured', 'Arkin', 'Falk', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'chemistry', 'In-laws', 'never', 'ground', 'out', 'parody', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'then', 'haywire', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'off', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'just', 'falls', 'flat', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'Arkin', 'Falk', 'do', 'good', 'acting', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'script']",N/A

755992,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00009OOFJ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 3]","This film follows 1960's style comedies and humor. Unfortunately much of the humor and bits have been done before. Leonard (Alan Arkin) sells insurance. His three sons have all been accepted into Yale, something Leonard believes, as do many parents, they are somehow obligated to pay for their kid's college. (Where were these parents when I was growing up?) His boss won't float him a loan, so when an opportunity arises to pull off an insurance scam involving the soon to be dead Steve Rickey (Peter Falk) and his eye candy wife (Beverly D'Angelo) he agrees, but who is scamming who?As you would expect the characters are more caricatures than real people. Like so many comedies, the film starts out as probable, then possible, then improbable, and finally inane. It has a few laughs. If you crave the old style movies and can stand the formula, this one will do.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",3,WRONG NUMBER,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,908,"['film', '1960', 'style', 'comedies', 'humor', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'humor', 'bits', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Leonard', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'insurance', 'three', 'sons', 'have', 'been', 'accepted', 'Yale', 'something', 'Leonard', 'do', 'many', 'parents', 'are', 'somehow', 'obligated', 'pay', 'kid', 'college', 'Where', 'were', 'parents', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'boss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'float', 'loan', 'so', 'when', 'opportunity', 'pull', 'off', 'insurance', 'scam', 'involving', 'soon', 'be', 'dead', 'Steve', 'Rickey', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'eye', 'candy', 'wife', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'who', 'scamming', 'who', 'would', 'expect', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'caricatures', 'real', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'comedies', 'film', 'out', 'probable', 'then', 'possible', 'then', 'improbable', 'finally', 'inane', 'few', 'laughs', 'crave', 'old', 'style', 'movies', 'can', 'stand', 'formula', 'one', 'will', 'do.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",N/A
