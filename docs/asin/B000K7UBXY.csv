That show was an excellent comedy on a media, ""TV"", where there are very very few really good comedies, due to PC and the price of good writers.  It ranked with South Park and the Simpsons as consistently well written, just short of the highest standards set by Seinfeld.If you loved the show and want one affordable DVD with some footage, as opposed to ante-ing up the cost of a full season on DVD, then this is the disk to buy.If you never saw the show, this is a perfect means of seeing whether you like it without paying the full pop for a full season.",5,As good as tv comedy gets,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,614,"['DVd', 'small', 'compilation', 'best', 'Reno', '911', 'show', 'was', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'media', 'TV', 'where', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'comedies', 'due', 'PC', 'price', 'good', 'writers', 'ranked', 'South', 'Park', 'Simpsons', 'consistently', 'well', 'written', 'just', 'short', 'highest', 'standards', 'set', 'Seinfeld.If', 'loved', 'show', 'want', 'one', 'affordable', 'DVD', 'footage', 'opposed', 'ante-ing', 'up', 'cost', 'full', 'season', 'DVD', 'then', 'disk', 'buy.If', 'never', 'saw', 'show', 'perfect', 'means', 'seeing', 'paying', 'full', 'pop', 'full', 'season']",N/A

""homeland security pt1"" was next and i recognized 'oscar' from my current favorite show ""the office"" so that was a nice bonus.  then, from ""homeland security pt2"" and the next 4 episodes on(reverand gigg, officer smiley, reading ron, citizen's patrol)...it all clicked for me.  this dvd made me a fan.it's a spoof on those reality cop shows and has that shaky, cam-corder look and feel to it(which i don't like personally so it has to be good for me to even sit through stuff like that).  besides sharing the reality-tv theme with ""the office"", it also has a high cringe-worthy factor, but in a good way.  there are just some crazy, offensive, awkward, strange, and ridiculous moments in these episodes that are funny and/or cringe-inducing.  anyway, glad to see the season sets aren't much more in price than this dvd sampler cause i plan to try some seasons out in the future on amazon.special features on this disc: you get top 10 calls(about 14 minutes worth), a song performed by half the cast about not stealing cable, and dvd previews.  if you weren't a fan of the show like me, this is highly recommended.  but i see amazon has some of their full seasons for about $10-20!  i'd go with those instead.(note: i also see i failed to use any capitals.  i'm not going to re-edit)",5,an innocent bystander's review...,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,1774,"['i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'episodes', 'reno', '911', 'just', 'heard', 'was', 'close', 'renting', 'movie', 'version', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'then', 'recently', 'saw', ""'sampler"", 'dvd', 'local', 'target', 'rack', 'full', 'other', 'comedy', 'central-themed', 'dvd', '8', 'i', 'picked', 'up', 'colbert', 'report', 'dvd', 'sampler', 'one.i', 'went', 'order', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'first', 'episode', 'disc', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'was', 'really', 'iffy', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'thought', ""'this"", 'was', 'mistake', 'homeland', 'security', 'pt1', 'was', 'next', 'i', 'recognized', ""'oscar"", 'current', 'favorite', 'show', 'office', 'was', 'nice', 'bonus', 'then', 'homeland', 'security', 'pt2', 'next', '4', 'episodes', 'reverand', 'gigg', 'officer', 'smiley', 'reading', 'ron', 'citizen', 'patrol', 'clicked', 'dvd', 'made', 'fan.it', 'spoof', 'reality', 'cop', 'shows', 'shaky', 'cam-corder', 'look', 'feel', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'personally', 'be', 'good', 'even', 'sit', 'stuff', 'sharing', 'reality-tv', 'theme', 'office', 'also', 'high', 'cringe-worthy', 'factor', 'good', 'way', 'are', 'just', 'crazy', 'offensive', 'awkward', 'strange', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'episodes', 'are', 'funny', 'cringe-inducing', 'anyway', 'glad', 'see', 'season', 'sets', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'price', 'dvd', 'sampler', 'cause', 'i', 'plan', 'try', 'seasons', 'out', 'future', 'amazon.special', 'features', 'disc', 'get', 'top', '10', 'calls', '14', 'minutes', 'worth', 'song', 'performed', 'cast', 'not', 'stealing', 'cable', 'dvd', 'previews', 'were', ""n't"", 'fan', 'show', 'highly', 'recommended', 'i', 'see', 'amazon', 'full', 'seasons', '10-20', 'i', ""'d"", 'go', 'instead', 'note', 'i', 'also', 'see', 'i', 'failed', 'use', 'capitals', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 're-edit']",N/A
1031401,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B000K7UBXY,Mike,"[8, 8]","I've got the Season 1 through 3 DVD sets and bought this because I wanted the ""Rick From Citizens Patrol"" episode from the currently unreleased Season 4 set. Paul Rubens really nails the Reno 911 brand of ""strange"" with his character. He's the perfect foil for Dangle, and some of the unexplained bits (the whole Thai thing, including fixing spicy Thai soup right before the episode's ""surprise"" ending) just ratchets up the oddball factor. For the uninitiated, the ""Officer Smiley"" episode is another winner and consistently funny throughout. ""Reverend Gigg LeCarp"" has never been an episode that held up well under multiple viewings. ""Reading Ron"" has the number one gross-out moment of the entire four seasons (no spoilers in THIS review, however). Think of ""Reno's Most Wanted"" in the same vein as the single-disc Simpsons DVDs. Paramount's making a fast ""between box sets"" buck, but it's cheap, and it does have at least one ""must-have"" for people who own Seasons 1-3 already (the Rubens episode).",3,You might want to call an ambulance...he's still alive,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,1002,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'Season', '1', '3', 'DVD', 'sets', 'bought', 'wanted', 'Rick', 'From', 'Citizens', 'Patrol', 'episode', 'currently', 'unreleased', 'Season', '4', 'set', 'Paul', 'Rubens', 'really', 'Reno', '911', 'brand', 'strange', 'character', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Dangle', 'unexplained', 'bits', 'whole', 'Thai', 'thing', 'including', 'fixing', 'spicy', 'Thai', 'soup', 'right', 'episode', 'surprise', 'ending', 'just', 'up', 'oddball', 'factor', 'uninitiated', 'Officer', 'Smiley', 'episode', 'winner', 'consistently', 'funny', 'Reverend', 'Gigg', 'LeCarp', 'never', 'been', 'episode', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'Reading', 'Ron', 'number', 'one', 'gross-out', 'moment', 'entire', 'four', 'seasons', 'spoilers', 'THIS', 'review', 'however', 'Think', 'Reno', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'same', 'vein', 'single-disc', 'Simpsons', 'DVDs', 'Paramount', 'making', 'fast', 'box', 'sets', 'buck', 'cheap', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'must-have', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'already', 'Rubens', 'episode']",N/A
1031402,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000K7UBXY,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[24, 25]","Comedy Central's Reno 911 is a show that shouldn't work, yet it does.  Hilariously spoofing COPS and the police force in general, Reno 911 has managed to be a surprise hit for Comedy Central, thanks mainly to the sharp cast which do brilliant improv work in front of the camera.  As a previous reviewer has already mentioned, this DVD compilation is basically a quick cash-in attempt from Paramount and Comedy Central to while the big screen adaptation is out and the show itself is in between seasons.  However, there are some hilarious moments (including the as yet to be released episode featuring the excellent Paul ""Pee Wee Herman"" Reubens) to be found here, making this a nice pick up for casual fans of the show who don't want to purchase the season sets.  However, if you do own any of the season sets, there is really no reason at all to pick this DVD up.",4,A nice pick up for casual fans,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,864,"['Comedy', 'Central', 'Reno', '911', 'show', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'yet', 'Hilariously', 'spoofing', 'COPS', 'police', 'force', 'general', 'Reno', '911', 'managed', 'be', 'surprise', 'hit', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'sharp', 'cast', 'do', 'brilliant', 'improv', 'work', 'front', 'camera', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'already', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'basically', 'quick', 'cash-in', 'attempt', 'Paramount', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'out', 'show', 'seasons', 'However', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'including', 'as', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'episode', 'featuring', 'excellent', 'Paul', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'Reubens', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'making', 'nice', 'pick', 'up', 'casual', 'fans', 'show', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'purchase', 'season', 'sets', 'However', 'do', 'own', 'season', 'sets', 'really', 'reason', 'pick', 'DVD', 'up']",N/A
