The movie is unrelated scenes with no explanation or conclusion.  Why say the aliens can be killed and then do nothing about it.  Why research in the library when nothing comes of it.  Why does the babysitter have a map of victims on her wall? Why show it if it means nothing!!!!! Why show most of the scenes at all?  It's all just to waste time and make you as the viewer do all the work.  The aliens want to ""save"" the human race, yet they are the ones forcing people to kill each other.  They also harm children and possess people and give them nose bleeds.  The main characters fail in the end and the movie's end suggests that there will be more and more victims of this supernatural being.No where in the movie does it let you know what the motives are for the experiment.

1242088,A3UE57S8G2G72Y,B001UV4XWY,A Customer,"[3, 4]","At first I was enjoying the movie. But after a while, some things weren't making sense and I thought that they were going to be explained in the end, but it didn't happen. A creepy guy drops off a box and tells Cameron Diaz's character that if she presses the button she will not only get $1,000,000 and someone she doesn't know will die (and she shouldn't tell anyone except her husband) but he omitted to tell her that by pressing the button she can only enjoy the money if she can live with her son being deaf and blind or her husband has to kill her in order for her son to be normal. So it wasn't just about having the power to make a random person die and getting the money, her life was at stake. Consequently, the creepy guy would program the box for the next victim and tell the good part to the woman who most likely has a husband and more people would die. To be honest the concept of the story for a horror movie is good, but I don't think it lived up to the vision of the director or whoever came up with the story and for some reason due to some sort of pressure or something, the director decided to go with it...I'm just speculating. It's not like the actors were terrible. The story just wasn't well-developed. At some point I felt that Cameron Diaz's husband knew a lot more about the box and the creepy guy than his wife because of the library scene where he is watched constantly and their son looked mysterious sometimes. They don't say who the creepy guy is working for, I don't know how he got all those people to work for him, I wasn't sure what role Cameron Diaz's husband's boss was playing, how safe her son was with him at the end, etc. I guess it's supposed to be one of those movies where you give your own ending, but I didn't like it. When I finished watching it I felt that I had wasted my time. They were a lot of loose threads.

If you received a button and if you pushed it, you would get one million dollars but someone you don't know would die, would you do it? The moral of should you choose to kill someone for money is greatly displayed. The movie has two climaxes that are very distant. This movie goes from a thriller to a sci-fi in a very weird way. I didn't like the plot because the movie feels over of forty minutes in. The characters are the Cameron Diaz as Norma Lewis and James Mardsen as Arthur Lewis. Both characters are easy to connect with. Norma is a private school teacher. Arthur works at NASA and is ready to get accepted into the astronaut program. They have one son who question grade school boy. I am going to give the movie just a 2 out of 5 stars because it besides the moral the movie went from a little weird and creepy to nonsense. There isn't any sexual scenes, just some kissing between a married couple. The only cursing is Arthur yelling ""Jesus Christ"" several times.

1242095,A16ZKEWQ6DLO45,B001UV4XWY,amerk,"[2, 3]","...that's not always a good thing. ***SPOILERS ABOUND*** When I watched this with my wife, I told her the movie felt like some episode of the Twilight Zone extended into a 2-hour film. When I was talking about how bad this movie was with a work buddy of mine, I told him that it was like Donnie Darko (an excellent film) with a lot of crazy stuff happening. Little did I know until I researched further, it was based on a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone (which was based on ahort story by Richard Matheson), and the director of this atrocity was also the director of Donnie Darko. However, a story like this works best as a short skit for shows like ""The Outer Limits"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" but not so much as a movie unless you really go to lengths to change it up and make it coherent. And unlike Donnie Darko, this made absolutely no sense and had an ending that left me feeling the film was unresolved. The problem with the movie are the questions left behind. Sure, some movies require the audience to think and come up with their own interpretations, but this is not one of them. Let me say that the movie is not at all boring, it kept me and my wife on the edge of our seats trying to figure this out, but the ending just left most of everything unresolved. Here is a breakdown of all that is confusing:1) If you push the button somebody will die. Early on, the audience believes that this means somebody will be killed, which coincidentially happens. But it does not. Because the couple are given an option to either live with the money and their ""now deformed"" son or the husband shoots the wife and the son gets restored. Yes, you can argue that by living with the money, their son won't be the same, so it can be like death, and I'm not going to contest it. 2) All the ones to die appear to be women shot by husbands. Is this because women are theo only ones to push the button? Or is there something binding between mother and child, that only a woman can be killed in order to restore the child? 3) The woman cannot sacrifice herself by killing herself to restore their child. They must be murdered by their husband. What?? So this ""being"", whatever he is, acts self-righteous about the plight of mankind, yet he condones murder and domestic violence? 4) This ""being"", as I refer to him as, seems to be able to control the minds of his ""employees"". Who are these employees? Were they previous people who had pushed the button? What is their role? 5) The library scene of choosing between damnation and salavation, he chose salvation and still was tormented by the events that unfolded, so what was the point? 6) The dead wife's husband, who had the box previously, shows up about 3/4 into the film and spews off nonsense about the CIA, and government operatives, and what not, but it doesn't go anywhere. Nor do we ever get to really know what is truly going on.Now all of this I can generally ignore and move on except for the ending. I've looked everywhere and nobody can explain it. The husband is arrested by the police and then unexpectedly the handcuffs are removed and he is placed into what looks like a government car with similar NASA plates as the one the Mr. Stewart is driving. Somebody looks at him and says we are going to take care of you. And then it ends. Does this mean that he won't be arrested but have to serve as one of Mr. Stewart's employees? And if so, how will this benefit him? Will this redeem him for pushing the button?

The next day Frank Langela acting as Arlington Seward, a man with a severe facial disfigurement appears at their door. He gives them instruction that they would win a million dollars, if they pressed the button on the top but the only downside is that someone unknown to them will die. I think the movie was interesting till this point but soon loses steam because it goes nowhere. In short, it gets very complicated and makes the viewer uneasy.

They are obviously in love and `happy', but they are living paycheck to paycheck and are meeting a series of devastating setbacks in their personal life.  Arthur works for NASA and Norma is a teacher.  They also have a young son.  When the film opens, it is quarter-to-six in the morning and there is a knock at the front door.  Norma discovers a box on their doorstep.  That box contains a wooden box, locked, with a button inside.  There is also a note that states a man will be visiting them at five that afternoon with further instructions.  Long story short, Norma is informed that she has twenty-four hours to decide whether or not she will push the button.  If she does she will receive one-million dollars.  Also, someone that she does not know will die.Now, I have a few issues with the handling of the film from that point forward, namely because the moral complexities that are thrust upon us at that moment could have taken this film ANYWHERE, and I had in mind a place I really thought it would go (especially once Arthur asks the questions ""How well do you know me?  How well do you know Walter?"") but instead, the film takes a slightly different course, one that involves extra-terrestrials and eventually makes its message known (the same message that kind of ruined `The Abyss' for me) and left me a tad wanting.  Yes, this film is far from perfect.STILL, there is a lot going on here that works rather beautifully, and the moral issues presented, while not the ones I anticipated, surely leave room for thought provoking conversation.  The idea that mankind was ruined on the whim of a woman (Adam and Eve) and that history is sure to repeat itself (Norma's decision to push the button) are subtle yet poignant POV's that really underline the context of this film.While I found the overall handling of Arlington Steward and his `minions' to feel rather clich&eacute;d and `scare tactic 101', I also found that it didn't take away from the film nearly as much as it could have.I was pleasantly surprised with the performances gathered together here, especially that of Cameron Diaz, who was marvelous.  I had actually heard some love thrown her way by a slew of my cinephile friends who thought the film a dud but thought her performance was Oscar worthy.  She really was outstanding here.  She not only nailed the accent work and nostalgic embodiment of the era (she felt like she belonged there), but she also layered her every move with a deep-rooted understanding of her characters current situation.  The scene where she expresses her reasons for loving Arlington, in the library, was just beautifully done, and that final scene where she pleads with her husband to `make the right choice'...it is effortlessly captured.She is such a great actress who fails to get the recognition she deserves!In the end I must say that this film has received a bad rap.  It is actually a very smart and provocative film.  Sure, it has some areas that make little sense and it needed a little tightening up here and there, but overall this film offers a lot more than most released these days.",4,"Mostly, pushes all the right buttons...",1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,3885,"['expected', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'movie', 'trailer', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'seemed', 'nonsensical', 'reviews', 'were', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'Overall', 'had', 'planned', 'skipping', 'movie', 'altogether', 'recently', 'found', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'kind', 'mood', 'decided', 'revisit', 'films', 'saw', 'one', 'was', 'playing', 'Cinemax', 'hesitated', 'brief', 'moment', 'before', 'decided', 'just', 'give', 'go.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.Yes', 'Box', 'few', 'more', 'few', 'holes', 'up', 'short', 'brilliant', 'much', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'cult', 'favorite', 'director', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'Box', 'goods', 'see', 'end.The', 'story', 'told', 'young', 'family', '70', 'who', 'happen', 'get', 'rare', 'proposition', 'Norma', 'Arthur', 'are', 'falling', 'tough', 'times', 'are', 'obviously', 'love', 'happy', 'are', 'living', 'paycheck', 'paycheck', 'are', 'meeting', 'series', 'devastating', 'setbacks', 'personal', 'life', 'Arthur', 'NASA', 'Norma', 'teacher', 'also', 'have', 'young', 'son', 'When', 'film', 'quarter-to-six', 'morning', 'knock', 'front', 'door', 'Norma', 'box', 'doorstep', 'box', 'wooden', 'box', 'locked', 'button', 'inside', 'also', 'note', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'visiting', 'five', 'afternoon', 'further', 'instructions', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'Norma', 'informed', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'decide', 'not', 'will', 'push', 'button', 'will', 'receive', 'one-million', 'dollars', 'Also', 'someone', 'not', 'know', 'will', 'die.Now', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'handling', 'film', 'point', 'forward', 'namely', 'moral', 'complexities', 'are', 'thrust', 'moment', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'ANYWHERE', 'had', 'mind', 'place', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'go', 'especially', 'once', 'Arthur', 'questions', 'How', 'well', 'do', 'know', 'How', 'well', 'do', 'know', 'Walter', 'instead', 'film', 'slightly', 'different', 'course', 'one', 'extra-terrestrials', 'eventually', 'message', 'known', 'same', 'message', 'kind', 'ruined', 'Abyss', 'left', 'tad', 'wanting', 'Yes', 'film', 'far', 'perfect.STILL', 'lot', 'going', 'here', 'rather', 'beautifully', 'moral', 'issues', 'presented', 'not', 'ones', 'anticipated', 'surely', 'leave', 'room', 'thought', 'provoking', 'conversation', 'idea', 'mankind', 'was', 'ruined', 'whim', 'woman', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'history', 'sure', 'repeat', 'Norma', 'decision', 'push', 'button', 'are', 'subtle', 'yet', 'poignant', 'POV', 'really', 'underline', 'context', 'film.While', 'found', 'overall', 'handling', 'Arlington', 'Steward', 'minions', 'feel', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'scare', 'tactic', '101', 'also', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'film', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'performances', 'gathered', 'together', 'here', 'especially', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', 'was', 'marvelous', 'had', 'actually', 'heard', 'love', 'way', 'slew', 'cinephile', 'friends', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'dud', 'thought', 'performance', 'was', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'really', 'was', 'outstanding', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'nailed', 'accent', 'work', 'nostalgic', 'embodiment', 'era', 'felt', 'belonged', 'there', 'also', 'layered', 'move', 'deep-rooted', 'understanding', 'characters', 'current', 'situation', 'scene', 'where', 'reasons', 'loving', 'Arlington', 'library', 'was', 'just', 'beautifully', 'done', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'husband', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'effortlessly', 'captured.She', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'who', 'get', 'recognition', 'end', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'received', 'bad', 'rap', 'actually', 'very', 'smart', 'provocative', 'film', 'Sure', 'areas', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'needed', 'little', 'tightening', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'released', 'days']","Box, The (DVD)"

1242099,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B001UV4XWY,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[5, 6]","While watching this film, there were a few things going through my mind: 1)Why hadn't it gotten more recognition in the theaters? 2)It seemed to be a lot like a lengthy version of a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode.Although this was not a perfect film, it was a very intriguing and craftily made one. I've heard many negative reviews, especially ones bashing the film's ending, which left a couple of loose ends. Personally, that is what I liked most about it. As an American audience, we expect filmmakers to answer every question, so that, when the film reaches its end, we're left completely 100% satisfied. Although many or most films tie in all the loose ends, great ones, for the most part, do not. That is why we can take pleasure in viewing them more than once. I will agree that there are many films where the writer or director does a poor job of pasting the story together in the conclusion (such as The Grudge, Hide and Seek, and other such films). The Box's indefinite ending seems deliberate and, for lack of a better word, fitting. Every question I felt needed answering, was; and everything else was left for my mind to attempt to piece together by itself. That comes to show the movie did its job, at least for me.Another thing to like is the production values of this film. It was terrificly shot, it captured the 70's perfectly, and it made the circumstances of the main couple seem very intense and severe. The entire film, I strongly felt for these two people because, although they did act on selfish impulse, I don't really think they were fully aware of what they were getting themselves into. My family saw this movie before I did and warned me that it was confusing and left them wanting more; so I came into The Box speculating. As I was watching, I realized the plot of this film served as somewhat of a modern fable or parable, showing the consequences of a society driven by greed. I felt it was supposed to be viewed as that, and not meant to be rationalized. In rationalizing the film, I feel many people lost what was truly important about it. I'm sure many asked: who are ""the employers"" or who really are the extra-terrestrial type humans in the motel? Why doesn't the story specify? My answer to this is: it doesn't have to.I felt The Box worked in somewhat of a Theological level as well. In a society where people are playing God, the people become God. The absence of God is strongly felt in this movie, regardless of your religious affiliation. I thought this was interesting, because I think this is something the director was attempting to tackle. In the end, we don't know who the odd people roaming the setting of this film are: they can be a symbolic representation of God (or a lack of one) or they can be aliens from another planet. But, like I said before, in the end, these questions don't matter, because they all result in the same thing.My suggestion is that you walk into this film with no preconceived notions, or expecting to hate it; because, the fact of the matter is, most Americans (who want their fairytale ending where everything is in black and white) probably did hate this movie. The film is very unconventional and odd. It makes you want to rationalize all the plot-points, but the film itself seems to break away from the realm of rationality, which means you do too. You'll see that once you let your mind rest and accept the film for what it is, you will be utterly intrigued and highly entertained. Give this film a shot; I hope you won't regret it.",4,Worthwhile film.,1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,3523,"['watching', 'film', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'mind', '1', 'Why', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'more', 'recognition', 'theaters', '2', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'lengthy', 'version', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'craftily', 'made', 'one', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'especially', 'ones', 'bashing', 'film', 'ending', 'left', 'couple', 'loose', 'ends', 'Personally', 'what', 'liked', 'most', 'American', 'audience', 'expect', 'filmmakers', 'answer', 'question', 'when', 'film', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'completely', '100', '%', 'satisfied', 'many', 'most', 'films', 'tie', 'loose', 'ends', 'great', 'ones', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'not', 'why', 'can', 'take', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'more', 'once', 'will', 'agree', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'where', 'writer', 'director', 'poor', 'job', 'pasting', 'story', 'together', 'conclusion', 'such', 'Grudge', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'other', 'such', 'films', 'Box', 'indefinite', 'ending', 'deliberate', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'fitting', 'question', 'felt', 'needed', 'answering', 'was', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'left', 'mind', 'attempt', 'piece', 'together', 'show', 'movie', 'did', 'job', 'least', 'me.Another', 'thing', 'like', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'was', 'terrificly', 'shot', 'captured', '70', 'perfectly', 'made', 'circumstances', 'main', 'couple', 'seem', 'very', 'intense', 'severe', 'entire', 'film', 'strongly', 'felt', 'two', 'people', 'because', 'did', 'act', 'selfish', 'impulse', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'were', 'fully', 'aware', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'family', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', 'warned', 'was', 'confusing', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'so', 'came', 'Box', 'speculating', 'was', 'watching', 'realized', 'plot', 'film', 'served', 'somewhat', 'modern', 'fable', 'parable', 'showing', 'consequences', 'society', 'driven', 'greed', 'felt', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'viewed', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'rationalized', 'rationalizing', 'film', 'feel', 'many', 'people', 'lost', 'what', 'was', 'truly', 'important', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'asked', 'who', 'are', 'employers', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'extra-terrestrial', 'type', 'humans', 'motel', 'Why', ""n't"", 'story', 'specify', 'answer', ""n't"", 'have', 'to.I', 'Box', 'worked', 'somewhat', 'Theological', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'society', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'playing', 'God', 'people', 'become', 'God', 'absence', 'God', 'strongly', 'felt', 'movie', 'regardless', 'religious', 'affiliation', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'think', 'something', 'director', 'was', 'attempting', 'tackle', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'odd', 'people', 'roaming', 'setting', 'film', 'are', 'can', 'be', 'symbolic', 'representation', 'God', 'lack', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'aliens', 'planet', 'said', 'end', 'questions', 'do', ""n't"", 'matter', 'result', 'same', 'thing.My', 'suggestion', 'walk', 'film', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'expecting', 'hate', 'fact', 'matter', 'most', 'Americans', 'who', 'want', 'fairytale', 'ending', 'where', 'everything', 'black', 'white', 'probably', 'did', 'hate', 'movie', 'film', 'very', 'unconventional', 'odd', 'want', 'rationalize', 'plot-points', 'film', 'break', 'away', 'realm', 'rationality', 'do', 'too', ""'ll"", 'see', 'once', 'let', 'mind', 'rest', 'accept', 'film', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'utterly', 'intrigued', 'highly', 'entertained', 'Give', 'film', 'shot', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']","Box, The (DVD)"
1242100,A1LI2P529P9IRP,B001UV4XWY,Artistic Mind,"[5, 8]","This movie was NOT AT ALL what I expected. From the trailer I expected an action-packed movie. But no, instead I get an extremely offsetting movie that made me wish I could fast forward to an ending that would make it all worth while. However, once I got to the end, I was left with this: W-T-F. Seriously. That was the only thought on my mind. This movie didn't make sense to me, and it isn't worth watching again to understand further. I personally hated this movie. I feel that the plot was ultimately pointless.Would I have pressed the button? Maybe, if I were 5. But as an American who grew up in a Christian home, I'm familiar with the old story of Adam and Eve. Forbidden apple anyone? No thanks. Even if I wasn't, I'm also familiar with Pandora's Box. You know, the box that the woman wasn't supposed to open, but one day she just HAD to. At least it took her longer than 24 hours to cave. Well over 24 hours. I know the consequences of my actions. I know I would not press the button, especially in 24 hours. There might have been a struggle if I was forced to have the box in my home until I died. THEN, I probably would struggle with not pressing it since I would have years of convincing myself into doing it.Honestly, I don't think most people would risk killing someone, in the course of 24 hours when they are not put into a life threatening situation like Saw victims, a kidnapping, etc. I just don't buy any of it. Thank GOD I didn't buy this movie! Fortunately for me, it came on HBO.Watch it for free, if you HAVE to. But I would pass on this movie all together. There's better things to do with your time. Seriously. Read a book. Watch a better movie. Fly a kite. Seriously. Anything is better than this movie.Edit: I wrote this immediately after viewing it. I do have to add that the rating system is on how much the VIEWER enjoyed the movie. As always, there is an audience for this movie, I just don't think it's a large audience. If you enjoy mystery & sci fi then you MIGHT enjoy this movie. I like mysteries & sci fi movies, but I was not a fan of this movie. I feel like the point of this movie ****SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON OUT, DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED************************** I feel that the whole point of this entire movie was to dish out ONE line to the viewers, and one line only. Well, technically several lines, but you get what I mean.  That line is this: ""Your home is a box. Your car is a box on wheels. You drive to work in it and you drive home in it. You sit at home staring at a box. It erodes your soul while the box that is your body inevitably withers then dies whereupon it is placed in the ultimate box to slowly decompose.""It's a very true and powerful quote. But it can also be meaningless. You can choose to be pessimistic, optimistic, or indifferent about life while being a realist. No choice is wrong, or right. I mention this because I feel that pessimistic people would enjoy this movie more so than others because of the similarity in viewpoints. But many others will feel cheated of their time at the end of this movie. Why? Because a movie with a ""life sucks"" mood isn't worth watching, unless it gives a suggestion on how to make life ""suck"" less.",1,Forbidden Apple anyone?

1242101,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001UV4XWY,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I think I'm completely confused.  Something doesn't seem quite right with the Box.  The storyline in the beginning is about an old man who drops off a mysterious box in front of a families house real early in the morning.Later on, the old man returns and explains to the couple (the wife specifically) what exactly will happens when she presses this button connected to the box.  Someone will then die.  It will be someone the wife doesn't know, but someone WILL in fact die.  However, the family will then receive 1 million bucks just for simply pressing the button.It brings up an interesting question- would *you* push that button knowing how much money you'd receive, and considering how bad the economy is right now?  You could use it!So the next 30 minutes is about the wife and husband asking each other whether they should press the button or not.  A good moment of detail is when the husband asks his wife if she believes she will feel any remorse for someone being killed that they don't even know.The wife apparently has no sympathy whatsoever and doesn't care either way- she just wants the money because of all the problems the family is going through at the current time.Anyway, what completely confuses me is just WHAT the heck happened?  The storyline seemed to point to a movie being about a crazy murderer on the loose and threatening random people around town... but then -to my total shock- the Box actually turns into a sci-fi???Yup, that old man with a huge gash on the side of his face is actually someone who got strike by lightning, was killed, came back from the dead and turned into an alien.  I guess.  He has these amazing abilities that nobody else on the planet has, and considering so much of the storyline focus was about the planet Mars, I assume he was some kind of alien.He sure loved giving people nosebleeds.  It seemed like everyone had a nosebleed at some point.Oh well, the point is- the storyline shows absolutely NO signs of turning into a weird sci-fi flick, but that's exactly what the second half is about.  Oh sure, before the second half everyone was walking around acting a bit quiet and strange, but there's plenty of non-alien reasons for that!I feel disappointed.  However, the fact that the storyline actually has some rather terrifying moments and tells a fairly easy to understand story makes me reconsider my initial reaction of giving it 3 stars.  It's actually a good movie, but it's not at ALL what I expected.

James Marsden and Cameron Diaz do a credible job of playing Norma and Arthur Lewis and the supporting cast, such as Norma's old south mother, is excellent. Frank Langella is also wonderful as the mysterious man with the box. Yet the film misses the mark and leaves viewers disappointed. The plot initially seems simple and may be a morality tale about human being's value systems and altruism, but the science fiction got in the way of a coherent final product. In the end, the viewer asks: What did the US government have to do with this alien's plans for humanity? Why were humans transported to some distant reality through a hotel pool? Why were the scenes looking up references in the library included? Why did the baby sitter have a victim map on her motel bedroom wall? Why did the box man not fulfill his end of the bargain? There were too many lose ends. There was one coherent philosophical thread that made some sense. Norma asks the box man if there is no forgiveness, and though he shows compassion, the chain of events has begun and the implication is that in this deterministic world that the chain of events must unfold even if weak humans wish to repent of their past actions and decisions. Thus eventually, she must make the existential decision that is the payment for her earlier actions and decisions. Too bad that this theme was not explored more fully even if the discussion between the box man and Norma in the library was very interesting and the final scenes between Norma and Arthur are extremely dramatic.

1242115,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001UV4XWY,Chris Pandolfi,"[45, 52]","""The Box"" is one of those films where a lot of adjectives are necessary. It's taut and suspenseful, but it's also metaphysical, ponderous, cerebral, unexplainable, and above all, preposterous. It goes in all different directions, sometimes caught up in circles, sometimes taking detours, sometimes going completely off course. It's a bizarre, unpredictable story of intrigue and paranoia, continuously twisting and turning, pushing the limits of comprehension with a slew of seemingly unrelated concepts; we begin with a button and a suitcase full of money, but this soon gives way to spiritual quandaries and sinister science fiction subplots, the latter of which involves radio signals from Mars, physical disfigurements, and hordes of mind-controlled drones with bleeding noses. There's even an ongoing social experiment, which could be indicative of a morality play.Based on Richard Matheson's short story ""Button, Button"" and its 1986 ""Twilight Zone"" adaptation, ""The Box"" takes place in Richmond, Virginia in 1976, and I honestly don't know whether or not that's a significant plot point. We meet Norma and Arthur Lewis (Cameron Diaz and James Marsden), a cash-strapped suburban couple who awaken one morning to find a plainly wrapped package left at the front door. Inside is a black wooden box topped with an encased red button. Neither one knows what to make of it until receiving a visit from the mysterious Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), who, for as yet unknown reasons, is missing the left side of his face. If the Lewis' decide to unlock the box and push the button, he explains, two things will happen: They will be given $1 million dollars in cash, and someone they don't know will die.Will one of them push the button? It's not as if they couldn't use the money. Norma, a literature professor, learned that her school will no longer provide free tuitions for children of the faculty, which doesn't bode well for her son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). She also has a severely damaged foot in need of repair. Arthur, a NASA scientist involved in the creation of a Mars camera, is no longer being considered for the astronaut program because he failed the psychological exam. But the fact remains: Their financial security will come at the expense of ending someone else's life. Norma tries to reason that it may be a death row inmate. Arthur tries to reason that it may be their neighbor or a baby. Heck, it may even be himself or their son. How well does she know either one of them? How well do they know her?I'm not going to reveal whether or not the button gets pushed. I will say that, from this point on, the story ventures into even stranger territory, befuddling itself with inexplicable paranormal occurrences, gateways that may or may not lead to salvation, deeply rooted scientific conspiracies, motel rooms with maps pinned to the walls, secret wind tunnels, and a brief discussion of Sartre's vision of hell. Who is Arlington Steward? Who are the people walking around with nosebleeds? If the box is capable of being programmed, then why are there no mechanisms inside it? What's the significance of a murder that has a man on the run? Does Arthur's Mars-related research have anything to do with what's going on? Does Norma's damaged foot?As to whether or not all the above questions are answered, I'm not entirely sure. Writer/director Richard Kelly clearly has his own ideas about logical story patterns and how they should be followed. And yet, there is something to be said for creating a sense of apprehension out of nothing at all; if you can engage the audience in spite of a cumbersome plot, if you can keep them hooked by continuously building tension, then you've made a successful film. ""The Box"" may be a confusing mess, but it's also one of the most absorbing mysteries I've seen all year. The plot can be deconstructed any number of ways, but I suspect we're not supposed to learn so much as experience. And we do. For a film that's neither believable nor understandable, that's quite an achievement.The ending unfolds in yet another display of twisted logic, and it culminates in a final shot that brings up an entirely new series of questions. What's the message ""The Box""? That damnation can only be avoided by resisting temptation? That humanity must be willing to sacrifice for the greater good in order to survive? That existence as we know it is just a temporary state and death is a period of transition? Or is it that there isn't a message at all, that the whole thing is just an exercise in psychological thrills?

It holds an innocuous wooden box topped with a button secured under a glass dome. The couple are initially befuddled by it's presence until the appearance of the enigmatic Mr Steward (Frank Langella), who offers them a most bizarre choice: if they push the button, they will receive one million dollars tax free but, as a result, the button will take the life of someone they don't know. Arthur and Norma, despite their apparent affluence, are struggling financially - but can they really take Steward's offer seriously? And if so, can they really put a price on a human life?""Donnie Darko"" alumnus Richard Kelly's third film, ""The Box"", takes the central conceit of Richard Matheson's short story, ""Button, Button"" (previously adapted as an episode of the resurrected ""Twilight Zone"" in the eighties) and uses it to weave one of the most ambiguous, suggestive and deeply satisfying films that I've ever seen and restores my faith in him as a director (something I'd previously lost after the messy farrago of his sophomore effort, ""Southland Tales"").""The Box"" is undoubtedly Kelly's most deeply personal film to date. I thought the characters of Frank and Norma were far more interesting than the usual stock sketches that populate this kind of film, and was pleasantly surprised to discover, whilst watching the extras on the DVD, that this is because they are based on Kelly's parents: Kelly's father, its turns out, really did work on the Viking Lander missions and his mother was genuinely afflicted by the ailment that afflicts Diaz' character in the film. But ""The Box"" is far more than just a love letter to his parents; It is also an homage to the classic Watergate-era paranoid conspiracy thrillers/science fiction movies. If you're a fan of films like Philip Kaufman'sInvasion of the Body Snatchers (Collector's Edition), Alan J. Pakula'sThe Parallax View, Bryan Forbes'The Stepford Wives (Silver Anniversary Edition)and Nicolas Roeg'sThe Man Who Fell to Earth (Special Edition),  you'll notice myriad stylistic and aesthetic references to those films and others of that genre. In many ways the pairing of Matheson and Kelly is a match made in conspiracy heaven as Kelly, like Matheson, really excels when he pricks an audience's sense of unease by hinting at dark worlds populated by mysterious strangers and sinister organisations that function just below the banal surface of everyday life.As with it's spiritual predecessor, ""Donnie Darko"", Much in this film is suggested and vaguely alluded too rather than made explicit and, as with Kaufman's ""Body Snatchers"", even the most innocuous background details begin to take on a sinister import (American bicentennial footage featuring the twin towers of the world trade centers playing on a television in a scene seem to suggest that the sinister machinations of the box's owners have played out ominously in the future). Kelly brilliantly captivates the audience's attention whilst working their nerves with his juxtaposition of the mundane and strange. There are moments in this film which are positively Lynchian.Performances are excellent and unexpected: James Marsden is an actor who I'd written off following a couple of deeply unmemorable turns in the generally execrable ""X Men"" movies and Cameron Diaz is an actress who I'd mentally relegated to a file marked ""humourous eye-candy"", but to give both leads their due, they really do knock the ball out of the park here. However, the star of this show really is Frank Langella, whose turn as the ambiguous Mr. Steward is a masterclass in understatement. I can't discuss his performance without ruining many of the twists and turns of this film, but I will say that such is the strength of his performance that I found myself coming to empathise with a character with whom one should really feel no empathy.To my mind ""The Box"" is a masterpiece for the same reason that William Freidkin's ""The Exorcist"" is a masterpiece: it took an abstract concept and treated it in a way that is simultaneously surreal, suggestive and grittily rooted in a sense of the everyday and yet still managed to make me buy into it's reality.I very much doubt that I'll see a better film this year and I recommend it unreservedly.",5,To Push Or Not To Push?,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,4400,"['Richmond', 'Virginia', '1976', 'mysterious', 'cardboard', 'box', 'up',

Most people would bust out laughing and then slam the door in this weirdo's face. However, Cameron Diaz seems to have no problem inviting this strange man into her home. We later find out that this strange man is some type of alien that apparently works for the goverment. Once again, Are you serious? This movie is not only stupid but it's very dull.

No question this is a peculiar movie but I found it intriguing. I liked the way I was fed clues as to what was ultimately happening. To me this story unfolded in such a way as to keep me guessing but not confound me to the point of feeling lost.I won't recount the story as others have already done so, but I liked it pretty much start to finish. I noticed that most reviewers here did not care for it at all and I suppose I can see why. When it becomes plain that we're dealing with an alien invasion it comes on somewhat abruptly. I was put off a bit but I stuck with it and I felt things recovered nicely.This is not a new concept in science fiction. The human race being tested for its worthiness to continue to occupy the universe is old, old, old but it's given a nice spin here. And while some complain about some of the acting, I can't say I disagree, but It didn't bother me that much either. It certainly wasn't horrible and the pacing and tone of the movie precluded the need for balls to the wall performances. What was happening, to me, was more important than the people to whom it was happening. This is not to say I didn't care or feel for them. I just felt they did a good enough job to move the story along.If there is anything that left me with questions it was the religious angle of the movie. That the events take place around the Christmas holidays is significant and there are pointed references to the afterlife. So since the plot hinges on the ""you are what you do"" concept of existence what is Kelly saying? That there is a God and an afterlife but it makes no difference, (or should make no difference) in the choices we make.

1242133,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B001UV4XWY,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[24, 33]","I really wanted to like this movie. I love Twilight Zone-type stories. I love sci-fi mysteries, and weird movies. But, do you know what I like more? Movies that have a point to it. The Box may have many well-done parts & elements to it, but stacked together, the movie comes crashing down in a disappointing heep of pointlessness & potential. Let's divide this movie into three parts, shall we? Warning: Here be spoilers!The first 45 minutes really plays kind of like the type of Twilight Zone where something weird happens that eventually leads to a moral dilemma. This moral dilemma comes packaged in a box, and happens to be a box with a button in it. Pushing the button promises to give the couple a million dollars, but it will also kill somebody the couple doesn't know. What would you do? You don't know if The Box is real. Heck, it could be one big joke! Granted, the guy who gave it to you gave off some bad vibes, but hey, how do you know he's telling the truth? It doesn't help that the couple has also recently learned of financial issues. A cheaper education for their son is denied, followed promptly by nose-bleeding by the denier. And the husband is denied entry into the NASA space program (I wouldn't be surprised if nose-bleeding occurs after this decision was made). So essentially, the first 45 minutes really is spent building characters, setting the mood and establishing a little of the reality. This of course all climaxes in Cameron Diaz pushing the button, leading her to basically be the 'Eve' in this 'Adam & Eve' story.Before we move on to part two, let's talk about the cast, shall we? James Marsden really hasn't been given a chance to show off his acting skill before now, but really, the guy can act, and he's naturally likable. Basically, I want to see more James Marsden in the future. Frank Langella is of course a fine actor, and he does the best with his character. As for Cameron Diaz, while her character is interesting enough, I was really put off by her southern accent. At least with Sandra Bullock in the Blindside I got over it after a while. Not true with Diaz here. It didn't help that she was trying REALLY hard in this movie too. But anyways, let's move on to part 2.The 2nd part of the movie turns into a homage to the paranoid conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s. This is probably the part that works most for me, as I ate most of it up. There were Zombie people, nose-bleeding, people in photographs, murder conspiracy. Richard Kelly just gets the mood so right in this aspect of the film, and it makes for a very good period piece. Of course, this is also the part of the movie  where a LOT of stuff is thrown at you. I personally was able to keep up, but despite all the mysteries being explored, I didn't really feel like we were solving anything. Or even that we were being given enough information to solve it. Thus, I felt like I was grasping at slippery straws, looking for something, anything to help me grab onto a semblance of what this movie was trying to say. This 2nd act culminates in a library. This sequence again proves that the mood & paranoia at this part of the movie is just right. There's a part where James Marsden is being followed by an increasing number of zombies in the library that is just excellently done. Of course, for James Marsden, he's led to three portals, two of which lead to hell. Well, that can't be good! I don't really know why, or what is happening right now, but it still can't be good! Cameron Diaz also meets up with Frank Langella again and Cameron gets to have an emotional moment, and gives a revelation that I thought would actually go somewhere. I don't think it ever does. Basically, Cameron Diaz is turned into a Zombie, James Marsden apparently walks into the ""correct"" portal. Let's recap quickly. We have all these building blocks that haven't really gone anywhere comprehensible yet, let's hope Richard Kelly can bring it all back around in the 3rd act.But just when you think it can't get anymore weirder... IT DOES!3rd Act: We learn that Frank Langella actually used to work for NASA, but then was struck by lightning when the Viking Probe got too close to a planet or something, so Frank Langella basically dies, then turns into a messenger type for what I believe is aliens. It's never actually stated who his ""employers"" are, but they do have access to the afterlife, and crap like that. Then, at a wedding, James Marsden is shown by a previous guy who had received the box a bunch of pictures, and diagrams, and told that he also received a box and killed his wife to save his daughter. But then, that guy is killed. All the while, we are seeing other characters, including the kidnapped son into these portal pools. Why? I HAVE NO CLUE! Then we find out that the boxes are actually a test sent by the aliens or somebody to test humanity to see if they deserve living. In this way, it's like another Twilight Zone episode, one where the aliens are testing humans to see if they're ready to join their ranks, to which of course, the humans usually fail the tests. Anyways... Basically, to pass the test, you're supposed to simply NOT PUSH THE BUTTON. Then we jump to Diaz's and Marsden's house, where Frank Langella gives them ANOTHER TEST. Since they pushed the button, they must pay by either their son going deaf and blind for the rest of his life, or James Marsden killing his wife. Since the couple decide that they're the ones that brought this on themselves, Marsden shoots Diaz, perfectly knowing what happened to the previous couple, to which Diaz dies, Marsden is arrested, and their son is basically going to die as an orphan since the last Dad didn't exactly last very long in the land of the living. The movie ends with Frank Langella giving another box to another family. By the way, the moment before Diaz dies, another couple pushes a button, leading us to believe that this is an eternal cycle that will eventually doom humanity to extinction.Sorry if this review has been plot-heavy, but I had to tell you how INSANE and FRUSTRATING this movie was. But, it didn't have to be like this. Let's say that the movie ended the same way it does, but it shows another couple deciding NOT to push the button, thus not dooming humanity to extinction. Or how about this? Go all ""Knowing"" on us and actually show the world getting destroyed because everybody had pushed the button. As is, the movie gives us closure on the two central characters, I guess, but little else, especially in terms of plot. What is the moral of the movie? Don't be selfish, even when aliens are making your financial lives harder. As is, humanity is doomed to extinction because they pushed a button. An exploration of free will? Maybe. The better decision here would be to press the EJECT button on your DVD player.",2,Don't Push That Button Or We'll All Go Extinct,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,6814,"['really', 'wanted', 'like',

1242136,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B001UV4XWY,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","""The Box"" was written and directed by Richard Kelly, director of ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales"" based on a short story called ""Button, Button"" by Richard Matheson which also inspired an episode of the Twilight Zone. This movie stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as a couple chosen for a social experiment - whether if given the opportunity to be given a million dollars they will push a button on this box, knowing that the action will result in the death of someone else.Normally I would be really into a psychological thriller like this, especially from the same guy as ""Donnie Darko"". The premise is intriguing and could really get a lot of discussion going on who is conducting the experiment and why, but I felt this movie actually gave too many answers away. It was derailed and fell into a realm of weirdness that was very disappointing to watch.Cameron Diaz as a young mother/teacher with a deformed foot was sometimes heartbreaking to watch as she struggled day to day and at other times surprisingly monotone as she delivered her lines. Granted some were very simple lines and could have been jazzed up a bit but you would think someone with her experience could play a little more with subtext in that situation. James Marsden was endearing for his obvious love of his wife but it seemed like he was very slow to react in bizarre situations.Frank Langella played the mysterious Mr. Steward (haha, get it?) who delivers the box to the couple and answers some of their questions and leaves others a mystery. He has a deformity of the face from being struck by lightning. I think his acting was creepy, mysterious, properly monotone and always acting like a gentleman even when presenting a macabre choice. However, too much was given away about his origins and who he was.This story clearly works better in the short version. By stretching it out, they invented many additional angles with NSA, Langley, NASA, family, school, and neighborhoods and it was a lot to juggle. The bigger the conspiracy got, the smaller it got too with the possibilities of what it could mean. There was a lot of waiting for things to happen and too much drawing out of scenes meant for suspense but not achieving it entirely. A few good moments does not a screen gem make! An hour or less would have done this one just fine. If I didn't already like this genre of film, I would have thought less of it so the average person probably wouldn't like it much.",3,The Box Movie Review,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,2451,"['Box', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'director', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'called', 'Button', 'Button', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'also', 'inspired', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'movie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'James', 'Marsden', 'couple', 'chosen', 'social', 'experiment', 'given', 'opportunity', 'be', 'given', 'million', 'dollars', 'will', 'push', 'button', 'box', 'knowing', 'action', 'will', 'result', 'death', 'someone', 'else.Normally', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'especially', 'same', 'guy', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'could', 'really', 'get', 'lot', 'discussion', 'going', 'who', 'conducting', 'experiment', 'why', 'felt', 'movie', 'actually', 'gave', 'too', 'many', 'answers', 'away', 'was', 'derailed', 'fell', 'realm', 'weirdness', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'watch.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'young', 'mother/teacher', 'deformed', 'foot', 'was', 'sometimes', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'struggled', 'day', 'day', 'other', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'monotone', 'delivered', 'lines', 'Granted', 'were', 'very', 'simple', 'lines', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'jazzed', 'up', 'bit', 'would', 'think', 'someone', 'experience', 'could', 'play', 'little', 'more', 'subtext', 'situation', 'James', 'Marsden', 'was', 'endearing', 'obvious', 'love', 'wife', 'seemed', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'react', 'bizarre', 'situations.Frank', 'Langella', 'played', 'mysterious', 'Mr', 'Steward', 'haha', 'get', 'who', 'box', 'couple', 'questions', 'others', 'mystery', 'deformity', 'face', 'being', 'struck', 'lightning', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'creepy', 'mysterious', 'properly', 'monotone', 'always', 'acting', 'gentleman', 'even', 'when', 'presenting', 'macabre', 'choice', 'However', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'origins', 'who', 'was.This', 'story', 'clearly', 'better', 'short', 'version', 'stretching', 'out', 'invented', 'many', 'additional', 'angles', 'NSA', 'Langley', 'NASA', 'family', 'school', 'neighborhoods', 'was', 'lot', 'juggle', 'bigger', 'conspiracy', 'got', 'smaller', 'got', 'too', 'possibilities', 'what', 'could', 'mean', 'was', 'lot', 'waiting', 'things', 'happen', 'too', 'much', 'drawing', 'scenes', 'meant', 'suspense', 'not', 'achieving', 'entirely', 'A', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'not', 'screen', 'gem', 'make', 'hour', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'just', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'like', 'genre', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'less', 'average', 'person', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'much']","Box, The (DVD)"

You put a vague trailor together with an interesting concept, and put it in a box.  The problem: the box - both figuratively and literally - is completely empty.  Aside from the guy with a hideous scarring - but easy access for brushing his molars - this movie is essentially like the old game show, ""Press Your Luck.""  When presented with the option, most people will push the button delivering riches, even though they know there is a Whammy lurking or someone else may suffer.  It just would have been nice to have a coherent, somewhat unambiguous script - which is replete with mumbo jumbo about aliens, lightning, secret government cover-ups involving the NSA and the CIA, some unexplained nonsense about the realities of magic, secret water doorways to alternate dimensions, and more loose ends than in Buckwheat's fro - that wasn't completely and preposterously insufficient of relaying the intended message.Oh well, I guess it takes two to tango.  Convenience and circumstance do no substitute for plot, nor do they serve as a resolution, but I get partial blame for paying to see this drivel.  Maybe I should just pay my money without looking too deeply into things.  Or, if Sarah Jessica Parker were involved: never look a gift horse in the mouth.

1242147,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001UV4XWY,J from NY,"[6, 8]","With Francis Lawrence's damn near perfect adaptation of Richard Matheson's horror classic ""I Am Legend"" and now Richard Kelly's stunning, Twilight Zone-like translation of the author's short story ""Button, Button"", we are at long last seeing an underappreciated, unjustly obscure horror/sci-fi/western author into mainstream film.  Better late than never--his friend Stephen King has enjoyed this success (for better or worse) since his writing took off with ""Carrie"".  Even that great film with Dennis Weaver, ""Duel"", enjoys only a fraction of the attention that King gets from simply penning his name on any film that comes around.""The Box"" has a general air of disorientation, metaphysical confusion, and immanent doom that many of the original Twilight Zone episodes had (many written by Matheson himself).  Cameron Diaz is brilliant as Norma Lewis, a middle class mother who with a puzzling foot and and Arthur, a dedicated husband also brilliantly underplayed by James Marsden.  Living lives of quiet desperation and hard up for cash to ensure a future for their children, they seem perfectly ordinary--therefore ripe for the pickings of a man (Frank Langella) who shows up at their door with a box, guaranteeing them one million dollars if they press the clown-nose like button within.Langella's creepy, yet at times tender performance as Arlington Stewart, the ""salesman"" who most will undoubtedly think is the devil himself after things go awry, takes the cake.  He is not what he appears to be and yet he is also not what does *not* appear to be--the decision is ultimately the viewer's.  His ""employers"", whether they be God Himself and his angels or malevolent extraterrestrial entities testing the altruism of humanity in a kind of moral suicide mission, are certainly not happy with the human race.  The ideals of Christian love, exemplified best perhaps by Norma and her compassion for Stewart's hideous appearance are also counterbalanced by something more ominous that each viewer will have to figure out for themselves.  If one views the film as a moral fable solely, which would be sort of difficult considering the nosebleeds, the NASA component, etc, it would be thus: don't do something selfish for your own sake that will have a karmic rebound affect and immediately hurt another person.  This is a gorgeous movie and a sort of full color TZ episode to end all TZ episodes.  I'm sure Rod Serling would have loved it.  Finally, Richard Matheson is getting his due.

1242152,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B001UV4XWY,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[7, 9]","""The Box"" is a metaphoric and atmospheric film, to say the least. That it is meant quite seriously becomes obvious through the deliberately serious acting by Cameron Diaz in a role unlike any other roles she has played.A mother close to her son approaching his teen years, a wife faithfully bound to a brilliant scientist-husband who has not yet earned an elusive success, a teacher who inspires her students in non-traditional ways--Diaz plays each with aplomb, with serious intent. I always think of Diaz as the co-star of that Vegas movie with the handsome Ashton Crutcher and her partially fluff role. There is NO fluff in ""The Box."" This is a serious, even if freaky and strange, film about the nature of man/woman.When faced with a decision to push a button (no alerts needed here because the premise of the button is shown on every advertisement). We know she pushes it and that someone will die, but we don't know the consequences. Consequences...Wouldn't you just know that pushing a button to get millions BUT simultaneously causing someone's death would have consequences?The Prophet in the Old Testament warns  that there is nothing new under the sun--that we commit the same ol, same ol, over and over. ""The Box"" shows us that premise so clearly. It's the Garden. Here's the apple. Obey or eat it? We know that decision and those consequences, but a box? With a button? Causing someone's death? Didn't Eve's decision cause Death, more or less? Metaphor. Life is metaphor, symbol, virtual reality. This film is just a reflection.Diaz's character's decision is not arbitrary. We experience her day. We know she has this disintegrated foot which becomes part of the hallucinatory aspect of the film that contributes to the button-pushing decision. We know she is not a fluff character. This woman is a high school teacher who is discussing a Sartre play with her class when one of the students asks to see her foot. Oddly enough (as odd goes in this film), she removes her boot to show her foot. Cause-and-effect, cause-and-effect.Frank Langella plays the messenger, the delivery man, the executive's assistant who was struck by lightning only to become an other-ly type of human. He works for an-other, the ""Boss."" God perhaps? If it's God, it's that God to which some attribute evil. A loving God would not force such a decision on his creation. Except--the concept of Free Will. I could make either case that Diaz has free will or is fated (because of Eve's long-ago decision, or even God's Will that humans be disobedient so that he can show the Way back to obedience).Dear Reader, do you ""get"" that this is a twisted film, full of darkness but potential light, OR light until darkness (evil decisions) enters?

Suffice...it may have been the worst screenplay or editing of any movie I've ever seen. I recommend highly not to waste the almost two hours only to walk away unsatisfied and not even caring what the answers are to all the dangling questions.

The problems of the movie are many: the movie gives hazy glimpses of ""employees"" who seem to work for the man who makes ""the box"" offers, yet even the box man is working for someone else - it would have been nice to have a clearer explanation of who the box man is and the reason/s why the experiment (what I got from it is some kind of alien population is conducting experiments on humans and only humans can stop this experimentation by ""making the right choice"" and if they don't make the right choice, there is a threat of annihilation by said unknown alien leaders) is being done. The movie is confusing, shallow, and goes off on several tangents which either have nothing to do with the storyline or which also go unresolved (Norma and the box man connect briefly, but it doesn't seem to mean anything or change anything; we never find out how the ""employees"" are made and why, where they come from, and where they go; the involvement of the children just didn't seem to fit the equation set by the box man; and the list of unanswered questions goes on).

1242162,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B001UV4XWY,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[3, 4]","Richard Kelly'slatest film, THE BOX, is a remake of an oldTwilight Zoneepisode penned by Richard Matheson called ""Button, Button.""  The story is about a young, penurious couple that are visited by a stranger with a box.  The box is fitted with a button, and if the couple pushes the button, they will be awarded more money than they've ever seen.  The catch: somewhere someone they don't know will die.  The TV show's punch came at the end, after the couple decides to push the button.  The stranger shows up immediately and gives the couple their money.  He takes the box and prepares to leave when the wife asks what he will do with the box.  ""The box will go to another couple,"" the man says.  ""Who?"" they ask.  He smiles.  ""Don't worry,"" he says.  ""No one you know.""Zing!This is where the TV show ends, wisely, letting the dawning realization provide the story with its emotional force.  This, however, is just where the movie gets started.  When I heard the concept for the film, I wondered how Kelly could take a twenty minute television segment and turn it into 100 minutes worth of movie.  The answer?  He gets weird.  For Kelly, this is no big surprise.Saying much more would spoil the movie's bizarre second and third acts.  Needless to say, our young couple (played well by Marsden and not-so-well by Diaz), grapple with the after-effects of their decision to press that button, an action with repercussions that stretch out to their young son, Diaz's lecherous students, and Marsden's coworkers at NASA.  Also, lightning?I don't know.  The film makes a modicum of sense when it wants to (although without much grace, since the movie's answers are so complex, they necessitate some very deliberate spelling out), but mostly it's just an excuse for Kelly to demonstrate the cinematography and imagery his work is so famous for.  There are some truly creepy moments in the movie -- ever have an entire library of people turn and stare at you at the exact same time? -- as well as some eye-ball popping sets and scenes, but it's all just elaborate window dressing on a concept that worked better when it actually had no window.  In other words, the TV show worked because it didn't need to be explained and -- furthermore -- because it contained portents instead of actual doom, leaving viewers to imagine the doom themselves.THE BOX, as striking as its imagery may be, is a weak film if for no other reason than because of its glut of answers, because of its In Your Face Doom.  It's a guarantee that audiences of the TV show, if they wondered about the box's origins and functions, would NEVER have imagined the solutions posed by Kelly, and in that sense the movie is fresh and new.  But in the same sense, it means that all the niggling ominousness of the original tale is replaced by chaotic sci-fi tomfoolery.  Viewers with a philosophical bent might find something here worth mulling over, and fans of sci-fi eye candy need look no further, but it's a fair bet that everyone else will leave the film feeling disappointed.",3,Which Is Creepier: Questions or Answers?,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,3036,"['Richard', ""Kelly'slatest"", 'film', 'THE', 'BOX', 'remake', 'oldTwilight', 'Zoneepisode', 'penned', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'called', 'Button', 'Button', 'story', 'young', 'penurious', 'couple', 'are', 'visited', 'stranger', 'box', 'box', 'fitted', 'button', 'couple', 'button', 'will', 'be', 'awarded', 'more', 'money', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'catch', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'die', 'TV', 'show', 'punch', 'came', 'end', 'couple', 'push', 'button', 'stranger', 'up', 'immediately', 'couple', 'money', 'box', 'prepares', 'leave', 'when', 'wife', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'box', 'box', 'will', 'go', 'couple', 'man', 'Who', 'ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'one', 'know', 'Zing', 'where', 'TV', 'show', 'wisely', 'letting', 'dawning', 'realization', 'story', 'emotional', 'force', 'however', 'just', 'where', 'movie', 'started', 'When', 'heard', 'concept', 'film', 'wondered', 'how', 'Kelly', 'could', 'take', 'twenty', 'minute', 'television', 'segment', 'turn', '100', 'minutes', 'movie', 'answer', 'weird', 'Kelly', 'big', 'surprise.Saying', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'Needless', 'say', 'young', 'couple', 'played', 'well', 'Marsden', 'not-so-well', 'Diaz', 'grapple', 'after-effects', 'decision', 'press', 'button', 'action', 'repercussions', 'stretch', 'young', 'son', 'Diaz', 'lecherous', 'students', 'Marsden', 'coworkers', 'NASA', 'Also', 'lightning', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'modicum', 'sense', 'when', 'much', 'grace', 'movie', 'answers', 'are', 'so', 'complex', 'necessitate', 'very', 'deliberate', 'spelling', 'out', 'mostly', 'just', 'excuse', 'Kelly', 'demonstrate', 'cinematography', 'imagery', 'work', 'so', 'famous', 'are', 'truly', 'creepy', 'moments', 'movie', 'ever', 'have', 'entire', 'library', 'people', 'turn', 'stare', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'eye-ball', 'popping', 'sets', 'scenes', 'just', 'elaborate', 'window', 'dressing', 'concept', 'worked', 'better', 'when', 'actually', 'had', 'window', 'other', 'words', 'TV', 'show', 'worked', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'explained', 'furthermore', 'contained', 'portents', 'instead', 'actual', 'doom', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'imagine', 'doom', 'themselves.THE', 'BOX', 'as', 'striking', 'imagery', 'may', 'be', 'weak', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'glut', 'answers', 'Face', 'Doom', 'guarantee', 'audiences', 'TV', 'show', 'wondered', 'box', 'origins', 'functions', 'would', 'NEVER', 'have', 'imagined', 'solutions', 'posed', 'Kelly', 'sense', 'movie', 'fresh', 'new', 'same', 'sense', 'niggling', 'ominousness', 'original', 'tale', 'replaced', 'chaotic', 'sci-fi', 'tomfoolery', 'Viewers', 'philosophical', 'bent', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'here', 'worth', 'mulling', 'fans', 'sci-fi', 'eye', 'candy', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'fair', 'bet', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'disappointed']","Box, The (DVD)"

It kept me guessing and in the end...I couldn't stop thinking about what I'd just witnessed and how much I want to see it again so I can study it further.No, it was not the best sci-fi film ever...not even the best by the director, Richard Kelly. But, what it was is an engrossing, interesting, and (although it was based on a short story and Twilight Zone episode) original film, produced in an era where run-of-the-mill actions and romantic comedies rule the screen. And the acting wasn't too shabby either. Cameron Diaz's fake Southern accent could be a little much at times, but I think that was the intention. And Frank Langella was phenomenal.Plain and simply, rent this before you buy it. It is a movie you'll likely either 'get' or loathe ravenously. But you should at least give it a chance. Yes, the plot is a bit incoherent at times, but it's not supposed to be an easy movie...it's cerebral and visual.

1242177,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B001UV4XWY,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[4, 4]","What makes the premise of this intriguing film so satisfying is its simplicity.  A middle class couple facing financial difficulties is presented with a choice: push a button and they will be given a million dollars in cash ... and, someone they don't know will die.  The problem is that the filmmakers develop an overly elaborate and inexplicably bizarre back story packed with visually intriguing ideas that never really go anywhere in order to account for why they were given the choice in the first place.  It's not that it doesn't make sense, and it's not (as another reviewer suggests) that I wasn't paying attention or came into it expecting something else ... I get it and I get what Richard Kelly was going for and I actually kind of enjoyed the film all along but it didn't all add up and for many elements of the film the more you think about them the more hokey they begin to seem.  Like the three watery portals that, at one point, James Marsden's character is presented with and told he must choose one and enter, with an ominous warning about the consequences of choosing incorrectly.  Sure, they looked cool, but what was the point?  It's not clear whether he chose correctly or what was really at stake and he just ends up somewhere else all wet and confronted with a more important question.  Unlike some of the other ""tests"" that are given throughout the film, this one didn't have any kind of clear moral implications.It's a fun watch, though; it's creepy and atmospheric, and kept me intrigued for the most part throughout.  The look of the film captures the early '70s nicely.  I liked the deliberate references to Sartre's infernal classicNo Exit- and for a while it felt like the aim of the film was to reinvent the themes of that play on a larger scope.  I also thought it was clever (even if a bit cynical, and with shades of misogyny) that the choice represented by the box was delivered to a woman, who ended up pressing the button but shared the consequences with her husband, and it was hard not to see the red round button as a kind of update to Eden's apple.  It's just that in the end all of the metaphysical and moral weight that the film had managed to build and sustain starts to sag, and the mystery that felt like an elaborate theological and existential puzzle is mostly resolved (with a few deliberately loose ends) and you are left with an overly baroque and even somewhat silly but unfunny cosmic joke taken way too seriously (of course, that's not a bad description of life, the universe and everything from a certain point of view ... maybe that of Sartre).Still, I don't want to leave on that note, since it strikes me as too harsh - I'm being harsh because my hopes were pretty high.  Richard Kelly's got a lot of potential and has some great ideas and knows how to translate them to the screen - it's just he has too many ideas and apparently no one there to help him eliminate the excessive -- the best scripts find a way to deliver maximum intensity and reflection by the simplest means.  This one, at least, is much more tight than the at times brilliant but mostly incoherentSouthland Talesbut lacks the simplicity of the first incarnation ofDonnie Darko(I thought the director's cut of Darko showed tendencies of the problem I'm describing here: once he starts to explain the ""physics"" behind the intriguing concept, it starts to get hokey and over-elaborate).

Vanilla Sky (2001) in particular comes to mind. Some movies can seem confusing on the surface, but if you are willing to dig deeper, the payoff is there. This, however, is not one of those films.**contains spoilers**Clearly the correct response of the test subject is to not push the button. Does anyone not push the button? We don't know, but we can assume most probably do push the button, hence the dreariness of the film. So those that do push the button are left with consequences of their decision to be either A) keep the money and live with your deaf/blind son/daughter or B) have the spouse kill the other spouse that actually pushed the button, forgoing the money, but your son/daughter will regain his/her sight and hearing and be back to normal, albeit with only one parent and presumably knowing the spouse killed the other spouse. Not such a good option either way, though I think you would have to choose to leave your son/daughter blind and deaf wouldn't you? It would be an equally if not worse fate I think for the child to grow up knowing one parent was murdered by the other. However, I don't have any problem with this story arc.The problem comes in what the director says on the Blu Ray commentary about how the higher powers that are conducting these experiments are giving clues to the man/woman about how there is salvation after death. That somehow it will be OK if the wife is killed by the husband because she will be going to better place and will receive some sort of salvation. But, if that's true, what really is the point of their experiments anyway? Earlier on the commentary the director said that the higher powers were conducting these experiments to see if the human race was worthy of salvation or if they should simply be destroyed completely. So, what sense does it make to give salvation to someone who failed the experiment? If so, why do the experiments in the first place?This to me is the big dilemma in the film. The experiments though an interesting story angle just aren't well described enough to make any sense. I suppose the director is perhaps trying to leave it to your imagination, but there are just too many holes here to make this a meaningful film.Final Grade: C+",3,"SUSPENSFUL, BUT CONVOLUTED",1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,2381,"['have', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'came', 'defense', 'have', 'had', 'deeper', 'messages', 'film', 'had', 'be', 'deciphered', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', '2001', 'particular', 'mind', 'movies', 'can', 'seem', 'confusing', 'surface', 'are', 'willing', 'dig', 'deeper', 'payoff', 'there', 'however', 'not', 'one', 'films', '**contains', 'spoilers**Clearly', 'correct', 'response', 'test', 'subject', 'not', 'push', 'button', 'Does', 'anyone', 'not', 'push', 'button', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'assume', 'most', 'probably', 'do', 'push', 'button', 'hence', 'dreariness', 'film', 'do', 'push', 'button', 'are', 'left', 'consequences', 'decision', 'be', 'either', 'A', 'keep', 'money', 'live', 'deaf/blind', 'son/daughter', 'B', 'have', 'spouse', 'kill', 'other', 'spouse', 'actually', 'pushed', 'button', 'forgoing', 'money', 'son/daughter', 'will', 'regain', 'his/her', 'sight', 'hearing', 'be', 'back', 'normal', 'only', 'one', 'parent', 'presumably', 'knowing', 'spouse', 'killed', 'other', 'spouse', 'Not', 'such', 'good', 'option', 'way', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'choose', 'leave', 'son/daughter', 'blind', 'deaf', 'would', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'not', 'worse', 'fate', 'think', 'child', 'grow', 'up', 'knowing', 'one', 'parent', 'was', 'murdered', 'other', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'story', 'arc.The', 'problem', 'what', 'director', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'commentary', 'how', 'higher', 'powers', 'are', 'conducting', 'experiments', 'are', 'giving', 'clues', 'man/woman', 'how', 'salvation', 'death', 'somehow', 'will', 'be', 'OK', 'wife', 'killed', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'better', 'place', 'will', 'receive', 'sort', 'salvation', 'true', 'what', 'really', 'point', 'experiments', 'anyway', 'Earlier', 'commentary', 'director', 'said', 'higher', 'powers', 'were', 'conducting', 'experiments', 'see', 'human', 'race', 'was', 'worthy', 'salvation', 'should', 'simply', 'be', 'destroyed', 'completely', 'So', 'what', 'sense', 'make', 'give', 'salvation', 'someone', 'who', 'failed', 'experiment', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'experiments', 'first', 'place', 'big', 'dilemma', 'film', 'experiments', 'interesting', 'story', 'angle', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'described', 'enough', 'make', 'sense', 'suppose', 'director', 'perhaps', 'trying', 'leave', 'imagination', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'here', 'make', 'meaningful', 'film.Final', 'Grade', 'C+']","Box, The (DVD)"

1242188,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001UV4XWY,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","**1/2Based on the short story ""Button, Button"" by Richard Matheson, Richard Kelly's ""The Box"" starts off as an intriguing morality tale with a ""Twilight Zone"" flair, but the longer the movie goes on the sillier it becomes.Cameron Diaz and James Marsden play a married couple living in Richmond, Virginia in 1976.  He works for NASA, while she teaches at a local prep school, although both receive disturbing news about the continued viability of their jobs and careers.  One morning, they discover a strange package lying on their doorstep, one that contains a mysterious box whose purpose is not immediately apparent to either of its recipients. Enter Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), an enigmatic stranger with a grotesquely disfigured face, who informs the couple that, if they push the button on the box, they will receive a million dollars in return.  The catch is, though, that when they do that, someone they do not know is going to die.So far, so good, as the movie explores the moral dilemma facing these two obviously decent people who certainly would never think of shooting a stranger in the head for a million dollars, but who just might be willing to push a button with the same result if they didn't have to see the death they'd be inflicting on an innocent party in the process.  It might even be an allegory about how people living in the First World don't much care if someone in the Third World has to suffer or be exploited (or perhaps even die) to support their lifestyle, so long as the First-Worlders don't have to know about it and thus can continue living at ease with their consciences.  Unfortunately, the movie isn't able to leave well enough alone, and soon it's devolved into an incoherent mess involving brainwashing, government conspiracies, extraterrestrials, and out-of-body experiences, all swimming around in a stew of metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.  The problem is that very little of it makes any kind of sense and, though the audience keeps waiting for an explanation, one never comes.The movie also suffers from an unnervingly high quotient of goofiness and cheesiness, both in its look and in its performances.  There are times when you find yourself wanting to laugh, even though you know you're supposed to be taking it all with the utmost seriousness (the actors sure seem to be).  The biggest culprit in this regard is the musical score, which is so overemphatic and melodramatic that it becomes almost a parody of itself - much like the film itself in fact.",2,starts off well but quickly goes downhill,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2501,"['**1/2Based', 'short', 'story', 'Button', 'Button', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'Box', 'off', 'intriguing', 'morality', 'tale', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'flair', 'longer', 'movie', 'sillier', 'Diaz', 'James', 'Marsden', 'play', 'married', 'couple', 'living', 'Richmond', 'Virginia', '1976', 'NASA', 'local', 'prep', 'school', 'receive', 'disturbing', 'news', 'continued', 'viability', 'jobs', 'careers', 'One', 'morning', 'discover', 'strange', 'package', 'lying', 'doorstep', 'one', 'mysterious', 'box', 'purpose', 'not', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'recipients', 'Enter', 'Arlington', 'Steward', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'enigmatic', 'stranger', 'grotesquely', 'disfigured', 'face', 'who', 'couple', 'push', 'button', 'box', 'will', 'receive', 'million', 'dollars', 'return', 'catch', 'though', 'when', 'do', 'someone', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'going', 'die.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'movie', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'two', 'obviously', 'decent', 'people', 'who', 'certainly', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'shooting', 'stranger', 'head', 'million', 'dollars', 'who', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'push', 'button', 'same', 'result', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'death', ""'d"", 'be', 'inflicting', 'innocent', 'party', 'process', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'allegory', 'how', 'people', 'living', 'First', 'World', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'someone', 'Third', 'World', 'suffer', 'be', 'exploited', 'perhaps', 'even', 'die', 'support', 'lifestyle', 'so', 'long', 'First-Worlders', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'thus', 'can', 'continue', 'living', 'ease', 'consciences', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'able', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'soon', 'devolved', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'involving', 'brainwashing', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'extraterrestrials', 'out-of-body', 'experiences', 'swimming', 'around', 'stew', 'metaphysical', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'problem', 'very', 'little', 'kind', 'sense', 'audience', 'waiting', 'explanation', 'one', 'never', 'comes.The', 'movie', 'also', 'unnervingly', 'high', 'quotient', 'goofiness', 'cheesiness', 'look', 'performances', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'find', 'wanting', 'laugh', 'even', 'know', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'utmost', 'seriousness', 'actors', 'sure', 'seem', 'be', 'biggest', 'culprit', 'regard', 'musical', 'score', 'so', 'overemphatic', 'melodramatic', 'almost', 'parody', 'much', 'film', 'fact']","Box, The (DVD)"

It narrates the story of Adam and Eve as we know it from the Bible (Quran has a different point of view about the story but I can get to that later).If you have not seen the movie, please do not continue reading.Norma and her husband are living a happy life together (Adam and Eve in Heaven before the fall).  One day a stranger knocks on their door and lures them with a box that will give them a million dollars if they were to press a button in it (Satan luring Adam and Eve to eat from the forbidden tree).  The husband resists when he knows the other part of the deal: someone you dont know will die. But Norma keeps nagging and finding excuses why it is ok to press the button. The husband thinks of the worst (a child could die), but Norma thinks only of what can make her feel ok about pushing the button (it could be a criminal waiting for his death row).  Again this is a depiction of the Bible's story about Eve being the one who pushed Adam to eat the fruit.  Then, when the button is pressed, hell breaks loose (Adam and Eve fall from heaven to inhabit earth).  Norma and husband are faced with choice after another, none of which is reasonable.  The movie portrays that human beings are faced every day with choices that are all bad ones and we choose the one that we think is less bad.  There is nothing that is good. Even when something good happens, it is shortlived and one doesnt have time to enjoy it (they took the 1 million USD an didnt get to spend it and enjoy it).

And the big picture is, maybe, similar toLot asking God what would God do if he finds but 10 good people? Well, Arlington is not God, And Arlington is not employed by God; this is a cold, factual examination, and maybe that is why it is so chilling?

This is one of those movies that you are supposed to form your own opinion about what happened. If I wanted a movie like that, I would write my own. It implies that Aliens have taken over the body of a dead man (who was struck by lightning) and now are conducting some kind of altruism experiment. But there is no climactic ending, just basically nothing. Sure there are a number of ""hints"" like purgatory, or the afterlife or whatever. But the risen character (the conduit for the aliens ""tests"") talks about his employers not about god or a supreme being. We are then to surmise that his employers (aliens) are running this ""test"".I guess the author either couldn't come up with a real ending or was just too lazy at that point of writing to finish it.In retrospect, there are some other serious problems with this story. One of the central characters, a wife and mother decides she is willing to kill someone for money. Yet she is not a stupid, illiterate, mean or loveless person, yet we are to assume that for a few luxuries she is now willing to kill someone. All of a sudden she becomes a hitman for hire? As the story went on, this action becomes completely unbelievable as it would be totally out of her character to do that. Then we are to assume that the husband is willing (brainwashed) to kill her to restore their son to all of his faculties? I didn't buy it. Again, the character of the husband is an intelligent caring person so that makes his murdering of his wife totally out of character and implausible. One reviewer said ""financially overextended"" about the husband and wife, I disagree. This couple appeared to be a normal working couple who like many others dreams of more but to kill someone for it? I don't think so, not in this case.This movie could have been so much better. I would have made the incentive to push the button significantly different, not for money but to trade the life of their son for the life of someone they do not know. That would be a much tougher and understandable decision. I would have shown the aliens and imbued them with a total lack of understanding of Love so that with this experiment they are trying to find the meaning.

There is one thing we both agree on: The Box is an auditory focused film. In fact, with only minor adjustments to the script, it would make a great radio play. So, unless you are committed to paying a great deal of attention to every word spoken, you are bound to get lost and confused by the complex plot. In these times of short attention spans, this is an obstacle the film makers may not have taken into consideration... Pity, as the film is actually quite original and the story intriguing.The Box is based on a 1970 short story ""Button, Button"" by Richard Matheson (also the author of the celebrated ""I Am Legend""). A financially overextended middle class couple receives a package containing a box with a button. A strange and grossly disfigured man later visits their house and explains should they choose to press the button, they will receive $1mil, tax free. The drawback? Someone they do not know will die. The couple's actions following the man's visit, as well as the consequences of their actions, constitute the meat of the story. The why's and the who's are mostly explained, though some questions are purposefully left for each viewer's imagination to tackle. The performance is satisfactory from all leads, except Cameron Diaz. She overacts in every scene, to the point of becoming a distraction. Her casting played a major part in my downgrading the rating to 3.5 stars.If you feel you can ignore Diaz and focus on every word of dialogue, you will be rewarded with some original thinking and a somewhat creepy film.

They agonize over the decision and then the consequences of what they finally decide start to become apparent as the film unfolds. The original premise is great and you start to wonder what you would do in the same situation; you also start to question certain events as the film progresses and this quickly becomes quite a tense sci-fi thriller. The acting is ok (although a little wooden at times) from most of the actors, but Frank Langella is particularly good and note worthy. The story is engrossing and fairly original and whilst this ends without any real conclusion (which detracts from the film slightly), it does manage to keep you entertained throughout.

That overall soft look (white glow throughout) detracted from there being any good line definition and there are only a few scenes of color in the entire film. The facial disfigurement of Langella's character is pixelated in half of the scenes, while the city scapes ended up looking like those race car model tracks from the 70s. Those water tower effects looked hokey, but the following scene of the water delivery in the bed sounded good. Which leads into the sound aspects. The DTS gave some nice references (the rocket test, the ever-imposing score) but the mix made Langella's voice muddled/having bad echoes in every wind-tunnel scene. The supplements include one must see:* Richard Matheson, In His Own Words, 6 minutes. Better than the entire film and other supplements - he truly demonstrates a writer's humility and grace, a great interview.* Visual FX revealed, all three sets were ""triumphs"" for this company, but I thought they all looked poor to average, especially the city sets/mattes.* Music Video Prequels. Wow, cannot stress enough what a complete waste of time these were. Clips from the movie to the score and they are called prequels?.* The Box, less then 15 minutes. Gave some interesting insight and a few touching moments about how Kelly's personal life and family are the inspirations behind this film. Worth the watch for fans of his.* Commentary by Kelly.Admittedly, I almost want to give this a higher rating because I love the greater-than-humanity conspiracy arc, but it felt so misplaced, disorganized and unexplained here that it detracts from being a great film. That and the effects were so distracting and the writing/editing poor (they forgot to add snow in the last scenes so it magically became fall from there being a thick snow layer that evening), coupled with a few forgettable supplements and an average BD, I had to go with three stars only.No region coding listed, English. Spanish and French languages with subs in same. I almost wanted to watch it in a dubbed language with Cameron's accent changing/disappearing so many times in the film, it was a relief when she spoke normally.",3,What could have been a great Blu...,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,2782,"['Instead', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'frustrating', 'mess', 'love', 'original', 'story', 'understood', 'going', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'serious', 'time', 'extensions', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'X-Files', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'created', 'one', 'favorite', 'themes', 'watch', 'whole', 'conspiracy', 'arc', 'even', 'Kelly', 'tried', 'create', 'own', 'twist', 'arc', 'felt', 'more', 'frustration', 'reward', 'end.Plot', 'descriptions', 'film', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'disservice', 'BD', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'difficult', 'not', 'cover', 'major', 'aspects', 'story', 'effects', 'are', 'given', 'own', 'three', 'part', 'supplement', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'Blu', 'overall', 'soft', 'look', 'white', 'glow', 'detracted', 'there', 'being', 'good', 'line', 'definition', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'color', 'entire', 'film', 'facial', 'disfigurement', 'Langella', 'character', 'pixelated', 'half', 'scenes', 'city', 'scapes', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'race', 'car', 'model', 'tracks', '70s', 'water', 'tower', 'effects', 'looked', 'hokey', 'following', 'scene', 'water', 'delivery', 'bed', 'sounded', 'good', 'Which', 'sound', 'DTS', 'gave', 'nice', 'references', 'rocket', 'test', 'ever-imposing', 'score', 'mix', 'made', 'Langella', 'voice', 'muddled/having', 'bad', 'echoes', 'wind-tunnel', 'scene', 'supplements', 'include', 'one', 'must', 'see', '*', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Own', 'Words', '6', 'minutes', 'Better', 'entire', 'film', 'other', 'supplements', 'truly', 'writer', 'humility', 'grace', 'great', 'interview', '*', 'Visual', 'FX', 'revealed', 'three', 'sets', 'were', 'triumphs', 'company', 'thought', 'looked', 'poor', 'average', 'especially', 'city', '*', 'Music', 'Video', 'Prequels', 'Wow', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'what', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'were', 'Clips', 'movie', 'score', 'are', 'called', 'prequels', '*', 'Box', 'less', 'then', '15', 'minutes', 'Gave', 'interesting', 'insight', 'few', 'touching', 'moments', 'how', 'Kelly', 'personal', 'life', 'family', 'are', 'inspirations', 'film', 'watch', 'fans', '*', 'Commentary', 'Kelly.Admittedly', 'almost', 'want', 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'love', 'greater-than-humanity', 'conspiracy', 'arc', 'felt', 'so', 'misplaced', 'disorganized', 'unexplained', 'here', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'effects', 'were', 'so', 'distracting', 'writing/editing', 'poor', 'forgot', 'add', 'snow', 'last', 'scenes', 'magically', 'became', 'fall', 'being', 'thick', 'snow', 'layer', 'evening', 'coupled', 'few', 'forgettable', 'supplements', 'average', 'BD', 'had', 'go', 'three', 'stars', 'only.No', 'region', 'coding', 'listed', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'languages', 'subs', 'same', 'almost', 'wanted', 'watch', 'dubbed', 'language', 'Cameron', 'accent', 'changing/disappearing', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'was', 'relief', 'when', 'spoke', 'normally']","Box, The (DVD)"

Based on Richard Matheson's story, ""Button Button,"" the story starts with a philosophical question - For a million dollars, would you be willing to have the knowledge that your decision causes the death of another person whom you don't know.Norma and Arthur Lewis (played by Cameron Diaz and James Marsden) find a box on their doorstep.  When Arthur has left, a mysterious man (Frank Langella) appears and explains how the box works.  If Norma presses the button, she would recieve a million dollars, but someone she does not know would die because of it.  The one condition is that they cannot tell anybody or do any research regarding this matter.Regardless of whether they pressed the button or not, the couple soon realizes that they are being targeted because of other actions they take not related to pressing the button.  The viewer is then taken through a series of surreal logic and visions explaining the purpose of the box experiment.In the end, the couple must make another decision. And regardless of believable the circumstances are, this last situation is the product of all the events that took place up to that point.This movie took me on a wild ride where at times I didn't know where it was going or why.  The ending left some questions, but the ride did end, and there was no uncessary detours on the route.The acting itself was okay, and I guess that's what bring it down to three stars.

1242203,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B001UV4XWY,Steven Herring,"[1, 1]","This is a really strange movie from the opening shot. It is filled with strange scenes and characters. Like Cameron Diaz's disfigured foot. The whole movie just feels like it has a horror movie vibe while focusing on a drama type narrative. It is set in the 70's for some reason. Based on the plot it  would have made more sense to have it in the present time. There is a fair share of cheesy moments sprinkled throughout the movie. I don't really know why these scenes couldn't have been cut, because they really hurt the pacing of the movie. You know what else hurt the pacing? The two hour run time. It just seemed to drag on and on. At the end of the film when the plot is finally finished it does leave you with an intriguing question. Did they pass the test? I would have liked it if the overall plot of the box maker was finished. They sort of just leave you with the end of the test and not the end of the experiment. The acting in the movie is decent but always feels like the lines are cheesy and a little to much like they are in a 70's family comedy. Outside the dialogue of the main characters Mr Steward is creepy throughout the film, and adds most of the intrigue to the plot. As the credits roll you are left with some interesting ideas to mull over as you ask yourself what you would do in the given situation. Overall the movie is decent it just suffers from pacing and dialogue issues. The story as an overall arc is full of depth due to the length of the film even though some of the movie was clearly filler, it is an enjoyable ride as you try and guess what is going on.

1242205,A1536VSPC386SQ,B001UV4XWY,"The Hermit ""The Hermit""","[2, 6]","BEAUTIFUL AND DEADLYI love this film. For me as a viewer of this film , this movie has given Frank Langella god - like powers as an actor. Understandeably , that means bad news for big government and big bussiness who don't like people to have any ideas about the possibility of acquiering god - like powers as a result of encountering totally unforseeable events whom they have no control over. The film deals with three versions of Earth as they exist seperately and yet fully connected with each other in the year 1976. The film provides the ultimate counterargument against why people like to live in little boxes - and shatters any potential box the senses of it's viewer may have encountered in their lives , including and most specifically the box of conspiracy reality. Since I am very used to have my now circle - shaped world - views shattered by the minute , I welcomed this film so much that I watched it two times. The film portrays the possibility that humanity has evolved into a very powerful series of advanced species and civilizations which can possess such powers as the ability to move themselves between planets in the form of lightning. People think it's impossible but H.G.Wells encountered this concept of travel in the form of lightning when he wrote the War of the Worlds. In the War of the Worlds the Martians visited the Earth in the form of lightning as it was seen by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg tried unsuccessfully due to his political views to present his extraterrestrial visitors in a convincing manner but Morgan Freeman saved the day and for me , sort of led the team on that one. In the Box , Frank Langella proves ultimately his enormous success as an actor since his seriously , albeit totally unintentionally , shamanistic approax to interpreting Richard Nixon in the film Nixon /Frost. That was a movie I loved to watch as well. I have watched several other Frank Langella films but until this time I realized that he is seriously interested in playing in only really good movies. So this film will be a kind of Clockwork Orange like cult classic after about 10 years from now. It has already generated some highly politically incorrect ideas on travel in the minds of many. Imagine how easy it'd be once having perfected the technology and skills to create wormholes by the use of your mind and to use them to travel between dimensions in the form of lightning. On the outside you appear as lightning but in front of you is a wormhole. Goodness knows how many visitors from elsewhere may have visited this planet in such a manner. Imagine how easy it'd be for them to possess someone really aware , such as quite terrifyingly , mr. Langella or myself , and use our bodies and ourselves as vehicles without our knowledge. I have a far more terrifying theory as to how such a communication could take place - for example , astrally just as Langella tries to portray somewhere in the middle of the film. 1976 has a particularly significant importance from a symbolic perspective for me for some reason. I have often used this year to express myself artistically to get more people to read my other internet apart from amazon.com views and pay some attention to my art in my country and occasionally to make fun out of new age thought and maoism.What if we could be struck not only by physical lightning such as that portrayed in this film but astral lightning? That'd be seriously politically incorrect for the one or two star reviewers of this film. But perhaps moderate for the three star reviewers. We five star reviewers love and honour and appreciate this movie , Langella for who he is , and Cameron Diaz for who she is , and the director , producers and other actors for who they are , without giving a damn about the consequences. We have no idea as to exactly why we love films like the Box , Solaris , etc. , we just do. Thus , we operate outside of the mainstream to the one and two star reviewers , learn from them , move about our bussiness numinously , and continue to strive toward greatness in the pursuit of our limitless potential. I love how the director of this movie and the Donnie Darko plays with water. I have never seen anybody do it as well as he does since Leonardo Da Vinci. Leonardo would have loved to watch his films. Interestingly like in Leonardo's works , water often has a somewhat apocalyptic message to tell in the film , and also very beautiful - beautiful and deadly. If you who are reading this view happen to be an nsa employee , do not try this at home - if you do , consider yourself warned!! That was of course a joke by the way. Thank you so much , Langella , Diaz and all for having brought me the opportunity to see this film. Without you , I would never have!! Hitchcock would have loved the Box. I wonder if there'll be a sequel in where the main character chooses to destroy the box and present it to Stewart in ruins. Stewart's gonna be soo mad.........or not since he likes mystery.",5,Bad news for fans of the mainstream,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,4975,"['BEAUTIFUL', 'DEADLYI', 'love', 'film', 'viewer', 'film',

1242206,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B001UV4XWY,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","The year is 1976. Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) is a teacher who loves Sarte and teaches ""No Exit"" in her classroom, something that is a flag for symbolism and oddball. Arthur (James Marsden) is a NASA scientist. When Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) appears at their door, their dream life becomes a Phantasm nightmare. He gives them a box with simple instructions: Push the button and someone you don't know dies and you get a million dollars. After the payoff, our couple gets cold feet suspecting they are being set up for the next kill when some stranger pushes the button next.The theme is set for the human race. This is what corporations do in third world countries where they exploit and sometimes kill workers in order to make money. Push the button, get a million dollars. The film turns weird after they push the button as it unleashes a sci-fi series of events that keeps you guessing.If you noticed they lived in house number ""7321"" which adds up to lucky 13, something that would be more significant if this was a horror film. This is based on a short story and only Diaz's character was really developed. I had the feeling scenes were cut or deleted.

1242207,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B001UV4XWY,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[1, 2]","As weird movies go, this movie is weird.  I don't know how to characterize it.  Horror?  Science fiction?  Thriller?  Psychodrama?  All of the above.The premise is straightforward:  A black box shows up at your door.  It has a button on top.  If you press the button, one million dollars will be delivered to you.  Also, someone you don't know will die.But that premise leaves so many questions unanswered: Any negative consequences of pressing the button?  Who or what created this button box?  Why did they choose me to get this delivery?  Who will die?There are so many ""What the...?"" moments and flashes in this film that is going to be hard to catalogue them in 30 minutes.  Like Memento or Inception (but not quite to that extent), this movie requires a second viewing.  Why is blood dripping from the noses of some characters, for example?  Late in the movie there is a pretty substantial reveal regarding the peculiar goings-on that dot the landscape of The Box.  But, even some questions are left partially unanswered as the film closes.  I liked it.Cameron Diaz is a big star.  How she got involved in a weird flick that is painfully obviously based upon a science fiction short story is odd.  And her co-star is a James Franco knock-off, so maybe the producers went for him but had to get a look-alike as his stock rose.  In any event, Diaz and Franco-lite's life is what I would imagine for yuppies in the 1970s in the Washington, D.C. area.  He works for the government, NASA.  I don't recall if she even works or if that is relevant.  They live in a comfortable neighborhood surrounded by other comfortable folks.  They have one son, and the family seems close.  All is well.  But there is still that nagging, pestering bug in their ear for more or better.  More career success.  Diaz has a foot disfigurement that is embarrassing.  Like everyone in their suburban enclave, a little more money would ease a lot of their burdens.  They press the button.And then it gets freaking weird.  The film unfurls itself in one of the most peculiar fashions.  There are some scene cuts that show mysterious happenings, but we don't know why.  These mysteries are not revealed until much later in the film.  (One that sticks out is a flash to a motel pool where a large group of people are walking into a blindingly lit pool. Huh???)  What this plot technique instills in the audience is a constant, wondering apprehension.  Good stuff.The score also ramps up the creepiness and doom, which was effective at making my brain gears turn.  There were no Jack-in-the-Box, pop-out horror scenes, but that only added to the intrigue and dread.  I felt myself waiting to be scared silly, or for some gratuitous and gruesome violence.  It never came.  You know something big, ominous, and weird is happening in the background.  But what?  Who is pulling the strings?  I wasn't blown away by the answer, but it was an entertaining puzzle.",2,"Mystery, wrapped in an enigma, stored in a box.",1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,2931,"['weird', 'movies', 'go', 'movie', 'weird', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'characterize', 'Horror', 'Science', 'fiction', 'Thriller', 'Psychodrama', 'above.The', 'premise', 'straightforward', 'black', 'box', 'up', 'door', 'button', 'top', 'press', 'button', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'will', 'be', 'delivered', 'Also', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'die.But', 'premise', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'negative', 'consequences', 'pressing', 'button', 'Who', 'what', 'created', 'button', 'box', 'Why', 'did', 'choose', 'get', 'delivery', 'Who', 'will', 'die', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'What', 'moments', 'flashes', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'catalogue', '30', 'minutes', 'Memento', 'Inception', 'not', 'quite', 'extent', 'movie', 'second', 'viewing', 'Why', 'blood', 'dripping', 'noses', 'characters', 'example', 'Late', 'movie', 'pretty', 'substantial', 'reveal', 'regarding', 'peculiar', 'goings-on', 'landscape', 'Box', 'even', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'partially', 'unanswered', 'film', 'liked', 'it.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'big', 'star', 'How', 'got', 'involved', 'weird', 'flick', 'painfully', 'obviously', 'based', 'science', 'fiction', 'short', 'story', 'odd', 'co-star', 'James', 'Franco', 'knock-off', 'maybe', 'producers', 'went', 'had', 'get', 'look-alike', 'stock', 'rose', 'event', 'Diaz', 'Franco-lite', 'life', 'what', 'would', 'imagine', 'yuppies', '1970s', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'area', 'government', 'NASA', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'even', 'relevant', 'live', 'comfortable', 'neighborhood', 'surrounded', 'other', 'comfortable', 'folks', 'have', 'one', 'son', 'family', 'close', 'well', 'still', 'nagging', 'pestering', 'bug', 'ear', 'more', 'better', 'More', 'career', 'success', 'Diaz', 'foot', 'disfigurement', 'embarrassing', 'everyone', 'suburban', 'enclave', 'little', 'more', 'money', 'would', 'ease', 'lot', 'burdens', 'press', 'button.And', 'then', 'freaking', 'weird', 'film', 'unfurls', 'one', 'most', 'peculiar', 'fashions', 'are', 'scene', 'cuts', 'show', 'mysterious', 'happenings', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'mysteries', 'are', 'not', 'revealed', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'One', 'out', 'flash', 'motel', 'pool', 'where', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'are', 'walking', 'blindingly', 'lit', 'pool', 'Huh', 'What', 'plot', 'technique', 'instills', 'audience', 'constant', 'wondering', 'apprehension', 'Good', 'stuff.The', 'score', 'also', 'up', 'creepiness', 'doom', 'was', 'effective', 'making', 'brain', 'gears', 'turn', 'were', 'Jack-in-the-Box', 'pop-out', 'horror', 'scenes', 'only', 'added', 'intrigue', 'dread', 'felt', 'waiting', 'be', 'scared', 'silly', 'gratuitous', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'never', 'came', 'know', 'something', 'big', 'ominous', 'weird', 'happening', 'background', 'what', 'Who', 'pulling', 'strings', 'was', ""n't"", 'blown', 'away', 'answer', 'was', 'entertaining', 'puzzle']","Box, The (DVD)"
1242208,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001UV4XWY,Tim Janson,"[8, 9]","The Box is based on a 1970 short story called ""Button Button"" written by horror icon Richard Matheson.  The story was adapted previously as an episode of the 1980's incarnation of the Twilight Zone.  Now, the problem with turning a short story into a feature film is that the story is going to have to be heavily padded, and in the case of The Box, heavily padded.  A horribly disfigured man named Arlington Steward (Langella) arrives one day at the suburban Virginia home of Arthur and Norma Lewis, having previously placed a mysterious box on the couple's doorstep.  Inside the box is a large red button locked under a glass dome.  Steward tells the couple if they push the button two things will happen.  First, they will be given one million dollars, tax free. Second, someone in the world they don't know will die.  This moral test is where the similarity between film and story end.In the original story, Norma pushes the button and a few days later her husband is killed by a train.  When she asks Steward why her husband died, he tells her that she never really knew her husband.  Short, direct, and to the point.  Unfortunately the film is anything but direct and to the point and Matheson's story is lost in an absurd haze of alien possession, dimensional gateways, and crackpot science.  Steward, we learn, is controlled by an alien intelligence that is referred to merely as ""those that control the lightning"".Norma becomes obsessed with the button, starting at it for hours while she and Arthur argue the moral issue that they will be playing God with someone else's life.  The rest of the film deals with the consequences of the couple's actions.Richard Kelly's screenplay is all over the map but not once does it land at a destination that involves any logic or coherency.  We get the fact that some alien intelligence is testing mankind with this game of ethical choices but Kelly, also the Director, doesn't back it up with anything tangible.  The only hints we get is the film being set in the 1970's at the time of the launch of the Viking Mars probes.Diaz is overly melodramatic although you have a fondness for the innate goodness of her character.  Langella is the best thing about the film.  He is equal parts sinister and sensitive, villain and hero and the film is at its best when he is onscreen.The simple lesson here is that a ten-page story does not a film make, at least not in unskilled hands.",2,A Good Matheson Story...ruined,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,2424,"['Box', 'based', '1970', 'short', 'story', 'called', 'Button', 'Button', 'written', 'horror', 'icon', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'previously', 'episode', '1980', 'incarnation', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Now', 'problem', 'turning', 'short', 'story', 'feature', 'film', 'story', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'heavily', 'padded', 'case', 'Box', 'heavily', 'padded', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'man', 'named', 'Arlington', 'Steward', 'Langella', 'one', 'day', 'suburban', 'Virginia', 'home', 'Arthur', 'Norma', 'Lewis', 'having', 'previously', 'placed', 'mysterious', 'box', 'couple', 'doorstep', 'box', 'large', 'red', 'button', 'locked', 'glass', 'dome', 'Steward', 'couple', 'push', 'button', 'two', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'First', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'tax', 'free', 'Second', 'someone', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'die', 'moral', 'test', 'where', 'similarity', 'film', 'story', 'end.In', 'original', 'story', 'Norma', 'button', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'husband', 'killed', 'train', 'When', 'Steward', 'why', 'husband', 'died', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'husband', 'Short', 'direct', 'point', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'anything', 'direct', 'point', 'Matheson', 'story', 'lost', 'absurd', 'haze', 'alien', 'possession', 'dimensional', 'gateways', 'crackpot', 'science', 'Steward', 'learn', 'controlled', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'referred', 'merely', 'control', 'lightning', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'button', 'starting', 'hours', 'Arthur', 'argue', 'moral', 'issue', 'will', 'be', 'playing', 'God', 'someone', 'else', 'life', 'rest', 'film', 'deals', 'consequences', 'couple', 'actions.Richard', 'Kelly', 'screenplay', 'map', 'not', 'once', 'land', 'destination', 'logic', 'coherency', 'get', 'fact', 'alien', 'intelligence', 'testing', 'mankind', 'game', 'ethical', 'choices', 'Kelly', 'also', 'Director', ""n't"", 'back', 'up', 'anything', 'tangible', 'only', 'get', 'film', 'being', 'set', '1970', 'time', 'launch', 'Viking', 'Mars', 'probes.Diaz', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'have', 'fondness', 'innate', 'goodness', 'character', 'Langella', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'equal', 'parts', 'sinister', 'sensitive', 'villain', 'hero', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'onscreen.The', 'simple', 'lesson', 'here', 'ten-page', 'story', 'not', 'film', 'make', 'least', 'not', 'unskilled', 'hands']","Box, The (DVD)"

1242210,A1H9DQ50934W11,B001UV4XWY,Tom Fulery,"[27, 29]","THE BOX is a masterpiece of ethical and moral dilemma masquerading as an ominous sci-fi suspense thriller. It may seem obscure and incomprehensible, but it's essentially just a story about the Golden Rule: What we do to others we do to ourselves.The story is taken form an ironic little gem of a story by Richard Matheson (of TWILIGHT ZONE fame) called ""Button, Button."" The movie expands it into a Gordian Knot of obscure, seemingly unrelated events that inevitably, well... you'll see.The central theme is altruism, which is basically the practical application of the Golden Rule (you know, do unto others as you would have them do unto you). The basic equation is that if enough people choose selfishness, eventually no one will be left. Yet I'm amazed by all the diverse interpretations and reviews, especially since the substance of the story is clearly stated at one point as the ""altruism coefficient,"" that is, unless people learn to be altruistic they will either destroy each other or be destroyed by the mysterious extraterrestrials. A not uncommon sci-fi theme, but presented here as a brilliantly enigmatic and ominous fable that is never boring, but rather, perplexing and mesmerizing. It may have been more popular as a dark comedy, but then it would have lost much of its impact.Unfortunately however, when a story is presented as enigmatically as this, people tend to see what they want to see, like the reviewer who totally misinterpreted it as a ""scathing attack on altruism,"" quoting Ayn Rand's absurd, distorted definition of it. (Ayn Rand, the master of rationalization of the selfish and self-serving, nursed a lifelong disdain of altruism and empathy. Her books rationalize and justify selfishness, opportunism and exploitation, and still inspire those who exalt such traits.) But this movie is in fact a scathing indictment of selfishness.Self-sacrifice and selflessness have been the most powerful themes in all of literature and art, including the ultimate story of self-sacrifice, that of Christ (though you'd hardly guess it judging by today's Christians).Selfishness, on the other hand, is the primary characteristic of evil.The quote by John Paul Sartre near the end of the movie sums it up beautifully.",5,The altruism equation: Free or not free.,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,2234,"['BOX', 'masterpiece', 'ethical', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'masquerading', 'ominous', 'sci-fi', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'may', 'seem', 'obscure', 'incomprehensible', 'essentially', 'just', 'story', 'Golden', 'Rule', 'What', 'do', 'others', 'do', 'ourselves.The', 'story', 'taken', 'form', 'ironic', 'little', 'gem', 'story', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'fame', 'called', 'Button', 'Button', 'movie', 'Gordian', 'Knot', 'obscure', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'events', 'inevitably', 'well', ""'ll"", 'see.The', 'central', 'theme', 'altruism', 'basically', 'practical', 'application', 'Golden', 'Rule', 'know', 'do', 'unto', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'basic', 'equation', 'enough', 'people', 'choose', 'selfishness', 'eventually', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'left', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'diverse', 'interpretations', 'reviews', 'especially', 'substance', 'story', 'clearly', 'stated', 'one', 'point', 'altruism', 'coefficient', 'people', 'learn', 'be', 'altruistic', 'will', 'either', 'destroy', 'other', 'be', 'destroyed', 'mysterious', 'extraterrestrials', 'not', 'uncommon', 'sci-fi', 'theme', 'presented', 'here', 'brilliantly', 'enigmatic', 'ominous', 'fable', 'never', 'boring', 'rather', 'perplexing', 'mesmerizing', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'popular', 'dark', 'comedy', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'much', 'impact.Unfortunately', 'however', 'when', 'story', 'presented', 'as', 'enigmatically', 'people', 'tend', 'see', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'reviewer', 'who', 'totally', 'misinterpreted', 'scathing', 'attack', 'altruism', 'quoting', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'absurd', 'distorted', 'definition', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'master', 'rationalization', 'selfish', 'self-serving', 'nursed', 'lifelong', 'disdain', 'altruism', 'empathy', 'books', 'rationalize', 'justify', 'selfishness', 'opportunism', 'exploitation', 'still', 'inspire', 'who', 'exalt', 'such', 'traits', 'movie', 'fact', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'selfishness.Self-sacrifice', 'selflessness', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'powerful', 'themes', 'literature', 'art', 'including', 'ultimate', 'story', 'self-sacrifice', 'Christ', ""'d"", 'hardly', 'guess', 'judging', 'today', 'Christians', '.Selfishness', 'other', 'hand', 'primary', 'characteristic', 'evil.The', 'quote', 'John', 'Paul', 'Sartre', 'end', 'movie', 'sums', 'up', 'beautifully']","Box, The (DVD)"

Arlington says that if they press the button, they can get one million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. Well, it is a typical story you might have seen in one of old sci-fi TV shows. Actually, Richard Matheson's short story (""Button, Button"") has been adapted for a ""The Twilight Zone"" episode in 1986, directed by Peter Medak.The new adaptation by Richard Kelly (of the ""Donnie Darko"" fame) opens with an intriguing premise, but like many Richard Matheson adaptations (such as recent ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith), the 115-minute film suffers from overlength. Not only that; the filmmakers couldn't resist the temptation of cramming half-baked ideas into a lumbering story: nosebleeds, NASA, Arthur C Clarke, Jean Paul Sartre, and so on. Quite honestly, I don't know what the film is all about.While we are hoping that under the absurd and unconvincing appearance we can find deeper meanings, the film's muddled story with many unsolved sub-plots finally reaches its melodramatic conclusion, for which all these impossible characters and unlikely events are created.

Would you choose financial wealth from an unknown benefactor in exchange for taking the life of another person that you don't know? I thought that was a great plot concept. What an intruiging moral cunundrum to ask. It sounded to me like a Rod Serling Sci Fi take on ""An Indecent Proposal"". And for about 25 minutes of so, it was. Then for no apparent reason the plot suddenly took a sharp left turn. Then another left, a right, two more lefts, went up a hill and disappeared all together in the fog. By the end of the movie there are so many unanswered questions it made me sorry that I watched it. The acting was fine. The writting and story line is just all messed up after you get past the initial 25 minutes.

The Box has even more audacity, though it's also dumber, and though by its end the movie had tipped towards the latter for me, I still enjoyed the ride.  As in Darko, Kelly serves up a rich stew of atmospheric creepiness, martyrdom melodrama, lovingly recreated period detail from the recent past (there's no particular reason the story has to take place in Virginia in 1976, but that ends up being a cool place to hang out), some clunky imagery (the CGI water coffins here recall the blurry chest worms I thought looked dumb in D.D.---what is it with Kelly and translucence?), some absolutely stunning imagery (the wordless chase though the library is an immaculately eerie set piece), and a broadly sketched cosmological backstory that works best if you don't think about it too much.  But the most audacious move of all is the choice of source material.  The Box started life as a Richard Matheson short story that was later adapted into an episode for the mid-1980s Twilight Zone series that felt padded at 30 minutes.  And somehow Kelly manages to turn this wisp of a premise into a sprawling, overstuffed near-epic.Overall, it was worth it, but I'm not sure how much of my enjoyment came from the The Box itself and how much came from rooting for its director.  A wide-eyed loopiness suffuses everything Kelly does---he's like an insanely talentedMark Borchardt.

But, the catch was, once the button has been pushed, someone, somewhere, unknown to the couple, will die.Personally, this film has kept me involved and intrigued. I was quite fascinated with the enduring plot and a serious question as to what would one do: push the button to receive a million dollar and someone will die or don't push the button. The whole thing seems to be testing one's greed or self-interest in some way. What really got me involved into this film was the fact that it drives home the consequences of our choices in a bizarre plot.

1242218,A2YMFNXSPRVKEW,B001UV4XWY,Z. Fu,"[8, 11]","To understand the Box, one can either watch it again on DVD with subtitles on, or read my cliff notes below.  I try to summarize it without giving away much details, which you the reader probably already know if you are reading this.The moral choice, that Norma and Arthur face, has been the focus of much discussion and debate.  Although it drives the narrative, it is merely the movie's starting point.  The meat of the Box (also a sensible departure from Richard Matheson's short story) is the carefully raised possibility of aliens taking over major US government agencies (NSA, NASA, FBI and etc.) and conducting social experiment on humans to determine its viability as a species.  This is the larger context which the story takes place in.  It causes much confusion in the audience.  It is however integral to an appreciation of Richard Kelly's intriguing work.At the start of the film, US is close to finding evidence of life on Mars.  Arthur himself works on the space program.  The aliens (Martians?) sends one of its agents to inhabit the body of researcher Arlington Steward after lightning'd struck him.  Alien Steward conducts a social experiment, the purpose of which is to determine whether human individuals are capable of putting aside their personal desires to do the ""right"" things.  Logic follows that if they can, humans as a species have a chance for survival.  If not, humans may be selected for extermination (before they reach Mars?).  Aliens are able to co-opt local and central US government agencies.  They after all would not be able to openly conduct their businesses without them.  It is unclear whether agency heads are willing subjects or not.  Aliens have the technology to do it either way.  They can rewire human brains with a slight side effect of nose bleed.  It is helpful to be reminded of the much cited Arthur C Clark's third law ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""I would comment on the library scene where Arthur is asked to select ""salvation"" and ""damnation.""  It may seem a digression, as an earlier reviewer suggested.  It is not.  It provides the motivation for Arthur's final decision and more.  His belief in reuniting with Norma in afterlife allows him to perform his final act.  What is even more interesting is whether or not Arthur really saw afterlife or that he just thinks that he did.  Aliens have the ""water and light based"" technology to make subjects to see whatever aliens want them to see.  Aliens' ""employees"" are similar to the hypnotized acting with little self awareness.  It is very likely that aliens tricked Arthur into seeing life after death because they were preparing Arthur as a victim in the next round of test.  Similarly, Alien Steward suggests Sartre's Existentialism to Norma.  Both theology and philosophy are hollow ideologies to aliens.  They are merely two more tools for Alien Steward to manipulate the experiment subjects.The Box is not a straight thriller like the Eagle Eye (2008).  It is a cerebral experience that challenges our sense of reality, the like which can be found in quasi science fictions of Philip K Dick, Kurt Vonnegut and Thomas Pynchon.  It demands a second viewing with subtitles.

1242219,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001UV4XWY,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I really had no idea what to expect when my husband and I sat down to watch this last night. We had stayed away when the movie was playing in the theaters because of all the negative reviews, but finally decided to rent it. I have to say that despite some questionable and confusing plot twists and story arcs (and boy, are there plenty of those), I liked it. It's hard to define why this movie appealed to me - I'm not really a sci-fi fan and this movie definitely has sci-fi elements in it. I think it was the philosophical elements underlying the story that made me relate to the film. Based on a short story ""Button Button"" by Richard Matheson (who also wrote ""I Am Legend""), the movie itself veers away from the original plot (the short story was succint and quite straightforward).The story is set in Virginia in the late 70s (1979 to be exact). A suburban couple, Arthur and Norma Lewis seem to be leading an idyllic life with their adolescent son. Arthur (James Marsden) works for NASA and Norma (Cameron Diaz) teaches at a private school. All is not well though as Norma receives news that the school will no longer provide a tuition discount for faculty member's children, and Arthur is given the devastating news that his application to be trained as an astronaut was rejected. In the midst of all these disappointments, the couple receive a mysterious package containing a strange box. The next day, a horribly disfigured man, Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) arrives on their doorstep and informs Norma that pushing the button will cause someone the couple does not know to die, but it will also ensure their financial security with a million dollar pay-off. The couple is given 24 hours to decide. Well, Norma's decision sets off a series of events that are as compelling to watch as they are strange and befuddling.I say befuddling because there are so many themes explored here - mind control, the possibility of a highly intelligent alien life form, ethical choices, the concepts of free will, damnation, salvation, and the afterlife, gateways to a different dimension, etc. It's a story that one needs to follow from the beginning as the movie itself is heavy in symbolism and dialogue - and the viewer who follows it all the way through just might be rewarded with some insights. That being said, I ultimately gave this movie 3 stars because the story could have been told without all these cluttering plot devices. It just serves to confuse the viewer, without it being necessary. Cameron Diaz's portrayal of Norma goes over the top (I think Charlize Theron would have done a better job in the role), Marsden is okay, the kid who plays their son is wooden in his acting, and Langella's role was well-played (in fact, his role could have done with a bit more in-depth exploration).It is seldom easy to adapt a short story into a full-length feature, and by using his own poetic license in telling this story, I fear the director made the story overly melodramatic and confusing, detracting from the true message of the movie (and depending on the way you view it, there may be a couple of those in there!).",3,Intriguing noirish sci-fi thriller,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,3127,"['really', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'husband', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'last', 'night', 'had', 'stayed', 'away', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'theaters', 'negative', 'reviews', 'finally', 'decided', 'rent', 'have', 'say', 'questionable', 'confusing', 'plot', 'twists', 'story', 'arcs', 'boy', 'are', 'there', 'plenty', 'liked', 'hard', 'define', 'why', 'movie', 'appealed', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'movie', 'definitely', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'think', 'was', 'philosophical', 'elements', 'underlying', 'story', 'made', 'relate', 'film', 'Based', 'short', 'story', 'Button', 'Button', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Am', 'Legend', 'movie', 'away', 'original', 'plot', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'succint', 'quite', 'straightforward', '.The', 'story', 'set', 'Virginia', 'late', '70s', '1979', 'be', 'exact', 'suburban', 'couple', 'Arthur', 'Norma', 'Lewis', 'seem', 'be', 'leading', 'idyllic', 'life', 'adolescent', 'son', 'Arthur', 'James', 'Marsden', 'NASA', 'Norma', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'private', 'school', 'not', 'well', 'Norma', 'news', 'school', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'provide', 'tuition', 'discount', 'faculty', 'member', 'children', 'Arthur', 'given', 'devastating', 'news', 'application', 'be', 'trained', 'astronaut', 'was', 'rejected', 'midst', 'disappointments', 'couple', 'receive', 'mysterious', 'package', 'containing', 'strange', 'box', 'next', 'day', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'man', 'Arlington', 'Steward', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'doorstep', 'informs', 'Norma', 'pushing', 'button', 'will', 'cause', 'someone', 'couple', 'not', 'know', 'die', 'will', 'also', 'ensure', 'financial', 'security', 'million', 'dollar', 'pay-off', 'couple', 'given', '24', 'hours', 'decide', 'Well', 'Norma', 'decision', 'off', 'series', 'events', 'are', 'compelling', 'watch', 'are', 'strange', 'befuddling.I', 'say', 'befuddling', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'themes', 'explored', 'here', 'mind', 'control', 'possibility', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'ethical', 'choices', 'concepts', 'free', 'will', 'damnation', 'salvation', 'afterlife', 'different', 'dimension', 'etc', 'story', 'one', 'follow', 'beginning', 'movie', 'heavy', 'symbolism', 'dialogue', 'viewer', 'who', 'way', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'rewarded', 'insights', 'being', 'said', 'ultimately', 'gave', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'cluttering', 'plot', 'devices', 'just', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'being', 'necessary', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'portrayal', 'Norma', 'top', 'think', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'role', 'Marsden', 'okay', 'kid', 'who', 'son', 'wooden', 'acting', 'Langella', 'role', 'was', 'well-played', 'fact', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'more', 'in-depth', 'exploration', '.It', 'seldom', 'easy', 'adapt', 'short', 'story', 'full-length', 'feature', 'using', 'own', 'poetic', 'license', 'telling', 'story', 'fear', 'director', 'made', 'story', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'confusing', 'detracting', 'true', 'message', 'movie', 'depending', 'way', 'view', 'may', 'be', 'couple', 'there']","Box, The (DVD)"
