849934,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0002XVRWK,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 0]","Detective Chief Inspector Ross Tanner of the Special Murder Unit has a problem. He's not just an intense, competitive copper who focuses intently on solving whatever crime he and his team are assigned; his ex not only divorced him because of this intensity; he not only has difficulty finding time for his young son because of his intensity...now he finds out he's probably going blind.Tanner (Clive Owen) is diagnosed with a rare virus that goes after the cornea. His doctor tells him that's why he's been having trouble at times seeing clearly, having flashes of disorienting light and sometimes having hallucinations. His doctor also tells him it's quite likely to get worse. There's a good chance he'll wind up without sight and there's some chance his condition will improve. For this ultra-committed cop, the idea of going blind and not being able to do his job is a horrible prospect. So he refuses to say anything about it to his superiors or his team. He occasionally bumps into things and gets dizzy, but Tanner is determined to crack his latest case and stay on the job. Fortunately, perhaps, one member of his team discovers what's going on. Detective Inspector Catherine Tully makes a deal with Tanner. She'll be his eyes when he needs her and will help cover his situation. She wants a past screw-up on her record cleared and his support in dealing with the male chauvinists on the team. Tanner, with no other real option, agrees.So now Tanner, with Tully close by, takes on the case of a 19-year-old young man who has been brutally beaten to death. There are plenty of suspects and suspicious characters, and they all are members of or close to the dead man's family. Let's see...what was going on with the dead man's former nanny, a relatively young woman who may have seduced the lad; or his mother, now remarried with a two-year-old daughter, who seems remarkably self-contained; or his step-father, a cool and busy businessman who had little time for him; or, most interestingly, his step-fathers identical twin brother. The two may look alike but that's the only similarity...that, and a fondness for the same woman. There are fair clues, inferences, psychological back-stories, jealousy, envy and hate. In other words, the mystery's not bad. And Tanner, with Catherine's help and a lot of legwork from his team, finally cracks the case. He has had to deal with debilitating light shows in his eyes, but those hallucinations sometimes helped out. You see, as his eyes deteriorate, it may be that his other senses, even that sixth one, are becoming more fine-tuned. Is this a television mystery or what?Second Sight runs almost three hours. It was followed the next year by three new cases, each one running about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Hide and Seek takes us to the death of a famous violinist. The murderer turns out to be someone we least suspect, but the story plays fair with us. Parasomnia deals with anguish and sleepwalking. Kingdom of the Blind places Tanner in the middle of a war between neo-Nazis and black young men...and then his son disappears. While by now Catherine has left the unit (and Tanner's bed), another member of the team is helping.To my mind all the mysteries in Second Sight are over-written and at times overly dramatic. There's the dreaded CSI syndrome at work: Anguished heroes, overly dramatic close-ups of suspects being interrogated; so much back-story trailing behind that a shovel and pail are needed. The writers appear to think they are exploring the human condition, or some such, instead of writing tight-paced, clever mysteries for television. Tanner's situation is set up for us in the first program. Even if we haven't seen this program, his situation doesn't need the seemingly endless camera pyrotechnics to let us know Tanner is having an attack. We sure don't need the repeated narrative of Tanner's angst and anguishes. The writers don't trust the audience because they don't think we'll get it the second, third and fourth time around.More than balancing this, I think, are two things. First, discard all the anguish and neo-CSI nonsense and there remains good, interesting mysteries with solid, professional acting. I particularly liked the first. It was clever, unexpected and psychologically sick. Stuart Wilson who played the twins was a sight to see.The second and most important factor is Clive Owen. The man is a compelling actor. He underplays effortlessly and he has the skill and presence to dominate the program. He's a pleasure to watch. For those who also like Owen, I recommend two films he made with Mike Hodges,CroupierandI'll Sleep When I'm Dead. If Owen doesn't go Hollywood, and so far there's no sign that he is, he'll not only be a star but also remain an unusually fine actor.The DVD transfers are just fine and there are several extras.",4,"Despite the angst and anguish, Clive Owen and some good mysteries make Second Sight work",1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,4828,"['Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Ross', 'Tanner',

849935,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B0002XVRWK,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[40, 41]","This is a remarkable series, richly dramatic and with one of those ""twists"" that lends an added element to each of the stories.  Clive Owen's is powerful character as Ross Tanner, a hard drinking, hard boiled detective with a knack for solving some of the most difficult crimes.  Unfortunately, he's cursed with a rare disorder causing him to go permanently blind.  We watch Tanner's painful struggle as he attempts to keep this news to himself, relying ever higher on his other senses compensating for his loss of vision.  He keeps everyone at bay, including his ex-wife and partners.  Eventually, of course, those closest to him are onto the situation but everyone plays along as best they can - at least for as long as they can.Owen's is one of those ""must see"" performances and he makes Tanner a character both irascible and likeable - not an easy accomplishment.The mysteries of the crimes are fairly standard British ""Mystery"" which means they are always a notch or two above American crime dramas.

849936,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B0002XVRWK,Hikari,"[0, 0]","I just rewatched this series again after several years and am dismayed to find it unavailable except through private sellers.  Since this is the 10th anniversary of the first airing of Set 1, perhaps they are planning a rerelease edition.  Any way you can get your hands on a copy of this BBC series first aired in America on PBS Mystery! you won't regret it.  At the time, Owen was well-known in his native Britain from other TV projects, but it would be a few more years before he hit the consciousness of American film viewers with roles in ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""King Arthur"".  Owen looks like a young pup here, his frame lankier and his face not yet filled out to its current proportions.  His DCI Ross Tanner is impulsive, rough around the edges and a bit of a prick, both to the underlings on his squad and to his ex-wife.  He's an erratic father to his 9-year-old son Sam, who idolizes him.  In fact, when we first meet Tanner, he's cancelling a scheduled visit with his boy so he can stay at the pub and hit on the barmaid.  He's got the infuriating habit of hanging up on people and refusing to explain where he's going and what he's thinking.  He smokes and drinks and cats around way too much, all in the best noir detective tradition.  While his interpersonal skills may be lacking, Tanner is a brilliant copper who gets results, so his egotistical management style is tolerated in more or less good humor by his subordinates and his bosses.  Tanner is a high-flyer . . . until one morning when he wakes up and discovers that he's losing his eyesight.  In the midst of trying to run an investigation into the murder of a high-profile businessman's son, and manage a new colleague (Claire Skinner), who's as ambitious for career advancement as she is attracted to her new boss, Tanner has to slip away to see doctors without drawing attention to his 'problem'.  How long he will be able to cover his increasing disability and still do his job becomes the focus of the rest of the series.  The first set, a two-part episode featuring a tour-de-force performance by one of the guest actors in a dual role, is compelling and sets a high bar for the rest of the series.  Set 2 is comprised of three two-part episodes, none of which are as strong as the first case, particularly after Skinner departs the series halfway into the first episode.  But the pleasure here is in watching Owen and the rest of the squad ply their craft.  Even when you know the outcome of all these cases, the acting and production design remain top-drawer and a pleasure to watch.  All of the actors in the ensemble cast deserve kudos for their creation of a realistic working murder squad.Owen's trademark self-containment as an actor is is evidence here, and one muses that he would have been a smashing Bond, albeit one with completely different physicality than Daniel Craig.  Sometimes Owen's facial resemblance to a young Sean Connery is unmistakable.  What Owen and Craig share as actors is a cool detachment and complete self-possession that make them the masters of their cinematic universe.  Owen has made some interesting choices since this project, some artistically successful (Closer; Children of Men; Duplicity), some not (Derailed; The International).  Seems that he's trying to find a way to navigate being ""Hollywood"" without completely selling out and finding the path not so smooth.  But he seems completely at home as DCI Ross Tanner, and makes us sorry that the series was so short-lived.  For Owen fans, this is a don't miss, and points to the kind of quality work he is capable of, when he has a project to match his talents.",4,The Artist as a Young Man,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,3637,"['just', 'rewatched', 'series', 'again', 'several', 'years', 'am', 'dismayed', 'find', 'unavailable', 'private', 'sellers', '10th', 'anniversary', 'first', 'airing', 'Set', '1', 'perhaps', 'are', 'planning', 'rerelease', 'edition', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'BBC', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'America', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'time', 'Owen', 'was', 'well-known', 'native', 'Britain', 'other', 'TV', 'projects', 'would', 'be', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'hit', 'consciousness', 'American', 'film', 'viewers', 'roles', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Owen', 'young', 'pup', 'here', 'frame', 'lankier', 'face', 'not', 'yet', 'filled', 'out', 'current', 'proportions', 'DCI', 'Ross', 'Tanner', 'impulsive', 'rough', 'edges', 'bit', 'prick', 'underlings', 'squad', 'ex-wife', 'erratic', 'father', '9-year-old', 'son', 'Sam', 'who', 'fact', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'Tanner', 'cancelling', 'scheduled', 'visit', 'boy', 'can', 'stay', 'pub', 'hit', 'barmaid', 'got', 'infuriating', 'habit', 'hanging', 'up', 'people', 'refusing', 'explain', 'where', 'going', 'what', 'thinking', 'drinks', 'cats', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'best', 'noir', 'detective', 'tradition', 'interpersonal', 'skills', 'may', 'be', 'lacking', 'Tanner', 'brilliant', 'copper', 'who', 'results', 'egotistical', 'management', 'style', 'tolerated', 'more', 'less', 'good', 'humor', 'subordinates', 'bosses', 'Tanner', 'high-flyer', 'one', 'morning', 'when', 'up', 'discovers', 'losing', 'eyesight', 'midst', 'trying', 'run', 'investigation', 'murder', 'high-profile', 'businessman', 'son', 'manage', 'new', 'colleague', 'Claire', 'Skinner', 'who', 'as', 'ambitious', 'career', 'advancement', 'attracted', 'new', 'boss', 'Tanner', 'slip', 'away', 'see', 'doctors', 'drawing', 'attention', ""'problem"", 'How', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'cover', 'increasing', 'disability', 'still', 'do', 'job', 'focus', 'rest', 'series', 'first', 'set', 'two-part', 'episode', 'featuring', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'one', 'guest', 'actors', 'dual', 'role', 'compelling', 'high', 'bar', 'rest', 'series', 'Set', '2', 'comprised', 'three', 'two-part', 'episodes', 'none', 'are', 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'case', 'particularly', 'Skinner', 'series', 'halfway', 'first', 'episode', 'pleasure', 'here', 'watching', 'Owen', 'rest', 'squad', 'ply', 'craft', 'Even', 'when', 'know', 'outcome', 'cases', 'acting', 'production', 'design', 'remain', 'top-drawer', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'actors', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'creation', 'realistic', 'working', 'murder', 'squad.Owen', 'trademark', 'self-containment', 'actor', 'evidence', 'here', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'smashing', 'Bond', 'one', 'completely', 'different', 'physicality', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Sometimes', 'Owen', 'facial', 'resemblance', 'young', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'unmistakable', 'What', 'Owen', 'Craig', 'share', 'actors', 'cool', 'detachment', 'complete', 'self-possession', 'make', 'masters', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'Owen', 'made', 'interesting', 'choices', 'project', 'artistically', 'successful', 'Closer', 'Children', 'Men', 'Duplicity', 'not', 'Derailed', 'International', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'navigate', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'completely', 'selling', 'out', 'finding', 'path', 'not', 'so', 'smooth', 'completely', 'home', 'DCI', 'Ross', 'Tanner', 'sorry', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'short-lived', 'Owen', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'points', 'kind', 'quality', 'work', 'capable', 'when', 'project', 'match', 'talents']",N/A

849940,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B0002XVRWK,Shopper,"[0, 0]","I reviewed this series two years ago, under a different nickname. However, after completing a Second Sight ""marathon"" last weekend, I felt compelled to share my thoughts once again with fellow Second Sight enthusiasts. The series has aged SO WELL, viewing it remains a joy. It proves just how much the American cinema has underutilized the great acting talent of Mr Owen's... Here is my original review, as true today, as it was two years ago (though Bean's latest Sharpe episode was not so good, I'm affraid):""Why is it that British TV can be sooo grand at times? I rushed out to buy Second Sight after catching a glimps of the series on a public TV chanel. What is right about it? Everything: original plot, charismatic lead (I am not a fan of Clive Owen's, EXCEPT in this performance), well chosen supporting cast, quality production. You yearn for another installment of the series, though with Clive Owen gaining popularity in the US, that does not seem likely (can he take a lesson from Sean Bean, who did not forget his roots, and recently returned, for a brief moment, to the TV series ""Sharpe"" that had ""made him""?). There is nothing on American TV that compares well to the sofistication of this product.

In some of his movies he seems a little too stiff, however, in this series he is warm and believable.  This is the story of a detective on the fast track who is losing his sight.  Reading the synopsis you may think that ""Second Sight"" is referring to being able to see into the future/past; however that is not the case.  He is losing his sight due to a viral infection that is uncurable.  He is unable to hide this condition from his most able coworkers (they are detectives after all), and has to lean on a few of them which is something he hates to do.  This series would have been better has the intro been deleted off of it, but the show was very good and the last show of the series had a wonderful and satisfying ending.",4,Clive Owen is wonderful,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,800,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'acted', 'series', 'movies', 'little', 'too', 'stiff', 'however', 'series', 'warm', 'believable', 'story', 'detective', 'fast', 'track', 'who', 'losing', 'sight', 'Reading', 'synopsis', 'may', 'think', 'Second', 'Sight', 'referring', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'future/past', 'however', 'not', 'case', 'losing', 'sight', 'due', 'viral', 'infection', 'uncurable', 'unable', 'hide', 'condition', 'most', 'able', 'coworkers', 'are', 'detectives', 'lean', 'few', 'something', 'do', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'intro', 'been', 'deleted', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'last', 'show', 'series', 'had', 'wonderful', 'satisfying', 'ending']",N/A
