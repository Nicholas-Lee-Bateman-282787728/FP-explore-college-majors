But your college English professor doesn't know what movies you watch. And don't trust it for information about the book: I read what I had to of it back in the early 1970s.It is 1939, and a group of Spanish resistance fighters are hiding up in the hills, sabotaging what they can of the Fascist efforts. They call them republicans and nationalists, by the way. That's Nationalist as in National Socialist Party: Nazi in German, but Fascist in Spanish.Anyway, this band of republicans, gypsies, bandits and soldiers of fortune are joined by a rescued 19-year-old daughter of the mayor of a town (Bergman). She was abused by the Fascists after being witness to her parents' execution. Her hair is short because it's growing back from having been shaved off.They are also joined by an American demolition expert (Gary Cooper) who is under orders to blow up a critically important bridge. Without giving anything away, the in-fighting within the group is a good part of the movie, but they nevertheless manage to blow up the bridge.Of course, Cooper and Bergman fall in love.

Robert Jordan (Gary Cooper) came to Spain o fight for ""The Republic"" (a nice way to say for the commies) and against nationalists. He also had a dislike for Germans and Italians. His assignment was to go behind the nationalist lines and blow up a bridge at a strategic moment. There this stoic hero meets a peasant girl (a much too young for Gary, Ingrid Bergman) with a bad haircut and that barely escaped a train ride. They naturally fall in love which complicates things. Will this jeopardize the mission? Do we care?Along with this we have the classic mixture of characters that you cannot tell if they are the good guys or the bad guys. The two that stand out besides the hero and his girl are Katina Paxinou (sort of a female Antony Quinn) as the doyenne, and Akim Tamiroff as the once good guerilla who may be bad or just self-centered. Who they were and how the acted was quite a predicable formula.The story is an adoption from the Ernest Hemingway novel. Of course they could not put everything in the story and took a few liberties. We also miss the dialog that people read Hemmingway for.The initial credits are in some annoying script (Parchment) make it hard to read at a glance.The Fountainhead",3,"""Any Man's death diminishes me""",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,1323,"['am', 'involved', 'mankind', 'therefore', 'send', 'knowfor', 'who', 'bell', 'tolls.It', 'tolls', 'thee', 'Spain', '1937', 'Robert', 'Jordan', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'came', 'Spain', 'o', 'fight', 'Republic', 'nice', 'way', 'say', 'commies', 'nationalists', 'also', 'had', 'dislike', 'Germans', 'Italians', 'assignment', 'was', 'go', 'nationalist', 'lines', 'blow', 'up', 'bridge', 'strategic', 'moment', 'stoic', 'hero', 'peasant', 'girl', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'Gary', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'bad', 'haircut', 'barely', 'escaped', 'train', 'ride', 'naturally', 'fall', 'love', 'things', 'Will', 'jeopardize', 'mission', 'Do', 'care', 'have', 'classic', 'mixture', 'characters', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'two', 'stand', 'out', 'hero', 'girl', 'are', 'Katina', 'Paxinou', 'sort', 'female', 'Antony', 'Quinn', 'doyenne', 'Akim', 'Tamiroff', 'once', 'good', 'guerilla', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'bad', 'just', 'self-centered', 'Who', 'were', 'how', 'acted', 'was', 'quite', 'predicable', 'formula.The', 'story', 'adoption', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'novel', 'course', 'could', 'not', 'put', 'everything', 'story', 'took', 'few', 'liberties', 'also', 'miss', 'dialog', 'people', 'read', 'Hemmingway', 'for.The', 'initial', 'credits', 'are', 'annoying', 'script', 'Parchment', 'make', 'hard', 'read', 'glance.The', 'Fountainhead']",N/A
62044,A48THA5X4OUAB,0783229488,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[60, 65]","Hemingway's acknowledged masterpiece about Spanish Civil War guerillas was censored both in print and in film.  In print, the four letter words were cut and stilted pseudo-Spanish substituted.  That defect of course remains in this pretty much faithful transmission of the text; it is what gives it a funny archaic sound most do not understand.  Also, 2 key scenes were cut from the cinema release, to make the story less ""brutal"" and to emphasize the romance.  These episodes were  Pilar's telling of the execution of the fascists in her village, and El Sordo's final stand.  Thankfully, this version restores both magnificent scenes, making a much tougher, grittier film that is worthy of Hemingway's realism.  One could only rate the prior version 3 stars, at best.  This however is a first rate American film now being seen for the first time, 60 years later.The plot is very simple.  An American joins the anti-Franco guerillas in the mountains to help them blow a key bridge.  The guerillas suspect him and have their own internal problems.  The Yank falls in love with a girl who has been brutalized by the fascists.  With pluck he sticks to his mission until the film stops.The romance was tough going in the book, rather euphemistically treated.  You could not deal with that realistically at the time, either; Hemingway's story pushed the limits of its time.  Cooper and Bergman made the coupling palatable for an American audience then, and reviews here still attest that it works now.  Fine; I visualize it much more differently but am confident that EH's idea still would not sell, albeit for different reasons.  In any event the romance provides a plot engine to take one through part of a key historical event of the 20th century.  Hemingway got over there as a partisan of the Communist opposition, but the novel was balanced enough to infuriate many prominent American reds in the media of his day.People should read the book, of course.  This film is however, a sincere adaptation and faithful to the spirit of its day.  Ultimately, Cooper's signature performance nails just the right tone for this presentation of what critics of the day called ""grace under pressure.""",4,A Highly Improved Version,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,2187,"['Hemingway', 'acknowledged', 'masterpiece', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'guerillas', 'was', 'censored', 'print', 'film', 'print', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'were', 'cut', 'stilted', 'pseudo-Spanish', 'substituted', 'defect', 'course', 'pretty', 'much', 'faithful', 'transmission', 'text', 'what', 'funny', 'archaic', 'sound', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Also', '2', 'key', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'cinema', 'release', 'make', 'story', 'brutal', 'emphasize', 'romance', 'episodes', 'were', 'Pilar', 'telling', 'execution', 'fascists', 'village', 'El', 'Sordo', 'final', 'stand', 'Thankfully', 'version', 'magnificent', 'scenes', 'making', 'much', 'tougher', 'grittier', 'film', 'worthy', 'Hemingway', 'realism', 'One', 'could', 'only', 'rate', 'prior', 'version', '3', 'stars', 'best', 'however', 'first', 'rate', 'American', 'film', 'now', 'being', 'seen', 'first', 'time', '60', 'years', 'later.The', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'American', 'anti-Franco', 'guerillas', 'mountains', 'help', 'blow', 'key', 'bridge', 'guerillas', 'suspect', 'have', 'own', 'internal', 'problems', 'Yank', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'brutalized', 'fascists', 'pluck', 'mission', 'film', 'stops.The', 'romance', 'was', 'tough', 'going', 'book', 'rather', 'euphemistically', 'treated', 'could', 'not', 'deal', 'realistically', 'time', 'either', 'Hemingway', 'story', 'pushed', 'limits', 'time', 'Cooper', 'Bergman', 'made', 'coupling', 'palatable', 'American', 'audience', 'then', 'reviews', 'here', 'still', 'attest', 'now', 'Fine', 'visualize', 'much', 'more', 'differently', 'am', 'confident', 'EH', 'idea', 'still', 'would', 'not', 'sell', 'albeit', 'different', 'reasons', 'event', 'romance', 'plot', 'engine', 'take', 'one', 'part', 'key', 'historical', 'event', '20th', 'century', 'Hemingway', 'got', 'over', 'there', 'partisan', 'Communist', 'opposition', 'novel', 'was', 'balanced', 'enough', 'infuriate', 'many', 'prominent', 'American', 'reds', 'media', 'day.People', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'course', 'film', 'however', 'sincere', 'adaptation', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'day', 'Ultimately', 'Cooper', 'signature', 'performance', 'nails', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'presentation', 'what', 'critics', 'day', 'called', 'grace', 'pressure']",N/A

Bergman, with her blonde hair, blue eyes, and immaculate makeup job, doesn't exactly fill the role of the Spanish cave-dwelling, recently [attacked] Maria.  The only annoyance with Cooper came when, after the horse falls on him and breaks his leg, he tells Maria to go on without him while exhibiting no semblance of pain whatsoever.

DVD extras are adequate, but sparce by modern movie standards.All the principles did give fine performances.  While Katina Paxinou gives a fine, Oscar winning performance, I believe Akim Tamiroff as the undependable and annoying Pablo is the finest in the cast.  But Pilar is a much more likable character.Discussion of the movie: Cooper and Bergman are fine, independent of each other.  But the romantic attraction did not seem believable to me, especially how quickly Bergman's character was smitten by Cooper's.  Cooper looked, well, middle aged (he's about 42 here), when younger men were available (a rivalry might have added something here).  Fortunately, while young, she doesn't look 19 (her character's age, she's about 28).  Remember, her character is falling for Robert Jordan, not Gary Cooper, and any attraction built up in the book is not added in this adaptation.  There was absolutely no suspense in what was going to happen between these two.  For me, the romance story simply got in the way of action, and the Pablo/Pilar conflict.  What was Pablo going to do?

As bad as the print of Farewell to Arms was, For Whom the Bell Tolls was clean & clear. The Sierra Nevada Mountains as a backdrop were spectacular & the perfect stand-in for the mountains of Spain. Gary Cooper, Hemingway's favorite actor, was Robert the American. Ingrid Bergman was Maria. They were never better & the chemistry  was there. I've been in love with Ingrid Bergman for 40 years, ever since I first saw her in Casablanca. That movie has 441 reviews, so I'm not even going there. Her hair was cropped short. It was very sexy & everyone it seemed wanted to touch it. She threw herself at Robert & he caught her drift pretty quickly. ""You are shameless"" he said, more than once, & she was. A flawlessly beautiful face & blue eyes to die for. It has been said that both Cooper & Bergman could inhabit a role they were playing. It really didn't look like they were playing. Excellent acting all around. Akim Tamiroff was excellent as the treacherous Pablo. The rarely seen Katrina Paxinow won a supporting actress Oscar as Pilar. She actually had a leading role behind Cooper & Bergman as the leader of the rebels, a seer & surrogate mother to the young Maria. She allowed Roberto & Maria to be together in the short time they had. It's the Spanish Civil War in the 30's & they are hiding from the facist. Robert is there to blow up a bridge. But it is the love story that is the focus. In many war movies the love story is a stupid interlude. Not in this one.

Not only does it star Gary Cooper -- the most complete interpreter of the Hermingway hero on screen -- but it has a luminous  performance from Ingrid Bergman in the role of Maria. When it opened in  1943, a criticism centered on the fact that it did not specifically mention  Franco. However, what might have been a germane criticism back then is now  a genuine plus. Had this been focused on Franco, it now would be a dated  period piece. Instead, this story of doomed wartime love remains achingly  moving. And its theme of &quot;no man is an island&quot; is still haunting,  and the final images stay with you long after the film is over.

Victor Young's score is very soft, expressive and beautiful and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous--especially the snow scenes. And I'll agree that Katina Paxinou definitely deserved her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for the rough-and-tough-but-gentle-underneath gyspy lady but it was a tough call because Gladys Cooper was equally terrific and packed a great emotional punch as the Pharisee-turned-penitent nun in The Song of Bernadette. But there are several things that detracted me from enjoying the film.It starts out okay but quickly becomes a painfully boring movie to watch. One hour and it was not going anywhere. I kept waiting and waiting for it to pick up and become engaging. Finally towards the end of the second half we get the fight and bridge explosion a la The Bridge on the River Kwai. The movie could easily have been trimmed to two hours instead of three and not harmed the overall structure of the story. Back in the 40's, 50's and 60's three hour epics were often like that--the director gets so attached to his 'baby' that he doesn't have the nerve to trim and cut when it usually needs it. Of course some stories have to have a slow gradual development to bring all the tension to a dramatic and powerful close but I'd say such films are few and far between and usually you can tell when there's been some indulging and incidental, more-than-needed padding.Characters like Pablo would change personality and then magically change back. Was he for them or against them? Was he the protagonist or the antagonist? Was he faithful or treacherous? It's not adequately explained. I know he's just a supporting character, the movie is not about him and we as the audience are supposed to just accept some things going on but I still think his character should have been fleshed out a little more. Plus some of the dialogue is extremely repetitive and cringe-inducing ""I will live until I die."" ""I love you as my father, I love you as my mother, I love you as our unborn children, and I love you as what I hold dearest. And always remember I love you."" and ""I don't provoke"" (Repeated five times.) And that big grin from ear to ear and cheerful demeanor on Maria's face as she asks Roberto to show her how to shoot so she can end it all if she is captured by the enemy again--acting and talking like suicide is the most ordinary and delightful thing in the day--UUGGGHH!!!!

Chances are I will end up disappointed, I know. I confess I was afraid that this movie would be too watered down, in order to comply with commercial and censorship requirements of the 1940s, but I have to say the movie is an outstanding adaptation of a great novel.The movie is long so you might want to use the ""intermission"" and leave the second half for another day. At least that's what I did and it was a smart thing because I was fresh for the thrilling finale. Great acting and great action scenes. Remember, it was all filmed more than 60 years ago!  In fact, the last 20 minutes or so, portraying the fantastic last chapter of the book, are nearly faultless and absolutely convicing, keeping me on the edge of the seat! And above all, they did not mess with the end of the story.I would like to thank a previous reviewer who shared that the original version did not contain two of the key ""war passages"" of the book: the massacre at the town by the gorge (in flashback both in the book and in the movie) and El Sordo's last stand. These are two of the most haunting chapters in American literature (thanks master Hemingway!) and it was great to see them restored to the movie. Not as intense and brutal as I pictured reading the book, but very carefully filmed.All in all, if you like the novel, this is a very worthy adaptation and well worth your time.

It's very long and some of the sets look really fake.  Sometimes I lost track of the characters.However I had to give it five stars!  Why, after all these criticisms? One, for the theme.  Although these specific characters were fictional, they were based on real people who gave their lives fighting for their principles.  Not the least of these heroes and heroines was an American who gave up his academic career, as did a lot of others, to go to Spain to help the locals fight fascism.  This is a story worth telling.Secondly, the cast is perfect!  It's said that Hemingway personally selected Cooper and Bergman and they are wonderful.  Gary Cooper was such a special man, his presence alone makes the film worth watching.  The young Ingrid Bergman adds her own luminous qualities to the character of Maria.  You can see why the American guy fell for her in spite of his resolve not to become personally involved.  They are magic together, in spite of the age difference and one quickly forgives the fact that she doesn't look at all like a Spanish peasant.  Who cares? The scene where they have their last night together could have been excessively, embarrasingly maudlin if played by lesser actors, but these two really pull it off.  Anyone who can sit through the scene where she is forced to leave Cooper without shedding at least a few tears must have no heart.The Greek woman who plays the amazingly strong Pilar, is certainly memorable, too, as is the Russian who plays her loose cannon of a husband, Pedro.It is a little dated and, as I said earlier, very long.

I select Ingrid Bergman for special mention: I have yet to see her in any film where she falls short of splendid.

The human passions expressed by it are sadly missing in today's world.We can be happier that something else is missing now: the taciturn, minimally expressive heroism that Gary Cooper did so very well.  Today's heroes are deeply human, even flawed characters, and they don't mind if you see that.

The movie focus on the love development between Maria and Roberto which was excellently shown though a bit old-fashioned. Bergman's Maria was so natural and you can see how far she was into the role. But the time provided another politics: American hero fighting against Dictatorship an ally of Nazi and Facists. That worked far better than any of government sponsored war propaganda I suppose.SUPPORTING ACTORS and ACTRESSSupporting actors and actresses did the job quite well particularly I think ANSELMO was well performed. PABLO was also nicely acted particularly Pablo grinning at the scene of falling snow is truly scary reminding me of Jack Torrarence of SHINING.PILAR is a bit of letdown but not bad.THE ENDINGI suppect there was alternative version where Roberto could survive but the ending place it quite vague. Old fashioned theatrical ploy. I see why BUTCH CASSIDY and SUNDANCE KID ends the similar way.THE BRIDGEWhy must an American explode the bridge at THE BRIDGE AT RIVER KWAI? The answer might be here.REAL AMERICAN DYNAMITERHemingway might have probably heard of the story of American dynamiter somewhere and combined his own self to create the hero Robert Jordan. THE GOOD WAR interviews the model of Robert Jordan, Irvin Goff. It is said Maria was created by the image of Ingrid Bergman.Verdict: Very entertaining movieRating: 91 out of 100 The presence of Ingrid Bergman alone contributes 10 point plus.Recommended for any of classic movie fans.",5,Casts Made In Heaven,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,2448,"['Casts', 'were', 'chosen', 'author', 'Hemingway', 'short', 'comment', 'film', 'opening', 'was', 'really', 'miracle', 'Particularly', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'American', 'dynamiter', 'Roberto', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'hapless', 'young', 'girl', 'Maria', 'could', 'happen', 'only', 'number', 'miracles.SPAIN', 'IN', 'YOUR', 'BACKYARDAs', 'movie', 'opening', 'shooting', 'took', 'place', 'Sonora', 'Pass', 'California', 'not', 'Spain', ""n't"", 'ironic', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'Mountain', 'Range', 'was', 'named', 'Spanish', 'reminding', 'homeland', 'mountains', 'when', 'occupied', 'part', 'California.BONDED', 'BY', 'MOVIE', 'DEALAt', 'time', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'strongly', 'tied', 'contracts', 'prevented', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'role', 'Hemingway', 'wanted', 'film', 'win', 'movie', 'company', 'had', 'pay', 'huge', 'money', 'Maria', 'took', 'accicent', 'even', 'cut', 'own', 'hair', 'be', 'Maria', 'eventually', 'sacrificing', 'next', 'movierole.DELETION', 'OF', 'POLITICAL', 'ASPECTThat', 'why', 'movie', 'became', 'successful', 'became', 'very', 'entertaining', 'one', 'movie', 'focus', 'love', 'development', 'Maria', 'Roberto', 'was', 'excellently', 'shown', 'bit', 'old-fashioned', 'Bergman', 'Maria', 'was', 'so', 'natural', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'was', 'role', 'time', 'provided', 'politics', 'American', 'hero', 'fighting', 'Dictatorship', 'ally', 'Nazi', 'Facists', 'worked', 'far', 'better', 'government', 'sponsored', 'war', 'propaganda', 'suppose.SUPPORTING', 'ACTORS', 'ACTRESSSupporting', 'actors', 'actresses', 'did', 'job', 'quite', 'well', 'particularly', 'think', 'ANSELMO', 'was', 'well', 'performed', 'PABLO', 'was', 'also', 'nicely', 'acted', 'particularly', 'Pablo', 'grinning', 'scene', 'falling', 'snow', 'truly', 'scary', 'reminding', 'Jack', 'Torrarence', 'SHINING.PILAR', 'bit', 'letdown', 'not', 'bad.THE', 'ENDINGI', 'suppect', 'was', 'alternative', 'version', 'where', 'Roberto', 'could', 'survive', 'ending', 'place', 'quite', 'vague', 'Old', 'fashioned', 'theatrical', 'ploy', 'see', 'why', 'BUTCH', 'CASSIDY', 'SUNDANCE', 'KID', 'similar', 'way.THE', 'BRIDGEWhy', 'must', 'American', 'explode', 'bridge', 'THE', 'BRIDGE', 'AT', 'RIVER', 'KWAI', 'answer', 'might', 'be', 'here.REAL', 'AMERICAN', 'DYNAMITERHemingway', 'might', 'have', 'probably', 'heard', 'story', 'American', 'dynamiter', 'somewhere', 'combined', 'own', 'self', 'create', 'hero', 'Robert', 'Jordan', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'WAR', 'model', 'Robert', 'Jordan', 'Irvin', 'Goff', 'said', 'Maria', 'was', 'created', 'image', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman.Verdict', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'movieRating', '91', '100', 'presence', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'alone', '10', 'point', 'plus.Recommended', 'classic', 'movie', 'fans']",N/A
