455649,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,6305240019,cinemagirl,"[4, 5]","How such a quality film could pass unnoticed by critics and audiences is beyond my comprehension. Before seeing this film by chance one night on a movie channel, I had only a vague and nebulous recollection of this film, something along the lines of, ""I remember Anne Heche in the trailer...some dramatic music going on, I think, and set in Malaysia or Thailand."" Admittedly, I did not expect to be affected by the film; rather, I expected an average drama that I would forget about even before I went to bed. However, this film has made me think twice about discounting films so quickly.I will not summarise the film, as many reviewers here have already done so, but I will add my two cents to recommend such an extraordinary piece of work that illustrates Hollywood's ability to still churn out quality films (albeit without the pomp and circumstance of a typical $100 million budget studio film).The first thing I noticed was the performance given by Anne Heche (Beth), Vince Vaughn (Sheriff), and Joaquin Phoenix (Lewis). Deep emotion was infused in the most simple lines exchanged between two characters, be it at a construction site or a dingy New York apartment. The film goes straight to the point. We are given but some short glimpses of a vivacious and happy Lewis before we are thrown into the moral dilemma - will Sheriff go back to save his friend's life? It seems unlikely that audiences would sympathise with Lewis, as we, the audience, and Sheriff barely know Lewis. The fact that we do sympathise deeply with Lewis clearly demonstrates Phoenix's exceptional acting skills. Also, Heche and Vaughn, although ultimately involved in a relationship (which I deemed to be necessary), make every scene and word believable. As the movie begins we all wonder why Beth, the desperate lawyer, is so dedicated to Lewis. I did not expect my wonder to be appeased, but it was. I won't spoil the surprise.Quite telling that I haven't forgotten about this film since I first saw it, as I have watched many films without being at all impressed or touched. There are several touching scenes throughout the film, but I will point out the most astounding:* Lewis's taped outpouring while in the Malaysian prison. Whilst begging Sheriff to return to Malaysia, Lewis is also stating his own guilt for asking, incredibly trying to be humble about asking for his life.* Lewis' digression in the prison, his stream of consciousness speech that is perhaps my most favourite scene in the entire movie. Joaquin Phoenix, although his own worst critic who always sees flaws in his performances, cannot possibly not see the beauty in his acting, especially in this scene. Give Joaquin his Oscar statuette now!* Spoiler, so I won't go into detail. But it's the ending. Enough said.If you want big explosives, vapid lines like ""it's time to meet your doom,"" or big sequences of impressive special effects, you will not get them here; for, this is a film that thrives purely from the strength of the actors, the quality of the script, and the remarkable scenes. This is not to say this is a film for the few people who dig boring dramas, and this is by no means an art house film. It is to say, however, that this is a film filled with touches of humour, intense drama, romance, and moral crossroads. If I had to sum this film up in one word, it would be ""haunting.""",5,Hauntingly Good....Where was Oscar?,979171200,"01 11, 2001",2001,3349,"['How', 'such', 'quality', 'film', 'could', 'pass', 'unnoticed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'comprehension', 'seeing', 'film', 'chance', 'one', 'night', 'movie', 'channel', 'had', 'only', 'vague', 'nebulous', 'recollection', 'film', 'something', 'lines', 'remember', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'trailer', 'dramatic', 'music', 'going', 'think', 'set', 'Malaysia', 'Thailand', 'Admittedly', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'affected', 'film', 'rather', 'expected', 'average', 'drama', 'would', 'forget', 'even', 'went', 'bed', 'However', 'film', 'made', 'think', 'twice', 'discounting', 'films', 'so', 'quickly.I', 'will', 'not', 'summarise', 'film', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'will', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'recommend', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'ability', 'still', 'churn', 'out', 'quality', 'films', 'pomp', 'circumstance', 'typical', '100', 'million', 'budget', 'studio', 'film', '.The', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'performance', 'given', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Beth', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Sheriff', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Lewis', 'Deep', 'emotion', 'was', 'infused', 'most', 'simple', 'lines', 'exchanged', 'two', 'characters', 'be', 'construction', 'site', 'dingy', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'film', 'straight', 'point', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'glimpses', 'vivacious', 'happy', 'Lewis', 'are', 'thrown', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'will', 'Sheriff', 'go', 'back', 'save', 'friend', 'life', 'unlikely', 'audiences', 'would', 'sympathise', 'Lewis', 'audience', 'Sheriff', 'barely', 'know', 'Lewis', 'fact', 'do', 'sympathise', 'deeply', 'Lewis', 'clearly', 'Phoenix', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'skills', 'Also', 'Heche', 'Vaughn', 'ultimately', 'involved', 'relationship', 'deemed', 'be', 'necessary', 'make', 'scene', 'word', 'believable', 'movie', 'wonder', 'why', 'Beth', 'desperate', 'lawyer', 'so', 'dedicated', 'Lewis', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'wonder', 'be', 'appeased', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'surprise.Quite', 'telling', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'film', 'first', 'saw', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'being', 'impressed', 'touched', 'are', 'several', 'touching', 'scenes', 'film', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'most', 'astounding', '*', 'Lewis', 'taped', 'outpouring', 'Malaysian', 'prison', 'Whilst', 'begging', 'Sheriff', 'return', 'Malaysia', 'Lewis', 'also', 'stating', 'own', 'guilt', 'asking', 'incredibly', 'trying', 'be', 'humble', 'asking', 'life', '*', 'Lewis', 'digression', 'prison', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'speech', 'perhaps', 'most', 'favourite', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'own', 'worst', 'critic', 'who', 'always', 'flaws', 'performances', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'not', 'see', 'beauty', 'acting', 'especially', 'scene', 'Give', 'Joaquin', 'Oscar', 'statuette', 'now', '*', 'Spoiler', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'ending', 'Enough', 'said.If', 'want', 'big', 'explosives', 'vapid', 'lines', 'time', 'meet', 'doom', 'big', 'sequences', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'film', 'purely', 'strength', 'actors', 'quality', 'script', 'remarkable', 'scenes', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'dig', 'boring', 'dramas', 'means', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'say', 'however', 'film', 'filled', 'touches', 'humour', 'intense', 'drama', 'romance', 'moral', 'crossroads', 'had', 'sum', 'film', 'up', 'one', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'haunting']",Return to Paradise VHS
455650,A3O90G1D7I5EGG,6305240019,dev1,"[2, 2]","""Return To Paradise"" begins a little slow, but gains momentum as the film progresses. The main character (Vince Vaughn) is faced with a life altering decision: whether or not to give up a part of his life to save the life of a friend. We're treated to a wide array of conflicts including honesty versus deceit, caring versus apathy, love versus self-gratification, and guilt versus innocence. These emotional conflicts provide the twists and turns and thought provoking impact of ""Return To Paradise,"" and fragment the viewer's concentration (not unlike that of the characters) on the key question: will Vince Vaughn do one honorable thing in his life which is not in his own self-interest?Despite the fact that the film doesn't travel from beginning to end in a direct line, we know the answer to the question ""Does the Bad Guy become the Good Guy""? Acting is first-rate, and often makes one forget flaws in the story line. The slow unveiling of Vaughn's identity is excellent.I would have preferred that the film had left out the relationship between Vaughn and Heche.

455651,A2NWMKTGGROUM8,6305240019,"""doctor_smith""","[3, 3]","This film was overlooked when it was released in 1998, and then it was virtually forgotten. That was unfortunate because ""Return to Paradise"" is a powerful (and powerfully acted) film. On the other hand, its neglect at the box office really wasn't much of a surprise; this is a serious film that doesn't allow viewers to walk away lightly, and it is therefore not the typical Hollywood escapist fare that moviegoers throng to week after week.But if film, like all art, is about life then serious films about complicated subjects are needed and welcome from time to time, particularly if such films treat their subject matter with respect and thoughtfulness. Three friends vacation in Malaysia (with drugs, booze, and women), two return, and one stays behind, only to find himself imprisoned and sentenced to death for possessing drugs the three of them used. His death sentence will be overturned if the other two return and serve time in prison. A lawyer (played effectively by Anne Heche) contacts the two men and tries to convince them to return.A serious subject, indeed, but it's the way in which the film is acted, directed, and handled that make it so touching and provocative. The film's greatest achievement is the way in which it makes the moral dilemma faced by the characters so palpably real and so powerfully complicated. It doesn't tread lightly or simplify, nor does it overburden the film with tedious, needless moralizing or cliched rhetoric. It's moral tone is spot on; it is heavy, to be sure, but you appreciate it because you, as a viewer, feel the weight as much as the characters do.""Return to Paradise"" is also stellar because it centers on cultural differences and moral responsibility without being morally relativistic (relativistic, by the way, is how most Hollywood movies would handle such a subject). The film exposes the complexities of circumstance without making the story confusing, just as it approaches the entire story in the most balanced and judicious way. This is not a far-fetched situation (Kenneth Turan of the LA Times thought otherwise, but I disagree); in fact, it's the type of moral dilemma many have faced in their lives (not the exact situation, but the consequences of mistakes, the dilemma of deciding what to do in the midst of a painfully serious situation). This is a film based not so much on plot as it is on ethical debate.The acting is superb. Joaquin Phoenix's jailed, wounded Lewis is an outstanding portrayal of a soul that has withered under the weight of its situation. Anne Heche's Beth Easton is both fortitudinous and fragile. But it's Vince Vaughn's ""Sheriff"" that steals the show, as we witness a man who gradually evolves from careless to morally responsible -- and it's entirely believable.Ultimately, as we find out towards the end of the film, ""Return to Paradise"" is deeply humane (even in its suggestive cynicism). Sheriff does something for Lewis that virtually makes up for his past mistakes, that gives meaning to Lewis's deeply pointless and helpless misery, and that proves just how morally courageous Sheriff has become (I can't describe it without explaining the film's ending, but it inolves Sheriff yelling to Lewis through a cell window).Overall, a well-made film.

455654,AIO247KHD2O40,6305240019,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Return to Paradise is a 90's film that poses the dilemma of would you sacrifice 3 years (or 6 if you are the only one to do the right thing) of your own life, if it would save the life of a friend you met while traveling who will be executed if you do nothing, for a crime you not only participated in but you were also  responsible for the police being there to discover the drugs in the first place?  You'd like to think  everyone would take responsibility for their actions and see it as a no brainer, put their hand up, do the time and save their friend's life.  But the real world isn't like that and the moral dilemma of two guys currently safe to go on with their everyday lives in New York if they do nothing, instead of doing time in a Malaysian prison is what we the viewer follow for a good chunk of the film.The premise is a good one but ultimately the way the film portrayed the scenario wasn't that believable to me.  This review contain spoilers if you wish to read on.  The film at no time indicates that the US government was even aware, let alone involved at all in trying to save the life of one of its citizens.  Surely the US consulate would have been the first point of call for Phoenix's character when he was charged with a crime involving the death penalty or even just a lengthy stint in a foreign jail.  At least by his lawyer if not by him.  Yet the sister never refers to them at all and we don't see them in the court scenes.  Also both of the New York friends don't contact them or even lawyers of their own to make sure what is being offered by this suddenly in their faces lawyer is legit.  Obviously she wasn't really a lawyer and is in fact the sister would have been the first thing pointed out to them if they did.  I can't see anyone confessing to a crime without legal advice, especially one that someone else has been convicted of and is about to be executed in a few days.The sister character was well acted by Anne Heche but as a character didn't play her hand that well.  This is a what if I was in their shoes type movie and I think the viewer also places themselves in the sister's shoes as well as the boys.  In the sister's I wouldn't have been meeting each of the guys separately, I would have invited them to a dinner or lodge somewhere with the promise of a gift from their former travel companion (we know they know he was wealthy and they aren't doing too well themselves), perhaps they even expect to meet up with him  and then when they get there explain he is facing the death and the gift is the video of him pleading with them to confess. Then let them guilt and pressure each other into doing the right thing.  Then play the give them money card if need be, sleep with them to get them there, stay on the path if need be cards (and yes you would do this, you'd do whatever it took to save your brother's life).  I guess she pretended to be a lawyer as the deal she spoke of probably wasn't really on the cards and she just hoped that by showing the Malaysian court there were three of them there the amount of drugs would be divided and her brother's grade of charges lessened to where the death penalty wasn't in play.  But if there was a deal she would have been better off telling them from the start she was his sister and it would be harder to condemn a man to death to his sister's face, rather than a lawyer's.I also didn't buy the whole big bad media angle.  There's no way an American facing execution wouldn't be in their radar already.  The Malaysian government wants to make an example of him so other foreigners respect their culture and laws, that the whole point of executing him.  They would have told the foreign media when he was sentenced to hang.  Plus how did the ""evil career ahead of man's life"" journalist know she was in New York anyway?  Plus we do this whole side story and never return to a scene with her reflecting on her actions internally or with other journalists in the office, or especially with the sister after the final events in the film.  The film needed that scene.Speaking of other left hanging scenes, what happened to Vince Vaughn's character?  Does he also get executed or was the so called deal the sister pitched real and was honoured?  Did he ever see the sister again while behind bars after she visited him to find out the final moments of her brother and had a I'm sorry you're here for nothing for six years because of me but thanks anyway visit.  Sure guilt may have made her promise to come back and visit him but did she really do it when obviously she slept with him at the hotel in the bath because she was pretty sure both the guys were having second thoughts when they were going into their rooms and she needed him to continue on track and convince Tony to stay too.Return to Paradise is a good stimulate discussion movie so best viewed in a group or at least passed around to discuss later.

455658,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6305240019,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 12]","In the American adaptation of ""Force majeure,"" we get a great setup.  ""Return to Paradise"" poses the moral dilemma of whether someone would be willing to give up several years of freedom to save another's life.  It's a fantastic, sticky ethical quandary and one that I think is presented quite well in this film.  Vince Vaughn and David Conrad play two guys who are asked this question--as a buddy they left in Malaysia is about to be put to death (on a drug charge for which they all bore responsibility).As we see these two wrestle with the implications, the doubts and the ambiguities--this film is at its strongest.  How far will you go to be a ""good"" person, and is it worth it?  Very weighty issues.The first half of this film is solid, solid material.  The lawyer who approaches them, played by Anne Heche, also gets involved with Vaughn personally.  I could have done without this romance--but as characters struggling and conflicted and despairing, I suppose there was some basis for them to be drawn together.  Another outside force, however, is a newspaper reporter played by hard-as-nails Jada Pinkett Smith.  For those of you who have seen the patented Pinkett Smith hard-as-nails performance--it's really not much to see.  And her character is pretty pointless, as well--a plot convenience to be revealed at a later time.  But even though it was far from perfect, this half was thoroughly compelling.Sadly, the film ventures to Malaysia for the remainder of the movie.  What becomes painfully obvious now is that our romance has moved to the forefront of the picture.  Joaquin Pheonix, as the prisoner, has yet to be fleshed out as a character.  We don't see any real relationship between he and Vaughn or he and Heche.  This is a fatal flaw!  As we move into melodrama, I was surprisingly unmoved.  Intellectually, I knew I should care but the film never bothered to emotionally invest me.  So while I was left cold having hoped for so much more--then the big surprise courtroom revelation (see plot convenience mentioned in above paragraph).Ultimately, the romance was again played up for the finale.  With Phoenix being a character construct or plot device--instead of someone we knew and cared about--the film kills itself.  Far from being an awful movie--what could have been powerful and emotionally devastating is really just mundane.

455659,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6305240019,Lawyeraau,"[29, 33]","This is a wonderfully creative movie, with top-notch directing and award caliber performances by a talented cast. The premise is a fairly simple one. Three young men, Sheriff (Vincent Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad), and Louis (Joaquin Phoenix), who previously didn't know one another, team up in Malaysia and party hearty. They have fun drinking, smoking hashish, and picking up girls. Sheriff and Tony head back to the states, leaving Louis behind, as he has a wildlife conservation idea involving orangutans that he wishes to pursue while in Malaysia. Before they go, Sheriff makes it a point to leave his dope stash in the house in which Louis is remaining. Later, the police come to search the premises on a matter unrelated to the dope stash. When they find it, however, they arrest Louis, who literally has been left holding the bag.Two years later, Anne Heche enters the picture as a lawyer, ostensibly working on behalf of her client, Louis. She seeks out Sheriff and Tony with a proposition. It seems that while Sheriff and Tony have been getting on with their lives, Louis has been rotting in a Malaysian prison for the past two years and living in sheer terror. You see, Louis is scheduled to be executed in eight days as a drug dealer, as the amount of dope that had been left behind and discovered by the police was just over a threshold amount that would classify it as being for distribution, rather than for personal use. The only hope Louis has of staying alive is if Sheriff and Tony go back to Malaysia to take responsibility for their part in this and serve three years each. If only one returns, then the sole returnee faces six years. Will it be all for one and one for all? Will Louis live to personally thank his friends? Watch the movie and find out.Vince Vaughn as Sheriff gives a compelling performance. Playing the quintessential Everyman, he struggles with his moral obligation. It is strictly a moral one, as legally he can just sit by and do nothing. Tony, too, undergoes some soul searching. They finally both come to the same conclusion, or do they? The dilemma that they face is an excruciatingly personal one. The movie builds up to a level of suspense that is totally unexpected. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. Meanwhile, Joaquin Phoenix, one of the finest young actors of his generation, gives a performance that will haunt the viewer for days. Anne Heche also give a noteworthy performance, intense and relentless in her quest to save what life Louis has left. Jada Pinkett also gives a strong performance as a news reporter who is interested in the story. Her interjection into the movie brings into the forefront the issue of the responsibility of the press. When you see this movie, you will understand what this means.This film is excellent on all fronts. The only weakness was an unnecessary subplot, which involved a blossoming romance between Sheriff and the character played by Anne Heche. Were it not for this digression, I would have given the movie five stars. It is an otherwise profoundly moving film that deserves to be seen.",4,AN INVENTIVE AND PROFOUND MODERN DAY MORALITY TALE...,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,3100,"['wonderfully', 'creative', 'movie', 'top-notch', 'directing', 'award', 'caliber', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast', 'premise', 'fairly', 'simple', 'one', 'Three', 'young', 'men', 'Sheriff', 'Vincent', 'Vaughn', 'Tony', 'David', 'Conrad', 'Louis', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'previously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'team', 'up', 'Malaysia', 'party', 'hearty', 'have', 'fun', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'hashish', 'picking', 'up', 'girls', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'head', 'back', 'states', 'leaving', 'Louis', 'behind', 'wildlife', 'conservation', 'idea', 'involving', 'orangutans', 'pursue', 'Malaysia', 'go', 'Sheriff', 'point', 'leave', 'dope', 'stash', 'house', 'Louis', 'remaining', 'Later', 'police', 'come', 'search', 'premises', 'matter', 'unrelated', 'dope', 'stash', 'When', 'find', 'however', 'arrest', 'Louis', 'who', 'literally', 'been', 'left', 'holding', 'bag.Two', 'years', 'later', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'picture', 'lawyer', 'ostensibly', 'working', 'behalf', 'client', 'Louis', 'out', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'proposition', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'lives', 'Louis', 'been', 'rotting', 'Malaysian', 'prison', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'living', 'sheer', 'terror', 'see', 'Louis', 'scheduled', 'be', 'executed', 'eight', 'days', 'drug', 'dealer', 'amount', 'dope', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'discovered', 'police', 'was', 'just', 'threshold', 'amount', 'would', 'classify', 'being', 'distribution', 'rather', 'personal', 'use', 'only', 'hope', 'Louis', 'staying', 'alive', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'go', 'back', 'Malaysia', 'take', 'responsibility', 'part', 'serve', 'three', 'years', 'only', 'one', 'returns', 'then', 'sole', 'returnee', 'six', 'years', 'Will', 'be', 'one', 'one', 'Will', 'Louis', 'live', 'personally', 'thank', 'friends', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Sheriff', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Playing', 'quintessential', 'Everyman', 'moral', 'obligation', 'strictly', 'moral', 'one', 'legally', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'do', 'nothing', 'Tony', 'too', 'soul', 'searching', 'finally', 'come', 'same', 'conclusion', 'do', 'dilemma', 'face', 'excruciatingly', 'personal', 'one', 'movie', 'up', 'level', 'suspense', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'are', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'guessing', 'Meanwhile', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'one', 'finest', 'young', 'actors', 'generation', 'performance', 'will', 'haunt', 'viewer', 'days', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'also', 'give', 'noteworthy', 'performance', 'intense', 'relentless', 'quest', 'save', 'what', 'life', 'Louis', 'left', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'also', 'strong', 'performance', 'news', 'reporter', 'who', 'interested', 'story', 'interjection', 'movie', 'forefront', 'issue', 'responsibility', 'press', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'understand', 'what', 'means.This', 'film', 'excellent', 'fronts', 'only', 'weakness', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'involved', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'Sheriff', 'character', 'played', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Were', 'not', 'digression', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'otherwise', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'film', 'be', 'seen']",Return to Paradise VHS

And I couldn't stop watching.The film opens in Malaysia where three young American men are just plain having a good time.  There are wonderful beaches, lots of girls and plenty of hashish.  Then their vacation is over.  Two of them return home.  The third, Lewis, played by Joaquin Phoenix, decides to stay on and join a group that saves gorillas.Fast forward now two years.  As none of these Americans knew each other too well, they have lost touch.  Enter Anne Heche.  She contacts both John, played by Vince Vaughn and David, played by Tony Croft.  She tells them she is Lewis' attorney.  The story is that right after the three men separated, Lewis was arrested for hashish possession.  It was such a large quantity that he is considered a drug trafficker;  the sentence is death.  He's been in a Malaysian jail all this time and the case has been under appeal.  But the appeals have run out, and Lewis is sentenced to die in just eight days.However, if both John and David would return to Malaysia and each serve a 3-year sentence, Lewis' life would be saved.  If only one of the men return, the sentence would be six years.  But either way, Lewis would be allowed to live.  This is quite a dilemma.  And from that point on I knew that no matter how it turned out, it would not be a pleasant ending.  I couldn't help my real deep emotions that surfaced during this film.  What would I do if put into that situation?  A Malaysia prison is a horrible place.  And in case we don't get it, there are several scenes shot there.This is a fine film.

Eye,"[1, 1]","This movie is about personal integrity and offers some of the most powerful performances I've ever seen by Joaquin Phoenix as Lewis McBride & Vincent Vaughn as John 'Sheriff' Volgecherev.  The plot sets up the moral quandry - one of three vacationing Americans (Lewis) is jailed and sentenced to death in Malaysia and, after serving two years of the jail sentence in squalor and deprivation, is scheduled to be executed by hanging in 8 days.  Lewis was convicted of drug trafficking due to the amount of hashish left behind when two of the Americans with whom he was vacationing returned to the U.S.  As Americans in a foreign country, although they did not know one another prior to the vacation, they partied together during the vacation and became friends.  If both the American friends return, stand trial & serve sentences in Malaysia, Lewis will not be executed & his sentence will be reduced to just 3 years (1 yr remaining).  If only one friend returns and serves his sentence, both Lewis and the friend will have 6-yr sentences but Lewis will not be executed.  Sheriff and Tony Croft (David Conrad) are approached by McBride's attorney, Beth Eastern (Anne Heche).  Unbeknownst to them, she is McBride's sister.  Beth's dogged pursuit of Sheriff and Tony is impassioned by her love for her brother yet her relationship with Lewis is not divulged until later.  While both agree to return at first, only Sheriff manages to follow through.  He is shocked at the sight of McBride yet despite his own fear, he manages to be the rock upon which McBride must rely in enduring what faces him.  Upon witnessing the strength and ultimate selflessness of Sheriff, Beth falls in love with him and she promises that she will be there for him when he is released.In summary, Sheriff & Tony are asked to accompany attorney Beth Eastern back to Malaysia and sacrifice 3-6 yrs of their lives, spending it in the confines of a prison that is rather horrific compared to U.S. standards, in order to save the life of a fellow American they met while vacationing.  The decision is made more difficult since the bonds from close friendship or family are absent.  The decision to Return to Paradise, sans these emotional bonds, is thereby made based solely on the sense of responsibility each man feels as well as his own perception regarding what sacrifice he expects of himself to shoulder that responsibility.This is a film which delivers a great plot and outstanding performances and keeps the viewer's interest.  The issues that are broached and the manner in which each character deals with them are arresting and a viewer will not remain untouched by the enormity of the human condition.  This film focuses more on the processes involved in arriving at the decision to knowingly and willingly sacrifice oneself in order to be true to one's convictions while it discloses less of the suffering and strife of imprisonment.",5,Outstanding masterpiece - on par with The Four Feathers,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2912,"['movie', 'personal', 'integrity', 'most', 'powerful', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Lewis', 'McBride', 'Vincent', 'Vaughn', 'John', ""'Sheriff"", 'Volgecherev', 'plot', 'up', 'moral', 'quandry', 'one', 'three', 'vacationing', 'Americans', 'Lewis', 'jailed', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Malaysia', 'serving', 'two', 'years', 'jail', 'sentence', 'squalor', 'deprivation', 'scheduled', 'be', 'executed', 'hanging', '8', 'days', 'Lewis', 'was', 'convicted', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'due', 'amount', 'hashish', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'two', 'Americans', 'whom', 'was', 'vacationing', 'returned', 'U.S.', 'Americans', 'foreign', 'country', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'one', 'prior', 'vacation', 'partied', 'together', 'vacation', 'became', 'friends', 'American', 'friends', 'return', 'stand', 'trial', 'serve', 'sentences', 'Malaysia', 'Lewis', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'executed', 'sentence', 'will', 'be', 'reduced', 'just', '3', 'years', '1', 'yr', 'remaining', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'returns', 'sentence', 'Lewis', 'friend', 'will', 'have', '6-yr', 'sentences', 'Lewis', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'executed', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'Croft', 'David', 'Conrad', 'are', 'approached', 'McBride', 'attorney', 'Beth', 'Eastern', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Unbeknownst', 'McBride', 'sister', 'Beth', 'dogged', 'pursuit', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'impassioned', 'love', 'brother', 'yet', 'relationship', 'Lewis', 'not', 'divulged', 'later', 'agree', 'return', 'first', 'only', 'Sheriff', 'follow', 'shocked', 'sight', 'McBride', 'yet', 'own', 'fear', 'be', 'rock', 'McBride', 'must', 'rely', 'enduring', 'what', 'witnessing', 'strength', 'ultimate', 'selflessness', 'Sheriff', 'Beth', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'released.In', 'summary', 'Sheriff', 'Tony', 'are', 'asked', 'accompany', 'attorney', 'Beth', 'Eastern', 'back', 'Malaysia', 'sacrifice', '3-6', 'yrs', 'lives', 'spending', 'confines', 'prison', 'rather', 'horrific', 'compared', 'U.S.', 'standards', 'order', 'save', 'life', 'fellow', 'American', 'met', 'vacationing', 'decision', 'made', 'more', 'difficult', 'bonds', 'close', 'friendship', 'family', 'are', 'absent', 'decision', 'Return', 'Paradise', 'emotional', 'bonds', 'thereby', 'made', 'based', 'solely', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'perception', 'regarding', 'what', 'sacrifice', 'shoulder', 'responsibility.This', 'film', 'great', 'plot', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'viewer', 'interest', 'issues', 'are', 'broached', 'manner', 'character', 'deals', 'are', 'arresting', 'viewer', 'will', 'not', 'remain', 'untouched', 'enormity', 'human', 'condition', 'film', 'more', 'processes', 'involved', 'arriving', 'decision', 'knowingly', 'willingly', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'be', 'true', 'one', 'convictions', 'less', 'suffering', 'strife', 'imprisonment']",Return to Paradise VHS

This was recommended to me after seeing 'Brokedown Palace' but this is a  much better movie. This movie will make you think, and will leave you  thinking days after. What would you do in a situation where you had to  choose 3 years in prison, or the loss of a friend. One criticism here, is  that the film should have presented the friends as 3 school buddies who  were getting together for all times sake. It would have had much more  impact. In the movie they only knew the guy (Phoenix) for 5 weeks. The film  does have a few weaknesses such as the love affair between Heche and  Vaughn. That spoilt it in a way as it stole the true importance of the  movie. Why does Hollywood think they need a love affair in every movie?  Heche would have been too wound up about her brother to be thinking of  things like that - afterall, the countdown had truly begun - only days to  go until her brother was to be hung.
