1080657,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000R9CO94,Bobby Underwood,"[4, 5]","Film buffs will be absolutely delighted to own this twenty minutes of unmitigated fun. The Stolen Jools (a.k.a. The Slippery Pearls) is a merry little short with so many early 1930's stars showing up in its brief running time that one needs a scoreboard to keep track of them all! Ironically, this gemstone intended to help fight tuberculosis and raise money for a Hollywood sanitarium was sponsored by Chesterfield! The cigarette is prominently displayed and smoked throughout.You can sense everyone from Buster Keaton to Richard Barthlemess is having a grand time when it is discovered Norma Sherarer's jewels have been lifted. Edward G. Robinson was stealing them for himself and had them taken from him. Shearer is a sheer delight pleading for the detective to find them while Laurel and Hardy wait outside. Before you can say Warner Baxter, Joan Crawford, a rival of Shearer's, is questioned. It turns out all she took from the party was a cute little dog, however. Styme and Chubby from the Our Gang shorts add to the search, and Irene Dunne describes the missing jewels perfectly, yet claims not to have ever seen them!Word about the theft reaches Chief Gary Cooper, and the famous suspects just keep on comin'! Making an appearance are Barbara Stanwyck, Buddy Rogers, Fay Wray, Bebe Daniels, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Loretta Young, William Haines, Eugene Pallette, Claudia Dell, and a very funny Wheeler and Woolsey. And that's simply the tip of the iceberg! Though it may be short, you'll have to watch it several times to catch everyone. From Bebe Daniels to Ben Lyon, Fay Wray to Wallace Beery, you'll have a ball picking out a big star you missed the second or third time around.This is also available with a terrific ""B"" mystery, Dragnet, from another company. Either way, it is a must own curio for real fans.",5,Great Fun!,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,1824,"['Film', 'buffs', 'will', 'be', 'absolutely', 'delighted', 'own', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'unmitigated', 'fun', 'Stolen', 'Jools', 'a.k.a', 'Slippery', 'Pearls', 'merry', 'little', 'short', 'so', 'many', 'early', '1930', 'stars', 'showing', 'up', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'scoreboard', 'keep', 'track', 'Ironically', 'gemstone', 'intended', 'help', 'fight', 'tuberculosis', 'raise', 'money', 'Hollywood', 'sanitarium', 'was', 'sponsored', 'Chesterfield', 'cigarette', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'smoked', 'throughout.You', 'can', 'sense', 'everyone', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Richard', 'Barthlemess', 'having', 'grand', 'time', 'when', 'discovered', 'Norma', 'Sherarer', 'jewels', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'was', 'stealing', 'had', 'taken', 'Shearer', 'sheer', 'delight', 'pleading', 'detective', 'find', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'wait', 'outside', 'can', 'say', 'Warner', 'Baxter', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'rival', 'Shearer', 'questioned', 'out', 'took', 'party', 'was', 'cute', 'little', 'dog', 'however', 'Styme', 'Chubby', 'Gang', 'add', 'search', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'missing', 'jewels', 'perfectly', 'yet', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Word', 'theft', 'Chief', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'famous', 'suspects', 'just', 'keep', 'comin', 'Making', 'appearance', 'are', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'Fay', 'Wray', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'William', 'Haines', 'Eugene', 'Pallette', 'Claudia', 'Dell', 'very', 'funny', 'Wheeler', 'Woolsey', 'simply', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'may', 'be', 'short', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'catch', 'everyone', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'Ben', 'Lyon', 'Fay', 'Wray', 'Wallace', 'Beery', ""'ll"", 'have', 'ball', 'picking', 'out', 'big', 'star', 'missed', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'around.This', 'also', 'available', 'terrific', 'B', 'mystery', 'Dragnet', 'company', 'way', 'must', 'own', 'curio', 'real', 'fans']",Stolen Jools

It is cute enough and notable for the appearances - however brief - of so many stars in one film including Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Edward G. Robinson, Wallace Beery, and of course, Norma Shearer, whose jewelry has been stolen. It is also included onComedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collectionfor just a little more than is being charged for this one so-so short film. Plus you get a total of 50 films including a bunch of Buster Keaton short silent films, an Ernst Lubitsch - ""That Uncertain Feeling"", and an odd little comedy starring James Cagney entitled ""Something to Sing About"", which was made when Cagney was having one of his feuds with Jack Warner over his contract.
