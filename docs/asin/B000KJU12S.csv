That set is an absolute must for anyone interested in the film career of Alfred Hitchcock, with some of his earlier British films (including 4 silent movies), lovingly restored and with some wonderful extras, most notably an hour long documentary on early Hitchcock. It's amazing how great these movies look on this new masters (infinitely better than all previous releases, that can now be easily dismissed). I just hope that Studio Canal and Optimun Classic get round to release soon the rest of the British films, particularly The Lodger, the first true Hitchcock work only available so far in unwatchable transfers. Some of these films may not be great works of art, up to the standard set by the master in his later opus, but in all of them can be found moments and ideas which speak loud of a real genius in working process.

There probably isn't much money in these restorations as the films have been in public domain for decades and can be found in every DVD bargain bin.  They look very good for their age but I question some of the ""foley"" work added to the soundtracks.  In the sound films, it is obvious that tinkling glass sound effects and other little audio nuances have been mixed in to the old mono track.The films will be primarily of interest to an avid Hitchcock fan, with their subjective camera tricks and embellishments, early examples of the Hitchcock style.

1034674,A25KKXUQQ0OLWB,B000KJU12S,"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher""","[0, 0]","When I was younger, these films couldn't be seen on TV or in a theatre, I only could read about them in books where it often seemed that they were mentioned as lost or in poor condition.  Sometimes it was said they weren't that great anyway so no loss, right?  I am very pleased that Studio Canal and Lionsgate took these films out of the public domain where they were being neglected and brought them together in a restored DVD set where they can be viewed by many people.  I found each film to be enjoyable in their own way and very worthy of being seen.  The Ring is a great film with many Hitchcock touches in the cinematography.  The Manxman, Murder and The Skin Game are less like ""Hitchcock"" films because sound made them more static in movement but are very worthy films.  They were also stories taken from famous books and plays in which Hitchcock was trying to be faithful to the original creations.  The documentary is fascinating and narrated by wonderful people.  In it I learned that the sound tracks for films such as Murder were recorded right onto the film so no cuts or dubs were able to be made.  They show a scene from Murder where a character is talking to himself in the bathroom mirror as he shaves.  The scene required the actor to manage shaving and talking, without error and looking into the bathroom mirror while doing so.  In addition, since music couldn't be added later, there was an orchestra close by playing the background music.  Hitchcock was able to set the scene up and coordinate this.  He was seen as being creative in the silent cinema and then being able to do things with early sound other filmmakers wouldn't attempt.  The last film is Rich and Strange when sound was getting better in 1931.  It is a nice story about a young couple who lose their way when they come into some money and go on a trip around the world.  Of course some hard times crop up and they find their way back to their ""roots.""  I never really knew how good these films are from reading about them in books.  I wonder if the authors of those Hitchcock fan books had seen them.  I doubt it.  These films are not great masterpieces but tell an essential story about Hitchcock and can stand on their own as good films.",5,Early Hitchcock Films and Wonderful Documentary,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2231,"['When', 'was', 'younger', 'films', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'TV', 'theatre', 'only', 'could', 'read', 'books', 'where', 'often', 'seemed', 'were', 'mentioned', 'lost', 'poor', 'condition', 'was', 'said', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'anyway', 'so', 'no', 'loss', 'right', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'Studio', 'Canal', 'Lionsgate', 'took', 'films', 'public', 'domain', 'where', 'were', 'being', 'neglected', 'brought', 'together', 'restored', 'DVD', 'set', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'many', 'people', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'way', 'very', 'worthy', 'being', 'seen', 'Ring', 'great', 'film', 'many', 'Hitchcock', 'touches', 'cinematography', 'Manxman', 'Murder', 'Skin', 'Game', 'are', 'less', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'sound', 'made', 'more', 'static', 'movement', 'are', 'very', 'worthy', 'films', 'were', 'also', 'stories', 'taken', 'famous', 'books', 'plays', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'faithful', 'original', 'creations', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'narrated', 'wonderful', 'people', 'learned', 'sound', 'tracks', 'films', 'such', 'Murder', 'were', 'recorded', 'right', 'film', 'so', 'cuts', 'dubs', 'were', 'able', 'be', 'made', 'show', 'scene', 'Murder', 'where', 'character', 'talking', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'scene', 'required', 'actor', 'manage', 'shaving', 'talking', 'error', 'looking', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'doing', 'so', 'addition', 'music', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'added', 'later', 'was', 'orchestra', 'close', 'playing', 'background', 'music', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'able', 'set', 'scene', 'up', 'coordinate', 'was', 'seen', 'being', 'creative', 'silent', 'cinema', 'then', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'early', 'sound', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'would', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'last', 'film', 'Rich', 'Strange', 'when', 'sound', 'was', 'getting', 'better', '1931', 'nice', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'lose', 'way', 'when', 'come', 'money', 'go', 'trip', 'world', 'course', 'hard', 'times', 'crop', 'up', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'roots', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'how', 'good', 'films', 'are', 'reading', 'books', 'wonder', 'authors', 'Hitchcock', 'fan', 'books', 'had', 'seen', 'doubt', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'masterpieces', 'tell', 'essential', 'story', 'Hitchcock', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'good', 'films']",N/A

If you have any of the many public domain copies of these films floating around, you'll be impressed by the difference.Why 3 stars then? Because two scenes near the end of MURDER are inexplicably MISSING!!!***SPOILER ALERT***Do not continue reading if you havent yet seen the film!!!After the killer hangs himself, there is a scene showing his body being carried off, and the circus people crying over it. A man declares that his neck has been broken, and Herbert Marshall is handed a note that was on the killer's person. It then cuts to Marshall reading the note, basically an admission of guilt and description of how the murder was carried out.In this restored version the scene is deleted- it cuts from the pandemonium resulting from the killer's suicide straight to Marshall reading the note.This is somewhat incidental, but the next deletion makes no sense.In the original film the next scene after Marshall reads the note has him riding away from prison with the actress who had been wrongly convicted of the murder. She is crying, and Marshall says something to the effect of ""don't waste your tears. They can be used in my next play"". (sorry i can't remember the line verbatim, but that's the gist of it). It then cuts to her triumphant final scene in a play, with the audience applauding.That scene is missing too! In this restored version it cuts from Marshall at the circus, reading the note, straight to that moment of the play ending and the audience applauding.While it's probably a grand total of 2 minutes deleted, their omission disrupts the continuity of the denoument.This may seem like splitting hairs, but to any real Hitchcock fan it's unforgivable!",3,"Excellent Restoration, but...",1328486400,"02 6, 2012",2012,1727,"['Early', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'given', 'admirable', 'restoration', 'have', 'many', 'public', 'domain', 'copies', 'films', 'floating', 'around', ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed', 'difference.Why', '3', 'stars', 'then', 'two', 'scenes', 'end', 'MURDER', 'are', 'inexplicably', 'MISSING', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***Do', 'not', 'continue', 'reading', 'havent', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'killer', 'scene', 'showing', 'body', 'being', 'carried', 'circus', 'people', 'crying', 'man', 'neck', 'been', 'broken', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'handed', 'note', 'was', 'killer', 'person', 'then', 'Marshall', 'reading', 'note', 'basically', 'admission', 'guilt', 'description', 'how', 'murder', 'was', 'carried', 'restored', 'version', 'scene', 'deleted-', 'pandemonium', 'resulting', 'killer', 'suicide', 'straight', 'Marshall', 'reading', 'note.This', 'somewhat', 'incidental', 'next', 'deletion', 'sense.In', 'original', 'film', 'next', 'scene', 'Marshall', 'note', 'riding', 'away', 'prison', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'murder', 'crying', 'Marshall', 'something', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'tears', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'next', 'play', 'sorry', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'line', 'verbatim', 'gist', 'then', 'triumphant', 'final', 'scene', 'play', 'audience', 'scene', 'missing', 'too', 'restored', 'version', 'Marshall', 'circus', 'reading', 'note', 'straight', 'moment', 'play', 'ending', 'audience', 'probably', 'grand', 'total', '2', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'omission', 'continuity', 'denoument.This', 'may', 'seem', 'splitting', 'hairs', 'real', 'Hitchcock', 'fan', 'unforgivable']",N/A

The U.K. Studio Canal 35mm Masters are here, professionally released with little artifacting by Lions Gate!I would have given this DVD box set 5 stars except that 1) These are not Hitchcock classics, they are good examples of his early work but they are no Psycho, 2) While mastered from 35mm, they did not get the Criterion treatment of removing scratches & dirt specks.  Still this is a great improvement over previous releases of these titles.  I only wish ""NUMBER 17"" was in this set, that early classic deserves the Studio Canal treatment.This set features a mix of silent films & early sound British films.  There is also a nice 15 minute bonus on disc 3 that explains the difficulties of filming sound films in 1930 and how Hitchcock got around the problems.Disc #1 : Two Silent Films""THE RING"" (1927) - Two boxers fall in love with a girl named Nellie. Very visual, early signs of Hitchcock's style.""MANXMAN""  (1929) - Hitchcock's last silent film! A Love story about two fishermen & a landlord's daughter.Disc #2 : Two early sound films""MURDER""  (1930) - the 104 minute U.K. version, good suspence drama.  A jurer re-thinks his verdict and investigates the crime himself.""SKIN GAME""  (1931) - Based on a John Galsworthy play, a little stagy. A traditional family battles a (then) modern family over land.  Not as racey as the title would suggest.Disc #3 : One more ""talkie"" and a bonus feature""RICH AND STANGE""  (1931) - Unexpected riches don't bring happiness for a married couple.  A tale with a moral.""THE HITCHCOCK WAY""  (2007)  - 15 minute documentary interviewing Alfred's daughter and surviving crew members as well as film historians.

1034678,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000KJU12S,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[29, 29]","First the good news--we get a solid transfers of early Hitchcock with some minor and major classics early in his career. Studio Canal has done a nice job with these and while the transfers aren't scratch free, they look quite good given the age of the source material and quite a bit better than some of the earlier releases of public domain sources. This boxed set (once you open it) looks like an old bound copy of a script. The outside has a photo of Hitch (which reminds me of a deathmask)from the Universal archive.The first two films in the set ""The Ring"" and ""The Manxman"" were made the year after the success of ""The Lodger"" (which would been shelved when studio executives thought it a disaster. Luckily, Michael Balcon stepped in a man who championed Hitch early in his career and the film was a wild success). ""Murder!"" is an early talkie (sadly the German version isn't included. It would have been nice to see for comparison sake as it was shot with a different cast on the same sets).  In the early days of film alternate versions were shot for other markets where they might be popular usually with a different director. Hitch spoke German since he worked early on in that country shooting films and absorbing much of the early German expressionist styles that he would reference throughout his career)so directed it himself. ""The Skin Game"" and ""Rich and Strange"" (the latter an early Hitchcock classic) are also included. A pity that ""Blackmail"" (Hitch's first talkie that was also shot to be shown as a silent film) isn't included as well.The bad news is that we don't get any feature length commentary tracks by Hitchcock historians and film scholars (which is just as well if these things bore you). We do, however, get a new 15 minute featurette focusing on Hitchcock's early life, his collaboration with his wife Alma (who is often overlooked--we must remember that it was team Hitchcock collaborating which consisted of Hitch, his wife Alma and whomever their current favorite writer was)and the development of his early style. It features interviews with USC Hitchcock Professor Drew Casper, director Peter Bogdanovich, Hitch's daughter and screenwriter/film historian Steve Haberman. We have a generous amount of clips from the set illustrating their points. I do wish that ""The Lodger"" had been included in this set but that's a pretty minor point (although honestly it does belong here as an example of his developing sense of style). Also missing is Hitch's ""Number 17"" which would have been a natural to include in this set even though the plot is a bit confusing, it's a fun ride.This is an excellent collection of early minor classics as Hitch developed his film style. It's clear that he was influenced by seeing other directors such as Fritz Lang and FW Murnau but he had already begun to develop his own distinctive voice as a film director. This is a good set to get and is a pretty inexpense handsome package for fans.",4,"Hitch finds his ""voice""",1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,2954,"['First', 'good', 'news', 'get', 'solid', 'transfers', 'early', 'Hitchcock', 'minor', 'major', 'classics', 'early', 'career', 'Studio', 'Canal', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'transfers', 'are', ""n't"", 'scratch', 'free', 'look', 'quite', 'good', 'given', 'age', 'source', 'material', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'earlier', 'releases', 'public', 'domain', 'sources', 'boxed', 'set', 'open', 'old', 'bound', 'copy', 'script', 'outside', 'photo', 'Hitch', 'deathmask', 'Universal', 'archive.The', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'set', 'Ring', 'Manxman', 'were', 'made', 'year', 'success', 'Lodger', 'would', 'been', 'shelved', 'when', 'studio', 'executives', 'thought', 'disaster', 'Luckily', 'Michael', 'Balcon', 'stepped', 'man', 'who', 'championed', 'Hitch', 'early', 'career', 'film', 'was', 'wild', 'success', 'Murder', 'early', 'talkie', 'sadly', 'German', 'version', ""n't"", 'included', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'comparison', 'sake', 'was', 'shot', 'different', 'cast', 'same', 'sets', 'early', 'days', 'film', 'alternate', 'versions', 'were', 'shot', 'other', 'markets', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'popular', 'usually', 'different', 'director', 'Hitch', 'spoke', 'German', 'worked', 'early', 'country', 'shooting', 'films', 'absorbing', 'much', 'early', 'German', 'expressionist', 'styles', 'would', 'reference', 'career', 'so', 'directed', 'Skin', 'Game', 'Rich', 'Strange', 'latter', 'early', 'Hitchcock', 'classic', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'pity', 'Blackmail', 'Hitch', 'first', 'talkie', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'be', 'shown', 'silent', 'film', ""n't"", 'included', 'well.The', 'bad', 'news', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Hitchcock', 'historians', 'film', 'scholars', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'things', 'do', 'however', 'get', 'new', '15', 'minute', 'featurette', 'focusing', 'Hitchcock', 'early', 'life', 'collaboration', 'wife', 'Alma', 'who', 'often', 'overlooked', 'must', 'remember', 'was', 'team', 'Hitchcock', 'collaborating', 'consisted', 'Hitch', 'wife', 'Alma', 'whomever', 'current', 'favorite', 'writer', 'was', 'development', 'early', 'style', 'interviews', 'USC', 'Hitchcock', 'Professor', 'Drew', 'Casper', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Hitch', 'daughter', 'screenwriter/film', 'historian', 'Steve', 'Haberman', 'have', 'generous', 'amount', 'clips', 'set', 'illustrating', 'points', 'do', 'wish', 'Lodger', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'set', 'pretty', 'minor', 'point', 'honestly', 'belong', 'here', 'example', 'developing', 'sense', 'style', 'Also', 'missing', 'Hitch', 'Number', '17', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'natural', 'include', 'set', 'even', 'plot', 'bit', 'confusing', 'fun', 'ride.This', 'excellent', 'collection', 'early', 'minor', 'classics', 'Hitch', 'developed', 'film', 'style', 'clear', 'was', 'influenced', 'seeing', 'other', 'directors', 'such', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'FW', 'Murnau', 'had', 'already', 'begun', 'develop', 'own', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'film', 'director', 'good', 'set', 'get', 'pretty', 'inexpense', 'handsome', 'package', 'fans']",N/A
