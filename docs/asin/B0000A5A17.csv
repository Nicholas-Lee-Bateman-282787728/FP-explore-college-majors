The cast are outstanding, the costumes and decor beautiful, and the pacing of the novel just right.  I cannot believe this was made nearly 40 years ago.  Nicola Pagett IS Anna Karenina--an incredible actress.Probably because of the massive size of the book, and the usual 2 hour time span of most singular movies, other AK's do not portray all of the many subthemes and characters in the book.  This series does do this but does so in a very smooth, well conceived manor.All in all, this is a very well acted series that will delight you all the way.",5,delightful,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,682,"['rented', 'entire', 'series', 'Amazon', 'hope', 'buy', 'now', 'What', 'delight', 'series', 'truly', 'book', 'life', 'cast', 'are', 'outstanding', 'costumes', 'decor', 'beautiful', 'pacing', 'novel', 'just', 'right', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'made', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'Nicola', 'Pagett', 'IS', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'incredible', 'actress.Probably', 'massive', 'size', 'book', 'usual', '2', 'hour', 'time', 'span', 'most', 'singular', 'movies', 'other', 'AK', 'do', 'not', 'portray', 'many', 'subthemes', 'characters', 'book', 'series', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'smooth', 'well', 'conceived', 'manor.All', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'series', 'will', 'delight', 'way']",N/A
761765,A3MBO6T1HAQJ0Y,B0000A5A17,anon-e-mous,"[0, 1]","I just finished reading Anna Karenina and was looking forward to this particular mini-series' version...alas..i  could not watch beyond the fifth episode. For the most part, this adaptation is somewhat faithful....well...i can only vouch for the 5 episodes i tolerated. My biggest complaint is  that it appears the producer and screenwriter so badly want to justify Anna's adultery that they veer away from Tolstoy's characterization. They romanticize and exalt Anna to an unimpeachable pedestal, but reduce Alexei Karenin to an odious angry man. Alexei Karenin, is a far more complex character than what this series portrays. The couple is obviously mismatched, Anna is young and vivacious while he is older,orthodox and set in his ways. Even though they are mismatched, Alexei is not a horrible husband. He is undemonstrative, conservative and uses irony to mask a sensitive, insecure and socially awkward man. Inspite of his shortcomings, he loves and respects his wife. His love for her becomes quite obvious when inspite of  his misery, his feelings towards Anna remain magnanimous. A lesser man would have given the divorce lawyer carte blanche to destroy Anna, a lesser man would have let Anna and Vronsky's daughter die....what does Alexei do?... on the question of divorce he worries about hurting her social standing. What does he do with the baby when Anna is too sick to care for her?....he cares for her. Tolstoy takes great pains to demonstrate the devastation and wretchedness Anna's affair wreaks on Karenin's heart. Tolstoy's Karenin was so averse to violence that no matter how much Anna irked him, he would never have come close to attempting to hit her....as he does in this series.Another point of departure from Tolstoy's story is the attempt to legitimize Anna's adultery by creating a faux social circle that includes Vronsky's brother's wife. The producer goes to great pains to create the impression that Vronsky's mother and sister-in-law not only approved, but were supportive of the relationship. Nothing could be further from the truth, in actual fact, Vronsky's sister-in-law refused to associate with Anna because she wanted to keep her own daughters as far from the scandal as possible. Vronsky's mother  hates Anna because she has ruined his prospects. Tolstoy does not romanticize the relationship between Anna and Vronsky, he invests most of his time exploring the consequences of such a union as realistically as possible....Vronsky is able to move through society relatively unscathed but Anna becomes a social pariah. Society bears down on Anna and eventually crushes the life out of her.",3,Somewhat okay.....Tolstoy purists should watch with a pinch of salt,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2627,"['just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'particular', 'mini-series', 'version', 'alas..i', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'fifth', 'episode', 'most', 'part', 'adaptation', 'somewhat', 'faithful', '.well', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'vouch', '5', 'episodes', 'i', 'tolerated', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'producer', 'screenwriter', 'so', 'badly', 'want', 'justify', 'Anna', 'adultery', 'veer', 'away', 'Tolstoy', 'characterization', 'romanticize', 'exalt', 'Anna', 'unimpeachable', 'pedestal', 'reduce', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'odious', 'angry', 'man', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'character', 'what', 'series', 'couple', 'obviously', 'mismatched', 'Anna', 'young', 'vivacious', 'older', 'orthodox', 'set', 'ways', 'Even', 'are', 'mismatched', 'Alexei', 'not', 'horrible', 'husband', 'undemonstrative', 'conservative', 'irony', 'mask', 'sensitive', 'insecure', 'socially', 'awkward', 'man', 'Inspite', 'shortcomings', 'wife', 'love', 'becomes', 'quite', 'obvious', 'when', 'inspite', 'misery', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Anna', 'remain', 'magnanimous', 'lesser', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'carte', 'blanche', 'destroy', 'Anna', 'lesser', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'daughter', 'die', 'Alexei', 'do', 'question', 'divorce', 'hurting', 'social', 'standing', 'What', 'do', 'baby', 'when', 'Anna', 'too', 'sick', 'care', '.he', 'cares', 'Tolstoy', 'great', 'pains', 'demonstrate', 'devastation', 'wretchedness', 'Anna', 'affair', 'wreaks', 'Karenin', 'heart', 'Tolstoy', 'Karenin', 'was', 'so', 'averse', 'violence', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'Anna', 'irked', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'attempting', 'hit', '.as', 'series.Another', 'point', 'departure', 'Tolstoy', 'story', 'attempt', 'legitimize', 'Anna', 'adultery', 'creating', 'faux', 'social', 'circle', 'Vronsky', 'brother', 'wife', 'producer', 'great', 'pains', 'create', 'impression', 'Vronsky', 'mother', 'sister-in-law', 'not', 'only', 'approved', 'were', 'supportive', 'relationship', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'actual', 'fact', 'Vronsky', 'sister-in-law', 'refused', 'associate', 'Anna', 'wanted', 'keep', 'own', 'daughters', 'far', 'scandal', 'possible', 'Vronsky', 'mother', 'Anna', 'ruined', 'prospects', 'Tolstoy', 'not', 'romanticize', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'most', 'time', 'exploring', 'consequences', 'such', 'union', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', '.Vronsky', 'able', 'move', 'society', 'relatively', 'unscathed', 'Anna', 'social', 'pariah', 'Society', 'down', 'Anna', 'eventually', 'life']",N/A

761767,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B0000A5A17,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[4, 6]","I didn't read the book yet. So I can't make a comparison.But that said, the movie may be 10 hours, but it is NEVER boring.It's basically this. Anna Karenina (who is married with one son) goes to her brother's house to see if she can save his broken marriage with Dolly. While she is there, she manages to save her brother's marriage. But soon afterwards, she (without meaning to do so) breaks Kitty's (Dolly's sister) engagement to Vronsky, because Vronsky finds Anna attractive.We then meet Anna's husband. He is nice enough, but we can see that he is more like a kind father to Anna than a husband. Though if we look at the whole picture, we can see that Anna really has it well. (Beautiful house, clothes, servants, a kind intelligent older husband, a son who adores her, and a fine reputation.)To make a long movie short, Anna decides that after feeling loved passionately by Vronsky, she is unhappy with her life. Interestingly, her husband (rather than being typically jealous) warns her of consequences if she carries out this affair. And even after she has a child with Vronsky, he is still willing to forgive her. In my opinion, this limits the sympathy we can have for Anna when she constantly refuses her husband's gift of forgiveness. (To say nothing of the fact that while he was hurt, he does NOT want to leave her to the mercy of an affair that may or may not last.)Moving quickly, she has a brief moment of happiness with Vronsky, but she soon finds out that in taking this relationship with Vronsky, she has lost her son, not to mention her reputation. And while we want to feel sorry for her, we can't deny that (1) her husband warned her, and (2) she did it to herself.But whether we are on Anna's side or the side of her husband, the movie is phenomenal in the tragic puzzle that comes together so logically.It is worth noting that while the movie does not mention it, Anna may very well be bipolar. She reacts to reason with cruelty first to her husband, and later to Vronsky. While Vronsky was not so likable in the first 9/10 of the movie, we start to feel some sympathy for him in the last 10th when he can't even talk to Anna without her reacting with cruelty.It is not long before her relationship with Vronsky deteriorates. (She can't even sleep OR JUST BE WITH the man she threw everything away for, and she finds herself in a worse position than she has ever been in with no visible exit. (Or perhaps, just one.)Perhaps the moral of this story is that in striving for ALL, we can LOSE the great things that we DID have.I could go on and on about the scenery, the supporting characters, etc. But then this review would be way too long.I'll just say that even though this film is 10 hours, it is NEVER boring.

The protagonist, Anna, played by Nicola Pagett, is a very young and beautiful woman, married to a man much older than her. Not sure why they chose to marry, but you can tell that she is not in love with her husband but feels secure about the life his position and wealth offer.Her husband, played by Eric Porter, Mr. Karenin is a powerful man, involved in politics, astute, methodical, and willing to live life without passion, at times giving the impression that he is numb to feelings.They have a young child, who fills the voids in her mother and they are very attached. On a yourney that starts the movie, Anna meets an older woman and strikes a rather interesting conversation, but one that opens her heart to the older woman, who happens to be the mother of Count Vronsky, played by Stuart Wilson.When they arrive at the station, they meet, and the Count is captivated by Anna's beauty, but even more, by the fact that his mother seems to be admirous of the young woman. Anna feels the heat of the passion written in the young, dashing soldier's eyes... and the spark is ignited. In time, Anna risks it all for the pursuit of true love, but guilt, remorse, and an astute husband that plays the cards to make sure she never gets what she wants, initiate the down-fall of this woman. The consequences of poor choices are painful to watch, but excellent to prepare two young women about to start lives of their own.Sometimes we must ask ourselves... who do I want to have been... to make choices that ensure you get there... safe and sound of mind.  Highly recommend watching this series, but make sure you allow the necessary give and take to gain insight and growth.",5,"A tale of love, marriage, guilt and consequences",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,2087,"['effort', 'develop', 'assist', 'maturity', 'process', 'two', 'teenagers', 'obtained', 'classic', 'timeless', 'issues', 'love', 'heartache', 'marriage', 'loyalty', 'separation', 'pain', 'guilt', 'unfortunately', 'ending', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'times', 'thoughtless', 'actions.The', 'plot', 'set', '19th-century', 'Russia', 'families', 'selected', 'amazing', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'part', 'aristocracy', 'protagonist', 'Anna', 'played', 'Nicola', 'Pagett', 'very', 'young', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'married', 'man', 'much', 'older', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'chose', 'marry', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'love', 'husband', 'feels', 'secure', 'life', 'position', 'wealth', 'offer.Her', 'husband', 'played', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Mr.', 'Karenin', 'powerful', 'man', 'involved', 'politics', 'astute', 'methodical', 'willing', 'live', 'life', 'passion', 'times', 'giving', 'impression', 'numb', 'feelings.They', 'have', 'young', 'child', 'who', 'voids', 'mother', 'are', 'very', 'attached', 'yourney', 'movie', 'Anna', 'older', 'woman', 'strikes', 'rather', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'one', 'heart', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'mother', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Wilson.When', 'arrive', 'station', 'meet', 'Count', 'captivated', 'Anna', 'beauty', 'even', 'more', 'fact', 'mother', 'be', 'admirous', 'young', 'woman', 'Anna', 'heat', 'passion', 'written', 'young', 'dashing', 'soldier', 'eyes', 'spark', 'ignited', 'time', 'Anna', 'pursuit', 'true', 'love', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'astute', 'husband', 'cards', 'make', 'sure', 'never', 'what', 'initiate', 'down-fall', 'woman', 'consequences', 'poor', 'choices', 'are', 'painful', 'watch', 'excellent', 'prepare', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'start', 'lives', 'own.Sometimes', 'must', 'ask', 'who', 'do', 'want', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'choices', 'ensure', 'get', 'safe', 'sound', 'mind', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'series', 'make', 'sure', 'allow', 'necessary', 'give', 'take', 'gain', 'insight', 'growth']",N/A

SIMPSON and so forth...i could go on and on. i have made up my mind to collect as many of these programs as possible on dvd.this version of 'anna karenina' does not disappoint. at nearly 10 HOURS, 'anna' is a rich tapestry of incredible, intricate writing, and the characterizations are spot on... every twist and turn of anna's psyche is well explored, so now, as she slowly makes her way to her final fate, each action makes perfect sense to me.... the acting itself is stunning....nicola pagett (electrifying!) as anna, eric porter as karenin, and stuart wilson as vronsky each give sterling, bravura performances... in every episode there is at least one passage of jaw-dropping acting from these three.... this time, i really felt for the plight of EACH of these characters.and for those who might think the production itself looks cheesy, i would say: just shift your focus...these programs should not be compared to modern films.... think of each of these bbc productions from that peroid as A PLAY STAGED FOR TELEVISION....relax, and immerse yourself in the excellent acting and superlative writing. a gratifying experience.",5,EXCELLENT!!,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,3059,"['favorite', 'greta', 'garbo', 'performance', 'always', 'been', ""'anna"", 'karenina', '1935.', 'amazing', 'typical', 'la', 'garbo', 'many', 'characterizations', 'women', 'walking', 'FIRES', 'OF', 'HELL', 'love', 'such', 'grand', 'passion', 'i', 'love', 'film', 'i', ""'ve"", 'also', 'realized', 'MGM', 'production', 'EXTREMELY', 'streamlined', 'version', 'tolstoy', 'epic', 'novel', 'i', 'have', 'always', 'kept', 'lookout', 'more', 'full-bodied', 'version', ""'anna"", 'comparison.i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'vivien', 'leigh', '1948', 'version', 'jacqueline', 'bisset', '1985', '3', 'hour', 'tv', 'version', '4', 'hour', 'bbc', 'miniseries', '2000', 'even', 'sophie', 'marceau', '1997', 'film', 'version', '.but', 'somehow', 'when', 'watching', 'different', 'versions', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'connect', 'have', 'sympathy', 'character', ""'anna"", '.even', 'actresses', 'versions', 'were', 'first', 'rate.i', 'finally', 'came', 'conclusion', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'actresses', 'fault', 'was', 'writing', 'two-hour', 'film', 'four-hour', 'miniseries', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'be', 'faithful', 'COMPLETE', 'tolstoy', 'novel', 'develop', 'characters', 'deeply', 'enough.the', 'anna', 'near-deadly', 'illness', 'changes', 'so', 'quickly', 'such', 'different', 'woman', 'latter', 'half', 'story', 'unbalanced', 'highly', 'delusional', 'gone', 'garbo', 'sublime', 'descent', 'madness', 'film', 'replicated', 'also', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'storyline', 'somehow.however', 'when', 'i', 'became', 'aware', '1977', 'bbc', 'miniseries', ""'anna"", 'karenina', 'i', 'immediately', 'bought', 'sight', 'unseen', '1970', 'bbc', 'television', 'adaptions', 'history', 'literary', 'works', 'are', 'just', 'unequalled', 'terms', 'peerless', 'writing', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'sheer', 'greatness', 'was', 'really', ""'golden"", 'age', 'television', 'back', 'then', 'just', 'american', 'cinema', '1970', 'considered', 'great', ""'golden"", 'age', 'film.ELIZABETH', 'R', 'SIX', 'WIVES', 'OF', 'HENRY', 'VIII', 'CLAUDIUS', 'UPSTAIRS', 'DOWNSTAIRS', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'LILLIE', 'THE', 'CHARMER', 'EDWARD', 'AND', 'MRS.', 'SIMPSON', 'so', 'forth', 'i', 'could', 'go', 'i', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'collect', 'many', 'programs', 'possible', 'dvd.this', 'version', ""'anna"", 'karenina', 'not', 'disappoint', 'nearly', '10', 'HOURS', ""'anna"", 'rich', 'tapestry', 'incredible', 'intricate', 'writing', 'characterizations', 'are', 'spot', 'twist', 'turn', 'anna', 'psyche', 'well', 'explored', 'so', 'now', 'slowly', 'way', 'final', 'fate', 'action', 'perfect', 'sense', 'acting', 'stunning', '.nicola', 'pagett', 'electrifying', 'anna', 'eric', 'porter', 'karenin', 'stuart', 'wilson', 'vronsky', 'give', 'sterling', 'bravura', 'performances', 'episode', 'least', 'one', 'passage', 'jaw-dropping', 'acting', 'three', 'time', 'i', 'really', 'felt', 'plight', 'EACH', 'characters.and', 'who', 'might', 'think', 'production', 'cheesy', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'just', 'shift', 'focus', 'programs', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'modern', 'films', 'think', 'bbc', 'productions', 'peroid', 'A', 'PLAY', 'STAGED', 'FOR', 'TELEVISION', '.relax', 'immerse', 'excellent', 'acting', 'superlative', 'writing', 'gratifying', 'experience']",N/A

The interiors, the mode of life and even the way the actors speak is as close as anything has come to the times.  The uniforms are incredible because they had a special consultant who made sure they were right; when Vronsky appears wearing the uniform of the Preobrajensky Regiment he has the right one - even down to one appropriate to the time of day and season.  I have to say that Stuart Wilson does an amazing job as Vronsky - no one has come within a hundred miles of his presentation of the role.

Otherwise this miniseries is a waste of time and entirely aggravating to boot.Tolstoy's great character ""Anna Karenina"" is reduced to a porcelain skinned bubble head in this film. Anna as played by Nicola Pagett just doesn't do justice to the original character who is supposed to exemplify all things seductive and selfish and remain aloofly beautiful despite all her faults, Pagett comes across as falsely attractive and lacking in any seductive ability whatsoever. But she is forced to work with Stuart Wilson as Vronsky and he is even worse! Looking like a tenor from a barbershop quartet and acting almost as atrociously Wilson shames Tolstoy's character beyond words. Vronsky is an expert horseman but watching Wilson attempt to ride around Anna's carriage in one scene is almost comical, he could have used the glue on his fake mustache to hold himself in the saddle a bit better!Some of the actors in this series pulled off their parts well: Eric Porter as Karenin, Caroline Langrishe as Kitty, Robert Swann as Levin (minus the fake beard!) and a few others. The scenery is gaudy and paper-like with doors that shut and almost fall apart. The costumes are often beautiful, especially the ones worn by ""Anna Karenina"". The film itself is exactly like a daytime soap opera and tends to make the entire production quite cheap and unattractive. More effort should have been paid to this miniseries in all aspects in my opinion. Thankfully the storyline followed Tolstoy's almost to a tee so for anyone looking to place a dramatic interpretation on the classic novel it will be interesting to watch. But I have to say that at the end of 3 hours I was ready to see Anna's end so that I could put an end to my own suffering. Sadly the best part of the novel, Levin's search for faith, is not covered very well.
