There are some lovely performances from Margot in it that are a must see.  That being said the movie itself is cr*p!  Horrible movie, inaccurate in conjunction to previous biographies, gratuitous sex scenes that make her look like a tart, poor acting, little to no dancing and I was literally embarassed to be watching it with my mother in law. In the end I threw away the movie and kept the extra dvd.",2,Mixed Feelings,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,503,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'extra', 'dvd', 'fabulous', 'purchase', 'are', 'lovely', 'performances', 'Margot', 'are', 'must', 'see', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'cr*p', 'Horrible', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'conjunction', 'previous', 'biographies', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'make', 'look', 'tart', 'poor', 'acting', 'little', 'dancing', 'was', 'literally', 'embarassed', 'be', 'watching', 'mother', 'law', 'end', 'threw', 'away', 'movie', 'kept', 'extra', 'dvd']",N/A
1353840,A1ORZKYPMHLRUC,B003LY66PU,Jancal,"[1, 1]","The first DVD in this 2-pack is ""Margot"" a BBC TV movie starring Anne Marie Duff, who played the part with nervous histrionics that contrasts with the reserved Fonteyn, so between that and her appearance which bears no resemblance at all to the ballerina (though the dancer stand-in had a similar body to the real woman), it was not believable and I could not get swept up in the story.  The second DVD is the fantastic ""Royal Ballet"" film by Czinner, which is 3 different ballet acts all performed by Fonteyn and her partner Michael Somes.  Seeing Fonteyn play Odette in Swan Lake is a revelation, her movements truly swan-like with fluttering bird's arms, head tucking in and out, and very quick beating knee kicks, a marvel of dance-acting.  I'm not a big Firebird fan though again, she has the bird movements down, but Ondine is a unique and lovely ballet shown in entire 3 acts, in which Fonteyn again totally embodies the character of the innocent water sprite, and her shadow dance solo is just lovely.  A Fonteyn ballet collection to be treasured.",4,"Movie bio disappointing, ballet DVD sublime",1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1055,"['first', 'DVD', '2-pack', 'Margot', 'BBC', 'TV', 'movie', 'starring', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Duff', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'nervous', 'histrionics', 'reserved', 'Fonteyn', 'so', 'appearance', 'resemblance', 'ballerina', 'dancer', 'stand-in', 'had', 'similar', 'body', 'real', 'woman', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'story', 'second', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'film', 'Czinner', '3', 'different', 'ballet', 'performed', 'Fonteyn', 'partner', 'Michael', 'Somes', 'Seeing', 'Fonteyn', 'play', 'Odette', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'revelation', 'movements', 'truly', 'swan-like', 'fluttering', 'bird', 'arms', 'head', 'tucking', 'very', 'quick', 'beating', 'knee', 'kicks', 'marvel', 'dance-acting', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Firebird', 'fan', 'though', 'again', 'bird', 'movements', 'down', 'Ondine', 'unique', 'lovely', 'ballet', 'shown', 'entire', '3', 'acts', 'Fonteyn', 'again', 'totally', 'character', 'innocent', 'water', 'sprite', 'shadow', 'dance', 'solo', 'just', 'lovely', 'Fonteyn', 'ballet', 'collection', 'be', 'treasured']",N/A

1353842,A1XYKO38JK6N8K,B003LY66PU,northkona,"[4, 4]","The biopic isn't very exciting, maybe even a little embarrassing, but I noticed that much of the dialog is taken from Meredith Daneman's very good biography of Fonteyn.  If you read it and Julie Kavanagh's biography of Rudolf, you will know as much as there is to know about these iconic dancers, personally and professionally.  I actually read both of those books twice because Kavanagh's led me to Daneman's, and that made me want to read the Rudolf bio again, etc.  Time well spent, too.The best part of this pair of DVD's is the bonus disk featuring Fonteyn in segments from three ballets.  My favorite is Ondine.  For a terrific review of the ballets on the bonus disk, I recommend Ivy Lin's review.  In fact, read all her ballet DVD reviews, you can learn a lot from them and be guided to some other DVD's you might like to add to your collection.
