It is an excellent snapshot of the British life during the period - the class struggles, the shifting economy and the demands placed upon family members.

393203,AJQV1GCU92BUY,6303965415,Acacia Manning,"[15, 18]","As i began this movie, i was disappointed. The main actress did not have the beautious presence of the protagonists in the adaptations of Mansfield Park, Emma, or the A&E Pride & Prejudice. The sets were not particularly vibrant, and the characters were, well, normal people. However as the movie progressed, i became impressed against my own first impression. Amanda Root brings forth the spellbinding silence and oppression of intelligent, regretful young ladies, with smaller claims to youth and beauty than others. Her pain is so tangible, and her loneliness so palpable, you can't help but feel for the accomplished and overlooked Anne. Like Sense and Sensibilities Colonel Brandon, in Willoughby's words, she is ""the man (in this case woman) that everyone speaks well of, but no one remembers to talk to"". As the film progresses she seems to become prettier and livelier, and her repression begins to lift, and you see her true geniality and open-heartedness. As for Ciaran Hinds...well, not only is he handsome, but he plays his part with such feeling and passion that you can't help but wait in anticipation for the inevitably happy conclusion. Both parts are semi-stereotypical...Anne, who mistakenly turned down her true love due to the faulty advice of her friend, pines and diminishes, becoming quiet and somber in near self-induced solitude. Wentworth, being the man, seeks occupation overseas and tries to forget her. He can't, however he is less forgiving, being the one spurned so many years ago, and you spend half the movie agonizing over his attentions to the unaccomplished, flirtatios, more beautiful Louisa. All in all, a good watch, with the feeling and sad repression of true love that makes Austen amazing. Anne and Wentworth are not as funny as Darcy and Elizabeth, but instead are reminiscent of the sensible, quiet adoration of such characters as Elinor and Colonel Brandon...not ostentatious, not overly flirtatious, but sensible and sad and loving and repressed. I loved it...in fact, i'm going to go turn it on right now.",5,well...an interesting movie,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,2052,"['i', 'began', 'movie', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'main', 'actress', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'beautious', 'presence', 'protagonists', 'adaptations', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'Emma', 'A', 'E', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'sets', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'vibrant', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'normal', 'people', 'However', 'movie', 'progressed', 'i', 'became', 'impressed', 'own', 'first', 'impression', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'forth', 'spellbinding', 'silence', 'oppression', 'intelligent', 'regretful', 'young', 'ladies', 'smaller', 'claims', 'youth', 'beauty', 'others', 'pain', 'so', 'tangible', 'loneliness', 'so', 'palpable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'accomplished', 'overlooked', 'Anne', 'Sense', 'Sensibilities', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'Willoughby', 'words', 'man', 'case', 'woman', 'everyone', 'well', 'one', 'talk', 'film', 'become', 'prettier', 'livelier', 'repression', 'lift', 'see', 'true', 'geniality', 'open-heartedness', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'handsome', 'part', 'such', 'feeling', 'passion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wait', 'anticipation', 'inevitably', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'parts', 'are', 'semi-stereotypical', 'Anne', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'turned', 'down', 'true', 'love', 'due', 'faulty', 'advice', 'friend', 'pines', 'diminishes', 'becoming', 'quiet', 'somber', 'near', 'self-induced', 'solitude', 'Wentworth', 'being', 'man', 'occupation', 'overseas', 'tries', 'forget', 'ca', ""n't"", 'however', 'less', 'forgiving', 'being', 'one', 'spurned', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'spend', 'movie', 'agonizing', 'attentions', 'unaccomplished', 'flirtatios', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Louisa', 'good', 'watch', 'feeling', 'sad', 'repression', 'true', 'love', 'Austen', 'amazing', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'instead', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'sensible', 'quiet', 'adoration', 'such', 'characters', 'Elinor', 'Colonel', 'Brandon', 'not', 'ostentatious', 'not', 'overly', 'flirtatious', 'sensible', 'sad', 'loving', 'repressed', 'loved', 'fact', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'turn', 'right', 'now']",Persuasion VHS
393204,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,6303965415,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[781, 800]","Jane Austen wrote PERSUASION towards the end of her life, while in her final illness. Thus an atmosphere of bending weariness and quiet resignation pervades this tender romance, infused within provincial life in Regency England, swaying against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. I could not help but love this BBC film version unconditionally, so deftly are the gentle qualities of the novel brought forth.As with her earlier novel, MANSFIELD PARK, Austen filled this story with subdued satire - intertwining a comedy of genteel manners with the unassailable decrees of the human heart. This is the story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root): a single woman in her late 20's who, eight years previous, on the counsel of her patroness and late mother's friend, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood-who sadly died of cancer shortly after this film was made), had refused an offer of marriage from her true love, Captain Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds) on the grounds of his poor financial prospects.Captain Wentworth returns to Anne's rather confined realm of society when his sister, Mrs. Croft, and her husband, an Admiral in the Navy (John Woodvine, of 1992's WUTHERING HEIGHTS) lease Anne's baronet father's estate, Kellynch Hall. Before she can join her father and elder sister Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls) in Bath, she must first spend a few weeks with her hypochondriac younger sister Mary, whose husband Charles' family, the Musgroves - parents Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, and two younger sisters, Henrietta and Louisa - reside nearby. It is here that Anne becomes re-acquainted with her long-lost love, who's by now an advantageous match for any young woman, having made his prize fortune during the war. Wentworth initially fancies himself ""a lost man"" to the first attractive young lady who bestows upon him her ""compliments to the Navy."" To all appearances, Louisa Musgrove is that very lady...Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, even though they lack the physical beauty distinctive in other Austen adaptations, express the gamut of suppressed emotions most flawlessly here. Ms. Root conjures all the feelings of empathy and affection with every delicate expression she makes. Mr. Hinds, whom I've seen in a number of other roles -including that of an overwrought Mr. Rochester in a 1997 adaptation of JANE EYRE - gives here what's quite likely the best performance of his career. His Wentworth's subtle yet barely suppressed anger hits Anne like a bombshell. The emotion is slow paced and very flowing - but it's nonetheless quite palpable.The entire cast, in fact, gives every cause for high praise -- most notably Corin Redgrave (brother of Lynn and Vanessa) as Anne's vain and spendthrift father, Sir Walter Elliot, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson) as Anne's self-centered younger sister Mary Musgrove, and Fiona Shaw (Mrs. Reed in 1996's JANE EYRE) as the indomitable Mrs. Croft - each are absolutely perfect in their respective roles.Many a time, upon a weekend afternoon, I've placed this tape into my VCR and played it while occupied with various household chores. As ever and as always, this film offers up its many beauties, and they never fail to enchant me: the long walks through the pristine and stately New Forest - the excursions with the Navel men striding proudly along jetties of the shores at Lyme - the atmospheric turns about the drizzly sidewalks, the pump rooms, and the concert halls of Bath. Such are the scenes that eternally soothe a spirit ~",5,"""-Loving Longest When All Hope Is Gone-""",1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,3469,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'PERSUASION', 'end', 'life', 'final', 'illness', 'Thus', 'atmosphere', 'bending', 'weariness', 'quiet', 'resignation', 'tender', 'romance', 'infused', 'provincial', 'life', 'Regency', 'England', 'swaying', 'backdrop', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'love', 'BBC', 'film', 'version', 'unconditionally', 'so', 'deftly', 'are', 'gentle', 'qualities', 'novel', 'brought', 'forth.As', 'earlier', 'novel', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'Austen', 'filled', 'story', 'subdued', 'satire', 'intertwining', 'comedy', 'genteel', 'manners', 'unassailable', 'decrees', 'human', 'heart', 'story', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'single', 'woman', 'late', '20', 'who', 'eight', 'years', 'previous', 'counsel', 'patroness', 'late', 'mother', 'friend', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Susan', 'Fleetwood-who', 'sadly', 'died', 'cancer', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'had', 'refused', 'offer', 'marriage', 'true', 'love', 'Captain', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'grounds', 'poor', 'financial', 'prospects.Captain', 'Wentworth', 'Anne', 'rather', 'confined', 'realm', 'society', 'when', 'sister', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'husband', 'Admiral', 'Navy', 'John', 'Woodvine', '1992', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', 'lease', 'Anne', 'baronet', 'father', 'estate', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'can', 'join', 'father', 'elder', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'Bath', 'must', 'first', 'spend', 'few', 'weeks', 'hypochondriac', 'younger', 'sister', 'Mary', 'husband', 'Charles', 'family', 'Musgroves', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Musgrove', 'two', 'younger', 'sisters', 'Henrietta', 'Louisa', 'reside', 'nearby', 'here', 'Anne', 're-acquainted', 'long-lost', 'love', 'who', 'now', 'advantageous', 'match', 'young', 'woman', 'having', 'made', 'prize', 'fortune', 'war', 'Wentworth', 'initially', 'lost', 'man', 'first', 'attractive', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'compliments', 'Navy', 'appearances', 'Louisa', 'Musgrove', 'very', 'lady', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'even', 'lack', 'physical', 'beauty', 'distinctive', 'other', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'express', 'gamut', 'suppressed', 'emotions', 'most', 'flawlessly', 'here', 'Ms.', 'Root', 'feelings', 'empathy', 'affection', 'delicate', 'expression', 'Mr.', 'Hinds', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'other', 'roles', '-including', 'overwrought', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', '1997', 'adaptation', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'here', 'what', 'quite', 'likely', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'Wentworth', 'subtle', 'yet', 'barely', 'suppressed', 'anger', 'Anne', 'bombshell', 'emotion', 'slow', 'paced', 'very', 'flowing', 'nonetheless', 'quite', 'palpable.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'fact', 'cause', 'high', 'praise', 'most', 'notably', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'brother', 'Lynn', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'vain', 'spendthrift', 'father', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Elliot', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'sister', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Anne', 'self-centered', 'younger', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Musgrove', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'Mrs.', 'Reed', '1996', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'indomitable', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'respective', 'roles.Many', 'time', 'weekend', 'afternoon', ""'ve"", 'placed', 'tape', 'VCR', 'played', 'occupied', 'various', 'household', 'chores', 'ever', 'always', 'film', 'up', 'many', 'beauties', 'never', 'fail', 'enchant', 'long', 'walks', 'pristine', 'stately', 'New', 'Forest', 'excursions', 'Navel', 'men', 'striding', 'proudly', 'jetties', 'shores', 'Lyme', 'atmospheric', 'drizzly', 'sidewalks', 'pump', 'rooms', 'concert', 'halls', 'Bath', 'Such', 'are', 'scenes', 'eternally', 'spirit', '~']",Persuasion VHS

393213,A1EQZQ5BY3TXPG,6303965415,"Amazon Customer ""NoirDame.com""","[126, 132]","My copy of the novel &quot;Persuasion&quot; refers to it as having an &quot;autumnal&quot; tone, which has definitely carried over into this adaptation. It makes no pretensions to being another &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; or &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, lacking those books' underlying theme of warm friendship between sisters. Nor is it like &quot;Emma&quot; or &quot;Northanger Abbey,&quot; both comedies featuring immature women and their self-discovery. In other words, &quot;Persuasion&quot; may be a disappointment to those who passionately love one of those other stories, and expect the same thing. This is ironic, considering that some believe &quot;Persuasion&quot; was based on an incident in Jane Austen's real life, where she apparently turned away a suitor in her youth, and later regretted it.Again - the &quot;autumnal&quot; tone is picked up by the two leads, who are older and less conventionally attractive than, say, Kate Beckingsdale or Jeremy Northam. Ciaran Hinds has a quiet charisma that grows the longer you watch him, and has developed into a viable leading man. Amanda Root begins the film as a grey little mouse and transforms into a more lovely woman halfway through, solely through her skill as an actress, and not through a film of vasoline smeared on the camera.Those who complain that Root is not pretty enough to fit their mental image are missing the point, and probably did not read the book, where Austen points out that Anne's beauty had faded with age. (As we read on, we realize that it's her love for life that's dimmed, which in turn has affected her attractiveness to others. Her handsome father certainly becomes less good-looking each time his prissy behavior is described.)In the film, it would be easy to pull a &quot;Grease&quot;-like transformation - where, like Olivia Newton John, Amanda Root comes out all dolled up in makeup and a hot bodice, ready to jump on the Regency tilt-a-whirl. But the Captain and Anne regain their passion for another through their rediscovery of each other's hearts, not their good looks - although seeing each other's good character instantly brightens their countenance and puts a spring in their step, making them much more attractive. Neither Hinds nor Root need a gallon of makeup to make this transformation believable.The two performances that I enjoyed most, however, were that of Sophie Thompson and Fiona Shaw. Thompson, who was only vaguely boorish in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; as a woman despairing of meeting a quality mate, goes full-hog as a high maintenance mooch. Very funny.Shaw, on the other hand, is one of the funniest things about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movies, as Harry's dreadful aunt. Here, she is positively vibrant as a happy naval wife. She just brims with love and vigor, believable as a woman who has travelled the seas to be with her husband, and who wishes happiness for her younger brother and all around her. Both the character and the portrayal make a fine contrast to Anne's waspish sisters and father, and the overindulgent yet loving Musgroves.

I heard so much praise of it so I was really excited to see it. But we all have different sensibilities and for me, the adaptation didn't manage to reproduce Anne's inner world and the depth of the love between Anne and Wentworth.For me, the beauty of the book relies on the tension between Anne and Wentworth and on the looks that they can't help exchanging despite their long time of separation and despite Wentworth's resentment. Eight years ago, although Anne fell deeply in love with Wentworth, she was persuaded by her father and her deceased mother's friend to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth's lack of fortune. The story starts when Captain Wentworth returns to the country from the war with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They are to meet again unexpectedly as Anne's father, Sir Walter, is a heavy spender and the family has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who are closely related to Wentworth.This love-story is really wonderful as it is all about undying love and about meeting again the person that you fell in love with so many years ago and in the case of Wentworth, meeting the woman you loved but broke your heart by rejecting you...These questions are still relevant today and that is what makes this story so original. Not only, Austen manages to create an incredible tension between Wentworth and Anne but also to describe to the perfection Anne's feelings of sadness, of solitude, of regret, of distress at seeing Wentworth for the first time.But somehow, I didn't see any of that tension in the BBC film or Anne's real suffering. I am sorry to say so but I was not convinced by Amanda Root's performance as Anne Elliot. And it is not merely because she seems a little too old for the part, it is just that her face didn't display any emotion. I am probably shallow, but I need to see on the actress's face that Anne is very much affected by Wentworth's return. Unfortunately, I didn't feel any connections to this Anne. I really couldn't relate to her. I was not overwhelmed by the adaptation. I just watched it but I didn't feel the incredible urge to watch it again as I have felt for other period dramas like BBC North&South; or BBC Pride &Prejudice.;However, I put three stars because I thought that Ciaran Hinds was rather good in the part of Wentworth and I liked the settings for the film. I have watched the 1995 version only once and I will try to make the effort and watch it once more. But I've seen the 2007 ITV adaptation and in my heart, this one has already met my expectations. Even though it is not as faithful to the book as the 1995 one and despite the poor performances of some actors, the 2007 version has blown me away, simply because Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones are perfect in the parts of Anne Elliot and of Captain Wentworth!!!This BBC version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is not a bad film in itself. But it is just not 'my' adaptation of the book.

In response to the person who suggested that some of the Austen movies are just costume fests (Emma)I must say that the tone of the novel and film of Emma is much different than Persuasion.  Emma was written to comment on the idea of social class, is about a silly girl, and is firmly tongue in cheek.  It is a sunny novel and therefore a sunny film.  Sense and Sensibility is a darker film and more resembles the film Persuasion in tone.  The tension in S and S is how will this mother and her three daughters find happiness.  In Persuasion the tension is how will these two lovers reconcile and get back together?  As far as Wentworth appearing in a non-uniform in his first scene, why not?  It is not the captain's uniform that attracts Anne, it is the man himself.  The Navy is the only way she can keep track of him. As an American I enjoy seeing these Brit actors in other films--Amanda Root as Miss Temple in William Hurt's Jane Eyre, the brother in law in An Ideal Husband, and Ciaran Hinds in any  number of films such as The Man Who Cried (with Amanda Root.)

Just a snippet of odd gossip which has nothing to do with this movie adaptation - which I loved.Amanda Root was just perfect as Anne Elliot, the woman who had followed the good advice of her friend some seven years before and refused to marry a suitor without many prospects - Captain Wentworth. By sheer coincidence he returns to the neighbourhood with his sister and her husband. Partly to show Anne what a fool she has been in the past he starts seriously flirting with her two sisters-in-law (the sisters of her wife's brother) however it takes a near disaster to show that their feelings for one another haven't changed. Root plays Anne in beautifully - she is quiet, subdued, yet there is an elegance to her, and slowly her bloom returns.I also really liked the production - the cinematography struck me as less colourful and bouyant than other recent Austen films (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility) - in fact the skies often feel low, or crowded with clouds, the costumes dark and rooms not quite so brightly lit. Well until Anne gets to Bath that is where her father's extravagance seems to be shown in endlessly bright rooms. I really liked the production but I know that some people found them too authentic to be really enjoyable - things like hair being not quite clean or the small dark and rather claustrophobic rooms at Lyme.

Persuasion, in some respects Austen's best novel, receives a refined but honest treatment here, with none of the superficial glamor that has afflicted others. The acting is strong, the costuming believable, and the grime and disheveled look of the people a nice contrast to Stately Georgian Manors.I have only one negative to note: the out of place, easy listening piano noodling that occurs at intimate moments throughout. It's as though somebody read that this was supposed to be an autumnal novel (and it is), and thought this had to be italicized, underscored, and boldfaced. At the very least, if that's what the director and producer wanted, they could have gotten some Mozart or at least pseudo-Mozart to reflect this; instead, they chose something that breaks the carefully crafted period sense of the visuals and sounds.I can't say everyone is going to be as sensitive as I am to the music in a film--and that's good. Everybody should be different, and approach such things with their own preferences. I can only state how I feel about this. It's still a damn fine adaptation, and I would recommend it to anyone.

The reason for this being that story is about love lost and the fear that it might never be able to be regained, two subjects that are difficult to portray without great acting, scenery and music. Luckily for the viewer, this adaptation of 'Persuasion' has all of that.It really resonates with you from how it just captures each character perfectly and displays how aggravating the unbearably suffocating social etiquette of Regency England truly was. This might have seemed 'romantic' and 'emotional' in some overly sentimental Hollywood period films but in this adaptation, you see how heartbreaking it is. It is a raw and unflinching portrayal of how Regency England would have been like for the debt-ridden landed gentry yet it is a subtle and almost repressed tale of the choices we make.The acting is sublime, I cannot applaud it more and other reviewers agree with me so it just can't be dissed! The music was beautiful and I loved the attention to detail that the camera gave - it just shows that the BBC weren't trying to make an adaptation that would make loads of money, they did it to fulfill what Austen wanted us to see.I can see why some enthusiasts of the novel would feel that better looking people should have played the two main characters because that is Austen describes it in the book but don't be put off! The choice of actors actually works better because it is just about pure emotion, not how fit they are in the book.Last Thought: This adaptation won't be for everyone but if you just want to appreciate matters of the soul without having image or superficiality in the middle of things, don't be dissuaded - watch 'Persuasion'.",5,"''Wentworth, he's a nobody''",1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,1768,"[""'Persuasion"", 'novel', 'flawless', 'adapt', 'film', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'going', 'be', 'colossal', 'task', 'reason', 'being', 'story', 'love', 'lost', 'fear', 'might', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'regained', 'two', 'subjects', 'are', 'difficult', 'portray', 'great', 'acting', 'scenery', 'music', 'Luckily', 'viewer', 'adaptation', ""'Persuasion"", 'that.It', 'really', 'how', 'just', 'character', 'perfectly', 'displays', 'how', 'aggravating', 'unbearably', 'suffocating', 'social', 'etiquette', 'Regency', 'England', 'truly', 'was', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', ""'romantic"", ""'emotional"", 'overly', 'sentimental', 'Hollywood', 'period', 'films', 'adaptation', 'see', 'how', 'heartbreaking', 'raw', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'how', 'Regency', 'England', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'debt-ridden', 'landed', 'gentry', 'yet', 'subtle', 'almost', 'repressed', 'tale', 'choices', 'make.The', 'acting', 'sublime', 'can', 'not', 'applaud', 'more', 'other', 'reviewers', 'agree', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissed', 'music', 'was', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'attention', 'detail', 'camera', 'gave', 'just', 'BBC', 'were', ""n't"", 'trying', 'make', 'adaptation', 'would', 'make', 'loads', 'money', 'did', 'fulfill', 'what', 'Austen', 'wanted', 'see.I', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'enthusiasts', 'novel', 'would', 'feel', 'better', 'looking', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Austen', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'choice', 'actors', 'actually', 'better', 'just', 'pure', 'emotion', 'not', 'how', 'fit', 'are', 'book.Last', 'Thought', 'adaptation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'just', 'want', 'appreciate', 'matters', 'soul', 'having', 'image', 'superficiality', 'middle', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissuaded', 'watch', ""'Persuasion""]",Persuasion VHS

By that, I mean that I think they actually read the book before producing the film. And the production is so much better for it.The story is classic and familiar:  Boy and girl fall in love.  The girl (who is young and easily manipulated) is convinced to drop the boy since he is not ""acceptable"" -- not of her caste.  Later, after many changes in fortune, they meet again, but this time it is the man who is initially reluctant to form any kind of alliance with her, though she still cares deeply for him.  It takes some shared experiences, a change of scenery, and some realization on both of their parts of their mutual responsibilities before they are happily joined together.Sounds like the making of a soap opera, doesn't it?  But in the hands of Jane Austin's incomparable skill at story telling coupled with excellent casting of the film, a fine adaptation of the story, and just a smidge of Aristotle's ""willing suspension of disbelief,"" this film is a wonderful fresh surprise.By the way, if you saw the recent PBS Masterpiece Classics adaptation of this same book, you may find as I did that it suffered greatly when compared to this earlier production.

Eight years later, now a prosperous  ship's captain, he comes home and is looking for a wife.This must be the  definitive adaption of Jane Austen's novel Persuasion. I cannot imagine any  future adaption surpassing it. Every actor is the very embodiment  of his  or her character. Jane Austen, I think, would have recognised them all.  Amanda Root is particularly good as Anne with her large expressive eyes.  She is exactly the way I imagined her to be. And Fiona Shaw as Mrs Coft and  Susan fleetwood  as Lady Russell are both excellent.However, I have some  slight doubt about Ciaran Hinds who played Captain Wentworth. He certainly  looked the part, though why they allowed him to appear in his first scene,  when he should have been at his most impressive, wearing a  filthy looking  top-coat and a scruffy cravat I've no idea. But, as a ship's captain,  Wentworth should have been portrayed as a strong man  with  an easy,  confident manner and Ciaran Hinds it seems to me was a little lacking in  that respect. At the dinner table when he was flirting with the Musgrove  sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, and should have been at his most charming,  he seemed to have some slight awkwardness and impediment in his  speech.And the scene at the recital when he storms off in a jealous rage  was a bit over the top. A good man, even in a jealous rage, would never  treat the woman he loves so unfeelingly, particularly after she has shown  she cares by abandoning the other man and chasing after him. It was  childish behaviour and heroic ship's captains are not normally prone to  childish behaviour. But this scene is false to the novel and falsifies both  the character of Wentworth and Anne. In the novel she does not chase after  him; no woman at that time would have dreamt of doing such a thing in a  public place. It would have been unthinkable. He comes to talk to her and  it in only when  Mr Elliot approaches to urge her  to return to her seat  that he allows his jealous feelings to show and, saying goodbye, leaves  abruptly. But not in anger. More in sorrow than anger.The novel of  course is much richer than the dramatisation could ever be in its allotted  time span. In the scene where Wentworth hands Anne into the carriage  alongside Admiral Croft and his wife, we are left to infer Anne's feelings.

It isn't exactly poorly done, but it could be far far better, and suffers badly from comparison with Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility"" and of course with A&E;'s exquisite ""Pride & Prejudice"" but it could be far, far better. I too had high hopes after reading so many glowing reviews, the story will always be memorable, but it is almost a filmed version of Cliff's Notes on Austen's original tale. It runs 104 minutes to S&S; 136 to P&P;'s 6 volume set. Why? Perhaps it was designed around television commercial space.What particularly grated was the casting and much direction which was strangely off. The eldest sister Elizabeth is pissy and crude although she has been in charge of Sir Walter's social responsibilities and second only to him in ""precedence"" since her mother's death. It is not necessary to have her slouch in a chair and throw papers about in a pout to establish her character as a bad egg. Neither one, especially Ann, is believable as daughter of nobility and the upper class. Ann in particular clomps about clumsily, starts, scuttles, and hides. One can hardly imagine her daring to give an order to anyone (other than calling for a doctor after Louisa's fall) although giving orders to servants is her station in life. The very elegant and lovely and believable Lady Russell has been her close companion and surrogate mother since Ann lost her own mother at 14 - and this is the result? Compare to Lady Russell herself, to the S&S; apparently lower ranking Eleanor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) saying her farewells to the servants or the elegant creature who Marianne Dashwood discovers to be her replacement, or to P&P; Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. Rather than an image of a Lady of gentle quietness, forebearance and resignation, she seems more a scared rabbit. I could see her in the role of the starting, clomping, bewildered maid in P&P; being ordered to stop working on Lizzy's hair and attend to Miss Jane. She does the staring traumatized eyes quite well however, so they are featured in nearly every scene. The hypochondriac youngest daughter Mary is well acted - but she even seems older than Ann.What is NOT featured is any kind of dialogue that would establish the character that is claimed for her. We have only the doormat behavior to establish deference to others; the blandishments of the scheming Mr. Elliott on skill at Italian; the final speech overheard by Capt. Wentworth. We should be allowed to see more of her than what is filtered through her blind and belittling family, not less.P&P; actually added character development - for example, not until the scene at the Rosings pianoforte did it occur to me that part of Mr. Darcy's problem just might be that he is as naturally shy as his sister, or why Georgiana had specifically NOT been entrusted to the tender care of Lady Catherine. Edward in S&S; was beautifully developed through Margaret's Atlas (in a wonderful scene that does not exist in the book).I don't suppose I will never ever watch it again, but it has sent me back to re-read the novel. A good thing, that, as is the reminder that a wonderful story does not automatically make a wonderful movie all on its own - and the critical impact of good direction, the overall artistry of casting, lighting, staging, landscape. One of the things I love about DVDs (such as S&S;) is the opportunity to listen to scene commentary by the actors and directors, to understand how very much goes into the making of a good or great film, how little into poor or merely adequate ones.",2,Great story marred by poor casting and direction,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,3569,"[""'m"", 'afraid', 'must', 'agree', 'arabellafig', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'poorly', 'done', 'could', 'be', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'suffers', 'badly', 'comparison', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'course', 'A', 'E', 'exquisite', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'could', 'be', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'too', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'reading', 'so', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'story', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'memorable', 'almost', 'filmed', 'version', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'Austen', 'original', 'tale', '104', 'minutes', 'S', 'S', '136', 'P', 'P', '6', 'volume', 'set', 'Why', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'designed', 'television', 'commercial', 'space.What', 'particularly', 'grated', 'was', 'casting', 'much', 'direction', 'was', 'strangely', 'eldest', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'pissy', 'crude', 'been', 'charge', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'social', 'responsibilities', 'second', 'only', 'precedence', 'mother', 'death', 'not', 'necessary', 'have', 'slouch', 'chair', 'throw', 'papers', 'pout', 'establish', 'character', 'bad', 'egg', 'one', 'especially', 'Ann', 'believable', 'daughter', 'nobility', 'upper', 'class', 'Ann', 'particular', 'clomps', 'clumsily', 'starts', 'scuttles', 'hides', 'One', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'daring', 'give', 'order', 'anyone', 'other', 'calling', 'doctor', 'Louisa', 'fall', 'giving', 'orders', 'servants', 'station', 'life', 'very', 'elegant', 'lovely', 'believable', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'been', 'close', 'companion', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'Ann', 'lost', 'own', 'mother', '14', 'result', 'Compare', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'S', 'S', 'apparently', 'lower', 'ranking', 'Eleanor', 'Dashwood', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'saying', 'farewells', 'servants', 'elegant', 'creature', 'who', 'Marianne', 'Dashwood', 'discovers', 'be', 'replacement', 'P', 'P', 'Elizabeth', 'Jane', 'Bennet', 'Rather', 'image', 'Lady', 'gentle', 'quietness', 'forebearance', 'resignation', 'more', 'scared', 'rabbit', 'could', 'see', 'role', 'starting', 'clomping', 'bewildered', 'maid', 'P', 'P', 'being', 'ordered', 'stop', 'working', 'Lizzy', 'hair', 'attend', 'Miss', 'Jane', 'staring', 'traumatized', 'eyes', 'quite', 'well', 'however', 'are', 'featured', 'nearly', 'scene', 'hypochondriac', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'well', 'acted', 'even', 'older', 'Ann.What', 'NOT', 'featured', 'kind', 'dialogue', 'would', 'establish', 'character', 'claimed', 'have', 'only', 'doormat', 'behavior', 'establish', 'deference', 'others', 'blandishments', 'scheming', 'Mr.', 'Elliott', 'skill', 'Italian', 'final', 'speech', 'overheard', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'see', 'more', 'what', 'filtered', 'blind', 'belittling', 'family', 'not', 'less.P', 'P', 'actually', 'added', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'not', 'scene', 'Rosings', 'pianoforte', 'did', 'occur', 'part', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'problem', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'naturally', 'shy', 'sister', 'why', 'Georgiana', 'had', 'specifically', 'NOT', 'been', 'entrusted', 'tender', 'care', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Edward', 'S', 'S', 'was', 'beautifully', 'developed', 'Margaret', 'Atlas', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'not', 'exist', 'book', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'sent', 'back', 're-read', 'novel', 'good', 'thing', 'that', 'reminder', 'wonderful', 'story', 'not', 'automatically', 'make', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'own', 'critical', 'impact', 'good', 'direction', 'overall', 'artistry', 'casting', 'lighting', 'staging', 'landscape', 'One', 'things', 'love', 'DVDs', 'such', 'S', 'S', 'opportunity', 'listen', 'scene', 'commentary', 'actors', 'directors', 'understand', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'making', 'good', 'great', 'film', 'how', 'little', 'poor', 'merely', 'adequate', 'ones']",Persuasion VHS

Anne, the daughter of a conceited and spendthrift baronet, loved Wentworth but was advised by her family's confidant, Lady Russell, that the match was inappropriate, as Wentworth had no connections or money. Now 8 years later, because of her father's excessive financial debts, Anne's family is forced to retrench, and sublet their estate. The family retreats to Bath, where, to the delight of Anne's father, they can maintain their privileged lifestyle on a much smaller budget. The family's home, Kellynch Hall, is to be let by an Admiral and his wife, who, coincidentally, are related to Wentworth. This liaison throws Anne back into the society of Wentworth, now a dashing Captain in the Royal Navy who has amassed quite a fortune in privateering. The Captain has caught the attention of Louisa Musgrove, whose brother married Anne's sister, Mary. Meanwhile Anne, now in her late 20's and showing signs of physical and emotional stress, is surprisingly courted by Mr. Elliot, heir to her father's estate, Kellynch Hall. The question remains as to whether Mr. Elliot's romantic intentions towards Anne are sincere, and whether she can bare the thought of her lost love, Captain Wentworth, marrying Miss Louisa.There is truly nothing that can compare to a Jane Austen romance. Her style is timeless; her plotting masterful. The characters in her books are so well-developed that they have become somewhat immortal. Fans of period pieces will NOT be disappointed.

393265,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6303965415,C. O. DeRiemer,"[12, 13]","To my way of thinking there have been two truly great adaptations of Jane Austin novels. There have been many very good ones, and I've enjoyed most of the ones I've seen. The two that stay in my mind, however, are the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and this one, also from the BBC. They have in common clever and romantic plot lines, first-class production values, uniformly well cast actors who look the period, the skilled translation of Austin's words into the mouths of the characters, and two outstanding female leads. Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Amanda Root, who plays Anne Elliot here, are not conventionally beautiful women, but they are skilled actresses who can show emotion with their eyes and carry meaning with a glance. They glow with intelligence and common sense.Anne Elliot (Root) is the daughter of a foolish, self-involved baronet (Corin Redgrave) who thinks more of society and people's places in it, especially his, than of anything else. Since Anne's mother died, he has squandered his wealth maintaining his view of what his position should be. Anne's sister is just as bad. Eight years earlier a relatively poor naval officer, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds) had proposed to Anne, but on the advice of Lady Russell, a friend she trusted, she declined. Lady Russell had pointed out that the match was simply unsuitable. ""He had no fortune, no connections,"" she tells Anne again. ""It was entirely prudent of you to reject him."" Now it's eight years later. Anne is 27 and has almost resigned herself to a life of spinsterhood and duty to her family. But by chance (and chance plays a part in Austin's novels), she meets Wentworth again. He is now Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune and his reputation in the Napoleonic wars. Her father, however, can see no point in the Navy. ""I strongly object to the Navy,"" he says. ""It brings people of obscure birth into undue distinction and it cuts up a man's youth and vigor most horribly!""Persuasion is the story of how these two people, who have been seen as imperfect by many and who see each other as perfect, manage tentatively through the stilted conventions of the day, one to find the courage to ask again and the other to say ""Yes"" this time. Hinds brings authority to the part, but also a shyness. We catch him glancing at Anne and at first are unsure if he longs for her or resents her. Root makes a terrific heroine. She may even look a little plain, but she is intelligent, she cares for her relatives and her friends. She regrets the decision she made eight years ago, but doesn't know really what she can do within the limits of her world. And finally it comes down to the two of them needing to persuade themselves and each other to step out of convention and simply say to each other what they feel.""Society"" and one's place in society was all important. Calculation and artifice -- and money -- were far more important than ability or sincerity. Austin skewers with gentleness the pretensions of these self-involved people and their attitudes. She also creates a heroine who is humorous and shrewd. At one point, Anne Elliot is discussing the differences in the natures of men and women with Captain Harville, a friend of Wentworth's. ""We do not forget you,"" says Anne, ""as soon as you forget us. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You always have business of some sort or other to take you back into the world."" ""I won't allow it to be any more man's nature than women's to be inconstant or to forget those they love or have loved,"" Harville replies. ""I believe the reverse. I believe... Let me just observe that all histories are against you, all stories, prose, and verse. I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which did not have something to say on women's fickleness."" ""But they were all written by men,"" Anne says with a smile.This really is a wonderful movie. Persuasion was shown as a BBC television production in Britain, but came to the United States as a theatrical release. Occasionally it shows up on American TV. The DVD picture is very good; it has a rich look to it.

I loved this book and the characters so much and it also reminds me of a special day with my mother.  Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds do such a wonderful job of conveying lost love and longing.  The movie is shot in a way that is more keeping with what the time period would have really looked like.  The cast is not a typically beautiful Hollywood group and look like they could live next door.  Amanda Root does such a wonderful job of making Anne's transformation from the workhorse spinster sister to an independent (as much as possible at the time) happy woman.  She conveys the change in Anne when she goes from being a victim of heartbreak to moving on and finally to happiness.  All done without makeup.  Ciaran Hinds is brilliant as Captain Wentworth who is also heartbroken and is able to mend his heart and love again.There are many film adaptations of Jane Austin's books and I enjoy them all but this quiet story is touching in a way unlike the others.

This book has a very refined and complex plot and many scholars consider that the heroin of this book, Anne Elliot, is one of the most complex characters that Ms. Austen created. I have readen all her books and I must agree with them. She is not the vivacious Elizabeth Bennett or the sensible Eleanor Darwood,or even the lovely Emma, but in Anne the aspect of introversion and reflexion are profound. It is not very easy to read her emotions, she conceals them very well, and being a very private person, her thoughts are not very easily apparent to the others. Her refusal of the proposal of marriage at 19 years old put her ""in the shelf"" and the reasons for this refusal are not very clear, but it seemed influenced by an older friend that thought that the impoverished pretendent was not ""good enough"" for the young Anne, daughter of a baronet. Since then, she lived for the confort of her family without any recognition. The return of her former pretendent to the place where she lives now makes her review her past actions and consider if the life that she is living now is better than the risk of the marriage at 19 with a man that she obviously loved. This is the plot of the romance and also of the movie. The richness and quality of the drama of Ms. Austen's book is well known but must be very difficult to portray in a movie of more or less than 2 hours. Fortunately for the fans this movie achieved this almost impossible task. With the key characters played by Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) and Ciaran Hind (Captain Wentworth) and a support cast of magnificent quality , the movie portrays the intricacies of the romance with superb maestry and the actress playing Anne (probably the most difficult character of Ms. Austen to play) makes a job so good that watching the movie we can see her inner conflicts and hopes, the despair and the happiness in her face almost without any words being said. Ciaran Hind is a magnificent Navy Captain and makes the perfect pair for Amanda Root. They are older than the other characters in the other books of Ms. Austen (Anne must be at least 27-28 years old and Captain Wentworth is certanly more than 30, almost 35 years old) but it must be mentioned that Persuasion was the last book of Ms. Austen. If you want to enjoy a extremely good romantic movie, faithful to the spirit of the book and with a superb cast, figurines and scenario, you will enjoy this adaptation very much. Is is priceless,a delicate jewel that follows  the spirit of Jane Austen's world with respect and even admiration.

An accident to one of them will force Anne to take charge, making a renewed impression on Wentworth.In Bath with her family, Anne will make a series of boring social rounds, only to have a long-missing Eliot cousin suddenly pay court to her.

So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.""Persuasion"" is a very different story than Jane Austen's other novels, mainly because it was the last book she wrote before her early death -- it has an older heroine, admiration for the self-made man, and a sense of bittersweet resignation to lost chances and old loves. And the movie adaptation is very faithful to the original novel, and maintains the same mixture of romanticism and realism.The only major problem with the movie is that it moves... very... slowly... throughout the first three-quarters of the movie. But it has Austen's subtle wit (""My offer to flatter and adore you all the days of your life."" ""I haven't had a moment to turn my mind to it"") and delicate romantic interplay, as well as some delicious harpooning of puffed-up aristocrats, social climbers and nasty relatives.Root is absolutely brilliant as Anne -- she's not pretty, but her enormous liquid eyes give her a quietly striking quality that is much rarer than mere prettiness. And she does a great job with Anne's quiet despair at ever getting married, particularly to the one man she loved. And Hinds is equally amazing as Wentworth, a strong, intelligent man with a deep inner fire. The scene in which they finally come together in the street is staggeringly powerful... although the passing circus is kind of distracting.The adaptation of Jane Austen's final novel is a polished, slow, slightly bittersweet love story about a second chance with the one you love. Be persuaded -- ""Persuasion"" is lovely.",5,A second chance at love,1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,3017,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'time', 'young', 'women', 'were', 'taught', 'was', 'practically', 'duty', 'marry', 'well', 'someone', 'least', 'equal', 'social/financial', 'standing.But', 'woman', 'turned', 'down', 'suitor', 'being', 'poor', 'ran', 'risk', 'losing', 'man', 'loved', 'problem', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'heroine', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'delicate', 'romance', 'place', 'AFTER', 'romance', 'rejection', 'heartrending', 'sorrow', 'best', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds.Eight', 'years', 'ago', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'Root', 'was', 'engaged', 'handsome', 'intelligent', 'impoverished', 'sailor', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Hinds', 'was', 'persuaded', 'dump', 'family', 'friend', 'Lady', 'Russell.Now', 'twenty-seven', 'ancient', 'time', 'standards', 'vain', 'father', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'facing', 'financial', 'ruin', 'relocate', 'Bath', 'rent', 'vast', 'family', 'estate', 'out', 'new', 'tenant', 'Frederick', 'brother-in-law', 'course', 'Anne', 'still', 'Frederick', ""n't"", 'seem', 'feel', 'same', 'especially', 'rumored', 'be', 'interested', 'younger', 'flirtier', 'girls.And', 'Anne', 'worries', 'increase', 'when', 'family', 'Bath', 'where', 'father', 'attempting', 'live', 'lifestyle', 'baronet', 'heir', 'William', 'Elliott', 'recently', 'reestablished', 'contact', 'relatives', 'very', 'interested', 'Anne', 'Anne', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'even', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'Frederick', 'truly', 'Persuasion', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'other', 'novels', 'mainly', 'was', 'last', 'book', 'wrote', 'early', 'death', 'older', 'heroine', 'admiration', 'self-made', 'man', 'sense', 'bittersweet', 'resignation', 'lost', 'chances', 'old', 'loves', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'very', 'faithful', 'original', 'novel', 'same', 'mixture', 'romanticism', 'realism.The', 'only', 'major', 'problem', 'movie', 'very', 'slowly', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'movie', 'Austen', 'subtle', 'wit', 'offer', 'flatter', 'adore', 'days', 'life', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'moment', 'turn', 'mind', 'delicate', 'romantic', 'interplay', 'as', 'well', 'delicious', 'harpooning', 'puffed-up', 'aristocrats', 'social', 'climbers', 'nasty', 'relatives.Root', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Anne', 'not', 'pretty', 'enormous', 'liquid', 'eyes', 'give', 'quietly', 'striking', 'quality', 'much', 'rarer', 'mere', 'prettiness', 'great', 'job', 'Anne', 'quiet', 'despair', 'ever', 'getting', 'married', 'particularly', 'one', 'man', 'loved', 'Hinds', 'equally', 'amazing', 'Wentworth', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'man', 'deep', 'inner', 'fire', 'scene', 'finally', 'come', 'together', 'street', 'staggeringly', 'powerful', 'passing', 'circus', 'kind', 'distracting.The', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'final', 'novel', 'polished', 'slow', 'slightly', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'story', 'second', 'chance', 'one', 'love', 'Be', 'persuaded', 'Persuasion', 'lovely']",Persuasion VHS

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","PERSUASION must be reviewed because it is a gorgeous, incomparable Jane Austen adaptation (for public TV) which I have loved since I first saw it when it was new. Since so many of the 800-plus reviews here seem to nag away at the pace or the adaptation itself (one troglodyte complained about the accents) ... well, I thought it best to intervene!Not wishing to insult intelligences and assuming you all know this great work, I will first cover the basic ground of Austen's genius story. This is about the Elliott Family, the father of whom is a baronet with three daughters. His money-flinging ways since the death of his wife have forced him and his two daughters to move back to their original hometown of Bath.Intertwined here is the story of an old flame, very much alive, between a Royal Navy captain and the baronet's middle daughter; the baronet's nephew who stands to inherit title/land suddenly reformed and returned to the family; the married youngest daughter who seems to be occupying a place originally meant for the middle daughter.Now let me be brief: this must be one of the most enlightening, intelligent and delightful adaptations ever written, do you hear? Read the novel if you wish further clarification because from me, you won't get it. Every tiniest detail of this film is so sublime and the acting so marvelous it makes me think this level of excellence would have to vanish sooner rather than later.The stars shine in this, no matter how ""cameoed"", but in the usual British way there is no alpha actor to whom all must be subservient. Truly, I have never seen an Austen story come to life as they do here, with Austen's very thought processes exposed on the screen. It is a measure of a person's intellect how well they enjoy and appreciate this fine work.There is only one flaw: the relationship between three of the characters is kept dark and fuzzy. That, I did not like--it ought to have been crystal clear as it is in the novel. I will leave the discovery up to you.

I was confused in places when I watched for the first time this 1995 version of Persuasion with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, but a second viewing clarified -- and I've watched and loved it many times since (however, I've mused that this version would have been even better had Andrew Davies written the screenplay). I love to watch the subtle play of emotions on the characters' faces, which reveal the thoughts and feelings people of that era would never utter aloud. I was so looking forward to watching Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth in the new rendition of Persuasion because I loved him in his small but memorable role in the excellent film, Charlotte Gray. But I was disappointed in the entire production, especially in the casting of plain Sally Hawkins. I would never for a moment believe that Penry Jones would be attracted to, never mind pine for, her. I was also disappointed in Penry Jones' rather wooden performance (though I think he had the deck stacked against him by the screenplay and the way that film was shot). I found the final scene of Hawkins running through the streets ridiculous and her way-too-long-lead-up-to-a-kiss with Wentworth contrived. What most disturbed me about the new film and the other new film versions of the Austen novels released this season (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, although I thought Northanger Abbey the best of the three; I haven't seen Sense and Sensibility or Emma yet) is that everything feels forced -- the action is too fast and ""choppy."" Sally Hawkins is plopped onto the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes, versus the subtle caress of Ciaran Hinds' hands on Amanda Root's waist as he helps her into the carriage, followed by the embarrassed expression on her face as she looks back at him and as he turns away to hide the caring his action revealed. Time and time again in this 1995 version, you can see the subtle emotions on the characters' faces because the camera lingers appropriately. This is only one of countless moments of genuine feeling that is totally lacking in the new version. Is it that we're losing in our increasingly fast-paced results-oriented world -- reflected in many current films -- the ability to let life and feeling unfold according to its own natural rhythms? I was not persuaded that the characters in the new version were real at all.

Starring Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, this version of the classic is certainly admirable in both performance and faithfulness to the work itself. While the story is both a satire and a drama, the pervading question that surfaces is: what can we do when we let someone important slip away from us? For Anne Elliot, she must not only live in the present, but deal with a past love when Captain Wentworth resurfaces in her life years after their failed love.One of the great things about this version is not only its succinctness, but the great effort by the cast. While the movie is barely over one hour and a half long, it still keeps much of the relevant plot within the script. There is not a sense of dragging the story around; we get right into the main issues of the work and the story shifts rather quickly. The cast itself was also commendable-for instance, Anne's sister, Elizabeth, who is played by Pheobe Nichols, comes across perfectly as someone who is a bit snobbish and only concerned with the issue of class and reputation for both herself and her sister.Another successful aspect of the film is the ability to depict accurately the social values that are so crucial to the book's relevancy. For example, we really get a true look at how much family pressure made a difference in determining marital values, as is demonstrated in the case of Anne Elliot and her family's wishes that leave her feeling guilty and frustrated years later.The most essential aspect of filming a classic is to bring forth the vitality of the book, and this one does this successfully. We see the story of a woman who must try to put her family's wishes and other's interferences aside in order to find what is truly essential to her well-being.  Anne must also fight through the frustrations of others interfering in something that is paramount to her own life-love.",4,Successful adaptation of Austen's work,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2004,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'Persuasion', 'last', 'great', 'novel', 'life', 'great', 'perfection', '1995', 'film', 'version', 'Starring', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'version', 'classic', 'certainly', 'admirable', 'performance', 'faithfulness', 'work', 'story', 'satire', 'drama', 'pervading', 'question', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'let', 'someone', 'important', 'slip', 'away', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'present', 'deal', 'past', 'love', 'when', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'resurfaces', 'life', 'years', 'failed', 'love.One', 'great', 'things', 'version', 'not', 'only', 'succinctness', 'great', 'effort', 'cast', 'movie', 'barely', 'one', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'still', 'much', 'relevant', 'plot', 'script', 'not', 'sense', 'dragging', 'story', 'around', 'get', 'right', 'main', 'issues', 'work', 'story', 'shifts', 'rather', 'quickly', 'cast', 'was', 'also', 'commendable-for', 'instance', 'Anne', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'played', 'Pheobe', 'Nichols', 'across', 'perfectly', 'someone', 'who', 'bit', 'snobbish', 'only', 'concerned', 'issue', 'class', 'reputation', 'sister.Another', 'successful', 'aspect', 'film', 'ability', 'depict', 'accurately', 'social', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'crucial', 'book', 'relevancy', 'example', 'really', 'get', 'true', 'look', 'how', 'much', 'family', 'pressure', 'made', 'difference', 'determining', 'marital', 'values', 'demonstrated', 'case', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'family', 'wishes', 'leave', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'frustrated', 'years', 'most', 'essential', 'aspect', 'filming', 'classic', 'bring', 'forth', 'vitality', 'book', 'one', 'successfully', 'see', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'must', 'try', 'put', 'family', 'wishes', 'other', 'interferences', 'aside', 'order', 'find', 'what', 'truly', 'essential', 'well-being', 'Anne', 'must', 'also', 'fight', 'frustrations', 'others', 'interfering', 'something', 'paramount', 'own', 'life-love']",Persuasion VHS

It is a film that requires your complete attention to the actors on the screen; you've got to pay close attention to them because there is not any overt display of feelings/emotions until the very end of the movie. No chewing of the scenery--just superb acting! The eyes of Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds (as Anne and Captain Wentworth) express a world of emotions--they simply speak volumes. There is not a great deal of ""physical action"" in this film. On the surface, everthing is sooooooo proper, refined and controlled; however, there's ""loads"" going on emotionally inside the characters and that is expressed completely through the actors' eyes and facial expressions. Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds performances just blew me away! If you are not watching Root's eyes (as Anne) when she first sees Captain Wentworth, you will miss completely what he has meant to her, what he still means to her and what the movie is about--it's all portrayed in her eyes. Ciarian Hinds, as Captian Wentworth, at first keeps ""his cool"" doing the macho thing and not giving the audience a hint of what Anne has meant and stills means to him. But watch that facade start to crumble--again portrayed in his eyes. Some reviewers on this board find Hinds' portrayal of the captain as too distant and cold. I don't. Remember, he was the one rejected by Anne and, to me, he's putting on that ""I'll show her"" routine. But as I previously stated that soon changes and you really find out how much he still loves her.I just love acting of this caliber. For me, you can forget the actors that chew up scenery. Give me the ones that can stun you with their depth of emotion and feeling through subtle means of expression--Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds are such actors.

393323,A328S9RN3U5M68,6303965415,Grady Harp,"[14, 17]","PERSUASION together with NORTHANGER ABBEY were posthumous novels by Jane Austin (published 1817) and reflect the position of a novelist whose thoughts mirror her younger, wonderful bright spirit yet somehow her softer social and feminist darts she so successfully hurled at society in her other famous works.  This particular film adaptation by Nick Dear of PERSUASION respects not only the spirit of the novel but also the station of the author.  Under Roger Mitchell's keen direction this cinematic reenactment of the belated flowering of a Anne Elliot's eight year thwarted longing for the love of naval officer Frederick Wentworth, all due to the 'impropriety' of Wentworth's financial standings of the past, is placed before us as a quietly gentle song, one that still places the scrutinizing Austen microscope on the social mores of the time and the bows to class distinctions that serve as the matrix for Austen's novels.The cast is excellent, with Amanda Root suitably in the background as Anne Elliot and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as the wise and slightly weathered Captain Wentworth.  But their superb performances would not be as credible were it not for the large cast of fine actors playing the superficial silly sisters and cousins and the haughty ladies as well as the warm and worthy ones.  This is first rate ensemble acting, allowing the quiet pulse of Austen's Anne to beat softly behind longing eyes, making her plight and ultimate reward for perseverance step stage front at the end of the film.  The music of Chopin and Bach flavor the score by Jeremy Sams and the presence of Rosa Mannion, soprano, singing arias and songs lends both an aural and visual credibility to the atmosphere so ably captured by cinematographer John Daly.

393334,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,6303965415,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[31, 35]","This is clearly one of the most polarising of Jane Austen adaptations on film. Some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting, the authentically costumed characters, the beautiful scenery and sets, the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film. Others will loathe the complete absence of makeup, the fact that Amanda Root is visibly older than 29, the slow and tender story, the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the Mr Elliot sub-plot (including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards Mrs Smith).I acknowledge both of these views. Certainly Amanda Root does not enhance her natural sweet looks, and she does look a little too old for the part of Anne Elliot, but mon dieu, her acting! That is something else again. In terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character, no better actress could have been found. If only she'd  been permitted to ""youthify"" her looks a little... After all, in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it's true her looks had faded somewhat, her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest, I do prefer superb acting to superb looks, and that is why I find Amanda Root's portrayal so very moving and real.Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is excellent as Captain Wentworth, Anne's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago. He is not movie-star handsome, but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes. In personality and character, he is undeniably the right match for Ms Root's Anne. The interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach. He is very deliberately ignoring Anne, although with perfect politeness. More and more, the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them, and the beauty of Anne's character is so wonderfully brought out by Amanda Root's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised.The sub-plots are also superbly explicated. Anne's selfish and heedless father (Corin Redgrave) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister Elizabeth(Phoebe Nicholls), not to mention her laughably tiresome sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on Anne's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour. Mr Elliot (the brilliant Samuel West) doesn't really get enough storytime in this adaption, unfortunately - I do think the script didn't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character. But the wonderful Fiona Shaw is perfect in the role of Mrs Croft (Anne's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times), and Lady Russell (Anne's mentor) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by Susan Fleetwood. I also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking Mrs Clay (Felicity Dean) and the thoroughly nice Charles Musgrove who, having been rejected by Anne, decided to wed Mary instead (very, very well played by Simon Russell Beale, who makes this sort of role look completely effortless).The look of this film is lovely in many ways. The lack of makeup may take some getting used to, but there's no denying it's authentic, and with such excellent acting from everyone involved, the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed.The truly magnificent singing of opera singer Rosa Mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any Jane Austen film. (All too often, the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice', but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class. Or... if no natural talent was possessed, perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing. But music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces.)To sum up: for those who want a film that is purely escapist, that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is ""exciting"" to watch, this is probably not a film that will appeal to you. For those, however, who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances, there will be great enjoyment for you.",4,A beautifully subtle and

393335,A2FVCVUBUDGZ8W,6303965415,"Irene Adler ""The Woman""","[2, 11]","Much of the praise given to this movie is deserved. The acting is uniformly excellent. Indeed, every character, excepting none, is carefully etched and individuality drawn. To name a few: Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth, Sophie Thompson as the ever-complaining, self absorbed sister Mary, Corin Redgrave as the narcissistic, snobbish aristocrat Sir Walter Elliot,  Susan Fleetwood as the a sympathetic, but still classist Lady Russell, Richard McCabe as a falsely fragile, introspective Captain Benwick, Samual West as scheming, polished, pretty boy scoundrel; also, with the reservation noted below, Amanda Root as Anne Elliot.The period is superbly portrayed.  The attitudes about society, class, and birth rights being almost incomprehensible by modern mores are made tangibly credible.  The costumes, personal appearance, and grooming all accurately show Eighteenth century England, a time quite different from our own.  People, even upper class people, sweat, sometimes wear dirty cloths, are not always perfectly shaven, don't always have straight teeth and show real emotions and human variation, not to say faults.  Eighteenth century Europe's detailed and steeply declinated social stratification is magnificently, though incidentally, portrayed.Granted Mr. Elliot's motivation and behavior are under explained, but this is a minor flaw.So what is really wrong with the movie?  It is just not believable that a homely, reserved, and wilted Anne Elliot could attract or re-attract the dynamic and successful Captain Wentworth.  Amanda Root, being limited by her inherent appearance and personality, may have done a less than optimal job, but I cannot think of any actress who could have made credible that hansom, rich, self assured Wentworth would be attracted to this mouse in the corner.  Perhaps the fault is with Jane Austen's plot.  Perhaps when she wrote the character of Anne Elliot, Jane was indulging in a bit of wishful thinking motivated by her own romantically unfulfilled life.But I liked it and having seen it several times, have come to accept the improbability of Wentworth's continued attraction to Root's Anne Elliot.

Harsher only insofar as it is realistic though.This film is very, very well made with superb acting by British actors, none of whom was familiar to me personally. It is refreshing to have such a variety of great actors who are not all distracting superstars and supermodels.My only misgiving is that the Author (Austen) seems in this story to worship the Royal Navy and the life of a naval officer. Although the Royal Navy was undoubtedly more of a meritocracy than many other institutions at that time, one should bear in mind that it wasn't by being a choir boy that naval officers rose to riches and prominence at that time.

393346,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,6303965415,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[19, 20]","""Persuasion,"" the film, is a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's final completed novel, and to my mind her finest book. It is directed, with subtlety and brilliance, by Roger Michell. The film is quite able to stand alone, on its own merits - you don't have to know Ms. Austen's work to be captivated by the pure magic of the romance, the Regency English period history, brilliant characterizations, color, music and costumes of this extraordinary drama brought to life on the screen. The movie deals with the same social issues as the book, especially the British class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry ""up"" to a higher station - and into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate tale of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point is clearly that one shouldn't ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne (Amanda Root), is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the film begins. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both single. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to call off the engagement, convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the film. Anne chooses this time to visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Charles Muskgrove, her husband, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. There are wonderfully warm scenes of family and friends dining, dancing, hiking over the gorgeous countryside, and at the seashore, that bring the audience smack into early 19th century English life. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. Intense. I cannot imagine a better actress to play Anne than Amanda Root. She slowly transforms herself from a sallow, aging spinster to a luminescent woman in love - and this is Not just the makeup. Wentworth/Hinds is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels the sting of her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). If Ms. Root is the perfect Anne, then Mr. Hinds is the best possible Wentworth. He is as large and virile as she is petite and feminine. He oozes sexuality...but again, he portrays his character with great subtlety. The entire production is brilliantly cast and the acting is superbI think this is Ms. Austen's most passionate piece. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable film, like the novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. Each time I view it, it just gets better. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.",5,A Superb Film Adapted From A Literary Masterpiece,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,4544,"['Persuasion', 'film', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'final', 'completed', 'novel', 'mind', 'finest', 'book', 'directed', 'subtlety', 'brilliance', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'film', 'quite', 'able', 'stand', 'alone', 'own', 'merits', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'Ms.', 'Austen', 'work', 'be', 'captivated', 'pure', 'magic', 'romance', 'Regency', 'English', 'period', 'history', 'brilliant', 'characterizations', 'color', 'music', 'costumes', 'extraordinary', 'drama', 'brought', 'life', 'screen', 'movie', 'deals', 'same', 'social', 'issues', 'book', 'especially', 'British', 'class', 'system', 'Rigid', 'social', 'barriers', 'existed', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'marry', 'up', 'higher', 'station', 'wealth', 'also', 'very', 'poignant', 'passionate', 'tale', 'love', 'disappointment', 'loss', 'redemption', 'point', 'clearly', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'persuaded', 'abandon', 'core', 'values', 'beliefs', 'especially', 'ignoble', 'goals', 'are', 'consequences', 'always.Sir', 'Walter', 'Elliot', 'Lord', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'extravagant', 'self-aggrandizing', 'snob', 'bit', 'dandy', 'boot', 'been', 'widower', 'many', 'years', 'money', 'means', 'increase', 'social', 'stature', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'conceited', 'spoiled', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'capable', 'unassuming', 'woman', 'late', 'twenties', 'when', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'quite', 'pretty', 'one', 'time', 'life', 'disappointments', 'have', 'taken', 'toll', 'looks', 'are', 'fading', 'sister', 'are', 'single', 'Anne', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'young', 'yet', 'untried', 'navel', 'officer', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'close', 'friend', 'Anne', 'mother', 'persuaded', 'Anne', 'call', 'off', 'engagement', 'convincing', 'could', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'match', 'much', 'consideration', 'Anne', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'heart', 'better', 'instincts', 'young', 'officer', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'separated', 'never', 'again', 'found', 'mutual', 'love', 'companionship', 'had', 'him.The', 'Elliot', 'family', 'forced', 'financially', 'retrench', 'extravagance', 'lease', 'Kellynch', 'Hall', 'people', 'Wentworth', 'sister', 'husband', 'Elliot', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'companion', 'move', 'smaller', 'lodging', 'Bath', 'season', 'leaving', 'Anne', 'pack', 'up', 'belongings', 'joining', 'Cinderella', 'treatment', 'film', 'Anne', 'time', 'visit', 'middle', 'sister', 'abominably', 'spoiled', 'whiny', 'hypochondriac', 'Mrs.', 'Musgrove', 'made', 'good', 'not', 'brilliant', 'match', 'local', 'squire', 'Charles', 'Muskgrove', 'husband', 'parents', 'two', 'younger', 'eligible', 'daughters', 'Louisa', 'Henrietta', 'are', 'delightful', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'warm', 'scenes', 'family', 'friends', 'dining', 'dancing', 'hiking', 'gorgeous', 'countryside', 'seashore', 'bring', 'audience', 'smack', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'English', 'life', 'Muskgrove', 'estate', 'Anne', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'again', 'absence', 'seven', 'years', 'neighborhood', 'sister', 'now', 'area', 'residing', 'Kellynch', 'course', 'Wentworth', 'now', 'Captain', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'When', 'eyes', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'absolutely', 'feel', 'Anne', 'longing', 'remorse', 'Intense', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'better', 'actress', 'play', 'Anne', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'slowly', 'sallow', 'aging', 'spinster', 'luminescent', 'woman', 'love', 'Not', 'just', 'makeup', 'Wentworth/Hinds', 'aloof', 'Anne', 'civil', 'man', 'was', 'hurtfully', 'rejected', 'once', 'before', 'still', 'sting', 'snub', 'Now', 'Wentworth', 'marriage', 'market', 'Louisa', 'cap', 'Accidents', 'various', 'adventures', 'ensue', 'resorts', 'Lyme', 'Bath', 'Muskgrove', 'estate', 'bringing', 'Anne', 'Wentworth', 'closer', 'together', 'passion', 'two', 'palpable', 'Very', 'understated', 'Regency', 'England', 'Ms.', 'Root', 'perfect', 'Anne', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Hinds', 'best', 'possible', 'Wentworth', 'large', 'virile', 'petite', 'feminine', 'sexuality', 'again', 'character', 'great', 'subtlety', 'entire', 'production', 'brilliantly', 'cast', 'acting', 'superbI', 'think', 'Ms.', 'Austen', 'most', 'passionate', 'piece', 'scholars', 'say', 'modeled', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'herself.This', 'remarkable', 'film', 'novel', 'issues', 'just', 'germane', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'written', 'time', 'view', 'just', 'better', 'romance', 'well', 'one', 'romance', 'better', 'Jane', 'Austen']",Persuasion VHS

Yet Roger Michell's adaptation of &quot;Persuasion&quot; for the BBC is perhaps the most faithful of the many Austen adaptations that followed, and is still simultaneously the best. Like Patricia Rozema in :&quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; he brings great intelligence and brings forth certain latent ideas in the text that speak to the era in which he filmed it: he shows the grubbiness of the Regency era, and emphasizes the differences in class relations. But unlike Rozema, Michell has the good sense to trust Austen and allow his heroine to be as quiet and as patient as the author wrote her to be. Amanda Root, with her beautiful undertsanding eyes that speak volumes, is as faithful to Austen's conception of the role as could be imagined. The rest of the cast is terrific: Corin Redgrave enjoyed some well deserved praise later in his career for his snobbish and empty headed Sir Walter Elliot, and Phoebe Nicholls is just as good as his eldest daughter (given to fits of pique against her sister Anne).

393366,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6303965415,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 9]","PERSUASION is another in a series of film adaptations of Jane Austen novels that take place in the Regency England of the early 1800s, a world where landed gentleman bemoan the fact that they haven't sired sons to inherit the estate, and whose unmarried daughters moon about waiting for well-mannered, moneyed Hunks to come within striking distance.The lovelorn protagonist in this particular story is Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), the middle daughter of Walter (Corin Redgrave). Anne's mother being dead, the dominant female of Elliot's Kellynch Estate is Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls), Anne's older sister, who is becoming a sour and malicious Old Maid. However, Walter is financially strapped and must move the household to Bath, while renting out the Big House to Admiral Croft, since returned to land after the end of the latest squabble with France. While Walter and Elizabeth carriage off to their new digs, Anne visits with her younger sister, the selfish and silly Mary (Sophie Thompson), who's married to the son of another country gentleman, Mr. Musgrove, who himself has two unmarried daughters waiting for Prince Charming. As it so happens, Mrs. Croft (Fiona Shaw) has a brother, Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds), also in the Royal Navy. Eight years previous, Wentworth, then a junior officer with no financial prospects, and 19-year old Anne had a secret infatuation that ended when the latter reluctantly rejected the former's marriage proposal on the advice of a meddling socialite, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood). Wentworth, now holding the rank of Captain and possessing considerable means from the prize ships his command captured in the latest war, is back in town. Will his love affair with Anne be resurrected, or will he be snared by one of the Musgrove sisters? In the meantime, Anne is taking hits from William Elliot, her handsome cousin and heir apparent to Kellynch Estate.Whew! Have you got all of this written down?PERSUASION is impeccably acted, costumed and photographed, and, as such, should rightfully be ranked as one of the best of Austen's Big Screen soaps. In my opinion, however, it's flawed as an entertainment vehicle when compared with the recent cinematic versions of EMMA, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and MANSFIELD PARK. Anne failed to inspire in this viewer the admiration and affection engendered by the heroines of those others, who were individually more clever, more intelligent, more plucky, or more vivacious. Of single women in her position, Anne states, &quot;We live at home - quiet, confined - and our feelings prey upon us.&quot; Stewing in one's own juice is more like it, and Anne raises this exercise to an art form. Jeez, go out and get a job at Starbuck's already! And, while none of the JA epics are action thrillers by the wildest imagination, PERSUASION moves at a pace akin to rock formation.Perhaps the most interesting character is Mrs. Croft. At this point in history (1814), the Admiralty apparently had a policy of allowing its warship commanders to take their spouses along on deployments. Thus, the Admiral's wife has seen much of the world, much to the envy of the stay-at-home-and-be-wretched ladies. Unfortunately, Mrs. Croft has too little screen time and makes no effort to impart any wider perspective to sad sack Anne.I enjoyed PERSUASION to a certain degree for no other reason than it's an excellent period piece, but am thankful that it's the last of the Austen flicks that I'd obligated myself to see.",3,"Hey, sailor, looking for a good time?",1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,3497,"['PERSUASION', 'series', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'take', 'place', 'Regency', 'England', 'early', '1800s', 'world', 'where', 'landed', 'gentleman', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'sired', 'sons', 'inherit', 'estate', 'unmarried', 'daughters', 'moon', 'waiting', 'well-mannered', 'moneyed', 'Hunks', 'come', 'striking', 'distance.The', 'lovelorn', 'protagonist', 'particular', 'story', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'middle', 'daughter', 'Walter', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'Anne', 'mother', 'being', 'dead', 'dominant', 'female', 'Elliot', 'Kellynch', 'Estate', 'Elizabeth', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'Anne', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'becoming', 'sour', 'malicious', 'Old', 'Maid', 'However', 'Walter', 'financially', 'strapped', 'must', 'move', 'household', 'Bath', 'renting', 'out', 'Big', 'House', 'Admiral', 'Croft', 'returned', 'land', 'end', 'latest', 'squabble', 'France', 'Walter', 'Elizabeth', 'carriage', 'off', 'new', 'digs', 'Anne', 'younger', 'sister', 'selfish', 'silly', 'Mary', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'who', 'married', 'son', 'country', 'gentleman', 'Mr.', 'Musgrove', 'who', 'two', 'unmarried', 'daughters', 'waiting', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'so', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'brother', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'also', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'Eight', 'years', 'previous', 'Wentworth', 'then', 'junior', 'officer', 'financial', 'prospects', '19-year', 'old', 'Anne', 'had', 'secret', 'infatuation', 'ended', 'when', 'latter', 'reluctantly', 'rejected', 'former', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'advice', 'meddling', 'socialite', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Susan', 'Fleetwood', 'Wentworth', 'now', 'holding', 'rank', 'Captain', 'possessing', 'considerable', 'means', 'prize', 'command', 'captured', 'latest', 'war', 'back', 'town', 'Will', 'love', 'affair', 'Anne', 'be', 'resurrected', 'will', 'be', 'snared', 'one', 'Musgrove', 'sisters', 'meantime', 'Anne', 'taking', 'hits', 'William', 'Elliot', 'handsome', 'cousin', 'apparent', 'Kellynch', 'Estate.Whew', 'Have', 'got', 'written', 'down', 'PERSUASION', 'impeccably', 'acted', 'costumed', 'photographed', 'such', 'should', 'rightfully', 'be', 'ranked', 'one', 'best', 'Austen', 'Big', 'Screen', 'soaps', 'opinion', 'however', 'flawed', 'entertainment', 'vehicle', 'when', 'compared', 'recent', 'cinematic', 'versions', 'EMMA', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBILITY', 'MANSFIELD', 'PARK', 'Anne', 'failed', 'inspire', 'viewer', 'admiration', 'affection', 'engendered', 'heroines', 'others', 'who', 'were', 'individually', 'more', 'clever', 'more', 'intelligent', 'more', 'plucky', 'more', 'vivacious', 'single', 'women', 'position', 'Anne', 'states', 'quot', 'live', 'home', 'quiet', 'confined', 'feelings', 'prey', 'us.', 'quot', 'Stewing', 'one', 'own', 'juice', 'more', 'Anne', 'exercise', 'art', 'form', 'Jeez', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'job', 'Starbuck', 'already', 'none', 'JA', 'epics', 'are', 'action', 'thrillers', 'wildest', 'imagination', 'PERSUASION', 'pace', 'akin', 'rock', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'point', 'history', '1814', 'Admiralty', 'apparently', 'had', 'policy', 'allowing', 'warship', 'commanders', 'take', 'spouses', 'deployments', 'Thus', 'Admiral', 'wife', 'seen', 'much', 'world', 'much', 'envy', 'stay-at-home-and-be-wretched', 'ladies', 'Unfortunately', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'effort', 'impart', 'wider', 'perspective', 'sad', 'sack', 'Anne.I', 'enjoyed', 'PERSUASION', 'certain', 'degree', 'other', 'reason', 'excellent', 'period', 'piece', 'am', 'thankful', 'last', 'Austen', ""'d"", 'obligated', 'see']",Persuasion VHS

It's very short, rather sketchy, and involves a heroine, Anne, with whom I have very little in common. When I first saw this adaptation of the film, I'd just hopped across the lobby of my local theatreplex from a happy screening of the 1995 Sense and sensibility adaptation. The opening scenes of this film apalled me. The projectionist was probably to blame for much of this, but even if it were projected flawlessly, i don't think i could have forgiven the director for not being Ang Lee. ;o) The opening is dark...overcast...the camera angles are shaky. Amanda Root's Anne is small, mousy, and meek - the complete antithesis of my beautiful, spirited Marianne Dashwood and my energetic, naive Emma Woodhouse. Since that first viewing, my opinion of the adaptation has completely changed. This story is remarkably satisfying if you give it a chance...much like Anne, who is a little too easy to dismiss when you're enraptured by Marianne.

I only caught the tail end of it, but decided to buy this. As with the book which was written towards the end of Jane Austen's life, the movie portrayed an older and more somber young woman, with less of the sense of humor that filled her earlier books. Perhaps life had 'beaten' Austen down...she had not had the opportunity to marry, nor had her sister after her fiance had died overseas. Austen most probably died of breast cancer which may have been giving her problems by the time she was writing this book. Whatever the reason, this story lacked the joy of the earlier ones, and this movie was not the best portrayal of the book in comparison to the many other portrayals of the other books. It seemed very choppy and didn't tie all the information in together that the book did such as the fact that the protagonist's male cousin and the woman who befriended her sister and father were in cahoots.Maybe in a few years, someone else in England will see fit to produce this story again...they seem to like to redo Austen's stories on a regular basis.

393399,AHOBBFAUQU9IA,6303965415,Kt,"[1, 1]","I was not familiar with the Jane Austin novel that this movie was based on.This movie felt a little depressing and dragging.The plot is pretty bland.  The most interesting twists are learned about in hindsight by word of mouth so you have to be paying attention to catch it.  It's kind of like, most of the interesting parts about this story are not shown, and instead you watch the boring parts (mostly).This movie is basically a love story.  But there is no striving or drama.  Things just happen.I was confused by Anne's initial reaction to the suitor.  Her eyes were wide and it was a strange expression that seemed a bit extreme.  Once learning of the background, the acting at this part still does not seem appropriate.  Additionally, she did not have a lot of the expected reactions you would expect a character to have being put in her situations.  But I feel that this was due to the script more than the actress.  Her reactions were so downplayed that instead of being able to empathize with the lead, you just feel disconnected with the emotion behind the story at hand.The other characters were more flamboyant and you get the feeling that there is something special about the lead character.  But in the end you don't really get to know her except only fleetingly, and it is a bit of a let down.On the upside, this is a calm movie that will gently transport you to another time and place, and it is enough to lightly hold your interest as it soothes you.  You get to enjoy some nice scenes of the countryside and ocean.  The outside views were nice, but most of the insides of houses were dark or cold and a bit depressing.Overall, I didn't really like this movie very much.  If you are looking for a gentle calming period piece movie, you will probably like this.  If you are a fan of the novel you'll probably love it as others here do.

And one of my favorite period movies. And just one of my favorite movies! It's just that good. The cast is excellent. I love the look and feel of realism it has too, similar to the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Bright Star movies- realistic lighting, no makeup, messy  hair, etc.Every adaptation has its flaws, and I guess I should just get them out of the way beforehand. This film contains one big historical error! The sailors often go about in their naval uniforms. While this looks really nice on screen, it is actually not accurate. As we know from Mansfield Park, these uniforms could only be seen while the officers were on duty. Probably most casual viewers wouldn't know this and it's cool to see them though. Another issue that doesn't really bother me in particular is the somewhat lacking exposition. I feel a little bit, that this movie was written with book fans in mind. If you weren't already familiar with the story, you might find it a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, what was going on between Anne and Wentworth. As I said, I had no problem following anything but since I had already read the book that doesn't really mean much.The casting is admittedly not perfect. Many of the actors are a bit too old, but nothing jarring like in 1971. Their brilliant performances more than made up for this- with one big exception- Phoebe Nicholls as Elizabeth Elliot was way over the top.Both the canceled and actual ending of the book were used. Some liked the addition, but I could take it or leave it, personally. Some of the other changes from the book may have worked as just a movie, but were lacking for me as an adaptation. Actually, I can say that about pretty much everything- there's nearly nothing in this movie that I don't like as just a movie.Before I say again how much I love this movie (I ended up rewatching it 3 times!), I remembered another scene that bothered me. Anne is taken to Upper Cross in a farmer's cart instead of Lady Russell's carriage. Really? That was stretching it quite a bit.

Bernabo,"[7, 8]","Although it does not compete with the elegance of the theatrical releases of &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Emma,&quot; this 1996 BBC Films production of &quot;Persuasion&quot; has its own place in the Jane Austen revival of the past decade.  With Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) and Captain Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) we have the longest suffering set of lovers in all of Austen's domestic novels.  Eight years early Anne had been persuaded by a snobbish friend of the family to reject Wentworth as a suitor since he was a young naval officer with no prospects.  But now the financial fortunes of both parties are reversed, with the Elliots on the verge of bankruptcy and Wentworth a successful captain in the war against Napoleon, but their feelings for each other are unchanged.  It is just a question of when the two lovers will figure this out.Root and Hinds, both members of the Royal Shakespeare Company, bring the requisite maturity to their roles.  Anne Elliot is the quintessential Austen old maid, with a resigned acceptance of her fate and an inherent dignity in the face of life's little quirks that makes the happy ending all the more enjoyable.  This is one of those steady, unremarkable performances where you really forget Root is acting.  She simply is Anne.  Hinds has a marvelous scene where he puts aside the requirements of polite society to tell off the woman who thwarted his happiness.  As is a requirement with all BBC period piece productions, the supporting cast is superb, especially Sophie Thompson as Anne's hypochondriac sister Mary (this is another one of those Austen literary families where the heroine is the only worthwhile one in the lot).To me the most intriguing part of this adaptation is that it manages to incorporate both Austen's original and revised endings for the novel.  I must admit that I prefer the revised ending because for once she has the reconciliation of the two lovers be the result of one of them having the courage to tell the other one how they feel (albeit in a letter rather than face to face).  This was certainly quite different from Austen's usual tack of them accidentally learning about their true feelings for each other (e.g., &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;).  I always considered this to be evidence of Austen's maturity as a writer, but unfortunately the work was published posthumously.",4,Solid BBC Production incorporating BOTH of Austen's endings,971136000,"10 10, 2000",2000,2375,"['not', 'compete', 'elegance', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'quot', 'Sense', 'amp', 'Sensibility', 'quot', 'quot', 'Emma', 'quot', '1996', 'BBC', 'Films', 'production', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'own', 'place', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'revival', 'past', 'decade', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'have', 'longest', 'suffering', 'set', 'lovers', 'Austen', 'domestic', 'novels', 'Eight', 'years', 'early', 'Anne', 'had', 'been', 'persuaded', 'snobbish', 'friend', 'family', 'reject', 'Wentworth', 'suitor', 'was', 'young', 'naval', 'officer', 'prospects', 'now', 'financial', 'fortunes', 'parties', 'are', 'reversed', 'Elliots', 'verge', 'bankruptcy', 'Wentworth', 'successful', 'captain', 'war', 'Napoleon', 'feelings', 'other', 'are', 'unchanged', 'just', 'question', 'when', 'two', 'lovers', 'will', 'figure', 'out.Root', 'Hinds', 'members', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'bring', 'requisite', 'maturity', 'roles', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'quintessential', 'Austen', 'old', 'maid', 'resigned', 'acceptance', 'fate', 'inherent', 'dignity', 'face', 'life', 'little', 'quirks', 'happy', 'ending', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'steady', 'unremarkable', 'performances', 'where', 'really', 'forget', 'Root', 'acting', 'simply', 'Anne', 'Hinds', 'marvelous', 'scene', 'where', 'aside', 'requirements', 'polite', 'society', 'tell', 'off', 'woman', 'who', 'thwarted', 'happiness', 'As', 'requirement', 'BBC', 'period', 'piece', 'productions', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'especially', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'Anne', 'hypochondriac', 'sister', 'Mary', 'one', 'Austen', 'literary', 'families', 'where', 'heroine', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'lot', 'most', 'intriguing', 'part', 'adaptation', 'incorporate', 'Austen', 'original', 'revised', 'endings', 'novel', 'must', 'admit', 'prefer', 'revised', 'ending', 'once', 'reconciliation', 'two', 'lovers', 'be', 'result', 'one', 'having', 'courage', 'tell', 'other', 'one', 'how', 'feel', 'letter', 'rather', 'face', 'face', 'was', 'certainly', 'quite', 'different', 'Austen', 'usual', 'tack', 'accidentally', 'learning', 'true', 'feelings', 'other', 'e.g.', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'always', 'considered', 'be', 'evidence', 'Austen', 'maturity', 'writer', 'unfortunately', 'work', 'was', 'published', 'posthumously']",Persuasion VHS

393410,A2VG8F8TL6AYDR,6303965415,"""lexo-2""","[13, 15]","&quot;Persuasion&quot; is Jane Austen's most romantic and most overheated novel, which admittedly isn't to say that it's exactly &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; - but it does carry a stronger emotional undertow than any of her others.  As such, it also makes for a great movie.It was also her last novel, and if you want to be crudely autobiographical about it, it's a rather wistful revenge fantasy.  Anne Elliot, the only decent and sensible member of the cringingly awful Elliot family, has been fading into regretful spinsterhood ever since she refused marriage to a handsome Navy officer seven years earlier.  Now that her mother is dead and her snobbish roue of a father down on his luck, the family has to rent out the ancestral home (oh, the shame) to a crinkly, friendly Admiral, whose wife happens to be the sister of the man she turned down.  No sooner has Frederick Wentworth, the former suitor, now a successful and dashing Captain, strode back into Anne's life, than all her repressed feelings start to surge back.  With mortifying consequences.Nick Dear's adaptation was made for the BBC in the shadow of Andrew Davies' much more well-known (and more expensive) version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.  It's far better.  &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; ended up as an exercise in set dressing, with good performances defeated by lavish frocks and relentless background music.  &quot;Persuasion&quot; was shot entirely on location, using only natural light (the evening parties are all in authentic sepia-toned candlelight), and almost all the music is being played in the scene, instead of swamping bad writing with mood.  The characters get wind-blown and muddy and wet.  This isn't really a costume drama at all; the only things that seem alien are the manners.  A lot of this is presumably due to Roger Michell, the director.Yet Michell also throws the responsibility for conveying this almost entirely unspoken story onto his actors, who excel.  Amanda Root is superb as Anne.  She starts out as a red-faced, mildly haggard-looking spinster and blooms into a radiant heroine, and yet seems to do it entirely without makeup; her manner changes, her gestures and range of expressions become freer, and as her love gains control over her sense of duty, she turns, as it were, into her real self.  Ciaran Hinds is equally good as the impressively sideburned Wentworth; he goes from brusque and almost rude to desperately sincere.  The rest of the cast are distinguished; John Woodvine as the genial Admiral Croft, Fiona Shaw nicely underacting for a change as the Admiral's wife, Corin Redgrave as Anne's risibly pompous and snobbish father, Samuel West as the oleaginous creep of a suitor, Sophie Thompson as Anne's sniffy and hypochondriac sister, Simon Russell Beale as the bluff and endearingly clueless brother-in-law...everybody is good.This is a story told almost entirely by looks alone, and is as such a masterclass in acting, directing and editing.  Easily one of the best Jane Austen adaptations ever, and incidentally one of the most satisfying British films of the 90s.  You can watch it again and again and keep picking up on something you'd missed before.  I'd even say - and you're entitled to shriek and storm off in a petulant frenzy - that in its technical excellence and emotional generosity, it's a better work of art than the original novel.",5,Shamefully underrated,972950400,"10 31, 2000",2000,3380,"['quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'most', 'romantic', 'most', 'overheated', 'novel', 'admittedly', ""n't"", 'say', 'exactly', 'quot', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'quot', 'carry', 'stronger', 'emotional', 'undertow', 'others', 'such', 'also', 'great', 'movie.It', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'novel', 'want', 'be', 'crudely', 'autobiographical', 'rather', 'wistful', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'only', 'decent', 'sensible', 'member', 'cringingly', 'awful', 'Elliot', 'family', 'been', 'fading', 'regretful', 'spinsterhood', 'ever', 'refused', 'marriage', 'handsome', 'Navy', 'officer', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'Now', 'mother', 'dead', 'snobbish', 'roue', 'father', 'down', 'luck', 'family', 'rent', 'out', 'ancestral', 'home', 'oh', 'shame', 'crinkly', 'friendly', 'Admiral', 'wife', 'be', 'sister', 'man', 'turned', 'down', 'sooner', 'Frederick', 'Wentworth', 'former', 'suitor', 'now', 'successful', 'dashing', 'Captain', 'strode', 'back', 'Anne', 'life', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'start', 'surge', 'back', 'mortifying', 'consequences.Nick', 'Dear', 'adaptation', 'was', 'made', 'BBC', 'shadow', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'much', 'more', 'well-known', 'more', 'expensive', 'version', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'far', 'better', 'quot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'quot', 'ended', 'up', 'exercise', 'set', 'dressing', 'good', 'performances', 'defeated', 'lavish', 'frocks', 'relentless', 'background', 'music', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'location', 'using', 'only', 'natural', 'light', 'evening', 'parties', 'are', 'authentic', 'sepia-toned', 'candlelight', 'almost', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'scene', 'instead', 'swamping', 'bad', 'writing', 'mood', 'characters', 'get', 'wind-blown', 'muddy', 'wet', ""n't"", 'really', 'costume', 'drama', 'only', 'things', 'seem', 'alien', 'are', 'manners', 'lot', 'presumably', 'due', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'director.Yet', 'Michell', 'also', 'responsibility', 'conveying', 'almost', 'entirely', 'unspoken', 'story', 'actors', 'who', 'excel', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'superb', 'Anne', 'out', 'red-faced', 'mildly', 'haggard-looking', 'spinster', 'blooms', 'radiant', 'heroine', 'yet', 'do', 'entirely', 'makeup', 'manner', 'changes', 'gestures', 'range', 'expressions', 'become', 'freer', 'love', 'gains', 'control', 'sense', 'duty', 'were', 'real', 'self', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'equally', 'good', 'impressively', 'sideburned', 'Wentworth', 'brusque', 'almost', 'rude', 'desperately', 'sincere', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'distinguished', 'John', 'Woodvine', 'genial', 'Admiral', 'Croft', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'nicely', 'underacting', 'change', 'Admiral', 'wife', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'Anne', 'risibly', 'pompous', 'snobbish', 'father', 'Samuel', 'West', 'oleaginous', 'creep', 'suitor', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'Anne', 'sniffy', 'hypochondriac', 'sister', 'Simon', 'Russell', 'Beale', 'bluff', 'endearingly', 'clueless', 'brother-in-law', 'everybody', 'good.This', 'story', 'told', 'almost', 'entirely', 'alone', 'such', 'masterclass', 'acting', 'directing', 'editing', 'Easily', 'one', 'best', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'incidentally', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'British', 'films', '90s', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'keep', 'picking', 'up', 'something', ""'d"", 'missed', 'before', ""'d"", 'even', 'say', ""'re"", 'entitled', 'shriek', 'storm', 'off', 'petulant', 'frenzy', 'technical', 'excellence', 'emotional', 'generosity', 'better', 'work', 'art', 'original', 'novel']",Persuasion VHS
393411,A3JMK6UNBPS9X,6303965415,L. Gutman,"[1, 2]","Persuasion is possibly my favorite Jane Austen novel, with its story of love triumphing over bad choices and inhospitable surroundings. I've read the book several times and still cheer for Anne as she slowly overcomes her family and reaches out to her one true love.This is not a story that gets adapted for the big or little screen very often. It's a rambling story with no one central location and a lot of subplots that make up the tapestry of the story. The heroine is so virtuous she's almost too good to be true, and yet she has to be engaging and clearly wounded by life or you won't want to follow her for the whole story. And -- most important, I think -- it's almost impossible to capture the romantic lead, Captain Wentworth, onscreen. He's a bit of an enigma throughout Austen's novel, but he has to motivate the entire story. Producing Persuasion on screen is just as challenging, in it way, as producing Jane Eyre -- most of the Jane Eyre adaptations out there just don't capture Rochester, and without Rochester there is no story.This 1994 BBC production of Persuasion hits it out of the park on all these fronts. Most obviously, Ciaran Hinds IS Wentworth, injured by love but a dynamic, powerful man. Through his sheer physical presence, subtle acting and the spot-on dialog he's given (most of it lifted directly from the book), he's completely believable as a man tormented by an old love rekindled, but also he's no wilting Romantic poet -- this is a man you could see commanding a ship of the line, a man who is rising through the naval hierarchy like a rocket, the James T. Kirk of the early 19th century.Anne Elliot, as played by Amanda Root, is a similarly successful character. She's a wounded bird, large-eyed and wasting away, but through the writing of her dialog (again, mostly lifted intact from the book) and the sweet, engaging performance, she's immensely likeable and also (very important) believable as a woman of her time. Very slowly over the course of the movie, she blossoms into a beautiful, strong person not afraid to step out of the long shadow cast by her family.And finally, the writing of this adaptation is wonderful. Somehow, the whole complicated story gets tucked up into a few hours, and yes there are some events omitted or streamlined, but none of the subplots are lost, the secondary characters are three-dimensional and true to the period, and it's all done at a liesurely pace that is true to Austen.So, all in all -- if you're a fan of Austen and especially her novel Persuasion, this is the movie for you.

Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth smolders with contained bitterness and resentment in Anne's company and yet is still perceptive and open enough to forgive the pain her rejection caused him [ personally, I've loved Hinds' work since seeing him in December Bride and find him most attractive ]. How they find their way back to each other is at the heart of the story--and it is so lovely and touching that even though I knew the plot --and have seen the movie countless times--my heart always thunders with anxiety during the final scenes prior to that exquisitely tender final kiss.The supporting cast is terrific and the screenplay to my mind is even better than the unfinished book. If you are tired of surface prettiness and gloss and want to see life as it truly may have been lived in the early 19th century, then this adaptation is for you.

Of all the Jane Austen features of the last six years or so, this is my personal favorite; in fact, it's one of my ten most favorite movies. It has an intimate feel to it that the other films, good though they are, lack. A wonderful example of this is the scene at the Great House, where the characters are assembled for a dinner given by the Musgroves. The flickering of the candles and the low ceilings convey a gathering where good conversation among genial people flourishes, somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Babette's Feast&quot;.&quot;Persuasion&quot; concerns Anne Elliot and her lost love, Captain Wentworth. Eight years before the start of the picture, she had refused his marriage proposal, having been persuaded by a family friend that it would be an unsuitable match. Anne, you see, is the daughter of a baronet, while Edward is of no particular lineage. During these years, she has lost both her spirits and her looks, we are told. Then, chance brings Edward back into her life, but as the suitor of a family friend, a much younger woman who is quite vivacious--and he bears a grudge against Anne for her lack of personal conviction. Like all Jane Austen novels, the story then hinges upon whether a hopeless romantic situation can be brought round to our satisfaction.&quot;Persuasion&quot; is the sort of film you can watch again and again, just as if you were visiting with an old friend.

I'm not, which partly explains why I'm not satisfied by it. I say this as someone who has read all six novels and who enjoys almost all of the adaptations, including the old BBC ones.I picture Wentworth as a livelier, younger-seeming man, a smile never far away. Someone you'd enjoy being around. Hinds' portrayal is rather dour, even cold. In the scene at the Bath concert, where Anne's cousin is paying her attentions, Anne practically begs him to stay, but he is cold to the point of humiliation. Sorry, at that point I wouldn't care if he came back or not.Amanda Root would not be my first choice for Anne. I pictured her as a bit more elegant and poised. However, I did like her better with repeated viewing.It's a fairly small budget production, and for some reason they often shot in small, cramped, dark locations. I believe this was to give it a realistic feel, but it only succeeded in contributing to a dark, claustrophobic mood.One other (small) criticism I had was the scene with Lady Dalrymple and her daughter. It was over the top. Lady Dalrymple especially looked like she belonged in an opium den. I guess it was supposed to be humorous, but it gave me the creeps. The point of those characters was to satirize wealth, connection and snobbery. It seemed pointless to make them so weird.So, on the whole, I would watch other Austen adaptations before this one.

There is the usual romance, set in 1814 England, and the cinematography, costumes and scenes are beautiful.  It is a story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) who is the spinster daughter of a aristocratic family having money issues.  The father has been widowed and spends far too much money, so the family have to rent the estate and move to smaller quarters.It turns out Anne was once engaged to Frederic Wentworth, who was deemed too beneath her by family.  She had to break her engagement eight years prior.  He was a young sea captain at the time, but now, after eight years, he has made a fortune and become successful.  All the young ladies want his attention and company.  Due to the change in her family's fortune, Anne is thrown again into company of Frederic, and there are some indications that he is still  in love with her.  The movie has many facial close-ups and much of the acting is quiet emoting.  There is some humor and irony in the story, but it moves far too slowly and the plot is not that strong.  The period is captured and somewhat educational as it mentions Napoleon isolated on the isle of Elba and a war that is brewing.Overall this is not as good as the other Jane Austen stories, plus the movie has a few audio problems in the first few scenes.

""MarcyG""","[4, 5]","Jane Austen's wonderful novels have been adapted many times over and many recent adaptations have been excellent. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is one of those heartwarming and romantic love stories that you'll want to revisit again and again.This is a story of Anne Eliott, second daughter to a debt-ridden baronet.  She fell in love with the dashing and handsome Frederick Wentworth at age 19 but was persuaded to break the engagement because of his limited prospects.  She is, after all, from a noble family while he has a far humbler background.9 years later, Anne is still unmarried and considered a spinster at age 28.  A visit to her younger sister Mary puts her in the path of Frederick - now a successful navy captain.  She discovers that she is still in love with him but he appears civil but cold (not having forgiven her for breaking his heart).You'll have to watch the movie to find out how it all turns out but I guarantee that you will find this a thoroughly romantic and enjoyable period piece.  The acting is topnotch and it has the high production values that you would find in an A&amp;E or BBC production. If you've read the book, you will find that this adaptation is very faithful to its source.I would also recommend &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; (Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet), &quot;Emma&quot; (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the fantastic &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth) to round out a great selection of Jane Austen films.

I had just come off of seeing the fabled A and E version of Pride and Prejudice and was expecting more of the same - pretty people in lavish costumes exchanging witty bantor in lovely houses. What I got was average looking and mostly vulgar people in a slow-moving storyline where it seemed like nothing would ever happen. It wasn't until repeated viewings that I came to appreciate the subtleties of this film, and the fact that the casting choices and even the almost agonizing pace were an absolutely perfect and right way to bring this novel to the screen.For you see, the story revolves around Anne, an aging woman on the verge of spinsterhood who is quite unexpectedly thrown into the company of an old lover, Captain Wentworth. This is not some fiery attraction aka Mr Darcy and Elizabeth, but rather a slow-burning tension that both parties are trying to repress throughout the film for fear of being shot down. The acting by both leads is superb (watch for the scene when Anne sees Captain Wentworth for the first time in eight years and has to grab a chair for support). And it is lovely to see the almost-dowdy Anne slowly blossom as the film goes on.And while I mentioned that overall this is not a funny piece, of course there are a few inspired Austen characters. My favorites are Anne's sister Mary, who is always supposing herself sick, and Anne's father who has some of the best lines in the movie (""Anne?? You want to marry ANNE?

Alas true love never goes away...The cast is impressive, Amanda Root, Ciaran Hinds, Corin Redgrave, Phoebe Nicolls, Sam West, Sophie Thompson, Judy Cornwell, the late Susan Fleetwood to name a few, all fine actors and actresses.My favorite part of the entire movie is the kiss near the end, it sums up the entire story....first hesitant,  then tender, then sweet - then at last.... surrender !",5,Forget all of the other versions of Persuasion...this is the best,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,1007,"['interest', 'watched', 'latest', 'production', 'Persuasion', 'broadcast', 'Masterpiece', 'anybody', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'word', 'Theatre', 'PBS', 'have', 'dropped', 'January', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'acting.This', 'version', 'Persuasion', 'still', 'best', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'wonderful', 'job', 'going', 'someone', 'everyone', 'really', 'desperately', 'woman', 'who', 'mistake', 'being', 'persuaded', 'turn', 'Capt', 'Wentworth', 'down', '8', 'years', 'earlier', 'someone', 'who', 'amends', 'just', 'entire', 'length', 'movie', 'Amanda', 'speak', 'up', 'end', 'Alas', 'true', 'love', 'never', 'away', 'cast', 'impressive', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'Phoebe', 'Nicolls', 'Sam', 'West', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'Judy', 'Cornwell', 'late', 'Susan', 'Fleetwood', 'name', 'few', 'fine', 'actors', 'actresses.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'kiss', 'end', 'sums', 'up', 'entire', 'story', '.first', 'hesitant', 'then', 'tender', 'then', 'sweet', 'then', 'last', 'surrender']",Persuasion VHS
393455,A1QBGC59TFPHD8,6303965415,"M. Lichlyter ""Colorado Gran""","[1, 2]","There are over 400 Amazon reviews for this movie!  More than 400 people have had opinions to express, which should make anyone interested in seeing it for that reason alone.  I'll put my two cents' worth in as well.As with any production of an Austen (or any other) book, a film is a re-telling.  The same story (presumably) is being told by a different storyteller.  That automatically makes for some differences.That being said, I truly enjoy this movie.  I love the book, and this production is true to the original story in most respects - something important to me.  The cinematography is excellent; it would be a joy to look at even if one did not care for anything else.  I really enjoy the score as well.The acting is quite good.  Many writers have commented on the characterizations; some of them are not what I would have preferred, but none are too far afield from the author's descriptions (for example, Elizabeth is described by the author as ""repulsive,"" although I might not have built a characterization solely on that word).  The intent of the production was obviously that the actors should not be ""pretty"" but as much like ""real folks"" as possible, for better or for worse.  That, too, is all right, although one may not like it as much seeing them larger than life.To me, the major flaw in this retelling is where it deviates from the original.  Perhaps for reasons of uncomplicating the story (and/or for time considerations), the character of Mrs. Smith was changed from a desperate woman misused by Mr. Elliot to a mere featherbrained, gossipy friend; the plot line was changed so that Mr. Elliot now wants to marry Anne for her money.  This simply does not make sense; Mr. Elliot would not have wanted Anne for her money because he knew her father had spent practically all of it already.  The writers dropped the ball with a thud in this respect, and it's difficult for such a gaffe to be overlooked or excused by anyone familiar with the book.But would I recommend this film?  Yes.  Those who are put off by early-19th-century English - who can't plow through all the now-strange words and idioms - get their best introduction to Jane Austen's works through quality productions such as this one.

393458,A3OBSF9YJRNKXH,6303965415,M. O Schmidt,"[5, 15]","First let me state the obvious: I am a fan of Jane Austen, and have been for 30 years.  Secondly, let me state that the first viewing of this adaptation had all the charm of an impacted wisdom tooth.  Unless you are well acquainted with the story, you will be monumentally confused the first time you see it.  This is not a film you can go into blind, because it won't give you any help with what is going on. Oh how the British  love the device of implication and assumed history.  Neither will be much help in understanding this.  The people that I watched this with found it extremely confusing and discordant, and I did too, even though I have read the book many times over the years.  Most of my audience kept complaining that the people looked too British.  If ever there were a cast of singularly unattractive people, this is it.  Anne Elliot looks not so much faded, as enbalmed and brought back from the dead for this performance and I found Frederick Wentworth podgy, buck toothed and very unappealing.  And those were his good points.  This film is chock full of people who seem able to vent with great abandon unless honesty would clear everything up in two seconds flat.  At which times they look tortured and constipated.  The director and writer also saw fit to change things from the book, and none of the adaptations were an improvement.Having slammed their physical appearance, I must say that the people in Hollywood would have cast actors with physical appeal and no substance.  The British cast on the basis of talent, and even if the actors are not particularly handsome, they grow on you.  I can not think of one person who did not do a very good job,  and although I found Anne and Frederick's tortured looks, gaping, gawking, and inability to communicate, extremely irritating, I am inclined to blame the director more than the actors.  Captain Benwick was very good, but he reminded me of the Pillsbury Doughboy playing dress-up.  Anne's eldest sister, Elizabeth, was shrill, annoying and petulantly unattractive.  In short, perfect for the part.  The murkiness and evocative moods, reminded me of Wuthering Heights meets Frederico Fellini.  Brooding and bizarre.If you can over-look dentition, physicality, and mood swings, you will like this movie.  It has a certain  jarring charm, mostly superb acting, interesting wardrobe, and it is unpretentious.  It doesn't care whether you like it or not.  I did, and although my daughter will not watch it with me, my husband very much enjoyed it, and he has watched it with me more than once.  This is the only  Persuasion that I could find, and if you can overlook some things, you will find yourself drawn to it again and again.  The ending is not what I would have done, nor do people in Austen novels kiss on the streets of Bath. In the book, Anne did not seem as wimpy and  irksome as in this.  I frequently wanted to slap her.

At the beginning of the movie, Root's Anne is timid, often self-effacing, and her physical appearance is, frankly, plain. Thoroughout the course of the film, as she rediscovers her feelings for Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds)she becomes more animated and self-assured, and by the end of the movie, sure of the captain's love, she positively blooms again. I liked the cast in general, although I thought that Hinds may have been an older Captain Wentworth than Austen envisioned. Corin Redgrave gave his usual excellent performance as the vain and foppish father of Anne and Elizabeth. I did not care for Phoebe Nicholls interpretation of Elizabeth Elliott, however. Ms Nicholls, who was so brilliant in &quot;Brideshead Revisited,&quot; played Elizabeth (who is in her late 20s) as a spoiled teenager who would have been more at home in the Los Angeles of the 1990s than early 19th century England. Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma) and Fiona Shaw were outstanding as Mary Musgrove and Mrs. Croft, respectively.The film makers did take some liberties with the story....it has been commented on several times by critics that Anne and the Captain never kissed in Austen's novel. While this is true, most of the film adaptations of Austen's works that I have seen include scenes of kissing between men and women who have come to an understanding of their love for each other. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is certainly a more faithful adaptation of Austen than is &quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; which was released about the same time, probably because it does not have a political ax to grind.",4,A Worthy Adaptation of a Favorite Book,1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,1819,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Persuasion.', 'quot', 'other', 'reviewers', 'site', 'found', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'be', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', 'Anne', 'Elliott', 'who', 'had', 'quot', 'lost', 'bloom', 'quot', 'age', '27', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Root', 'Anne', 'timid', 'often', 'self-effacing', 'physical', 'appearance', 'frankly', 'plain', 'course', 'film', 'feelings', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'more', 'animated', 'self-assured', 'end', 'movie', 'sure', 'captain', 'love', 'positively', 'blooms', 'again', 'liked', 'cast', 'general', 'thought', 'Hinds', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'older', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'Austen', 'envisioned', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'gave', 'usual', 'excellent', 'performance', 'vain', 'foppish', 'father', 'Anne', 'Elizabeth', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Phoebe', 'Nicholls', 'interpretation', 'Elizabeth', 'Elliott', 'however', 'Ms', 'Nicholls', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'quot', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'late', '20s', 'spoiled', 'teenager', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'home', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1990s', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'sister', 'Emma', 'Fiona', 'Shaw', 'were', 'outstanding', 'Mary', 'Musgrove', 'Mrs.', 'Croft', 'respectively.The', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'take', 'liberties', 'story', '.it', 'been', 'commented', 'several', 'times', 'critics', 'Anne', 'Captain', 'never', 'kissed', 'Austen', 'novel', 'true', 'most', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Austen', 'works', 'have', 'seen', 'include', 'scenes', 'kissing', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'understanding', 'love', 'other', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'certainly', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'quot', 'Mansfield', 'Park', 'quot', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'probably', 'not', 'have', 'political', 'ax', 'grind']",Persuasion VHS

(If you want to know the rest of the line, then rent the movie).During her lifetime Jane Austen published her novels anonymously - a choice common for female authors of that time.  One of my favorite college professors had a sentence on a piece of paper on his office door.  It said, ""I'd rather be reading Jane Austen.""  In the early 1800s, before psychology was a science, Jane Austen, an unmarried young woman, had the audacity to publish her thoughts on the workings of the inner mind.This is an excellent movie adaptation of Austen's final novel, a novel she wrote when her health was failing and she probably knew she had little time left to express what she had to say.

Other movies in that category include Emma Thompson's Sense & Sensibility (to which Ms. Thompson added many of her own sensibilities to the screenplay).Austen's characters are often caught up in an internal dialogue, constantly re-evaluating the decisions of the past.  In Austen's era, these thoughts were made more desperate and consequential because romantic love could only be found in one other person.  Her characters are constantly jockeying to gain power, stature, & wealth through social, exclusivity contracts.  For Austen's characters, the one person is usually separated by distance, time, or rules of society.  Austen comments on how the mind seems to concentrate on the imprinted loves of the past (See Spielberg's ""A.I."").  Her heroines tend to think there was a person in their past whose character so well matched their own, that to be reunited would bring some fulfilment.  And in her novels, often the two are combined in the end, defying the odds and rewarding their moral behavior and steadfastness.  The reader can see that the two are not just imprinted on each other;  rather, there are many good reasons why their chemistry works well.""Captain Wentworth . . . You have an extraodinary ability to discompose my friend sir.""This is true.  The book is titled ""Persuasion"".  It is not titled ""Control"".  The protagonists in the movie argue regularly with the intent to be persuasive, not to be controlling - and that is an essential distinction.""Perhaps you have not been in Bath long enough to learn to enjoy these parties they give.""""They mean nothing to me.  Those who hold them believe the theatre to be beneath their dignity, but I am no card player.""""No.  You never were, were you?""Jane Austen, as a young woman was a genius ahead of her time, and in some ways is still ahead of our time.  Great authors and artists find a way to speak to their generation in a way that both respects the status quo, yet somehow uses metaphor or narrative to look on the status quo's priorities from a new perspective.  For example, Willa Cather's ""My Antonia"" may be one of the first great works of lesbian literature (although most people would probably disagree with me).  That book certainly is not written from an ordinary male ""voice"", even if the narrator is male.  Similarly, Jane Austen questioned every social construct around her and tried to illustrate the conflicts that the social systems created against the natural, moral drives of the human psyche.  Her debate has fascinated us for hundreds of years.The movie is not about ""old, boring people who lived hundreds of years ago.""  Like all her novels, this movie is robust and a worthwhile social discourse today.Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related works.",5,Persuasion,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,3993,"['Good', 'company', 'always', 'worth', 'seeking', 'idea', 'good', 'company', 'fellowship', 'clever', 'well', 'informed', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'conversation', 'liberality', 'ideas', 'what', 'call', 'good', 'company', 'not', 'good', 'company', 'want', 'know', 'rest', 'line', 'then', 'rent', 'movie', '.During', 'lifetime', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'published', 'novels', 'anonymously', 'choice', 'common', 'female', 'authors', 'time', 'One', 'favorite', 'college', 'professors', 'had', 'sentence', 'piece', 'paper', 'office', 'door', 'said', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'reading', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'early', '1800s', 'psychology', 'was', 'science', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'unmarried', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'audacity', 'publish', 'thoughts', 'workings', 'inner', 'mind.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'final', 'novel', 'novel', 'wrote', 'when', 'health', 'was', 'failing', 'probably', 'knew', 'had', 'little', 'time', 'left', 'express', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'Reading', 'cast', 'list', 'movie', 'Who', 'who', 'great', 'actors', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Corin', 'Redgrave', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'etc', 'acting', 'terrific', 'are', 'certain', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'comment', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'improved', 'commentary', 'Other', 'movies', 'category', 'include', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Ms.', 'Thompson', 'added', 'many', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'screenplay', '.Austen', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'caught', 'up', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'constantly', 're-evaluating', 'decisions', 'past', 'Austen', 'era', 'thoughts', 'were', 'made', 'more', 'desperate', 'consequential', 'romantic', 'love', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'jockeying', 'gain', 'power', 'stature', 'wealth', 'social', 'exclusivity', 'contracts', 'Austen', 'characters', 'one', 'person', 'usually', 'separated', 'distance', 'time', 'rules', 'society', 'Austen', 'comments', 'how', 'mind', 'concentrate', 'imprinted', 'loves', 'past', 'See', 'Spielberg', 'A.I.', 'heroines', 'tend', 'think', 'was', 'person', 'past', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'matched', 'own', 'be', 'reunited', 'would', 'bring', 'fulfilment', 'novels', 'often', 'two', 'are', 'combined', 'end', 'defying', 'odds', 'rewarding', 'moral', 'behavior', 'steadfastness', 'reader', 'can', 'see', 'two', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'imprinted', 'other', 'rather', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'reasons', 'why', 'chemistry', 'well', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'have', 'extraodinary', 'ability', 'discompose', 'friend', 'sir', 'true', 'book', 'titled', 'Persuasion', 'not', 'titled', 'Control', 'protagonists', 'movie', 'regularly', 'intent', 'be', 'persuasive', 'not', 'be', 'controlling', 'essential', 'distinction', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'Bath', 'long', 'enough', 'learn', 'enjoy', 'parties', 'give', 'mean', 'nothing', 'who', 'hold', 'believe', 'theatre', 'be', 'beneath', 'dignity', 'am', 'card', 'player.', 'No', 'never', 'were', 'were', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'genius', 'ahead', 'time', 'ways', 'still', 'ahead', 'time', 'Great', 'authors', 'artists', 'find', 'way', 'speak', 'generation', 'way', 'status', 'quo', 'somehow', 'metaphor', 'narrative', 'look', 'status', 'quo', 'priorities', 'new', 'perspective', 'example', 'Willa', 'Cather', 'Antonia', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'great', 'works', 'lesbian', 'literature', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'disagree', 'book', 'certainly', 'not', 'written', 'ordinary', 'male', 'voice', 'even', 'narrator', 'male', 'Similarly', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'questioned', 'social', 'construct', 'tried', 'illustrate', 'conflicts', 'social', 'systems', 'created', 'natural', 'moral', 'drives', 'human', 'psyche', 'debate', 'fascinated', 'hundreds', 'years.The', 'movie', 'not', 'old', 'boring', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ago', 'novels', 'movie', 'robust', 'worthwhile', 'social', 'discourse', 'today.Please', 'comment', 'express', 'feedback', 'suggest', 'related', 'works']",Persuasion VHS

I did have a little trouble figuring out the cast of characters in the beginning and the backstory, which is of prime importance, was not sufficiently emphasized.  The title, ""Persuasion,"" comes from the fact that the heroine, Anne, had been persuaded by an older woman who had stepped in as a surrogate mother, to refuse the proposal of marriage from a Captain Wentworth on the grounds that he was socially inferior to her family.I guess I should have turned on the subtitles, earlier than I did, because I got the impression that the refused suitor was Wentworth's brother, a cleric.  Both clerics and sailors were considered to be unsuitable to Anne's advisor as well as to her super-snobby father.  So, when the Captain appeared, eight years later, I had a hard time understanding Anne's shocked demeanor.So I can't blame the film entirely for my cluelessness for the first part of the film.  However I do blame the film for the casting.  Amanda Root, cast at the heroine, plays lackluster to such an extreme that one wonders what the Captain ever saw in her, let alone the fact that he carried a flame for her for the entire eight years of his absence.  True, she's a little depressed, but she's still young, in her twenties and most girls at that age have a little more spunk and color than she had.  She has turned into such a self-sacrificing drudge that one conjures up visions of Cinderella, especially when she's surrounded by the juicy, joyful and colorful girls who are her companions.The Captain, played by the wonderful Ciaran Hinds, seems awfully old to be her suitor, but I suppose that older men frequently married young girls at that time.  There is zero chemistry between them and one wonders what a different film it would have been if a more interesting, lively, actress had been cast as Anne.  True, they put makeup on her later on and give her nicer clothes and a prettier hairstyle but she still emanates as much joy and passion as a piece of unbuttered toast.  She certainly embodies strength of character and reliability, but gee, give the Captain some reason to overlook all the other beauties and settle for her.  From the other reviewers who read the novel, I got the impression that Austen had written Anne as a much livelier young woman.Other than that, it,s a good enough story, the rest of the cast is very good, the scenery is wonderful and the whole production lives up to what we have come to expect from British productions of classics.

I just accept that I often feel like Anne Elliot, and have been often treated like her by family members (""Ask Anne for advice?  Why?"").  It's also the most profound of her books, with themes of lost love and disappointment mixed in with the haunting images of Lyme.  This movie (a superb DVD transfer) simply astonishes on every level.  The acting is superb down to the smallest role (Mrs. Smith's nurse is a hoot!).  Amanda Root captures Anne's intelligence and lost bloom without ever begging our sympathy; she's too accomplished and intelligent a creature to enlist simple bathos.  Her transformation is so subtle, from sad soon-to-be spinster to woman in love, and yet so complete that she literally seems to come alive right before our eyes.  Ciaran Hinds is a very likeable Captain Wentworth, a true man's man but with enough sensitivity to love his male friends and not shrink from saying so--a true sign of masculine strength and security.  Sir Walter is a vain, abrasive fellow, but in the hands of Corin Redgrave remains watchable and funny; Fiona Shaw is a marvel in her few scenes as Sophie Croft, Wentworth's sister, and it's always a treat to see Judy Cornwell away from the low class frump she played so well on ""Keeping Up Appearances"".  Great, spare music and gorgeous cinematography complement director Roger Michell's sure hand--he never steps wrong in this splendid adaptation.

393484,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,6303965415,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[45, 46]","Anne Elliot, a shy, unassuming and unmarried ""old maid"" of 27, lives a quiet life in the country with her noble family, at Kellynch Hall.  That is, until the state of her family's finances (""You must retrench!"") forces them to move from their lavish home in the country, to the not-quite-so-comparable comfort of Bath, in order to rent out their home (and get themselves out of debt).  The new tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral & Mrs. Croft, whose brother, Fredrick Wentworth, Anne had been engaged to at the tender young age of 19.  Anne had reluctantly broken off their engagement at her family & friends' persuasion, as ""he had nothing to recommend him: no fortune, no connections"" and her spirits were said to have ""never been high, since...your disappointment.""  When Captain Fredrick Wentworth returns from 8 years at sea, with elevated social status and newly-acquired wealth, his appearance sparks a series of events in the lives of all the Elliot girls: Elizabeth, Mary & most of all Anne...When I saw this film as a teenager with my mom & friend at an independent theater outside Washington, D.C., I came out with a sense that this was one of the better films out there.  That this was the type of film I had been looking for all my life: a wonderfully done, well-filmed, superbly-acted ""period piece""...I must say that ""Persuasion"" was likely the start of it all for me.  ""Persuasion,"" which was then followed closely by Emma Thompson's ""Sense & Sensibility,"" had me hooked: I had been given the bait and I had fallen for it.  From that point on, I became a huge fan of period films: I have since consumed every well-known and obscure period film I could possibly get my hands on, but it all goes back to that first theatrical viewing of ""Persuasion"".The dialog is amazing!  The subtle ways that the Elliot family persecute Anne are beyond compare: I have never again to this day, seen such a brilliant exercise in underlying snubs & barbs: slight criticisms & faint scorns from Anne's family that are never rude or direct but are always subtle and seemingly innocuous (although they often cut to the quick).  Anne takes them so well, and clearly loves her family in spite of it all.  The scenes are beautifully filmed, the costuming well-done, and the scenery breathtaking.  The scene where Anne reads the letter is so touching!  And I must say the true-to-the-period ending scenes are simply wonderful: Jane Austen would have been proud!For those of you worried about family-friendly content: no need to worry!  There is little to object to in this film: there are very, very suble allusions to a possible liaison, so subtle that most never discover them.  There is a scene where a young lady falls and hurts herself; there is a little language: a few uses of d*mn, and little else.This quiet, unobtrusive, slow-moving, delight of film gem is well worth any time you devote to it: when watching for the first time, I would recommend giving it your full attention and not being too tired.  It is very mellow & quiet, and may take you awhile to get into, but will be well worth the effort in the end.  ""Persuasion"" would have to be one of my favorite period pieces of all time, along with ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""North & South.""

There have been several versions, and a more recent one for Masterpiece Classic had some great moments as well, but this really is the topper. Amanda Root is completely perfect as the small, quiet, dutiful daughter still suffering from her broken engagement years past. Her foppish father, by the late, great Michael Redgrave is equally spot on, with his arrogant proclamations. Her friend, Lady Russell, played by the late Susan Fleetwood, is wonderful, as she continues to &#34;guide&#34; Ann. I think one of the movie's strongest features is how realistic it seems. The clothes, the sets, the ease in which the actors interact, makes it appear as if it was all real, and not the result of a great novel. The actors aren't made up to be exquisitely beautiful--instead they all look quite natural, makeup and surgery free. It's another detail that makes this movie truly realistic and wonderful. You can feel the pain that Ann carries, and how her family ignores her. And you will adore Captain Wentworth, played with such intensity by Ciarin Hinds, another fantastic British actor.

From the sunlit kitchen tables to the birds chirping at the country estates, you will find the atmosphere and sound very realistic.This is the story of two people seeking a second chance at happiness and almost seeming to pass by one another like two ships in the night. Neither is willing to say what they are feeling as both are still emotionally distraught from their unfortunate breakup.Anne (Amanda Root) is an angel of mercy to everyone around her. She not only provides care, she also seems to be everyone's confidante. In her eyes we see her own private torture, which she tries to hide at all costs. She feels that perhaps she made a mistake in rejecting the love of Capt. Wentworth (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds), who could not provide for her financially at the time. When he appears in her life again, she fears she may lose him forever.Her own family has gone in various directions due to their own financial difficulties. She is burdened with guilt and financial worries. At first she is shy and melancholy and then when she realizes love may again be within her reach, she blossoms into a beautiful woman who knows exactly what she wants.The temptation at the start of this movie is to just stop the tape and rewind. However, something in the story kept me watching and the conclusion was very worthwhile. The story is not complex, yet the finer details are worth following and are at times very amusing.

I am a guy who likes period films such as ""Pride and Prejudice"", but this is a Chick-Flick that only women can understand. So women may not like my review.A film that many women, with fancifulness, make enjoyable.Pretty scenery, such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often exceptional. There is wonderful singing in one scene and over the closing credits.Men will find the characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting, often poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in ""Pride & Prejudice"" 1940, 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality; but not here.Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness, clearly showing: shyness, or thought, or distance, or hopefulness, or approval, or alarm.You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story.Another reviewer refers to important background from the book that is not in the film; thus a poor script for those who have not read the book. Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women, who have read the book, work and imagine an enjoyable film; better than it really is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they could not help but continue their imaginative thoughts into rating the poor directing of this film.I would like to see this good story idea re-made by a better director.Well-made romance films are: ""Pride & Prejudice 1940, 1996, 2006"", ""Wives & Daughters"", ""North & South"", and ""Naughty Marietta 1935 with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy"".

Perhaps Austen had given her Heroin the life she would have wanted for herself, perhaps not, but the similarities between her and her protagonist made me look on this film very differently than other  novels.This is a very nuanced and  slow adaptation of Austen's last novel, publishes after her death in 1817. Unlike other Austen's protagonists who are young, energetic and beautiful, Anne Elliot  is 27 years old, her youth and charms already fading away. In the terms of those times she is way passed her prime and is quickly entering the phase when she'll be considered a spinster unfit to be married. Ann has quietly resigned to spending the rest of her life in the service of her self centered father and sister, unappreciated and overlooked.  But Her quiet existence is completely shaken by a the return of Capt. Wentworth, whom she turned down 9 years ago, following advice from her friend, who thought he is not socially and financially suitable.  Wentworth is now a successful and wealthy officer, having made his fortune, and is sought after by much younger and prettier woman than Anne. Still - hopes and feelings Anne worked hard to abandon rise in her, despite herself. Capt. Wentworth, though cold and resenting at first, seems to have the same inner war with his feelings.The power of this movie adaptation lies in the way it portrays the small, stifling country life of women in that class, much similar to how Austen herself lived  - limited to a small circle of friends and family, mundane and uneventful. We see how The whole production accentuate this mundane existence in the ultra realistic  way it presents the people and their life -  the actors appear ""au naturel""  without makeup,  ( like ordinary people look ) their hair kind of sweaty and disheveled. This could actually put you off, as some look like in dire need of a bath. I myself had the urge to grab a bottle of shampoo and a hose and to give them that bath. This strips the actors of all the glory and romanticism  we usually adore so much in period movies. We do not get stunning cinematography of mansions and gardens, but instead we see people as they were then, so much similar to the way we are now - their house is messy, the breakfast table not clear yet, their children running around annoying them.  We get a close look into their lives - there's a wonderfully comic scene in which Ann, visiting her married sister, listens on 3 separate occasions to her sister complaining about her in laws, the in laws complaining about her sister, and the sisters in law complaining about both. It's very amusing but at the same time you feel how horrible it must have been for people to be trapped in their dull lives this way, and appreciate why a simple visitor  or a stranger could stir so much excitement . On the other hand - Capt. Wentworth and his colleagues from the Navy are the opposite of confinement and dull. They have ventured beyond the strict social and financial hierarchy and have the power to alter their status and future. Their lives are free and full of possibilities. We see how envious Ann is of them  taking charge of your own fate, in a way, she, as a woman, can never take.Casting  of the actors goes hand in hand in the realistic feel of the movie. Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds ( playing Anne and Capt. Wentworth ) are not what you would  normally call pretty or handsome. Hinds, though Manly and quite impressive in his quiet way, is no dreamy Mr. Darcy, and Root certainly looks like a 30 year old  woman who gave up on herself, which gives their romance and happy ending so much more power and truth  than glossy Pride and prejudice.

Amanda Root (forgive me for saying this) is a plainer and slightly older Anne than I had envisioned, but her acting is so wonderful, that we soon forget the physical discrepancy between the book and the movie. (Don't get me wrong, Amanda Root is in no way unattractive, but in the novel, Anne is constantly praised for her beauty/handsomeness, although at the ""ripe old age"" of 27, she is apparently past her ""bloom."")  Ciarin Hinds played the jilted lover to perfection: he all but ignores Anne during the movie's early scenes and never betrays the feelings he tries fruitlessly to supress. He woos Louisa Musgrove as a ruse to deny his own feelings for Anne.  It isn't until Captain Wentworth observes how fatigued Anne is during a long walk with his friends and acquaintances, that we see his concern for Anne's welfare is still intact. Anne is very touched by this gesture of Captain Wentworth in securing her a space on his sister and brother-in-law's carriage where there is room for only one lady.Anne and the nouveau riche captain are given another chance at love, despite interferring friends and dubious circumstances. Anne's cousin, Mr. Elliot, suddenly feels the lure of social respectability.  I don't think the screenwriter needed to change Mr. Elliot's financial circumstances in order to make him appear more odious to the audience.  In the book, Mr. Elliot had more than enough money, but he thought marrying Anne would bring about the appearance of social respectability. He unsuccessfully tries to woo her (""Really Mr. Elliot, this is too much flattery"").  It is too bad he didn't set his sights on Elizabeth Elliot, as they seem cut from the same fabric.  Captain Wentworth misinterprets Anne's feelings for her cousin (thank God we don't marry our cousins anymore!).  However, in one of movie history's most beautiful scenes, Captain Wentworth subtly gestures to Anne that he has written her a letter. I cry every time I watch Anne read about Wentworth's true feelings for her and how he could never forget her, try as he may.One part of the movie that I didn't quite like was the portrayal of Lady Russell. Yes, she was officious and misguided, but she was like a second mother to Anne (in the book).  In the movie, she is practically demonized as an unrepentant social snob, whom Wentworth ""will find difficult to forgive.""  In the book, Wentworth and Lady Russell are reconciled, and she recognizes the error of her judgment and short-sightedness. She did try to act in Anne's best interest, but like our charming and irrepressible Emma, ended up being completely in the wrong regarding matters of the heart and matchmaking.I loved the soprano (Rosa Mannion) who sang during one of the concerts in Bath.

I liked it very much, but I'm going to comment only upon the uneven reviews that Amanda Root got in playing the lead role.I think she's great in the role.  Personally, I don't think the beautiful Emma Thompson (in Sense and Sensibility) is really representative of the women of Jane Austen's time.  Amanda Root is.  Let's face facts.  Emma Thompson is a modern woman, forthright and forward.  Amanda Root in Persuasion is much more of a 'mouseburger', which I just can't help but believe is more true to the times.  She's passive, she's not showy, she's not pushy, she's not a 21st century feminist.  And that's all to the good...much more believable.I really liked this production, especially Ms. Root's performance.  She really makes one sympathize with a woman of that time, whose future life depended almost entirely upon whom she married.  Women who didn't marry well, and early, didn't stand much of a chance.  She would have be dependent upon her relatives for the rest of her life, and would have been the lowest ranking member of the family.  Ms. Root played the fear and lost hope of a woman in her situation very well.Highly recommended.Update:  It's been years since I purchased this DVD, but I've watched it several times.  The reason?

393513,A1IMNNBC4ME0NB,6303965415,ShamayimBlue,"[88, 90]","This movie is not only the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, it's also a wonderful film in its own right.  What did I love about it?1) It isn't stuffy and unnatural.  The characters sound human when they speak; you can imagine that this is how people spoke in the 19th century - not like pompous orators, but like real people.  The world surrounding the characters isn't overly polished or brightly lit; again, there's a natural, &quot;lived-in&quot; feeling to all the buildings and landscapes; they do not look like they came out of a glossy postcard.2) The performances.  I don't have enough praise for Amanda Root, who plays Anne Elliot, a woman whose marriage prospects are slim to nil, and who has just been thrown into the company of a man whom she rejected years ago.  Root can speak volumes just with her eyes, and everything about her fits perfectly with the gentle, wry and intelligent Anne Elliot.  As Captain Wentworth, Ciaran Hinds is also great; he disappears into the character.  Both actors aren't conventionally beautiful or handsome either; Root in particular blossoms before the viewers eyes - at first she's very faded and quiet, and then we (like Wentworth) see her spirit shine out.  In addition to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, the rest of the cast also do a wonderful job.  Perhaps because there aren't any big name actors, we can get totally immersed in the film.3) It's true to Austen.  There's subtle humor, real human feeling, and a keen understanding of human nature.  It's an unforgettable love story.4) The kiss.  One kiss - perfectly timed, perfectly executed...  you will melt.5) The soundtrack.  This holds true particularly for the assembly at Bath, and the Italian vocal pieces.",5,A gem,1089763200,"07 14, 2004",2004,1726,"['movie', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'also', 'wonderful', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'What', 'did', 'love', '1', ""n't"", 'stuffy', 'unnatural', 'characters', 'sound', 'human', 'when', 'speak', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'people', 'spoke', '19th', 'century', 'not', 'pompous', 'orators', 'real', 'people', 'world', 'surrounding', 'characters', ""n't"", 'overly', 'polished', 'brightly', 'lit', 'again', 'natural', 'quot', 'lived-in', 'quot', 'feeling', 'buildings', 'landscapes', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'came', 'glossy', 'postcard.2', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'praise', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'who', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'woman', 'marriage', 'prospects', 'are', 'slim', 'nil', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'thrown', 'company', 'man', 'whom', 'rejected', 'years', 'ago', 'Root', 'can', 'speak', 'volumes', 'just', 'eyes', 'everything', 'fits', 'perfectly', 'gentle', 'wry', 'intelligent', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'also', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'conventionally', 'beautiful', 'handsome', 'Root', 'particular', 'blossoms', 'viewers', 'eyes', 'first', 'very', 'faded', 'quiet', 'then', 'Wentworth', 'see', 'spirit', 'shine', 'addition', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Perhaps', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'can', 'get', 'totally', 'immersed', 'film.3', 'true', 'Austen', 'subtle', 'humor', 'real', 'human', 'feeling', 'keen', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'unforgettable', 'love', 'story.4', 'kiss', 'One', 'kiss', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'will', 'melt.5', 'soundtrack', 'true', 'particularly', 'assembly', 'Bath', 'Italian', 'vocal', 'pieces']",Persuasion VHS

Very little actually happens during the story, but it is rather a character-driven movie about a man and woman reforging their past love for each other; a love that never really died.The story begins eight years after Ann has rejected the marriage proposal of Frederick because she was advised that he was beneath her station and had no prospects. Then, during their eight-year separation, he gains a fortune on the high seas and Ann's family is near bankruptcy because of their pompous father's financial extravagance.Both main characters never married. Ann (played wonderfully by Amanda Root) is considered a dispirited, sad ""old maid"" and Frederick (played by Ciaran Hinds) is considered an eligible bachelor by all the young ladies who try their hand to win him, since he is newly returned from the Napoleonic war and ready to take a wife.The story is predictable, with no major surprises. It is gentile and fun, though, and I found myself intrigued toward the end, even though I nearly turned it off in the beginning because it was paced so slowly, showing people walking, horse-drawn carts and carriages, countryside and so forth. There was lots that I would have cut in order to get on with the story, but much of the pacing WAS the story. It's a different era with an emphasis on quiet conversation. People talk and talk, and they walk and talk, but the talk is often delightful in its common curtesy and politeness.

They are both older than typical Austen characters, they have gone through a tough time emotionally, they are sad. Their romance and emotional connection is subtle and restrained in keeping with the period. I was amazed by the array of emotions and nuances the cast was able to convey through gestures and looks alone. I am particularly impressed by the contrast their body language makes with their stiff Victorian dialogue, emphasizing their inner turmoil, their need to maintain appearances while secretly being in love but not at liberty to express it.If you have read the book and have an understanding of the era you will not fail to enjoy this movie.

393523,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,6303965415,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","I really like this production of Persuasion as all the actresses/actors are so good - it's a real cinderalla story, with the underappreciated Ann finally gaining enough confidence in her own abilities to chose what she knows is best for her, and the audience gets to come along for the ride.  (SPOILER) Her captain, previously denied her hand, returns to the area, rich, successful and determined to ignore her, but the quality of Ann's spirit is such that she is impossible to ignore (she provides so much to all those she is around).  It doesn't hurt for her captain to learn that another kindly landowner (Charles, now her brother-in-law) previously found her desirable, and the captain also sees that his own man, Captain Bennett, and a Mr. Eliot, also find Ann appealing, and so, eventually, Ann's captain is able to let go of his hurt pride and ask for her hand again, and this time, a smarter Ann knows what to do.  After she learns the field is clear, Ann becomes very proactive - in fact, in the 19th century this Ann would have definitely been considered forward, if not a hussy.  Ann really pushes it, and it is great to see her go after her man.  The story of Ann and her captain, and her unappreciative family is well told.  The weak points in the story include the Mr. Eliot subplot - as Mr. Eliot was presented as a villan and wished to marry into the family not for love, but to better advance his agenda, and as Elizabeth obviously liked him, it would have made more sense for Mr. Eliot, as an opportunistic villan, to set his cap at Elizabeth - it made no sense for him to pursue Ann, when Elizabeth was there and interested.  So this villan made no sense, which was a story flaw.  Also, I didn't really understand the basis for the antipathy on Elizabeth's part toward Ann.  Had Ann been unusually beautiful I could have understood Elizabeth's jealousy, but both actresses were attractive enough, I didn't see that much difference between them physically, so I wish it had been explained why Elizabeth disliked Ann so.  Really, all the acting was very fine, Ann's father (Baron and proud of it, the senior Mr. Eliot), Ann's younger sister, Mary, the Musgroves - what a treat all these superb actresses and actors give us.  As I said, the only flaw I saw was the young Mr. Eliot story line, but this weakness didn't ultimately mar the story for me, I deducted one point for it, but if there was a 4 and a half star selection, I would have chosen that.

393524,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6303965415,Stanley Crowe,"[2, 3]","Jane Austen's shortest novel is perhaps the most easily adapted to feature film length -- the others do better as serializations -- and this version is superb. Amanda Root as Anne Elliott starts as a sad and slightly depressed young woman who nevertheless always treats everybody well -- better than some deserve, in fact -- but who, when she gets a chance at happiness (after Louisa Musgrove falls in love with Captain Benwick) becomes positive and quietly active in her efforts to recapture the affections of her old love, Captain Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds is an ideal Wentworth, a naval man whose years at sea have rubbed some social polish from him but whose basically attractive directness and good-heartedness have survived. Corin Redgrave is the narcissistic Sir Walter, Anne's snobbish and fiscally irresponsible father, Sophie Thompson is perfect as Anne's limp sister Mary (who has married Charles Musgrove [Simon Russell Beale], who once courted Anne), and Susan Fleetwood (Lady Russell), Fiona Shaw and John Woodvine (as the Crofts, Sir Walter's tenants and Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law) are English theater stalwarts in relatively minor roles, though important to the plot. Sam West is the handsome but manipulative heir to the Elliott estate whom Wentworth thinks of, mistakenly, as a temptation for Anne.  The attention to the interiors (that mark social and economic standing) and costume is exemplary, and remarkably little that is important to the book is changed -- one might complain that Anne's elder sister, Elizabeth, a great beauty in the book, is not pretty enough here, and Mrs Clay, who is angling after the widowed Sir Walter, is also insufficiently attractive, when one remembers that good looks matter to Sir Walter almost more than anything.  And Anne's friend Mrs Smith comes across as more of an airhead than the chastened invalid of the novel.

393525,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,6303965415,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[5, 6]","Amazon reviewers in noticeably large numbers are wholly in the right for lavishly praising this BBC version of Jane Austen's final novel. Of the spate of Austen adaptations released in the past two decades, it's arguable that this particular one is the finest. First of all, it takes striking advantage of TV's being so good a medium for the adaptation of manners novels. Pretty much void of grand vistas, this version focuses on expressive close-ups, raised eyebrows, revelatory tete-a-tetes, and the tinkle of teacups. Amanda Root is wonderfully adept at showing us the painful consequences of Anne Elliot's refusal of Captain Wentworth years earlier. Her face in the early scenes is one with an appropriately faded bloom, and her unhappiness is signaled through her nervous, furtive glances and the almost cringing manner in which she enters rooms. She is the consummate solitary heroine of this potentially tragic, mature Austen novel. At home, she experiences what has been called the tyranny of neglect, being regularly passed over or unexpectedly offered to others for ""use"" by her self-absorbed father and older sister. The tinkle of teacups in these family scenes reveals to the shrewd observer that some of the hands holding the cups might as well have been claws and the noses snouts. Jane Austen clearly in this film is revealed as a specialist both in domestic humor and domestic horror. With the exception of Anne herself, the other Elliots inadvertently illustrate the truth in G.B.Shaw's witty paradox that ""the human family is the greatest instrument of torture the race has so far devised.""The Lyme scenes of the story are especially well-handled. A combination of the fresh sea air and a growing restoration in the returned Wentworth's good opinion combine to change Amanda Root's face to one of bright-eyed hope ""after all hope has been lost."" Also, the encounters here between Anne and the heartbroken Captain Benwick have been successfully dramatized and are moving in their rich irony. Having lost his beloved Phoebe, but ignorant of Anne's own lost love, Benwick tells Anne she cannot understand what he has lost. She responds beautifully and powerfully with the quiet rejoinder, ""Oh, but I can.""If the film has any flaws, I would say they lie in the denouement which is truncated and rather abrupt and in the characterization of Sir Walter and his oldest daughter Elizabeth. These two Elliots are too monotonously drawn in their repetitive self-absorbtion, the father caring only for looks and the daughter for rank. On the other hand, Mary, the hypochondriac Elliot middle sister, played with great skill by Sophie Thompson, is a wholly successful characterization, being more than one-dimensional in her awfulness and thus more unwittingly comical - she's a snob and doting mother as well as a hypochondriac. But these flaws, after all, are relatively small ones when taken in conjunction with the understanding and respect for the novel this adaptation shows and for the excellence of the acting in evidence throughout.",5,"""Cinderella of Kellynch Hall""",1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,3047,"['Amazon', 'reviewers', 'noticeably', 'large', 'numbers', 'are', 'wholly', 'right', 'lavishly', 'praising', 'BBC', 'version', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'final', 'novel', 'spate', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'released', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'arguable', 'particular', 'one', 'finest', 'First', 'all', 'striking', 'advantage', 'TV', 'being', 'so', 'good', 'medium', 'adaptation', 'manners', 'novels', 'Pretty', 'much', 'void', 'grand', 'vistas', 'version', 'expressive', 'close-ups', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'revelatory', 'tete-a-tetes', 'tinkle', 'teacups', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'wonderfully', 'adept', 'showing', 'painful', 'consequences', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'refusal', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'years', 'earlier', 'face', 'early', 'scenes', 'one', 'appropriately', 'faded', 'bloom', 'unhappiness', 'signaled', 'nervous', 'furtive', 'glances', 'almost', 'cringing', 'manner', 'rooms', 'consummate', 'solitary', 'heroine', 'potentially', 'tragic', 'mature', 'Austen', 'novel', 'home', 'what', 'been', 'called', 'tyranny', 'neglect', 'being', 'regularly', 'passed', 'unexpectedly', 'offered', 'others', 'use', 'self-absorbed', 'father', 'older', 'sister', 'tinkle', 'teacups', 'family', 'scenes', 'reveals', 'shrewd', 'observer', 'hands', 'holding', 'cups', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'claws', 'noses', 'snouts', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'clearly', 'film', 'revealed', 'specialist', 'domestic', 'humor', 'domestic', 'horror', 'exception', 'Anne', 'other', 'Elliots', 'inadvertently', 'illustrate', 'truth', 'G.B.Shaw', 'witty', 'paradox', 'human', 'family', 'greatest', 'instrument', 'torture', 'race', 'so', 'far', 'devised', 'Lyme', 'scenes', 'story', 'are', 'especially', 'well-handled', 'combination', 'fresh', 'sea', 'air', 'growing', 'restoration', 'returned', 'Wentworth', 'good', 'opinion', 'combine', 'change', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'face', 'one', 'bright-eyed', 'hope', 'hope', 'been', 'lost', 'Also', 'encounters', 'here', 'Anne', 'heartbroken', 'Captain', 'Benwick', 'have', 'been', 'successfully', 'dramatized', 'are', 'moving', 'rich', 'irony', 'Having', 'lost', 'beloved', 'Phoebe', 'ignorant', 'Anne', 'own', 'lost', 'love', 'Benwick', 'Anne', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'lost', 'beautifully', 'powerfully', 'quiet', 'rejoinder', 'Oh', 'can', 'film', 'flaws', 'would', 'say', 'lie', 'denouement', 'truncated', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'characterization', 'Sir', 'Walter', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'two', 'Elliots', 'are', 'too', 'monotonously', 'drawn', 'repetitive', 'self-absorbtion', 'father', 'caring', 'only', 'looks', 'daughter', 'rank', 'other', 'hand', 'Mary', 'hypochondriac', 'Elliot', 'middle', 'sister', 'played', 'great', 'skill', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'wholly', 'successful', 'characterization', 'being', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'awfulness', 'thus', 'more', 'unwittingly', 'comical', 'snob', 'doting', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'hypochondriac', 'flaws', 'are', 'relatively', 'small', 'ones', 'when', 'taken', 'conjunction', 'understanding', 'respect', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'excellence', 'acting', 'evidence']",Persuasion VHS

It is the story about a love that has known disappointment and is now quiet, cold and even a little bitter, but has never really died.The fact that &quot;Persuasion&quot; was made on a relatively small budget does not take away from the film. The cinematography is simple and very matter-of-fact which does not outdo the various locations in which the film is set. The main and supporting cast work wonderfully with a magnificant script written by Roger Mitchell. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds as Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth share a certain chemistry that works terrifically for the emotionally charged scenes which have little to do with dialogue and more to do with stolen glances. Sophie Thompson gives a stand-out performance as Anne's sister, Mary Musgrove, a hypochondriac whom nobody can stand. Her lines flow flawlessly out of her mouth.Overall I would give &quot;Persuasion&quot; five stars. It is a film that requires patience because you'll grow to care so much about Anne and Frederick that it will be hard to wait and see whether or not they come together as they are so obviously meant to. Unlike other Jane Austen screen adaptations such as Sense and Sensibility which is a &quot;louder&quot; and more passionate romp through the 1800's (and just as good), everything about Persuasion is very quiet and subtle. The movie relies on the character's silences and facial expressions which often contradict their actions and words, and in doing so have made, overall, a very satisfying love story.",5,one of the better movies based on Jane Austen's work,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,1625,"['quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'exceedingly', 'brilliant', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'date', 'story', 'love', 'known', 'disappointment', 'now', 'quiet', 'cold', 'even', 'little', 'bitter', 'never', 'really', 'died.The', 'fact', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'relatively', 'small', 'budget', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'cinematography', 'simple', 'very', 'matter-of-fact', 'not', 'outdo', 'various', 'locations', 'film', 'set', 'main', 'supporting', 'cast', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'magnificant', 'script', 'written', 'Roger', 'Mitchell', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Anne', 'Elliot', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'share', 'certain', 'chemistry', 'terrifically', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'dialogue', 'more', 'do', 'stolen', 'glances', 'Sophie', 'Thompson', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'Anne', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Musgrove', 'hypochondriac', 'whom', 'nobody', 'can', 'stand', 'lines', 'flow', 'flawlessly', 'mouth.Overall', 'would', 'give', 'quot', 'Persuasion', 'quot', 'five', 'stars', 'film', 'patience', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'Anne', 'Frederick', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'wait', 'see', 'not', 'come', 'together', 'are', 'so', 'obviously', 'meant', 'other', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'such', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'quot', 'quot', 'more', 'passionate', 'romp', '1800', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'everything', 'Persuasion', 'very', 'quiet', 'subtle', 'movie', 'character', 'silences', 'facial', 'expressions', 'often', 'contradict', 'actions', 'words', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'made', 'overall', 'very', 'satisfying', 'love', 'story']",Persuasion VHS
393556,A2491AQB89D4N5,6303965415,Willard C. Smith,"[21, 22]","If you like Jane Austin's style of romance, character development, and plot construction, then you will probably like this film.The story involves the possibility of a second chance at romance conflicted with the  resentment left over from the first attempt. The result has been described  as &quot;an adult fairy tale&quot; or the perfect &quot;chick flick.&quot;  To a degree I could agree with either description, but the story's conflict  is a bit more complex then one would expect for an &quot;adult fairy  tale.&quot;  The conflict between the romantic and rational is  demonstrated: Lady Russell attempts to influence Anne to marry Eliot for  rational reasons all while Anne feels romantically inclined towards  Whetworth. Lady Russell has succeed before since it was her ability to  persuade Anne to turn Wentworth's proposal of marriage down eight years  before. The world's repeated intrusion especially at points when the two  are about to reconcile is contrasted with an unusual scene when a circus  (symbolically the world) finally passes them by when the conflicts are  finally resolved.The character development is subtle. My wife and I have  watched this film many times, and each time we have noticed something new.  Wentworth is resentful, but he still loves Anne (but he goes out of his way  not to show it). Anne still loves Wentworth, but is being careful because  she doesn't want to be hurt. Her comment that her sex will still love  longest when all hope is gone is a perfect summation of her attitude. Most  of the characters are three dimensional, with a couple of intended  exceptions: Anne's father and sister are amusingly single dimensional. The  unintential one dimensional exceptions are Mr Eliot, Lady Russell, and Mrs.  Smith for reasons that will be covered later.The plot construction  involves a series of social reversals that have taken place in eight years:  those reversals involve the economic situation between Wentworth and Anne's  family, the romantic reversals, and the social reversals. The social  reversals are particularily amusing as one observes Anne's father and  sister's obsession with rank and connections. This behavior is reasonable  since the father and sister seem to have lost everything else.There are  several additional things that I like about this film. The photography is  excellect, the sound is good, and the music is simple. The music is  especially good being made up of period pieces played on original  instruments (original instruments have an unusual twang not present in  modern versions of the same instruments).The things that I don't like  might be slightly minor to most audiences: Lady Russell is portrayed  unusually harsh in this film. In other versions of Persuasion (1971), I  believe her character is treated more fairly, yes, she has persuaded Anne  in the past, but not strictly for monetary and social reasons. In the book  and the earlier film, Lady Russell's behavior is motivated by Anne's  happiness and makes her judgments accordingly. The character of Anne's  friend &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot; is portrayed positively in this film (1995)  than in the book or the earlier version of this film (1971). Mrs. Smith is  in a nasty economic situation created by Mr. Eliot. She has a vested  interested in seeing that Anne marries Eliot because it might help her out  of her situation. The 1995 film discards this entire relation and makes the  only connection one of gossip. It makes Mrs. Smith look much nicer, but it  loses yet another view of Mr. Eliot's character. As a result Mr. Eliot and  Mrs. Smith become single dimentional characters and it detracts from the  story. Austin always has at least one rogue in her story. Her rogues  usually have one dark secret which is revealed at some point in her story,  and Persuasion is no exception. But Mr. Eliot's motives, and actions seem  strangely disconnected until nearly the end. Even his relationship with  Mrs. Clay (which is a significant point in the 1971 film and book) is  glossed over. One has to read between the lines to infer his intentions in  regard to Mrs. Clay.I highly recommend this film. I especially recommend  the DVD version with a small amplifier and a pair of external speakers  since some subtle statements, background noise, and music could be lost. I  know since I have watched this film many times on VHS and DVD.My wife  and I love watching this film",4,A Film that Needs to be Watched Carefully,952905600,"03 13, 2000",2000,4419,"['like', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'style', 'romance', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'construction', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'film.The', 'story', 'possibility', 'second', 'chance', 'romance', 'conflicted', 'resentment', 'left', 'over', 'first', 'attempt', 'result', 'been', 'described', 'quot', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'flick.', 'quot', 'degree', 'could', 'agree', 'description', 'story', 'conflict', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'quot', 'fairy', 'tale.', 'quot', 'conflict', 'romantic', 'rational', 'demonstrated', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'influence', 'Anne', 'marry', 'Eliot', 'rational', 'reasons', 'Anne', 'feels', 'romantically', 'inclined', 'towards', 'Whetworth', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'succeed', 'was', 'ability', 'persuade', 'Anne', 'turn', 'Wentworth', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'down', 'eight', 'years', 'before', 'world', 'repeated', 'intrusion', 'especially', 'points', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'reconcile', 'contrasted', 'unusual', 'scene', 'when', 'circus', 'symbolically', 'world', 'finally', 'when', 'conflicts', 'are', 'finally', 'resolved.The', 'character', 'development', 'subtle', 'wife', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'time', 'have', 'noticed', 'something', 'new', 'Wentworth', 'resentful', 'still', 'Anne', 'way', 'not', 'show', 'Anne', 'still', 'Wentworth', 'being', 'careful', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'hurt', 'comment', 'sex', 'will', 'still', 'love', 'longest', 'when', 'hope', 'gone', 'perfect', 'summation', 'attitude', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'three', 'dimensional', 'couple', 'intended', 'exceptions', 'Anne', 'father', 'sister', 'are', 'amusingly', 'single', 'dimensional', 'unintential', 'one', 'dimensional', 'exceptions', 'are', 'Mr', 'Eliot', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'reasons', 'will', 'be', 'covered', 'later.The', 'plot', 'construction', 'series', 'social', 'reversals', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'eight', 'years', 'reversals', 'involve', 'economic', 'situation', 'Wentworth', 'Anne', 'family', 'romantic', 'reversals', 'social', 'reversals', 'social', 'reversals', 'are', 'particularily', 'amusing', 'one', 'Anne', 'father', 'sister', 'obsession', 'rank', 'connections', 'behavior', 'reasonable', 'father', 'sister', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'everything', 'are', 'several', 'additional', 'things', 'like', 'film', 'photography', 'excellect', 'sound', 'good', 'music', 'simple', 'music', 'especially', 'good', 'being', 'made', 'period', 'pieces', 'played', 'original', 'instruments', 'original', 'instruments', 'have', 'unusual', 'twang', 'not', 'present', 'modern', 'versions', 'same', 'instruments', '.The', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'might', 'be', 'slightly', 'minor', 'most', 'audiences', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'portrayed', 'unusually', 'harsh', 'film', 'other', 'versions', 'Persuasion', '1971', 'believe', 'character', 'treated', 'more', 'fairly', 'yes', 'persuaded', 'Anne', 'past', 'not', 'strictly', 'monetary', 'social', 'reasons', 'book', 'earlier', 'film', 'Lady', 'Russell', 'behavior', 'motivated', 'Anne', 'happiness', 'judgments', 'accordingly', 'character', 'Anne', 'friend', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'quot', 'portrayed', 'positively', 'film', '1995', 'book', 'earlier', 'version', 'film', '1971', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'nasty', 'economic', 'situation', 'created', 'Mr.', 'Eliot', 'vested', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Anne', 'marries', 'Eliot', 'might', 'help', 'out', 'situation', '1995', 'film', 'discards', 'entire', 'relation', 'only', 'connection', 'one', 'gossip', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'look', 'much', 'nicer', 'yet', 'view', 'Mr.', 'Eliot', 'character', 'result', 'Mr.', 'Eliot', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'become', 'single', 'dimentional', 'characters', 'story', 'Austin', 'always', 'least', 'one', 'rogue', 'story', 'rogues', 'usually', 'have', 'one', 'dark', 'secret', 'revealed', 'point', 'story', 'Persuasion', 'exception', 'Mr.', 'Eliot', 'motives', 'actions', 'seem', 'strangely', 'disconnected', 'nearly', 'end', 'Even', 'relationship', 'Mrs.', 'Clay', 'significant', 'point', '1971', 'film', 'book', 'glossed', 'One', 'read', 'lines', 'infer', 'intentions', 'regard', 'Mrs.', 'Clay.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'version', 'small', 'amplifier', 'pair', 'external', 'speakers', 'subtle', 'statements', 'background', 'noise', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'lost', 'know', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'VHS', 'DVD.My', 'wife', 'love', 'watching', 'film']",Persuasion VHS

Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds lead an extraordinary cast of excellent actors.  The lighting of the night time indoor scenes is nicely done, suggesting soft, dim candle light.  The cinematography is exquisite.  The film begins with a view of Admiral Croft being rowed out to his ship by the men of his crew, intercut with a view of Mr. Shepherd, Sir Walter Elliot's agent, on his way to Kellynch Hall with his daughter, Mrs. Clay, to discuss renting Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft with Sir Walter.  Neither of these segments are in the novel, but cutting back and forth between them sets up the eventual meeting with Mr. Shepherd and Sir Walter when Sir Walter agrees to lease Kellynch Hall to Admiral Croft.  Great film making.  Another example.  At Lyme, in the foreground of the long shot of the Musgroves, Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth taking a walk along the sea wall is a table at which several women are at work cleaning fish.

But she was once a pretty girl and she's also supposed to have a sense of humour, and have enough manners to hide her own feelings in a social setting.Amanda Root's Anne in this movie is seriously plain/unattractive, and one can't imagine how she could ever be considered pretty 8 years ago with her long nose, plain eyes, and indeterminate jawline. But that's not the problem.The problem is that in every scene in which Captain Wentworth's name is mentioned, her eyes go all big, her jaw drops, and she goes all pale and frozen and can't function in a social setting. She becomes a total dumbwit. When Wentworth's name is mentioned, Anne is supposed to be stricken, barely functioning mentally, yet also hiding it beneath her manners and continuing to attend to others in conversation. Furthermore, Amanda Root's Anne doesn't show any conversational ability until she's talking with Mr. Elliot in Bath. A little late in the movie, isn't it?The Anne portrayed by Ms. Firbanks in the 1971 version of Persuason is at least 10 years too old, but I preferred that Anne's social adeptness. Even when stricken, she tried to hide it and spare the people around her from being worried about her, and acted graciously. And you could see her past beauty, and her conversational/social graces.The rest of the movie is good, the costumes, classical music, Captain Wentworth is particularly well cast, etc. Although Bentwick is dreadfully unattractive and the conversation often too quiet to understand.",3,wrong portrayal of Anne,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,1609,"['Everyone', 'was', 'cast', 'well', 'Anne', 'Yes', 'supposed', 'be', 'tired', 'plain', 'worn', 'out', 'lost', 'quot', 'bloom', 'quot', 'was', 'once', 'pretty', 'girl', 'also', 'supposed', 'have', 'sense', 'humour', 'have', 'enough', 'manners', 'hide', 'own', 'feelings', 'social', 'setting.Amanda', 'Root', 'Anne', 'movie', 'seriously', 'plain/unattractive', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'considered', 'pretty', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'long', 'nose', 'plain', 'eyes', 'indeterminate', 'jawline', 'not', 'problem.The', 'problem', 'scene', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'name', 'mentioned', 'eyes', 'go', 'big', 'jaw', 'drops', 'pale', 'frozen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'social', 'setting', 'total', 'dumbwit', 'When', 'Wentworth', 'name', 'mentioned', 'Anne', 'supposed', 'be', 'stricken', 'barely', 'functioning', 'mentally', 'yet', 'also', 'hiding', 'manners', 'continuing', 'attend', 'others', 'conversation', 'Furthermore', 'Amanda', 'Root', 'Anne', ""n't"", 'show', 'conversational', 'ability', 'talking', 'Mr.', 'Elliot', 'Bath', 'little', 'late', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Anne', 'portrayed', 'Ms.', 'Firbanks', '1971', 'version', 'Persuason', 'least', '10', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'preferred', 'Anne', 'social', 'adeptness', 'Even', 'when', 'stricken', 'tried', 'hide', 'spare', 'people', 'being', 'worried', 'acted', 'graciously', 'could', 'see', 'past', 'beauty', 'conversational/social', 'graces.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'good', 'costumes', 'classical', 'music', 'Captain', 'Wentworth', 'particularly', 'well', 'cast', 'etc', 'Bentwick', 'dreadfully', 'unattractive', 'conversation', 'often', 'too', 'quiet', 'understand']",Persuasion VHS

Not all great love stories are about a beautiful person.  Although it may not appeal to others, and some might find it slow-paced and somewhat boring, let me express that that is the beauty of it.  Like all great art, it evokes a feeling or a reaction.  The story reflects the period of time where things were much slower and less action-packed.  If you can stick with it,  it is a great story.

The story of a long-simmering love that was lost and ultimately found again is told in such a subtle manner as to tug at one's heartstrings, and draw us into the enduring love story between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The two leads are impeccable in their performances...Amanda Root plays a lovelorn Anne who tries to 'speak' her true feelings in gestures rather than words, and Ciaran Hinds makes a dashing Captain Wentworth, who still smarting from Anne's rejection of his proposal years ago, nevertheless still loves her. The rest of the cast do an equally amazing job of playing out their respective parts, and the scenes of the English countryside, and the coastal city of Bath are purely enchanting.
