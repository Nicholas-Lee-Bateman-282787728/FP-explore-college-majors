I hate to say it, but this movie is incredibly slow and overwrought. I usually enjoy Kutcher in a dramatic performance but I found his awkwardness rather distracting, his sensitivity failed him this time around. Pfeiffer gives another stellar performance but the romance between her and Kutcher just never clicked with me.

No question. However, those parts of the story seem to be just a mask and an attempt to legitimize this goofy love story of a middle-aged woman getting it on with a young man half her age. Sure, it could happen, but why glorify it? So these two characters who, based on the actors that portray them, are drop dead gorgeous can't attract a member of the opposite sex within 20 years of their own ages? Yeah, right. At first I thought the relationship between the two was going to be just as friends, supporting each other through their respective hardships. But as soon as Pfeiffer's character uttered the all-time classic BS line ""I need you to go with me to this function but it's not a date,"" I knew right then where this story was going--straight to a bedroom.

Ashton Kutcher had the potential to be a nationally recognized wrestler prior to his sister's murder.  After her murder, he returns home to be with his mother and to watch the trial.

After his sister's brutal rape and murder, Walter (Ashton Kutcher) gives up his promising wrestling career in order to care for his family and monitor the case of his sister's alleged killer. Through a support group, he meets Linda, (Michelle Pfeiffer)a widow grieving her husband's violent death, and the two become closer when the trials of their loved ones' killers are running concurrently. Kutcher's relationship with Pfeiffer grows from platonic to romantic, and Kutcher also takes an interest in Linda's angry, troubled, deaf son Clay.After ""Spread,"" ""Personal Effects"" is the second film I've seen recently that casts Ashton Kutcher as a dramatic lead. Like in ""Spread,"" Kutcher is paired with an older, more seasoned actress, and in both cases, this mostly just makes obvious how feather-light Kutcher's presence really is. Kutcher and Pfeiffer have a smidgen of chemistry, and despite their 20 year age difference, Pfeiffer is still so beautiful that there's no doubt that even pretty boy Kutcher would find her attractive. But Pfeiffer is such a far superior actor that Kutcher seems wooden by comparison. It's clear Kutcher is going for subtle and stoic, but the result is, unfortunately, somewhat vapid.Also adding considerably superior acting chops to the film is Kathy Bates, who plays Walter's mother, Gloria, mourning the death of her daughter and caring for her grandchild. Once again, Bates' gravitas make Kutcher seem like an amateur in comparison.By casting a stronger actor in the lead (Ryan Gosling or Joseph Gordon-Levitt come to mind), this could have been a much better film.

The premise is a study of how the traumatic deaths of people affect those left behind. The story is well told, allows the audience to explore the group therapy approach offered to families of violently killed people - the various means of responding to loss, the differing reactions from those who cannot let go of the hate they have for losing a loved one, and introduces an interesting concept of having one of the characters who narrates the film be a deaf mute young man!Gloria (Kathy Bates) is the mother of twins - the girl was been brutalized and murdered and the boy Andrew (Ashton Kuchter) has left his career as a wrestler to return to the scene of the crime to mourn his sister and to demand the perpetrator be convicted and imprisoned: his career has been put on hold and he ekes out a living dressed as a chicken for a fast food chicken restaurant.  During the ongoing twin's trial, Andrew meets  Linda (Michelle Pfeiffer) whose alcoholic husband has been killed and she is left to support her teenage deaf mute son Clay (Spencer Hudson). Through series of grieving meetings and periods of isolation on the part of each of the characters, each finds ways to support the other and a love affair develops between the older Linda and the younger Andrew as he agrees to accompany her to her various weddings for which she serves a planner.  How  these characters comes to grips with resolution of their losses is well tied together by film's end.This is not a great movie, but the performances by the leads are quite fine. This is a movie with a message, one that delves into territory with which many are not familiar, and for that reason alone it is well worth watching.

For a guy to go from ""Punk'd"" to movies like ""Guess Who,"" ""Butterfly Effect"" and ""Personal Effects"" shows his range of characters. Yes, he's been in some goofy comedies, but he's also had some very intense roles, this being at the top of the list. In this movie, he plays a bashful wrestler who could've made it to nationals in Iowa. Walter (Kutcher's character) life is turned upside down when he finds out his twin sister has been raped, beaten, murdered and burned (yeah, all four!). So he comes to the town where his mother Gloria lives to be with her (Kathy Bates) and his niece. While waiting on the verdict of his sister's trial, he comes in contact with Linda (Michelle Pfeiffer) at a support meeting and in the courtroom hallways.

I already knew Michelle Pfeiffer could pull off a movie like this from watching her in other films (particularly the ""murder news"" scene in ""Dangerous Minds"") and Kutcher is pleasant to watch not just because he's handsome but he wears his emotions in his eyes. Speaking of emotions, considering Spencer Hudson really is deaf, that added more flavor to the film for me. Initially I was thinking, ""This guy really is doing a great job of playing a deaf son."" Every single emotion you could think of, he played it. Hudson's acting made me rethink the idea of silent films. He never said a word (outside of a bunch of sign language, which I could not figure out why Walter couldn't understand), but he made this film for me. All he had to do was look up at another character and I connected with his mood.The guy (Aleks Paunovic?) who was being tried for Walter's sister's murder did an outstanding job, too. He had me convinced he was mentally disabled in real life, too, but judging from photos of him on IMDB, he's not. (I don't know him from any other films.) But he played his role well and made me sympathize with him about as much as the movie jury.I'd recommend this one.",4,Intense movie with memorable actors,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,2445,"['What', 'like', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'how', 'well-rounded', 'guy', 'go', 'Punk', ""'d"", 'movies', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Personal', 'Effects', 'range', 'characters', 'Yes', 'been', 'goofy', 'comedies', 'also', 'had', 'very', 'intense', 'roles', 'being', 'top', 'list', 'movie', 'bashful', 'wrestler', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'nationals', 'Iowa', 'Walter', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'out', 'twin', 'sister', 'been', 'raped', 'beaten', 'murdered', 'burned', 'yeah', 'four', 'town', 'where', 'mother', 'Gloria', 'be', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'niece', 'waiting', 'verdict', 'sister', 'trial', 'contact', 'Linda', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'support', 'meeting', 'courtroom', 'hallways', 'awkwardly', 'hit', 'off', 'one', 'weddings', 'strange', 'connection', 'builds', 'two', 'Linda', 'aggressive', 'deaf', 'son', 'Clay', 'Spencer', 'Hudson', '.I', 'made', 'mistake', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'computer', 'Bad', 'choice', 'movie', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'something', 'watched', 'twice', 'make', 'sure', 'knew', 'details', 'cases', 'really', 'actors', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'already', 'knew', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'movie', 'watching', 'other', 'films', 'particularly', 'murder', 'news', 'scene', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'Kutcher', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'not', 'just', 'handsome', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'Speaking', 'emotions', 'considering', 'Spencer', 'Hudson', 'really', 'deaf', 'added', 'more', 'flavor', 'film', 'Initially', 'was', 'thinking', 'guy', 'really', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'deaf', 'son', 'single', 'emotion', 'could', 'think', 'played', 'Hudson', 'acting', 'made', 'rethink', 'idea', 'silent', 'films', 'never', 'said', 'word', 'bunch', 'sign', 'language', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Walter', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'made', 'film', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'look', 'up', 'character', 'connected', 'mood.The', 'guy', 'Aleks', 'Paunovic', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'tried', 'Walter', 'sister', 'murder', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'too', 'had', 'convinced', 'was', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'real', 'life', 'too', 'judging', 'photos', 'IMDB', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'films', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'made', 'sympathize', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'jury.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'one']",Personal Effects
