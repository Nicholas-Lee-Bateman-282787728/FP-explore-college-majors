Did anyone in the crew watch the rushes during Estevez's scenes and notice that he's a totally unsympathetic character who apparently wasn't written to be that way?  Is sulking all that guy can do?  He has one face, like Steven Seagal, and to him &quot;emoting&quot; means more of the same face.  To hear Andrew McCarthy pontificating on the meaning of life and love through puffs of cigarette smoke at -- what was he -- 12? -- is hilarious (and again, inadvertently).  Oh, and hasn't everyone we know who's suffered a breakdown gotten to do it in a chic bare room with a beautiful billowing curtain overhead?  Study the script sometime, as long as you haven't eaten first -- one mock crisis piled on top of another; it's the creatively bankrupt writer's guide to scene and character transitions.  Oh -- OH -- and if you're an African American, just try to find the one African American character in the plot, and try not to be outraged.  Spike Lee should lay off UPN and check out this movie.OK, OK, I will concede one tiny point -- the movie does have one good line.

[St. Elmo&#8217;s Fire is a phenomenon seen on high places in stormy weather.] It shows their personal lives. [Would you want them for friends or co-workers? Does such behavior go on today?] &#8220;I always knew he was a Republican!&#8221; Their talk tells about their outlook on life. [Will it change in ten or twenty years?] Do some have a problem in handling money? [Isn&#8217;t that the first rule for adults?] The troubled personal lives of some is a turn-off or a lesson for the viewers. One graduate works at the Welfare Office. Are these typical scenes?One girl doesn&#8217;t want to see her boyfriend anymore. There is a fight in a bar; the musicians are fired. One woman is involved with her married boss. [Never a wise decision?] Can a musician stop drinking and womanizing? [Too much pride?] There is a conflict between a man and his girlfriend. Kirby is surprised and disappointed. Another couple becomes much more friendly. Later there are emotional conflicts and scenes to provide action. [I&#8217;m losing interest in these cardboard characters. How did they get through four years in a prestigious college?] The loss of a job causes a crisis for a young woman. Can she be helped? Yes.Why were these seven people such close friends? What do they have in common? Was this meant as some sort of exploitation movie, or to set a bad example that should be avoided? There was no mention of any large education debts.

True in DC legaly you can't (or couldn't) call a bar a ""B-A-R"".  But outside of that, I remember many of the antics that these charcters got up to.  Contrary to what some of the other reviewers have said about this movie this is, or was how I remember Georgetown and the DC surburbs to be in the 1980s.  I was there and some 20s year later I still can't believe that era...All in all a little campy and several generations too far in the past for the current era.  But over all a pretty good film.

161331,A15XERCBNRLGP8,0800109481,Albert Gutierrez,"[27, 29]","A forerunner to Friends and a Brat Pack movie with the most...Brat Packers, St. Elmo's Fire was a romantic comedy that bowed out to theatres in 1985.  Seven of the eight stars were in the enviable ""Brat Pack"" group, young and precocious actors and actresses that were considered the best of the best of their generation.  While St. Elmo's Fire is often considered a mellow and almost overblown teen romcom by the starchiest of critics, it's a favorite of many 1980s film lovers.Summary in 13 words:Seven college graduates try and struggle with real life, some succeed, some don't.DVD Details2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen5.1 Dolby Digital Surround (English),2.0 Dolby Surround (Director's Commentary)English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Thai, Korean SubtitlesRelease Date: 1999Single-Sided Single-Layered DiscSuggested Retail Price: $14.99Black Amaray KeepcaseVideo and AudioThe video is remarkably clean.  The film was issued in the early years of DVD, when most transfers looked more like cable TV quality, but the video here is exceptional.  Presented in its original widescreen is always a good thing, and the print quality is great.  The colors are vibrant and accurate, and there's little to no grain or dust.  One minor complaint would be the main titles, in its unsettling red font, but other than that, the video is great.Audio is offered in English, but the subtitles are in so many languages that if you wanted, you could learn Chinese by reading the film enough times.  It's pretty balanced in terms of dialogue vs. background noise/music.Bonus FeaturesA commentary by Joel Schumacher is one of the many audio tracks given on this disc.  He does a pretty good job talking about making the movie, including various tidbits about the actors and the story (which he wrote).  The guy's pretty good with a microphone.  If only he could have done a commentary for his film The Phantom of the Opera in 2004.A faded and dirt-filled 8-minute EPK about the making of the film is also presented, made at the time the film came out.  It has quick interviews with the cast and director, with a narrator talking during much of the behind the scenes footage.  Is it an exhaustive documentary?  No.  Is it a useless 8 minutes of your life taken away?  No.  It's pretty rewatchable, though a longer more substantial featurette would be welcoming.""Man in Motion"" is the music video that uses the St. Elmo's Fire theme with lyrics.  It's got a real 80s look to it, and features most of the cast as well as video clips from the film.There are four trailers: St. Elmo's Fire, About Last Night, Groundhog Day, and Jerry Maguire.  The trailers for St. Elmo's Fire and About Last Night are not the best video-quality-wise, while Jerry Maguire is not the best movie-quality-wise.  Groundhog Day is okay for what it is.There are also cast/director biographies and filmographies up until 2000.Closing ThoughtsPerhaps the second best brat pack movie of the 80s (The Breakfast Club, of course, is THE best), St. Elmo's Fire is a wonderful ""coming-of-age...now what?"" kind of film that is best enjoyed in the company of your closest friends.",4,One of the reasons the 80s was...the 80s.,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,3129,"['forerunner', 'Friends', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'movie', 'most', 'Brat', 'Packers', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'was', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'bowed', 'out', 'theatres', '1985', 'Seven', 'eight', 'stars', 'were', 'enviable', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'group', 'young', 'precocious', 'actors', 'actresses', 'were', 'considered', 'best', 'best', 'generation', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'often', 'considered', 'mellow', 'almost', 'overblown', 'teen', 'romcom', 'starchiest', 'critics', 'favorite', 'many', '1980s', 'film', 'lovers.Summary', '13', 'words', 'Seven', 'college', 'graduates', 'try', 'struggle', 'real', 'life', 'succeed', ""don't.DVD"", 'Details2.35', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'English', ',2.0', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'Chinese', 'Thai', 'Korean', 'SubtitlesRelease', 'Date', '1999Single-Sided', 'Single-Layered', 'DiscSuggested', 'Retail', 'Price', '14.99Black', 'Amaray', 'KeepcaseVideo', 'AudioThe', 'video', 'remarkably', 'clean', 'film', 'was', 'issued', 'early', 'years', 'DVD', 'when', 'most', 'transfers', 'looked', 'more', 'cable', 'TV', 'quality', 'video', 'here', 'exceptional', 'Presented', 'original', 'widescreen', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'print', 'quality', 'great', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'accurate', 'little', 'grain', 'dust', 'One', 'minor', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'main', 'titles', 'unsettling', 'red', 'font', 'other', 'video', 'great.Audio', 'offered', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'languages', 'wanted', 'could', 'learn', 'Chinese', 'reading', 'film', 'enough', 'times', 'pretty', 'balanced', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'vs.', 'background', 'FeaturesA', 'commentary', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'one', 'many', 'audio', 'tracks', 'given', 'disc', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'talking', 'making', 'movie', 'including', 'various', 'tidbits', 'actors', 'story', 'wrote', 'guy', 'pretty', 'good', 'microphone', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'commentary', 'film', 'Phantom', 'Opera', '2004.A', 'faded', 'dirt-filled', '8-minute', 'EPK', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'presented', 'made', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'quick', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'narrator', 'talking', 'much', 'scenes', 'footage', 'exhaustive', 'documentary', 'useless', '8', 'minutes', 'life', 'taken', 'away', 'No', 'pretty', 'rewatchable', 'longer', 'more', 'substantial', 'featurette', 'would', 'be', 'welcoming', 'Man', 'Motion', 'music', 'video', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'theme', 'lyrics', 'got', 'real', '80s', 'look', 'most', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'video', 'clips', 'are', 'four', 'trailers', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'Last', 'Night', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'trailers', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'Last', 'Night', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'video-quality-wise', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'not', 'best', 'movie-quality-wise', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'okay', 'what', 'are', 'also', 'cast/director', 'biographies', 'up', '2000.Closing', 'ThoughtsPerhaps', 'second', 'best', 'brat', 'pack', 'movie', '80s', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'course', 'THE', 'best', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'wonderful', 'coming-of-age', 'now', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'company', 'closest', 'friends']",N/A

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 4]","When future historians want to understand the zeitgeist of the 80's they will inevitably turn to two films: The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire. Of the two, The Breakfast Club is the better movie. John Hughes had real empathy for the generation that was seeking to define itself in the wake of the baby boom. The Breakfast Club music was also much better. Who can forget songs like ""Don't You Forget About Me"" by The Simple Minds? As you may recall, the members of The Breakfast Club were asked to write an essay about how they saw themselves. But if The Breakfast Club shows how that generation would like to be remembered, perhaps St. Elmo's Fire is closer to the truth. It holds up a mirror to Gen Xers, even if the mirror is cracked and streaked with a white powdery residue.In 1985, the same year that ""Elmo"" was released, a New York Magazine cover story coined the term, ""Brat Pack,"" a take off on Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack posse from the 50's and 60's. The Brat Pack was a group of young actors and actresses who came of age in the 80's. They embodied the socially apathetic, cynical, money-obsessed and ideologically barren eighties generation, who were also notable for excessive partying. Though a wide variety of people could be considered Brat Packers, membership in the ensemble casts of either John Hughes' The Breakfast Club or Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire, or better yet, both films, was the most commonly accepted definition.Let's take a look at the seven characters that congregate almost nightly in St. Elmo's Bar, all friends since college, recently graduated, and trying to make sense of the adult world:Alec Newbury (Judd Nelson) is at first glance the most together. He gets jobs for his friends, even if they sometimes screw them up. He has a job with a Democratic Congressman, but he is being courted by a Republican Senator, and is more than willing to sell out at the earliest possible opportunity. I don't want to play partisan politics myself, and am not taking sides or favoring one party over another, but within the context of the film, strangely the once idealistic Alec Newbury is making his decision purely for selfish reasons. It would mean more money for him, and he doesn't give any thought whatsoever to what it means to our country and its citizens. More money would mean he could get married. Though he claims to love his girlfriend, he can't help himself from repeatedly cheating on her.Leslie (Ally Sheedy), his girlfriend, isn't quite ready to get married, though they are moving in together. She has plans of her own, to be an architect, though if you blink you miss that back-story, because she is presented more as a wife-in-training. Their female friends voted them ""couple most likely to couple"" and are excited about Alec's defection to the Republicans. They receive the news as if they're hearing that ""He went to Jerrod's"" in a diamond commercial.------------------Leslie: Alec is becoming a Republican... and he wants to get *married!* Oh, my God!Jules: I always *knew* he was a Republican!============================Kevin Dolenz (Andrew McCarthy) is a brooding journalist who is secretly in love with Leslie. He is also Alec's confidant, and the temptation to betray his friend is intense. Kevin works for the paper but is only assigned obituaries. He is trying to write an article about the meaning of life but is hopelessly blocked. When he does write his article he proudly shows his friends his by-line, but you know what? They are glad for him, but no one has the time or interest to actually read it. Kevin makes witty observations that I hear were taken from a character in Duck's Breath Mystery Theater. Duck's Breath is thanked in the credits.------------------Kevin: Marriage is a concept invented by people who were lucky to make it to 20 without being eaten by dinosaurs. Marriage is obsolete.Alec: Dinosaurs are obsolete. Marriage is still around.=============================In one scene Kevin plays bongos and sings along with Aretha Franklin on ""Respect."" It is embarrassingly bad, as he has neither a good singing voice nor any semblance of rhythm. He is the Rodney Dangerfield of St. Elmo's Fire, as even Naomi (Anna Maria Horsford), the black hooker on the corner, won't ask him if he wants a date because she thinks he's gay. She's not the only one.Julianna ""Jules"" Van Patten (Demi Moore) tries to set Kevin up with her interior decorator friend, Ron (Matthew Laurance). She figures since he is the only one of the men in their group that hasn't hit on her, the only possible explanation is that he's gay.---------------------Kevin: You know Jules, there is the brink of insanity and then there is the abyss, which obviously you have fallen into!============================Jules is wrong about that, and a real mess besides. She has already gone through a couple months' worth of salary advances to buy clothes and lavish decorations for her apartment. It is a bit ironic that Demi Moore was allegedly considered out of control on the set, and was sent to rehab. She had to straighten out to play the most out of control character. She calls Alec late at night to rescue her from imaginary dramas, blasted on coke. Once she is rescued, and realizes that Alec won't go home with her because he has to get up early for work the next morning, she calls another male acquaintance, because she doesn't want to ""waste all the good coke."" When she goes to her boss to ask for another salary advance she ends up starting an affair with him. Her friends try to intervene, but she'll have none of it. ""I don't know why you're both so worried,"" says Jules. ""So, I bop him for a couple of years, get his job when he gets his hands caught in the vault, do a black mink ad, retire in utter disgrace, then write a best seller and be a fabulous host on my own talk show.""Here is the idea that scandal can be a short cut to fame. Instead of being ashamed about it, it is a conscious career choice. It is almost like a prophecy, a foreshadowing of Britney Spears, Lindsey Lohan, or Paris Hilton, and the whole gossip tabloid culture; where Katy Perry accuses Lady Gaga of calculating controversy to advance her career, to which I can only say to Katy: Pot. Kettle. Black.Billy Hicks (Rob Lowe) is another huge screw up. By the second scene, he is already being arrested for drunk driving. He doesn't deny being drunk, but you could hardly call what he was doing driving. Blithely unconcerned, he plays the theme from ""The Flintstones"" on his tenor saxophone while waiting to be booked. He was a legendary partier in college, and 4 months after graduation he is still acting like a frat boy. He gets fired from job after job but his only concern is the next drink, the next line, or the next babe to hit on.The thing that bugged me the most about Billy was that he didn't have a case for his horn. That is ridiculous. No serious saxophonist would carry his horn around without a case. He was married and had a kid, yet he spent all his time hanging around with the group of friends he knew from college. He didn't even hang out with his band. Didn't they ever rehearse or anything? He never spoke about how or why he got married; he just complained that his wife was cramping his style. When his friend's see her, they just call her Billy's wife. Like in the bible, you never know Lot's wife's name, just that she was turned into a pillar of salt. Schumacher, the director, also gave Billy's wife short shrift. I listened to ""Elmo"" three times in a vain effort to catch her name.Rob Lowe won a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor for this film. Still, even though there were some problems with the way his role was written, he did liven up the proceedings. He has a very good scene where he employs St. Elmo's Fire as a kind of metaphor. The bar where the seven friends congregate is named St. Elmo's Fire, but beyond that, St. Elmo's Fire was electric flashes of light that appeared in dark skies out of nowhere. Sailors believed the lights had been sent by St. Elmo, but there never was a St. Elmo. He almost makes the point that Jules, he -- their whole generation -- feel lost and are looking for some sort of St. Elmo's Fire to guide them before the metaphor breaks down, somewhere just outside of Wichita. Oh, well. ""It ain't a party till something gets broken,"" as Billy would say.Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham) is in love with Billy, but apart from him being a screw up and already married to boot, her chances of catching Billy the Kid are nil.------------------Jules: I thought you were taking steps to phase out everything that wasn't working in your life.Wendy: That doesn't leave much.================================Wendy is a shy and frumpy girl, and the name Beamish kind of says a lot about how the writers thought of her. It reminds me of Stanley Beamish, a scrawny gas station attendant who was the alter ego of Mr. Terrific, a super hero spoof from a 60's TV show. Wendy works for Social Services but the film has a very cynical attitude about such do gooders. She tries to get a welfare recipient interested in job programs but is told ""just give me my check."" Her father wants her to join the family business and open a greeting card franchise, and they also have a greeting card employee picked out for her future spouse. None of the St. Elmo's Fire ensemble cast are believable as friends, but Wendy even less so. Mare Winningham is not even considered part of The Brat Pack.Kirby Kegger (Emilio Estevez) is kind of an outsider in this movie, too. He is a room mate of Kevin's, but his contribution to the story involves an unrequited crush he has on a young intern he dated once in college. When he sees Dale Bibberman (Andie McDowell) at the hospital, after Billy has totaled Wendy's car, he is dazzled by her. She barely remembers him, but is polite and friendly enough to give ""Kirbo"" just a wisp of hope to cling to. When she goes off to attend her patients, it is as if she is ascending to the heavens in a blaze of light. Is she meant to represent a life of purpose, something the raging Mr. Kegger severely lacks? He doggedly stalks her, making a complete fool of himself. She takes it well, a little too well, in light of the little it takes to set a stalker off. There is one scene where she confesses that she wanted to become a doctor to help people but now suspects that it is all about the money. Kirby has a big chip on his shoulder, and takes it personally, as if she is saying that he can't afford her. Later, they do have lunch, but it is cut short when Dale is called back to the hospital. Or was she? I bet that she had herself paged, shortly after arriving, and if it was going well, she would take the call, speak briefly, and continue with lunch. But if she could see that it wasn't going to work out, she would have to return to work immediately for some dire emergency. When he quotes a line from Annie Hall, the movie they saw on their one-and-only date, and is visibly hurt that she doesn't remember it, she knows it just isn't working.It was at precisely that point that I also knew it wasn't working, this film wasn't working. I could do without St. Emilio's Fire. I only wish I had set up a friend to call me so I could pretend to be called away to some emergency. Though the film doesn't really work for me, I think it is nevertheless a powerful historical document that speaks volumes about the attitudes and mores of the time. In retrospect, Demi Moore and Rob Lowe would seem to be following the career path laid out by Jules. Though Moore doesn't have her own talk show yet, her tabloid antics have kept her in the public eye. In 1988 Rob Lowe starred in an interesting straight-to-video project that earned him 20 hours of community service. It happened at the Democratic Convention in Georgia, and rang the death knell for any political aspirations Mr. Lowe may have harbored, at least as far as the Democratic Party was concerned, which dropped him like a hot rock. Lately though he has been playing a Republican Senator on television, and in 2003 he was an enthusiastic supporter of Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just as the Reagan Republicans embraced Frank Sinatra after JFK shunned him for his alleged organized crime affiliations, I'm sure the GOP would be glad to stoop that Lowe.Hey, GOP, Demi, Rob, just kidding. The bottom line is that St. Elmo's Fire didn't work as a film for me, but it was an interesting cultural artifact. With seven main characters, Schumacher was juggling a lot of balls, and he dropped quite a few. The finale, when they all come together to aid one of their own who's in a personal crisis is a silly train wreck. The love triangle is not resolved in a satisfactory fashion. Demi Moore as Jules has a few flashes of brilliance, but then it is destroyed by her hair do, a hideous perm with ruffled ridges!

I'm partial to 80s stuff for nostalgic reasons, and this was an enjoyable movie to watch, even though I have almost nothing in common with any of the characters.I liked the cast of actors, and like the idea of a story about young people making the transition to adulthood and the real world, but wow, some of these characters were really messed up!  One thing I kept coming back to is how poorly college prepared these kids for real life - and this is sadly true in real life in a large number of instances.One of the things that made the movie appealing is the friendship between the seven of them, although this got strained along the way.  I had a lot of ""good"" friends, but nothing like what's portrayed in the film.  I suspect that's true of many people.  It makes the viewer like them because they like each other, if that makes sense.  I think the suggestion in the end is that these guys would always be friends, but the reality is that most school friendships fade when people go different places and different ways.

161349,A103KNDW8GN92L,0800109481,David Hugaert,"[11, 16]","""St. Elmo's Fire"" takes somewhat of a surrealist look into the lives of seven friends' post-collegiate experiences. Although the personal and social lives of these seven individuals feature some storybook personas, there's still some very realistic scenes neatly contained within certain happy-go-lucky career-oriented sequences this film conveys, such as the case of Judd Nelson's charater's political aspirations of switching parties from Democratic to Republican, seeing as how it was the 1980's thing to do, but hey, whatever makes him happy. Another such ""happy-go-lucky"" scenario featured here is Emilio Estevez's character's desire to be that of an ""errand boy"" type, working for a hot shot businessman while getting his own chauffeur, all the while not having to lift a finger. What makes this scenario more fantasy-based than anything is seeing as how and why a recent college graduate with a law degree would rather opt at being a gopher for some rich guy instead of starting his own law practice, where he could make limitless amounts of money. Beats me. Aside from the fantasy-based scenes, there are plenty of dramatic hooks that make ""St. Elmo's Fire"" worth viewing, such as the different characters dealing with other career decisions and loves lost (and regained). All the main performers' acting is top-notch, especially Demi Moore's (in an early film role). Moore has a scene where she's featured virtually by herself, which will bring a tear or two to the eye. Andrew McCarthy, Ally Sheedy, Mare Winningham and Rob Lowe deserve many kudos for their fine performances here as well. Since this is a feature which stars much of ""The Brat Pack"" cast, including the degree of  ""teenage-like"" angst and socio-political views prominently displayed in the storyline, one would think this is a John Hughes written and directed film, but it isn't. ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (at least) was directed by Joel Schumacher, although Hughesian themes run rampant throughout much of this movie, as mentioned in the prior sentence. Even Molly Ringwald could have had a place all her own here (why she wasn't included in the cast remains a rather profound mystery to me!). All of the scenes, whether realistic or not, were well written and well thought out, which make ""St. Elmo's Fire"" a motion picture worthy of adding to your video library today! Even the soundtrack is an essential must-own as well (featuring cuts from John Parr, David Foster, Jon Anderson and others)!",5,One of The Brat Pack's Best,1036886400,"11 10, 2002",2002,2465,"['St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'somewhat', 'surrealist', 'look', 'lives', 'seven', 'friends', 'post-collegiate', 'experiences', 'personal', 'social', 'lives', 'seven', 'individuals', 'feature', 'storybook', 'personas', 'still', 'very', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'neatly', 'contained', 'certain', 'happy-go-lucky', 'career-oriented', 'sequences', 'film', 'conveys', 'such', 'case', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'charater', 'political', 'aspirations', 'switching', 'parties', 'Democratic', 'Republican', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', '1980', 'thing', 'do', 'hey', 'happy', 'such', 'happy-go-lucky', 'scenario', 'featured', 'here', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'character', 'desire', 'be', 'errand', 'boy', 'type', 'working', 'hot', 'shot', 'businessman', 'getting', 'own', 'chauffeur', 'while', 'not', 'having', 'lift', 'finger', 'What', 'scenario', 'more', 'fantasy-based', 'anything', 'seeing', 'how', 'why', 'recent', 'college', 'graduate', 'law', 'degree', 'would', 'rather', 'opt', 'being', 'gopher', 'rich', 'guy', 'instead', 'starting', 'own', 'law', 'practice', 'where', 'could', 'make', 'limitless', 'amounts', 'money', 'Aside', 'fantasy-based', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'dramatic', 'hooks', 'make', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'worth', 'viewing', 'such', 'different', 'characters', 'dealing', 'other', 'career', 'decisions', 'lost', 'regained', 'main', 'performers', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'early', 'film', 'role', 'Moore', 'scene', 'where', 'featured', 'virtually', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'two', 'eye', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'deserve', 'many', 'kudos', 'fine', 'performances', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'feature', 'much', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'cast', 'including', 'degree', 'teenage-like', 'angst', 'socio-political', 'views', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'storyline', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'John', 'Hughes', 'written', 'directed', 'film', ""n't"", 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'least', 'was', 'directed', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Hughesian', 'themes', 'run', 'rampant', 'much', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'prior', 'sentence', 'Even', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'place', 'own', 'here', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'cast', 'rather', 'profound', 'mystery', 'scenes', 'realistic', 'not', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'make', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'motion', 'picture', 'worthy', 'adding', 'video', 'library', 'today', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'essential', 'must-own', 'well', 'featuring', 'cuts', 'John', 'Parr', 'David', 'Foster', 'Jon', 'Anderson', 'others']",N/A

161351,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0800109481,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[32, 36]","The mid-80's was about conservatism, Reaganomics, Miami Vice and a time where people were not fully aware about AIDS and were thinking more about working together to bring food to Africa.  This was the sign of the times and for director Joel Schumacher (""The Lost Boys"", ""Flatliners"", ""Batman Forever"", ""8MM"", etc.), while he was working on his second film ""D.C. Cab"", during a short stay at Georgetown, he observed graduating college students at Georgetown University and wondered how miserable some of them maybe, of having to graduate but now become adults.It was right there and then that Schumacher wanted to make a film based on these type of college graduates who face problems of transitioning to adulthood.  In order to capture the life of a young adults graduating college, Schumacher tapped into recent college graduate, Karl Kurlander (""Saved by the Bell: The New Class"" and ""Malibu, CA"") and together they began working on ""St. Elmo's Fire"".  Schumacher had renowned musician and producer David Foster (who wrote major hit songs for ""Karate Kid, Part II"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""The Bodyguard"", etc.) working on his first film as a composer and cinematographer Stephn H. Burm (""The Untouchables"", ""Snake Eyes"", ""Mystery Men"", etc.).But what the film would be known for is the cast in which David Blum of New Yorker Magazine would dub as ""The Brat Pack"", a title that would be synonymous with Hollywood's popular young talents: Emilio Estevez (""Breakfast Club"", ""The Mighty Ducks"" films and ""Young Guns"" films), Rob Lowe (""The West Wing"", ""Brothers & Sisters"", ""About Last Night..."", etc.), Andrew McCarthy (""Lipstick Jungle"", ""Weekend at Bernies"" and ""The Joy Luck Club""), Demi Moore (""Indecent Proposal"", ""G.I. Jane"", ""Ghost"", etc.), Judd Nelson (""Breakfast Club"", ""Airheads"", ""Suddenly Susan"", etc.), Ally Sheedy (""Kyle XY"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Oxford Blues"", ""WarGames"", etc.) and Mare Winningham (""Clubhouse"", ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""Wyatt Earp"", etc.).The film revolves around seven college graduates of Georgetown University who are starting off on their own careers or trying to find a job.Kirby Keger (Emilio Estevez) - Studying to become a lawyer and works as a waiter at St. Elmo's Bar.  He is obsessed with Dale Biberman (Andie McDowell) and will do what it takes to go out on a date with her or to at least be acknowledged by her.Billy Hicks (Rob Lowe) - A father who is trying to find ways to support his girlfriend and child.  But at the same time, he's a playboy that likes to have fun, likes to drink and be with many women.  He tries to have a fling with the group's virgin Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham).  A musician who plays the saxophone, he is unable to hold onto a job and is looked as a hero at his college (because of his ability to find drugs and sell them to the students).  Tends to think with his penis than his head most of the time.Kevin Dolenz (Andrew McCarthy) - Lives with Kirby, a writer, always smoking and the quiet one of the group.  Tend to be seen as a homosexual because he doesn't go after women publicly and even looked by his own friends as possibly a gay man who hasn't come out of the closet.  Kevin is in love with someone but isn't telling.  His friend Jules thinks Kevin is in love with Alec.Jules (Demi Moore) - The socialite sporting the latest fashions and always partying.  The carefree friend but behind-the-scenes, things are not as rosy with her life as it would it seem.Alec Newbary (Judd Nelson) - The future politician who ran the Young Democrats in college and now works for a Republican.  Dates Leslie and wants her to marry him in order for him to end his desires of sleeping with other women.  The friend that others looked up to for leadership.Leslie Hunter (Ally Sheedy) - The architect who is dating Alec.  The friend that is level headed but is not sure she wants to get married just yet and wants to establish her own career.Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham) - The wealthy daughter and the virgin.  She is attracted to Billy but gets upset when he keeps asking her if she's still a virgin. Her father pressures her on how to live her life and that she should marry a guy from a wealthy family for the purpose of a family/business transaction.The film focuses on these seven friends and how they thought that after graduating college, their friendship would continue to be strong and they would be together.  But all learn that as they grow older and focus on their careers, their life as a group and as friends will start to change.VIDEO & AUDIO:""St. Elmo's Fire"" gets its HD treatment via 1080p High Definition.  For the most part, the positive is that the film looks much better than many 80's films that tend to receive a lot of DNR and overall look too soft and are devoid of colors.  With ""St. Elmo's Fire"", there are lot of colors and scenes such as Jules pink and red apartment that look vibrant but at the same time, there was some banding that can be seen prominently in Jules apartment (towards the end of the film when Billy is talking to her) and some darker scenes with light emitting.  Granted, if you are sitting far from your television, this won't be as noticeable.  In fact, I didn't catch these until I rewatched certain scenes during my testing and saw the artifacts when I was  3-4 ft. away.  But for the most part, the picture quality was satisfactory, considering this film didn't have much of a budget.As for audio, the film is featured in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital) and the film is primarily a dialogue driven film.  Dialogue is understandable and clear.  And of course, David Foster's ""Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire"" and the other 80's music featured on the soundtrack comes alive during the film.  There are some scenes especially at the bar that utilize the ambiance of a crowded room and is heard through the surrounds but for the most part, this film is driven by its characters and its soundtrack.As for subtitles, English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese are included.SPECIAL FEATURES:St. Elmo's Fire comes with the following special features:* Commentary with Director Joel Schumacher - The commentary by Joel Schumacher at the most part is quite informative and sets up the scenes, working with talent and for the most part, Schumacher really goes in depth about the film and the people he worked with on the making of the film.  A lot of the commentary is similar to what he discusses in the ""Joel Schumacher Remembers St. Elmo's Fire"" featurette.* Joel Schumacher Remembers St. Elmo's Fire - (14:21) The following is a Blu-ray exclusive and director Joel Schumacher talks about how the talents were cast for their roles, how the term ""brat pack"" started, how no studios wanted to do the film and despite the negative critic reviews, the audiences were very supportive of the film.  Overall, a wonderful retrospective by Joel Schumacher.  If anything, the discussion of how the talents were cast for the film, especially Demi Moore was quite interesting.  Also, his disdain towards the term ""brat pack"".* Original Making of Featurette - (8:43) A featurette from 1985 featuring interviews with the talents and how Rob Lowe had to learn how to play the saxophone in a short amount of time for this film and interview with director Joel Schumacher.* Music Video: John Parr - ""Man in Motion"" - (4:21) The original music video in standard definition of ""Man in Motion"" featuring John Parr (and the talent from ""St. Elmo's Fire"").* Deleted Scenes - (15:41) An exclusive for the Blu-ray release (and in standard definition with scratches and dust galore), this section features 12 deleted scenes which include:  Too Young, a New Car, How About Lunch, There is No Billy the Kid, The Woman in the Fur Coat, Someone Tell Me What Happened, I'm a Loser, Secret Obsession, Just Pick a Date, A Very Well Dressed Fool, Where is the Defroster and That's My Dad.  Although some deleted scenes are quite short, there are a few scenes that get into the relationship of Wendy and her father who is trying to dictate of how she should live her life.* BD-Live - This blu-ray is BD-Live enabled.JUDGMENT CALL:""St. Elmo's Fire"" was a film not exactly well respected by critics when it first came out.  But the film was part of a string of ""Brat Pack"" related films that would star these talents along with Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall and would define high school and young adult films in the 1980's.The film was not well-respected because of the times.  These were young adults that were quite liberal during a conservative era and most of them were not being shown in the positive light.  These young adults were not perfect and they had their own personal flaws that critics saw as vane and shallow but for audiences, they saw something quite different.For me, to have all these talents together in one film was just awesome.  Ally Sheedy and Judd Nelson were just awesome in ""Breakfast Club"", Rob Lowe in ""Oxford Blues"", Emilio Estevez in ""Repo Man"" and ""The Outsiders"", Mare Winningham appeared on many shows including afterschool specials and Demi Moore was a popular soap star on ""General Hospital"" years earlier.  And of course, for Andrew McCarthy and Andie McDowell, this film would also help put ignite their careers.And in the 80's, who could not love David Foster's ""Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire"" or John Parr's ""Man in Motion"".  These were overplayed on the radio and MTV that ""St. Elmo's Fire"" was literally ingrained into pop culture.  And of course, the term ""Brat Pack"" (as many of them despised the name), for audiences... being part of that group was just the epitome of ""cool"".Watching this film nearly 25 years later, it's hard to believe that so much time has passed and how different high school and young adult films are today.  Director Joel Schumacher said that he wanted to create a film with young talent but make it an ""A film"".  These issues that the seven go through, this stress and anguish of starting a career and also suffering setbacks after graduation is real.  Not everyone who graduates college, is able to have a successful life, and this even rings true so much now especially during our poor economy.For the Blu-ray release, it's great to watch this film on High Definition but it's also great to have the Blu-ray exclusive features with Joel Schumacher remembering St. Elmo's Fire and seeing the deleted scenes for the first time.  Although this film is not called a ""25th Anniversary"" edition of the film, it's pretty close.  The only thing one could hope for is a reunion of these talents to discuss the film or even if it was a few of them, to interview them today about ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (note: For the Blu-ray release of the 1986 film ""About Last Night..."", the director and Rob Lowe are brought back 23 years later to discuss their experiences on the film).Nevertheless, I have more appreciation of ""St. Elmo's Fire"" as an adult compared to when I was a teenager in high school and catching the film on HBO.  I can now understand the wide range of emotions that these characters are going through after graduating from college.  Granted, some situations are a bit extreme but the feelings of friendship drifting part are so real.I also realized of how well this group of talent worked together and found the group to be well-cast.  This ""Brat Pack"" or individual talents went on to become big stars on their own but even back in 1985, it was still a remarkable feat. to have each of these seven individuals together in one film.  It's not something that can be easily duplicated today, especially knowing that this film was created on a tight budget and short schedule.I would imagine that ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of those films that people who grew up during that time will gravitate to, partly for nostalgia reasons.  But watching it nearly 25-years-later, outside of nostalgia, I found that watching this film much more enjoyable now and quite entertaining!  For 80's film fans or ""Brat Pack"" film fans, ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is definitely worth picking up on Blu-ray!",4,Blu-ray:  Much more entertaining to watch this time around.  May not be the definitive 25th anniversary release but looks great!,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,12090,"['mid-80', 'was', 'conservatism', 'Reaganomics', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'time', 'where', 'people',

Some of these actor's (like Demi Moore and Rob Lowe) would go on to further their careers and become more prolific in their careers.  At the apex of the 80's genre of movies is the coming of age film St. Elmo's Fire.  If you have followed the Brat Pack throughout the years (and in the 80's specifically) you'll recognize a little more drama in this film versus other Brat Pack films that contain Molly Ringwald such asPRETTY IN PINK.St. Elmo's Fire contains everything you would expect or want in a movie:  romance, sexual tension, anomie, drama, addiction, resolution, unrequited love.  I could go on and on but just wanted to express that STILL after 20 years or so this movie is one of my all time favorites.  If you were a fan of the John Hughes films, you need to check this one out too.

And quickly discover that the working world can hit back.  Their plans do not survive contact with reality.  The real world turns out to be a lot different that what they dreamed about from the safety of their college watering hole, the St. Elmo's Fire of the title.  Our heroes struggle, make mistakes, and sometimes, have touching moments of discovery.The movie isn't bad, but it doesn't really seem to go anywhere.  There is no tidy ending.

161358,AAJ1IYOUIHWF,0800109481,D. Sun,"[0, 0]","St. Elmos Fire made me consider going to Georgetown as a little kid. The music from that movie captivated me when I first heard it and I can't explain why.Over the years I've had that theme playing and have had people freak out. Some people love the music and wanted me to turn it off and others faced my wrath when they reached over to touch my stereo - they couldn't stand listening to the music.This movie just reminds me of the 80's, being in college, first graduating, losing touch of friends as they move on, being on my own and paying my own bills the first time.The story is mixed up and I think the confusion and lack of any overall plot beyond showcasing bits of each characters life after college and their dreams, problems, hopes, and desires.It somehow works and there are just classic moments from the film that touch different emotions. Kirby outside in the snow with the girl he fixates on. The shower scene. Tossing ashes into the stirfry. The Billy Idol entire wall mural. Playing football in front of the frat houses. The keys down the pants.It's hard for a film like this to stay relevant and in many ways with the speed of how things move now I highly doubt many people who didn't experience the 80's can relate to the film.Still, if you ignore the haircuts, clothes, and dated items in the film the concept of graduating and experiencing real life for grads now is probably harder for many kids now than back then and perhaps in this area they can relate.",3,Reminds me of College,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,1477,"['St.', 'Elmos', 'Fire', 'made', 'consider', 'going', 'Georgetown', 'little', 'kid', 'music', 'movie', 'captivated', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'years', ""'ve"", 'had', 'theme', 'playing', 'have', 'had', 'people', 'freak', 'out', 'people', 'love', 'music', 'wanted', 'turn', 'off', 'others', 'faced', 'wrath', 'when', 'reached', 'touch', 'stereo', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'listening', 'music.This', 'movie', 'just', '80', 'being', 'college', 'first', 'graduating', 'losing', 'touch', 'friends', 'move', 'being', 'own', 'paying', 'own', 'bills', 'first', 'time.The', 'story', 'mixed', 'think', 'confusion', 'lack', 'overall', 'plot', 'showcasing', 'bits', 'characters', 'life', 'college', 'dreams', 'problems', 'hopes', 'desires.It', 'somehow', 'works', 'are', 'just', 'classic', 'moments', 'film', 'touch', 'different', 'emotions', 'Kirby', 'snow', 'girl', 'shower', 'scene', 'Tossing', 'ashes', 'stirfry', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'entire', 'wall', 'mural', 'Playing', 'football', 'front', 'frat', 'houses', 'keys', 'down', 'pants.It', 'hard', 'film', 'stay', 'relevant', 'many', 'ways', 'speed', 'how', 'things', 'move', 'now', 'highly', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'experience', '80', 'can', 'relate', 'film.Still', 'ignore', 'haircuts', 'clothes', 'dated', 'items', 'film', 'concept', 'graduating', 'experiencing', 'real', 'life', 'grads', 'now', 'probably', 'harder', 'many', 'kids', 'now', 'back', 'then', 'perhaps', 'area', 'can', 'relate']",N/A
161359,AGT6DON34HIIT,0800109481,"Edward P. Trimnell ""edwardtrimnell.com""","[14, 19]","St. Elmo's Fire is a coming-of-age movie that will have a certain nostalgic appeal to anyone who was a teenager or a 20-something in the mid-1980s. It will be of limited interest to anyone else, unless you are excessively interested in the pop culture of that era.The main characters of St. Elmo's Fire are seven recent college graduates who are beginning their professional lives. As other reviewers have noted, these people aren't credible as an ensemble of friends---nor are they particularly believable on their own merits. Somewhere in this mess is a story about the transition from adolescence to adulthood; but the inconsistent characters and disjointed plotlines distract the viewer from the larger themes.To cite just one example: Emilio Estevez's character, Kirby, develops a severe infatuation with an older woman. He acts out his obsession in ways that would disturb anyone, even threatening the woman's roommate at one point. But the woman who is the object of his desires seems to regard these antics as vaguely cute. People were not quite as sensitive about stalking and sexual harassment in the 1980s as they are today; but this behavior would have been over the top even then. No woman would have tolerated this, much less found it endearing.Demi Moore's character, Jules, is a compulsive liar who becomes addicted to cocaine. No adequate explanation is ever given for her behavior. Throughout the movie, she moves from one unexplained crisis to the next.

161362,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,0800109481,Gavin Wilson,"[6, 8]","This film presents a wonderfully/hopelessly romantic view of friendship as seven buddies make the transition from college to jobs. Although I had a set of close friends at university, this film made me insanely jealous that my friendships didn't seem as frank and open as they are here. Or maybe it was just that my coterie hadn't included Ally Sheedy.Many of the actors, though just starting out, already seemed to be type-cast. Emilio Estevez plays someone totally obsessed by a girl (Andie MacDowell) -- in today's climate, he could justifiably be prosecuted for stalking and harassment. Demi Moore's character (Jules) lives the high life, way beyond her means and control, and everyone's worried about her. Rob Lowe plays Billy, a philanderer who can't hold down a job or a family.The demands of the plot mean that, though this cluster of seven was close-knit at college, all the swapping of partners seems to happen only once they graduate. (In my experience, most of the partner-switching happened at college, not afterwards.)Where this film scores so well is with the message that, despite all the flare-ups and other incidents, these friendships are for life. Yes, people will drift apart -- here symbolised by Billy's somewhat optimistic career move to New York -- but you just know that some day, they will meet up again.Life in many of its colours is shown here, and the most implausible element is the idea that Rob Lowe's character could ever apply himself sufficiently to pass the college graduation exams.  And, in my opinion, many of the plot ideas were shamelessly plundered by Richard Curtis for 'Four Weddings' and 'Love Actually'.",4,Was friendship ever really like this?,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1650,"['film', 'wonderfully/hopelessly', 'romantic', 'view', 'friendship', 'seven', 'buddies', 'make', 'transition', 'college', 'jobs', 'had', 'set', 'close', 'friends', 'university', 'film', 'made', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'friendships', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'frank', 'open', 'are', 'here', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'coterie', 'had', ""n't"", 'included', 'Ally', 'Sheedy.Many', 'actors', 'though', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'already', 'seemed', 'be', 'type-cast', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'someone', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'girl', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'today', 'climate', 'could', 'justifiably', 'be', 'prosecuted', 'stalking', 'harassment', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'Jules', 'high', 'life', 'way', 'means', 'control', 'everyone', 'worried', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Billy', 'philanderer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'family.The', 'demands', 'plot', 'mean', 'cluster', 'seven', 'was', 'close-knit', 'college', 'swapping', 'partners', 'happen', 'only', 'once', 'graduate', 'experience', 'most', 'partner-switching', 'happened', 'college', 'not', 'afterwards', 'Where', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'message', 'flare-ups', 'other', 'incidents', 'friendships', 'are', 'life', 'Yes', 'people', 'will', 'drift', 'apart', 'here', 'symbolised', 'Billy', 'somewhat', 'optimistic', 'career', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'just', 'know', 'day', 'will', 'meet', 'up', 'again.Life', 'many', 'colours', 'shown', 'here', 'most', 'implausible', 'element', 'idea', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'character', 'could', 'ever', 'apply', 'sufficiently', 'pass', 'college', 'graduation', 'exams', 'opinion', 'many', 'plot', 'ideas', 'were', 'shamelessly', 'plundered', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Weddings', ""'Love"", 'Actually']",N/A

161372,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0800109481,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 5]","This excellent movie chronicles the lives of seven friends after their graduation from Georgetown University.  Alec (Judd Nelson) is an aspiring politician who has become an aide to a United States Senator.  His girlfriend Leslie (Ally Sheedy) is feeling pressured by Alec to make a commitment to marriage which she is not yet ready to make.  Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) is a no-nonsense thinker in his views on life.  He believes that there is no such thing as a good marriage, and people make their own happiness.  He is also secretly in love with Leslie, and this triangle of Alec, Kevin, and Leslie will progress as the movie goes on.  Kirby (Emilio Estevez) is a law school graduate who is infatuated with an older former classmate (Andie McDowell).  He pursues her relentlessly throughout the film (by today's standards, it would probably be called stalking).  Billy (Rob Lowe) is the ""rebel"" of the group.  He is also married and has a child.  Despite this, he still chases women and hangs out at bars while his wife stays home with the baby.  However, Billy has a soft side and is knowledgeable about people in general.  Jules (Demi Moore) is the drug-addicted princess wannabe.  She tries to fool her friends into believing that she is living a glamorous life and having a relationship with her boss when in reality she has been fired from her job and the creditors have taken all of her possessions.  It takes some quick action from the rest of the group to keep Jules from killing herself after the creditors took her stuff.  Finally, there is Wendy (Mare Winningham).  She lives with a controlling father and mother who refuse to let her live on her own, and they try to arrange a relationship for her with a man she doesn't even like.  She really cares for Billy.The story content of the movie is excellent .  How many of us who developed a close group of friends while away at college wanted to hold onto those relationships forever despite graduating and facing new challenges?  This aspect is played out perfectly in the movie.  Even after graduation, the group manages to stay close and they even go to the same bar that they hung out at during college.The film does a good job of handling the conflicts of life as well.  For instance, the rift in Alec's and Leslie's relationship is a major part of the film, and when Kevin professes his love for Leslie after her and Alec break up, the dynamics are changed that much more.  Also, I thought that Billy's story of him and his family struggles was a high point of the movie, as is Jules problems with self-esteem and drug addiction.This is an excellent movie.  All of the actors (known by critics as the ""Brat Pack"") give top-notch performances, and the story is one that many of us can directly relate to; the fear of moving on after graduating from college and losing contact with our college friends.  Also, who could forget the wonderful theme music as well as John Parr's powerful ""Man in Motion"" song?I give this movie my highest recommendation.

However, the actors really make this a great film about love life in the adult world.The film features some of the best actors in the 80s, such as Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Mare Winningham, Demi Moore and Ally Sheedy. Each of their characters bring something different in the complex set of romances. They all play college graduates trying to succeed in the adult world.Kirby Kaeger (Emilio Estevez) hopes to become a lawyer, but he's still peeking out of the corner of his eye at Dale Biberman (Andie McDowell), an older hospital intern.Billy Hicks (Rob Lowe) is a frat boy who can't keep a job and has trouble making enough money to support his wife and baby, but can play the saxophone really well.Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham) is a shy virgin who devotes her life to helping people in Social Services. She wants to break away from her overprotective family, who is pushing her to marry someone she doesn't love. Meanwhile, Wendy still loves talking to Billy.Julianna ""Jules"" Van Patten (Demi Moore) is the ""party girl"" who is in love with her boss at the bank. She lives extravagantly in a fancy apartment, but longs for the love she couldn't find from her emotionally distant father.Alec Newbury is an ambitious Democrat political worker in a relationship with Leslie Hunter (Ally Sheedy), a woman who wants to become an architect before getting married. However, Alec is cheating on Leslie, and Kevin Dolenz (Andrew McCarthy), is Alec's friend who knows about Alec's many relationships.With so many characters and only 110 minutes, the movie almost goes too quickly for the characters to fully develop. However, all the actors give such fine performances that it all somehow works out. Yes, even when the characters are almost ripping each other's lungs out, they all somehow stay friends.I'm still not sure how many 80s kids were really bratty kids who smoked, had sex and took drugs. Still, this is a reasonably good film about teenage friendship. I still think this is one of those films that 80s kids would like more than I did, because I'm a 90s kid who prefers grunge and mosh pits.

Years can go by without my even stepping foot into a movie theater. That said, I love this movie and have seen it thirty dozen times at least. I know others have loathed this film for the overwrought ""self-centeredness"" of its characters, but it came out just at the right time for me: I was a sophomore/junior in college and was just beginning to deal with some of the same post-graduate career/relationship/self-searching issues the characters were dealing with right after their college graduation. I identified just a little with each of them. (I have to add, because it was important to me at the time, that the clothes were to-die-for. As a poor, not-well-dressed student I remember coveting Leslie's and Jules' wardrobes intensely, and they represented the best of trendy fashion for that period.) Still, there are some things that just don't compute. Why did the film makers decide to use Georgetown University? And how could party animals Billy and Jules EVER have passed a single class, let alone graduate from a school like that? This is not ""Party State University"" like the school I graduated from. Georgetown has ""standards."" I don't see how could they have even gotten into that school. Since they had to film the campus scenes at the University of Maryland, why couldn't they have just used that school rather than Georgetown? It would have been more believable. Jules must have a few decent, undamaged brain cells as she apparently was recruited into a high-profile, high-paying job at a bank right out of school. Nerdy, awkward Wendy Beamish doesn't fit into the rest of the crowd. IRL, she might have been friendly with Ally Sheedy's character, Leslie, but I have no idea what it is she has in common with the rest them that keeps her in the core of the group. IRL, they would have considered her hopelessly uncool and dorky and would have had nothing to do with her. But, of course, this isn't IRL. Which is just as well because Kirby's storyline -- stalking a beautiful woman he admits to being obsessed with -- wouldn't have lasted 5 ""real life"" minutes. He'd be hauled into court and would have a restraining order against him.

This is not a dead serious, scholarly film, neither does it claim to have any intelligence other than the little it might. However, considering the fact that it's really quite fluff, I rate it as fluff - and, for that, it's good. [Talk about awkward and uninteresting openings.]The heyday of the Brat Pack! The Reagan era! Wretched excess in everything from fashion to lifestyle...This movie has many very funny moments, ones that were probably not seen as such when this was made, but as we look back at this film from 16 years later, there are just some things that are hysterical. Too, there are some funny moments, timeless ones. My favorite line has to be the exchange on the fire escape: &quot;...We need an experienced thief.&quot; &quot;I'll get Billy.&quot; Yeah, so it only works if you've seen the film. Like so many other inside jokes, you can't quite tell if the director was poking fun at self-indulgent college grads or just pondering won't-grow-up-ever's.But hey. That's why they called it the Brat Pack. And it's quite a showcase of actors &amp; talents, a group well suited to working together. Emilio Estevez is the weakest link here, a pigfaced jerk whom you can feel NO, read that NO, sympathy for. Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, both good actors in their own rights, create a good sense of repartee. Rob Lowe: Man, gives the legacy of Jim Morrison a whole new twinge. Very - how does one say this without undermining acting ability - gorgeous, alright? And honestly, the guy's got chops. This role is good, indulgent eye candy.  The women are really good. I don't honestly like Demi Moore, but this role suits her frenetic personality and high-maintenance looks. Ally Sheedy is in what I consider the best character role of the film, Mare Winningham gets to look absolutely awful but gets compensation - if you call it that - for this in the end, in the form of a going-away present.

First you have Rob Lowe who is simply gorgeous as Billy, a guy who can't decide what he's going to do after graduating college.  He plays the sax (quite well I might add) for fun and sometimes for money.Then you have Julie (Demi Moore in a wonderful performance), who is very high-strung after learning about her father's marriage to another woman.  Her life is basically like kettle with hot water that is about to boil.  She's happy then she's sad, then she's manic...She's everything!  But she does a wonderful job.I loved seeing Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy together.  After seeing ""The Breakfast Club,"" I never thought I'd see them as a couple.  They are cute together and the scenes they share are fun to watch.Emilio Estevez's performance was just as wonderful as the others.  He falls in love with a doctor (Andie McDowell) who is already involved with someone else, but he's determined to make things go his way.  It doesn't work, but watching him try to make it work is just as much fun.Andrew McCarthy is a lot of fun to watch.  Everyone thinks he's gay because he doesn't have a girlfriend and doesn't date very much.  It's a typical stereotype, but I got over that.  The end of the movie proves that he is not gay.  Mare Winningham gives a stunning performance as a girl who comes from a very wealthy family.  She loves Billy but her father wants her to marry a successful businessman.  Since she is 'daddy's girl,' she doesn't want to disappoint him.Overall, this movie is just fun to watch and listening to the director's commentary is great.

It is sort of the 80s equivalent of ""Reality Bites"" - but with just a few more actors and more sub-plots. I think the struggles these kids are facing are very well and authentically documented. I graduated about 20 years after these kids and faced the same issues and challenges - like finding a job, a place to live, figure out what I really wanted to do with my life and commiserating with my friends who were suddenly stuck in crappy jobs that sucked the joy out of living.On another note: I dont think Demi Moore was acting in this movie. It is well known that at the time she was in fact struggling with drug abuse and that the director fired her until she got clean. She did get her act together and came back to the set but from the looks of it, there apparently wasnt much, or any, acting required on her part. It is interesting to see that stars who everyone has put on a pedestal and decided to praise as either talented or gifted, have in actuality such trashy, demented and sad pasts.

The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation ""Graduate"" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.",2,The Brat Pack and those enormous granny panties,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,1916,"['was', 'movie', 'gave', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'staple', 'certain', '80s', 'cultural', 'set', 'term', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'was', 'derived', 'article', 'writen', 'journalist', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'most', 'men', 'starring', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'boozy', 'night', 'partying', 'then', 'gals', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'others', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'example', 'suffered', 'bit', 'ripple', 'effect', 'Here', 'will', 'see', 'prime', 'peak', 'heart', 'throb', 'success', 'teenage', 'girl', 'bedroom', 'wall.Out', 'dramedies', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movies', 'was', 'one', 'liked', 'least', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'vain', 'self', 'centered', 'Maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'idealized', 'seeing', 'trying', 'adjust', 'lives', 'graduating', 'college', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'next', 'generation', 'Graduate', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'relate', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'Maybe', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'let', 'down', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'network', 'friends', 'similar', 'situations', 'isolation', 'felt', 'first', 'year', 'adjusting', 'outside', 'world', 'having', 'left', 'nest', 'academia', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'bitter', 'life', 'was', 'surrounded', 'work', 'little', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'dramas', 'going', 'was', 'kind', 'sad', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'back', 'old', 'frat', 'house', 'tell', 'need', 'someone', 'couch', 'team', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'again', 'are', 'clinging', 'past', 'Not', 'mention', 'embarrassing', 'one', 'gal', 'who', 'managed', 'hold', 'virginity', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'attempts', 'releive', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'enormous', 'granny', 'panties.This', 'caputed', 'more', 'time', 'fashion', 'music', 'did', 'mindset', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'vain', 'self', 'centered', 'antics', 'main', 'characters', 'left', 'cold']",N/A

The film is about yuppie angst instead of the usual teen angst depicted in like kind films of the era.  The seven stars, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Mare Winningham and Judd Nelson are all appealing, but the film suffers from an overall malaise.  All seven are friends from Georgetown University and they trying to cope with the problems facing them in the real world.  There is a lot of unrequited love between several of the friends, drug use and emotional baggage.  Mr. Lowe's character is supposed to the one character that, instead of getting to the wrong marriage or job, just follows his dreams.  His speech to Ms. Moore, who is on the verge of a serious mental breakdown or worse, in which he lights hair spray on fire is truly cringe worthy.  Overall, St. Elmo's Fire is more of a cultural document, showing what yuppie life was like in the mid-80's and the state of the young and upcoming stars of Hollywood at the time.

161416,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,0800109481,Silver Screen,"[2, 6]","""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't.It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).  Maybe this was supposed to be ""The Breakfast Club - - After College"", but while ""The Breakfast Club"" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film.The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, RIGHT.Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?)  Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell.  Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her.  She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies.  Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol.Sounds promising, huh?  Well, in what is an early portend of the ""Melrose Place"" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her.  He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home.  Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus.  Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out.Not exactly ""The Breakfast Club"".The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves.  With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped.  Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional.  Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that.Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was.  And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable.  But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent.Lowe really had little to do with his role.  Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better.  With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him.  Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player.Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired.While the title song later become a minor hit, ""St. Elmo's Fire"" itself missed the mark.",2,The Brat Pack Comes of Age,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,4345,"['St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'one', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'yet', 'just', ""wasn't.It"", 'featured', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'THE', 'young', 'hot', 'stars', '1980s', 'so-called', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'well', 'everyone', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'who', 'were', 'spared', 'misstep', 'Maybe', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'College', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'had', 'characters', 'even', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'could', 'relate', 'absolutely', 'one', 'exception', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'character', 'care', 'enough', 'relate', 'film.The', 'setting', 'not', 'John', 'Hughes', 'teen', 'friendly', 'Illinois', 'Georgetown', 'where', 'bunch', 'Brat', 'Packers', 'have', 'supposedly', 'graduated', 'college', 'Uh-huh', 'Yeah', 'RIGHT.Judd', 'Nelson', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'are', 'living', 'together', 'supposedly', 'looking', 'marriage', 'problem', 'Nelson', 'looking', 'screwing', 'everything', 'else', 'female', 'walks', 'somehow', 'hoping', 'Sheedy', 'prim', 'proper', 'sweater', 'skirt', 'sets', 'pearls', 'can', 'change', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'mutual', 'friend', 'who', 'what', 'Nelson', 'secretly', 'harboring', 'festering', 'desire', 'Sheedy', 'maybe', 'just', 'pearls', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'future', 'attorney', 'working', 'waiter/server', 'suffering', 'serious', 'crush', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'dowdy', 'trust-fund', 'type', 'girl', 'who', 'still', 'holding', 'virginity', 'working', 'social', 'services', 'fighting', 'marrying', 'proper', 'dork', 'parents', 'have', 'selected', 'instead', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'who', 'pretty', 'boy', 'sax', 'player', 'local', 'band', 'who', 'dropped', 'school', 'married', 'white', 'trash-y', 'looking', 'groupie', 'had', 'child', 'now', 'separated', 'taking', 'up', 'other', 'groupies', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'wild', 'chick', 'who', 'international', 'banking', 'serious', 'coke', 'problem', 'stepmother', 'issues', 'problem', 'painting', 'apartment', 'walls', 'hot', 'pink', 'giant', 'murals', 'Billy', 'Idol.Sounds', 'promising', 'huh', 'Well', 'what', 'early', 'portend', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'come', 'Sheedy', 'out', 'what', 'dog', 'Nelson', 'dumps', 'ass', 'immediately', 'bed', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'too', 'desperately', 'love', 'realize', 'rebound', 'job', 'Estevez', 'screwing', 'up', 'lucrative', 'house-sitting', 'job', 'hosting', 'party', 'there', 'travels', 'snowy', 'track', 'down', 'MacDowell', 'profess', 'love', 'holed', 'up', 'there', 'boyfriend', 'being', 'crushed', 'huge', 'kiss', 'then', 'back', 'home', 'Lowe', 'faux-playing', 'sax', 'shaking', 'feathered', 'head', 'everywhere', 'Winningham', 'virginity', 'heads', 'back', 'estranged', 'missus', 'Moore', 'whining', 'seemingly', 'incessantly', 'ill', 'stepmother', 'furnishings', 'repossessed', 'job', 'freaks', 'out.Not', 'exactly', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '.The', 'real', 'problems', 'seem', 'lie', 'characters', 'exception', 'Estevez', 'character', 'seem', 'caricatures', 'horribly', 'stereotyped', 'action', 'line', 'dialogue', 'just', 'seem', 'very', 'one', 'dimensional', 'so-called', 'angst', 'handy', 'plotline', 'device', 'nothing', 'more', 'that.Winningham', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'salvagable', '-except', 'followed', 'Lowe', 'sick', 'puppy', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'how', 'mistreated', 'wife', 'what', 'basic', 'slacker', 'was', 'yet', 'still', 'gave', 'virginity', 'Maybe', 'Winningham', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bright', 'was', 'college', 'freshman', 'would', 'be', 'understandable', 'was', 'college', 'graduate', 'seemingly', 'intelligent.Lowe', 'really', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'role', 'Maybe', 'had', 'played', 'role', 'Nelson', 'had', 'roving', 'Lothario', 'Sheedy', 'waiting', 'home', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'over', 'better', 'too-pretty', 'looks', 'would', 'almost', 'be', 'understandable', 'how', 'character', 'could', 'get', 'random', 'women', 'just', 'met', 'sneak', 'dressing', 'rooms', 'Nelson', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'comfortable', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', '-but', 'maybe', 'Nelson', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'suited', 'sax', 'player.Moore', 'basically', '-an', 'interesting', 'sidenote', 'was', 'originally', 'fired', 'production', 'drug', 'problems', 'mirroring', 'character', 'was', 'later', 'title', 'song', 'later', 'become', 'minor', 'hit', 'St.', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'missed', 'mark']",N/A

161420,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,0800109481,TFR,"[16, 29]","Saw this on dvd the other night and couldn't really believe it.  Here are ten (10) - Count 'em - ten quick and easy obeservations:1.  It's easy to watch ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" from beginning to end, but that's not because it's a great or even a very good story.  It's not.  It's a watchable film due to some other elements that were probably unintentionally included.2.  For those of us who remember the early years of Reaganomics and the recession of the early eighties (Which could easily have gone into a depression), this film brings back memories of how bad things really were at the time.Whether it purports to be or not, ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" is, in large part, about life under the Reagan administration.  It's too bad that Oliver North didn't put in a cameo, but I guess he was probably busy getting weapons to the Contras at that time.3.  I'm not going to summarize something you can see for yourself, but I will say that this film is about a group of seven self-absorbed, terminally cute, whiny  preppies following their graduation from Georgetown University.  Although Rob Lowe deserves every accolade he got for his portrayal of a walking pile of human waste, Demi Moore's character is especially despicable and hateful.4. At the middle of the film, I kept wishing for something dramatic to happen... Like the group goes out in a car and they drive head on into a brick wall at ninety miles an hour.After about an hour of viewing, it's hard to care what happens to any of the characters, because the plot is so contrived. None of the characters portrayed in the film remotely resemble human beings, at least in the way they react to given situations. Each seems about as two dimensional as the life-size cardboard silouhettes of movie stars you'll see in the lobbies of theatres from time to time.  The way the characters react to the world around them doesn't seem real or even remotely possible.To his credit, Emilio Estevez actually does crank out a good performance, but his pursuit of the Andie McDowell character is not just embarassing, it's also borderline behavior.All of the above aside, here's why you should get a copy of ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" and watch it from beginning to end:5.  First of all, ignore the characters, ignore the story, and just cue in on the visuals.It's hard to believe that the eighties really produced such excesses in bad taste, but it's all here on film.  Just check out the Lofts and some of the clothing and hairstyles, to say nothing about the attitudes.6.  All that this movie is not is much greater than what it actually is.""Saint Elmo's Fire"" is a film that precluded ""Seinfeld"" by just a few years.  Check it out!  Like Seinfeld, it has self-absorbed characters you really wouldn't want to know personally, and it's a show about nothing.7.  If you watch ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" with friends, you can actually turn the sound off and make up your own dialogue for the characters as you go along.One of the most confusing aspects of ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" is that there is no clever dialogue, and no jokes, visual or otherwise.  Not one real shed of humor in this film.The upside is that since there isn't any real storyline anyway, with a little imagination, you can have the characters saying things to each other that even R. Lee Ermy would feel weird about!8.  The David Foster Love Theme instrumental is repeated over and over, dozens of times.  Just when you think it's going to stop, it starts up again. Isn't that wonderful?9. Two words, Baby: Chick Flick!10.  Would I recommend this film to my friends? Sure!  Anything's better than watching ""The English Patient"".Bonus Comment:  I predict that by the year 2025, this film will be a tremendously popular camp favorite with people who are yet to be born, or are in their early infancy.By 2025, Ally, Judd, Demi, Emilio and the gang will be enroute to the old actor's home.  By then, kids will look at ""Saint Elmo's Fire"" in much the same way that most kids of today watch movies like ""The Trip"", or ""Hell's Angel's `69"" and think that their parents used to be Martians.",5,Adult Entertainment... almost at it's Best!,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,4066,"['Saw', 'dvd', 'other', 'night', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'Here', 'are', 'ten', '10', 'Count', ""'em"", 'ten', 'quick', 'easy', 'obeservations:1', 'easy', 'watch', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'great', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'watchable', 'film', 'due', 'other', 'elements', 'were', 'probably', 'unintentionally', 'included.2', 'who', 'remember', 'early', 'years', 'Reaganomics', 'recession', 'early', 'eighties', 'Which', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'gone', 'depression', 'film', 'back', 'memories', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'really', 'were', 'time.Whether', 'be', 'not', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'large', 'part', 'life', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'too', 'bad', 'Oliver', 'North', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'cameo', 'guess', 'was', 'probably', 'busy', 'getting', 'weapons', 'Contras', 'time.3', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'summarize', 'something', 'can', 'see', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'group', 'seven', 'self-absorbed', 'terminally', 'cute', 'whiny', 'preppies', 'following', 'graduation', 'Georgetown', 'University', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'accolade', 'got', 'portrayal', 'walking', 'pile', 'human', 'waste', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'especially', 'despicable', 'hateful.4', 'middle', 'film', 'kept', 'wishing', 'something', 'dramatic', 'happen', 'group', 'out', 'car', 'drive', 'head', 'brick', 'wall', 'ninety', 'miles', 'hour.After', 'hour', 'viewing', 'hard', 'care', 'what', 'characters', 'plot', 'so', 'contrived', 'None', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'film', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'human', 'beings', 'least', 'way', 'react', 'given', 'situations', 'two', 'dimensional', 'life-size', 'cardboard', 'silouhettes', 'movie', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lobbies', 'theatres', 'time', 'time', 'way', 'characters', 'react', 'world', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'even', 'remotely', 'possible.To', 'credit', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'actually', 'crank', 'good', 'performance', 'pursuit', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'embarassing', 'also', 'borderline', 'behavior.All', 'above', 'aside', 'here', 'why', 'should', 'get', 'copy', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end:5', 'First', 'ignore', 'characters', 'ignore', 'story', 'just', 'cue', 'visuals.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'eighties', 'really', 'produced', 'such', 'excesses', 'bad', 'taste', 'here', 'film', 'Just', 'check', 'out', 'Lofts', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'say', 'nothing', 'attitudes.6', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'greater', 'what', 'actually', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'film', 'precluded', 'Seinfeld', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'Check', 'out', 'Seinfeld', 'self-absorbed', 'characters', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'personally', 'show', 'nothing.7', 'watch', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'friends', 'can', 'actually', 'turn', 'sound', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'go', 'along.One', 'most', 'confusing', 'aspects', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'jokes', 'visual', 'otherwise', 'Not', 'one', 'real', 'shed', 'humor', 'film.The', 'upside', ""n't"", 'real', 'storyline', 'anyway', 'little', 'imagination', 'can', 'have', 'characters', 'saying', 'things', 'other', 'even', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermy', 'would', 'feel', 'weird', '8', 'David', 'Foster', 'Love', 'Theme', 'instrumental', 'repeated', 'dozens', 'times', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'going', 'stop', 'up', 'again', ""n't"", 'wonderful', '9', 'Two', 'words', 'Baby', 'Chick', 'Flick', '10', 'Would', 'recommend', 'film', 'friends', 'Sure', 'Anything', 'better', 'watching', 'English', 'Patient', '.Bonus', 'Comment', 'predict', 'year', '2025', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'tremendously', 'popular', 'camp', 'favorite', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'yet', 'be', 'born', 'are', 'early', 'infancy.By', '2025', 'Ally', 'Judd', 'Demi', 'Emilio', 'gang', 'will', 'be', 'enroute', 'old', 'actor', 'home', 'then', 'kids', 'will', 'look', 'Saint', 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'kids', 'today', 'watch', 'movies', 'Trip', 'Hell', 'Angel', '69', 'think', 'parents', 'used', 'be', 'Martians']",N/A

We even hung out in a bar (Z's Sports Tap in Chicago, since torn down and replaced by a highrise building) where we were regulars. I like to think we weren't as shallow and useless as the characters in this film, but we were all trying to find our way after being out of college for a few years.

Watching relationships form and fail, and trying to understand where they fit in the world and what they are going to do to make their mark on the world is pretty funny stuff.

There is a glimpse of what might have been in terms of the plot and characters.  It never gets fully fleshed out, though, and we don't really learn much about these people, what motivates them, etc.  Kirbo's fling with Andie MacDowell doesn't really go anywhere, and it's hard to care much about Demi Moore's meltdown towards the end.  As I said, the characters are so flimsy that you can't get very interested in them.  Just not enough substance.Rob Lowe's clothing is amusing.  But why is Mare Winningham dressed as if she were a schoolmarm on Little House on the Prairie?",3,"Okay 80s period piece, good soundtrack",1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,658,"['decent', 'period', 'piece', '1980s', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'terms', 'plot', 'characters', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'learn', 'much', 'people', 'what', 'etc', 'Kirbo', 'fling', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'hard', 'care', 'much', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'meltdown', 'end', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'flimsy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'interested', 'Just', 'not', 'enough', 'substance.Rob', 'Lowe', 'clothing', 'amusing', 'why', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'dressed', 'were', 'schoolmarm', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie']",N/A

I still have major problems with it's overly simplistic and aggressive sentimentality, but despite it's flaws, it's still speaks of a lot of truths with what upper-middle class college grads have to deal with.  The video is outstanding, with no overuse of DNR, and the audio is clean if not underwhelming.
