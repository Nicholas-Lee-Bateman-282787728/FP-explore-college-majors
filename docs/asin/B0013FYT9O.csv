I'm surprised that people posted reviews and criticized other reviewers for being wrong when they hadn't even seen the final product.For the record: The person the other reviewers said got it wrong was actually RIGHT, this is a TERRIBLE DVD where most songs are featured as highlights, with sudden cuts to interviews with the Osmonds and Andy Williams. As much as I appreciated seeing how the Osmonds look and sound in the present day, I really was looking forward to seeing a full concert, not this patch up job. I mean, ""One Bad Apple"" was almost completely butchered. Very, very bad.The picture is decent in anamorphic wide screen, the audio is only DD 2.0. There seemed to be a problem with the mikes initially - their voices are mostly drowned out during the first two songs.This reunion event really deserved a much better DVD treatment than this. I'm now ordering the 2-Disc version, although I have a feeling it'll be the same first disc with the butchered versions of the songs and a second disc with stand alone concert highlights not featured in the first one.

1142064,ASM7DZRYULUXI,B0013FYT9O,"Jean T. Gilliland ""Jatg""","[22, 22]","For the sheer, simple pleasure of watching the seven performing members of the Osmond family reunite on stage for the first time in over 25 years, this dvd set is worth owning.  The real on-stage reunion is between Donny and the original quartet of Alan, Wayne, Merrill, and Jay, the five of whom have not performed together as The Osmond Brothers since the early '80s (although various combinations of the brothers, including youngest brother Jimmy, continued performing together throughout the '80s, '90s, and 2000's).  The seven siblings, including sister Marie, appear to be truly having a party, despite the ocassional misstep or flubbed lyric.  It is especially gratifying to see Alan back on stage, sometimes playing piano, sometimes singing out fron with his family (for health-related reasons, he retired from perfoming ten years ago).  Vocally, the siblings are in top form, their voices having gained texture and richness with maturity since their '70s heyday--individually, each voice is distinctive and pure, but as with most family groups, it is their multi-part harmonizing which really catches the ear.  Their signature concert closers, ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"" and the spine-tingling, gospel-tinged ""Are You Up There/I Believe"" (on Disc 2), in which they are joined on-stage by hearing-impaired oldest brothers, Virl and Tom (who perfom their parts by signing the lyrics), are particularly moving.Disc 1 features the special which aired on PBS, plus interviews inserted between songs that lend historical perspective and serve as introductions to songs that immediately follow.  The brothers' recollections of ""Osmondmania"", and the accompanying archival footage, might be startling to viewers who either don't remember or were simply unaware of the massive impact this family had on pop culture in the '70s.  Interviews with longtime friend and mentor Andy Williams are included, along with snippets from The Andy Williams Show, on which the Brothers appeared regularly throughout the '60s.  Many of the family's biggest hits are performed, at least in part, most memorably the full-bodied, warmly delivered ""Love Me for a Reason"", and the energetic, almost cultish favorite, ""Crazy Horses"".On Disc 2, bonus performances are added in piecemeal fashion, including several hits from the original quartet's and Marie's quite successful forays into country music during the '80s.  And lest we forget that heartthrob Donny is a well-established entertainer in his own right, Disc 2 includes attention-grabbing solo performances of ""Breeze on By"" and ""Will It Go Round in Circles"".It is true that these performances are edited and arranged out-of-sequence, so the feel of a full concert is missing (for that I highly recommend the Brothers 2006 Live in London concert dvd).  I would've liked fuller treatment of a few songs, as well as anything that would've highlighted the brothers' skills as musicians, but overall, this 2-disc set presents a fairly comprehensive overview of the family's 50-year career.  The warmth which exists between the Osmonds and their enthusiastic, loyal audience is palpable--that their fans know every lyric and dance move says a lot about the endurance of this family's music and popularity.The packaging is bare bones (the menu on the back cover does not even mention the interviews, and there is no insert). I don't have a fine enough ear to detect any major shortcomings in sound quality, and whatever there are didn't detract from my enjoyment of the program.",4,"Not perfect, but still very worthwhile...",1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,3515,"['sheer', 'simple', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'seven', 'performing', 'members', 'Osmond', 'family', 'reunite', 'stage', 'first', 'time', '25', 'years', 'dvd', 'set', 'worth', 'owning', 'real', 'on-stage', 'reunion', 'Donny', 'original', 'quartet', 'Alan', 'Wayne', 'Merrill', 'Jay', 'five', 'whom', 'have', 'not', 'performed', 'together', 'Osmond', 'Brothers', 'early', ""'80s"", 'various', 'combinations', 'brothers', 'including', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Jimmy', 'continued', 'performing', 'together', ""'80s"", ""'90s"", '2000', 'seven', 'siblings', 'including', 'sister', 'Marie', 'appear', 'be', 'truly', 'having', 'party', 'ocassional', 'misstep', 'flubbed', 'lyric', 'especially', 'gratifying', 'see', 'Alan', 'back', 'stage', 'sometimes', 'playing', 'piano', 'sometimes', 'singing', 'out', 'fron', 'family', 'health-related', 'reasons', 'retired', 'perfoming', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Vocally', 'siblings', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'voices', 'having', 'gained', 'texture', 'richness', 'maturity', ""'70s"", 'heyday', 'individually', 'voice', 'distinctive', 'pure', 'most', 'family', 'groups', 'multi-part', 'harmonizing', 'really', 'ear', 'signature', 'concert', 'closers', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Heavy', 'Brother', 'spine-tingling', 'gospel-tinged', 'Are', 'There/I', 'Believe', 'Disc', '2', 'are', 'joined', 'on-stage', 'hearing-impaired', 'oldest', 'brothers', 'Virl', 'Tom', 'who', 'perfom', 'parts', 'signing', 'lyrics', 'are', 'particularly', 'moving.Disc', '1', 'special', 'aired', 'PBS', 'interviews', 'inserted', 'songs', 'lend', 'historical', 'perspective', 'serve', 'introductions', 'songs', 'immediately', 'follow', 'brothers', 'recollections', 'Osmondmania', 'accompanying', 'archival', 'footage', 'might', 'be', 'startling', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'were', 'simply', 'unaware', 'massive', 'impact', 'family', 'had', 'pop', 'culture', ""'70s"", 'Interviews', 'longtime', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'are', 'included', 'snippets', 'Andy', 'Williams', 'Show', 'Brothers', 'appeared', 'regularly', ""'60s"", 'Many', 'family', 'biggest', 'hits', 'are', 'performed', 'least', 'part', 'most', 'memorably', 'full-bodied', 'warmly', 'delivered', 'Love', 'Me', 'Reason', 'energetic', 'almost', 'cultish', 'favorite', 'Crazy', 'Horses', '.On', 'Disc', '2', 'bonus', 'performances', 'are', 'added', 'piecemeal', 'fashion', 'including', 'several', 'hits', 'original', 'quartet', 'Marie', 'quite', 'successful', 'forays', 'country', 'music', ""'80s"", 'lest', 'forget', 'heartthrob', 'Donny', 'well-established', 'entertainer', 'own', 'right', 'Disc', '2', 'attention-grabbing', 'solo', 'performances', 'Breeze', 'Will', 'Go', 'Round', 'Circles', '.It', 'true', 'performances', 'are', 'edited', 'arranged', 'out-of-sequence', 'feel', 'full', 'concert', 'missing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Brothers', '2006', 'Live', 'London', 'concert', 'dvd', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'fuller', 'treatment', 'few', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'would', ""'ve"", 'highlighted', 'brothers', 'skills', 'musicians', 'overall', '2-disc', 'set', 'fairly', 'comprehensive', 'overview', 'family', '50-year', 'career', 'warmth', 'Osmonds', 'enthusiastic', 'loyal', 'audience', 'palpable', 'fans', 'know', 'lyric', 'dance', 'move', 'lot', 'endurance', 'family', 'music', 'popularity.The', 'packaging', 'bare', 'bones', 'menu', 'back', 'cover', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'interviews', 'insert', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fine', 'enough', 'ear', 'detect', 'major', 'shortcomings', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'program']",N/A

I've seen the Osmonds perform on stage, and I hate to give them anything less than 5 stars, but this isn't a 5 star disc.  It was at least 50% talk which wasn't what I wanted to hear.  Then when it cut back to the music, some of the songs were just part of a medley.  I have the CD, and if they had stuck to the music as they did on the CD, it would have been wonderful.  But I was disappointed that the DVD didn't include all the songs, namely the wonderful ""The Proud One.""And the DVD was not easy to view. It was filmed in a dark room, with a dark background, and they were all dressed in black.  It looked like they were doing some good footwork, but you can't see it, just their whole bodies moving. There were several flashes of light, but overall the whole thing was too dark.  Marie with her dark hair, in a dark dress with black hose was barely visible.
