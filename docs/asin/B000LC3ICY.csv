How could Amanda carry all her victims to their demise - How could she kidnap many of them in broad daylight - Who builds, maintains, and gets materials for all of the machines - how can Jigsaw install cameras in peoples' homes and also know everything about them? Amanda stated she built the shotgun bullet trap - yeah, sure.  Everything seems to work out perfectly and timed.  The husband must have a very low IQ as he is so slow to save any of the victims, by the time he does anything, they are dead, often standing there like an idiot for some time.  His wife is dying on the floor and he takes his sweet time to do anything.  Why couldn't she warn him that killing Jigsaw would result in her death? Many things happen in this movie that are scripted badly just so the story can come together in a neat little package.  P.S.

1037764,A1KSO56UWS2R7I,B000LC3ICY,"Adam L. Safianow ""Kiddo""","[2, 5]","PREMISE:Jigsaw, althought brilliant in his own right, has a tendancy of causing mayhem. He kidnaps people and puts them in a contraption that either makes them die, or forces them to lose something in order to gain freedom from his clutches. With the help of his new assistant, Amanda, he is able to continue to do his bidding on the lives of seemingly innocent (although we know better) people.SYNOPSIS:In the third, and probably final installment, Jigsaw has kidnapped a doctor, who is going through relationship problems and is disconnected with her children and friends. She is now part of Jigsaw's game. With a bomb wrapped around her neck, she must keep Jigsaw alive long enough for Jigsaw's latest player, Jeff, to escape the trenches of his dark past. Jeff must go through a series of rooms so that he can overcome the loss of his son be defying the people that not only caused his son's death, but did nothing to let the murderer rot in a jail cell. Somehow all of these people are related, and in this movie, you find out exactly how.MENALITY GOING IN:I did expect a lot. After seeing Saw, I was amazed at the clever writing, brilliant trap design, great acting, and overall erieness of the film. It was grotesque, dark, and fantastic. With an incredibly small budget, the film still managed to make a large bank, enough money in fact to pay for the next two movies. In Saw 2, the writers went in a different direction. They made it seem more like a Ratrace to get to the exit point and overcome the challenges along the way. Like the first movie, every player in the game was somehow connected, and they all had to choose their fate. The second one really made you understand Jigsaw's motives, and what he was trying to accomplish. The message was that you must not take life for granted, and must give up the things we love the most to deserve the right to live. A man of few, but powerful words. With all this prior experience with the film, I was very confident that the third film will live up to the hype, and live up to the Saw petigree.REVIEW:This film, at least at the beginning, seemed to try to go back to its roots. It was focusing on single person trying to escape, as opposed to a large group. Continue directly after the last movie, Daniel's father was trapped with a chain on his foot and left for dead. Directly following this trap, you are led to two more victims, in difference scenarios. What makes this dumb is, how they really don't connect to the main story. As things unfold, you are led on an emotional roller coaster, while we see Amanda and Jigsaw's disfunctional relationship fall apart. On his deathbed, Jigsaw is testing Jeff, who recently lost his son, and must face the witness who fled from the scene and could have put the murderer behind bars for life, the judge who let the murderer go, and finally the murderer himself. The traps weren't for him, and if he wanted, he could have let all three of them go. Jigsaw's task was to test his forgiveness, and see if he could finally let the past go and move on with his life. Jeff was obsessed with wanting to find and kill the murderer, and it was starting to distract and tear apart his family. Lynn, the doctor, has a neck brace with explosives set around the edges. If Jigsaw's heartrate flatlines, they explode, and she dies. She is forced to operate on his against his will to postpone his emminent death from his hemorrhaging brain long enough so that Jeff could erase his past. Amanda, who was saved by Jigsaw has been part of Jigsaw's game before. She had to cut a man open in the first one, and was thrown into a pit of syringes in the second one. Without giving too much away, I can say this, each movie had a really surprise ending that made you reevaluate the entire movie and totally threw you for a loop. This one, not so much. Although many of the traps were well executed and brilliant, they lacked the clever enginuity of the first two movies, and although the shock value was higher in this film, the twist at the end just wasn't as unpredictable is in the first two. One thing I did like though, was how the movie focused more one the victims than the on the cops, which is good to see. This makes you really understand the character more, like you have a deep seated relationship with them. Makes their story more effective if they were to die.BOTTOM LINE:I'd say that this is the weakest of the three films, but I wasn't entirely disappointed. The movie was still great, and had a few nice touches that made this a welcome edition to the Saw family.RATING: B (4/5 stars)",4,"A Critical Review at the Third, and potentially Final Installment",1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,4582,"['PREMISE', 'Jigsaw', 'althought', 'brilliant', 'own', 'right', 'tendancy', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'people', 'contraption', 'die', 'forces', 'lose', 'something', 'order', 'gain', 'freedom', 'clutches', 'help', 'new', 'assistant', 'Amanda', 'able', 'continue', 'do', 'bidding', 'lives', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'know', 'better', 'people.SYNOPSIS', 'third', 'probably', 'final', 'installment', 'Jigsaw', 'kidnapped', 'doctor', 'who', 'going', 'relationship', 'problems', 'disconnected', 'children', 'friends', 'now', 'part', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'bomb', 'wrapped', 'neck', 'must', 'keep', 'Jigsaw', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'Jigsaw', 'latest', 'player', 'Jeff', 'escape', 'trenches', 'dark', 'past', 'Jeff', 'must', 'go', 'series', 'rooms', 'so', 'can', 'overcome', 'loss', 'son', 'be', 'defying', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'caused', 'son', 'death', 'did', 'nothing', 'let', 'murderer', 'rot', 'jail', 'cell', 'Somehow', 'people', 'are', 'related', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'GOING', 'IN', 'did', 'expect', 'lot', 'seeing', 'Saw', 'was', 'amazed', 'clever', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'trap', 'design', 'great', 'acting', 'overall', 'erieness', 'film', 'was', 'grotesque', 'dark', 'fantastic', 'incredibly', 'small', 'budget', 'film', 'still', 'managed', 'make', 'large', 'bank', 'enough', 'money', 'fact', 'pay', 'next', 'two', 'movies', 'Saw', '2', 'writers', 'went', 'different', 'direction', 'made', 'seem', 'more', 'Ratrace', 'get', 'exit', 'point', 'overcome', 'challenges', 'way', 'first', 'movie', 'player', 'game', 'was', 'somehow', 'connected', 'had', 'choose', 'fate', 'second', 'one', 'really', 'made', 'understand', 'Jigsaw', 'motives', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'message', 'was', 'must', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'granted', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'things', 'love', 'most', 'deserve', 'right', 'live', 'man', 'few', 'powerful', 'words', 'prior', 'experience', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'confident', 'third', 'film', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'live', 'up', 'Saw', 'petigree.REVIEW', 'film', 'least', 'beginning', 'seemed', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'was', 'focusing', 'single', 'person', 'trying', 'escape', 'opposed', 'large', 'group', 'Continue', 'directly', 'last', 'movie', 'Daniel', 'father', 'was', 'trapped', 'chain', 'foot', 'left', 'dead', 'Directly', 'following', 'trap', 'are', 'led', 'two', 'more', 'victims', 'difference', 'scenarios', 'What', 'dumb', 'how', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'main', 'story', 'things', 'unfold', 'are', 'led', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'see', 'Amanda', 'Jigsaw', 'disfunctional', 'relationship', 'fall', 'apart', 'deathbed', 'Jigsaw', 'testing', 'Jeff', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'son', 'must', 'face', 'witness', 'who', 'fled', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'murderer', 'bars', 'life', 'judge', 'who', 'let', 'murderer', 'go', 'finally', 'murderer', 'traps', 'were', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'three', 'go', 'Jigsaw', 'task', 'was', 'test', 'forgiveness', 'see', 'could', 'finally', 'let', 'past', 'go', 'move', 'life', 'Jeff', 'was', 'obsessed', 'wanting', 'find', 'kill', 'murderer', 'was', 'starting', 'distract', 'tear', 'apart', 'family', 'Lynn', 'doctor', 'neck', 'brace', 'explosives', 'set', 'edges', 'Jigsaw', 'heartrate', 'flatlines', 'explode', 'forced', 'operate', 'will', 'postpone', 'emminent', 'death', 'hemorrhaging', 'brain', 'long', 'enough', 'Jeff', 'could', 'erase', 'past', 'Amanda', 'who', 'was', 'saved', 'Jigsaw', 'been', 'part', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'had', 'cut', 'man', 'open', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'thrown', 'pit', 'syringes', 'second', 'one', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'had', 'really', 'surprise', 'ending', 'made', 'reevaluate', 'entire', 'movie', 'totally', 'threw', 'loop', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'many', 'traps', 'were', 'well', 'executed', 'brilliant', 'lacked', 'clever', 'enginuity', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'shock', 'value', 'was', 'higher', 'film', 'twist', 'end', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'unpredictable', 'first', 'two', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'how', 'movie', 'focused', 'more', 'one', 'victims', 'cops', 'good', 'see', 'really', 'understand', 'character', 'more', 'have', 'deep', 'seated', 'relationship', 'Makes', 'story', 'more', 'effective', 'were', 'die.BOTTOM', 'LINE', ""'d"", 'say', 'weakest', 'three', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'had', 'few', 'nice', 'touches', 'made', 'welcome', 'edition', 'Saw', 'family.RATING', 'B', '4/5', 'stars']",N/A

1037767,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000LC3ICY,A. Estes,"[1, 3]","Ever since my first viewing of ""Saw,"" I, like most people, was intrigued and had my faith in modern horror reaffirmed. ""Saw"" emerged in a sea of tamed down, boring and pointless PG-13 movies and has become a modern classic, easily the most noteworthy horror movie to come out since the turn of the century. So, it wasn't surprising that ""Saw II"" was greenlit. Could they keep up the same level of integrity? Or would this franchise sink fast like so many others had before? Luckily, it was a smash. ""Saw II,"" while a different film from the first, was just as engrossing and disturbing as it's predecessor. And naturally, a year later, comes ""Saw III."" Before I get into my review, let me just say you can expect a ""Saw IV"" to hit theaters this time next year.I have to come right out and say that I left the theater rather disappointed with ""Saw III."" Now, it's not that movie was bad, or that it was a typical, problem-ridden sequel like most of it's kind. The first problem? The movie is way, way too short. Everytime a good idea comes along, it seems like it is rushed out of the way to meet the 90-minute mark. Crucial character development and screentime is so compacted and condensed that it nearly destroys the film completely. What could have been a beautiful and epic story about revenge and redemption really just boils down to gratuitous violence by the end.Maybe I had expectations that went way too high. I mean, the first two set a standard, but perhaps it was my mistake to assume that director Darren Lynn Bousman and co-creators James Wan and Leigh Wannell are invincible. As shown by this troubled film, they are not. Now, these are hugely talented guys, make no mistake. To establish such a reputation this early in their careers is extraordinary and should be respected. However, one can't help but wonder if their film suffered due to studio pressure. Like I said, the first two set a standard. Perhaps they weren't sure which audience they were supposed to be focusing on: The one that likes to just be shocked, or the one that likes to be shocked and have their minds tickled.What is good about ""Saw III,"" however, is that it really has/had massive potential to do more. Do I hear ""Director's Cut?"" God, I hope so. The traps this time are of a different breed (check out the ""Pig Grinder"") but also embed themselves into your consciousness perhaps more effectively than before. The overall story is solid and at times, truly touching. I can't say that all the plot-twists weren't predictable, and I can't say all the performances were on-key, but there is definitely a good movie here. It's just smothered. ""Saw III"" is simply hurt by being too brief.

I give it 2 because the average is far too high as it stands.I would have been willing to wait an extra year if the filmmakers could have come up with something better than this monument to human depravity. This film is disturbing -- alright, that's fine, shocking -- lovely, it's what we expect, but also something more. This film is depressing.From the very beginning, I have been a Saw fan. Ever since I saw the trailer for the first movie, I loved the concept, and went to see the film during its opening weekend. It was clever, the twist ending was fantastic, and a new horror icon was born. It was a psychological thriller as much as it was a horror movie. The traps were gruesome, yes, but they had a point. What made ""Saw"" a great movie was that the shocks had a point beyond shocking you.""Saw II"" was a great surprise. The story was interesting, the characters were believeable, and the traps were stepped up a notch but still had a point. The infamous 'needle pit' will stand out in horror movie history.The first two movies were intelligent, well-thought-out horror movies.No longer.""Saw III"" is depraved. The traps serve no purpose but to shock you. That is what I got out of the movie, which is fine on its own. ""Saw III"" on its own would stand head and shoulders above most horror movies. But I expected more from this film. ""Saw"" has degenerated into ""Hostel"" without any reason. I enjoyed ""Hostel"" because I got exactly what I was expecting -- basically, a snuff film. I expected something somewhat intelligent from ""Saw III"" because the other two were so innovative. ""Saw III,"" however, is not clever, is not intelligent, is forced, and commits suicide at the end. The twist ending that was *intended* is -- dare I say it? -- cliched.But the twist ending to this film is not what the filmmakers think it is. The real twist ending is that they've destroyed their series. The film is depressing. The movie's shocks don't retain a certain level of fun such as in the other two movies It keeps you on the edge of your seat, but for the wrong reasons.What happened?

1037770,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000LC3ICY,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[0, 0]","Since the first ""Saw"" came out, a highly low-budget film mostly panned by critics which has become surprisingly successful, the sequels have taken the idea and managed to make it if not any deeper or more complex plot-wise, they were certainly more enjoyable.  It's especially entertaining to see in Saw II as Donnie Wahlberg's character is driven nuts just talking to Jigsaw, who promises his son's ""safe"" delivery if he just stays and talks (note: safe not put in quotes because its untrue, it's just a spoiler)****SPOILERS ALERT****Saw III starts out with a much denied rumor proven true of Donnie Wahlberg returning as the cop from Saw II.  He is placed in the same bathroom as Adam and Lawrence were in the first, but rather than saw his foot off, he does somethng more gruesome (bashing his foot so it can slide through the cuff) and then goes after Amanda who is still in the catacombs.  He nearly succeeds in killing her, but she eventually prevails.Then we move on with the usual someone caught in Jigsaw's trap, and showing more people caught in his traps.  But there's something different about these ones... no one is surviving the traps, and while some of them are particularly impossible (try removing a metal ring that is connected to your jaw, beneath your tongue and behind your chin), even if the person somehow managed to survive it, their traps do not let them go.Before the main victims are introduced, the sole recurring character (save for Jigsaw and Amanda) from the franchise (played by Dina Meyer) discovers that Jigsaw's traps have become inescapable, and the slaughter is becoming more brutal without any particular justification.  As she makes this revelation, she is now caught in one of Jigsaw's traps, and would have escaped, but her contraption failed to open with the key she retrieved in a cup of acid, and she dies.Now we are introduced to the characters.  I have mixed feelings about them as I love Angus Macfeyden as an actor, and he certainly brings his character as much to life as he can, while the woman playing his wife (Lynn) seems quite bored in the beginning where she's shown going to work after having an affair.  Macfayden's character (Jeff) is perpetually tormented by the death of his son in a car accident, and the person involved has been let off and so his life falls apart as he devotes himself to tracking the people down and--probably--killing him.Quickly, the two are captured by Jigsaw's new assistant, Amanda, and placed in their respective traps.  Lynn, being the doctor, is fixed with a neck-contraption with shotgun shells which will ignite and kill her if a now-bedridden Jigsaw dies, and she is responsible for keeping him alive.Jeff, meanwhile, is placed in a gauntlet of a different kind of torture.  Rather than suffer physically, he is made to suffer mentally as Jigsaw's gauntlet leads him to rooms where other people are placed in brutal traps.  Each person has a tape with them, which is addressed to Jeff, and told how each person was partly responsible for either his son's death or the mistrial resulting in his killer's escape from justice.  Jigsaw's test is to see if he can forgive them for their actions or inactions and help them to escape the traps.The first is a woman who was jogging that morning that Jeff's son was hit, and refused to testify in court.  She is stripped naked and chained by her hands in the middle of a freezer, while a machine sprays her with misty water every few minutes, intending to freeze her.  Jeff is reluctant to free her at first, but soon overcomes this and attempts to retrieve the key to let her go (resulting in a nasty flesh wound on his cheek) but by the time he gets it, she is completely frozen over, and the lock as well.The next room he goes into he must free the judge who dismissed the case due to lack of evidence.  He is strapped by the neck at the bottom of a pit while a machine takes pig carcasses and drops them in a grinder, shooting the liquified pigs into the pit to slowly drown him.  Jeff must get the key to shut the machine off by burning his son's stuffed animals which Jeff kept to himself obsessively after his son's death.  He gets it in time to save the man, and they move on.Meanwhile, while Lynn is caring for Jigsaw, we get some insight not only into Jigsaw and his past, but also insight into Amanda, and how her apparent Stockholm Syndrome with Jigsaw evolved into a full-on obsession, so much so that she begins to grow insanely jealous with Lynn, whom Jigsaw is treating benevolently, while scolding Amanda for lashing out emotionally.  She relieves the pain by cutting her thighs.There are also some very nice and insightful flashbacks, showing that Amanda's assistance of Jigsaw has extended as far back as Dr Gordon and Adam in the first movie.  We see her preparing Jigsaw for his stint in the room, taking a drug to slow his breathing and heartbeat (so he can appear a corpse) while also placing Adam in the cold bath and setting up everything.  We even see her coming in after Jigsaw has left Adam in the bathroom, and see her reviving a still-alive Adam and then murdering him (by wrapping a plastic bag around his head), and the rush she gets from killing him.We also get to see flashbacks showing Amanda developing an almost daughterly obsession with Jigsaw, and her growing taste for murder.  We find out she is the one responsible for making Jigsaw's traps unwinnable, and Jigsaw is not oblivious to this.Back with Jeff and the judge, they come into the final room, where the man who killed Jeff's son is placed in a crucifix-style trap.  It slowly begins to twist his limbs one by one in 360 circles, and the key to unlock the man from the device is hanging inside a glass tube connected to the trigger of a shotgun.  Jeff is obviously hesitant, but with the pressure of the judge, he decides to help him, but is having trouble trying to get the key without setting off the shotgun.  We are led to believe that the shotgun is empty and that this is merely a test of Jeff's willingness to shed some of his own blood to save another.  Still, he yanks the key and jerks away, just as the shotgun fires off and accidentally hits the judge who is standing off behind him.  Jeff attempts to use the key to free the man in the trap, but the key does not fit (Amanda's doing) and he is killed with the crucifix twists his head completely around, and Jeff is left alone now.Jeff finds his way to Jigsaw's workshop somehow, and Amanda grows further infuriated with Lynn.  She then pulls out her gun and shoots Lynn, only to then be shot by Jeff who has found a gun nearby.  Jigsaw then reveals to Amanda that he has been testing her as well, and that she has failed.  Now that they are confronted, Jigsaw challenges Jeff with his last test---to forgive Jigsaw, for putting him and his wife in this situation.  Jeff says he forgives him---then retrieves a buzz saw and slits Jigsaw's throat.  As he starts to bleed to death, he unveils a tape recorder in his hand, and plays a pre-recorded message for Jeff in the event of Jigsaw's death.  He tells Jeff of what will happen, that he has failed, and that now he can never save his child---as Jeff had been told in Jigsaw's first tape that he would save his child, thinking it to be his son by getting justice for his death, when he never realized that Jigsaw had also kidnapped his daughter and placed her in a secret place.As Jigsaw flatlines, Lynn's neck contraption goes off and kills her, and Jeff is left to wail loudly in pain as his wife is dead, his daughter missing, and the exits to the hideout are closed shut by automatic metal doors, effectively trapping him inside.All in all, there was a lot more attempts at a philosophy in Jigsaw's torturous tests, and a lot of deeper insight into the minds of Amanda and Jigsaw, as well as a strong theme of forgiveness.  Along with this, it is also much much gorier than the previous two, but nothing that is both gross and traumatic (like live amputations and such).  One of my favorite gory scenes was the emergency brain surgery performed by Lynn on Jigsaw using power tools and stolen medical equipment :PWhile not something deep and thrilling, it was an enjoyable ride, and I strongly oppose the studios' decision to call for a Saw IV.  It is over.  Jigsaw is dead, Amanda is dead, Kerry is dead, Detective Matthews is dead, Doctor Gordon is dead, Adam is dead, Lynn is dead, Jeff is dead, there's no one to go on other than lame copycats which we would rather not see.",5,Not the same,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,8526,"['first', 'Saw', 'came', 'out', 'highly', 'low-budget', 'film', 'mostly', 'panned', 'critics', 'become', 'surprisingly',

Here is what I have to say,  Saw 3 brings us more of what we want.  More gruesome scenarios, more sick and twisted gore images, more characters reaching the peak of their insanity.  While those scenes will please hardcore fans of the series this movie does fall short from the first 2.  My only real issue of this movie was that was just too long.  The first 2 films were roughly 1 and 1/2 hrs.  This one is over 2 hours.  What was good about the length of the first 2 was that they were able to keep an intense atmosphere since they were not as long.  I suppose since this film was alot longer, it was hard to keep up the instense atmosphere and instead, the makers had much of movie be based on Amanda's (Shawnee Smith) character developement.  They are many memory sequences from the first and second, even footage that we have not seen.  Although it was intersting to see those, it was just too much.  It slowed down the intsensity of the film.  There are points where you just wanna get away from the memory sequence and flash foroward to the present timeline so you can on with the movie.  Other than being slow, I think this movie has more than it needs to please its audience.  Here is the plot.Doctor Lynn Benlon (Bohar Soomekh) spends her days working at the hospital and then later coming home to what is soon to be a failed marraiage.  She is now one of the new subjects in Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) final game.  With the help of Amanda, Lynn is captured.  Apparently Jigsaw's cancer is just about to finish.  He is reaching the end of his life, but he wants to be alive to see what the outcome will be of his final game.  Jigsaw was once treated by Doctor Lynn, now he wants her to to keep him alive long enough to see the end of his game.  The Rules for her is that if Jigsaw dies, she dies.Jigsaw latest game involves Jeff (Angus Macfayden) a man who lost his son to a drunk driver.  But what was worse is that the man was set free after 6 months.  He has been hell bent on revenge for yrs now and now he'll have the chance to do so.  His game involves a certain twist.  Instead of his life on the line, He will control the fate of other ppl's lives.  Other ppl who were involved with his son's case whom could have made a difference in the case's outcome.  Now their lives will be in his hands because they are put into fatal (and sickly brilliant) contraptions.  He is being tested to show if he will be willing to forgive them or stoup to a level lower than them.  Can Doctor Lynn be able to keep Jigsaw alive till Jeff completes his test??All in all in definetly a fun way to spend the night.  More gore, more blood, more F@%#d up $h!+.

1037780,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000LC3ICY,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 6]","`Saw III' directed by Darren Lynn Bousman is cut from the same cookie cutter script as the previous two movies, without the novelty of the first, but with just a scant improvement in plot over the second. The `Saw' series is the exemplar for an entire new genre of horror movie which can to some extent trace its roots back to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. While these have been criticized as being nothing more than exercizes in blood and Sadism, I really find them big improvements over the very tired plotlines arrising out of the Halloween model which has been done to death a at least 13 times over and more. The basic premise replaces the nave teenager oblivious to the danger lurking behind him, with a fully aware victim in imminant peril that they fully appreciate, and which is drawn out with building expectation rather than diving in with a quick kill. Thus, in spite of all the gore and paraphenalia, there is much more psychological terror and vicarious fear being dished out here than by most appearences by Freddy or Jason or whomever.The other side of the coin is the realization of how bare these movies are of new ideas. The whole premise of the first movie was culled from a three minute scene from `The Road Warrior'. And that was the best of the three movies. One of the opening `trap' scenes in this movie was taken from a similarly short scene in the first `Hellraiser' movie. The voice-over commentary from the director and producers make great exclamation on how well things are executed in this movie, totally ignoring the fact that the story line is radically disconnected and the behavior of the characters is improbable at best.There is much to the criticism of this sub-genre of horror movie, and the criticism would lead to believing that the films had no value whatsoever, except that nobody else is doing the `Perils of Pauline' sthick at all, let alone well. That said, I will say that the `traps', that is, `the good parts' in this movie, are just a bit better than `the good parts' in `Saw I' and `Saw II'.",4,Best trap scenes yet.

SAWlll is a whole lot more disgusting and twist filled than SAWll. SAWll went down the road of people trying to escape from a house of traps which was great and all led up to one major twist, but it didn't have the clever edge to it that both SAW and SAWlll have. The question in SAWlll is not just how to survive and win the game, but is also whether the game is actually the game you think it is, and are the players actually who you think they are. I don't want to give anything away but lets just say SAWlll has mega-twists.The games/traps in SAWlll are nasty, all of them. Except one which is a bit silly (the one where the woman is cold one second and then frozen solid seconds later) One is just down right hideous (involving rotten pig carcasses). Another one is just plain wrong (limb twist).We also get to see snippets of the games being set up by JIGSAW and the planning stage which was never seen much in the other films. Watching this one its easy to think they could just go on forever making SAW films, and I guess they did!The extras are pretty good on this DVD. There is the usual bit about each game/device - how it was made etc. a behind the scenes filming bit which is cool. And a load of commentary which I never watch. On the whole SAWlll is excellent and shouldn't be passed up just because its no.3. This is no JAWS3.SAWlll should be enjoyed by those that are into pigs, brains, revenge, JIGSAW in bed & mega-twists.

1037782,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000LC3ICY,Brett Corkins,"[1, 2]","I, probably like most people, think the Saw franchise has gotten less and less a horror/psychological movie and more into just gore. Part of the beauty of the first Saw was that there wasn't a ton of gore, it left more to the imagination, thus concentrating on the central characters. Saw II was where the gore became seemingly more important than the actual story. I won't deny, hearing that II would welcome blood and guts with arms open excited me. And while it was good, there were far more things that agrivated me than pleased me. First, I didn't care about ANY character. Second, Donnie Wahlberg.Saw III is where I'll most likely leave the franchise. They barely focus on the characters or their back stories for why Jigsaw wanted them. Instead they seem to concentrate on making the contraptions more intricate, bloodier deaths, and more cussing. So yeah, they definitely succeed on those fronts. The cussing is over-zealous. F-bombs are dropped like nobody's business and for no reason at all. The deaths are surely cringe-worthy, I found myself looking away at certain points (I know I know). And the contraptions are eerily complex. 'The Rack', yeah, that's the most sadistic thing I've ever seen.The one plus, character-wise, has been the biggest plus from the very beginning, Jigsaw himself. His reasoning behind things, especially this time around, are things you'd never think of, even while he's dropping some huge hints through the entire movie. Once he provides answer though, everything clicks, everything that didn't make sense in the beginning makes perfect sense afterward.In conclusion, if you don't mind the sacrifice of character developement for some insane deaths, Saw III is right up your alley. For those of us who want to actually care about who dies and who doesn't, Saw III is a big letdown. Give and take, and as always, it's your preference against mine.

""Saw III"" more than lives up to the reputation of it's thrilling predecessors...and yes, there is of course a big twist at the end!The movie picks up almost exactly where ""Saw II"" left off, and takes the story down a new path. At the end of the second movie we (the audience) discovered that Amanda, the girl from the first movie who managed to escape the giant bear-trap attached to her jaw, was being groomed by Jigsaw to carry on his legacy of teaching carefully selected people the importance of life by placing them in horrifying torture devices and forcing them to extremes in order to escape, or die. In ""Saw III"" Jigsaw is dying from a brain tumor, and engages in one final game with Amanda...While I'm not usually a fan of films with mindless gore, I actually don't mind the ""Saw"" movies because they offer a nice heaping helping of thrills and twists to go along with it's usual blood bath. While I found myself shutting my eyes during most of the overly disgusting torture scenes (note to self...shutting your eyes does not shut out the sound effects...learn to shut ears as well) I was still able to enjoy this movie without having nightmares afterwards.What would you do if you knew that in a matter of minutes you were going to die in a terrifyingly painful and grotesque way? Would you be willing to cut off your own foot with a saw? Would you be willing to stick your arm in a vat of acid that will immediately eat the flesh away from your bone? Would you be willing to cut the only key that can set you free out of the body of a live human being? These are the dilemmas Jigsaw's victims face. They face the very human fear of death, and are forced to contemplate their mortality in the two minutes they have left to live. Jigsaw attempts to instill in these people a greater appreciation for life, and he gives each of them the opportunity to save themselves...or perish. Our instinct to survive is one of the most primal components in human nature, and the ""Saw"" films ask the question, ""What would you be willing to do to survive""?While the lengths he goes to are psychopathic at best...is Jigsaw wrong in his ideology that people in the depths of despair in humanity need a helping hand to see the light? Generally this help comes from healthier practices, such as counseling, group therapy, or even simply having good support from a loved one. Torture probably isn't the best way to enlighten such individuals.This 3rd installment is definitely the grossest out of all of them, so be warned that it might make even the toughest person squirm. Admittedly, I sort of guessed the twist at the end before it happened, but it turns out I was only partially right. Even if you think you know what the twist is...I promise you'll find out there's more to it than you think.Bottom line, a great gross-out movie!

For the first time in the series they deliver what the promised. They live up to thier potential. There are some flaws though.First let me give you a brief summary of the plot. ""Saw III"" picks up exactly where ""Saw II"" left off. Dectective Matthews is held in the custody of Jigsaw's new apprentice Amanda (remember her). He is in the same room that was used with the two main characters in ""Saw I"". Quickly that somewhat wrap his storyline up, and then be prepared to forget about him for quite some time. We then meet the main characters or victims of this film. The first is a Doctor who is taken captive by Amanda, to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to witness his newest test subject. Jigsaw is not in good shape and it looks like he could die at any second. If Jigsaw dies, the doctor will lose her head, as a device is strapped to around her neck that will go off if she moves to far away, or if Jigsaw flatlines. We then meet the new test subject. His name is Jeff, and his son was killed in by I think a drunk driver, or at least a bad one. He is set on the path of forgivness. For the longest time he has neglected his daughter and his whole life to a life of obsession, obsession over killing the people he has blamed for the death of his son. Now he has the chance. In each room there is one person who he has blamed for the death of his son, and he has the chance to save them from the contraptions that they are in, or let them die. And lying at the end of the game is the man who killed his son.Their is also the development of Jigsaw's new apprentice Amanda. (Remember Becker? She was the dumb secretary). Unfortunatly for the people she tests, she does not follow the same rules that Jigsaw does. Outside the main story thier are a few other people that are affected by her. But she speacializes in false hope. She gives them truly impossible situations to get out of, and even if they do exactly as she has asked them to do they are doomed. While it is more cruel than Jigsaw, it makes the concept a little bit less interesting. But don't worry, it is all made up for in the conclusion.The acting in this movie is good. They tell us what is expected of the characters, and the consequences that would happen if they don't follow. And the characters for the first time in this series remember that. This is not like the second one where it was all about the killings. This time the killings actually help to further the plot, not just to please the audience. The writing is more natural than it has been in the last 2, and it has a very pleasing ending, making me wonder how exactly they did the next one. But I know they did because ""Saw IV"" is already out in theaters.They also throw in some information to further explain events in ""Saw I"" and ""Saw II"". This was interesting and fun, and made ""Saw II"" a little bit more worth my watching it. But another movie should not be needed to make another one worth watching.Because they made the cast smaller than the second one, and they increased the length of this movie, there was more time for character development in this movie. Although sometimes it can seem a bit forced, it works.A few problems. Although they offer a little bit of an explanation to what happend to Detective Matthews, they don't show 100% what happend to him. Some things don't further the plot, they are just there to put in a fun or interesting scene. I had another but I forgot it so it must have not been that horrible.All in all this movie is pretty fun, and has gotten me excited again for this series. I will probably go see ""Saw IV"" tomorrow or the day after and I look forward to giving you my review.I give ""Saw III"" a 7 out of 10",4,My Favorite In The Series,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,3782,"['Wow', 'two', 'reviews', 'one', 'day', 'What', 'treat', 'loyal', 'readers', 'Saw', 'III', 'actually', 'good', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'series', 'deliver', 'what', 'promised', 'live', 'up', 'thier', 'potential', 'are', 'flaws', 'though.First', 'let', 'give', 'brief', 'summary', 'plot', 'Saw', 'III', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'Saw', 'II', 'left', 'off', 'Dectective', 'Matthews', 'held', 'custody', 'Jigsaw', 'new', 'apprentice', 'Amanda', 'remember', 'same', 'room', 'was', 'used', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Saw', 'Quickly', 'somewhat', 'wrap', 'storyline', 'up', 'then', 'be', 'prepared', 'forget', 'quite', 'time', 'then', 'meet', 'main', 'characters', 'victims', 'film', 'first', 'Doctor', 'who', 'taken', 'captive', 'Amanda', 'keep', 'Jigsaw', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'witness', 'newest', 'test', 'subject', 'Jigsaw', 'not', 'good', 'shape', 'could', 'die', 'second', 'Jigsaw', 'doctor', 'will', 'lose', 'head', 'device', 'strapped', 'neck', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'far', 'away', 'Jigsaw', 'flatlines', 'then', 'meet', 'new', 'test', 'subject', 'name', 'Jeff', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'think', 'drunk', 'driver', 'least', 'bad', 'one', 'set', 'path', 'forgivness', 'longest', 'time', 'neglected', 'daughter', 'whole', 'life', 'life', 'obsession', 'obsession', 'killing', 'people', 'blamed', 'death', 'son', 'Now', 'chance', 'room', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'blamed', 'death', 'son', 'chance', 'save', 'contraptions', 'are', 'let', 'die', 'lying', 'end', 'game', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'son.Their', 'also', 'development', 'Jigsaw', 'new', 'apprentice', 'Amanda', 'Remember', 'Becker', 'was', 'dumb', 'secretary', 'Unfortunatly', 'people', 'not', 'follow', 'same', 'rules', 'Jigsaw', 'Outside', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'affected', 'false', 'hope', 'truly', 'impossible', 'situations', 'get', 'even', 'do', 'exactly', 'asked', 'do', 'are', 'doomed', 'more', 'cruel', 'Jigsaw', 'concept', 'little', 'bit', 'less', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'made', 'up', 'conclusion.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'good', 'tell', 'what', 'expected', 'characters', 'consequences', 'would', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'characters', 'first', 'time', 'series', 'remember', 'not', 'second', 'one', 'where', 'was', 'killings', 'time', 'killings', 'actually', 'help', 'further', 'plot', 'not', 'just', 'please', 'audience', 'writing', 'more', 'natural', 'been', 'last', '2', 'very', 'pleasing', 'ending', 'making', 'wonder', 'how', 'exactly', 'did', 'next', 'one', 'know', 'did', 'Saw', 'IV', 'already', 'out', 'theaters.They', 'also', 'throw', 'information', 'further', 'explain', 'events', 'Saw', 'Saw', 'II', 'was', 'interesting', 'fun', 'made', 'Saw', 'II', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'needed', 'make', 'one', 'worth', 'watching.Because', 'made', 'cast', 'smaller', 'second', 'one', 'increased', 'length', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'forced', 'works.A', 'few', 'problems', 'offer', 'little', 'bit', 'explanation', 'what', 'happend', 'Detective', 'Matthews', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', '100', '%', 'what', 'happend', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'further', 'plot', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'put', 'fun', 'interesting', 'scene', 'had', 'forgot', 'must', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'horrible.All', 'movie', 'pretty', 'fun', 'gotten', 'excited', 'again', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'see', 'Saw', 'IV', 'tomorrow', 'day', 'look', 'forward', 'giving', 'review.I', 'give', 'Saw', 'III', '7', '10']",N/A

He also has her kidnap a man whose child had been accidentally run over by a driver and the driver was let off with a short sentence, which the father believes was not long enough for the crime.  The father has been living in a state of revenge and Jigsaw gives him the opportunity to fulfill his fantasies.

1037791,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B000LC3ICY,Christopher Engel,"[0, 0]","Saw 2 was *just* good enough to make me want to get the third one. Since it was, like, four bucks here for the Blu-ray, I thought, Why not?Short version: It's the goriest ""Saw"" yet, but still not as gory as some other flicks, notably the remake of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (hey, wanna watch forty-five minutes of sadistic rape? Or do you prefer the girl's rather creative and tortuous revenge sequences that would make Jigsaw flinch?), nor is it on the level of some of the classics, like ""High Tension"", ""Suspiria"", or ""REC"", probably because Saw doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously, but the other flicks do. ""Hostel"" also does the same thing, which makes it more potentially disturbing. The entire ""Saw"" series is a bit cheesy, really, and takes a few too many creative liberties when it comes to plot and realism. At least the other films mentioned tried to look realistic, but the Saw series is almost comical in comparison, with far too much emphasis on all that crap about Amanda, and other things virtually none of us cares about. Just get to the damned traps already; we don't give a damn about Amanda or the prequel part or any of that garbage. Since when was ""Saw"" known for its masterful storytelling? Right, never. It's the puzzles that hook us, so stick to the damned puzzles. ""Saw III"" tries way too hard to make itself into a cohesive story, as if anyone cares at all, but it pretty much makes up for it with the traps involved, the entire freaking reason we go to see the films. (Unfortunately, as we all know now, the Saw series got progressively worse as it tried to make itself more than a gorefest with some stupid story thrown in we always skip over in our players).I was a little worried going in that this was going to be a cash-in sequel that doesn't even try to hide that it's a cash-in sequel--you know, just gore, gore, gore, with no creativity in there, which is why I think anyone watches Saw to begin with. You want to see people die or come close to death through the ""puzzles"" they have to suffer through. Yeah, it's sick entertainment, but it's a good premise, and Saw III actually goes the extra mile here and does multiple ""traps"" at the same time. No one cares about Amanda or anything except the ""traps"", so what we get here is pretty good, and it even has arguably a better twist ending than the second one. It's quite a whopper that you very likely won't see coming. I had a guess, because I knew the plot couldn't be as straightforward as it seemed at first; that wasn't Saw. Something that changed everything had to happen, and here, it does, and it does so with gusto. I have to say, it was very satisfying. The final few minutes with the big reveals are a treat, and you get psyched-out a few times, but not for no reason, but because it's critical to the idea behind Jigsaw's plan.The short of it? There's plenty of gore, some unique deaths (and one involving drowning in dead exploding pig juice that is rather icky), and the whole twist ending thing Saw always does. The opening one we get is pretty high up there as likely the most potentially disturbing, and for people who love this stuff (like me) and actually like how sick they're willing to go in a film, it was a fun thing to watch (but you've got to admit that the rules were downright unfair for all he had to do--a minute and thirty for all that, plus escaping before he's blown up? Who could do that in a minute and thirty?). It's got the gore, the screams, the pain, all the stuff we love to watch.The thing is, Saw will never replace the horror films out there that are willing to push the envelope to near-impossible levels. Now, I understand that wide-release horrors can't be on the level of, say, the ""I Spit On Your Grave"" remake, which involved, among other things, a *forty-five minute rape scene*, and someone getting a shotgun through the mouth...in reverse. You'd have to see it to know what I mean. In any case, that was easily NC-17 material, with full-frontal nudity, unrestrained sadistic rape, gratuitous torture, and an emphasis on pain, rather than gore, which actually makes it unique. It's also not quite on the level of ""Hostel"" or ""High Tension"" or ""Suspiria"" or a bunch of other horror flicks, mostly foreign, you've likely never heard of. They get more liberties, or something, I dunno. American horror films don't get as much room to work with, I suppose.Not bad, not great--too heavy on worthless story none of us watched any of the films for, and too many breaks to go into the history of Jigsaw and Amanda, and other things absolutely no one cares about. Seriously, all we want is traps. Do nothing but give us Jigsaw making traps for 90 minutes, make them creative and well-designed, and we're all happy for it. But start throwing in a story, and our fast-forward buttons start to wear out. Saw III was the beginning of this, and it got worse as time went on, almost totally ruining the series until the disastrous ""Saw 3D"" (now officially retitled ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" because 3D

1037795,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000LC3ICY,"Cloud ""...""","[5, 7]","I'm not even going to consider recent films like Hostel, the Hills Have Eyes and Saw films ""horror"". It's more like a demented version of a slasher film. These films in essence rely on buckets of gore to scare their audience but therein lies the rub: it doesn't scare. Instead what it does is create a feeling of disgust, a ""eww!"" or a cringe rather than chill you to the bone and make you lose sleep. While I'll admit Saw was a pretty good film for what it was, on subsequent viewings it did fall apart and Saw II was just awful. Saw 3 is more in spirit to 1 but it's also filled with flaws from both.A bit more ambitious in scope, we follow 2 threads: Lynn, a doctor, is taken in by Amanda and Jigsaw because Jigsaw's tumor is getting worse and he wants to be alive to see the end of his next game. In another thread, Jeff, haunted by the death of his son, is not being tortured but what's tested is his need for revenge: he meets people that are strapped into torture devices and he has to get them out. Of course, in the world of Saw, it's not that simple.Be forewarned: this is definately the goriest film the series has seen. Does it work? Kind of. The victims are dispatched in unbelievably gruesome ways but rather than let your imagination take over, we see everything so nothing is left to wonder about. While it does make you cringe, especially one scene involving surgery, it doesn't really scare you to the point where you get goosebumps but rather you're hoping your dinner doesn't come up. Luckily the film has enough of other things to take your mind off it rather than just mindlessly putting in gore for the sake of it(I'm looking at you Hostel).How's the story and everything else? It's actually better. While there is plotholes and inconsistencies and whatnot, it's also a bit more better written and being able to juggle various stories, including scenes that involve the first 2 flims are fun so this is much better than part 2. Will we get a more super-duper version later on? I don't see how. We have all the gore we need, 3 commentaries and featurettes so what else needs to be shown? Although to capitalize on the inevitable Saw IV, we'll probably get another.I don't know if you'll want to buy it unless you love this stuff but give it a rent then make your decision then. Me?

1037797,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000LC3ICY,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 7]","Jigsaw is back, and he's got a nubile babe for an apprentice, the kind that'd make my nethers tingle if it wasn't for the fact she's a real sick twist.  Based on a screenplay by Leigh Whannell (Saw, Saw II), Saw III was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II), and features Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, The Quick and the Dead) reprising his role as Jigsaw, the methodical master of malicious mayhem.  Also appearing is Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Angus Macfadyen (Cradle Will Rock), Bahar Soomekh (Crash), Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers), and 1980s B movie favorite Betsy Russell (Private School, Tomboy), whose fianc&eacute; Mark Burg happened to be one of the numerous producers on the film, in a minor role.The third installment picks up where the last one left off as we see detective Eric Matthews (Wahlberg) in a familiar situation (familiar, at least, to someone who's seen the previous films), in a dank, grimy, dimly lit room, his leg shackled to a pipe, a rusty hacksaw within reach.  What follows is pretty wild (and messy), as Eric manages an escape, but not the way you might expect.  After this there's some bits with Eric's colleague Detective Kerry (Meyer), to which we move along into the story proper as we meet an attractive ER doctor named Lynn (Soomekh), whose life seems fraught with misery and despair, despite the appearance of having it all.  Anyway, after she's kidnapped by a figure donning a hog head, she finds herself in the Guru of Gristle's lair, a large, funky looking warehouse with intermittent lighting, filled to the brim with all kinds of wicked looking devices.  Lynn soon learns the reason behind her abduction as she meets the sickly Jigsaw (if you recall he was extremely ill in the previous film), along with his attractive assistant, the reason being to keep Jigsaw alive, with the cost of failure being her own life.  Seems Jiggy's got a game going, one he wants to be around for to see all the way through.  After this we meet the primary player in Jigsaw's most current game, a pathetic sack named Jeff (Macfadyen), as he's put through a series of tests, all of which involve other individuals suffering greatly, with Jeff having the ability to save them (for the whys and what nots you'll have to watch the film).  As Jeff progresses through Jigsaw's diabolical maze of gory madness, Lynn finds herself having to perform a little brain salad surgery, all while Jigsaw's assistant, who's a few clowns short of a circus, descends deeper into her own, personal pit of psychosis.  After a ton of flashbacks and some pretty horrific deaths, things eventually come full circle resulting in some memorable revelations.While I thought this third entry into the series entertaining, I think it is important to mention the importance of seeing the previous films prior to watching this one as there's a lot of references tied to what occurred previous i.e. this is not a stand alone sequel, as may be the case with other franchise features.  Now you could watch this film and follow along somewhat without having seen the previous entries, but you'll appreciate the complexities of the overall story all the more having all the pieces of the puzzle.  I did enjoy the concerted efforts to directly relate this to the previous films, but I thought the flashbacks to be excessive at times, especially the ones that filled in gaps that weren't necessarily vital in the overall scheme of things (Was anyone particularly enlightened by learning Jigsaw had help in setting up Dr. Gordon in the first film?).  Another aspect I didn't care for occurs near the end, after an important revelation...once revealed the filmmakers go through an extensive series short flashbacks perhaps to reinforce the impact, but it seemed more an effort to spoon feed the audience the all the bits that led up to said revelation, as if we weren't all that bright to get it in the first place.  I was paying attention so the events tied to the revelation weren't lost on me, and I felt it unnecessary to rehash the material.  Another bit that annoyed me slightly was the lighting in Jigsaw's lair...I thought it odd how many lighting fixtures worked on a sporadic basis, flashing on and off.  I know this was done to help create an atmosphere, but it became a little irritating after awhile.  The traps featured here were pretty wild (and vicious), and the gore factor high.  There are some real nasty devices throughout, the worst, in my opinion, being the rack, which Jigsaw claimed his personal favorite (the shotgun shell collar was a trip, as was the hideous hog-o-matic processor).  I won't reveal any more about it, but know it provides for a whole lot of intense, lingering pain before delivering death.  There are a few twists near the end, one of which, involving Lynn, I thought particularly well done, especially given the fact Jigsaw provided a good deal of clues prior to the revelation.  These clues seem innocuous statements initially, but once fully understood, they provide a respectable punch to the gut.  The performances were suitable, the story thoughtful and generally well crafted (there are a few holes and elements that require a good deal of suspension of disbelief), the atmosphere suitably grimy and ookie, and the pacing reasonable.  The story was complicated, but I thought Bousman, along with his editor, did a good job in keeping things orderly, ultimately paving the way for another sequel.This unrated DVD version (which runs 113 minutes compared to the 107 minute theatrical runtime), released by Lions Gate, features a sharp looking, widescreen anamorphic (1.78:1) picture, along with a vibrant audio track, available in both 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital for English and Spanish.  There's a healthy assortment of extras including three featurettes, the first titled The Traps of Saw III, another titled The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III, and a third called Darren's Diary: Anatomy of a Director.  Also included are three commentary tracks, one featuring director Darren Lynn Bousman, writer/executive producer Leigh Whannell, and producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg, a second featuring executive producers Peter Block and Jason Constantine, and a third with director Darren Lynn Bousman, editor Kevin Greutert, and director of photography David A. Armstrong.  On top of that are deleted scenes, subtitles in English and Spanish, a theatrical trailer, a theatrical teaser, and trailers for Crank (2006), Saw Special Edition DVD, Saw II Special Edition DVD, The Punisher Extended Cut DVD, The Invincible Iron Man (2007) animated feature, and Hostel II (2007).  If you really thrive on extras, this is a decent edition to get, but you might want to wait and see if Lion's Gate, a company that seems to specialize in double dipping, is going to eventually release a two DVD special edition of the film, as they did with the previous Saw movies.Cookieman108By the way, am I the only who thinks Shawnee Smith looks a lot better with long hair?",4,"""Live or die.

With Saw 2, things took a little more graphic turn, there was still a nice twist ending, and the story wasn't as heavy handed, there was a ""fun"" element to the story. Saw 3 cranks up the gore, and slaps the viewer with a heavy, very melancholy storyline. Saw 3 is so depressive, there is really no one to cheer for, you really don't care who lives or dies as there is really no character development, and the two new main characters/victims are so unlikable you begin to lose interest.

1037805,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000LC3ICY,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 4]","WARNING: This opinionated review contains some spoilers from ""Saw"" and ""Saw II.""  This review is intended for people who have actually seen the first two movies, and if you haven't, you should be...unless you're the squeamish type.This is Del Keyes, saying ""This is not a stand-alone film.""- REVIEW""Saw III"" marks the final chapter of the series, and by that, I mean the final chapter with James Wan, Leigh Whannell, and Darren Bousman involved with the franchise (Lionsgate does not want the profitable series to end just yet). Because of that acknowledgement, this will be the last time I'm going to blatantly exploit the use of the word ""saw"", so here it goes.  The ""Saw"" series is a sight to see: it saw the attention it deserves, and it provides many curious horror fans something different to see.  It slices, it dices, and it cuts through the meat and bones, among a whole bunch of cheesy saw-related puns I can't even think of.In all seriousness, the third outing is a surprising improvement over the previous installment, which I personally felt like it was on auto-pilot for the whole movie, keeping it on a steady pace with little outrageous moments.  It is nothing like that in this sequel, as it moves away the sporadic law-enforcement scenarios, and centers on what's truly important in the series: Jigsaw and his games.  This time, the movie goes behind-the-scenes into the business of his sadistic games.The sequel acts as a direct continuation of ""Saw II"" as the movie starts off with Marky Mark's brother stuck in a bad predicament thanks to the Jigsaw.  Meanwhile, Dina Meyer's character tries to find him in a series of leads made by Jigsaw's victims.  The continuation was all simply to tie up loose-ends (in a ""Saw"" manner) just so the movie can move along with the confrontation of Jigsaw and his accomplice, Amanda.  That's right: the victim of the first two films is The Jigsaw's partner-in-crime/divine intervention.A nurse named Lynn is captured by the hands of the duo, because The Jigsaw is not exactly at the top of his game, thanks to the malignant tumor in his noggin.  In this new game, the nurse must forcibly save the life of the husky-voiced maniac in order to save her own, while another (and Jigsaw's last) game takes place for a different victim following a three-step program to bitter torment.  The centered victim of the game is a father sworn for vengeance, and he'll come across paths and choices that will make him question his own principles, and ultimately decide if he achieves the one thing the Jigsaw tries to give to the victims: redemption...along with permanent physical and mental scars.The sequel furthers the backstory approach of ""Saw II"" as it sheds (or shreds) some more light into Jigsaw's history, but it also explains the relationship between him and Amanda.  Amanda is viewed as a compassionate person who is solely devoted to the killer who she sees as a father figure, so her feelings entices him, yet dreads him at the same time.  Without giving too much away, Amanda is a very interesting character for this sequel.  Their relationship goes further as the movie shows how some of their infamous games were set up, which the flashbacks ties up a few loose-ends of the series; although, it still doesn't explain about the shock treatments from the first movie.  To extend open wounds to the story, Leigh Whannell makes a cameo appearance to explain how his character, Adam, got killed.  The only thing that baffles me about the backstory is when it gets into the intimate life of Jigsaw back when he was known as John: it only last for a couple of seconds and it was never explained as if it's an afterthought for some progression with the nurse.  Although the sequel didn't completely recovered the rough spots of the canon, at least with it solidifies the connection of the whole Jigsaw business.Story aside, will there be more blood in the games in ""Saw III""?  There will be more blood, alright; there will also be more chains, more broken limbs, more screaming, more begging, more spastic camera movements, basically almost every gruesome thing to please the inner sadist.  Although the games are not quite the focus this time around, there are plenty of them, and most of them are twisted and inventive, just how Wan/Whannell/Bousman likes it.  Some will gross you out, and few will shock you, especially the torture device I like to call ""The Twist.""  Watching the scene with that device makes me think it could've been much more graphic, but that's where uncut DVDs are for.""Saw III"" brought back the things I like from the original, the claustrophobic scenery, the tough-to-decide nature of the games, and the morbid philosophies of Jigsaw's intentions.  The sequel brings the pieces together, leading to one impressive climax.

Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[0, 0]","As far as just being a movie, this one isn't bad...much better than Saw 2 but nowhere near as good as the original.  As I mentioned in previous reviews, this franchise has a built-in limited shelf life.  There is only so much you can drag out a series like this.  The original Saw was a beautifully gruesome idea that was worked with a brilliant touch of morbid, sick class.  The second movie  was a cheap sequel that made no effort to disguise its cheap, shameless capitalistic quality of just living off the reputation of the original.  This third movie had an obvious influence by Saw originators L. Wannell and J. Wan.  Their writing and influence in this flick shows.  It is a fairly-well thought-out movie premise on its own.  But as I said, this series has its limits as far as how far you can stretch the idea before it becomes ridiculous.  Sure, all movies are fantasy.  They all ask you to believe what can not really happen in everyday life.  And the better movies can get away with asking for more ""fantasy lenience"" than others.  But in a franchise such as this, your limits are being tested before you get to Part 3.  Where does this Jigsaw guy get the resources to perform these grotesque acts on people???  On its own, this is a pretty decent gore movie.  I enjoyed it.  But they are really pushing it when they kidnap a doctor and ask her to conduct brain surgery on Jigsaw in some abandoned warehouse with power tools and aspirin.  The main theme is clever, in a disgusting, sick way.  But, we're reaching the point where continuing this franchise is beating a dead horse.  Where it is obvious that Wannell and Wan put some thought into this movie, the time has come to move on.  If you like that Saw series, this movie is way better than Saw 2, but it makes no effort to contend with the brilliance of the original Saw.  And just so you know, Saw 4 is good, but it's really time to stop!!!  I just heard that a Saw 5 is coming out in the fall.  All I can say is, the horse is dead already!  Seriously, it's dead!!!

Though there is some greatness about the first Saw that gets a little lost in each of the sequals, there is more that is added too.  In the case of Saw 3, I must say the scenerios are as disturbing as ever, and becoming more complex and original.  The movie begins with a bone-crunching (literally) squirming start that already leaves a nasty flavor, and quickly moves to a scene with a man standing in an old classroom, with chains inserted throughout various parts of his body.  The bloodshed gets going in Saw 3, though the real scenario takes about 30 minutes to set-up.The Saw theme still continues in the third installment - ""are you grateful to be alive?"" and a little more is added to the mix about obsessive vegence.  Such is the case with Jeff.  His son has been killed in an accident.  Jeff is forced through a series of tests, placing him in contact with the various people he wishes were dead since they did nothing to help his situation (eyewitness, judge, and the killer himself).  Jeff's test is to see what lengths he will go to forgive these individuals and save them before the traps they are in expire.  This is where traps in Saw begin to take on a whole new level.  It's not merely bloodshed anymore, and though not always gore-filled, the scenarios are quite frightful such as a naked woman in a freezer room, constantly sprayed with water.  Or a man chained to the bottom of a pit, while hogs are liquified and dumped on him...yes you heard right.  The scene is enough to make one vomit.While Jeff is being tested, Jigsaw is on his deathbed, and another test is occuring.  Lynn is a doctor who must keep Jigsaw alive or she dies as Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who makes a recurring role from all the Saw films thus far) watches in frustration.  Keeping tradition going, you can expect another surprise ending you may not have seen coming, but would say is more predictable than the previous two Saw films.  People are being tested in the film, but in the end you begin to realize the bigger picture and what the bigger tests actually are.Saw 3 does a great job of keeping things in perspective with the prior films, mostly the first Saw, which is fine by me since it is the original and I thought a stronger movie than Saw 2.  There are plenty of flashbacks of Amanda, how she became Jigsaw's apprentice, and we even get to see some prequal shots that went into the making of the bathroom scene in Saw.  Saw 3 even begins exactly where Saw 2 left, with detective Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg again reprising the role) locked up in that same bathroom.Saw 3 is a good continuation to the series.  The story remains fairly complex, interesting and somewhat unpredictable, though still looses the greatness of the first two movies.  If you are looking for blood, gore, and terrifying traps, Saw 3 goes all out this time.  I say, just be grateful with your life so you don't have to ever experience them.Acting - 3Characters - 3.5Horror/Gore - 5Story - 4Overall - 4",4,Saw 3 times as disturbing,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,3065,"['Saw', 'series', 'movin', 'right', 'fairly', 'well', 'might', 'add', 'greatness', 'first', 'Saw', 'little', 'lost', 'sequals', 'more', 'added', 'too', 'case', 'Saw', '3', 'must', 'say', 'scenerios', 'are', 'as', 'disturbing', 'ever', 'becoming', 'more', 'complex', 'original', 'movie', 'bone-crunching', 'literally', 'squirming', 'start', 'already', 'nasty', 'flavor', 'quickly', 'moves', 'scene', 'man', 'standing', 'old', 'classroom', 'chains', 'inserted', 'various', 'parts', 'body', 'bloodshed', 'going', 'Saw', '3', 'real', 'scenario', '30', 'minutes', 'set-up.The', 'Saw', 'theme', 'still', 'third', 'installment', 'are', 'grateful', 'be', 'alive', 'little', 'more', 'added', 'mix', 'obsessive', 'vegence', 'Such', 'case', 'Jeff', 'son', 'been', 'killed', 'accident', 'Jeff', 'forced', 'series', 'tests', 'placing', 'contact', 'various', 'people', 'were', 'dead', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'situation', 'eyewitness', 'judge', 'killer', 'Jeff', 'test', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'go', 'forgive', 'individuals', 'save', 'traps', 'are', 'expire', 'where', 'traps', 'Saw', 'begin', 'take', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'not', 'merely', 'bloodshed', 'anymore', 'not', 'always', 'gore-filled', 'scenarios', 'are', 'quite', 'frightful', 'such', 'naked', 'woman', 'freezer', 'room', 'constantly', 'sprayed', 'water', 'man', 'chained', 'bottom', 'pit', 'hogs', 'are', 'liquified', 'dumped', 'yes', 'heard', 'right', 'scene', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'vomit.While', 'Jeff', 'being', 'tested', 'Jigsaw', 'deathbed', 'test', 'occuring', 'Lynn', 'doctor', 'who', 'must', 'keep', 'Jigsaw', 'alive', 'Jigsaw', 'apprentice', 'Amanda', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'who', 'recurring', 'role', 'Saw', 'films', 'thus', 'far', 'watches', 'frustration', 'Keeping', 'tradition', 'going', 'can', 'expect', 'surprise', 'ending', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'predictable', 'previous', 'two', 'Saw', 'films', 'People', 'are', 'being', 'tested', 'film', 'end', 'begin', 'realize', 'bigger', 'picture', 'what', 'bigger', 'tests', 'actually', 'are.Saw', '3', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'things', 'perspective', 'prior', 'films', 'mostly', 'first', 'Saw', 'fine', 'original', 'thought', 'stronger', 'movie', 'Saw', '2', 'are', 'plenty', 'flashbacks', 'Amanda', 'how', 'became', 'Jigsaw', 'apprentice', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'prequal', 'shots', 'went', 'making', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'Saw', 'Saw', '3', 'even', 'exactly', 'where', 'Saw', '2', 'left', 'detective', 'Mathews', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'again', 'reprising', 'role', 'locked', 'up', 'same', 'bathroom.Saw', '3', 'good', 'continuation', 'series', 'story', 'fairly', 'complex', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'unpredictable', 'still', 'greatness', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'looking', 'blood', 'gore', 'terrifying', 'traps', 'Saw', '3', 'time', 'say', 'just', 'be', 'grateful', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ever', 'experience', 'them.Acting', '3Characters', '3.5Horror/Gore', '5Story', '4Overall', '4']",N/A

It doesn't matter that I haven't seen Saw II yet, they all stand on their own pretty well. Though I do plan on seeing the second one.Saw III featured some Great torture rigs and contraptions. Appalling is an understatement. I'm a horror fanatic from way back and some of the scenes in this movie made me shutter and wince. Okay, I was actually squeemish during a few parts, must be losing my edge. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted.The plot is strong too. We get the rundown on what's really been going on behind the scenes through the other Saw movies, but it's not necessary to see those films to appreciate this one. Strong story, good directing and excellent set design, camera work.There is a lot of jumping around between past and present so be alert, it can get confusing. I actually found that back and forth to be a little annoying. Also there were a few parts that seem insignificant, but I guess they serve to give us insight into the characters. One example is the girl who play's Jigsaw's psycho-let's test your will to live-in-training, and the part where she sits down and begins carving a line into her leg. We see other lines there so we can establish fairly quickly that she has issues, though I think we're be able to get that early on in the film anyway.The acting was good in most cases, but Jigsaw's protege delivered some pretty weak lines.I recommend this to any horror fan with a strong stomach.

But for me, that was not what created the suspense in the film, it was the story of Jigsaw, Amanda and Lynn.  Amanda is an especially interesting character.  I had not seen the other two movies in a while so the ""flashbacks"" were helpful., especially to help flesh out her roles in all of this madness.I think this movie is the most intelligent of the three.  I liked the sort of ""twist upon twist"" added to the end.  Although I hope this is the last installment of the Saw franchise, I am sure money-hungry Hollywood is already planning another.  Here we have Jigsaw, who has appointed himself ""God"", on his deathbed playing more of his gory games.  When he says he despises murderers, it's a big fat clue for the story, but has his brain cancer made him so deranged he actually believes that lie?  By trying to take him from a crazy, twisted, psycho killer into a killer with a cause, or a ""message"" it weakens the story even more than it did in Saw 2.  The story almost tries to make him a little too warm and fuzzy, and I am just not buying that!  The movie, especially the ending, is no less breath-taking for it though.Top-notch acting from the entire cast.  Original story.  Inventive horror scenes make this a great gory horror movie.

They were so consumed with rage and allowed it to get the best of them.The people who were kidnapped and placed in various torturing/killing machines were objects of rage for the subjects.

I must admit Saw III has many gross bloody moments with great torture devices but it was so rushed to get to the end that they forgot to let us get to know any of the characters.  These movies have made enough money to get some better known actors haven't they?  Perhaps familiar faces would help the audience connect to the characters more.  Or better writing too.  In Saw III we get what is expected.  More games, more sick twisted scenes, and we also get a surprise at the end of the movie that for me was worth giving the film four stars.

The producers of Saw were enjoying the profits made from cheaply and easily grossing-out morbid audiences with icky gore and people screaming. It's not clever, and it's not even remotely classy.Clocking in at just under two hours, this is the longest of the Saw series, but the constant flashbacks that bloat that running time are already becoming very tiresome and gives the movie the feel of a TV show. Chopping the heavy plot into vignettes is not very theatrical or interesting.With Jigsaw still at large and Donnie Wahlberg's angry cop now missing the cops begin to suspect that Jiggy has an accomplice. This is all forgotten about by the five-minute mark as the movie then sidetracks into a story about a man who has lost his son in a car accident and wishes for retribution. Jiggy arranges for the retribution to happen, but advises him to save the people responsible from gruesome death instead of letting them die.Jiggy's judgement and justification is already becoming dubious and morally suspect by this point. I half expect him to start kidnapping and setting-up people for watching too much Nickelodeon or flying too many kites. The morality should go both ways. If Jiggy is subjecting so many people to unbearable agony then he should have experience and knowledge of much, much more than simply dying of cancer and surviving a car crash. Who does he think he is? Ultimately, he's just as bad as the people he is judging.The story is worthy of a higher score, but as usual it is bogged down by horrendous editing, cheap photography filled with fake filters, a loud sound design filled with nonsensical effects, and characters who do not think logically.It reminded me a lot of Hellraiser, only with none of the magic. Unfortunately, for anyone watching the whole series, it's vital that you digest every minute, overwrought plot point.The Blu-ray present the film in 1.78:1 1080p that exhibits all of the fake color filters in their unappealing glory with a rather old-fashioned DTS ES 5.1 soundtrack.

More gore included.SAW II (2005) was a huge success!  When we last left the intense dilemma, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) had beaten Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and through the maze of walls and doors in the warehouse, it was a race against time to find his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) and the other victims. Amanda was the culprit and Eric found himself in the bathroom from SAW (2004). He was trapped, shackled, shut-in and yelling for his life.Lions Gate/Twisted Pictures presents SAW III (2006).  The movie begins at the exact frame where SAW II ended.Tobin Bell, Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Dina Meyer, Franky G, Leigh Whannel and Billy the Puppet return for this third film.Kerry (Dina Meyer) can not find Eric (Donnie Wahlberg), but her and Forensic Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) they find the remains of Troy (J. Larose). We are treated with scenes of him shackled with chains imbedded into his skin.  Since Kerry is so clever in solving the crime, she too becomes a prisoner of Jigsaw.We are introduced to two new characters: Lynn and Jeff.Lynn (Bahar Soomekh),who is a doctor, is captured in the hospital locker room by someone wearing a pig head. By Amanda (Shawnee Smith) she is brought to Jigsaw John, who is gravely ill lying in a hospital bed in a new secret place, the Gideon warehouse.  He wants Lynn to help him live. A collar device is put over her. There are 5 cocked gun barrels on this collar. If Jigsaw John's heart rate flat lines or she moves out of range, she will die at the same time as him.A man, Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), is trapped in a crate box. Jeff escapes and as he wonders through the warehouse, finds other people in deadly traps, Danica (Debra Lynne McCabe), Judge Halden (Barry Flatman) and Timothy (Mpho Koaho). He has his own series of tests to go through. That's part of the game.For SAW fans, new footage: Amanda will reflect upon how she became involved with Jigsaw John and then preparing for the first game we saw in SAW (2004).Costas Mandylor appears as ""Forensic Hoffman"" in SAW 3. This is a very important clue for SAW 4.Best line: The only place that he can get those drugs is in the hospital.Writer and Executive Producer Leigh Whannel plays ""Adam"".The neck collar was once worn by Tina Turner in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985).***Thank you Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G.(as the corpse) for returning to SAW III.Gregg Hoffman who passed away December 4, 2005, after the release of SAW II (2005) was given credit as Producer for SAW III.Special Features:The Traps of Saw 3 (9 min.)The Props of Saw 3 (8 min.)Darren's Diary (9 min.)2 deleted scenes3 different audio commentaries found in ""Set-Up""movie trailer and teaserOption of subtitles in English, Spanish.The Full Screen Unrated Edition contains previews of Crank (2006), Special Editions of Saw (2004), Saw 2 (2005), Punisher (2004) Extended Editions,The Invincible Iron Man cartoon (2007), Hostel Part II (2007).DVD container is wrapped in tight plastic, but please be careful, there is also a protective see-through cover slip that lifts off that you need to save.

Enjoy.A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.Saw THREE begins with ONE person trapped in an abandoned MEATPACKING PLANT.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, JEFF (Angus Macfadyen) has to prove his will to live, and his ability to FORGIVE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor) are investigating as a team, but ALLISON KERRY may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that AMANDA YOUNG (Shawnee Smith) may be an accomplice to his abduction, and his situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS (for OTHERS) or guaranteed death (for his family).  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.Several murderous contraptions like the CHAIN CHAIR (for a HABITUAL CRIMINAL), the PIG VAT TRAP (for an ACTIVIST JUDGE), and the NECK BREAKER RACK TRAP (for a MURDERER) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene EXPLODING RIB ANGEL TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S MODUS OPERANDI, and on to Saw IV.Jason Elin",4,Saw III - The downfall of Jigsaw,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1917,"['consecutively', 'watching', 'entire', 'Saw', 'series', 'recent', 'weekend', 'LOVING', 'decided', 'single', 'review', 'modified', 'details', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'films', 'Enjoy.A', 'sadistic', 'sociopath', 'similar', 'one', 'Se7en', 'affinity', 'engineering', 'play', 'lethal', 'games', 'forcing', 'victims', 'unappreciative', 'life', 'existential', 'choice', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'engineering', 'machinery.Saw', 'THREE', 'ONE', 'person', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'MEATPACKING', 'PLANT', 'Forced', 'play', 'killer', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'John', 'Jigsaw', 'Kramer', 'game', 'JEFF', 'Angus', 'Macfadyen', 'prove', 'will', 'live', 'ability', 'FORGIVE', 'Meanwhile', 'DET', 'ALLISON', 'KERRY', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'OFFICER', 'DANIEL', 'RIGG', 'Lyriq', 'Bent', 'rugged', 'veteran', 'DET', 'MARK', 'HOFFMAN', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'are', 'investigating', 'team', 'ALLISON', 'KERRY', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'deep', 'law', 'increasingly', 'closer', 'ensnaring', 'Jigsaw', 'game', 'participant', 'AMANDA', 'YOUNG', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'may', 'be', 'accomplice', 'abduction', 'situation', 'choice', 'VARIOUS', 'TRAPS', 'OTHERS', 'guaranteed', 'death', 'family', 'help', 'cause', 'cryptic', 'clues', 'left', 'mini', 'cassette', 'tape', 'lead', 'aka', 'life', 'perpetrator', 'precipice', 'twisted', 'rehabilitation', 'potential', 'tomb.Several', 'murderous', 'contraptions', 'CHAIN', 'CHAIR', 'HABITUAL', 'CRIMINAL', 'PIG', 'VAT', 'TRAP', 'ACTIVIST', 'JUDGE', 'NECK', 'BREAKER', 'RACK', 'TRAP', 'MURDERER', 'provide', 'horror', 'fodder', 'form', 'viscera', 'blood', 'spatter', 'other', 'traps', 'opening', 'scene', 'EXPLODING', 'RIB', 'ANGEL', 'TRAP', 'are', 'inserted', 'same', 'reason', 'Spock', 'Kirk', 'always', 'took', 'ensign', 'Jones', 'away', 'parties', 'someone', 'situation', 'die', 'horribly', 'Climax', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'quick', 'succession', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'necessary', 'details', 'viewer', 'more', 'JIGSAW', 'MODUS', 'OPERANDI', 'Saw', 'IV.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

The 2nd movie was way over hyped (I mean seriously; were those people retarded?) & the only thing that saved it was the twist ending that even still seemed forced.  This 3rd  movie though is dead in the water.  I watched the whole movie waiting for something, anything that might make this newest installment worthy of being put to film... nope.  This one introduces plot points that conflict with the last 2 movies, & this movies forced ending didn't come off nearly as smoothly, in fact, you see it coming from miles away.  I'll admit there is some nifty gore & grotesque moments in the movie, but that's about all it's got going for it.  The fact that there's already a 4th movie in the works just makes me cringe.  Lionsgate, once again is gonna take something good & run it through the mud 'til every last dollar has been sponged out of it & the property is then left worthless.  I understand people are hungry for descent horror, but lowered standards does not a good movie make.

1037835,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B000LC3ICY,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 8]","Tobin Bell returns as the diabolical ""Jigsaw"" in this excellent 3rd installment of the now-famous ""Saw"" series.  This movie picks up right where part II left off.  We see Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) slamming the door on a well and truly trapped Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg).  ""Game's over"", she mutters as she leaves.  But is the game over for Matthews?  It is for one other part II carryover; Kerry (Dina Meyer).  She is investigating the death of a former ex-con who has died in a most brutal manner.  At first, she doesn't expect Jigsaw was involved, but she soon learns otherwise as the video retrieved from the crime scene shows.Soon, Kerry is abducted by Amanda and she meets the same gruesome demise as the crime scene victims she used to investigate.  But the real story follows .There are two story lines in this movie.  One deals with Jigsaw's worsening brain tumor.  Realizing his condition is deterorating, he instructs Amanda to abduct Lynn (Bakar Soomekh), a successful surgeon, to help with his condition.  Upset with her life situation, Lynn is apparently just going through the motions at her job.  Amanda abducts her and leads her to Jigsaw, where she is fitted with an explosive collar designed to detonate if Jigsaw ""flatlines"".  She is forced to keep Jigsaw alive or risk her own death.The other plot deals with a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen).  Jeff's young son was killed by a drunk driver, and he has been dealing with feelings of revenge.  Captured by Jigsaw and placed in a box, he is released and able to confront those responsible for the death of his son; the lone eyewitness, the leniant judge, and the driver himself.  He has the choice of saving each of these people or letting them die.  Will Jeff choose life or death?  Will he be able to overcome his feelings of rage and save these people, or will they die like so many other of Jigsaw's victims?The best part of the movie is the final 15 minutes.  In this time, all of the questions and twists of the movie are neatly wrapped up.  Watch closely so you don't miss anything.I found this movie to be the best of the ""Saw"" movies by far.  Tobin Bell does a magnificent job as the maniachal Jigsaw, and the other actors are very good as well.  What sets this movie apart from the first two is its excellent plot.  It will keep you guessing throughout until everything is revealed at the end.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The ""Saw"" series has become one of the biggest horror movie series in recent memory, and this thrilling and bloody installment maintains the earlier tradition.  The scenes in this movie are much more graphic than in the first two movies, so watch with caution.  This series has become one of my favorites, and ""Saw III"" keeps the action and blood flowing.",5,"The Best  of the ""Saw"" Movies",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,2795,"['Tobin', 'Bell', 'diabolical', 'Jigsaw', 'excellent', '3rd', 'installment', 'now-famous', 'Saw', 'series', 'movie', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'part', 'II', 'left', 'off', 'see', 'Jigsaw', 'apprentice', 'Amanda', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'slamming', 'door', 'well', 'truly', 'trapped', 'Eric', 'Matthews', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Game', 'over', 'game', 'Matthews', 'one', 'other', 'part', 'II', 'carryover', 'Kerry', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'investigating', 'death', 'former', 'ex-con', 'who', 'died', 'most', 'brutal', 'manner', 'first', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'involved', 'soon', 'otherwise', 'video', 'retrieved', 'crime', 'scene', 'shows.Soon', 'Kerry', 'abducted', 'Amanda', 'same', 'gruesome', 'demise', 'crime', 'scene', 'victims', 'used', 'investigate', 'real', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'story', 'lines', 'movie', 'One', 'deals', 'Jigsaw', 'worsening', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Realizing', 'condition', 'deterorating', 'Amanda', 'abduct', 'Lynn', 'Bakar', 'Soomekh', 'successful', 'surgeon', 'help', 'condition', 'Upset', 'life', 'situation', 'Lynn', 'apparently', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'job', 'Amanda', 'Jigsaw', 'where', 'fitted', 'explosive', 'collar', 'designed', 'detonate', 'Jigsaw', 'flatlines', 'forced', 'keep', 'Jigsaw', 'alive', 'risk', 'own', 'death.The', 'other', 'plot', 'deals', 'man', 'named', 'Jeff', 'Angus', 'Macfadyen', 'Jeff', 'young', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'drunk', 'driver', 'been', 'dealing', 'feelings', 'revenge', 'Captured', 'Jigsaw', 'placed', 'box', 'released', 'able', 'confront', 'responsible', 'death', 'son', 'lone', 'eyewitness', 'leniant', 'judge', 'driver', 'choice', 'saving', 'people', 'letting', 'die', 'Will', 'Jeff', 'choose', 'life', 'death', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'overcome', 'feelings', 'rage', 'save', 'people', 'will', 'die', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Jigsaw', 'victims', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'time', 'questions', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Watch', 'closely', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'best', 'Saw', 'movies', 'far', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'magnificent', 'job', 'maniachal', 'Jigsaw', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'What', 'movie', 'apart', 'first', 'two', 'excellent', 'plot', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'everything', 'revealed', 'end.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'Saw', 'series', 'become', 'one', 'biggest', 'horror', 'movie', 'series', 'recent', 'memory', 'thrilling', 'bloody', 'installment', 'earlier', 'tradition', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'graphic', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'so', 'watch', 'caution', 'series', 'become', 'one', 'favorites', 'Saw', 'III', 'action', 'blood', 'flowing']",N/A

No one knew who was the vicious mastermind behind these inventive and repugnant torture/murders or who would go to such lengths to prove something to society about the depreciation of life. Saw II"" carried on in a similar vein; more was revealed about Jigsaw and he was face to face with an angry cop who wanted his son back.  Still, we didn't know anything about him and it never became too personal; he remained a ghastly enigma with an intriguingly intelligent and thoroughly evil persona.In this movie, though, they make the character that could have rivalled Hannibal Lecter into a soap opera.  The film begins promisingly (an ex-con gets permanently reformed in a rather unorthodox way) and Jigsaw, ironically, has to face his own mortality through his imminent death by cancer.  From there it degenerates into tedious emotional dynamics involving his protege Amanda, a young doctor with a time operated shotgun shell collar around her neck, and plays an extended and really ridiculous ""game"" with a blameless victim of a drunk driver.The character Jeff and his ""vengeance conflict"" (how can you blame the guy for not wanting to save the guy who ran over his child?) is really just an excuse for us to watch Jigsaw's demented assistant indulge in emotional drama about her checkered and boring past.  Things get so monotonous that nothing shocks anymore.  The end is the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen and it isn't enduring what precedes it.

His comrad Amanda is still there yet not as sane or calm as before) However, in his newest game there are not as many players, it really takes you back to the atmosphere of the first one. We first see Lynn, a doctor who has lost contact with her children and her husband, disconnected and lost from her own world. She is choosen to keep Jigsaw alive until his final game has finished (if not the results will be deadly). Then we have Jeff, a man who has lost his son, as he was killed by a drunk driver and seeks vengeance against all involved. That is his prison, that is his torment. As Jeff is  put to the test, we see he really isn't in any physical pain, in  fact it is much worse pain he must confront. All, the people involved, witness, judge, drunk driver are hidden in rooms and if jeff wishes to survive, he  must do the most painful thing of  all.

Only two movies have ever scared me, and I think that once, perhaps, I jumped a bit in my seat at a part where the rest of the theater gasped or screamed. This is one of those few movies that made me squirm. The gruesome - but not gratuitous - torture scenes are creative and original, and the ""special effects"", i.e., what they do to make us believe that a guy really is breaking his own foot to be able to get out of shackles is just brilliant.The inclusion of Amanda's character, and her own private struggles, gives this installment of the Saw trilogy - in my opinion - a stronger story line. Not only are there the ""games"" we have come to enjoy and expect, there are two psychologically damaged characters (Jigsaw and Amanda) to watch interact and develop.The plot is fairly straightforward, but we don't realize this until we get to the end. In essence, Jigsaw is dying and he recruits the help of a beautiful young doctor who just happens to be the best in her field. That's the first extension of disbelief the movie demands. The climax asks us to *really* suspend disbelief, as it could not have happened if it weren't for a remarkable coincidence of concurrent events. This didn't do too much to hurt the film, but it certainly would have been nicer to end on a stronger, tighter note.This is forgivable, because the rest of the film was very logical and things happened in their appropriate sequence.3.5/5, rounded up to 4.",4,Disturbing and squirm-worthy,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,1507,"['are', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'make', 'grimace', 'squirm', 'seat', 'Only', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'scared', 'think', 'once', 'perhaps', 'jumped', 'bit', 'seat', 'part', 'where', 'rest', 'theater', 'gasped', 'screamed', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'made', 'squirm', 'gruesome', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'creative', 'original', 'special', 'effects', 'i.e.', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'believe', 'guy', 'really', 'breaking', 'own', 'foot', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'shackles', 'just', 'brilliant.The', 'inclusion', 'Amanda', 'character', 'own', 'private', 'struggles', 'installment', 'Saw', 'trilogy', 'opinion', 'stronger', 'story', 'line', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'games', 'have', 'come', 'enjoy', 'expect', 'are', 'two', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'characters', 'Jigsaw', 'Amanda', 'watch', 'interact', 'develop.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'get', 'end', 'essence', 'Jigsaw', 'dying', 'help', 'beautiful', 'young', 'doctor', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'field', 'first', 'extension', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'climax', '*really*', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'were', ""n't"", 'remarkable', 'coincidence', 'concurrent', 'events', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'much', 'hurt', 'film', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nicer', 'end', 'stronger', 'tighter', 'note.This', 'forgivable', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'logical', 'things', 'happened', 'appropriate', 'sequence.3.5/5', 'rounded', 'up', '4']",N/A

After that I watched ""Saw 3"", but I hadn't seen the first two in so long that I thought the third film contradicted certain elements contained in the first two, and was also much gorier and seemingly short on plot. However, after re-watching each of the movies in the franchise back-to-back my opinions have somewhat changed. I actually found myself liking the original film much better the second time around, and found ""Saw 2"" to be fairly disappointing by comparison, due to a lack of character development and an over-reliance on shock and gore, instead of developing an eerily creepy atmosphere and a story that would deliver genuine thrills as the original film had done. Which brings me to my re-watching of the third film in the series, ""Saw 3"". Going into this film I wondered if my opinion would change as drastically as it had on the previous two films or if it would remain essentially the same as it was after the first time I watched the movie. Either way, I was curious to see what results awaited my repeat viewing of the film that I felt was the weakest in the series thus far.""Saw 3"" picks up immediately after the events of ""Saw 2"", and we find Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) desperately trying to free himself in order to save his son. However, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) isn't as fair as Jigsaw and has no intention of allowing Eric to escape. After their brutal altercation (essentially tying off the dangling loose ends left over from the previous film), Amanda joins her mentor, the ailing Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), in overseeing their latest series of tests, one involves a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) who is extremely talented and caring in the operating room yet is cold and aloof to her family at home. The second test focuses on a heartbroken father (Angus MacFadyen) who has lost his son in an automobile accident and would give anything to exact vengeance on those he holds responsible. As each of the subjects advance through their own series of tests, Jigsaw's already deteriorating health seems to be declining at an increasingly rapid rate, but this will not deter the maniacal mastermind from seeing his carefully designed plans come to fruition.When I watched ""Saw 3"" for the first time after it had recently arrived on DVD in early 2007, I initially found the film to be just another standard horror film that was intent on using as much blood and gore as the MPAA would allow in a film. Basically the filmmakers wanted to see just how much they could get away with before the audience was completely disgusted. The traps had seemed more grotesque, and were even more inescapable than those in the previous two films (which it turned out was the case due to Amanda's refusal to give her victims a chance at life, a fact that was shown in several flashbacks throughout the movie), and the results of the traps were even more bizarre and horrifying than what either of the first two films had attempted. Also, I had thought that the story for ""Saw 3"" contradicted certain events of the previous two movies, especially the first movie, and a couple of moments in the second, leaving me wondering why the writers of this installment, James Wan and Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the first film together), would contradict their own work from the original movie.Well, after finishing ""Saw 3"" for the second time I must say that my opinion of the film has changed in some instances. I found that the story, which I initially found contradictory, was very well put together and was not contradictory in the least. The story also felt more in sync with the tone of the original film, by having Jigsaw and Amanda's traps be more planned out, forcing their victims to take part in them rather than the rather coincidental approach to the second film where the victims seemed to be allowed to avoid the traps if they could. One facet of the story of ""Saw 3"" that I really enjoyed were the flashbacks to events surrounding the first two films, which really deepened the story for the overall franchise and connected each of the films together even more than before. For the most part, I liked that the flashbacks explained the change in how the traps went from being escapable to impossible to survive, and also how careful the planning was for the traps used in the first film. One complaint I did have with the flashbacks was the fact that we are introduced to Jigsaw's past, which was fine, but we are shown a woman with whom he is seemingly in love with, but we learn nothing about her other than the fact that we see them together for a couple of scenes. I really hate it when a movie simply introduces an element into the plot that is intended to be resolved in the next film, so that nothing comes of it in the current movie you are watching. Why bother including a segment in one film if nothing will come of that segment until the sequel, just wait and include the segment when you (meaning the writers) are ready to flesh it out further. Because the segment, though intended to show a much softer Jigsaw from the days before he became the monster he now is, was ultimately pointless and even more irritating due to the fact that it seemed like it's sole purpose was for us to feel some empathy for Jigsaw, and view him more as a normal human who has slipped into a state of insanity, rather than a man who was merely masking the monster hidden deep within.The traps of ""Saw 3"" were just as I had initially felt, they were way too grotesque and seemed to be intended to shock and gross out the audience as much as possible rather than scare us. I don't understand why horror films have shifted from trying to scare the audience with atmosphere, story and a genuinely creepy villain, but instead have chosen to simply shock us by including as many gross sequences as possible into a 90 minute film, but that's what the powers-that-be must feel is needed to make a successful horror film these days. Maybe it's because we moviegoers have become de-sensitized to such things, that the only way the moviemakers feel they can scare us is by shocking us with as much blood, gore, and sadism as they can get away with under the guidelines of the increasingly liberal MPAA rating system.As a franchise, the 'Saw' series has definitely fallen into the school of thought within filmmaking that feels it is necessary to show the most gore possible to give the audience a good scare. When this franchise began, the original film was more of an actual horror film, in the vein of the old school horror films from Alfred Hitchcock (""Psycho"") and John Carpenter (""Halloween""), relying more on atmosphere and the audiences own imagination to create genuine thrills with which to scare us, not buckets and buckets of blood. However, over the course of three films, the 'Saw' series has become just another horror franchise, albeit with much better scripts than your average horror movie (which allows these films to rise above the rest of the current crop of horror offerings), but one can definitely see the downward spiral in terms of quality that is occurring within the series.The characters of ""Saw 3"" were much better than those within ""Saw 2"". This time around I actually cared whether the main characters survived their respective traps, unlike in ""Saw 2"" where I would have been fine if the majority of them failed their tests. The new cast members to the franchise fit into the same profile as those of the previous film. Both of the two new lead characters were portrayed by acting talents that many people would recognize if they'd seen them, but most likely not by their names. Bahar Soomekh (TV's short-lived drama ""Day Break"") was solid as Lynn, the doctor who had all but abandoned her family emotionally, but in the midst of Jigsaw's trial, discovers that she longs for nothing more than to hold her family members yet again. She was so genuine in her desire to do what is right according to the oath she took as a doctor by helping Jigsaw through the pain of his cancer, and at the same time she was so afraid of losing her life to the trap she was in that she was tempted to take a life in cold blood. The character of Jeff, the distraught father, as portrayed by Angus MacFadyen (""Braveheart"") was a character that was so consumed by his thirst for revenge that he teeters on the edge of sanity, and is struggling to retain his last shred of humanity so he can be there for his daughter that desperately wants her father back. Angus portrayed the conflict within Jeff perfectly, each of the trials that he faced tested his thirst for vengeance, while at the same time threatening to strip him of his last shred of humanity, and each time Angus played the indecision perfectly, and in the end gave audiences a character that was so deeply flawed, and yet the audience couldn't help but relate to him and his struggles.""Saw 3"" is a better movie than ""Saw 2"", and felt more in line with the tone and quality of the first movie. However, as improved as ""Saw 3"" was, it still fell prey to the shortcomings of its predecessor by featuring an over abundance of gross-out moments intended to shock the audience rather than scare it, and way too much blood and gore, to the point that it detracts from the overall movie.""Saw 3"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain violence, language, and nudity.",3,Some

1037844,A1E8ZHGZSMV3E0,B000LC3ICY,JustinK,"[0, 0]","I guess the most common question is, is Saw 3 better than the first two? I don't think there's a clear-cut answer to that. In some ways, I think the third film surpassed the first two. I thought it was more consistent and coherent in it's film-long development. I thought the suprise ending was done very well (for what it was). The movie presented a slightly more sophisticated set of ethical dilemmas this time.On the other hand, there were some areas where I felt the film was lacking compared to the first couple. First, the actual kills are starting to lose their effectiveness. There is still tension, gore, and innovation in the tortureous situations. But the emotional and cognitive impact is somewhat diminished, IMO. I think we've gotten to the point where the killings will continue to diminish in effectiveness, unless we are given some type of substantial back story for the character that lets us connect with them, and the kill is either very prolonged (to add gut-wrenching tension) or very quick (for a shocking effect).Another issue that I had with the film is that I found the reasoning of Jigsaw to be somewhat hypocritical. Jigsaw chided Amanda for her senseless killing, since her traps were unwinnable. This seems strange to me, in two ways. First, apparently it wasn't the actual loss of innocent lives that Jigsaw had a problem with, but just that Amanda's methods weren't the same as his. Murder is fine for Jigsaw, you just have to give the people a minute chance of survival. That's quite an ethical hair to split. Another problem I have with this is that Jigsaw allowed Amanda to set up the traps and kill the people just as a set up for a test. If Jigsaw was so against Amanda's methods, couldn't he have tested her while only making her *think* that her methods were being employed?In any event, whatever I feel the short comings to be, I'd still say that this was a good movie for anyone who enjoys the horror genre. It seems that some changes will take place in the next Saw, and I have to admit that they've gotten me curious about where they are planning to go.",4,Time For a Change?,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2096,"['guess', 'most', 'common', 'question', 'Saw', '3', 'better', 'first', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'clear-cut', 'answer', 'ways', 'think', 'third', 'film', 'surpassed', 'first', 'two', 'thought', 'was', 'more', 'consistent', 'coherent', 'film-long', 'development', 'thought', 'suprise', 'ending', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'movie', 'presented', 'slightly', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'set', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'other', 'hand', 'were', 'areas', 'where', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'lacking', 'compared', 'first', 'couple', 'First', 'actual', 'kills', 'are', 'starting', 'lose', 'effectiveness', 'still', 'tension', 'gore', 'innovation', 'tortureous', 'situations', 'emotional', 'cognitive', 'impact', 'somewhat', 'diminished', 'IMO', 'think', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'killings', 'will', 'continue', 'diminish', 'effectiveness', 'are', 'given', 'type', 'substantial', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'connect', 'kill', 'very', 'prolonged', 'add', 'gut-wrenching', 'tension', 'very', 'quick', 'shocking', 'effect', 'issue', 'had', 'film', 'found', 'reasoning', 'Jigsaw', 'be', 'somewhat', 'hypocritical', 'Jigsaw', 'chided', 'Amanda', 'senseless', 'killing', 'traps', 'were', 'unwinnable', 'strange', 'two', 'ways', 'First', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'actual', 'loss', 'innocent', 'lives', 'Jigsaw', 'had', 'problem', 'just', 'Amanda', 'methods', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'Murder', 'fine', 'Jigsaw', 'just', 'have', 'give', 'people', 'minute', 'chance', 'survival', 'quite', 'ethical', 'hair', 'split', 'problem', 'have', 'Jigsaw', 'allowed', 'Amanda', 'set', 'up', 'traps', 'kill', 'people', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'test', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'so', 'Amanda', 'methods', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'tested', 'only', 'making', '*think*', 'methods', 'were', 'being', 'employed', 'event', 'feel', 'short', 'comings', 'be', ""'d"", 'still', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'genre', 'changes', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'next', 'Saw', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'curious', 'where', 'are', 'planning', 'go']",N/A

The directing by Darren Lynn Bousman (who directed and wrote the screenplay to the last ""Saw"" movie) is excellent. The screenplay by Leigh Whannell (who wrote the screenplay and story to the first two movies and was an executive producer on this one and the last ""Saw"" movie, who also played Adam in the first ""Saw"" and has an important role in this one, and wrote the story and screenplay with Wan on the upcoming ""Dead Silence"" (2007) & is in the upcoming ""Death Sentence"" (2007), which also directed by Wan) is excellent! The story by Whannell & James Wan (who directed the first one and was an executive producer on this one and the last ""Saw"" movie and wrote the story and screenplay with Whannell on the upcoming ""Dead Silence"" & is directing the upcoming ""Death Sentence"", which also stars Whannell) is excellent! The music by Charlie Clouser (who also did the music to the first two ""Saw"" movies) is excellent, as usual. The cinematography by David A.

The film editing by Kevin Greutert (who also did the film editing to the first two ""Saw"" movies) is excellent! The casting by Stephanie Gorin (who also did the casting to ""Saw II"" (2005) is excellent! The production design by David Hackl (who also did the production design to ""Saw II"") is excellent! The art direction by Anthony A. Ianni is excellent! The costume design by Alex Kavanagh (who also did the costume design to ""Saw II"") is excellent! This is an impressive third sequel to a movie trilogy. This is just as inventive or even more inventive than the original ""Saw"" (2004) was, or is and it is surpasses its sequel and even its original by making the movie a little more character driven!

If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. First of all, I wasn't crazy about the first ""Saw"", but ""Saw 2"" was really good, and most importantly for me the 2 tied in together. I hate it when they make a sequel and it has absolutely nothing to do with the first film. Not to say that this movie has nothing to do with the first 2 films, I'm just merely stating that I hate when they make movies like that in general. Anyway, deep down inside I knew this would stink, I guess I was just curious, and I had a little extra cash to splurge. Anyone who is familiar with the ""Saw"" movies know that you can expect a huge twist at the end. However, in this film, the end is where it fell flat. I guess if you like endings where everybody dies, and nothing is solved, then you'll like this. I felt like it was sort of cliffhangerish (if that's even a word). I don't see how there can be another sequel, but we all know they'll find a way even if it's a copycat to carry on the Jigsaw's work. At any rate, I think another sequel is pretty much a guarantee. This movie is just meaningless gore and unecessary violence with a horrible ending that managed to destroy the first 2 movies for me. American filmakers need to understand that you can't rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace  the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some of the concepts though. I do think it was pretty sick to do brain sugery on someone with power tools while their still awake. That was a good scene for me, but that's about it.

If he dies, she dies as well.  Meanwhile, a man has been kidnapped and is going through a game.  This man lost a son to a drunk driver and has since been obsessed with vengenance.  In this tailored game, he has to decide whether to forgive certain people or let them die in their own games.As I said before, Jigsaw is dying.  Amanda is emotionally unstable.

This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition). Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving. This lesson I believe. The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption. This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui). Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker. Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them. Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out. If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve. Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet. Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.Some might not be interested in questions like these, though. Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam. Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation. The first movie was both inventive and focused. The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets. This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight. Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.",4,A Bloody Good Time,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,2839,"['hard', 'believe', 'watching', 'third', 'installment', 'uber-gory', 'Saw', 'series', 'fourth', 'making', 'not', 'movies', 'are', 'running', 'ideas', 'twists', 'expected', 'still', 'have', 'creative', 'bite', 'are', 'lacking', 'certain', 'gruesome', 'appeal', 'films', 'have', 'faithful', 'fan', 'base', 'made', 'movies', 'Halloween', 'tradition', 'Instead', 'makers', 'third', 'flick', 'last', 'frame', 'appear', 'have', 'painted', 'corner', 'bucket', 'pig', 'guts', 'brain', 'juice.But', 'one', 'thing', 'Saw', 'movies', 'have', 'teach', 'go', 'way', 'pretend', 'have', 'lot', 'teaching', 'do', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'lesson', 'believe', 'rest', 'Saw', 'lecturing', 'well', 'hard', 'listen', 'sermon', 'when', 'pastor', 'ripping', 'arm', 'off.All', 'usual', 'suspects', 'are', 'back', 'time', 'around', 'Jigsaw', 'pale-as-rainwater', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'accomplice', 'Amanda', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'providing', 'yet', 'meticulously', 'macabre', 'experiment', 'death', 'personal', 'redemption', 'time', 'primary', 'subjects', 'are', 'Jeff', 'man', 'subsumed', 'grief', 'son', 'Dylan', 'killed', 'hit-and-run', 'driver', 'Lynn', 'ER', 'doctor', 'who', 'addicted', 'pain', 'killers', 'own', 'ennui', 'Jeff', 'given', 'opportunity', 'series', 'tests', 'watch', 'responsible', 'son', 'demise', 'witness', 'judge', 'driver', 'meet', 'maker', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'Jeff', 'can', 'save', 'Lynn', 'meanwhile', 'much', 'easier', 'task', 'keep', 'dying', 'Jigsaw', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'last', 'game', 'play', 'out', 'Jigsaw', 'heart', 'beating', 'so', 'hers.How', 'Jeff', 'Lynn', 'are', 'connected', 'anyone', 'guess', 'first', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'right', 'usual', 'film', 'still', 'few', 'bloody', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Shot', 'line-up', 'primary', 'colors', 'scene', 'own', 'color', 'schema', 'grittily', 'textured', 'most', 'visceral', 'Saw', 'yet', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'trade', 'too', 'much', 'brains', 'blood', 'just', 'second', 'film', 'capitalized', 'elements', 'first', 'third', 'bases', 'watch', 'close', 'enough', 'fact', 'set', 'up', 'few', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'fourth.Some', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'questions', 'though', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'really', 'lost', 'edge', 'appear', 'be', 'losing', 'steam', 'Saw', 'staged', 'way', 'morality', 'play', 'people', 'trapped', 'own', 'brand', 'sick', 'salvation', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'inventive', 'focused', 'second', 'widened', 'aim', 'such', 'missed', 'few', 'targets', 'third', 'film', 'ever-more-intricate', 'web', 'wicked', 'wisdom', 'almost', 'own', 'weight', 'Here', 'hoping', 'next', 'Saw', 'tries', 'cut', 'out', 'Deeper', 'Message', 'chainsaw', 'instead', 'finely-edged', 'scalpel']",N/A

Depending on what you thought of Saw, Saw II looks to be about as demented, and makes about as much sense as Saw.The film opens with another hapless fool waking up in another music-video-leftover room with another insane device attached to his head.  The serial killer Jigsaw (who has never killed anyone) informs him via video that he has about a minute to cut out his eyeball to retrieve a key to unlock the venus-flytrap device on his head.  Argh!  From there we are introduced to a weary cop with family troubles who is being personally called out by Jigsaw.  Before long, we find out that Jigsaw has kidnapped his son, along with a bunch of other idiots and placed them in a booby trapped house with poison gas being pumped through the vents and a time limit for them to endure sick, twisted, horror-movie-traps and tests in order to prove how badly they want to live.Don't think too closely about this one, as by the end it makes even less sense than the twist of the original.  And yes, there is a twist of sorts.  The movie looks like the original, meaning it looks like a Nine Inch Nails video and has all the editing of the ADD school of filmmaking which is now apparently a pre-req for making at least 50% of movies.  The ridiculous editing is getting out of hand now---why do they feel the need to TELL you visually that it's time to get tense, or scared?  Are the filmmakers too uneasy about the material and their ability to just rely on the situation, the script, the actors?  Do I need to see crack head editing and lights and that over-produced dirt and grime in every movie in order to feel anything?These movies are not scary in the least, masking a lack of imagination in the horror/fear department, but plenty of imagination in the 'how else can they die' department.  Cruelty and tastelessness are the new horror genre checkpoints, I guess it's a lot easier than creating genuine scares or fear.  How about babies in a blender, that'd be a good horror flick.  These films can be demented fun for 90 minutes and can be a lot of fun in a crowded movie theater, but they're overdone and over-stylized.  The visuals don't show you as much as tell you (with the same lighting, editing, colors) that this is a horror film.  The moral 'message' of the killer, or the writers, is perhaps the real reason this is a horror film.Plenty of extras about the making of the film and the traps, all the work that goes into this madness, new ways to torture and kill people, and other wonders.  It's always nice to see that artistic, creative people can make a living designing torture contraptions for fictitious serial killers (fictitious today, that is), and that those serial killers become 'beloved' characters to American audiences.  There's a 2 DVD set out there as well, though this single disc unrated widescreen edition should suffice for most folks.  I would bet the house that Saw becomes a video game or a series of them, the possibilities for interactive sadism are too much for them not to hybridize Saw.Followed by Saw III.  And IV.

I really enjoyed the first Saw - while it does have its flaws, I still think it was a refreshing film in comparison to the other horror movies that were coming out at the time. With that said, if you didn't enjoy the first Saw, you're not going to enjoy Saw 3 so don't bother.Saw 3 picks up immediately after Saw II and while it is a horror movie so we're not talking about The Brothers Karamazov in terms of plot and character development, the viewer will enjoy Saw 3 more if the two previous films have been seen.Ultimately it seems that the Saw movies come down to the traps and the twist ending. It seemed like the second Saw was all traps and the twist ending wasn't that surprising (some would say a cliche). Saw 3 has some very good traps but there's also some that seem unrealistic or shot poorly. Overall, they were okay - some definite moments that will stay with you but others that were just silly. As for the twist ending, I didn't get on board. It just seemed like the producers were so desperate to outdo themselves that they brainstormed all the possible twists they could come up with and threw them all in.But even with those criticisms, I still had a good time with the film.

The bad news is that James Wan only returned to do some of the script work for Saw III. Wan, who also directed the first film, created one of the enduring horror movies of the decade so far; Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed the second film in the franchise, turned in what was, at best, just another cheesy survival thriller that lacked any echo of the characterization, complexity, and finesse that made the first one so good. Guess who directs Saw III?I'm sure you've seen at least one sitcom episode where there's a loose frame story that exists for the sole purpose of replaying amusing scenes from earlier in the season. That's, in part, the direction Saw III takes-- there's a lot of flashback footage in this movie. Which is really kind of depressing, because Wan came up with a real barnburner of a story idea here-- Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, reprising his role) and his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith, reprising hers) are the focus here. They've kidnapped Lynn (Crash's Bahar Soomekh), a doctor with marital problems, to keep Jigsaw alive during his final game, one in which Jeff (Titus' Angus McFadyen) must forgive the driver who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident, as well as a number of others who, directly or indirectly, contributed to his son's death. Jeff's game, however, is almost a background here, as the focus remains on Lynn, Amanda, and Jigsaw. And, of course, there's an awesome twist ending (with the most blatant ""if you're not paying attention, you'll miss it"" clue since Profondo Rosso) that leads us straight into Saw IV. And had Wan's idea been perfectly translated, I have no doubt this would have been an excellent movie, easily the equal of the first one.""Perfectly translated,"" however, it is not. It has once again gone through the blender that is Leigh Whannell, but again without Wan's butt in the director's chair mitigating Whannell's inability to characterize. We see an even worse flaw of Whannell's in the opening scenes of Saw III: Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Donnie Wahlberg's characters, all of whom survived Saw II, appear in the movie's opening scenes and are eliminated for no reason. (Well, there's a reason, but it's a desperately flimsy one that's obviously the thinnest of layers over ""hey, we have cool devices and nowhere else in the movie to use them."") While the movie's better than its predecessor, ""better"" is something of a relative term. It's certainly not the equal of the first film, but it doesn't quite have the ""let's trample all over the legacy of the first film"" feel to it that the second one does.

As seen in the previous 2 movies, it's full of twists, turns, and reveals even more of the story of the first 2 movies without ever losing your attention. It even recalls small characters from the first movie and makes them the main characters! Particularly the girl who worked with Dr. Gordon from the first movie. We get more into her character, who goes by Dr. Lynn in the movie, finding out she has a destructive family consisting of a husband and a daughter. However, the reason they're so out of hand is because they've been emotionally scarred ever since their young son died from getting hit by a taxi driver. She is caught and Amanda (Jigsaw's apprentice) forces her to help Jigsaw's health problems because he has a severe brain tumor, all the while her husband, Jeff, is having to go through a ""maze"" to find out who killed his son.However, as other reviewers have stated, the movie focuses more on Amanda than anyone else. Hey, like Jigsaw said, ""Your life is in the hands of Dr. Lynn."" It turns out, Jigsaw was never through testing her, ever since he saved her from her drug addiction. Unfortunately, she failed. Well, there's a LOT more than that in the movie, but I don't want to give too much away.Saw 3 is easily my favorite movie of the series. The storyline is very interesting, the gore is top notch and very realistic, the torture devices are fascinating, it shows what big role Amanda actually has in all of Jigsaw's games, and there's even a level of emotion in it; mainly because we realize that only Amanda understood Jigsaw, and vice-versa. So if you're a fan of the Saw series, go to your local theater and watch it NOW. It's the best one in the series yet, and is my personal choice for best horror movie, and maybe movie, of the year.",5,Morbidly brilliant.,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1907,"['Having', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'hour', 'think', 'can', 'say', 'Saw', '3', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'year', 'seen', 'previous', '2', 'movies', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'reveals', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'ever', 'losing', 'attention', 'even', 'small', 'characters', 'first', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'Particularly', 'girl', 'who', 'worked', 'Dr.', 'Gordon', 'first', 'movie', 'get', 'more', 'character', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Lynn', 'movie', 'finding', 'out', 'destructive', 'family', 'consisting', 'husband', 'daughter', 'However', 'reason', ""'re"", 'so', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'been', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'ever', 'young', 'son', 'died', 'getting', 'hit', 'taxi', 'driver', 'caught', 'Amanda', 'Jigsaw', 'apprentice', 'help', 'Jigsaw', 'health', 'problems', 'severe', 'brain', 'tumor', 'husband', 'Jeff', 'having', 'go', 'maze', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'son.However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'movie', 'more', 'Amanda', 'anyone', 'else', 'Hey', 'Jigsaw', 'said', 'life', 'hands', 'Dr', 'Lynn', 'out', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'never', 'testing', 'ever', 'saved', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Unfortunately', 'failed', 'Well', 'LOT', 'more', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', '3', 'easily', 'favorite', 'movie', 'series', 'storyline', 'very', 'interesting', 'gore', 'top', 'notch', 'very', 'realistic', 'torture', 'devices', 'are', 'fascinating', 'what', 'big', 'role', 'Amanda', 'actually', 'Jigsaw', 'games', 'even', 'level', 'emotion', 'mainly', 'realize', 'only', 'Amanda', 'understood', 'Jigsaw', 'vice-versa', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Saw', 'series', 'go', 'local', 'theater', 'watch', 'NOW', 'best', 'one', 'series', 'yet', 'personal', 'choice', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'maybe', 'movie', 'year']",N/A
1037888,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B000LC3ICY,SteakSalad101,"[4, 4]","I am not usually attracted to this type of film...slasher/horror flicks, that is. I find most of them a waste of money and time, to be honest. This is why I was genuinely shocked at how I truly loved the first two ""Saw"" films, realizing they exercised absolutely brilliant examples of film-making, acting, and special effects. Both films had a genuinely awesome screenplay with well-written, realistically portrayed dialogue...and of course, forgetting the almost-too-intense amounts of suspense both films lavished upon its viewers would be criminal. Some of the scenes in those films brought on the nail-biting suspense I hadn't felt since Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" I remember being sick with jealousy after watching the first film that novice filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell could create such a brilliant, intricate, breathtaking horror film that had just the right amounts of blood & guts mixed with a truckload of otherworldly suspense. I remember after watching the second film that Darren Lynn Bousman seriously has got a future on his hands with an exquisitely directed ""Saw II."" So, naturally, I felt more than compelled to view the third installation of the ""Saw"" franchise before the fourth film hit theaters. Described as ""staggeringly violent"" and ""sadistically horrific,"" along with the true incidents of audience members vomiting and fainting in the theater, I felt less and less excited about the third Saw film, and began thinking it was nothing more than a Halloween horror film face-off between Saw III and Hostel to see which film could possibly be more sickeningly violent. In addition, I began to think ""How could a third film possibly live up to the caliber of the first two?"" After viewing the third film, I really wasn't sure what to think of the theory of the film being violent just to be violent. But here's what I generally thought of the third installation to the brilliant ""Saw"" franchise. The interlocking two-part story deals with a fatally ill Jigsaw capturing a doctor who must keep him alive for however long it takes for a man, who is psychologically insane with his lust for revenge for the drunk driver who killed his son, to maneuver through a series of Jigsaw's infamous ""traps."" Jeff, the man, is not actually in the traps, though--it's the people who he's been vengeful towards regarding the death of his son--for instance, the judge who locked away the killer for only a short period of time, and witnesses who didn't do anything. Jeff has the power to stop these traps--find it within himself to forgive them. Either that, or watch them get slaughtered in ways too shocking to write about in this review.That said, Saw III is definitely a step up when it comes to the gore meter compared to the first two films. Some of the traps are so sickening you feel compelled to turn away from the screen. People vomiting in theaters, though, is a gross overreaction. I ate pizza while watching and I wasn't really nauseated or anything. Don't let that fool you, though--Saw III is extremely violent and the violence in the first two films is pale compared to it. There are plenty of moments where I cringed and thought to myself, ""Holy crap, that's just wrong."" While a part of me wants to condemn the film for being so excruciatingly violent, I can't help but think the violence was a necessary aspect to the story. You'd really have to see the film to know what I'm talking about here, but anyway, Saw III might've competed with Hostel for ""most violent award"" but the gore wasn't extremely over-the-top or too intense to watch.Which brings me into my next point--the storyline. As I said in the first paragraph, the story lines for the first two film blew me out of the damn water with their brilliance. This is where the third film declines--and steeply, at that. The development of new characters is handled extremely poorly and in the end, you really don't give a flying crap who dies and who is left living (extremely unlike the second film). The acting is both up and down at different times. Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are absolutely top notch, as always. Smith's performance, especially towards the end of the film, sent chills down my spine and Bell never fails to disappoint. Yet, literally every single other actor/actress in the film didn't deliver, and that for me was major point loss.I liked the directing, editing, and cinematography. Especially the cinematography, which reminded me immensely of the 2004 Denzel Washington action flick ""Man On Fire,"" also dealing with the human spirit's lust for revenge at the loss of another. Fortunately, Darren Lynn Bousman's above-average skills as a film director manage to balance a close-to-falling Saw III and keep it shakily on its feet. Again, I blame this on the weak story. Yet, it is hardly fair for me to completely condemn the story. The screenwriters did a very good job incorporating flashbacks into the film, and explaining elements from the first two films that may have been considered plot holes in the past. This aspect to Saw 3 was immensely enjoyable and made for a good film.Though, the ending was also very poor, in my opinion. It is very depressing, unhealthy, and unsatisfying like a Big Mac. You almost feel at a complete loss--the events building up from the beginning of the film (and, for that matter, the other two films as well) end up--like this? Bleh. Been there, done that. There also is no shocker at the end, unlike the first two films which each had shockers that pretty much blew the brains out of your ears and left you speechless and unable to move.Still, though, Saw 3 is a decent film. But it should be understood that unless you are EXTREME fans of the first two films, as I am, you should stay away from this movie. You'll be revolted and disappointed, to say the least. But for hardcore Saw fans, it should be rather pleasing. I don't think ""Saw 3"" was a great film, But it certainly is decent and I've seen FAR worse. I have hopes for the fourth film that it may redeem the third film and restore the hopes of me and a million others that a great movie--turned into just a decent one--can be brought back to greatness.3-Stars",3,Steps down from the originals but still an enjoyable watch,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,6190,"['am', 'not', 'usually', 'attracted', 'type', 'film', 'slasher/horror', 'flicks',

1037889,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000LC3ICY,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","With Jigsaw debilitated and near death, it falls to his new protege to carry on the infamous 'games' in ""Saw III"", the most recent entry in one of the 2000s's best ongoing series.  Knowing nothing of any apprentice, the detectives who've been pursuing the Jigsaw killer since the first chapter in the series are mystified by the continuing killings.""Saw III"" ties elements from its two predecessors in with new ideas and a new direction expertly, creating a movie that enhances both of the films that came before it (which were already excellent).  The ongoing story has become deeper and more multi-faceted while losing nothing of the horror and tension that initially catapulted the concept to greatness.  The new protege abducts a doctor whose own life now depends on her ability to keep Jigsaw alive long enough to see the outcome of the latest, most complex - and most psychologically interesting - of the deathtrap-oriented games.  The character of Jigsaw is explored more deeply in this one - for the first time it feels like his rationale of 'teaching the value of being alive' by bringing the victims who survive so close to death, may actually be something more than a contrived excuse for a psychopath to reign in terror and pain.  For the first time the character, despite the depravity of his actions throughout the series, comes off as being possibly something other than nothing but plain evil, comes off as a twisted but mentally complex individual who may somehow believe his own words, and that his games - in his own warped psyche - have more to them than gratuitous sadism.  He even appears capable of sympathizing with his victims.  This is not a plot roundabout to just take a villain who became immensely popular and 'turn him good', it's part of an an ongoing evolution of what's being revealed about the characters (as of this entry there are now a fair number who have appeared in two or more of the movies).  The characterization of Jigsaw's apprentice is also very developed here, but harder to reference directly without risking spoilers; and the doctor - who despite her dangerous situation seems consumed more by a desire to save her patient regardless of who or what he is - is an excellent addition to the roster of players.  And as for the infamous games themselves, nothing of the shock, nothing of the savagery, nothing of the intensity has been sacrificed to make room for expanded insight into the characters.  Indeed, the twists and revelations - and questions - spinning out of this latest round of the games may be the most gripping of the trilogy.""Saw III"" just might be the best of the saga to date; one of 2006's most indispensable horror movies.",5,Cutting Even Deeper.....,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2690,"['Jigsaw', 'debilitated', 'death', 'new', 'protege', 'carry', 'infamous', ""'games"", 'Saw', 'III', 'most', 'recent', 'entry', 'one', '2000s', 'best', 'ongoing', 'series', 'Knowing', 'nothing', 'apprentice', 'detectives', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pursuing', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'first', 'chapter', 'series', 'are', 'mystified', 'continuing', 'killings', 'Saw', 'III', 'ties', 'two', 'predecessors', 'new', 'ideas', 'new', 'direction', 'expertly', 'creating', 'movie', 'films', 'came', 'were', 'already', 'excellent', 'ongoing', 'story', 'become', 'deeper', 'more', 'multi-faceted', 'losing', 'nothing', 'horror', 'tension', 'initially', 'catapulted', 'concept', 'greatness', 'new', 'protege', 'doctor', 'own', 'life', 'now', 'ability', 'keep', 'Jigsaw', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'see', 'outcome', 'latest', 'most', 'complex', 'most', 'psychologically', 'interesting', 'deathtrap-oriented', 'games', 'character', 'Jigsaw', 'explored', 'more', 'deeply', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'rationale', ""'teaching"", 'value', 'being', 'alive', 'bringing', 'victims', 'who', 'survive', 'so', 'close', 'death', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'contrived', 'excuse', 'psychopath', 'reign', 'terror', 'pain', 'first', 'time', 'character', 'depravity', 'actions', 'series', 'off', 'being', 'possibly', 'something', 'other', 'nothing', 'plain', 'evil', 'off', 'twisted', 'mentally', 'complex', 'individual', 'who', 'may', 'somehow', 'believe', 'own', 'words', 'games', 'own', 'warped', 'psyche', 'have', 'more', 'gratuitous', 'sadism', 'even', 'capable', 'sympathizing', 'victims', 'not', 'plot', 'roundabout', 'just', 'take', 'villain', 'who', 'became', 'immensely', 'popular', 'good', 'part', 'ongoing', 'evolution', 'what', 'being', 'revealed', 'characters', 'entry', 'are', 'now', 'fair', 'number', 'who', 'have', 'appeared', 'two', 'more', 'movies', 'characterization', 'Jigsaw', 'apprentice', 'also', 'very', 'developed', 'here', 'harder', 'reference', 'directly', 'risking', 'spoilers', 'doctor', 'who', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'consumed', 'more', 'desire', 'save', 'patient', 'regardless', 'who', 'what', 'excellent', 'addition', 'roster', 'players', 'infamous', 'games', 'nothing', 'shock', 'nothing', 'savagery', 'nothing', 'intensity', 'been', 'sacrificed', 'make', 'room', 'expanded', 'insight', 'characters', 'Indeed', 'twists', 'revelations', 'questions', 'spinning', 'latest', 'round', 'games', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'gripping', 'trilogy', 'Saw', 'III', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'saga', 'date', 'one', '2006', 'most', 'indispensable', 'horror', 'movies']",N/A

1037896,A1C139F5C7Y38P,B000LC3ICY,"The Matrix Fan ""Video Gamer since 1979.""","[4, 4]","To start, let's review the film itself.The Jigsaw Killer is back, and he's got new test subjects to toy with. With the help of Amanda, his new apprentice, she sets the stage for their two unwilling participants in his twisted game: Dr. Lynn Denlon and Jeff Reinhart. Before the night is over, one will have the chance at life, another will have a chance at revenge, and another will have the chance for redemption. There's not much else I can say without spoiling the plot, and since this review is geared towards why this 2-disc DVD treatment is superior to the previous versions, let's move on.Saw III has more plot twists than you can shake a broken arm at, and this film doesn't have too many characters to bog down the action as in the previous film. With a running time of 120 minutes, the Director's Cut of Saw III has more gore and violence than the last two treatments. If you think the directors have run out of trap ideas, believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of moments that caused seasoned horror movie fanatics to cringe and wince at the tortures unfolding before them on the silver screen. If you have already been introduced to the 'Saw' universe, Saw III is required viewing.As for the DVD treatment of the movie, it's common knowledge these days that the first version of a DVD release is typically not the one with the best features, or the most complete version of the film. The most complete version comes later. The best example I can think of is theBlade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)- I had to wait 25 years for that.Thankfully, Saw III got the best DVD version (so far) within a year.When you open the DVD, you're treated to a certificate allowing you to see Saw IV in the theaters for free. However, the ticket was only good until November 10th of 2007. Even if you buy this DVD after that time, the certificate makes a nice collectable for Saw fans.When you put in the first disc, you have to wade through 5 movie advertisements before getting to the main menu.At the main menu, there is an endless one minute loop of ""Killer Inside-Messed Up World"" playing in the background. It's my belief that DVD menus shouldn't have music playing, and this is a perfect example: The song is WAY too loud. I'm sure it was put there to direct viewers to the music video on the second disc - but it's simply an annoyance.Some of the features on the first disc include:-- Audio commentary by Leigh Whannell, the co-creator of SAW.-- Audio commentary by Director Darren Lynn Bousman-- Audio commentary by Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) and Shawnee Smith (Amanda)There's one choice in the special features section for ""D-Box, Mastering Motion"" - this is a shameless promotion for a company that offers a new way of experiencing motion in movies with special chairs/helmets/etc.On the second disc, there's a mixed bag of special features.First, we start with ""Jigsaw's Plan"", a trivia game that tests your knowledge of the three Saw films to date. However, the questions are not randomized and if you get one question wrong, you have to start all over; making the replay value of this feature almost non-existent.Nest, we have ""Choose the Death"" which allows us to view the scenes of 10 Saw traps from Saw 2 and Saw 3 with commentary from the director. Not a bad feature.The next feature is ""Looking Tortured"" - I'm not sure who came up with this idea, but it was a pleasant little surprise. 4 people are chosen to have makeup applied to emulate their 'Saw' counterparts. The viewer is shown from start to finish how to create & apply the makeup to look like the perfect Saw victim. Anyone who wants to spend $25 on a Halloween costume can watch this and make a better one themselves.Hydrovibe offers us a music video of ""Killer Inside-Messed Up World"" with Shawnee Smith offering additional vocals. This video wasn't bad, but it felt like it was tacked on at the last minute. You'll probably find yourself saying ""Hey, isn't this that annoying song playing in the background on the first disc?""""Filmmaker Faves"": This feature is totally unnecessary. Do you lay awake at night wondering about Leigh Whannell's favorite line/scene/trap of the Saw series? This is good for trivia night, but it's really not needed. Plus, the font of the lettering is hard to read here.The last feature is a ""Sneak Peek at Saw IV"". This scene is mainly to wet the appetites of those folks eagerly awaiting the next Saw movie to come out on DVD, and they will not be disappointed.The first batch of SAW III DVD's were out in January of 2007, The ""Unrated Edition"" and the standard edition. Both of these DVD's had features that did not make it to this version, such as some deleted scenes, commentaries, and trailers.If you are looking for the longest running, most complete version of Saw

1037899,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000LC3ICY,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 2]","You know how trilogies that are based on one idea tend to lose their edge? Welcome to ""Saw III."" It is not as tense as the second (and best in this franchise), nor does it have the benefit of the surprise shock of the first (a movie I found to be enjoyable but grossly over-rated). Where ""Saw 2"" had the benefit of multiple characters playing cat and mouse in a single venue, ""Saw III"" pits Jigsaw and his protege Amanda against a Doctor and a man consumed by guilt. In other words, you have to care about how these four people play against each other in order to get caught up in the movie. A drawback to the original ""Saw"" was the fact that the acting was so hammily bad that I spent more time wondering about the film's many plotholes and continuity issues (climbing from a bathtub and not being wet?) than caring about the fates of the characters...and that happens here to a lesser degree.But I am sure that most of the viewers to ""Saw III"" could give a rat's beak about such mundane things as plot. It's the gruesomely inventive tortures that matter here, and ""Saw III"" really delivers on the gore and gross points. As Jeff (Angus McFayden) tries to negotiate his way out of one of Jigsaw's death mazes, he is forced to confront his own rage and guilt over the loss of his son to a drunk driver. Instead of being the one in eminent danger of death, he must save those he feels responsible for the leniency shown the killer of the boy. And each of these victims is tortured in variously cinematic disgusting manners. (The pig-guts trap on the judge offers a minor funny subtext.)Meanwhile, Jigsaw (played with subtle malevolence by Tobin Bell) is playing mind games with the doctor he has kidnapped into performing surgery on his cancer ridden brain and his assistant Amanda's slippery grasp on sanity. The gross-out factor here is Really High...I found myself cringing more in these surgical segments than during the those involving the death-traps. In an effort to shore up the motivational factors, ""Saw III"" lays on the flashbacks. You discover more of what brought Amanda under Jigsaw's spell, how the fates of the victims in one and two wrapped up (writer director Leigh Whannel shows up in that bathroom again, Donnie Wahlberg does as well) and the setups for the games of the prior flicks get explained, more or less.Which is dead weight, frankly. The first two ""Saw"" movies came in at under two hours, working at a relentless pace (especially ""Saw 2""). Logging two hours and change drags the suspense out and made me wonder why I was being shown the back stories when I really wanted to see just how cinematically the next kill would be rendered. After all, the ""Saw"" franchise is a horror show with pain and suffering the real lead actors in a twisted morality play. The twist involving the four leads - and the fact that Jeff is forced to save the victims and not kill them in his Jigsaw game - is the biggest difference and greatest strength in ""Saw III."" But otherwise, there are segments of the movie that are as bloated as the hog carcasses being fed into the film's abattoir scene.",3,Suffering?

Usually ""patients"" of John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer can escape the games; this time the trap is unusual which brings questions about the inventor of this trap. Saw III is basically a large and complicated game much like the first movie. Jigsaw is dying and Amanda brings in Doctor Lynn Denlon who has to keep him alive for the game's length in order to succeed her game. Meanwhile her husband Jeff is the one playing the ""real"" game which will decide of everyone's fate. This one is also Amanda's big test even if she doesn't know it. The fact that Saw III is so complex, logical and that it makes sense at the same is quite an accomplishment for a horror movie as they rather ignore connectivity from a movie to another, Saw does not. It's obvious that with this third movie they tried to end the trilogy while knowing that there might be a next movie, they could have ended Saw right there if they wanted to. It is the most profitable Saw movie to date having earned an estimated total of $164,874,275 worldwide.I feel this is one of the better Saw movies, first of all it has a great story and its complicated which I think is what fans will love about it.

The weird part for me about this series is I don't like movies with torture-but this series has a demented cleverness to it that I didn't expect. The traps are sadistic but clever, the music is creepy, and Jigsaw's game in this one is something I admire-testing someone's capacity for forgiveness over revenge is a very interesting concept. When criminals go free it does make me angry, but hatred and revenge can have serious consequences, as this chapter demonstrates in gruesome detail. Kudos to Charles Clouser for the music score-I'm not sure even Jerry Goldsmith could've made a score this creepy. Special mention must be made to Tobin Bell as Jigsaw-what he does with his voice, making it raspy to the sound of a whisper was eerily effective,he gives me chills just hearing him talk, and his voice on his tapes are the same way. I'm not gonna lie though, a couple scenes/traps in this one did make me cringe, I look forward to part 5 though.August 8, 2010The main focus of this film is on Jigsaw's apprentice forcing a doctor to keep him alive while another test/game is taking place. These tests and traps are creepy to say the least-esp. the pig vat in the middle. I don't want the director's cut of this chapter because I saw the d's cut of the ending and decided I don't need it.Now, do I think they should've ended the series here? Hell, No! Despite the ending, I'm glad the creators have come up with not just one but 5 decent sequels that connect like a puzzle. After this film though, Leigh Whannell and James Wan stepped aside as scriptwriters, but the replacements so far have done a very nice job in keeping the series interesting, however I wish Darren Lynn Bousman could've continued directing, but oh well.",4,forgiveness or revenge?

1037907,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000LC3ICY,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 5]","""SAW III"" or the entire ""SAW"" franchise for that matter has already been known as one of the goriest horror/suspense series (except, probably ""Hostel"" and some of Miike's films), so I expected what I would see from the beginning. Frankly I didn't care the amount of blood or violence, but when the story seems to be repeating itself, there must be a problem. Actually some part of ""SAW III"" is only repeating what we already know in the previous two films (though it is told from a different perspective with flashbacks).But what is most disappointing for me is that in ""SAW III"" the intriguing relations between Jigsaw and one character (you know who) are not fully developed. The filmmakers, it seems, spent most of energy to set up various methods of tortures, which is fine, I admit, but they could have created something more interesting out of the master-pupil-like relations between them with more subdued approach and less swearing.I also find the film shows its hand too early. During the film's story, we only wait for the next ""challenge"" to start and the results are now fairly predictable. (Remember the first ""SAW"" of which script showed some intelligence even in the gory trap scenes). And if Jigsaw is terminally ill, how did he manage to set up such elaborated torture machines?The only scene I was interested is the brief moment where Jigsaw's past is suggested. After all it is him and his eccentric personality that has made ""SAW"" a cut above other slasher films. Let's see what happens next in the forthcoming fourth installment because considering how ""SAW III"" wraps up, to continue the plot after that would be the hardest part of the entire series.",2,Weakest of the Series,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,1673,"['SAW', 'III', 'entire', 'SAW', 'franchise', 'matter', 'already', 'been', 'known', 'one', 'goriest', 'horror/suspense', 'series', 'probably', 'Hostel', 'Miike', 'films', 'so', 'expected', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'beginning', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'amount', 'blood', 'violence', 'when', 'story', 'be', 'repeating', 'must', 'be', 'problem', 'Actually', 'part', 'SAW', 'III', 'only', 'repeating', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'told', 'different', 'perspective', 'flashbacks', '.But', 'what', 'most', 'disappointing', 'SAW', 'III', 'intriguing', 'relations', 'Jigsaw', 'one', 'character', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'filmmakers', 'spent', 'most', 'energy', 'set', 'up', 'various', 'methods', 'tortures', 'fine', 'admit', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'master-pupil-like', 'relations', 'more', 'subdued', 'approach', 'less', 'swearing.I', 'also', 'find', 'film', 'hand', 'too', 'early', 'film', 'story', 'only', 'wait', 'next', 'challenge', 'start', 'results', 'are', 'now', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'Remember', 'first', 'SAW', 'script', 'showed', 'intelligence', 'even', 'gory', 'trap', 'scenes', 'Jigsaw', 'terminally', 'ill', 'how', 'did', 'manage', 'set', 'up', 'such', 'elaborated', 'torture', 'machines', 'only', 'scene', 'was', 'interested', 'brief', 'moment', 'where', 'Jigsaw', 'past', 'suggested', 'eccentric', 'personality', 'made', 'SAW', 'cut', 'other', 'slasher', 'films', 'Let', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'forthcoming', 'fourth', 'installment', 'considering', 'how', 'SAW', 'III', 'up', 'continue', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'hardest', 'part', 'entire', 'series']",N/A

1037909,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B000LC3ICY,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[4, 4]","The original ""Saw"" was everything a horror film should be.  It had gore both implied and explicit, twists and turns in the plot, and characters that the audience didn't particularly want to see die.  Then came along Saw II, which ramped up the gore factor considerably, and while it had its moments, it was obviously only there to make money off of the success of the original.  Now the horror genre has been graced with the third offering in the series, which is firmly in Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street territory.  The series is now officially a parody of itself, and its continued existence is only assured as long as it remains a cash cow (which it will).The main problem with Saw III is that Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda are no longer believable villains.  They exude no sense of terror or aura of fear, as they are creatures that simply could not exist in reality.  Jigsaw has essentially become the God of the universe.  He knows every minute detail of every person's life.  He knows where everyone sleeps, how they take their coffee, how long it takes them to drive to work, when the best time to break into their house to plant cameras would be, how their relationships with their spouses and children are, what color underwear they buy, etc.  Both Jigsaw and Amanda are also expert locksmiths, pharmacists, and engineers.  With no funds at all, they can craft any torture device of any size in minimal time.  These devices are also so expertly crafted that they can be deactivated and removed with one small padlock, even if the device is fully covering a person's entire body.  These villains are no longer scary because there is obviously no hope of survival at all.  No matter how physically strong or prepared a person is, they cannot avoid being captured by Jigsaw, and they have no chance of escaping his traps alive.Jigsaw is portrayed as a sort of avenging angel in this movie.  Out of all the characters, he is the most rational and detached from emotion.  The overall tone of the movie almost implies that he is correct and that everyone should just submit to his will and change their lives according to his system of beliefs.  The problem with this logic is that if Jigsaw's beliefs are applied to his own life, he should be the one stuck in a deadly trap.  His whole point in capturing and torturing people is to show them that they have been wasting their lives and they need to start living and being happy with their lot.  He states that one character was chosen because she spends her life doing nothing but trying to save the dead, while her family life is dying.  However, this exact same sentence could be applied to Jigsaw.  He spends his life trying to save others from emotional death, and this obsession has obviously killed him inside.Even with all these problems, Saw III does have some merit.  The gore in this entry of the series is simply out of control, and exceedingly well done.  The tone of the gore has become even more sadistic than in Saw II.  An early scene involving chains that have been run through a man's flesh, including his jaw, is absolutely stunning.  Pretty much everyone will cringe or look away when he starts ripping the chains out of himself.  The final major trap, dubbed ""the rack"", is one of the most diabolical devices put on film in recent memory.  The script is also better than anticipated, and it neatly brings the series full circle, connecting several events that didn't appear to be connected before.The parallels between Friday the 13th and Saw are occurring with increasing frequency.  Jigsaw and Jason both kill in retribution for people not agreeing with their view of how the world should work.  While Jason punishes those who do drugs or have pre-marital sex, Jigsaw punishes those who have squandered their lives.  Both are unstoppable, invincible whirlwinds of death who can sneak up on anyone, no matter how implausible the situation.  Like every Friday the 13th movie ever made, even though the ending of Saw III completely ruined any option for a sequel, Saw 4 is currently in production.  Obviously Jason, I mean Jigsaw, will rise again to continue torturing those who don't agree with his world view.I'll be skipping that one.",3,Friday the 13th Part 12,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,4228,"['original', 'Saw', 'was', 'everything', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'had', 'gore', 'implied', 'explicit', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'characters', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'want', 'see', 'die', 'Then', 'came', 'along', 'Saw', 'II', 'ramped', 'up', 'gore', 'factor', 'considerably', 'had', 'moments', 'was', 'obviously', 'only', 'there', 'make', 'money', 'success', 'original', 'Now', 'horror', 'genre', 'been', 'graced', 'third', 'offering', 'series', 'firmly', 'Friday', '13th', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'territory', 'series', 'now', 'officially', 'parody', 'continued', 'existence', 'only', 'assured', 'as', 'long', 'cash', 'cow', 'will', '.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Saw', 'III', 'Jigsaw', 'apprentice', 'Amanda', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'believable', 'villains', 'exude', 'sense', 'terror', 'aura', 'fear', 'are', 'creatures', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'exist', 'reality', 'Jigsaw', 'essentially', 'become', 'God', 'universe', 'minute', 'detail', 'person', 'life', 'where', 'everyone', 'how', 'take', 'coffee', 'how', 'long', 'drive', 'work', 'when', 'best', 'time', 'break', 'house', 'plant', 'cameras', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'relationships', 'spouses', 'children', 'are', 'what', 'color', 'underwear', 'buy', 'etc', 'Jigsaw', 'Amanda', 'are', 'also', 'expert', 'locksmiths', 'pharmacists', 'engineers', 'funds', 'can', 'craft', 'torture', 'device', 'size', 'minimal', 'time', 'devices', 'are', 'also', 'so', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'can', 'be', 'deactivated', 'removed', 'one', 'small', 'padlock', 'even', 'device', 'fully', 'covering', 'person', 'entire', 'body', 'villains', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'scary', 'obviously', 'hope', 'survival', 'matter', 'how', 'physically', 'strong', 'prepared', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'being', 'captured', 'Jigsaw', 'have', 'chance', 'escaping', 'traps', 'alive.Jigsaw', 'portrayed', 'sort', 'avenging', 'angel', 'movie', 'characters', 'most', 'rational', 'detached', 'emotion', 'overall', 'tone', 'movie', 'almost', 'correct', 'everyone', 'should', 'just', 'submit', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'according', 'system', 'beliefs', 'problem', 'logic', 'Jigsaw', 'beliefs', 'are', 'applied', 'own', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'stuck', 'deadly', 'trap', 'whole', 'point', 'capturing', 'torturing', 'people', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'wasting', 'lives', 'need', 'start', 'living', 'being', 'happy', 'lot', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'chosen', 'life', 'doing', 'nothing', 'trying', 'save', 'dead', 'family', 'life', 'dying', 'However', 'exact', 'same', 'sentence', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'Jigsaw', 'life', 'trying', 'save', 'others', 'emotional', 'death', 'obsession', 'obviously', 'killed', 'inside.Even', 'problems', 'Saw', 'III', 'have', 'merit', 'gore', 'entry', 'series', 'simply', 'control', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'done', 'tone', 'gore', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'sadistic', 'Saw', 'II', 'early', 'scene', 'involving', 'chains', 'have', 'been', 'run', 'man', 'flesh', 'including', 'jaw', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'will', 'cringe', 'look', 'away', 'when', 'ripping', 'chains', 'final', 'major', 'trap', 'dubbed', 'rack', 'one', 'most', 'diabolical', 'devices', 'put', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'script', 'also', 'better', 'anticipated', 'neatly', 'series', 'full', 'circle', 'connecting', 'several', 'events', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'connected', 'before.The', 'parallels', 'Friday', '13th', 'Saw', 'are', 'occurring', 'increasing', 'frequency', 'Jigsaw', 'Jason', 'kill', 'retribution', 'people', 'not', 'agreeing', 'view', 'how', 'world', 'should', 'work', 'Jason', 'punishes', 'who', 'do', 'drugs', 'have', 'pre-marital', 'sex', 'Jigsaw', 'punishes', 'who', 'have', 'squandered', 'lives', 'are', 'unstoppable', 'invincible', 'whirlwinds', 'death', 'who', 'can', 'sneak', 'up', 'anyone', 'matter', 'how', 'implausible', 'situation', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'ending', 'Saw', 'III', 'completely', 'ruined', 'option', 'sequel', 'Saw', '4', 'currently', 'production', 'Obviously', 'Jason', 'mean', 'Jigsaw', 'will', 'rise', 'again', 'continue', 'torturing', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'world', 'view.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'skipping', 'one']",N/A
1037910,A6T5QGOZ70BJ7,B000LC3ICY,"Vandalgal2006 ""musicaladybug""","[1, 1]","All I can say is ""WOW!"" I loved the third installment of the Saw franchise. It's packed with gore and scenes that will make you cringe and look away. Amongst this thick-with-blood film, we have another unique story with yet another climatic twist at the end. ""Saw III"" picks up where ""Saw II"" left off and if you haven't seen the first two Saw movies, I strongly recommend that you watch them first. You'll see through flashbacks to the previous two Saw movies how ""Saw III"" fits together with the other two like a puzzle piece, so all three are linked together perfectly.Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is back once again and she's vicious! She is a very strong and pivotal character in the film, and Smith does an outstanding job of portraying the violent, emotionally unstable Amanda. As Jigsaw's/John Kramer's accomplice, she is helping him with his latest game, but it's Amanda who is truly put to the test as you will see as the film progresses. John is bedridden, hooked up to a heart monitor, dying from cancer and using an oxygen mask to help him breathe, however he uses his bleak situation as a tool for his game. Amanda kidnaps a woman named Lynn (Bahar Soomekh), a depressed, pill-popping surgeon with marital problems, and takes her to the building where John lays waiting. Lynn's test? Keep John alive until another person in the building completes his series of tests. But it won't be that easy. John will need brain surgery and fast (the brain surgery segment is probably my favorite part in the film). Lynn must do the gruesome surgery and keep John from flat lining, or else the shotgun collar that Amanda placed around her head will go off, and she too will flat line.The other person going through his own tests is a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a grieving father whose son was hit and killed by a drunk driver. Ever since the tragedy, Jeff has become bitter and emotionally lost, clinging to his deceased son's toys, neglecting his daughter and obsessing about revenge on those responsible for what happened. But Jigsaw has made the perfect game for Jeff, where he will have the ultimate choice to forgive and let go, or continue to let his hatred and hunger for revenge consume him. Jeff will come face to face with all those involved in his son's untimely death; the only witness to the crime who ran from the scene, the judge who gave the driver a light sentence, and finally the man responsible for the death of his son. All are in their own Jigsaw traps and it's up to Jeff whether they live or die. We're treated to some new inventive traps; the Freezing room trap, the pig juice vat trap and the Rack trap that twists limbs.So the web of John, Amanda, Jeff and Lynn make ""Saw III"" what it is. However there are some other main factors of the movie that are brought to our attention at the start of the film. Take the situation of Troy (J. Larose), a man who seemingly enjoys being in prison more than having freedom. Troy is in a chain trap, where the chains are literally hooked into various areas of his body. He must release himself before a bomb goes off. But we'll find out that there is something different about this particular Jigsaw trap; something that doesn't ring true to Jigsaw's philosophy of earning the privilege to stay alive. Such is also the case with detective Alison Kerry (Dina Meyer), the ever devoted crime investigator from the first two Saw movies who blames herself for the disappearance of detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Whalberg) (yes, he's back for ""Saw III""). According to Jigsaw, she is as dead as the corpses she investigates and therefore has the opportunity to join death as well. She has been put into a ""ribcage angel trap"", where there is a device hooked into her ribcage. She must unlock the device with a key that is inside a beaker of acid within a minute or else......well, you get the picture. But again, this Jigsaw trap is not your average Jigsaw trap. It's seemingly a whole different game.Fantastic special effects, great acting, intense storyline, new twists, heart-pounding sequences, gore galore and an amazing ending; yes, ""Saw III"" more than delivers. Writers Leigh Whannell (who also appears in a key sequence of this film) and James Wan do it again, and Darren Lynn Bousman is back as director. They do an excellent job of bringing ""Saw III"" together with the first two. As much as I like the first Saw, this one probably beats it out by a hair. ""Saw III"" is horror at its best.

1037911,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B000LC3ICY,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[0, 0]","The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the saw3 (I haven't seen 4 yet) so saw2 got 5 stars, saw3 gets only 3 stars.Traps in 3 include: a) Angel trap (my fav) - metal parts stitched to the ribs so when the wings open, its bye bye ribs. Everything comes flying apart. Basically you end up missing your whole torso. 2) pig mincer 3) body wrencher - neck, legs, and arms are wrenched 360 degree to provide some cool and inventive death/torture 4) big freeze 5) head detonation. (they actually show you the stump that gets left behind eeeeks !!!!)  SFX guys you rock in this movie. This movie is all about the FX. The pigs were artifically made so that they cud be thrown in the pig mincer/juicer scene. watch the fx commentary on the extras in the ""traps section""Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the ""the traps of Jigsaw"" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary. There is a ""making of"". You'll be find renting this one beter off. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.This one is not as psychological as 2. This is more in your face blood and guts. Its all about ribs flying apart, intestines comming out, bones being broken and heads being blow apart. Pls be warned this one is the most most grossest of the whole series. I mean it. Walk away from this movie if this kind of stuff gives you insomnia or nightmares.Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I dont think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened.Saw 3 is a total epsiode continuation of saw2. The characters start basically where they left off in 2. So if you don't see saw2 before seeing this one, you won't be able to make sense of the movie flow and login as there are a lot of flash backs to saw 2 . The set from saw 1 refuses to go away.

1037915,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000LC3ICY,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 2]","Unlike Saw II, Saw III starts off on shaky ground and feels a bit forced. The traps are gorier and harder, while we find that we don't care all that much about the characters themselves. The acting is still good, but the story doesn't seem to meet the muster of the first sequel.The unresolved surprise ending involving Detective Matthews in Saw II is dealt with thoroughly here and answers many questions. But Saw III involves a new cast of characters to be tested by Jigsaw's games. Along with his sidekick Amanda, Jigsaw has kidnapped a female doctor and hooked his life support system to a device around her neck that will fire six rounds into her head if his heartbeat ever stops. Meanwhile a man whose son was a victim of a hit and run is forced to walk through rooms where each person who took part in that incident is being tortured in front of him.As the film goes on, the suspense seems to be dropping as the audience wonders why they should care about any of this. And although Jigsaw and Amanda provide a formidable evil duo, the momentum begins to drop due to an excess of gore and a cacophany of screams.In the end, though, it all pays off, and although the film itself doesn't live up to the original sequel, it's still much more interesting and mind-bending than most other horror films of this time. For a 3rd installment in a franchise, Saw III is a top-quality movie.

The first problem I have is they always seem to use these ""dumb white guys"" for the protagonists in the films.  it's like, how can you really pull for them and feel sorry for their situation, when their character is borderline unlikable from the get-go?  I also find the storyline abit confusing at times, there is so much going on, you seem to have to be completely wrapped up in all of the films storylines to understand fully what's going on.  As far as gore, this had got to be the most digusting horror film I have EVER seen.  I almost never have to look away from the screen but on this one, I simply cannot watch the brain surgery scene or the twist torture sequence at the end.  I can only look for a second and then immeadiatley look away again.  I guess this could be a good thing, that's why were horror fans right?  This was Shawnee Smith's movie, I love her in some other films, she's always plays quirky roles.  I wish she would have acted more edgy and bizarre like in some of her other roles.  Check her out in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""The Stand"".  She rocks.
