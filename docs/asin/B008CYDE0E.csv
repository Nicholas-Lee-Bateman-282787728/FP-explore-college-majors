1550480,AWDXW8CV95OCX,B008CYDE0E,"Barbara Hamaker ""True Seeker""","[37, 39]","Since attending several Los Angeles workshops given by Joseph Campbell in the 1980s, his teachings and indeed his voice have become an underlying soundtrack for my life.  He was absolutely captivating in person, sparkling with life and humor, but most of all wisdom spilling out of him Niagara-style.  Altho his radiant presence is a bit diminished by the process of being filmed, it is still there.  When Bill Moyers filmed those series of interviews with Joe, the world was given the opportunity (and gift) to discover Campbell as well.When I first heard him say ""God is beyond all categories of thought"" I melted into the very core of my being, and began anew a journey broadened by his wisdom that has informed and continues to fulfill my life quest for understanding.  There is no end (or definition) to understanding, but Joseph Campbell is a great place to start.This collected works of ""MYthos"", as a previous reviewer wrote, is not entertainment in the usual sense, but a Master Course in the meaning of soul and Spirit, of gods and Gods, of life we beings have created in multitudinous forms and cultures with myth as the legacy.  A road map of discovery. Not for everyone, to be sure, but for some, paved with gold.",5,Beyond All Categories of Thought,1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,1226,"['attending', 'several', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'workshops', 'given', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', '1980s', 'teachings', 'indeed', 'voice', 'have', 'become', 'underlying', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'was', 'absolutely', 'captivating', 'person', 'sparkling', 'life', 'humor', 'most', 'wisdom', 'spilling', 'Niagara-style', 'Altho', 'radiant', 'presence', 'bit', 'diminished', 'process', 'being', 'filmed', 'still', 'there', 'When', 'Bill', 'Moyers', 'filmed', 'series', 'interviews', 'Joe', 'world', 'was', 'given', 'opportunity', 'gift', 'discover', 'Campbell', 'well.When', 'first', 'heard', 'say', 'God', 'categories', 'thought', 'melted', 'very', 'core', 'being', 'began', 'anew', 'journey', 'broadened', 'wisdom', 'informed', 'fulfill', 'life', 'quest', 'understanding', 'end', 'definition', 'understanding', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'great', 'place', 'start.This', 'collected', 'works', 'MYthos', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'not', 'entertainment', 'usual', 'sense', 'Master', 'Course', 'meaning', 'soul', 'Spirit', 'gods', 'Gods', 'life', 'beings', 'have', 'created', 'multitudinous', 'forms', 'cultures', 'myth', 'legacy', 'road', 'map', 'discovery', 'Not', 'everyone', 'be', 'sure', 'paved', 'gold']",N/A

Where am I going?  How much time do I have?Campbell answers these questions by not answering them but rather giving comparisons and mythic examples.He was a quiet genius and the world is better for having him in it.,5,Clear Answers for Difficult Questions,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,492,"['Joseph', 'Campbell', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'profound', 'thinkers', 'philosophers.His', 'ability', 'make', 'life', 'most', 'baffling', 'questions', 'clear', 'focused', 'unsurpassed.Mythos', 'not', 'light', 'entertainment', 'very', 'satisfying', 'are', 'looking', 'meaning', 'life.Who', 'am', 'Where', 'am', 'going', 'How', 'much', 'time', 'do', 'have', 'Campbell', 'questions', 'not', 'answering', 'rather', 'giving', 'comparisons', 'mythic', 'examples.He', 'was', 'quiet', 'genius', 'world', 'better', 'having']",N/A
1550484,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B008CYDE0E,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[35, 39]","Joseph Campbell's personal passion for myth is again documented in a trilogy series of 15 episodes that are difficult to rate. Previously released sets have been combined into ""The Complete Series."" As a light evening of TV entertainment it would fail for most viewers. But this is a documentary. An educational adventure. PBS. It would be quite rewarding teaching for students and participants in literature, mythology, philosophy, and creative writing. For those viewers I have offered a 5 star rating. Viewers who robustly defend their own personal faith will find parts confusing.How does myth combine with artistic expression in poetry and prose?Campbell's lectures are occasionally illustrated with stills and video snippets while he continues his talk. He discusses myths, symbols, Asian myths, specific pieces of literary art and its content within his knowledge of myth themes. He offers fragments of humor surprisingly coming from this deep-thinking, historic-oriented, intellectual. He uses some higher or advanced vocabulary creating a university-level lecture series (at the least advanced H.S. level.) Susan Sarandon helps comprehension for Campbell's lectures through her introductions, summations, and one or two spot enlightenment moments during each of the presentation episodes. Some past reviewers have found her annoying, I did not.What Joseph Campbell seems to lack most is personal, individual faith, which may be a result of his lifetime of the study of myths, or is his life's devotion a result of a lack of faith? The open-minded viewer will have to answer that for him/her self. Remember, it's packaged as educational documentary philosophy, not religious doctrine.Episodes DO have SUBTITLES available inJoseph Campbell: Mythos 3.  Closed captioning works for me on Mythos I & II.
