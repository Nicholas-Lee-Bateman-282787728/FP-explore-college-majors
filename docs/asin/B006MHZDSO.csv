1517368,A2V0RJQIRF6MTV,B006MHZDSO,book lover,"[0, 0]",this set comes with 2 dvds in a box. there are 2 disc per dvd with like 10 episodes on each disc. there is no subtitles so if you wanna watch it in Japanese you need to know the language. but the English dub is really good and funny so it doesn't bother me that I cant watch the Japanese version. if you don't mind the english dub then this set is for you! I cant wait to buy part 2,5,great set,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,382,"['set', '2', 'dvds', 'box', 'are', '2', 'disc', 'dvd', 'like', '10', 'episodes', 'disc', 'subtitles', 'so', 'wan', 'na', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'need', 'know', 'language', 'English', 'dub', 'really', 'good', 'funny', ""n't"", 'bother', 'cant', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'english', 'dub', 'then', 'set', 'cant', 'wait', 'buy', 'part', '2']","Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo: The Complete Series, Part 1"

I was expecting the quality of the video to be bad for having 10 episodes per disc for the first 3 and 8 episodes on the 4th, but it's really not that bad. The Collection seems to viewable in English 2.0 or Japanese 2.0 Audio but there aren't any subtitles.The Anime is so whacky and crazy that doesn't make much sense, but I still can't help but to watch it. It isn't the type of show that everyone will watch and think of as a 5 Star Anime, but the only way to know if you'll enjoy this series is to see it. Most people in my family enjoy it, but I've met others that complained that it was extremely stupid. I'm thankful S'More Entertainment decided to license the re release of this series since Illumitoon didn't finish it.",5,"Crazy, Whacky, and Fun for some, but not all.",1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,772,"['Collection', '38', 'Episodes', '4', 'Discs', 'was', 'expecting', 'quality', 'video', 'be', 'bad', 'having', '10', 'episodes', 'disc', 'first', '3', '8', 'episodes', '4th', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'Collection', 'viewable', 'English', '2.0', 'Japanese', '2.0', 'Audio', 'are', ""n't"", 'subtitles.The', 'Anime', 'so', 'whacky', 'crazy', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', ""n't"", 'type', 'show', 'everyone', 'will', 'watch', 'think', '5', 'Star', 'Anime', 'only', 'way', 'know', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'series', 'see', 'Most', 'people', 'family', 'enjoy', ""'ve"", 'met', 'others', 'complained', 'was', 'extremely', 'stupid', ""'m"", 'thankful', ""S'More"", 'Entertainment', 'decided', 'license', 're', 'release', 'series', 'Illumitoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish']","Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo: The Complete Series, Part 1"

However, the company that just released this box set released it with the English dub and the Japanese tracks.  Great news, right?  WROOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG!!!!  It is the Japanese track with NO subtitles, and then the company said that no subtitles track exists, so they are not doing one.  Um... did they forget they were RELEASING THIS IN AMERICA!!!!???  Whomever these bastards are need to die a quick death.  At least 4Kids is honest about not giving a damn about anime fans.

1517371,A1FKZ7W5QAX6LD,B006MHZDSO,Rodney V. Bengford,"[5, 5]","I have been a big fan of this show ever since it was on cartoon network. I was thinking that the whole show was never going to be released on dvd. So when I heard that they were finally releasing this show like this, I couldn't wait to preorder it. This is a big improvement over how it was released before where you only got like three episodes and they didn't even release all of the episodes. Other animes could take a lesson from this, specifically I mean shows like Bleach where you get like 11 or 12 episodes for 30 to 40 dollars. Give us more episodes for less money just as they have done with this show. This is a great show that will keep you laughing throughout its entirety. Great show, more than usual number of episodes in the box set, and a reasonable price. You can't beat that.",5,Finally,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,794,"['have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'ever', 'was', 'cartoon', 'network', 'was', 'thinking', 'whole', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'dvd', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'finally', 'releasing', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'preorder', 'big', 'improvement', 'how', 'was', 'released', 'where', 'only', 'got', 'three', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'release', 'episodes', 'Other', 'animes', 'could', 'take', 'lesson', 'specifically', 'mean', 'shows', 'Bleach', 'where', 'get', '11', '12', 'episodes', '30', '40', 'dollars', 'Give', 'more', 'episodes', 'less', 'money', 'just', 'have', 'done', 'show', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'entirety', 'Great', 'show', 'more', 'usual', 'number', 'episodes', 'box', 'set', 'reasonable', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat']","Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo: The Complete Series, Part 1"

I am a huge fan of Bobobo-bo. The best Anime with comedy and makes fun of other Anime as well. If you like slap stick, nutty, and stuff that just doesn't make sence at all, then you will love this. A first hero that uses his nose hairs as whips and listens to his nose hairs for battle, is one great comedy. You have to see it to believe it. This Bobobo-bo fights a guy called Baldy Bald a man who goes and tries to cut everones hair as one of his evil plans is wierd enough. But theres more to it than that. Theres tons of crazy heroes that helps him fight all these crazy battles along the way, and even weirder ones that becomes his side kicks.
