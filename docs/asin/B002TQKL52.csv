Even though I had a feeling Season 8 would be the last - I thought for sure Girlfriends would have received a proper send-off. No fantasy wedding for Joan and the rest of the characters were left hanging with no sense of resolution. Tracee Ellis Ross was such a gem throughtout the entire series, I could relate to her and her many relationship woes. Season 8 is short but definitely worth purchasing as is Seasons 1-7.

1288654,A3CMDR34KFLGFX,B002TQKL52,Reader2008,"[16, 17]","I have watched all seasons of Girlfriends.  I got addicted in the first 3 seasons and anxiously wanted to know what Toni was upto.  After Jill Marie Jones left, I continued to watch the show just because I needed a rsolution for the series.  The Eigth Season does NOT give you that resolution.The Eighth Season was very serious.  I was exhausted watching one heartache after another: boyfriend in the war, living in a crack house, losing a baby, etc..With all the seriousness, I did like one episode though.  William was called ""aggressive"" at work and no one laughs at his joke.  As a black professional, I could definitely relate to that storyline.  At work, all the boring stories by a certain group is funny, as soon as I say something they look at me like I am speaking a foreign languae. We definitely are treated differently in the workplace.  This episode highlighted WHY Girlfriends was so gooooood in the early years.  The show tackled topics and issues that really were happening to black people.Another episode I liked, but distorted the truth was the adoption storyline.  The reality is that JOAN is the one that should have adopted a child but they had Maya and Darnell doing it.  They went through the county and were immediately about to be offerred a 6 month old that is healthy and the parental rights had been terminated.Having gone ""Through the county,"" adoption is VERY long and challenging with the ocunty.  To terminate the parental rights of a child is a long drawn out process and takes years.  Thus, unless the 6 month old had been abandoned, the parental rights on a healthy baby would not have been terminated that easily.Also, the episode did show that most of the adoptive parents are white while the children are black.  This is TRUE, but it is not because black people don't want ot adopt.  Again, the process is very long and challenging and they do everything to discourage you: telling you how bad the children are, that they may have health issues, and so forth.  The episode did show that part of the process.  Many of the parents were concerned about the behavioral issues of the adoptive children.Thus, it seems that towards the end the show was getting back on track, but they waited too late.  There were at least 3 or 4 years of BAD writing before they got back to the good writing.The reason I gave this season a 2 is this: there were many unresolved matters.  The last season was too serious not to have addressed some of the pending matters early on knowing that cancellation would likely happen.The show should have did this:1. Either have Aaron killed in Iraq (Bagdad) or have him come home and he and Joan get married or break up.Personally, I watched Joan over the years and she was pretending to like Aaron.  Joan didn't have the ""glow"" with Aaron that she had with Brock or that guy that moved to NY.  Thus, I think Aaron should have been killed or Joan realize that their differences were just too much for them to get married.2. Either have Maya write another successful book or have her get a job doing something that requires writing.  Having Maya write the community newsletter seemed a bit crazy.3. Give Lynne the record deal and have either her album flop or top the charts.  It is unfortunate that Lynne never had any success on the show.  I also was disappointed that they had Lynne sleeping with a guy in college when she clearly had nothing in common with him.4. What happened to the J-Spot?  In the 8th season, it wasn't even shown yet Joan was acting like a bougee high spender and spending her evenings watching Knitting Shows.  If neither she or William were at the J-Spot, who was running it.5. Toni and Joan: these two were the heart of the show.  This was 2007 and I find it hard to believe that Joan would not have tried to go on the internet and seen if Toni had posted photos of her and Morgan (the baby).  Joan didn't even care about Morgan, which was obvious when she decided to act like the IT girl instead of helping her friend take care of her God-child.  In any case, Joan and Toni should have had a ficticious conversation with a baby, if not Toni, so we could see how the baby looked and what Toni was up to.  In fact, I could see Toni having her own Friends in the City show out of NY.Anyway, I think the 7th Season should have been the last:1. Lynne get a record deal; Joan get married or adopt; Maya gets a job working for a publisher; Darnell gets his garage; William has a baby; etc..The writers knew this show was coming to an end and did nothing to address the issues in the EARLY part of SEASON 8 which was irresponsible.",2,Very SERIOUS season; no longer a sitcom!

Well I was surprised and thrilled for I laughed and cried and enjoyed every single show. I do have one big annoyance, however.  The final season didn't give us William's baby and that interaction; we didn't get to see Aaron's return from the war or Joan pregnant.  We didn't get to see everything going on with Daryl and Maya although we got more of their future than the others and what about Tony???? I adored her and was really surprised that she was cut out of the last two years. Maybe it was a 'money' thing but they just said she went to NY and that was that.  Overall the show was wonderful and the only gripe I have is the final season; I would have loved to see more of the future of everyone-even Jaybar (?).One final mention: The homes and apartments were beautiful and so tastefully done; I would guess you got a lot of emails as to where to purchase many of the things displayed in Joan's and Tony's and Maya and William's home.Bottom Line: I paid l00.00 for this whole set and it was worth every penny.
