366002,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303257348,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and fleshed out in a way quite unexpected, `3:10 to Yuma' is one of the better Westerns I've ever seen.  This is saying a lot, or maybe not so much, considering that I am not a fan of the genre much at all.  I was intrigued to see this original 1957 film because I really enjoyed the 2007 remake which starred Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.  This original is a different animal all together; a film that is similar in storyline (obviously) but different in overall construction.I really like what James Mangold did with the material, but this film, helmed by director Delmer Daves, possesses more depth.The basic premise follows a rancher named Dan Evans who is falling behind in profits and is on the verge of losing everything he has.  He witnesses a robbery and a murder and winds up getting an interesting proposition.  He gets offered $200 to help escort the famed criminal Ben Wade to the train that will take him to prison in Yuma.  Wade's gang, the group that Dan witnessed kill a man, is hot on their tales and threatens Dan's very life as he stops at nothing to serve justice.  All the while, Ben is working his conniving magic to try and turn Dan and get him to switch sides.  He prays on Dan's vulnerability and his desperate situation, never banking on the sense of morality the man possesses.What makes `3:10 to Yuma' such an interesting story is that it isn't as focused on the action as it is on the building of character.  The way that both Ben and Dan interact is what builds the foundation of the film.  Mangold's remake upped the ante when it came to the action sequences, and that final shootout at the train is better executed in the remake, but this original film seems to lay a stronger foundation with the building of character.  While I felt that Crowe's interpretation of Ben Wade was stunningly savage and deserving of all the praise it garnered, it betrayed the original concept of the man.  Glenn Ford's portrayal, while not as engrossing because of not being so aggressive, adds a sharper layer to the man because we see the old world loyalties that make for a more respectable character, despite his occupation.  Where the 2007 film relied on savagery to convey that gritty Western feeling, this 1957 original incorporates more of the values of the western world in making a thinking man's film.Van Heflin is phenomenal here, truly fleshing out the intensity behind Dan's convictions.  Where Bale was effectively conserved and broken, Heflin ignites the film with a rich aggression needed to stand ground against Ben Wade himself.  In other words; Russell Crowe swallows Christian Bale whole, whereas Van Heflin gives Glenn Ford a major run for his money (and winds up winning, in my opinion).With a score that accentuates the atmosphere and cinematography that is TO-DIE-FOR, `3:10 to Yuma' is a winner on all accounts.",5,An original masterpiece...,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2891,"['Beautifully', 'shot', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'fleshed', 'out', 'way', 'quite', 'unexpected', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'one', 'better', 'Westerns', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'saying', 'lot', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'considering', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'much', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'original', '1957', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', '2007', 'remake', 'starred', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'original', 'different', 'animal', 'together', 'film', 'similar', 'storyline', 'obviously', 'different', 'overall', 'construction.I', 'really', 'what', 'James', 'Mangold', 'did', 'material', 'film', 'helmed', 'director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'more', 'depth.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'rancher', 'named', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'who', 'falling', 'profits', 'verge', 'losing', 'everything', 'robbery', 'murder', 'up', 'getting', 'interesting', 'proposition', 'offered', '200', 'help', 'escort', 'famed', 'criminal', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'train', 'will', 'take', 'prison', 'Yuma', 'Wade', 'gang', 'group', 'Dan', 'witnessed', 'kill', 'man', 'hot', 'tales', 'Dan', 'very', 'life', 'nothing', 'serve', 'justice', 'while', 'Ben', 'working', 'conniving', 'magic', 'try', 'turn', 'Dan', 'get', 'switch', 'sides', 'Dan', 'vulnerability', 'desperate', 'situation', 'never', 'banking', 'sense', 'morality', 'man', 'possesses.What', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'such', 'interesting', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'focused', 'action', 'building', 'character', 'way', 'Ben', 'Dan', 'interact', 'what', 'foundation', 'film', 'Mangold', 'remake', 'upped', 'ante', 'when', 'came', 'action', 'sequences', 'final', 'shootout', 'train', 'better', 'executed', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'lay', 'stronger', 'foundation', 'building', 'character', 'felt', 'Crowe', 'interpretation', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'was', 'stunningly', 'savage', 'deserving', 'praise', 'garnered', 'betrayed', 'original', 'concept', 'man', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'portrayal', 'not', 'engrossing', 'not', 'being', 'so', 'aggressive', 'sharper', 'layer', 'man', 'see', 'old', 'world', 'make', 'more', 'respectable', 'character', 'occupation', 'Where', '2007', 'film', 'relied', 'savagery', 'convey', 'gritty', 'Western', 'feeling', '1957', 'original', 'more', 'values', 'western', 'world', 'making', 'thinking', 'man', 'film.Van', 'Heflin', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'truly', 'fleshing', 'out', 'intensity', 'Dan', 'convictions', 'Where', 'Bale', 'was', 'effectively', 'conserved', 'broken', 'Heflin', 'film', 'rich', 'aggression', 'needed', 'stand', 'ground', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'other', 'words', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'whole', 'whereas', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'major', 'run', 'money', 'up', 'winning', 'opinion', 'score', 'atmosphere', 'cinematography', 'TO-DIE-FOR', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'winner', 'accounts']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

Ford's gang, however, learns about the situation and plans to take  action.  The characters and performances by Ford and Heflin make the film  work.  Heflin is outwardly reluctant to take this job, but his strength  lies within.  The struggle within him is evident:  Here's a family man who  can save his farm or do what he knows is right.  Ford, the criminal, is  alluring, almost charming.  He's a con artist and a cold-blooded killer,  but you can't help liking him just a little.

DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","There is a lonely train called the 3.10 to YumaThe pounding of the wheels is more like a mournful sighThere's a legend and there's a rumorWhen you take the 3.10 to YumaYou can see the ghosts of outlaws go ridin' by...In the sky...Way up high...Now that we've got out of the way one of the most awful opening theme songs any Western has been cursed with (sung by Frankie Laine), let's talk about one of the best-crafted Westerns Hollywood ever made...a fine example of getting the job done superbly and without phony flash, burdensome moral lessons, extra hormones or intense ""acting."" 3:10 to Yuma is the real goods.It's the short, unadorned story of Dan Evans (Van Heflin), a poor, stubborn rancher in the third year of a drought. He needs water. He needs money. His wife loves him and works as hard as he does. He worries how she's able to put up with all the misfortune. His two young sons look up to him but he'd like to leave them with a memory of him of more than just a hard-working failure. When they're out rounding up cattle the three witness a stagecoach holdup. The youngest boy wants his father to stop the holdup and capture the robbers. He knows with young certitude his father could do it all. Dan tells the boys to be quiet. As played by Van Heflin, we accept Dan's integrity and his earnest desire to do something for his family.It's also the story of Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). He and his gang rob anything they can get money from. Wade makes it a point of pride that he kills a person only if there were no other way to protect his own safety. Ben Wade is intelligent. He's charming, tough, and knows how to get around a woman or get inside a man's head. As played by Glenn Ford, we're nearly captured by star charisma and likeability. We know Ben Wade is a smart, sly villain, but we admire his confidence and smiling way of undermining another man's confidence.Dan Evans, desperate for money, agrees for $200 to take the captured Ben Wade to Contention, where he'll put him on the 3:10 train to Yuma and the Yuma Territorial Prison. Ben Wade knows that his gang will sooner or later figure out that he's being taken to Contention to await the train. He even tells Evans how they'll find out. When they show up and rescue him, they'll kill Evans and anyone helping him.This taut, simple story is told with economy and tension. There's no angst or ""acting,"" no allusions to the director's favorite causes, no close-ups of the make-up artists' skill at creating blood clots. In fact, there's not much bloodshed or violence until Dan finally has to find a way to get Ben from the hotel in Contention to the train station, where the train is waiting, and where so is Ben Wade's gang.Although there are some fine subsidiary performances, the movie is all about Evans and Wade. And that means that Heflin and Ford had to be at the top of their game to sustain this 92-minute movie. Dan Evans is a man much like Heflin's Dan Starrett in Shane. He's more resourceful than we might think, but mainly he's an honorable, earnest man who might be tempted by Ben Wade's coaxing tongue, but not for long. He wants the $200 for his family and because he knows he's doing the right thing. Unlike the 2007 remake, there's little question but that his wife loves him and that his two sons look up to him. Glenn Ford rarely played bad guys (watch him inLust for Gold), but he makes an outstanding one here. His shooting of two men at the start of the movie, one of them a member of his gang, is fast and startling. But it's Ford's winning personality that makes Wade so attractive and so dangerous. Maybe sometimes, when he dallies with a tired, pretty barmaid, he even believes some of what he says.A good deal of the movie is spent in a hotel room in Contention with Wade in handcuffs lying on the bed and Evans holding a shotgun, peering uneasily out the window looking for signs of Wade's gang. The interplay between Ford and Heflin - easy and underplayed - is a pleasure to watch. Ford shows how he can worm his way into Evans' mind, undermining his will and raising doubts. Heflin shows how tempting and frustrating just thinking about what Wade is saying must be. The final shootout is well-staged and violent; the conclusion is satisfying. There are no attempts by rich Hollywood directors and producers to bring Tinsel-town tragedy to a good story.There are echoes of High Noon, which the craftsmanship of this movie and the performances of Ford and Heflin quickly dispel. There are a few clich&eacute;s that are handled so respectfully, so matter-of-factly and so quickly that they are easy to forgive. The budget for 3:10 to Yuma (1957) was probably, even in 2007 dollars, less than Russell Crowe's salary alone in 3:10 to Yuma (2007). If you like movies and appreciate well-crafted stories, 3:10 to Yuma (1957) might find a place in your collection.",5,"This taut, classic Western demonstrates what craftsmanship in making movies is

Wade played in a notable acting performance by Glenn Ford and his gang are observed by local cattle rancher Dan Evans played in solid fashion by Van Heflin and his two young sons.  Wade and his desperadoes vamoose to the local town of Bisbee where they evade the sheriff and his posse.  Dawdling in town on account of a pretty barmaid Ford gets apprehended as the posse returns to town realizing they'd been hoodwinked.Stagecoach owner, the gutless Mr. Buttlefield played by the corpulent Robert Emhardt intends to see that Ford gets prosecuted for his crimes.  He recruits Heflin who is desperate for money to save his drought stricken herd to secret Ford to a nearby town to await the 3:10 train to the territorial prison in Yuma.  With the full knowledge that Ford's murderous gang will attempt to free him, the righteous Heflin with assistance from the town drunk embark on the dangerous journey.They arrive in the town to await the train holed up in the local hotel.  As the minutes slowly tick past a gripping psychological drama ensues between the manipulative Ford and the forlorn Heflin.  Ford fails to seduce Heflin with promises of riches if he releases him, which would solve his problems.  Heflin shows great restraint and resolve in carrying out his mission against improbable odds, as men enlisted to assist him, one by one abandon him.This taut drama ends on an improbable note as the experience has evidently forged a bond between the adversaries Ford and Heflin.Defintitely borrowing a page from the classic and dramatic western ""High Noon"", director Delmer Daves rachets up the tension as the time draws closer to the arrival of the train. He uses Heflin's pocket watch to remind us of the waning minutes.  Ford does very well in his portrayal of the principled scoundrel, usually cast as the good guy.  Heflin reprises his role of the strong and ethical farmer that he played to perfection in ""Shane"".

366017,AUHG8KSHI529U,6303257348,Craig Matteson,"[3, 3]","I decided to see this version before I take a look at the 2007 version to get an idea of what they did in the remake.  From the opening titles and the title song (sung by Frankie Laine) we get the idea of a parched and dangerous land.  We soon see the effects of this hard land on the life of everyone there.  A stagecoach robbery, cattle dying from drought, a family being ground down by disappointment.Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang feel entitled to take whatever they want and have nothing but contempt for all the weaklings they prey upon.  Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his sons witness the robbery but won't get involved and risk losing what scraps they have left.  His wife Alice (Leora Dana) is losing her respect for him and is willing to sacrifice what remains of Dan's pride to try and keep things together.Events bring Dan and Ben together again and keep them together for the rest of the movie.  It is a test of Dan's integrity and also an examination of Ben's villainy, to see how far he will go and what he is willing to do to keep get and stay free.  The ending is controversial and causes all kinds of discussion.  I think it is a good ending and consistent with what we have learned about all the characters throughout the movie.  However, you will have to see it on your own.  I am not willing to spoil it, even though it is a fifty year old movie.  It is a reexamination of many of the themes that High Noon went through seven years earlier, but Dan isn't the brave Marshall, he is a simple farmer trying to keep body and soul together for his family.Having now seen the new version, and it is very good, the performances by Van Heflin and Glenn Ford hold up very well.  They show all the shifting emotions and the layers of morality (and immorality) with subtlety.  This version isn't as bleak or hopeless as the new one and you might prefer one over the other, but I like both and am happy to let each stand on its own.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,How do desperation and character strike a balance?,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1983,"['decided', 'see', 'version', 'take', 'look', '2007', 'version', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'did', 'remake', 'opening', 'titles', 'title', 'song', 'sung', 'Frankie', 'Laine', 'get', 'idea', 'parched', 'dangerous', 'land', 'soon', 'see', 'effects', 'hard', 'land', 'life', 'everyone', 'there', 'stagecoach', 'robbery', 'cattle', 'dying', 'drought', 'family', 'being', 'ground', 'down', 'disappointment.Ben', 'Wade', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'gang', 'feel', 'entitled', 'take', 'want', 'have', 'nothing', 'contempt', 'weaklings', 'prey', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'sons', 'witness', 'robbery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'risk', 'losing', 'what', 'have', 'left', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Leora', 'Dana', 'losing', 'respect', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'what', 'Dan', 'pride', 'try', 'keep', 'things', 'together.Events', 'bring', 'Dan', 'Ben', 'together', 'again', 'keep', 'together', 'rest', 'movie', 'test', 'Dan', 'integrity', 'also', 'examination', 'Ben', 'villainy', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'what', 'willing', 'do', 'keep', 'get', 'stay', 'free', 'ending', 'controversial', 'kinds', 'discussion', 'think', 'good', 'ending', 'consistent', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'characters', 'movie', 'However', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'own', 'am', 'not', 'willing', 'spoil', 'even', 'fifty', 'year', 'old', 'movie', 'reexamination', 'many', 'themes', 'High', 'Noon', 'went', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'Dan', ""n't"", 'brave', 'Marshall', 'simple', 'farmer', 'trying', 'keep', 'body', 'soul', 'together', 'family.Having', 'now', 'seen', 'new', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'show', 'shifting', 'emotions', 'layers', 'morality', 'immorality', 'subtlety', 'version', ""n't"", 'as', 'bleak', 'hopeless', 'new', 'one', 'might', 'prefer', 'one', 'other', 'like', 'am', 'happy', 'let', 'stand', 'own.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",3:10 to Yuma VHS
366018,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,6303257348,Daniel Hurley,"[2, 2]","Glenn Ford is at his best as he subtly underplays a highly intelligent, sophisticated yet violent outlaw that seems to move at his own pace regardless of the action of others or time or circumstances. His character, Ben Wade, is one of the most unique individuals particularly in westerns, as he is a man of fine tastes, extraordinary courage mixed with a total lack of alacrity about whether he could be caught or killed. The fact that he can and does become violent enough to kill a man and whomever is in his way is oddly inconsistent with his cerebral abilities indicating that he could have had a highly successful life without crime. Van Heflin plays what is almost a stereotype for him as a less powerful and charismatic hero as his vintage role in the 1953 western ""Shane"" but Heflin's strong yet subdued principled character works well against Ford as he accepts the difficult mission, due to economic desperation and maybe because it is the right thing to do, to deliver the captured Wade to Yuma in time for the train. The interplay between the two characters makes the film as Ford's character sees positives in Heflin's struggling life with a supportive wife and family trying to scratch it out on a ranch that is on the verge of failure yet is owned, at least for the time being by Heflin. The film captures Ford's quiet and interested reflection that Heflin may have what he was always seeking, something concrete and real not just a life of escapism and it just about seems to amuse Ford with the thought. Ford's character is continuously fascinating, he is the legendary killer Ben Wade but he has excellent table manners, is particular about what he eats and even in the comfort he seeks. The drama builds as Heflin and his party, with Ford in tow, are being tracked by Ford's extremely violent killers led by actor Richard Jaeckel. The end is the typical confrontation in all westerns but much more realistic than its remake and a very satisfying film.

366020,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6303257348,darragh o'donoghue,"[120, 125]","'3:10 To Yuma' is a stark monochrome Western that has been praised for its suspense and high moral tone.  Van Heflin, in a darker variant on his role in 'Shane', plays a character who picks up where most Westerns leave off.  The genre is usually concerned with taming wild loners or men with pasts. rewarding them with the joys of civilisation.  Heflin has seen what civilisation really means.  He lives on a drought-dry farm with a wife and two children he often fails to feed.  The grind of fruitless labour has worn them all down, and Heflin's identity as a man, having been once the greatest shot in these parts, is now undermined by humiliation in front of his family by outlaws stealing his cattle and horses, or forced to beg money from indifferent acquaintances.  His wife can't understand that his inability to 'be' a 'man' is the result of the civilisation she represents.What's a poor honest farmer to do when he sees murderers and thieves throwing money around, drinking their fill, bedding beautiful strangers, and generally living the whooping-it-up life?  Glenn Ford is the not-completely-irredeemable leader of a gang of devoted sadists so feared throughout the region that no lawman dares touch him.  Such men are usually let down by their sexual desire, and when he leaves his gang to schmooze a barmaid, he is captured by the locals.  Knowing that they will be no match for the manpower or ruthlessness of the gang when they return to rescue Ford, the sheriff plans a decoy, which will need two foolishly brave men to take the bandit to the train station at Contention City.  The initally reluctant Heflin accepts the job when a farm-saving reward of $200 is offered.In many ways, 'Yuma' works against the conventions of the Western as it seeks, like the hero to avoid action and the inevitable climactic shoot-out for as long as possible.  The film's centre-piece is a lengthy, stagy sequence in a hotel room in which Heflin holds Ford prisoner - potential ponderousness is offset by the terrific acting of the two aging actors, one goading and testing the other, tempting with crooked offers that are all too tempting; the other struggling manfully to resist.  At first, Heflin's taking the job is strictly economical - he needs the money.  Then it becomes ethical, a stand against socially disruptive forces threatening the community.  It is also a test of the masculinity that has long been buried by family duties.  Finally, it is an existential struggle, with Ford as the man Heflin could easily become (and perhaps once was?), and his men as the instruments of inexorable Fate the farmer must face and outwit on his own, stripped of support, just as Man must eventually face Death.The film's mise-en-scene is suitably austere, the black-and-white cinematography emphasising sharp contrasts, the alienating outlines of buildings and landscapes, and the vulnerable men and women who walk through them - sometimes watching 'Yuma' is like leafing slowly through an album of stark 19th century photographs taken of the West.  The 'city' in which the film is mostly played out initially seems like a ghost town, and a surreal funeral sequence interrupting, or accentuating, the tension, gives a quality of dream.  Delmer Daves' direction is not self-effacing - every shot is meticulously, often heavily composed, character patterns structured in frames creating a sense of constriction and claustrophobia that serves to turn the plot's screws.

Wong,"[4, 5]","Perhaps due to the recent success of the remake of this short story by Elmore Leonard, this re-issue of the '57 classic western starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin was released. For students of screenwriting both versions offer an important lesson in the ""less is more"" axiom.  The original was a taut, short (barely over 90 minutes) tale that concentrated on its 2 main characters whereas the recent remake offers too many characters and subplots that makes this remake not as appealing as the original did. Also the characterizations of the 2 characters are quite different from the original.  Whereas Ford is shown as a bad guy who only draws when confronted, Crowe in the same role, is a Bible quoting psychotic who will shoot on mere provocation when crossed.  Also the farmer character as played by Heflin is now a disabled Civil war veteran who is burdened by marital problems with his wife. Also the ending has been drastically changed in the remake and a very unsatisfactory, nonsensical one at that!!  I've been taken to task for my criticism of the remake but I will hold steadfast to my opinion that if you build up sympathy for a character in a film--you don't kill him off unless there is a plausible reason for it which the remake did not have.

Ford killed a stagecoach driver while robbing the coach, but he is backed by a loyal gang that everyone fears.  Heflin is assisted by town drunk Henry Jones.  There's a lot going on in this brief, tense western.  The relationship between Heflin and Ford is really interesting, as Heflin finds more courage than we thought he had, and Ford makes his character almost likeable as  he mentally works over his captor.  There is also an interesting relationship between Heflin and his wife, quite complicated given their brief time together on screen.  She seems to question his courage and strength of character.  Director Delmer Daves gradually builds the tension, but never allows it to let-up, propelling the story to its exciting conclusion.  The centerpiece of the film is the performances of the two stars.  Ford, not a great actor as a rule, really digs into this character and makes him quite memorable, while Heflin, a favourite character actor of mine, is totally convincing as the beleaguered farmer, forced into the role of hero that he never wanted, but wants to prove he can handle.  This may not be a very well known film, but it should be considered one of those hidden treasures that it's fun to unearth.

At that time, I was too young to appreciate the psycological nuances, and overall tension offered in the movie. The next time I saw it was this past summer. Of course, the complexity and quality was wonderfully evident. This movie is a western masterpiece. All of the performances are first rate, especially those of Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. I also liked Felicia Farr quite a bit in her brief, yet effective role as the saloon woman who befriends Ford's character, Ben Wade. Obviously, contemporary movie audiences will compare this version to the well-made 2007 film starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I also like that film a lot, but for different reasons. I suggest one buy and enjoy the original film for what it offers: engaging film noir of the old west. It is not as violent as the 2007 remake, but action-packed, and just as gripping. In my opinion, it showcases one of Glenn Ford's very best performances. His character is disturbing, complex, and forever mysterious. The DVD restoration is fine.

366044,A329ALHKYK62O7,6303257348,Ky. Col.,"[2, 2]","3:10 to Yuma is the story of a down on his luck rancher played by Heflin who stumbles on a stage coach robbery by Ben Wade's (Glenn Ford) gang.  Heflin helps the local authorities catch Wade later that day.  The problem of course is that Wade's gang--temporarily led by Charlie Prince (Richard Jeckal) don't intend to sit around with their boss in custody.  Ultimtely Heflin is stuck with the town drunk trying to sneak Wade to the Contention railroad station for the 3:10 train to Yuma while a decoy wagon attempts to divert Prince.  Naturally the decoy fails leaving Heflin the stark choice of whether to complete his mission against stark odds.Ultimtely 3:10 to Yuma is an enjoyable Western with some interesting qualities.  Firstly, the story does not primarily revolve around shootouts.  There is brief violence at the stage coach hold-up and naturally some characters get killed off near the climax.  However, like High Noon, the story is mostly psychological.  In this case it is the mental conflict between the charming but lethal Wade and the worried but ultimtely determined protagonist.  Both Heflin and Ford do an excellent job portraying their respective characters.  Ford especially brings to life a fascinating antagonist in Ben Wade.  Wade can be ruthless but has a sense of honor.  He is dangerous but charming.  He is skillfully manipulative and some of the film's power are the scenes in the Contention hotel in which Wade attempts to bribe his captor or catch him off guard.Of course comparison will arise with the recent remake with Russell Crowe as Wade and Christian Bale as the rancher.  The remake is certainly darker and relies more on action (the body count is far higher).  Crowe does an excellent job in his own portrayal of Wade.  However, I found Ford's characterization to be a little more realistic.  Crowe's character in the remake is simply so much more lethal with firearms or knives than any of the other characters that his advantages seem a little too stacked.  Ford's character is dangerous but seems somehat more evenly matched.  I generally like Christian Bale's acting abilities but Heflin comes across more of an average person.  It is kind of ironic that in the remake Bale had much more difficulty controlling Crowe but was an excellent gunfighter otherwise.  While Heflin's character in the original apparently has some firearms skills, he mainly outwits Wade's gang with wits (cunningly positioning Wade so that getting in a shot would be difficult for instance).  Ben Foster's portrayal of Charlie Prince in the newer film is probably one of the few superiorities in my opinion of the newer film.  Jackel does a good job in the original but Foster plays the role as a lethal sociopath which creates a particularly adequate menace for Bale's character.  I certainly preferred the original film's ending to the newer remake (I will refrain from telling either to avoid spoilers).Overall the original film is a classic and I recommend it to fans of older westerns.",5,Very Well Acted Western,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3010,"['3:10', 'Yuma', 'story', 'down', 'luck', 'rancher', 'played', 'Heflin', 'who', 'stage', 'coach', 'robbery', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'gang', 'Heflin', 'local', 'authorities', 'catch', 'Wade', 'later', 'day', 'problem', 'course', 'Wade', 'gang', 'temporarily', 'led', 'Charlie', 'Prince', 'Richard', 'Jeckal', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'sit', 'boss', 'custody', 'Ultimtely', 'Heflin', 'stuck', 'town', 'drunk', 'trying', 'sneak', 'Wade', 'Contention', 'railroad', 'station', '3:10', 'train', 'Yuma', 'decoy', 'wagon', 'attempts', 'divert', 'Prince', 'Naturally', 'decoy', 'leaving', 'Heflin', 'stark', 'choice', 'complete', 'mission', 'stark', 'odds.Ultimtely', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'enjoyable', 'Western', 'interesting', 'qualities', 'Firstly', 'story', 'not', 'primarily', 'revolve', 'around', 'shootouts', 'brief', 'violence', 'stage', 'coach', 'hold-up', 'naturally', 'characters', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'climax', 'However', 'High', 'Noon', 'story', 'mostly', 'psychological', 'case', 'mental', 'conflict', 'charming', 'lethal', 'Wade', 'worried', 'ultimtely', 'determined', 'protagonist', 'Heflin', 'Ford', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'respective', 'characters', 'Ford', 'especially', 'life', 'fascinating', 'antagonist', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Wade', 'can', 'be', 'ruthless', 'sense', 'honor', 'dangerous', 'charming', 'skillfully', 'manipulative', 'film', 'power', 'are', 'scenes', 'Contention', 'hotel', 'Wade', 'attempts', 'bribe', 'captor', 'catch', 'off', 'guard.Of', 'course', 'comparison', 'will', 'arise', 'recent', 'remake', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Wade', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'rancher', 'remake', 'certainly', 'darker', 'more', 'action', 'body', 'count', 'far', 'higher', 'Crowe', 'excellent', 'job', 'own', 'portrayal', 'Wade', 'However', 'found', 'Ford', 'characterization', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'Crowe', 'character', 'remake', 'simply', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'lethal', 'firearms', 'knives', 'other', 'characters', 'advantages', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'stacked', 'Ford', 'character', 'dangerous', 'somehat', 'more', 'evenly', 'matched', 'generally', 'like', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Heflin', 'more', 'average', 'person', 'kind', 'ironic', 'remake', 'Bale', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'difficulty', 'controlling', 'Crowe', 'was', 'excellent', 'gunfighter', 'otherwise', 'Heflin', 'character', 'original', 'apparently', 'firearms', 'skills', 'mainly', 'Wade', 'gang', 'wits', 'cunningly', 'positioning', 'Wade', 'getting', 'shot', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'instance', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'portrayal', 'Charlie', 'Prince', 'newer', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'superiorities', 'opinion', 'newer', 'film', 'Jackel', 'good', 'job', 'original', 'Foster', 'role', 'lethal', 'sociopath', 'particularly', 'adequate', 'menace', 'Bale', 'character', 'certainly', 'preferred', 'original', 'film', 'ending', 'newer', 'remake', 'will', 'refrain', 'telling', 'avoid', 'spoilers', '.Overall', 'original', 'film', 'classic', 'recommend', 'fans', 'older', 'westerns']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

Stripped of his horses and forced to walk, Dan and his boys meet up with a posse from Bisbee that has been duped into responding to the robbery location by elements of the Wade gang that have made it back to town.When Dan and the posse enter Bisbee, Ben Wade's been too busy with the beautiful bar maid (Felicia Farr) to leave town.  He's captured and immediately dispatched towards Contention City - an actual pre-Statehood trading post that was located between Bisbee and Tucson.  From there, Wade is to be transported by train to the Territorial Prison in Yuma.  Dan Evans desperately needs the money being offered to see that Wade makes it on the train to Yuma and finds himself fighting off the Wade gang as they seek to prevent them from doing so.Great performances by both veteran actors, great direction by Delmer Daves, and with a terrific score by George Duning and an equally wonderful song - by the same name - from the magnificent Frankie Lane make this film a must-see for western movie enthusiasts.Having just seen the re-make - save your money and peace of mind and just buy the DVD of the 1957 version!",4,A Fine Western Yarn in the Real Hollywood Tradition,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1705,"['Written', 'cultural', 'conviction', 'set', 'background', 'Arizona', 'Territory', '3:10', ""Yuma'-"", 'based', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'short-story', 'pits', 'rancher', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'crafty', 'leader', 'band', 'desperados', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'outstanding', 'support', 'rich', 'character', 'actors', 'Ford', 'Rainey', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'feel', 'picture', 'reminescent', 'Shane', 'High', 'Noon', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'story', 'down-and-out', 'rancher', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'boys', 'who', 'stumble', 'brutal', 'stagecoach', 'robbery', 'pulled', 'off', 'Wade', 'gang', 'Stripped', 'horses', 'forced', 'walk', 'Dan', 'boys', 'meet', 'up', 'posse', 'Bisbee', 'been', 'duped', 'responding', 'robbery', 'location', 'elements', 'Wade', 'gang', 'have', 'made', 'back', 'town.When', 'Dan', 'posse', 'enter', 'Bisbee', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'been', 'too', 'busy', 'beautiful', 'bar', 'maid', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'leave', 'town', 'captured', 'immediately', 'dispatched', 'towards', 'Contention', 'City', 'actual', 'pre-Statehood', 'trading', 'post', 'was', 'located', 'Bisbee', 'Tucson', 'there', 'Wade', 'be', 'transported', 'train', 'Territorial', 'Prison', 'Yuma', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'desperately', 'money', 'being', 'offered', 'see', 'Wade', 'train', 'Yuma', 'fighting', 'off', 'Wade', 'gang', 'seek', 'prevent', 'doing', 'so.Great', 'performances', 'veteran', 'actors', 'great', 'direction', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'terrific', 'score', 'George', 'Duning', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'song', 'same', 'name', 'magnificent', 'Frankie', 'Lane', 'make', 'film', 'must-see', 'western', 'movie', 'enthusiasts.Having', 'just', 'seen', 're-make', 'save', 'money', 'peace', 'mind', 'just', 'buy', 'DVD', '1957', 'version']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

While it certainly does not have the cliched good guy-bad guy stereotypes, which is refreshing, there are some peculiar character quirks that just don't seem to add up--either that or somewhat sloppy plotting.The ""bad guy"" is played by Glen Ford, although he's not all bad. This is shown in a) a kind of love scene with him and Felicia Farr, and b) his unusual ""working"" relationship with the ""good guy"", played by Van Heflin. Ford's the leader of a gang who robs stagecoaches, among other things, and he shoots a man in what appears to be cold blood, in one scene--while at the same time not harming a hair on the head of Heflin or his two young sons, who just happen to be in the vicinity at the time of the holdup.As fate would have it, Heflin needs dough real bad since his cattle are dying from a drought and he has to get them water and feed in order to survive. The opportunity for dough comes up when the marshal of a nearby town manages to capture Ford (his character's name is Ben Wade) right after he sweet-talks the barmaid, played by comely Felicia Farr, into being his, ahem, girlfriend. The Heflin character's job is to escort Ben Wade (Ford) to the train, the 3:10 to Yuma, for which he'll be paid a nice chunk o' change--$200, to be exact.One point of sloppy plotting is that after they part, she's never seen again. So, OK, bye, don't need ya anymore. The good old American way. Yeah, chalk that up to some kind of prescient sense of 21st century America or something. Another is why exactly Wade takes a shine to the Van Heflin character, so much so that he goes along with him completely, right to the very end. In fact, the very end of the film really doesn't make much sense at all. Are we to believe that all of a sudden Ben Wade really doesn't want to be a bad guy after all, but instead comply with the law--just because he owes the Van Heflin character??  I don't think so.The ending is fairly botched and the love interest gets tossed away like a sack of old potatoes. Other than that, though, this has a lot of fine moments, including the scene depicting the fate of poor Alex Potter, the stage holdup, and even the love scene between Farr and Ford.But this doesn't have the intensity and moral punch of The Ox-Bow Incident, one of the best Westerns of the 50s, hands down. Crime fiction fans may be interested to know that this film, 3:10 to Yuma, is actually based on an early novel by none other than crime fiction king Elmore Leonard, back in the days, about 50 years ago, when he was writing Western novels, believe it or not. (In fact he wrote about six or seven of them).This is a good but not great film.",3,"Solid Western, although not quite outstanding",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2795,"['Somewhat', 'more', 'dated', 'Western', 'same', 'time', 'Ox-Bow', 'Incident', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'solid', 'Western', 'real', 'flaws', 'certainly', 'not', 'have', 'cliched', 'good', 'guy-bad', 'guy', 'stereotypes', 'refreshing', 'are', 'peculiar', 'character', 'quirks', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'up', 'somewhat', 'sloppy', 'plotting.The', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'Glen', 'Ford', 'not', 'bad', 'shown', 'kind', 'love', 'scene', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'b', 'unusual', 'working', 'relationship', 'good', 'guy', 'played', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'Ford', 'leader', 'gang', 'who', 'stagecoaches', 'other', 'things', 'man', 'what', 'be', 'cold', 'blood', 'one', 'scene', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'harming', 'hair', 'head', 'Heflin', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'vicinity', 'time', 'holdup.As', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'Heflin', 'dough', 'real', 'bad', 'cattle', 'are', 'dying', 'drought', 'get', 'water', 'feed', 'order', 'survive', 'opportunity', 'dough', 'up', 'when', 'marshal', 'nearby', 'town', 'manages', 'capture', 'Ford', 'character', 'name', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'right', 'barmaid', 'played', 'comely', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'being', 'ahem', 'girlfriend', 'Heflin', 'character', 'job', 'escort', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Ford', 'train', '3:10', 'Yuma', ""'ll"", 'be', 'paid', 'nice', 'chunk', 'o', 'change', '200', 'be', 'exact.One', 'point', 'sloppy', 'plotting', 'part', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'So', 'OK', 'bye', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'ya', 'anymore', 'good', 'old', 'American', 'way', 'Yeah', 'chalk', 'up', 'kind', 'prescient', 'sense', '21st', 'century', 'America', 'something', 'why', 'exactly', 'Wade', 'shine', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'along', 'completely', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'fact', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Are', 'believe', 'sudden', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'really', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'instead', 'comply', 'law', 'just', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.The', 'ending', 'fairly', 'botched', 'love', 'interest', 'tossed', 'away', 'sack', 'old', 'potatoes', 'Other', 'though', 'lot', 'fine', 'moments', 'including', 'scene', 'depicting', 'fate', 'poor', 'Alex', 'Potter', 'stage', 'holdup', 'even', 'love', 'scene', 'Farr', 'Ford.But', ""n't"", 'have', 'intensity', 'moral', 'punch', 'Ox-Bow', 'Incident', 'one', 'best', 'Westerns', '50s', 'down', 'Crime', 'fiction', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'film', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'actually', 'based', 'early', 'novel', 'none', 'other', 'crime', 'fiction', 'king', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'back', 'days', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'writing', 'Western', 'novels', 'believe', 'not', 'fact', 'wrote', 'six', 'seven', '.This', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

Ford plays against type as the leader of a band of outlaws who hold up a stage and kill the driver. When Ford is captured by a posse, the focus of the film becomes keeping Ford's gang from freeing him before he can be put aboard the 3:10 train to Yuma to stand trial. When the owner of the stage line offers $200 to anyone that will guard Ford and get him safely aboard the train, Heflin takes him up on the offer. A battle of nerves and will ensues as Ford tries various ploys to get free before he can be put on the train.

The endings are different and the 2007 version earns its R rating with some very graphic violence but Crowe does a great job and it might be an Oscar nomination(s). Having seen both, I like the original. The story is about a hard working rancher/farmer (Van Heflin) who is down on his luck due to the drought and is barely supporting his wife and two young sons. He and his sons accidentally witness the robbery of a stagecoach and the murder of the coach driver. It's the infamous Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his ruthless gang. Wade is captured and the owner of the stagecoach line offers $200 to anyone who will guard Wade until they can put him on the 3:10 TO YUMA to take him back to prison from where he had escaped. Heflin, desperate for $200 after having been turned by the bank for a loan, sees this as an opportunity for the money and as a chance to prove himself to his wife & sons who he believes are disappointed in him. Alone together for almost 4 hours in a hotel room as they await the train there is a kind of mutual admiration as well as hatred. Heflin admires Wade for his material success and self confidence but despises his lack of morality. Wade admires Heflin for his family and moral character but sees him as weak and vulnerable and is totally confident in his ability to bribe Heflin to let him go as well as in his gang who will rescue. The tension builds until you hear the whistle of the 3:10 TO YUMA and Heflin must make his way against great odds from the hotel to the train station. In the tradition of HIGH NOON, this is a well acted and written movie. You can watch this one with the entire family unlike the Crowe version. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews. 11/18/2007.

366054,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,6303257348,Noirdame,"[7, 7]","The desolate backdrop of the old west , coupled with the wonderfully wistful title song (sung by Frankie Laine), gives this 1957 Columbia film an intriguing opening, one which the viewer cannot help but be absorbed. Van Heflin is Dan Evans, a rancher whose family is threatened by drought, and who is asked to bring notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) to Yuma to stand trial, for a sum that will undoubtedly help his financial problems. Wade's gang is jailed after committing a stagecoach robbery and killing, but they escape, planning to rescue their leader, so Dan must keep one step ahead of them as he escorts the handcuffed Wade to the train station. Felicia Farr has a nice supporting role as the bar girl, Emmy, who falls for Wade - Ford's villain knows how to charm the ladies, so much so that almost every woman falls under his spell. His engaging manner with the girls - ""What's a woman for, if you can't treat her right?"" - his romantic way of telling stories, almost literally makes the female population swoon. Even Dan's wife Alice (Lenore Dana) is temporarily taken with Wade as he sits, handcuffed, at the dinner table, telling a tale of a girl that he knew with sea-green eyes. Heflin can't understand why women fall for this - after all, this guy is a outlaw and a killer. As the two men arrive at the station town, Wade's gang is ready to pounce and so Evans and Wade hide out in a hotel room, the bridal suite, no less, to wait. Ben then plays mind games with Dan, trying to escape, to beat him down. Although Alice wants him to save himself by allowing Wade to escape, Dan realizes that he has to do it - not only for the money, but because it's the right thing to do. The two guys form a strange bond, as Ben's gang closes in. Had things been different, they may have even liked each other. Wade allows Dan to get him onto the train, explaining that he doesn't like to owe anyone any favors. There is a tentative understanding between them as Dan waves to his wife from the moving train, while the final chords of the title tune and Frankie Laine's voice close this psychological, fascinating Western.Ford's performance is just flawless; he embodies his redeemable bad guy effortlessly, whistling the title song throughout relatively quiet sequences. And he is cunning and manipulative, knowing what buttons to push, as he subtly degrades Dan for not being a good husband and father. Maybe it's my female perspective, but somehow I don't think I'd be immune to his penetrating gaze. After he and Farr engage in a passionate kiss, we see them a few moments later emerging from the back room of the saloon, fully clothed of course, but there can be no doubt of what had transpired between them. As he is taken away by Evans and the marshal, he promises to send her some pearls. Heflin gives just the right amount of selflessness, courage and compassion as the one who has to perform an unpleasant, risky task to support his family. These two underrated actors fill the screen, and it's hard to imagine any other leading men of the time bringing the protagonist and bad guy to life. An up and coming Richard Jaekel plays Wade's right hand, a fair-haired, cold-hearted sidekick who will stop at nothing to free his leader. He would later go on to have a succession of similar roles in several genres.

366057,A1MPPAKA7VJO3P,6303257348,Pop culture man,"[2, 2]","This fine movie fully deserves its reputation as a classic. Director Delmer Daves has created an engrossing, suspenseful study of character and values and drawn fine performances from all his leads.The heart of the film is an examination of cowardice. The Van Heflin character, Dan Evans, stands by as a gang, led by Glenn Ford's Ben Wade, robs a stage coach and cold-bloodedly murders the driver. Dan's sons and, later, his wife Alice (played by Leora Dana), ask why he didn't try to do something to stop the thieves.Later, Dan faces strong temptations to abandon his commitment to get Wade on the train to Yuma to face justice, but pursues his hard course, even though he expects that doing so will cost him his life. The script deals with these issues skilfully, putting believable words into the characters' mouths and avoiding preachiness.On repeated viewings of the movie, I have become more appreciative of Ford's performance. Watched closely, he goes beyond an apparently avuncular and unthreatening front so that a hardness and willingness to kill to get what he wants can be seen behind the smiles and smirks.Van Heflin's role is more straightforward but, as usual, he delivers convincingly as a good man made desperate by economic stress and nagging self-doubt about his courage. Set in a claustrophobic hotel room, the scenes between Ford and Van Heflin work well as the Ford character needles and pushes at Dan Evans, trying to tempt him into weakness.Leora Dana's performance as Dan's wife is a small glory of movie acting. Her face conveys so much of the weariness and desperate love of the character that the words she speaks seem almost superfluous. Understandably, the director sends the camera close in on her extraordinary face at every opportunity.Richard Jaeckel also plays well in his role as Wade's devoted and psychotic deputy.The exterior scenes have a gritty, dusty look, making you feel the drought that has blighted the efforts of Dan and Alice Evans to make their cattle ranch work.The film ends with a strong message that the future of the West lies in strong family values and hard work and that the highwaymen and their easy ways will not be the builders of a great nation. And goodness will be rewarded.This is a top class Western.",5,A true classic,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2265,"['fine', 'movie', 'fully', 'reputation', 'classic', 'Director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'created', 'engrossing', 'suspenseful', 'study', 'character', 'values', 'drawn', 'fine', 'performances', 'leads.The', 'heart', 'film', 'examination', 'cowardice', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'character', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'gang', 'led', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'stage', 'coach', 'cold-bloodedly', 'murders', 'driver', 'Dan', 'sons', 'later', 'wife', 'Alice', 'played', 'Leora', 'Dana', 'ask', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'something', 'stop', 'thieves.Later', 'Dan', 'strong', 'temptations', 'abandon', 'commitment', 'get', 'Wade', 'train', 'Yuma', 'face', 'justice', 'hard', 'course', 'even', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'cost', 'life', 'script', 'deals', 'issues', 'skilfully', 'putting', 'believable', 'words', 'characters', 'mouths', 'avoiding', 'preachiness.On', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'movie', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'appreciative', 'Ford', 'performance', 'Watched', 'closely', 'apparently', 'avuncular', 'unthreatening', 'front', 'so', 'hardness', 'willingness', 'kill', 'get', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'smiles', 'smirks.Van', 'Heflin', 'role', 'more', 'straightforward', 'usual', 'convincingly', 'good', 'man', 'made', 'desperate', 'economic', 'stress', 'nagging', 'self-doubt', 'courage', 'Set', 'claustrophobic', 'hotel', 'room', 'scenes', 'Ford', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'work', 'well', 'Ford', 'character', 'needles', 'pushes', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'trying', 'tempt', 'weakness.Leora', 'Dana', 'performance', 'Dan', 'wife', 'small', 'glory', 'movie', 'acting', 'face', 'conveys', 'so', 'much', 'weariness', 'desperate', 'love', 'character', 'words', 'seem', 'almost', 'superfluous', 'Understandably', 'director', 'camera', 'close', 'extraordinary', 'face', 'opportunity.Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'also', 'well', 'role', 'Wade', 'devoted', 'psychotic', 'deputy.The', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'have', 'gritty', 'dusty', 'look', 'making', 'feel', 'drought', 'blighted', 'efforts', 'Dan', 'Alice', 'Evans', 'make', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'work.The', 'film', 'strong', 'message', 'future', 'West', 'strong', 'family', 'values', 'hard', 'work', 'highwaymen', 'easy', 'ways', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'builders', 'great', 'nation', 'goodness', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded.This', 'top', 'class', 'Western']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

Top notch performances, an interesting dynamic between the central characters and plenty of suspense with few distractions along the way.  It's a classic that's held up quite well over 50 years later.As far as this Blu-ray goes, Criterion has done a respectable job here.  The wonderful 4K restoration was supervised by Sony's Grover Crisp last year to coincide with the film's entry into the National Film Registry.  Featuring superb detail that showcases the film's crisp cinematography, every visual aspect of ""3:10 to Yuma"" has been rendered flawlessly in 1080p.  A new 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is also included along with the original Mono mix, so purists and those looking for more surround activity will have their choice of presentations.The only slightly disappointing aspect of this release is its lack of meaty extras, somewhat atypical for a Criterion release.  Only a pair of short (10-15 minute) interviews with author Elmore Leonard and Glenn Ford's son are included, but they're entertaining and informative.

Don't know what took me so long but, obviously,  good things comes to he who waits.  ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a good, quality Western.  It isn't in the same category as ""High Noon"" but it stands tall on the next level.  What impressed me the most was the well-developed relationships that permeated the film.  Of course, the most impressive inter-action was between the Van Heflin and Glen Ford characters.  However, it seemed that just about every relationship was noteworthy as was the dialogue.  Kudos to actors, director, and writer.  The action was exciting yet not over done.  For example, there was a fair amount of gun fire but a minimal amount of fatalities.  That's something that's often overdone in the Western genre.  There was some romance but that was very well presented also.  The suspense was very real (the movie's title helps to enhance the suspense the same way ""High Noon"" helped to focus the suspense in that movie).  The ending had me a bit mystified but then I appreciated the way it turned around.I like a good Western and I'm glad to see there are some I missed the first time around (and THEN some in the case of ""3:10 to Yuma"").  It is a style of movie that is regularly overlooked at Oscar time except when the occassional Big Name actor stars in it.  Yet, when properly developed, it can bring together action, romance, suspense, humor (Gabby Hayes anyone?) and wrap it all up in a morality play about good and evil.

I like it more than the Russell Crowe version.  For me, monochrome format focuses attention on the dialog and the actors' expressions: There's no spectacular color to distract from these. Glenn Ford is at his quiet, calm, and powerful best in this movie. He's one of my favorite actors. The story line is very believable. It's a study of farm life in Arizona in the latter half of the 19th century and the hardships and desperation faced by farmers in those times.  It's also a study of two personalities: each one hard, determined, and pragmatic. In the end, each ends up respecting the other.  I think the agricultural theme plays a large role in this and it's interesting to watch it a second or third time from that perspective.  And that's what makes the movie a great one: it can be watched on several levels and from several perspectives.  It's also a good shoot-em-up too.

A remake of 3:10 to Yuma is on the horizon, and that will likely have viewers looking up this oft-neglected minor gem. It may look like a Western and quack like a Western, but there's a lot more to it than there is to your usual Western.The story concerns Ben Wade (The Big Heat's Glenn Ford), leader of an outlaw band who finds himself captured for the love of a woman. A local rancher, Dan Evans (Shane's Van Heflin), is down on his luck and in need of money; when the owner of a stagecoach line offers Evans enough money to irrigate his farm for the rest of the drought if he'll guard Wade until the authorities can put him on a train to Yuma prison, Evans can't jump fast enough. Thus begins a long, slow battle of wills between the two men-- slick, persuasive Wade and cynical, hardworking Evans. Sure, there's action. Tumbleweeds alone do not a Western make. But the real focus here is on the temptation of Dan Evans at the hands of Ben Wade. I'm almost tempted to compare it to Satan tempting Jesus on the cross-- the landscape does have a rather desolate Golgotha feel to it-- but I won't go quite that far.While the battle of wills is the main attraction, the side bits never get in the way of it, instead building on the main battle. The end result is a movie that looks like it's got a lot going on, but is actually almost obsessively single-minded. Not an easy feat to pull off. Daves did a fantastic job with this one, and it deserves to be remembered well. ****",4,Solid.,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1636,"['3:10', 'Yuma', 'Delmer', 'Daves', '1957', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'days', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'vehicle', 'Broken', 'Arrow', 'change', 'remake', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'horizon', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'viewers', 'looking', 'up', 'oft-neglected', 'minor', 'gem', 'may', 'look', 'Western', 'quack', 'Western', 'lot', 'more', 'usual', 'Western.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Big', 'Heat', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'leader', 'outlaw', 'band', 'who', 'captured', 'love', 'woman', 'local', 'rancher', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'Shane', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'down', 'luck', 'need', 'money', 'when', 'owner', 'stagecoach', 'line', 'offers', 'Evans', 'enough', 'money', 'irrigate', 'farm', 'rest', 'drought', ""'ll"", 'guard', 'Wade', 'authorities', 'can', 'put', 'train', 'Yuma', 'prison', 'Evans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'fast', 'enough', 'Thus', 'long', 'slow', 'battle', 'wills', 'two', 'men', 'slick', 'persuasive', 'Wade', 'cynical', 'hardworking', 'Evans', 'Sure', 'action', 'Tumbleweeds', 'alone', 'do', 'not', 'Western', 'make', 'real', 'focus', 'here', 'temptation', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'hands', 'Ben', 'Wade', ""'m"", 'almost', 'tempted', 'compare', 'Satan', 'tempting', 'Jesus', 'cross', 'landscape', 'have', 'rather', 'desolate', 'Golgotha', 'feel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'that', 'battle', 'wills', 'main', 'attraction', 'side', 'never', 'get', 'way', 'instead', 'building', 'main', 'battle', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'going', 'actually', 'almost', 'obsessively', 'single-minded', 'Not', 'easy', 'feat', 'pull', 'off', 'Daves', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'one', 'be', 'remembered', 'well', '****']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

During the holdup Wade shoots the stage driver and one of his own men who the driver was shielding behind. Dan, his boys and the stagecoach are relieved of their horses so they can't follow the gang. Wade and his gang stop for a drink at the saloon in the nearest town of Bisbee, Arizona pretending to be regular cowboys, they tell the townsfolk of the nearby holdup and all the men bar one take off to investigate.Wade stops on too long in town after he falls for pretty barmaid Emmy (Felicia Farr) and is captured by the returning townsfolk. The town marshal (Ford Rainey) and stage-line owner Mr Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) look for two volunteers to escort the prisoner to Contention City to catch the 3:10 to Yuma train and on to the territorial prison! With no volunteers Mr Butterworth offered $200 per volunteer Dan volunteered straight away this being just the right amount of money he needed to put him after three years of drought! The only other offer was from the town drunk Alex Potter (Henry Jones) which was reluctantly acceptedTo foil the following gang Wade is put on a stagecoach out of town but is removed during a fake coach break-down; here Wade is removed and taken to the Evans  ranch where Dan's wife Alice (Leora Dana) serves them supper. Dan and Alex sneak Wade away under cover of darkness reaching Contention by daybreak where Butterfield has arranged a hotel room for them whilst they secretly wait for the train.

In this taut western Ford plays the charismatic anti-hero Ben Wade. The reluctant hero in this instance going to the second lead the excellent Van Heflin as Dan Evans. A fine physiological western shot in black and white, often compared with HIGH NOON (1952) it also has an evocative theme song  written by George Duning and Ned Washington, the singer was Frankie Laine.Available from Amazon as a Special Edition and can also be found on Ebay and elsewhere in various forms, whatever this is a Great Western!",5,"Suspense filled, black & white Delmer Dave western as we wait for the 3:10 to Yuma",1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2680,"['1880', 'Arizona', 'Territory', 'rancher', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'are', 'searching', 'outer', 'limits', 'arid', 'ranch', 'lost', 'cattle', 'when', 'distance', 'see', 'Butterfield', 'stagecoach', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'infamous', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'gang', 'outlaws', 'using', 'Dan', 'cattle', 'block', 'stage', 'holdup', 'Wade', 'shoots', 'stage', 'driver', 'one', 'own', 'men', 'who', 'driver', 'was', 'shielding', 'Dan', 'boys', 'stagecoach', 'are', 'relieved', 'horses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'gang', 'Wade', 'gang', 'stop', 'drink', 'saloon', 'nearest', 'town', 'Bisbee', 'Arizona', 'pretending', 'be', 'regular', 'cowboys', 'tell', 'townsfolk', 'nearby', 'holdup', 'men', 'bar', 'one', 'take', 'off', 'investigate.Wade', 'stops', 'too', 'long', 'town', 'pretty', 'barmaid', 'Emmy', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'captured', 'returning', 'townsfolk', 'town', 'marshal', 'Ford', 'Rainey', 'stage-line', 'owner', 'Mr', 'Butterfield', 'Robert', 'Emhardt', 'look', 'two', 'volunteers', 'escort', 'prisoner', 'Contention', 'City', 'catch', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'train', 'territorial', 'prison', 'volunteers', 'Mr', 'Butterworth', 'offered', '200', 'volunteer', 'Dan', 'volunteered', 'straight', 'away', 'being', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'money', 'needed', 'put', 'three', 'years', 'drought', 'only', 'other', 'offer', 'was', 'town', 'drunk', 'Alex', 'Potter', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'was', 'reluctantly', 'acceptedTo', 'foil', 'following', 'gang', 'Wade', 'put', 'stagecoach', 'town', 'removed', 'fake', 'coach', 'break-down', 'here', 'Wade', 'removed', 'taken', 'Evans', 'ranch', 'where', 'Dan', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Leora', 'Dana', 'supper', 'Dan', 'Alex', 'sneak', 'Wade', 'away', 'cover', 'darkness', 'reaching', 'Contention', 'daybreak', 'where', 'Butterfield', 'arranged', 'hotel', 'room', 'whilst', 'secretly', 'wait', 'train', 'Tension', 'mounts', 'one', 'Wades', 'gang', 'come', 'town', 'one', 'one', 'Dan', 'supporters', 'disappear', 'including', 'Mr', 'Butterfield', 'odds', 'Dan', 'determined', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'going', 'put', 'Wade', '3:10', 'Yuma', '..Writer', 'director', 'Delmer', 'Daves', 'directed', 'many', 'other', 'fine', 'westerns', 'including', 'BROKEN', 'ARROW', '1950', 'LAST', 'WAGON', '1956', 'JUBAL', '1956', 'also', 'starred', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'taut', 'western', 'Ford', 'charismatic', 'anti-hero', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'instance', 'going', 'second', 'lead', 'excellent', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'fine', 'physiological', 'western', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'often', 'compared', 'HIGH', 'NOON', '1952', 'also', 'evocative', 'theme', 'song', 'written', 'George', 'Duning', 'Ned', 'Washington', 'singer', 'was', 'Frankie', 'Laine.Available', 'Amazon', 'Special', 'Edition', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'Ebay', 'elsewhere', 'various', 'forms', 'whatever', 'Great', 'Western']",3:10 to Yuma VHS
366064,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6303257348,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[5, 6]","Delmer Daves has certainly proved himself as one of Hollywood's most talented directors--at least in the Western genre... His ""3:10 To Yuma"" echoes ""High Noon"" in some respects, but to make frequent on the similarity misses the point of a very fascinating picture...""3:l0 to Yuma"" is a classic among suspense Westerns, a serious examination of the nature of heroism of an ordinary man in control of a dangerous outlaw... It is fundamentally a distinguished psychological drama played out in the claustrophobic setting of a hotel under mental and physical siege... The film deals with two entirely opposing characters locked together in an isolated room where Daves' camera moves ceaselessly on their course of action...After a holdup and the killing of a coachman with a gold shipmen, Ford is captured in a saloon, where he was wasting his time in amorous advances with a lovely barmaid (Felicia Farr).But how to hold him? For his gang, who have made their getaway, will most likely be back to claim him... Ford is sure of this, as his care-free indifference makes it easy to see... The cowed citizenry (echoes of the Zinneman picture) become equally certain... Someone has got to get him out of local circulation and then on to a train to Yuma where he can stand trial...Who will undertake such task?The best offer comes from an austere farmer motivated by a severe desperation... Struggling Heflin sees in the 200 dollars his last chance of salvation as his means of subsistence are too little, and the prolonged drought is killing his cattle... For him, there is no other option...So Ford expects his gang to follow him, and eventually they do... Richard Jaeckel--'the man who slept en the sofa' was how everyone remembered him in this picture--is sinister evidence of discovery...In a hotel room, therefore, they sweat it out... Van Heflin does most of the sweating, trying to cope, until the train is due, with a situation beyond his experience... For Van Heflin is not even a true professional, as Will Kane was in ""High Noon"" (who had somewhat similar train-waiting problems), but an amateur, having to deal with Ford's every physical and psychological ruse; having, in the last resort--finding some sort of moral obligation in the job--to resist temptation...The outlaw, an intelligent man, continually seeks for a way that will give him his freedom, but becomes deeply fascinated by his 'keeper'. What kind of creature is this who toils on some miserably piece of land, cares so deeply for it, gets no fun at all out of life and seems so greatly incorruptible?Whatever he is, he's the complete antithesis of Ford... You get the impression that the outlaw is confronted by a being from another planet... Who wouldn't be intrigued?Van Heflin could so easily have repeated his leading homesteader role in Shane, but, in fact, he adds another layer to him... Ford, in one of his best performances, and he has given many, gets the utmost from his greatest gift... The women in the picture, Felicia Farr and Leorna Dana, make a solid contribution to its depth...With a nice musical score, this great psychological Western draws its drama and power from the interaction of two excellent characters rather than gun blazing action...",4,"Tense, well-directed with excellent performances and atmosphere...",1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,3233,"['Delmer', 'Daves', 'certainly', 'proved', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'talented', 'directors', 'least', 'Western', 'genre', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'High', 'Noon', 'respects', 'make', 'frequent', 'similarity', 'point', 'very', 'fascinating', 'picture', '3', 'l0', 'Yuma', 'classic', 'suspense', 'Westerns', 'serious', 'examination', 'nature', 'heroism', 'ordinary', 'man', 'control', 'dangerous', 'outlaw', 'fundamentally', 'distinguished', 'psychological', 'drama', 'played', 'out', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'hotel', 'mental', 'physical', 'siege', 'film', 'deals', 'two', 'entirely', 'opposing', 'characters', 'locked', 'together', 'isolated', 'room', 'where', 'Daves', 'camera', 'ceaselessly', 'course', 'action', 'holdup', 'killing', 'coachman', 'gold', 'shipmen', 'Ford', 'captured', 'saloon', 'where', 'was', 'wasting', 'time', 'amorous', 'advances', 'lovely', 'barmaid', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'how', 'hold', 'gang', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'getaway', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'back', 'claim', 'Ford', 'sure', 'care-free', 'indifference', 'easy', 'see', 'cowed', 'citizenry', 'echoes', 'Zinneman', 'picture', 'become', 'equally', 'certain', 'Someone', 'got', 'get', 'local', 'circulation', 'then', 'train', 'Yuma', 'where', 'can', 'stand', 'trial', 'Who', 'will', 'undertake', 'such', 'task', 'best', 'offer', 'austere', 'farmer', 'motivated', 'severe', 'desperation', 'Struggling', 'Heflin', 'sees', '200', 'dollars', 'last', 'chance', 'salvation', 'means', 'subsistence', 'are', 'too', 'little', 'prolonged', 'drought', 'killing', 'cattle', 'other', 'option', 'So', 'Ford', 'gang', 'follow', 'eventually', 'do', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'man', 'who', 'slept', 'sofa', 'was', 'how', 'everyone', 'remembered', 'picture', 'sinister', 'evidence', 'discovery', 'hotel', 'room', 'therefore', 'sweat', 'out', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'most', 'sweating', 'trying', 'cope', 'train', 'due', 'situation', 'experience', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'not', 'even', 'true', 'professional', 'Will', 'Kane', 'was', 'High', 'Noon', 'who', 'had', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'train-waiting', 'problems', 'amateur', 'having', 'deal', 'Ford', 'physical', 'psychological', 'ruse', 'having', 'last', 'resort', 'finding', 'sort', 'moral', 'obligation', 'job', 'resist', 'temptation', 'outlaw', 'intelligent', 'man', 'continually', 'way', 'will', 'give', 'freedom', 'deeply', 'fascinated', ""'keeper"", 'What', 'kind', 'creature', 'who', 'miserably', 'piece', 'land', 'so', 'deeply', 'fun', 'life', 'so', 'greatly', 'incorruptible', 'complete', 'antithesis', 'Ford', 'get', 'impression', 'outlaw', 'confronted', 'being', 'planet', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'intrigued', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'repeated', 'leading', 'homesteader', 'role', 'Shane', 'fact', 'layer', 'Ford', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'given', 'many', 'utmost', 'greatest', 'gift', 'women', 'picture', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'Leorna', 'Dana', 'make', 'solid', 'contribution', 'depth', 'nice', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'psychological', 'Western', 'drama', 'power', 'interaction', 'two', 'excellent', 'characters', 'rather', 'gun', 'blazing', 'action']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

366066,A1G6KWTPVWLUS7,6303257348,R. Prokop,"[1, 1]","Wow. I've long been a fan of westerns - I must have more than 50 of them in my DVD collection. How in the world has this one escaped my attention for so long? Without question, one of the best of the genre I've ever seen. The performances of the principle actors, Glen Ford and Van Heflin, could not be improved. Ford as the weirdly contradictory bad man (simultaneously gentleman and cold-blooded murderer) and Van Heflin as the desperate small time cattle rancher willing to stake all to save his ranch and his family are unforgettable. Felicia Farr's role as the frustrated and lonely Emma, although all-too-brief, is flawless.The plot sets this movie squarely in the sub-genre of &#34;claustrophobic western&#34;, along with the likes of Rio Bravo and El Dorado, with the action largely restricted to the confined space of a hotel room, surrounded by bad guys. Other than the very end, this is not your typical &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; - it's deeply psychological, with the dramatic tension wound up almost to the breaking point. The &#34;action&#34; is largely interior. Just who is Ben Wade (Glen Ford)?

366067,A1ZKVLM2E00KNU,6303257348,Ryan Agadoni,"[7, 7]","I'm glad I saw the original first.  Short comparison: original is genuinely great; remake is merely good.Longer comparison: the original handles the hero and villain very differently from most movies, especially from that era. The bad guy isn't your typical villain. He has a sense of morality, but he's not a tragic villain, as would usually be the case. Very interesting character. The hero, too, acts from very human (fallen) motivations, and his ultimate choices make him that much more triumphant morally. The pacing and location shots also make this film stand out.The remake has a lot of good points, but any improvement over the original is superficial.  The costuming, casting, locations, and action scenes are all great and make for an entertaining picture.  But the real meat of the original story is watered-down in Mangold's version.The biggest change was the inclusion of Dan's kid in the story. In the original, it was sufficient to show his family's disappointment at his ranch and then leave him to wrestle with that on his own for the rest of the movie. Keeping the kid around the entire time artificially created a tension that wasn't as interesting or dramatic, because it took focus away from Dan and also diluted Dan's decision-making process. (If the kid is right there, there's much more pressure to ""do the right thing,"" and it makes his choice less about him having the courage to do what is right and more about ""well, can't look bad in front of the kid.""  The decision is more powerful in the original, where the only witness to it is Wade.)This hurts my favorite aspect of the original, that being the moral conflict between Wade and Dan. It's just not as well-executed in the remake. I really felt for Dan in the original, and you could clearly see this moral anguish going on in his head as Wade tortures him in the hotel room. It was profound stuff, and it comes off as forced and awkward in Mangold's version. Also, it's not as efficient in its storytelling. The real heart of the 1957 version centered entirely around waiting in the hotel room, which was the most interesting and provocative part of the story, while the 2007 version treated that scene like any other and just moved through it.Another (rather odd) negative aspect is Bale's physicality versus Van Heflin's. For whatever reason, Mangold made Bale scrawny, greasy, and weak-looking. You never once thought he could take Crowe in a fight. In the original, Van Heflin is physically bigger than Ford, and this makes his character that much more tragic. It's a minor detail, but it made me sympathize with him more. Here is a man who you can see once had the respect of others, who had control over his own destiny, and who has now lost the respect of his own family and has to beg for money. The physical difference tipping the other direction worked better for the conflict between Ben and Dan.All that being said, both are worth watching, but the original remains the only truly great Western of the two.Regarding the DVD: it's a fine transfer of a black-and-white classic.  No extras to speak of, but worth picking up.

Its beautifully shot in black and white and is presented in wide screen.

Full credit to the director Delmer Daves and the Cinematographer Charles Lawton Jr. This element of the film merits 5 stars.However, its not as good as High Noon, and had a few moments where I just didn't believe what was happening.

Turns out it was very well done, well directed, tight writing, artful delivery, great cinematography...  What I found most compelling about the film was the lead actors.  Bale tends to have pretty boy stamped on him in everything he does (though I think he's a fantastic actor), and as he plays a man quite truncated in his virility, I enjoyed seeing him act with such reserve.  He mastered understatement in this film, allowing subtler facets of his skill to come to the fore.  I do think he is creator to watch, and it's a pretty nice view to behold.  At the other end of the spectrum we have Crow, whom I've been impressed with but never truly blown away by.  Perhaps I am not so moved in this film either, but I was immensely impressed with Ben Wade.

366071,A26A64X86VL1R4,6303257348,Snowbrocade,"[15, 15]","310 to Yuma is a psychological western, adapted from a story written by the thriller expert Elmore Leonard, and filmed in beautiful black and white.  Glenn Ford and Van Heflin play the bad guy and the good guy, respectively, who are both struggling to survive in a barren land.  Ford's character is the leader of a notorious band of vicious, homicidal outlaws--a man who lives for the instinctive thrill of the moment.  Van Heflin is the cautious average guy who struggles to raise cattle in the middle of a drought and can't afford to pay for water rights until the rainy season.When Ford gets caught by the law, Van Heflin is paid to get him to the train which will take him to jail.  Ford works on Van Heflin to persuade him to let him go.  At times listening to the two conversing, it sounds like two sides of the same man dark and light, one arguing to let this cause go and live safely, the other that he must do what is right.  They illustrate the elemental struggle for all of us--do we live for the moment or resist the seduction of the physical comforts of life in order to develop our souls.  This psychological duel is mirrored in the visuals of the film with sharply contrasting sunlight and shadow.  In the climactic scene, the two run a gauntlet of gunslingers to the train, the 310 to Yuma.Ultimately the story is not one of good versus evil but the story of a man discovering his inner strength even if this means risking all he cares about.  Directing, cinematography and acting are all excellent.  Glenn Ford is particularly worth mentioning, playing the outlaw with creepy intensity.",4,Suspenseful psychological western!,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1603,"['310', 'Yuma', 'psychological', 'western', 'adapted', 'story', 'written', 'thriller', 'expert', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'respectively', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'survive', 'barren', 'land', 'Ford', 'character', 'leader', 'notorious', 'band', 'vicious', 'homicidal', 'outlaws', 'man', 'who', 'instinctive', 'thrill', 'moment', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'cautious', 'average', 'guy', 'who', 'raise', 'cattle', 'middle', 'drought', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'pay', 'water', 'rights', 'rainy', 'season.When', 'Ford', 'caught', 'law', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'paid', 'get', 'train', 'will', 'take', 'jail', 'Ford', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'persuade', 'let', 'go', 'times', 'listening', 'two', 'conversing', 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'man', 'dark', 'light', 'one', 'arguing', 'let', 'cause', 'go', 'live', 'safely', 'other', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'illustrate', 'elemental', 'struggle', 'do', 'live', 'moment', 'resist', 'seduction', 'physical', 'comforts', 'life', 'order', 'develop', 'souls', 'psychological', 'duel', 'mirrored', 'visuals', 'film', 'sharply', 'contrasting', 'sunlight', 'shadow', 'climactic', 'scene', 'two', 'run', 'gauntlet', 'gunslingers', 'train', '310', 'Yuma.Ultimately', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'story', 'man', 'discovering', 'inner', 'strength', 'even', 'risking', 'Directing', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'are', 'excellent', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'particularly', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'playing', 'outlaw', 'creepy', 'intensity']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[6, 6]","Director Delmer Daves' 3:10 TO YUMA (1957, Columbia) ranks with John Ford's STAGECOACH (1939) and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946) as one of the finest B&W; adult westerns ever made.  Told almost in real time, YUMA has Glenn Ford as an outlaw named Ben Wade being held hostage in a dusty old west town hotel room by farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin), who needs the money he is getting for the job.  That job is to guard Wade until the 3:10 to Yuma train arrives in town.  But Halsted Welles' complex script, from an Elmore Leonard story, has fun in switching roles.  Who is the good guy and who really is the bad guy?  And should Evans take Wade's offer to give him triple the amount of money that sheriff Robert Emhardt is offering Evans to led him go free?  After all, Evans is only in it for the money.  This is very suspenseful storytelling.  In a small cast, Felicia Farr is also excellent in a tiny role as a bartender.I really love the look of 3:10 TO YUMA--Charles Lawton, Jr.'s dusty moderate wide-screen B&W; photography, the sparce and empty town that seems to only have a saloon and hotel and train station, the real time editing, George Duning's ghostly music score, and Frankie Laine's unforgettably lonely theme song sung over the opening credits.

The story told is elegantly simple - bad man Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is separated from his gang and captured in a small southwestern town.  Small time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) is hired to guard Wade and get him onto the 3:10 train to Yuma, where he'll stand trial for robbery and murder.3:10 TO YUMA takes complex characters, puts them in an easily understood situation and allows a surprise or two to arise to test and challenge the characters.  Ben Wade may be a killer and a thief, a desperado, but as written by Leonard and played by Ford he's leagues away from the stereotypical western outlaw.  Early on in the movie Wade kills someone without hesitation and without remorse.  Oddly, though, he sees to it that the dead man is returned to his home for a proper burial.  Wade doesn't seem to particularly like killing, but it doesn't seem to bother him all that much, either.  Outwardly, he exudes a sincere, down-to-earth-charm with none of the shifty-eyed abrasiveness of most western bad men.  Ford, whose screen persona could encompass both charm and threat, is perfect in the role.  As is Heflin in the role of Dan Evans.  Heflin built a career out of portraying the thoughtful Everyman, the hard working, tough-luck-ridden yeoman who clung to his integrity long after whatever modest dreams of something better died.  Heflin is ideally cast as the principled small rancher who may have a sales price on his precious principles.  The backbone of 3:10 TO YUMA is the testing scenes between Heflin and Ford.  There are many of them, and they all crackle.The clock ticks down, Wade's gang - we assume - is gathering for a rescue attempt, and the good guys are beginning to sweat over their imaginings of the showdown at 3:10.

To make it even more enticing, I had never seen the old version.The heart of the story centers around a good man, desperate for money, who unwittingly becomes ensnared in the capture of an outlaw, and as part of his volunteering for the paid work, he must ""take the prisoner to the 3:10 to Yuma"". The interaction between the psyche of the two men makes for a remarkable tale . He knows only too well that his prisoner, even though shackled, is not entirely handicapped by that fact; is probably smarter than he is, and certainly more cunning, honed to a razor sharp edge by profession, and backed by a well-organized gang of scoundrels who are still on the loose.I rate this most excellent older movie 5 stars, even with a few oddities and the highly improbable ending.  (other than that, it had every possibility of having actually occurred somewhere back in time, which is one of the things I look for).I'm amazed I hadn't seen it before.  It has all the essential elements of an enduring Classic:  a well written, well chosen and unique story line; great casting, and splendid direction, enhanced by a smoldering moment or two between male and female without the graphics deemed so necessary now. (not knocking ""now"", just making the statement that physical emotion can be transmitted very successfully without the graphics, which, in my view took much more thought process and showcased the talent of this director,who brought the story to life through the well chosen cast and his ability to bring out the best in each of them.)I highly recommend this movie and encourage anyone watching it for the first time to look for all the details that set this one apart from the crowd.",5,3:10 to Yuma - comparing the old with the new version - in progress,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,2062,"['Maybe', 'own', 'Wyoming', 'roots', 'clouding', 'judgment', 'absolutely', 'love', 'GOOD', 'Western', 'especially', 'having', 'Southwest', 'settings', 'especially', 'Arizona', 'Old', 'Mexico', 'having', 'heard', 'tales', 'spun', 'mother', 'father', 'childhood.When', 'new', 'version', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'hit', 'previews', 'suddenly', 'realized', 'wanted', 'make', 'comparison', 'often', 'do', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'enticing', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'old', 'version.The', 'heart', 'story', 'centers', 'good', 'man', 'desperate', 'money', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'ensnared', 'capture', 'outlaw', 'part', 'volunteering', 'paid', 'work', 'must', 'take', 'prisoner', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'interaction', 'psyche', 'two', 'men', 'remarkable', 'tale', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'prisoner', 'even', 'shackled', 'not', 'entirely', 'handicapped', 'fact', 'probably', 'smarter', 'certainly', 'more', 'cunning', 'honed', 'razor', 'sharp', 'edge', 'profession', 'backed', 'well-organized', 'gang', 'scoundrels', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'loose.I', 'rate', 'most', 'excellent', 'older', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'even', 'few', 'oddities', 'highly', 'improbable', 'ending', 'other', 'had', 'possibility', 'having', 'actually', 'occurred', 'somewhere', 'back', 'time', 'one', 'things', 'look', '.I', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'essential', 'elements', 'enduring', 'Classic', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'chosen', 'unique', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'casting', 'splendid', 'direction', 'enhanced', 'smoldering', 'moment', 'two', 'male', 'female', 'graphics', 'deemed', 'so', 'necessary', 'now', 'not', 'knocking', 'now', 'just', 'making', 'statement', 'physical', 'emotion', 'can', 'be', 'transmitted', 'very', 'successfully', 'graphics', 'view', 'took', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'process', 'showcased', 'talent', 'director', 'who', 'brought', 'story', 'life', 'well', 'chosen', 'cast', 'ability', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'look', 'details', 'set', 'one', 'apart', 'crowd']",3:10 to Yuma VHS

366079,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,6303257348,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[22, 22]","3:10 to Yuma is an interesting blend of Western and Suspense, but more captivating still is its methodical examination of fleeting morals, blind justice, and the charismatic villain at the heart of the conflict.Notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) and his gang rob a stagecoach transporting significant funds of one Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt) and end up killing the driver in the process. Farmer Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his son are witness to the tragic events but are unable to help, save for notifying the authorities. When Dan returns home and his son explains the day's harrowing event, his wife appears disappointed by his apparent lack of courage, though his family's safety was foremost in his mind. When Dan is forced to go into town to borrow money for his farm's upkeep, he discovers that Ben Wade has stayed behind and the desperate farmer agrees to help apprehend the nefarious criminal. Upon Wade's capture, Butterfield employs Dan to guard the outlaw until 3:10 when the train to Yuma will arrive and take him to prison. But when Wade's gang arrives in town to free their leader, Dan will find that honor and dedication may only lead to an early grave.While 3:10 to Yuma may appear to be an action film, it is actually an intricate examination of character, both hero and villain, set against a suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in the old West. Van Heflin's protagonist represents the forces of good and parallels the difficulties present that don't always allow justice to prevail - at least not at first anyway. Honor and pride play an important role in Dan's decisions, as his wife's initial chagrin instigates his desire to bring Wade to justice. His belief in this subjective moral is so determinate that he even protects Wade from certain death just to attempt to deliver him to the law's judgement.As unique and interestingly obstinate as Dan's demeanor is, the villain of the film actually overshadows him in charisma and stage presence. Glenn Ford's portrayal of outlaw Ben Wade is one of the finest character studies in cinema, as he approaches the role with a full palette of emotions and intentions, complete with a similar belief in honor and morals that deceptively shifts as the film progresses. The opening scene finds Wade nonchalantly killing one of his own men when held hostage, and such dispassionate violence would lead one to believe the vilest of villains stands before him. However, the narrative follows Wade just as much as Evans and we discover he stays behind in the town of Bisbee to woo the young bartender Emmy (Felicia Farr). His presence is so captivating in fact that not only does he get the girl, but she seems completely unfazed to learn that he is the notorious Ben Wade. When the outlaw is captured by Evans, their witty back-and-forth banter often reveals Wade to be the more entertaining of the two and most often it's hard not to root for the bad guy. The final confrontation with Wade's gang cements what we'd been expecting all along - the line between heroes and villains is a thin one, at least in this engaging battle of wits and integrity.Though the plot is light on action, the story is heavy on suspense as Dan attempts to carry out his suicidal mission. Mind games replace gunplay and while the film's running time doesn't outstay its welcome, those expecting a nonstop shootout extravaganza may leave unsatisfied, while the film connoisseur will be delighted by the intricate character study. Reminiscent of deliberately paced suspenseful westerns like John Sturges' Bad Day at Black Rock and of course Fred Zinnemann's High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma deserves a place of its own in classic cinema for its daring antagonist and intent focus on the composition of heroism and the trials and tribulations it requires.- Joel Massie",4,3:10 to Yuma (1957) Movie Review,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,3799,"['3:10', 'Yuma', 'interesting', 'blend', 'Western', 'Suspense', 'more', 'captivating', 'still', 'methodical', 'examination', 'fleeting', 'morals', 'justice', 'charismatic', 'villain', 'heart', 'conflict.Notorious', 'outlaw', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'gang', 'stagecoach', 'transporting', 'significant', 'funds', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Butterfield', 'Robert', 'Emhardt', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'driver', 'process', 'Farmer', 'Dan', 'Evans', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'son', 'are', 'witness', 'tragic', 'events', 'are', 'unable', 'help', 'save', 'notifying', 'authorities', 'When', 'Dan', 'home', 'son', 'day', 'harrowing', 'event', 'wife', 'disappointed', 'apparent', 'lack', 'courage', 'family', 'safety', 'was', 'foremost', 'mind', 'When', 'Dan', 'forced', 'go', 'town', 'borrow', 'money', 'farm', 'upkeep', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'stayed', 'desperate', 'farmer', 'help', 'apprehend', 'nefarious', 'criminal', 'Wade', 'capture', 'Butterfield', 'Dan', 'guard', 'outlaw', '3:10', 'when', 'train', 'Yuma', 'will', 'arrive', 'take', 'prison', 'when', 'Wade', 'gang', 'town', 'free', 'leader', 'Dan', 'will', 'find', 'honor', 'dedication', 'may', 'only', 'lead', 'early', 'grave.While', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'action', 'film', 'actually', 'intricate', 'examination', 'character', 'hero', 'villain', 'set', 'suspenseful', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'old', 'West', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'protagonist', 'forces', 'good', 'difficulties', 'present', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'allow', 'justice', 'prevail', 'least', 'not', 'first', 'anyway', 'Honor', 'pride', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'Dan', 'decisions', 'wife', 'initial', 'chagrin', 'desire', 'bring', 'Wade', 'justice', 'belief', 'subjective', 'moral', 'so', 'determinate', 'even', 'Wade', 'certain', 'death', 'just', 'attempt', 'deliver', 'law', 'judgement.As', 'unique', 'interestingly', 'obstinate', 'Dan', 'demeanor', 'villain', 'film', 'actually', 'charisma', 'stage', 'presence', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'portrayal', 'outlaw', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'one', 'finest', 'character', 'studies', 'cinema', 'role', 'full', 'palette', 'emotions', 'intentions', 'complete', 'similar', 'belief', 'honor', 'morals', 'deceptively', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'finds', 'Wade', 'nonchalantly', 'killing', 'one', 'own', 'men', 'when', 'held', 'hostage', 'such', 'dispassionate', 'violence', 'would', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'vilest', 'villains', 'stands', 'However', 'narrative', 'Wade', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Evans', 'discover', 'town', 'Bisbee', 'woo', 'young', 'bartender', 'Emmy', 'Felicia', 'Farr', 'presence', 'so', 'captivating', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'girl', 'completely', 'unfazed', 'learn', 'notorious', 'Ben', 'Wade', 'When', 'outlaw', 'captured', 'Evans', 'witty', 'back-and-forth', 'banter', 'often', 'Wade', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'two', 'most', 'often', 'hard', 'not', 'root', 'bad', 'guy', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Wade', 'gang', 'cements', 'what', ""'d"", 'been', 'expecting', 'all', 'along', 'line', 'heroes', 'villains', 'thin', 'one', 'least', 'engaging', 'battle', 'wits', 'plot', 'light', 'action', 'story', 'heavy', 'suspense', 'Dan', 'attempts', 'carry', 'out', 'suicidal', 'mission', 'Mind', 'games', 'replace', 'gunplay', 'film', 'running', 'time', ""n't"", 'outstay', 'welcome', 'expecting', 'nonstop', 'shootout', 'extravaganza', 'may', 'leave', 'unsatisfied', 'film', 'connoisseur', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'intricate', 'character', 'study', 'Reminiscent', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'suspenseful', 'westerns', 'John', 'Sturges', 'Bad', 'Day', 'Black', 'Rock', 'course', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'High', 'Noon', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'place', 'own', 'classic', 'cinema', 'daring', 'antagonist', 'intent', 'focus', 'composition', 'heroism', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'requires.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",3:10 to Yuma VHS
366080,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6303257348,T O'Brien,"[10, 10]","3:10 to Yuma is an excellent pyschological western with a similar story to High Noon.  The leader of a gang is captured by a posse after a robbery and must be transported to another town so he can be moved on the train.  One of the local farmers, who is in desperate need of money, agrees to travel with him and watch him until he can be put on the train, the 3:10 to Yuma.  All along the way, the outlaw plays mind games with the farmer trying to manipulate him into letting him go.  There is plenty here for western fans.  The dialogue between Glenn Ford and Van Heflin is the best part of the movie as they go back and forth between them while Ford plays his mindgames on the unwilling hero, Heflin.Glenn Ford gives one of his best performances ever as Wade, the smooth-talking, calm, but ruthless gang leader.  His character is perfect for this role, and could not have been done any better.  Van Heflin is just as good as the poor farmer watching over Wade.  It is easy to see the anger inside of him as Wade continues to push his buttons as they wait for the train.  The rest of the cast includes many western actors, most notably Richard Jaeckel as Charlie, the right hand man of Wade who plays the slimy gunfighter throughout.  It is great to see this movie on DVD, which includes the widescreen presentation.

366084,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6303257348,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 3]","One of Delmar Daves' and Glenn Ford's best westerns, ""3:10 to Yuma"" began life as an Elmore Leonard short story (in fact it was the first one published). Criterion's Blu-ray gives us a beautiful looking transfer of the film--grain is a bit more heavy and prominent during the opening titles (not a surprise given that it would be several generations removed from the original negative and that it had to go through an optical printer to be rephotographed)but, once the film begins, film grain is consistent and not quite as bulky with a pleasing appearance that beautifully renders the black and white photography of the film.""3:10 to Yuma"" was made when Glenn Ford was at his peak as a box office draw and actor. Ford plays Ben Wade a charming but ruthless outlaw captured after he lingers in town a bit too long. Separated from his gang, he's arrested and, reluctantly, rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin in a perfect, performance that nicely captures his conflicted feelings)agrees to guard and escort Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma because he needs the money; his cattle are dying and his farm is failing because of a drought. Wade and Evans do form a bond with Wade trying to bribe Evans while he's guarding him and even assisting him as he develops a begruding respect for the rancher.What gets overlooked is Ford's brilliant, subtle performance (one of his best)--he makes Wade a complex character at a time when most westerns were more likely to simplify characters and their motives. In fact ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""High Noon"" are the two films that pushed Howard Hawks to make ""Rio Bravo"" because he wanted to return to a time of psychologically less complex characters (ignoring the complexity Hawks own ""Red River""). ""3:10 to Yuma"" holds up remarkably well and Ford is matched by the tortured performance by Van Heflin.As much as I enjoyed the remake with terrific performances from Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster, the original film is every bit its equal in my humble opinion--Daves develops a strong, psychological thriller that holds up surprisingly well. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is, at its heart, really about the time it was made in which critic and film historian Kent Jones does a nice job of summarizing in the booklet included with the Blu-ray.Aside from a terrific 4K restoration of the film, the mono soundtrack has been redone for a 5.1 surround mix. It's not something that will knock your socks off but the effort is appreciated as it opens up the sound a bit.One area this blu-ray does fall down is in the special features. Criterion normally has quite a bit of extras included with their releases (hence the steep price tag)unfortunately, that's not the case here.We do get two extensive interviews though which are exceptionally good; Glenn Ford's son and biographer Peter gives us a great interview where he discusses his dad's preference for western (because they had less dialog--as Peter paraphrases his dad, Glenn would say that he had two speeds as an actor--slow and slower--and how he would go through removing dialog from the script), as well as, Daves.Elmore Leonard discusses the genesis of the story, his opinions on both films made from it (the ending of the remake didn't make much sense to him for example)and gives a brief overview of his early Hollywood career related to ""Yuma"".The previously mentioned booklet is excellent.

Hancock,"[11, 11]","This Delmer Daves 1957 gem is a superlative piece of genre filmmaking that is not only better than its 2007 re-make, but is actually, in terms of writing, cinematography (crisp, sharp, moody black and white),pacing,editing, and character interaction, better than the vaunted ""High Noon"".Glenn Ford gives a riveting performance as the outlaw leader, ""Ben Wade"" (""Jim Kidd"" in the Elmore Leonard short story) that is almost reptilian in its sinister overtones. He could almost be the serpent in the Biblical Garden of Eden. Van Heflin also shines as ""Dan Evans"" (""Paul Scallen"", Leonard called him in the short story), an ""everyman"" small rancher of principle who takes on the job of putting Wade on the 3:10 to Yuma out of both a desire for much-needed reward money, but also out of a sense of personal resposibility to do what is right. It is more that factor than the other when Evans is told the money will be paid to him regardless.The simple precept of doing something because it is the right thing to do has basically become a concept of ""archaic silliness"" in the ""hip"" 21st century, so a whole new set of psychological motivations is applied to Dan's actions in the 2007 version, which weakens the product considerably in my estimation. I'll take this older version any day.Another great performance in the film is turned in by Richard Jaeckel, who was seemingly always portraying a half-nuts , kill-crazy gunman in westerns of the period, both theatrical releases and t.v. series westerns.Jaeckel's patented baddie is as readily identifiable here as ""Charlie Prince"" as he was earlier as Billy the Kid in ""Stories of the Century"" on t.v., or as Jesse Evans later in Duke Wayne's ""Chisum""...and in all spots during, after, and in between.This is a truly exceptional western that has had too much limited access for far too long.
