It not only stays true to the book, but does so in a highly engaging, emotionally rich way. Every scene was how I'd pictured it in my mind while reading the book. And I felt all the same feelings while watching this as I'd had while reading the book. I think sometimes special books really need a miniseries treatment to give them the length they deserve, and this was 2 1/2 hours of sheer enjoyment!My ONLY complaint is that I wish there had been at least one scene of Sara surrounded by all the school girls while telling one of her stories. The thing that drew the other girls to her the most was her imaginative, original storytelling, and she did this many times in the book but it was never shown in the film. In the book she was popular with all the girls; in this film she was more of a loner with only two friends at the school. Her storytelling was alluded to, but never shown.1995's versionA Little Princessis good as a standalone story, if you separate it from the book on which it was based.

This version is wonderful. It's long enough to be done right without losing it's focus. It has a strong story and is kind to the homeless. I was touched to see it. It was also true to it's self. What I mean by that is the story was not sugarcoated - a window in the life of a child that had been used poorly by fate with a kind heart nearby just a few doors away.,5,Kind and insightful,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,581,"['date', ""'m"", 'seen', 'Little', 'Princess', 'films', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'review', 'based', 'filmed', 'versions', 'not', 'trying', 'capture', 'story', 'book', 'think', 'tends', 'spoil', 'enjoying', 'good', 'film', 'version', 'wonderful', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'done', 'right', 'losing', 'focus', 'strong', 'story', 'kind', 'homeless', 'was', 'touched', 'see', 'was', 'also', 'true', 'What', 'mean', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'sugarcoated', 'window', 'life', 'child', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'poorly', 'fate', 'kind', 'heart', 'nearby', 'just', 'few', 'doors', 'away']",N/A
192409,A3R91AXWLU19N8,1577420411,DCGUY,"[3, 3]","This review is a comparison between the PBS Wonderworks/VHS version (which runs around 160 minutes, excluding the PBS promos for my 2 and 3 tape sets) with the London Weekend Television/DVD version that runs under 150 minutes.  Each version has its share of continuity issues, plot holes, and abrupt scene shifts.  I read portions of the book and, of course, many aspects of the book are not shown on either version.  Based on my subjective viewing of both video versions (without comparing either to the novel or with each other), I would have to go with the LWT/DVD version as being the better cut of the two.  The Wonderworks/VHS version (note that the first two scene omissions apply to the 3 VHS set only) cut out three scenes (two at the beginning and one near the end), that I felt took away from the continuity of the story development and created a major plot hole in the story.  The first one is the background behind the Emily doll.  There is no mention in the VHS version as to how it was obtained or when it was obtained.  Sara is just seen holding it in her arms as she travels in the carriage to her school.  The DVD version has a discussion between Sara and her father about the doll.  The second one is the scene just before Sara enters the classroom for the very first time.  The other students talk amongst themselves about the new pupil in the class and the viewer gets a chance to see which one of them would end up being a friend or rival to Sara.  The VHS version cuts straight from Sara's father's departure to everyone sitting in the classroom as Miss Minchin enters.  The third missing scene (which applies to both the 2 and 3 VHS cassette sets) near the ending is where Becky brings Sara's letter to Ermengarde that tells them all that she is rich again and is not returning back to the school.  The VHS version cuts straight from the party scene at the Carmichael residence to a scene with Becky crying going to her room.  The letter scene omission left a plot hole for the crying scene.  The final confrontation scene between Miss Minchin and Sara is abbreviated on the VHS version.  You are able to see the effect of a final comeuppance to Miss Minchin and Lavinia on the DVD version that is absent on the VHS version.  The ending scene with Anne (waif) and the baker's wife ends on a different note on the DVD version which I felt was a better one.  Also, I thought the beginning scenes in India ran a bit longer on the DVD version, so you got a better introduction to Sara and her father.  And lastly, the DVD six episodes are presented as it was shown on UK TV and ended each one at a logical point in the story.  The VHS version was based on a 3 episode group which combined two of the UK TV episodes into one continuous PBS/USA TV airing which felt too rushed and not allow the viewer to pause and consider the ending of what should have been one single episode.  So, from an overall aspect of the presentation (without having read the novel), I would recommend the LWT/DVD version. The Wonderworks/VHS tape (1, 2, or 3) versions are usually cheaper than the DVD version, so if cost is an issue, that version is still worth viewing (avoid the one tape version that is recorded in very slow speed and will display a blurred image).  The cost of the 3 VHS tape set (used) that I got from someone on Amazon was actually more than the DVD (new) cost from a merchant store for me.Other than my personal preference noted above, the story of Sara Crewe that relates to personal family tragedy and coping with it, is a worthwhile video program for any family library.*Update*  I have obtained a two VHS cassette version (apparently released after the three cassette version) and it has some of the scenes in the DVD version not seen on the three cassette version and also has scenes from the three cassette version not seen on the DVD.  So it looks like each release, whether DVD or VHS, has a different editing made to the program.  So the buyer's viewing experience on which scenes are on their product will vary.  It is a shame that there is no ""full unedited"" version that was released.  Based on my run time comparison, the two VHS tape set is about 7 minutes more than the three VHS tape set and 14 minutes more than the DVD version.*Update # 2* - run times for DVD is about less than 150 minutes, three VHS tape set is about 156 minutes and the two VHS tape set is about 162 minutes.",5,Comparison between the Wonderworks PBS/VHS version with the LWT/DVD version,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,4417,"['review', 'comparison', 'PBS', 'Wonderworks/VHS', 'version', '160', 'minutes', 'excluding', 'PBS', 'promos', '2', '3', 'tape', 'sets', 'London', 'Weekend', 'Television/DVD', 'version', '150', 'minutes', 'version', 'share', 'continuity', 'issues', 'plot', 'holes', 'abrupt', 'scene', 'shifts', 'read', 'portions', 'book', 'course', 'many', 'aspects', 'book', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'version', 'Based', 'subjective', 'viewing', 'video', 'versions', 'comparing', 'novel', 'other', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'LWT/DVD', 'version', 'being', 'better', 'cut', 'two', 'Wonderworks/VHS', 'version', 'note', 'first', 'two', 'scene', 'omissions', 'apply', '3', 'VHS', 'set', 'only', 'cut', 'out', 'three', 'scenes', 'two', 'beginning', 'one', 'end', 'felt', 'took', 'away', 'continuity', 'story', 'development', 'created', 'major', 'plot', 'hole', 'story', 'first', 'one', 'background', 'Emily', 'doll', 'mention', 'VHS', 'version', 'how', 'was', 'obtained', 'when', 'was', 'obtained', 'Sara', 'just', 'seen', 'holding', 'arms', 'carriage', 'school', 'DVD', 'version', 'discussion', 'Sara', 'father', 'doll', 'second', 'one', 'scene', 'just', 'before', 'Sara', 'enters', 'classroom', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'other', 'students', 'talk', 'new', 'pupil', 'class', 'viewer', 'chance', 'see', 'one', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'friend', 'rival', 'Sara', 'VHS', 'version', 'cuts', 'straight', 'Sara', 'father', 'departure', 'everyone', 'sitting', 'classroom', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'enters', 'third', 'missing', 'scene', 'both', '2', '3', 'VHS', 'cassette', 'sets', 'ending', 'where', 'Becky', 'Sara', 'letter', 'Ermengarde', 'rich', 'again', 'not', 'returning', 'back', 'school', 'VHS', 'version', 'cuts', 'straight', 'party', 'scene', 'Carmichael', 'residence', 'scene', 'Becky', 'crying', 'going', 'room', 'letter', 'scene', 'omission', 'left', 'plot', 'hole', 'crying', 'scene', 'final', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'Sara', 'abbreviated', 'VHS', 'version', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'effect', 'final', 'comeuppance', 'Miss', 'Minchin', 'Lavinia', 'DVD', 'version', 'absent', 'VHS', 'version', 'ending', 'scene', 'Anne', 'waif', 'baker', 'wife', 'different', 'note', 'DVD', 'version', 'felt', 'was', 'better', 'one', 'Also', 'thought', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'India', 'ran', 'bit', 'longer', 'DVD', 'version', 'got', 'better', 'introduction', 'Sara', 'father', 'lastly', 'DVD', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'was', 'shown', 'UK', 'TV', 'ended', 'one', 'logical', 'point', 'story', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'based', '3', 'episode', 'group', 'combined', 'two', 'UK', 'TV', 'episodes', 'one', 'continuous', 'PBS/USA', 'TV', 'airing', 'felt', 'too', 'rushed', 'not', 'allow', 'viewer', 'pause', 'consider', 'ending', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'single', 'episode', 'So', 'overall', 'aspect', 'presentation', 'having', 'read', 'novel', 'would', 'recommend', 'LWT/DVD', 'version', 'Wonderworks/VHS', 'tape', '1', '2', '3', 'versions', 'are', 'usually', 'cheaper', 'DVD', 'version', 'so', 'cost', 'issue', 'version', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing', 'one', 'tape', 'version', 'recorded', 'very', 'slow', 'speed', 'will', 'display', 'blurred', 'image', 'cost', '3', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', 'used', 'got', 'someone', 'Amazon', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'DVD', 'new', 'cost', 'merchant', 'store', 'me.Other', 'personal', 'preference', 'noted', 'story', 'Sara', 'Crewe', 'personal', 'family', 'tragedy', 'coping', 'worthwhile', 'video', 'program', 'family', 'library', '*Update*', 'have', 'obtained', 'two', 'VHS', 'cassette', 'version', 'apparently', 'released', 'three', 'cassette', 'version', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'version', 'not', 'seen', 'three', 'cassette', 'version', 'also', 'scenes', 'three', 'cassette', 'version', 'not', 'seen', 'DVD', 'release', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'different', 'editing', 'made', 'program', 'buyer', 'viewing', 'experience', 'scenes', 'are', 'product', 'will', 'vary', 'shame', 'full', 'unedited', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'Based', 'run', 'time', 'comparison', 'two', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', '7', 'minutes', 'more', 'three', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', '14', 'minutes', 'more', 'DVD', 'version', '*Update', '2*', 'run', 'times', 'DVD', 'about', 'less', '150', 'minutes', 'three', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', '156', 'minutes', 'two', 'VHS', 'tape', 'set', '162', 'minutes']",N/A
