1608217,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00AENNHOE,Andy Orrock,"[45, 52]","I looked up yesterday at my AA in-flight movie and saw that they were screening 'Robot & Frank.'  I immediately began buttonholing my seatmates: ""This is a really good movie."" I had the good fortune of catching it during its August 2012 big screen debut and thoroughly enjoyed it.We sought it out for two reasons.  First, my wife and I love Frank Langella.  [Pro tip: Check out the vastly underratedStarting Out In The Evening.]Second, I'd caught Mr. Langella talking most informatively about the film - and about his career on stage and screen - in an interview with Fresh Air's Dave Davies.  The best part: when asked why he chose to participate in the film, Langella told a fascinating story about getting sent the script, liking it, but feeling it didn't fully depict the challenges facing a man in his eighth decade.  He said that he asked for a meeting with director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford (both 30-ish) so he could tell them ""what [my seventies] feels like.""  Armed with that knowledge, they retooled the script to his liking and he took the role.The supporting casting is as good as Langella.  I like James Marsden in everything he does.  He and Liv Tyler make a very believable brother-sister pair.  They could be real-life siblings...and imagining them as the offspring of Langella isn't a stretch either.  I can't delve any further into their on-screen parentage without ruining the movie's last-reel reveal.  It's well worth 89 minutes of your day spending time with this family.One final word: seen, but not heard, is Peter Sarsgaard, voice of Langella's servant/robot.  He's not just reading words: he inhabits that robot.  It's a brilliant vocal performance.",5,Well worth 89 minutes of your day spending time with Robot & Frank...Langella,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1695,"['looked', 'up', 'yesterday', 'AA', 'in-flight', 'movie', 'saw', 'were', 'screening', ""'Robot"", 'Frank', 'immediately', 'began', 'buttonholing', 'seatmates', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'catching', 'August', '2012', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'it.We', 'sought', 'out', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'wife', 'love', 'Frank', 'Langella', '[', 'Pro', 'tip', 'Check', 'out', 'vastly', 'underratedStarting', 'Out', 'Evening', ']', 'Second', ""'d"", 'caught', 'Mr.', 'Langella', 'talking', 'most', 'informatively', 'film', 'career', 'stage', 'screen', 'interview', 'Fresh', 'Air', 'Dave', 'Davies', 'best', 'part', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'chose', 'participate', 'film', 'Langella', 'told', 'fascinating', 'story', 'getting', 'sent', 'script', 'liking', 'feeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'depict', 'challenges', 'facing', 'man', 'eighth', 'decade', 'said', 'asked', 'meeting', 'director', 'Jake', 'Schreier', 'writer', 'Christopher', 'D.', 'Ford', '30-ish', 'could', 'tell', 'what', '[', 'seventies', ']', 'feels', 'Armed', 'knowledge', 'retooled', 'script', 'liking', 'took', 'role.The', 'supporting', 'casting', 'as', 'good', 'Langella', 'James', 'Marsden', 'everything', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'make', 'very', 'believable', 'brother-sister', 'pair', 'could', 'be', 'real-life', 'siblings', 'imagining', 'offspring', 'Langella', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'delve', 'further', 'on-screen', 'parentage', 'ruining', 'movie', 'last-reel', 'reveal', 'well', 'worth', '89', 'minutes', 'day', 'spending', 'time', 'family.One', 'final', 'word', 'seen', 'not', 'heard', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'voice', 'Langella', 'servant/robot', 'not', 'just', 'reading', 'words', 'robot', 'brilliant', 'vocal', 'performance']",Robot and Frank

1608245,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00AENNHOE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","From former film school students at the New York University Tisch School of Arts, director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford have said to each other that they would work on a project.  And  in 2008, the two would collaborate for the  film ""Robot & Frank"", the winner of the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at Sundance 2010.Inspired by a story from Japan about caretaker robots being produced in Japan and the rapid development of technology, Schreir had started the story for ""Bob & Frank"" as far back as 2000.  In order to make the technology work for the film, the two would work with the company Alterian for the use of an actual robot for the film and smartphones and tables for the future were design by Tumblr's Justin Ouellette.With only 20 days to shoot and 2.5 million dollars for the budget, the film received positive reviews from film critics and now ""Robot & Frank"" will be released on DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Robot & Frank"" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio is presented in English, Portuguese and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Picture quality is good, while most of the film is shot indoors. Lighting is well-done and no low level noise is seen, which is good.  But overall picture quality for the film is good, no major artifacts or visual problems during my viewing.  Dialogue is clear and understandable.  The main soundtrack is center and front-channel driven which is appropriate for this type of film. For the most part, video and audio are very good as one can expect on DVD.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Robot & Frank"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - A fascinating audio commentary featuring director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher Ford who discuss the casting of the film but also how they came up with the concept and more.Robot Poster Campaign Gallery - A gallery of posters promoting ""Robot & Frank"".JUDGMENT CALL:""Robot & Frank"" is a clever film and an interesting take of the not-so-distant future of robotic caretakers and a bond between an elderly and a robot.We have seen film about the disconnect between families, especially children and their elders.  Especially those who can't deal with the pressure of having a sick parent who is suffering from Alzheimer's, especially dementia.But this is not one of those film's that tries to drive morality or immorality to audiences.  It's a heartfelt film about an aging father who knew he wasn't their for his children because of past mistakes.  He was a famous cat burglar who served his time, missed out on his children's years of growing up while incarcerated.  And now he's an old man that is suffering from dementia, but part of him feels there is nothing wrong.His children are now older, have busy careers, have their own families and they can't be with him 24/7 but knowing his condition, they want to put him in a nursing home, which Frank refuses.  So, for Hunter, the only son, he decides to purchase a caretaker robot for his father.But the robot is programmed to keep the father, Frank and his health and happiness as a priority.  The robot can learn and adapt to what Frank teaches it, but when Frank wants to feel relevant in this world, he goes back to wanting to steal.And when Frank realizes that he can teach his new friend, a robot, to take part in crimes, but for a lonely man, he realizes that this robot is his only true friend.  One that will not hurt him intentionally, one that is not human, so it really doesn't understand the conundrums that humans may face.But we see Frank being dependent on his new friend and what happens when his daughter Madison stops by to stay with him and deactivates the robot, especially during a time when Frank and his robot have planned a major heist.Frank Langella does an amazing job of playing the character of Frank.  A man who feels he is perfectly fine, but deep inside, he is a man full of regret, lonely and feels that his life was exciting when he was a cat burglar.Susan Sarandon also plays a pivotal part in the film and we eventually get to see the importance of her character right at the end of the film.  But as always, a talented actress and both she and Langella are great in the film!And we also have James Marsden as the son who wants to get close to his father, but at the same time, isn't so close because of his father's past incarceration.  While, Liv Tyler plays the caring daughter who wants to see her father happy but without the use of a robot.  And last, you also get Peter Saarsgard as the voice of the robot.For the most part, everything works well with this film.  While the robot was created for the film, the movements internally were done by a dancer named Rachel Ma, who had to be fitted inside the robot.  And for the most part, the movements seemed right and believable, not fake.While some parts of the film, may seem a bit farfetched (especially when it comes to the police who suspect Frank for the thefts), fortunately those scenes are small enough to not distract from the film.  It's a cleverly written film about aging, life's regrets and friendship.  And director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher Ford manages to pull things off!The DVD for ""Robot & Frank"" looks good as one can expect from a DVD, but no worries of major artifacts or any picture quality or audio problems. Dialogue is clear and the DVD comes with an audio commentary by director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher Ford plus a robot poster campaign gallery.Overall, ""Robot & Frank"" is a film that is touching and also fascinating.  It's a film with a story that depends on its talent to make the film seem believable and fortunately, Frank Langella's performance makes this film worth its while.""Robot & Frank"" is recommended!",4,"""Robot & Frank"" is a film that is touching and also fascinating.

1608254,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00AENNHOE,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","This modestly budgeted, limited release caught me by surprise. I had little expectation going in so it turned out to be a touching yet fun time.Here's the scoop. Set in the future, Frank (Frank Langella) is an aging cat burglar living in upper state New York. His mind is going so his son (James Marsden) buys him a robot to take care of him. Frank soon realizes he can use the robot to help him pull off jobs. This leads to some interesting revelations.This has a good plot where the old is balanced with the new. Frank is an incessant reader and borrows books from the local library regularly. But the library will quit loaning books because they are converting all to computer files. He's attracted to the librarian (Susan Sarandon), another book lover, but is having a hard time making the connection. Then there's the robot. Most son'e would have hired a human caretaker. He's unwavering in his duty to make certain Frank eats right and does things that will help him live longer and happier. Franks hates him right off the bat but, as the robot is with him 24/7 Frank cannot help but build a relationship with him. He might not want to but it builds slowly over a long period of time.I like the setting. Upper state New York is pretty. There's a lot of green and rain so it has a good look to it. The actors must have wanted to do this project because the reported budget was $2,500,000.

1608258,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AENNHOE,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Look up the background of writer Christopher D. Ford and director Jake Schreier and be surprised that in many ways this beautifully sculpted little film is a first serious outing.  The story is so well crafted, the direction so beautifully underplayed that this becomes an instant cinematic masterwork - albeit of the quiet, soulful, ruminative nature. The fact that it just happens to be populated with a brilliant cast who care more about being immersed in their characters than in the spotlight adds to the fact that this is a film everyone should experience.The place is upstate New York, the time is in the near future. Frank (Frank Langella, utterly luminous in this role) is a retired, independent but brain aging (read encroaching dementia) thief/catburglar living alone in a cluttered little house while his successful son, Hunter (James Marsden), tries to care for him from afar (it is a 10 hour journey for Hunter to look in on his father every week). Hunter finally gets Frank a robot caretaker - an interference Frank loathes. Frank also has world traveling and anti-robot daughter Madison (Liv Tyler) who moves in when she discovers that a robot is running her father's life. Frank's only area of peace is the little public library run by a compassionate librarian Jennifer (Sarah Sarandon) who understands Frank's growing senility and his robot caretaker as she is facing the closure of her `book haven' by the new Internet advanced cold company headed by Jake (Jeremy Strong). Frank may not be able to communicate well with his blood family, but he grows into a relationship with his robot (voiced to perfection by Peter Sarsgaard) and soon confides his past as a jewel thief who only stole to get back at crooked insurance companies. Frank soon learns that his robot comrade is useful as a burglary aide. As Frank tries to restart his old profession, the uncomfortable realities of a changing world and his worsening dementia threaten to take beyond what any reboot can do for him. The plot is gently complex and how the film plays out is the beauty of seeing the film firsthand.  Suffice it to say this is a film about the variations of family and how plausibly aging and caregiving may be changed in the next few years, with the influx of technology and the possibilities for in-home care with robots.The cast is strong (including a minor role by Jeremy Sisto), but the performances by Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon are especially rare and transcendent. This little unknown film is the kind of parable that allows us to see life as it is and could be in an intelligent and thoughtful way.

The robot itself is simple, yet plausible.  It's obviously a short person in a suit but I did buy that it was indeed a robot when watching the film.The movie revolves around the relationship between an elderly man who probably has Alzheimer's or Dementia or something like this who doesn't really want to accept or believe his condition, and his adult children. They want to do what's best for him but simply don't know what to do being he won't let them move him to a nursing home.  So his children are constantly worried about his safety and welfare and the only solution the son can come up with is to buy him an expensive care Robot (which he tells his father is a butler).  The robot knows his medical history and monitors his current state. It follows him everywhere in the house and out of it and also pesters him to eat right and to do things for his own good that the elderly man doesn't want to.  It also cleans the house, makes meals, phone calls and does daily task things.  Frank doesn't like the existence of the robot in his life, so therefore doesn't like it.  However eventually it becomes somewhat of a comfort companion wise, and when it steals something he had ditched when accused of shoplifting (something he does every time he goes into town) as it didn't understand the concept of theft, Frank knows the robot may be quite useful and convinces it a more productive hobby for his mind would be to plan a heist.A slow paced film, but an enjoyable one none the less.",4,Low Budget Film But Does a Good Job Telling the Story,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,2193,"['low', 'budget', 'film', 'core', 'part', 'plot', ""n't"", 'affected', 'lack', 'budget', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'especially', 'when', 'Frank', 'left', 'house', 'assuming', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'simply', 'change', 'so', ""n't"", 'have', 'mod', 'cons', 'home', 'future', 'where', 'existence', 'robot', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'functioning', 'especially', 'mobility', 'old', 'guy', 'house', 'stairs', 'was', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'when', 'rest', 'world', ""n't"", 'changed', 'fact', 'cars', 'shops', 'everything', 'seem', 'little', 'dated', 'especially', 'library', 'know', 'more', 'functioning', 'museum', 'still', 'libraries', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'quite', 'few', 'decades', 'certainly', 'not', 'lifetime', 'robot', 'simple', 'yet', 'plausible', 'obviously', 'short', 'person', 'suit', 'did', 'buy', 'was', 'indeed', 'robot', 'when', 'watching', 'film.The', 'movie', 'relationship', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'probably', 'Alzheimer', 'Dementia', 'something', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'accept', 'believe', 'condition', 'adult', 'children', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'being', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'move', 'nursing', 'home', 'children', 'are', 'constantly', 'worried', 'safety', 'welfare', 'only', 'solution', 'son', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'buy', 'expensive', 'care', 'Robot', 'father', 'butler', 'robot', 'medical', 'history', 'monitors', 'current', 'state', 'everywhere', 'house', 'also', 'pesters', 'eat', 'right', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'good', 'elderly', 'man', ""n't"", 'want', 'also', 'house', 'meals', 'phone', 'calls', 'daily', 'task', 'things', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'like', 'existence', 'robot', 'life', 'so', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'like', 'However', 'eventually', 'somewhat', 'comfort', 'companion', 'wise', 'when', 'something', 'had', 'ditched', 'when', 'accused', 'shoplifting', 'something', 'time', 'town', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'concept', 'theft', 'Frank', 'robot', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'useful', 'more', 'productive', 'hobby', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'plan', 'heist.A', 'slow', 'paced', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'none', 'less']",Robot and Frank

1608283,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00AENNHOE,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 1]","I discovered this movie purely by chance while browsing Amazon one day, and being a rather stupidly big robot fan I decided to give it a look.  It looked like it had the potential for a lot of cuteness and humor by the premise alone, and even if I had to suspend my disbelief a bit to accommodate for such an advanced robot wandering around the movie I figured it would be worth it.  I was rather surprised to see that this movie had quite a few big names for being an indie movie (or at least names that were big at one time), but I've seen some very good indie movies over the years and figured that this one would be worth a shot.I wish I'd read some of the reviews for this before diving in.  Because while it's a touching story and is indeed humorous in places, it wasn't what I was expecting.  And I think advertising it as a comedy on the back cover is rather misleading.Frank (Frank Langella) is a retired cat burglar who lives alone -- divorced, bitter, cantankerous, and his memory slowly degrading with time.  While his activist daughter (Liv Tyler) worries about his welfare from a distance, his son (James Marsden) gets tired of having to check up on him all the time and gets him a robot assistant.  At first Frank resents his new robot companion, and resists all its efforts to improve his life and get him healthy and active.  But when he discovers his mechanical companion has a knack for thievery, he decides to make good use of its talents, and soon he and the robot are planning and executing heists together, especially targeting a yuppie tech-head with plans to revamp the local library.  His schemes end up getting the two of them into trouble, however... and his burgeoning relationship with the local librarian further complicates things...I really wanted to like this movie.  It does have humorous moments, the robot is quite likable, and the acting is generally strong.  The sci-fi elements in the film, such as the robot assistants and the telecommunications screens, feel a bit out of place (there's sort of an '80s vibe to the rest of the setting), but they're nothing outlandish compared to today's technology, and I was willing to accept them as part of the story.  And it's a thoughtful, if heartbreaking, look at dementia and how it impacts families.But... again, I feel like I came into this movie expecting something different than I got.  The back of the DVD suggests a comedy, and while the film has its humorous moments, the rest of it can come across as sad, even bleak.  Frank is so bitter and cantankerous it can be hard to like him, and his son's bitter disdain toward him makes him even more unlikable.  The daughter is a generic activist sort who has little impact on the movie, the town librarian is a bland character, and the tech-head who's the target of one of Frank's heists is a one-note character who seems to have been written as unsympathetic solely so this movie can have a villain.  When the most likable character in the movie is the robot -- and not even a sentient one like in ""Short Circuit"" or ""WALL-E"" -- you know you're in trouble.There's also a sudden twist that comes along in the last ten minutes of the movie that feels incredibly jarring to me.  I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say that it came on rather suddenly, seemingly without foreshadowing, and far too late in the movie to have any real impact on the story.  Perhaps I was simply oblivious and didn't see the foreshadowing, but still, the twist felt like a weird gimmick instead of something genuinely affecting.The ending for this film is also somewhat depressing, a bleak note in what was trying to be an uplifting story.  Again, I won't spoil any more than I already have, but it certainly won't leave many people with warm fuzzies.I guess a lot of the problem is me -- I went into this movie expecting something different than I got.  But still, the back of the case had me expecting something funny and cute, and I got something depressing instead.  I'd recommend it if you want something thoughtful and honest rather than comforting and heartwarming, but if you're looking for a cute movie about a robot companion, go for ""Short Circuit"" instead.",3,"Premise is cute and funny, but actual movie is surprisingly depressing",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,4182,"['discovered', 'movie', 'purely', 'chance', 'browsing', 'Amazon', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'rather', 'stupidly', 'big', 'robot', 'fan', 'decided', 'give', 'look', 'looked', 'had', 'potential', 'lot', 'cuteness', 'humor', 'premise', 'alone', 'even', 'had', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'bit', 'accommodate', 'such', 'advanced', 'robot', 'wandering', 'movie', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'see', 'movie', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'big', 'names', 'being', 'indie', 'movie', 'least', 'names', 'were', 'big', 'one', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'good', 'indie', 'movies', 'years', 'figured', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'shot.I', 'wish', ""'d"", 'read', 'reviews', 'diving', 'touching', 'story', 'indeed', 'humorous', 'places', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'think', 'advertising', 'comedy', 'back', 'cover', 'rather', 'misleading.Frank', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'retired', 'cat', 'burglar', 'who', 'alone', 'divorced', 'bitter', 'cantankerous', 'memory', 'slowly', 'degrading', 'time', 'activist', 'daughter', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'welfare', 'distance', 'son', 'James', 'Marsden', 'tired', 'having', 'check', 'up', 'time', 'robot', 'assistant', 'first', 'Frank', 'resents', 'new', 'robot', 'companion', 'efforts', 'improve', 'life', 'get', 'healthy', 'active', 'when', 'mechanical', 'companion', 'knack', 'thievery', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'talents', 'soon', 'robot', 'are', 'planning', 'executing', 'heists', 'together', 'especially', 'targeting', 'yuppie', 'tech-head', 'plans', 'revamp', 'local', 'library', 'schemes', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'two', 'trouble', 'however', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'local', 'librarian', 'further', 'complicates', 'things', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'have', 'humorous', 'moments', 'robot', 'quite', 'likable', 'acting', 'generally', 'strong', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'film', 'such', 'robot', 'assistants', 'telecommunications', 'screens', 'feel', 'bit', 'place', 'sort', ""'80s"", 'vibe', 'rest', 'setting', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'outlandish', 'compared', 'today', 'technology', 'was', 'willing', 'accept', 'part', 'story', 'thoughtful', 'heartbreaking', 'look', 'dementia', 'how', 'families.But', 'again', 'feel', 'came', 'movie', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'got', 'back', 'DVD', 'comedy', 'film', 'humorous', 'moments', 'rest', 'can', 'come', 'sad', 'even', 'bleak', 'Frank', 'so', 'bitter', 'cantankerous', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'like', 'son', 'bitter', 'disdain', 'even', 'more', 'unlikable', 'daughter', 'generic', 'activist', 'sort', 'who', 'little', 'impact', 'movie', 'town', 'librarian', 'bland', 'character', 'tech-head', 'who', 'target', 'one', 'Frank', 'heists', 'one-note', 'character', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'unsympathetic', 'solely', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'villain', 'When', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'movie', 'robot', 'not', 'even', 'sentient', 'one', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'WALL-E', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble.There', 'also', 'sudden', 'twist', 'along', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'jarring', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'say', 'came', 'rather', 'suddenly', 'seemingly', 'foreshadowing', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'movie', 'have', 'real', 'impact', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'simply', 'oblivious', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'foreshadowing', 'still', 'twist', 'felt', 'weird', 'gimmick', 'instead', 'something', 'genuinely', 'affecting.The', 'ending', 'film', 'also', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'bleak', 'note', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'uplifting', 'story', 'Again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'more', 'already', 'have', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'many', 'people', 'warm', 'fuzzies.I', 'guess', 'lot', 'problem', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'got', 'still', 'back', 'case', 'had', 'expecting', 'something', 'funny', 'cute', 'got', 'something', 'depressing', 'instead', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'want', 'something', 'thoughtful', 'honest', 'rather', 'comforting', 'heartwarming', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cute', 'movie', 'robot', 'companion', 'go', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'instead']",Robot and Frank

1608294,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00AENNHOE,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Standout, hilarious, touching, and thoroughly engrossing indie gem. A wonderfully rich film exploring the nature of companionship and the essential spirit of humanity.It's the near future and Frank is suffering with Alzheimers. As his life closes in on twilight, his mind begins to betray him - forgetting a favorite restaurant having closed years ago, an ex-wife he no longer has, a middle-aged child he thinks still attends college. His one sole solace and anchor to the real world is the old bookshelf filled library; a place of continuity that is unceremoniously swept away under the guise of progress by the self-absorbed pretentious prigs of the world. Unsurprisingly, with so-called Millennials aka Generation Me, growing up in the sick social experiment of inflated and unearned self-esteem; unapologetic arrogance having sadly supplanted genuine self-confidence. We're now stuck with an astounding and frighteningly large glut of these types today.Now, with nothing to impede the terrible progress of the disease, Frank slowly rots in a world growing less recognizable with each passing moment.His two children try their supportive best, but they have their own lives to lead. A daughter, constantly traveling the world chasing her various causes and charities, berates a stateside sibling for not taking more time with their dad. And a son whose frustration boils over when his old man refuses to entertain a suggestion of relocating to a ""rejuvenation center"", a blend of med facility and retirement community/hospice; anything closer in proximity to his own home and family.No thanks. Frank's not having any of that. As the stalemate worsens, his son brainstorms an idea. A robot. Around-the-clock care and he doesn't have to make the weekly ten hour round-trip journey to fulfill his filial duty. Perfect.Or not.Obviously, Frank's not a happy camper. Quite the curmudgeon - the thought of living with a walking, talking, overgrown microwave oven with arms has no appeal. In fact, he's insulted. But left with no choice, he's forced to take it on. And after repeated attempts to mock, humiliate, and crush the animated assistant - even he recognizes that his life and memory are improving under its care.Their time together paralleling each others lives; of selective memories and the choice to meet one's final&eacute; on your own terms. Simultaneously exploring the depth of friendship; the factors of what makes up being a buddy - a true friend. To me, there was an echo of 'Cast Away' in the script - a lonely soul whose desperate need to socialize overcomes his better sense, coalescing into an imaginary bud whose physical essence is a deflated volleyball. This film takes a similar idea and brilliantly expands on it.Then, just when you have the screenplay all figured out - a twist. A most delicious surprise occurs midway through the screenplay. I won't spoil it.Sincerely one of the most tender and soulful films I've screened in a very long time. And, for a cinephile, one of the greatest joys one can receive is a completely unexpected experience.Absolutely five stars.Movie Recommendations:- If you enjoyed this film may I suggest checking out '$5 a Day' with Christopher Walken and Alessandro Nivola.- Also consider the lighthearted 'Maiden Heist' with a trio of screen legends Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman and William H. Macy.Personal Notes:- Why this wasn't noticed by the big award committees is a mystery - a pathetic one. Because this was a subtle and powerful film filled with genuinely amazing performances. It and Frank Langella honestly deserved much more recognition.- It was only after the film had concluded that I was stunned to learn the voice of Robot was not John Malkovich.",5,"""It's time for your enema.""",1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,3722,"['Standout', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'thoroughly', 'engrossing', 'indie', 'gem', 'wonderfully', 'rich', 'film', 'exploring', 'nature', 'companionship', 'essential', 'spirit', 'humanity.It', 'near', 'future', 'Frank', 'suffering', 'Alzheimers', 'life', 'closes', 'twilight', 'mind', 'betray', 'forgetting', 'favorite', 'restaurant', 'having', 'closed', 'years', 'ago', 'ex-wife', 'no', 'longer', 'middle-aged', 'child', 'still', 'college', 'one', 'sole', 'solace', 'anchor', 'real', 'world', 'old', 'bookshelf', 'filled', 'library', 'place', 'continuity', 'unceremoniously', 'swept', 'away', 'guise', 'progress', 'self-absorbed', 'pretentious', 'prigs', 'world', 'Unsurprisingly', 'so-called', 'Millennials', 'aka', 'Generation', 'Me', 'growing', 'up', 'sick', 'social', 'experiment', 'inflated', 'unearned', 'self-esteem', 'unapologetic', 'arrogance', 'having', 'sadly', 'supplanted', 'genuine', 'self-confidence', ""'re"", 'now', 'stuck', 'astounding', 'frighteningly', 'large', 'glut', 'types', 'today.Now', 'nothing', 'impede', 'terrible', 'progress', 'disease', 'Frank', 'slowly', 'world', 'growing', 'less', 'recognizable', 'passing', 'moment.His', 'two', 'children', 'try', 'supportive', 'best', 'have', 'own', 'lives', 'lead', 'daughter', 'constantly', 'traveling', 'world', 'chasing', 'various', 'causes', 'charities', 'stateside', 'sibling', 'not', 'taking', 'more', 'time', 'dad', 'son', 'frustration', 'over', 'when', 'old', 'man', 'entertain', 'suggestion', 'relocating', 'rejuvenation', 'center', 'blend', 'med', 'facility', 'retirement', 'community/hospice', 'anything', 'closer', 'proximity', 'own', 'home', 'family.No', 'thanks', 'Frank', 'not', 'having', 'stalemate', 'worsens', 'son', 'idea', 'robot', 'Around-the-clock', 'care', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'weekly', 'ten', 'hour', 'round-trip', 'journey', 'fulfill', 'filial', 'duty', 'Perfect.Or', 'not.Obviously', 'Frank', 'not', 'happy', 'camper', 'curmudgeon', 'thought', 'living', 'walking', 'talking', 'overgrown', 'microwave', 'oven', 'arms', 'appeal', 'fact', 'insulted', 'left', 'choice', 'forced', 'take', 'repeated', 'attempts', 'mock', 'humiliate', 'crush', 'animated', 'assistant', 'even', 'life', 'memory', 'are', 'improving', 'care.Their', 'time', 'together', 'paralleling', 'others', 'selective', 'memories', 'choice', 'meet', 'one', 'final', 'eacute', 'own', 'terms', 'Simultaneously', 'exploring', 'depth', 'friendship', 'factors', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'buddy', 'true', 'friend', 'was', 'echo', ""'Cast"", 'Away', 'script', 'lonely', 'soul', 'desperate', 'need', 'socialize', 'overcomes', 'better', 'sense', 'coalescing', 'imaginary', 'bud', 'physical', 'essence', 'deflated', 'volleyball', 'film', 'similar', 'idea', 'brilliantly', 'it.Then', 'just', 'when', 'have', 'screenplay', 'figured', 'out', 'twist', 'most', 'delicious', 'surprise', 'midway', 'screenplay', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'it.Sincerely', 'one', 'most', 'tender', 'soulful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'screened', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'cinephile', 'one', 'greatest', 'joys', 'one', 'can', 'receive', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'experience.Absolutely', 'five', 'stars.Movie', 'Recommendations', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'may', 'suggest', 'checking', 'out', '5', 'Day', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola.-', 'Also', 'consider', 'lighthearted', ""'Maiden"", 'Heist', 'trio', 'screen', 'legends', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy.Personal', 'Notes', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'big', 'award', 'committees', 'mystery', 'pathetic', 'one', 'was', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'film', 'filled', 'genuinely', 'amazing', 'performances', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'honestly', 'deserved', 'much', 'more', 'recognition.-', 'was', 'only', 'film', 'had', 'concluded', 'was', 'stunned', 'learn', 'voice', 'Robot', 'was', 'not', 'John', 'Malkovich']",Robot and Frank

1608297,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00AENNHOE,Mark Turner,"[9, 10]","Frank Langella is an actor whose talents are rarely noted it seems. Some folks don't even know who you're talking about when his name is mentioned and that's a shame. Those of us old enough to remember will think of him as Dracula. A younger generation might consider him Nixon. The thing is he's been around turning out great performances for years and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves. His latest out on DVD proves that.In ROBOT & FRANK Langella stars as Frank, an ex-jewel thief in the near future when things are changing as they always do. A cantankerous sort, Frank has been left by his kids to fend for himself away from family. They still try to make his life as comfortable as possible but at the same time have little to do with him. Case in point is the new item Frank's son Hunter (James Marsden) has brought to him.To make sure that he's taken care of Hunter has just purchased a robot to be Frank's companion and caretaker. The robot has numerous responses programmed inside of him but at the same time develops his own somewhat personality the more time he spends with his new owner. At the same time he has a moral compass installed that makes him unlikely to be a partner should Frank ever decide to return to his old profession. At first confrontational Frank eventually accepts the little guy and they become friends of sort.Frank spends his days doing little but he does enjoy the walks he takes into town especially to the local library. This partly involves his respect for the books on hand there but more to do with the local librarian Jennifer (Susan Sarandon) he takes a liking to. That will soon change as the young generation is dispensing the library of all its books to be replaced by computerized editions on hand and available at work stations. These people are interested in Frank only because he actually read a book.Angry at the way things in his life are going and angrier still at the elitists' attitudes of this new generation, Frank decides to steal Jennifer's favorite book from the library to give to her. He recruits the robot to be his wing man. This will be no easy task as he not only has to teach the robot how to become a thief but has to convince him it's for the better as well.Frank uses the robot to help him co-ordinate things in his goal of returning to a life of crime. They begin by taking on a small project of stealing something from the snobby head of the group determined to change the library. As Frank teaches the robot the finer skills involved in timing, lock picking and breaking and entering we're given a humorous look as he corrupts the robot that has no clue. At the same time we witness the human connection between the two that Frank doesn't share with his kids.Problems arise when Frank's daughter Madison (Liv Tyler) arrives. Where Frank at one time wanted his daughter to be there now he wants her out so he and the robot can get back to business. But Madison is here after being plagued with guilt for not taking care of her father. Then again she also returns because it is convenient. Until she is gone Frank can't move forward with his plans.What makes this film so interesting is the skill shown by Langella as Frank, a man who is lost in a new world that doesn't seem to have time for him any more. He does regret parts of his past, mostly the fact that he wasn't there for his children when they were growing up which is being reciprocated by their not being there for him now. It's not a matter of no love, just anger at the past. But the true emotion seen in the film isn't between one human and another but between Frank and the robot. A defining moment between the two comes towards the end but I won't ruin the surprise of it here. Watch and see.The quality of the production values in this film are well accomplished and all involved turn in true to character performances. The photography is well done and the direction brings the most out of each actor as well as the completely unemotional robot. If you're getting older (like me) then you'll relate to many of the scenes here. This is an enjoyable film that only gets better as it moves forward.",4,HUMANITY IN THE MACHINE,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,4147,"['Frank', 'Langella', 'actor', 'talents', 'are', 'rarely', 'noted', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', ""'re"", 'talking', 'when', 'name', 'mentioned', 'shame', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'will', 'think', 'Dracula', 'A', 'younger', 'generation', 'might', 'consider', 'Nixon', 'thing', 'been', 'turning', 'out', 'great', 'performances', 'years', ""n't"", 'get', 'recognition', 'latest', 'out', 'DVD', 'that.In', 'ROBOT', 'FRANK', 'Langella', 'Frank', 'ex-jewel', 'thief', 'near', 'future', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'changing', 'always', 'do', 'cantankerous', 'sort', 'Frank', 'been', 'left', 'kids', 'fend', 'away', 'family', 'still', 'try', 'make', 'life', 'as', 'comfortable', 'possible', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'Case', 'point', 'new', 'item', 'Frank', 'son', 'Hunter', 'James', 'Marsden', 'brought', 'him.To', 'make', 'sure', 'taken', 'care', 'Hunter', 'just', 'purchased', 'robot', 'be', 'Frank', 'companion', 'caretaker', 'robot', 'numerous', 'responses', 'programmed', 'same', 'time', 'own', 'somewhat', 'personality', 'more', 'time', 'new', 'owner', 'same', 'time', 'moral', 'compass', 'installed', 'unlikely', 'be', 'partner', 'should', 'Frank', 'ever', 'decide', 'return', 'old', 'profession', 'first', 'confrontational', 'Frank', 'eventually', 'little', 'guy', 'become', 'friends', 'sort.Frank', 'days', 'doing', 'little', 'enjoy', 'walks', 'town', 'especially', 'local', 'library', 'partly', 'respect', 'books', 'hand', 'there', 'more', 'do', 'local', 'librarian', 'Jennifer', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'liking', 'will', 'soon', 'change', 'young', 'generation', 'dispensing', 'library', 'books', 'be', 'replaced', 'computerized', 'editions', 'hand', 'available', 'work', 'stations', 'people', 'are', 'interested', 'Frank', 'only', 'actually', 'read', 'book.Angry', 'way', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'going', 'angrier', 'still', 'elitists', 'attitudes', 'new', 'generation', 'Frank', 'steal', 'Jennifer', 'favorite', 'book', 'library', 'give', 'robot', 'be', 'wing', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'task', 'not', 'only', 'teach', 'robot', 'how', 'become', 'thief', 'convince', 'better', 'well.Frank', 'robot', 'help', 'co-ordinate', 'things', 'goal', 'returning', 'life', 'crime', 'begin', 'taking', 'small', 'project', 'stealing', 'something', 'snobby', 'head', 'group', 'determined', 'change', 'library', 'Frank', 'robot', 'finer', 'skills', 'involved', 'timing', 'lock', 'picking', 'breaking', 'entering', ""'re"", 'given', 'humorous', 'look', 'robot', 'clue', 'same', 'time', 'witness', 'human', 'connection', 'two', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'share', 'kids.Problems', 'arise', 'when', 'Frank', 'daughter', 'Madison', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Where', 'Frank', 'one', 'time', 'wanted', 'daughter', 'be', 'there', 'now', 'out', 'so', 'robot', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'business', 'Madison', 'here', 'being', 'plagued', 'guilt', 'not', 'taking', 'care', 'father', 'Then', 'again', 'also', 'convenient', 'gone', 'Frank', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'forward', 'plans.What', 'film', 'so', 'interesting', 'skill', 'shown', 'Langella', 'Frank', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'new', 'world', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'time', 'more', 'regret', 'parts', 'past', 'mostly', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'children', 'when', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'being', 'reciprocated', 'not', 'being', 'there', 'now', 'not', 'matter', 'love', 'just', 'anger', 'past', 'true', 'emotion', 'seen', 'film', ""n't"", 'one', 'human', 'Frank', 'robot', 'defining', 'moment', 'two', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'surprise', 'here', 'Watch', 'see.The', 'quality', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'accomplished', 'involved', 'turn', 'true', 'character', 'performances', 'photography', 'well', 'done', 'direction', 'most', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'completely', 'unemotional', 'robot', ""'re"", 'getting', 'older', 'then', ""'ll"", 'relate', 'many', 'scenes', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'only', 'better', 'forward']",Robot and Frank

Frank Langella is superb as Frank, a retired ""cat burglar"" burdened with senility and a fading memory, plus two selfish children.  Son James Marsden is tired of his weekly commitment to check in on dad so he buys him a robot to act as caregiver.  Frank initially resists the practicality of the robot's influence, but ultimately succumbs to the automaton's charms.

Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","In the hands of another director, &#34;Robot and Frank&#34; might be a hilarious caper about a retired crook looking for one last score and his unwitting robot accomplice.  But the reality is that this tidy little film has much more important things to worry about: aging, death, and the little indignities that happen with each lost memory.Frank Weld (Frank Langella) is slowly losing his mind.  He also happens to be an ex-con with a criminal past and a propensity for breaking and entering -- the film begins with him breaking into a home, only to realize that it's his own.  That one scene perfectly sums up Frank's dilemma as a man whose only hobby is a crime that he can no longer remember.Frank's son and daughter Madison (Liv Tyler) have taken this road with him many times and are now so tired of the routine that they have little time for him anymore.  His son Hunter (James Marsden) gives him a robot companion (Peter Sarsgaard).  It is never given a name.  It walks like the Honda ASIMO, but -- as fitting its near-future setting -- is more advanced, capable of everything from gardening to picking locks.  It's the latter skill that finally charms Frank and gets him to accept the robot, an artificial intelligence that amorally sees any activity Frank enjoys as critical to his rehabilitation.Back to that comic caper. Frank discovers his favorite local library is being replaced by yuppie jerk Jake (Jeremy Strong) more interested in converting documents to digital than reading books, and the symbolic struggle between the physical and the electronic centers on an antique copy of Don Quixote.  There's even a maiden in the tale, pretty librarian Jennifer (Susan Sarandon). And so, accompanied by his dutiful companion, our errant knight jousts at windmills for his fair lady.But the truth is much more prosaic. Frank's reality unravels slowly at first, and then snowballs into a series of lies he's told himself and his children, betrayed by his own faulty memory of who he was and who he hoped he would be.This is a deceptively complex film that offers no easy answers, even if its ending is a little trite.",4,Not another hilarious caper,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,2125,"['hands', 'director', '34', 'Robot', 'Frank', '34', 'might', 'be', 'hilarious', 'caper', 'retired', 'crook', 'looking', 'one', 'last', 'score', 'unwitting', 'robot', 'accomplice', 'reality', 'tidy', 'little', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'worry', 'aging', 'death', 'little', 'indignities', 'happen', 'lost', 'memory.Frank', 'Weld', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'slowly', 'losing', 'mind', 'also', 'be', 'ex-con', 'criminal', 'past', 'propensity', 'breaking', 'entering', 'film', 'breaking', 'home', 'only', 'realize', 'own', 'one', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'up', 'Frank', 'dilemma', 'man', 'only', 'hobby', 'crime', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'remember.Frank', 'son', 'daughter', 'Madison', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'have', 'taken', 'road', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'now', 'so', 'tired', 'routine', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'anymore', 'son', 'Hunter', 'James', 'Marsden', 'robot', 'companion', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'never', 'given', 'name', 'Honda', 'ASIMO', 'fitting', 'near-future', 'setting', 'more', 'advanced', 'capable', 'everything', 'gardening', 'picking', 'locks', 'latter', 'skill', 'finally', 'Frank', 'accept', 'robot', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'amorally', 'activity', 'Frank', 'as', 'critical', 'rehabilitation.Back', 'comic', 'caper', 'Frank', 'favorite', 'local', 'library', 'being', 'replaced', 'yuppie', 'jerk', 'Jake', 'Jeremy', 'Strong', 'more', 'interested', 'converting', 'documents', 'digital', 'reading', 'books', 'symbolic', 'struggle', 'physical', 'electronic', 'centers', 'antique', 'copy', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'even', 'maiden', 'tale', 'pretty', 'librarian', 'Jennifer', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'so', 'accompanied', 'dutiful', 'companion', 'errant', 'knight', 'jousts', 'windmills', 'fair', 'truth', 'much', 'more', 'prosaic', 'Frank', 'reality', 'unravels', 'slowly', 'first', 'then', 'series', 'told', 'children', 'betrayed', 'own', 'faulty', 'memory', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'hoped', 'would', 'be.This', 'deceptively', 'complex', 'film', 'easy', 'answers', 'even', 'ending', 'little', 'trite']",Robot and Frank

Living alone has become a challenge and one day Frank's son buys him a robot who can be a do-it-all butler for Frank. Then a strange thing happens: after initially resisting the robot as much as possible, Frank discovers he actually likes the robot's help and, even more important, its companionship. Soon thereafter, Frank concots a plan to commit one last heist, with the help of the robot.

You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: (i) the movie is a strange mix of a bitter-sweet family drama, character study, buddy movie, and comedy (of course not all at the same time), but the movie finds its own pace and somehow it all works; as a result, and knowing the general premise of the movie going in, I couldn't wait to see what would happen and how it would all end; (ii) speaking of the end of the movie, it came as quite the surprise, and certainly too abrupt for my liking; (iii) this is another great, great performance from Frank Langella, who seems to be getting better with age; (iv) on the contrary, most of the supporting cast, in particular Liv Tayler, felt forced, the one exception being Susan Sarandon as the local librarian.

To make the film more effective, perhaps director Jake Schreier and writer Christopher D. Ford could have focused more on Susan Sarandon's character.The idea of robots designed to make the elderly's life happier is nothing new in real life. A robotic seal ""Paro"" is a good example.

Everything pretty much looks the same except for an occasional futuristic car passing by and Skpe- like video phone messages coming through large screen TVs inside the home. One other thing: there are now sophisticated but small robots available to perform household chores and act as home care attendants.When aging ex-con and petty thief, Frank (played by Frank Langella), begins exhibiting signs of dementia, his son Hunter buys him a robot to take care of chores around the house and put the old man on a new healthy regimen consisting of good diet and exercise. Perhaps the best part of the film is how the curmudgeonly Frank adapts to the robot--at first he resents its presence but when Frank discovers that the robot is not programmed to have a moral conscience (an unlikely twist!), he begins training it to pick locks and join him in his reinvigorated life of crime. Frank even begins not to mind the healthy food the robot has been preparing for him.Just as Frank is becoming obsolete, so is the local library run by Jennifer (Susan Sarandon) who sadly is forced by a local developer to dispose of their entire print collection; with all the books being transformed into digital copies. Frank gets the idea that if he steals a rare copy of Don Quixote and ultimately returns it to Jennifer, that will please her. This is the first rather unfunny scene involving a burglary.Things pick up a bit when Frank's daughter, Madison, an activist who believes humans shouldn't rely on robots, gums things up when she arrives at the family home and insists on caring for Frank, herself. She turns the robot off which interferes with Frank's plans to commit burglary #2. When Frank intentionally turns the house into a pigsty, she's forced to use the robot for cleaning and eventually agrees to allow her father to use the robot, but only periodically during the day.One gets the feeling that screenwriter Christopher Ford runs out of real creative ideas to move the plot along in the second half. The plot is rather silly, with Frank targeting Jake, the developer responsible for renovating the library. Jake is a cartoon bad guy and we're not supposed to feel bad that Frank burglarized his home. Frank and the Robot end up swiping some expensive jewels belonging to Jake's wife but he convinces the police to put Frank under 24 hour surveillance. It's all very awkward with a bunch of cartoon cops waiting outside in a van, who eventually are able to gain entrance into the home (I can't recall if a warrant was actually revealed but I believe Frank invites the police in).Before you know it, Frank realizes that all the evidence is on the Robot's hard drive and he must wipe it clean before the police access it. The wiped hard drive is equated with Frank's growing dementia as his memory is 'wiped clean' too at film's end. This becomes apparent when his adult children visit him at a new fangled 'memory center' and we see Frank's dementia is now full blown.There is also another revelation before Frank loses all his marbles: Jennifer the librarian is actually Frank's ex-wife. It's supposed to be poignant but since Susan Sarandon is given so little to do beforehand, the little surprise hardly makes a mark.The one big saving grace for 'Robot and Frank' is Frank Langella's assured performance as the determined curmudgeon. His surly relationship with the robot provides enough entertainment for most of the film. The narrative falters when Frank commits the pair of unfunny bumbling burglaries, suggesting that the screenwriter was not up to the task of finding a truly clever ending for this lightweight property.",2,Langella is fine as curmudgeon ex-con but film loses its comic edge in second half,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,3800,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', ""5.0'Robot"", 'Frank', 'place', ""'near"", 'future', 'Cold', 'Spring', 'New', 'York', 'actually', 'shot', 'Rye', 'New', 'York', 'Everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'occasional', 'futuristic', 'car', 'passing', 'Skpe-', 'video', 'phone', 'messages', 'coming', 'large', 'screen', 'TVs', 'home', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'are', 'now', 'sophisticated', 'small', 'robots', 'available', 'perform', 'household', 'chores', 'act', 'home', 'care', 'aging', 'ex-con', 'petty', 'thief', 'Frank', 'played', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'exhibiting', 'signs', 'dementia', 'son', 'Hunter', 'robot', 'take', 'care', 'chores', 'house', 'put', 'old', 'man', 'new', 'healthy', 'regimen', 'consisting', 'good', 'diet', 'exercise', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'curmudgeonly', 'Frank', 'adapts', 'robot', 'first', 'presence', 'when', 'Frank', 'robot', 'not', 'programmed', 'have', 'moral', 'conscience', 'unlikely', 'twist', 'training', 'pick', 'locks', 'join', 'reinvigorated', 'life', 'crime', 'Frank', 'even', 'not', 'mind', 'healthy', 'food', 'robot', 'been', 'preparing', 'him.Just', 'Frank', 'becoming', 'obsolete', 'so', 'local', 'library', 'run', 'Jennifer', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'sadly', 'forced', 'local', 'developer', 'dispose', 'entire', 'print', 'collection', 'books', 'being', 'transformed', 'digital', 'copies', 'Frank', 'idea', 'rare', 'copy', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'ultimately', 'Jennifer', 'will', 'please', 'first', 'rather', 'unfunny', 'scene', 'involving', 'burglary.Things', 'pick', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'Frank', 'daughter', 'Madison', 'activist', 'who', 'humans', 'should', ""n't"", 'rely', 'robots', 'gums', 'things', 'up', 'when', 'family', 'home', 'insists', 'caring', 'Frank', 'robot', 'Frank', 'plans', 'commit', 'burglary', '2', 'When', 'Frank', 'intentionally', 'house', 'pigsty', 'forced', 'use', 'robot', 'cleaning', 'eventually', 'allow', 'father', 'use', 'robot', 'only', 'periodically', 'day.One', 'feeling', 'screenwriter', 'Christopher', 'Ford', 'real', 'creative', 'ideas', 'move', 'plot', 'second', 'half', 'plot', 'rather', 'silly', 'Frank', 'targeting', 'Jake', 'developer', 'responsible', 'renovating', 'library', 'Jake', 'cartoon', 'bad', 'guy', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'feel', 'bad', 'Frank', 'burglarized', 'home', 'Frank', 'Robot', 'end', 'up', 'swiping', 'expensive', 'jewels', 'belonging', 'Jake', 'wife', 'police', 'put', 'Frank', '24', 'hour', 'surveillance', 'very', 'awkward', 'bunch', 'cartoon', 'cops', 'waiting', 'outside', 'van', 'who', 'eventually', 'are', 'able', 'gain', 'entrance', 'home', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'warrant', 'was', 'actually', 'revealed', 'believe', 'Frank', 'police', 'know', 'Frank', 'evidence', 'Robot', 'hard', 'drive', 'must', 'wipe', 'clean', 'police', 'access', 'wiped', 'hard', 'drive', 'equated', 'Frank', 'growing', 'dementia', 'memory', ""'wiped"", 'clean', 'too', 'film', 'end', 'apparent', 'when', 'adult', 'children', 'visit', 'new', 'fangled', ""'memory"", 'center', 'see', 'Frank', 'dementia', 'now', 'full', 'blown.There', 'also', 'revelation', 'Frank', 'marbles', 'Jennifer', 'librarian', 'actually', 'Frank', 'ex-wife', 'supposed', 'be', 'poignant', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'given', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'beforehand', 'little', 'surprise', 'hardly', 'mark.The', 'one', 'big', 'saving', 'grace', ""'Robot"", 'Frank', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'assured', 'performance', 'determined', 'curmudgeon', 'surly', 'relationship', 'robot', 'enough', 'entertainment', 'most', 'film', 'narrative', 'falters', 'when', 'Frank', 'pair', 'unfunny', 'bumbling', 'burglaries', 'suggesting', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'finding', 'truly', 'clever', 'ending', 'lightweight', 'property']",Robot and Frank
