700736,A1VP9TBSMVLMB8,B00006673P,Carrie Elizabeth,"[40, 40]","This movie, starring a young Hedy Lamarr is proof of how sexual old films could be without showing much!Ecstasy is basically the story of a young girl who marries an old guy (though they don't really explain why she did in the first place). He isn't at all interested in her on their wedding night...he isn't really interested in her at all! The simple prettiness of Hedy makes her seem like a girl you yourself would know and it makes it that much easier to feel all the emotions she is feeling. I was a little confused as to why there were silent parts (without even the use of dialogue boxes) and also talking parts. I personally liked the silent scenes. Hedy was a wonderful actress and her face alone could tell the entire story.Anyways, after she requests a divorce from her husband, she lives with her father and while out alone one day, she decides to go swimming in the nude (this scene was blown way out of proportion; yes, she was naked, but I thought it was done very tastefully and you really don't see much). I won't give away all that happens, but by the end of that scene she meets a very VERY handsome land surveyor, who is everything she's searching for. After this initial meeting she later goes to his home and this results in the first on-screen orgasm, which was done simply showing Hedy's face, and it became, in my opinion, the hottest love scene ever!Overall, this movie was excellent, though it should probably be seen more than once to see every little erotic message the director put in there. I would have given it five stars, but I didn't care for the ending. But please don't let that keep you from seeing this film! It is still wonderful!",4,Four and a half stars!,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,1670,"['movie', 'starring', 'young', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'proof', 'how', 'sexual', 'old', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'showing', 'much', 'Ecstasy', 'basically', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'old', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'why', 'did', 'first', 'place', ""n't"", 'interested', 'wedding', 'night', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'simple', 'prettiness', 'Hedy', 'seem', 'girl', 'would', 'know', 'much', 'easier', 'feel', 'emotions', 'feeling', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'why', 'were', 'silent', 'parts', 'even', 'use', 'dialogue', 'boxes', 'also', 'talking', 'parts', 'personally', 'liked', 'silent', 'scenes', 'Hedy', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'face', 'alone', 'could', 'tell', 'entire', 'story.Anyways', 'divorce', 'husband', 'father', 'out', 'alone', 'one', 'day', 'go', 'swimming', 'nude', 'scene', 'was', 'blown', 'way', 'proportion', 'yes', 'was', 'naked', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'tastefully', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'end', 'scene', 'very', 'VERY', 'handsome', 'land', 'surveyor', 'who', 'everything', 'searching', 'initial', 'meeting', 'later', 'home', 'results', 'first', 'on-screen', 'orgasm', 'was', 'done', 'simply', 'showing', 'Hedy', 'face', 'became', 'opinion', 'hottest', 'love', 'scene', 'ever', 'Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'see', 'little', 'erotic', 'message', 'director', 'put', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'ending', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'seeing', 'film', 'still', 'wonderful']",N/A

Miller ""LividEmerald""","[44, 46]","I was amazed by some of the camerawork in this film, enjoyed the inclusion of nudity and sensuality, and was awed by the forceful (propaganda?) images of manual laborers towards the end. The story is simple, but involving. If the film quality were good, I would give this film four or five stars. But I must warn you that while quite a few films this old have survived the ravages of time, or have been restored in one way or another, this film is in absolutely dreadful condition. The soundtrack hisses and rattles (deranging the music, since there is practically no dialogue), and the celluoid is thoroughly scratched, not to mention split asunder by occasional ""thunderbolts."" Perhaps it would have been too expensive to attempt a complete restoration of this particular film, but for the high price of the DVD, you'd expect some attempt to correct at least some of the damage. (Note: Anyone wishing to buy this strictly for the nude scenes will be largely disappointed because the nudity is mostly distant, and the film quality leaves most of the details to the viewer's imagination.) ""Extase"" definitely merits restoration, if it is feasible. As it is, the film quality so distracts from the viewing experience that it's painful to watch.",1,One star for film quality,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,1243,"['was', 'amazed', 'camerawork', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'inclusion', 'nudity', 'sensuality', 'was', 'awed', 'forceful', 'propaganda', 'images', 'manual', 'laborers', 'end', 'story', 'simple', 'involving', 'film', 'quality', 'were', 'good', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'must', 'warn', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'old', 'have', 'survived', 'ravages', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'one', 'way', 'film', 'absolutely', 'dreadful', 'condition', 'soundtrack', 'hisses', 'rattles', 'deranging', 'music', 'practically', 'dialogue', 'celluoid', 'thoroughly', 'scratched', 'not', 'mention', 'split', 'asunder', 'occasional', 'thunderbolts', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'expensive', 'attempt', 'complete', 'restoration', 'particular', 'film', 'high', 'price', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'expect', 'attempt', 'correct', 'least', 'damage', 'Note', 'Anyone', 'wishing', 'buy', 'strictly', 'nude', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'largely', 'disappointed', 'nudity', 'mostly', 'distant', 'film', 'quality', 'most', 'details', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'Extase', 'definitely', 'restoration', 'feasible', 'film', 'quality', 'so', 'viewing', 'experience', 'painful', 'watch']",N/A
700738,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00006673P,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[6, 7]","Pope Pius XII publically denounced it.  The Legion of Decency condemned it.  The United States banned it from importation.  It is easily one of the great scandals in cinema history: the 1933 ECSTASY.An Austrian film directed by Gustav Machaty, ECSTASY is the story of Eve (Hedy Lamarr, billed here as Hedy Kiesler), who marries an older man named Emile (Zvonimir Rogoz.)  After several days of inattention and disappointment, Eve returns to her father's home.  One morning she goes for a naked swim--but her horse runs away with her clothes.  Adam (Aribert Mog) comes to the rescue, and although Eve is angry that he has seen her naked, she can't stop thinking about him.  Later that evening she goes to his cabin, where she enjoys his embrace.  But unfortunately for all concerned, Emile has come in search of Eve, determined to take her home.The film is done in a deliberately arty style.  When Emile takes Eve for their honeymoon, for example, he has a tremendous problem getting the his key in the door lock--a bit of obvious imagery that does not portend well for the marriage.  Later in the film Eve's pearls become yet another symbol, and indeed the movie abounds with snorting horses, trains, flowers, and the like, all of them intercut in the narrative.  In theory, all this imagery is a commentary on sexuality; surprisingly, it actually works rather well.  But the infamy of ECSTASY rests on two scenes: the bathing scene, in which Hedy Lamarr swims and then runs naked through the countryside, and the sex scene, in which the camera holds on Lamarr's face as she appears to have an orgasm.Nudity in film was not unheard of in American film, and many silent films sported barebreasted maidens.  The famous 1925 BEN-HUR not only featured such unclad women, it featured several unclad men as well.  By 1933, however, censorship was on the rise, and while the scene is rife with strategically placed branches, Lamarr's nude scene was indeed considered shocking by standards of the day.  But the real issue was the sex scene, which film historians describe as the first depiction of orgasm in a non-pornographic film.  Lamarr later commented that her facial expression was acheived by the director, who stuck her with a pin to make her grimmace during the shoot.  The notion of a woman enjoying sex horrified Americans from sea to shining sea.ECSTASY was not only banned in the United States, it was also banned in Europe, although not for the same reasons.  That same year Lamarr married Fritz Mandl, heir to Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik Armaments, and by many accounts the jealous Mandl did his level best to buy and destroy every copy of the film he could find.  The film fared no better under the Nazis, for Lamarr was of Jewish descent.  In spite of various bans, the unedited film was smuggled into America, where it existed in the hands of a few wealthy collectors; when Lamarr became an American screen star, however, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer worked hard to track down and destroy these prints.  It is actually a little surprising that the film exists at all.Watching the film today one may wonder what all the fuss was about.  It is interesting in its juxtapositions of imagery, but it is also rather slow, and the dialogue doesn't help any: in theory a German-language film, ECSTASY is more akin to a silent film.  Lamarr is an attractive young woman, but she was hardly the screen siren she later became, and while she runs naked with aplomb she isn't greatly memorable.  As for the notorious sex scene--well, by today's standards it is scarcely more than a hoot and holler.  The DVD print is not great, but it is watchable, and the DVD has no extras of any kind.  Worth watching?  If you are a film buff, yes.

700739,AB6HEXPVLXFSO,B00006673P,George W. Lynn,"[5, 5]","As with some of the others who reviewed this film, I rented it to see what the fuss was about, once upon a time, and found instead a surprisingly solid film. Hedy gives a very nice performance, even when fully clothed, which is after all, almost all of the film. In the beginning she is a young bride married to a middle aged man and it would have been nice to have had some scene to set up why she got married to this old fellow to begin with, but it's obvious from the start this isn't going anywhere fast, and Hedy goes into a slow death from lack of love, both the physical and emotional. Her performance is very sympathetic and the audience is inclined and expected to be indulgent with her. But her husband isn't played for laughs either, and the scene in which he finally realizes he's being cuckholded is itself very touching. Neither character is morally condemned in the course of the film, nor is her Lover for that matter. For a film that is largely silent, the acting is very modern in style and restrained. There are some pecularities for the modern viewer, especially in the final scenes where we get lots of shots of sturdy working men doing sturdy physical labor, with picks and shovels, building a new Germany I suppose. Maybe that was the price of getting the film released in 1933 Germany. Lots of emphasis on nature, with horses indulging in horse behavior, and lots of gypsies as well. But this is actually a fairly thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive film and well worth watching.

700741,A1ET8SZ6FNUH1F,B00006673P,William R. Ray,"[97, 97]","This film has so many versions that it's hard to say which one you will get.  The original is quite spicy with several nude scenes of Hedy Geisler (Hedy Lamar).  The sound track is primitive with just a little dialog or,  depending on which cut, no dialog.  This film was made just into the sound  era in Chechoslovakia.  As a collectors' item, it is a must for classic  film buffs, not for its quality or filmaking technique but for its impact  on movie censorship in the US.  The theme here is adultry.  Hedy plays a  young new wife to an older cold fish.  Fustrated on her wedding night, she  embarks on various endeavors clearly motivated by sexual fustration.  The  nude swim after a horseback ride is what all the hoopla was about.  The  horse runs away carrying our girl's clothes.  From this point on, various  versions carry various degrees of Hedy depending on which cut you get.  I  have 2, one purchased commercially in 1975 and another obtained later from  a private collector.  The second has much more nudity than the first.
