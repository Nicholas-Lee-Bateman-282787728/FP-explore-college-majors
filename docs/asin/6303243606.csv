My yoga experience consists of this dvd and my twice weekly yoga classes at the local gym, so my knowledge is by far limited.  That said, I definitely enjoyed this DVD; I like the pace, the instructor goes somewhat slowly through the moves, and i like that for the ability to work through the moves more fully, as opposed to quick transitions.  The scenery was great, and the music was as well.  the instructor's voice is very soothing.  this does well in blending the physical part with a quasi meditative experience.",5,Great for the beginner,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,631,"['dvd', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'yoga', 'i', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'yoga', 'junkie', 'been', 'about', '1', 'month', 'yoga', 'experience', 'dvd', 'twice', 'weekly', 'yoga', 'classes', 'local', 'gym', 'knowledge', 'far', 'limited', 'said', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'like', 'pace', 'instructor', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'moves', 'i', 'like', 'ability', 'work', 'moves', 'more', 'fully', 'opposed', 'quick', 'transitions', 'scenery', 'was', 'great', 'music', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'instructor', 'voice', 'very', 'soothing', 'well', 'blending', 'physical', 'part', 'quasi', 'meditative', 'experience']",Ali MacGraw - Yoga Mind & Body VHS

Erich's voice is so calming and Ali and the other students look like they are throughly enjoying themselves!! Of course they are!! I throughly enjoy myself too when I do this tape!!

You can not be in a distracted mood when you do this.  For me, my breathing is not as relaxed if I am thinking about what I need to get done after the video.  The music is very motivating to me.  The scene is beautiful, but often my eyes are closed or I am not facing the TV, so the scenery is wasted on me.  The music, which is a sort of new age flowing type, helps me to get into the flow of doing the warm up sun salutations.  Some poses I found a little difficult to maintain at first, (the tree), difficulty holding the balance, but I got better at it as I practiced more.  I could really feel the toning effects in my legs, (bridge pose), and arms, (downward dog).  So, this is not a hurry up and get your cardio workout video, but you will get a good, different workout.

365607,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,6303243606,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[75, 76]","Yoga Mind and Body is a classic yoga video which stands the test of time.  It is designed for those already familiar with yoga (ie, there is little instruction on how to perform each pose), and it will gently challenge you while also providing deep relaxation.  The practice begins with instruction on ujjayi breathing, a basic form of yogic breathing to accompany asana (posture) practice.  The warm up then continues with a cat/dog tilt series to open the spine.  This beginning section lasts about 7 minutes total, but once you understand the breathing, you can skip over that segment.Sun salutations comprise the next 10 minutes of the practice.  You will begin with simple breathing and forward bends before adding lunges to the sequence.  After practicing tree pose for balance, you will continue with another 10 minutes of standing poses performed in steady flow; postures in this segment include warrior, triangle, and side angle. The next 14 minutes of the workout involves floor work.  You will begin on your stomach for cobra and bow, then switch to your back for leg extensions, lying twists, and bridge.  The only seated posture is a single seated forward bend, and then you will return to your back for a relaxing 1/2 bridge pose.  The practice ends with approximatley 4 minutes in shavasana for a total of 45 minutes.Although others have complained about the background music, it didn't bother me--when I even noticed it, it seemed to fit nicely with the postures, as it varied from being upbeat to more soothing.  One minor criticism I have of this video is that although the scenery is beautiful, the cameras sometimes focused too much on scenic views when I wanted to see close-ups of the poses being performed; similarly, there was a bit too much shifting between cameras for my liking.  However, this issue did not detract from the fact that this is an excellent yoga practice which I will enjoy for a long time to come.",5,Wonderfully flowing yoga practice,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,1940,"['Yoga', 'Mind', 'Body', 'classic', 'yoga', 'video', 'test', 'time', 'designed', 'already', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'ie', 'little', 'instruction', 'how', 'perform', 'pose', 'will', 'gently', 'challenge', 'also', 'providing', 'deep', 'relaxation', 'practice', 'instruction', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'basic', 'form', 'yogic', 'breathing', 'accompany', 'asana', 'posture', 'practice', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'cat/dog', 'tilt', 'series', 'open', 'spine', 'beginning', 'section', '7', 'minutes', 'total', 'once', 'understand', 'breathing', 'can', 'skip', 'segment.Sun', 'salutations', 'comprise', 'next', '10', 'minutes', 'practice', 'will', 'begin', 'simple', 'breathing', 'forward', 'bends', 'adding', 'lunges', 'sequence', 'practicing', 'tree', 'pose', 'balance', 'will', 'continue', '10', 'minutes', 'standing', 'poses', 'performed', 'steady', 'flow', 'segment', 'include', 'warrior', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'next', '14', 'minutes', 'workout', 'floor', 'work', 'will', 'begin', 'stomach', 'cobra', 'bow', 'then', 'switch', 'back', 'leg', 'extensions', 'lying', 'twists', 'bridge', 'only', 'seated', 'posture', 'single', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'then', 'will', 'return', 'back', 'relaxing', '1/2', 'bridge', 'pose', 'practice', 'approximatley', '4', 'minutes', 'shavasana', 'total', '45', 'minutes.Although', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'background', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'when', 'even', 'noticed', 'seemed', 'fit', 'nicely', 'postures', 'varied', 'being', 'upbeat', 'more', 'soothing', 'One', 'minor', 'criticism', 'have', 'video', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'cameras', 'sometimes', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'scenic', 'views', 'when', 'wanted', 'see', 'close-ups', 'poses', 'being', 'performed', 'similarly', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'shifting', 'cameras', 'liking', 'However', 'issue', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'fact', 'excellent', 'yoga', 'practice', 'will', 'enjoy', 'long', 'time', 'come']",Ali MacGraw - Yoga Mind & Body VHS

365612,A17TDSX354MP7Y,6303243606,CPTScott,"[12, 13]","When I first got this tape I was at first put off by the slickness of the production and the music (which I felt was too intrusive). While I still think the music is a bit too loud and sometimes compete's with Erich Shiffman's instruction I do really like this tape overall. Even the music has become more enjoyable to me as I've gotten more used to the routine and have to concentrate less on the verbal instruction for cues.I have been doing yoga daily for almost 9 years and found this routine to be quite different from other tapes I have (and I have over 70 and counting). It's a nice change of pace to help bring variety into one's daily practice. It's excellent for days when you don't want something as intense as an Ashtanga routine but still want to be challenged. It covers all the basic movements/countermovements that will leave you feeling quite thoroughly stretched and strengthened.Ali Macgraw is definitely a serious practitioner of yoga and has wonderful grace and form. Her sincere comittment to yoga comes across clearly on this tape and I found her inspiring. Eric Schiffman did a great job designing this routine and leads you through it smoothly.I would agree with the other reviewers who recommended that one start with a beginning yoga tape before trying this one. Also, in spite of the fact that there are several ""students"" in the video there are no modifications shown which is a major drawback for someone new to yoga.For example, I often modify several parts of the sequence depending on how I feel on any given day. I like to work the Sun Salutes incrementally, starting with the first lunge with my hands on the floor, the next salute with my hands on my knees during the lunge, and then I move into the lunge (3rd salute)with my arms overhead. Most people may not need to move into the salutes like this but first thing in the morning I generally need to open up slowly in spite of the warm ups that are done before that part of the program. I also do the same with the plank poses, first on my knees as I lower down and then working eventually into a full chaturanga (lower pushup position)in the last repetitions of th Sun Salutes.I would recommend that beginners start with ""Yoga for beginners"" by Patricia Walden which is an excellent and thorough introduction, or Yoga Zone's Basics tapes (the five tape set is fabulous) to get started.Also there is a new series of Vinyasa Flow style tapes by Rainbeau Mars. The collection is called ""Sacred Yoga"" and the first two tapes are ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" which are excellent gentle practices, the last two tapes ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"" are much more challenging and all are beautifully done and highly recommended.The ""Total Yoga Flow Series"" by Tracey Rich and Ganja White are also excellent. If you're newer to yoga try ""Earth"" and then moe on to ""Water"" (which is about the same level of difficulty as the Macgraw tape reviewed here). The last tape ""Fire"" is very challenging and advanced.Also I would recommend buying Eric Schiffman's book ""Yoga, the practice of moving into stillness"" which is the best book I've seen on the subject.

This reviewer agrees with most of the following comments but includes some cautionary remarks: My VHS version had very high production values indeed. The music was clear and peaceful, as was the desert scenery. The verbal commentary is helpful and calming.  The cautionary news is that I found the workout too advanced. The stretches were held for too long and the poses too challenging. I have had back problems and was afraid to use the full range of motions offered here. I retreated to my admittedly very basic Rodney Yee tape. That stated, those previous positive review comments should stand. Ali's tape should be a very safe purchase for most folks- it just did not work out for me. And by the way, those looking for the preppy, collegiate Ali of ""Love Story"" and ""Goodbye Columbus"" won't find her. Time has moved on --but the years have made Miss Macgraw an even more attractive lady than she was in the 70s. More power to her!

I own many yoga videos (Shiva Rea, Rodney Yee, etc) and this is one of the best in my collection!  The sequence is really nice and flows in a sensible order, progressively moving into more difficult poses.  It is very fluid and allows you to practice various different poses.  It starts with sun salutations and moves into warrior poses.  Then, you do more difficult postures like back bends and standing tree pose, finishing with a resting meditation.

I don't get into the deeper spiritual side, but prefer to indulge in the stretching and relaxing techniques.At night, light a candle and practise this session in the evening before you go to bed.

After I mastered those I tried many others, including a couple of popular power ones.  Yes, those are a tad beyond me but I'm trying.  What I've found since graduating from the Dummies, is that I want a QUIET, SOOTHING, flowing workout sometimes. On most of the tapes I have the instructors jabber and yak non-stop, going beyond simple instruction.  That grows old and irritating.  And there are times I am just not into sweating and huffing with a power tape.  WELL!  This Yoga Mind and Body is exactly what I was looking for.  The scenery is great, and even tho I am not really into new age music, I love the music on this video.  And Erich's voice is quiet, slow, kind of monotone in a wonderfully soothing way.  The workout itself is great, and you can make it whatever you are into for that particular practice.  I see myself falling back on this tape for years to come, no matter how advanced I get.

While some people don't feel that it's good for beginners, I disagree. I was a complete beginner when I bought this, and though frustrating at first (isn't everything hard the first time?), I was patient and willing to work at it. The rewards have been great thus far, as I now practice Ashtanga regularly.Over the years, I bought numerous videos and DVDs, looking for the right yoga style for me. Ironically, I kept coming back to this video. Erich Schiffman's instruction is inspiring and encouraging and the music (lots of Dead Can Dance) is perfect. I suppose it was instinct that brought me to it in the first place. If you really want to make yoga a part of your life, listen to your heart and go with the yoga that calls to you, no matter how difficult or challenging. You should always have something to strive for.I believe that this DVD is for people who want to practice yoga on a spiritual level.
