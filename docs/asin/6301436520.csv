252793,A33UCQJ1QHU8B,6301436520,Andy Radke,"[12, 14]","With the DVD format being around for over 16 years, I eventually gave up hope that ""no Holds Barred"" would EVER become available on the format.  So, imagine my surprise when I get a 5am phone call from my best friend telling me that it was finally going to be released!  I was 12 years old when this film was released in theaters, and a huge fan of wrestling at that.... So seeing the immortal Hulk Hogan on the big screen was indeed a pipe dream for me, and ""No Holds Barred"" fast became one of my all-time childhood favorites.  After seeing the film again recently through adult eyes, I can say with confidence that it is undoubtedly cheesy....but in a good way.  Pretty much what you'd expect from an 80's action/comedy.  I've been a DVD collector for the past decade with over 1,100 titles in my collection.  ""No Holds Barred"" has remained at the top of my 'most wanted' list for YEARS.My only hope is that the film will be presented in its original widescreen format.  I can't possibly imagine why it wouldn't be.....but stranger things have happened.  I'd also like to see the steel cage match which accompanied the film on Pay-Per-View which was coined as ""No Holds Barred: The Movie / The Match"".  In fact, any WWE cross-promotion material would be certainly welcome.That being said, I won't complain if this is a bare-bones release.  The opportunity to have this film as a part of my collection is more than I could've ever expected, especially after waiting so long.

252794,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,6301436520,A. Pierre,"[9, 10]","I love 80's action films and wrestling, so this is a marriage made in heaven. Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the WWF Champion, and is pursued by a rival company. If you're a wrestling fan it really doesn't make much sense but the business was still protected at the time. Hogan does a good job for a wrestling film, Zeus looked good as a villian, and the film had some very funny moments. Is it corny? sure. Is Rip's injuried brother unintentionally funny? yes. Highly recommend this to old school wrestling fans, today's audience may not get it. Current WWE stars even mocked this film in a recent ad. If you like old school 80's macho action flicks, then you should enjoy this.I don't know who is in charge of marketing at WWE or if they have someone who markets just the dvds but whoever it is, they need to pick up the slack. WWE has always lacked in the speical features on there dvds and this one could have been much better then a measly photo gallery. I know Hogan is with the rival company but they could have added the unreleased, rarely seen match that followed this movie, Hogan/Beefcake VS Zeus/Macho King in a cage.

252795,AMICVV9N2U2R4,6301436520,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","No Holds Barred is crazy and drop-dead hilarious. Mind you, it isn't supposed to be, making it all the more endearingly funny. Starring Hulk Hogan, this movie follows the adventures of big wrestling star Rip Thomas as he wins the heart of his account executive Samantha and battles the maniacal wrestler Zeus, controlled by the evil tv executive Brell.In terms of entertainment, No Holds Barred delivers the punches. There is hardly a dull moment, and this doesn't just reach to the numerous, rather gritty fight sequences, either. As those good people at i-Mockery have rightly stated, Rip would make an awesome pirate, growling and generally destroying anyone foolish enough to take him on. When he's not giving them his guns, though, he's the nicest guy there is, even reluctant to advertise his name (something the real Hulk Hogan never had much of a problem with, if my memory serves me). And of course Rip has a love story with his beautiful account executive Samantha (Joan Severance). Then we have the dubious inclusion of Rip's apathic younger brother Randy, whose range of emotions can be counted on one hand. He mainly serves the purpose of getting his hide kicked to give the hero some motivation to face the bad guy.Ever-angry tv exec Brell (Kurt Fuller) is determined to pull his tv network out of the depths of ratings hell (largely thanks to Rip getting all the spotlight to his channel). So, after failing to make a deal with Rip, he comes up with a stroke of brilliance; getting a bunch of crazy, testosterone-raving misfits into the ring of the No Count Bar in the aptly-named ""Battle of the Tough Guys"". Marketing genius. When demented wrestler Zeus makes short work of the competition, Rip sees he has to face him.Needless to say, No Holds Barred is highly entertaining. There are a lot of action scenes, most of which underline how completely badass Rip is. However, this entertainment often leads into the territory of puzzling, but hilarious, madness. Rip can explode through the roof of a limo and literally cause a bad guy to soil his pants. Hell, he can even defeat two restaurant-robbing bad guys with pies - that's how badass he is. Zeus (Terry Tate) is both good at wrestling and growling and roaring like a maniac, for no reason at all. He barely speaks an intelligible line in the entire film, apart from ecstatically sighing his name, ""Zeuuuuussssss...""The No Count Bar, however, takes the cake. This seedy hangout is about the craziest place you can imagine. Here we have a bar with a ring taking most of the space, so that fights can take place easily. There is a midget who hangs out in a cage suspending from the ceiling, for no reason at all. The bathroom doesn't look so much as a bathroom as the most disgusting alley you could imagine, with urinals overflowing with bile and a dog chained to the wall for no plausible reason. The set designers had a field day on this movie. The characters that hang out at this bar constitute my favourite moments in this film. The Battle of the Tough Guys sees such aptly-named characters as Klondike Kramer and Brock Chisler (who even has a funny eyepatch joke). However, the most mental of the bunch are the toothless Bubba and his sister the waitress. Their interaction with Brell's terrified cronies are fidget-inducingly funny. I can just hear them laugh ""Tayeneee! Tayneee!"" I'm sniggering as I'm writing this.As you can see, No Holds Barred is a great deal of fun. It's entertaining and hilarious to boot. It may not be intended to be as funny as it is, but it's a charming quality that the movie would be lesser without. The extreme macho attitude of the movie should also make it a favourite pizza outing. Nobody will be bored, I assure you.",3,Crazy and Hilarious,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,3726,"['Holds', 'Barred', 'crazy', 'drop-dead', 'hilarious', 'Mind', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'making', 'more', 'endearingly', 'funny', 'Starring', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'movie', 'adventures', 'big', 'wrestling', 'star', 'Rip', 'Thomas', 'heart', 'account', 'executive', 'Samantha', 'maniacal', 'wrestler', 'Zeus', 'controlled', 'evil', 'tv', 'executive', 'Brell.In', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'No', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'punches', 'hardly', 'dull', 'moment', ""n't"", 'just', 'reach', 'numerous', 'rather', 'gritty', 'fight', 'sequences', 'either', 'good', 'people', 'i-Mockery', 'have', 'rightly', 'stated', 'Rip', 'would', 'make', 'awesome', 'pirate', 'growling', 'generally', 'destroying', 'anyone', 'foolish', 'enough', 'take', 'When', 'not', 'giving', 'guns', 'though', 'nicest', 'guy', 'even', 'reluctant', 'advertise', 'name', 'something', 'real', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'problem', 'memory', 'serves', 'course', 'Rip', 'love', 'story', 'beautiful', 'account', 'executive', 'Samantha', 'Joan', 'Severance', 'Then', 'have', 'dubious', 'inclusion', 'Rip', 'apathic', 'younger', 'brother', 'Randy', 'range', 'emotions', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'one', 'hand', 'mainly', 'purpose', 'getting', 'hide', 'kicked', 'give', 'hero', 'motivation', 'face', 'bad', 'guy.Ever-angry', 'tv', 'exec', 'Brell', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'determined', 'pull', 'tv', 'network', 'depths', 'ratings', 'hell', 'largely', 'thanks', 'Rip', 'getting', 'spotlight', 'channel', 'So', 'failing', 'make', 'deal', 'Rip', 'up', 'stroke', 'brilliance', 'getting', 'bunch', 'crazy', 'testosterone-raving', 'misfits', 'ring', 'No', 'Count', 'Bar', 'aptly-named', 'Battle', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'Marketing', 'genius', 'When', 'demented', 'wrestler', 'Zeus', 'short', 'work', 'competition', 'Rip', 'face', 'him.Needless', 'say', 'No', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'are', 'lot', 'action', 'scenes', 'most', 'underline', 'how', 'completely', 'badass', 'Rip', 'However', 'entertainment', 'often', 'territory', 'puzzling', 'hilarious', 'madness', 'Rip', 'can', 'explode', 'roof', 'limo', 'literally', 'cause', 'bad', 'guy', 'soil', 'pants', 'Hell', 'can', 'even', 'defeat', 'two', 'restaurant-robbing', 'bad', 'guys', 'pies', 'how', 'badass', 'Zeus', 'Terry', 'Tate', 'good', 'wrestling', 'growling', 'roaring', 'maniac', 'reason', 'barely', 'intelligible', 'line', 'entire', 'film', 'apart', 'ecstatically', 'sighing', 'name', 'Zeuuuuussssss', 'No', 'Count', 'Bar', 'however', 'cake', 'seedy', 'hangout', 'craziest', 'place', 'can', 'imagine', 'Here', 'have', 'bar', 'ring', 'taking', 'most', 'space', 'fights', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'easily', 'midget', 'who', 'out', 'cage', 'suspending', 'ceiling', 'reason', 'bathroom', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'much', 'bathroom', 'most', 'disgusting', 'alley', 'could', 'imagine', 'urinals', 'overflowing', 'bile', 'dog', 'chained', 'wall', 'plausible', 'reason', 'set', 'designers', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'movie', 'characters', 'hang', 'out', 'bar', 'constitute', 'favourite', 'moments', 'film', 'Battle', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'sees', 'such', 'aptly-named', 'characters', 'Klondike', 'Kramer', 'Brock', 'Chisler', 'who', 'even', 'funny', 'eyepatch', 'joke', 'However', 'most', 'mental', 'bunch', 'are', 'toothless', 'Bubba', 'sister', 'waitress', 'interaction', 'Brell', 'terrified', 'cronies', 'are', 'fidget-inducingly', 'funny', 'can', 'just', 'hear', 'Tayeneee', 'Tayneee', ""'m"", 'sniggering', ""'m"", 'writing', 'this.As', 'can', 'see', 'No', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'hilarious', 'boot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'intended', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'charming', 'quality', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'lesser', 'extreme', 'macho', 'attitude', 'movie', 'should', 'also', 'make', 'favourite', 'pizza', 'outing', 'Nobody', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'assure']",N/A

Who could forget his starring debut as WWF champion, Rip Thomas? Rip is the biggest star on cable and this is bad news for a competing network run by the evil Mr. Brell (played by Kurt Fuller), who demands Rip sign to his station. Rip won't do it though as he is signed with another company and &quot;his word is his bond&quot;. When he is turned down, Brell looks elsewhere for talent and promotes a tough man contest where the winner gets a whole lot of money and a spot on his network. Enter Zeus, a convicted killing machine who takes out the competition.While Zeus makes for huge ratings, Brell still isn't happy. He wants to promote a match between Zeus and Rip. He will stop at nothing to get it either as he hires a female assistant to seduce Rip and has Zeus hospitalize his little brother. This of course sends Rip on a rampage and results in the ultimate showdown between the two massive stars.This movie is one of those &quot;so corny, it's great&quot; films and actually inspired several real-life matches between Hogan and actor Lister on WWF pay-per-view.

This is pretty much a very silly film, where no one can act, or I should say, everyone overacts ridiculousy.  The story is not too intriguing.  Nevertheless, it is No Holds Barred wrestling fun.No Holds Barred is The Hulkster's first lead in a film.  He is ""Rip"", a character that is very similar to the real life Hulk Hogan.  His fights are extremely popular, and the network that carries him has rating overs the top.  Naturally, a competing network wants Rip, but he is not interested.  In attempt to gain ratings one way or another, the network's owner and 2 of his employees visit a trashy bar, where huge, filthy wrestlers duel out in a no rules ring, where you are lucky if their bodies even stay within the ring.  Intrigued by the event, the owner televises a tournament there called ""Tough Guy Competition"" where anyone with the guts can fight for $100,000.  Zeus ""Tiny Lister"" comes and scares the heck out of everyone, destroying everyone he touches.  The network owner is happy, and does what he can, hurting Rip's younger brother and girlfriend to get him to fight Zeus on television.  The final fight comes and it is a whopper - lasting about 10 minutes, and truly is a no holds barred spectical.The movie is rather laughable most of the time, and doesn't take itself seriously.  Hulk gets some tender moments in, and while his intentions are good, the acting isn't.  Then there's the good ole ""what's that smell scene"".  I coudn't stop laughing it was ridiculous.  Zeus is one crazy guy, and spends most of his time grunting, and when he speaks he still grunts.  Built like a machine and with a blind eye, he has the look of a villain no less.There are tons of action throughout the film, whether iy be wrestlers throwin each other around at the bar fights, or Hulk going insane with anger at Zeu's gym tearing up the place.  The last fight is worth it all though - its total fun.So silly of a movie, but sometimes those are the best one's.  There aren't really many wrestling movies out there like this, so if you want to see Hulk going all out in a film, this is your best bet.

252812,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,6301436520,Leonard,"[1, 1]","Watching No Holds Barred requires suspending a lot of disbelief. Many other reviewers already summarized the plot so I'll only do that briefly: Hogan (Rip) is a popular wrestler and the CEO of a rival network (Brill) wanted to sign him, but Hogan rebuffed his offer. Brill subsequently organized a bunch of wrestling matches at bars. The winner of that tournament was ex-con Zeus (Tiny Lister Jr., aka Deebo). Rip's trainer used to train Zeus, but he couldn't control Zeus's rage. When Zeus murdered an opponent in the ring after the bell, he left him for Rip.Brill hired an attractive assistant (Joan Severance) to seduce Rip. At first, she was only using him, but she eventually fell in love with him for real (that hotel scene was lame since they were in a hotel room together but they didn't have sex). When Brill found out, he assaulted her and arranged for her to get raped in a parking lot. Rip was able to save her.Rip, who was in his 30's, had a little brother named Randy who looked like a teenager. Randy thought it was a good idea to go to Zeus's match. When Zeus found out who he was, he nearly beat him to death. Afterwards, Rip trashed the gym where Zeus trains at and agreed to face Zeus in a match.The match followed the standard Hogan template. He was losing at first until he saw Randy in a wheelchair. They tried to kidnap his girlfriend and then blackmail Rip into throwing the match, but with the help of the trainer, she was able to escape. Rip eventually beat Zeus. He then went after Brill, but before he could get his hands on him, Brill was electrocuted.A few thoughts:A network CEO is really going to commit a bunch of felonies just to land a professional wrestler? And they're really going to let a guy who committed manslaughter wrestle?They obviously gave Hogan a black trainer so he wouldn't look racist for fighting Deebo. As a black male, I have to say that this wasn't necessary.What was the purpose of having Hogan's little brother in the movie?This is the type of movie you watch on a rainy day or buy used at Walmart.

Anyway, Rip is a pretty big deal in the Wrestling World. Not unlike Hulk himself around the same time. We know Rip is a nice guy because he's always hanging around children, not in a creepy way, but because they're sickly or orphaned or stupid or something. But while this is going on, a new guy rises to the top called Zeus. Not the Greek God, some wrestler dude. Anyway Zeus wins some competition, which makes him even bigger than Rip/Hulk, so Hulk gets mad and the film ends with a Wrestling match between Rip and Zeus. Anyway the public doesn't like Zeus as much as Rip, because he doesn't hang around sick kids, and he works for some evil guy named Brell. Even though 60% of Wrestling fans are Redknecks, and Hulk himself has been accused of racism, I'm sure it has _nothing_ to do with him being black.In the course of this film we see Hulk on top of the world, fall a bit, train a bit and climb his way to the top, all while courting a girlfriend in a manner that, anywhere else in the civilised world, even in 1989, would be considered sexual harassmant.

No Hold Barred stars Hulk Hogan as Rip, a champion wrestler who faithfully wrestles on network TV while the evil Brell (Kurt Fuller) wishes to steal him away to wrestle on his network and make him millions. Brell is the typical 80s villain: brash, arrogant, hot-headed, foul mouthed and nasty but wrapped up in a suit. Since Rip will not wrestle on Brell's network, Brell decides to have his own program ""Battle of the Toughguys"" and Zeus (Tom ""Deebo"" Lister, Jr) appears and beats people up.The film is a classic, not in a traditional sense, but in a campy, non PC 80s sort of way. Brell arranges multiple threats against Rip, he first assaults him with verbal abuse and putting his hands on him in the beginning, no problem, Rip walks away. Brell arranges for Rip to get beat up in a abandoned building, Rip literally explodes from the limo, beats up his assailants, makes the driver crap his pants and gives us the best line in the film: ""What's that smell?""...""Dookie"", does Rip call the cops, no, he goes home.Joan Severance appears as Sam, Rip's account executive, after a typical mixed up at the hotel, where they have to share a room, she falls in love with the Hulkster, I mean, Ripster, and Brell,ever the jerk, smacks her. Apparently calling the cops is too much a problem in 1989 as Rip does nothing, again, even after Brell sends somebody to rape her, no cops. Rip shows up in time to bash the rapist against a tree and delivers the equally famous line ""It's Harley and me and you and the tree"". It is not until Randy (Rip's little brother) goes against his friend's advice and common sense to watch a Zeus match, gets caught, the bad guys find out who he is and gets beaten up by Zeus thus finally getting Rip mad enough to confront Zeus. I will stop there as the ending is predictable but fun.The DVD is bare bones, I am surprised the WWE did not include ""No Holds Barred: The Match"" with this release or any other fun Zeus/Hogan promos and matches but perhaps Hulk's relationship with Vince or his association with TNA might have to do it, oh well.If you enjoy wrestling, Hulk Hogan, or a good, cheesy 80s action flick, this is your movie.",4,"""What's that smell?"".....Hulk Hogan's masterpiece",1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,2259,"['1989', 'movie', 'classic', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'who', 'battle', 'life', 'finally', 'here', 'No', 'Hold', 'Barred', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Rip', 'champion', 'wrestler', 'who', 'faithfully', 'network', 'TV', 'evil', 'Brell', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'steal', 'away', 'wrestle', 'network', 'make', 'millions', 'Brell', 'typical', '80s', 'villain', 'brash', 'arrogant', 'hot-headed', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'nasty', 'wrapped', 'up', 'suit', 'Rip', 'will', 'not', 'wrestle', 'Brell', 'network', 'Brell', 'have', 'own', 'program', 'Battle', 'Toughguys', 'Zeus', 'Tom', 'Deebo', 'Lister', 'Jr', 'people', 'up.The', 'film', 'classic', 'not', 'traditional', 'sense', 'campy', 'non', 'PC', '80s', 'sort', 'way', 'Brell', 'multiple', 'threats', 'Rip', 'first', 'assaults', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'putting', 'hands', 'beginning', 'problem', 'Rip', 'away', 'Brell', 'Rip', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'abandoned', 'building', 'Rip', 'literally', 'limo', 'up', 'assailants', 'driver', 'crap', 'pants', 'best', 'line', 'film', 'What', 'smell', 'Dookie', 'Rip', 'call', 'cops', 'home.Joan', 'Severance', 'Sam', 'Rip', 'account', 'executive', 'typical', 'mixed', 'up', 'hotel', 'where', 'have', 'share', 'room', 'love', 'Hulkster', 'mean', 'Ripster', 'Brell', 'ever', 'jerk', 'Apparently', 'calling', 'cops', 'too', 'much', 'problem', '1989', 'Rip', 'nothing', 'again', 'even', 'Brell', 'somebody', 'rape', 'cops', 'Rip', 'up', 'time', 'bash', 'rapist', 'tree', 'equally', 'famous', 'line', 'Harley', 'tree', 'not', 'Randy', 'Rip', 'little', 'brother', 'friend', 'advice', 'common', 'sense', 'watch', 'Zeus', 'match', 'caught', 'bad', 'guys', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'beaten', 'up', 'Zeus', 'thus', 'finally', 'getting', 'Rip', 'mad', 'enough', 'confront', 'Zeus', 'will', 'stop', 'there', 'ending', 'predictable', 'fun.The', 'DVD', 'bare', 'bones', 'am', 'surprised', 'WWE', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'No', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'Match', 'release', 'other', 'fun', 'Zeus/Hogan', 'promos', 'matches', 'perhaps', 'Hulk', 'relationship', 'Vince', 'association', 'TNA', 'might', 'have', 'do', 'well.If', 'enjoy', 'wrestling', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'good', 'cheesy', '80s', 'action', 'flick', 'movie']",N/A

Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply.  After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------When WWE finally released the Hulk Hogan/Tiny Lister flick ""No Holds Barred"" on DVD in 2012, I was overjoyed.  Not because it's a good movie - far from it - but because it has special sentimental childhood value to me, so it was a film I wanted to have as part of my current video library (I had previously owned it on VHS and laserdisc).  When that disc came out, two things I wondered about were (1) Why was there no simultaneous Blu-ray release?, and (2) Why does the DVD not include the tie-in wrestling matches and other promotional materials that WWE has in their massive tape library?  The only extra on the DVD is a photo gallery.  I put off buying the DVD for over a year because it wasn't worth the price being charged for so little content.A few weeks ago, when I read that the film had just been released on Blu-ray, and with TWO of the tie-in wrestling matches, I was again overjoyed.  I could finally have it on Blu-ray AND have TWO of the tie-in wrestling matches.  (I don't remember if there were any more tie-in wrestling matches, though Tiny Lister DID appear in WCW as Z-Gangsta, so that's somewhat related.)  The two bonus tie-in wrestling matches included are:* Summerslam Match (8/28/1989, 29:51) - Zeus & ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage with Sensational Sherri vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake with Miss Elizabeth.* ""No Holds Barred"" Steel Cage Match (12/27/1989, 18:12) - Zeus & ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage with Sensational Sherri vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake.My heart absolutely sank when I played these matches and heard the most atrocious audio abomination playing in place of Hulk Hogan's classic ""Real American"" theme song.  Yes, the song that defines the Hulk Hogan character has been replaced with music that not only doesn't sound even remotely close to ""Real American"", but is pure torture to listen to.  Because - SPOILER ALERT - Hulk's team wins both matches, you are forced to hear this audio abomination at the beginning AND end of each match.  What I don't understand is WHY ""Real American"" was replaced.  It's been used on many WWE DVDs, such as those devoted to Hogan.  I *think* WWE might have even bought the music, or at least the perpetual rights to it (though I could be wrong about that).Offhand, it seems that Howard Finkel might have re-recorded his ring intro for Hulk so that the music could be replaced.  I'm sure about this on the second match, where there is no commentary heard at all during the replacement music.  Since that seems odd, I'd bet WWE doesn't have the commentary on a separate track, so they just had to cut out all of the commentary that was originally heard under ""Real American"".The other bonus feature on the Blu-ray is the photo gallery that was on the DVD, except all images are shown in the full HD widescreen and are not framed into tiny boxes like on the DVD (the tradeoff is that the very top and bottom of the images is cut off on the Blu-ray).  There are a total of 42 images on the Blu-ray.  The DVD has one more image; the 26th image showing Rip by Randy's hospital bed.  I have a feeling that this image was accidentally left off the Blu-ray as I see no reason for it to have been purposely removed.  I uploaded a copy of it to the product image gallery here on Amazon so all Blu-ray owners can get a copy of it.The movie itself appears to be the same as on the DVD (I didn't compare them).  Both have the New Line Cinema logo replaced with the WWE Studios logo at the start.  The Blu-ray ends after the credits fade out, while the DVD shows a blue PG-13 rating screen after the credits.  The movie runs 1:32:43 and contains 12 chapters.The DVD has boot-up ads for WWE Home Video, ECW Unreleased Vol. 1, and Bending The Rules (movie with Edge and Jamie Kennedy).  The Blu-ray doesn't have the first two, but has the last one and SEVEN MORE trailers shown at boot-up for all of the other WWE-produced movies.  You have to click ""next"" on your remote to skip through all of the them (you can't jump straight to the menu).  That's really annoying.Overall, the Blu-ray is a vast improvement over the DVD, but falls short of what *could* have been - especially with the replacement of Hulk's ""Real American"" theme music.",3,"Blu-Ray Has Better Extras, But They Replaced Hulk's ""Real American"" Music In Them!!!",1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,4580,"['Below', 'review', 'product', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'BLU-RAY', 'Amazon', 'may', 'display', 'review', 'page', 'version', 'product', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'apply', 'reading', 'review', 'please', 'click', 'link', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'product', 'review', 'same', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'for.', 'When', 'WWE', 'finally', 'released', 'Hulk', 'Hogan/Tiny', 'Lister', 'flick', 'No', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'DVD', '2012', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'Not', 'good', 'movie', 'far', 'special', 'sentimental', 'childhood', 'value', 'was', 'film', 'wanted', 'have', 'part', 'current', 'video', 'library', 'had', 'previously', 'owned', 'VHS', 'laserdisc', 'When', 'disc', 'came', 'out', 'two', 'things', 'wondered', 'were', '1', 'Why', 'was', 'simultaneous', 'Blu-ray', 'release', '2', 'Why', 'DVD', 'not', 'include', 'tie-in', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'other', 'promotional', 'materials', 'WWE', 'massive', 'tape', 'library', 'only', 'extra', 'DVD', 'photo', 'gallery', 'put', 'off', 'buying', 'DVD', 'year', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'price', 'being', 'charged', 'so', 'little', 'content.A', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'when', 'read', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'TWO', 'tie-in', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'was', 'again', 'overjoyed', 'could', 'finally', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'AND', 'have', 'TWO', 'tie-in', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'were', 'more', 'tie-in', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'Tiny', 'Lister', 'DID', 'appear', 'WCW', 'Z-Gangsta', 'somewhat', 'related', 'two', 'tie-in', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'included', 'are', '*', 'Summerslam', 'Match', '8/28/1989', '29:51', 'Zeus', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'Sensational', 'Sherri', 'vs.', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Brutus', 'Beefcake', 'Miss', 'Elizabeth', '*', 'No', 'Holds', 'Barred', 'Steel', 'Cage', 'Match', '12/27/1989', '18:12', 'Zeus', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'Sensational', 'Sherri', 'vs.', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Brutus', 'Beefcake.My', 'heart', 'absolutely', 'sank', 'when', 'played', 'matches', 'heard', 'most', 'atrocious', 'audio', 'abomination', 'playing', 'place', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'classic', 'Real', 'American', 'theme', 'song', 'Yes', 'song', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'character', 'been', 'replaced', 'music', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'sound', 'even', 'remotely', 'close', 'Real', 'American', 'pure', 'torture', 'listen', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Hulk', 'team', 'matches', 'are', 'forced', 'hear', 'audio', 'abomination', 'beginning', 'AND', 'end', 'match', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'WHY', 'Real', 'American', 'was', 'replaced', 'been', 'used', 'many', 'WWE', 'DVDs', 'such', 'devoted', 'Hogan', '*think*', 'WWE', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'bought', 'music', 'least', 'perpetual', 'rights', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', '.Offhand', 'Howard', 'Finkel', 'might', 'have', 're-recorded', 'ring', 'intro', 'Hulk', 'so', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'replaced', ""'m"", 'sure', 'second', 'match', 'where', 'commentary', 'heard', 'replacement', 'music', 'odd', ""'d"", 'bet', 'WWE', ""n't"", 'have', 'commentary', 'separate', 'track', 'just', 'had', 'cut', 'out', 'commentary', 'was', 'originally', 'heard', 'Real', 'American', 'other', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Blu-ray', 'photo', 'gallery', 'was', 'DVD', 'images', 'are', 'shown', 'full', 'HD', 'widescreen', 'are', 'not', 'framed', 'tiny', 'boxes', 'DVD', 'tradeoff', 'very', 'top', 'bottom', 'images', 'cut', 'off', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'total', '42', 'images', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'one', 'more', 'image', '26th', 'image', 'showing', 'Rip', 'Randy', 'hospital', 'bed', 'have', 'feeling', 'image', 'was', 'accidentally', 'left', 'off', 'Blu-ray', 'see', 'reason', 'have', 'been', 'purposely', 'removed', 'uploaded', 'copy', 'product', 'image', 'gallery', 'here', 'Amazon', 'all', 'Blu-ray', 'owners', 'can', 'get', 'copy', 'it.The', 'movie', 'be', 'same', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare', 'have', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'logo', 'replaced', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'logo', 'start', 'Blu-ray', 'ends', 'credits', 'fade', 'out', 'DVD', 'blue', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'screen', 'credits', 'movie', '1:32:43', '12', 'chapters.The', 'DVD', 'boot-up', 'ads', 'WWE', 'Home', 'Video', 'ECW', 'Unreleased', 'Vol', '1', 'Bending', 'Rules', 'movie', 'Edge', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'have', 'first', 'two', 'last', 'one', 'SEVEN', 'MORE', 'trailers', 'shown', 'boot-up', 'other', 'WWE-produced', 'movies', 'have', 'click', 'next', 'remote', 'skip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'straight', 'menu', 'really', 'annoying.Overall', 'Blu-ray', 'vast', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'short', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'especially', 'replacement', 'Hulk', 'Real', 'American', 'theme', 'music']",N/A

Meanwhile, the evil and deliberately designed, (comically) effeminate males of the `World Television Network' plot television domination of the `Sports Entertainment' industry at Rips expense!

Joan Severance is an 80's hottie, the 'poster babe' as to what big hair and tight skirts can do for a movie.

There IS a difference! Closed Caption does NOT work over HDMI cables! I would not have bought the DVD if I had known that it was just 'Closed Captioned' instead of 'Subtitled'.

Most of the time, you don't notice it, but there are several scenes where actors' faces and heads get chopped. Why can't they do in DVD what they do to old movied in Blu-Ray such as Wizard of Oz.
