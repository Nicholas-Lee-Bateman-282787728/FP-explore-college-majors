Scott believes in himself and in luck, while missionary priest Alan Hale tries to make him see that God's hand can be found all over.  Morgan is good in the lead role, and well supported by Hale and many familiar character actors with faces you might remember, even if their names escape you.  The film isn't quite as moralistic as the title would suggest, although Morgan's gradual acceptance of God's power is certainly at the heart of the film. I imagine that the image of God taking care of everyone must have been a comfort to audiences at a time when the world had been turned upside down. The film is also filled with some terrific air battles, replete with some bad Japanese trash talking (did Forties' audiences buy this?). I've seen enough Forties war films to expect that, as well as some stiff, corny dialogue between the fliers, and I find that part of the fun of watching these kinds of movies.

670382,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005NTOF,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[16, 17]","The oldest book in my possession is my Landmark Books #105 copy of John Toland's book about ""The Flying Tigers.""  When I was given this book as a birthday present as a boy I happened to be living on Chennault Drive on McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, so there was something to be said for knowing the story of the man whose name was on the street sign on the corner.  There was also the fact that the P40B-Tomahawk with its shark teeth was a cool looking fighter plane and that there were Americans who were fighting the bad guys before the United States entered World War II.Based on Colonel Robert L. Scott's memoirs, ""God Is My Co-Pilot"" tells of how Scott (Dennis Morgan) had always dreamed of being a fighter pilot but when World War II starts he is stuck flying transport planes over ""The Hump"" into China.  But then he persuades General Claire Lee Chennault (Raymond Massey) to let him fly with the Flying Tigers, the American Volunteer Group that was fighting the Japanese in the skies over China before Pearl Harbor.  By the time the Flying Tigers are replaced by the U.S. Army Air Corps, Scott has made his reputation and assumed a key leadership role in the group.  The title comes into play periodically when Scott talks with Big Mike (Alan Hale, Sr.) a priest ministering to the Chinese, who is available for brief discussions on the role of faith in combat.  But mostly the film is about shooting down lots and lots of Japanese aircraft.From a historical perspective the film is more accurate than John Wayne's ""Flying Tigers"" movie, which is more of a traditional World War II melodrama (two buddies fight the Japanese and each other for the girl they both love).  For example, ""Tex"" Hill was one of the key characters in Toland's book and he shows up here in a major role, played by John Ridgely.  More importantly, you get a sense for a real group of fighter pilots, flying a small number of outdated airplanes against the newer and faster Zeroes of the Imperial Japanese Air Force and doing more than hold their own.  This is primarily Scott's story, but the history of the Flying Tigers and the pilots that replaced them is still the backbone of the narrative.  You also have some foreshadowing of ""12 O'Clock High,"" where it looks like Scott will not be able to go on the big mission, just when the Americans are finally going on the offensive to finish off the Japanese.  But unlike General Frank Savage, Colonel Scott has that whole co-pilot thing going for him, not to mention a priest, and a commanding general who still considers himself a fighter pilot at heart.Keep in mind the movie was made in 1945, which explains the vitriolic racism underlying the aerial combat as the American pilots banter with Tokyo Joe (Richard Loo), the Japanese ace.  When Chennault's aviators bomb Hong Kong, the Japanese slap a woman in a prisoner of war camp cheering the sight.  Then there is the contrast with the scenes back in Scott's hometown of Macon, Georgia, where whites and blacks celebrate his kills with equal joy.  So the stereotypes are a little unsettling on both sides, but this is to be expected for a movie that was made while the war was still going on (""God Is My Co-Pilot"" premiered on February 21, 1945), where propaganda was always a consideration.  Fortunately that racist elements are not the main part of the film and the aerial combat sequences are pretty good, at least until the pilots starting tossing insults at each other (Scott's coup de grace for Joe is, ""There's your six feet of China. Go fill it up"").",4,The story of one of the aces of Chennault's Flying Tigers,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,3551,"['oldest', 'book', 'possession', 'Landmark', 'Books', '105', 'copy', 'John', 'Toland', 'book', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'When', 'was', 'given', 'book', 'birthday', 'present', 'boy', 'happened', 'be', 'living', 'Chennault', 'Drive', 'McGuire', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'New', 'Jersey', 'was', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'knowing', 'story', 'man', 'name', 'was', 'street', 'sign', 'corner', 'was', 'also', 'fact', 'P40B-Tomahawk', 'shark', 'teeth', 'was', 'cool', 'looking', 'fighter', 'plane', 'were', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'United', 'States', 'entered', 'World', 'War', 'II.Based', 'Colonel', 'Robert', 'L.', 'Scott', 'memoirs', 'God', 'Co-Pilot', 'tells', 'how', 'Scott', 'Dennis', 'Morgan', 'had', 'always', 'dreamed', 'being', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'when', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'stuck', 'flying', 'transport', 'planes', 'Hump', 'China', 'then', 'General', 'Claire', 'Lee', 'Chennault', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'let', 'fly', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'American', 'Volunteer', 'Group', 'was', 'fighting', 'Japanese', 'skies', 'China', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'time', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'are', 'replaced', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Air', 'Corps', 'Scott', 'made', 'reputation', 'assumed', 'key', 'leadership', 'role', 'group', 'title', 'play', 'periodically', 'when', 'Scott', 'talks', 'Big', 'Mike', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Sr.', 'priest', 'ministering', 'Chinese', 'who', 'available', 'brief', 'discussions', 'role', 'faith', 'combat', 'mostly', 'film', 'shooting', 'down', 'lots', 'lots', 'Japanese', 'historical', 'perspective', 'film', 'more', 'accurate', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'movie', 'more', 'traditional', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'melodrama', 'two', 'buddies', 'fight', 'Japanese', 'other', 'girl', 'love', 'example', 'Tex', 'Hill', 'was', 'one', 'key', 'characters', 'Toland', 'book', 'up', 'here', 'major', 'role', 'played', 'John', 'Ridgely', 'More', 'importantly', 'get', 'sense', 'real', 'group', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'flying', 'small', 'number', 'outdated', 'airplanes', 'newer', 'faster', 'Zeroes', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'Air', 'Force', 'doing', 'more', 'hold', 'own', 'primarily', 'Scott', 'story', 'history', 'Flying', 'Tigers', 'pilots', 'replaced', 'still', 'backbone', 'narrative', 'also', 'have', 'foreshadowing', '12', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'where', 'Scott', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'big', 'mission', 'just', 'when', 'Americans', 'are', 'finally', 'going', 'offensive', 'finish', 'off', 'Japanese', 'General', 'Frank', 'Savage', 'Colonel', 'Scott', 'whole', 'co-pilot', 'thing', 'going', 'not', 'mention', 'priest', 'commanding', 'general', 'who', 'still', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'heart.Keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1945', 'vitriolic', 'racism', 'underlying', 'aerial', 'combat', 'American', 'pilots', 'banter', 'Tokyo', 'Joe', 'Richard', 'Loo', 'Japanese', 'ace', 'When', 'Chennault', 'aviators', 'bomb', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Japanese', 'slap', 'woman', 'prisoner', 'war', 'camp', 'cheering', 'sight', 'Then', 'contrast', 'scenes', 'back', 'Scott', 'hometown', 'Macon', 'Georgia', 'where', 'whites', 'blacks', 'celebrate', 'kills', 'equal', 'joy', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'little', 'unsettling', 'sides', 'be', 'expected', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'war', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'God', 'Co-Pilot', 'premiered', 'February', '21', '1945', 'where', 'propaganda', 'was', 'always', 'consideration', 'Fortunately', 'racist', 'elements', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'aerial', 'combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'pilots', 'starting', 'tossing', 'insults', 'other', 'Scott', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'Joe', 'six', 'feet', 'China', 'Go', 'fill', 'up']",God Is My Co-Pilot VHS
