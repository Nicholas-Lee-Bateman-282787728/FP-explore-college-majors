1539827,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B007Y6CSNU,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 2]","Lola Verus starring the always delightful Greta Gerwig is a smart and funny romantic drama about a woman who gets dumped 3 weeks before her wedding. The writing is strong, the acting is solid, and the whole premise of the film is so refreshing. Lola is afraid to be alone, she will do anything to feel wanted and desired again by men, even if that means sleeping with those men way too soon. Lola is 29 and the love of her life calls off the wedding because he's scared. Lola is shocked and reeling from the break-up, she sort of has a mini-breakdown along the way. During the course of a year, Lola learns that being single is not a bad thing. Lola is a relatable woman, she has insecurities and hang-ups, but she still keeps going and living her life on her own terms. I like the ending because Lola ends up saving herself instead of a man saving her. Excellent and realistic indie film, give it a try!

By my count she now has 6 films that have or will come out in 2012 including this one.  Here she plays a 29 year old part time waitress trying to get her Ph.D. by explaining great literary pieces.  Many will compare this ""relationship"" film to ""Sex in the City"" or Lena Dunham's ""Tiny Furniture/Girls"" and like those films/TV series, New York City is a central character.The film opens with Lola about to get married to Luke (Joel Kinnaman, ""Safe House""), a hunky dude she lives with.  He gets cold feet a few weeks before the wedding, which is catastrophic for Lola.  Propped up by her former hippie parents (Debra Winger and Bill Pullman) and a couple clich&eacute;d friends (co-writer Zoe Lister Jones and Hamish Linklater), the story follows Lola's attempt to regain her footing.  She's confused and convinced that no one wants her, so begins a series of one night stands that includes her friend Henry (Linklater).  I'm surprised she didn't try Alice (Jones).  Now that would have been interesting.After dipping her toe again with Luke and several all night drunken binges, Lola finally realizes she must confront her own self doubt before moving on.  I don't mean to be a spoiler but the general story here is nothing new and nothing most haven't seen before.  What is interesting is Greta Gerwig in her first lead performance.

I caught ""Lola Versus"" just recently at the Esquire, the Cincinnati indie-movies theatre.""Lola Versus"" brings the story of Lola (played by Greta Gerwig), who is in a seemingly perfect relationship with boyfriend Like (played by Joel Kinnaman), as it is portrayed in the first 5 min. of the movie. In fact Luke proposes to Lola, who happily says yes. But alas, with only weeks before the wedding date, Luke breaks up with Lola. In the rest of the movie we see Lola struggling to cope with this devastating news, counting on her close friends to help her, including best girl pal Alice (played by Lister Jones) and best guy pal Henry (played by Hamish Linklater). It would ruin your viewing experience if I spelled out how it all unfolds, you'll just have to see it for yourself.Several comments: first, the script is loosely based on the real life experience of Lister Jones and Wein breaking up for about a year and how Lister Jones coped as a newly single woman in her mid/late 20s. Second, I first noticed Greata Gerwig in ""Greenberg"" some 3-4 years ago, and in ""Lola Versus"" Gerwig again oozes charm (and talent) and she easily carries the movie on her shoulders. Her performance just transfixed me. Third, keep an eye out for Debra WInger and Bill Pullman as Lola's parents, in particular Pullman delivers some memorable lines. In all, I can't emphasize enough how charmed I was by the movie. This is way off the radar screenfrom your mainstream Hollywood fare. One of those ""little movies that could"", and then did.
