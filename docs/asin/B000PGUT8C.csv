I watched all of them, Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, etc and I will continue to support those series when the become available on DVDs. I already bought the first 9 seasons of Dallas, and the 3 of Dynasty.Regarding KNOTS LANDING, I believe the show became much better after the 4th season, so I wish Warner would release the seasons more quickly!I want to say I really appreciate that the French subtitles are offered on the DVDs of Knots. Those subtitles were also available on the first seasons of Dallas, but not later on.Knots Landing being available on DVD will give a chance to new people to discover the series.

Donna Mills did for Knots what Joan Collins did for Dynasty....to a degree. It was more a combination of Abby's scheming and the writing improving. I disagree with the fact that most reviewers are writing that Knots did not become good until its fourth or fifth season. This is not true. Knots starting improving in both its storylines and its ratings in season 3.(I wonder if Don Murray was kicking himself when Knots Landing hit its stride only after he left. I seriously doubt he left Knots to guest star on The Facts of Life.)Spoiler alert!! I began watching Knots Landing toward the end of the third season when Abby and Gary were having their affair. I still remember the priceless looks on all three four faces, Gary, Abby, Karen and especially Val's when she(Val) walked into the apartment and caught Gary and Abby in bed together. From that moment I was hooked and could not wait until the next fall to see what was going to happen next.Like the others, I do agree that everyone should purchase Season 2 so that more seasons will be released.

1071133,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B000PGUT8C,Edward Aycock,"[4, 4]","The 1979-80 TV season was followed by a strike that led to the following season beginning late.  Warner Brothers thoughtfully has given us a taste of what that experience must have felt like for viewers back in 1980 - and maximized it - by making us wait three entire years between the first and second seasons of ""Knots Landing"" on DVD.  Thanks, WB!  Never mind that for many devoted ""Knots"" viewers, the first season is only a prologue to the actual show, a thirteen-episode intro that sets up all the characters.  Season Two is when the real fun begins and that's largely because of Abby.  But it's not because Abby rules alone;  it's because she meshes so well with the other characters.  Suddenly, the show springs to life.Why does Abby bring so much to the show?  Because she's not pure malice like JR and she's not an over-the-top vamp like Alexis.  Abby is well-written and rather than being a real villain, she just happens to be one of the heroes of the show who does her own thing.  After a peaceful beginning in the early episodes of Season Two, we get down to the rivalry that defines the show for years: Karen vs. Abby.  Sure, Abby eventually causes trouble in Val's marriage but it's Abby's relationship with Karen that's central. It's so much fun to watch it start from the hug Karen gives Abby when she first arrives at Seaview Circle to the fast deterioration of their friendship.But that's just part of the joys that await us in Season Two.  We get the first signs of trouble in Gary and Val's marriage, a crossover visit from ""Dallas"" Kristen Shepard, Sid being convicted of attempted rape, the continuing dysfunction that is the Avery marriage.  And then there' Kenny and Ginger.This season does end in a rather intense cliffhanger and I can only hope that Warner Brothers doesn't make us wait three more years.  Come on, ""Dallas"" is more than 75% released and we're only on Season Two of ""Knots""?  Please buy this so we can get the entire series.

Jeff is angry and says she's not playing 'fair' with him. One of Laura's clients kisses her, but she says she can't cheat on Richard. Abby tells Richard that it's over between them.12- PlayersRichard gets a job with Kippler, Janson and Stern. He apologizes to Laura for how he's been treating her, but secretly is upset that she earns more than he does. Ginger finally tells Kenny that she's pregnant, but that they need to work out their problems before he can move back in. Karen is upset that Linda is in love with Sid, and is scared that they might be having an affair. Sid and Linda take a test drive and the car breaks down on a deserted desert road. Linda tells Sid she loves him. They kiss, but he says he can't have an affair with her. Sid tells Karen he didn't have an affair with Linda, but jokes that if he had he wouldn't tell her, because he hates to 'brag'. Karen is not amused.13- The Loudest WordKenny goes to see Ginger at school and implores her to get back together with him. She still refuses. Kenny shows up at her Lamaze class and they argue. Ginger feels bad, and finally tells him that both she and the baby need him. Val's doctor finds a malignant growth in her colon and needs to operate. Gary can't handle it - he feels so guilty about how he's treated Val, and totally breaks down. He calls Miss Ellie weeping, so Bobby comes to support him while Val's in the hospital. The doctor is able to remove all of the cancer.14- Moments of TruthThe men take Kenny out to celebrate and the women give Ginger a baby shower at Val's house. Three criminals break into the house to rob the women. Diana, in the kitchen, escapes and calls police. The robbers then take the women hostage. A swat team is called. Tempers flare among the men, who are feeling helpless. After 8 hours, the swat team apprehends the robbers and everybody is okay.15- Man of the HourJeff picks up the kids and Abby is afraid he has kidnapped them when she can't locate them. Jeff finally returns them and says they were camping. Ginger's sister Cindy visits, and gives Eric marijuana to hold for her. Sid finds it and is very upset. At a party, Cindy freaks out and runs into the ocean. Eric saves her, but she's in a coma. The doctor says the pot had angel dust in it. Eric is upset as everyone blames him, thinking it's his pot. Cindy finally wakes up, and tells everyone that it wasn't Eric's pot.16- More Than FriendsAbby comes on to Gary, but then says she's kidding when she sees how uncomfortable he is. Everyone thinks Laura's having an affair with Scooter, because of all their flirting. Laura tells Scooter that they can't really have an affair, because they're both married. Richard asks Laura if she'd like to discuss his affair with Abby, so that they can start over. Val's night school teacher is Earl Trent. He invites Val over to work on a story, and then asks her to sleep with him to get even with Gary and Judy. Val refuses and he starts to force her, but then breaks down weeping. Gary comes over and apologizes to Earl for having an affair with his wife.17- DesignsJ.R. comes to town (again). He wants to form a corporation with Sid and patent the engine that Sid invented. Sid refuses. Abby steals the engine plans and gives them to J.R., and has him sign a contract to protect her interests. They sleep together. Karen tells Sid that Abby stole the plans, but he doesn't believe her. Karen and Val are suspicious when Jeff comes to pick up the kids, and packs all of their things into his van. Karen goes to J.R.'s hotel to tell Abby she thinks Jeff kidnapped the kids, but Abby doesn't believe her and says Jeff is just trying to scare her again.18- SqueezeplayJeff doesn't return the kids and Abby's really worried. The FBI question Gary about Frank and Roy, and Gary finally admits his illegal dealings to Sid. Abby claims to be innocent, and Sid believe her. Gary and Sid agree to do a sting operation for the FBI, and Frank and Roy are arrested. Sid and Gary will have to testify, so the FBI guards them. One of the mechanics at KLMotors lets the brake fluid out of Sid's car. Abby receives a tape from Jeff telling her he took the kids because she is a bad mother. Abby totally flips out, so Karen calls Sid to come home to help Abby. Sid and an FBI agent get in his car to drive home. As they drive around the road, Sid realizes the breaks won't work. The car goes out of control crashes over the side of an embankment down to the beach below.",5,"""Knots Landing: Season 2!!

Maybe if enough of us use it, it'll convince Warner Brothers to finally follow through.  C'mon, it only takes a minute, but if you're not logged on at Amazon at the moment it might take a little bit longer.  Just do it...I agree, Season 1 was shorter than I would've liked--only 13 episodes, which makes sense as KL didn't start until late December.  Warner Brothers might want to do what was done with Dynasty: Dynasty, too almost didn't see 2nd come out for the same reason but when it finally did, both 1 and 2 were bundled together.  I'd offer KL 1 and 2 together once 2nd's finally available, or 2nd alone if so desired.I gave this one only 1 star because we're still waiting for it.Update, finally: I see I'm late in updating my review for this product.  Originally I gave this product 1 star but now it's all 5 stars.  I bought this set at a store and enjoyed this season.  S1 was CC only, no subtitles available.  S2 is not CC but available with English subtitles.

Solomon,"[2, 11]","I , like most people who have ordered, watched and written about ""Knots Landing"" was  a great fan of the series back in the day (and thats saying something as ""Dallas"" and ""Knots"" were 'It' as far as soaps went for me and my tastes in recent years has been very ""Sopranos"", ""Six Feet under"", ""Mad Men"" oriented)It was a flavoursome piece of nonsense with some great actors and a lot of fun, especially the last few episodes before it ended.""Desperate Housewives"" is boring cliche in comparison.BUt these early episodes are hard to watch. Obviously the reason the initial release of the series did so badly is, as with season 2 (despite the definite improvement of Donna Mills doing dirty deeds so delicously)its all just so dated.From memory the series didnt start to hit its mark till about half way through season 3 and then blossomed in Season 4 when they split up Gary and Val and it became a serial instead of these self contained episodes. The episodic nature of the early series is so so dated, the look of the actors is hilariously bad (Michelle Lee looks anorexic and the hair looks like a clump of horse hair stuck to her head) How these actors must cringe when they see themselves back then. !!!My point is that for the series to succeed on DVD , Warners need to release the first three seasons very quickly to get it into the meat and potatoes of the series when it took off in the ratings from season 1982-83 onwards.If I remember rightly the series was almost cancelled several times in the early days which was why they kept plonking Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy et al into the series(dont know where they ever found the time). So lets get season 3 out of the way quickly and release season 4 when the series really did take off.

Dallas season box sets have obviously taken off as they are currently up to Season 11. If I was a key decision maker at Warners for dvd releases, I'd reboot and re-release Knots Landing seasons 1 & 2 together, throw in some good interviews, a TV special or 2 and redo the packaging with a more dynamic design with cross over characters from Dallas for more customer appeal and call it special edition/limited edition. Then it would walk off the shelves. Once customers have watched season 2, they will be hooked to buy remaining seasons.

Zuncic ""Scotty Z""","[9, 9]","A couple of nights ago the Home Theater Forum presented Warner Brothers Home Video (T.V. and Animation divisions only) for a chat.  During the forum, Warner Brothers FINALLY said they are giving KNOTS LANDING another chance by releasing SEASON 2 sometime in 2009.  Therefore, in order for this series to have continued success, We, the fans and any other curious viewers, new viewers, etc... need to show support to buy this series. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! THE FIRST WEEK SALES WILL DETERMINE CONTINUED DVD SEASON SETS OF KNOTS LANDING.....Very much like a new movie, when it's released in theaters, the first week opening sales determines if a movie should/could have a sequel. (think in terms of the recent ""Dark Knight"" movie with Heath Ledger) which was a box office hit the first week (and beyond) when it was in theaters this summer.  The movie is also coming out with a sequel within the next 2-3 years because of this success.Therefore if you apply those terms to the first week sales of the DVD release of Knots Landing's 2nd season, it will have continued success, like it's sister show DALLAS.  Please, I know the economy has not been the greatest (and it seems to be getting worse) and soon most of us will only be able to watch t.v. at home anyway (instead of going to the movies), please save your money and support this wonderful show. PLEASE BUY THIS THE 2ND SEASON THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! If all is successful, Warner Brothers will continue to produce the remaining seasons of this show as well as another show....FALCON CREST.....that's right, all you FALCON CREST fans out there, according to Warner Brothers chat the other night, sales of KNOTS LANDING will also help determine releasing not only more KNOTS LANDING, but FALCON CREST as well. So FALCON CREST fans.....listen up....check out Knots Landing Season 1 (now) & Season 2 (in 2009)!!!  Your show will be next up to bat if you do this.I hope this helps the fans of both shows understand how important buying your favorite show the first week its release helps determine whether or not the studios will continue releasing a series (and other series). JUST A REMINDER: click on the Amazon's wish list reminder link to let you know when KNOTS LANDING SEASON 2 is released (it's definitely coming in 2009!!).  Then when Warner makes the annoucement for the release, Amazon will let you know via email and then you can preorder your copy!!  Thanks for reading!!!P.S. For all those trivia buffs....Knots Landing Season 2 is the first season DONNA MILLS appears as ABBY, the michievious blonde bombshell who causes havoc around the cul-de-sac.",5,"KNOTS LANDING SEASON 2 IN 2009!!!

The second year stormed onto television screens in the fall of 1980 with the arrival of beautiful Donna Mills in the role of Sid's sister Abby Cunningham. The producers wisely realized what was missing from the ""Knots Landing"" canvas was a good villin, so Abby arrived and shooked things up in the cul-de-sac. This casting stunt would later be replicated on ABC's ""Dynasty"" with the arrival of Joan Collins.Like its other seasons and unlike other primetime soaps, ""Knots Landing"" was far more realistic in their story-telling depicting issues that often made headlines such as rape, alcoholism, and hostage situations, the later which was used in an early season two episode where the women of ""Knots Landing"" were held captive by a bunch of maniacs while holding a baby shower. This particular episode is still one of my favorite ""Knots Landing"" shows.This four disc set includes all 18 season two episodes, but is sparce on bonuses.The season finished at #28 in the national Nielsen's with a 15.1 rating.Sadly, like season one this set of ""Knots..."" didn't sell very well and there are currently no plans for the studio to release future DVD's.

Abby was 14 years his junior, and he'd always been oblivious of her scheming ways, but Karen was suspicious of almost everything Abby did. When Abby took a job at Knots Landing Motors, she helped Gary out of a bind with mobsters by going to his brother J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman). Abby went out of her way to make sure Val found out Gary was cheating on her with Judy Trent (Jane Elliott), the attractive wife of Earl Trent, a man he was sponsoring in Alcoholics Anonymous. Even though Abby set her sights on Gary, she settled for Richard, taking no great effort to conceal the affair from Laura, who took on a career in real estate and began a flirtation with her boss, Scooter Warren (Allan Miller). Abby dumped Richard when her ex-husband Jeff Cunningham (Barry Jenner) threatened to take her children away. Viewers discovered exactly how manipulative Abby could be when the women of Knots Landing held a baby shower for Ginger and were interrupted by criminals who held them hostage; Abby seduced one of the thugs, helping to save them.Season 2 is better than season 1. Most of the credit goes to Abby and the change of pace the show was taking. I absolutely love this... but where are seasons 3 through 14? This show was so popular in the 1980s, so why not have further DVD releases? I definitely think there's a fan base out there. There's fan petitions online and begging pages all over Facebook for further releases. We'd buy them, Warner Brothers, you just got to release them first.

Every Soap Opera needs their Witch(actually thinking of another word) and Abby Fit The Bill Perfectly! Knots Landing to Me was The Best of  The 80's Night Soaps  because It's Characters were More Easy to Relate too than characters such as JR Ewing or Alexis Carrington(Loved those shows, I just dont wear diamonds and drive around in Rolls Royce's). The Knot's Landing Characters faced Problems that everyday People Faced and The Plot Lines were Never Over The Top(well, okay, maybe some Plotlines were, Val's Twins being Kidnapped, Karen Being Kidnapped, etc etc). I am glad that the Studio is giving Knots Landing a Second Chance and I hope that  the fans will support the release of this DVD so that Season 3 Will Be released!

1071165,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B000PGUT8C,William,"[1, 1]","Having viewed Series 2 of KNOTS LANDING on DVD, I do agree with Solomon from NSW Australia that these episodes are quite dated and mostly self contained episodes (like Season 1), however it slowly starts to feel more like a serial as Season 2 unfolds mid-way through. For example, the ongoing problems with the lawyer next door, Abby continously flirting, and the alcholic man that Garry helps.The quality of the film on the DVD is disappointing - especially when you compare it with some of the seasons of Dallas and Dynasty which have been cleaned up well for DVD.  It makes you wonder if Warner Bros really care about this series and are just bowing to pressure. Still, we should be grateful to have it at all, and perhaps the film stock was just too bad to work with.Many KNOTS LANDING fans agree that the show really took off from Season 4 onwards. This is true. The early years of the show were problematic. Donna Mills was brought on to add some spark, although the show still almost got axed. Fortunately, Donna Mills character of Abby developed and the show took on more of a serial nature like any good soap opera should be.While the show got truly better from Season 4 onwards, Warner Bros obviously have to release the early years first.  I just hope they continue to release season after season. Please don't stop Warner Bros!  If possible, could you please release them in quick succession?  I'm now ready for Season 3 and 4 ... and then the rest. I'd also like to see all the KNOTS LANDING specials released too (like 'Back to the Cul-de-sac'). ThanksDon't get me wrong, Season 2 has its moments, and there is some fine acting in there too. But its a hit and miss season. Fortunately, the fine acting from Michelle Lee and Joan Van Ark keeps the show watchable. Also the show has a more 'down to earth' feeling than Dallas or Dynasty.",3,DVD - Series 2,1241481600,"05 5, 2009",2009,1849,"['Having', 'viewed', 'Series', '2', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'DVD', 'do', 'agree', 'Solomon', 'NSW', 'Australia', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'dated', 'mostly', 'contained', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'however', 'slowly', 'feel', 'more', 'serial', 'Season', '2', 'unfolds', 'mid-way', 'example', 'ongoing', 'problems', 'lawyer', 'next', 'door', 'Abby', 'continously', 'flirting', 'alcholic', 'man', 'Garry', 'helps.The', 'quality', 'film', 'DVD', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'when', 'compare', 'seasons', 'Dallas', 'Dynasty', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'well', 'DVD', 'wonder', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'really', 'care', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'bowing', 'pressure', 'Still', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'have', 'perhaps', 'film', 'stock', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'work', 'with.Many', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'fans', 'agree', 'show', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'Season', '4', 'onwards', 'true', 'early', 'years', 'show', 'were', 'problematic', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'was', 'brought', 'add', 'spark', 'show', 'still', 'almost', 'got', 'axed', 'Fortunately', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'character', 'Abby', 'developed', 'show', 'took', 'more', 'serial', 'nature', 'good', 'soap', 'opera', 'should', 'be.While', 'show', 'got', 'truly', 'better', 'Season', '4', 'onwards', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'obviously', 'have', 'release', 'early', 'years', 'first', 'just', 'hope', 'continue', 'release', 'season', 'season', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'possible', 'could', 'please', 'release', 'quick', 'succession', ""'m"", 'now', 'ready', 'Season', '3', '4', 'then', 'rest', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'see', 'KNOTS', 'LANDING', 'specials', 'released', 'too', ""'Back"", 'Cul-de-sac', 'ThanksDo', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Season', '2', 'moments', 'fine', 'acting', 'there', 'too', 'hit', 'miss', 'season', 'Fortunately', 'fine', 'acting', 'Michelle', 'Lee', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'show', 'watchable', 'Also', 'show', 'more', ""'down"", 'earth', 'feeling', 'Dallas', 'Dynasty']",N/A

These episodes are new to me, and with the addition of Abbey, they are becoming more interesting.I initially ordered Season One, and waited forever for Season Two to be released.  Season Two was quickly devoured, and now I am impatiently awaiting the others.  They really need to step up production.  I was annoyed that the quality of the video was down-graded from Season One.
