I like the old re-runs that occasionally air on Bravo and wish those were uncensored and released on DVD. I would take those specials over this anyday.From the very beginning - You can feel the magic is gone in this DVD. Its a bit disappointing. The magic really wasn't there and the audience wasnt with her. Kathy wasn't even Kathy. There were many moments where it was noticeable that she was just grasping for anything to entertain the audience. There was this akward vibe in the air that anyone watching this DVD can sense. I give it four stars because its Kathy, but i'd rather watch the ""Allegedly"" DVD over this. And i have seen that at least a million times.This DVD is only for a true Kathy fan and in all honesty, its not worth the forty-five minutes of semi-good jokes.",4,"Same Kathy, But Not One of Her BEST!",1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,910,"['Same', 'Kathy', 'Not', 'One', 'BEST', 'adore', 'Kathy', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', 'was', 'NOT', 'one', 'better', 'comedy', 'specials', 'like', 'old', 're-runs', 'occasionally', 'air', 'Bravo', 'wish', 'were', 'uncensored', 'released', 'DVD', 'would', 'take', 'specials', 'very', 'beginning', 'can', 'feel', 'magic', 'gone', 'DVD', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'magic', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'audience', 'wasnt', 'Kathy', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Kathy', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'was', 'noticeable', 'was', 'just', 'grasping', 'anything', 'entertain', 'audience', 'was', 'akward', 'vibe', 'air', 'anyone', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'sense', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'Kathy', 'i', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Allegedly', 'DVD', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'least', 'million', 'times.This', 'DVD', 'only', 'true', 'Kathy', 'fan', 'honesty', 'not', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'semi-good', 'jokes']",N/A
