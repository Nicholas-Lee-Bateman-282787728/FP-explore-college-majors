1057345,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000NJMJHA,andy8047,"[1, 2]","This four-season ABC sitcom marks John Travolta's journey to superstardom. Although he was not first-billed like Gabriel Kaplan,Travolta was indeed the star. Travolta's exposure from this series made him a teen idol and landed him a film career which continues today. The theme,simply entitled WELCOME BACK,was written and performed by John B. Sebastian,who also wrote many songs recorded by his 60's pop band Lovin' Spoonful. This series was based on Kaplan's real-life experiences at Brooklyn,New York's James H. Buchanan High School. Kaplan even co-created the series with Alan Sacks. Kaplan is Gabe Kotter,a special education instructor with four students:Vinnie Barbarino(Travolta),Arnold Horshack(Ron Palillo),Juan Epstein(Robert Hegyes) and Washington(Lawrence Hilton Jacobs). Gabe labeled his students as ""sweathogs"". Vinnie was tough,verbally and physically. Marcia Strassman is Julie Kotter,Gabe's wife. Before the opening montage played,there would be Gabe and Julie at their home in private conversation. Interestingly,Hegyes was born in Perth Amboy,New Jersey,like I was and Travolta is a NJ native himself,hailing from Engelwood. Kaplan is a stand-up comedian as well and occasionally still performs today. Strassman later co-starred opposite Rick Moranis in the Disney films HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS and its sequel HONEY I BLEW UP THE KID. During the 1975-79 run of WBK,Travolta did his first three starring films SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,GREASE and MOMENT TO MOMENT,the latter with Lily Tomlin. He bowed out after the third season to concentrate on his film career. Travolta's other hit films include URBAN COWBOY,STAYING ALIVE(sequel to SNF),LOOK WHO'S TALKING,the Oscar-winning PULP FICTION,GET SHORTY and PRIMARY COLORS. During Travolta's teen idol era,he became a recording artist also,having a Philly-soul hit in 1976,LET HER IN. Travolta's other hit recordings are GREASED LIGHTNIN',YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT and SUMMER NIGHTS,all from GREASE and the latter two are duets with his co-star Olivia Newton-John. Gabe garnered other sweathogs after Vinnie's departure,some of them female.

1057348,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000NJMJHA,calvinnme,"[46, 59]","Let's face it, ""Welcome Back Kotter"" was the REAL ""That 70's Show"" - the inner city urban version. You may not remember, but originally the pilot is shown as the third episode of the season, so hopefully that confusing situation will be remedied on the DVD. I can't remember the last time I even saw this show in syndication on channels such as Nick at Nite that specialize in dusting off old sitcoms unseen for years.  The comic premise of the show is that Gabe Kotter, newly graduated from college and certified to teach, has returned to teach the same remedial class of high school misfits of which he was a member ten years earlier. Vice Principal Woodman, who was the object of Gabe's torments and jokes ten years earlier, is still employed at the high school and gives Gabe this job as the ultimate irony and revenge for what Gabe had put him through. Of course, this show is sugar-coated compared to the real problems and issues of a New York City public school in a poor neighborhood, but it had to be since this was a sitcom, not a drama. The show had a great cast playing great characters - there was Horshack, the class nerd with the nasal laugh; Barbarino, the cool maverick who was a little slow on the uptake; Epstein with the mixed Latino/Jewish heritage and the great excused absence notes signed by ""Epstein's mother"", and last but not least, Washington. There was a great common enemy in Mr. Woodman, who you couldn't help but feel a little sorry for. Finally, the show had a great location in Brooklyn and a memorable theme song by John Sebastian that you are much more likely to hear today than see the show from whence it came. For three wonderful seasons from 1975 to 1978 it was a comedy classic. But, alas, all things must come to an end.After John Travolta starred in the back-to-back hits of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease"", he would hardly return anyone's phone calls, much less show up for work on a regular basis. Thus the fourth season not only jumped the shark, it pretty much made it over the Gulf of Mexico. What was really going on behind the scenes in 1978, if I remember correctly, was a bruising battle of the egos catalyzed by Travolta's new-found superstar status. To compensate for all the turmoil and in-fighting among the cast, Kotter is made vice-principal to explain all of Gabe Kaplan's absences, then the show added Stephen Shortridge as an entirely inadequate placeholder for Travolta. The final straw was when the show seemed to be endorsing the marriage of two high-schoolers - Horshack and Mary - and then Horshack began drinking heavily afterwards.The irony is that the stardom status for everyone involved instantaneously evaporated after the show that their egos destroyed was cancelled in 1979. The only one to ever recover their stardom was Travolta, and then it took ten years before he could even land a job playing straight man to a talking baby (""Look Who's Talking""). I hate to sound bitter, but it's hard not to be considering what a great show it was during the first three seasons of its all too-brief four season run.Of course, the issue of the RIAA and copyrighted music comes up once again. Shall we hear the classic ""Welcome Back"" theme song in the opening of each episode, or shall tinny sounding synthesizer music replace it? I hope they don't ruin this DVD like they did with the Bonanza set I bought in which every trace of David Rose's original theme and background music had been erased from the DVD. There's nothing quite like the sight of Little Joe riding into the sunset to the Sound of Muzak, and I can't imagine Welcome Back Kotter without John Sebastian's award winning song opening and closing each episode.",5,"The urban version of ""That 70's Show"" comes to DVD",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,3692,"['Let', 'face', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'was', 'REAL', '70', 'Show', 'inner', 'city', 'urban', 'version', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'originally', 'pilot', 'shown', 'third', 'episode', 'season', 'so', 'hopefully', 'confusing', 'situation', 'will', 'be', 'remedied', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'even', 'saw', 'show', 'syndication', 'channels', 'such', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'specialize', 'dusting', 'off', 'old', 'sitcoms', 'unseen', 'years', 'comic', 'premise', 'show', 'Gabe', 'Kotter', 'newly', 'graduated', 'college', 'certified', 'teach', 'returned', 'teach', 'same', 'remedial', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'misfits', 'was', 'member', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'Vice', 'Principal', 'Woodman', 'who', 'was', 'object', 'Gabe', 'torments', 'jokes', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'still', 'employed', 'high', 'school', 'Gabe', 'job', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'revenge', 'what', 'Gabe', 'had', 'put', 'course', 'show', 'sugar-coated', 'compared', 'real', 'problems', 'issues', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'public', 'school', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'had', 'be', 'was', 'sitcom', 'not', 'drama', 'show', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'playing', 'great', 'characters', 'was', 'Horshack', 'class', 'nerd', 'nasal', 'laugh', 'Barbarino', 'cool', 'maverick', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'uptake', 'Epstein', 'mixed', 'Latino/Jewish', 'heritage', 'great', 'excused', 'absence', 'notes', 'signed', 'Epstein', 'mother', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Washington', 'was', 'great', 'common', 'enemy', 'Mr.', 'Woodman', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'sorry', 'Finally', 'show', 'had', 'great', 'location', 'Brooklyn', 'memorable', 'theme', 'song', 'John', 'Sebastian', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'hear', 'today', 'see', 'show', 'whence', 'came', 'three', 'wonderful', 'seasons', '1975', '1978', 'was', 'comedy', 'classic', 'alas', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end.After', 'John', 'Travolta', 'starred', 'back-to-back', 'hits', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Grease', 'would', 'hardly', 'return', 'anyone', 'phone', 'much', 'less', 'show', 'up', 'work', 'regular', 'basis', 'Thus', 'fourth', 'season', 'not', 'only', 'jumped', 'shark', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'Gulf', 'Mexico', 'What', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'scenes', '1978', 'remember', 'correctly', 'was', 'bruising', 'battle', 'egos', 'catalyzed', 'Travolta', 'new-found', 'superstar', 'status', 'compensate', 'turmoil', 'in-fighting', 'cast', 'Kotter', 'made', 'vice-principal', 'explain', 'Gabe', 'Kaplan', 'absences', 'then', 'show', 'added', 'Stephen', 'Shortridge', 'entirely', 'inadequate', 'placeholder', 'Travolta', 'final', 'straw', 'was', 'when', 'show', 'seemed', 'be', 'endorsing', 'marriage', 'two', 'high-schoolers', 'Horshack', 'Mary', 'then', 'Horshack', 'began', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'afterwards.The', 'irony', 'stardom', 'status', 'everyone', 'involved', 'instantaneously', 'evaporated', 'show', 'egos', 'destroyed', 'was', 'cancelled', '1979', 'only', 'one', 'ever', 'recover', 'stardom', 'was', 'Travolta', 'then', 'took', 'ten', 'years', 'could', 'even', 'land', 'job', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'talking', 'baby', 'Look', 'Who', 'Talking', 'hate', 'sound', 'bitter', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'considering', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'too-brief', 'four', 'season', 'run.Of', 'course', 'issue', 'RIAA', 'copyrighted', 'music', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'Shall', 'hear', 'classic', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'episode', 'shall', 'tinny', 'sounding', 'synthesizer', 'music', 'replace', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'DVD', 'did', 'Bonanza', 'set', 'bought', 'trace', 'David', 'Rose', 'original', 'theme', 'background', 'music', 'had', 'been', 'erased', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'quite', 'sight', 'Little', 'Joe', 'riding', 'sunset', 'Sound', 'Muzak', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'John', 'Sebastian', 'award', 'winning', 'song', 'opening', 'closing', 'episode']",N/A

Watching the first season of Welcome Back, Kotter and hearing the strains of John Sebastian's theme music after all these years, takes one back to a time when John Travolta was just starting out (before Grease and Saturday Night Fever made him a superstar). The success of the show made him a star and you can see it in his performance - he steals practically every scene he's in. However, the show was co-created by Gabriel Kaplan and based largely on real people he knew growing up in Brooklyn and would riff on in his stand-up routines before being discovered.Mr. Kotter and his wife, Julie (Strassman) live modestly (he's a struggling new teacher after all) in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a sofa bed which gives this sitcom a touch of realism that was popular in the 1970s (see All in the Family). Each episode is bookended by Gabe telling Julie a funny story about a member of his family that feels like a stand-up bit complete with a cheesy punch-line that takes us to the opening or closing credits. The attention to realism continues in the classroom with grimy walls adorned with graffiti - exactly as you would expect a tough, Brooklyn high school classroom would be. It is a sharp contrast to the silliness of the storylines and escapades of the Sweathogs.The show has one of the catchiest theme songs in the history of T.V. It was composed and performed by John B. Sebastian (formerly of The Lovin' Spoonful). It is simple yet effective with riffs and lyrics that stick in your head in such a way that it is impossible not to find yourself humming it hours afterwards.Welcome Back, Kotter would go on to influence future sitcoms like Head of the Class that ended up replacing the Sweathogs with brainiac kids and softened any edges to reflect the conservative 1980s. More recently, one only has to look at Ashton Kutcher's Kelso in That `70s Show to see him basically playing a Vinnie Barbarino for the New Millennium.The first disc includes a retrospective featurette entitled, ""Only a Few Degrees from a Sweathog"" hosted by Marcia Strassman. There are new interviews with all of the Sweathogs minus Travolta (big surprise, there), Strassman and Kaplan (time has not been kind to him...ouch!). The Sweathogs actors talk about the quick success of the show, how they were cast and some of their experiences on it. However, this featurette lacks the depth and the dirt dished on the two-hour E! True Hollywood Story that aired several years ago. Hopefully, this will be included on a future release.The third disc includes the original screen tests for all the Sweathogs and Strassman. It's pretty obvious why these actors were cast as they all nail their respective characters by inhabiting them so well.

No one could have imagined the break out star John Travolta would become, trading in his tight t-shirt for a white leisure suit, as Gabe Kaplan fights to hold his own against an unruly class of ""Sweathogs,"" who fall below the curve of Buchanan High School.  This was the first high school comedy to capture a gritty urban feel.  Room 222 had its moments but was sticky sweet by comparison. Gabe Kaplan drew on his life experiences, which had been the fodder of his stand-up routines, to capture a lively classroom of remedial kids led by Vinnie Barbarino.  They manage to stay one step ahead of Vice Principal Woodman (John Sylvester White), but Kotter knows the tricks all too well, having been a sweathog himself in his youth.  Robert Hegyes, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs (who enjoyed a brief celebrity of his own) and Ron Palillo round out the motley crew, representative of the racial diversity of the school. Marcia Strassman is wonderful as Kotter's wife, Julie, who has to listen to his daily accounts each evening, reminiscent of the bed conversations between Bob and Emily Newhart. The show had a good run of 4 seasons, which is appropriate given that it was a high school comedy.

Gabe Kaplan had built his act around his growing up in Brooklyn and included bits about ranking which were put-downs.  Some of them from the show such as ""up your nose with a rubber hose"" became popular catchphrases.  The show focused on Kotter (Mr. Kaplan) returning as a teacher to his old high school, James Buchanan High.  His old nemesis from his school days, Mr. Woodman (John Sylvester White), is now his boss and assigns him to the worst class in the school, the Sweathogs, of which Kotter was a founding member.  The four main Sweathogs were Vinnie Barbarino (John Travolta), Juan Epstein (Robert Hegyes), Freddie ""Boom Boom"" Washington (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) and Arnold Horshack (Ron Palillo). They challenged Kotter's authority, but in the end listened to his teaching.  The show portrays the Sweathogs as juvenile delinquents and alludes to them stealing things, fighting, etc., but you never really see any of this and it makes them basically non-threatening.  That aside, the characters are extremely likable and Mr. Kaplan is extremely funny.  He does Groucho Marx and other impressions and, what became a trademark of the show, opened and closed each episode telling his wife Julie (Marcia Strassman) a lame (though very funny) joke about a Kotter family member.  The show was an instant hit and spawned tons of Kotter memorabilia including games, lunch boxes, dolls, books, etc. The theme song, ""Welcome Back"" by former Lovin' Spoonful singer John Sebastian became a number song in the spring of 1976.  As a bonus feature on the dvd shows that the show was originally called Kotter and added Welcome Back to the title because of the song. The feature also notes that Barbarino was originally called Eddie Barbarini and that Mr. Hegyes thought he had that role and didn't find out he was Epstein until a meeting in an elevator with the show's producers.  The dvd also features the screen tests for all of the Sweathogs and Julie. The most notable guest star of the first season was James Woods who appears as a stuffy teacher (wearing an ascot) in the show's first episode (the pilot was actually shown as episode three).

You watch the shows and instantly know they were produced in the 1970's--there is no second guessing their era of production. Yet, because the `current issues' and/or terms of debate have largely since changed, those same shows now appear dated when trying to be viewed todayHowever. our nation's current emphasis on standardized testing and high scores as a measure of all achievement  ironically ensures that Mr. Kotter and the antics of his sweathogs are readily welcomed back onto your TV screen today! Nothing has changed.Having been in special education myself and now seeing my friends return as special education teachers, I know that this series still speaks to our own experiences--even though we graduated high school in the 1990's and they are now teaching in the 21st century.  When this show originally ran, special education had just been authorized in the United States and the idea that students with disabilities were entitled to a free public education honestly was far more `radical' than it is today.He's not wearing an armband or button, but Mr. Kotter is every bit the `countercultural hero' just for wanting to give his students the very same quality of education which his teachers and the school principal (ironically now his employer) had once denied to him--and for still being `outside the system' he gets picked on by the establishment' in a couple of episodes.( ""Mr. Kotter. Teacher"", ""Mr. Kotter Makes Good""). Recognizing he is their advocate, the sweathogs stick up for Mr. Kotter.22 episodes make up this 1975-1976 season.  ""Father Vinnie"" is a good episode because Vinnie Barbarino (John Travolta) attempts to honor the dying request of his grandmother and become the quintessential Italian priest. However, our teenage ladies man discovers that being true to himself means that he will not then be able to successfully fulfill this obligation.  It's still funny seeing John Travolta looking so young in this show! Travolta was then being marketed as a `teen heartthrob' but he's had the last laugh on everybody with a very long and successful  acting career, replete with substantial acting roles.I also like ""The Telethon"" because it raises the specter (especially in those early years) of how special education classes recieved their funding (if at all). Requiring a school to have remedial classes is nice, but then how will the eligible students receive the education to which they are entitled to let alone what quality of education can those students recieve without an appropriate amount of money being allocated to run the programs? A program without sufficient money essentially does not exist.Like ""Dr. Epstein, I Presume"" a misguided high school guidance counselor had only seen my own future in terms of my disability rather than my specific capabilities and career interests. ""Arrividerci, Arnold"" echoed the sense of loss everybody sincerely felt upon somebody's promotion out of the remedial program because being an `outcast'  inadvertently had forced us to become a very close-knit family! Watching both episodes honestly was like revisiting my own high school experiences during the 1990's.Obviously this show remains good entertainment. I'm seriously convinced that it also should be an essential component of current teacher education curriculums across the country, particularly for those who are considering entering the field of special education.Yes, there obviously were some changes, but so many issues discussed in this series continue to cross-over.  Watching a couple of episodes could provide today's teacher education students with an opportunity to launch into a discussion about how society's definitions of `smart' and `success' consequently impact the classroom environment and student capabilities.",5,Welcome back to a revolutionary show,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,3929,"['So', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'produced', '1970', 'attempted', 'address', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'emergent', 'social', 'trends', 'did', 'overall', 'good', 'job', 'heady', 'charge', 'watch', 'shows', 'instantly', 'know', 'were', 'produced', '1970', 'second', 'guessing', 'era', 'production', 'current', 'issues', 'and/or', 'terms', 'debate', 'have', 'largely', 'changed', 'same', 'shows', 'now', 'appear', 'dated', 'when', 'trying', 'be', 'viewed', 'todayHowever', 'nation', 'current', 'emphasis', 'standardized', 'testing', 'high', 'scores', 'measure', 'achievement', 'ironically', 'Mr.', 'Kotter', 'antics', 'sweathogs', 'are', 'readily', 'welcomed', 'back', 'TV', 'screen', 'today', 'Nothing', 'changed.Having', 'been', 'special', 'education', 'now', 'seeing', 'friends', 'return', 'special', 'education', 'teachers', 'know', 'series', 'still', 'own', 'experiences', 'even', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', '1990', 'are', 'now', 'teaching', '21st', 'century', 'When', 'show', 'originally', 'ran', 'special', 'education', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'authorized', 'United', 'States', 'idea', 'students', 'disabilities', 'were', 'entitled', 'free', 'public', 'education', 'honestly', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'radical', 'not', 'wearing', 'armband', 'button', 'Mr.', 'Kotter', 'bit', 'countercultural', 'hero', 'just', 'wanting', 'give', 'students', 'very', 'same', 'quality', 'education', 'teachers', 'school', 'principal', 'ironically', 'now', 'employer', 'had', 'once', 'denied', 'still', 'being', 'system', 'picked', 'establishment', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Mr.', 'Kotter', 'Teacher', 'Mr.', 'Kotter', 'Makes', 'Good', 'Recognizing', 'advocate', 'sweathogs', 'stick', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Kotter.22', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', '1975-1976', 'season', 'Father', 'Vinnie', 'good', 'episode', 'Vinnie', 'Barbarino', 'John', 'Travolta', 'honor', 'dying', 'request', 'grandmother', 'become', 'quintessential', 'Italian', 'priest', 'However', 'teenage', 'man', 'discovers', 'being', 'true', 'will', 'not', 'then', 'be', 'able', 'successfully', 'fulfill', 'obligation', 'still', 'funny', 'seeing', 'John', 'Travolta', 'looking', 'so', 'young', 'show', 'Travolta', 'was', 'then', 'being', 'marketed', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'had', 'last', 'laugh', 'everybody', 'very', 'long', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'replete', 'substantial', 'acting', 'roles.I', 'also', 'Telethon', 'specter', 'especially', 'early', 'years', 'how', 'special', 'education', 'classes', 'recieved', 'funding', 'Requiring', 'school', 'have', 'remedial', 'classes', 'nice', 'then', 'how', 'will', 'eligible', 'students', 'receive', 'education', 'are', 'entitled', 'let', 'alone', 'what', 'quality', 'education', 'can', 'students', 'recieve', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'money', 'being', 'allocated', 'run', 'programs', 'program', 'sufficient', 'money', 'essentially', 'not', 'exist.Like', 'Dr.', 'Epstein', 'Presume', 'misguided', 'high', 'school', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'own', 'future', 'terms', 'disability', 'rather', 'specific', 'capabilities', 'career', 'interests', 'Arrividerci', 'Arnold', 'echoed', 'sense', 'loss', 'everybody', 'sincerely', 'felt', 'somebody', 'promotion', 'remedial', 'program', 'being', 'outcast', 'inadvertently', 'had', 'forced', 'become', 'very', 'close-knit', 'family', 'Watching', 'episodes', 'honestly', 'was', 'revisiting', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'experiences', ""1990's.Obviously"", 'show', 'good', 'entertainment', ""'m"", 'seriously', 'convinced', 'also', 'should', 'be', 'essential', 'component', 'current', 'teacher', 'education', 'curriculums', 'country', 'particularly', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'entering', 'field', 'special', 'education.Yes', 'obviously', 'were', 'changes', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'discussed', 'series', 'continue', 'cross-over', 'Watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'could', 'provide', 'today', 'teacher', 'education', 'students', 'opportunity', 'launch', 'discussion', 'how', 'society', 'definitions', 'smart', 'success', 'consequently', 'impact', 'classroom', 'environment', 'student', 'capabilities']",N/A

It's pretty cheesy and sometimes it hasn't aged well but it's still fun to watch and to think that this was the stuff back in the day, and when I mean the day I mean the 70's. Ron Palillo, who plays Horseshack, is hilarious who you might recognize from Friday the 13th part 6. His lines are usually very hysterical. And who can forget Mr. Kotter played by Gabe Kaplan.
