Very funny, clean, and well-produced.  However, if you already have ""Standing Up"", you will find out that a lot of the same routines/bits are found on this one as well.  (I guess, technically, that would be a hit on ""Standing Up"" since that one came later, but I saw them in reverse order.)  So, if you already have ""Standing Up"" and think it is only okay, you may want to skip this one.  However, if you consider Brian Regan to be one of the best comedians ever (like I do) and are willing to have some repeats to get the other gems (like I did), get this DVD!",4,"Excellent, but note...",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,708,"['already', 'had', 'Standing', 'Up', 'Epitome', 'Hyperbole', 'got', 'earlier', 'one', 'Walked', 'Moon', 'definitely', 'par', 'Very', 'funny', 'clean', 'well-produced', 'However', 'already', 'have', 'Standing', 'Up', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'lot', 'same', 'routines/bits', 'are', 'found', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'technically', 'would', 'be', 'hit', 'Standing', 'Up', 'one', 'came', 'later', 'saw', 'reverse', 'order', 'So', 'already', 'have', 'Standing', 'Up', 'think', 'only', 'okay', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'one', 'However', 'consider', 'Brian', 'Regan', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'comedians', 'ever', 'do', 'are', 'willing', 'have', 'repeats', 'get', 'other', 'gems', 'did', 'get', 'DVD']",I Walked On The Moon
