202998,A3L753EAJUYWHR,6300183432,"D. Leon ""A reader""","[5, 5]","The main value this movie has for me is the nostalgia. It sort of got lost in the shuffle, seeing as Prince came out with a similar rock-star-struggling-to-find-himself think a few months later, and he did it much better (remember a littel film called Purple Rain?). I remember staying up all night long calling into the local radio station to win tickets to the premier showing in our town. It was a fun event, and Rick and his music generally are just a huge part of my teen years. Yes, the script is very weak (Diane:""You know, I really, really, really, really...care about you."" to drive the point home that she couldn't bring herself to say ""I love you."" C'mon, two reallys would have done it)and the director should have had his guild card revoked and had cut up pieces of celuloid shoved up his fingernails. I mean, yes Rick has a very cute tushy and I got a kick out of seeing it as much as the next person, but around the third time, I was like ""c'mon, he's more than a cute butt!""BUT... that having been said, this character was a nice departure from Dr. Noah Drake, his General Hospital alter ego. He CAN act, but this film just didn't give him much to work with unfortunately. If you want to see Rick flex his thesbian muscles, check out Silent Motive. He co-stars as a not-so-recovered cocaine addict, and is so convincing it's scary. But on the plus side for Hard To Hold, Rick looks really good throughout this movie, and the sound track is one of my favorite Rick Springfield records. I know it's not his favorite (he says it was written and recorded under the influence of a big case of Page 37 syndrome. You know, ""this is what happens on page 37 of the script. Write a song to fit it"") but it's still some really great work. The concert scenes are fun, too.

203015,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6300183432,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","By the early eighties Rick Springfield was the #1 rock star in North America. His albums went platinum, he won a Grammy for his self-penned ""Jessie's Girl"", he had a series of Top 10 singles, his concerts were sell-outs, and he made daytime television audiences swoom with his performance as Dr. Noah Drake on ""General Hospital"". So after he quit the daytime soap it was only natural for him to embark on a career on the big screen. The result was ""Hard To Hold"".It's very rare for a soap performer to become a movie star immediately. Usually, they have to act on primetime TV for awhile,  make a demand for themselves, then start with small roles in features. However, due to Rick Springfield's enormous musical success by 1984 it was believed he would make a name for himself on the big screen. This was not to be.I remember seeing ""Hard To Hold"" in theatres. Rick, of course, was gorgeous to look at, with that black hair and puppy dog face. Plus I knew he could act from his two years on daytime. However, even as a teenager I knew ""Hard To Hold"" was going to be a flop. The script was simply awful. Rick plays a rock star (not a big stretch for him) who embarks on a relationship with a so-called attractive woman who is a child psychiatrist. The fact that there was no chemistry between Rick and the woman who played his love interest made watching the film that more unbearable.After picking up Rick Springfield's new autobiography ""Late, Late at Night"" I thought it would be fun to watch ""Hard To Hold"" again. My feeling about the film, 26 years later, is the same. The movie falls flat, it is uninvolved, uninteresting, and simply a bad film. Buy the movie if your a fan of Rick Springfield's, like I am, as ""Hard To Hold"" is the only feature he has ever appeared in.What's great about the movie is the soundtrack. Very eighties, I was surprised how well the songs have held up all these years later. The title song from the movie ""Love Somebody"", a top 5 single for Rick, still makes me excited as it has a great chorus and wonderful beat.For all you women and gay guys out there there are two cute scenes with Rick showing off his butt. One with him running from some crazed fans where a woman pulls his towel off after he comes out of his dressing room . The other shows Rick in all his glory, faced down on a bed, naked as the camera pans over his impressive body. These scenes are worth the film!",5,"""Great Memories From The Eighties""",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,2410,"['early', 'eighties', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'was', '1', 'rock', 'star', 'North', 'America', 'albums', 'went', 'platinum', 'won', 'Grammy', 'self-penned', 'Jessie', 'Girl', 'had', 'series', 'Top', '10', 'singles', 'concerts', 'were', 'sell-outs', 'made', 'daytime', 'television', 'audiences', 'swoom', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Noah', 'Drake', 'General', 'Hospital', 'So', 'quit', 'daytime', 'soap', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'embark', 'career', 'big', 'screen', 'result', 'was', 'Hard', 'Hold', '.It', 'very', 'rare', 'soap', 'performer', 'become', 'movie', 'star', 'immediately', 'Usually', 'have', 'act', 'primetime', 'TV', 'awhile', 'make', 'demand', 'then', 'start', 'small', 'roles', 'features', 'However', 'due', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'enormous', 'musical', 'success', '1984', 'was', 'believed', 'would', 'make', 'name', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'not', 'be.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Hard', 'Hold', 'theatres', 'Rick', 'course', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'black', 'hair', 'puppy', 'dog', 'face', 'knew', 'could', 'act', 'two', 'years', 'daytime', 'However', 'even', 'teenager', 'knew', 'Hard', 'Hold', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'flop', 'script', 'was', 'simply', 'awful', 'Rick', 'rock', 'star', 'not', 'big', 'stretch', 'who', 'relationship', 'so-called', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'child', 'psychiatrist', 'fact', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Rick', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'love', 'interest', 'made', 'watching', 'film', 'more', 'unbearable.After', 'picking', 'up', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'new', 'autobiography', 'Late', 'Late', 'Night', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'Hard', 'Hold', 'again', 'feeling', 'film', '26', 'years', 'later', 'same', 'movie', 'flat', 'uninvolved', 'uninteresting', 'simply', 'bad', 'film', 'Buy', 'movie', 'fan', 'Rick', 'Springfield', 'am', 'Hard', 'Hold', 'only', 'feature', 'ever', 'appeared', 'in.What', 'great', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'Very', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'songs', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'title', 'song', 'movie', 'Love', 'Somebody', 'top', '5', 'single', 'Rick', 'still', 'excited', 'great', 'chorus', 'wonderful', 'beat.For', 'women', 'gay', 'guys', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'two', 'cute', 'scenes', 'Rick', 'showing', 'off', 'butt', 'One', 'running', 'crazed', 'fans', 'where', 'woman', 'towel', 'off', 'dressing', 'room', 'other', 'shows', 'Rick', 'glory', 'faced', 'down', 'bed', 'naked', 'camera', 'impressive', 'body', 'scenes', 'are', 'film']",Hard to Hold VHS
