1394015,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B004AW3DUI,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[3, 3]","This DVD is not like any other DVD we have watched before.  Actually since the show is an Australian show, it reminds me of the Wiggles, but about Fairies!  The DVD is not an animated DVD but rather actual people playing characters, including a few kids which are adorable!  There are two female fairies, an Elf baker, and a Bumble Bee guy as the main characters.  The show features Fairyland and what goes on and how the characters work together, play with their friends, and there is lots and lots of singing.When I first showed my boys it, my 4 year old son said ""No"" and so I put it on my laptop for my 2 year old son to watch.  Soon both boys were glued to the laptop screen and begging to finish it!  Their favorite character was the Elf baker, not sure why.  Normally they don't like a lot of singing and with the DVD being kind of girly, I didn't think they'd like it, but they did!  Since it has guy characters in it, I don't think it is just for girls, although girls would probably love it more because of the whole Fairy thing.  It is a very cute show and with it being a hit in Australia I think it will definitely be a hit here!",4,Not just for girls!,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",2011,1142,"['DVD', 'not', 'other', 'DVD', 'have', 'watched', 'Actually', 'show', 'Australian', 'show', 'Wiggles', 'Fairies', 'DVD', 'not', 'animated', 'DVD', 'rather', 'actual', 'people', 'playing', 'characters', 'including', 'few', 'kids', 'are', 'adorable', 'are', 'two', 'female', 'fairies', 'Elf', 'baker', 'Bumble', 'Bee', 'guy', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'Fairyland', 'what', 'how', 'characters', 'work', 'together', 'play', 'friends', 'lots', 'lots', 'singing.When', 'first', 'showed', 'boys', '4', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'said', 'No', 'so', 'put', 'laptop', '2', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'watch', 'Soon', 'boys', 'were', 'glued', 'laptop', 'screen', 'begging', 'finish', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'Elf', 'baker', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'singing', 'DVD', 'being', 'kind', 'girly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'like', 'did', 'guy', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'girls', 'girls', 'would', 'probably', 'love', 'more', 'whole', 'Fairy', 'thing', 'very', 'cute', 'show', 'being', 'hit', 'Australia', 'think', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'hit', 'here']",Fairies: Meet the Fairies

I finally broke down and bought it after renting it a handful of times.  My daughters are 4 and 5 and they love the signing, dancing, and costumes.  They even pick out which fairy they are and pretend that they are them.

I like the movie as much as she does and we both get up to dance and sing together! She memorized three songs already. I dance the Bee dance in public and she laughs and joins me. Good for ages 2 on up. We have watched it almost every day for six months and I am still excited to watch it with her.
