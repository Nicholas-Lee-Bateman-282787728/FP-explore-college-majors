1339133,A2A4DYIDTIL17X,B003EYVLHK,Battle Ready,"[0, 1]","I would get the video called &#34;Jesus Christ and the Shroud of Turin&#34; and WATCH IT FIRST to set the grounds for this video.This first video explains why the &#34;experts&#34; were wrong when they claimed that this was a fake in the recent past and not the burial cloth of Christ.  Then watch &#34;The Real Face of Jesus&#34;.  You will be astounded!  This is a true and well made program.  I was very impressed.  Even though this is the TRUE burial cloth of Jesus Christ, we are to worship Him and not the cloth that He was buried in.Another couple of videos you need to watch are: &#34;In Search of the Real Mt. Sinai&#34; and &#34;The Exodus Revealed&#34;.  These both show the REAL Mt. Sinai and its NOT the one in the Egyptian peninsula.  Nothing there matches with the Bible's description of what happened, where it happened, and what should be found at the REAL site.  Have you ever wondered why the maps in the back of your Bible have question marks on them for the locations of the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt?NOW  you can see the REAL Mt. Sinai that matches perfectly with the Bible.  It is life changing!Also look up Ron Wyatt on the Internet as he was the one who &#34;found&#34; the REAL Mt. Sinai and made a map by which the peoplein the video &#34;In Search of the Real Mt. Sinai&#34; used to find it again and show the video footage of the breathtaking REAL Mt.

I have seen many documentaries on the Shroud and I find most of them fascinating, mainly because the Shroud of Turin is so amazing, but this one was very well done. Perhaps what was really interesting in this one was the fact that it really gets across how special the image on the Shroud is. It has three dimensional information preserved on it! I believe the show also gets across the fact that no artist, priest, or scientist of the Middle Ages could have created an image with all the properties that this cloth has been discovered to have.

Tevington,"[6, 7]","Authors such asPeter Kreeft and Father Ronald Tacelli, as well asJosh McDowell, have wonderfully and clearly stated a few powerful points....Reasonable people do not deny that Jesus Christ was an historical figure - a great moralist and moral leader. Dan Brown and recycled gnostic myths aside (i.e., ""The Da Vinci Code""), Jesus Christ made the incredible claim to be God!  To claim to be God - if you are not God - should immediately qualify you as the world's worst charlatan or be evidence that you are delusional.  Yet, Jesus indeed made this claim and offered evidence, the most astounding of which concerned predictions - and fulfillment - of His own resurrection from the dead.After the Roman authorities had killed Jesus, the last thing they wanted was for His followers to immortalize Him.  So, they fortified His tomb and stationed a guard. Somehow, the tomb was empty on that first Easter morning.  To posit that a few formerly sheepish pals - most of whom had been MIA on Friday afternoon - could have snatched and forever hidden His body from history doesn't make any sense.In response to the foregoing, some question the historicity of the Gospels and suggest that Jesus' claims of Divinity were inventions of the early Church.  But there was absolutely nothing to be gained from such a hoax - early followers lost everything by this ""lie""; many lost their lives!  Another attempt to counter the foregoing is the suggestion that Jesus may have talked of being God in a New Age manner.  Maybe, He meant that He was God - just like we are also God!  This is simply ahistorical; it is not in keeping with Jesus' montheistic cultural background.  He did NOT go around saying that everyone was God!InThe Real Face of Jesus, far more amazing than the work of graphic artists to depict ""the real face of Jesus"" is the history which the video shares about the Shroud of Turin.  Whilethe Church has not said so definitively, there are compelling reasons to think that the shroud is the burial clothes described inJohn: 20.This video is riveting, except for those very few points at which it tries to give some credit to gnosticism.

It's possible that someone in the Middle Ages could have somehow faked the 3D image on the cloth, but not very plausible.  And if so, how so?  And if so, how do we account for the real fact that the Shroud can be dated by alternative, (perhaps) more accurate means to well before the 13th century?

They show how the modern interest got started with Doctors Pea's photograph in the late 19th century, all the way up to space aged scientific research being down now; They cover all the theories and come to the stratling conclusion; One the Shroud is not a fake, Two they don't know how it was made; The best Theory is that it was caused by some low level radiation coming from the body in the shroud.

But, there was no note that I saw that said it worked on some players and not on others.  So, it plays beautifully on my Blue Ray player, but will not play on the other DVD players I have.  Just keep that in mind before you purchase.But, as for the presentation, the program is amazing and I give it 5 stars!  I always looked at the Shroud of Turin as just a religious icon.  But after seeing all the scientific research that has been conducted and the puzzling mysteries involved, I was amazed.  The research and amount of work that went into it is very impressive.  Very interesting theories presented.  I think everyone should see it.

Recent scientific studies claim that ultraviolet lasers are the only way to produce similar markings.  Still that research suggests that the resurrection was somewhat like the Biblical story of creation with light preceding matter.  Imagine standing in the tomb during this process.  WOW!
