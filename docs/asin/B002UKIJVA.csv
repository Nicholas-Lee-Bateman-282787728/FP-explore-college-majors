1289971,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B002UKIJVA,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[4, 4]","Transatlantic Tunnel is a cheesy movie starring the ultimate King of Cheese Richard Dix. Unless you are plastered to your tv at odd hours at night you may not have a clue as to who Richard Dix is. Dix was an actor who got his start in movies during the silent era and undoubtedly because he had stage training he transitioned successfully to talking films. Tall, chisel jawed, and commanding, Dix did fairly well career-wise into the mid '30's. He assumed a lot of heroic lead parts that always had a sameness about them. Late night tv taught me that there we're certain expectations a viewer had with a Dix movie. Dix was always self-sacrificing, daring, and brave. Sometimes he got the girl, but more often than not work got in the way.Transatlantic Tunnel is a Dix movie with a twist. It has a somewhat futuristic plot that strains the parameters of the possible even in the 21st century. Dix builds a transportation tunnel. We aren't talking the Chunnel here, running a train underneath the English Channel. We are talking about a tunnel connecting the US to England straight under the Atlantic Ocean. Forget that the Atlantic has deep shelves and canyons or the distance between the two continents. If the Roeblings could build the Brooklyn Bridge, Dix can build a transatlantic tunnel, despite setbacks such as financial backing as well as public support, marital woes, the alienation of his wife and son, and workers dropping like flies from a mysterious gas. The plot sounds weird, Dix is as over the top as ever, but this is actually a very entertaining movie. Of course, the real/reel star here is this film's vision of the future and the technology used to create it. While the acting is just o.k., it's the sci fi aspect that won me over on this one.The second feature in this set, Non Stop New York, is a stock thriller. A woman reporter travels from London to New York to clear a man accused of murder. The real culprit is mob connected and the mob is out to stop her from clearing the innocent man. The action here takes place on a transatlantic flight from London on an oppulent flying boat populated with the reporter and mobsters out to silence her permanently. A good cast including a young and lovely Anna Lee and handsome John Loder and the amazing vision of future travel turns this B programmer into an interesting flight of fancy.These are both interesting movies that predate the sci-fi craze of the 1950's and are fun to watch.",4,A Look Back At The Future,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,2453,"['Transatlantic', 'Tunnel', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'starring', 'ultimate', 'King', 'Cheese', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'are', 'plastered', 'tv', 'odd', 'hours', 'night', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'Dix', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'got', 'start', 'movies', 'silent', 'era', 'undoubtedly', 'had', 'stage', 'training', 'transitioned', 'successfully', 'talking', 'films', 'Tall', 'chisel', 'jawed', 'commanding', 'Dix', 'did', 'fairly', 'well', 'career-wise', 'mid', 'assumed', 'lot', 'heroic', 'lead', 'parts', 'always', 'had', 'sameness', 'Late', 'night', 'tv', 'taught', ""'re"", 'certain', 'expectations', 'viewer', 'had', 'Dix', 'movie', 'Dix', 'was', 'always', 'self-sacrificing', 'daring', 'brave', 'Sometimes', 'got', 'girl', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'work', 'got', 'way.Transatlantic', 'Tunnel', 'Dix', 'movie', 'twist', 'somewhat', 'futuristic', 'plot', 'parameters', 'possible', 'even', '21st', 'century', 'Dix', 'transportation', 'tunnel', 'are', ""n't"", 'talking', 'Chunnel', 'here', 'running', 'train', 'English', 'Channel', 'are', 'talking', 'tunnel', 'connecting', 'US', 'England', 'straight', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'Forget', 'Atlantic', 'deep', 'shelves', 'canyons', 'distance', 'two', 'continents', 'Roeblings', 'could', 'build', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'Dix', 'can', 'build', 'transatlantic', 'tunnel', 'setbacks', 'such', 'financial', 'backing', 'as', 'well', 'public', 'support', 'marital', 'woes', 'alienation', 'wife', 'son', 'workers', 'dropping', 'flies', 'mysterious', 'gas', 'plot', 'weird', 'Dix', 'top', 'ever', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'course', 'real/reel', 'star', 'here', 'film', 'vision', 'future', 'technology', 'used', 'create', 'acting', 'just', 'o.k.', 'sci', 'fi', 'aspect', 'won', 'over', 'one.The', 'second', 'feature', 'set', 'Non', 'Stop', 'New', 'York', 'stock', 'thriller', 'woman', 'reporter', 'travels', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'clear', 'man', 'accused', 'murder', 'real', 'culprit', 'mob', 'connected', 'mob', 'out', 'stop', 'clearing', 'innocent', 'man', 'action', 'here', 'place', 'transatlantic', 'flight', 'London', 'oppulent', 'flying', 'boat', 'populated', 'reporter', 'mobsters', 'out', 'silence', 'permanently', 'good', 'cast', 'including', 'young', 'lovely', 'Anna', 'Lee', 'handsome', 'John', 'Loder', 'amazing', 'vision', 'future', 'travel', 'B', 'programmer', 'interesting', 'flight', 'fancy.These', 'are', 'interesting', 'movies', 'predate', 'sci-fi', 'craze', '1950', 'are', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A
1289972,A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,B002UKIJVA,"Jordan ""brainofj72""","[0, 1]","This is about as obscure as it gets, which is a tragedy. I went in expecting an exciting sci-fi adventure, and was very surprised to find a tense, realistic drama with characters you begin to genuinely care about. The plot concerns the construction of an enormous undersea tunnel that connects the US and England. The sci-fi element is secondary, almost an atmospheric necessity for the hypothetical story, but the technological predictions that are there are strikingly accurate. The story isn't as concerned with the actual construction of the tunnel as it is with the toll it takes on its creator and lead engineer, and his family, as he devotes years of his life to the project. The film has a somewhat distanced, procedural tone, which is extremely unusual, especially for its time. But as I said, the characters and relationships slowly creep up on you and create some unexpected emotional heft by the end.",4,Review of Transatlantic Tunnel,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,912,"['about', 'as', 'obscure', 'tragedy', 'went', 'expecting', 'exciting', 'sci-fi', 'adventure', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'find', 'tense', 'realistic', 'drama', 'characters', 'begin', 'genuinely', 'care', 'plot', 'construction', 'enormous', 'undersea', 'tunnel', 'US', 'England', 'sci-fi', 'element', 'secondary', 'almost', 'atmospheric', 'necessity', 'hypothetical', 'story', 'technological', 'predictions', 'are', 'are', 'strikingly', 'accurate', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'concerned', 'actual', 'construction', 'tunnel', 'toll', 'creator', 'lead', 'engineer', 'family', 'years', 'life', 'project', 'film', 'somewhat', 'distanced', 'procedural', 'tone', 'extremely', 'unusual', 'especially', 'time', 'said', 'characters', 'relationships', 'slowly', 'creep', 'up', 'create', 'unexpected', 'emotional', 'heft', 'end']",N/A

1289975,A1FBMC893ERT8N,B002UKIJVA,Tony Harris,"[5, 7]","Transatlantic Tunnel is a science fiction film in that it depicts the creation of a technical marvel that has happened, a tunnel from New York to England. It's handle in a way that's rather logical and not outlandish. The concerns of the builder, played by Richard Dix include funding, worker safety, and his marriage. Sacrifices and danger are met head on to triumph in this difficult task, it's quite moving. Also the underground train device looks pretty realistic for its time. Non-Stop New York is also surprisingly entertaining. A woman flys to NW from England to prevent the lomming execution of an innocent man, but it so happens the murdered is aboard. The element of science fiction in this film is the plane itself, which is based more on a cruise ship. The plane departs from a dock, there are cabins, and even an outside deck! Weird, but the film is pretty suspenseful.",5,Interesting Views of the Future,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,882,"['Transatlantic', 'Tunnel', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'creation', 'technical', 'marvel', 'happened', 'tunnel', 'New', 'York', 'England', 'handle', 'way', 'rather', 'logical', 'not', 'outlandish', 'concerns', 'builder', 'played', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'include', 'funding', 'worker', 'safety', 'marriage', 'Sacrifices', 'danger', 'are', 'met', 'head', 'triumph', 'difficult', 'task', 'quite', 'moving', 'Also', 'underground', 'train', 'device', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'time', 'Non-Stop', 'New', 'York', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'woman', 'flys', 'NW', 'England', 'prevent', 'lomming', 'execution', 'innocent', 'man', 'so', 'murdered', 'aboard', 'element', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'plane', 'based', 'more', 'cruise', 'ship', 'plane', 'departs', 'dock', 'are', 'cabins', 'even', 'outside', 'deck', 'Weird', 'film', 'pretty', 'suspenseful']",N/A
