He has grown up into a young man by the time he made ""Dog Pound.""  It is another Canadian film although it depicts life inside a juvenile detention centre somewhere in Montana USA.  Aside from Adam Butcher, I did not know any of the other actors, but they all played their parts convincingly.  The plot is very good as four juvenile offers are processed and then introduced into the prison population.  There are bullies, there is drug smuggling, and a realistic sense that the prison system is in complete control from the time they enter it and during their stay there.  The only problem with this film that I could see was that its ending is anticlimactic.  It is unpredictable as it should be, but somehow the viewer expects more to follow.  I would recommend this film to anyone into prison films and couple it with the film ""On The Inside.""

1366547,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003UYUQWU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","Through the years, there have been countless prison based dramas and that genre has expanded to include tales set in various detention centers. It is an environment that is harrowing, to be sure, but not always as shocking or as disturbing as it should be. I think that I fully understand that incarceration (unless you're wealthy and entitled) does not necessarily lead to a rich and rewarding experience. In a way, as I'm ashamed to admit, I'm desensitized to the violent and psychological extremes one can meet behind bars. Writer/director Kim Chapiron, therefore, takes us to rather expected territory in the bleak drama ""Dog Pound."" Although Canadian in origin, this tale is set in a Montana juvenile detention center where three new inmates must navigate the treacherous political system that will be their home. I have heard complaints that ""Dog Pound"" is essentially an uncredited remake of the cult British film ""Scum."" And there's certainly no denying the similar themes and plot points. I wouldn't dwell on the comparison, however, ""Scum"" was over thirty years ago. If anything, Chapiron's film shows us that the issues presented are universal and long standing.As the film starts, we meet the motley trio of newbies before their stint in Enola Vale Youth Correctional Center begins. Davis (Shane Kippel) is a short-timer on a narcotics possession charge, Angel (Mateo Morales) is in for assault and car jacking), and Butch (Adam Butcher) is being transferred over for assault on a correctional officer. Initially, the three have very little in common except that they share the initiation rituals together. Each seems content to keep his head down and do his time without confrontation. But there being a designated power structure, this strategy is not really allowed. The reigning crew want to showcase their dominance and their targets are the surly Butch (who they want to knock down physically) and the likable Davis (who they break down emotionally). Refreshingly, the guards here are never portrayed in a particularly bad light. They are working with limited resources to do the right thing. When the boys reach a breaking point, there is an effort to flip the script so to speak. But as things start to look up, can redemption and the promise of a fresh start really lie ahead?In truth, ""Dog Pound"" doesn't add a lot to the discussion that you haven't seen before. But that doesn't particularly matter. ""Dog Pound"" is a well structured, well made, and well acted endeavor that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do! The film is unpleasant, occasionally hopeful, sporadically violent, and even fitfully amusing at times. As the boys start to get to know one another, moments of real brightness shine through and you see the potential of what might have been (maybe what still might be). As the movie reaches its inevitable conclusion, it is particularly unsettling and memorable. While Chapiron's screenplay gives the film a solid structure, much of the movie's success lies on its young actors. Kippel presents an incredibly appealing and even funny character, in many ways he is the burn-out slacker you might recognize from real life. But it is Adam Butcher (grown up from his leading role in Saint Ralph) who is absolutely mesmerizing. Volatile, unpredictable, you can see the rage simmer beneath his eyes even as he tries to keep it in check. But when he thaws and even smiles, you'll see the boy struggling inside as well. In the end, I really liked ""Dog Pound."" It may not be a complete original, but it is wholly effective.

Disappointingly weak on special features. A directors commentary would have been very welcome.Yet there are some terrific things about it. If there is a theme it is the challenge of anger management in men, especially young men.Three teen age boys are incarcerated in a reformatory. They are not good kids or terrible kids. They face the usual prison/reformatory issues of peck order and male jostling. But in this film it is refreshingly not an overdone cliche. In fact the film gets across an atmosphere of boredom and routine without being boring and routine. Congratulations. It is almost poetic in the sense that you have to read into the characters and the atmosphere even though the film has the feeling of being ""rambling"" and sometimes ""slow"" as poems often are.  If you are open to doing this then there is certainly an underlying very disturbing tension. Our three stray dogs face disgusting bullies that are psychological sadists and also capable of violent intimidation. How does one deal with one's anger in this atmosphere? This is a special challenge for teen age boys of course. You see this in their faces and actions and not in the dialogue.This was most of the film for me -- watching emotions build up and finding release in various ways, and reaching breaking points. They did a great job if you like films that ""tell truth"" about humans in this style. The film focuses on the anger of the Butch character and actually his motives are not bad. He mostly gets angry at injustices. With a different life trajectory he could end up a socially constructive hero in my opinion. But the film does not glamorize him or make him do heroic things and you would have to form this opinion on your own.There is sort of a plot. Pretty generic and thus not much of one. If Butch can keep his cool he can get out soon. Can he keep his cool in the face of sadistic kids? That does add a little structure and suspense.Hardly the most distinctive thing about the film, or reason to praise it.The guards are not as one might expect from the genre sadistic bullies. They are just guys doing their jobs. But they also have their breaking points and this really helps weave together the theme of anger management especially in men.The tension is broken at times by some very nice scenes where the boys take time off so to speak from the serious psychological battle and slip into boys just horsing around with good natured bravado and jabs. If you think about it, this is pretty common for boys and the nasty stuff in the reformatory is sort of an amplification of this play hostility.The film offers no solutions so far as reformatories and anger, and some will rank it down for that.  In this sense it is like the Oz TV series, which also offers no solutions to our prison problems. But I would say that this film is not really about our correctional systems. It is more a fine portrait about the anger that can so easily be stirred up within us.",5,mixed bag,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,3068,"['Not', 'film', 'everyone', 'plot', 'speak', 'Little', 'character', 'development', 'would', 'say', 'instead', 'character', 'EXPOSITION', 'Disappointingly', 'weak', 'special', 'features', 'directors', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'welcome.Yet', 'are', 'terrific', 'things', 'theme', 'challenge', 'anger', 'management', 'men', 'especially', 'young', 'men.Three', 'teen', 'age', 'boys', 'are', 'incarcerated', 'reformatory', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'kids', 'terrible', 'kids', 'face', 'usual', 'prison/reformatory', 'issues', 'peck', 'order', 'male', 'jostling', 'film', 'refreshingly', 'not', 'overdone', 'cliche', 'fact', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'boredom', 'routine', 'being', 'boring', 'routine', 'Congratulations', 'almost', 'poetic', 'sense', 'have', 'read', 'characters', 'atmosphere', 'even', 'film', 'feeling', 'being', 'rambling', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'poems', 'often', 'are', 'are', 'open', 'doing', 'then', 'certainly', 'underlying', 'very', 'disturbing', 'tension', 'three', 'stray', 'dogs', 'face', 'disgusting', 'bullies', 'are', 'psychological', 'sadists', 'also', 'capable', 'violent', 'intimidation', 'How', 'one', 'deal', 'one', 'anger', 'atmosphere', 'special', 'challenge', 'teen', 'age', 'boys', 'course', 'see', 'actions', 'not', 'dialogue.This', 'was', 'most', 'film', 'watching', 'emotions', 'build', 'up', 'finding', 'release', 'various', 'ways', 'reaching', 'breaking', 'points', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'like', 'films', 'tell', 'truth', 'humans', 'style', 'film', 'anger', 'Butch', 'character', 'actually', 'motives', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'mostly', 'angry', 'injustices', 'different', 'life', 'trajectory', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'socially', 'constructive', 'hero', 'opinion', 'film', 'not', 'glamorize', 'make', 'do', 'heroic', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'form', 'opinion', 'sort', 'plot', 'Pretty', 'generic', 'thus', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'Butch', 'can', 'keep', 'cool', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'soon', 'Can', 'keep', 'cool', 'face', 'sadistic', 'kids', 'add', 'little', 'structure', 'suspense.Hardly', 'most', 'distinctive', 'thing', 'film', 'reason', 'praise', 'it.The', 'guards', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'genre', 'sadistic', 'bullies', 'are', 'just', 'guys', 'doing', 'jobs', 'also', 'have', 'breaking', 'points', 'really', 'weave', 'together', 'theme', 'anger', 'management', 'especially', 'men.The', 'tension', 'broken', 'times', 'very', 'nice', 'scenes', 'where', 'boys', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'so', 'speak', 'serious', 'psychological', 'battle', 'slip', 'boys', 'just', 'horsing', 'around', 'good', 'natured', 'bravado', 'jabs', 'think', 'pretty', 'common', 'boys', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'reformatory', 'sort', 'amplification', 'play', 'hostility.The', 'film', 'solutions', 'so', 'far', 'reformatories', 'anger', 'will', 'rank', 'down', 'sense', 'Oz', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'solutions', 'prison', 'problems', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'correctional', 'systems', 'more', 'fine', 'portrait', 'anger', 'can', 'so', 'easily', 'be', 'stirred', 'up']",N/A

The three new kids soon attract a lot of unwanted attention and things sort of spiral from there.This is a re-telling of Ray Whinstone's first major film `Scum'. He was a relative unknown then and all of the actors here are too. They all do an admirable job especially Adan Butcher who plays `Butch'. Director and co-write Kim Champiron has done a great job of making the players believable and that goes for the guards too. This is a regime that in many ways is as hard on the guards as it is on the guarded.Enola Vale is described as `A place to grow and learn', most of what these kids will learn will not be in societies interests. So is it any good? Well I actually really liked (not enjoyed) it for what it was portraying and the way it was done. If you have seen Scum, then some of the plot will be all too familiar. However, that said this works too and has enough of its own identity to stand on its own merit. If you have not seen Scum, then you have missed a Brit classic. All in all a very good effort in what is a controversial and difficult area.",4,Taut Prison Drama,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,1627,"['American', 'film', 'Canadian', 'help', 'highly', 'influenced', 'British', 'Borstal', 'film', 'Scum', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'tale', 'three', 'young', 'offenders', 'who', 'get', 'sent', 'Juvenile', 'Correctional', 'Facility', 'called', 'Enola', 'Vale', 'are', 'initiated', 'strict', 'regimented', 'world', 'youth', 'detention', 'three', 'tier', 'system', 'privilege.The', 'lowest', 'are', 'forced', 'wear', 'orange', 'jump', 'suits', 'middle', 'ordinary', 'prison', 'garb', 'top', 'are', 'Trustees', 'get', 'wear', 'black', 'polo', 'shirts', 'are', 'also', 'head', 'honchos', 'lead', 'bullies', 'three', 'new', 'kids', 'soon', 'attract', 'lot', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'things', 'sort', 'spiral', 'there.This', 're-telling', 'Ray', 'Whinstone', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'Scum', 'was', 'relative', 'unknown', 'then', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'too', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'especially', 'Adan', 'Butcher', 'who', 'Butch', 'Director', 'co-write', 'Kim', 'Champiron', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'players', 'believable', 'guards', 'too', 'regime', 'many', 'ways', 'as', 'hard', 'guards', 'guarded.Enola', 'Vale', 'described', 'place', 'grow', 'learn', 'most', 'what', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'societies', 'interests', 'So', 'good', 'Well', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'not', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'portraying', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'have', 'seen', 'Scum', 'then', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'familiar', 'However', 'said', 'too', 'enough', 'own', 'identity', 'stand', 'own', 'merit', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Scum', 'then', 'have', 'missed', 'Brit', 'classic', 'very', 'good', 'effort', 'what', 'controversial', 'difficult', 'area']",N/A
