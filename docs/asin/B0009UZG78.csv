Just a few simple words to help describe my feelings after watching these two horrifying specials.  For those who are enormous fans of the original series, I can only heed to you this advice.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  If you fell in love with the quirky characters of Dibley like my wife and I did just a few nights ago, you will be thoroughly disappointed by this return.  Sure, all the same characters are back, the town is back, and the situations are back ... but it just feels like they all have lost it.  It is either the fact that they have lost their characters within 10 years, or just the fact that they were not sure what they were doing with their return.  Who knows?  All I know is that these were not the same characters that I once knew and laughed at consistently.Dawn French is back, but she seems to have lost her spark.  Her character of Geraldine Granger seems angrier, less spontaneous, less clever and more vicious.  It is hard for me to tell if she actually wanted to return to do the reunion.  Her words towards the rest of her community did not feel like it had the heart is once did.  Once she was a part of a very funny village, now it feels as if she needed to be the center of the village.  See the difference?  The same can be said for the other members as well.  Alice, aka Emma Chambers, completely forgot her character.  She wasn't even the same.  It isn't hard to play the slow-starter of the area, but make-up, fancy clothing, and everything else just made me feel like I was watching the actor play Alice instead of Alice interacting with Geraldine.  She was a defineite low point to the ""specials"".  Everyone else seemed to be decently playing their notorious characters.  Owen seemed much calmer in these episodes, Frank didn't seem to age a bit, Jim still made me laugh (not in the ""New Years"" Special), and the Hortons seemed like themselves.  It was quite a toned down performance since their riveting beginning during their first three seasons.  Remember how the final episode of the third season just didn't feel like it matched the rest?  Well, that was how this entire ""Specials"" DVD felt.  It didn't match and the characters we fell in love with stopped making us laugh and instead just bumbled their way through their lines.I must also say that I am extremely disappointed with the ""New Years"" special.  Not only was it NOT funny, but I really dislike when we dedicate entire episodes to a cause.  I realize the importance to it, but it just didn't fit in a ""Vicar of Dibley"" episode.  The ending, while meant to be a tearjerker, was horrendous.  It nearly ruined the original three seasons for me.  I just felt as if the actors were doing it for a cause, which didn't fit the mantra of the other seasons.  If the show would have originally been like this, then maybe it would have worked, but for me it was just a cheap ploy to get tears from the audience.  It was sick.Overall, I cannot restate the issue that if you watch these ""specials"" (which I think is an over-evaluation of the truth) before watching the actual series, you will be in for a bit surprise.  I believe that if I would have watched the ""specials"" first, than I would not have bothered to watch the series.  I wouldn't have seen the humor at all.  In two, hour long episodes, I believe that I probably only laughed once.  That was when Geraldine was drunk at church.  Humorous, but nothing in compared to the laugh riot I felt with the original series.  A massive disappointment that should embarrass both the viewer and those involved with the actual production.  Shame on you Vicar, you should not have allowed this to happen!Grade: * out of *****",1,Milk. Milk.

913504,A2K4UF4D6YYP14,B0009UZG78,cheri,"[28, 38]","I was so looking forward to these specials. I really miss the series, was thrilled to find that the 2 specials had been produced and would be released. After seeing them, though, I can't help but think they should have left well enough alone and ended VofD with the final series episode. The characters have lost all charm here and almost everyone seems just to be going through the motions. It's beyond obvious that most of the actors have moved on and really weren't interested in returning to Dibley. The jokes and plot lines are simplistic and common -- almost like the blandest of U.S. sitcoms. That kind of silly. The most disappointing thing was that Geraldine seems to have disappeared altogether. In her place is a vicar lacking in all the depth, charm and humor of her former self. I don't know if it was the writers, French or whomever, but I would rather not have seen Geraldine in this way. One of the things I loved about VofD was that Geraldine was this great, complex, compassionate female character. In the specials, she's reduced to being a totally neurotic, desperate-for-a-husband,depressive, pre-menopausal twit who doesn't care about Dibley or her church any longer. You get the feeling she thinks she's wasted her life away over the last 10 years. She's become vapid and stupid. It betrays the positive thread that ran through the entire series. It's a sad swan song for a great character. I'm surprised Dawn French agreed to even play her this way.The specials brought the reminder that VofD seemed to be losing some steam even in the last series or so of the regular show. The humor got cruder, less witty, less ""smart."" The characters were becoming caricatured and were losing some of their quirky charm even then. I think it was a sign that it was time to end. As much as I'd love for VofD to go on forever, I think that unless it can keep the magic of its first seasons intact, its time is done. More specials like these would just be depressing.",2,Would be nice to have the vicar back-she's nowhere to be seen here...,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1974,"['was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'specials', 'really', 'miss', 'series', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', '2', 'specials', 'had', 'been', 'produced', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'seeing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'ended', 'VofD', 'final', 'series', 'episode', 'characters', 'have', 'lost', 'charm', 'here', 'almost', 'everyone', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'obvious', 'most', 'actors', 'have', 'moved', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'interested', 'returning', 'Dibley', 'jokes', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'simplistic', 'common', 'almost', 'blandest', 'U.S.', 'sitcoms', 'kind', 'silly', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'was', 'Geraldine', 'have', 'disappeared', 'altogether', 'place', 'vicar', 'lacking', 'depth', 'charm', 'humor', 'former', 'self', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'writers', 'French', 'whomever', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'Geraldine', 'way', 'One', 'things', 'loved', 'VofD', 'was', 'Geraldine', 'was', 'great', 'complex', 'compassionate', 'female', 'character', 'specials', 'reduced', 'being', 'totally', 'neurotic', 'desperate-for-a-husband', 'depressive', 'pre-menopausal', 'twit', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'Dibley', 'church', 'longer', 'get', 'feeling', 'wasted', 'life', 'away', 'last', '10', 'years', 'become', 'vapid', 'stupid', 'positive', 'thread', 'ran', 'entire', 'series', 'sad', 'swan', 'song', 'great', 'character', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Dawn', 'French', 'agreed', 'even', 'play', 'way.The', 'specials', 'brought', 'reminder', 'VofD', 'seemed', 'be', 'losing', 'steam', 'even', 'last', 'series', 'so', 'regular', 'show', 'humor', 'got', 'cruder', 'less', 'witty', 'less', 'smart', 'characters', 'were', 'becoming', 'caricatured', 'were', 'losing', 'quirky', 'charm', 'even', 'then', 'think', 'was', 'sign', 'was', 'time', 'end', 'As', 'much', ""'d"", 'love', 'VofD', 'go', 'forever', 'think', 'can', 'keep', 'magic', 'first', 'seasons', 'intact', 'time', 'done', 'More', 'specials', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'depressing']",The Vicar of Dibley - 10th Anniversary Specials

913510,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0009UZG78,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[65, 75]","After a several-year hiatus, the creative team and, remarkably enough, the whole original cast, return to Dibley, the little town that never says die.  Except it's approaching dead.The popularity of this show was originally based on its essentially upbeat, positive attitude and genial self-deprecation at a time when many sitcoms were descending into thirty-minute volleys of insults.  So why is so much of the humor in these two episodes based on David slapping down Alice?  Is it really funny that he fantasizes about his daughter-in-law's death?  Are we amused to see Geraldine drunk in the pulpit, snarking at parishoners in the pews?  Is the show really improved by personality clashes that amount to little more than volleys of darts back and forth between the principals?There are some good concepts underlying the episodes.  For example, in the Christmas episode, the village gets the idea in their heads that Geraldine is homosexual.  Wow, what a great and timely concept!  Just imagine the wacky hilarity as a small English village comes to grips with a lesbian in the pulpit!  Go on, just imagine it!  Are you imagining it?  Good for you, because you've put more effort into the idea than the creative team did.  They throw this sharp, fertile idea out, then sweep it aside almost as soon as it finds play.These episodes aren't a total wash.  The New Year's episode is particularly touching, comprising as it does an appeal to the G8 leaders to stop fiddling while Rome burns and do something about global poverty.  Though perhaps a touch maudlin, this episode provides an appropriate extension of the characters into a real issue that Christians have failed to come to grips with.  This is a very, very good use of the characters and their environment.The special features are also worth watching.  Of the content on the DVD, perhaps the best is a short sketch of the show done for Comic Relief.  Though only fifteen minutes long, it's a good capsule of the characters, their conflicts, and the show's potential for social good and for touching interactions.  This is why we fell in love with the series in the first place.  There's also a gag reel, Dibley Defrocked.  We get to see the actors riff on their lines, improvise short scenes in character, and mug for the camera.  And it's all surprisingly sharp and witty.  Perhaps if the creative team had trusted their actors more, they might have had a pair of episodes worthy of the lingering memory of the original series.This DVD is for fans of the original series only.  Newbies will find it slow, disjointed, and wearing; it depends too heavily on our memory of the characters and their quirks more than on actually developing new insights.  Those already invested in the show will find these episodes fairly trying, but there's enough to like, and it has its high points.
