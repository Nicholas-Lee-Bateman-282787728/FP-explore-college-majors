Billy Rohan (Sebastian Rice-Edwards) lives in London during the 1940 German blitz of Britain, with his family. His parents Clive (David Hayman) and Grace (Sarah Miles), his feisty older sister Dawn (Geraldine Muir) and his adorable little sister Sue (Geraldine Muir)For the family and their friends the war is both a frightening and an exhilarating time, as Clive leaves for war, the family begins to fall apart with Billy and sue running wild, and Dawn running off with a Canadian soldier Cpl. Bruce Carrey (Jean-Marc Barr) who makes her pregnant. The family's will to survive brings them together. Billy joins a local boy's gang which excavates all the shrapnel and fallen bullets and scarps of bomb they can find. Quite innocent seeing how the gang makes Billy recite all the swearwords he knows and when he says he only knows the F word, they tell him that is a very special word only to be used on important occasions. Little Sue follows Billy around and steals the show.More funny scenes when Clive back from the front brings home some German jam from the shipwreck of a German sea vessel, and the family are not sure what to think of it and the children catching Dawn with her soldier boyfriend. Other scenes are touching , the most heart-warming when Billy is comforted by his mother and pretty friend Pauline Gladroy (who recently lost her mom in a German raid) and his motherSaid to be a realistic enactment of Britain during the blitzThe second part of the film is set in an almost idyllic summer on the Thames-side estate of Grace's parents. Where everything slowly comes together for the best.The humour is never too slapstick, the heartfelt scenes never too lingeringly tearjerking, and always with the balance for a beautiful family film.John Boorman (Excalibur) wrote and directed this masterpiece and in my opinion is better filmaker than the overrated and glitzy Steven Spielberg.you really feel like you in England during the Second World War.",5,Magnificent family film,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,2161,"['Watched', 'when', 'was', 'kid', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'stayed', 'recently', 'put', 'together', 'memories', 'googled', 'then', 'retrieved', 'name', 'buying', 'DVDThis', 'such', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Billy', 'Rohan', 'Sebastian', 'Rice-Edwards', 'London', '1940', 'German', 'blitz', 'Britain', 'family', 'parents', 'Clive', 'David', 'Hayman', 'Grace', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'feisty', 'older', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'Geraldine', 'Muir', 'adorable', 'little', 'sister', 'Sue', 'Geraldine', 'Muir', 'family', 'friends', 'war', 'frightening', 'exhilarating', 'time', 'Clive', 'leaves', 'war', 'family', 'fall', 'apart', 'Billy', 'sue', 'running', 'wild', 'Dawn', 'running', 'off', 'Canadian', 'soldier', 'Cpl', 'Bruce', 'Carrey', 'Jean-Marc', 'Barr', 'who', 'pregnant', 'family', 'will', 'survive', 'brings', 'together', 'Billy', 'local', 'boy', 'gang', 'shrapnel', 'fallen', 'bullets', 'scarps', 'bomb', 'can', 'find', 'Quite', 'innocent', 'seeing', 'how', 'gang', 'Billy', 'recite', 'swearwords', 'when', 'only', 'F', 'word', 'tell', 'very', 'special', 'word', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'important', 'occasions', 'Little', 'Sue', 'Billy', 'show.More', 'funny', 'scenes', 'when', 'Clive', 'back', 'front', 'home', 'German', 'jam', 'shipwreck', 'German', 'sea', 'vessel', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'children', 'catching', 'Dawn', 'soldier', 'boyfriend', 'Other', 'scenes', 'are', 'touching', 'most', 'heart-warming', 'when', 'Billy', 'comforted', 'mother', 'pretty', 'friend', 'Pauline', 'Gladroy', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'mom', 'German', 'raid', 'motherSaid', 'be', 'realistic', 'enactment', 'Britain', 'blitzThe', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'set', 'almost', 'idyllic', 'summer', 'Thames-side', 'estate', 'Grace', 'parents', 'Where', 'everything', 'slowly', 'together', 'best.The', 'humour', 'never', 'too', 'slapstick', 'heartfelt', 'scenes', 'never', 'too', 'lingeringly', 'tearjerking', 'always', 'balance', 'beautiful', 'family', 'film.John', 'Boorman', 'Excalibur', 'wrote', 'directed', 'masterpiece', 'opinion', 'better', 'filmaker', 'overrated', 'glitzy', 'Steven', 'Spielberg.you', 'really', 'feel', 'England', 'Second', 'World', 'War']",N/A

This is not what you will find in this flick. What you get is a film from a very modern and adult point of view. The Children and the adults in this film are so corrupt and superficial as to make the kids and the ""Jet Set"" Adults of the 60's and 70's look naieve and innocent. There is nothing about the people in this film that would illicit any kind of sympathectic response and if the British had really been like this I think they could never have waged a successful war against anybody.

It recalls the topsy turvey ways of a world where the abnormal conditions of war become commonplace.  The men are away at the front and abscenses are not always making the heart grow fonder; the kids lack supervison; and one may be the victim of the next German bombing run. In this world of fear, uncertainty, and confusion, Billy still has the problems of growing up--attaining acceptance of his peers, becomming more independent, learning to throw a proper ""googlie"" cricket bowl...and of course the problem of girls.  He learns that life in not permanent, that his own mother is not immune from heartache, that life, afterall, can hold wonderful surprises even in the midst of war.

Later he and his friends play on the rubble of blown-up buildings--it's all great fun. There are many great scenes that ring true considering a child's viewpoint: when his own house is blown up the boy worries that his shrappnel collection will melt! They eventually go to live with relatives in the country, and it's an idyllic existence. There is one terrific scene: after summer holiday the boy is forced to return to school in the city. Suddenly German planes appear overhead and bombs rain down on the school.

Such juxtapositioning, however, rarely does justice to the trials of life experienced by civilians as battles take place far afield.  That's why Hope & Glory is such a unique piece of moviemaking.  In it we are taken along bombed streets; to charitable shops for clothing; into air raid shelters; to the cinema to escape the war; to neighbors homes to embrace a sense of community.  Hope & Glory is a ""wartime"" film wherein we see almost none of war's fare; as we are made to feel a part of it as viewers, knowing---from history---what is happening further afield without having to see any of it ourselves.  Life is indomitable & goes on as surely during difficult times as carefree ones.  It is the ""Hope"" in Hope & Glory and this film's accomplishment is its effectiveness in conveying such.  If you want to feel something of the time that was wartime as Hitlerite Germany ran amok in Europe then do view this fine film.  Along with ""The Gathering Storm"" starring Albert Finney & ""Life is Beautiful"", ""Hope & Glory"" is one of several films that brings the era of the Second World War to life; and makes the great combat films (such as ""The Longest day"", ""Patton"", et al) resonate even more with repeated viewings.  If interested in other suggestions, see my ""Viscerally experience WWII"" Amazon guide (just click on my name & then side left, to ""So you'd like to...""). Incidentially, for those considering viewing this film as a family, I'd suggest you choose ""Mrs. Miniver"" for that instead, & save this film (with has some sexual issues) for the adults.

578845,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005AUJS,Deborah Earle,"[13, 13]","Director John Boorman's semi-autobiographical elegy to the Blitz is a poignant, comical, and occasionally hard-core look at the realities of war through the eyes of a young boy. Given the roles of his wife and son in the piece, it's also a rather lovingly crafted family project.We first meet young Bill Rowan (a rosy-mouthed, freckle-faced imp named Sebastian Rice-Edwards), the son of a closely-knit middle class English family, as he plays in the backyard of his London home on the day war is declared between Germany and Great Britain.His little sister, Sue (Geraldine Muir, who could definitely pass for the daughter of David Hayman, who plays Bill's father, Clive) pedals about the backyard singing a pop ditty of the day, and his older sister, Dawn (a vivacious and overly-flirtatious Sammi Davis)angrily storms about trying to find her mislaid stockings as the children's careworn parents (including an emotional Sarah Miles as Grace Rowan)listen to a radio report of how their world is about to change.Oftentimes, with the accompaniment of their friends, Mac and Molly (Derrick O'Connor and Susan Woolridge), we follow the Rowans through the emotional dilemma of whether or not to send Bill and Sue overseas to escape the air raids in those uncertain times, Bill's difficulties with intimidating authority figures(Susan Brown, Gerald James) in school,  the disruption of a school day by an air raid, and a German pilot (Charlie Boorman) landing in a victory garden.Air raids soon hit close to home and, and while Mr. Rowan is away in the Army, his wife and children endure a night of terror as Luftwaffe bombs shatter their windows; the following day, they deal with shattered lives.In the meantime they find ways to lift their spirits amid strains of Cole Porter, Frederic Chopin, and later, Mozart.We observe the complexities of the relationships between the adults in Bill's life, the crude realities of gangs among the rubble, and an obscene game involving a neighbor(Sarah Langton), recently left motherless by an air raid.Soon enough,the reality of how parents lose control of their children in wartime settles in as well, when Dawn begins dating Canadian Corporal Bruce Carrey (Jean-Marc Barr). Reportedly, upon viewing this film, Boorman's sister collapsed and took to her bed for a few days, having seen many antics she thought she'd gotten away with as a teenager portrayed onscreen.Another major crisis causes the Rowans to seek refuge in the riverside home of Bill's maternal grandparents(the comically exasperated Ian Bannen, and stalwart Annie Leon). Bill's three aunts,  Faith, Hope and Charity(Jill Baker, Amelda Brown, and Kathrine Boorman) provide support during this time.But even as air strikes destroy lives and property, in an ironic twist, they provide the Rowans with an answer to the problem of food shortages, and Bill, in particular, with one of the most joyous moments of his life.Watch for a scene where Bill observes a film being made in the middle of the road; it is a portrait of a young lad glimpsing his future career.While certain scenes may make a viewer squeamish, overall, ""Hope and Glory"" is a poem to hope and family solidarity in the hardest of times.",5,An Anthem to Endurance,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,3201,"['Director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'semi-autobiographical', 'elegy', 'Blitz', 'poignant', 'comical', 'occasionally', 'hard-core', 'look', 'realities', 'war', 'eyes', 'young', 'boy', 'Given', 'roles', 'wife', 'son', 'piece', 'also', 'rather', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'family', 'project.We', 'first', 'meet', 'young', 'Bill', 'Rowan', 'rosy-mouthed', 'freckle-faced', 'imp', 'named', 'Sebastian', 'Rice-Edwards', 'son', 'closely-knit', 'middle', 'class', 'English', 'family', 'backyard', 'London', 'home', 'day', 'war', 'declared', 'Germany', 'Great', 'Britain.His', 'little', 'sister', 'Sue', 'Geraldine', 'Muir', 'who', 'could', 'definitely', 'pass', 'daughter', 'David', 'Hayman', 'who', 'Bill', 'father', 'Clive', 'pedals', 'backyard', 'singing', 'pop', 'ditty', 'day', 'older', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'vivacious', 'overly-flirtatious', 'Sammi', 'Davis', 'angrily', 'trying', 'find', 'mislaid', 'stockings', 'children', 'careworn', 'parents', 'including', 'emotional', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'Grace', 'Rowan', 'listen', 'radio', 'report', 'how', 'world', 'change.Oftentimes', 'accompaniment', 'friends', 'Mac', 'Molly', 'Derrick', ""O'Connor"", 'Susan', 'Woolridge', 'follow', 'Rowans', 'emotional', 'dilemma', 'not', 'send', 'Bill', 'Sue', 'overseas', 'escape', 'air', 'raids', 'uncertain', 'times', 'Bill', 'difficulties', 'intimidating', 'authority', 'figures', 'Susan', 'Brown', 'Gerald', 'James', 'school', 'disruption', 'school', 'day', 'air', 'raid', 'German', 'pilot', 'Charlie', 'Boorman', 'landing', 'victory', 'garden.Air', 'raids', 'soon', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'Mr.', 'Rowan', 'away', 'Army', 'wife', 'children', 'endure', 'night', 'terror', 'Luftwaffe', 'bombs', 'shatter', 'windows', 'following', 'day', 'deal', 'shattered', 'lives.In', 'meantime', 'find', 'ways', 'lift', 'spirits', 'strains', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Frederic', 'Chopin', 'later', 'Mozart.We', 'observe', 'complexities', 'relationships', 'adults', 'Bill', 'life', 'crude', 'realities', 'gangs', 'rubble', 'obscene', 'game', 'involving', 'neighbor', 'Sarah', 'Langton', 'recently', 'left', 'motherless', 'air', 'raid.Soon', 'enough', 'reality', 'how', 'parents', 'lose', 'control', 'children', 'wartime', 'settles', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'Dawn', 'dating', 'Canadian', 'Corporal', 'Bruce', 'Carrey', 'Jean-Marc', 'Barr', 'Reportedly', 'viewing', 'film', 'Boorman', 'sister', 'collapsed', 'took', 'bed', 'few', 'days', 'having', 'seen', 'many', 'antics', 'thought', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'away', 'teenager', 'portrayed', 'onscreen.Another', 'major', 'crisis', 'Rowans', 'seek', 'refuge', 'riverside', 'home', 'Bill', 'maternal', 'grandparents', 'comically', 'exasperated', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'stalwart', 'Annie', 'Leon', 'Bill', 'three', 'aunts', 'Faith', 'Hope', 'Charity', 'Jill', 'Baker', 'Amelda', 'Brown', 'Kathrine', 'Boorman', 'provide', 'support', 'time.But', 'even', 'air', 'strikes', 'destroy', 'lives', 'property', 'ironic', 'twist', 'provide', 'Rowans', 'answer', 'problem', 'food', 'shortages', 'Bill', 'particular', 'one', 'most', 'joyous', 'moments', 'life.Watch', 'scene', 'where', 'Bill', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'middle', 'road', 'portrait', 'young', 'lad', 'glimpsing', 'future', 'career.While', 'certain', 'scenes', 'may', 'make', 'viewer', 'squeamish', 'overall', 'Hope', 'Glory', 'poem', 'hope', 'family', 'solidarity', 'hardest', 'times']",N/A
578846,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005AUJS,Ed Uyeshima,"[14, 15]","Filmmaker John Boorman's unique memory piece based upon his childhood during WWII London provides plenty of pleasures, chief among them a compelling sense of how a young boy views a war that affects every aspect of his family's life. This is refreshingly not a patriotic history lesson about bravery on the home front but a genuinely evocative, often humorous film full of broad characters and small-scale events that seem to capture perfectly how a nine-year old would remember them. The story focuses on the Rowan family from son Billy's perspective. His father Clive has enlisted but been relegated to typing duties, and his mother Grace is alternately brave, volatile and wistful as she ensures the family keeps bonded during his absences. Billy's older sister Dawn has fallen for a wild-eyed Canadian soldier, while his baby sister Sue watches intently. Meanwhile, Billy joins a local band of young hooligans who rifle through the houses destroyed by the German bombs that pummel them during the London Blitz until one strikes the Rowan house, at which point the family goes to stay in the more pastoral setting of his grandparents' house in the country.The 1987 film is full of shrewdly observed vignettes, nostalgic but never sentimental and sometimes with a welcome absurdist sense of humor that surprises and delights. I particularly like the almost surreal scene where the deflating dirigible is flailing downward from the sky to the immense entertainment of the locals. The one periodic drawback to the film is Boorman's episodic story structure, which makes the narrative feel linear and lacking in dimension beyond the immediate events portrayed. This becomes more problematic during the later scenes when the pacing slows somewhat with a long cricket-playing sequence between Billy and his grandfather.

Whatever it&#8217;s forgivable flaws, this is a unique and wonderful film.Showing life in WWII Britain through the eyes of a young boy, it&#8217;s a very odd  look at war, filled more with comedy, family warmth and a sense of adventure, than of tragedy (although tragedy always seems to threaten, from just around the corner).  The acting is superlative throughout, and Boorman&#8217;s camera really seems as though it sees with the senses of his child hero.The first two thirds of the film, as the family lives through the blitz, with bomb raids a part of daily life and houses all around them being blown to pieces is as remarkable, human, funny, sad and surreal as I remember. Only in the last third, when the family leaves London for the safety of the countryside does the film lose some steam, trading the completely original and honest feeling of a child&#8217;s experience of a war, for eccentric relatives in the English countryside &#8211; something that feels far more familiar, if still well done.But, in spite of that slight letdown, this is certainly a film worth seeking out and seeing.  It&#8217;s very strange &#8211; given how popular it was with audiences and critics, and the fact it was nominated for 5 Oscars including best picture -- that it seems to be out of print on DVD in North America (not to mention never having a well deserved blu-ray release).

He still enjoys the things that young boys do, and he plays and shoots and imagines on a level with his grandson.

It's the story of the fictional Rowan family and their friends and neighbors, beginning on the day of the country's entry into World War II - Sunday, September 3, 1939 - and following them for a calendar year of wartime experiences. The movie is full of rich and sometimes raunchy humor but also genuine pathos, and it features a wonderful cast - at the center of which is Sebastian Rice Edwards, only 10 years old at the time, playing Bill, the son of Clive and Grace Rowan (David Hayman and Sarah Miles). He's feisty and quite mature for his age. In fact, sometimes he's more level-headed than anyone else, particularly his precocious older sister Dawn (Sammi Davis) and his dotty grandfather (Ian Bannen, made up to look 73 years old). The movie contains two distinct parts, and they're both hugely appealing. The first unfolds in the family's row house in London, where you grow attached to everyone, and the second takes place in the gorgeous English countryside (in Middlesex and Sussex), which seems more idyllic and appealing than anywhere else on Earth, a place you'll most likely fall in love with. There's a sequence that becomes a humorous take on the Biblical miracle of the fishes that will leave you in stitches, and the fadeout line often brings cheers. My only complaint: It's a movie that cried out for a sequel - or several sequels - because you just don't want to leave this wacky family.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)",4,Who knew growing up in wartime could be such fun?,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1638,"['John', 'Boorman', 'fanciful', 'autobiographical', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'growing', 'up', 'England', 'Blitz', 'treasure', 'pleasing', 'look', 'affectionately', 'told', 'story', 'fictional', 'Rowan', 'family', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'beginning', 'day', 'country', 'entry', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Sunday', 'September', '3', '1939', 'following', 'calendar', 'year', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'movie', 'full', 'rich', 'sometimes', 'raunchy', 'humor', 'also', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'center', 'Sebastian', 'Rice', 'Edwards', 'only', '10', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'playing', 'Bill', 'son', 'Clive', 'Grace', 'Rowan', 'David', 'Hayman', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'feisty', 'quite', 'mature', 'age', 'fact', 'sometimes', 'more', 'level-headed', 'anyone', 'else', 'particularly', 'precocious', 'older', 'sister', 'Dawn', 'Sammi', 'Davis', 'dotty', 'grandfather', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'made', 'up', 'look', '73', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'two', 'distinct', 'parts', ""'re"", 'hugely', 'appealing', 'first', 'unfolds', 'family', 'row', 'house', 'London', 'where', 'grow', 'attached', 'everyone', 'second', 'place', 'gorgeous', 'English', 'countryside', 'Middlesex', 'Sussex', 'more', 'idyllic', 'appealing', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Earth', 'place', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'fall', 'love', 'sequence', 'humorous', 'take', 'Biblical', 'miracle', 'fishes', 'will', 'leave', 'stitches', 'fadeout', 'line', 'often', 'cheers', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'cried', 'out', 'sequel', 'several', 'sequels', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'wacky', 'family.Phil', 'Favorite', '500', 'Loves', 'Moviegoing', 'Lifetime', '2014', 'edition']",N/A
578861,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00005AUJS,"Promise ""promise""","[4, 4]","This is a beautifully told tale, based on true experience of a middle class English family during WWII.  It's told from the point of view of a young boy, who represents the writer/director.  What I found most striking was the way the family carried on after the disastrous bombings of their neighborhood.  Homes are destryoed, neighbors are killed, and these people keep on going, sometimes with amazing good humor.  After the Rowan family's house is damaged, they dust off the piano and have a good time singing and playing.I found it to be almost more touching than the many war films I've seen that have shown only the horrors of war.  In those one can distance oneself from them; in this one identifies with the ordinary family which makes their experiences more real.The cinematography is lush -- especially after the family moves to the country.  One wonders why they didn't go earlier?  The cast is perfect.  At first I was hesitant to watch a war film but this is so much more than that.  There is plenty of humor and warmth.

578863,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005AUJS,Robert Morris,"[53, 56]","This film focuses on an English family which struggles to cope with the Blitz during World War Two. The devastation of attacks on London is brilliantly juxtaposed with the idyllic countryside to which Grace Rohan (Sarah Miles) relocates with her children after her husband Clive (David Hayman) goes off to war. Much of the story is based on director John Boorman's own childhood experiences at a time when there seemed so little reason for hope. ""Glory"" certainly describes the eventual Allied victory but also the courage of the English people meanwhile and certainly the affirmation of shared values which bound so many families together amidst fear, separation, death, and destruction. Much of the film's focus is on Grace's father (Ian Bannen), a patriarch to be sure and (at times) something of an eccentric, but a loving and decent man nonetheless, struggling to cope with all manner of domestic crises while providing a safe haven for daughters Grace, Faith, Hope, and Charity. He and grandson Billy (Sebastian Rice Edwards) forge a special bond in response to the pastoral ""harem"" in which they find themselves. This is a charming film but also one which also offers some sobering insights into how disruptive wartime conditions can be, especially to a sensible and sensitive boy such as Billy. His perspective is presumably Boorman's (re-established years later) and done so with style and grace.",5,Endearing Endurance,1094601600,"09 8, 2004",2004,1405,"['film', 'English', 'family', 'cope', 'Blitz', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'devastation', 'attacks', 'London', 'brilliantly', 'juxtaposed', 'idyllic', 'countryside', 'Grace', 'Rohan', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'children', 'husband', 'Clive', 'David', 'Hayman', 'war', 'Much', 'story', 'based', 'director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'own', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'time', 'when', 'seemed', 'so', 'little', 'reason', 'hope', 'Glory', 'certainly', 'eventual', 'Allied', 'victory', 'also', 'courage', 'English', 'people', 'meanwhile', 'certainly', 'affirmation', 'shared', 'values', 'bound', 'so', 'many', 'families', 'together', 'amidst', 'fear', 'separation', 'death', 'destruction', 'Much', 'film', 'focus', 'Grace', 'father', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'patriarch', 'be', 'sure', 'times', 'something', 'eccentric', 'loving', 'decent', 'man', 'nonetheless', 'struggling', 'cope', 'manner', 'domestic', 'crises', 'providing', 'safe', 'haven', 'daughters', 'Grace', 'Faith', 'Hope', 'Charity', 'grandson', 'Billy', 'Sebastian', 'Rice', 'Edwards', 'forge', 'special', 'bond', 'response', 'pastoral', 'harem', 'find', 'charming', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'also', 'sobering', 'insights', 'how', 'disruptive', 'wartime', 'conditions', 'can', 'be', 'especially', 'sensible', 'sensitive', 'boy', 'such', 'Billy', 'perspective', 'presumably', 'Boorman', 're-established', 'years', 'later', 'done', 'so', 'style', 'grace']",N/A
