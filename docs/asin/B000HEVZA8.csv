1013886,A1N3F1KNLXYQZA,B000HEVZA8,Birder Girl,"[1, 2]","There is really no such thing as ""normal"". I think every human being has a degree of self-image concerns, bouts of depression, fear of coping, etc. It is the degree to which we are susceptible to our human frailties that separates us from living ""normal"" lives and being a human train wreck.  Look at the myriad behaviors in which humans engage to cope with or mask their fears, feelings of worthlessness or loneliness. There's drugs, overeating, lying and cheating, and many, many ways to self-destruct.  Some are just more immediately obvious than others.  In this documentary, I watched 4 ""train wrecks.....young women who are so deeply disturbed, depressed and desperate that they have starved and purged themselves into a health abyss. They are each alternately sympathetic individuals and obnoxious narcissists whining over a bite of cupcake. The film gives us no real clue as to why these women are so depressed, except for the pitiful 15-year-old whose mother has an ED and probably supported her daughter's  massive weight loss of 187 to 98 pounds so she would fit in at school.  We do understand that hormones and body image in a teen are a potential disaster, as in this case where the child declares she wishes she could just be allowed to die...thin.  I was terrifed for this child, perhaps thinking ahead to when my darling granddaughters could be vulnerable to such an obsession.  Ultimately, I watched this wondering if we will ever understand enough about clinical and destructive depression to be able to help the afflicted. Or can we ever change our cultural world view to see that our love for starved, drugged, botox-crazy, surgically enhanced, steroidal stars and role models is killing our kids!It did seem that these women have conditioned themselves to avoid or purge food as a control skill.  Three of them run off their rehab track because they are having so much fun bonding over their illness and breaking rules, despite their backgrounds in suicide and near-death hospitalizations.  One is a mother of 2 adorable kids. It seemed they were in ""treatment"", not to change their obsession with thinness, but find a way to stay thin without dying from it.This documentary is supposedly ""triggering"" to people with ED, i.e. they watch these pitiful gaunt depressives vomiting and want to run out and do it too. Unbelievable.  It just shows how far they or we are from having any clue as to how to bring them back to reality and sanity. I certainly did not see any of the medical staff pictured in the film looking like they had a clue....just rules and a rather fakey ""caring"" manner. Their job was to just get the women back up to 100 pounds or so and say bye-bye....or sooner if insurance has run out.Ironically, I would think a trigger in the facility here, Renfrew, would be the ""preponderance"" of hefty to obese staff.  Truly, it cannot make sense to have these body-obsessed patients counseled about healthy eating by seriously obese nurses, therapists, doctors,etc.",3,"Girls ""Dying"" To Be Thin",1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,2996,"['really', 'such', 'thing', 'normal', 'think', 'human', 'being', 'degree', 'self-image', 'concerns', 'bouts', 'depression', 'fear', 'coping', 'etc', 'degree', 'are', 'susceptible', 'human', 'frailties', 'living', 'normal', 'lives', 'being', 'human', 'train', 'wreck', 'Look', 'myriad', 'behaviors', 'humans', 'engage', 'cope', 'mask', 'fears', 'feelings', 'worthlessness', 'loneliness', 'drugs', 'overeating', 'lying', 'cheating', 'many', 'many', 'ways', 'self-destruct', 'are', 'just', 'more', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'others', 'documentary', 'watched', '4', 'train', 'wrecks', '..young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'depressed', 'desperate', 'have', 'starved', 'purged', 'health', 'abyss', 'are', 'alternately', 'sympathetic', 'individuals', 'obnoxious', 'narcissists', 'whining', 'bite', 'cupcake', 'film', 'real', 'clue', 'why', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'depressed', 'pitiful', '15-year-old', 'mother', 'ED', 'probably', 'supported', 'daughter', 'massive', 'weight', 'loss', '187', '98', 'pounds', 'would', 'fit', 'school', 'do', 'understand', 'hormones', 'body', 'image', 'teen', 'are', 'potential', 'disaster', 'case', 'where', 'child', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'allowed', 'die', 'thin', 'was', 'terrifed', 'child', 'perhaps', 'thinking', 'ahead', 'when', 'darling', 'granddaughters', 'could', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'obsession', 'Ultimately', 'watched', 'wondering', 'will', 'ever', 'understand', 'enough', 'clinical', 'destructive', 'depression', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'afflicted', 'can', 'ever', 'change', 'cultural', 'world', 'view', 'see', 'love', 'starved', 'drugged', 'botox-crazy', 'surgically', 'enhanced', 'steroidal', 'stars', 'role', 'models', 'killing', 'kids', 'did', 'seem', 'women', 'have', 'conditioned', 'avoid', 'purge', 'food', 'control', 'skill', 'Three', 'run', 'off', 'rehab', 'track', 'are', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'bonding', 'over', 'illness', 'breaking', 'rules', 'backgrounds', 'suicide', 'near-death', 'hospitalizations', 'One', 'mother', '2', 'adorable', 'kids', 'seemed', 'were', 'treatment', 'not', 'change', 'obsession', 'thinness', 'find', 'way', 'stay', 'thin', 'dying', 'it.This', 'documentary', 'supposedly', 'triggering', 'people', 'ED', 'i.e', 'watch', 'pitiful', 'gaunt', 'depressives', 'vomiting', 'want', 'run', 'out', 'do', 'too', 'Unbelievable', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'having', 'clue', 'how', 'bring', 'back', 'reality', 'sanity', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'medical', 'staff', 'pictured', 'film', 'looking', 'had', 'clue', '.just', 'rules', 'rather', 'fakey', 'caring', 'manner', 'job', 'was', 'just', 'get', 'women', 'back', '100', 'pounds', 'so', 'say', 'bye-bye', '.or', 'sooner', 'insurance', 'run', 'out.Ironically', 'would', 'think', 'trigger', 'facility', 'here', 'Renfrew', 'would', 'be', 'preponderance', 'hefty', 'obese', 'staff', 'Truly', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'body-obsessed', 'patients', 'counseled', 'about', 'healthy', 'eating', 'seriously', 'obese', 'nurses', 'therapists', 'doctors', 'etc']",Thin

Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[5, 9]","I watched the HBO documentary ""Thin"" because I thought it might lend some helpful insight for me to better understand eating disorders. Instead, I came away frustrated and still asking questions.Directed by Lauren Greenfield, ""Thin"" is a documentary covering the lives of four sufferers of some type of eating disorders:  Shelly, a psychiatric nurse who is 25; (b) Alisa is a divorced (?) mother of two and 30; (c) Polly, who is just a mess, and is 29; and (d) Brittany, who is 15.  It is filmed at Renfrew Center in Florida, a center for eating disorders.All of these women look horrible.  Most have suffered some type of major organ damage because of their eating disorders, yet they still choose to pursue their own death.  Polly, for instance, tried suicide because she (gasp) let herself eat two pieces of pizza.  Shelly was on so many pills she probably should have also gone into detox.  The one that affected me the most was 15-year old Brittany, who literally wanted to die rather than get fat.  The fact that her own mother was her enabler (she, too, suffers from an eating disorder) made me all the madder.  Watch for the part where Brittany tells about her and her mother's ""chew and spit"" cycle of eating, and then cringe when you hear her sob at the end when she tells another patient that she ""misses being up at 2:00 a.m. changing her clothes all the time, and at least if she dies, she'll die thin.""I think that all these women have suffered some type of major trauma in their lives, but that was never touched on.  Shelly and Alisa seem to have some kind of monsters they are running from, but you'll never know what those monsters are.  I do not know if eating disorders are considered a mental illness.  If not, they should be.  However, these eating disorders remind me of ANY addiction:  if these women refuse to admit they have a problem, no one can help them.  There is no wonderful ending to this documentary.

1013890,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,B000HEVZA8,Geneva,"[3, 3]","As a sufferer of an eating disorder for almost four years now, I would like to applaud Lauren Greenfield for making this extremely moving, heartbreaking documentary that shows the true, dark side of eating disorders. There are all sorts of documentaries and informational videos on eating disorders out there, but none of them compare to this one. I've found that a majority of them merely just give facts about eating disorders, and don't go so deep as to show all aspects of what its like to have one. This documentary brought me to tears, just from seeing the previews alone.  And with other documentaries, I've found that many of them might be very triggering to people with this disease, while this one makes you realize why you want to stop with the destructive behaviors and makes you crave a healthy, happy life. Another good thing about this documentary is the fact that it not only shows extremely thin women, but women of average sizes and above. That just goes to show that people who have eating disorders aren't always necessarily emaciated, but are still in just as much danger.The documentary goes inside of Renfrew, a Florida treatment facility, showing a variety of different women, but mainly focuses on four different women, struggling for recovery in hopes of living a normal life.Shelly, polly, brittany, and alisa are the main focuses of this documentary, all with a variety of eating disorders, and all with a variety of different backgrounds that helped to contribute to their eating disorders.This is a very powerful, heartwrenching, in-depth documentary that takes you into the minds of the women and their daily struggles in the clinic as they fight for recovery.This film had me in tears from the moment it started, to the last minute when the end credits started rolling. I could see different aspects of myself in each of the women shown, but the fact that they participated and showed their daily struggles to the world gave me hope for my own recovery. This documentary paints an unpretty, totally true pictures of what its like to be in the devastating cycle of an eating disorder.The ending is probably the most powerful part of the documentary, as it gives you information about what went on with the women after leaving Renfrew, showing that all of them relapsed, and were still struggling with their disease. That is the sad, unfortunate part of the disorder, that it doesn't just go away with the snap of your fingers. I also feel that was the most important part because it shows people just how serious the disease is.I also wanted to extend my sorrow about Polly, who took her own life a few months back. Even though I didn't know her, I felt like I got to know her after having seen this documentary so many times, and she was truly an inspiration to me and a variety of other people in the eating disorder community. At the very least, as unfortunate as this is, I am happy to know that she is finally at peace and will no longer have to struggle. Despite her being gone, she still continues to inspire me each and everyday.Final words- watch this documentary, whether or not you have an eating disorder because I feel more people need to be aware of the extremely misunderstood world of eating disorders. And be sure to also check out the THIN book, which gives you a glimpse into the womens lives after the cameras stopped rolling.",5,brings me to tears everytime I see it,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,3377,"['sufferer', 'eating', 'disorder', 'almost', 'four', 'years', 'now', 'would', 'like', 'applaud', 'Lauren', 'Greenfield', 'making', 'extremely', 'moving', 'heartbreaking', 'documentary', 'true', 'dark', 'side', 'eating', 'disorders', 'are', 'sorts', 'documentaries', 'informational', 'videos', 'eating', 'disorders', 'there', 'none', 'compare', 'one', ""'ve"", 'found', 'majority', 'merely', 'just', 'give', 'facts', 'eating', 'disorders', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'deep', 'show', 'aspects', 'what', 'like', 'have', 'one', 'documentary', 'brought', 'tears', 'just', 'seeing', 'previews', 'alone', 'other', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'found', 'many', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'triggering', 'people', 'disease', 'one', 'realize', 'why', 'want', 'stop', 'destructive', 'behaviors', 'crave', 'healthy', 'happy', 'life', 'good', 'thing', 'documentary', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'thin', 'women', 'women', 'average', 'sizes', 'above', 'just', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'eating', 'disorders', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessarily', 'emaciated', 'are', 'still', 'just', 'much', 'danger.The', 'documentary', 'Renfrew', 'Florida', 'treatment', 'facility', 'showing', 'variety', 'different', 'women', 'mainly', 'four', 'different', 'women', 'struggling', 'recovery', 'hopes', 'living', 'normal', 'life.Shelly', 'polly', 'brittany', 'alisa', 'are', 'main', 'focuses', 'documentary', 'variety', 'eating', 'disorders', 'variety', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'helped', 'contribute', 'eating', 'disorders.This', 'very', 'powerful', 'heartwrenching', 'in-depth', 'documentary', 'minds', 'women', 'daily', 'struggles', 'clinic', 'fight', 'recovery.This', 'film', 'had', 'tears', 'moment', 'started', 'last', 'minute', 'when', 'end', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling', 'could', 'see', 'different', 'aspects', 'women', 'shown', 'fact', 'participated', 'showed', 'daily', 'struggles', 'world', 'gave', 'hope', 'own', 'recovery', 'documentary', 'paints', 'unpretty', 'totally', 'true', 'pictures', 'what', 'like', 'be', 'devastating', 'cycle', 'eating', 'disorder.The', 'ending', 'probably', 'most', 'powerful', 'part', 'documentary', 'information', 'what', 'went', 'women', 'leaving', 'Renfrew', 'showing', 'relapsed', 'were', 'still', 'struggling', 'disease', 'sad', 'unfortunate', 'part', 'disorder', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'away', 'snap', 'fingers', 'also', 'feel', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'people', 'just', 'how', 'serious', 'disease', 'is.I', 'also', 'wanted', 'extend', 'sorrow', 'Polly', 'who', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'felt', 'got', 'know', 'having', 'seen', 'documentary', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'truly', 'inspiration', 'variety', 'other', 'people', 'eating', 'disorder', 'community', 'very', 'least', 'as', 'unfortunate', 'am', 'happy', 'know', 'finally', 'peace', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'struggle', 'being', 'gone', 'still', 'inspire', 'everyday.Final', 'words-', 'watch', 'documentary', 'not', 'have', 'eating', 'disorder', 'feel', 'more', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'aware', 'extremely', 'misunderstood', 'world', 'eating', 'disorders', 'be', 'sure', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'THIN', 'book', 'glimpse', 'womens', 'cameras', 'stopped', 'rolling']",Thin

1013895,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000HEVZA8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[32, 33]","Through the years, I have had several friends with anorexia and/or bulimia--so when I saw this HBO documentary, I thought I'd give it a look.  ""Thin"" tells the story of Florida's Renfrew Center which is a treatment facility for eating disorders.  Following four women specifically, we see some of their emotional highs and lows and the Center's process of recovery in great detail.  I've always associated eating disorders with younger (college or high school age) women, so for me it was fascinating to see the diverse cross section of older and even well-established women facing these issues.The women are candid and it seems as if we have an all access look into their lives.  Particularly interesting to me is how supportive friendships can be formed--but in some cases, those can also be enabling.  One clique, in particular, starts to take on a negative image when they start disregarding the rules.  The sincerity of some of the women wanting to get well is always a question--some work the program hard, some fight it.  And the staff must be caring, yet tough enough to cut through the hypocrisy and deception. ""Thin"" also gives us a glimpse into some of the family dynamics which might have helped to trigger these illnesses. One of the most memorable moments for me is when a mother came to visit.  She sits down to lunch with her daughter who is required to eat, and she disparages and picks apart the food served.  She is absolutely oblivious to the negative implication this might have on her daughter.Near the beginning of the picture, one of the women remarks about her life--""I used to have a personality.""  This is an interesting and powerful idea.  The women in trouble have gotten so caught up in their illnesses, they've forgotten how to live.  And this notion is repeated throughout by many of the patients.  In one of the more moving confessions, one 25 year old patient speculates what her life might have been like had she gotten treatment when she was 15.

1013897,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000HEVZA8,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 6]","Thin is a fascinating, candid documentary that focuses on four relatively young women being treated for eating disorders at The Renfrew Center in Florida; they have life-threatening cases of anorexia and bulimia and other issues, too. The film moves along well and also looks at how staff plan interventions in team meetings as well as how they treat patients either in group or individual settings. Indeed, it was all done in such a sensitive way that I was truly glued to the screen, wanting so badly to see these women fight and overcome their eating disorders--to what degree would they succeed and how, I wondered.There is little new information about these women that I can offer you here; the names and basic facts about Shelly, Polly, Brittany and Alisa are pretty much known between what Amazon states above and what other reviewers have written! The other reviewers deserve praise for their well written and insightful reviews about this documentary.What I can add is my own reaction to the movie. It's not always easy to watch; when I saw Alisa saying that ""if it takes dying to be (thin), at least I'll get there"" I felt so badly for her. It's not an easy path; these women are fighting a serious and chronic mental illness and therefore you just can't rationalize with them by saying ""just eat."" Even Shelly, herself trained as a nurse, just can't seem to get past her distorted body image: when a dietitian tells Shelly that her goal weight is a mere 100 pounds, Shelly looks shocked, overwhelmed and bewildered as to how she could ever achieve that weight--not to mention maintaining it! The group meeting near the end with Brittany and another patient so sad over how her life has gone is unforgettable.In addition, people are people. As someone who has worked on an inpatient hospital ward, I was not surprised to see unhealthy ""cliques"" forming, patients sneaking cigarettes into the bathroom and people hiding food to avoid eating it. The staff at Renfrew seem to try their best and they work hard; but they weren't as careful or as well staffed as they could have been--otherwise bathrooms would be locked most if not all of the time; staff could accompany patients to the bathroom and give the patients at least a quick search before they entered the restroom (leaving them privacy in the bathroom, of course). I also agree with the reviewer who writes that Renfrew doesn't appear to offer treatment in the form of grocery shopping and eating at restaurants.The DVD comes without bonus features but the film is so well done this becomes a minor quibble. Thin doesn't spend much time with men who have eating disorders; that would have been a terrific added feature but despite this Thin is still well done. It's interesting to find out what happened to these four women after they left Renfrew; three of them had to leave abruptly when their insurance ran out but the person who made the most progress surprised me! Some people think that Thin doesn't have a point; but I think that director Lauren Greenfield paints a honest portrait of women with eating disorders which raises awareness of these terrible diseases--and that's quite valuable.Thin is a fine documentary that will appeal to many people who have a loved one or friend with an eating disorder; people with eating disorders themselves may also want to see this documentary. I also recommend Thin for anyone studying eating disorders particularly in women.",5,well done and relevant,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,3439,"['Thin', 'fascinating', 'candid', 'documentary', 'four', 'relatively', 'young', 'women', 'being', 'treated', 'eating', 'disorders', 'Renfrew', 'Center', 'Florida', 'have', 'life-threatening', 'cases', 'anorexia', 'bulimia', 'other', 'issues', 'too', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'also', 'how', 'staff', 'plan', 'interventions', 'team', 'meetings', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'treat', 'patients', 'group', 'individual', 'settings', 'Indeed', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'sensitive', 'way', 'was', 'truly', 'glued', 'screen', 'wanting', 'so', 'badly', 'see', 'women', 'fight', 'overcome', 'eating', 'disorders', 'what', 'degree', 'would', 'succeed', 'how', 'little', 'new', 'information', 'women', 'can', 'offer', 'here', 'names', 'basic', 'facts', 'Shelly', 'Polly', 'Brittany', 'Alisa', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'known', 'what', 'Amazon', 'states', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'other', 'reviewers', 'deserve', 'praise', 'well', 'written', 'insightful', 'reviews', 'documentary.What', 'can', 'add', 'own', 'reaction', 'movie', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'watch', 'when', 'saw', 'Alisa', 'saying', 'dying', 'be', 'thin', 'least', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there', 'felt', 'so', 'badly', 'not', 'easy', 'path', 'women', 'are', 'fighting', 'serious', 'chronic', 'mental', 'illness', 'therefore', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rationalize', 'saying', 'just', 'eat', 'Even', 'Shelly', 'trained', 'nurse', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'distorted', 'body', 'image', 'when', 'dietitian', 'tells', 'Shelly', 'goal', 'weight', 'mere', '100', 'pounds', 'Shelly', 'shocked', 'overwhelmed', 'bewildered', 'how', 'could', 'ever', 'achieve', 'weight', 'not', 'mention', 'maintaining', 'group', 'meeting', 'end', 'Brittany', 'patient', 'so', 'sad', 'how', 'life', 'gone', 'unforgettable.In', 'addition', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'someone', 'who', 'worked', 'inpatient', 'hospital', 'ward', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'unhealthy', 'cliques', 'forming', 'patients', 'sneaking', 'cigarettes', 'bathroom', 'people', 'hiding', 'food', 'avoid', 'eating', 'staff', 'Renfrew', 'seem', 'try', 'best', 'work', 'hard', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'careful', 'as', 'well', 'staffed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'otherwise', 'bathrooms', 'would', 'be', 'locked', 'most', 'not', 'time', 'staff', 'could', 'accompany', 'patients', 'bathroom', 'give', 'patients', 'least', 'quick', 'search', 'entered', 'restroom', 'leaving', 'privacy', 'bathroom', 'course', 'also', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'Renfrew', ""n't"", 'appear', 'offer', 'treatment', 'form', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'eating', 'restaurants.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'minor', 'quibble', 'Thin', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'eating', 'disorders', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'added', 'feature', 'Thin', 'still', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'four', 'women', 'left', 'Renfrew', 'three', 'had', 'leave', 'abruptly', 'when', 'insurance', 'ran', 'out', 'person', 'who', 'made', 'most', 'progress', 'surprised', 'people', 'think', 'Thin', ""n't"", 'have', 'point', 'think', 'director', 'Lauren', 'Greenfield', 'honest', 'portrait', 'women', 'eating', 'disorders', 'awareness', 'terrible', 'diseases', 'quite', 'valuable.Thin', 'fine', 'documentary', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'one', 'friend', 'eating', 'disorder', 'people', 'eating', 'disorders', 'may', 'also', 'want', 'see', 'documentary', 'also', 'recommend', 'Thin', 'anyone', 'studying', 'eating', 'disorders', 'particularly', 'women']",Thin

1013900,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,B000HEVZA8,Pristine,"[1, 1]","I look at Greenfield's THIN as an attempt to solve the problem of telling a story around an emotional topic that is bound to get pelted by criticisms from both sides.Inevitably, the film will suffer from criticisms that are bound to the reality of eating disorders, not to how a documentary was put together.I was originally interested in the topic when I started watching, but the craft of storytelling soon took over.  It's as if the moviemakers are sleuths who are simultaneously trying to solve the mystery of ""why"" alongside the mystery of ""who.""I found the light touch of THIN a necessary approach: it does not try to answer either questions: it allows the camera to roll as tidbits and revelations surface while others stay submerged.  An expert moment arrives when the therapist asks Shelly what lurks in the recesses of her past, possibly making her do what she does.  She says, ""if I'm not telling anyone, why should I tell you?""  And our voyeuristic view gets cut into the next segment, deprived of an answer we may unfairly proceed to apply to other cases later on.The use of the blue rolling luggage cage (as each patient leaves the center) is poetically angled for each departing outpatient as well.  Some leave pushing a big load, while others leave with nothing but bags they carry by hand.I also appreciated the light use of background music as a way to refrain from playing with a viewer's emotions.  I only wished that some of the other members at Renfrew (apart from the main four) were introduced earlier, because by the time situations come to a head, and they speak up, I was left to wonder, ""where were these articulate people earlier on?""If you are looking for a documentary that gives you the answers, you won't find it here, but I've always believe that the best documentaries show you the problem, and leave you to seek out the answers.",5,A Hands-Off Non-Judgmental documentary is a wise way to tell this tale,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,1864,"['look', 'Greenfield', 'THIN', 'attempt', 'solve', 'problem', 'telling', 'story', 'emotional', 'topic', 'bound', 'get', 'pelted', 'criticisms', 'sides.Inevitably', 'film', 'will', 'suffer', 'criticisms', 'are', 'bound', 'reality', 'eating', 'disorders', 'not', 'how', 'documentary', 'was', 'put', 'together.I', 'was', 'originally', 'interested', 'topic', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'craft', 'storytelling', 'soon', 'took', 'over', 'moviemakers', 'are', 'sleuths', 'who', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'why', 'mystery', 'who', 'found', 'light', 'touch', 'THIN', 'necessary', 'approach', 'not', 'try', 'answer', 'questions', 'camera', 'roll', 'tidbits', 'revelations', 'surface', 'others', 'stay', 'submerged', 'expert', 'moment', 'when', 'therapist', 'Shelly', 'what', 'recesses', 'past', 'possibly', 'making', 'do', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', 'anyone', 'why', 'should', 'tell', 'voyeuristic', 'view', 'cut', 'next', 'segment', 'deprived', 'answer', 'may', 'unfairly', 'proceed', 'apply', 'other', 'cases', 'later', 'on.The', 'use', 'blue', 'rolling', 'luggage', 'cage', 'patient', 'center', 'poetically', 'angled', 'departing', 'outpatient', 'as', 'well', 'leave', 'pushing', 'big', 'load', 'others', 'leave', 'nothing', 'bags', 'carry', 'hand.I', 'also', 'appreciated', 'light', 'use', 'background', 'music', 'way', 'refrain', 'playing', 'viewer', 'emotions', 'only', 'wished', 'other', 'members', 'Renfrew', 'apart', 'main', 'four', 'were', 'introduced', 'earlier', 'time', 'situations', 'come', 'head', 'speak', 'up', 'was', 'left', 'wonder', 'where', 'were', 'articulate', 'people', 'earlier', 'are', 'looking', 'documentary', 'answers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', ""'ve"", 'always', 'believe', 'best', 'documentaries', 'show', 'problem', 'leave', 'seek', 'out', 'answers']",Thin

As sad and raw as it was it only touched the surface of a illness with such deep roots in the psyche.  The documentary over covered so much, it did not delve into the inner workings of their mind that created such an obsession with eating to begin with.  The illness could have taken other forms of self-destruction such as drug addiction, alcoholism, but instead this form of self mutilation and self-punishment is done through the deprivation of food.Very sad documentary, very sad that insurance companies actually set the boundaries for who can live and who can die.  It was a good documentary, but it certainly did not offer a avenue for a complete cure for this form of (hate to say it, but its true) mental illness.  I hate to imagine what foundation was laid for women and men (yes, men) to become anorexic in the first place.  Complete destruction of the ego?  Rape, trauma?
