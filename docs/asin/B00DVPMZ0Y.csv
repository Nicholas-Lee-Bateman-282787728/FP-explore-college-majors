1661960,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00DVPMZ0Y,David Baldwin,"[5, 5]","I remember years ago Siskel and Ebert did a special about the portrayal of gays on film up to that time.  ""Staircase"" was given a cursory mention and generally they dismissed the film as being rife with stereotype.  Maltin's movie guide called the film a curio that doesn't stand up for today's more sophisticated viewers.  I hadn't thought about the film until a fellow co-worker and film buff told me it was one of her favorite films.  This took me aback because myself and her are on opposite sides of the political spectrum and I thought she wouldn't take kindly to a film perceived to be insensitive.  Having now seen the film I can say it has stood the test of time and misunderstood at the time of its release in 1969.  Based on a stage play by Charles Dyer the film concerns a couple who are partners in business and bed.  Charlie(Rex Harrison) is flamboyant and Harry(Richard Burton) is melancholic.  They bicker and backbite like any couple in a long term relationship.  Their relationship is at a crossroads with Charlie awaiting a visit from his estranged adult daughter and a court date for public lewdness.  Harry, with his head wrapped in a bandage, frets over his hair loss and cares for his bedridden mother who constantly inquires as to why he never married.  Both Harrison and Burton are outstanding and have definite chemistry.  This is tricky material and handled sensitively by its makers and I think would be appreciated by a modern audience.",5,Ahead Of Its Time,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1465,"['remember', 'years', 'ago', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'did', 'special', 'portrayal', 'gays', 'film', 'up', 'time', 'Staircase', 'was', 'given', 'cursory', 'mention', 'generally', 'dismissed', 'film', 'being', 'rife', 'stereotype', 'Maltin', 'movie', 'guide', 'called', 'film', 'curio', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'today', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'viewers', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'film', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'film', 'buff', 'told', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'took', 'aback', 'myself', 'are', 'opposite', 'sides', 'political', 'spectrum', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'kindly', 'film', 'perceived', 'be', 'insensitive', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'misunderstood', 'time', 'release', '1969', 'Based', 'stage', 'play', 'Charles', 'Dyer', 'film', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'partners', 'business', 'bed', 'Charlie', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'flamboyant', 'Harry', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'melancholic', 'bicker', 'backbite', 'couple', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'crossroads', 'Charlie', 'awaiting', 'visit', 'estranged', 'adult', 'daughter', 'court', 'date', 'public', 'lewdness', 'Harry', 'head', 'wrapped', 'bandage', 'frets', 'hair', 'loss', 'cares', 'bedridden', 'mother', 'who', 'constantly', 'why', 'never', 'married', 'Harrison', 'Burton', 'are', 'outstanding', 'have', 'definite', 'chemistry', 'tricky', 'material', 'handled', 'sensitively', 'makers', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'appreciated', 'modern', 'audience']",Staircase

I would have expected Rex Harrison and Richard Burton to do a much better job with this material. The story becomes almost a laughable &#34;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&#34; gone amuck.

Is it supposed to be sending a message?  If so, what is it?  Wow.  I have always wanted to see this movie and now that I have, I wish I hadn't seen it.  It depressed me to the point where I did not care to watch another movie for a long while after.  It left a bad taste in my mouth.  The performances were ok, for what the actors had to work with.  I really don't recommend this movie at all unless you are Rex Harrison and Richard Burton fans, which I am and that is the reason I bought it.

1661963,A2JEDX851ET4Y8,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Pumpkin Toss ""Dearest""","[1, 2]","This movie is like a gay version of  &#34;Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf&#34; (without the surprise ending). The two men in &#34;Staircase&#34; bicker, snap, and insult one another. However, on some weird level they care for each other...and that about sums up the entire movie! You never see the daughter, or find out what happens in court, but you certainly hear a lot of clever insults!The movie is interesting to watch if you like a lot of verbal drama, and if you are fans of either Rex Harrison, and or Richard Burton. Today's audience members do not fully understand how shocking it was to see these two (in real life very women oriented) actors, playing gay lovers....&#34;for heavens sake, Burton was twice married to Elizabeth Taylor in real life!&#34;The dialogue is interesting to listen to, and the insults, at times, can be gems. However, there are times when the movie can drag on, and or be politically incorrect for todays generation. However, please keep in mind, in those days gays in movies were often depicted (as wrong as it was) as people who couldn't live with being gay, and would often commit suicide by the end of a film. In fact, this movie, &#34;Staircase&#34;, pocks fun at that clich&eacute; type of ending when Harrison believed Burton tried to kill himself...only later to find out it was one of Burton's fanting spells. I especially thought it was funny how Harrison cried out &#34;don't leave me Harry&#34;, only to slap Burton in the face and say, &#34;bad Harry bad,&#34; when Burton began to breath again.Now a days there is too little dialogue in films, and what there is, can often be predicted. This film, &#34;Staircase&#34; is nothing but dialogue, and it's fun to watch. Also, it does not have a sad ending (unlike the &#34;Children's Hour&#34;, or even &#34;Broke Back Mountain&#34;). SPOILER ALERT In fact, in the end, Harrison insults Burton, but when reaching the street corner he cries for Burton (scared of his trial), and the two men walk off together.",5,climb this staircase darlings!,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2002,"['movie', 'gay', 'version', '34', 'Whose', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', '34', 'surprise', 'ending', 'two', 'men', '34', 'Staircase', '34', 'bicker', 'snap', 'insult', 'one', 'However', 'weird', 'level', 'care', 'other', 'about', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'never', 'see', 'daughter', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'court', 'certainly', 'hear', 'lot', 'clever', 'insults', 'movie', 'interesting', 'watch', 'like', 'lot', 'verbal', 'drama', 'are', 'fans', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Today', 'audience', 'members', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'shocking', 'was', 'see', 'two', 'real', 'life', 'very', 'women', 'oriented', 'actors', 'playing', 'gay', 'lovers', '34', 'heavens', 'sake', 'Burton', 'was', 'twice', 'married', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'real', 'life', '34', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'listen', 'insults', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'gems', 'However', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'can', 'drag', 'be', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'todays', 'generation', 'However', 'please', 'keep', 'mind', 'days', 'gays', 'movies', 'were', 'often', 'depicted', 'as', 'wrong', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'being', 'gay', 'would', 'often', 'commit', 'suicide', 'end', 'film', 'fact', 'movie', '34', 'Staircase', '34', 'fun', 'clich', 'eacute', 'type', 'ending', 'when', 'Harrison', 'believed', 'Burton', 'tried', 'kill', 'only', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'Burton', 'fanting', 'spells', 'especially', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'how', 'Harrison', 'cried', 'out', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Harry', '34', 'only', 'slap', 'Burton', 'face', 'say', '34', 'bad', 'Harry', 'bad', '34', 'when', 'Burton', 'began', 'breath', 'again.Now', 'days', 'too', 'little', 'dialogue', 'films', 'what', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'predicted', 'film', '34', 'Staircase', '34', 'nothing', 'dialogue', 'fun', 'watch', 'Also', 'not', 'have', 'sad', 'ending', '34', 'Children', 'Hour', '34', 'even', '34', 'Broke', 'Back', 'Mountain', '34', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'fact', 'end', 'Harrison', 'Burton', 'when', 'reaching', 'street', 'corner', 'Burton', 'scared', 'trial', 'two', 'men', 'walk', 'together']",Staircase
