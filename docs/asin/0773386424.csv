An abused housewife, a stunningly beautiful step-daughter, and a smart friend with a terminal brain tumor combine wits to give Morse and Lewis a run for their money.The backdrop of the story is Oxford, England and Oxford University, in particular.

23789,AV33XOKKT2PH1,0773386424,Pamela Williams,"[9, 11]","This entry in the series focuses on the conspiratorial efforts of three women to exact vengeance upon Ted Brooks, a thoroughly repulsive character who is a murderer, drug dealer, and abusive husband.  The mystery opens with the murder of a popular academic who was particularly adroit at fundraising for the colleges.  In fact, university fundraising is repeatedly satirized in this episode, as one aspect of this drama involves the tendency of college officials to conveniently abandon higher principles (such as an obligation to report suspected criminal activity) if it might discourage potential financial donors.  In any event, the professor's murder acted to cement an alliance among the three women, an alliance undertaken for the purpose of ensuring that Ted Brooks paid for his transgressions.  The organizer of the conspiracy is a terminally ill teacher, who realizing she has very little to lose, resorts to various measures (including seduction of a teenage student) to accomplish the trio's objectives.  Predictably, Ted Brooks is murdered during the course of the episode; however, the viewer is presented with several possible combinations of suspects before the crime is solved.  This episode includes numerous details (student suicide, an allegedly stolen bicycle, and an apparent museum theft) which add interest to this mystery and facilitate plot development.  The teacher who organized the conspiracy was described as ""clever."" Just how clever she was is illustrated by the manner in which this drama ends-- with two of the three conspirators escaping justice.  Despite (or perhaps because of) the unusual ending, this entry in the Morse series is very entertaining and satisfying.",5,justice frustrated,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,1702,"['entry', 'series', 'conspiratorial', 'efforts', 'three', 'women', 'exact', 'vengeance', 'Ted', 'Brooks', 'thoroughly', 'repulsive', 'character', 'who', 'murderer', 'drug', 'dealer', 'abusive', 'husband', 'mystery', 'murder', 'popular', 'academic', 'who', 'was', 'particularly', 'adroit', 'fundraising', 'colleges', 'fact', 'university', 'fundraising', 'repeatedly', 'satirized', 'episode', 'one', 'aspect', 'drama', 'tendency', 'college', 'officials', 'conveniently', 'abandon', 'higher', 'principles', 'such', 'obligation', 'report', 'suspected', 'criminal', 'activity', 'might', 'discourage', 'potential', 'financial', 'donors', 'event', 'professor', 'murder', 'acted', 'cement', 'alliance', 'three', 'women', 'alliance', 'undertaken', 'purpose', 'ensuring', 'Ted', 'Brooks', 'paid', 'transgressions', 'organizer', 'conspiracy', 'terminally', 'ill', 'teacher', 'who', 'realizing', 'very', 'little', 'lose', 'resorts', 'various', 'measures', 'including', 'seduction', 'teenage', 'student', 'accomplish', 'trio', 'objectives', 'Predictably', 'Ted', 'Brooks', 'murdered', 'course', 'episode', 'however', 'viewer', 'presented', 'several', 'possible', 'combinations', 'suspects', 'crime', 'solved', 'episode', 'numerous', 'details', 'student', 'suicide', 'allegedly', 'stolen', 'bicycle', 'apparent', 'museum', 'theft', 'add', 'interest', 'mystery', 'facilitate', 'plot', 'development', 'teacher', 'who', 'organized', 'conspiracy', 'was', 'described', 'clever', 'Just', 'how', 'clever', 'was', 'illustrated', 'manner', 'drama', 'two', 'three', 'conspirators', 'escaping', 'justice', 'perhaps', 'unusual', 'ending', 'entry', 'Morse', 'series', 'very', 'entertaining', 'satisfying']",N/A

Thor,"[0, 1]","The meaning of the titles of the 33 episodes is usually not obvious as to their relationship to the story - with this episode the title is an excellent choice.  Cain was a murderer, and it follows, if he had off spring, they could very well be murderers too; an author's literary privilege.  The three ""daughters"" are Brenda Brooks, her daughter, Kay, and Julia Stevens; all three are heavily involved in the plot.  Morse must sort through many tangents: suicide, drugs, spousal abuse, on call ladies, a terminally ill character and the tangled world of university fund raising versus morals and academics.  Back at headquarters Superintendent Strange has his hands full with a massive budget cut which affects Lewis' pending promotion.  Strange assures Lewis how valuable he is - which is small solace for Lewis.  The tale involves many participants and is quite involved but results in a first class mystery.  This is a five star addition to the series.  At # 30, chronologically, its rating is on a level with most of the later episodes.  Listen for strains of the prelude from the first act of La Traviata which seem to run as thematic material when Julia Stevens is present.",5,Vigilante Justice,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,1179,"['meaning', 'titles', '33', 'episodes', 'usually', 'not', 'obvious', 'relationship', 'story', 'title', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Cain', 'was', 'murderer', 'had', 'off', 'spring', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'murderers', 'too', 'author', 'literary', 'privilege', 'three', 'daughters', 'are', 'Brenda', 'Brooks', 'daughter', 'Kay', 'Julia', 'Stevens', 'three', 'are', 'heavily', 'involved', 'plot', 'Morse', 'must', 'sort', 'many', 'tangents', 'suicide', 'drugs', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'call', 'ladies', 'terminally', 'ill', 'character', 'tangled', 'world', 'university', 'fund', 'raising', 'versus', 'morals', 'academics', 'Back', 'headquarters', 'Superintendent', 'Strange', 'hands', 'full', 'massive', 'budget', 'cut', 'Lewis', 'pending', 'promotion', 'Strange', 'assures', 'Lewis', 'how', 'valuable', 'small', 'solace', 'Lewis', 'tale', 'many', 'participants', 'quite', 'involved', 'results', 'first', 'class', 'mystery', 'five', 'star', 'addition', 'series', '30', 'chronologically', 'rating', 'level', 'most', 'later', 'episodes', 'Listen', 'strains', 'prelude', 'first', 'act', 'La', 'Traviata', 'seem', 'run', 'thematic', 'material', 'when', 'Julia', 'Stevens', 'present']",N/A

Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) find themselves a bit out of their depth when confronted by the murder of an academic. Their investigations gradually reveal several interesting details - the politics of university fundraising, the underground drug scene at the college, and the possible involvement of three women working together in the death of another person.Morse meanwhile, finds himself charmed by one of the female suspects, an attractive and confident younger woman who is clearly involved in some way, but Morse and Lewis find it difficult to prove her involvement. I liked the intricacies of the plot and the surprise element in this case. Unlike most of the cases Morse and Lewis work on, this is one case where some of the perpetrators walk free!
