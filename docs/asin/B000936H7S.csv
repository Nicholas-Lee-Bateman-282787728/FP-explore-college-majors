900804,AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5,B000936H7S,"Abert ""AMY""","[1, 1]","The producer and director did not attempt to give a detailed treatise on the history of the life of Ludwig van Beethoven, nor did they sought to give a historical account of the background for Beethoven's Third Symphony, so scholars should rest if they wanted in-depth material on this topic.  This film simply is not on that.However, this film contains a complete performance (conducted by Sir John E. Gardiner) of the Eroica Symphony, and this piece forms the backbone of the entire film.In slightly over an hour, the audience is allowed short and succint glimpses of the multi-faceted backdrop for the premiere of this Symphony.Even Beethoven's alleged 'Imortally beloved' is depicted here, not as Josephine von Brunswick, but the sister Terese von Brunswick. Nearly all the important persons related to Beethoven at that point of his life 'turned up' in the film, like Joseph Haydn who suddenly appeared before the performance of the last movement.This is a very concise account of the sentiments, the politics, the romantic life, the social relationship, the financial stand, the strive against feudalism...all against the world premiere of the Eroica Symphony, turning to a sour end with the 'news' of the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte, the person to whom the Symphony was allegedly dedicated.The theme of the film is very lucid and well presented.  The 'lost' love of Beethoven stemmed from the feudal system.  The obsession with power and tyranny that impeded real appreciation of the arts and promotion of geniuses.  This is typically a BBC theme that have found so much favour globally.If you are disinterested in the serious topics, the performance of the Eroica itself would surely please.Gardiner employed a more 'historically informed' style in the musical performance.  Never mind the almost non-existent hiccups. Never mind the so many co-incidences.  This is a film, not a documentary, and should be enjoyed as a film.I do not find Ian Hart to be 'Hobbit-like'.  There are enough early portraits of Ludwig van Beethoven.

On the other hand, maybe this is exactly what you need a dose of.  In my book, this is one of the finest movies I have seen. The complete performance of Beethoven's 3rd Symphony is enough to recommend it.  However, the acting, direction, editing, and cinematography are of the highest caliber. There is minimal dialogue, however the actors convey their emotions wordlessly as they react to the music of the master. If you love Beethoven, you should love this movie. But if you can appreciate life and what it is to be human and the continual march of history and change, then this movie should stir you within. Give this one a chance.

900806,A1NPNGWBVD9AK3,B000936H7S,"Bruce Kendall ""BEK""","[2, 5]","Dr Johnson's famous dictum about a theater audience's ""willing suspension of disbelief""  sprang to my mind immediately when watching this TV movie. For me, it required a bit too much willingness. Too many preposterous aspects to overcome.The major flaw was the playing of the ensemble. No orchestra in recorded history could sit down together and perform to the degree of expertise and synchronicity that this ""chamber orchestra"" does. Cold. First time they've seen the score. Sight reading. One hiccup during the entire rehearsal. Without a conductor, save for the Beethoven character standing in front of them and intermittently flailing his arms. Dramatic license is one thing, risible, preposterous impossibility is quite another.The characterization is in general, laughable. Stock characters, all, with nothing nuanced, formulaic in the extreme. The aristocratic snob military Count sneers and snips and gripes his way through the performance, the young, ""with it"" female servant smiles beatifically and knowingly throughout the film, her visage a perfect reflection of the deep, romantic truths epitomized by the master's music. The dialogue sounds as if it were written by a very earnest, but very verbally limited, smart young thing from Shropshire or Dusseldorf or the Herbert Von Karajan school of genius lovers.If you want to know what actually led up to the historical debut of Beethoven's third symphony, get your hands on a good biography. I recommend Emil Ludwig'sBEETHOVEN LIFE OF A CONQUERER. Ludwig had an understanding of the era and of the figures involved that is beyond the ken of the creative team collected here. Ludwig wrote biographies of both Napoleon and Beethoven, so he was a little better equipped to delineate the dynamics of Beethoven's reaction to Napoleon's apostasy than are indicated by the filmmaker's clumsy attempts.Napoleon by Emil LudwigI will say that in terms of the actual music, the recording and the playing is first rate. John Eliot Gardner conducted his orchestra for the actual  performance and they do their usual yeoman's work.Finally, I have problems with Ian Hart being cast as Beethoven. He looks more Hobbit-like than composer-like.If you want to see composers depicted well for television and cinema, look to some of the early treatments from Ken RussellKen Russell at the BBC. His portrayals of composers such as Delius, Debussy and Elgar are models of combining drama with a good dose of historical accuracy (his later excesses regarding TchaikovskyThe Music  Loversand LisztLisztomaniaare different matters entirely.",2,"Great Music, Poor Script",1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2577,"['Dr', 'Johnson', 'famous', 'dictum', 'theater', 'audience', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'sprang', 'mind', 'immediately', 'when', 'watching', 'TV', 'movie', 'required', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'willingness', 'Too', 'many', 'preposterous', 'aspects', 'overcome.The', 'major', 'flaw', 'was', 'playing', 'ensemble', 'orchestra', 'recorded', 'history', 'could', 'sit', 'down', 'together', 'perform', 'degree', 'expertise', 'synchronicity', 'chamber', 'orchestra', 'Cold', 'First', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'score', 'Sight', 'reading', 'One', 'hiccup', 'entire', 'rehearsal', 'conductor', 'save', 'Beethoven', 'character', 'standing', 'front', 'intermittently', 'flailing', 'arms', 'Dramatic', 'license', 'one', 'thing', 'risible', 'preposterous', 'impossibility', 'quite', 'another.The', 'characterization', 'general', 'laughable', 'Stock', 'characters', 'nothing', 'nuanced', 'formulaic', 'extreme', 'aristocratic', 'snob', 'military', 'Count', 'sneers', 'snips', 'gripes', 'way', 'performance', 'young', 'female', 'servant', 'smiles', 'beatifically', 'knowingly', 'film', 'visage', 'perfect', 'reflection', 'deep', 'romantic', 'truths', 'epitomized', 'master', 'music', 'dialogue', 'were', 'written', 'very', 'earnest', 'very', 'verbally', 'limited', 'smart', 'young', 'thing', 'Shropshire', 'Dusseldorf', 'Herbert', 'Von', 'Karajan', 'school', 'genius', 'lovers.If', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'actually', 'led', 'up', 'historical', 'debut', 'Beethoven', 'third', 'symphony', 'get', 'hands', 'good', 'biography', 'recommend', 'Emil', ""Ludwig'sBEETHOVEN"", 'LIFE', 'A', 'CONQUERER', 'Ludwig', 'had', 'understanding', 'era', 'figures', 'involved', 'ken', 'creative', 'team', 'collected', 'here', 'Ludwig', 'wrote', 'biographies', 'Napoleon', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'equipped', 'delineate', 'dynamics', 'Beethoven', 'reaction', 'Napoleon', 'apostasy', 'are', 'indicated', 'filmmaker', 'clumsy', 'attempts.Napoleon', 'Emil', 'LudwigI', 'will', 'say', 'terms', 'actual', 'music', 'recording', 'playing', 'first', 'rate', 'John', 'Eliot', 'Gardner', 'conducted', 'orchestra', 'actual', 'performance', 'do', 'usual', 'yeoman', 'work.Finally', 'have', 'problems', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'being', 'cast', 'Beethoven', 'more', 'Hobbit-like', 'composer-like.If', 'want', 'see', 'composers', 'depicted', 'well', 'television', 'cinema', 'look', 'early', 'treatments', 'Ken', 'RussellKen', 'Russell', 'BBC', 'portrayals', 'composers', 'such', 'Delius', 'Debussy', 'Elgar', 'are', 'models', 'combining', 'drama', 'good', 'dose', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'later', 'regarding', 'TchaikovskyThe', 'Music', 'Loversand', 'LisztLisztomaniaare', 'different', 'matters', 'entirely']",N/A
900807,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000936H7S,David Bower,"[4, 4]","I rented this movie first and watched it and was amazed and fascinated by what I saw. Having seen it I immediately ordered it from Amazon and recommend it highly for several reasons. One is the music as performed on period instruments. This performance of the Eroica is dramatic and powerful. I have multiple recordings of the Eroica already and limited storage space but one hearing of this performance convinced me that was an addition to my collection that I must not pass up.The performance is by Sir John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique in an exclusive performance for this film. What was of particular interest is the actual members of the orchestra are the ones playing their instruments in the film. These are not actors clumsily pretending to play but the real thing. I was also fascinated by the period instruments they were playing; horns and trumpets with no valves and wind instruments that looked very different from their contemporaries.Another feature of the film is the inclusion of a recreation of the actual events that took place at the original performance including the famous protest by Ferdinand Ries of the early entrance of the horn in the first movement. The Eroica was a dramatic departure from the expected and introduced changes in the symphonic style that were disturbing, challenging and emotional. The film carefully shows the range of emotions generated by a first hearing of this revolutionary work.Also included on the disc is a full, uninterrupted performance of the Eroica by the orchestra which takes out the interruptions and plays the symphony in its entirety. The audio is available in two formats, LPCM STEREO AND DTS 5.1 SURROUND. If you have the system to accommodate it I heartily recommend the DTS surround.Another feature included is a very nice booklet on ""Eroica, The day that changed music forever."" The booklet includes a summary of the events surrounding the composition and first performance of Eroica, the cast and even the names of the members of the orchestra that appear in the film and their instruments. From this we learn that the orchestra is composed of 6 violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos (my instrument), 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 3 horns (2 players listed), 2 trumpets, and tympani (one in E flat and one in B flat).Watching this movie was a catalyst for me to review my music history and enjoy all over again the wonder of an era and a man that created such an enduring work.

900809,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B000936H7S,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[1, 2]","First of all, the title is Eroica, not erotica, and the movie has nothing to do with eroticism. Eroica means heroism, and in the present context refers to the nickname of Beethoven's 3rd symphony, which, as the film tells it, revolutionized Western music since the days it was invented in Italy in the 15th-16th centuries.The film tells the first rehearsal of the symphony at one of Beethoven's patrons' palace. The actors in the small orchestra are real classical musicians, and they perform on period instruments, meaning instruments used back in the days of Beethoven, different from the modern instruments we hear in concert hall today.About the musical performance: it's fantastic! I didn't expect such great sound and quality from such a small band of musicians. There're just six or seven violins, two or three violas, and two each of the other instruments. The sound engineer did a very good job capturing the sound of the music. The interpretation of the symphony is fairly conventional, which is not a bad thing. As revolutionary as the Eroica symphony was, it was a classical piece, and above the seeming chaos, tonality and melody and harmony still rule.The drama part of the film is integrated into the performance. As the musicians rehearse the piece -- and how well and smoothly they do it on first reading!! -- we see the small audience's reaction, from indifference to anger to mesmerization to admiration. There's also a bit about Beethoven's romance with a countess. As a drama, there isn't much here, and I do wish the symphony's background as well as Beethoven's relations to the aristocrats were developed and explored more. The appearance of Haydn was a dramatic one (no pun intended), but again, it was done more as an afterthought and could have been developed so powerfully, teacher vs. student, old vs. new, and all that.Finally, I do want to say that the acting is fabulous here. Each of the actors (and the musicians) feels at ease and gives believable performances. The cinematography is beautiful.I love this movie. I just wish the story part were more fleshed out and the entire film longer. After all, the Eroica is indeed a monumental piece in the history of Western music that few other pieces can compare to.",4,"A well-done period ""faux documentary"" by BBC!",1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,2244,"['First', 'all', 'title', 'Eroica', 'not', 'erotica', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'eroticism', 'Eroica', 'heroism', 'present', 'context', 'refers', 'nickname', 'Beethoven', '3rd', 'symphony', 'film', 'revolutionized', 'Western', 'music', 'days', 'was', 'invented', 'Italy', '15th-16th', 'centuries.The', 'film', 'first', 'rehearsal', 'symphony', 'one', 'Beethoven', 'patrons', 'palace', 'actors', 'small', 'orchestra', 'are', 'real', 'classical', 'musicians', 'perform', 'period', 'instruments', 'meaning', 'instruments', 'used', 'back', 'days', 'Beethoven', 'different', 'modern', 'instruments', 'hear', 'concert', 'hall', 'musical', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'such', 'great', 'sound', 'quality', 'small', 'band', 'musicians', ""'re"", 'just', 'six', 'seven', 'violins', 'two', 'three', 'violas', 'two', 'other', 'instruments', 'sound', 'engineer', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'sound', 'music', 'interpretation', 'symphony', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'As', 'revolutionary', 'Eroica', 'symphony', 'was', 'was', 'classical', 'piece', 'seeming', 'chaos', 'tonality', 'melody', 'harmony', 'still', 'rule.The', 'drama', 'part', 'film', 'integrated', 'performance', 'musicians', 'rehearse', 'piece', 'how', 'well', 'smoothly', 'do', 'first', 'reading', 'see', 'small', 'audience', 'reaction', 'indifference', 'anger', 'mesmerization', 'admiration', 'also', 'bit', 'Beethoven', 'romance', 'countess', 'drama', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'do', 'wish', 'symphony', 'background', 'as', 'well', 'Beethoven', 'relations', 'aristocrats', 'were', 'developed', 'explored', 'more', 'appearance', 'Haydn', 'was', 'dramatic', 'one', 'pun', 'intended', 'again', 'was', 'done', 'more', 'afterthought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'so', 'powerfully', 'vs.', 'student', 'old', 'vs.', 'new', 'that.Finally', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'acting', 'fabulous', 'here', 'actors', 'musicians', 'feels', 'ease', 'believable', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'beautiful.I', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'story', 'part', 'were', 'more', 'fleshed', 'entire', 'film', 'longer', 'Eroica', 'indeed', 'monumental', 'piece', 'history', 'Western', 'music', 'few', 'other', 'pieces', 'can', 'compare']",N/A
900810,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B000936H7S,Giordano Bruno,"[4, 4]","My five stars are for the uninterrupted performance of Beethoven's Third Symphony by the Revoultionary Romantic Orchestra on their historic instruments, in full costume in the setting of a Rococo palace. That performance can be accessed and played independently, and it is a fine rendition of the Eroica, perhaps one of the best available, well worth playing even if you choose to do the ironing or to pump iron rather than watching the monitor. If you are unacquainted with the kinds of horns, clarinets, and other instruments that Beethoven wrote for, this video is an easy and enjoyable way to observe them in action. The orchestra is far smaller than any you would hear in a big symphony hall, and that's waht makes it musically superior, since you don't need the volume of 30 violins and ten violas in your living room. With smaller forces, the tuning is better and the acoustical transparency allows you to hear the inner voices and the subtleties of part writing. Conductor John Eliot Gardiner has a very well-defined sense of this symphony, of its contrasting sonorities and dynamics. Yes, he asserts that he's following Beethoven's instruction precisely, but in fact he's doing more than that. He's judiciously interpreting a whole conception of the piece, and that's what makes him a superb conductor.The scripted portrayal of the premier of the Eroica, in the salon of a Viennese aristocrat, is an amusing bagatelle, worth watching precisely once. I don't find the portrayal of Beethoven particularly convincing, despite which the episode is evocative of the ambiance in which Beethoven lived and worked. It's more a teaching tool than a drama; in fact, I think it could be usefully shown to a high school class.Get the video for the vivid interpretation of the symphony, and regard the playlet as a bonus feature.",5,"MTV for Us, Fellow Classicists!",1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1825,"['five', 'stars', 'are', 'uninterrupted', 'performance', 'Beethoven', 'Third', 'Symphony', 'Revoultionary', 'Romantic', 'Orchestra', 'historic', 'instruments', 'full', 'costume', 'setting', 'Rococo', 'palace', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'played', 'independently', 'fine', 'rendition', 'Eroica', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'available', 'well', 'playing', 'even', 'choose', 'do', 'ironing', 'pump', 'iron', 'rather', 'watching', 'monitor', 'are', 'unacquainted', 'kinds', 'horns', 'clarinets', 'other', 'instruments', 'Beethoven', 'wrote', 'video', 'easy', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'observe', 'action', 'orchestra', 'far', 'smaller', 'would', 'hear', 'big', 'symphony', 'hall', 'waht', 'musically', 'superior', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'volume', '30', 'violins', 'ten', 'violas', 'living', 'room', 'smaller', 'forces', 'tuning', 'better', 'acoustical', 'transparency', 'hear', 'inner', 'voices', 'subtleties', 'part', 'writing', 'Conductor', 'John', 'Eliot', 'Gardiner', 'very', 'well-defined', 'sense', 'symphony', 'contrasting', 'sonorities', 'dynamics', 'Yes', 'following', 'Beethoven', 'instruction', 'precisely', 'fact', 'doing', 'more', 'judiciously', 'interpreting', 'whole', 'conception', 'piece', 'what', 'superb', 'conductor.The', 'scripted', 'portrayal', 'premier', 'Eroica', 'salon', 'Viennese', 'aristocrat', 'amusing', 'bagatelle', 'worth', 'watching', 'precisely', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'portrayal', 'Beethoven', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'episode', 'evocative', 'ambiance', 'Beethoven', 'lived', 'worked', 'more', 'teaching', 'tool', 'drama', 'fact', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'usefully', 'shown', 'high', 'school', 'class.Get', 'video', 'vivid', 'interpretation', 'symphony', 'regard', 'playlet', 'bonus', 'feature']",N/A

900814,A1BSZ4000U2UCK,B000936H7S,Michael George,"[1, 1]","This movie intertwines a performance of Beethoven's Eroica with acting meant to give a sense of ""atmosphere"".  The result is quite interesting, as it takes us beyond just the music to consider the artistic creation.For example, Beethoven's deafness of his later years is introduced to a limited extent:  At this time in his life, Beethoven was beginning to experience some hearing-impairment.  However, we can also interpret this in the context of the movie as symbolic.  Certainly, music as an auditory experience allows us to see deafness in a great composer as indicating that of music represents an internal and intellectual experience.If we see the ""deafness"" as metaphoric, then we can take it to indicate Beethoven's failure to consider the corruption of power that might be part of the reality of Napoleon's rise to power.  One recognizes a subtle underlying randomness:  Had Napoleon declared himself emperor at an earlier point in time, Beethoven might not have been motivated to produce the deep work of art represented by Eroica.Certainly, Eroica was presented as ""for"" the aristocracy, and an aristocracy for which Beethoven labored, but for which in many respects, he merely represented another craftsman, like one of the musicians.  One was struck, in this way, by the few for whom such music was of interest.  One of the fascinating aspects that is communicated in the film was that while Beethoven's genius was recognized, the importance of his music was not fully appreciated.Overall, the performance, both the music and acting, was one of subtlety, and I found that, at least for me, the little background drama in the midst of Beethoven's beautiful music, did not detract, but added poignant and thoughtful elements to his powerful music.  I can understand that for some, this departure into fantasy and away from historical accuracy might seem offensive.  However, I found it quite effective, as part of an overall ""framework"" in which to present a performance of the music.",5,framing powerful music,1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,1995,"['movie', 'performance', 'Beethoven', 'Eroica', 'acting', 'meant', 'give', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'result', 'quite', 'interesting', 'just', 'music', 'consider', 'artistic', 'creation.For', 'example', 'Beethoven', 'deafness', 'later', 'years', 'introduced', 'limited', 'extent', 'time', 'life', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'beginning', 'experience', 'hearing-impairment', 'However', 'can', 'also', 'interpret', 'context', 'movie', 'symbolic', 'Certainly', 'music', 'auditory', 'experience', 'see', 'deafness', 'great', 'composer', 'indicating', 'music', 'internal', 'intellectual', 'experience.If', 'see', 'deafness', 'metaphoric', 'then', 'can', 'take', 'indicate', 'Beethoven', 'failure', 'consider', 'corruption', 'power', 'might', 'be', 'part', 'reality', 'Napoleon', 'rise', 'power', 'One', 'subtle', 'underlying', 'randomness', 'Had', 'Napoleon', 'declared', 'emperor', 'earlier', 'point', 'time', 'Beethoven', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'motivated', 'produce', 'deep', 'work', 'art', 'represented', 'Eroica.Certainly', 'Eroica', 'was', 'presented', 'aristocracy', 'aristocracy', 'Beethoven', 'labored', 'many', 'respects', 'merely', 'represented', 'craftsman', 'one', 'musicians', 'One', 'was', 'struck', 'way', 'few', 'whom', 'such', 'music', 'was', 'interest', 'One', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'communicated', 'film', 'was', 'Beethoven', 'genius', 'was', 'recognized', 'importance', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'appreciated.Overall', 'performance', 'music', 'acting', 'was', 'one', 'subtlety', 'found', 'least', 'little', 'background', 'drama', 'midst', 'Beethoven', 'beautiful', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'added', 'poignant', 'thoughtful', 'elements', 'powerful', 'music', 'can', 'understand', 'departure', 'fantasy', 'away', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'might', 'seem', 'offensive', 'However', 'found', 'quite', 'effective', 'part', 'overall', 'framework', 'present', 'performance', 'music']",N/A
900815,ANCPT9G4L1JZS,B000936H7S,"Paul S. Rottenberg ""stevenrothbardt""","[4, 4]","I am primarily interested in the musical value of DVDs (although the video aspect is certainly important), so I must first say that the sound on this disc is simply stunning, probably the best I've ever heard. Just listen to the beginning in which the concertmaster (the real one) of the orchestra tunes up in the magnificient acoustic of the beautiful all-wood room the orchestra will play in. The BBC is to be congratulated for a very fine production on this disc, and the picture quality is also excellent. But, it is the music that I am mainly interested in, and the performance it receives is quite revelatory; it is the most firey and radically revolutionary performance imaginable. It is played by the ""period"" instrument group The Revolutionary and Romantic Orchestra under its conductor John Eliot Gardiner.  It is different from their recording on cd with the same musicians in that it uses somewhat smaller forces, and some may complain that the string body is too small, but what is gained is a chamber-like clarity and verve of playing that has to be heard by all.The greatness of this music lies in several elements, but highest among them is the continuous sense of forward movement and in an almost inexaustable invention or development. The words of the Princess Lobkowitz (played by Fenella Woolgar), wife of one of Beethoven's main patrons in the teleplay are very appropriate here: ""My God! It's like a dam bursting!"" Indeed, this is precisely true. Beethoven achieved something in this symphony that no one had before, and that even he hardly did again. The development section alone is almost as long as the entire first movement of one of Haydn or Mozart's late symphonies. Up to 1815 or so, he still prefered the ""Eroica"" above his other symphonies (the 9th was to come), and it is this increadible ability to build and to continue building until it seems it will never end (and it does only because of the demands of nature) that make the ""Eroica,"" except perhaps for the 9th, the greatest symphony, and it is this element that comes out most strongly on this disc.And for the teleplay, sure, Beethoven wouldn't have told his piano student Reiss (played by Leo Bill) to bug off in the rude manner shown here if he was the company of the ladies or in public at all, but it hardly matters. Movies such as ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" both contain far less truth and accuracy in their tales, and yet they work due to the energy put into them. I've yet to see a movie or teleplay on a composer or famous person which is completely accurate,and, of course, you can't be; you just have to be true to the spirit of the person, and ""Eroica"" does that.  However,most of what happens in the teleplay actually did happen, just not quite in the same way, and not always at the same time. For example, at one of the early rehearsals of the ""Eroica,"" Beethoven did almost strike Reiss in what they used to call a ""box"" of his ears, sort of a ""dope slap,"" when Reiss complained that the horn came in too soon, and the little joke at the beginning in which Beethoven calls himself a ""brain-owner"" is actually taken from a letter he sent to his younger brother who had just bought some land and had then boastfully called himself a land-owner. Beethoven then sent a letter back, signing himself ""Your Brother, Ludwig, Brain-Owner.""  In addition, the pompous Count Dietrichstein (Tim Piggot-Smith) represents the critics of Beethoven's music. There is certainly some very good acting here along with some which is just adequate, but in general, this is up to the BBC's generally high standards for TV drama. See the great Frank Finlay as Haydn, for example.In addition, the orchestra certainly didn't play the entire symphony perfectly after the second or third attempt of just the first few bars, as we see here, but who'd want to see exactly what really did happen, which was that the players went over and over the entire score before Beethoven was even slightly satisfied. Tempers were short and everyone was ready to quit when the prince saved everything with food and drink (which is what we see in the teleplay). So, historical accuracy must bow to dramatic demands and to the patience of the audience.However, if you still don't like the drama (and some British TV viewers were upset over the portrayal of The Maestro), then go to the Menu, which allows you to watch the performance of the music alone with the video showing you a facsimile of Beethoven's original manuscript. Even if you can't read music, you'll be able to follow along enough, and you'll be captivated by looking into the mind of a great genus. And just listen to the snarling horns in the trio of the scherzo, and you'll never be able to listen to this trememdous music in quite the same way again.  That's what Beethoven wants-- for you to see music--and the world-- in a new way.  By the way, if you like this DVD, you should get Michael Tilson Thomas' ""Keeping Score"" DVD on Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, and, for that matter, ALL the DVDs in his series with the San Fransisco Symhony. His performance of the ""Eroica"" is obviously imformed by this one by John Eliot Gardiner and his Revolutionary and Romantic (and revelatory!) players, and he presents a very interesting analysis of Beethoven's psychology and how it's encoded in the music.  By the way, for extra-wary customers, you can see ""Eroica"" on YouTube, but keep in mind that both picture and sound are greatly inferior to full DVD quality.

There is a rivetting scene in Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" wherein we enter the inner thoughts of various audience members whilst they listen to Tchaikovsky's live-performance of one of his piano concertos.  In ""Eroica"" we do not enter the listeners heads on a visual level:  we just watch their reactions through facial and bodily gesture...to the point of total nausea!  (Timothy Piggott-Smith's unspoken facial reactions to the second movement is an admittedly masterful moment....but this one magic moment does not make for an enjoyable film.)  We are subjected to the Prince's wife's simpering smiling stupid look over-and-over-and-over again-and-again-and-again....as well as the flirtatious glances betwixt a servant boy and girl. And constant zoom shots into Beethoven and Haydn grow tedious and seem silly after a bit also. All of this just goes on all too long and to a terrifically boring effect.  Plus, Gardiner as Beethoven - well, I've seen more convincing acting in high school plays!  He just never seems real.  And speaking of ""real"":  how likely is it that the orchestra would be able to perform this revolutionary symphony cold - with no rehearsal (this film is showing the first rehearsal!) and yet they perform it (except at the beginning when Beethoven unloads on them to give it more ""guts"")...still, after begin yelled at one time only, they perform it perfectly!!!  When they first see the score, there are reaction shots of the musicians befuddlement over the newness of the musical notations, etc - yet they pull it off without a hitch!  Anyway - buy a CD of ""Eroica"", close your eyes and envision your own thoughts and feelings.  Watching this movie can actually make a person end up hating the music due to its accompanying Chinese water-torture visuals.

900819,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,B000936H7S,Steven A. Peterson,"[10, 11]","This CD represents an intriguing concept:  a drama based on the first performance (a kind of rehearsal) of Beethoven's magnificent Symphony # 3, originally dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte (but changed after learning of Bonaparte's accession to Emperor). A lot of dramatic elements are encapsulated in this BBC production. The music, I think, dominates, but here I will review the drama (at another point, I may review the symphony itself, which is also included on this CD).The music itself is played by Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner. And a nice version of the Third Symphony this is. A number of the musicians (not the full orchestra) actually play the role of musicians in this drama.The structure of the drama is around the four movements of this work.  Some cannot comprehend what they are hearing; others are delighted by the novelty. Between movements, there are exchanges and interactions among the characters.  Ian Hart plays Ludwig van Beethoven, and does not do badly. He is in turn rude and vulnerable and brilliant; he is beginning to experience the deafness that afflicted him the rest of his life (is it not astonishing that he composed the late symphonies, the late string quartets, and so on while being deaf?).We see Count Dietrichstein hating the music, because it does not conform to the formalities of symphonies. This represents a nice counterpoint, later, when ""Papa"" Haydn stops by to listen and concludes after the fourth movement that ""Everything is different from today.""The drama notes an unhappy ending to a romance that he would like to conclude with marriage; the promise of financial support from Prince Lobkowitz; his testy relationship with a student (he concurs with Haydn that ""students are idiots"").The drama is adequate, but it is the music that scintillates and is the heart of this work. Nonetheless, the drama itself is worth watching for a portrayal (not always accurate) of Beethoven and his times (including class relationships).

I have loved the Eroica since I was about 14 or 15 years old and I have always been moved by the work's passion, daring, drama, wealth of ideas and its wildness. I was brought up on the old '63 von Karajan/Berlin Phil recording and it inspired me a lot many years ago. The work was also on the Australian High School music curriculum in the 1970s and I studied the score in detail, like thousands of other Aussie kids. However, Christopher Hogwood's 1985 recording of the work for L'Oiseau-Lyre with his period instrument orchestra, The Academy of Ancient Music, really inspired me even more and yet again. Surely this was a work in which Beethoven pushed the 18th century orchestra to its limit and then some? I also have the Norrington and Gardiner CD recordings of the work. The Gardiner/Orchestre R&eacute;volutionnaire et Romantique recording is the best of the H.I.P. recordings in my opinion.This DVD gives us some idea of circumstances of the first performance of this work in Prince Lobkowitz's Palace. The acting from all concerned is very good. Ian Hart turns in a very fine performance as Beethoven, and gives Gary Oldman (whom I liked very much in ""The Immortal Beloved"") a run for his money. Jack Davenport plays the enormously sympathetic and worldly Prince Lobkowitz with great style and affection. Marie Lobkowitz, his wife, is played with passion, zest and relish by Fenella Woolgar. I didn't really like the choice of Frank Finlay as Haydn, I imagined Haydn as a much more of an ""earthy aristocrat"" in his senior years, Mr. Finlay tended to play him as a ""grumpy old man"". However, this is a minor quibble, and the entire cast is magnificent, even the players of small roles.Now the Orchestre R&eacute;volutionnaire et Romantique plays the work with power, pizzazz and daring. Yes, this was a revolutionary work, probably the most revolutionary piece of music ever composed, well, it is certainly ""up there"" with Machaut's Messe de Notre Dame, Johannes Ockeghem's Missa pro defunctis, Brumel's Missa ""et ecce terr motus"", Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine, Biber's Mystery Sonatas, Rameau's ""Zoroastre"", Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"", Schoenberg's ""Pierrot Lunaire"", Strauss's ""Elektra"", Stravinsky's ""Le sacre du Printemps"" [perhaps THE quintessential TwenCen ""revolutionary"" piece of music?], Berg's ""Lulu"" and Stockhausen's ""Gesang der Jungling"". John Eliot Gardiner and his band of specialist musicians work wonders with the 3rd Symphony of Beethoven and it really is my favourite version these days. I do not believe that any other recording captures the thrilling sounds Beethoven hoped an orchestra could bestow upon his written music any better than that of the O.R.e.R.Just a note to big fans of Mozart and Beethoven: isn't the first subject the exposition of the first movement of the Eroica a shameless rip-off of the theme from the 'Intrada' to ""Bastien und Bastienne"" by Mozart?

Beethoven demanded equality not from any nebulous ""royal"" bloodline, but due to his talent. With his third symphony (Eroica) he placed himself at the center of his creation: the artist as self-actualized hero. Not only did Eroica challenge old notions of composition, it also was a personal revelation of Beethoven's inner struggle. His music no longer glorified his proprietors but it glorified himself and such was the stunning brilliance of this work, it placed his name in the firmament, ushering in a new era that would come to be known as the Romantic Movement. This film chronicles the day during which Beethoven revealed his latest composition to a stunned orchestra and his own royal court. Also present on that day was Joseph Hayden, a luminary of the old guard and actor Frank Finlay's brilliant performance nearly steals the show. After the performance Hayden was asked for his critique, and while he seemed a bit perplexed as to whether he ""enjoyed"" the piece or not, he immediately grasped its importance by uttering these immortal words, ""Everything is different as from today.""",4,The artist as self-actualized hero.,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,1259,"['Prior', 'Beethoven', 'composers', 'were', 'servants', 'Kings', 'Princes', 'other', 'noble', 'gentry-', 'essentially', 'belonging', 'courts', 'who', 'provided', 'living', 'Beethoven', 'demanded', 'equality', 'not', 'nebulous', 'royal', 'bloodline', 'due', 'talent', 'third', 'symphony', 'Eroica', 'placed', 'center', 'creation', 'artist', 'self-actualized', 'hero', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Eroica', 'challenge', 'old', 'notions', 'composition', 'also', 'was', 'personal', 'revelation', 'Beethoven', 'inner', 'struggle', 'music', 'no', 'longer', 'glorified', 'proprietors', 'glorified', 'such', 'was', 'stunning', 'brilliance', 'work', 'placed', 'name', 'firmament', 'ushering', 'new', 'era', 'would', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Romantic', 'Movement', 'film', 'day', 'Beethoven', 'revealed', 'latest', 'composition', 'stunned', 'orchestra', 'own', 'royal', 'court', 'Also', 'present', 'day', 'was', 'Joseph', 'Hayden', 'luminary', 'old', 'guard', 'actor', 'Frank', 'Finlay', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show', 'performance', 'Hayden', 'was', 'asked', 'critique', 'seemed', 'bit', 'perplexed', 'enjoyed', 'piece', 'not', 'immediately', 'grasped', 'importance', 'uttering', 'immortal', 'words', 'Everything', 'different', 'today']",N/A
900822,A1POZH0D7NU8Q2,B000936H7S,T. Holland,"[36, 38]","I am coming off a long evening of watching and rewatching this film, both beginning to end and piecemeal (sorting out thematic scenes).  I had seen it a few times before, but hadn't systematically studied it.  The film is neither a performance of the ""Eroica"" nor a historical pageant about Beethoven's biography, yet it manages to incorporate both of the above into something rather more ambitious.  Incorporating a blazing performance of the symphony on period instruments into a reconstruction of its first performance at the Lobkowitz Palace, it manages to make a lot of statements about art, music, biography and history without ever being didactic.  The acting is magnificent; understated and mostly mute, it characterizes Prince Lobkowitz and his wife, his arrogant aristocratic cousin, Haydn, various servants and musicians, and Beethoven's poor despised pupil in a few strokes of body language and fewer words.  It combines historical fact with biographical speculation, without aggrandizing or overstating either.  It's really a film about a moment in musical history, which is best encapsulated in Haydn's few comments towards the end of the film.  The performances, both musical and theatrical, are terrific.  On my first few viewings, I was bothered by the characterization of Beethoven (a bit too tentative, and too unpredictable in his moods).  On further viewing, and further reflection, I think it fits perfectly.  As a film biography of a musician and his work, it certainly beats anything else I've seen hands down (the creepy and silly ""Amadeus,"" as exhibit A).The last two movements of the symphony are played partially in background, behind wrapups of thematic sequences.  At first this bothered me (why not play the whole symphony, and put the other material between or after movements?).  In retrospect, after a few viewings, I think it puts the music, life, and history into the proper perspective:  and after all, it's a film, not a music video.Final thought:  the performance of the symphony is wonderful!",5,Neither flesh nor fowl; neither history nor MTV.,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2032,"['am', 'coming', 'off', 'long', 'evening', 'watching', 'rewatching', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'piecemeal', 'sorting', 'out', 'thematic', 'scenes', 'had', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'had', ""n't"", 'systematically', 'studied', 'film', 'performance', 'Eroica', 'historical', 'pageant', 'Beethoven', 'biography', 'incorporate', 'above', 'something', 'rather', 'more', 'ambitious', 'Incorporating', 'blazing', 'performance', 'symphony', 'period', 'instruments', 'reconstruction', 'first', 'performance', 'Lobkowitz', 'Palace', 'make', 'lot', 'statements', 'art', 'music', 'biography', 'history', 'ever', 'being', 'didactic', 'acting', 'magnificent', 'understated', 'mostly', 'mute', 'Prince', 'Lobkowitz', 'wife', 'arrogant', 'aristocratic', 'cousin', 'Haydn', 'various', 'servants', 'musicians', 'Beethoven', 'poor', 'despised', 'pupil', 'few', 'strokes', 'body', 'language', 'fewer', 'words', 'historical', 'fact', 'biographical', 'speculation', 'aggrandizing', 'overstating', 'either', 'really', 'film', 'moment', 'musical', 'history', 'best', 'encapsulated', 'Haydn', 'few', 'comments', 'end', 'film', 'performances', 'musical', 'theatrical', 'are', 'terrific', 'first', 'few', 'viewings', 'was', 'bothered', 'characterization', 'Beethoven', 'bit', 'too', 'tentative', 'too', 'unpredictable', 'moods', 'further', 'viewing', 'further', 'reflection', 'think', 'perfectly', 'film', 'biography', 'musician', 'work', 'certainly', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hands', 'down', 'creepy', 'silly', 'Amadeus', 'exhibit', 'A', '.The', 'last', 'two', 'movements', 'symphony', 'are', 'played', 'partially', 'background', 'wrapups', 'thematic', 'sequences', 'first', 'bothered', 'why', 'not', 'play', 'whole', 'symphony', 'put', 'other', 'material', 'movements', 'retrospect', 'few', 'viewings', 'think', 'music', 'life', 'history', 'proper', 'perspective', 'film', 'not', 'music', 'video.Final', 'thought', 'performance', 'symphony', 'wonderful']",N/A
