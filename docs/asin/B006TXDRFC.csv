Features are a little soft because of the source material, but I didn't find myself unable to tell what was happening at any given moment.If you're looking to introduce Valentino to friends who aren't silent film buffs, you may want to opt for a cleaner picture in a different film, such as Kino's BLOOD AND SAND or a good print of SON OF THE SHIEK.",5,I Care about MB,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,481,"['Monsieur', 'Beaucaire', 'nice', 'little', 'period', 'piece', 'Valentino', 'cast', 'music', 'tastefully', 'performed', 'Grapevine', 'release', 'Features', 'are', 'little', 'soft', 'source', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'unable', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'given', 'moment.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'introduce', 'Valentino', 'friends', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'silent', 'film', 'buffs', 'may', 'want', 'opt', 'cleaner', 'picture', 'different', 'film', 'such', 'Kino', 'BLOOD', 'SAND', 'good', 'print', 'SON', 'THE', 'SHIEK']",N/A

I recall when ordering ""Beyond the Rocks"" (a film recently discovered sitting in a tin in the Netherlands for almost a century and requiring serious restoration) anticipating viewing issues.  However, next to ""Monsieur Beaucaire"" the restored ""Beyond the Rocks"" looks fresh.I cannot help but think the poor editing was deliberate, as this was one of the films that Valentino's wife, Natacha Rambova, was very involved in making.  The costume designs (what you are able to see of them) are gorgeous.  The sets she designed WERE probably just a breathtaking, but you can see so little of the sets!Valentino was of course just terrific.  The too main female stars, Bebe Daniels and Doris Kenyon, were exquisite - and so too their costumes.  Really, dressed according to the era, I also think the studios in their quest to keep Valentino malleable, were at the heart of getting the media to suggest his outfits in the film demonstrated a lack of manliness.  It was the same crazy-good-looking Rudy wearing a powered wig, romancing the ladies.  He duels in this one too.Anyway, if you are a die-hard Valentino fan - get the movie.  However, expect very inky dark settings and trouble reading the title cards in lots of the movie.Kerry",2,"VERY, VERY POOR QUALITY",1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,1331,"['first', 'Valentino', 'DVD', 'have', 'purchased', 'rec', ""'d"", 'gift', 'was', 'such', 'poor', 'quality', 'recall', 'when', 'ordering', 'Rocks', 'film', 'recently', 'discovered', 'sitting', 'tin', 'Netherlands', 'almost', 'century', 'requiring', 'serious', 'restoration', 'anticipating', 'viewing', 'issues', 'However', 'next', 'Monsieur', 'Beaucaire', 'restored', 'Rocks', 'fresh.I', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'poor', 'editing', 'was', 'deliberate', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'Valentino', 'wife', 'Natacha', 'Rambova', 'was', 'very', 'involved', 'making', 'costume', 'designs', 'what', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'designed', 'WERE', 'probably', 'just', 'breathtaking', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'sets', 'Valentino', 'was', 'course', 'just', 'terrific', 'too', 'main', 'female', 'stars', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'Doris', 'Kenyon', 'were', 'exquisite', 'so', 'too', 'costumes', 'Really', 'dressed', 'according', 'era', 'also', 'think', 'studios', 'quest', 'keep', 'Valentino', 'malleable', 'were', 'heart', 'getting', 'media', 'suggest', 'outfits', 'film', 'demonstrated', 'lack', 'manliness', 'was', 'same', 'crazy-good-looking', 'Rudy', 'wearing', 'powered', 'wig', 'romancing', 'ladies', 'one', 'too.Anyway', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Valentino', 'fan', 'get', 'movie', 'However', 'expect', 'very', 'inky', 'dark', 'settings', 'trouble', 'reading', 'title', 'cards', 'lots', 'movie.Kerry']",N/A

Overall the film, story and production was fine, with lavish costumes and stagings presented.  However, the quality of the DVD-R was very disappointing, in fact very poor.  With it being a re-recording the light values were unfortunately very low and were at times so dark that it was difficult to see what action was going on or to see the details of the costumes and settings,the main production qualities intended for the film. With it being an interpretation of a novel, which itself had a very complicated story line, another problem was the number of 'interuptions' created by the very frequent 'dialogue cards' presented which constantly broke up the action of the film.It was certainly worth viewing, Valentino especially ,but the rest of the cast also, made a good job of the production. If you can overcome the problems worth a try ,at the cost.",4,Another Valentino Gem (almost),1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,952,"['Having', 'recently', 'viewed', 'number', 'Valentino', 'films', 'Beauclaire', 'did', 'seem', 'next', 'step', 'film', 'story', 'production', 'was', 'fine', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'stagings', 'presented', 'However', 'quality', 'DVD-R', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'fact', 'very', 'poor', 'being', 're-recording', 'light', 'values', 'were', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'low', 'were', 'times', 'so', 'dark', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'what', 'action', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'details', 'costumes', 'settings', 'main', 'production', 'qualities', 'intended', 'film', 'being', 'interpretation', 'novel', 'had', 'very', 'complicated', 'story', 'line', 'problem', 'was', 'number', ""'interuptions"", 'created', 'very', 'frequent', ""'dialogue"", 'cards', 'presented', 'constantly', 'broke', 'up', 'action', 'film.It', 'was', 'certainly', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Valentino', 'especially', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'made', 'good', 'job', 'production', 'can', 'overcome', 'problems', 'worth', 'try', 'cost']",N/A
