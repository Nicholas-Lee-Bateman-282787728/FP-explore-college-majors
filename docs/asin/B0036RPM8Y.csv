The duo's journey as they travel delivering the bad news forms the crux of the film. The situations are typical the senior, rookie conflicts over the methods of doing the job, their personality clashes but these two actors share such fantastic chemistry that the predictable becomes interesting. This journey is interspersed between these situations and their delivering the bad news. I thought this was not a bad movie, the love angle seemed pretty real as well but I have seen a movie about the casualty notification service called `Taking Chance' which was a far superior film for me.

Although Hollywood made, these films do not glorify the violence or the people; they just get you there.Of course watching a movie - that is any movie - is nothing close to the real thing. But at least some films try to transmit an accurate picture of the situation, including the angst, shock, anger, and demonstrate the professionalism that so often is the Soldiers' only way out.This one takes the war home, into the living rooms of the family members, lovers and children of the men and women who will never return.No guns or battles, just pain and shock - but just as dramatic as the two previously mentioned. And just like them it shows us a part of the war most of us don't know anything about. Magazine articles, TV news and what not - nothing comes close to the scenes we're shown here where families are destroyed and lives forever changed.I feel we need to watch this, each and every one of us, so we better understand the next time we talk about war.Without the Army's framework, Woody Harrelson's character would probably have ended up on the wrong side of the road. Married three times, AA, frustrated about having missed out on the real battle experience, it's his job to deliver the horrible message. He get's Ben Foster put to his side as a partner. A War-hero with his own demons to fight.Sure, this is a fictional tale, with the characters' personalities adding to the drama. But with the excellent camera work and the fabulous script the story hits home from the first scene on.And when you think it's boring to watch these men deliver their message over and over again - think again. These two actors - and the others - are perfectly cast with each of them delivering award worthy performances of the highest order.The Blu-ray comes packed in a plastic-free box and includes the dvd version on a separate disc. Another plus: the disc loads and there are no disturbing commercials or other previews messing with the experience. Press play and the film ""rolls"".The picture is crisp and very detailed.

1328210,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0036RPM8Y,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","A tremendous movie - I'd not heard too much about it going in and was blown away by the tale crafted and presented by director and co-writer (with Alessandro Camon), Oren Moverman.  This film got Woody Harrelson a well-deserved Oscar nomination.  It deserved a Best Picture nomination to go along with it.The movie is structured as a series of searing vignettes in which two Army officers (Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster) notify the 'N.O.K.' (next of kin) of a family member's death while serving in Iraq.  None of these encounters unspool in the same way - we see how many variables enter into how each notification plays out - the emotional state of the message's recipient, where the news gets delivered, the current state of the relationship between the NOK and the deceased, and - most notably - the current emotional state of the messenger himself.What weaves the vignettes together is the evolution of the relationship between the two messengers.  Harrelson is seen first as harshly mentoring Foster as to how to do this very delicate task...then, slowly and very realistically, a bond builds between the two of them.  It's visceral and tangible.  The screenwriters play this out with nuance and deftness.  But they call upon Harrelson and Foster to make it work.  Foster is very good.  Harrelson is other-worldly good.  In a perfect world, he'd have walked away with that Oscar.  He presents a mixture of paper-thin bravado that, when scratched, yearns for companionship.The movie's two best scenes, however, both involve a third person: Samantha Morton.  There's the heart-stopping scene when Harrelson and Foster inform her of her husband's death.  The emotions this brings out in Morton's character are...puzzling and not quite as expected.  It's such a finely acted scene that the New York Times spent an entire article breaking it down - Morton's shaking and re-shaking of the messengers' hand, her deflecting to the messengers (""this must be hard for you""), her glancing back to the house worriedly a couple of times, Harrelson's character's misinterpretation of a shirt she's drying on the line.  All of this is important.  Its meaning comes out in pieces as the movie progresses.The other scene of note:  many days later in Morton's kitchen between she and Foster.  It can't be explained here without a plot revelation.  But, again, it's expertly scripted, directed and acted.",5,Should have scored an Oscar nomination for Best Picture,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,2389,"['tremendous', 'movie', ""'d"", 'not', 'heard', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'tale', 'crafted', 'presented', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Alessandro', 'Camon', 'Oren', 'Moverman', 'film', 'got', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'go', 'along', 'it.The', 'movie', 'structured', 'series', 'searing', 'vignettes', 'two', 'Army', 'officers', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'notify', 'N.O.K', 'kin', 'family', 'member', 'death', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'None', 'encounters', 'unspool', 'same', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'variables', 'enter', 'how', 'notification', 'out', 'emotional', 'state', 'message', 'recipient', 'where', 'news', 'delivered', 'current', 'state', 'relationship', 'NOK', 'deceased', 'most', 'notably', 'current', 'emotional', 'state', 'messenger', 'vignettes', 'together', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'two', 'messengers', 'Harrelson', 'seen', 'first', 'harshly', 'mentoring', 'Foster', 'how', 'do', 'very', 'delicate', 'task', 'then', 'slowly', 'very', 'realistically', 'bond', 'builds', 'two', 'visceral', 'tangible', 'screenwriters', 'play', 'out', 'nuance', 'deftness', 'call', 'Harrelson', 'Foster', 'make', 'work', 'Foster', 'very', 'good', 'Harrelson', 'other-worldly', 'good', 'perfect', 'world', ""'d"", 'have', 'walked', 'away', 'Oscar', 'mixture', 'paper-thin', 'bravado', 'when', 'scratched', 'yearns', 'companionship.The', 'movie', 'two', 'best', 'scenes', 'however', 'involve', 'third', 'person', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'heart-stopping', 'scene', 'when', 'Harrelson', 'Foster', 'inform', 'husband', 'death', 'emotions', 'out', 'Morton', 'character', 'are', 'puzzling', 'not', 'quite', 'expected', 'such', 'finely', 'acted', 'scene', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'spent', 'entire', 'article', 'breaking', 'down', 'Morton', 'shaking', 're-shaking', 'messengers', 'hand', 'deflecting', 'messengers', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'glancing', 'back', 'house', 'worriedly', 'couple', 'times', 'Harrelson', 'character', 'misinterpretation', 'shirt', 'drying', 'line', 'important', 'meaning', 'out', 'pieces', 'movie', 'other', 'scene', 'note', 'many', 'days', 'later', 'Morton', 'kitchen', 'Foster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'here', 'plot', 'revelation', 'again', 'expertly', 'scripted', 'directed', 'acted']",N/A

This finely crafted story about two Army officers who notify next of kin of the death of a solider is a surprising addition to the growing collection of Iraq/Afghanistan war movies.  I know the press and Hollywood like to talk about how these recent war movies of the last decade aren't making a big box office splash like Saving Private Ryan (1998) or Pearl Harbor (2001) did, and yet these films keep getting made and finding an audience.  And I'm definitely a member of that audience.  I don't think any of them are as good as Saving Private Ryan or the other great WWII movies of the last 15-20 years, but these wars are different and the movies reflect that. WWII will probably never be matched in its clarity and power of story.  Hitler was such a perfect black-and-white villain, whereas the Iraq and Afghanistan wars really have no ""clear"" villain.The Messenger stars Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster, both giving some of the best performances of their careers.  Harrelson was rightly nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of a damaged army officer in this film. First time director Oren Moverman has mad a nice first film.  I really enjoyed the first half of the film as it built up emotionally, but I felt that the second half just drifted away without enough focus on plot.

We probably all know someone who went, or is ""over there"" (as they refer to it in the movie) and Ben Foster's charecter is so spot on.  Woody Harleson's charecter comes accross at first as a hardend war hero, and as the movie progresses we see he is really just a broken man trying to make the best of it all.  His one-liners are priceless. (Mamma said they'll be days like this...)  I was afraid that this movie might just make me burst into tears, but I didnt cry at all.  And thats saying something.  This movie is not meant to be depressing.  I actually think it's the opposite.  Every civillian should be required by law to see this movie.  The story told in this movie made me think of how, in the past, WWII and Vietnam, it wasnt just our troops at war, America as a whole was at war.  ""Support the troops"" was more than just a slogan.  It seems like the general public view the war as a 30 second newsclip on CNN or FOX news.  We forget that those boys and girls fighting over there were our classmates, played on our soccer teams, went to prom & now they are far away seeing real things that we choose to avoid talking about.  Most of us are more concerned about the newest gadget or who the bachalor gave the rose to.  This movie addresses that apathy, I think, and also addresses the reality of what a returned soldier goes thru.  The most heart wrenching parts of the movie are when the Messengers must deliver the news to next of kin whose loved one was just killed.Great movie, definatly Oscar worthy & every American should see.

Colonol Dorsett, played by Woody Harrelson in his best performance to date, shows him the ropes. The two are an unlikely duo, and despite both being combat veterans (Dorsett in Desert Storm), this assignment provides a very different stress. The two soldiers are on call every hour of every day. When a soldier dies, they race to notify the family before they hear about their love one's death somewhere else. Given their unique jobs, they spend more and more of their time together even when they're not working.The extended supporting cast members of this film are amazing. Their notifications are met with a variety of results, as we all process grief and shock differently. The supporting actors and actresses have one scene to deliver their messages of despair and grief. The film is a fascinating look into the human psyche, and it's the best war movie I've ever seen. It's a deep, thoughtful, uncomfortable look at the effects of war on individuals. Woody Harrelson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but I'm surprised Samantha Morton was not nominated for Best Supporting Actress.The Messenger is not always an easy film to watch, but it's well worth the time. It's not a movie I want to watch over and over again, but it a film I will buy and watch once every year or two. Mostly, I'll pass along my dvd to anyone who will watch it.

It's a tear jerking journey of two men's quest to respectfully and consistently do the unimaginable: deliver the news to the loved ones of fallen soldiers.  In person, mind you.I'll start by saying that this is the kind of film, much like Forrest Gump, where at its end we are sad it is over, and want to spend more time with the characters. Their story took a toll on us, sure; but we have fallen in love with them. This film has the hold over us that a great novel does. We spend so much time with the characters, that by the time the screen goes black or we reach the author's credit page, we feel like we've lost a close friend.Aside from the amazing screenplay, and the personal way the movie is filmed, this feeling is due mainly to the sensational performances of Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson. Harrelson received his much deserved Oscar nomination, but where in the holy H-E-double hockey sticks was Ben Foster's nomination? This kid is continuously being overlooked in his movies, and it's growing tiresome.I was in the Military for five years, and while I was in the Navy rather than the Army, I did a stretch of six months with them in Afghanistan. Six months may not sound like that long, but when you're in Afghanistan, there isn't much to do, so we got to know each other pretty well. The reason I'm telling you this is, both of these gentleman, Harrelson and Foster, were so convincing as U.S. soldiers, that real soldiers wouldn't know they were pretending, were it not for their fame.I know that all I've done is go on and on about how great this film is without telling you anything about it, but there is a method to my madness found in faithful repetitive praise, here. And I'm not going to tell you much else folks; as you can see by looking only a few lines below, this review is almost over.There is no reason to reveal too much in this case, for it is better served up fresh without knowing any details. And you already know all you need to, to tell if this is a film you would be interested in seeing. I will add that the film does not spend any time defending or bashing the war, or the choices our government has made. It simply tells the story of two extraordinary people and the demons they must face. And that my friends, is something we can all relate to as human beings; regardless of where we stand politically or where we may come from.",5,The Messenger Review,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,2655,"['MESSENGERSTARRING', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Steve', 'BuscemiWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Alessandro', 'Camon', 'Oren', 'MovermanDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Oren', 'MovermanRated', 'RGenre', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '15', 'November', '2009How', 'do', 'even', 'begin', 'explain', 'brilliance', 'Messenger', 'tear', 'jerking', 'journey', 'two', 'men', 'quest', 'respectfully', 'consistently', 'do', 'unimaginable', 'deliver', 'news', 'loved', 'ones', 'fallen', 'soldiers', 'person', 'mind', 'you.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'kind', 'film', 'much', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'where', 'end', 'are', 'sad', 'want', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'characters', 'story', 'took', 'toll', 'sure', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'film', 'hold', 'great', 'novel', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'characters', 'time', 'screen', 'black', 'reach', 'author', 'credit', 'page', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'close', 'friend.Aside', 'amazing', 'screenplay', 'personal', 'way', 'movie', 'filmed', 'feeling', 'due', 'mainly', 'sensational', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Harrelson', 'received', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'where', 'holy', 'H-E-double', 'hockey', 'sticks', 'was', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'nomination', 'kid', 'continuously', 'being', 'overlooked', 'movies', 'growing', 'tiresome.I', 'was', 'Military', 'five', 'years', 'was', 'Navy', 'rather', 'Army', 'did', 'stretch', 'six', 'months', 'Afghanistan', 'Six', 'months', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'long', 'when', ""'re"", 'Afghanistan', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', 'got', 'know', 'other', 'pretty', 'well', 'reason', ""'m"", 'telling', 'gentleman', 'Harrelson', 'Foster', 'were', 'so', 'convincing', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'real', 'soldiers', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'pretending', 'were', 'not', 'fame.I', 'know', ""'ve"", 'done', 'go', 'how', 'great', 'film', 'telling', 'anything', 'method', 'madness', 'found', 'faithful', 'repetitive', 'praise', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'much', 'else', 'folks', 'can', 'see', 'looking', 'only', 'few', 'lines', 'below', 'review', 'almost', 'reason', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'better', 'served', 'up', 'fresh', 'knowing', 'details', 'already', 'know', 'need', 'tell', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'will', 'add', 'film', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'defending', 'bashing', 'war', 'choices', 'government', 'made', 'simply', 'story', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'people', 'demons', 'must', 'face', 'friends', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'human', 'beings', 'regardless', 'where', 'stand', 'politically', 'where', 'may', 'come']",N/A
1328219,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0036RPM8Y,DanD,"[0, 0]","Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery, just back from Iraq, is a decorated war hero, wounded, with only three months left.  He gets assigned to deliver death notifications, under the supervision of Captain Tony Stone, a man hardened by what he has (and hasn't) seen.  When Will begins to fall for a woman whose husband has just died, he becomes a conflicted man, with his loyalties shifting between morality, the Army, and the urges of his own heart.THE MESSENGER is a beautiful film.  The two lead performances are outstanding; Ben Foster has proven again and again that he is one of the best actors on the scene right now, even in films as ho-hum as the third X-MEN and PANDORUM.  It's nice to see him in a good film again, a film that's up to the standards of his talent.  Alongside him is Woody Harrelson, an actor finding a well-deserved resurgence lately (from blockbusters such as 2012 to indie flicks like DEFENDOR).  Harrelson and Foster carry the film; they're working with a marvelous script, and some superb direction, but this is their film through-and-through.  They command every scene, as their characters get to know each other, and come to a greater understanding of what it means to be human.  Surrounding them are a stellar bunch of supporting actors (most notably Samantha Morton as Will's new flame, and Steve Buscemi as a bereaved and violent father).  Even the minor roles are filled with fine actors; certain scenes are genuinely gut-wrenching.  This film is, at times, an uncomfortable viewing experience.I suppose, on some level, THE MESSENGER is an anti-war film.  But it doesn't have an agenda.  It has a heart; it has a sense of humanity.  It is about two men doing one of the worst jobs imaginable, and how they cope in their respective ways.  This isn't a film for everyone; it's slow-burning and rather ambiguous.  If heart-wrenching, intelligent dramas aren't your thing, pass this one by.  However, if you appreciate films that are deep and powerful, anchored in reality, then you could do far worse than THE MESSENGER.

1328220,AOS5ZBTQX7QIT,B0036RPM8Y,D. Barbour,"[8, 9]","Going into this movie, I expected to love it. Rave reviews, Oscar nominations, an interesting topic - what could go wrong? Quite a bit, unfortunately. First though, the positives. I think why so many people loved this movie is due to a few very powerful scenes. The moments of grief when family members learn of their loved ones death is hard to watch - it's so real and well done. Since you cannot just watch a movie where that happens over and over again, you have to develop a story around that - and that's where the problems come in. Ben Foster plays a soldier who is recovering from massive combat injuries. He is given the ""safe"" job of accompanying a more experienced notification officer (Harrelson) as an apprentice of sorts.  Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster turn in two very touching performances in a movie that ultimately is not deserving of their talent.Where the movie veers into ""are you kidding me?!?!?!"" territory is when the young soldier starts to develop a relationship with one of the women he notifies of the loss of her husband. I won't spoil anything, but if you think the movie is going to justify both of their actions, you may be let down. A lot of the film is just an uncomfortable mess. Maybe that's the message we're supposed to be getting - war is messy - but well, I get that, I didn't need a movie to come along and tell me.

Infused with sharp writing, smart and unobtrusive direction and compelling performances, ""The Messenger"" is one of those insightful observations of the human condition that quietly sneaks up and really gets inside you, staying with you long after the credits roll. First-time director Owen Moverman and co-writer Alessandro Camon not only bring the war(s) home, but they then proceed to march up your driveway and deposit in on your doorstep. Quite literally.Knock, knock.""The Secretary of the Army has asked me to express his deep regret that your (son, daughter, husband, wife) (died/was killed in action) in (country/state) on (date). The Secretary extends his deepest sympathy to you and your family in your tragic loss.""Those are words that no one ever wants to hear, and I can't imagine any job in the world that could possibly be any worse than being the person assigned to deliver that message. ""There's no such thing as a satisfied customer,"" deadpans Casualty Notification Officer Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) to his new apprentice, Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster), who is emotionally shattered by his virgin encounter with bereaved ""NOK"".Sgt. Montgomery is a decorated, recently returned Iraq War vet whose enlistment is almost up. Although he accepts this one last thankless assignment with the stoic obedience expected from a professional soldier, he appears to privately suffer from PTSD; a condition that makes an odd bedfellow with his new responsibilities.  Stone is a hardass, a cynical careerist who carries a fair share of personal baggage himself. When he bluntly asks Montgomery if he is ""a head case"" right after meeting him, you suspect that this may be a case of ""it takes one to know one"". Stone (and Harrelson's portrayal) is reminiscent of SM1 Buddusky, Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Last Detail"".In fact, there is a lot about this film that reminds me of those episodic, naturalistic character studies that directors like Hal Ashby and Bob Rafaelson used to turn out back in the 70s; giving their actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters in a very real and believable manner. A subplot involving a relationship between Montgomery and a recently widowed Army wife (Samantha Morton) strongly recalled one of my all-time favorite sleepers from that particular era and style of filmmaking, Mark Rydell's ""Cinderella Liberty"" (worth seeking out, if you have never seen it, BTW).Although the filmmakers hold back from making any overt political statements, the notification scenes in the film say it all-we continue to ship scores of young American men and women overseas whole of limb and spirit, and return many of them home sans either or both (or in a box)...and for what justifiable reason, exactly? And as heartbreaking, gut-wrenching and hard to watch as these scenes are-I am sure they pale in comparison to the agony of those families and loved ones who have answered the door and received that news for real. I would challenge anyone who feels we ""need"" to dig ourselves in deeper into our present Middle East quagmire(s) to watch this film, reassess the justifications, and get back to me. Go.

The horrors and psychological destruction that occur on the battlefield and in the trenches awaiting encounter are only one aspect of the insanity of war. The afterburn - the effects on returning soldiers permanently damaged by the experience as well as the effects on families and loved ones who have wither been completely killed in action or simply damaged at time beyond repair - is the subject of this powerful film THE MESSENGER written (with Alessandro Camon) and directed by Oren Moverman. It follows the lives and post engagement assignments of two men fulfilling their obligations to the government by taking the roles of notifying the next of kin at the earliest possible hour after the death of a soldier is verified.The 'all business' Col. Stuart Dorsett (a powerful portrayal by Eamonn Walker) in forms the newly returned home Staff Sargeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster, in one of his most sensitive roles of his career) that despite his physical traumas he is nursing he has been assigned a Casualty Notification Officer and will be taught the ropes by ex-alcoholic Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harelson, a finely nuanced and controlled performance).  The two bond, share past experiences (Will has just been ditched by his girl Kelly - Jena Malone, etc) and begin the learning process of notifying the next of kin.  What follows is the spectrum of anguish and crushing agony played by actors Steve Buscemi, Yaya DaCosta, Portia, Lisa Joyce, et al and the effect of the encounters is blisteringly brutal.  The Will and Tony deliver the news to on Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton) whose failing marriage to her now deceased husband makes her reception of the news outlined with dignity.  This incident makes a deep impression on Will and a relationship develops between these two needy people, one that is completely forbidden by military code.  How Will and Tony deal with this miserable job and how it affects both of them is the run of the film.The film is tough to watch, so gut-wrenching is the subject matter, yet director Oren Moverman guides the film with restraint, ably assisted by the actors whose performances are all of outstanding quality, and this 'quiet' manner in which he unravels this story makes it just that much more tough to digest.  If more people would watch this film hopefully there would be more attention paid to the madness of war.  It is an important lesson, perfectly delivered.

Occasionally, the best friend dies, in order to get the hero back on track and advance the plot. One never thinks of the people at home, waiting for the best friend to return. And one certainly never thinks of the people who have to notify those loved ones. This film centers on two such soldiers, who live to bring news and grief, as they deal with their own grief, in this quiet film ""The Messenger"".Woody Harrelson turns in another award worthy performance as Captain Tony Stone, who teams up with just out of combat Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster)  to deliver news of combat deaths. Foster is dealing with an severe eye injury and an injury of the soul as he learns the details of this terrible job. On the heels of an unrequited love, Montgomery struggles with the tenets of the job as the two become a harbinger of death to those they meet. One particular widow strikes Mongomery's fancy, Olivia, who deals with the death of her husband as well as the growing attraction to the soldier who told her of it. The dichotomy between the two is delicious.Yet, the film rests squarely on the shoulders of Harrelson and Foster, and together, the two make an intimidating and formidable pair. When either is alone, the film loses a bit of its luster, and you long for the two anti-heroes to come back together again. Kudos must be given to all of the actors who performed those loved ones receiving the news. There isn't a dishonest one in the bunch, starting with a small cameo by Steve Buscemi as an angry, irate father.This isn't an easy film to watch.

1328234,ARK323I3EV98D,B0036RPM8Y,Jordan D. Wilson,"[3, 3]","I find that often times, the less information I know about a movie when I dim the lights and prepare to watch it, the more rewarding the experience turns out to be. Going into screenwriter Oren Moverman's directorial debut ""The Messenger"", I had heard some terrific things, but nothing about the story itself. It opens with Iraq War veteran Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) applying some prescription eye-drops to his freshly scarred eye, a result of a recent near-brush with death in battle. Soon to be discharged, Will is assigned to a three month post as a Casualty Notification Officer.It is explained to Will that this is not only a vital duty, but a sacred one. He is mentored by Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), who has not experienced the action that Will has, and who has a strict policy regarding his job. The two soldiers walk up to doors belonging to deceased soldiers' next of kin, knock, and deliver the bad news. It is fascinating how Tony systematically explains to Will the method by which this is done, and then to see the method in action, often times failing and leading to a flurry of tears, aggression, denial and horror. Among the unfortunate souls that they meet are Dale Martin (Steve Buscemi), whose son has died, and Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morton), whose husband has died.Will begins to develop feelings for Olivia after he and Tony inform her of her husband's death. Moverman's script, written with Alessandro Camon, beautifully unfold the effects of war on people, and the conflicting choices that tug on Will's conscience as he tries to figure out whether or not his feelings for Olivia are ethical, honest, or even decent. It's a relationship that carefully walks a tightrope between appropriate and improper. Foster is terrific in this part, as he reaches out and goes to the darkest of places, playing a man who has seen terrible things and now has to be an angel of death to families of less fortunate soldiers than himself. One father comments on this, asking Will ""why aren't you dead instead of my son?""Woody Harrelson is just as inspired, and brings an immense amount of controlled energy to Tony, who harbors much pain and sadness from having delivered the bad news so many times to so many people. He is also in AA, which is another clue that there is far more beneath his surface than he is willing to show. Having attained the rank of Captain, Tony may have made some bad decisions, and ended up on CNO duty through his own unstable temperament. The relationship that develops between Tony and Will seems familiar at first, but manages to evolve and to exude an undeniable power and originality that allows the two soldiers to constantly question the rules and methods of the job. These methods are challenged again and again, and it seems to get more and more difficult each time, rather than easier.Tony sizes Olivia up when he first sees her, but Will finds it much harder to pinpoint what drives her and what her life is like. Samantha Morton, who I believe to be one of the finest actresses working, is incredibly moving and believable as usual as the wife of a fallen soldier who she claims died long before his final tour of duty. What makes this story work is that it doesn't solely focus on the Iraq War and its casualties and victims, but exists and works on a much broader and universal level. The ideas and questions that the film raises are intended to inspire more than just tears-they are intended to make you look at the situation from another perspective and to ponder upon your own beliefs and preconceptions. Moverman's direction is tremendous, as he handles each scene with great care and creates a subtle but effective atmosphere in the door to door scenes, which are some of the most heartbreaking pieces of film ever done.""The Messenger"" somewhat resembles Katherine Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"", the best picture winner this year, structurally more than any other way. We have these two men going to people's doors, informing them of their loved one's demise, and then sort of getting lost in their own lives in between. In the case of this film, however, there is more to look at and study, as the story focuses on Will, Tony, and Olivia, showing how each manages to live in spite of the death that surrounds them.

From my perspective of being a military veteran and a VA service provider for wounded soldiers...i was spellbound by the realism, repressed emotion, and successful delivery of the message. Ben Foster is superb (Oscar nominee?) in portraying a confused, angry, frustrated soldier whose repressed guilt and shame manifest in private glimpses of his hidden PTSD symptoms. His newly assigned mission in the Casualty Notification Team is taken initially as one of the worst assignments a soldier could get, notifying ""Next of Kin"" that a soldier has been captured or killed. Even harder still is working for Captain Stone (Harrelson), an obnoxious, loud spoken, blowhard, whom SSGT Montgomery (Ben Foster) despises. This path, for SSGT Montgomery, a wounded Iraq (reluctant) war hero, takes him from extreme rejection of a horrid job... to that of profound compassion for the most honorable duty. The ""messengers"" of tragedy and loss carry out their visits and encounter a wide range of human reactions. These notification visits, accompanied by the untold backgrounds of involved families, are marvelously played out by main and supporting cast.A huge part of SSGT Montgomery's journey is the unlikely bonding with his bombastic CNO supervisor, Captain Stone---played flawlessly by Woody Harrelson. My vote is the Oscar for Supporting Actor (Harrelson) in this movie! Captain Stone has his own demons and time and circumstance yield trust, friendship and mutual sharing, for these two very different soldiers. SSGT Montgomery and Captain Stone's bonding creates a tremendous sense of understanding and unspoken allegiance. Samantha Morton is outstanding in the role of an army wife and now single mother. She presents an inspiring show of dignity, whilst feeling simultaneous guilt and relief, over her husband's death in Iraq. This shared sense of shame brings a very tender, extremely touching connection (unethical, but unavoidable) between her and Foster's character. The movie is a winner...it is fantastic and REAL..a poignant portrayal of military life and the complex emotions of being a modern soldier and wounded warrior.

Swanson,"[0, 0]","4.2 starsWith a subject as emotionally loaded as this, it feels like the filmmakers almost just need to stay out of the way and let the inherent intensity come through. And when that's done here, the movie is excellent. Harrelson and Foster are both very good, and their relationship builds well; the last twenty minutes here are outstanding in many ways.But there are a few rather disjointed moments on the way there, which is unfortunate, as what's good here is very good. Foster's budding semi-romance, which is touted in the ads and on the blu-ray box, is tertiary to the story at best, it seemed, and never began to touch me in the way that some of the other scenes did. But I guess there's always got to be a love interest to get Hollywood to make a movie.It would have been nice if the film just focused on the terrible nature of the job, on both sides of the message. Those are the moments with serious power here and they are done well. If that and the two leads' bond were explored more in depth, I think this would have been one of the best movies I've seen in years. It's still very good, but I felt like it could have been even better. All the actors are solid, and the direction is good, but the script wanders here and there when it might have been more pointed and powerful.That's brought home strongly by the short documentary included on the blu-ray, called Notification. As good as this movie is, that doc hit me far harder. It's worth getting this disc for by itself; together with the movie, it's a very fine package. The BD transfer is excellent, btw, very crisp and clear.All in all, The Messenger is well worth watching, and its own various quiet messages are worth considering. It even fits in some subtle shots at the fact that perhaps there would be no need for any messengers at all if we'd keep out of the rest of the world's business. There are no doubt many childless parents out there who would be glad to get a chance to talk about that on film, but it seems unlikely we'll be seeing that movie any time soon. Nonethless, the scene here in the shopping mall is excellent, as is the perfect bit where Foster explains how he's no hero. Those two scenes add a much deeper resonance to this film, and let's face it: how can you talk about this subject without addressing the question of what these soldiers are dying for? Those two scenes are perhaps the touchstones of The Messenger, and meant to be pondered long after the film is over.And I almost forgot Woody's great little speech about how every soldier's funeral should be on tv. What a great idea, but of course, as with our not being allowed to even see coffins coming home from Iraq, we can't have people thinking too much about all that. At least this film is here to encourage Americans to consider the real cost of war to so many mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children. It says everything about who controls what that the Hurt Locker won Best Picture while The Messneger was almost forgotten at the last Oscars. This is a much better movie, but its message is not exactly one that will make the Pentagon's budget bigger.Make sure to watch the documentary here; it's something very special.

This is a serious film about a serious subject and it is all done with a sensitivity that makes it all too real.The film stars Ben Foster as an American soldier wounded in Iraq who has just been released from the hospital and has a few months left to serve out his term of enlistment.  His new assignment partners him with career officer Woody Harrelson, (who won an Academy Award nomination for this performance). He teaches Foster the ropes of how to deal with their uncomfortable and important assignment.  It is their job to personally deliver their sad message to the next of kin in person before the death has been made public.  They show up at the person's place of residence.  Often, just their presence is message enough.  But sometimes they have to spell it out.  It is always a heartbreaking experience.  And it takes a toll on the messengers as well.Harrelson is a fast talking loudmouth recovering alcoholic;  Foster has not quite recovered from his emotional and physical wounds which include eye problems.  Together they form a bond and, as the film progresses, their back stories come out.  Foster's former girlfriend has left him for another man.  Harrelson talks a lot of military talk but there is doubt that his exploits really happened.  And Foster finds himself attracted to a young widow with a child who he has just informed that her husband is dead.

Just as others have said, this film is neither anti-war nor pro-war; it examines this single aspect of war, a horrendous consequence of war that no one can deny. The cinematography and the choreography are wonderful; and I am very impressed with the largely improvised scenes in which people are told their relative died. In addition, the script was wonderful and the casting couldn't have been done any better.When the action begins, we meet Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) who has been injured in Iraq; his left eye and one of his legs were wounded and it's not at all certain that he will fully recover his sight in that eye and the complete use of his leg. Will has three months stateside to finish his enlistment; and he is consequently assigned to ""a sacred mission"" by Colonel Stuart Dorsett (Eamonn Walker): informing next of kin that their relatives have died while serving in the military. Especially because Will has no training in this field, Colonel Dorsett assigns Will to work with the tough as nails and by-the-book Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) so that Tony can show Will the ropes. At the same time Will has the bitter disappointment that his now former girlfriend Kelly (Jena Malone) has left him for another man while he was in Iraq.We soon see that casualty notification isn't easy. Tony and Will get spit at, slapped in the face and more when the next of kin gets the bad news; their reactions are hard just to watch but it's all very realistic. However, one newly-widowed woman, Olivia (Samantha Morton) remains relatively calm and she instantly strikes Will as being remarkable; and gradually Will and Olivia develop a relationship that is strictly against military policy. Tony, of course, is against this although he can relate to Will's need for a woman; and while all this goes on Will's relationship with Tony develops in unforeseen ways as well.The plot can go in several different directions from here but I don't like to give spoilers--I don't want to ruin it for you! However, I must say that Woody Harrelson gives a brilliant performance as Captain Tony Stone and Ben Foster plays his role very well. Look also for a solid performance by Will's old girlfriend Kelly (Jena Malone).The DVD has some extras; there is an optional running commentary with director and co-writer Oren Moverman, Lawrence Inglee, Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson; and the ""Going Home"" brief featurette with the principle actors and filmmakers discussing the film is excellent. There's also a short film that has interviews with real life people, not actors, who have lost relatives in Iraq or Afghanistan and what their experience with casualty notification was like for them.The Messenger seems rather overlooked and underrated as a motion picture and I'm not sure why this is. It deals very honestly with the human pain and suffering that go hand in hand with the horrific consequences of combat fighting in war. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to see a very high quality, timely film about war and people who like the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections, too.",5,a potent and deeply emotional drama,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,3396,"['Messenger', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'film', 'aspect', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'screen', 'military', 'duty', 'give', 'casualty', 'notification', 'have', 'inform', 'next', 'kin', 'relative', 'died', 'serving', 'military', 'Just', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'anti-war', 'pro-war', 'single', 'aspect', 'war', 'horrendous', 'consequence', 'war', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'are', 'wonderful', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'largely', 'improvised', 'scenes', 'people', 'are', 'told', 'relative', 'died', 'addition', 'script', 'was', 'wonderful', 'casting', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better.When', 'action', 'meet', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Will', 'Montgomery', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'who', 'been', 'injured', 'Iraq', 'left', 'eye', 'one', 'legs', 'were', 'wounded', 'not', 'certain', 'will', 'fully', 'recover', 'sight', 'eye', 'complete', 'use', 'leg', 'Will', 'three', 'months', 'stateside', 'finish', 'enlistment', 'consequently', 'assigned', 'sacred', 'mission', 'Colonel', 'Stuart', 'Dorsett', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'informing', 'kin', 'relatives', 'have', 'died', 'serving', 'military', 'Especially', 'Will', 'training', 'field', 'Colonel', 'Dorsett', 'assigns', 'Will', 'work', 'tough', 'nails', 'by-the-book', 'Captain', 'Tony', 'Stone', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Tony', 'can', 'show', 'Will', 'ropes', 'same', 'time', 'Will', 'bitter', 'disappointment', 'now', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'left', 'man', 'was', 'Iraq.We', 'soon', 'see', 'casualty', 'notification', ""n't"", 'easy', 'Tony', 'Will', 'get', 'spit', 'slapped', 'face', 'more', 'when', 'next', 'kin', 'bad', 'news', 'reactions', 'are', 'hard', 'just', 'watch', 'very', 'realistic', 'However', 'one', 'newly-widowed', 'woman', 'Olivia', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'relatively', 'calm', 'instantly', 'strikes', 'Will', 'being', 'remarkable', 'gradually', 'Will', 'Olivia', 'develop', 'relationship', 'strictly', 'military', 'policy', 'Tony', 'course', 'can', 'relate', 'Will', 'need', 'woman', 'Will', 'relationship', 'Tony', 'develops', 'unforeseen', 'ways', 'well.The', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'several', 'different', 'directions', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'give', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Captain', 'Tony', 'Stone', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'Look', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'Will', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Jena', 'Malone', '.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Oren', 'Moverman', 'Lawrence', 'Inglee', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Going', 'Home', 'brief', 'featurette', 'principle', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'discussing', 'film', 'excellent', 'also', 'short', 'film', 'interviews', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'not', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'relatives', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'what', 'experience', 'casualty', 'notification', 'was', 'them.The', 'Messenger', 'rather', 'overlooked', 'underrated', 'motion', 'picture', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'very', 'honestly', 'human', 'pain', 'suffering', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'horrific', 'consequences', 'combat', 'fighting', 'war', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'timely', 'film', 'war', 'people', 'who', 'actors', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections', 'too']",N/A

Stone, a recovering alcoholic, has his own problems: a veteran of the First Persian Gulf War, he never saw any combat worth the name, and suffers a world of guilt he tries to hide by playing the martinet and chasing every skirt he sees. Meanwhile, Montgomery, who has been jilted by his high-school sweetheart (Jena Malone), starts to develop feelings--totally against the rules--for a young military widow (Samantha Morton).Featuring sharp dialogue and brilliant performances (including one by Steve Buscemi as the father of a fallen soldier), ""The Messenger"" is a powerfully moving cinematic experience.",5,"Timeless, powerful, deeply moving.",1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,1627,"['have', 'seldom', 'seen', 'more', 'moving', 'seamless', 'antiwar', 'film', 'Oren', 'Moverman', 'Messenger', 'Iraq', 'War', 'theme', 'absolutely', 'minute', 'portrayal', 'raw', 'grief', 'war', 'echoes', 'human', 'history', 'ways', 'Messenger', 'companion', 'piece', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'effect', 'Iraq', 'War', 'combat', 'soldiers', 'Messenger', 'more', 'effect', 'loved', 'ones', 'waiting', 'home.Ben', 'Foster', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'excellent', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Six', 'Feet', 'even', 'achievements', 'Sgt', 'Will', 'Montgomery', 'Iraq', 'War', 'soldier', 'recovering', 'grievous', 'physical', 'psychic', 'wounds', 'who', 'unwelcome', 'assignment', 'notifying', 'survivors', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'action', 'Making', 'assignment', 'even', 'harder', 'Capt', 'Tony', 'Stone', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'hard-nosed', 'military', 'lifer', 'who', 'Montgomery', 'stick', 'script', 'never', 'touch', 'survivor', 'never', 'express', 'more', 'most', 'perfunctory', 'sympathy', 'Stone', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'own', 'problems', 'veteran', 'First', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'War', 'never', 'saw', 'combat', 'name', 'world', 'guilt', 'hide', 'playing', 'martinet', 'chasing', 'skirt', 'Meanwhile', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'been', 'jilted', 'high-school', 'sweetheart', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'develop', 'feelings', 'totally', 'rules', 'young', 'military', 'widow', 'Samantha', 'Morton', '.Featuring', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'including', 'one', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'father', 'fallen', 'soldier', 'Messenger', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'cinematic', 'experience']",N/A

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have created a divide with all of us. We are split between the people who have been directly affected by the war and those who have not. Staff Sgt. Will Montgomery, played by Ben Foster is just home from Iraq with a medal for heroism.  His superior officer has given him a new job to round out his time and the Army calls the job ""bereavement notification.""  His new officer will be a captain named Tony Stone, played by Woody Harrelson.There are many rules to this new job and communication of the right kind is topmost. You only talk to NOK (next of kin), you never touch the NOK, you deliver the message sometime between 7am and 10pm at night. You provide a set sentence, letting the loved ones know their soldier was killed within the last 24 hours. Someone from the army will be in touch soon to assist. Is there someone we can call for you? You can imagine the responses are mixed, always sorrow and often hysteria. Many do not thank you, but most do. You are the bearer of horrible news. This takes its toll, and the two men drink or not, carouse, and at times talk. Communication is the name of the game. Both men have been through a great deal and have friends and lovers by the wayside.Very few of us understand what our soldiers have been through and there are several examples shown throughout the film. They have become a part of a very select part of society, and most of us will never enter that ring. I finished reading Sebastian Junger's book 'The War' a few days ago. Junger was embedded with an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. He tells the stories of the men and of the War. It is harrowing and exhilarating, and I recommend this book to all.

Especially those who found the film boring. It was rather boring much of the time. The pace is very slow and the subject matter is of the sort that one wonders just how many people who see this film would really want to explore the tragic task of informing next of kin that there son, daughter, wife or husband was killed in battle. I am also not sure why some people are comparing the film to Hurt Locker, which was a film completely removed and totally not at all like this one what so ever. This is not a war film at all. There is no violence in this film except one fist fight which we really never see. This film is more about how two military officers handle the task of informing people their loved ones had died in the course of battle. Though Harrelson gave a perfect performance, I don't know that the role here was all that demanding either. Hes certainly very good in the role, but its not a character that a lot is demanded of from an actor. Anyway several times I kept saying under my breath things like ""Damn, their right, this movie is rather dull and uninspiring"". At the same time I was interested enough to keep watching.

Article described the process of preparing body for the burial, shipment of the body to US and the family notification process.  This film focuses on the family notification process.Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster play two soldiers paired up to perform this difficult task of notifying the immediate family about their sons' and daughters' death.  Their seemingly steely faces mask lots of pain both personal and professional that haunts them during the hours when they are alone.  It is amazing to watch these two actors show all the different reactions they see during their duty.  Regardless of family's reactions, each duty leaves a mark on their psyche in a manner that is impossible to describe.Ben Foster steals the show in this film.  His experiences in Iraq, estrangement from his immediate family, disappointment in his long term relationship with his girlfriend and meeting with newly widowed Olivia (Samantha Morton) change him irrevokable in a ways he wants to conduct his duties with the Army and his personal life.

Sorely lacking was recognition for Ben Foster's central performance, which really kept things in perspective. Samantha Morton's performance was recognized by a few. This is a riveting account of some guys who are given an unpleasant job, notifying families of the death of a family member.

While I know little of current military casualty notification procedures, over-all this movie resonates with my own past as a Marine Corps infantry officer (40 years ago) and I found several things compelling:1)  America does not see enough of the down side of war.  From 935 documented lies by the Bush-Cheney Administration to stark ignorance and corruption as the Obama-Biden Administration sells out to the military-intelligence-industrial pork complex, to the absolute and utterly immoral concealment from the public of the actual number of amputees including many many multiple amputees and the rising number of suicides, I find the disconnect between the public and reality to be catastrophic.2)  For me, these two characters are portrayed superbly, in detail.  In my own life as a former spy we were obscenely proud of having the highest rates of alcoholism, adultery, divorce, and suicide in the US Government, and I have 19 professional suicides and 1 personal suicide in my life to date.  The depth of the pain felt by those who survive was well-portrayed here.3)  The humanity of the protagonist and of the surviving widow, and the nuances of how that developed, were fully developed and expertly acted.  This movie held my attention in detail for the duration.With a tip of the hat to Richard (first comment, recommend reading), here is a tight recommendation that comes closer than my own:Taking ChanceSee also:We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)Gardens of StoneHamburger HillApocalypse NowLord of War (Widescreen)",5,Worthy of Serious Viewers,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,1712,"['take', 'great', 'seriousness', 'critical', 'reviews', 'balance', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'favor', 'five', 'stars', 'enthusiastic', 'recommendation', 'movie', 'actors', 'know', 'little', 'current', 'military', 'casualty', 'notification', 'procedures', 'over-all', 'movie', 'own', 'past', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'infantry', 'officer', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'several', 'things', 'compelling:1', 'America', 'not', 'see', 'enough', 'down', 'side', 'war', '935', 'documented', 'lies', 'Bush-Cheney', 'Administration', 'stark', 'ignorance', 'corruption', 'Obama-Biden', 'Administration', 'out', 'military-intelligence-industrial', 'pork', 'complex', 'absolute', 'utterly', 'immoral', 'concealment', 'public', 'actual', 'number', 'amputees', 'including', 'many', 'many', 'multiple', 'amputees', 'rising', 'number', 'suicides', 'find', 'disconnect', 'public', 'reality', 'be', 'catastrophic.2', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'superbly', 'detail', 'own', 'life', 'former', 'spy', 'were', 'obscenely', 'proud', 'having', 'highest', 'rates', 'alcoholism', 'adultery', 'divorce', 'suicide', 'US', 'Government', 'have', '19', 'professional', 'suicides', '1', 'personal', 'suicide', 'life', 'date', 'depth', 'pain', 'felt', 'who', 'survive', 'was', 'well-portrayed', 'here.3', 'humanity', 'protagonist', 'surviving', 'widow', 'nuances', 'how', 'developed', 'were', 'fully', 'developed', 'expertly', 'acted', 'movie', 'held', 'attention', 'detail', 'duration.With', 'tip', 'hat', 'Richard', 'first', 'comment', 'recommend', 'reading', 'here', 'tight', 'recommendation', 'closer', 'own', 'Taking', 'ChanceSee', 'also', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Gardens', 'StoneHamburger', 'HillApocalypse', 'NowLord', 'War', 'Widescreen']",N/A
1328262,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0036RPM8Y,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 7]","You think your job`s bad?  Imagine being Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster), whose duty it is to deliver death notices to the families and loved ones of soldiers killed in action.  With just three months of active duty left before he's honorably discharged from the service, this decorated war hero has been placed under the tutelage of Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), who's been doing this sort of thing for so long now that it has become almost - but not quite - routine.  Things become complicated, however, when Will becomes romantically attracted to Olivia Pitterson (Samantha Morgan), one of the young widows to whom he relates the shattering news.  But the real focus is on the conflict and uneasy friendship between the by-the-book, struggling alcoholic Stone, who harbors a certain degree of guilt for never having actually served in battle, and the moody, sensitive, and slightly shell-shocked Will who's seen more blood-soaked action than he cares to think about.  Yet, neither is a stereotype, for each is a complex individual dealing in his own way with the traumatizing effects of war - be it on the home front or on the field of battle.""Less is more"" is the defining principle of ""The Messenger,"" a vivid and powerful movie that understands that there is often more drama in what is left unsaid than what is actually spoken.  Everything that occurs in the film seems to happen beneath the surface, as each of the characters tries to put up a brave front even when lives and souls are being torn asunder right before their eyes.  Screenwriters Oren Moverman and Alessandro Camon are not afraid to give each scene its due, even if that means letting it play out at great length or having the characters fumble in their efforts to articulate what it is they're trying to say.  The emotions are raw and complex in this film, and Moverman's elegiac direction does full justice to the seriousness of the subject.  He allows his characters the dignity of space, yet is never so detached from them as to render them objects of curiosity or pity.  It's an impressive debut effort for the obviously gifted Moverman.The scenes in which the two men deliver the news to the various loved ones are staged and executed brilliantly, beautifully capturing the manifold ways in which people deal with sudden tragedy.  Particularly effective is Steve Buscemi's devastating cameo turn as a father who can't accept the reality of his son's death and, thus, strikes out at any convenient target as a means of channeling his rage.Foster and Harrelson deliver breathtaking, perfectly calibrated, award-worthy performances, and they are matched every step of the way by a first-rate cast of supporting actors who never resort to grandstanding in the brief moments they appear on screen.The one false note occurs when the two drunk officers crash the wedding party of Will's former girlfriend (played by Jena Malone, the young version of Jodie Foster in ""Contact""), but it is a minor weakness in a film that earns each and every one of the tears it asks its audience to shed.  And for a movie in which death plays such a central role, ""The Messenger"" still manages to affirm that emotional and psychological healing, though a long and painful process, can actually be achieved in the end.Without a doubt, one of 2009's best films.",5,Beautifully observed and realized human drama,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,3334,"['think', 'job', 's', 'bad', 'Imagine', 'being', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Will', 'Montgomery', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'duty', 'deliver', 'death', 'notices', 'families', 'loved', 'ones', 'soldiers', 'killed', 'action', 'just', 'three', 'months', 'active', 'duty', 'left', 'honorably', 'discharged', 'service', 'decorated', 'war', 'hero', 'been', 'placed', 'tutelage', 'Captain', 'Tony', 'Stone', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'sort', 'thing', 'so', 'long', 'now', 'become', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'routine', 'become', 'complicated', 'however', 'when', 'Will', 'romantically', 'attracted', 'Olivia', 'Pitterson', 'Samantha', 'Morgan', 'one', 'young', 'widows', 'whom', 'shattering', 'news', 'real', 'focus', 'conflict', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'by-the-book', 'struggling', 'alcoholic', 'Stone', 'who', 'certain', 'degree', 'guilt', 'never', 'having', 'actually', 'served', 'battle', 'moody', 'sensitive', 'slightly', 'shell-shocked', 'Will', 'who', 'seen', 'more', 'blood-soaked', 'action', 'think', 'stereotype', 'complex', 'individual', 'dealing', 'own', 'way', 'traumatizing', 'effects', 'war', 'be', 'home', 'front', 'field', 'battle', 'Less', 'more', 'defining', 'principle', 'Messenger', 'vivid', 'powerful', 'movie', 'often', 'more', 'drama', 'what', 'left', 'unsaid', 'what', 'actually', 'spoken', 'Everything', 'film', 'happen', 'surface', 'characters', 'put', 'up', 'brave', 'front', 'even', 'when', 'lives', 'souls', 'are', 'being', 'torn', 'asunder', 'right', 'eyes', 'Screenwriters', 'Oren', 'Moverman', 'Alessandro', 'Camon', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'give', 'scene', 'due', 'even', 'letting', 'play', 'out', 'great', 'length', 'having', 'characters', 'fumble', 'efforts', 'articulate', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'say', 'emotions', 'are', 'raw', 'complex', 'film', 'Moverman', 'elegiac', 'direction', 'full', 'justice', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'characters', 'dignity', 'space', 'never', 'so', 'detached', 'render', 'objects', 'curiosity', 'pity', 'impressive', 'debut', 'effort', 'obviously', 'gifted', 'Moverman.The', 'scenes', 'two', 'men', 'news', 'various', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'staged', 'executed', 'brilliantly', 'beautifully', 'capturing', 'manifold', 'ways', 'people', 'deal', 'sudden', 'tragedy', 'Particularly', 'effective', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'devastating', 'cameo', 'turn', 'father', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'reality', 'son', 'death', 'thus', 'strikes', 'out', 'convenient', 'target', 'means', 'channeling', 'rage.Foster', 'Harrelson', 'deliver', 'breathtaking', 'perfectly', 'calibrated', 'award-worthy', 'performances', 'are', 'matched', 'step', 'way', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'never', 'resort', 'grandstanding', 'brief', 'moments', 'appear', 'screen.The', 'one', 'false', 'note', 'when', 'two', 'drunk', 'officers', 'crash', 'wedding', 'party', 'Will', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'young', 'version', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Contact', 'minor', 'weakness', 'film', 'one', 'tears', 'audience', 'shed', 'movie', 'death', 'plays', 'central', 'role', 'Messenger', 'still', 'affirm', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'healing', 'long', 'painful', 'process', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'achieved', 'end.Without', 'doubt', 'one', '2009', 'best', 'films']",N/A

With all of the films out there today about the war I liked this second to The Hurt Locker.",4,Must see!,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,376,"['am', 'not', 'Ben', 'Foster', 'fan', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'changed', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'film', 'officers', 'charge', 'notification', 'next', 'kin', 'deaths', 'Solders', 'was', 'sad', 'moving', 'times', 'funny', 'thanks', 'Harrelson', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'war', 'liked', 'second', 'Hurt', 'Locker']",N/A

Such a job is not entrusted to just anyone in the military--you have to undergo significant training before you're assigned to such a specialized unit. That's why it's hard to believe that Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) would be thrust into the job when he only has three months of enlistment time left. What's more, would the Sergeant have been chosen since he's only recently come back from Iraq and may have been traumatized there? As for his training, his commanding officer, Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson), merely throws a training manual in his lap and expects him to learn the job as they go along.To confess, I'm a bit biased against movies such as 'The Messenger' because I find characters who like themselves to be vastly more compelling and believable than those who don't. In general, characters who don't like themselves are dull and rarely add to the dramatic flow of the narrative (can you imagine a sad-sack Tony Soprano ever capturing the public's imagination?). The strategy of the Messenger's scenarists is to start us off with the two angst-ridden soldiers, Montgomery and Stone, and eventually show how they redeem themselves by overcoming their depressing background and circumstances.Montgomery is basically a putz who can't accept the fact that his former girlfriend has dumped him and is now engaged to someone else (how many sad-sack soldiers do you know who would actually show up at an ex-girlfriend's wedding intoxicated and wearing unwashed military fatigues?). The implication of course is that somehow, due to being traumatized in Iraq, he would end up acting that way. The contrived wedding scene is designed to show Montgomery at his lowest moment--after acting in such a boorish manner, he can now redeem himself by lending a helping hand to Olivia (Samantha Morton), the widow who he recently notified that her husband had been killed in action.Similarly, Captain Stone also has self-esteem issues. On the surface, his by-the-book demeanor masks a deep self-hatred. This is manifested in his constant skirt-chasing and avoidance of any meaningful relationships with women. The basic question arises: would the Military actually have put someone like Captain Stone in charge of an Army Casualty Notification Unit (i.e. someone so broken and negative?). I would suggest that such a negative character is a complete exaggeration anyway, designed merely to create dramatic scenarios where none would exist truly in reality. But even if such a character existed, he would probably be the last chosen by the military to head a Casualty Notification Unit.It takes a good deal of time before the central conflict comes to a head between Stone and Montgomery. And that is basically Montgomery believes in being a little more sensitive when notifying the next of kin as opposed to Stone who wants to follow 'procedures'. That's about the essence of the conflict between the two principals and when they finally confront each other, it's not much of a payoff. The sub-plot involves Montgomery trying to start things up with Olivia--his decision to not make the moves on her is designed to show that he's a 'good guy' after all and through his efforts to help her, shows that he's attained a measure of redemption.The Messenger also consists of various scenes in which the next of kin are notified of the deaths of their loved one's. Given the variety of the people we meet, it's probably the most interesting aspect of the film. Steve Buscemi's performance is probably the most notable (for better or worse) of these characters, where he strikes Montgomery after being notified about the death of his son, and later offers a rather predictable apology.I've read that the men and women who perform the job of the Casualty Notification Units are dedicated, trained professionals who by the nature of their employment, must set an example by living lives of great integrity (unlike the two troubled malcontents in 'The Messenger'). The contrived characters of 'The Messenger' do nothing to enhance the reputation of these specialized units; rather, their opposition feels artificial, contrived, all part of a plot artifice that calls for the type of conflict one might expect to see in the movies but never in real life. While I have no doubt, 'The Messenger' was meticulously researched as to how these Notification units operate, it still feels like it was written by an outsider. 'The Messenger' might have gotten many of its 'facts' right, but unfortunately I could not believe I was watching a story about real people.",2,Contrived tale of Army Casualty Notification
