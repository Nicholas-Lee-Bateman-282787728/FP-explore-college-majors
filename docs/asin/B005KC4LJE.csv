1463721,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005KC4LJE,A kids review,"[2, 4]","Here's an intriguing film that got a lot of people talking earlier in the year when it premiered at Sundance back in January. Written by, directed by, and starring Evan Glodell, Bellflower is that rare beast of a film that seems propelled by its own manic energy and eccentric outrageousness. The story follows two friends who mod old cars, Mad Max style, and build flamethrowers, until one of them falls in love with a girl and they all embark on a dark, nihilistic journey together. A couple things to note here: Glodell, a bit of gearhead himself, not only built and modified the cars featured in the film, he also crafted the flamethrower and pieced together the camera used to film the movie out of vintage camera parts and Russian lenses. Filmed on a tiny budget, Bellflower is one of those very independent films that comes around every once in a while and impresses me with its ambition and audacity. It might signal the arrival of a unique new talent, and one can only wonder what he might accomplish with a bigger budget.",3,Bellflower,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1031,"['Here', 'intriguing', 'film', 'got', 'lot', 'people', 'talking', 'earlier', 'year', 'when', 'premiered', 'Sundance', 'back', 'January', 'Written', 'directed', 'starring', 'Evan', 'Glodell', 'Bellflower', 'rare', 'beast', 'film', 'propelled', 'own', 'manic', 'energy', 'eccentric', 'outrageousness', 'story', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'mod', 'old', 'cars', 'Mad', 'Max', 'style', 'build', 'flamethrowers', 'one', 'love', 'girl', 'embark', 'dark', 'nihilistic', 'journey', 'together', 'couple', 'things', 'note', 'here', 'Glodell', 'bit', 'gearhead', 'not', 'only', 'built', 'modified', 'cars', 'featured', 'film', 'also', 'crafted', 'flamethrower', 'pieced', 'together', 'camera', 'used', 'film', 'movie', 'vintage', 'camera', 'parts', 'Russian', 'lenses', 'Filmed', 'tiny', 'budget', 'Bellflower', 'one', 'very', 'independent', 'films', 'around', 'once', 'while', 'ambition', 'audacity', 'might', 'signal', 'arrival', 'unique', 'new', 'talent', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'accomplish', 'bigger', 'budget']",N/A

1463723,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005KC4LJE,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Bellfower is one movie where you do NOT want to turn it off halfway through and assume the rest of the storyline is going to maintain the same carefree teenage relationship-type drama that takes up the first half.  Trust me, the second half is MUCH more suspenseful.  It's about a group of teenage guys that have an interest in creating really outrageous flamethrowers.  These throwers shoot a flame that must be about 30-feet long!  Never seen one so incredible!Anyway, that's only one aspect of the film.  One of the boys meets a girl in a bar and they seemingly hit off a picture perfect relationship right away.  They travel to Texas together, go on dates, go out to dinner, trades a car for a motorcycle, etc.  This is when you might be tempted to turn the movie off and call it a disappointment, but I can't stress enough how much of a mistake that would be.As soon as the girl is seen cheating by the boyfriend and the boy gets into an accident, well let's just say, he now has nothing but vengeance on his mind.  He occupies his days in bed being really angry and bitter all the while dealing with the facial scars connected to the accident and the ex-girlfriend responsible for it, so he makes it his personal mission to make her suffer.  Bet you didn't see THAT one coming, haha.  Simply put, the guy has an attitute problem and feels insulted over how the relationship ends.The best way to describe the second half of Bellflower is total madness.  The one long-haired friend of the ex-girlfriend is SUPER cute!  She plays a really graphic scene later on (that may or may not have actually happened- you'll see what I mean when you watch it) and the flamethrower comes into the picture on one occasion that's related to the storyline, and it's a good one.  Again though, may or may not have really happened.Lots of fighting, violence, revenge, etc. dominate the second half.  So yes, deal with the uninteresting first half and prepare yourself for total chaos during the second half of Bellflower.  You'll feel so rewarded!",4,madness!,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,2033,"['Bellfower', 'one', 'movie', 'where', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', 'turn', 'off', 'halfway', 'assume', 'rest', 'storyline', 'going', 'maintain', 'same', 'carefree', 'teenage', 'relationship-type', 'drama', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'Trust', 'second', 'half', 'MUCH', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'group', 'teenage', 'guys', 'have', 'interest', 'creating', 'really', 'outrageous', 'flamethrowers', 'throwers', 'shoot', 'flame', 'must', 'be', '30-feet', 'long', 'Never', 'seen', 'one', 'so', 'incredible', 'Anyway', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'One', 'boys', 'girl', 'bar', 'seemingly', 'hit', 'off', 'picture', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'right', 'away', 'travel', 'Texas', 'together', 'go', 'dates', 'go', 'out', 'dinner', 'trades', 'car', 'motorcycle', 'etc', 'when', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'turn', 'movie', 'call', 'disappointment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'much', 'mistake', 'would', 'be.As', 'soon', 'girl', 'seen', 'cheating', 'boyfriend', 'boy', 'accident', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'now', 'nothing', 'vengeance', 'mind', 'days', 'bed', 'being', 'really', 'angry', 'bitter', 'while', 'dealing', 'facial', 'scars', 'connected', 'accident', 'ex-girlfriend', 'responsible', 'personal', 'mission', 'make', 'suffer', 'Bet', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'haha', 'Simply', 'put', 'guy', 'attitute', 'problem', 'feels', 'insulted', 'how', 'relationship', 'ends.The', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'second', 'half', 'Bellflower', 'total', 'madness', 'one', 'long-haired', 'friend', 'ex-girlfriend', 'SUPER', 'cute', 'really', 'graphic', 'scene', 'later', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'actually', 'happened-', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'watch', 'flamethrower', 'picture', 'one', 'occasion', 'related', 'storyline', 'good', 'one', 'Again', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'really', 'happened.Lots', 'fighting', 'violence', 'revenge', 'etc', 'dominate', 'second', 'half', 'So', 'yes', 'deal', 'uninteresting', 'first', 'half', 'prepare', 'total', 'chaos', 'second', 'half', 'Bellflower', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'so', 'rewarded']",N/A

I think this is one of those &#34;love it&#34; or &#34;hated it&#34; type of offerings. On one hand, this movie's creation shows great talent by Evan Goodell (wrote & directed & starred) and Joel Hodge (cinematographer) for pulling this off on such a limited budget. As I understand it Goodell even cobbled together his own new type of camera to deliver some of the films more unique visuals.Unfortunately there is always a &#34;second hand&#34;. This is a meandering buddy flick of two &#34;Dudes&#34; (how often can you tolerate hearing that?) preparing for the fall of society and finding love along the way. It eventually devolves into a severely irritating & morose &#34;m&eacute;nage a trios&#34; of incoherency.Along the way these &#34;Dudes&#34; build various creations with which to prosper in the anticipated post apocalyptic world and I have to say that the &#34;Medusa&#34; is one fine set of wheels in the best of the &#34;Mad Max&#34; genre. Evan Goodel took a 1972 Buick Skylark and added internal role bars, internal monitor/ external video surveillance cameras, Public Address system, pneumatic rear suspension adjustment, exhaust tailpipes that throw monster flame & smoke screens, rear bleach injectors to coat the wheels for excellent smoking, screeching, burning &#34;drifts&#34;.....and a CD player.This roaring mobile &#34;Dude&#34; machine is almost worth the price to the see movie alone.

1463725,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B005KC4LJE,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 2]","For a movie shot on pocket change and gas money, ""Bellflower"" succeeds brilliantly.  The filmmakers utilize low-budget locations in a way that makes sense for the movie, and get a great look with digital shooting.  IMDB claims the director made the cameras himself; I can believe it, because the cinematography is creative, unusual and high-quality.  The actors, especially in the first act, come across very naturally and actually act like real human beings.One thing that ""Bellflower"" captures very well is the downside of that ""free-spirited"" girl who captures the imagination and heart of the introverted guy.  She's great, and fun, but a girl who loves to do whatever comes into her head at any given time will sooner than later move on to someone or something more interesting.  However, that's where this movie starts to break down.  It starts off energetic and fun, loses its way in the second act, and doesn't start to come on strong again until the end of the second act.  The characters start to break character, and continuity breaks down, before you start to have an idea as to why.  I knock off two stars primarily for these reasons.The 30-minute ""making of"" featurette is almost better than the movie itself.  It gives you a raw, unvarnished look at what it takes to break into the movie business. The writer/director lives in a garage in conditions barely better than a homeless man.  The team scrounged semi-abandoned office space as a production headquarters that they at times lived in; they barely had money for food; and, after the SXSW debut of the film, they didn't have enough money to get home but for an unsolicited $1000 cash from P Diddy.  What they had was the burning desire to make a movie, and because they were dirt poor and broke they had no option but to succeed.  Young people who dream of hitting it big in Hollywood need to watch this.This is worth a rent, but I would definitely rent it before I bought it.",3,Good for what it is,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,1945,"['movie', 'shot', 'pocket', 'change', 'gas', 'money', 'Bellflower', 'brilliantly', 'filmmakers', 'utilize', 'low-budget', 'locations', 'way', 'sense', 'movie', 'get', 'great', 'look', 'digital', 'shooting', 'IMDB', 'director', 'made', 'cameras', 'can', 'believe', 'cinematography', 'creative', 'unusual', 'high-quality', 'actors', 'especially', 'first', 'act', 'come', 'very', 'naturally', 'actually', 'act', 'real', 'human', 'beings.One', 'thing', 'Bellflower', 'very', 'well', 'downside', 'free-spirited', 'girl', 'who', 'imagination', 'heart', 'introverted', 'guy', 'great', 'fun', 'girl', 'who', 'do', 'head', 'given', 'time', 'will', 'sooner', 'later', 'move', 'someone', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'However', 'where', 'movie', 'break', 'down', 'energetic', 'fun', 'way', 'second', 'act', ""n't"", 'start', 'come', 'strong', 'again', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'characters', 'start', 'break', 'character', 'continuity', 'breaks', 'down', 'start', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'knock', 'off', 'two', 'stars', 'primarily', 'reasons.The', '30-minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'almost', 'better', 'movie', 'raw', 'unvarnished', 'look', 'what', 'break', 'movie', 'business', 'writer/director', 'garage', 'conditions', 'barely', 'better', 'homeless', 'man', 'team', 'scrounged', 'semi-abandoned', 'office', 'space', 'production', 'headquarters', 'times', 'lived', 'barely', 'had', 'money', 'food', 'SXSW', 'debut', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'get', 'home', 'unsolicited', '1000', 'cash', 'P', 'Diddy', 'What', 'had', 'was', 'burning', 'desire', 'make', 'movie', 'were', 'dirt', 'poor', 'broke', 'had', 'option', 'succeed', 'Young', 'people', 'who', 'dream', 'hitting', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'need', 'watch', 'this.This', 'rent', 'would', 'definitely', 'rent', 'bought']",N/A

The dialogue and acting are true to the characters, and the strong buddy element between Woodrow and Aiden was a strong hook that emotionally dealt me into the story.I'm also a huge fan of David Lynch, and which I wouldn't characterize this film as Lynchian, it definitely had the disorienting flavor of a Lynch movie.

The synopsis on the box makes it sound kind of like an out-of-control mix of post-apocalyptic elements (sort of) and David Lynch.  However, I found the movie to be incredibly disappointing.  It turns out it is just a movie about a relationship between two twenty-something hipsters.  The relationship aspect of the film plays out like melodrama involving betrayal and infidelity.  So many movies that have come before it have broadcasted the plot points of this film a thousand times over.  There are no surprises.  The relationship begins, it plays out, aaaannnnd...done.  Having a cool apocalypse car and a flamethrower thrown into the mix do very little to add color to this predictable story.  In fairness, the acting is pretty convincing and the dialogue is decent.  It's just the predictability of the story and the broken promises of ""disturbing violence"" and such that really sink it.  I guess if you're clued in on the plot before you watch it, you may appreciate it more.  I, for one, feel that the movie's packaging completely misrepresented it.  Hats off, though, to Evan Godell, a clearly innovative and ambitious young filmmaker (he helped created the gadgets in the movie, built the cameras to shoot it - at least that's what I heard - and takes a lead role).

1463731,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B005KC4LJE,J. Friday,"[1, 2]","My review will be in two parts. The first part is the spoiler-free version. When I get to the spoiler version I'll put the word SPOILERS in caps for those of you who just want to know what this movie is about.SPOILER-FREE VERSION OF MY REVIEW: This is not an action/adventure movie. The trailer mislead you into thinking so. Virtually all the action in this movie happens in the trailer. This movie is about two loser/slackers and their dream to build a flamethrower and the ultimate Mad Max-inspired muscle car. Woodrow, one of the slackers, falls in love with Milly. They both seem to like each other. But something tears them apart. And Woodrow must contain the rage inside him that threatens to destroy his own life as well as the lives of his loved ones.I liked it. I can relate to the viewpoint of a young, shiftless male going through heartbreak. Those who didn't like it had gripes with the acting; the shaky-cam; the dialogue: there's a lot of ""sweet"", ""awesome"", ""totally awesome"", ""dude"", etc. peppered throughout the dialogue; the slow-pacing; the jumbled storytelling; the ending; and a few other things.Like I said, I can relate to it so I like it. But here's my recommendation. Rent it before buying it. So many people have been disappointed with this flick. I wasn't one of them. But judging from the reviews here and on imdb.com, the disapppointment was pretty huge.SPOILERSThis spoiler-filled part of my review is for those of you who would rather see spoilers than taking the precaution of being one of those reviewers who said, ""I can't believe I wasted 103 minutes of my life watching this movie.""Woodrow and Aiden are shiftless slackers from Wisconsin who movied to Southern California for sun, sand, babes, and booze. Their goal is to build a cool flamethrower and the ultimate Mad-Max inspired muscle car. One night, at a local bar, Woodrow enters a cricket eating contest, where he is soundly beaten by a chick named Milly. Woodrow ends up scoring a date with her the for the next day. On that first date they drive from California to Texas. Why? Because she asked Woodrow to take her to the most disgusting restaurant he can think of.All this is surprising. Milly is carefree, weird, unpredictable, cool, and extremely friendly. She laughs at his jokes, gives free and easy sex, and is interested in him as a lover. But months later, Woodrow's desperate wussiness begins to smother her. In the trailer, Milly says, ""You don't want me to be your girlfriend. Because I'll hurt you."" That's exactly what happens. Woodrow comes home one day to find Milly is screwing some other dude...in his house...on his bed. Woodrow punches the dude twice, but the dude isn't fazed. Milly tries to explain that she's sort of sorry but Woodrow ends up running off in his motorcycle. He doesn't get far because some car smashes him and trashes his bike.After getting out of the hospital, Woodrow and Aiden decide to finish making the car they call ""the Medusa"". But Woodrow is distracted. He ends up sleeping with Courtney, Milly's best friend and a chick who is Aiden's girlfriend...sort of. Courtney loves him. But he can't get over Milly. He goes to her house and burns her things on her front lawn. The guy who ended up screwing Milly gets killed by Aiden. Aiden runs away. Woodrow brutalizes Milly and Courtney kills herself. Afterward, Aiden ends up on the street screaming his head off.But wait, everything in that last paragraph was a dream. Woodrow gets into an accident and leaves the hospital. But everything that happens afterward is his fantasy. That was the part that pissed a lot of people off. So many reviewers were like, ""What? It was all a dream? Total cop-out!""I wish it hadn't all been a dream myself. But still, I liked it. There were some gripes though:1. The dialogue was mainly a bunch of ""dude, sweet, totally, totally awesome,"" kinda stuff. Most of the dialogue was conversational. It wasn't deep or anything.2. The acting was amateurish. When the actors had to display real emotions like anger or fear, they were pretty bad. Many times they looked like they wanted to laugh, as if they were saying, ""Dude, I can't believe I'm in a movie.""3. The lenses were dirty. During takes, filmmakers will generally clean their lenses to get the dust, hairs, and grimes off the lenses. Much of the time the director kept it there on purpose, causing some haters of this flick to label him an idiot.4. The shaky-cam was annoying.5. The rape scene disturbed some despite the fact that it was only 10 seconds. But it wasn't rape for exploitation. It was showing true emotions of a heartbroken man.There is other stuff I wanna say but I'll stop now. If you wanna know more about this flick then go read more reviews on imdb.com. I only recommend renting this movie. Rent it first. If you like it then buy it afterward.",4,Rent it first!,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,4837,"['review', 'will', 'be', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'spoiler-free', 'version', 'When', 'get', 'spoiler', 'version', ""'ll"", 'put', 'word', 'SPOILERS', 'caps', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'about.SPOILER-FREE', 'VERSION', 'OF', 'MY', 'REVIEW', 'not', 'action/adventure', 'movie', 'trailer', 'mislead', 'thinking', 'so', 'Virtually', 'action', 'movie', 'trailer', 'movie', 'two', 'loser/slackers', 'dream', 'build', 'flamethrower', 'ultimate', 'Mad', 'Max-inspired', 'muscle', 'car', 'Woodrow', 'one', 'slackers', 'love', 'Milly', 'seem', 'like', 'other', 'something', 'tears', 'apart', 'Woodrow', 'must', 'contain', 'rage', 'destroy', 'own', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'lives', 'loved', 'ones.I', 'liked', 'can', 'relate', 'viewpoint', 'young', 'shiftless', 'male', 'going', 'heartbreak', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'had', 'gripes', 'acting', 'shaky-cam', 'dialogue', 'lot', 'sweet', 'awesome', 'totally', 'awesome', 'dude', 'etc', 'peppered', 'dialogue', 'slow-pacing', 'jumbled', 'storytelling', 'ending', 'few', 'other', 'things.Like', 'said', 'can', 'relate', 'so', 'like', 'here', 'recommendation', 'Rent', 'buying', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'judging', 'reviews', 'here', 'imdb.com', 'disapppointment', 'was', 'pretty', 'huge.SPOILERSThis', 'spoiler-filled', 'part', 'review', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'spoilers', 'taking', 'precaution', 'being', 'one', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'wasted', '103', 'minutes', 'life', 'watching', 'movie', 'Woodrow', 'Aiden', 'are', 'shiftless', 'slackers', 'Wisconsin', 'who', 'movied', 'Southern', 'California', 'sun', 'sand', 'babes', 'booze', 'goal', 'build', 'cool', 'flamethrower', 'ultimate', 'Mad-Max', 'inspired', 'muscle', 'car', 'One', 'night', 'local', 'bar', 'Woodrow', 'cricket', 'eating', 'contest', 'where', 'soundly', 'beaten', 'chick', 'named', 'Milly', 'Woodrow', 'up', 'scoring', 'date', 'next', 'day', 'first', 'date', 'drive', 'California', 'Texas', 'Why', 'asked', 'Woodrow', 'take', 'most', 'disgusting', 'restaurant', 'can', 'think', 'surprising', 'Milly', 'carefree', 'weird', 'unpredictable', 'cool', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'jokes', 'free', 'easy', 'sex', 'interested', 'lover', 'months', 'later', 'Woodrow', 'desperate', 'wussiness', 'smother', 'trailer', 'Milly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'girlfriend', ""'ll"", 'hurt', 'exactly', 'what', 'Woodrow', 'home', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'Milly', 'screwing', 'other', 'dude', 'house', 'bed', 'Woodrow', 'dude', 'twice', 'dude', ""n't"", 'fazed', 'Milly', 'explain', 'sort', 'sorry', 'Woodrow', 'up', 'running', 'off', 'motorcycle', ""n't"", 'get', 'far', 'car', 'smashes', 'trashes', 'bike.After', 'getting', 'hospital', 'Woodrow', 'Aiden', 'decide', 'finish', 'making', 'car', 'call', 'Medusa', 'Woodrow', 'distracted', 'up', 'sleeping', 'Courtney', 'Milly', 'best', 'friend', 'chick', 'who', 'Aiden', 'girlfriend', 'sort', 'Courtney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Milly', 'house', 'things', 'front', 'lawn', 'guy', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'screwing', 'Milly', 'killed', 'Aiden', 'Aiden', 'away', 'Woodrow', 'Milly', 'Courtney', 'Afterward', 'Aiden', 'up', 'street', 'screaming', 'head', 'off.But', 'wait', 'everything', 'last', 'paragraph', 'was', 'dream', 'Woodrow', 'accident', 'hospital', 'everything', 'afterward', 'fantasy', 'was', 'part', 'pissed', 'lot', 'people', 'So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'were', 'What', 'was', 'dream', 'Total', 'cop-out', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'all', 'been', 'dream', 'still', 'liked', 'were', 'gripes', 'though:1', 'dialogue', 'was', 'mainly', 'bunch', 'dude', 'sweet', 'totally', 'totally', 'awesome', 'stuff', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'was', 'conversational', 'was', ""n't"", 'deep', 'anything.2', 'acting', 'was', 'amateurish', 'When', 'actors', 'had', 'display', 'real', 'emotions', 'anger', 'fear', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Many', 'times', 'looked', 'wanted', 'laugh', 'were', 'saying', 'Dude', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'movie.', '3', 'lenses', 'were', 'dirty', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'generally', 'clean', 'lenses', 'get', 'dust', 'hairs', 'grimes', 'off', 'lenses', 'Much', 'time', 'director', 'kept', 'purpose', 'causing', 'haters', 'flick', 'label', 'idiot.4', 'shaky-cam', 'was', 'annoying.5', 'rape', 'scene', 'disturbed', 'fact', 'was', 'only', '10', 'seconds', 'was', ""n't"", 'rape', 'exploitation', 'was', 'showing', 'true', 'emotions', 'heartbroken', 'man.There', 'other', 'stuff', 'wan', 'na', 'say', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'now', 'wan', 'know', 'more', 'flick', 'then', 'go', 'read', 'more', 'reviews', 'imdb.com', 'only', 'recommend', 'renting', 'movie', 'Rent', 'first', 'like', 'then', 'buy', 'afterward']",N/A

Decent acting, great shots and atmosphere and fun to see the flamey, homegrown destructive gadgets & vehicles. I have to give it up, some serious indy spirit of film-making, inspired and driven (sorry).BUT, I will say, the overall plot of the movie left me a bit stupified and numbed to the characters. No one comes out truly likeable, and seems to only reinforce to the overall vacuousness of hipster Brooklynite ""culture"", which, in its roots consist of spoiled art-hipster-bros bumming Williamsburg. Fortunately, the movie is not set in Brooklyn and comes clean of some that irony streak which makes hipsterdom so detestable. The cognitive-dissonance experienced by the film's key players seems contagious and moves easily to the viewership (I watched it in a group). May be more hipster irony about divested existence brought on by a jaded affect and disgruntled view of modern-day society, hm?I admire the director's ""jack of all trades"" vision and it's oddly beautiful at moments despite its ""microcosmic apocalypse"", ""appetite for destruction"" narratives. A little more investment to the character development and may be a story arc that doesn't leave you remote, disgusted with humanity, but I have to wonder if that was part of the point. May be my perceptions failed me or may be I have to give it another go. And that's the thing; I don't really want to--I don't want to see this movie again.

1463735,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005KC4LJE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 8]","&lt;strong>Bellflower&lt;/strong> (Evan Glodell, 2011)I grant you, I have not yet seen many films made in 2011 (nine, according to my spreadsheet) and most of those have ranged from the aggressively mediocre to the outrageously awful (if you value your sanity, avoid &lt;em>2012: Zombie Apocalypse&lt;/em> at all costs), and so I probably have no business opining on the best, worst, or anything else of 2011. And yet I will still tell you: when the dust settles, say five years from now when I have fifty or sixty movies made in 2011 under my belt, &lt;em>Bellflower&lt;/em>, if it is not still perched atop my Best of 2011 list, is pretty much guarantted to still be somewhere in the top three. It's that good. Which is not to say it doesn't have its flaws, but it's still that good.Plot: two slackers, Woodrow (director Glodell in his first feature appearance) and Aiden (Tyler Dawson, also in his first feature appearance), are obsessed with &lt;em>The Road Warrior&lt;/em>, spending their days building flamethrowers and drawing concept art for their version of Medusa, Mel Gibson's car in the film. Life is going along just peachy unil Woodrow meets Milly (Jessie Wiseman in her first screen appearance), an outgoing, vivacious woman who he finds himself in a relationship with very quickly. This is the beginning of the strain on Woodrow and Aiden's friendship; the story, which develops an episodic feel later on, details the way the relationships between Woodrow, Aiden, and Milly's circle of friends change as the events that start from Woodrow and Milly's impulsive decision to drive to Texas on their first date escalate.First off: this fim was criminally mismarketed as a sci-fi feature. One could conceivably call it fantasy, if you turn your head and squint right, but what it really is is a romantic drama with a kind of gritty realism that stems from Glodell's being realistic about his minuscule budget and embracing it in order to make his film look as polished and professional as possible. Second: these characters exist. That is the film's strongest point; you can look at at least one of these characters and say ""I know that person"" without any of the leaps or elisions necessary with most films given the two-dimensionality of most Hollywood characters (and the emotional shortcuts used to build them, as I've detailed in numerous previous reviews). The soundtrack is perfect, the cinematography is almost perfect (Glodell and Dawson hand-built the cameras used in the making of the movie, so had complete control over the film's look, and they knew what they were doing), Glodell's script is fantastic for about eighty of the movie's one hundred seven minutes.Then comes the movie's biggest downfall: there's a series of what may or may not be fantasy or dream sequences, in some cases possibly nestled inside one another. It's a very, very difficult technique to pull off, and I'm not sure I've ever seen it successfully done in a movie; the closest media analogue I can come to what I think Glodell was trying to do in the last half-hour of this film is Catherynne Valente's novel &lt;em>In the Night Garden&lt;/em>, with its stories-inside-stories-inside-stories structure. Glodell doesn't quite have enough of a handle on it, though it's impossible to say whether it's his inexperience as a filmmaker, his script, continuity issues, or any number of other factors contributed to the problems here. On the up side, it does keep people talking about the film, because they're wondering what the hell was going on there. On the downside, they're still talking about it, in the main, because they hated the last half-hour so much. I didn't; it seemed to me that if you paid enough attention you could work out which parts were Woodrow's revenge fantasies/wishes for things to go back to the way they were at the beginning of the story (that is, after all, the meaning of the opening scene, which gives us a reverse montage of key scenes from the movie) and which parts really happened--if any of them did. But you do have to pay attention, kind of in the same way you do in the final montage of &lt;em>Poetry&lt;/em>. And if you had told me before I watched &lt;em>Bellflower&lt;/em>, when I thought pretty much the same as everyone else about it, that I would be comparing it to &lt;em>Poetry&lt;/em> with a straight face in my review, I'd have probably laughed at you... but at heart, the two of them are very much of a piece.In short, a micro-budget film that doesn't come off feeling like a microbudget film. I expect great things from a lot of folks involved in this movie (especially Jessie Wiseman, whose performance is fearless, brazen, and occasionally heartbreaking). A lot of people ended up hating it because they thought they were getting something they didn't. Don't be that guy. Go into this movie with no expectations and be wowed by it. ****",4,Not at all what it was marketed to be--much better than that.,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,4884,"['lt', 'strong', '>',

One day Woodrow meets a girl named Milly (Jessie Wiseman) while joining in a cricket eating contest. In spite of Milly's warning that she will hurt him, Woodrow starts dating her until the day when, as the film's subtitle says, ""All Things End.""Maybe I should not tell you much about the film's second half, where you will see some terrible events that might or might not happen. All I can say is that, compared to the first part, of which content is raw and real, the second part is unnecessarily confusing. This part could be much better with a simpler narrative or tighter editing.Despite the real flame-throwers used in the film, ""Bellflower"" is a drama. Made on a budget of 17,000 dollars, this would be easily characterized as ""one-of-a-kind"" film. The film's orange-tinted photography is unique, to be sure, and so is the black ""Medusa"" car, but the film's story is at its heart a pretty orthodox one, about friendship between males with nowhere to go. If Lars von Trier directed a bromance, perhaps it would be something like ""Bellflower.""""Bellflower"" has distinctive visual qualities that alone are worth watching, but its narrative needs improvement.",3,"It's Unique, Either You Love it or Hate it",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,1383,"['Woodrow', 'Evan', 'Glodell', 'who', 'also', 'directs', 'Aiden', 'Tyler', 'Dawson', 'are', 'weapon-making', 'slackers', 'North', 'Hollywood', 'avid', 'fans', 'post-apocalyptic', 'action', 'film', 'Mad', 'Max', '2', 'charismatic', 'villain', 'Humungus', 'One', 'day', 'Woodrow', 'girl', 'named', 'Milly', 'Jessie', 'Wiseman', 'joining', 'cricket', 'eating', 'contest', 'spite', 'Milly', 'warning', 'will', 'hurt', 'Woodrow', 'dating', 'day', 'when', 'film', 'subtitle', 'Things', 'End', 'Maybe', 'should', 'not', 'tell', 'much', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'will', 'see', 'terrible', 'events', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'happen', 'can', 'say', 'compared', 'first', 'part', 'content', 'raw', 'real', 'second', 'part', 'unnecessarily', 'confusing', 'part', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'simpler', 'narrative', 'tighter', 'real', 'flame-throwers', 'used', 'film', 'Bellflower', 'drama', 'Made', 'budget', '17,000', 'dollars', 'would', 'be', 'easily', 'characterized', 'one-of-a-kind', 'film', 'film', 'orange-tinted', 'photography', 'unique', 'be', 'sure', 'so', 'black', 'Medusa', 'car', 'film', 'story', 'heart', 'pretty', 'orthodox', 'one', 'friendship', 'males', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'directed', 'bromance', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'Bellflower', 'Bellflower', 'distinctive', 'visual', 'qualities', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'narrative', 'needs', 'improvement']",N/A
1463737,AEE52GO98PFOL,B005KC4LJE,Tyr Shadowblade (TM),"[0, 1]","I heard absolutely nothing about this low budget indie film, and from looking at the box it really didn't sound like my kind of film at all . . . in fact, at first glance it really seemed like some sort of lame derivative hipster knockoff with very little going for it at all . . . then, out of curiosity, I finally watched it.  It was NOTHING AT ALL LIKE I EXPECTED.  Wow.  This was a truly GREAT movie in so many ways.The biggest parts of this film are supposedly the car and the homebuilt flamethrower.  I've been around custom cars all my life and know a few guys who own flamethrowers, so that really was not that big a deal to me, although both were pretty damned cool.  Flamethrowers are a lot more temperamental than one might think, and the one they built was impressive.  Although the car and flamethrower are cool, watch this film for the acting and writing.  Brilliantly executed.Early into this film, I disliked the main characters -- a pair of alcoholic slackers and a bipolar girl they meet in a pub -- but after 20 minutes they started to grow on me as their personalities unfolded and they became more humanized -- a half hour into it things start to get pretty intense -- then it culminates in a hallucinatory mind-warp that will leave you speechless.  This film will never have mass appeal because too many people just won't be able to understand and appreciate it, but it is destined to remain a cult classic with a dedicated following.  The cast obviously put everything they had into this, and the story is poignant and moving.  The flaws are few, minor, and hardly worth mentioning . . . this was a brilliant film and I recommend it highly.",5,Very surprised by this unknown indie masterpiece.,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1663,"['heard', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'film', 'looking', 'box', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'kind', 'film', 'fact', 'first', 'glance', 'really', 'seemed', 'sort', 'lame', 'derivative', 'hipster', 'knockoff', 'very', 'little', 'going', 'then', 'curiosity', 'finally', 'watched', 'was', 'NOTHING', 'AT', 'ALL', 'LIKE', 'EXPECTED', 'Wow', 'was', 'truly', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'ways.The', 'biggest', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'supposedly', 'car', 'homebuilt', 'flamethrower', ""'ve"", 'been', 'custom', 'cars', 'life', 'know', 'few', 'guys', 'who', 'own', 'flamethrowers', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'were', 'pretty', 'damned', 'cool', 'Flamethrowers', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'temperamental', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'one', 'built', 'was', 'impressive', 'car', 'flamethrower', 'are', 'cool', 'watch', 'film', 'acting', 'writing', 'Brilliantly', 'executed.Early', 'film', 'disliked', 'main', 'characters', 'pair', 'alcoholic', 'slackers', 'bipolar', 'girl', 'meet', 'pub', '20', 'minutes', 'started', 'grow', 'personalities', 'unfolded', 'became', 'more', 'humanized', 'half', 'hour', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'pretty', 'intense', 'then', 'hallucinatory', 'mind-warp', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'mass', 'appeal', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'destined', 'remain', 'cult', 'classic', 'dedicated', 'following', 'cast', 'obviously', 'put', 'everything', 'had', 'story', 'poignant', 'moving', 'flaws', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'hardly', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'was', 'brilliant', 'film', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

In fact, depending on one's taste, it might nob be interesting at all. Some of one's response to it would depend on one's tolerance for the life-style of the characters, and presumably tha auteur.
