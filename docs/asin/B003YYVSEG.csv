This is the place where Molly meets Trip, her colleague from her studies in 19th century literature. Molly comes to the bar with her boyfriend Greg who has just arrived in NYC, Trip brings his lesbian flat-mate Bridget, as we soon learn he has also a girl-friend, ballet-dancer Chloe. They are all in their early twenties but the film doesn't offer much information on what they do apart from meeting friends and sharing drinks.As it turns out Bridget and Molly share keen interest in 19th century novel - Wuthering Heights is their apparent favourite - and they hit it off immediately. The story line concentrates on the two girls - Molly learns to accept the fact that she is a lesbian, Bridget changes from a woman-eating out-and-proud lesbian into a possible girl-friend material. Neither change comes easy but fortunately both girls realise on time what they are about to lose if they stick to their former selves - Molly marrying Greg (who is sadly cast aside and learns rather late what is going on behind his back) and Bridget devouring more and more women. The other story line - Trip losing and winning back (and losing again) Chloe is far less prominent although offers some more laughs.There are some pros and cons, as usual with GLBT productions - pros are decent screenplay and acting, a major con for me was the quality of sound. Maybe it's just me but I found it quite difficult to follow dialogues which took place in the bar.",4,Romantic comedy with a bit of twist,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1572,"['Four-Faced', 'Liar', 'trendy', 'gay-friendly', 'bar', 'part', 'New', 'York', 'City', ""n't"", 'look', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'movies', 'place', 'where', 'Molly', 'Trip', 'colleague', 'studies', '19th', 'century', 'literature', 'Molly', 'bar', 'boyfriend', 'Greg', 'who', 'just', 'arrived', 'NYC', 'Trip', 'lesbian', 'flat-mate', 'Bridget', 'soon', 'learn', 'also', 'girl-friend', 'ballet-dancer', 'Chloe', 'are', 'early', 'twenties', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'information', 'what', 'do', 'apart', 'meeting', 'friends', 'sharing', 'drinks.As', 'out', 'Bridget', 'Molly', 'share', 'keen', 'interest', '19th', 'century', 'novel', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'apparent', 'favourite', 'hit', 'off', 'immediately', 'story', 'line', 'two', 'girls', 'Molly', 'accept', 'fact', 'lesbian', 'Bridget', 'changes', 'woman-eating', 'out-and-proud', 'lesbian', 'possible', 'girl-friend', 'material', 'change', 'easy', 'fortunately', 'girls', 'realise', 'time', 'what', 'are', 'lose', 'stick', 'former', 'selves', 'Molly', 'marrying', 'Greg', 'who', 'sadly', 'cast', 'aside', 'rather', 'late', 'what', 'going', 'back', 'Bridget', 'devouring', 'more', 'more', 'women', 'other', 'story', 'line', 'Trip', 'losing', 'winning', 'back', 'losing', 'again', 'Chloe', 'far', 'less', 'prominent', 'more', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'usual', 'GLBT', 'productions', 'pros', 'are', 'decent', 'screenplay', 'acting', 'major', 'con', 'was', 'quality', 'sound', 'just', 'found', 'quite', 'difficult', 'follow', 'dialogues', 'took', 'place', 'bar']",N/A

While Trip and Greg bond over sports, Molly and Bridget discover a mutual love of literature.When Molly discovers that Bridget is a lesbian, she becomes even more intrigued. After a big fight with Greg, the natural place to go seems to be Bridget's place. Over long conversations and sharing a bed (platonically of course), Molly falls in love with Bridget. In the end, she must choose between a dull life with Greg or a passionate, but possibly tumultuous life with Bridget.The Four-Faced Liar is a romantic comedy/drama by director Jacob Chase that looks at life, choices and relationships, which are not always easy or straightforward.Emily Peck aptly portrays Molly, a woman whose life lacks the passion she so desires and the disorientation she feels when she suddenly realizes that she is in love with another woman.Chris AldersonAuthor of the 2013 Lesbian Film Guide",3,"Love, Life and NYC...",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1172,"['Molly', 'Emily', 'Peck', 'New', 'York', 'everything', 'boyfriend', 'Greg', 'Daniel', 'Carlisle', 'just', 'moved', 'city', 'be', 'One', 'night', 'local', 'pub', 'Four-Faced', 'Liar', 'meet', 'friends', 'Trip', 'Todd', 'Kubrak', 'girlfriend', 'Chloe', 'Liz', 'Osborn', 'flat', 'mate', 'Bridget', 'Marja', 'Lewis', 'Ryan', 'Trip', 'Greg', 'bond', 'sports', 'Molly', 'Bridget', 'discover', 'mutual', 'love', 'literature.When', 'Molly', 'Bridget', 'lesbian', 'even', 'more', 'intrigued', 'big', 'fight', 'Greg', 'natural', 'place', 'go', 'be', 'Bridget', 'place', 'long', 'conversations', 'sharing', 'bed', 'platonically', 'course', 'Molly', 'love', 'Bridget', 'end', 'must', 'choose', 'dull', 'life', 'Greg', 'passionate', 'possibly', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'Bridget.The', 'Four-Faced', 'Liar', 'romantic', 'comedy/drama', 'director', 'Jacob', 'Chase', 'life', 'choices', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'straightforward.Emily', 'Peck', 'aptly', 'Molly', 'woman', 'life', 'passion', 'so', 'disorientation', 'when', 'suddenly', 'love', 'woman.Chris', 'AldersonAuthor', '2013', 'Lesbian', 'Film', 'Guide']",N/A

Trouble is that of the main characters only one, Marja Lewis Ryan, is even remotely likeable.  Ryan, who also wrote the screenplay, is an outspoken lesbian who is living with a male friend, Trip (Todd Kubrak).  Trip, oddly, personifies all that any woman, but perhaps especially a lesbian, would seem to detest in men.  He is wholly a cad and scoundrel.  These two and their friends are trying to figure out who they are and how they might relate to others.  Unfortunately, none of them are very appealing.  The acting is pretty good, the writing isn't bad.  It's worth the time to watch for its originality and as a slice of life that must strike someone as real.
