Designed in 1952 and going into deployment in 1955, the B-52 Stratofortress is the longest-running production bomber ever produced. It is predicted the Air Force intends to keep the B-52 in service until 2045 - more than 90 years after the first B-52 entered service... an unprecedented length of service for any military aircraft! As someone who owns just about every recording related to Vietnam, I ordered this DVD not knowing what to expect. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by the caliber of this DVD. The interviews all look very clean and current, and the older video has a good, clean look (nothing like the poor, grainy video you see on some products).The DVD is divided into 4 parts:1) ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT2) B-52 AND THE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND3) B-52 GOES TO WAR4) LEGACY OF THE B-52Featuring rare archival footage, dramatic combat sequences and interviews with the men who flew these legendary planes they affectionately nicknamed the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F_ _ _ _ _) this episode explores the B-52s' development, operational deployment, combat characteristics and the strategic role it has played in the history of the United States. During the Cold War the B-52 was the backbone of America's Strategic Air Command, which was established in 1946 to provide 24-hour, around-the-clock protection with a fleet of B-52s in flight over North America. In the event of nuclear attack, a retaliatory strike could be ordered for the purposes of immediate reprisal. It was felt the benefit of a bomber was that it could always be called back, whereas once a missal is fired it's on its way. With the advent of intercontinental missals being carried by nuclear submarines that could launch from anywhere in the world at a moments notice, Strategic Air Command was deactivated in 1992. Then, with the escalating situation in Southeast Asia, it wasn't long before the BUFF would be back in service. With its ability to fly with in-flight refueling for extended periods of time, its superior performance and low operating costs, the Stratofortress has proven itself to be a valuable asset to the U.S. Air Force in various conflicts for more than half a century. From the Cold War and Vietnam, to the Gulf War and the War on Terror in Afghanistan, the B-52 remains a legendary bomber with a sterling performance record that has many more years of service remaining.",5,"INFORMATIVE, HIGH QUALITY, WELL-PRODUCED DVD",1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,2476,"['Legends', 'Air', 'Combat', 'in-depth', 'look', 'most', 'important', 'military', 'aircraft', 'ever', 'produced', 'Designed', '1952', 'going', 'deployment', '1955', 'B-52', 'Stratofortress', 'longest-running', 'production', 'bomber', 'ever', 'produced', 'predicted', 'Air', 'Force', 'keep', 'B-52', 'service', '2045', 'more', '90', 'years', 'first', 'B-52', 'entered', 'service', 'unprecedented', 'length', 'service', 'military', 'aircraft', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'recording', 'related', 'Vietnam', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'caliber', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'look', 'very', 'clean', 'current', 'older', 'video', 'good', 'clean', 'look', 'nothing', 'poor', 'grainy', 'video', 'see', 'products', '.The', 'DVD', 'divided', '4', 'parts:1', 'ORIGIN', 'AND', 'DEVELOPMENT2', 'B-52', 'THE', 'STRATEGIC', 'AIR', 'COMMAND3', 'B-52', 'GOES', 'TO', 'WAR4', 'LEGACY', 'THE', 'B-52Featuring', 'rare', 'archival', 'footage', 'dramatic', 'combat', 'sequences', 'interviews', 'men', 'who', 'flew', 'legendary', 'planes', 'affectionately', 'nicknamed', 'BUFF', 'Big', 'Ugly', 'Fat', 'F_', '_', '_', '_', '_', 'episode', 'B-52s', 'development', 'operational', 'deployment', 'combat', 'characteristics', 'strategic', 'role', 'played', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'Cold', 'War', 'B-52', 'was', 'backbone', 'America', 'Strategic', 'Air', 'Command', 'was', 'established', '1946', 'provide', '24-hour', 'around-the-clock', 'protection', 'fleet', 'B-52s', 'flight', 'North', 'America', 'event', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'retaliatory', 'strike', 'could', 'be', 'ordered', 'purposes', 'immediate', 'reprisal', 'was', 'felt', 'benefit', 'bomber', 'was', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'called', 'back', 'whereas', 'once', 'missal', 'fired', 'way', 'advent', 'intercontinental', 'missals', 'being', 'carried', 'nuclear', 'submarines', 'could', 'launch', 'anywhere', 'world', 'moments', 'notice', 'Strategic', 'Air', 'Command', 'was', 'deactivated', '1992', 'Then', 'escalating', 'situation', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'BUFF', 'would', 'be', 'back', 'service', 'ability', 'fly', 'in-flight', 'refueling', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'superior', 'performance', 'low', 'operating', 'costs', 'Stratofortress', 'proven', 'be', 'valuable', 'asset', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'various', 'conflicts', 'more', 'century', 'Cold', 'War', 'Vietnam', 'Gulf', 'War', 'War', 'Terror', 'Afghanistan', 'B-52', 'legendary', 'bomber', 'sterling', 'performance', 'record', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'service', 'remaining']",Legends of Air Combat: B-52 Stratofortress
