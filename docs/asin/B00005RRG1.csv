This is a good example.  My 10 month old just got this tape and loves it.  She loves watching the Wiggles on the Disney Channel and has for a couple of months.  She probably would have been engaged by the singing and dancing on this tape if I had gotten it  for her around six months old or younger yet it states from age ""one"".  On the other hand, the tape says up to 8 years old and I doubt to many 8 years would sit still very long for this.Anyway, I'd recommend it from 5 or 6 months to probably around 5 or maybe 6 years depending on the child (the cd's the Wiggles have made  could probably be played from just after birth as the songs have rhythm and rhyme and I believe babies can start to have an ear for this even in vitro).My daughter claps her hands, bounces in rhythm and sings along in her own unique chatter language, I think tapes like this really stimulate the mind of a baby and help them advance in speech, music and social skills.

Greg has a nice voice for country music too and I think he's realized that since he has released a regular country album.Anyway, this video was done as if they're in their Wiggly World (the Wiggles shows on Playhouse Disney), complete with the bumble bee in the beginning.

I find this is a good video to calm them down before bed, where something like ""Hoop De Doo, It's a Wiggly Party"" - is full of fast paced songs which are perfect for a energetic dance around the lounge room or to play at a birthday party.The video is great and features some well known Australia and New Zealand singers with songs that made them famous.

I was a newly-converted stay-home Dad, and I needed something to buy me snippets of time during the day.Instantly, my daughter was hooked.  Those familiar with the Wiggles music and antics don't need me to describe them--you either love them or hate them.  During the past nine months, they've become major celebrities in our house.Though we've since collected quite a few other Wiggles videos, this is the one my daughter requests over and over again.  Now 22 months old, she loves to sing and dance along with the songs, which offer a nice mix of show staples now seen on the Disney Channel (""Hey, Hey, Hey We're All Pirate Dancing,"" ""Let's Go,"" etc.) and other songs unique to this collection, with an Aussie and otherwise international flavor.It's the inclusion of the latter material that makes this tape special and keeps her coming back.  Even I can't help singing along with songs such as ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport,"" ""I Love to Have a Dance With Dorothy,"" and my daughter's absolute favorite, ""Taba Naba.""  An added bonus for me, a 40ish guy who experienced the New Wave 80s firsthand, is Tim Finn's appearance, performing a Captain Feathersword-friendly rendition of ""Six Months in a Leaky Boat.""All in all, this is a very fun collection with strong production and nice pacing, and it's a lot more bearable than some of the other tapes by the group, which offer little more than songs so familiar from the TV show.",5,"The best Wiggles video--and I like it, too",1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,1628,"['bought', 'video', 'lark', 'last', 'summer', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'promos', 'Wiggles', 'Barney', 'videos', 'son', 'loved', 'when', 'was', 'toddler', 'were', ""n't"", 'doing', 'much', 'then-14-month-old', 'daughter', 'was', 'newly-converted', 'stay-home', 'Dad', 'needed', 'something', 'buy', 'snippets', 'time', 'day.Instantly', 'daughter', 'was', 'hooked', 'familiar', 'Wiggles', 'music', 'antics', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'describe', 'love', 'hate', 'past', 'nine', 'months', ""'ve"", 'become', 'major', 'celebrities', 'house.Though', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'Wiggles', 'videos', 'one', 'daughter', 'requests', 'over', 'again', 'Now', '22', 'months', 'old', 'sing', 'dance', 'along', 'songs', 'offer', 'nice', 'mix', 'show', 'staples', 'now', 'seen', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Hey', 'Hey', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'Pirate', 'Dancing', 'Let', 'Go', 'etc', 'other', 'songs', 'unique', 'collection', 'Aussie', 'otherwise', 'international', 'flavor.It', 'inclusion', 'latter', 'material', 'tape', 'special', 'coming', 'back', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'singing', 'songs', 'such', 'Tie', 'Me', 'Kangaroo', 'Down', 'Sport', 'Love', 'Have', 'Dance', 'Dorothy', 'daughter', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Taba', 'Naba', 'added', 'bonus', '40ish', 'guy', 'who', 'experienced', 'New', 'Wave', '80s', 'firsthand', 'Tim', 'Finn', 'appearance', 'performing', 'Captain', 'Feathersword-friendly', 'rendition', 'Six', 'Months', 'Leaky', 'Boat', 'very', 'fun', 'collection', 'strong', 'production', 'nice', 'pacing', 'lot', 'more', 'bearable', 'other', 'tapes', 'group', 'offer', 'little', 'more', 'songs', 'so', 'familiar', 'TV', 'show']","The Wiggles - Wiggly, Wiggly World!

Their Choreographer is Leanne Halloran, who plays Officer Beaples, for the last time. The contract The Wiggles had with the Halloran school of Dance is over for good after this video. Just watch Hoop-De-Doo It's a Wiggly Party and see for yourself what The Wiggles amount too without the Hallorans.They do their best dancing it this film. It's worth it just to watch the dancing and the Halloran girls, Jesse and Casandra, almost all grown-up. Plus the songs are really good and the variety with all the singers is wonderful. My 26-month-old really loves this one, as she does with all the Wiggles videos. Buy the last video the Halloran School of Dance puts out, it is their finest work! Beautifully danced to three Pirate songs. I really like the variety in the backgrounds. Several are computer generated artwork, like in a barn and outside in the Australian Outback. And their main background stage is awesomly decorated with lots of roses and it almost looks like it is outside, but it is just painted walls and floors. A really good effect and fun too.

We adore the show, which makes my two year old (and my husband and me!) get up a dance every time!  This video definitely has a different tone, and it's much more of a ""sit comfortably and clap along"" type of tape.  Perfect for bedtime!We used to play a rented Wiggles tape before bed and wear ourselves out doing the Dinosaur dance, etc., but it was a good way to get my daughter wired (and Mom and Dad worn out!).  You'll find Wiggly, Wiggly World to be the opposite--totally soothing!  We particularly like the train song (a lullaby about a train bound for ""Morning Town--many miles away""), and the ""One Little Coyote"" song.  So much fun to sing along and  our little one knows the words already!  The many guest stars on this tape mainly hail from New Zealand, Australia and thereabouts.  You may not have heard of them, but they're really fun to listen to (especially if you like world music), and who knew Greg could sing in Japanese?  Personally, I always wondered what the song ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"" sounded like--and here it is!I honestly think this terrific tape shows that the Wiggles aren't just all about jumping up and down (though there's some of that here, too--and goodness knows, we enjoy it!).  These songs have a sort of harmony you don't hear in something like ""Fruit Salad... Yummy Yummy.""  They seem a little more . . . advanced, somehow, but just as fun!  I highly recommend this wonderful tape--you'll probably want the CD, too, if there is one!

Thus, there is no real continuity among the skits and songs. I think most of the songs are rather ""folksy"" and quite unfamiliar. This may or may not appeal to you and your kids. Mine don't request this tape often at all and when they do they always ask for a different tape after the first 5 or so songs. The train song near the end frightens my 3 1/2 yr old which I can't quite figure out. The train is a computer generated cartoon and the engine car squeezes in and out as if it's breathing as it ""travels"" along-perhaps this is what is scary to him.

Overall, I like the Wiggles a lot, but I wouldn't play this tape unless my kids requested it.
