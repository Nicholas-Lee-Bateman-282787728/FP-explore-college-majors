1103570,A3UQBLP7RHNBK0,B000VNMS6U,"Amazon Customer ""LMWoz""","[5, 5]",I just received the DVD of Libera in Concert.  Had a hard and depressing day?  Watch this DVD.  It is very calming and peaceful.  Their voices are really angelic.  One of the best things about this DVD is that you have the option of having the lyrics displayed or not.  I wish every musical DVD did this.  I didn't know the DVD came this way.  It was a very nice bonus.  Can't wait to hear and see more of Libera.,5,Excellent,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,413,"['just', 'received', 'DVD', 'Libera', 'Concert', 'Had', 'hard', 'depressing', 'day', 'Watch', 'DVD', 'very', 'calming', 'peaceful', 'voices', 'are', 'really', 'angelic', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'DVD', 'have', 'option', 'having', 'lyrics', 'displayed', 'not', 'wish', 'musical', 'DVD', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'DVD', 'came', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'bonus', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hear', 'see', 'more', 'Libera']",Angel Voices: Libera In Concert

1103573,A3IHBGZQW68DW3,B000VNMS6U,Gregory W. Curry,"[2, 3]",Libera is the New Age answer to the Vienna Choir Boys. Their stage presence and the sets where they sing add to the mood and atmosphere of their songs. It is unfortunate that they are not as well known in the US as the VCB because audience members would be able to appreciate the native English rather than the German or phonetic English of the VCB. I have given copies of their cd's as gifts and they are greatly appreciated.

This DVD contains some of Libera's most popular selections and they are done to perfection.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it.The music of the boys is absolutely haunting and evocative.  If you have never experienced Libera you MUST!  While I understand that their music is based in the Christian religion, I believe that people of all faiths can appreciate its beauty!Sometimes I find it difficult to believe that these are young boys from 8 - 14, and that they live basically normal lives of kids, doing what kids do and experiencing life to its fullest.  That's so easy to forget when you see them dressed in their white frocks and hear them singing like angles.Robert Prizeman and Phillip Byrd the directors have produced a sound that is absolutely unique in the world.  It speaks volumes of love, tranquility and devotion.  These boys really care about their music and love it.  It's the SOUND of ANGLES!!!Libera does not get to the US so we are unable to see them in person, so the DVD is the next best thing.  The DVD is in Dolby Surround sound, and believe me when I say you are there, it's just beautiful!The DVD offers some insight into their personal lives and their future goals.BUY IT TODAY, you will not be disappointed!",5,Libera - Angel Voices,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,1273,"['Absolutely', 'outstanding', 'DVD', 'Libera', 'most', 'popular', 'selections', 'are', 'done', 'perfection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'it.The', 'music', 'boys', 'absolutely', 'haunting', 'evocative', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'Libera', 'MUST', 'understand', 'music', 'based', 'Christian', 'religion', 'believe', 'people', 'faiths', 'can', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'Sometimes', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'are', 'young', 'boys', '8', '14', 'live', 'basically', 'normal', 'lives', 'kids', 'doing', 'what', 'kids', 'do', 'experiencing', 'life', 'fullest', 'so', 'easy', 'forget', 'when', 'see', 'dressed', 'white', 'frocks', 'hear', 'singing', 'angles.Robert', 'Prizeman', 'Phillip', 'Byrd', 'directors', 'have', 'produced', 'sound', 'absolutely', 'unique', 'world', 'volumes', 'love', 'tranquility', 'devotion', 'boys', 'really', 'care', 'music', 'love', 'SOUND', 'ANGLES', 'Libera', 'not', 'get', 'US', 'are', 'unable', 'see', 'person', 'DVD', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'DVD', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'sound', 'believe', 'when', 'say', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'beautiful', 'DVD', 'insight', 'personal', 'lives', 'future', 'IT', 'TODAY', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Angel Voices: Libera In Concert

The sound and picture quality is superb and the presentation is flawless. If Libera produce any more DVD's this household will certainly order them from Amazon....So for 2009...let's hope that more young choir music will be available on DVD....how about DVD's containing concerts from the Tolzer Sangerknaben, Vienna Boy's Choir and the Mozart Sangerknaben? and less of the smaltzy US fireside novelty christmas DVD's.Stephen Bandung Java Indonesia",5,just in time for the festive season,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,897,"['Libera', 'DVD', 'not', 'really', 'Christmas', 'arrived', 'house', 'tropical', 'Bandung', 'Java', 'Indonesia', 'just', 'time', 'festive', 'season', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'quality', 'european', 'choir', 'DVD', 'available..even', 'less', 'containing', 'popular', 'Christmas', 'songs', '.and', 'should', 'be', 'Libera', 'performance', 'was', 'recorded', '3', 'nights', 'very', 'old', 'historic', 'St', 'Pieter', 'Church', 'Leiden', 'Netherlands', 'appreciative', 'enthusiastic', 'live', 'audience', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'superb', 'presentation', 'flawless', 'Libera', 'produce', 'more', 'DVD', 'household', 'will', 'certainly', 'order', 'Amazon', '.So', '2009', 'let', 'hope', 'more', 'young', 'choir', 'music', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', '.how', 'DVD', 'containing', 'concerts', 'Tolzer', 'Sangerknaben', 'Vienna', 'Boy', 'Choir', 'Mozart', 'Sangerknaben', 'less', 'smaltzy', 'US', 'fireside', 'novelty', 'christmas', ""DVD's.Stephen"", 'Bandung', 'Java', 'Indonesia']",Angel Voices: Libera In Concert

I could begin when I first heard these boys sing about a year ago, or I could jump ahead and tell you about receiving my first CD.  Well, the first CD led me to purchasing all of their CDs right back to the beginning, before they were Libera.  Every CD is a blessing, and the voices are unbelievable.  Your latest CD/DVD is now the most played CD and DVD I own, your voices are out of this world, and the arrangements by Robert Prizeman are exquisite, you are to be congratulated sir on a job well done.  I would like to say something about all the boys but that would take forever, but I will mention a couple of them beginning with Tom.  Well Tom, you have a wonderful voice, and I love to listen to you sing. My two favouite songs that you sing are ""Far Away"" and  ""Do Not Stand at my Grave and Weep."" God has most certainly blessed you with a beautiful voice, which you control like a professional, congratulations.  What can I say about Josh, I just love to watch his face expressions when he sings, he looks so happy.  Josh, keep smiling and having fun, because I believe you touch a lot of people when they see & hear you sing, and don't you ever change. Ed Day, you too have great control of your voice and the duets you sing with Tom are so very beautiful.  I loved your sigh of relief after singing ""Prayer."" I will add to my comment by saying that it was also a very proud sigh, for a job well done, and I personally want to congratuale you as I'm sure a lot of hard work went into learning your difficult part. Then there is mini Ben.  You sing those high notes with so much ease, and I love your solo and duet in ""Going Home,"" it is so beautiful.  There were others who also sang beautifully as well or you wouldn't be a part of Libera.  Congratulations on a job well done, and I loved the Special Features on the DVD as well, do more on the next one, please.  Keep up the great work, and I pray that God will continue to Bless you all throughout your lives.  Sometime, please come to the Capital city of Canada (Ottawa), to sing, as I'd love to see you in person.",5,Angels here on Earth,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,2096,"['Where', 'do', 'begin', 'could', 'begin', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'boys', 'sing', 'year', 'ago', 'could', 'jump', 'ahead', 'tell', 'receiving', 'first', 'CD', 'Well', 'first', 'CD', 'led', 'purchasing', 'CDs', 'right', 'back', 'beginning', 'were', 'Libera', 'Every', 'CD', 'blessing', 'voices', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'latest', 'CD/DVD', 'now', 'most', 'played', 'CD', 'DVD', 'own', 'voices', 'are', 'world', 'arrangements', 'Robert', 'Prizeman', 'are', 'exquisite', 'are', 'be', 'congratulated', 'sir', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'something', 'boys', 'would', 'take', 'forever', 'will', 'mention', 'couple', 'beginning', 'Tom', 'Well', 'Tom', 'have', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'love', 'listen', 'sing', 'two', 'favouite', 'songs', 'sing', 'are', 'Far', 'Away', 'Do', 'Not', 'Stand', 'Grave', 'Weep', 'God', 'most', 'certainly', 'blessed', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'control', 'professional', 'congratulations', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Josh', 'just', 'love', 'watch', 'face', 'expressions', 'when', 'so', 'happy', 'Josh', 'keep', 'smiling', 'having', 'fun', 'believe', 'touch', 'lot', 'people', 'when', 'see', 'hear', 'sing', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'change', 'Ed', 'Day', 'too', 'have', 'great', 'control', 'voice', 'duets', 'sing', 'Tom', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'beautiful', 'loved', 'sigh', 'relief', 'singing', 'Prayer', 'will', 'add', 'comment', 'saying', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'proud', 'sigh', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'personally', 'want', 'congratuale', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'learning', 'difficult', 'part', 'Then', 'mini', 'Ben', 'sing', 'high', 'notes', 'so', 'much', 'ease', 'love', 'solo', 'duet', 'Going', 'Home', 'so', 'beautiful', 'were', 'others', 'who', 'also', 'sang', 'beautifully', 'as', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'Libera', 'Congratulations', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'loved', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'more', 'next', 'one', 'please', 'Keep', 'great', 'work', 'pray', 'God', 'will', 'continue', 'Bless', 'lives', 'Sometime', 'please', 'come', 'Capital', 'city', 'Canada', 'Ottawa', 'sing', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'person']",Angel Voices: Libera In Concert
