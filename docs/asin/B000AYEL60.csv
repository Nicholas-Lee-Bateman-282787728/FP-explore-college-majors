935049,A2XZ6THWPDKC0L,B000AYEL60,"B.J. Carroll ""niner4life8""","[26, 32]",I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game.

It was just a general over view of each season and even had segaments talking about other teams and not the 49ers. I did think that the highlights of the super bowls were very good and even the interviews of some of the players were very good.,3,Not real hilights of 49ers years,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,441,"['bought', 'hoping', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'highlights', 'five', 'years', '49ers', 'won', 'super', 'bowl', 'instead', 'showed', 'highlights', 'other', 'teams', 'seasons', 'not', '49ers', 'wanted', 'was', 'just', 'general', 'view', 'season', 'even', 'had', 'segaments', 'talking', 'other', 'teams', 'not', '49ers', 'did', 'think', 'highlights', 'super', 'bowls', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'interviews', 'players', 'were', 'very', 'good']",NFL Super Bowl Collection - San Francisco 49ers

935052,A3737SEKOIHFQE,B000AYEL60,ez,"[1, 2]",I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD.
