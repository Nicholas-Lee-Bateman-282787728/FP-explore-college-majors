But instead it scared me, mostly about anorexics losing bone mass when they lose their period. The video showed that you could lose a lot of bone mass in as little as 5 years, it scared me to realize I may have already caused that much irreversible damage.I did however find the scene called ""Running on Empty"" thinspirational because the girl in that scene was my idea of perfection. She ate normal meals but exercised excessively to get rid of her anxiety. I admire that because of all of the different ways people use to cope with anxiety (such as drugs or binging), she choose exercise and stuck with it. Of course that's probably just her personality type but still its admirable.",5,Very informative,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,780,"['have', 'eating', 'disorder', 'had', 'initially', 'bought', 'DVD', 'possible', 'thinspiration', 'instead', 'scared', 'mostly', 'anorexics', 'losing', 'bone', 'mass', 'when', 'lose', 'period', 'video', 'showed', 'could', 'lose', 'lot', 'bone', 'mass', 'as', 'little', '5', 'years', 'scared', 'realize', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'caused', 'much', 'irreversible', 'damage.I', 'did', 'however', 'find', 'scene', 'called', 'Running', 'Empty', 'thinspirational', 'girl', 'scene', 'was', 'idea', 'perfection', 'ate', 'normal', 'meals', 'exercised', 'excessively', 'get', 'rid', 'anxiety', 'admire', 'different', 'ways', 'people', 'use', 'cope', 'anxiety', 'such', 'drugs', 'binging', 'choose', 'exercise', 'stuck', 'course', 'probably', 'just', 'personality', 'type', 'still', 'admirable']",N/A

M WILINSKY,"[15, 19]","I have been involved with the analysis of eating disorders for decades, as well as being involved with ballet and athletics, so I feel qualified to comment on this.  I was quite surprised and disappointed when this dvd opened with a scathing reproach of all of ballet for promoting disease and destruction in young women.  This distorted view is actually corrected later in the program, and the efforts of those in ballet to promote the best possible health of dancers are shown.  In this competitive world people will sometimes go too far and make mistakes, but that is not the way it has to be.  To be a successful dancer or athlete, excellent stength and health are required.  A ballerina must have perfect muscle strength and tone and very strong bones, not just light weight(when lifting a ballerina you must not get the feeling that her ribs will crack!  Do you really think ten pounds one way or the other make such a difference?).  We also find some confusion here in what constitutes a psychiatric disorder and what is poor judgement.  This is a very important distinction in eating problems.  Anorexia nervosa is primarily characterized by a distortion of self image and not just by an effort to lose weight.  We are shown the cases of a few women who just decided they were making some diet mistakes and decided not to remain excessively thin.  One of these young ladies was said to have anorexia.  Then why did she have a complete understanding of her body composition and decide on her own to fix it?  Other more serious cases requiring psychiatric intervention are also presented.  The program does discuss one important aspect that is not discussed elsewhere enough and that is eating disorders among men.  Some conjecture is offered as to why it occurs less often among men than women.  Do you really think men don't care about their appearance?  Actually, differences in how eating disorders affect men and women are not well understood. It would also have been useful to examine another eating disorder that is connected with the desire to be thin and that is obesity. Even thought these distinctions are not brought out to my satisfaction in this program, I still think it is one of the best presentations available and I do recommend it.  The real nature of the grief of these case studies is movingly portrayed.",4,"Excellent Presentation of Some of the Issues of Eating Disorders, But a Bit Muddled.",1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,2332,"['have', 'been', 'involved', 'analysis', 'eating', 'disorders', 'decades', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'involved', 'ballet', 'athletics', 'feel', 'qualified', 'comment', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'when', 'dvd', 'opened', 'scathing', 'reproach', 'ballet', 'promoting', 'disease', 'destruction', 'young', 'women', 'distorted', 'view', 'actually', 'corrected', 'later', 'program', 'efforts', 'ballet', 'promote', 'best', 'possible', 'health', 'dancers', 'are', 'shown', 'competitive', 'world', 'people', 'will', 'sometimes', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'make', 'mistakes', 'not', 'way', 'be', 'be', 'successful', 'dancer', 'athlete', 'excellent', 'stength', 'health', 'are', 'required', 'ballerina', 'must', 'have', 'perfect', 'muscle', 'strength', 'tone', 'very', 'strong', 'bones', 'not', 'just', 'light', 'weight', 'when', 'lifting', 'ballerina', 'must', 'not', 'get', 'feeling', 'ribs', 'will', 'crack', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'ten', 'pounds', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'make', 'such', 'difference', 'also', 'find', 'confusion', 'here', 'what', 'psychiatric', 'disorder', 'what', 'poor', 'judgement', 'very', 'important', 'distinction', 'eating', 'problems', 'Anorexia', 'nervosa', 'primarily', 'characterized', 'distortion', 'self', 'image', 'not', 'just', 'effort', 'lose', 'weight', 'are', 'shown', 'cases', 'few', 'women', 'who', 'just', 'decided', 'were', 'making', 'diet', 'mistakes', 'decided', 'not', 'remain', 'excessively', 'thin', 'One', 'young', 'ladies', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'anorexia', 'Then', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'complete', 'understanding', 'body', 'composition', 'decide', 'own', 'fix', 'Other', 'more', 'serious', 'cases', 'requiring', 'psychiatric', 'intervention', 'are', 'also', 'presented', 'program', 'discuss', 'one', 'important', 'aspect', 'not', 'discussed', 'elsewhere', 'enough', 'eating', 'disorders', 'men', 'conjecture', 'offered', 'why', 'less', 'often', 'men', 'women', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'appearance', 'Actually', 'differences', 'how', 'eating', 'disorders', 'affect', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'understood', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'useful', 'examine', 'eating', 'disorder', 'connected', 'desire', 'be', 'thin', 'obesity', 'Even', 'thought', 'distinctions', 'are', 'not', 'brought', 'out', 'satisfaction', 'program', 'still', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'presentations', 'available', 'do', 'recommend', 'real', 'nature', 'grief', 'case', 'studies', 'movingly', 'portrayed']",N/A

I thought the interviews with professionals treating individuals with eating disorders, and the interviews with the people with eating disorders were well done. I enjoyed the focus on recovery, treatment and consequences of eating disorders. This documentary does a good job of driving home the serious consequences of this illness. However I felt that it could have focused on how eating disorders are present around the world, not just in industrialized countries and America in particular. Also this documentary focused on ballerinas and teenage girls with anorexia nervosa, so I think it might have been interesting to interview individuals from other walks of life, particularly a males about their experiences. I did like that it brushed quickly on the history of eating disorders, but I think an entire documentary could be done on that subject alone. Finally while they discussed medical characteristics of eating disorders, and how they appear to run in familys they did not mention the studies that show a genetic predisposition may be passed down through families which can increase an individual's risk of developing an eating disorder.",4,A pretty well done show,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1191,"['bought', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'thought', 'interviews', 'professionals', 'treating', 'individuals', 'eating', 'disorders', 'interviews', 'people', 'eating', 'disorders', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyed', 'focus', 'recovery', 'treatment', 'consequences', 'eating', 'disorders', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'driving', 'home', 'serious', 'consequences', 'illness', 'However', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'how', 'eating', 'disorders', 'are', 'present', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'industrialized', 'countries', 'America', 'particular', 'Also', 'documentary', 'focused', 'ballerinas', 'teenage', 'girls', 'anorexia', 'nervosa', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'interview', 'individuals', 'other', 'walks', 'life', 'particularly', 'males', 'experiences', 'did', 'brushed', 'quickly', 'history', 'eating', 'disorders', 'think', 'entire', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'subject', 'alone', 'Finally', 'discussed', 'medical', 'characteristics', 'eating', 'disorders', 'how', 'appear', 'run', 'familys', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'studies', 'show', 'genetic', 'predisposition', 'may', 'be', 'passed', 'down', 'families', 'can', 'increase', 'individual', 'risk', 'developing', 'eating', 'disorder']",N/A
