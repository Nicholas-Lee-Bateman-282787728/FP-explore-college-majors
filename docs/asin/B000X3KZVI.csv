I've seen her on her last three tours in Toronto, so I knew what to expect from the concert portion of this DVD. Here are the cons and pros of this DVD-set:Cons:- I don't like how it is mixed. Her vocals are too high in the mix, while the music is too low. You can really notice the wear and tear in her voice more-so this way.- Her dance moves are less than stellar (although I do appreciate the effort)- Her outfits are atrocious. I actually think she looks good in this concert (body-wise), but she needs to cover up a bit and let her talent be the forefront because the wardrobe looks tacky.Pros:- Her set-list from her last three tours hasn't changed drastically, so anyone who was disappointed for the ""Rainbow"" and ""Charmbracelet"" tours not being commercially available, you need not worry anymore.- She performs the majority of her hits, and she doesn't really miss anything that significant (except her biggest international hit, ""Without You""), so it's a really good retrospective of her career.  She also sings the more popular Bad Boy remixes of ""Fantasy"" and ""Honey (which has a portion of the 'So So Def Remix' with JD), and ends ""My All"" with the David Morales Remix.- Although her voice has been deteriorating over the years, it doesn't sound horrible and she puts in great effort to making a good vocal performance. I know some parts are pre-recorded and I'm sure there is some dubbing going on for this DVD, but most of it is live.- Her duet with special guests Boyz II Men is a show stopping performance. It was a very emotional moment.- The bonus features are very entertaining. Especially the documentary which takes you behind the scenes on the tour and where Mariah discusses why she chose the songs that she did etc.Overall. the cons greatly outweigh the cons. I do not think Mariah is the horrible performer that people make her out to be. She can sing, she has a true connection with her fans (whom she appreciates) when she performs, she sings all the mega-hits and the whole spectacle looks great. If you're not a big Mariah fan, you probably will not thoroughly enjoy this, but if you're a true fan, you will be delighted with this DVD.

1113170,AXX8RB4NJG0MH,B000X3KZVI,"Lil' Radio ""It's all to the good""","[7, 9]","I have been a huge Mariah fan since she made Vision Of Love. She has a dynamic voice, but she is kind of narcissistic. This tour was not bad, however there needed to be a few changes. Here's the setlist1. Intro - Rollercoaster2. It's Like That - pretty good song, but what's up with the costume? I just thought it was a little too much and revealing.3. Heartbreaker (Remix)/Original Version - Not my favorite song, Mariah I love you, but stop trying to dance.4. Dreamlover - one of my favorite songs, but in the second verse she sings this remix that I'm really not crazy about.5. My All/Morales Club Mix - love it!! My All has been one of my favorite songs for a while and I love how she adds the Morales Club Mix which is another of my favorite dance remixes.6. Shake It Off - I liked the performance! She uses the Mimi lights just like the music video.7. Vision Of Love - I'm so glad she performed this. Not a big fan of the dress, but I loved the vocals.8. Fly Like A Bird - She bought it home with this one! I liked how she added a choir.9. I'll Be There (feat Trey Lorenz) - very good. Reminded me of the MTV Unplugged version.10. Fantasy (Remix) - pretty good. I like the remixed version better than the original. For this section, she sang on the B stage instead of the A stage.11. Don't Forget About Us - not a big fan of this song, but the crowd seems to disagree with me.12. Always Be My Baby - love this song! Reminds me of a summer night.13. Honey - one of my favorite tracks from Butterfly(Mariah, please stop trying to dance!!!).14. I Wish You Knew - she doesn't perform the entire song. Just the last chorus. Pretty upsetting because it's one of my favorites from Emancipation.15. Can't Let Go - another one of my favorites, but she only performed the chorus :(16. One Sweet Day - powerhouse!! Boyz 2 Men performed with her and it's such an emotional song. That's why I loved it!17. Hero - another emotional song! I was pretty surprised when Mariah said that in the beginning, it wasn't her favorite.18. Make It Happen - My jam!! She also bought it home establishing the choir. I was very pleased that she performed this song!19. We Belong Together/Butterfly Reprise - I grew accustomed to this song because at first I hated it. Then after hearing it a couple of times, I liked it. Interesting song to close the show.Overall, this DVD is decent. However, I would've changed some things:1. the costumes were a little too skimpy and over the top.2. The concert was way too short. Usually, concerts last about an hour and thirty minutes to two hours. This one was an hour and ten minutes I believe.3. The DVD left out DJ Clue's spin breaks during Mariah's costume changes.Other than that, it was a pretty good tour.",3,"The Adventures Of Mimi - Pretty Good, but Needs Some Changes",1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,2728,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'Mariah', 'fan', 'made', 'Vision', 'Love', 'dynamic', 'voice', 'kind', 'narcissistic', 'tour', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'however', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'few', 'changes', 'Here', 'setlist1', 'Intro', 'Rollercoaster2', 'pretty', 'good', 'song', 'what', 'up', 'costume', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'revealing.3', 'Heartbreaker', 'Remix', '/Original', 'Version', 'Not', 'favorite', 'song', 'Mariah', 'love', 'stop', 'trying', 'dance.4', 'Dreamlover', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'second', 'verse', 'remix', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'crazy', 'about.5', 'All/Morales', 'Club', 'Mix', 'love', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'while', 'love', 'how', 'Morales', 'Club', 'Mix', 'favorite', 'dance', 'remixes.6', 'Shake', 'Off', 'liked', 'performance', 'Mimi', 'lights', 'just', 'music', 'video.7', 'Vision', 'Love', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'performed', 'Not', 'big', 'fan', 'dress', 'loved', 'vocals.8', 'Fly', 'A', 'Bird', 'bought', 'home', 'one', 'liked', 'how', 'added', 'choir.9', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'feat', 'Trey', 'Lorenz', 'very', 'good', 'Reminded', 'MTV', 'Unplugged', 'version.10', 'Fantasy', 'Remix', 'pretty', 'good', 'remixed', 'version', 'better', 'original', 'section', 'sang', 'B', 'stage', 'instead', 'A', 'stage.11', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Forget', 'Us', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'song', 'crowd', 'disagree', 'me.12', 'Be', 'Baby', 'love', 'song', 'summer', 'night.13', 'Honey', 'one', 'favorite', 'tracks', 'Butterfly', 'Mariah', 'please', 'stop', 'trying', 'dance', '.14', 'Wish', 'Knew', ""n't"", 'perform', 'entire', 'song', 'Just', 'last', 'chorus', 'Pretty', 'upsetting', 'one', 'favorites', 'Emancipation.15', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Let', 'Go', 'one', 'favorites', 'only', 'performed', 'chorus', '16', 'One', 'Sweet', 'Day', 'powerhouse', 'Boyz', '2', 'Men', 'performed', 'such', 'emotional', 'song', 'why', 'loved', '17', 'Hero', 'emotional', 'song', 'was', 'pretty', 'surprised', 'when', 'Mariah', 'said', 'beginning', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite.18', 'Make', 'Happen', 'jam', 'also', 'bought', 'home', 'establishing', 'choir', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'performed', 'song', '19', 'Belong', 'Together/Butterfly', 'Reprise', 'grew', 'accustomed', 'song', 'first', 'hated', 'Then', 'hearing', 'couple', 'times', 'liked', 'Interesting', 'song', 'close', 'show.Overall', 'DVD', 'decent', 'However', 'would', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'things:1.', 'costumes', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'skimpy', 'top.2', 'concert', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'Usually', 'concerts', 'last', 'hour', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'was', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'believe.3', 'DVD', 'left', 'out', 'DJ', 'Clue', 'spin', 'breaks', 'Mariah', 'costume', 'changes.Other', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'tour']",N/A

What matters most is what you already think of Mariah Carey. In fact, I don't know why I'm writing this, because world opinion renders any critical review impotent. There are people who love Mariah Carey's music, and those who can't stand it, and neither group is going to change, no matter what I have to say about it. This DVD collection contains a (very) short film by Spike Lee entitled ""Lovers and Haters"" that that makes my point for me. In the film, a group of `haters' attacks Mariah behind her back, wallowing in all kinds of nastiness while Mariah looks on and smiles it off. It's funny in a nasty sort of way, but that's the way the world is - either you identify with the girl, or you don't. Either you `get' her, or you don't. I could waste my time making all sorts of critical observations, but that would only throw me into the mix of players and haters, so I'll pass. Instead, I'll stick to the facts.""The Adventures of Mimi"" is a 2 disk DVD set that features a live performance by Mariah and her awesomely talented (oops, that's an opinion) backing band, caught live while on tour in California. From beginning to end, the performance is so slick you could ice skate on it, containing a stunning mix of cheesy opulence and studied perfection. In a word, this is spectacle (or as Mariah refers to it, `spectacularity""). A team of dancers surrounds Mariah and they perform like Olympic gymnasts, while the background vocalists swoop and swoon their way through each song as though they were superstars in their own right. The stage features four huge screens to project Mariah's image in a size that suits the grandiose nature of the program, and that isn't counting the additional screens installed on either side of the main platform. More bangles, baubles, beads and bling separate the screens than you'd see in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. Mariah (or `Mimi') performs a segment of the show on a smaller stage in the center of the arena, which she accesses as if she were a boxer approaching the main event. It's all-incredible, but nothing is more incredible than the look of absolute rapture on the faces of her fans as she performs each of her hit recordings. A second disk contains backstage footage, some karaoke recordings and Spike Lee's short film, as mentioned above.That should paint a fairly benign picture of the event featured on this DVD. There is simply no sense in denying Mariah Carey's talent, or her phenomenal popularity. This is a woman who has had 17 (and counting) #1 hits. A LOT of people love Mariah, and it would be ignorant for me to mention personal observations about her providing the world with a Disney-fied version of urban culture, or the hollow sentimentality of her lyrics. If I did that, I'd be a hater, so I'll keep my opinions to myself and let the world enjoy this video in peace.

1113178,A1S2IY37JU93XS,B000X3KZVI,W. E. Phillips,"[14, 14]","During the Glitter and Charmbracelet eras, a comeback from Mariah Carey seemed impossible to some. Her popularity, her quality of material, and even her voice appeared to be degrading at a painfully rapid rate. Even I, an avid fan of the songbird, began to think that she was on her way out of the music business. In early 2005, ""It's Like That"" was released, and although it was a nice track and the fans enjoyed it, it still wasn't making any big moves on the charts to make anyone think this new upcoming album would perform any differently than the past two. Then, out of nowhere came the mega-hit, ""We Belong Together,"" and the rest was history. The Emancipation of Mimi went on to be certified six times platinum by the RIAA, making it the best selling album of 2005. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, it was named the best contemporary R&B; album of the year. The album also gave Carey two more #1 singles to boast. This tour, which is her most successful one yet, topped it all off.I actually was fortunate enough to see this tour in my area, and I must say that this DVD does an excellent job of capturing the magic of her performance. The set is nice, as is the lighting. The concert was recorded in HD and is in surround sound, so obviously I have no complaints in that area. (The only problem I really have with the way it was shot is that I really didn't care to see the fans in the crowd and also, I wish the camera weren't always so close up to Mariah. I would've liked to have seen more full shots of the stage with everything going on at once a few times throughout the presentation.) The background vocalists, in my opinion, were superb and they really did an amazing job. The dancers seemed to be quite talented, but at most times, the choreography was a little lame and unexciting to me. But to be completely honest, I don't really look to the dancers to give me thrills during a concert: my eyes are always on the star of the show.Throughout the entire show, Mariah proves that she is back and here to stay. The voice, which some critics claimed was withering away to a mere whimper, is just as strong and bold as her early days. The high notes are still there, as is her soulful belting. And she really is singing live! She has astounding charisma and energy, and to top it all off, she looks better than ever.Choosing the setlist must have been an extremely difficult task; Mariah has been active in the music business for the last 17 or 18 years. She has had many hit singles and also many great album tracks that have become fan favorites. Well, all I can say is that it was chosen perfectly. It has some stuff for all the new fans that she gained with this new album, but it is also faithful to the fans that have been there since day one. Most of her studio albums are represented with at least one song. All of the songs are pretty much performed in their entirety. (It really annoys me when artists do little one-and-a-half-minute versions of their songs, trying to cram everything in.) What I also liked was how she slipped in little pieces of some of her remixes into the performances. It was cool how she sang part of ""Dream Lover"" over the instrumental of Biggie's ""Juicy."" The powerful performance of ""Fly Like A Bird"" was worth the price of this set alone for me.Aside from the concert, this also has some special features. The first disc has a behind-the-scenes feature, which are always fun to watch at least once. It also contains a jukebox feature that allows you to arrange and play your own setlist. (Mine: ""Fly Like A Bird,"" ten times in a row.) I think the idea is quite ingenious. The second disc has a tour documentary, with interviews from all parties involved, speaking on the setlist, set design, dancers, etc. I always find these things interesting because it really takes an incredible amount of work to put a tour of this magnitude together, and it's always nice to hear Mariah speak. Also, a few, but not all, of the concert's songs are here in karaoke form so you can sing along. Last, a Spike-Lee directed short, Lovers and Haters, is included. It's Mariah's way of responding to--and laughing at--all the rumors that ""haters"" have created about her over the years. I don't really think this set needed to be two discs. I'm sure all the special features would've fit on one DVD, but I still enjoyed them all.This tour documents an amazing performer who has once again returned to her prime. Overall, this is a great, entertaining, and worthwhile DVD set. If you are a Mariah fan, then this is for you.",4,4   stars - Excellent concert.,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,4548,"['Glitter', 'Charmbracelet', 'eras', 'comeback', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'seemed', 'impossible', 'popularity', 'quality', 'material', 'even', 'voice', 'appeared', 'be', 'degrading', 'painfully', 'rapid', 'rate', 'Even', 'avid', 'fan', 'songbird', 'began', 'think', 'was', 'way', 'music', 'business', 'early', '2005', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'nice', 'track', 'fans', 'enjoyed', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'big', 'moves', 'charts', 'make', 'anyone', 'think', 'new', 'upcoming', 'album', 'would', 'perform', 'differently', 'past', 'two', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'came', 'mega-hit', 'Belong', 'Together', 'rest', 'was', 'history', 'Emancipation', 'Mimi', 'went', 'be', 'certified', 'six', 'times', 'platinum', 'RIAA', 'making', 'best', 'selling', 'album', '2005', '2006', 'Grammy', 'Awards', 'was', 'named', 'best', 'contemporary', 'R', 'B', 'album', 'year', 'album', 'also', 'gave', 'Carey', 'two', 'more', '1', 'singles', 'boast', 'tour', 'most', 'successful', 'one', 'yet', 'topped', 'off.I', 'actually', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'tour', 'area', 'must', 'say', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'magic', 'performance', 'set', 'nice', 'lighting', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'HD', 'surround', 'sound', 'obviously', 'have', 'complaints', 'area', 'only', 'problem', 'really', 'have', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'see', 'fans', 'crowd', 'also', 'wish', 'camera', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'so', 'close', 'Mariah', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'full', 'shots', 'stage', 'everything', 'going', 'once', 'few', 'times', 'presentation', 'background', 'vocalists', 'opinion', 'were', 'superb', 'really', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'dancers', 'seemed', 'be', 'quite', 'talented', 'most', 'times', 'choreography', 'was', 'little', 'lame', 'unexciting', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'dancers', 'give', 'thrills', 'concert', 'eyes', 'are', 'always', 'star', 'show.Throughout', 'entire', 'show', 'Mariah', 'back', 'here', 'stay', 'voice', 'critics', 'claimed', 'was', 'withering', 'away', 'mere', 'whimper', 'just', 'strong', 'bold', 'early', 'days', 'high', 'notes', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'soulful', 'belting', 'really', 'singing', 'live', 'astounding', 'charisma', 'energy', 'top', 'off', 'better', 'ever.Choosing', 'setlist', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'task', 'Mariah', 'been', 'active', 'music', 'business', 'last', '17', '18', 'years', 'had', 'many', 'hit', 'singles', 'also', 'many', 'great', 'album', 'tracks', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Well', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'chosen', 'perfectly', 'stuff', 'new', 'fans', 'gained', 'new', 'album', 'also', 'faithful', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'day', 'one', 'Most', 'studio', 'albums', 'are', 'represented', 'least', 'one', 'song', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'performed', 'entirety', 'really', 'when', 'artists', 'do', 'little', 'one-and-a-half-minute', 'versions', 'songs', 'trying', 'cram', 'everything', 'What', 'also', 'liked', 'was', 'how', 'slipped', 'little', 'pieces', 'remixes', 'performances', 'was', 'cool', 'how', 'sang', 'part', 'Dream', 'Lover', 'instrumental', 'Biggie', 'Juicy', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Fly', 'A', 'Bird', 'was', 'price', 'set', 'alone', 'me.Aside', 'concert', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'disc', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'also', 'jukebox', 'feature', 'arrange', 'play', 'own', 'setlist', 'Mine', 'Fly', 'A', 'Bird', 'times', 'row', 'think', 'idea', 'quite', 'ingenious', 'second', 'disc', 'tour', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'parties', 'involved', 'speaking', 'setlist', 'set', 'design', 'dancers', 'etc', 'always', 'find', 'things', 'interesting', 'really', 'incredible', 'amount', 'work', 'put', 'tour', 'magnitude', 'together', 'always', 'nice', 'hear', 'Mariah', 'speak', 'Also', 'few', 'not', 'concert', 'songs', 'are', 'here', 'karaoke', 'form', 'can', 'sing', 'along', 'Last', 'Spike-Lee', 'directed', 'short', 'Lovers', 'Haters', 'included', 'Mariah', 'way', 'responding', 'laughing', 'rumors', 'haters', 'have', 'created', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'set', 'needed', 'be', 'two', 'discs', ""'m"", 'sure', 'special', 'features', 'would', ""'ve"", 'fit', 'one', 'DVD', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'all.This', 'tour', 'documents', 'amazing', 'performer', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'returned', 'prime', 'Overall', 'great', 'entertaining', 'worthwhile', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'Mariah', 'fan', 'then']",N/A

This is by far, I believe, the most vivid live concert video available shot in widescreen and in HD. The concert is very entertaining and enjoyable. I watched it twice in a row as soon as I inserted this blu-ray. Mariah performs very well with all her great voice. To be honest, I expected she would have hard time singing songs with high notes because of her aging but I was wrong. In the concert, she proves she still can sing as before! I felt the concert was rather short even though it was 80 minutes long. I mean I wanted more! She could have sung more songs such as ""Without You"", ""Emotions"", ""Love Takes Time"", etc. It was great to see Boyz II Men and Mariah sing ""One Sweet Day"" together. Of course, Trey Lorenz, one of the back vocals of the concert, sings his part for ""I'll Be There"". Mariah, keep up the good work with your beautiful smile!The concert itself deserves five stars but I have to take one off because of the clumsy production. Spotligting is not very accurate but most of all, camera work is, I would say, horrible! Firstly, you will see too much of audience shots in the latter part of the show. For example, when MC sings ""Hero"", almost half of the shots are done with audience. You will even remember some people in the audience after watching because of repetitious and long-staying zoom-ins. Who cares about audience that much? Who wants to miss the main performer instead? Secondly, there are many cases that a camera misses the hightlight of a song and the performer failing enhancing the mood of the song. For example, when MC sings with such high notes covering her ear (you know what I mean), the camera suddenly zoom out and shows the whole arena or people instead. In addition, there are some blurry/unfocused and pointless shots. So, I'm sure that the concert would have been much more enjoyable with a better production.Technically, PQ is 4.5/5 (VC-1 coding) IMO and AQ is 5/5 with uncompressed PCM 5.1/2.0.
