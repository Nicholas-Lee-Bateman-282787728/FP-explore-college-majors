1005286,AV1KYJXHOWPMD,B000GLL1C4,"C HAGAN ""Anime Brothers""","[0, 2]","I was blown away by this fantastic animated movie. I have been a longtime Pokemon fan since the late 1990s and I love this series. the movies were good too. This is the absolute best film in the franchise and also, one of the best animated movies ever made. The animation is first rate, the acting by the cast here is excellent, and the story is ingenious. I love it. Too bad this was the last one that the original voice cast got to do. When the crappy new dub that was used for the movie on disc two called Mastermind Of Mirage Pokemon was introduced, everything related to it (season 9 and on, plus the next film and probably the next) became unwatchable. I would recommend the whole series up to season 8 (season 8 was the last series with the original vocal cast) and all the movies with the original cast. They are great. Until season 9 and on or any new Pokemon movie brought to America is redubed with the great original cast (Veronica Taylor, Rachel Lillis, Eric Stuart, Maddie Blaustein, etc) they will not get a view from me.

It has some okay action seqeunces in it but they not as intense and briefer than those in the first five movies. For those of you that don't know the chronoligical order that would be all the movie from Pokemon Mewtwo strikes back untill Pokemon Forever. Also i thought I would also inform if your intrested that this actually the nith movie not the eighth movie. Unfortunately some fans of the movies series did not consider Mew Two Returns a movie do to its very short running time of only about 70 to 79 minutes when most pokemom movies usually last about 80 minutes to 2 hours depending if you are watching the normal dvd or vhs format version of these movies or the made for television versions. I believe this movie was supposed to be on Cartoon network sometime later this month. This movie had is bebue last Friday on Cartoon network. The adventures of Ash contiunue after the movie starts after a brief flash back scene. Ask takes part in a cermony to honor a legendary hero Sir Aron who saved the kingdoom from destruction. When Lucario the companion of Sir Aron is freed from his prison he thinks his master sir Eran betrayed him and his queen. Lucario was a new pokemon at this time he is a tall blue fox like pokemon about four foot 8 tall. It's up to ash with the aid of Brock, and his newest companions max and may (they were brought in at the end of the master quest series to replace misty until see later briefly return for about two in either pokemon advanced challange or battle I can't remember which. Can Ash help Lucario learn the real reason for his imprisonment and to trust humans again and once again save the tree of ages from otter destruction just like the brave Sir Aron did 1000 years ago.

1005291,AY5XWJE0LEYB8,B000GLL1C4,jasmine garcia,"[1, 2]","In the legendary past, before Pok&eacute; Balls were made, an aura-guiding hero Pok&eacute;mon named Lucario sensed two armies about to clash at Cameron Palace in Kanto. He told his master, Sir Aaron, while he was being attacked by a group of Houndoom. During the battle, Lucario was blinded, and he used his Aura Sphere to eliminate the Houndoom.The Queen of Cameron, Lady Rin, decided to die with her people, and so Aaron got on his Pidgeot and traveled to the Tree of Beginning, but they were attacked by a rival group of Skarmory. Later, Lucario arrived by sensing his master's Aura. Sir Aaron forbade Lucario from calling him ""Master"" anymore and admitted he has abandoned the Queen. He then swore never to return and headed to the Tree of Beginning. Lucario tried to go with him, but Aaron sealed Lucario in his staff. Pidgeot visited the queen with only Sir Aaron's staff, and the queen realized that Sir Aaron sacrificed himself by using his own aura to stop the war.Many years later, Ash, Pikachu, Brock, May and Max arrive at Cameron Palace to celebrate the life of Sir Aaron. Ash competes in the Pok&eacute;mon competition, and wins against a trainer named Kidd and her Weavile. That night there is a royal ball, and Ash is rewarded with the Hero's Chair and the privilege to hold Sir Aaron's staff. Team Rocket join the dance too, but Meowth runs off to follow Kidd, who reveals herself as an Agent seeking to capture a Mew.The Pok&eacute;mon run off into the attic to play. However, Kidd's two Weavile attack when Mew joins in. Mew teleports away with Pikachu and Meowth, and Max finds out what happened. In the ballroom, Ash watches fireworks, unaware of what is happening to the Pok&eacute;mon. Suddenly, Lucario is freed from the staff probably because of Ash having a resemblance to Sir Aaron's aura. Lucario was confused of what has happened since the time he was sealed and seek to search for answers.Max informs the rest of the group that Pikachu and Meowth have been taken; Team Rocket overhear him. Lady Ilene, the current queen, says Mew has a tradition of showing up at the palace and taking toys to its home at the Tree of Beginning. Ash and the rest (including Kidd, who Brock finally realizes is famous) head off to the Tree of Beginning with the help of Lucario (Team Rocket follows by hiding in Kidd's trunk).On their journey, they find a Time Flower (which allows the finder to look at images of the past) and meet a Bonsly which hitches a ride with the team. That night, Ash recalls how much he and Pikachu have been through, like in the first episode when a flock of Spearow attacked him and Pikachu leaped in and shocked them to the ground. Lucario scoffs at that story, saying humans can never be trusted. Ash gets mad and tackles Lucario, but ends up losing in the brawl, upsetting Lucario far more. Max tries to cheer the Pok&eacute;mon up with chocolate.The next morning, Lucario encounters the same area where he was sealed in the staff. A Time Flower reveals Sir Aaron trapped his servant and ran off, making everyone believe Lucario in his point of view of the so-called legend. Ash apologizes to Lucario for his behavior last night and begins to cry; Lucario asks Ash to promise that he will not desert Pikachu.At that moment, Regirock attacks, and everyone runs into the Tree of Beginning. Ash and Lucario split up with May, Max, Brock, and Kidd. Ash ends up getting attacked by Regice, so he and Lucario decide to backtrack. Meanwhile, everyone else is attacked by Registeel, and antibodies produced by the trees are devouring human as if they were a disease. Kidd is the only one who survives.Ash finally reunites with Pikachu and meets up with Meowth and Kidd. Kidd tells Ash that his friends have been swallowed by the giant cells. Soon, Ash and Kidd get eaten up, while Registeel stops Lucario from saving them. All of Ash's Pok&eacute;mon, even Pikachu, cry over their trainers' deaths. However, Mew decides to talk with the tree, using its powers of love and caring, and brings everyone back.Mew, after its performance, becomes ill. Finding that the Tree is dying due to its immune system going into shock, Ash, Kidd, Mew, and Lucario run into the heart of the Tree. They find Sir Aaron in suspended animation, and a Time Flower showing that the legend was true.Ash uses Sir Aaron's gloves to help squeeze out his own aura to restore the tree, with Lucario's help, both knowing they will die in the process. As the aura sphere gets larger and much more powerful, Lucario knocks Ash back and demands to finish the rest. The tree is restored, and Mew is also restored back to health, but Lucario only has little time left. A Time flower is found once again showing Sir Aaron saying goodbye to Lucario as he dies, and sharing that Lucario was more than his pupil, he was his closest friend, and that he hopes to meet Lucario again someday. Lucario begins to cry seeing his master's final image, saying to himself that he failed his master. Ash holds Lucario's paws and says that he proved to be as good a Guardian of Aura as Sir Aaron. Lucario then dies, thanking Ash for encouragement, and goes to see his friend.Ash and Kidd meet May, Brock, and Max outside, who realize Lucario is not with them. Brock mentions it is hard to believe Lucario is gone, but Ash says, ""He isn't gone... his aura is with me"".In the credits sequence, it is shown that Ash and co. return to the palace and are rewarded by Lady Ilene; Lucario and Sir Aaron share a chocolate bar in their distant place after death; Kidd leaves and meets with Butler and Diane from a previous film; and Ash and his friends continue their journey.",5,the legend of lucario.,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,5652,"['legendary', 'past', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'Balls', 'were', 'made', 'aura-guiding', 'hero', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'named',

Supposdely the staff contaning Lucario was found. Said a mother reading to her little daughter the Legend of Aaron and Lucario in a small town next to the Orudoran Castle. Ash,Brock,May,and Max are walking along a bridge to Orudoran castle, they are wearing there regular clothes. After they went though the bridge they change into different clothes. Then Ash learns of the Wave Guiding Hero tornament. He enters the tornament and wins it. Then just as Ash is celebrating his win Mew grabs Pickachu and flies a way. Then Ash learns that Mew took Pikachu to the orgin tree. Ash travels with Lucario and co. to the orgin tree. As Ash and co. are traveling Kid gets traped in a red glop. She sends out her two Weaviles. As they enter the orgin tree the three Regis ambish them. Ash tries to battle them but their to powerful! out of nowhere Mew appears and stops the Regis. As their are in the orgin tree They notice Aaron frozen. Ash touches a time flower it shows Ho-oh reveals it self as Mew and Aaron is giving Mew energy just as Mew gets all of its energy back Aaron falls down in pain and then the scene ends. Ash knew what they would have to do. One of them would have to give up their life. Just as they are going up to Mew Lucario touches a time flower. The scene shows Aaron nealing down in pain. Aaron last words are He never thought of Lucario as a servent but a friend. He said the reason he sealed Lucario was because he wanted to protect him. Then the scene ends. Lucario starts giving his energy to Mew. Mew is still weak. Lucario tells Ash that he also has the Aura engergy. Ash puts on Aarons gloves. Ash and Lucario start giving energy to Mew. Then just as Mew is geting its energy back Lucario pushes Ash out of the way. Then Lucario kneels down in pain. Just like Aaron and then Lucario freezes. Ash and co. watch as Lucario's and Aaron's spirts are floting in the air. Then everying goes back to normal. At the end of the credits Aaron and Lucario are walking nerby Orudoran Castle. Aaron shares a choclate bar with Lucario.

1005293,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000GLL1C4,Lesley Aeschliman,"[2, 2]","The first disc in this set has three special features included on the disc.  The first is ""Behind the Scenes,"" which is a roughly six-minute documentary.  It starts out talking about the visuals (you see the director scouting out locations in Germany, as well as the steps that go into making the visuals), the soundtrack (you see the orchestra recording one of the pieces), and a message from the director (his words are dubbed into English by the narrator, instead of utilizing subtitles).  Next is a slideshow of character sketches, which runs for about three-and-a-half minutes.  However, the viewer has no control over how fast the visuals move, and the visuals move rather quickly; if you blink, you might miss something.  The final extra is ""Pokemon Online,"" which is a splash screen promoting the official Pokemon website.When Lucario and the Mystery of Mew was released in the United States, it was released as a two-disc collector's edition.  The second disc contains Pokemon: The Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon, which is a tenth anniversary special that runs for forty-two minutes.  There are only two special features on this disc.  The first is ""A Letter From the Director.""  It's three pages in length, and the viewer has control over when the pages change.  In the letter, the director briefly talks about the special and about the American Pokemon fans.  There is also a splash screen to promote the official Pokemon website.The movie is pretty standard for a Pokemon film.  It tries to combine computer animation with traditional cel animation; while the computer animation doesn't stand out quite as drastically as it did in some of the earlier films, it still does stand out a little compared to the traditional cel drawings.  The Pokemon special on disc two was all right, but it wasn't as good as the film.

I had wanted to see it again but didn't think I would be able to buy the DVD since I do not approve of the new voice-actors. But Master of Mirage Pokemon came ""free"" with Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, so I couldn't be happier.Not only that, but Lucario and the Mystery of Mew is one of the best Pokemon movies ever! I was surprised, because the last two Pokemon movies have been among the worst ever, in my opinion. Jirachi Wishmaker was the worst movie by far, and Destiny Deoxys was nothing special either. I thought the great, classic, well-directed and well-done Pokemon movies of the past (my favorites are Pokemon Heroes, and the first Pokemon movie, but 4-Ever was also quite good) were done. But Lucario and the Mystery of Mew returns to the old formula that I enjoy so much. The viewers, once again, are treated to the defining sub-opening battle sequence involving Ash with the credits overlayed and the American theme music playing...one of my favorite parts of all the Pokemon movies (except Wishmaker which removed this sequence). The dubbing is fantastic as well, by the original voice actors, and with care put into it (unlike Wishmaker, which was done cheesily and in a hurry). This movie succeeded in rekindling my interest in Pokemon.Lucario and the Mystery of Mew is also one of the longest-running Pokemon movies ever at 1 hour and 40 minutes, further increasing the value of this DVD set. Recommended to all Pokemon fans, even those who have not watched Pokemon in some time.EDIT: I found out this is unfortunately a glitched disc. My copy of Lucario and the Mystery of Mew always skips once during the part of the opening theme song where Pikachu jumps into the air to do the final Thunder attack. A number of people have reported this and most discs are flawed at this spot. I also saw a report of someone getting 2 copies of Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon in their set instead of 1 copy of each show.
