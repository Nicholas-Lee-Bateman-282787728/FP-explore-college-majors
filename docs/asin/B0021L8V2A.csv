I was excited to have no preconceived conceptions or expectations for the movie, but decided about halfway through that it would have helped to at least know the basic premise before going in.The movie revolves around a crew of ""takers,"" who are essentially bank robbers.  They all dress well, have fantastic cars, and have apparently never been caught.  However, one former/current member of their crew has been caught, and is now out of jail for good behavior.  Right after one large bank job, this member contacts the crew, and tells them of a once-in-a-lifetime heist that is happening in five days.  This breaks their rules of always waiting two years in between heists, but they decide to do it anyways.If you're wondering why there are no character names in that summary, it's because you're never quite sure what their names are.  The whole movie feels very generic - an updated version of Ocean's 11 with more brawling and violence, and less charisma.  There are some genuinely interesting scenes, however, as well as some great cinematic shots, and LA looks better on film than it does in real life.  It's a fine way to spend two hours, but at the end of the day, I could take it or leave it.",3,Generic heist movie,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1317,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'Takers', 'walked', 'theatre', 'was', 'out', 'friends', 'chose', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'have', 'preconceived', 'conceptions', 'expectations', 'movie', 'decided', 'halfway', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'least', 'know', 'basic', 'premise', 'going', 'in.The', 'movie', 'around', 'crew', 'takers', 'who', 'are', 'essentially', 'bank', 'robbers', 'dress', 'well', 'have', 'fantastic', 'cars', 'have', 'apparently', 'never', 'been', 'caught', 'However', 'one', 'former/current', 'member', 'crew', 'been', 'caught', 'now', 'jail', 'good', 'behavior', 'Right', 'one', 'large', 'bank', 'job', 'member', 'crew', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'heist', 'happening', 'five', 'days', 'rules', 'always', 'waiting', 'two', 'years', 'heists', 'decide', 'do', 'anyways.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'are', 'character', 'names', 'summary', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'names', 'are', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', 'very', 'generic', 'updated', 'version', 'Ocean', '11', 'more', 'brawling', 'violence', 'less', 'charisma', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'however', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'cinematic', 'shots', 'LA', 'better', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'fine', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'end', 'day', 'could', 'take', 'leave']",N/A

What makes it uninteresting is the fact that I was able to predict the pacing, the writing, and how everything would fall into place.  Why was I able to predict it so easily, you might be asking yourself?  Because I've seen the same kind of crap a thousand times ever since the mid 80's.That's right- for the last 25 years I've had to endure similar predictable movie writing, and just when I thought the nightmare was finally starting to end due to the formula being overexposed to the point of utter failure and boredom, here enters Takers.  Shooting scenes that do absolutely nothing to excite me whatsoever thanks to a lackluster storyline, and detective/police officer characters that don't stand out from the several others that I've had to put up with over the years starring in other identically-written movies.  There's nothing original or encouraging about this movie, and that's a shame.The only fairly interesting moment comes near the end when, without revealing what happens, a huge explosion occurs.  From there, the quality improves enough for me to give the film a rating of 2 out of 5 (in addition to a satisfying conclusion with a moment of tear-jerking beauty) but because I've seen this exact type of action several times already and therefore am completely exhausted, I don't feel the need to recommend such bland writing to anyone else.",2,boring shooting,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1487,"['Takers', 'probably', 'most', 'generic', 'shooter', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'uninteresting', 'storyline', 'making', 'significantly', 'worse', 'What', 'uninteresting', 'fact', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'pacing', 'writing', 'how', 'everything', 'would', 'fall', 'place', 'Why', 'was', 'able', 'predict', 'so', 'easily', 'might', 'be', 'asking', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'kind', 'crap', 'thousand', 'ever', 'mid', ""80's.That"", 'right-', 'last', '25', 'years', ""'ve"", 'had', 'endure', 'similar', 'predictable', 'movie', 'writing', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'nightmare', 'was', 'finally', 'starting', 'end', 'due', 'formula', 'being', 'overexposed', 'point', 'utter', 'failure', 'boredom', 'here', 'Takers', 'Shooting', 'scenes', 'do', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'excite', 'thanks', 'lackluster', 'storyline', 'detective/police', 'officer', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'several', 'others', ""'ve"", 'had', 'put', 'up', 'years', 'starring', 'other', 'identically-written', 'movies', 'nothing', 'original', 'encouraging', 'movie', 'shame.The', 'only', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'moment', 'end', 'when', 'revealing', 'what', 'huge', 'explosion', 'occurs', 'there', 'quality', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'rating', '2', '5', 'addition', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'moment', 'tear-jerking', 'beauty', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'exact', 'type', 'action', 'several', 'times', 'already', 'therefore', 'am', 'completely', 'exhausted', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'recommend', 'such', 'bland', 'writing', 'anyone', 'else']",N/A

Jane"" camerawork shenanigans, mix together for for about 1.5 hours, and then enjoy a taste.Although ""Takers"" did have its flaws, overall it was a pretty good actioner.  The cast was full of familiar faces, including Matt Dillon, Chris Brown, Paul Walker, Hayden Christensen, T.I., Idris Elba, and Johnathon Schaech; and they did what they could with the script given to them to make you care about the characters, plot and sub-plots.Although comparisons have been made, I don't think ""Takers"" is in the same league as ""Heat"", mainly due to lack of character development, inability to believe some of the details in the movie, and the fact that the cameramen were all over the place during the action sequences.  Call me old fashioned, but when people are running around chasing and shooting at each other, I like to see more than just feet at times along with seeing who's shooting at who.Having said that, ""Takers"" still deserves 3 stars.  I give 2 stars alone just to have had the pleasure of getting another big screen look at Zoe Saldana (a beautiful lady with a face similar to Jada Pinkett Smith and a body that rocks--who, by the way, you can see in several other roles, i.e. Theresa Jones in the romantic comedy ""Guess Who"" and Uhura in the 2009 version of ""Star Trek"").

1248396,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0021L8V2A,C. Sawin,"[8, 17]","Takers looked like a pretty cliche thriller just from its movie posters and trailers. Hip hop artists T.I. and Chris Brown have supporting roles in the film while African American actors Idris Elba (The Losers, RocknRolla) and Michael Ealy (Seven Pounds, 2 Fast 2 Furious) are featured, as well. These four actors are the ones you see the most of in the film and if you haven't really followed their acting career or listen to hip hop at all, then you probably won't have much interest. Paul Walker, Hayden Christensen, Matt Dillon, and Jay Hernandez round out the rest of the main cast. There was a rather large clamoring amongst fans and moviegoers of the horrid acting of Hayden Christensen while the Star Wars prequels were in theaters. If you haven't seen him in anything since then, then just know he hasn't gotten much better. While Paul Walker has certainly had his moments (mainly Pleasantville and Joy Ride), he doesn't really have much room to talk either.The biggest struggle Takers faces is that it feels like a movie you've already seen. Remember all those films revolving around bank heists? Dog Day Afternoon, Heat, Point Break, The Dark Knight, The Italian Job, the list goes on and on. Every one of those films managed to bring something different to the table or at least featured something somewhat different or appealing to make it identifiable when presented in a line up of bank heist films. Takers is so similar to last year's Armored that it feels almost pointless to have taken place in the first place. Both films contain a heist involving armored cars, a mostly African-American cast, and even though Matt Dillon seems to have switched roles in comparison to the two films, it doesn't help that he's featured in both. That along with Idris Elba and Zoe Saldana being in the film almost seemed like Takers was actually a cheap combination of The Losers and Armored, which is probably a pretty decent way to describe the film. Do moviegoers like seeing the same movie over and over again because it sure seems that way.The camera work felt incredibly sloppy, as well. In the first 20 or so minutes of the film, I felt more nauseous than I did at any point of Cloverfield. The way the camera spun around so quickly and so often combined with the way shots kept zooming in and out just didn't make the film feel like it was professionally shot. Certain scenes in the film seemed like they were too close while at other times the camera would zoom out slightly that came off like an error of judgement while the cameras just continued to roll. All in all, the camera work just felt very erratic and unfocused.This is usually the part in my review where I try to say something positive or make a compliment sandwich kind of deal, but there really isn't much to work with. Hayden Christensen's fight scene, the chase involving Chris Brown, and the gun fight with the Russians are probably the highlights. The writing wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been either although it probably helps that there were four different writers credited on the film.Takers is a stale crime thriller that consists of both an A.D.D. style of film choreography and a cast aimed at a specific demographic that will likely hurt the film more than benefit it. The obvious little twist the film throws at you sticks out like a sore thumb and the way the film ends will probably leave a lot to be desired. Whether you look at Takers as an action packed crime thriller or an entertaining experience, Takers comes up short and takes last place.",2,A stale and cliche crime thriller.,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,3543,"['Takers', 'looked', 'pretty', 'cliche', 'thriller', 'just', 'movie', 'posters', 'trailers', 'Hip', 'hop', 'T.I', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'have', 'supporting', 'roles', 'film', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Losers', 'RocknRolla', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'Seven', 'Pounds', '2', 'Fast', '2', 'Furious', 'are', 'featured', 'as', 'well', 'four', 'actors', 'are', 'ones', 'see', 'most', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'followed', 'acting', 'career', 'listen', 'hip', 'hop', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'interest', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'round', 'out', 'rest', 'main', 'cast', 'was', 'rather', 'large', 'clamoring', 'amongst', 'fans', 'moviegoers', 'horrid', 'acting', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'were', 'theaters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'then', 'then', 'just', 'know', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'much', 'better', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'certainly', 'had', 'moments', 'mainly', 'Pleasantville', 'Joy', 'Ride', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'room', 'talk', 'either.The', 'biggest', 'struggle', 'Takers', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Remember', 'films', 'revolving', 'bank', 'heists', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Heat', 'Point', 'Break', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Italian', 'Job', 'list', 'one', 'films', 'managed', 'bring', 'something', 'different', 'table', 'least', 'featured', 'something', 'somewhat', 'different', 'appealing', 'make', 'identifiable', 'when', 'presented', 'line', 'bank', 'heist', 'films', 'Takers', 'so', 'similar', 'last', 'year', 'Armored', 'almost', 'pointless', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'first', 'place', 'films', 'contain', 'heist', 'involving', 'armored', 'cars', 'mostly', 'African-American', 'cast', 'even', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'have', 'switched', 'roles', 'comparison', 'two', 'films', ""n't"", 'help', 'featured', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'being', 'film', 'almost', 'seemed', 'Takers', 'was', 'actually', 'cheap', 'combination', 'Losers', 'Armored', 'probably', 'pretty', 'decent', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'Do', 'moviegoers', 'seeing', 'same', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'sure', 'way.The', 'camera', 'work', 'felt', 'incredibly', 'sloppy', 'as', 'well', 'first', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'film', 'felt', 'more', 'nauseous', 'did', 'point', 'Cloverfield', 'way', 'camera', 'spun', 'so', 'quickly', 'so', 'often', 'combined', 'way', 'shots', 'kept', 'zooming', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'was', 'professionally', 'shot', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'film', 'seemed', 'were', 'too', 'close', 'other', 'times', 'camera', 'would', 'zoom', 'out', 'slightly', 'came', 'off', 'error', 'judgement', 'cameras', 'just', 'continued', 'roll', 'camera', 'work', 'just', 'felt', 'very', 'erratic', 'unfocused.This', 'usually', 'part', 'review', 'where', 'try', 'say', 'something', 'positive', 'make', 'compliment', 'sandwich', 'kind', 'deal', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'work', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'fight', 'scene', 'chase', 'involving', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'gun', 'fight', 'Russians', 'are', 'probably', 'highlights', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'probably', 'were', 'four', 'different', 'writers', 'credited', 'film.Takers', 'stale', 'crime', 'thriller', 'A.D.D', 'style', 'film', 'choreography', 'cast', 'aimed', 'specific', 'demographic', 'will', 'likely', 'hurt', 'film', 'more', 'benefit', 'obvious', 'little', 'twist', 'film', 'sticks', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'way', 'film', 'ends', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Whether', 'look', 'Takers', 'action', 'packed', 'crime', 'thriller', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'Takers', 'up', 'short', 'last', 'place']",N/A

1248400,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0021L8V2A,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","An action-packed, adrenaline-driven cops vs. robbers film with an all-star cast!""Takers"" was released in theaters back in the summer of 2010 and features an all-star ensemble cast which includes Matt Dillon, Michael Ealy, Chris Brown, Idris Elba, T.I., Jay Hernandez, Paul Waker, Hayden Christensen and Zoe Saldana.The film is directed by John Luessenhop (""Lockdown"") and features a screenplay written by Luessenhop, Gabriel Casseus, Peter Allen, John Rogers and Avery Duff.  The film featured a budget of $32 million and earned $68 million in the box office.VIDEO:""Takers"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio) and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment's track record of magnificent picture quality continues as the overall look of ""Takers"" is stylish.  The cinematography of capturing Los Angeles  by cinematographer Michael Barrett (""Bedtime Stories"", ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"", ""Bobby"") is wonderfully captured.  Because the director and producers wanted Los Angeles to be like a character in itself, typically when the camera is focused on a character, the background is blurry.  But in this case, both the character and the Los Angeles skyline, various buildings and landmarks are seen clearly through the background.Colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and the detail is impeccable.  You can see the detail when Paul Walker holds his rifle with the sights to the shine on a weapon, the sweat and grime on skin, there is a great amount of detail and overall, this is a wonderful transfer.  I didn't see any artifacting or video blemishes, this is a very awesome looking film on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Takers"" also sports one hell of a lossless soundtrack.  Presented in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, its the lossless soundtrack that truly excels.Due to the amount of action, from gunshots, helicopter explosions, cars crashing into each other, crowd ambiance through the surround channels, there is a lot going on in this soundtrack and it's a very good example of an awesome, immersive soundtrack.  While not top-tier to films with constant action and explosions, there is a good amount of action throughout the film, especially during a scene with a gunfight between the Takers and another group.  That scene really rocked with front and surround channels going crazy and I was impressed.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear through the center and front channels but this is another lossless soundtrack done well!Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Takers"" features the following special features in High Definition, English Stereo and subtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese:** PS3 Wallpaper Theme - If you have a Sony PlayStation 3, you can install a ""Takers"" wall-paper theme.* BD Exclusive: movieIQ (use logo) and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!* Filmmaker and Cast Commentary - A pretty cool audio commentary with Director John Luessenhop, Producers Will Packer, T.I. and Jason Getter.  Intriguing commentary especially how T.I. was very grateful to everyone who was part of the film as he gave a special gift to everyone involved.* Executing the Heist: The Making of Takers - (11:13) The talent of ""Takers"" talk about their characters and producer Will Packer talks about how the film was inspired by the movie ""Heat"".* Take Action! - (10:08) A featurette on the action sequences.  From how Chris Brown did the majority of his stunts, blowing up a helicopter scene and the money truck drop to the sewer.* ""Yeah Ya Know (Takers)"" By T.I. - Promotional Music Video - (4:31) Featuring a Takers promotional video with T.I.'s ""Yeah Ya Know (Takers)"" song.JUDGMENT CALL:""Takers"" is one of those popcorn action flicks that may be derivative and has been compared to ""Ocean's Eleven"".  Well, personally I enjoyed ""Takers"" much more than ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001).  ""Takers"" is a film that balances urban-chic with as the film does showcase Black men, they are not gangsters.  These guys are a criminals that live the good life, are very meticulous when it comes to their planning and in someway, the film manages to make you feel sympathetic for the criminals.Also, the primary difference with ""Ocean's Eleven"" aside from the all-star cast is that ""Takers"" does have its ramifications, not everyone is going to live by the end of the film and personally, it's one of the biggest problems I have had with ""Ocean's Eleven"" is that you want to see some sort of ramification between the cops vs. the robbers.  In this movie, not only is it cops vs. robbers, it features Russian gangsters vs. the robbers and also some double crossing that although not too surprising, you feel content by how things play out and how the film leaves things open for a sequel.I felt the stars of this film had great chemistry.  Idris Elba as the leader, Paul Walker as the right hand man, Michael Ealy, Chris Brown and Hayden Christensen do a pretty solid job.  In fact, it was good to see a more edgier, kick-ass side to Hayden Christensen's character.  Also, surprising was to find out that Chris Brown did many of his stunts for the film and was insistent of it (according to Brown, 96% of the stunts are by him).The cinematography was also worth noting as how the filmmakers are able to capture Los Angeles and its building and landmarks and showing them behind the talent and capturing the city's beauty while the camera is focused on the talent.But as much as I enjoyed ""Takers"", the screenplay does have some problems.  The storyline tries to humanize the character of Gordon Cozier by throwing him a curveball by bringing his addict sister Naomi Cozier to the film.  Personally, I felt this storyline was unnecessary and it draws people away from the action and from the core group.  I understand the filmmakers want to show a side to Gordon that makes you feel sympathetic but I felt that it was unnecessary as it takes Gordon away from ""The Takers"" as he is too preoccupied of where his sister runs off to.Another storyline that I felt was unnecessary was regarding the two investigators played by Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez.  The screenplay tries to showcase the men with their faults and personally, we know that everyone has their own personal faults but as much as the ""Takers"" were a group that have been literally untouchable, it would have been better to showcase the LAPD investigators in a way as fearless and are willing to do all it takes to capture the Takers but the screenplay goes off into a tangent and once again, although the storyline worked, I didn't think it was necessary.You typically want to see the police as strong and as smart as the people they are going against and in this case, the film gave you this no confidence that these two investigators had what it takes to captures these guys.  It was like watching a an old Laurel & Hardy film about how they are always able to outwit the police and police are shown as dumb and inept.  If a sequel is going to be made for this film, at least give the police some credibility.Overall, ""Takers"" is a popcorn action flick that has plenty of balls-to-the-wall action, awesome shootouts and on Blu-ray, the film looks and sounds absolutely wonderful.  But if you are wanting something deep and original, ""Takers"" is not that kind of film.  It's stuck within the banality of other similar-type of films and is more of a popcorn action-flick which has panache, cool cinematography and an intriguing cast of characters.If you are in the mood for an action-based heist film, definitely give ""Takers"" a try!",4,"Blu-ray: A solid presentation on Blu-ray, A popcorn action flick that I enjoyed more than ""Ocean's Eleven""!",1296259200,"01 29,

1248404,A33L7SFHIW03AU,B0021L8V2A,Eric Brown,"[2, 7]","This is basically a music video populated by several young and suave black guys and a couple of their, uh, coworkers, young and suave white guys who hang out in expensive hotels, sip rare whiskey, parade around in suits, and of course, wow the ladies. Occasionally these guys, the ""Takers,"" pull an armed robbery to finance this lavish lifestyle, but what really separates them from old money whiteys is their ability to fly helicopters, plan and execute a sophisticated subterranean drilling operation on municipal property (gasp! - without a permit), perform some serious demolition work, AND throw down feats of daring-do that would put any special forces operator or Olympic-level track athlete or gymnast to shame. There's shooting, explosions, a high body count, vehicular carnage aplenty, and even Matt Dillon, who's done some good work before (i.e., ""My Bodyguard,"" ""Drugstore Cowboy,"" ""Wild Things,"" et al.), so it should be a pretty good movie, right?Not so fast.Dillon's an overworked cop dealing with an Internal Affairs investigation, single parenthood, a corrupt partner (Oops! Did I ruin it?) and, oh yeah, the ""Takers."" He spends the better part of two hours roughin' up suspects, driving around, dodging bullets - well, except for the one he didn't (Damn! Ruined it AGAIN!). Let it be said that particular bullet was a plot necessity - the movie just couldn't (and wouldn't) end without it.""Takers"" is really about bad guys who are actually just decent folk once you get to know them - the kind with strong values, honor and all that junk. They just happen to be in a profession not yet appreciated by mainstream society, so there are no messy moral conundrums to get all bogged down in. Dillon's character, although ethically challenged at times, is a pretty nice guy, too. This brings us to the flick's real conundrum - there are just too darn many good guys to root for! For want of some real bad guys, the filmmakers hauled in some Russians, vicious thugs lacking in humanity (as evidenced by their complete lack of fashion sense) and out to cheat the movie's good bad guys (the ""Takers"") out of the hard-earned fruits of their crimes.Had the ""Takers"" makers been content with just making the music video this movie frequently devolves into, that would have been great, `cause it would have all been over in 3 - 4 minutes. Unfortunately, somebody got clever and added a story, characters, dialogue, attempts at drama, suspense, humor, and yes, even poignancy. The end result? A special effects-driven extravaganza of regurgitated mediocrity identical to 8,000 other crime capers released earlier this week, bereft of anything approaching originality, freshness, excitement or plausibility.

This is by no means a bad movie, but it's nothing you probably haven't already seen any number of times.Here's the scoop. You have a small team of guys who do mostly bank jobs. They're very smart, very professional, very organized and always pull big jobs so they can take a long time between heists and lower their risk of getting caught. One of the crew who was just recently released from the joint coerces them into a rush job that puts everything in jeopardy. Meanwhile, a detective (Matt Dillon) and his partner are slowly but surely closing in on them. So the question is: Will the bad guys succeed in their heist? Will their recently released partner double cross them? Will Matt and his partner spoil things?This sports a very decent cast. There are a lot of names and faces you will recognize. All do a good job, though Paul Walker has surprisingly little to do. It's directed well, shot and edited well and the music score is decent enough. The problem, as I mentioned, is that there really isn't anything new here. The planning, the chases, the internal turmoil all play out in paint by numbers fashion. It needs the type of pizzaz that Guy Richie brings to his movies. But I have to admit that I did like the way all the plot elements panned out at the end.

It is a group written piece (and that shows...), directed by John Leussenhop who specializes in these kinds of noisy thrillers, and packs a cast of well-known actors who with a few exceptions have little character development written for them, making them relay on their screen presence to create credible images.The practiced groups of bank robbers  who are living the good life from previous crimes include Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen, Paul Walker, Chris Brown, and Michael Ealy. A previous member of the gang has just been released from prison - Ghost (Tip T.I. Harris) - who approaches the old gang with a new challenge worth millions and despite some bad omens the gang prepares to make the heist to end all heists: a major problem is that Ghost is double dealing with a group of Russians and that pits two crime syndicates against each other.  Some subplots are present: Idris Elba's sister played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste is recently out of drug rehab and puts a damper on plans; Ghost's old girlfriend played by Zoe Saldana is now Michael Ealy's sweetheart and that churns up problems form the vengeful Ghost; the two cops who have been partners - Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez - face a surprise in Hernandez' past that leaves Matt Dillon alone to fight the heist.The problem with this film is not so much the fact that there is nothing new here - the cast makes it well-worth watching - but that the cinematography keeps the lighting level so dark that it is difficult to follow the action except for the expected fire explosions that accompany it.  It is a technical problem that could have been fixed - and that may have created a better response at the box office, or maybe it is a law of the DVD.

1248414,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0021L8V2A,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[6, 10]","Every time a particular genre or subject matter finds success with moviegoers, another movie of similar type must come along to cash in; no matter how inferior its offering may be in comparison. In 2010, Ben Affleck's second directorial effort, ""The Town"", was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful heist film that has been receiving award nominations left and right. Hot on its heels was the heist film, ""Takers"", but this movie is far less concerned with story, character development, or acclaim. No, this movie's focus is solely on looking hip and stylish.""Takers"" follows a group of thieves as they prepare for the most daring heist of their illustrious career. With only a small window of opportunity, the crew must push their every skill to the limit, and even then, success may prove more difficult than they ever imagined.So, when a film's primary focus is on looking as cool as possible to moviegoers, how good could said film actually be? The answer, at least in this film's case (and in most other similar instances), is...not very good at all.Sure, this movie entertains on some levels, primarily during the various action sequences. That being said, it's hard for anyone to make an action scene be boring in the first place, so that hardly counts. For the majority of its duration, the movie is so full of plot holes, clich&eacute;s, and a general lack of anything resembling character development, that the film simply does not function as a whole.Written by Peter Allen, Gabriel Casseus, John Luessenhop, and Avery Duff (almost all of them first-time screenwriters) the film feels like it's simply a collection of potentially entertaining ideas. The problem is the writers didn't know how to fit all the ideas together or explain their purposes in the story along the way.To start things off, each member of the crew exhibits some unique, and always handy, skill set that will be showcased at one point or another during the film. However, not a single one of these skills are ever discussed in a way for the audience to understand how the particular character came to possess it. I'm not saying that everything a character does within a movie requires exposition. After all some things can, and should, be left to the audience to deduce. But, I don't believe that almost everything should be left up to the viewer's imagination.For example, Paul Walker's character is apparently a skilled sniper (at least that's what we're led to believe), but where did he receive his training? We don't know and the writers aren't telling. Chris Brown's character shows off some parkour climbing during an overly long chase sequence. Perhaps Chris' character learned this ability on the streets? Yet, several of the cops chasing him also seem to be decent at parkour as well. Do they teach parkour at the police academies now? Or maybe it's a whole lot easier than it looks (though I doubt it). Another character is extremely knowledgeable in explosives, but no one ever mentions where he came by his knowledge either.My point is that a line or two of exposition or a flashback to show where they learned these skills would go a long way in making the movie more believable. Instead they all seem like cool ideas someone shouted out during a writer's meeting. I mean are they ex-cops? Former construction workers? Military trained? Scratch that last one, it seems unlikely as most of them don't seem all that disciplined. It's just that the writers need to give the audience more to go on than just a cool concept or skill. After a while some explanation to the viewer is warranted.As far as the various characters' relationships or just their own development along the way are concerned, don't bother searching for anything deep. Believe me, there's essentially nothing beyond the camaraderie amongst the crew, and that's hardly enough to go on. For the most part, there's nothing provided that allows the audience to connect to any of these characters.The one attempt the writers do make towards establishing a connection between the audience and one of the crew members is with Idris Elba's character, Gordon. The writers introduce us to a female in Gordon's life, whom he obviously cares for and is close to in some capacity, and she happens to be in rehab for some problem. Sure, this plot device will engender some sympathy towards his character; however, this whole setup sort of suffers from the same lack of exposition that I mentioned a moment ago.At first you'll feel sorry for Gordon, but then you start to realize you know absolutely nothing about this person in rehab. You don't know how she's related to Gordon or what she's even in for. Not until three or four scenes later, when she's out of rehab mind you, do we receive the answers that would have been handy in promoting the empathy for his character several scenes prior. So, once you receive this important character information, you'll most likely no longer care about the situation, because you didn't receive this knowledge when it was most beneficial to the story.Are you still wondering about those clich&eacute;s that I mentioned? Wonder, no more. They're spread all throughout the film in one way or another, but they are most evident in the portrayal of each and every one of the main characters.To start things off for this ensemble cast we have Paul Walker, an actor that has shown varying degrees of talent throughout his career. There are times he is as stiff and wooden an actor as they come. Other times he sounds like he's from the `hood as he frequently uses street slang, such as; ""G"", ""Bro"", ""Yo, check it!"" and other similarly brilliant colloquialisms of ""thug life"" (of which he most likely has no experience).At one time, I thought Paul was past his stilted acting and slang-ridden talk with his much improved performance from 2009's ""Fast & Furious"". Yet, in this film he resurrects his wooden acting and thug talk, all in one fell swoop. Here, Paul portrays the walking clich&eacute; of the street smart, smooth talking cool guy who appears to be the brains of the operation, but really isn't. His one-dimensional portrayal in this film has prompted me to wonder if maybe his aforementioned improved performance was nothing more than sheer luck.Alongside Paul as the co-leader of the crew of thieves or Takers, as his character so inanely refers to them, is the generally reliable Idris Elba. Idris has shown his capable acting chops in comedic outings on ""The Office"", or nail-biting thrillers such as ""Obsessed"", and a critically praised turn as a detective in ""Luther"".Elba's performance is the strongest one in the film. That being said he is the one who must utter the ridiculous line that goes something like, ""We're takers gents, we take, it's what we do."" Wow, that is brilliant how the writers worked the movie's title into the dialogue like that. Very impressive...oh wait, no it isn't. An actor such as Idris Elba, who is gaining popularity and respect, should maybe think twice before taking on this type of role in a movie that reeks of being nothing more than a paycheck (much like his previous film, ""The Losers"").Appearing in what amounts to be an over-glorified cameo is actress Zo Saldana (""Avatar"") who portrays the love interest for one of the crew members. Most of Zoe's time in the film is spent as the eye candy in the background of a few scenes (I'm not complaining, mind you). Sure, she gets a few lines here and there, but no aspect of her role really seemed vital to the overall story. An actress of her talent was wasted on such a thankless and utterly pointless role.Then there's veteran actor Matt Dillon (""Armored"") who ever since his Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination for his role in ""Crash"", seems to be watching his career slip quietly into mediocrity. Matt portrays a seasoned cop who, as the archetype goes, has seen it all before. Matt's character is clearly burned out with a job that has consumed every aspect of his life. I can't really complain about Matt's performance, he does deliver an understated and convincing depiction of a worn down cop. But, I believe this performance could also be construed as a disguise to cover the boredom on Matt's behalf with acting in these sub-par, clich&eacute;-ridden films of late.Lastly, one of the worst actors in Hollywood, Hayden Christensen (""Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith""), continues his streak of unemotional and uninspired performances. There are moments where Hayden has a chance to break out of his shell and actually not appear so emotionally stunted, but these moments pass him by with nary a breakthrough.Hayden's character of A.J. is the proverbial tough guy with a heart of gold. Behind his character's somewhat effeminate appearance and demeanor lies a fighter at times reminiscent of Jason Bourne. Yet, when he's not cracking skulls or putting a bullet into someone or something, he's playing classical music on a piano to aid in creating the perfect romantic moment for one of his fellow thieves and his girl. Basically, he's the kind of guy that would kill you for getting in his way, and then provide the music at your funeral. Touching, isn't it folks?Despite its numerous drawbacks, ""Takers"" does have one positive working in its favor. Due to the fact that the writers couldn't be bothered to get bogged down by quality storytelling, the movie does move quickly through its one hour and 45 minute running time. By utilizing such quick pacing, I'm sure the hope was that the audience wouldn't have time to recognize all of the problems inherent to the film. Sorry to say, I noticed them, and I know I'm not alone in this. So, to the four writers behind this movie, I have this to say...

1248431,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0021L8V2A,Mark Turner,"[36, 42]","The heist genre has seen a number of films released over the past few years, most notably THE ITALIAN JOB. But there have been a number of others to follow including the recently released TAKERS.The film revolves around a group of professional thieves who are just finishing up from their latest job, a bank job where they scored big and no one got hurt. These guys try to make sure no one gets hurt and that the plans are well thought out and executed. In return for their heists going well, they aren't charged with murder and the money they take makes them wealthy men.As this story unfolds another one opens with the release from prison of Dalonte Rivers (T.I.) aka Ghost. Ghost just finished doing time after being caught in a previous job by this same group. In return for his silence they've held onto his share and kept an opening for him. Returned to collect on that debt, he comes to them with a new job.The group is hesitant to do so having just completed one, but the sure thing information he provides them makes them consider it. The biggest problem is that they have just five days to prepare. And five days not only gives you little time to be ready, but no chance at all to make sure that everything will run as smooth as it has in the past.While the thieves are preparing their new target police officer Jack Welles (Matt Dillon) is searching for them. Assigned the case, he and his partner are following every clue possible. At the same time Jack is dodging an Internal Affairs officer, fearing he will be reprimanded for accusations of excessive violence while apprehending a criminal. His focus is the bank job and he won't be deterred in his pursuit of the crew.The paths of these two sides of the story eventually collide and a chance encounter leads Jack to follow the crew's leader Gordon Cozier (Idris Elba). In following him he's led to the rest of the gang and surveillance places them almost in line to capture them before the next heist. But a smart escape leaves them free to complete their task: the robbery of an armored car loaded with cash.The interplay between characters works well in this film, especially since it involves more than one piece of action. Ghost wants back in to a crew that has changed since he last worked with them, including one of the members now dating his old girlfriend. The crew wants to score big but at the same time is hesitant to trust Ghost, even more so since this job appears out of nowhere and Ghost seems to be rushing into a job immediately upon release.And then there's the story of the dogged policeman in Dillon's character who wants to do nothing more than put bad guys in jail but is hampered by the technicalities that, in his mind, hold him back. But there's more to that story as well.All of these elements combine to make an exciting film filled with more story than most, enough action to keep fans sitting on the edge of their seat and plot twists that keep you guessing until the credits roll. Some may figure it out before then, but even if you do you'll stay focused on the film as the story unfolds.I'll admit I had seen the trailer for this film so many times that I had no interest in viewing it. But I thought I'd at least give it a chance. I'm glad I did as I came across a solid action film that kept me watching from beginning to end never once checking to see how much time was left. If you want exciting action filled entertainment, you'd be hard pressed to find another movie to compare to this one this week.",4,"""TAKERS"" GIVES PLENTY OF ACTION",1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,3505,"['heist', 'genre', 'seen', 'number', 'films', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'most', 'notably', 'ITALIAN', 'JOB', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'others', 'follow', 'including', 'recently', 'released', 'TAKERS.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'group', 'professional', 'thieves', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'finishing', 'up', 'latest', 'job', 'bank', 'job', 'where', 'scored', 'big', 'one', 'got', 'hurt', 'guys', 'try', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'hurt', 'plans', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'executed', 'return', 'heists', 'going', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'charged', 'murder', 'money', 'take', 'wealthy', 'men.As', 'story', 'one', 'release', 'prison', 'Dalonte', 'Rivers', 'T.I', 'Ghost', 'Ghost', 'just', 'finished', 'doing', 'time', 'being', 'caught', 'previous', 'job', 'same', 'group', 'return', 'silence', ""'ve"", 'held', 'share', 'kept', 'opening', 'Returned', 'collect', 'debt', 'new', 'job.The', 'group', 'hesitant', 'do', 'so', 'having', 'just', 'completed', 'one', 'sure', 'thing', 'information', 'consider', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'just', 'five', 'days', 'prepare', 'five', 'days', 'not', 'only', 'little', 'time', 'be', 'ready', 'chance', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', 'will', 'run', 'as', 'smooth', 'past.While', 'thieves', 'are', 'preparing', 'new', 'target', 'police', 'officer', 'Jack', 'Welles', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'searching', 'Assigned', 'case', 'partner', 'are', 'following', 'clue', 'possible', 'same', 'time', 'Jack', 'dodging', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'officer', 'fearing', 'will', 'be', 'reprimanded', 'accusations', 'excessive', 'violence', 'apprehending', 'criminal', 'focus', 'bank', 'job', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'deterred', 'pursuit', 'crew.The', 'paths', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'eventually', 'collide', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Jack', 'follow', 'crew', 'leader', 'Gordon', 'Cozier', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'following', 'led', 'rest', 'gang', 'surveillance', 'places', 'almost', 'line', 'capture', 'next', 'heist', 'smart', 'escape', 'free', 'complete', 'task', 'robbery', 'armored', 'car', 'loaded', 'cash.The', 'interplay', 'characters', 'works', 'well', 'film', 'especially', 'more', 'one', 'piece', 'action', 'Ghost', 'back', 'crew', 'changed', 'last', 'worked', 'including', 'one', 'members', 'now', 'dating', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'crew', 'score', 'big', 'same', 'time', 'hesitant', 'trust', 'Ghost', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'job', 'nowhere', 'Ghost', 'be', 'rushing', 'job', 'immediately', 'release.And', 'then', 'story', 'dogged', 'policeman', 'Dillon', 'character', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'put', 'bad', 'guys', 'jail', 'hampered', 'technicalities', 'mind', 'hold', 'back', 'more', 'story', 'well.All', 'elements', 'combine', 'make', 'exciting', 'film', 'filled', 'more', 'story', 'most', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'fans', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'guessing', 'credits', 'roll', 'may', 'figure', 'out', 'then', 'even', 'do', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'focused', 'film', 'story', 'unfolds.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'interest', 'viewing', 'thought', ""'d"", 'least', 'give', 'chance', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'came', 'solid', 'action', 'film', 'kept', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'never', 'once', 'checking', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'want', 'exciting', 'action', 'filled', 'entertainment', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'movie', 'compare', 'one', 'week']",N/A
1248432,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,B0021L8V2A,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[8, 12]","TAKERS is a very entertaining ""cops-and-robbers"" movie, enhanced with several well-executed action sequences that depend on stunts, rather than CGI.Idris Elba, Paul Walker, Michael Ealy, Hayden Christenson and Chris Brown make up a gang of Los Angeles bank robbers who have been able to pull off some remarkable, big money heists without being caught.  Their luck takes a downward turn when a former associate (Tip ""T.I."" Harris) approaches them with a fantastic deal involving enough cash that the gang will be able to retire.  Now, aside from the cops (headed by Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez) close on their trail, the gang also has to deal with the Russian Mob and a major double-cross by one of their own.Directed by John Luessenhop, the film is cut from the same cloth as Michael Mann's HEAT (1995) in that it takes the audience into the personal lives of the criminals, humanizing them to the point where we almost wish that they will get away with their crimes.The screenplay by Peter Allen, Gabriel Casseus, Avery Duff and Luessenhop contains several surprising plot twists, but also more than one lapse in logic.  For example, in an opening sequence, the gangs robs a Federal bank, which had me wondering throughout the movie, why the LAPD was taking the lead in the investigation, rather than the FBI, which never even makes an appearance in the picture.However, the exciting action scenes, including the spectacular heist on the streets of downtown Los Angeles and a later shootout at Hollywood's Roosevelt Hotel, certainly take you mind off the minor failings of this likable ""popcorn"" movie that is what it is.On the other hand, I sort of felt sorry for the hotel maid at the Roosevelt who was going to have to clean the rooms at the Roosevelt after the gang had finished with them.:-)The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains audio commentary by the producers and director, plus a music video.

1248433,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B0021L8V2A,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[0, 1]","3.5 to 4A crew of thieves plan one of their biggest scores to date, worth millions. Ghost (played by TI), an ex-crew member, has returned after being released from prison, with a plan that seems to be too good to be true. Telling them he can be trusted (after all he never spilled the beans), he informs his old crew that he is willing to let hard feelings go if they simply help him beat the Russians to the heist of a lifetime. While extremely organized and technically savvy, the group devises a plan (in a relatively short time) to beat the Russians to the punch, although they are not sure they should trust Ghost. Perhaps compelled by greed they proceed with their plans to pull off the biggest heist of their careers. The adrenalin and complexity of the plan proves challenging to all involved.There are interesting characters ...... Ghost (played by TI) has lost everything from his woman (played by Zoe Saldana) to his freedom. Gordon Cozier (Idris Elba) is not only concerned about Ghost's return and making money, but has a sister (who is heavily addicted to crack) that he is putting thru rehab. John (played by Paul Walker), Gordon's closest ally, is very reluctant to trust their newly returned crew member but goes with the flow. Jake (Michael Ealy) definitely has a reason to fear Ghost's intentions because he is now engaged to TI's ex, the very sultry Lilly (Zoe Saldana) and thinks its all too convenient. Jesse (Chris Brown), perhaps the youngest crew member, is a rookie whose arrogance leads to some rookie mistakes. Perhaps one of the most overlooked characters, in my opinion was AJ (Hayden Christensen), who surprised you with his cunning and expert fighting and technology skills. Then there is also a devoted, slighted obsessive Detective (Matt Dillon) who has neglected everything because of his job, losing his wife and straining his relationship with his daughter. Not to mention his partner, Eddie (Jay Hernandez) who realizes how precious time with a child can be, especially since his son is suffering from an illness that he would do anything for. The cast of characters work well with each other and are believable in their roles.SPOILER....My biggest complaint was that while entertaining, it was unfortunately predictable. I mean what did they expect......why would they even trust a man who spent time in jail, never told on his crew but knew that they were going on with their lives? Ghost stewed over the fact that not only was he shot during their last heist, but that the crew left without trying to save him. Couple that with his woman not waiting for him (taking up with another crew member), his money hidden and finally being pissed off. Would you really trust him and include him in your plans?? NO. If it had been me, I would have paid him off and cut all ties. Once someone feels betrayed, there is no stopping him from getting revenge, especially if he can get rid of two enemies (or more) at once. So to me, that was unrealistic, unless you believe that pure greed would prevent most from using their commonsense.So while I would say the story is predictable, I didn't mind the journey that resulted in an action packed, fast moving and satisfying conclusion.",4,"Enjoyable, but predictable.",1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,3210,"['3.5', '4A', 'crew', 'thieves', 'plan', 'one', 'biggest', 'scores', 'date', 'worth', 'millions', 'Ghost', 'played', 'TI', 'ex-crew', 'member', 'returned', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'plan', 'be', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Telling', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'never', 'spilled', 'beans', 'old', 'crew', 'willing', 'let', 'hard', 'feelings', 'go', 'simply', 'help', 'beat', 'Russians', 'heist', 'lifetime', 'extremely', 'organized', 'technically', 'savvy', 'group', 'plan', 'relatively', 'short', 'time', 'beat', 'Russians', 'punch', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'trust', 'Ghost', 'Perhaps', 'compelled', 'greed', 'proceed', 'plans', 'pull', 'off', 'biggest', 'heist', 'careers', 'adrenalin', 'complexity', 'plan', 'challenging', 'are', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Ghost', 'played', 'TI', 'lost', 'everything', 'woman', 'played', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'freedom', 'Gordon', 'Cozier', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'not', 'only', 'concerned', 'Ghost', 'return', 'making', 'money', 'sister', 'who', 'heavily', 'addicted', 'crack', 'putting', 'thru', 'rehab', 'John', 'played', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Gordon', 'closest', 'ally', 'very', 'reluctant', 'trust', 'newly', 'returned', 'crew', 'member', 'flow', 'Jake', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'definitely', 'reason', 'fear', 'Ghost', 'intentions', 'now', 'engaged', 'TI', 'ex', 'very', 'sultry', 'Lilly', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'too', 'convenient', 'Jesse', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'perhaps', 'youngest', 'crew', 'member', 'rookie', 'arrogance', 'rookie', 'mistakes', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', 'characters', 'opinion', 'was', 'AJ', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'who', 'surprised', 'cunning', 'expert', 'fighting', 'technology', 'skills', 'Then', 'also', 'devoted', 'slighted', 'obsessive', 'Detective', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'neglected', 'everything', 'job', 'losing', 'wife', 'straining', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Not', 'mention', 'partner', 'Eddie', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'who', 'how', 'precious', 'time', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'especially', 'son', 'suffering', 'illness', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'cast', 'characters', 'work', 'well', 'other', 'are', 'believable', 'roles.SPOILER', '.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'was', 'entertaining', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'predictable', 'mean', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'why', 'would', 'even', 'trust', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'jail', 'never', 'told', 'crew', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'lives', 'Ghost', 'stewed', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'shot', 'last', 'heist', 'crew', 'left', 'trying', 'save', 'Couple', 'woman', 'not', 'waiting', 'taking', 'up', 'crew', 'member', 'money', 'hidden', 'finally', 'being', 'pissed', 'off', 'Would', 'really', 'trust', 'include', 'plans', 'NO', 'had', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'off', 'cut', 'ties', 'Once', 'someone', 'feels', 'betrayed', 'stopping', 'getting', 'revenge', 'especially', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'two', 'enemies', 'more', 'once', 'So', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'believe', 'pure', 'greed', 'would', 'prevent', 'most', 'using', 'commonsense.So', 'would', 'say', 'story', 'predictable', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'journey', 'resulted', 'action', 'packed', 'fast', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'conclusion']",N/A

The four Hispanic blacks and two white males shared the short circuited minds of robbers. In short and fast episodes they could gather plenty of money to live lavish life and support their loved ones. They did good in 101 law: steal money,hurt no one, stay away from the electric chair, space jobs to avoid attention. Going to prison was a risk they took as a price of enjoying the liberty of free living without the burden of a daily demanding job.Once in the underworld of crime, mutual respect between players is the rule of avoiding lethal enemies. Once suspicion rises, murder marches, quickly and mercilessly.One heist was innovative in escaping in a News' helicopter as if the LA Police could not rush one faster than the News channels.  Another heist involved an underground explosion and escape through the sewage tunnels, which also sounded extreme, but smart.The forensic work was the best part in the movie. Spotting actors by their finger signs, hats, ice cream licking, and their walking gaits were all that left with those contemporary thieves.The three movies: Takers, The Town, and Armored, represented their respective cities perfectly. The Takers were Spanish robbers, most probably with military backgrounds. The Town's robbers were white robbers with long family links to the same profession.

The movie looked good, but it gave the appearance that it might end up being just a bunch of guys sitting around trying to look pretty.  Fortunately it rose above this, and was all in all a really good movie.Ive already said that I liked the movie, but let me start by pointing out what I *didnt* like about the movie first.  One thing that stood out to me as implausible was the fact that the movie was centered around this group of super rich, top tier thieves who can do any job (from high rise bank heists, to jewelry store capers, even armored car hits), and if thats not crazy enough they are all best friends who always hang out at the same bar.  I would think that between the exotic cars and the unexplainable IRS filings, this would make for a short lived operation before being caught.  Im not sure who exactly owned the bar, but I believe it was Zoe Saldana's character.  Speaking of..  it was an interesting choice to put her in the role because she has almost no dialogue and barely makes an appearance in the movie.  Im not really complaining, it just feels like a bit of star-power overkill.  On the other hand, I will definitely complain the choice to use 'Tip ""T.I."" Harris'.  Throughout the entire movie he has one way of delivering his performance; standing up straight, one hand on his suit jacket buttons, squinting his eyes, and shrugging his shoulders, all while barely opening his mouth enough to get his lines out.  In a number of cases there just simply wasnt enough character development to make you care as much about the situation as the director wanted.  A few of the scenes felt a bit too much like they were forced in to try and be epic, and you arent 100% sure what happens at the end.Now, all that being said you may wonder why I gave the movie 4 stars.  The reason is pretty simple, the movie grabs you by whatever a movie grabs you by and kept me glued to the screen the whole time.  It kept me nervous to how the outcome of each byplay would turn out.  The truth is that the movie was so engaging that while watching it I only noticed the most glaring issues, and those were only of minor note.  It wasnt until the movie was over and I took a minute to breathe and reflect did I notice some of the points it was lacking.  To me that is the definition of a good movie.  Youll never find a perfect movie; its the movie that makes you so interested that you dont see the downside that is truly a good movie.  To me I felt Takers had less substance than The Town, but had a lot more style.

Filling in the remaining gaps is either what's been pilfered from other cops and robbers flicks or some sub-standard writing, like the thin subplots that lead to nowhere.Takers is supposed to portray a group of experienced thieves who plan their capers well and execute them with precision (not unlike those in ""Heat""), but it's hard to believe that this particular crew would be capable of robbing $5 from a 7-Eleven at 3 am in the morning (even with the improbable assistance of a passing TV news helicopter!).  The minimal dialogue is trite, while the director takes us on a predictable ride, featuring fights and shaky-camera chases through familiar) L.A. locations, inevitably leading to the ""big job,"" an armored car heist, which prompts a fiery gun battle with security guards and police.

Paul Walker and Hayden Christiansen, make the teen-age girls in the audience swoon and cry, but they otherwise catch our notice only in how well their cardboard acting performances fit the one-dimensional characters that the empty script provides, including what Matt Dillon apparently phoned in as the burned-out, over aggressive, veteran detective.In the end, Takers is an attempt to recycle what's found in better movies of the genre, and contains few moments that rise above the elemental level.

In fact Matt Dillion just got lucky to get that close to them at the end lolPoints I enjoyed:*Umm yea hellllo the men!*Hayden C AKA A.J. kicking some butt*Chase scene with the cops and Chris B. AKA Jesse (he was like a monkey!)*The shooting scene between our ""takers"" and the russians*Their RIDES!Points I didn't really like or was WTF about:*When Hayden's character dies...its sad!*Gordon's sister....she just drove me up a wall, didn't care for her at all*When Jake found his gf dead....i'm guessing T.I. kills her.....but why?!?!*The whole Matt Dillion & Jay Hernaandez 's scenes....I didn't really care what they were doing and those were the most boring parts!*I wanted Paul Walker to just kill Matt Dillion for positivity he wont be after them...cuz at the end you really don't know if he survives. If he does you better believe he would come after and find them cuz duh he knows what they look like and all that.Not an Oscar or Academy award winning or anything.

The problem is the lack of originality in everything it does in telling the all-too-familiar story.The five criminals are played by Chris Brown, Hayden Christensen, Michael Ealy, Idris Elba and Paul Walker. To them approaches ""Ghost"" (Tip 'T.I'. Harris), the group's former member recently paroled, and he offers them a job that is worth $30 million. They accept, but with only five days to plan for the heist, and Matt Dillon's LAPD officer closing in on, their ""one last job"" is not going to be an easy one.The stunt is impressive, though almost ruined by the shaky camera. Characters (including violent Russian gangsters) are cardboard types we have already seen somewhere before. Zoe Saldana (""Avatar"") appears in a small role that seems unnecessary. The subplot about Elba's addicted sister (Marianne Jean-Baptiste, ""Secrets & Lies"") adds little to nothing to the main story that takes itself too seriously.With several decent set-pieces, ""Takers"" is not a terrible crime thriller.
