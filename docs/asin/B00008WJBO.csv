Any one has to be crazy to begin with to go beyond the first body. I enjoy solving riddles but would not agree that being murdered just because I was able to solve the path of riddles will show me the the meaning of life. We all know the answer to that one without solving riddles/ going crazy/ being murdered - we all die at the end -  the meaning is in what we do with our life. It's the same concept as the question ""why is what we are looking for always in the last place we look?"" Simple - we found it and therefore have no reason to continue looking.  I watched this movie twice and still can't solve the riddle of why this movie was written/ produced/ directed. Adrian Paul's talent was wasted on this movie - the bleached hair was a real shocker - handsome as ever though. As one fan noted - ""would watch him peeling potatoes."" He is such a good actor that he is able to show an emotion just by his expression and/or body language. One scene comes to mind from the Highlander series when he took the dark quickening.

748573,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00008WJBO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Personally, I hate riddles - but the characters in this movie certainly love them.  College student Sara Novak (Carly Pope) spends her nights wandering through seedy parts of town trying to solve riddles/puzzles assigned to her by her own little riddle guru, comic book store owner Vern (Adrian Paul).  It's all fun and games of course (well, games, anyway - I can't say any of it was fun) until someone gets hurt (or violently murdered).  It turns out that there's a much bigger game in town, one that promises enlightenment to whoever makes his/her way to the end.  Ultimate insight into the Design is not easily won, however - this is a most dangerous game.Vern is none too happy to discover that Sara has started playing the Nemesis game, ostensibly because players either end up dead or stark raving mad (even the winners).  If ever there were a game where nobody really wins, it's this one.  As if the whole concept of the Nemesis game isn't bad enough, watching Sara and Vern go about their riddle-obsessed lives is torturously boring.  The only halfway interesting person in the entire film is one of Sara's classmates who (for reasons I can't fathom) actually finds the young lady mysterious and intriguing, to the point that he is determined to find out what she does at night - the poor dope apparently has no life whatsoever.Maybe this film is meant to serve as a larger metaphor for life - or maybe there's no meaning whatsoever to take away from it.  Personally, I'm going with the latter choice.  With its depressing atmosphere, uninteresting characters, convoluted plot, rather flimsy premise (to my way of thinking), and hackneyed ending, Nemesis Game never succeeded at pulling me in to its cinematic world.  Some may find it to be an interesting, thinking person's film, but I found the whole experience pretentious at best.  Even if you're one of the lucky ones who actually find something stimulating in this whole ordeal, the ending is likely to leave you feeling cheated.  I really don't think your average horror fan is going to enjoy Nemesis Game very much at all; this is really much more of a psychological suspense thriller (with very little suspense and almost no thrills).",2,It's different -- but in a pretentious and boring way,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",2010,2202,"['Personally', 'hate', 'riddles', 'characters', 'movie', 'certainly', 'love', 'College', 'student', 'Sara', 'Novak', 'Carly', 'Pope', 'nights', 'wandering', 'seedy', 'parts', 'town', 'trying', 'solve', 'riddles/puzzles', 'assigned', 'own', 'little', 'riddle', 'guru', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'owner', 'Vern', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'fun', 'games', 'course', 'well', 'games', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'fun', 'someone', 'hurt', 'violently', 'murdered', 'out', 'much', 'bigger', 'game', 'town', 'one', 'enlightenment', 'whoever', 'way', 'end', 'Ultimate', 'insight', 'Design', 'not', 'easily', 'won', 'however', 'most', 'dangerous', 'game.Vern', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'discover', 'Sara', 'started', 'playing', 'Nemesis', 'game', 'ostensibly', 'players', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'stark', 'raving', 'mad', 'even', 'winners', 'ever', 'were', 'game', 'where', 'nobody', 'really', 'one', 'whole', 'concept', 'Nemesis', 'game', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'watching', 'Sara', 'Vern', 'go', 'riddle-obsessed', 'lives', 'torturously', 'boring', 'only', 'halfway', 'interesting', 'person', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'Sara', 'classmates', 'who', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'actually', 'young', 'lady', 'mysterious', 'intriguing', 'point', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'night', 'poor', 'dope', 'apparently', 'life', 'whatsoever.Maybe', 'film', 'meant', 'serve', 'larger', 'metaphor', 'life', 'maybe', 'meaning', 'whatsoever', 'take', 'away', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'going', 'latter', 'choice', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'premise', 'way', 'thinking', 'hackneyed', 'ending', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'never', 'succeeded', 'pulling', 'cinematic', 'world', 'may', 'find', 'be', 'interesting', 'thinking', 'person', 'film', 'found', 'whole', 'experience', 'pretentious', 'best', 'Even', ""'re"", 'one', 'lucky', 'ones', 'who', 'actually', 'find', 'something', 'stimulating', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'ending', 'likely', 'leave', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'average', 'horror', 'fan', 'going', 'enjoy', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'very', 'much', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'almost', 'thrills']",Nemesis Game

It revolves around a shy college student, Sara Novak(Carly Pope), and Vern Stevens(Adrian Paul) who is an older guy who works at a comic book/riddle shop.  Sara and Vern have a passion for games and riddles.  Sara and Vern get involved in a game of the riddles that will eventually lead to the answer to the design of the universe.  One of Sara's fellow students ends up dead and Sara (and Vern) get deeper into the Nemesis Game.  The movie also stars Rena Owen (as Emily Grey who tried to kill a 12 year old boy because it was part of the design), Brendan Fehr, and Ian McShane as Detective Jeff Novak.  The ending is a surprise in this well shot movie done by first time film director Jesse warn (who has directed music videos in new Zeland).  This is a well acted movie that features one of the best performances Adrian Paul has given as an actor.

Carly Pope (First to Die) plays a young girl whose mother was killed in an auto accident; Adrian Paul phones in a performance as a fellow game player with a repulsive tattoo; and Brendan Fehr sneaks in for a small but pivotal role as a spacy game player.  Despite some of the clever riddles, the movie makes little if any sense, and the wonderful character actor Ian McShane is wasted in the role of Sara's father, a policeman.An interesting premise but I hate movies where everything is so ambiguous, you get no payoff.

I liked the photography, especially nice lighting on abandoned buildings etc. The acting was quite okay. For me it was effectively creepy and in that sense engaging.Why was it creepy? Some of the main characters looked like they were on the verge of insanity -- the line was not clear -- and that was portrayed darkly and that is creepy for me. The characters are driven by compulsive curiosity about the riddles and such even though it could get them killed. This sort of risky thing does emerge in human nature, and we all have to learn how to deal with it. Most maybe learn to just not go there. But for others it can suck one into what ends up being dangerous games. Sometimes in life -- especially among the young -- it can looks as though we are surrounded by people compulsively playing games with each other out of curiosity that can get out of hand.That is what resonated with me. If that was ""the point"" of the film I am not sure that it was well presented, so I am reluctant to credit it.Also the sequences in the film seemed to jump around unnecessarily and I found that distracting. But maybe that was me. Still, I enjoyed the film for the photography and tense atmosphere.It was not a cliche of horror and suspense films but did have a provocative psychological element that for me was compellingly presented.I will say that some of the characters were hoping to get out of the game the answer to the riddle of life -- the big one. That can seem corny on the one hand, but on the other there are many people who can probably relate to this the film can remind one of this. People fall into cults and causes right and left!! This game is by no means a conventional cult, though. It consists of players who do not seem to know each other face to face and is much more abstract and not held together by the usual tricks. Personally I thought that this was an interesting idea and would have liked to seen it better explored. If I watch it again I will spend more time trying to decide if there was actually more there than I caught. But right now it seems that one viewing was sufficient.",3,Pretty good,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,2169,"['indy', 'director', 'first', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'worth', 'watching', 'liked', 'photography', 'especially', 'nice', 'lighting', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'etc', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'okay', 'was', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'sense', 'engaging.Why', 'was', 'creepy', 'main', 'characters', 'looked', 'were', 'verge', 'insanity', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'was', 'portrayed', 'darkly', 'creepy', 'characters', 'are', 'driven', 'compulsive', 'curiosity', 'riddles', 'such', 'even', 'could', 'get', 'killed', 'sort', 'risky', 'thing', 'emerge', 'human', 'nature', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'deal', 'Most', 'maybe', 'learn', 'just', 'not', 'go', 'there', 'others', 'can', 'suck', 'one', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'dangerous', 'games', 'Sometimes', 'life', 'especially', 'young', 'can', 'looks', 'are', 'surrounded', 'people', 'compulsively', 'playing', 'games', 'other', 'curiosity', 'can', 'get', 'hand.That', 'what', 'resonated', 'was', 'point', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'well', 'presented', 'am', 'reluctant', 'credit', 'it.Also', 'sequences', 'film', 'seemed', 'jump', 'unnecessarily', 'found', 'distracting', 'maybe', 'was', 'Still', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'photography', 'tense', 'atmosphere.It', 'was', 'not', 'cliche', 'horror', 'suspense', 'films', 'did', 'have', 'provocative', 'psychological', 'element', 'was', 'compellingly', 'presented.I', 'will', 'say', 'characters', 'were', 'hoping', 'get', 'game', 'answer', 'riddle', 'life', 'big', 'one', 'can', 'seem', 'corny', 'one', 'hand', 'other', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'probably', 'relate', 'film', 'can', 'remind', 'one', 'People', 'fall', 'cults', 'causes', 'right', 'left', 'game', 'conventional', 'cult', 'though', 'players', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'other', 'face', 'face', 'much', 'more', 'abstract', 'not', 'held', 'together', 'usual', 'tricks', 'Personally', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seen', 'better', 'explored', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'decide', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'there', 'caught', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'viewing', 'was', 'sufficient']",Nemesis Game

748586,A3TPRIFSQVXY5H,B00008WJBO,"William Neely ""Will""","[16, 21]","Nemesis Game is a smart ""indie"" thriller, with more-than""indie"" qualities. It is the story of a young woman, Sara Novak, who is a college student. Sara (Carly Pope) spends her time at a shop with Vern (Adrian Paul). At this shop Vern and Sara play games and solve riddles. That is the basic premise of Nemesis Game.The acting in Nemesis Game is amazing. Carly Pope is great in this film. Her facial expressions add a lot to the character. Adrian Paul, who I have never seen in anything before, is also a fine actor. He plays the character of Vern very well. Rena Owen plays the insane murderer, Emily Gray. Rena takes this film to a whole new level. Her character is so in depth that I can't picture anyone else playing it. Brendan Fehr is also great, playing the mysterious ""skateboarder,"" but his character has much more to do with the film. Ian McShane is also great as Sara's dad. The supporting cast (including: Jay Baruchel and Vanessa Guy) are also great. I do not think this film could have been better cast. The people in charge of casting this film did a wonderful job.Jesse Warn, first time film director, directed Nemesis Game. He did a wonderful job. He also wrote the screenplay, which is so amazing. I think a director cares more about a film, and how it turns out when they write the script. The producers of this film also do an amazing job.The plot of Nemesis Game plays out very well. So many things that you see in the beginning of the film do not seem important, but later in the film they will play a key role. The plot also has its share of twists, and that is always great in a film. You can never guess what will happen next, and you will probably even have a hard time guessing the answers to the many riddles used in the movie. Nemesis Game has the ability to keep you ""on the edge of your seat"" with suspense.I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great thriller, or just a good movie in general. The DVD also includes ""the making of Nemesis Game,"" The Nemesis Game trailer, full-length commentary by the director and one of the producers, English and Spanish subtitles, trailers for two other great Lions Gate films, and it is presented in widescreen format, which I usually do not like, but the format makes Nemesis Game all the more exiting. If you do not see this film, you must be crazy. I give Nemesis Game 10 out of 10 stars (**********).",5,Good Quality,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,2391,"['Nemesis', 'Game', 'smart', 'indie', 'thriller', 'more-than', 'indie', 'qualities', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'Sara', 'Novak', 'who', 'college', 'student', 'Sara', 'Carly', 'Pope', 'time', 'shop', 'Vern', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'shop', 'Vern', 'Sara', 'play', 'games', 'solve', 'riddles', 'basic', 'premise', 'Nemesis', 'Game.The', 'acting', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'amazing', 'Carly', 'Pope', 'great', 'film', 'facial', 'expressions', 'add', 'lot', 'character', 'Adrian', 'Paul', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'also', 'fine', 'actor', 'character', 'Vern', 'very', 'well', 'Rena', 'Owen', 'insane', 'murderer', 'Emily', 'Gray', 'Rena', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'character', 'so', 'depth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'also', 'great', 'playing', 'mysterious', 'skateboarder', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'film', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'also', 'great', 'Sara', 'dad', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Jay', 'Baruchel', 'Vanessa', 'Guy', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'people', 'charge', 'casting', 'film', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job.Jesse', 'Warn', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'director', 'directed', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'so', 'amazing', 'think', 'director', 'more', 'film', 'how', 'out', 'when', 'write', 'script', 'producers', 'film', 'also', 'do', 'amazing', 'job.The', 'plot', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'see', 'beginning', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'important', 'later', 'film', 'will', 'play', 'key', 'role', 'plot', 'also', 'share', 'twists', 'always', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'never', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'will', 'probably', 'even', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'guessing', 'answers', 'many', 'riddles', 'used', 'movie', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'ability', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'great', 'thriller', 'just', 'good', 'movie', 'general', 'DVD', 'also', 'making', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'trailer', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'director', 'one', 'producers', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'trailers', 'two', 'other', 'great', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'films', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'format', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'format', 'Nemesis', 'Game', 'more', 'exiting', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'crazy', 'give', 'Nemesis', 'Game', '10', '10', 'stars', '**********']",Nemesis Game
