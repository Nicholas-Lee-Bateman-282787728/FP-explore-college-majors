The only complaint I have is the addition of Trisha. She was unnecessary and unwanted esp since Patty Peterson could not act and was more of an annoyance than anything else. I did like the addition of Dave and Midge Kelsey at the beginning of disc 5; I guess I'll have to wait until season 6 to see more of them, they are only in one episode. The funniest episode was the one where Clovis was following Mary everywhere and the havoc that caused. I also liked the house on the hill where Donna went to try to get an old woman to donate to charity and she was held against her will. I couldn't stand the Doddles Weaver episode, I'm sorry but he was just not funny. But overall this is a wonderful show, Donna Reed was never given the props she truly deserved.

And the ""Big Star"" episode, featuring a shy Elvis like singer, and then Shelley Fabares singing the song number ""Big Star"" at the end of this episode. The ""Baby Buggy"" episode, with the gruff elderly woman doctor who has a heart of gold and drives a very small dilapidated old car around town, and who just loves delivering babies, played by the very talented actress Fay Bainter. ""The Makeover Man"" episode about Mary's very ill mannered boyfriend. The ""Pioneer Woman"" episode with Donna and Mary roughing it in a very beat up cabin in the great outdoors. Also, the ""Where The Stones Are"" episode, which concentrates on Donna, Alex, and Jeff who are spying on Mary, and in the meantime, Donna is trying to catch an incredibly gigantic fish which looks more like a whale!!! The ""Mrs. Stone And Dr. Hyde"" episode, where Donna takes over as Alex's Nurse and Alex seems to her to be a Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of personality. Also the episode, ""Everywhere That Mary Goes"" with the guy named Clovis that is built like a house who follows Mary everywhere. And in this same episode, the younger guy named Emory who takes revenge on Mary by putting a 'For Sale Sign' in front of the Stone's house all because Mary doesn't want anything to do with him and refuses to go out with him.

1281776,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B002OOWLPM,"Tante Maren ""Maren""","[28, 29]","With daughter Mary gone off to college, Donna Reed wanted this Season 5 to be the end of The Donna Reed Show. In the Spring of 1963, near the season's end, Donna decided that the work schedule was too long and felt Shelley Fabares' absence would be noticeably missed by audiences, and that the show would drop in the ratings. Luckily for us Donna Reed Show fans, ABC executives felt differently about the show and offered Donna the most lucrative contract that she couldn't turn down. Donna Reed accepted the contract which gave her less episodes per season, meaning a shorter work schedule, which is something she really wanted. Donna was also given a fantastic salary and more creative power over the show's episodes as well. The ABC executives were right in seeing The Donna Reed Show as still being very popular, even with Shelley Fabares' absence, as renewing Donna Reed's contract actually kept the ever-popular Donna Reed Show going on for another 3 seasons.ABC executives replaced daughter Mary Stone with a new little daughter for Alex and Donna- Trisha. Trisha is an orphan who follows the Stone family home from the park, where she watches them and decides she wants to be a part of their family. Trisha's Uncle can see how much the Stone's love his niece, and let's them legally adopt her. Trisha is real life sister to Paul Petersen- Patty Petersen. In the 60's, I recall seeing these shows as a little girl, and couldn't help but wonder what are the odds of the Stone family finding a new daughter who is the spitting image of their son Jeff. When I got older and found out they were real life brother and sister, I knew I already knew that as a little girl, as what are the odds of finding a girl who looks more like son Jeff than his own sister Mary? That part of the show was always something to think about as a viewer back then. Daughter Mary (Shelley Fabares) still made a few shows this season, so she wasn't completely missed, and new daughter Trisha was so popular, she continued on until the last Season 8.Besides a new contract and new daughter for The Donna Reed Show in 1963, the Stone family get new next door neighbors as well. Alex's colleague Dr. Dave Kelsey and his wife Midge find living with in-laws is too suffocating and buy the house next door to the Stone's. Dr. Dave Kelsey played by Bob Crane would be their neighbor until he got his own show Hogan's Heroes in 1965, remaining with the show through seasons 6 and 7. His wife Midge, played by Ann McCrea, would become Donna's best friend, and Midge would remain with the show until the end through season 8, even with the absence of husband Dr. Dave missing in the last season. With new neighbors Dr. Dave Kelsey and wife Midge, a new adopted daughter Trisha, a new contract for Donna Reed and college daughter Mary still in a few episodes, new life came into the show this Season 5 and it's popularity was as high as ever. On March 5, 1963, Donna Reed was awarded The Golden Globe Award for The Best TV Star- Female, showing that ABC executives were right in knowing to talk Donna Reed into not ending the show this season 5 and to go on yet another 3 seasons.The show as always, had some great guest stars this season, featuring Harvey Korman, Candy Moore, Paul Winchell, Tony Owen Jr. (Donna Reed's real life son), Bob Crane, Doodles Weaver, Ann McCrea, Don Drysdale and wife Ginger Drysdale and more. In Episode 6, My Dad, son Jeff sings his hit song to dad Alex titled My Dad. This song was a hit, not on the level as Shelley Fabares' mega hit from last Season 4 Johnny Angel, but Paul Petersen fans loved it, and you will too! Shelley Fabares also sings her B-Side song BIG STAR (A-Side was her Colpix hit TELEPHONE-Won't You Ring?)in Episode 9 titled Big Star. As always, MPI, who include fantastic extra's get a HUGE THANK YOU!, as does the Estate Of Donna Reed, and her wonderful daughter Mary Owen and son Tony Owen Jr., who work tirelessly to get the rights to their mother's shows and put them on dvd for us fans. THANK YOU A MILLION MPI and especially Donna's children!!! This Season 5's Extra Bonus features are worth their weight in gold- NEW conversations with Paul and sister Patty Petersen!!!! You will not want to miss the wonderful stories Paul and Patty tell of working with the cast and crew of this season!!! I hope we get to hear more from Paul, Shelley (was on an earlier season talking with Paul) and Patty on future dvd's!!! Their stories are just wonderful and heartwarming!(And I'm keeping all my fingers crossed for the Estate Of Donna Reed to acquire the rights to give us fans the remainder of the shows Seasons 6, 7 and 8!)Here are the episodes from Season 5:01.) 09/20/1962 MISTER NICE GUY- Donna is suspicious of Jeff's too nice act.02.) 09/27/1962 MRS.

1281777,A33BF8FLZBI59Z,B002OOWLPM,"T.J. Hooker ""Spider""","[4, 4]","I was so happy to have bought Season 3 and 4 of The Donna Reed Show. I think Season 3,4 & 5 were the best. The Season 4 opener with James Darren is my favorite. It featured him singing Goodbye Cruel World and it had a storyline that involved Shelley Fabares having a huge crush on him. Season 5 is also very important to the seris becuase this would be the last year she would appear as a full time cast member. By this time she was all grown up and the storylines would be adjusted t show what a lovely young woman she had become. Iwas a little disappointed by the scree time she had in season 4 compared to the other cast members. It will probably be more of the same for Season 5 because of her moving out to go to college. The other cast members are all good and they all have great chemistry. I look forward to seeing all the episodes for Season 5. My two favorites of Season 5 showcase Shelley's beauty: ""The New Look"" & Where the Stones Are"" are must see episodes if you are a fan of Shelley. She did make three more guest appearances in the last three seasons.",5,Season 5 sadly says goodbye to Shelley Fabares,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,1068,"['was', 'so', 'happy', 'have', 'bought', 'Season', '3', '4', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'Show', 'think', 'Season', '3,4', '5', 'were', 'best', 'Season', '4', 'opener', 'James', 'Darren', 'favorite', 'featured', 'singing', 'Goodbye', 'Cruel', 'World', 'had', 'storyline', 'involved', 'Shelley', 'Fabares', 'having', 'huge', 'crush', 'Season', '5', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'seris', 'becuase', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'year', 'would', 'appear', 'full', 'time', 'cast', 'member', 'time', 'was', 'grown', 'up', 'storylines', 'would', 'be', 'adjusted', 't', 'show', 'what', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'become', 'Iwas', 'little', 'disappointed', 'scree', 'time', 'had', 'season', '4', 'compared', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'Season', '5', 'moving', 'out', 'go', 'college', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'two', 'favorites', 'Season', '5', 'showcase', 'Shelley', 'beauty', 'New', 'Look', 'Where', 'Stones', 'Are', 'are', 'must', 'see', 'are', 'fan', 'Shelley', 'did', 'make', 'three', 'more', 'guest', 'appearances', 'last', 'three', 'seasons']",The Donna Reed Show: Season 5
