Yikes.Season 1 was fresh if long winded.  Season 2 ran into a road block of nonsense.  Season 3 turned the tide with an amazing finale.  Season 4 was a great beginning to the end.  And season 5 made great, if overextended, use of time travel. Save amazing episodes like Dr. Linus and Ab Aeterno, there was precious little to save Season 6 from mediocrity.Overall, I strongly feel the series went one season too many.  A slightly longer season 5 with a couple less filler episodes easily could have taken on this story concept and closed the overall character arcs.  I didn't hate season 6 at all.  But I didn't like it very much either.

1327826,A2VJRRIWONTP9W,B0036EH3X4,"Anime Fan Girl ""animefangirl""","[9, 14]","Like most people, I was completely into this season until the church scene during ""The End"".  My jaw dropped too.  This was practically gift-wrapped as a parallel dimension story and they gave us that?  I agree with another reviewer that said the flash sideways could have been removed.  The island story was definitely more compelling, especially as it became more tragic.  However, there were a lot of questions left unanswered.  What happens to you when you become the landlord of the island?  What is that light and why can it destroy the world?  Why did the smoke monster become a smoke monster?  It just seemed like more time could have been spent on answers instead of the flash sideways that are still making everyone crazy months later because of the show's resolution.Now on to the extras!  I have to start on the missing extras that should have been there.  Considering there are still people who don't understand how the show ended, why wasn't there a commentary on ""The End""?  It seems crazy not to at least get Damon Lindelof on a commentary for it. Also, it was strange not to see ""The Final Journey"" that aired before the finale as an extra.  Maybe it was because the extras were so entertaining that it just feels as if there were too few.  The best by far is the EPILOGUE!  Yes, some of the cast that survived showed up for what happened to some of the characters and even Dharma after the show ended. And yes, I admit, I am addicted to those Dharma videotapes.  ""Crafting the Final Season"" was also a nice feature to say farewell to the show.  If you're a Star Wars fan and have seen History Channel's documentary on the mythos behind Star Wars, ""A Hero's Journey"" will sound very familiar.  ""See You in Another Life,Brotha"" was helpful for anyone, ahem nearly everyone, still scratching their heads about the flash-sideways. It does make you appreciate that, yes, they did maticulously plan out this season.  The commentaries, as always, were quite entertaining.Overall, this was a very entertaining set and remarkable final season.  Few shows get to end on their own terms, and this DVD set will make you appreciate that Lost was one of them.",4,Buy It For the Epilogue!,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2163,"['most', 'people', 'was', 'completely', 'season', 'church', 'scene', 'End', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'too', 'was', 'practically', 'gift-wrapped', 'parallel', 'dimension', 'story', 'gave', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'said', 'flash', 'sideways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'island', 'story', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'compelling', 'especially', 'became', 'more', 'tragic', 'However', 'were', 'lot', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', 'What', 'when', 'become', 'landlord', 'island', 'What', 'light', 'why', 'can', 'destroy', 'world', 'Why', 'did', 'smoke', 'monster', 'become', 'smoke', 'monster', 'just', 'seemed', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'answers', 'instead', 'flash', 'are', 'still', 'making', 'everyone', 'crazy', 'months', 'later', 'show', 'resolution.Now', 'extras', 'have', 'start', 'missing', 'extras', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'Considering', 'are', 'still', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'show', 'ended', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'commentary', 'End', 'crazy', 'not', 'least', 'get', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'commentary', 'Also', 'was', 'strange', 'not', 'see', 'Final', 'Journey', 'aired', 'finale', 'extra', 'Maybe', 'was', 'extras', 'were', 'so', 'entertaining', 'just', 'feels', 'were', 'too', 'few', 'best', 'far', 'EPILOGUE', 'Yes', 'cast', 'survived', 'showed', 'up', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'even', 'Dharma', 'show', 'ended', 'yes', 'admit', 'am', 'addicted', 'Dharma', 'videotapes', 'Crafting', 'Final', 'Season', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'feature', 'say', 'farewell', 'show', ""'re"", 'Star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'have', 'seen', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'mythos', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Hero', 'Journey', 'will', 'sound', 'very', 'familiar', 'See', 'Life', 'Brotha', 'was', 'helpful', 'anyone', 'ahem', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'still', 'scratching', 'heads', 'flash-sideways', 'make', 'appreciate', 'yes', 'did', 'maticulously', 'plan', 'out', 'season', 'commentaries', 'always', 'were', 'quite', 'entertaining.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'set', 'remarkable', 'final', 'season', 'Few', 'shows', 'get', 'end', 'own', 'terms', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'Lost', 'was', 'one']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season
1327827,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B0036EH3X4,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[5, 9]","I am a great fan of the Lost series and I would go so far as to say lost is one of the top five TV series to come out of the last decade, but that was until I saw the last season. Disappointing is one way to put it and let me tell you why, nothing is explained. I do not wish to spoil anything for you if you have not seen the last season however if you like me where hoping to finally get to know what the island is, what the numbers is, why there are Egyptian things all over the island, if you hoped to get an answer to any of the questions you have been sitting with during this six season series, then you are out of luck, they even introduces additional questions in the last season which is not explained either.Now I am not saying that everything in TV series and movies need to be nearly explained and served the watcher on a platter, however the main focus of Lost have always been mystery, the mystery of what is the island and why are the various paranormal things happening, and how is it all connected and when that is not answered in a series with this as a main focus then that is like watching a who done it crime movies and never being told who the murderer is. The characters of Lost get a decent ending to the various storylines about them, but they are never the focus of the show, the mystery is and they fall flat on that.Lost have kept it's viewers interest with promising that just beyond the next bend more of the mystery will be revealed, but when one get to that point new questions are presented instead of answers but with the promise of answers around the next bend again and so on thought the entire series, now this is a great way to make the series exiting and prompt people to keep watching but when that promised explanation never comes at the end as expected, then I at least just felt cheated.Now not all is bad about Lost Season 6, many of the episodes are very exiting, the character interactions is great as always due to the mix of good actors and amazing characters. The last season is more action packed than most of the series and will at time keep you at the edge of your seat. I enjoyed watching this season very much, it is just that for me the sloppy, disappointing ending marred the whole thing, and in turn marred the entire series. I do not know what the creators of the series was thinking when they decided to do things this way.If you are a fan of Lost I do recommend this set as there is so many good episodes, however I would recommend that you just do not watch the last episode and make up your own ending anything you yourself can come up with will be better than the actual train wreck of an ending this show gets.",3,Nothing is ever explained!,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,2675,"['am', 'great', 'fan', 'Lost', 'series', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'lost', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'TV', 'series', 'come', 'last', 'decade', 'was', 'saw', 'last', 'season', 'Disappointing', 'one', 'way', 'put', 'let', 'tell', 'why', 'nothing', 'explained', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'spoil', 'anything', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'last', 'season', 'however', 'where', 'hoping', 'finally', 'get', 'know', 'what', 'island', 'what', 'numbers', 'why', 'are', 'Egyptian', 'things', 'island', 'hoped', 'get', 'answer', 'questions', 'have', 'been', 'sitting', 'six', 'season', 'series', 'then', 'are', 'luck', 'even', 'introduces', 'additional', 'questions', 'last', 'season', 'not', 'explained', 'either.Now', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'everything', 'TV', 'series', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'nearly', 'explained', 'served', 'watcher', 'platter', 'however', 'main', 'focus', 'Lost', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'what', 'island', 'why', 'are', 'various', 'paranormal', 'things', 'happening', 'how', 'connected', 'when', 'not', 'answered', 'series', 'main', 'focus', 'then', 'watching', 'who', 'done', 'crime', 'movies', 'never', 'being', 'told', 'who', 'murderer', 'characters', 'Lost', 'get', 'decent', 'ending', 'various', 'storylines', 'are', 'never', 'focus', 'show', 'mystery', 'fall', 'flat', 'that.Lost', 'have', 'kept', 'viewers', 'interest', 'promising', 'just', 'next', 'bend', 'more', 'mystery', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'when', 'one', 'get', 'point', 'new', 'questions', 'are', 'presented', 'instead', 'answers', 'promise', 'answers', 'next', 'bend', 'again', 'so', 'thought', 'entire', 'series', 'now', 'great', 'way', 'make', 'series', 'exiting', 'prompt', 'people', 'keep', 'watching', 'when', 'promised', 'explanation', 'never', 'end', 'expected', 'then', 'least', 'just', 'felt', 'cheated.Now', 'not', 'bad', 'Lost', 'Season', '6', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'exiting', 'character', 'interactions', 'great', 'always', 'due', 'mix', 'good', 'actors', 'amazing', 'characters', 'last', 'season', 'more', 'action', 'packed', 'most', 'series', 'will', 'time', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'season', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'sloppy', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'marred', 'whole', 'thing', 'turn', 'marred', 'entire', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'creators', 'series', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'decided', 'do', 'things', 'way.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Lost', 'do', 'recommend', 'set', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'episodes', 'however', 'would', 'recommend', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'last', 'episode', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'ending', 'anything', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'actual', 'train', 'wreck', 'ending', 'show']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season
1327828,A3P3CJ76742XBH,B0036EH3X4,Arwen,"[2, 3]","Unlike many viewers, I loved Season 6 and I watch it regularly to remind myself how to be and what to expect in my own life's adventure. Why do I see this season so differently from so many others? (Or, for that matter the whole series.)First of all, Lost was never meant to be taken literally.  It's the hero's story, pure and simple, following in the vein of Joseph Campbell. The producers make this point in one of the ""behind the scenes"" interviews.  Such stories are written to present life issues to us in a way we can learn and grow, all while being entertained.  In Lost, however, we have something like 14 heroes to watch and learn from.  There is some little part each of these characters in each of us. Who, for example, hasn't felt as totally lost in life as Jack does in The Lighthouse; as demoralized by past events that one regrets as Sayid; as scared by the whole experience as Hugo?  Who doesn't feel that he's going along life's path not knowing exactly where he's going or why, but embracing the experience anyway?  From the Year One shot of people on the beach after the crash onwards, every scene contains life lessons we can learn from.  I have watched each one go thru his/her trials and have compared their experiences to events my own life -- and I have learned from them. Each character mirrors some part of me and I see how I look.Secondly, many have objected to the ""alternate"" story -- what might have happened had the plane not crashed.  Haven't we all wondered how something MIGHT have gone had something else not intervened?  The writers get to point out that we all carry with us characteristics that haunt us until we overcome them, as we see when Ben tries to take over his principal's job -- there's still a bit of the angler in him that he must rise above.  And, we get to see Ben finally redeem himself when he chooses in favor of Alex over the principalship and when he chooses to stay ""in life"" to work out his relationship with Alex and her mother.  None of these points could be made so well without that alternate story.And, from a still different perspective, is there really ""death""?  Is there really time and space?  Einstein wrote that they were a delusion, and modern science is corroborating what he said.  Alternate versions of the story destroy the ""only-ness"" of any one of the versions. Each version is just that -- another version.  And, there's always another one.  Existence becomes holographic.As for the ending in the church, much of the material presented here has been written about by people who have experienced ""near death"" and by many who are investigating what ""life"" and ""death"" really are.  Are they what they seem to be?  Is there ever really life and death? Or, do they reflect one's limited perspective?  And, for those who've studied the issue of reincarnation, this scene certainly brings it up.Frankly, I thought the idea of presenting alternative ""versions""of the story, jumping time periods, and presenting scenes in a non-linear order was absolutely brilliant. They may have come as close as one's likely to come to presenting the universe as the holograph some now believe it to be.Finally, even though the background story of Jacob and the Man in Black seems to interrupt the flow of events, these beings have been too crucial to the story for us not to know their history. Granted, this episode seemed to interrupt, but to tell it any sooner would have explained too much too soon, and it couldn't have been placed any later.  If anything other than the story of our heroes is important to this story it's Jacob and his brother -- the man of hope and the nihilist.Personally, I applaud the creators for such an intelligent work of art.  The story and points made have given me an understanding of life I feel I never quite got growing up - and I wish I had. I know who I want to be like, and who I don't want to be like.  Anyone really want to be Shannon screaming on the beach?  Or Neil pitching his ""fire"" fit?  Who would you want to be like?  How do you want to be seen handling life?  Thanks to Lost, I'm reminded that when life upends me, it's really no different from  Kate and Jack being ""netted"" while on the path to somewhere.  Any unexpected ""turn of events"" is what makes life an adventure. Life IS really very much like being in a jungle on a mysterious ""island"" somewhere in space, and we walk the path thru the jungle of life never knowing what's coming next. But, all that ultimately counts is HOW we take whatever comes.And, that's what our heroes ended up doing. The island exacted a huge price from each of them, but look at what they became in return. Each ended up being so much more than he/she was at the beginning. Even Ben gets redeemed! And, that's what we are intended to do: to give our very best to life no matter the cost. To be like Sun, letting her tragic lot play out without bitterness. Or like Charlie, giving his life willingly to help his friends.  Or, like Juliet with her life repeatedly dashed to pieces going on gracefully anyway. Or, finally, like Jack, giving his life willingly to achieve humanity's safety. And, having done so he could indeed depart in peace with a smile because he had achieved a noble purpose - a purpose worth living and dying for. Would that each of us could do so well.So, I suggest viewers take Lost like a fine French impressionist painting where what is is only hinted at, and nothing that seems to be is ever quite so. Don't expect Lost to be a Law and Order type of story. It's the hero's story, meant to entertain and to teach, to teach us all how to live, and it has done both superbly well.As a final note -- one simply has to see the series 3-4 times for many of the fine points to become apparent.  This is as richly detailed a story as a Shakespearean play.  It's small wonder it's being studied by groups to this day.",5,Lost and Life -- the hero's story,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,5874,"['many', 'viewers', 'loved', 'Season', '6', 'watch', 'regularly',

1327829,A2VMT89TCSF105,B0036EH3X4,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[8, 19]","Why is everyone complaining about the last episode of ""Lost""? Honestly, how did you think it would end? A weird, innovative and complex series like ""Lost"" obviously needed a weird, innovative and complex last episode!Personally, I got it. The alternative timeline was in the future, when all the characters had died and their souls gathered in a waiting room to Heaven. I suppose Christian Shepherd's name and empty coffin was an allusion to the resurrection of you-know-who. The other episodes of the last season answered other pressing questions: Where did Jacob and the Man in Black come from? How did Richard get to the island? Not a bad finale, all things considered.The main problem with ""Lost"" is that, frankly, the people behind it came dangerously close to loosing it. For starters, the series was too long. The same story could easily have been told in just four seasons. Or even less. After a while, the story became unwieldy in the extreme, with all the subplots and supplementary characters, many of whom were of little interest. Frankly, who cares about Charlotte? The constant jumps back and forth in time became involuntary comic relief after about the dozenth jump. Obviously, it became impossible to answer all the questions raised by these complexities. But then, this was obvious to discerning viewers already three years ago... My favourite meaningless question never answered was: Why did Mr. Eko build a church? And why did good ol' Smokie kill him?Well, who knows? ;-)So why did I keep watching ""Lost"", despite knowing that all the loose ends would never be tied up? I think it was the splendid actors and the intriguing characters with their weird life stories. In fact, the flashbacks were often more interesting than the actual story of the island! Who can forget John Locke being conned by his own father, the long cons of Sawyer, the ugly, crazy and lovable Hugo Reyes, or the beautiful and homicidal Kate? Then there's Lapidus, the pilot who looks like a guy from a Burt Reynolds movie, fished out of the water just at the right time for the grand finale. Is that a continuity error?Despite not answering EVERYTHING, I do believe ""Lost"" somehow found itself in this last season.All in all, not a bad show.Now, I'm off to see Jacob, LOL.",5,Lost and found,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,2266,"['Why', 'everyone', 'complaining', 'last', 'episode', 'Lost', 'Honestly', 'how', 'did', 'think', 'would', 'end', 'weird', 'innovative', 'complex', 'series', 'Lost', 'obviously', 'needed', 'weird', 'innovative', 'complex', 'last', 'episode', 'Personally', 'got', 'alternative', 'timeline', 'was', 'future', 'when', 'characters', 'had', 'died', 'souls', 'gathered', 'waiting', 'room', 'Heaven', 'suppose', 'Christian', 'Shepherd', 'name', 'empty', 'coffin', 'was', 'allusion', 'resurrection', 'you-know-who', 'other', 'episodes', 'last', 'season', 'answered', 'other', 'pressing', 'questions', 'Where', 'did', 'Jacob', 'Man', 'Black', 'come', 'How', 'did', 'Richard', 'get', 'island', 'Not', 'bad', 'finale', 'things', 'considered.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Lost', 'frankly', 'people', 'came', 'dangerously', 'close', 'loosing', 'starters', 'series', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'same', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'just', 'four', 'seasons', 'even', 'less', 'while', 'story', 'became', 'unwieldy', 'extreme', 'subplots', 'supplementary', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'little', 'interest', 'Frankly', 'who', 'Charlotte', 'constant', 'jumps', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'became', 'involuntary', 'comic', 'relief', 'dozenth', 'jump', 'Obviously', 'became', 'impossible', 'answer', 'questions', 'raised', 'complexities', 'then', 'was', 'obvious', 'discerning', 'viewers', 'already', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'My', 'favourite', 'meaningless', 'question', 'never', 'answered', 'was', 'Why', 'did', 'Mr.', 'Eko', 'build', 'church', 'why', 'did', 'good', 'ol', 'Smokie', 'kill', 'Well', 'who', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'keep', 'watching', 'Lost', 'knowing', 'loose', 'ends', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'think', 'was', 'splendid', 'actors', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'weird', 'life', 'stories', 'fact', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'often', 'more', 'interesting', 'actual', 'story', 'island', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'John', 'Locke', 'being', 'conned', 'own', 'father', 'long', 'cons', 'Sawyer', 'ugly', 'crazy', 'lovable', 'Hugo', 'Reyes', 'beautiful', 'homicidal', 'Kate', 'Then', 'Lapidus', 'pilot', 'who', 'guy', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'movie', 'fished', 'water', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'grand', 'finale', 'continuity', 'error', 'not', 'answering', 'EVERYTHING', 'do', 'believe', 'Lost', 'somehow', 'found', 'last', 'season.All', 'not', 'bad', 'show.Now', ""'m"", 'see', 'Jacob', 'LOL']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

1327837,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0036EH3X4,B. Martin,"[5, 14]","When Lost finally wrapped up its final season back in May, the realizatiion of just what the show's creators had managed to accomplish was not immediately apparent.  Lost did not provide a mythology heavy, ""aha, so that's what it all means"" resolution that pulled all of the mysteries and plot threads from the prior seasons together in a way that suddenly made everything crystal clear.  No, what this series had accomplished was something much more remarkable.  When the show's title flashed on that solid black background for the final time, the series had come full circle; bringing the audience back to where this amazing journey had started.  Lost's creative team had managed to construct a self-contained story arc that spanned 6 seasons, tackled huge themes, built a complex mythology, provided some of the most memorable and complex characters in the history of the medium and incorporated elements of science fiction and fantasy.  They also did something even more daring and incredible.  They risked critical and fan backlash by ending the series with a finale that appeared to be far too simple for the labrynth of mysteries leading up to it and refused to provide clear cut and easily identifiable answers to those mysteries.  Say what you will about the final season of Lost, (and many have) but the writer's ended things on their terms. By doing so, they created something rarely seen on television:  an ambitous work of art that is built to stand the test of time.For those who haven't seen the final season, I won't provide any spoliers regarding the plot.  Things pick up following the detonation of the hydrogen bomb by Juliet at the end of Season 5.  The purpose of this act was to change the past and make it so that Oceanic 815 never crashed on the island and all of the suffering and loss experienced by the survivors could have been avoided.  Right off the bat it appears that the detonation was successful.  We are taken aboard flight 815 in the opening scenes of the first episode, ""LA X"" where it appears that the Losties are en route from Sydney to Los Angeles just as they were at the beginning of the series and none of them seem to know each other or have any knowledge of the events that occured prior to the explosion.  But there are some noticable differences.  Jack has a scar on his neck, Charlie has short hair, Desmond is on the plane and we learn that Hurley considers himself the luckiest guy in the world.  What exactly is going on here?  Before we can even begin to theorize on that, the action shifts to the island where it turns out the bomb didn't work.  Instead, the explosion has propelled Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, Sayid, Jin and Juliet from 1977 to the present where they must confront John Locke, or whoever has taken his form, who is recruiting people in an effort to leave the island once and for all.Season 6 jumps back and forth between these two realities (the scenario in which 815 never crashed is referred to as the flash-sideways) as it moves toward the end.  On the island some of the shows key mysteries are answered.  We learn what the numbers mean, why the Losties were brought to the island, the true nature of the island, what the smoke monster is, how Richard Alpert ended up on the island and why he never ages and who the skeletons in the cave from Season 1 are.  All the while, our heroes must decide whether they will join Locke in his attempt to leave or if they will take a leap of faith and stand against him.  Meanwhile, in the flash sideways, we watch as 815 lands safely in Los Angeles and the characters begin to go their separate ways only to find themselves crossing paths with each other again.I think it's fair to say that this is the most complex and challenging season of Lost.  The pacing is considerably slower than in prior seasoons and the epidoses are much more devoted to character development and thematic elements than with the mythology and mysteries.  The result can feel like a season that is disconnected from the prior five, but the ties to the rest of the series are there.  Season 6 explores the larger themes of fate vs. free will, science vs. faith, destiny, redemption, relligion and love that have always been at the forefront of the series.  The flash sideways in particular is rich with these themes as well as the recurring motiff of mirrors.  This is important since the characters do a lot of reflecting on their pasts and their flaws. Events in the flash sideways also mirror those on the island while the season itself mirrors Season 1 in terms of the focus on character and theme.As for the finale, it is a work of sheer beauty and genius.  It is deeply moving and satisfying;  tragic yet hopeful, happy yet sad and most importantly, it provides an ending as well as a beginning.  This is not only the case for the characters, but for the viewers as well since the show encourages us to go back to the start and take the journey all over again because as much as we think we know about the island, the characters and the mysteries, there is still more to be learned.  There will always be more to learn and Lost will always exist for current fans as well as future generations who want to take the journey.  In the end, that's what Lost was always about:  understanding that the answers are not always easily obtainable and that you have to work for them.  And your answers may not be the same as the next person's.  That's quite an accomplishment for any work of art, and Lost was without question a work of art.  John Locke said it best:  ""We're going to need to watch that again.""",5,Full circle,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,5595,"['When', 'Lost', 'finally', 'wrapped', 'up', 'final', 'season', 'back', 'May',

1327838,A1RU9252PRKIGT,B0036EH3X4,Bones,"[26, 42]","I recall exactly how I felt right after I completed watching the first season of Lost.  I knew without a doubt that I had just watched the BEST show on network television EVER.  Needless to say I was a true, die-hard FANATIC of the show (especially for the first two seasons).  I was completely in love with this show and preached LOST to everyone I know because I followed it religiously.  The mystery, drama, action, suspense, story, acting, characters, plot-twists, flow, were all more than superb.  Every single episode I tried to find mistakes, I tried to find something that the writers did wrong and I couldn't find it; everything was just PERFECT and nothing made me happier.That perfection was destroyed in Season 6.  Everything that had made this show the marvel that it was had been replaced with the nonsense and disgrace that is Season 6.  After watching the final episode, I literally felt like throwing my HDTV out the window never to watch it again.  Words cannot express the pure hatred I feel towards this final season and its finale.  Plain and simple it's PURE, STINKIN' GARBAGE.  Every relevant and deep mystery remained exactly that.  Absolutely nothing crucial was ever answered.  Even worse, MORE mysteries were introuduced in season 6 that weren't even going to be answered by its conclusion.  I mean really, THE FANS OF LOST COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SEASON THAN THIS.  Thanks to these writers,  I WILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER NETWORK TV SERIES EVER AGAIN.

1327841,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B0036EH3X4,brainout,"[1, 2]","To understand LOST, you need to start with Season Six, Episode 15.  Then, go back to Season 1, Episode 1.Light=Life source protected, kinda like Garden of Eden post-Fall.  Explains the storyline of LOST.  Else, it will be very hard to cope with the extensive disinformation about this series in the minds of its many viewers, who mistake it for afterlife and sideways-time-travel (which doesn't exist).Theme here is set for a fusion of Greek-god-style mythology, and modern scientific ideas about life and light as what gives life.  In science and modern New Age (nee: gnostic) ideas, speculation is that somehow there are energy sources combined with magnetism which somehow gave rise to life.  In LOST, the idea is that these sources are placed around the world, all around some 'center' that feeds them all.  Further, that you can travel in TIME.  Whether or not you can actually redo or change life as a result, is another issue explored in the series.So Season Six Episode 15, posits the Greek-god version, because by Season Six, you've already been exposed to the so-called 'scientific' concepts of light, magnetism, spacetime, etc.  The whole goal of LOST is to show some fusion of science and faith, leaving it up to the viewer, how he concludes.  You're not beat over the head with one idea of faith or science;  the writers leave out a lot of the details, therefore, so you can put the pieces together yourself.This much of the plot I can say, without giving the show away:  in the beginning, there was Light and Smoke.  The latter was trapped by the former, and neither could directly kill the other, so each 'invited' people to the island on which both resided.  The Light wanted to benefit the people and have them protect it from other people.  The Smoke wanted to encourage people to kill the Light, so the Smoke could escape.  But if it escaped, it would kill everyone.That's kinda how Greek mythology goes.  Personifying everything seen in nature, and also personifying virtues and vices.  Greek drama always aimed at showing that human life was an extension of the various relationships and struggles between 'the gods'.  But in LOST, this and Episode 9 are the only Episodes dealing directly with that theme.  Episode 15's script is kinda trite, it's faithful to Greek drama (whose script was always melodramatic on purpose, anyway).  Watch it first and then 9, if you want a fuller sense of the plotlines, prior to beginning at Season One, Episode 1;  from there on, watch sequentially.LOST is meant to beg the question of why you are here.",5,"Watch Season Six Episode 15 FIRST, then Season 1",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,2560,"['understand', 'LOST', 'need', 'start', 'Season', 'Six', 'Episode', '15', 'Then', 'go', 'back', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '1.Light=Life', 'source', 'protected', 'kinda', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'post-Fall', 'storyline', 'LOST', 'Else', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'cope', 'extensive', 'disinformation', 'series', 'minds', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'mistake', 'afterlife', 'sideways-time-travel', ""n't"", 'exist', '.Theme', 'here', 'set', 'fusion', 'Greek-god-style', 'mythology', 'modern', 'scientific', 'ideas', 'life', 'light', 'what', 'life', 'science', 'modern', 'New', 'Age', 'nee', 'gnostic', 'ideas', 'speculation', 'somehow', 'are', 'energy', 'sources', 'combined', 'magnetism', 'somehow', 'gave', 'rise', 'life', 'LOST', 'idea', 'sources', 'are', 'placed', 'world', ""'center"", 'Further', 'can', 'travel', 'TIME', 'Whether', 'not', 'can', 'actually', 'redo', 'change', 'life', 'result', 'issue', 'explored', 'series.So', 'Season', 'Six', 'Episode', '15', 'Greek-god', 'version', 'Season', 'Six', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'exposed', 'so-called', ""'scientific"", 'concepts', 'light', 'magnetism', 'spacetime', 'etc', 'whole', 'goal', 'LOST', 'show', 'fusion', 'science', 'faith', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'how', ""'re"", 'not', 'beat', 'head', 'one', 'idea', 'faith', 'science', 'writers', 'leave', 'out', 'lot', 'details', 'therefore', 'can', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'yourself.This', 'much', 'plot', 'can', 'say', 'giving', 'show', 'away', 'beginning', 'was', 'Light', 'Smoke', 'latter', 'was', 'trapped', 'former', 'could', 'directly', 'kill', 'other', ""'invited"", 'people', 'island', 'resided', 'Light', 'wanted', 'benefit', 'people', 'have', 'protect', 'other', 'people', 'Smoke', 'wanted', 'encourage', 'people', 'kill', 'Light', 'Smoke', 'could', 'escape', 'escaped', 'would', 'kill', 'everyone.That', 'kinda', 'how', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'Personifying', 'everything', 'seen', 'nature', 'also', 'personifying', 'virtues', 'vices', 'Greek', 'drama', 'always', 'aimed', 'showing', 'human', 'life', 'was', 'extension', 'various', 'relationships', 'struggles', ""'the"", 'gods', 'LOST', 'Episode', '9', 'are', 'only', 'Episodes', 'dealing', 'directly', 'theme', 'Episode', '15', 'script', 'kinda', 'trite', 'faithful', 'Greek', 'drama', 'script', 'was', 'always', 'melodramatic', 'purpose', 'anyway', 'Watch', 'first', 'then', '9', 'want', 'fuller', 'sense', 'plotlines', 'prior', 'beginning', 'Season', 'One', 'Episode', '1', 'watch', 'sequentially.LOST', 'meant', 'beg', 'question', 'why', 'are', 'here']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

Season 6 dives into the what-if and explores the lives of our oceanic 815 survivors through flash-sideways. It was a unique opportunity to see how much the characters would change and how they would come in contact with each other if 815 never crashed. Personally every episode with the exception of ""What Kate Does"" was awesome in that characters were given the chance to address their many flaws and finally let go of their hang-ups. I think what many people fail to grasp is that Lost has always been a character study about the human condition and all the sci-fi stuff was a way to explore that subject. In the grand scheme of things the mythology, polar bears, electromagnetism, etc. was never the point it was about people, humanity in general. Like Carlton and Lindelof have stated in the past they spent 10% of their time talking about mythology and the other 90% was spent talking about their characters in the writer's room.

I wasn't even that hacked at the series finale - although I do contend that you could tack on the 'going into the light' nonsense onto any ensemble show with similar results.  But the sixth season is really a mess and doesn't come anywhere near the quality of the seasons before it.  From the meandering episodes at the temple (where more unresolved mysteries are introduced needlessly) to the muddled origin story of Jacob and the MIB, this season reeks of lazy writing (or is it tired of writing?).In some ways, I like to think that LOST should have ended with season 5.  Nothing would have been resolved and we would have, ala Twin Peaks, a show with questions that would never be answered but at least the viewers would know that the creators didn't WILLFULLY chose to leave them hanging.  As it stands, season 6 answered nothing and added nothing to the preceding five seasons and that is why it ultimately taints the series as a whole.  I think I'll pull a Jack and erase the last season from existence.(Also, I hear they have created a 15 minute short for this DVD that is supposed to answer questions.  I've heard rumors that the writers left everything unanswered so ABC could have a STAR WARS-like cash-cow for 'expanded LOST universe' books and so on.  To anyone who defends this, I would ask them to remember that The Stand didn't need a bunch of short stories to resolve its narrative.)",1,LOST is better if you pretend it was cancelled after Season 5 finale,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1467,"['Listen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'LOST', 'nut', 'airing', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'hacked', 'series', 'finale', 'do', 'contend', 'could', 'tack', ""'going"", 'light', 'nonsense', 'ensemble', 'show', 'similar', 'results', 'sixth', 'season', 'really', 'mess', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'quality', 'seasons', 'meandering', 'episodes', 'temple', 'where', 'more', 'unresolved', 'mysteries', 'are', 'introduced', 'needlessly', 'muddled', 'origin', 'story', 'Jacob', 'MIB', 'season', 'reeks', 'lazy', 'writing', 'tired', 'writing', '.In', 'ways', 'like', 'think', 'LOST', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'season', '5', 'Nothing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'would', 'have', 'ala', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'show', 'questions', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'answered', 'least', 'viewers', 'would', 'know', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'WILLFULLY', 'chose', 'leave', 'hanging', 'season', '6', 'answered', 'nothing', 'added', 'nothing', 'preceding', 'five', 'seasons', 'why', 'ultimately', 'series', 'whole', 'think', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'Jack', 'erase', 'last', 'season', 'existence', 'Also', 'hear', 'have', 'created', '15', 'minute', 'short', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'answer', 'questions', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'rumors', 'writers', 'left', 'everything', 'unanswered', 'so', 'ABC', 'could', 'have', 'STAR', 'WARS-like', 'cash-cow', ""'expanded"", 'LOST', 'universe', 'books', 'so', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'ask', 'remember', 'Stand', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'bunch', 'short', 'stories', 'resolve', 'narrative']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

I loved almost every minute of the first five seasons.  Even when the show would take slight detours (i.e. Nikki and Paulo), I had confidence that Damon and Carlton would steer us all towards a satisfying ending - one that answered the most important questions and an ending that would have us all talking profounding about for years to come.  As we all know, this did not happen.  Season 6, though, did have some shining moments.  Richard's episode was amazing and every second of Desmond and Sawyer were great.  Some of the answers were satisfactory (the whispers and numbers), but after six seasons we were all expecting something mindblowing.  Oh well.  The last episode, though having all the time to plan for it and promises that Damon & Carlton always knew how to end the show, clunked towards a sloppy and unsatisfying conclusion.  I won't spoil it for you except to say that the dog, Vincent, obviously eats Jack Christian in the end :)  So while I will re-watch the show at some point for all of its many great episodes, the ending will remain a sore spot in my heart as well as countless other faithful followers who shouldn't have listened to the promises of its creators (who only knew the series would end with an eye closing).

By saying that, I did enjoy this sixth season and loved the finale.  But again, I've debated this enough on ""The Fuselage"" and other forums to know that this series and its finale has striked a chord among the viewers (positive and negative).  Here is my feelings of the overall Blu-ray release of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" (note: Didn't find many easter eggs this time around on the BD release).VIDEO:""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" is a series that looks incredible on High Definition. Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly. The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean. Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception. This final season's offering continues its wonderful presentation on Blu-ray. You can see the skin pores much more closely, even the stubble or sweat on the faces of the characters, the mucky water, detail of the plants in the dense jungle, the rocky earthtones, the brownish/reds inside the Dharma buildings and just regular objects, the stained blood on the skin of the characters, you can actually see that the blood is actually dry and much, much more.There is a lot of detail that you just don't see on television and when you see it on Blu-ray, especially for ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"", you can't help but be amazed. The colors are just fantastic as blue oceans and blue skies are surrounded by beautiful lush greenery. Blacks are nice and dark and skin tones are natural.Another wonderful presentation of ""Lost"" on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1. The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle. This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season. Also, sounds of the smoke monster and the growls to the ambiance of the island, explosions, earthquakes, the chanting  of the voices of the island and if anything, they really went all out in destruction and chaos with this latest season.Audio comes quite clear through the various surround channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE. Dialogue is crisp, clear and understandable and the music also comes out alive during certain scenes.I love how the music for the series sounds and how it really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome. So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!  So, once again, ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" delivers in lossless audio.  Fantastic!Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Blu-ray edition of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.

Meeting new friends and debating topics that I have never done with a TV series before, it was just a fantastic ride with its ups and downs and each episode just capturing my attention and for the most part, just embracing everything that had come out.  From the audio books, the web episodes, the videogame,  the podcasts, the magazine, you name it...I was loving every minute of ""Lost"" and what the writers had to provide for us.And then it came to this final season and I admit that the flash-sideways episodes were a bit confusing.  In fact, I was wondering where this was all heading and right after each episode, I would head to the Fuselage to see how everyone else was interpreting these flash-sideways storylines.  Was I missing something?  Was I not enjoying these flash-sideways as much and I was more into the original timeline?But the more we got into the series and to see how Desmond had this connection between the two timelines, I just started to have this silly grin on my face while watching this series because we had a sense that Desmond had to play an important part in this series and then things slowly started to unravel.But then the original timeline also started to unravel and we didn't know who would turn evil, we don't know what would happen with Sayid and what will happen between Jack, Kate and Sawyer.  And for me, I was so happy to see Jin and Sun back together but then to find myself devastated and sad after watching ""The Candidate"" where favorite characters we have followed for years, were killed off.  We knew something was going to happen, we just didn't know who.  And I admit, I was so bummed out, it affected me the day after.And then it was time for the final episode and I just felt it was the most fantastic ending for a series on television that I have seen.  Granted, the final episode had a lot to do with faith and if anything, your appreciation for the series as a whole.  I found myself going online and having to explain the finale to so many people.  But it was quite interesting to read of how the finale affected people.  Many, like myself, who absolutely loved it and then those who were upset with the finale and a lot of loose ends not being tied up.And here we are with the Blu-ray release of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"".  Hyped by many publications and even brought up on the night after the finale on the Jimmy Kimmel ""Lost"" special about how Executive Producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof will tie up those loose ends on the Blu-ray and DVD release.  So, needless to say, many fans of the series have been awaiting this release.  And with all said and done, the 12-minute epilogue was satisfying.  It may not answer all questions but it does answer the question that relates to Walt (and also the polar bears).Like every previous release of ""Lost"" we are treated with a good amount of special features.  I wish there were more audio commentary featured (especially for the final episode) and I wish the web episodes or even the Jimmy Kimmel special was included on this Blu-ray but overall, you do get many special features like the previous season box sets and you also get the latest version of ""Lost University"" (note: you must have a Blu-ray 2.0 player to play this.  So, if your Blu-ray is connected to the Internet, you can view this feature).As for the Blu-ray release of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"", the picture quality is again, amazing.  The detail can be easily seen on Blu-ray and  things that never caught my attention when watching the episodes on television, have now caught my attention this time around. From the skin pores and even the hair on one's arm, to the lush plants and the coarse rocks, the blood, the sweat... the amount of detail that pops is simply amazing.  Audio quality is also used very well through all channels and because we see the smoke monster quite a bit and also quite a bit of explosions and destruction in this final season, lossless audio was well utilized and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray.Overall, this series was a fitting conclusion to this fantastic series.  Many months since the conclusion of the series, people continue to debate the series finale and I'm sure with the epilogue, there are people who will continue to debate the series throughout the rest of the year.But in the end, the series did touch millions of people worldwide.  May they be content or upset of how the series unfolded throughout the six seasons, it's all subjective.  But overall, for me, I was quite content with how the series played out from beginning to end.  Do I still have questions in regards to the series?  I sure do (especially when it comes to the characters of Eloise and Jacob).  But on the grand scale of how the writers resolved many of the important questions of the series, I was content with how the final season played out and I admit to feeling a bit saddened that this series, which had become a favorite of mine for six years, is now over.""Lost"" is definitely the most compelling, entertaining and enthralling drama series to air on television and the cast and crew made sure to end the series on a positive note.  If you have purchased all seasons on Blu-ray, this is a no-brainer and easily a must-buy.  Highly recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: The final season is quite subjective to the viewer but for fans of the series, a solid release on Blu!!!!",1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,13232,"[""'m"", 'not',

Well, obviously things don't go so smoothly, or the series would have ended LAST season.And it serves as the springboard for ""Lost: The Complete Sixth And Final Season,"" which serves as a brilliantly brain-twisting finale for this unspeakably weird series. JJ Abrams doesn't quite manage to wrap up all the countless plot threads he's introduced, but he does manage to provide a semi-satisfying finale for the vast ""Lost"" saga and its many characters.In the aftermath of the nuclear bomb, the survivors find themselves being taken captive by a mysterious man (Hiroyuki Sanada) at an ancient temple. At the same time, the Man in Black begins seducing people over to his side, while Jacob's ghost works to get a replacement for his position on the island. And Charles Widmore has finally arrived on the island for reasons of his own, dragging a reluctant Desmond with him.In another timeline (one where the island is underwater and nobody ever went there), the plane lands safely in L.A. But the fates of the people who were on that flight are still drawn together inexorably -- even though their pasts have been radically different. The history and secrets of the island are revealed, as well as why the people aboard Flight 815 were drawn into the island. And for the evil Man in Black to be stopped, one of the survivors will have to do something unbelievable.""Lost"" has never been like other network TV shows, but the final season goes all out on the strange stuff -- we've got flashbacks to centuries (even millennia!) ago, two separate timelines, a large number of deaths, and the revelation that basically the entire series has been a yin-yang battle between light and darkness. The biggest problem: Not all the plot threads are neatly tied off, and not all questions are answered (why are the numbers BAD?).And the finale is a rather mixed bag -- it's not entirely satisfying, but things end on a haunting, philosophical note. Disappointing as a sci-fi story, but very powerful as a personal story.And the writers spare no emotion, wrenching out some truly powerful moments that mingle tragedy and pure beauty, such as the heartwrenching ""Ab Aeterno"" (in which we find out about Richard's past) or the painfully sad finale of ""The Candidate."" And hanging over every episode is the haunted feeling that something terrible is about to happen (""'Cause if you don't... todos nos vamos al infierno"") and that it will be epic.I still find Matthew Fox's Jack annoying (I laughed out loud when Dogen started pummeling him) but Terry Quinn is brilliant as the ""evil Locke/Man in Black,"" a genial villain with icy eyes; Michael Emerson's creepy Ben is fleshed out to perfection; Josh Holloway's hatred, sorrow and pain are explored; and Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim are ideal when their characters finally reunite. And Jorge Garcia is, as always, the show's heart.There's also some brilliant performances from the supporting cast -- Nestor Carbonell will break your HEART, Hiroyuki Sanada has a brief but excellent role, and Mark Pellegrino is eerie and a little sad.""Lost: The Complete Final Season"" does not answer all the questions raised, and the finale is too oblique, but it does conjure up a brilliantly complex, powerful final arc for this unique TV show.",4,The island's guardian,1274572800,"05 23, 2010",2010,3358,"['When', 'last', 'saw', 'Lost', 'gang', 'had', 'set', 'off', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'timeline', 'would', 'be', 'reset', 'Well', 'obviously', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'smoothly', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'LAST', 'season.And', 'springboard', 'Lost', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Final', 'Season', 'brilliantly', 'brain-twisting', 'finale', 'unspeakably', 'weird', 'series', 'JJ', 'Abrams', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'wrap', 'up', 'countless', 'plot', 'introduced', 'manage', 'provide', 'semi-satisfying', 'finale', 'vast', 'Lost', 'saga', 'many', 'characters.In', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'survivors', 'find', 'being', 'taken', 'captive', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'ancient', 'temple', 'same', 'time', 'Man', 'Black', 'seducing', 'people', 'side', 'Jacob', 'ghost', 'get', 'replacement', 'position', 'island', 'Charles', 'Widmore', 'finally', 'arrived', 'island', 'reasons', 'own', 'dragging', 'reluctant', 'Desmond', 'him.In', 'timeline', 'one', 'where', 'island', 'underwater', 'nobody', 'ever', 'went', 'plane', 'safely', 'L.A', 'fates', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'flight', 'are', 'still', 'drawn', 'together', 'inexorably', 'even', 'pasts', 'have', 'been', 'radically', 'different', 'history', 'secrets', 'island', 'are', 'revealed', 'as', 'well', 'why', 'people', 'Flight', '815', 'were', 'drawn', 'island', 'evil', 'Man', 'Black', 'be', 'stopped', 'one', 'survivors', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'unbelievable', 'Lost', 'never', 'been', 'other', 'network', 'TV', 'shows', 'final', 'season', 'strange', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'got', 'flashbacks', 'centuries', 'even', 'millennia', 'ago', 'two', 'separate', 'timelines', 'large', 'number', 'deaths', 'revelation', 'basically', 'entire', 'series', 'been', 'yin-yang', 'battle', 'light', 'darkness', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Not', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'neatly', 'tied', 'off', 'not', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'why', 'are', 'numbers', 'BAD', '.And', 'finale', 'rather', 'mixed', 'bag', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'things', 'end', 'haunting', 'philosophical', 'note', 'Disappointing', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'very', 'powerful', 'personal', 'story.And', 'writers', 'spare', 'emotion', 'wrenching', 'out', 'truly', 'powerful', 'moments', 'mingle', 'tragedy', 'pure', 'beauty', 'such', 'heartwrenching', 'Ab', 'Aeterno', 'find', 'out', 'Richard', 'past', 'painfully', 'sad', 'finale', 'Candidate', 'hanging', 'over', 'episode', 'haunted', 'feeling', 'something', 'terrible', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'todos', 'nos', 'vamos', 'al', 'infierno', 'will', 'be', 'epic.I', 'still', 'find', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Jack', 'annoying', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'Dogen', 'started', 'pummeling', 'Terry', 'Quinn', 'brilliant', 'evil', 'Locke/Man', 'Black', 'genial', 'villain', 'icy', 'eyes', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'creepy', 'Ben', 'fleshed', 'perfection', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'hatred', 'sorrow', 'pain', 'are', 'explored', 'Yunjin', 'Kim', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'are', 'ideal', 'when', 'characters', 'finally', 'reunite', 'Jorge', 'Garcia', 'always', 'show', 'heart.There', 'also', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'will', 'break', 'HEART', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'brief', 'excellent', 'role', 'Mark', 'Pellegrino', 'eerie', 'little', 'sad', 'Lost', 'Complete', 'Final', 'Season', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'raised', 'finale', 'too', 'oblique', 'conjure', 'up', 'brilliantly', 'complex', 'powerful', 'final', 'arc', 'unique', 'TV', 'show']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

1327877,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0036EH3X4,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","Season 6 was disappointing, but not just because of the final episode. Overall, I felt that the pacing was off. The writers were too concerned with keeping the sense of mystery up to the last minute and not concerned enough with providing a story that makes sense.During the earlier episodes of this season, it seemed that Lost was struggling to maintain suspense. It was clear that the show refused to reveal any answers until the final few episodes. As such, the remaining episodes really don't have a point. The characters just run around on small missions, but viewers don't understand the larger picture. Moreover, the characters seem to change their minds every episode about fundamental decisions, such as whether to trust the Man in Black.The resolution for many of the characters also proved unsatisfactory. Several of the main characters fall by the wayside. Important character moments - such as Jin and Sun reuniting - are fleetingly brief. By contrast, we get entire episodes dedicated to new characters like Richard Alpert and Jacob, characters whom frankly I just didn't care about. The last few episodes of season 6 are just way too late for these types of episodes. It's far more important to give the characters a worthwhile farewell.A major character problem was how the show deals with Locke. Locke's body is now essentially possessed. The character we all knew and loved as Locke is no more. Frankly of all of the characters, Locke was the heart of this show. Making him a cold villain just does him a disservice.That said, I thought the""flashsideways"" sections worked well. The flashsideways sections showed what would have happened to the characters had Oceanic Flight 815 not crashed. It was interesting to see how their fates crossed even so. I applaud the writers for not taking the easy way out and just portraying everybody's lives as worse had they not crashed. The outcomes are varied and escape easy judgment.Now, as for that ending... Well, it certainly doesn't tie up many of the loose ends. A good mystery creates an unsolvable puzzle. A great mystery creates a puzzle that is difficult to solve, but leaves tiny breadcrumbs along the way that the audience can spot the second time around. I just wish the writers had spent more time creating an integrated story rather than focusing on dangling the audience.Overall, Lost is a decent show, at times great, at times burdened by its own ambitions. I'd definitely recommend watching the first two seasons.

1327879,A1XWQ13VJDOQ7C,B0036EH3X4,"eternal now ""roejoerrer""","[22, 34]","Lost has taken me on a fantastic journey like no other piece of entertainment has.I'm no fan of television; I find it boring, trite and highly predictable, with the majority of prime time muck revolving around pathetic attempts at storytelling with no real direction. Heck, you don't even get a sense of mortality for most characters on the majority of television shows because each episode ends with the good guys winning and the bad guys losing. Lost is nothing like that, and that is why I fell in love with it. There really are no 'bad' guys in Lost as each character, even the ones that appear menacing represent just one aspect of humanity that is nevertheless essential to our evolution as a species, and that is the beauty of Lost.Season 6 picks up where Season 5 left off: did the bomb go of? Were the time travelling losties returned to their present time-line? Did the detonation of said bomb (if it actually went off) make it so that flight 815 never crashed on that mysterious island? What follows is an amazing, if convoluted season that, while answering a great many questions brought up throughout its past 5 seasons raises many more (and leaves some questions unanswered). For those of you that were drawn to Lost because of its 'figure it out on your own' mentality, then all is as it should be. Nothing could be closer to the truth than the finale, which turned away more fans than George Lucas ever could. There are still viewers who don't understand the ending, and all I can say is...it is brilliant!From the very first episode it was evident that there would be no spoon feeding to the audience, which of course spawned a massive hurricane of theories and what-ifs. As the answers slowing revealed themselves many ""fans"" found themselves at odds with the writers of the show, as if they (the audience) knew the show better than the writers. Some of the proposed theories turned out to be correct, while others fell flat on their false faces. While I would never make the claim that the writers knew how every episode and every season would pan out from the start (and I would never be so self-important to even assume as such as all great stories are created on a whim from inspiration and such), I do believe that the general outline of the story was known before the pilot episode of Season One aired. I believe they had the beginning plotted out and the very end; everything else in between was either partially planned or envisioned as the show progressed, and what a wonderful progression it has been.Character progression is a very important element to me, and Lost has it in spades. Comparing the mentalities of the characters from Season One to their mentalities in Season Six it is very evident that these characters have evolved. From Jack's logical science mind to the fate imbued Jack of Season Six, each character evolved in a way that no other show has ever presented. Sure, some of the characters in Season Six (namely Claire, Sun, Jin and Sayid) didn't get their due, and felt largely wasted and more or less served as cardboard cutouts, the majority of the main cast had their stories fully explained. From the beginning Lost has always, I repeat, always been about character development. I challenge you to watch every single episode from Season One on and tell me that this isn't so. The mysteries and the mythology have been there as well, but it has always played a backseat to the characters (hence the myriad of flashbacks and love triangles etc). The mythology served more as an impetus to add unconventional aspects to a drama show, elements that would propel the show far beyond the average swill that usually populates your black box. Lost is a confusing, and at times frustrating experience, but one thing is for sure, it is poignant, beautiful and truly epic.While the argument that Season Six feels rushed and more or less a season of the writers spewing forth answer after answer is not entirely incorrect, it loses sight of the purpose and crux of the show. The show has always been about fate vs. free will, science vs. faith, black vs. white, up vs. down; the show has always been about the polarities that unite and divide humanity in its plight and journey in this unknowable and mysterious world. The fact that we (the audience) received so many answers in such a rushed pace during the final season of the show is more owed to paying service to all of the angry and demanding fans that couldn't figure things out for themselves, as well as completing the circle that is Lost. Why did the writers wait until Season Six to reveal some of the nagging questions that had reared their head since Season One? Well, for starters they obviously didn't have all of the answers right away, which should be a given since great stories take time to craft and unfold. Second, even if the writers did know the answers to their questions before hand it would have ruined the show if they revealed all of the answers throughout every season. Part of the allure of Lost were the mind blowing finales that left you scratching your head, pondering what it all meant in swift anticipation for the next season. The fact that I can re-watch every season over and over again is a testament to how amazing the show is. If you are a newcomer to Lost, I highly recommend giving it a chance, as you will surely be introduced to a story that is unlike any other, yet so much like every other that you can easily identify with many of the core themes inherent within its masterful scenes.As for the Blu Ray, the picture quality is unmatched. Detail is abundant and the picture looks very natural. Colors are vibrant and pop off your screen like the best HD has to offer. Audio is excellent as well. As for supplements we get your typical 'making ofs' and such as well as another follow up to the Lost University program, and finally 15 minutes of more Lost, in the form of another episode that answers more questions in a very satirical way.From the sly literature and pop culture references to the deep, underlying philosophical and spiritual overtones, I highly recommend Lost Season Six on Blu Ray. Oh, and the finale will definitely make you feel something.",5,...and the circle is complete,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,6193,"['Lost', 'taken', 'fantastic', 'journey', 'other', 'piece',

1327880,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B0036EH3X4,e. verrillo,"[5, 10]","*Major Spoilers* The only thing worse than ""it was all just a dream"" at the end of an interesting piece of sci-fi/fantasy is ""they were all just dead."" I'm fine with the idea that not everything needs to be explained, but it was clear from the start of this season that the writers were winging it. It's one thing when the audience is kept guessing, but it's another thing entirely when the writers don't have a clue.Problems with the writing began to surface as early as Season 2, when the characters began to do stupid things for the sake of contract violations. Frankly, I don't care if Libby and Ana Lucia got drunk on Oahu and were kicked off the show. That was no reason to destroy Michael's character. Shooting Shannon was another plot contrivance. (OK, so she was annoying.) But, you see, good writers can come up with plots that are consistent with the characters they have developed. Killing them in silly ways (Mr. Eko getting zapped by the smoke monster was just plain dumb), is simple laziness. So is slap-dab casting - the former Press Secretary of the White House playing the ""mother"" of the mythical boy twins? Every time Allison Janney opened her mouth I felt like I was getting a briefing. (In very bad Latin, to boot.) And all those pudgy lackeys with guns looked like they'd just stepped off the set of Buffy (first season - that would be 10th grade). Now that I think of it, what was up with all those guns? A desert island that is chock full of firepower? By the middle of sixth season it was just one endless shoot-em-up, the stock in trade of TV writers who can't think of anything else to do. When in doubt, have a gunfight. Or raise the stakes. It's not just everyone on the island who will die if something (what exactly?) doesn't happen - everyone in the WHOLE WORLD will die! (How exactly? Black smoke? That stuff couldn't even get rid of six marines.)But, in spite of all the lazy writing, I stuck with it, right until the bitter end. Why? Because when Jacob said he would explain everything, I believed him, even though he was, like Hurley said, ""worse than Yoda."" (And I thought nothing worse than Yoda could be.) But there we were, after five years of toughing it out on this island, battling dark inscrutable forces, making fire with sticks, pushing out babies, and all we get is Christian ideology - CHURCH for godssake. (And not even good Christian ideology, because according to the last scene, Kate, Sawyer, Frank, Richard, Claire and Miles flew OFF the island. Which means they weren't even remotely dead. Nor were Rose, Bernard, Hurley, Ben or Desmond.)

It had some inconsistencies and faults throughout its six year run, but it's almost inevitable when you're trying to tell a story this large. Because of the grandiose story that unfolds in this show, I can easily see past the minor mistakes the show made. LOST was so wildly ambitious and unique that it's hard not to love. I know many people would disagree with me, many were disappointed by the lack of answers given to the many mysteries presented throughout the show, but I think most of these people were watching for the wrong reasons. If your only interest in the show is seeing the mysteries cleared up, just stop watching. Yes, the island and its strange happenings played a big part in the show, but just like our survivors, we never are able to find out EVERYTHING. But that's perfectly fine with me because the island possesses magical properties and things happen not always with reason.This season may not have been perfect, it had some issues in the first half of the season. But by the time we reach the halfway mark, particularly an episode called ""Ab Aeterno"", the show picks up and doesn't let us catch our breath until the amazing final moments of the series.Ever since the finale aired on TV, LOST has been glued in the mind and I think back on the whole experience very fondly. This was truly a magical, one-of-a-kind show that will never be reproduced or equaled in terms of scope, originality, and gripping storytelling.

1327894,A1A535W556ROBQ,B0036EH3X4,James Ferguson,"[9, 23]","I think ABC missed a golden opportunity not packaging the Final Season in a white box and a black box, offering the season through the perspectives of Jacob and the Man in Black respectively.  After all, this was the duality set up six years ago when Locke was showing Walt how to play backgammon, giving him a little lesson on Manichaeism by holding up black and white game pieces.  Odd, that throughout this long and troubling final season, Cuselof made no reference back to this memorable scene.The season certainly offered a promising start.  The opening double episode was packed with thrills and intrigues that carried over into two or three more episodes, but as Cuselof tried to give us ""deeper"" insights into the island, the action all but came to a halt and we seemed to digress into a quasi-Biblical view of the island culminating in the Ballad of Jacob and His Brother, which presented us with the origins of the ""game"" they played between them, and the Man in Black's long suppressed desire to get off the island.Cuselof toyed with us a little with another band of castaways led by Dogen, who guarded the Temple from the evil that has come to possess Locke.  We also get treated to an alternative reality set in LA where the Lostaways seemed to be looking for their individual redemption.  No mention of Dharma, and Ben seems reduced to a shadow of his former self.  Despite the new cast members, the return of Widmore, and the interesting ""sideways"" episodes, this show returns to the core members from Season One, with the Jacob/MIB story woven into the early episodes through flashbacks.Unfortunately, it isn't very satisfying, as the writers choose to leave much of the island history they developed over five seasons in the crater left by the explosion at the Swan station at the end of Season Five, and take us on a more spiritual journey that loses most of the tension set up in the initial episodes.

Now that I've seen the last season, and looking back, the whole thing took-too-long.Its disappointing that more wasn't said about The Dharma Project. We do find out what the Black Smoke on the Island is. I'm thinking that probably 2 seasons-worth of the whole series coulda been left out. Maybe its just me, but I wish more shows would have just 3 or 4 really GOOD seasons - and then the writers should create/invent a NEW show. Rather than droning on, meandering, and making a good show become boring by stretching it out for too long. In my opinion, that was what happened with LOST.I have a couple other seasons of LOST, too- but wish even more questions woulda been answered and tied-up at the end.Imagine writers making THREE different TV shows that are 3, maybe 4 seasons long, but that have excellent plots and scenarios and move at a faster, always-something-happening, dont-wanna-miss-it pace...(rather than anything 6 or 7 seasons that just plain takes waaayyy too long to ""get there"").  I'd much rather have that!A classic example to prove my point is: remember ""The X-Files""?? I doubt too many people stuck with it all the way through. And why? Far too much of a carrot-on-a-stick...i.e...the answers you want, next week....only to be suckered yet again. Yeah right.Probably only a few die-hard viewers bothered to watch all of it. It just took to long to go anywhere.  Example 2: the show: FRINGE. Another  good show. John Noble is great in his acting. But at least one season (the one with too many ""Creature"" episodes) coulda been skipped entirely and it'd still be a good series.  Faster pace. Better answers at the end! (see all my reviews).

We'll never know, because the writers never answered any of those questions.  They summed everything up by saying, ""They all lived (in a way) happily ever after.""  I guess they figured viewers would be so happy that people got to be with the ones they loved in the end that we would overlook the fact that none of it made any sense.Throughout the show, the writers inserted interesting books and references to great thinkers to make the viewer think an underlying logic would tie everything together and make sense in the end.  They even made me hope the story would ultimately prove revolutionary or revelatory.  Instead, it turns out they used all those pseudo-literary references to trick the viewer into thinking they were deep and powerful thinkers.  The writers turn out to be juvenile pranksters with nothing more to say than, ""Made you look.""  In the end, they said that reason doesn't matter.

They stringed us along all this time to throw a Jacob's Ladder ending in our faces. By a Jacob's Ladder ending, I DON'T mean to say that the Losties all turned out to be dead; it's obvious that they weren't. They all just met later on in some afterlife (really lame, I know, but that's what happened). By Jacob's Ladder, I mean an ending that's in some ways moot, and doesn't have the kind of significance you were led to believe it would. I don't particularly mind an ending like that in some cases, but it was WRONG for a show like Lost. I would like to be clear about something: I am not complaining about the creators' failure to ""reveal everything."" I wouldn't presume to expect that kind of gratification from any form of art or entertainment. What I am offended by, is the sheer brazen irresponsibleness of the creators, introducing countless mysteries, puzzles, and items of supposed monumental portent which, for the most part, they obviously never intended to solve, explain, or redeem since they clearly had no idea what the answers and meanings were in the first place.  I will concede that some answers were provided, and yes, in a lame way they made sense, but the problem is that they were just THAT: LAME.I had watched Lost with a growing sense of wonder and delight.

""Lost"" isn't a serie where you can buy any season you want or, let's say, buy the first three and then stop. You can maybe read the comments of the first season and then decide if it's worth the buy. At the most, you buy season one, then read the comments for season 2 and decide if it's worth purchasing.

Can i explain to you all what i think happened? Then you can tell me if i'm ""lost""?So... the characters had their lives before. A life filled with despair. Then, as children, they were chosen and touched by Jacob to become candidates to protect an island that is really a cork that keeps Hell from invading Earth (Jacob said so to Richard). Then, as adults, They crashed on that island. They lived through all those surreal events and some of them died on that island. Some others left and died a natural death in their back-to-normal life. And some of them returned to the island, became the new protector and died maybe hundred of years after. The island finally went to the bottom of the sea (as seen in episode one of this last season). Point is, they ALL died at some point. Then, they all went to purgatory and wandered around until they all figured out that they were in fact in purgatory, the character of Desmond being the one to see all that and reunite them all. The lives they lived in that purgatory is the alternate life we see during season 6, right? Then, Jack, the natural leader of the candidates, dies and they can all gather and go to Heaven, except Ben who still needs to make amends (cause that is the role of purgatory).Is that it? Did i get it right?At first, i thought they were all dead from the very beginning. When Jack opened his eyes at the start of season one, he was in purgatory. That explained the magical aspects of the island. And we didn't really need closure on every little detail cause it was purgatory anyway. And at the end, jack realises that he's dead, comes to accept it and goes back to the beginning and closes his eyes. I know now that this is not it. But i do wonder whay he sees the plane flying by.But if my second theory is right, the first one i told you that is, it then means that the magical side of the island is real. Then it is a bit disappointing to not have all the answers. Then maybe yes, the writters did in fact stretched the story a bit too far without being able to come full circle with all their narrative devices.Nevermind that.It's easy to see that they knew all along where they were going. It was the souls of the characters that were ""lost"". The adventures they lived together defined their lives. And Jack was their natural leader. So when they all died, they waited for him in order to go to Heaven. Even if it meant waiting in purgatory for thousand of years.Yeap. This is one heck of a TV series.

I believe that the survivors of Oceanic 815 DO survive the plane crash that occurs in the pilot episode. What the Island does is function as the true Purgatory. The ""real"" Purgatory, the one of Season Six, has no actual restorative or redemptive point, both in contrast (addressed later) and because this Purgatory, unlike The Island, doesn't exist.That unreality is a big problem - because, in the same way that the accomplishments of your dreams feel cheap when you wake, it's hard to believe there's true redemption for a character when their actions occur in a dream world. Especially when that idea is unsupported, which I'll also address shortly.This is why many were concerned that The Island was a mystical limbo and the Survivors didn`t actually survive, because it would invalidate 6 years of watching this fantastic show. It's the dreaded ""it was all a dream"" ending. Instead, only half of Season Six is mystical limbo and is invalidated, because when Jack is a good father to a son that doesn't exist and Sawyer chooses Law and Order as his path to avenge his parents in a dream, that ISN'T redemption. And I think why this is, is because the show itself is not real, but we suspend that disbelief. But to create another layer of unreality, call it a ""dream world"" or ""limbo"" or ""whatever"", this is too much, and they cancel each other out. Especially, again, when this idea is unsupported in the show.EVEN THE BEST IDEAS NEED TO BE LET GO OF IF THEY NO LONGER FITTime travel, though bizarre and often unexplained, doesn't bother me because it had been setup in the show and explored. The Island exists in a different space/time, so maybe the characters can too. Fine. But the idea of the characters creating a world for themselves in the afterlife comes out of no where - like getting a greeting card in the mail for a holiday that doesn't exist. I don't think you can spend 6 years on a TV show and in the last few minutes throw in a totally unsupported idea.The End, in the end, fails in part because unlike ""Pans Labyrinth"" and ""American Beauty,"" the idea of a mystical world created by the love these people had for each other was never supported. It's too big and vague and dreamy to just throw into the air and expect people to accept it without any legs.The other part of it's failure is that it feels tacked on. From what I understand, the ending has been known all along, and maybe as an idea it's clever and beautiful, but I think that the show had out grown and moved on to a different ending. But instead of recognizing this, the writers who agreed with this end forced an old idea into a puzzle it no longer fit in.WATERED DOWN WATERIf the point of the ""sideways world"" was to realize how important everyone was to each other, I would say that's a joke. Jin/Sun, Claire/Charlie, Kate/Jack, they all figured that out in the previous world, The Island. If the point was to let go of your past, again, that was the point of The Island. Where you could be anyone and start over. If the point was to come to be at peace with your own death, Rose invalidates it. Charlies acceptance of his fate invalidates it. They already had that peace. All that happens in the ""sideways world"" was the characters remembered their past time on the island, and for that, they are now ready? There were no great realizations, no new connections made. In short, it had no real function. It was just a collection of ""clip show"" moments, where the characters could come back together and say ""Hey, I know you.""It was on The Island that Jack, Locke, Charlie, Claire, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley and the rest of our beloved Survivors let go of their past. That's where they realized how important they were to each other; where they loved and KNEW they loved each other. Here is where they redeemed themselves from a pointless, empty life.An argument being made is that it functioned as a place where Jack could finally let go. I would counter that he already let go. Jack dies on The Island with a smile, knowing he fulfilled his purpose; that he saved his friends and The Island, if not the world. What did he do in The End? He came to terms with his death when he opened up an empty casket? He already came to terms with his death. Jack knew he was dead when he made the decision to go and replace the cork. Jack already let go; by giving into his fate, to protect The Island, and by giving control of the Island over to Hurley.This is why The End is so unbearable, because we already saw redemption. We already saw the realization of how important they all were to each other, so to see it again and in such a cheap, superficial way is heart breaking.This second Purgatory functions only in the way that the waters in Dante's Purgatory do. The River Eunoe gives back to its imbibers their good memories. And this is the ending to LOST? A cliff notes version of something everyone - the writers, the characters, and the viewers - already knew deep in their soul? That they mattered to each other? This is The End?AND THE WORST PART IS ..This is the first time I've felt hate toward this show and now it's gone. This is Jack and Christian Shepard all over again, ending on a angry note, but here there won't be another episode of LOST to come around to redeem it. I won't touch the casket of Season Six and feel peace.What this ending does is make me feel tricked. That things like the flash on the screen and the corresponding time shift for Jack, Kate, and Sawyer from the Season Five finale (indicting Jughead went off); these were nothing but coins an adult would seemingly pull from my ear when I was a kid. Being cute with editing tricks.MY OWN PRIVATE """"END""How did I want LOST to end?I never cared about being told all of the answers: Where this statue came from? Why Walt was so important? They weren't things I was concerned about. What I cared for was that LOST would end in a way where I was surprised and happy. That's all (though a lot). The way I felt when Charlie died, or when I learned that Jack, when he's waiting at the edge of the airport, that that was the future and he is demanding they go BACK to the Island! Joy! Surprised! These are the feelings I wanted, or even needed, for this shows last minutes but where were they?Instead, here we are 4 days later, and I'm still left with my hands in a confused, swearing pose. The same reaction I have to watching every other stupid TV show, and that's what was so special about LOST. It wasn't every other stupid show.I was going to write out how I would have ended the show, but it doesn't matter. This is how it ended. This is how it always will end: ""What's done is done"".But I will ask why the meeting place was a church and not an airport?An airport is a better symbol of the faith they had in each other, because THAT is relevant to this show. A church is just a building in the world of LOST, and that's all it is here. A superficial symbol of the faith and the after life.  Much like Season Six was, just a superficial version of the previous years.",2,Dr. HansoLove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate This Bomb,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,7586,"['Jacob', 'fake',

The problem is not just the lack of answers to the Island's mysteries -- although that lack of answers rankled -- but the fact that almost none of the events of the show prior to the last four episodes had any meaning or impact. For instance, the destruction of the hatch in the Season 2 finale never had any ramifications or explanations or consequences. Similarly, the explosion of the nuke in Season 5 ultimately proved to have no impact on the conclusion (despite an overlong and narratively unfair tease). Desmond's flashes -- built up throughout and made to look significant toward the end -- also completely failed to impact the actual conclusion of the show.

DON'T EVEN MAKE ME REGRET STAYING WITH YOU ALL THESE YEARS!""But the answers never really came and yet in a soft and subtle way, they did...they were always there just under our noses. Of course, most of us bypass the obvious. The obvious is...well, too obvious. We like drama, flair, fireworks. Most of us only get things when they are shoved in our faces and even then we want more because we are greedy, greedy children and just like the Losties, we can really be in paradise and not even know it.Paradise is not where everyone and everything is going along smoothly. Paradise is when we learn to put aside our differences and learn to work with each other and with what we are given. Like the oft repeated line, ""We need to live together or we're going to die alone...""And these characters rubbed up each other and it was that constant friction and agitation that revealed who they really were. Yes, they were ""flawed"" people...just like all of us...but underneath the flaws, there was the True Light and the True Love that was always shining. No matter what these characters may have said, or thought, or felt, or done; the Light within them was more than any of it.Just like with all of us.And then the end came but they weren't dead - they were alive. No, these people were dead before the plane crash. This ""island"" redeemed them, resurrected them, showed them their wholeness/their holiness, showed them that with just a touch of love, all things are made new. I have watched those last fifteen minutes of the finale time after time after time and I always get choked up. This is what life is about; it's about constantly adjusting and readjusting, giving as well as taking, doing things you are called upon to do and knowing that you are not doing it just for yourself, you are doing it for all.Truly, ""no man is an island unto themselves"".I have heard people complain that the show was too spiritual. Spirit is in everything. It's just not always obvious. But this show...this irritating, maddening, crazy making show revealed to me my own heart and showed me that I am really never living my life when I just focus only on ""self"" but when I dwell on SELF.Congratulations for everyone who worked on bringing this masterpiece to television. Your timing was perfect. Truly, to everything there is a season; a time to every purpose under heaven...Peace and Blessings,john, ""the Light Coach""",5,I was Lost but Now I am Found,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,3697,"['Lost', 'captivated', 'get', 'go', 'seemed', 'have', 'everything', 'including', 'air', 'Self-importance', ""'m"", 'not', 'using', 'term', 'standard', 'way', 'am', 'using', 'term', 'much', 'larger', 'much', 'grander', 'way', 'Here', 'were', 'people', 'beaten', 'down', 'life', 'were', 'outcasts', 'worlds', 'ever', 'became', 'castaways', 'island.But', 'know', 'still', 'asleep', 'was', 'ordinary', 'island', 'week', 'were', 'more', 'more', 'things', 'being', 'revealed', 'island', 'Smoke', 'Monster', 'Dharma', 'Initiative', ""'others"", 'Richard', 'Alpert', 'Black', 'Rock', 'Jacob', '.etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'was', 'actually', 'becoming', 'maddening', 'season', 'ended', 'would', 'think', 'Oh', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'cancelled', 'please', 'let', 'go', 'then', 'next', 'season', 'would', 'take', 'off', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'questions', 'more', 'more', 'then', 'finally', 'was', 'announced', 'would', 'be', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'always', 'thought', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'seven', 'more', 'keeping', 'mystical', 'scriptural', 'themes', 'had', 'going', 'thought', 'Well', 'here', 'go', 'bring', 'answers', 'First', 'episode', 'uh', 'answers', 'more', 'questions.Second', 'episode', 'same', 'thing', 'Third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'DAMNIT', 'ANSWER', 'ONE', 'STINKIN', 'QUESTION', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'EVEN', 'MAKE', 'ME', 'REGRET', 'STAYING', 'WITH', 'YOU', 'ALL', 'THESE', 'YEARS', 'answers', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'yet', 'soft', 'subtle', 'way', 'did', 'were', 'always', 'there', 'just', 'noses', 'course', 'most', 'bypass', 'obvious', 'obvious', 'well', 'too', 'obvious', 'drama', 'flair', 'fireworks', 'Most', 'only', 'get', 'things', 'when', 'are', 'shoved', 'even', 'then', 'want', 'more', 'are', 'greedy', 'greedy', 'children', 'just', 'Losties', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'paradise', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'it.Paradise', 'not', 'where', 'everyone', 'everything', 'going', 'along', 'smoothly', 'Paradise', 'when', 'learn', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'learn', 'work', 'other', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'oft', 'repeated', 'line', 'need', 'live', 'together', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', 'alone', 'characters', 'rubbed', 'up', 'other', 'was', 'constant', 'friction', 'agitation', 'revealed', 'who', 'really', 'were', 'Yes', 'were', 'flawed', 'people', 'just', 'flaws', 'was', 'True', 'Light', 'True', 'Love', 'was', 'always', 'shining', 'matter', 'what', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'said', 'thought', 'felt', 'done', 'Light', 'was', 'more', 'it.Just', 'us.And', 'then', 'end', 'came', 'were', ""n't"", 'dead', 'were', 'alive', 'No', 'people', 'were', 'dead', 'plane', 'crash', 'island', 'redeemed', 'resurrected', 'showed', 'wholeness/their', 'holiness', 'showed', 'just', 'touch', 'love', 'things', 'are', 'made', 'new', 'have', 'watched', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'finale', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'always', 'get', 'choked', 'up', 'what', 'life', 'about', 'constantly', 'adjusting', 'readjusting', 'giving', 'as', 'well', 'taking', 'doing', 'things', 'are', 'called', 'do', 'knowing', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'just', 'are', 'doing', 'all.Truly', 'man', 'island', 'unto', '.I', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'spiritual', 'Spirit', 'everything', 'just', 'not', 'always', 'obvious', 'show', 'irritating', 'maddening', 'crazy', 'making', 'show', 'revealed', 'own', 'heart', 'showed', 'am', 'really', 'never', 'living', 'life', 'when', 'just', 'focus', 'only', 'self', 'when', 'dwell', 'SELF.Congratulations', 'everyone', 'who', 'worked', 'bringing', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'timing', 'was', 'perfect', 'Truly', 'everything', 'season', 'time', 'purpose', 'heaven', 'Peace', 'Blessings', 'john', 'Light', 'Coach']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

I know a lot of people had mixed feeling about this amazing show's ending. About how little answers they gave but I think this was a very fitting ending to the show.  With exception of couple of episodes this was an amazing season.  Lost has always been character driven show.  There has never been a show that has been talked about so much.  So many genres united so many people otherwise would not be in the same room.  The Philosophy,the Mythology, Science Fiction, Drama...this show offered everything. This was by far the best show in last 20-30 yrs.  If Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox and the show doesn't get Emmy awards I would be very surprised.  The show has always been very well acted.  That is one of the reasons that makes this show very compelling.  Even though the show didn't answered all the questions (which they didn't need to anyway) it makes people keep talking about it.  Overall it was a very well written, well acted and executed show.  I will definitely miss LOST.  And continue to watch it on dvds.

I watched seasons 1-5 with the expectation that the inumerable abandoned concepts and plot threads and mysteries would be given context and at least rudimentary explanation in season 6. Instead I was treated to a bizarre and utterly irrelevant ""flash sideways"", a magical glowing cave, and an ultra syrupy pseudo ecumenical religious ending that leaves the vast majority of aformentioned plot threads, etc, unresolved and thus pointless. Others have pointed out some of the specifics so I won't go into them here, suffice to say that there are literally dozens of unanswered questions/abandoned story concepts that come to my mind. From now on I will be waiting for a series to be over to start watching it if it is a serial like Lost was. I am sooo disappointed it's not even funny.One final thing.

1327918,AGRP8AW530HAQ,B0036EH3X4,"Julio Lopez ""soundtrack fan""","[6, 9]","This is a comment on the whole show.As I dislike following T.V. series chapter afer chapter, week after week or - as in this case - year after year, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the sixth seasons so as to watch them from certain distance, far from all the hubbub, the fame and the worship in order to get a more objective standpoint and, eventually, a more accurate and emotionally detached judgement.The first two seasons seemed to me to be the finest. Round characters, interesting story and thematic concern (how to survive in extreme situations), a brilliant score, good acting from the main interpreters (Michael Emerson as Ben, the best) good directions, impressive locations and great entertainment all the way through. The love stories of Jin/Lun, Claire/Charlie, Hurley/Libby, Jack/Kate/Sawyer and Sayid/Shannon are well developed, touching and true to life; at least, you believe in them.However, things start going wrong by the middle of Season 3: long incidents over the weighter, some unnecesary flashbacks going nowhere, additional adventures cut off from the main plot. This goes on and on up to the point when the story becomes uninteresting and confusing, a hotch potch that becomes a total boring mess. Once the ""time traveling"" and the island transportation start, you are the one who becomes ""lost"".No doubt: Hollywood has given us some good series in the History of T.V. Centennial, Roots, Carnivale, Holocaust, Rome, just to name some of the ones I've seen.  And other european masterpieces such as I Claudius, Upstairs - Downstairs, The Earth or Berlin Alexanderplatz, works of art that have never been surpassed in artistic achievement. Although LOST was never conceived to become an artistic masterpiece as the ones just mentioned, it might have reached a high level of pre-eminence if shorter, less pretentious, less ambitious and more common-sensical and coherent. The truth is that, after Season 3, the series becomes weaker and goofier, reaching a ""grand finale"" in a chapel (actually it looks like an all-cast cocktail-to-be celebrating the end of the shooting) wich is a tribute to Utter Nonsense.If scores allowed, let me rank the series by season, on a scale from 1 to 5:Season 1: 4Season 2: 3.5Season 3: 3Season 4: 1Season 5: 1Season 5: 1The best: Michael Giacchino's scoreThe worst: the length and the folly of the last three seasons.In a nutshell: A hyped Hollywood extravaganza that it might have been much better if less contrived and pretentious but simpler and more coherent.",2,A comment on the whole series,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,2527,"['comment', 'whole', 'show.As', 'dislike', 'following', 'T.V', 'series', 'chapter', 'afer', 'chapter', 'week', 'week', 'case', 'year', 'year', 'decided', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'sixth', 'seasons', 'so', 'watch', 'certain', 'distance', 'far', 'hubbub', 'fame', 'worship', 'order', 'get', 'more', 'objective', 'standpoint', 'eventually', 'more', 'accurate', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'judgement.The', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'be', 'finest', 'Round', 'characters', 'interesting', 'story', 'thematic', 'concern', 'how', 'survive', 'extreme', 'situations', 'brilliant', 'score', 'good', 'acting', 'main', 'interpreters', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'Ben', 'best', 'good', 'directions', 'impressive', 'locations', 'great', 'entertainment', 'way', 'love', 'stories', 'Jin/Lun', 'Claire/Charlie', 'Hurley/Libby', 'Jack/Kate/Sawyer', 'Sayid/Shannon', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'touching', 'true', 'life', 'least', 'believe', 'them.However', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'middle', 'Season', '3', 'long', 'incidents', 'weighter', 'unnecesary', 'flashbacks', 'going', 'nowhere', 'additional', 'adventures', 'cut', 'off', 'main', 'plot', 'point', 'when', 'story', 'uninteresting', 'confusing', 'hotch', 'potch', 'total', 'boring', 'mess', 'time', 'traveling', 'island', 'transportation', 'start', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'lost', '.No', 'doubt', 'Hollywood', 'given', 'good', 'series', 'History', 'T.V', 'Centennial', 'Roots', 'Carnivale', 'Holocaust', 'Rome', 'just', 'name', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'european', 'masterpieces', 'such', 'Claudius', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'Earth', 'Berlin', 'Alexanderplatz', 'art', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'surpassed', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'LOST', 'was', 'never', 'conceived', 'become', 'artistic', 'masterpiece', 'ones', 'just', 'mentioned', 'might', 'have', 'reached', 'high', 'level', 'pre-eminence', 'shorter', 'less', 'pretentious', 'less', 'ambitious', 'more', 'common-sensical', 'coherent', 'truth', 'Season', '3', 'series', 'weaker', 'goofier', 'reaching', 'grand', 'finale', 'chapel', 'actually', 'all-cast', 'cocktail-to-be', 'celebrating', 'end', 'shooting', 'wich', 'tribute', 'Utter', 'Nonsense.If', 'allowed', 'let', 'rank', 'series', 'season', 'scale', '1', '5', 'Season', '1', '4Season', '2', '3.5Season', '3', '3Season', '4', '1Season', '5', '1Season', '5', '1The', 'best', 'Michael', 'Giacchino', 'scoreThe', 'worst', 'length', 'folly', 'last', 'three', 'seasons.In', 'nutshell', 'hyped', 'Hollywood', 'extravaganza', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'less', 'contrived', 'pretentious', 'simpler', 'more', 'coherent']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

This was a golden opportunity to wrap the story up, answer dozens of questions, etc., and there was plenty of time to do it.Season Six started off with a bang for me with LAX. I loved it and it felt like things were indeed going to come full circle with the characters. There were lots of episodes to come. And then of course, came 'What Kate Does' and even though I really disliked it, I'm the forgiving sort and I figured things would get better. I did find myself disturbed by the introduction of yet even more new characters (Dogen and Lennon) when we still lacked resolution for most of the familiar ones. C'mon, guys, there isn't THAT much time to get to all the Island Mysteries!And I couldn't help some misgivings over what seemed the needless, rather baffling torture of Sayid. But I'm easy to please and I forgot about all that for the next several episodes. Dr. Linus featured some brilliant acting by Michael Emerson. Of course, eventually we got to 'Recon' and as much as I adore Josh Holloway it was a pretty sub-par episode that really added *nothing* to the plot. Nothing. Besides, I never liked Charlotte anyway.But things picked up again with the next episode (and the *true* highlight of the season) with Nestor Carbonell's incredible, career-defining episode, 'Ab Aeterno'. Holy cow, what a performance! It was like a big screen moment on the small screen and one I enjoy watching each time. That brilliance was followed by several more good to very good episodes.Then, of course, as all true Lost fans know, came 'Across the Sea' which quickly demonstrated that turkeys aren't just confined to Thanksgiving. I actually felt embarrassed for Titus  Welliver and Mark Pellegrino. The woman who played the mother was dreadful as was the whole episode. Thankfully, that was followed by 'What They Died For' which (hopeful Lost fan that I was) had me convinced that 'The End' would really provide some soul-satisfying answers.Now, you have to understand that I actually liked almost all of Season 6. There were some great performances - Nestor Carbonell in Ab Aeterno, Matthew Fox delivering some of his best acting of the whole series (""want to try another stick?"" was great), the always brilliant Michael Emerson, Josh Holloway in the dock scene when he was talking with Kate (they didn't give Josh enough to do Season 6 [very disappointing], Terry O'Quinn for his dual role as Locke/MIB.That being said, I can't overlook all the flaws. It doesn't mean I don't appreciate the show or that I won't ever re-watch my DVDs (I'm buying Season Six if that tells you anything) BUT for me, The End (of Lost) was horribly unsatisfying.Some people say to those of us who didn't like it: you just didn't get it. The fact is, I did. I still found it disappointing and frustrating. There weren't just a few unanswered questions. There were dozens. Some of the answers were rushed (the Whispers for instance), some didn't make any sense, and some just weren't answered satisfactorily (if Walt was so ""special"" why did he become so ""dispensable"", why was Widmore so determined to get back to the Island? why, instead of exploring Claire's three years on the island were we introduced to characters like Zoe, Lennon, Dogen, whom we didn't care about?, how did Sayid end up with Shannon instead of Nadia? what was the origin of the statue? how did Jacob make all that money to finance his off-island travels/ventures? why did ""mother"" kill ""real mother""? what was so special about Aaron? one that I forgot the other day -- what on earth was the point of Ilana, the backstory of her being in the hospital at the beginning of Ab Aeterno? etc., etc., etc.)? And most pressing of all -- why do Lost admirer's hate having these questions asked? It's not disloyal. It's just realistic.I did like the Sawyer/Juliet reunion scene at the end. I think it was the only one that really hit home for me. As for the rest, the scene with Vincent was great...Overall - great series with a disappointing ending. I'll watch it again, but the thrill is gone.",3,Loved It Til 'The End',1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,4576,"['Lost', 'show', 'had', 'everything', 'abundance', 'drama', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'love',

Extremely addictive, proceed with caution!I just finished watching the series' FINALE and am still crying. I've been streaming it from Season 1 to now, for most of this past week, even waking up at 3 AM to catch yet another episode. I stopped watching the news or anything else on 'normal' TV, neither did I have the mind to read a newspaper or magazine. Currently I have a pile of dishes in the sink, and I am successfully ignoring them :-).LOST is a tour de force, a hefty mixture of sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, romance, suspense, and some (though not cloying) spirituality. While  not at all alike, its scope as well as the characters' interaction, reminded me of FRINGE. Yeah, I believe that both shows draw their strength from the way the protagonists react, interact, and eventually form loyalty to each other.Do not expect the finale to wrap things up neatly. The main plot, over the course of six years, grew too many tentacles, off-shoots, nuances, and I suppose the finale was influenced by production limits. I feel I need another hour of storyline for many of the loopholes to close ...In the final moments of the ending, I cried for Doc Jack, even though I never quite took a liking to him; to me, he is the spoiled golden boy who wasted too much of his life nurturing the chip on his shoulder. Yet he matured throughout the episodes and redeemed himself. On the other hand, John Locke is a character who distinguishes himself with faith and strength from the get-go, and I am left wondering why, in the FINALE, while liberated from his wheelchair, he was alone ... his lady love (Peggy! from Married with Children), who loved him no less than the other female heroines loved their beaus, was not by his side. Why? Could it be that John did not love her with the same intensity our dear dentist loved his wife Rose, or Jin loved his 'dream lady'?One of the many loose ends at the finale, was Michael. True, he had done horrific acts to save his son, but then, later on, gallantly atoned for his sins. He deserved to be part of that last meeting.Lastly ... I feel bad for the Black Smoke Monster. He had wanted to leave the island from the very beginning but was prevented by his step mom. Poor thing, he was born in captivity and after what must have felt like eons to him, perished in captivity. Despite the power he wielded, he was a victim, he sure had a right to the proverbial chip on the shoulder!Oh, well. Off I go in search of tissues to wipe my tears and then tackle the dishes ...LOST is a solid show. It's greatest flaw, is its capacity to get you addicted to watching it.",5,Warning!

A couple of points revealed: The island is an anomaly in the fabric of space-time. It has an energy pool at it's core strong enough to create a severe dimensional distortion, not strong enough to be a black hole however, but powerful enough to alter space-time linearity and/or perception of it and make it invisible to the more stable linear energy field of our world. Regarding the origin of the island I can only say that it could be Atlantian in nature or that the energy core of it was created at the time of the universe's Big-Bang and it crystalized into an island on our planet over cosmic eons purely out of quantum probability (in other words: it has existed since to beginning of known time). The energy core allows access to space-time dimensions of higher simmetry, therefore reversing dimensional entropy and approaching the infinity factor which in religion is also called God. The higher simmetry is also a unifying constant that makes all experienced separation become one again and cancelling out all fluctuations. Perhaps civilization came from it and the island allowed intelligent life on this planet (2001 space odissey anyone?).

That's the simple explanation for the huge quantity of characters, even new ones appearing in Season Six! (you can almost visualize the scene: an agent asking the producers: ""How much do I pay to get my client in the show?"")The producers sensed they got a steady following (rightly so, judging the so many great reviews) and thought they could get away with murder.

The acting is first rate.  The sets are atmospheric.  The photography is beautiful.  The music underscores and highlights the emotions portrayed.John Locke is fearsome as the personification of evil.  Ben is his usual self-serving, amoral, and hateful self.

For five-plus incredible seasons LOST was plot driven, not character driven (that is not to say there wasn't any character development; LOST had probably the best character development of any television show I have ever seen). The story arc was a fantastic blend of adventure, mystery, science fiction, and the supernatural. All of the key plot points and devices drove the ultimate resolution of the story the writers had devised for our entertainment. Then along came the final episodes of Season 6...It beggars belief that Amazon and the web are awash with supercilious reviews scoffing at the notion that the writers had a duty to provide their audience with ""answers"" and intellectualizing about how poignant and fitting and beautiful the ending was and how those who disagree ""don't get it."" Such sentiments could only come from those who didn't watch every episode from the pilot onward and simply don't understand the concept of the story arc in episodic storytelling. Those of us who did, and do, could never accept the axiom that it is the audience's responsibility to ""interpret"" the outcome.I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of LOST, but ultimately, the destination had to make sense within the story arc developed over the preceeding five seasons.

1327943,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0036EH3X4,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Fair warning up front there will be spoilers in the review so if you have not seen it, proceed at your own risk.Lost started out as a series about a group of castaways stuck on a mysterious island.  Throughout the 6 seasons it veered off in a lot of different directions.  The final season was really about telling the backstory of the island, and revealing the fates of the characters.  I think your level of enjoyment of the last season will really depend on what you think of the story of the island and the big reveal at the end.In this season we finally get to see Jacob and we learn who and what the smoke monster is.  The monster takes Locke's form and Terry O'Quinn plays a great bad guy for really most of the 16 episodes.  We are also shown flash sideways which shows an alternate timeline for the characters.  It is based on the premise that the plane does not crash (that detonating the bomb at the end of season 5 worked), but we find that the characters do not exactly go back to their old lives.  That things have changed significantly.  It also provides the opportunity for bringing back some of the characters that had been previously killed off.  That story is shown concurrently with the bomb not working and everyone still being stuck on the island.The ending is really open to interpretation.  We find out that the sideways world was not real but a kind of limbo, hence Desmond waking everyone up.  In the end we learn that everyone has died and is meeting again in the sideways world.  We do not know however if they died in the initial crash, if all the events on the island really played out as we saw, or if the plane really makes it off the island in the final shot of the show.  That they did is hinted at when Jack's father says that everyone died at different times, but we do not really know how the survivors went on to live out the rest of their lives.  I think those are all interesting questions that they leave up to the viewers.The hallmark of the series was really the wonderful acting and the character development.  If you look back from season 1 to the end at the ""main"" characters, those who were around until the end really did change and evolve.  Given that it was such an ensemble cast that was almost necessary for the series to do well.As far as the actual discs go for those who buy them as opposed to steaming, there is quite a bit of bonus material (although not as much as prior seasons).  You still have the season play option so you can stop and pick up where you left off.  And of course the A/V quality is great.Overall I think the series was excellent.  Although it did take some weird turns here and there, I think the fact that it was so well acted and did try to give the viewers some kind of payoff on all the stories they had going some of that could be overlooked.  You do have to accept that the show does not wrap everything up in a tidy little bow however.  I never watched the show when it was on the air, but I know a lot of people who did got really frustrated with it for going off on all the tangents.  I think those are easier to take when you can watch it on dvd and see it progress watching the episodes back to back without the long breaks.

So, when the scenarists and the fans sell me ""this is about the characters"" stuff, I am completely disoriented, even LOST.The series features a level of violence that surpasses ""Mighty Mouse"" or ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, the killings of people for no reason occur every few minutes, the treacherous heroes swap their allegiances and loyalties more frequently than they change their underwear, the people are caught in a sort of stubborn irrationality, and for no apparent reason they fell in love and then abandon their affections. Upon all this the authors pile tons of mind-boggling puzzles, mysteries, riddles, enigmas - all this only to resolve it by a sort of ""A riddle for you: do you know what's shiny, buzzes and you cannot catch it? - No, I do not! - Ah, that's pity, 'cause I don't know either!"" - and after all these you say me: ""It's all about the characters""?These ""characters"", even the major ones, were killed and forgotten without trace in each of the episodes. Who does remember Mr. Eco the Nigerian (2nd season). Looked like a great ""It's about the character"" until he was killed for nothing and erased from the plot? Just an example. The ""characters"" were more expendable than the privates in a WWI movie. ""LOST"" lured the audience into watching (and high rating) by mysteries and ""more answers"" - and defaulted on the promise.It seems the script-writers climbed on a very high tree of their imagination only to find that they are unable to descend safely, so they took to the ""Dorothy is back to Kansas"" vaguely happy ending parachute.And who is the majestic figure that reveals to Jack the final truth? Of all people, his father, a drunkard, completely lacking any moral integrity, without whom no Inferno can be happy! He is the Divine Messenger that ascends into the Heavenly Shining Light!

Why is Ben so important? Do the dead resurrect on the Island like Jack's father or dead means dead, like Ben's daughter? Why can it there be no children getting born on the Island? What do the Numbers mean? How was Lock able to walk again and why did he have to die at the end? Why did the statue have four fingers? And what about the polar bears, the one on the island and the other fossilized with a Dharma collar in ancient Egyptian ruins.As it turns out, the creators of the series had no clue whatsoever. They kept throwing PostIts with ancient, urban and and religious mythology on the board and THEN they tried to mold the resulting pulp of ideas into a narrative. This way, something was bound to catch your interest every week. Yet, they had no idea where the story was going. Not even at the end. Well, especially at the end.The problem with Season 6 of LOST was that, during the previous seasons, it had hooked us with so many lines that we expected either a fish or at least some uneaten bait at the end of them. Most of these lines simply ended, never to be picked up ever again.No deeper meaning. No logical explanation that can tie around everything.

And the flash sideways is not a waste of time.So there.Edit:  This is the kind of show you have to watch all the way through from the beginning, without missing a single episode (well, except maybe 'Expose'.)

Naturally, I had to complete my collection and purchase season 6. I am glad that I did. I am drawn to shows that have characters I actually care about---good or bad, it doesn't matter.

I won't allow the ending to take away from that.  Lost was that unique show that one would wait for each week with baited breath.  With that in mind, I just can't find reason to excuse the finale.  The show was about characters, yes, but it also was about the mysteries of the island.  One cannot ignore that.  To simply end the series with an ""Oh the island is magic"" just does not suffice.  All of the mysteries amounted to nothing more than Jacob's rules for said island.  There might as well have been unicorns and elves living on the island as nothing that occurred was ever going to be explained by the writers anyway.

1327966,A1WY1U223QB0IB,B0036EH3X4,"R. Hawk ""Jubal_Early""","[2, 5]","I did not watch this series when it was on the air, so just recently became interested in it and slowly went through all six seasons borrowed from my local library...I found the ending to be of mixed quality. After reading many of the reviews by other fans here and at other websites I agree with most of what you've all said both positive and negative.The thing that struck me most about the series about half way through, say in the third season, was that it really had no clear direction. In the opening seasons it was the survivors of Oceanic 815 against Ben and the ""others"" but then sides changed, loyalties changed, crash survivors went from one group to another constantly, and everything became very blurred in terms of direction and ""good"" vs. ""evil"". Then they threw in time travel, god-like beings interacting with the islanders on a personal level, nuclear bombs going off, multiple time lines etc. and it became even muddier.So about half way through watching this series I realized that the writers were really doing what we used to refer to in grade school as a ""round robin"" story. Basically, they created this opening plot with a lot of potential, and then did not think about where it was going. They wrote it episode to episode. And as with a round robin story, you start it, tell it to someone, they pass it on etc. etc and add a chapter, and once you get to like the 30th telling, the story is complete and utter nonsense with no satisfying way to end it.That in my opinion is what happened with Lost. The writers just did not think it through. They counted their royalty checks, lapped up the fan support at the time, and went home thinking that they had created something profound. Instead we got this mishmash of crazy events that ultimately ended by being more frustrating than satisfying.In the midst of this we had six years of wonderful character development as each of these unique actors played off against each other. But I think most people will agree with me that the plot of the series was so convoluted that if you actually found yourself on the island in the midst of all this, it would be a living hell. How would you tell reality from insanity? Take Ben for instance. He started out as this totally manevolent character in the beginning, and at the end they've all pretty much forgiven him for the mass murders he caused (some he carried out personally like killing the entire Dharma Initiative staff), and become his friend... How's that happen?Another defining element of this series that is unique, aside from the round robin issue, is that I would estimate a good majority of die hard fans of the show will never buy it on DVD. What's the point? It has very little re-watch value. How can you watch season 1, knowing who's going to die when, who's going to kill who, and that all those events are pointless anyway? Charlie dies, sacrifices himself for nothing, and so does Jack, Juliet etc. etc. And think back. How many of the main characters didn't end up being murderers? Even Hurley ended up killing ""Others"" (he ran that guy down remember)...So how did the island redeem any of these people? How did it redeem Sayid? He probably killed more people on the island, and off of it for Ben, than he ever did in the Republican Guard.So I enjoyed the ride, but about half way through I realized that a madman was at the wheel and that the show was really going nowhere.One of the disappointing things for me in the end actually was in the lack of adequate extras on the DVD. They never seemed to interview any of the minor characters to see what they thought of their roles and of the series such as Christian Shepard, Mr. Eko, Shannon and Boone, Ana Lucia... All these excellent supporting characters were not only summarily dumped in the series itself, but dumped by the producers of the DVDs where they could have contributed commentaries of their own.And it seemed to me also by leaving several characters out of the church at the end, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte and Richard Alpert for instance, they were telling us these people weren't good enough to be included with the rest of the cast.In terms of the interactions of the characters in the show, the character development, this series deserved four stars. In terms of the opening anticipation created by the plot and setting, also four, maybe five stars. But in terms of what the writers did to us by weaving this mess that inevitably went nowhere, one star if that. Are we allowed to give negative stars?This series is essentially a poster child for the confusion of our modern world, how everyone's religious, moral and scientific beliefs conflict. In the end, we hoped that the creators of the show would give us a meaningful answer to the mythology they themselves thought up. Instead, they just used us as a way to make a nice fat paycheck for a while, before we ""Lost"" interest in their bull.I think the conclusion to draw here is that the creators of this show were themselves ""lost"" from the beginning and probably still are.

1327967,AOL37HRJV9I09,B0036EH3X4,"Ricardo ""rapt3""","[7, 26]","In this review, I wanna share with you some thoughts about ""The End"" and why Lost will always have a place in my heart for the rest of my life.But for that matter, I will let a friend of mine talk about it, because, I can't express with the same clever way than him. Credits to [...]. This for me is the perfect interpretation of what the show was about, so read carefully. Oh, by the way, it contains spoilers:So here it goes:There's a plane. Oceanic 815. This plane represents us, men. Us, always sky high, us, involved in a metal shield hard to be broken. We are always here and there, here and there, flying in high speed, here and there, without thinking, always carrying fragile things inside ourselves, always in the hights, always, going higher and higher, and higher each second, like this, in a flash.Only sometimes, we fall. Sometimes, we break in little pieces.So let's take a look in one of these men: Jack Sheppard. He represents us, this plane. And this plane falls on an island, this man, falls into his own conscience: the island.By the way, who is the first character appearing in the show? That's right, JACK! Jack opens his eyes.And what happens next? Jack is walking by the forest and then finally arrives in front of his broken person: the plane. And all those people that were there, they were Jack's little fragments. All the characters on the show, all those characters we came to know and love are fragments of Jack's persona. That's right, Lost is all about Jack. Lost is all about men.So if we stop and start to think hard, all the characters represents a little fragment of Jack that was spread into Jack's conscience (the island) and Jack represents men, and men are represented by the plane of flight 815.And now Jack will have to recover because he fell, he broke, and now Jack will have to put all his fragments together again. And this happens only now in Season 6, when all of these fragments starts to find one another in the once called parallel reality, which we learn in the final seconds, it's the afterlife.And the afterlife has begun after Juliet detonates the hydrogen bomb. And who is Juliet in the afterlife? Well, Juliet is the mother of Jack's son. If all the characters are fragments of Jack, Juliet can be seen as the mother, in other words, the mother fragment inside men. It's the mother of men who promotes the miracle of closing the circle with all these fragments meeting each other, connecting each other and being like one again in Jack.And so finally Jack have his peace, which is the most beautiful example.And in the final scene, when Jack returns to the place where he first woke up on the island, who is the one that is in the very side of Jack once again? That's right, VINCENT, the dog. And what is the dog? Well the dog is men's best friend. So it's men's best friend together with men, we can remember the very first sequence in the beginning of the series when Vincent just passes by, he's not in the side of Jack; Vincent is also... LOST. But now, in the end, the circle is closed and Jack is his own best friend. Jack found himself. Now, Jack is fixed, he's one again, he's complete.Once the fragments of Jack was Lost, was all spread. But now, they found one another, they are connected, and they are ready to leave.It makes perfect sense. Once again:The plane is a symbol: the man. The island is man's conscience, the man was cast away into his own conscience. When the episode finishes, we can remember Jack leaving the place he fell in the first episode, walking to the beach, looking all around, and then he starts to understand: that's me, I'm like this, I'm broken, look at all my spread fragments all over my conscience... it will be a long journey to put it all back together again.And to sum it all: we are left with two words: broke and leave. In the beginning we are all broken. In the end, all we want is leave. In the end, Jack is ready to die. Ready to leave.And to conclude: what was that plane that passes in the end? Well, we can think of: Ajira, Oceanic 815, or even another plane. But for me, it's just another man who flies. And this man will find himself... and leave.What a beautiful way of thinking. What a wonderful ending... what a fantastic show!",5,"Magnificently brilliant, brilliantly crafted and full of poetry and philosophy",1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,4241,"['review', 'wan', 'na', 'share', 'thoughts', 'End', 'why', 'Lost', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'place', 'heart', 'rest', 'life.But', 'matter', 'will', 'let', 'friend', 'mine', 'talk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'express', 'same', 'clever', 'way', 'Credits', '[', ']', 'perfect', 'interpretation', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'about', 'so', 'read', 'carefully', 'Oh', 'way', 'spoilers', 'So', 'here', 'plane', 'Oceanic', '815', 'plane', 'men', 'Us', 'always', 'sky', 'high', 'involved', 'metal', 'shield', 'hard', 'be', 'broken', 'are', 'always', 'here', 'there', 'here', 'there', 'flying', 'high', 'speed', 'here', 'there', 'thinking', 'always', 'carrying', 'fragile', 'things', 'always', 'hights', 'always', 'going', 'higher', 'higher', 'higher', 'second', 'flash.Only', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'Sometimes', 'break', 'little', 'pieces.So', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'one', 'men', 'Jack', 'Sheppard', 'plane', 'plane', 'island', 'man', 'own', 'conscience', 'island.By', 'way', 'who', 'first', 'character', 'appearing', 'show', 'right', 'JACK', 'Jack', 'eyes.And', 'what', 'next', 'Jack', 'walking', 'forest', 'then', 'finally', 'front', 'broken', 'person', 'plane', 'people', 'were', 'there', 'were', 'Jack', 'little', 'fragments', 'characters', 'show', 'characters', 'came', 'know', 'love', 'are', 'fragments', 'Jack', 'persona', 'right', 'Lost', 'Jack', 'Lost', 'men.So', 'stop', 'start', 'think', 'hard', 'characters', 'little', 'fragment', 'Jack', 'was', 'spread', 'Jack', 'conscience', 'island', 'Jack', 'men', 'men', 'are', 'represented', 'plane', 'flight', '815.And', 'now', 'Jack', 'will', 'have', 'recover', 'fell', 'broke', 'now', 'Jack', 'will', 'have', 'put', 'fragments', 'together', 'again', 'only', 'now', 'Season', '6', 'when', 'fragments', 'find', 'one', 'once', 'called', 'parallel', 'reality', 'learn', 'final', 'seconds', 'afterlife.And', 'afterlife', 'begun', 'Juliet', 'hydrogen', 'bomb', 'who', 'Juliet', 'afterlife', 'Well', 'Juliet', 'mother', 'Jack', 'son', 'characters', 'are', 'fragments', 'Jack', 'Juliet', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'mother', 'other', 'words', 'mother', 'fragment', 'men', 'mother', 'men', 'who', 'miracle', 'closing', 'circle', 'fragments', 'meeting', 'other', 'connecting', 'other', 'being', 'one', 'again', 'Jack.And', 'so', 'finally', 'Jack', 'have', 'peace', 'most', 'beautiful', 'example.And', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Jack', 'place', 'where', 'first', 'woke', 'up', 'island', 'who', 'one', 'very', 'side', 'Jack', 'once', 'again', 'right', 'VINCENT', 'dog', 'what', 'dog', 'Well', 'dog', 'men', 'best', 'friend', 'men', 'best', 'friend', 'together', 'men', 'can', 'remember', 'very', 'first', 'sequence', 'beginning', 'series', 'when', 'Vincent', 'just', 'passes', 'not', 'side', 'Jack', 'Vincent', 'also', 'LOST', 'now', 'end', 'circle', 'closed', 'Jack', 'own', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'found', 'Now', 'Jack', 'fixed', 'one', 'again', 'complete.Once', 'fragments', 'Jack', 'was', 'Lost', 'was', 'spread', 'now', 'found', 'one', 'are', 'connected', 'are', 'ready', 'leave.It', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Once', 'again', 'plane', 'symbol', 'man', 'island', 'man', 'conscience', 'man', 'was', 'cast', 'away', 'own', 'conscience', 'When', 'episode', 'finishes', 'can', 'remember', 'Jack', 'leaving', 'place', 'fell', 'first', 'episode', 'walking', 'beach', 'looking', 'then', 'understand', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'broken', 'look', 'spread', 'fragments', 'conscience', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'journey', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'again.And', 'sum', 'are', 'left', 'two', 'words', 'broke', 'leave', 'beginning', 'are', 'broken', 'end', 'want', 'leave', 'end', 'Jack', 'ready', 'die', 'Ready', 'leave.And', 'conclude', 'what', 'was', 'plane', 'end', 'Well', 'can', 'think', 'Ajira', 'Oceanic', '815', 'even', 'plane', 'just', 'man', 'who', 'man', 'will', 'find', 'leave.What', 'beautiful', 'way', 'thinking', 'What', 'wonderful', 'ending', 'what', 'fantastic', 'show']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

This is coming from someone who absolutely loved Lost and followed it from Season 1.They spend 5 seasons building up all these mysteries of the island to only tell us that the show was about the characters and not the island. I'm sure we can find some interviews in previous seasons DVD sets with them telling us the opposite. Seasons 1-5 were great (with the exception of some of Season 3) with some of the best suspense and story telling in all of TV (or atleast all that I've seen). Season 6 was no where near that. I can forgive the lack of suspense since it was the final season but the story telling was aggravating. The only mystery they seemed to spend alot of time and effort in revealing was the one that they only brought up in Season 6, the Flash Sideways/Alternate Timeline/Alternate Universe, whatever you want to call it but it doesn't matter anyway... Those are all wrong. The series finale would have made OK episode but it definitely was not finale material.I currently own Seasons 1 - 5 on DVD. I think I will pass on Season 6 which is going to feel a little strange not having a complete collection.There was only one good episode in Season 6 and all true Lost fans know which one I'm talking about.Lost was on track to make it to my Top 3 favorite TV shows but it failed.

LOST, at least in my mind, deserved a better ending. does that negate the entire series?hardly! this was a very good dramatic series. i certainly looked forward to getting each new season on dvd, usually watching it in four or five nights. i was very into it. i highly recommend it.i just wish they had reached beyond the TWILIGHT ZONE and OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK to find a more fitting and creative, as well as maybe give a few explanations, ending. apparently, from reading other reviews, many people are happy with the ending, and that is fine. also, there are many people who feel very ripped off by the ending. i can understand that.in a nutshell...i loved the series. i do no care for the ending and had definately hoped for something different. the writers really seem to have taken the most obvious course to end the show and that is exactly what i had hoped they would not do.",4,right up till the end,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,1638,"['first', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'LOST', 'amazing', 'show', 'be', 'network', 'tv', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'abc', 'nbc', 'cbs.i', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'entire', 'time', 'preferring', 'wait', 'dvd', 'dvds', 'are', 'stunning', 'great', 'picture', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'i', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'show', 'give', 'season', '6', 'five', 'stars', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'season', '6', 'better', 'rating', 'not', 'ending', 'i', 'mean', 'come', 'exact', 'ending', 'HOPED', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'right', 'so', 'cliche', 'certainly', 'not', 'standards', 'show', 'had', 'set', 'right', 'point', 'ending', 'great', 'dramatic', 'show', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'difficult.i', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'two', 'ended', 'grace', 'dignity', 'shows', 'deserved', 'were', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'LOST', 'least', 'mind', 'deserved', 'better', 'ending', 'negate', 'entire', 'series', 'hardly', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'dramatic', 'series', 'i', 'certainly', 'looked', 'forward', 'getting', 'new', 'season', 'dvd', 'usually', 'watching', 'four', 'five', 'nights', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'i', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.i', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'reached', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'OCCURENCE', 'AT', 'OWL', 'CREEK', 'find', 'more', 'fitting', 'creative', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'give', 'few', 'explanations', 'ending', 'apparently', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'happy', 'ending', 'fine', 'also', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'very', 'ripped', 'off', 'ending', 'i', 'can', 'understand', 'that.in', 'nutshell', 'i', 'loved', 'series', 'i', 'do', 'care', 'ending', 'had', 'definately', 'hoped', 'something', 'different', 'writers', 'really', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'most', 'obvious', 'course', 'end', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'i', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'not', 'do']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

1327975,A4UGMKUSX9XHI,B0036EH3X4,Robert Stone,"[4, 7]","I don't want to wade too far into the bog of controversy on Lost's 6th season except to say that in the end the lack of answers and number of left-over loose ends was a bit unsatisfying. I do recognize that Lost was character driven and that the show created some of the most three dimensional, best fleshed out characters to ever be on television. It would have been nice, however, to see a more comprehensive set of answers in the finale.***Spoiler Alert*** After all, one of the creators very early on rejected speculation that the characters had died and the island was some sort of purgatory, when that indeed was the direction they took it, though well beyond the most simplistic interpretation along those lines.I even had crafted a detailed speculation that the island existed just to corral a living evil dust-creature brought back by accident from the Moon in during the Apollo flights. So much for my powers of deduction! This was based on an odd zoom-in shot of an Apollo candy bar during the second season, which apparently did not really have much meaning after all.In any case, most people know the story or watched it already and they are here looking for reviews on quality of picture, etc. From a technical standpoint, these discs are excellent. The picture quality is terrific - as with most modern blu-rays it can be too good - often if the camera operator is just a hair out of focus (pun intended) you will notice this whereas you would not be able to see the difference in standard definition.My wife and I also enjoyed many of the extra features but hands down our favorite was ""season play."" This feature allows you to establish a ""save point"" which lets you to go back to exactly where you left off even after playing other discs in your player. This is an absolutely terrific feature for parents who might be able to steal just a little time once the kids are finally asleep - searching for just where you left off would otherwise be quite painful especially when stopping mid show.Anyway, whether you liked and want to re-watch the 6th season or if like us you realized a couple were missing from your TiVo so you just waited to get them on disc to watch commercial-free then this set is a good buy.",4,A Solid Blu-Ray,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,2227,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wade', 'too', 'far', 'bog', 'controversy', 'Lost', '6th', 'season', 'say', 'end', 'lack', 'answers', 'number', 'left-over', 'loose', 'ends', 'was', 'bit', 'unsatisfying', 'do', 'recognize', 'Lost', 'was', 'character', 'driven', 'show', 'created', 'most', 'three', 'dimensional', 'best', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'ever', 'be', 'television', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'however', 'see', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'set', 'answers', 'finale', '***Spoiler', 'Alert***', 'one', 'creators', 'very', 'early', 'rejected', 'speculation', 'characters', 'had', 'died', 'island', 'was', 'sort', 'purgatory', 'when', 'indeed', 'was', 'direction', 'took', 'though', 'well', 'most', 'simplistic', 'interpretation', 'lines.I', 'even', 'had', 'crafted', 'detailed', 'speculation', 'island', 'existed', 'just', 'corral', 'living', 'evil', 'dust-creature', 'brought', 'back', 'accident', 'Moon', 'Apollo', 'flights', 'So', 'much', 'powers', 'deduction', 'was', 'based', 'odd', 'zoom-in', 'shot', 'Apollo', 'candy', 'bar', 'second', 'season', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'much', 'meaning', 'all.In', 'case', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'story', 'watched', 'already', 'are', 'here', 'looking', 'reviews', 'quality', 'picture', 'etc', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'discs', 'are', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'terrific', 'most', 'modern', 'blu-rays', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'good', 'often', 'camera', 'operator', 'just', 'hair', 'focus', 'pun', 'intended', 'will', 'notice', 'whereas', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'difference', 'standard', 'definition.My', 'wife', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'extra', 'features', 'down', 'favorite', 'was', 'season', 'play', 'feature', 'establish', 'save', 'point', 'go', 'back', 'exactly', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'even', 'playing', 'other', 'discs', 'player', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'feature', 'parents', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'steal', 'just', 'little', 'time', 'kids', 'are', 'finally', 'asleep', 'searching', 'just', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'quite', 'painful', 'especially', 'when', 'stopping', 'mid', 'show.Anyway', 'liked', 'want', 're-watch', '6th', 'season', 'realized', 'couple', 'were', 'missing', 'TiVo', 'just', 'waited', 'get', 'disc', 'watch', 'commercial-free', 'then', 'set', 'good', 'buy']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

Leading up to the air date of the first episode of season 6, there was a ton of press coverage, promotional trailers, posters, teaser, etc. The hype was nonstop, and the fans were salivating more than ever. Expectations were ridiculously high--much higher than they ever were for the previous 5 seasons. Season 5 left us fans with many mysteries to ponder upon, and Abrams and Lindelof promised that questions would be answered.Were there any answers?I'm going to disagree with a good portion of the reviewers here and say: Yes, yes they were. Season 6 provided a lot more closure than many fans are willing to admit.I'm sure a good portion of fans who are reading this review (if any at all) are already moaning, groaning and rolling their eyes, but I ask those fans to consider something: Season 6 gave an answer to the smoke monster, the man in black, the nature of Jacob, the ""reason"" that they were all there (c'mon, that's been argued over since Season 1), the whispers, Richard Alpert's story, the effects of the incident, the sickness that consumed Danielle's crew, the overall point of the island, the wheel that Ben used, the source of the electromagnetism and what it does, the statue of Tarawet and how most of it got destroyed, the Black Rock, the origin of the others and their reason for being there, and the temple that's been talked about since the Season 3 finale. I'm not pulling these out of thin air, either. Re-watch the season. For that matter, re-watch the whole show, and then tell me that this season didn't resolve any plot threads. And let's not forget what the previous season have answered, which is much more than fans are, once again, willing to admit. Re-watching the series from the beginning has helped me realize that there really wasn't a whole lot to clear up after the show was finished, though I admit that a few plot threads were left hanging.It makes me sad to see this season criticized for not fulfilling any promises, when in fact it did, but it requires memory of everything else the series has answered, as well has subtly answered. 6 was hyped up so much that many fans (including myself) put it on some unreachable pedestal, one that no TV show could ever compare to. That's just what happens in a case like this, and it's almost inevitable. Even Abrams and Lindelof seemed to be getting rather defensive when the backlash erupted.But forget all of that for now. Let's just focus on the show. As always, there are many powerful performances by all of the lead actors. Terry O'Quinn does an outstanding, sinister performance as the man in black that has taken on the form of the deceased John Locke. The story arc of Matthew Fox's character, Jack Shephard, finally comes full circle with realizing his true destiny and rethinking everything he's done on the island. Ben (Michael Emerson) is as deceitful and evil as ever, but even he makes some highly noticeable changes midway through the season. Hurley's ability to talk to dead people is more important than ever, Richard's faith in Jacob is taken to its limits, and the entire LOST team is, once again, divided up. As usual, the show is very entertaining with spectacular performances, plot twists, drama, and none of the characters' dialogue or actions seem out of place. I'll actually admit that I felt underwhelmed at times, but thinking through everything I saw, as well as refreshing my memory on the show, has helped me to not only appreciate the season, but to love it as I love the ones that came before it.However, I can't give this season the full 5 stars. Sadly, it wasn't perfect, and despite my enjoyment, there were certainly things that could have been done better. The biggest problem with Season 6 is its pacing. Too much time was spent within the temple, and much of the time in this Egyptian maze dragged its feet, sometimes unsure of where it was going. Shoving the Dogen character down our throats and expecting us to care about him felt rather forced and unnatural. Once he was killed, it was stated  that he was the only thing keeping MIB out of the temple. Why is that? I felt they could have spent even a tad of those episodes explaining the reason for this. Surely it had something to do with Jacob assigning him the role, but it was mishandled. Watching the man in black go postal on that place was certainly a Godsend for many fans, myself included. Another portion of the show was spent on the beach just preparing for things to come, as opposed to anyone actually doing anything. It felt tired and, dare I say it, uninspired. It didn't seem smart for the show to be doing this on what is supposed to be the resolution to everything. Lastly, there is the flash-sideways timeline, or ""alternate reality,"" as many fans called it. The true nature of this story line isn't understood until the very last few minutes of the finale. After much thinking and processing, it certainly helps make this side of the story a lot more enjoyable and even relevant (much more relevant than many fans say it is), it doesn't help the previous episodes that they waited entirely too long to explain it. And the two ""realities"" don't even begin to connect until the 11th episode, with only 6 more to go. It was difficult for many fans to grasp the point and relevance of this reality, though I don't mean to suggest that too many fans simply have low intellects. The MIB and Jacob-centric episode ""Across the Sea"" was not as epic and incredible as it could have and certainly had the right to have been. Some parts felt anticlimactic. However, I'm on the side of fans that really liked this episode, and it gave closure to a lot more things than most fans say it did (are you noticing a trend here?).I'll stop with the criticisms because I feel I'm representing my opinion as being a lot more negative than it actually is (it's actually quite positive). Season 6 was very well done, despite a few shortcomings. The episode that I have to give special note to is the finale, otherwise known as ""The End."" What can I say? I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I watched in awe, and my heart was warmed more than it ever had been by the show. The ""light"" that the protector of the island is meant to protect seems to be a highly symbolic sort of plot device. I'll admit that I'm still trying to figure it out, but it certainly helps answer what the role of Jacob was, and what the role of anyone who is assigned the protector is. I can say without a doubt that the ""alternate reality"" is certainly connected to this light, and part of why it is so necessary to keep it safe. Some fans saw this as a cop-out, along with the AR, but I argue that it fits in with the show as well as everything else we've seen, if you give it a little thought.Out of all the answers that fans deny that Season 6 gave, no fan can argue that it gave a successful conclusion to each characters' story arc. Watching them evolve over so many episodes has been highly rewarding, and watching them find redemption is easily one of the best and most beautiful scenes of the entire show. I don't feel cheated whatsoever by the ending, and I don't think I would have it end any other way. I applaud the writers and producers for taking such a big risk for the end of their money maker. A new storytelling device and theme is given to each season, and season 6 was no different. It was risky, and they probably knew that some fans would be disappointed, but they created an extremely rewarding experience for this fan and many others. If you're a fan that's been following the show, you owe it to yourself to give this final piece of the puzzle a chance to fit in with the others.",4,A solid and unfairly bashed conclusion.

Thankfully the ending is faithful to the series and delivers the closure for the characters. Yes some of the islands mysteries were left unanswered, but most were. Also the ones that were left are simple and can be filled in with some thought and imagination. All of the characters are given a beautiful sendoff and leave you with complete closure for the characters. Not a single character is left without an ending. All of them are given the time and attention they deserve in this final season, and some amazing acting from the always stellar cast seals the deal. Is this the best season of Lost? No I don't think so, but it ranks number three on my list trailing season three and season one. The series finale though sits very high on my list and I find myself watching it over and over and each time I am left breathless by the beauty of the final episode and final scene in particular. The series ends on a high note, and don't let the low ratings others are giving it scare you away.

1327995,AWZ10PC2278KF,B0036EH3X4,the exchanger,"[6, 19]","this season was divided into 2 stories, the island and the people on it, and another story called the alternate universe by most, which had the same actors in similar roles but they never crashed on the island.  This 2nd storyline led to much thought, with everyone watching trying to figure out how it fit into the big picture.The Island story was excellent, slow in a few spots but revealing more than ever before about the mysteries of the island.  And it leads into an exciting conclusion which i won't spoil here.The alternate story however turned out to be a total waste of investment into it, as it proved to be an unreal story of island souls wasting time until jack joined them.  If this alternate story had taken place JUST in the finale 2 1/2 hour finale, it might have been a superb conclusion to the series.  BUT because the previous episodes nearly all split the time with the alternate universe and that universe turned out to be a fantasy with no basis in the rest of the series, and it didn't even make sense with the final episode, about 1/2 the season was wasted when it could have been all about the island with many more secrets revealed and a bigger storyline could have been used.  Instead we got stories with Jin in a freezer, his wife getting shot in the stomach, Jack having a son who didn't exist, Locke becoming a teacher with Ben, and none of it meant anything in the end.  A case can be made for the (alternate) end having meaning but everything 'alternate' prior to the finale ultimately meant nothing and became irrelevant when the finale was shown.An intriguing story became worthless and a lot of time was wasted watching it.  They should have condensed the 'alternate's' into just the finale and left the island story by itself.If you watch it it can still be worth watching.  Just forward past the alternate stories as you go along, hold off watching the 'ab aeterno' episode AFTER the episode featuring Jacob and his brother and their adopted mother for better continuity, followed by the remaining episodes, and then watch all the alternate stories before watching the finale.

How could the same writers who crafted such brilliant stories, characters and myths for five seasons, completely, and I mean COMPLETLEY, screw up the last season so badly?  It's like season's 1-5 were written by geniuses with multiple PhDs and season six was written by kindergarteners.  Season 6 is THAT bad.  No knock on kindergarteners, BUT... Where was the brilliant writing?  Why was virtually everything that was built up in 1-5 completely ABANDONED!!!???  It's like Season 6 had NOTHING to do with 1-5.  And the writers had EVERYTHING in place to create a mind-blowing finish to the series.  Jacob and his MIB brother SHOULD have been God and the Devil, Aliens from another planet, some beings that were powerful, significant and meaningful with clear and definitive purposes, goals, powers and weaknesses.  Jacob SHOULD NOT have been killed off at the end of 5.  And Season 6 should have been simply Jacob, MIB, Linus and Widmore all battling for control of the island with our great heroes, the awesome survivors, in the middle of it all and the fate of the entire world at stake!!!  And the heroes saving the island and the world (or not!).  Now THAT would have been a fantastic final season!  Instead we got meaningless, unexplainable, unsatisfying drivel that makes zero logical sense.  If I said I HATED Season 6 it would be too kind, too much praise.If you have not seen Season 6 yet, DO NOT watch it!  Do yourself a huge favor and consider 1-5 the entire series.

Some may be dissapointed to find that the latter is not the case. But in a show this complex, can everything really be properly explained? There have been flaws and a few pointless episodes throughout the entire series, but in the end, it doesn't matter. Because the end is beautiful and morose at the same time. It all makes sense, as strange as that sounds, and it wraps up solemnly and quietly, and though you wish it could go on forever and ever, you realize, this is the perfect way to end it.

The series should have ended after Season Five, with Juliet's successful explosion of the Nuke, followed by a brief epilogue.  A little thought after getting over the cheap emotions of the finale's reunion of lovers will give everyone pause - the story and plot simply made no sense as there were too many obviously unanswered questions.  Oh, but it was just Jack's nano-second of post death experience.  Who cares, then, what happenned if it was Jack's dream.A better ending would have been to use the sideways flashes to legitimize what Juliet did in the Season Five finale.  That was the alternate world created by her successfully exploding the Nuke and changing time in the process.  And the reunions could have been the door opening to the world of Lost that went on in some parallel universe unknown to the sideways characters.

1328011,AFEN54UGJQOK9,B0036EH3X4,"wally gator ""the only""","[5, 16]","After my few years of LOST watching I have learned not to include spoilers when talking or writing about the show. Peeps should can the spoilers, and if you have not yet viewed the season AVOID them like you would an evil infection.Try not to be swayed by the haters. I will not defend against them, I will only say that season six was without a doubt the most complicated season to grasp as a whole and since that is the case, in the end split the fan base into several directions.Season six deals heavily in the islands mythology. Where season five dealt heavily in time travel and the history of Dharma, six almost releases itself from the grip of time all together. The Jacob/Man In Black theme is expanded and very hard to understand.  ACROSS THE SEA is the culminating point of the island mythology, where a major question was promised to be addressed. Well it was, but the answer that was given shattered the fan base into more pieces then a certain light house mirror that I wont get into specifics about.Lets just say that I believe about 99 point 9 percent of the viewers totally missed the point of Across the Sea. I thought that episode was completely bad ass. Since even the peeps who watched the episode fifty times still think my theory is wrong ands I dont want to include spoilers, You can check out what I really think at Lostblog.net.The production was not as lush as previous seasons in a lot of episodes, (except AB AETERNO, a brilliant Richard centric ep. which shows that Lost could easily remain on air as various movies of the week) and the pacing is way different, but it didn't stop me from watching and rewatching episodes over and over. This is the greatest show of all time, and I loved six as much as others. You should just try and enjoy the ride on the first go through, then assemble the puzzle after. Just remember, where season six may contain fifty puzzle pieces, most peeps just grabbed up three at the end, looked at them for three seconds and then declared that it didn't make any sense.

1328013,A15U46ZENEHGTH,B0036EH3X4,Wicked_Smaht,"[5, 7]","It's inevitable that a series as intriguing as Lost would have a finale that's extremely polarizing in its resolution. What started off as a great series eventually got mired in its own mythology to the point where none of it was going to pay off satisfactorily. The overall problem is that Lost is a show that relied on a serial format and with a serial format, you have to give fans enough of a reson to keep coming back - unfortunately, that can sometimes lead to a wild number of implausabilities and half-cocked explanations. I consider myself a fan of the show (and I still enjoy it on the whole), but I'd be lying if I didn't say that it seemed as though the writers wrote themselves into a corner they couldn't get out of (and all the flashbacks, flashforwards and flash-ups and downs in the world can't mask sloppy writing.) The fact of the matter is this: it feels like a cop-out for a show as initially well-written as this was to simply explain away its own internal logic with explanations like ""it's magic"" or to introduce deus ex machina devices in the end in order to wrap up storylines that otherwise have no explanation. Sure, I enjoy ambiguities, symbolism and metaphor as much as the next viewer, but to simply assume that the series ""is all about the characters"" in an effort to get away with not having to explain some things feels a little lazy. I'm okay with having some mysteries left unexplained and I'm okay with whipping a little quasi-religious allegory in a show that's otherwise meant to intrigue people, but man... did it ever go overboard in this season.Ultimately, there's no way to predict how the average fan of this show will view this final season - you'll either love it and accept it (flaws and all) or you'll hate it and feel cheated (while also wondering why you devoted so much time to a series that wrapped up so haphazardly.) In all honesty, this is not the season that best represents this show (for that, I would point you to Seasons 1 and 2) and it's unfortunate considering it's the season that provides the most answers to the island's many lingering mysteries. I suppose it's easy to complain that the series eventually collapsed under the weight of its own mythology (and the ""we're more clever than you... oh, and we totally know where this is going"" attitude that emerged in Season 3), but it was definitely one of the better shows of the past decade; otherwise, why would people spend this much time debating the nuances (subtle and otherwise) of it? Your enjoyment of the finale will depend largely on how far you're willing to go with your suspension of disbelief and how much you're willing to be satisfied with less-than-definitive answers.For me, I came down in the middle. I love the show (and still do), but am perfectly willing to admit to its many flaws. There definitely seemed to be a sense of  the writers making cool stuff up as they went along with no thought as to how they'd resolve, explain or allude to the backstory of a large number of things and that's too bad. In the end, after this 6th and final season, the creators of the show seemed to be just a little foresight shy of creating a genuine masterpiece. Take that for what you will, but it's just one fan's opinion.Oh, and for the record: ""Across the Sea"" was probably the worst episode of the entire series. How this ended up as one of the series' penultimate episodes is beyond me. If it was entirely within the realm of possibility, I would punch this episode in the face. Romulus and Remus/Cain and Abel-type nonsense and crazy Allison Janney for an entire hour? Really? Again, just one fan's opinion, but you'd probably be better off skipping this episode on this box set.I love this series, but I do admit the ending left me wanting. If you've gone through the prior 5 seasons, you do owe it to yourself to see how they ended this thing - just don't expect it to end as wonderfully as it began.",3,"""Lost"" In Its Own Mythology...",1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,3930,"['inevitable', 'series', 'as', 'intriguing', 'Lost', 'would', 'have', 'finale', 'extremely', 'polarizing', 'resolution', 'What', 'started', 'off', 'great', 'series', 'eventually', 'got', 'mired', 'own', 'mythology', 'point', 'where', 'none', 'was', 'going', 'pay', 'off', 'satisfactorily', 'overall', 'problem', 'Lost', 'show', 'relied', 'serial', 'format', 'serial', 'format', 'have', 'give', 'fans', 'enough', 'reson', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'sometimes', 'lead', 'wild', 'number', 'implausabilities', 'half-cocked', 'explanations', 'consider', 'fan', 'show', 'still', 'enjoy', 'whole', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'seemed', 'writers', 'wrote', 'corner', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'flash-ups', 'downs', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mask', 'sloppy', 'writing', 'fact', 'matter', 'cop-out', 'show', 'initially', 'well-written', 'was', 'simply', 'explain', 'away', 'own', 'internal', 'logic', 'explanations', 'magic', 'introduce', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'devices', 'end', 'order', 'wrap', 'up', 'storylines', 'otherwise', 'have', 'explanation', 'Sure', 'enjoy', 'ambiguities', 'symbolism', 'metaphor', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'viewer', 'simply', 'assume', 'series', 'characters', 'effort', 'get', 'away', 'not', 'having', 'explain', 'things', 'feels', 'little', 'lazy', ""'m"", 'okay', 'having', 'mysteries', 'left', 'unexplained', ""'m"", 'okay', 'whipping', 'little', 'quasi-religious', 'allegory', 'show', 'otherwise', 'meant', 'intrigue', 'people', 'man', 'did', 'ever', 'go', 'overboard', 'season.Ultimately', 'way', 'predict', 'how', 'average', 'fan', 'show', 'will', 'view', 'final', 'season', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'accept', 'flaws', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'feel', 'cheated', 'also', 'wondering', 'why', 'devoted', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'series', 'wrapped', 'up', 'so', 'haphazardly', 'honesty', 'not', 'season', 'best', 'show', 'would', 'point', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'unfortunate', 'considering', 'season', 'most', 'answers', 'island', 'many', 'lingering', 'mysteries', 'suppose', 'easy', 'complain', 'series', 'eventually', 'collapsed', 'weight', 'own', 'mythology', ""'re"", 'more', 'clever', 'oh', 'totally', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'attitude', 'emerged', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'shows', 'past', 'decade', 'otherwise', 'why', 'would', 'people', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'debating', 'nuances', 'subtle', 'otherwise', 'enjoyment', 'finale', 'will', 'depend', 'largely', 'how', 'far', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'how', 'much', ""'re"", 'willing', 'be', 'satisfied', 'less-than-definitive', 'answers.For', 'came', 'down', 'middle', 'love', 'show', 'still', 'do', 'am', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'admit', 'many', 'flaws', 'definitely', 'seemed', 'be', 'sense', 'writers', 'making', 'cool', 'stuff', 'up', 'went', 'thought', 'as', 'how', ""'d"", 'resolve', 'explain', 'allude', 'backstory', 'large', 'number', 'things', 'too', 'bad', 'end', '6th', 'final', 'season', 'creators', 'show', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'foresight', 'shy', 'creating', 'genuine', 'masterpiece', 'Take', 'what', 'will', 'just', 'one', 'fan', 'opinion.Oh', 'record', 'Sea', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'How', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'series', 'penultimate', 'episodes', 'was', 'entirely', 'realm', 'possibility', 'would', 'punch', 'episode', 'face', 'Remus/Cain', 'Abel-type', 'nonsense', 'crazy', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'entire', 'hour', 'Really', 'Again', 'just', 'one', 'fan', 'opinion', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'skipping', 'episode', 'box', 'love', 'series', 'do', 'admit', 'ending', 'left', 'wanting', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'prior', '5', 'seasons', 'do', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'how', 'ended', 'thing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'end', 'as', 'wonderfully', 'began']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season

When those characters offer information or enlightenment regarding the storylines they find themselves part of it must be because the author is speaking to his viewers. If those protagonists are too frequently wrong in their assertions, without the literary device of allowing the reader or viewer to see behind the veil of disinformation and thus increase dramatic tension as they wait to see what happens next, the writer finds himself with no integrity in the eyes of his audience - the audience ceases to suspend disbelief and simply disbelieves.So it is with Lost.I could cope with the back and forth flip-flopping of allegiances (a throwback to badly written 1930's movie serials trying to fill time), the over-extended schmaltzy moments in the script and the lack of true to life responses to extraordinary experiences, but I find it intolerable the kind of dishonesty presented in the last few episodes of this sixth and final season. And it is criminal that a program with the budget and talent Lost had would resort to the worst types of juvenile cop-outs to complete it's story.How often must the character's assertions be wrong simply to enable the plot to go where it's writers want it to? When it becomes EVERY time, as it has with Lost, that is where dishonesty comes in. And when the plot and it's solutions are as weak as Cuse and Lindelof have arranged it, it is quite the let-down.There is no excuse for the bad writing to be found in this season. Adding new characters to explain events that have progressed over multi-season's worth of story in the final three episodes is an old cheap and lazy ploy worthy of Agatha Christie.I don't even want to address how the most fundamental of the Island's mysteries are never addressed or resolved, mysteries which were the carrot leading the nose of the audience for six years. When portraying the cosmically stupefying the H.P. Lovecraft tactic of 'restraint of explanation' is very effective and eerie. Cuse and Lindelof are great at producing fascinating mysteries, but in the end it's like watching a magician taunt and tease you with dramatic flourishes until at long last - there really is NO rabbit up his sleeve after all.And they do not allow you to even have used your imagination to produce resolutions and explanations. They tell you everything you thought you knew was wrong (though THEY were the ones who told you in the first place!) and offer a completely different and weak explanation that, sadly, is now canon.If you are the type of person who loves a great ride for the sake of the ride and not because you just want to get to the last lap then by all means, immerse yourself in Lost, but be prepared for a letdown at the finish.I really loved Lost. I loved it for it's restraint which some considered teasing. I loved it for it's smart dialogue and human characters. I loved it for it's absence of contrived elements. I loved it for it's mystery and it's scope.Yet all these elements are discarded by Lindelof and Cuse in this sixth season, and if ever I am aware of their involvement in another film I will run the other way as fast as my legs can carry me.Sorry Damon and Carleton - you only get to fool me once.Your exiled fom MY Island.And now, I'm tortured between ""completism"": buying this sixth season set or selling my seasons one through five and being done with it - because I don't see the point of ever putting this show on the player again.Affairs of the heart, like my love for Lost, will be that complicated.",1,CONTENT ONLY - DISAPPOINTING.,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,4082,"['spoilers', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'season', 'conclusion', ""'ll"", 'find', 'difficult', 'NOT', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'referring', 'to.Lost', 'been', 'great', 'ride', 'amusement', 'park', 'roller', 'coasters', 'slow', 'crawl', 'finish', 'stop', 'dead', 'dump', 'out.Lindelof', 'Cuse', 'made', 'use', 'fantastic', 'concepts', 'time', 'end', 'ignored', 'own', 'plot', 'threads', 'completely', 'unraveled', 'spun', 'something', 'else', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'something', 'less', 'worthy', 'audiences', 'attention.A', 'writer', 'speaks', 'audience', 'characters', 'When', 'characters', 'offer', 'information', 'enlightenment', 'regarding', 'storylines', 'find', 'part', 'must', 'be', 'author', 'speaking', 'viewers', 'protagonists', 'are', 'too', 'frequently', 'wrong', 'assertions', 'literary', 'device', 'allowing', 'reader', 'viewer', 'see', 'veil', 'disinformation', 'thus', 'increase', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'writer', 'integrity', 'eyes', 'audience', 'audience', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'simply', 'disbelieves.So', 'Lost.I', 'could', 'cope', 'back', 'forth', 'flip-flopping', 'allegiances', 'throwback', 'badly', 'written', '1930', 'movie', 'serials', 'trying', 'fill', 'time', 'over-extended', 'schmaltzy', 'moments', 'script', 'lack', 'true', 'life', 'responses', 'extraordinary', 'experiences', 'find', 'intolerable', 'kind', 'dishonesty', 'presented', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'criminal', 'program', 'budget', 'talent', 'Lost', 'had', 'would', 'resort', 'worst', 'types', 'juvenile', 'cop-outs', 'complete', 'story.How', 'often', 'must', 'character', 'assertions', 'be', 'wrong', 'simply', 'enable', 'plot', 'go', 'where', 'writers', 'want', 'When', 'EVERY', 'time', 'Lost', 'where', 'dishonesty', 'when', 'plot', 'solutions', 'are', 'as', 'weak', 'Cuse', 'Lindelof', 'have', 'arranged', 'quite', 'let-down.There', 'excuse', 'bad', 'writing', 'be', 'found', 'season', 'Adding', 'new', 'characters', 'explain', 'events', 'have', 'progressed', 'multi-season', 'worth', 'story', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'old', 'cheap', 'lazy', 'ploy', 'worthy', 'Agatha', 'Christie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'address', 'how', 'most', 'fundamental', 'Island', 'mysteries', 'are', 'never', 'addressed', 'resolved', 'mysteries', 'were', 'carrot', 'leading', 'nose', 'audience', 'six', 'years', 'When', 'portraying', 'cosmically', 'stupefying', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'tactic', ""'restraint"", 'explanation', 'very', 'effective', 'eerie', 'Cuse', 'Lindelof', 'are', 'great', 'producing', 'fascinating', 'mysteries', 'end', 'watching', 'magician', 'taunt', 'tease', 'dramatic', 'flourishes', 'long', 'last', 'really', 'NO', 'rabbit', 'up', 'sleeve', 'all.And', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'even', 'have', 'used', 'imagination', 'produce', 'resolutions', 'explanations', 'tell', 'everything', 'thought', 'knew', 'was', 'wrong', 'THEY', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'told', 'first', 'place', 'offer', 'completely', 'different', 'weak', 'explanation', 'sadly', 'now', 'canon.If', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'great', 'ride', 'sake', 'ride', 'not', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'last', 'lap', 'then', 'means', 'immerse', 'Lost', 'be', 'prepared', 'letdown', 'finish.I', 'really', 'loved', 'Lost', 'loved', 'restraint', 'considered', 'teasing', 'loved', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'human', 'characters', 'loved', 'absence', 'contrived', 'elements', 'loved', 'mystery', 'elements', 'are', 'discarded', 'Lindelof', 'Cuse', 'sixth', 'season', 'ever', 'am', 'aware', 'involvement', 'film', 'will', 'run', 'other', 'way', 'fast', 'legs', 'can', 'carry', 'me.Sorry', 'Damon', 'Carleton', 'only', 'get', 'fool', 'exiled', 'fom', 'MY', 'Island.And', 'now', ""'m"", 'tortured', 'completism', 'buying', 'sixth', 'season', 'set', 'selling', 'seasons', 'one', 'five', 'being', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'ever', 'putting', 'show', 'player', 'again.Affairs', 'heart', 'love', 'Lost', 'will', 'be', 'complicated']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season
1328016,AP3B615GM191G,B0036EH3X4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[14, 26]","In the annals of television history, LOST occupied a unique position, that being the ability to set its own ending date.  Thus, when this Sixth Season debuted in 2010, everybody knew it would be the final go-round.  As a result, the ABC advertising machine cranked out spot after spot regarding how ""all questions would be answered"" in this final season.  One could almost accuse them of false advertising.Why is that important to the review of this product?  Because it will severely affect the way you perceive the sixth and final season of LOST.  If you hang on every promo ""guaranteeing"" you answers and are disappointed when the episode doesn't answer everything (like I did for about the first half of the season), this season will be a monumental disappointment for you.  However, if you just sit back and enjoy the ride like in the previous five seasons (what I eventually did for the latter half of the season), you will find things most enjoyable once again.For a brief summary of season six (some spoilers ahead), we rejoin our castaways wondering whether or not the explosion at the end of Season Five worked.  It seems it has...and hasn't.  On one hand, the Oceanic 815 survivors are still on the island (having been blown forward in time to the present) like the bomb didn't work.  However, flash-sideways show a glimpse into a life where supposedly the bomb DID work and Oceanic 815 lands as planned.  The rest of the season goes back and forth between the two, as well as explaining more about characters such as Richard Alpert, Jacob, and the Man in Black (who takes on an enormous role in this final campaign).  Then, of course, there is the ending, which will easily go down in history as one of the most stunning (whether good or bad) of all-time.There are many good and bad things that can be said about the final season of LOST, but here is why I enjoyed it: Once again, JJ Abrams, Carlton Cuse, and Damon Lindolof managed to blow my mind.  Once I started to sit back and enjoy the ride instead of hanging on every sentence for some sort of ""answer"", I began to enjoy this season as immensely as any previous.  My only real complaint is that it took the ENTIRE season (literally, down to the final scene) to understand exactly what the flash-sideways meant.  It wasn't like Season Four (flash-forwards) or Season Five (time-travel) that laid out the new and mind-blowing premise right at the very beginning.  This time, there is a whole lot of confusion before understanding finally comes (making a repeat viewing almost necessary to fully appreciate the season).As for that ""controversial"" ending, let me just say this: despite all the venom being spewed about it at this time, it is very possible that you just might enjoy it to the fullest (like I did).  It will take a little while to process everything you see in the big finale episode, but once it ""goes through"" you will be able to make the decision of whether or not you found it a worthy ending to the greatest TV show ever produced.  Contrary to current popular opinion, it is possible to answer that question in the affirmative.Thus, although I truly believe that LOST was at its very peak in seasons 2-4, I cannot drop this season below five stars due to continued quality storylines, characters, and mind-bending thematic material.  Please, though, don't go in with your guard up and notebook in hand.  Just watch, enjoy, bask, and (most importantly) FEEL.  If you can do those things, this season will rise above its so-so reputation for you.",5,Don't Buy Into Hype...Just Sit Back & Enjoy,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,3529,"['annals', 'television', 'history', 'LOST', 'occupied', 'unique', 'position', 'being', 'ability', 'set', 'own', 'ending', 'date', 'Thus', 'when', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'debuted', '2010', 'everybody', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'go-round', 'result', 'ABC', 'advertising', 'machine', 'cranked', 'out', 'spot', 'spot', 'regarding', 'how', 'questions', 'would', 'be', 'answered', 'final', 'season', 'One', 'could', 'almost', 'accuse', 'false', 'advertising.Why', 'important', 'review', 'product', 'will', 'severely', 'affect', 'way', 'perceive', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'LOST', 'hang', 'promo', 'guaranteeing', 'answers', 'are', 'disappointed', 'when', 'episode', ""n't"", 'answer', 'everything', 'did', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'monumental', 'disappointment', 'However', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'previous', 'five', 'seasons', 'what', 'eventually', 'did', 'latter', 'half', 'season', 'will', 'find', 'things', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'once', 'again.For', 'brief', 'summary', 'season', 'six', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'rejoin', 'castaways', 'wondering', 'not', 'explosion', 'end', 'Season', 'Five', 'worked', ""n't"", 'one', 'hand', 'Oceanic', '815', 'survivors', 'are', 'still', 'island', 'having', 'been', 'blown', 'forward', 'time', 'present', 'bomb', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'However', 'flash-sideways', 'show', 'glimpse', 'life', 'where', 'supposedly', 'bomb', 'DID', 'work', 'Oceanic', '815', 'lands', 'planned', 'rest', 'season', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'explaining', 'more', 'characters', 'such', 'Richard', 'Alpert', 'Jacob', 'Man', 'Black', 'who', 'enormous', 'role', 'final', 'campaign', 'Then', 'course', 'ending', 'will', 'easily', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'good', 'bad', 'all-time.There', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'final', 'season', 'LOST', 'here', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'Once', 'again', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'Carlton', 'Cuse', 'Damon', 'Lindolof', 'managed', 'blow', 'mind', 'Once', 'started', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'instead', 'hanging', 'sentence', 'sort', 'answer', 'began', 'enjoy', 'season', 'as', 'immensely', 'previous', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'took', 'ENTIRE', 'season', 'literally', 'down', 'final', 'scene', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'flash-sideways', 'meant', 'was', ""n't"", 'Season', 'Four', 'flash-forwards', 'Season', 'Five', 'time-travel', 'laid', 'out', 'new', 'mind-blowing', 'premise', 'right', 'very', 'beginning', 'time', 'whole', 'lot', 'confusion', 'understanding', 'finally', 'making', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'almost', 'necessary', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'season', '.As', 'controversial', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'venom', 'being', 'spewed', 'time', 'very', 'possible', 'just', 'might', 'enjoy', 'fullest', 'did', 'will', 'take', 'little', 'while', 'process', 'everything', 'see', 'big', 'finale', 'episode', 'once', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'decision', 'not', 'found', 'worthy', 'ending', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'produced', 'Contrary', 'current', 'popular', 'opinion', 'possible', 'answer', 'question', 'affirmative.Thus', 'truly', 'believe', 'LOST', 'was', 'very', 'peak', 'seasons', '2-4', 'can', 'not', 'drop', 'season', 'five', 'stars', 'due', 'continued', 'quality', 'storylines', 'characters', 'mind-bending', 'thematic', 'material', 'Please', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'guard', 'up', 'notebook', 'hand', 'Just', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'bask', 'most', 'importantly', 'FEEL', 'can', 'do', 'things', 'season', 'will', 'rise', 'so-so', 'reputation']",Lost: The Complete Sixth and Final Season
