I have several of these MTC Christmas program DVD's.  This is by far the best and my personal favorite.  Nathan Gunn lends his wonderful talents as a singer to the powerful and beautiful Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which is always glorious.  If you only get one of these Christmas DVD's, this is the one to get.",5,Beautiful program,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,383,"['Jane', 'Seymour', 'telling', 'story', 'Good', 'King', 'Wensislos', 'remarkable', 'have', 'several', 'MTC', 'Christmas', 'program', 'DVD', 'far', 'best', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Nathan', 'Gunn', 'wonderful', 'talents', 'singer', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'Mormon', 'Tabernacle', 'Choir', 'always', 'glorious', 'only', 'get', 'one', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'one', 'get']",N/A
1582605,A2ITCZXIG17QQI,B00911LAP8,"moviesRme ""kino""","[9, 13]","Personally, I found this 2011 Christmas Concert (2012 DVD release) by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and guest artists lacked the lustre and the WOW factor that I have seen in concerts by the choir and their guest artists over the past eight+ years.Yes, the choir and the fantastic orchestra were up to their usual standard - in fact they are always superb, but the show as a whole had a very sombre feel about it.  Having a Medieval theme, it looked as though there had been some budget cuts to the settings, this one being the most minimal in years.I was waiting for the WOW factor to happen, but I was disappointed that it didn't elevate up to the usual emotional highs of past shows.  However, the presentation of 'Good King Wenceslas' narrated and told by British film and TV actress Jane Seymour was for me, the highlight of the show.  The usual production values were contained therein with a magnificent choir and orchestra, snowflake ballet, dancers, acrobats, juggler and 'snow' floating down from the gantry.  Most impressive!  Nathan Gunn has a great voice, but seemed to lack charisma on the stage.  He is so much  more animated in his interviews on the 'extras.'  The lighting was very unimaginative throughout other parts of the program, and so were the shots of the audience.  You could hardly see them and this is one venue where a little more subtle lighting on the audience is a must, as it gives full dimension to the venue's gigantic size.  And it is impressive, seating 21,000 people.(As an aside: Another point of view that has bothered me over the past few years is that when a person is narrating a story (Jane Seymour is a good example), why in heaven must we see camera shots from 4 different angles while they are speaking.  It seems that the director has said, ""ok guys we've got 4 cameras on the speaker, let's use them.""  It's very off-putting and there is absolutely no purpose for this style of directing that has now crept into productions of value.  Are they appealing to teenagers who have an attention span of a mosquito and get 'bored' if a shot is held for more than 5 seconds?  A few years ago it was 'wobbly cam' - thank goodness that has almost disappeared today).Compared to the concerts of the past on DVD with guest artists such as, The King's Singers, Natalie Cole, Sissel, Frederica von Stade and Bryn Terfel, Audra McDonald and Peter Graves, Brian Stokes Mitchell, and David Archuleta, this most recent offering seemed not to be up to the usual high standard in production values.  Having said that, this show certainly runs rings around what the commercial TV networks call 'entertainment' in 2012.An enjoyable program, but disappointing at the same time.  As a TV prod/director I always look for the production and entertainment values in a show as well.  But I am sure many viewers will be delighted with this year's offering.",4,Not as Spectacular As in Past Years,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,2874,"['Personally', 'found', '2011', 'Christmas', 'Concert', '2012', 'DVD', 'release', 'Mormon', 'Tabernacle', 'Choir', 'guest', 'artists', 'lacked', 'lustre', 'WOW', 'factor', 'have', 'seen', 'concerts', 'choir', 'guest', 'artists', 'past', 'eight+', 'years.Yes', 'choir', 'fantastic', 'orchestra', 'were', 'up', 'usual', 'standard', 'fact', 'are', 'always', 'superb', 'show', 'whole', 'had', 'very', 'sombre', 'feel', 'Having', 'Medieval', 'theme', 'looked', 'had', 'been', 'budget', 'cuts', 'settings', 'one', 'being', 'most', 'minimal', 'years.I', 'was', 'waiting', 'WOW', 'factor', 'happen', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'up', 'usual', 'emotional', 'highs', 'past', 'shows', 'However', 'presentation', ""'Good"", 'King', 'Wenceslas', 'narrated', 'told', 'British', 'film', 'TV', 'actress', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'was', 'highlight', 'show', 'usual', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'contained', 'therein', 'magnificent', 'choir', 'orchestra', 'snowflake', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'acrobats', 'juggler', ""'snow"", 'floating', 'down', 'gantry', 'Most', 'impressive', 'Nathan', 'Gunn', 'great', 'voice', 'seemed', 'lack', 'charisma', 'stage', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'animated', 'interviews', ""'extras"", 'lighting', 'was', 'very', 'unimaginative', 'other', 'parts', 'program', 'so', 'were', 'shots', 'audience', 'could', 'hardly', 'see', 'one', 'venue', 'where', 'little', 'more', 'subtle', 'lighting', 'audience', 'must', 'full', 'dimension', 'venue', 'gigantic', 'size', 'impressive', 'seating', '21,000', 'people', 'aside', 'point', 'view', 'bothered', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'when', 'person', 'narrating', 'story', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'heaven', 'must', 'see', 'camera', 'shots', '4', 'different', 'angles', 'are', 'speaking', 'director', 'said', 'ok', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'got', '4', 'cameras', 'speaker', 'let', 'use', 'very', 'off-putting', 'absolutely', 'purpose', 'style', 'directing', 'now', 'crept', 'productions', 'value', 'Are', 'appealing', 'teenagers', 'who', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'mosquito', 'get', ""'bored"", 'shot', 'held', 'more', '5', 'seconds', 'few', 'years', 'was', ""'wobbly"", 'cam', 'thank', 'goodness', 'almost', 'disappeared', 'today', '.Compared', 'concerts', 'past', 'DVD', 'guest', 'artists', 'such', 'King', 'Singers', 'Natalie', 'Cole', 'Sissel', 'Frederica', 'von', 'Stade', 'Bryn', 'Terfel', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Brian', 'Stokes', 'Mitchell', 'David', 'Archuleta', 'most', 'recent', 'offering', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'usual', 'high', 'standard', 'production', 'values', 'Having', 'said', 'show', 'certainly', 'rings', 'what', 'commercial', 'TV', 'networks', 'call', ""'entertainment"", '2012.An', 'enjoyable', 'program', 'disappointing', 'same', 'time', 'TV', 'prod/director', 'always', 'look', 'production', 'entertainment', 'values', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'year', 'offering']",N/A

1582608,A19P38T4NI6WPY,B00911LAP8,William R. Moore,"[2, 4]","Let me first say that, over the years, these Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas concerts have been thrilling, entertaining, wonderful, spectacular and every other superlative one could think of.  Having said that, this year's release of ""Once Upon a Christmas"" fell slightly short of the superlatives noted for previous years.  First, I felt that there were a few too many classical pieces rather than having more traditional holiday fare.  Maybe this was because they are trying to avoid repetition, but I was glad to see the inclusion of one of my favorites, ""Twas The Night Before Christmas.""  I remember this selection from a Fred Waring Christmas album from the fifties and I never forgot their delightful arrangement.  The choir's presentation of this classic would have been much better with some live action depicting what was going on in the song, with Nathan Gunn perhaps dressed appropriately in ""period"" sleepware plus some of those cute kids pantomiming and reacting...along with an appearance by Santa himself and maybe even a flying sleigh with ""eight tiny reindeer.""  I'll bet that would have brought the house down.Jane Seymour was her usual warm and dramatic self and her performances could not be faulted, although I felt that her voice was perhaps EQ'd a little too much by the recording engineers, whom also could have tamed Gunns ""glass breaking"" baritone a little.  The pipe organ solo wasn't quite the technical ""tour de force"" as the previous year's performance, but I'm probably nit-picking too much.  The opening number, ""Deck The Halls"" did it for me on this concert.  It was absolutely astonishing!This disc is still very much worth adding to your DVD or Blu Ray collection, especially if you're a fan like I am.  And, I must say that if God himself were to have His own choir and orchestra, it would be The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and The Orchestra at Temple Square.",4,Missed the mark by a little,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,1895,"['Let', 'first', 'say', 'years', 'Mormon', 'Tabernacle', 'Choir', 'Christmas', 'concerts', 'have', 'been', 'thrilling', 'entertaining', 'wonderful', 'spectacular', 'other', 'superlative', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'Having', 'said', 'year', 'release', 'Once', 'Christmas', 'fell', 'slightly', 'short', 'superlatives', 'noted', 'previous', 'years', 'First', 'felt', 'were', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'classical', 'pieces', 'rather', 'having', 'more', 'traditional', 'holiday', 'fare', 'Maybe', 'was', 'are', 'trying', 'avoid', 'repetition', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'inclusion', 'one', 'favorites', 'Twas', 'Night', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'remember', 'selection', 'Fred', 'Waring', 'Christmas', 'album', 'fifties', 'never', 'forgot', 'delightful', 'arrangement', 'choir', 'presentation', 'classic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'live', 'action', 'depicting', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'song', 'Nathan', 'Gunn', 'perhaps', 'dressed', 'appropriately', 'period', 'sleepware', 'cute', 'kids', 'pantomiming', 'reacting', 'appearance', 'Santa', 'maybe', 'even', 'flying', 'sleigh', 'eight', 'tiny', 'reindeer', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'house', 'down.Jane', 'Seymour', 'was', 'usual', 'warm', 'dramatic', 'self', 'performances', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'felt', 'voice', 'was', 'perhaps', 'EQ', ""'d"", 'little', 'too', 'much', 'recording', 'engineers', 'whom', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'tamed', 'Gunns', 'glass', 'breaking', 'baritone', 'little', 'pipe', 'organ', 'solo', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'technical', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'previous', 'year', 'performance', ""'m"", 'probably', 'nit-picking', 'too', 'much', 'opening', 'number', 'Deck', 'Halls', 'did', 'concert', 'was', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'disc', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'adding', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'collection', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'am', 'must', 'say', 'God', 'were', 'have', 'own', 'choir', 'orchestra', 'would', 'be', 'Mormon', 'Tabernacle', 'Choir', 'Orchestra', 'Temple', 'Square']",N/A
