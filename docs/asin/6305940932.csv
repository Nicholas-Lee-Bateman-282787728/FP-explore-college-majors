Little Mermaid II is no exception.The magic and wonder of the first film is missing here, in the story of Ariel's daughter Melody.  Melody has an obsession with the sea, and, because of events that happen early on, is forbidden from ever seeing it.  A clever idea, but one which could have been executed.Ursula's revengeful sister Morgana is a weaker character than the original villian, and the addition of two new sidekicks didn't accomplish much more than to make sure that the classic characters didn't get to really participate in the story.The songs are second tier, but, especially to younger children, hummable.This film doesn't contain any real objectionable material, and is a fun distraction for fans of the original and those with younger viewers.  Please, don't watch this if you want to recapture the fun of the first film.  Buy the original instead!

But this movie had a number of things that others don't. First, as far as I can tell, most of the original cast is maintained. Second, the animation seemed to be of the same caliber as the original. Third, this is not a repeat of the prequel's plot formula.What I liked best about the movie is that Ariel in becoming a mom has forgotten about what being a budding teenager is all about, and loses touch with her daughter's feelings at a critical time. Isn't that what growing up and becoming a parent does to many of us? I loved the fact that this movie sparked my daughter asking me the &quot;why&quot; questions - like why Ariel didn't tell her daughter the whole truth about why she was forbidden from the sea. Ariel has become a different person from the adventurous mermaid-girl we saw in Little Mermaid - and quite naturally. I was happy to see my daughter getting this message.I don't think that this is a re-hashing of the same youth - defiance plot of the first movie. Here is it much more relational, about a mother and daughter. The Neptune-Ariel relationship never seemed to be very real to me - unlike the Ariel-Melody relationship in this one.Another important contrast between this movie and the original is the fact that Ariel left her home for a man, while Melody left home to find herself and her destiny... and only when her mother did not take the opportunity presented to 'connect' with her daughter. I think this message is a much more real and positive one.I bought the movie for my daughter, and she watched it twice in a row the first day, and several times thereafter, and together, too - which is really what is important to me. I think we both thought that this movie was perhaps, even better than the original.",5,More positive and real message than the original,970444800,"10 2, 2000",2000,1840,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'generally', 'avoid', 'quot', 'direct-to-video', 'quot', 'sequels', 'general', 'movie', 'had', 'number', 'things', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'First', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'most', 'original', 'cast', 'maintained', 'Second', 'animation', 'seemed', 'be', 'same', 'caliber', 'original', 'Third', 'not', 'repeat', 'prequel', 'plot', 'liked', 'best', 'movie', 'Ariel', 'becoming', 'mom', 'forgotten', 'what', 'being', 'budding', 'teenager', 'touch', 'daughter', 'feelings', 'critical', 'time', ""n't"", 'what', 'growing', 'up', 'becoming', 'parent', 'many', 'loved', 'fact', 'movie', 'sparked', 'daughter', 'asking', 'quot', 'why', 'quot', 'questions', 'why', 'Ariel', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'daughter', 'whole', 'truth', 'why', 'was', 'forbidden', 'sea', 'Ariel', 'become', 'different', 'person', 'adventurous', 'mermaid-girl', 'saw', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'quite', 'naturally', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'daughter', 'getting', 'message.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 're-hashing', 'same', 'youth', 'defiance', 'plot', 'first', 'movie', 'Here', 'much', 'more', 'relational', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Neptune-Ariel', 'relationship', 'never', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'real', 'Ariel-Melody', 'relationship', 'one.Another', 'important', 'contrast', 'movie', 'original', 'fact', 'Ariel', 'left', 'home', 'man', 'Melody', 'left', 'home', 'find', 'destiny', 'only', 'when', 'mother', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'opportunity', 'presented', ""'connect"", 'daughter', 'think', 'message', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'positive', 'one.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'daughter', 'watched', 'twice', 'row', 'first', 'day', 'several', 'times', 'thereafter', 'together', 'too', 'really', 'what', 'important', 'think', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'original']",The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea VHS

483305,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,6305940932,Amber,"[8, 10]","I for one loved this movie and didn't compare it to the original. I loved the Lion King 2 (Simba's Pride) and didn't compare that one to the first one. I adore the Rescuers Down Under, but its not the same as the first one. And the sequel to Lady and the Tramp? I liked that one too. Yes, there are going to be changes when one waits years to make a sequel. I love the sequels for being movies in their own right. By the way, I am almost 22 years old and remember the first Little Mermaid very well. I've grown up on Disney, and out of the forty dvds I own, 80% of them are Disney.Anyway, the Little Mermaid 2 is a great movie. The animation is even clearer and more beautiful than the first one, due to the changes in technology over the last decade, and the songs are just as catchy and fun. In fact, I watched it a few days ago and still have ""Tip and Dash"" stuck in my head. In my opinion, Disney did a great job with the story itself, making it believable and moving. The actors and actresses all give their best and it shows in the emotion the characters display. Melody is exactly what you would expect a lonely preteen princess to be--tortured by her secret desires and her need to fit in, yet her seeming inability to do so. And like all kids that age, she is convinced that she is the only one who could possibly feel this way and brushes off her mother's attempts to cheer her up with edited stories of her own childhood. She creates a situation and has to deal with the repercussions, and does so very well.Jodi Benson proves once again that she is the only woman who could play the part of Ariel. Reprising her role from so many years ago, she now plays the part of the older, wiser, more mature mermaid-turned human, and does it perfectly. In addition to dealing with Melody's preteen anxieties, Ariel has to contend with her own feelings of loneliness and helplessness, as her years as a human and the wall that separates the castle from the sea also separates her from her family. There is a very poignant scene in which Ariel wades in the water behind the wall, just to feel the water again and to remember her life before. It moves me every time.Eric gets a lot of screen time in this one, but he doesn't speak as much and really just stands off to the side, silently offering encouragement. He doesn't act as a prince, but a father concerned with the well-being of his only daughter and a husband worried about his wife's happiness. I don't think his voice actor is the same as in the first one. Triton's either.I've rambled on long enough. I just want everyone to watch this movie and decide for yourselves if you like it or not. But please, don't compare it to the original. Just as younger siblings hate being compared to their older brothers and sisters, and children dislike being forced to follow in the path of their parents, so too are sequels not meant to be the exact replicas of the original films.

Did you expect them to be the same flippant teenagers they were in the first movie?  Now THAT would be disconcerting.**Mild Spoilers Ahead**I think the parallels to the first film with Ariel acting to Melody as her father acted toward her when SHE was a teen are humorous and well-placed in the film.  It doesn't make Ariel BORING, it makes her real...how many kids grow up saying they'll never be like their parents and then, as disturbing as it is, find themselves growing more and more like them every year?As for the plot, I don't think it's anywhere near a ""copy"" of the original...think about it.  In the original, Ariel dreams of going up on land to explore, live life, meet real people with two legs, learn about all the things she's found on sunken ships, etc. and she does with Ursula's help.  In LM2, Melody thinks she's a screw-up, a nobody, and she's upset with her parents for NOT letting her go into the sea because she doesn't know about the incident that happened when she was a baby at the beginning of the film when Morgana tries to kill her and Triton gives her that locket.  It's more of a mystery to her...when she finds the locket, she needs to know what it means.  She does that on her own...she has no intentions of becoming a mermaid until Morgana puts it in her head so the sea witch can get King Triton's trident.  Two totally different stories.Anyway, enough rambling.  The movie is great.  If you are a fan of LM1, Disney, or just good animated films, check out Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea.

The story revolves around Melody, the daughter of Ariel (the original film's ""little mermaid""). Melody love the sea, but is not permitted by her parents to ever visit the sea after she was almost kidnapped by the Sea Witch Ursula's evil sister Morgana, seeking revenge the demise of her sister. If the plot of the young daughter who was forbidden to be part of the world she love sounds familiar, it should. It's the same plot of the first film turned upside-down. In addition to a weak plot, the songs are forgettable (and, at times, painful) and the characters are uninteresting, including not only the film's returning characters who are now meer shadows of their former selfs, but also the new additions such as Morgana's shark-turned-guppy henchman and Timon and Pumbaa clones Tip and Dash.

483320,A8S11VP9Z36D6,6305940932,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[7, 8]","This direct-to-video movie was released in 2000, 11 years after the original ""Little Mermaid"" was embraced by millions of Disney fans in 1989. This sequel is being released in a 1-disc special edition. As others have noted, it is a very similar rehashing of the original tale.Ariel & Eric are married and have a beautiful dark-haired daughter, Melody. When Ursula's evil sister, Morgana, appears on the scene, King Triton & Ariel must protect Melody by building a large wall around the castle. Forbidding Melody to enter the ocean (thus keeping her away from both Morgana and her grandfather King Triton), Ariel keeps her heritage a secret. Many years later, as a teen, Melody experiences the angst of not fitting in, and wishing she were a mermaid. Morgana seizes the opportunity to exploit Melody's sadness and convinces her to steal her Grandfather's triton stick, which would give Morgana the power over the entire sea. Can you predict the rest? Sure, it's not too difficult. Again, this is an enjoyable film. The animation is not as good as the theatrical original,The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition), nor as good as the recently releasedThe Little Mermaid - Ariel's Beginning. Still, it is far above what you would typically expect of a direct-to-dvd release. Jodi Benson & Pat Carroll are back on hand to lend their vocal talents to Ariel & Morgana respectively; who else but Carroll could vocalize Ursula's sister? Sebastian and Flounder are also back for comic relief, and there are some new characters as well. Safe for children to watch, although some of the scenes with Morgana may be slightly frightening for the very young ones. Needless to say, these don't last too long!Technical Specs:Dolby Digital 5.1 surround for audio (movie) & 1:66:1 video enhanced for 16x9 TVs.Extras:* Deleted Song: ""Gonna Get My Wish."" Fun musical showcase for Morgana, explaining her quest not to be the forgotten child overshadowed by her late sister Ursula. Really not a bad number; most likely trimmed for time.* 1938 Silly Symphony Short ""Merbabies"" (8:34). Fun musical romp under the sea that was obviously a precursor to ""Fantasia."" Ironically, this Disney short was actually farmed out to another studio. Not quite up to the quality of other Silly Symphonies.* ""Little Mermaid II"" DVD Storybook: have the story read to you, or read it yourself. Narrated by Jodi Benson (voice of Ariel).Games & Activities:* ""The Little Mermaid II"" Underwater Mer-Venture Challenge Game* ""Little Mermaid II"" Trivia Game* ""What Am I?"" Sea Creature Game, where the answers provide brief film clips of actual sea creatures. Fun learning adventure for little ones.None of these 3 games are really out of the ordinary, but might prove slightly amusing for the little ones.* Sneak Peaks include upcoming 2009's ""The Princess and the Frog."" The trailer here does seem very fun and sassy; I have been anxiously awaiting this one ever since it was first announced.

483331,A7Y6AVS576M03,6305940932,gobirds2,"[0, 1]","""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" met my expectations for a direct-to-video film. It did not exceed them nor did they fall short. The 1989 original THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable film, making the artistic success for a sequel a great challenge. To its credit ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" did unfold in a different direction than I had anticipated. The story was not innovative but some of the particular plot situations were well thought out. In any story you have conflict and resolution and those are the aspects that I liked about this film. Some of the dramatics did rely on prior events, which took place in the original. That was thematically important to the overall story. One weakness of this film was the lack of character development. Character development was one of the strong points of THE LITTLE MERMAID. I watched ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" twice trying to determine if the film digressed in such a way to bolster my contention of this. What did the ""The Little Mermaid"" achieve in roughly the same amount of time that this film didn't? And then it struck me that it was the music or more specifically the songs in the original that advanced the story line and defined the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman. He and composer Alan Menken developed songs in the original that in several minutes clearly defined Ariel's reckless but innocent curiosity about the humans above and her yearning to discover that world. Every song in the original bolstered the characters, advanced the plot or enhanced the significance of a scene in addition to being very melodic and well written. So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we were given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in that film. ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" does not have the advantage of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman compositions. The instrumental score is very good but the new songs feel superficial. The animation especially during the underwater scenes is good. Morgana is not as menacing as her sister Ursula was in the original. Other than Ursula I believe all the main characters are back. Melody, Ariel's daughter gets to mingle with the old characters as well as meet new ones. I thought that was significant seeing that the scriptwriters were determined not to have Melody just copy what Ariel did in the original. It would have been a very good sequel for theatrical release. If that was done, there would have been a bigger budget and the various shortcomings could have been corrected. I liked ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" but I did not feel it was as good as Disney's other direct-to-video, ""Pocahontas II."" However, I believe that ""The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"" will have a definite audience with younger family members and there are actually some nostalgic moments that will no doubt attract teens and up who loved the original.

Without dropping a spoiler, there is even a plot development quite similar to the current Broadway version that does not happen in the original film.The wonderful Pat Carroll returns --  instead of playing Ursula, she offers a different characterization as evil sister Morgana -- along with Jodi Benson, Buddy Hackett, Kenneth Mars, Rene Auberjonois and Sam Wright. Replacing Ben Wright (who passed away in 1989), Jason Marin and Christopher Daniel Barnes are Kay Kuter, Cam Clarke and Rob Paulsen as Prince Eric,  and Flounder, respectively.Most of all, it should be pointed out to Disney records fans that several very good friends of ""Mouse Tracks"" were involved with this film: Executive Music Producer Bambi Mo&eacute;, singer Desire&eacute; Goyette and songwriters Michael and Patty Silversher (who wrote all the original songs from the film, ""Down to the Sea,"" For a Moment"" and ""Here on the Land and Sea.""

The first movie was fun, the camera was always moving, and you identified with the characters. This just seemed so stale. The features definately point to a child audience that would appreciate the film more. I have liked all the direct-to-video features, particularly Simba's pride, but this just felt like a saturday morning cartoon. It seems that maybe there was a song somewhere but it must not have been very memorable if there was. I liked the new B characters and they probably would have made a more interesting movie than the principles. The sea witch was just rediculous though.

483346,AJHC8SJDXDSXV,6305940932,Jennifer Pillow Taylor,"[4, 8]","If you don't know the plot to this, but do know the plot to the original, you know the plot to this.  Melody is just a brattier clone of Ariel.  She runs off and defies her parent's wishes and asks a sea with who's half mis-colored human and half octopus and has pet eels to change her into a mermaid.  In exchange, the sea-witch with hair that's white and goes straight up pretty much just uses the kid to get Triton's trident.Yes, it is the EXACT same thing with the love story cut out, a horrible personality replacing the loveable one, and circumstances have changed so she is never doing the right thing.While Ariel defied her father because she had wanted to be human for so long and her father had anger issues, Melody wants to be a mermaid about 2 minutes after learning about them and won't let her mother talk.  While Ariel had the ultimatum of having to get Eric to fall in love with her while sacrificing her voice, Melody is asked to go steal straight off the bat and pretty much sacrifice nothing.  While Ariel feels sorry for hurting her father after turning human, Melody throws a huge tantrum at her mother who says she's been worried sick looking for her.  While Ariel knows its wrong to steal and told her father not to exchange places with her in Ursula's contract, Melody finds out that Triton is a nice guy, but steals the trident anyway.  While Ariel tries to fight Ursula even when Ursula has the trident, Melody's survival instincts are purely comprised of falling over and sitting where she is no matter what the villains do.Does she learn her lesson in the end?  ...I honestly don't know.Melody seems to exude other flaws as well.  Her voice acting is pretty bad, though everyone else's is okay.  Since most of the animation is of her, she seems pretty bad, being choppy sometimes, and just badly animated at others.  She overshadows many characters.  Eric seems oblivious to his daughter personality flaws and Ariel seems really withdrawn, most likely to not having been in the ocean for over ten years (this could have been expanded on as it was an interesting concept, but it had to make way for Melody's superfluous scenes, which is yet another flaw),  and Melody is an idiot.  You'd think Ariel and Eric's kid wouldn't be that dumb.Lastly, the ending is Melody declining an offer from her grandfather to be a mermaid again (the mer-maid spell wore off), but instead she wants the wall between the castle and the sea that was built to keep her out of the sea and thus away from the sea-witch (it never worked) destroyed.  She couldn't have asked daddy, who had it built?  How long is this non-mermaid thing going to last, given that she'd steal for it?  Her grandfather and bother her parents are doting, implying she'll be spoiled no matter where she is.  How's the audience going to trust her?  Are they supposed to or are they supposed to embrace her bratty personality?As a side note, where did Ariel's sister's go?  Triton was the only person at the palace and if Ariel and Triton were looking for Melody in the ocean, wouldn't her sisters want to help?",2,A much more immature version Whoop-di-doo,1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,3089,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'plot', 'do', 'know', 'plot', 'original', 'know', 'plot', 'Melody', 'just', 'brattier', 'clone', 'Ariel', 'parent', 'wishes', 'sea', 'who', 'mis-colored', 'human', 'half', 'octopus', 'pet', 'eels', 'change', 'mermaid', 'exchange', 'sea-witch', 'hair', 'white', 'straight', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'kid', 'get', 'Triton', 'trident.Yes', 'EXACT', 'same', 'thing', 'love', 'story', 'cut', 'out', 'horrible', 'personality', 'replacing', 'loveable', 'one', 'circumstances', 'have', 'changed', 'never', 'doing', 'right', 'thing.While', 'Ariel', 'defied', 'father', 'had', 'wanted', 'be', 'human', 'so', 'long', 'father', 'had', 'anger', 'issues', 'Melody', 'be', 'mermaid', '2', 'minutes', 'learning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'mother', 'talk', 'Ariel', 'had', 'ultimatum', 'having', 'get', 'Eric', 'fall', 'love', 'sacrificing', 'voice', 'Melody', 'asked', 'go', 'steal', 'straight', 'bat', 'pretty', 'much', 'sacrifice', 'nothing', 'Ariel', 'feels', 'sorry', 'hurting', 'father', 'turning', 'human', 'Melody', 'huge', 'tantrum', 'mother', 'who', 'been', 'worried', 'sick', 'looking', 'Ariel', 'wrong', 'steal', 'told', 'father', 'not', 'exchange', 'places', 'Ursula', 'contract', 'Melody', 'out', 'Triton', 'nice', 'guy', 'trident', 'anyway', 'Ariel', 'tries', 'fight', 'Ursula', 'even', 'when', 'Ursula', 'trident', 'Melody', 'survival', 'instincts', 'are', 'purely', 'comprised', 'falling', 'sitting', 'where', 'matter', 'what', 'villains', 'learn', 'lesson', 'end', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Melody', 'exude', 'other', 'flaws', 'well', 'voice', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'everyone', 'else', 'okay', 'most', 'animation', 'pretty', 'bad', 'being', 'choppy', 'sometimes', 'just', 'badly', 'animated', 'others', 'many', 'characters', 'Eric', 'oblivious', 'daughter', 'personality', 'flaws', 'Ariel', 'really', 'withdrawn', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'ocean', 'ten', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'was', 'interesting', 'concept', 'had', 'make', 'way', 'Melody', 'superfluous', 'scenes', 'yet', 'flaw', 'Melody', 'idiot', ""'d"", 'think', 'Ariel', 'Eric', 'kid', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'dumb.Lastly', 'ending', 'Melody', 'declining', 'offer', 'grandfather', 'be', 'mermaid', 'again', 'mer-maid', 'spell', 'wore', 'off', 'instead', 'wall', 'castle', 'sea', 'was', 'built', 'keep', 'sea', 'thus', 'away', 'sea-witch', 'never', 'worked', 'destroyed', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'asked', 'daddy', 'who', 'had', 'built', 'How', 'long', 'non-mermaid', 'thing', 'going', 'last', 'given', ""'d"", 'steal', 'grandfather', 'bother', 'parents', 'are', 'doting', 'implying', ""'ll"", 'be', 'spoiled', 'matter', 'where', 'How', 'audience', 'going', 'trust', 'Are', 'supposed', 'are', 'supposed', 'embrace', 'bratty', 'personality', 'side', 'note', 'where', 'did', 'Ariel', 'sister', 'go', 'Triton', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'palace', 'Ariel', 'Triton', 'were', 'looking', 'Melody', 'ocean', 'would', ""n't"", 'sisters', 'want', 'help']",The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea VHS

This is no different, the storyline is similar with all the characters resembling each other as well.  Basically, Melody is Ariel, only in a much younger perspective wanting to be a mermaid (just like Ariel wanted to be a human in the first), Morgana is Ursula, only skinnier with her pet shark who is the eels.  Tip and Dash are basically Flounder and Sebastian.  I enjoyed Tip and Dash a lot, especially compared to the annoying Flounder.  All the original characters make appearances, Sebastian is the crap that used to look after Ariel for King Tritan but now he's supposed to look over Melody for Ariel and Eric.  Flounder is still around, yet fatter and his voice is more annoying, King Triton is now the worried grandfather instead of just the worried father.  The real downfall here is Prince Eric, who is rarely in the movie but his voice is different and for the worst.  He looks a bit different too, he has like blue eyes in this one which makes him look strange.The storyline as I said is similar.  Melody wants to explore the sea, she's an OUTCAST on land and SNEAKS out by going under the wall between the castle and the ocean.  She meets Morgana, an EVIL OCTOPUS who has the POWER to TRANSFORM her into a mermaid (hint: with help from Ursula) and she can REMAIN a MERMAID if she STEALS the &quot;pitchfork&quot; (sorry I forget its name) from her grandfather, yet she doesn't know he's her grandfather.  Melody captures it with the help of Tip and Dash and returns to Morgana.  All the while Ariel has transformed back into a mermaid in hope to find Melody in the sea while Eric looks on land.  Morgana TURNS on Melody and transforms her back into a human and keeps her underwater until she drowns.  The shark crashes into the ice barrier and Melody is free, Ariel and Melody chat then realize that Eric and the rest of them are in trouble.  Melody saves the day.  That is basically the whole storyline.Though very similar to the first one, this is still a good watch and would be a nice movie to show your little kids, especially since they probably wouldn't care if the first one is the original.  It's a fun movie, not as romantic or as funny as the first but still fun.  If you collect Disney movies or really enjoyed this one if you saw it, buy it.

You know those sequels that are thrown together and so bad that they leave an awful taste in your mouth, even regarding the original?  It is not one of those either.  What this movie is is lovingly crafted, well-thought out, and a nice effort.The story takes place twelve years after the Little Mermaid became a human, vanquished Ursula the Sea Witch, and married the man of her dreams.  Eric and Ariel have a willful pre-teen named Melody.  Melody is drawn to the sea, and can talk to sea creatures.  She is awkward around other children, who snigger at Melody at her birthday party.  However, Melody cannot confide in her mother - because Melody does not know her mermaid heritage.  Ursula's sister Morgana (a green, slimmer version of the original) wants to change all that.  Morgana wants to use Melody to get King Triton's trident.The animation is decent, but does not have the depth and clarity of the 1992 film.  Yet it is enjoyable.  The songs are clever, but not showstopping as the originals.  But they are very good.  One thing that is better than the original is the humor.  Sebastian is even funnier than before.

483365,A8SGLDOPCFPM3,6305940932,LostBoy76,"[1, 4]","O Disney, what's happened to you? You used to produce enchanting, heart-warming animated films that were loved by both children AND adults. They had beautiful musical scores, wonderful songs, great characters, and the best animation quality and style in the world. And then something strange happened. You started to make less impressive animated films that still had brilliant animation, but lacked both interesting characters and good music, and possessed storylines of a more politically correct nature. I'm talking about films like Mulan, Lilo and Stitch, and Brother Bear. None of these films are bad by any means, but this is not the same ""Disney Magic"" I saw in movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Disney's last few animated movies seem more like big apologies for putting so many white people in their fairy tales, rather than good stories that deserve to be told.Then there's stuff like Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea, which is a cash grab by Disney and nothing more (just like the sequels to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc). There is absolutely no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make parents part with some of their hard-earned money because their kids succumbed to the advertising. The animation is straight-to-video quality, the songs are uninspired, and the story is almost a complete copy of the original! Please, please, DON'T buy this movie! Turning out sequel after sequel to a beloved movie to make some easy money is a terrible way for a studio to operate, and the fact that the studio is Disney in this case just goes to prove that somebody in a high-level position at Disney has no idea what made their company so loved and admired in the first place!A few months ago Disney announced that they were closing their feature-length animation studios. This is truly sad. If Disney had ignored the shrill naysayers of the world and kept on making high-quality animated films that people actually wanted to see and could care about, instead of pouring money into lame, preachy movies like Brother Bear, this wouldn't have happened.

The huge success of this film and the following Disney films caused the movie-makers at Disney to develop a system, a formula for good movies and pleasing family entertainment. All of the ingredients are there: A heroine, Melody (much in the form of the ever-popular Ariel,) A villian, Morgana (who takes after Ursula in almost every way) some conflict (over-bearing parents in the forms of lifeless Eric and equally one-sided Ariel) and a fairy tale ending (this one ends on a happier note than the first.) Add a splash of humor: two would-be heros, Tip and Dash (--- can you say Timon and Pumba from &quot;The Lion King&quot;? One's fat and kind, the other is cynical and small...) a wise-cracking evil henchmen, Undertoe (the shark who even resembles annoying Iago from &quot;Aladdin&quot;) and of course the toiling (often tiny) chaperone, Sebastian (tries too hard and seems to be more of a parody of himself than a meaningful character.) Has the formula ever failed? It dosen't in &quot;The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea.&quot; The movie is pleasant and visually pleasing with forgettable but fun songs and characters.

It was initially enjoyable, but definitely lackluster.Ursula is dead, but apparently she has a sister which looks like her except she's skinny where Ursula was fat. Apparently the sisters had some rivalry years ago and their mother was proud of Ursula, but this relationship is never explored in flashbacks or monologues or anything, so Morgana comes across as a very flat character with no real motivation other than trying to prove herself better than Ursula.Morgana threatens Ariel and Eric and their baby, so Eric is forced to build a wall that separates the Palace from the sea (Really? A wall against a witch?) but like her mother, Melody sneaks out when she is not supposed to and likes swimming. She gets an opportunity from Morgana to become a mermaid after she learns of her mother's secret past.This is a very lackluster sequel. All of the characters come across as rather flat, especially Melody, Morgana, and Ariel herself. Ariel doesn't seem to have grown much, and she even looks the same as before except her hair is usually pulled back in a bun.

This was the direct to video sequel to The Little Mermaid. The movie opens with the celebration of the birth of Ariel and Prince Eric newborn daughter Melody. The celebration is interupted when Morgana, Ursula's sister, appears and tries to kidnap Melody, but is foil and retreats to the Antarctic region along with her sidekicks Cloak, Dagger, and Undertow. It is twelve years later and Melody's 12th birthday party. She has gone beyond the forbidding wall which was erected to protect her from Morgana. Melody finds the locket that her grandfather, King Triton, gave her when she was born. Melody confronts her mother and the two having a falling out. Melody heads out to sea on a row boat to find the answers she is looking for. Melody meets Undertow and he convinces her that Morgana has the answers she is looking for you. Cloak and Dagger tow her to Morgana's hideout and she turns Melody into a mermaid, but there is a catch, she tells her that she must retrieve the trident if she wants to remind a mermaid forever. Melody along with two new friends, Tip and Dash, go to Atlantica get the trident and return to Antarctic region. Ariel meets up with Melody and tries to explain to her the reason she was not aloud to go to the sea, but it is too late; Melody gives the trident to Morgana. With the trident in Morgana's hands she begins her brief takeover of the seas. In the end Melody retrieves the trident and King Triton encases Morgana in a block of ice and is last seen falling to the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean. As for as direct to videos goes, this is one of the better videos. Though it does not live up to its full potential. It does not have any great songs like Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl like the original Little Mermaid did and parts of the movie looks like cut and paste from the original as well.

483373,A3L46ZRKNFN0SG,6305940932,Michael W. Howe,"[7, 8]","Originally, I have been against Direct-to-video(or dtv for short).  I watched the first &quot;Aladdin sequels,&quot; and those didn't quite gel for me.  Since then, I have turned away from them, but curiousity got the better of me and I rented Little Mermaid 2 (this would probably seem ordinary, but the fact is that I am a 20 year old guy who is working on an animation career).  I saw the first one when I was 9, and this one looks like it will carry a good load of fans.  In our story, the arrival of Ursula the sea witch's sister Morgana prompts Ariel and Eric to sever ties with King Triton and the sea to protect their daughter Melody.  But after entering her early teens, Melody begins to take on her mother's rebellious nature and venture out into the sea.  Melody is probably the most welcome new DTV character, inheriting her father's jet-black hair and her mother's expressive eyes.  She is also voiced by the incredible Tara Charendoff (who also voices Bubbles on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls,&quot; but don't worry, Melody doesn't sound quite as peppy), a 27 year old voice actress who convincingly makes us believe in Melody's adventures.  After finding a locket meant for her, Melody runs away, and Morgana (voicd by Ursula's villainous voice Pat Carroll) decides that Melody will be the &quot;perfect tool for Triton's undoing.&quot;  Probably most of the original's fans will find a big change in Ariel.  While Ariel was a somewhat rebellious 16 year old in the first one, here she's become a more responsible 28 year old mother (though she doesn't really look 28!).  Jodi Benson returns to voice her.  On the downside, the sidekicks who once made the original magical have grown up and lost their charm.  Scuttle (Buddy Hackett) feels like he was written in as an afterthought, and Flounder has an even smaller part where he tries to help as well.  Only Samuel E Wright as Sebastian is given a part that best befits his voice-acting. Two new sidekicks are Tip and Dash, a penguin and walrus duo who befriend Melody, but end up being carbon copies of most comic duos (ie Timon and Pumbaa).  Morgana's lackeys are even less pronounced, except for Undertow, a shark that got turned into a pipsqueak by Triton.  He provides a few funny moments.  The animation is choppy in some places, but does try to keep pace, looking much better than the &quot;Aladdin&quot; TV-style animation.  The soundtrack has a couple notable song tracks,(one a duet between Ariel and Melody) but in the end the background music is used.",4,"Not the greatest film, but a welcome relief from most dtvs.",969753600,"09 24, 2000",2000,2525,"['Originally', 'have', 'been', 'Direct-to-video', 'dtv', 'short', 'watched', 'first', 'quot', 'Aladdin', 'sequels', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'then', 'have', 'turned', 'away', 'curiousity', 'got', 'better', 'rented', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '2', 'would', 'probably', 'seem', 'ordinary', 'fact', 'am', '20', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'working', 'animation', 'career', 'saw', 'first', 'one', 'when', 'was', '9', 'one', 'will', 'carry', 'good', 'load', 'fans', 'story', 'arrival', 'Ursula', 'sea', 'witch', 'sister', 'Morgana', 'Ariel', 'Eric', 'sever', 'ties', 'King', 'Triton', 'sea', 'protect', 'daughter', 'Melody', 'entering', 'early', 'teens', 'Melody', 'take', 'mother', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'venture', 'out', 'sea', 'Melody', 'probably', 'most', 'welcome', 'new', 'DTV', 'character', 'inheriting', 'father', 'jet-black', 'hair', 'mother', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'also', 'voiced', 'incredible', 'Tara', 'Charendoff', 'who', 'also', 'Bubbles', 'quot', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Melody', ""n't"", 'sound', 'quite', 'peppy', '27', 'year', 'old', 'voice', 'actress', 'who', 'convincingly', 'believe', 'Melody', 'adventures', 'finding', 'locket', 'meant', 'Melody', 'away', 'Morgana', 'voicd', 'Ursula', 'villainous', 'voice', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'Melody', 'will', 'be', 'quot', 'perfect', 'tool', 'Triton', 'undoing.', 'quot', 'Probably', 'most', 'original', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'big', 'change', 'Ariel', 'Ariel', 'was', 'somewhat', 'rebellious', '16', 'year', 'old', 'first', 'one', 'here', 'become', 'more', 'responsible', '28', 'year', 'old', 'mother', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', '28', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'voice', 'downside', 'sidekicks', 'who', 'once', 'made', 'original', 'magical', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'lost', 'charm', 'Scuttle', 'Buddy', 'Hackett', 'feels', 'was', 'written', 'afterthought', 'Flounder', 'even', 'smaller', 'part', 'where', 'help', 'as', 'well', 'Only', 'Samuel', 'E', 'Wright', 'Sebastian', 'given', 'part', 'best', 'voice-acting', 'Two', 'new', 'sidekicks', 'are', 'Tip', 'Dash', 'penguin', 'walrus', 'duo', 'who', 'befriend', 'Melody', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'carbon', 'copies', 'most', 'comic', 'duos', 'ie', 'Timon', 'Pumbaa', 'Morgana', 'lackeys', 'are', 'even', 'less', 'pronounced', 'Undertow', 'shark', 'got', 'turned', 'pipsqueak', 'Triton', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'animation', 'choppy', 'places', 'try', 'keep', 'pace', 'looking', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Aladdin', 'quot', 'TV-style', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'couple', 'notable', 'song', 'tracks', 'one', 'duet', 'Ariel', 'Melody', 'end', 'background', 'music', 'used']",The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea VHS
483374,AURZ4YQ270W3T,6305940932,Mike Freed,"[13, 15]","Even though this sequel to the 1989 Disney classic &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; has many of the same voices as the original (such as Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel Wright as Sebastian), it's missing a little something.Namely, it's missing great animation, a plot that makes sense to adults, and, of course, the classic Menken/Ashman score and songs that made the original such a smash.The biggest weakness, frankly, is the songs, which display all the creativity and spirit as your average Barbie commercial; come to think of it, maybe that was the goal. The animation also lacks spirit and could easily be from any Saturday morning cartoon; sorry, Disney, that's not why we pay good money to see your product.It's kind of unfortunate that Disney insists on cheapening its brilliant animated originals (especially this one and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;) with lame straight-to-video sequels.I'm sure the economics of a straight-to-video sequel are compelling, but take the case of the only sequel they didn't handle this way - &quot;Toy Story 2.&quot;Originally, the sequel to &quot;Toy Story&quot; was to be a straight-to-video job as well, but it was decided that it should be produced for theatrical release instead. The result? The film was a massive commercial and critical success, and was better than the original (no small compliment) in many ways.Maybe the &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; experience will convince Disney to stop the straight-to-video dreck specials like &quot;Little Mermaid 2,&quot; but I doubt it.I guess the good news is that this film is harmless fluff for the kiddies to watch, but I found it telling that after she watched this film, my four-year-old daughter said the original &quot;Mermaid&quot; was far better.Well said.",2,"Kids will love it, but the original was FAR better",973555200,"11 7, 2000",2000,1756,"['Even', 'sequel', '1989', 'Disney', 'classic', 'quot', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'quot', 'many', 'same', 'voices', 'original', 'such', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'Ariel', 'Samuel', 'Wright', 'Sebastian', 'missing', 'little', 'something.Namely', 'missing', 'great', 'animation', 'plot', 'sense', 'adults', 'course', 'classic', 'Menken/Ashman', 'score', 'songs', 'made', 'original', 'such', 'smash.The', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'frankly', 'songs', 'display', 'creativity', 'spirit', 'average', 'Barbie', 'commercial', 'come', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', 'goal', 'animation', 'also', 'spirit', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'sorry', 'Disney', 'not', 'why', 'pay', 'good', 'money', 'see', 'product.It', 'kind', 'unfortunate', 'Disney', 'cheapening', 'brilliant', 'animated', 'originals', 'especially', 'one', 'quot', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'quot', 'lame', 'straight-to-video', 'sequels.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'economics', 'straight-to-video', 'sequel', 'are', 'compelling', 'take', 'case', 'only', 'sequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'handle', 'way', 'quot', 'Toy', 'Story', '2.', 'quot', 'Originally', 'sequel', 'quot', 'Toy', 'Story', 'quot', 'was', 'be', 'straight-to-video', 'job', 'well', 'was', 'decided', 'should', 'be', 'produced', 'theatrical', 'release', 'instead', 'result', 'film', 'was', 'massive', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'small', 'compliment', 'many', 'ways.Maybe', 'quot', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'quot', 'experience', 'will', 'convince', 'Disney', 'stop', 'straight-to-video', 'dreck', 'specials', 'quot', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '2', 'quot', 'doubt', 'it.I', 'guess', 'good', 'news', 'film', 'harmless', 'fluff', 'kiddies', 'watch', 'found', 'telling', 'watched', 'film', 'four-year-old', 'daughter', 'said', 'original', 'quot', 'Mermaid', 'quot', 'was', 'far', 'better.Well', 'said']",The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea VHS

Joseph, Mary, and the baby Jesus, this movie was far below my wildest expectations. Poor quality songs, 100% predictable and boring plot, excruciating to watch. When Melody, Ariel's daughter, goes swimming she is a full human, no mermaid traits about her, and she can hold her breath for upwards of 3 minutes, keeping her eyes wide open in the saltwater the entire time. She swims past a random fish and it says, &quot;Hi, Melody!&quot;, and she smiles at it. UNDERWATER! This is just one of the movies 78,000 major flaws. Disney cares only about money.

Eric (who oddly remains a Prince while Ariel becomes a Queen) is good for window dressing, but does not appear to have any real function or talent beyond looking good and being nice.In addition to the return of Flounder and Scuttle, we meet new friends who guide Melody on her quest of self discovery and dream fufilment. Although her mother tries to protect her from the sea, the same thing that once guided Ariel to the land tells Melody she has a special destinty all her own.Sure, the other land kids in the film laugh at her, but she is ultimately whole when she discovers the real truth between the weird dreams that she had been having all of those years.THe only real disappointment is Morgana.

Times have changed and I'm 17 now, but I still like it. Last night, I babysat for a 3 year old who wanted to watch this sequel. It wasn't that horrible, but it was nowhere near the excellence of the original.  First of all, I hated what they did to the original characters. Ariel has more or less turned into her father.(What is it with Disney sequels? They did this to Simba in the Lion King sequel too.) Flounder has turned into an older fish with many children, and Sebastian into an old crab that complains a lot. Personally, I found this rather disturbing in comparison with the characters' spunky personalities of the original. Secondly, the movie lacked one really great song. They tried though. There were songs every few minutes, but none of them were on the level of &quot;Under the Sea&quot; or &quot;Part of Your World&quot;. Third, the villain was Ursula's sister. And, the two of them might as well have been twins because she was exactly like her sister, except less frightening.  Ursula gave me nightmares when I was little. The scene at the end of the original where she becomes really big scared me to death. The end of this movie did not even remotely frighten the three year old I watched it with. She found it really funny. (Actually, that could be a good thing depending on your opinion.)  Ok, now that I've complained about my main problems with it, I'll talk about the good points. Melody, Ariel's daughter, was the best part of the movie. She was a younger version of Ariel in the first movie. (I could write a ton of similarities between them) She was in many ways a typical 12 year old, which I found appealing. I also liked the scenes dealing with Melody's birthday party. They were cute and pretty entertaining. All in all, this movie isn't as awful as it could have been. It will most likely entertain kids under the age of 6, but older fans of the original shouldn't waste their time watching it.",2,Great...

I can't even name a live action movie that has 2 or more directors. The forumal that works in a lot of the Disney movies, doesn't work here. Once again, a Disney animated movie that has either scary scenes or violence or both. Who ideas was it to do sequels for pretty much every Disney movie ever made. Mr. Disney did make any sequels to any of his films. As the movie opens, Ursual's evil sister Morgana (Patt Carroll who also voiced Urusal in the first movie) wants Ariel's (Jodie Benson) father King Trition (Kennth Mars) to give her, her evils siter's trition back to her. And then she shrinks her evil side kick to little, and hindes out, and when Morgona can't be found, Ariel decides that it would be safe for her daughter (Tara Strong) not to know of her home, her father, or anything about the sea, giving back to her dad the locket he give her with her name on it. A lot of this movie reminded me of Sleeping Beauty, which the daughter of a king and a queen amd thier daughterwas in trouble with the movie's villian. What's next Lilo & Stitch 2?

483402,AID8OJP77VK6Y,6305940932,unicornelia,"[13, 16]","Trying to make a sequel to the masterpiece that is The Little Mermaid was unlikely to work in the first place. The Little Mermaid stands out as one of the greatest animated movies ever, and certainly has some of the best music. This sequel falls short on many levels, especially music, and Melody is a big disappointment to those of us who appreciated how beautiful Ariel was. Melody's story is her mother's in reverse; she wants to be a mermaid, not a human. Morgana is just like Ursula, though she and Undertow the shark/piranha and Cloak/Dagger the manta rays are pretty funny. Ariel is a mother now and a kind of ""blah"" character. She isn't completely ruined, like Tramp or Simba, because at first she wants to share her past life with her daughter. It's Morgana's threat that causes her to hide Melody from the sea, King Triton, etc., and contain her within walls. Still, she and the Prince act very sterotypically in this movie and lack real character. Sebastian is back, luckily. Titanic Tip the penguin and Daring Dash the walrus--two young wannabe heroes who befriend and assist Melody--are an attempt at an arctic-dwelling Timon and Pumbaa. They're the comic relief and the silliness. Tip is Timon, the little wisecracker, and Dash is Pumbaa, the big, not-too-bright old soft guy. I see the relation here quite clearly. At any rate, this movie isn't too awful to watch on occasion, but do not expect the glory of the original Little Mermaid. I think this story could have been made into a much more decent film, had they left out some of the things that added to its corny/cheesy factor. For instance, how many times do we want to hear a parent say, ""You deliberately disobeyed me""? That was ripped right from the Lion King (the only film in which it sounded sincere), and Jungle Book 2 also ripped it straight from there. Aren't there other, less cliche things to say to get the same point across? The ending is also a cliffhanger; Melody uses the trident to disapparate the wall, and everyone--humans and merpeople--join together in song and merriment. But then what? Does Melody choose to remain on land or at sea? We assume on land, but it's unclear. Either way, mysterious fates and endings can be very good, and it's not like most people will care one way or the other about Melody. So on the whole, it's worth seeing IF you enjoy animated movies and the first Little Mermaid, but won't be too touchy about a sequel that doesn't live up.

Hamilton,"[18, 22]","Ever since &quot;Return of Jafar&quot; became a bestselling video, Disney has delighted fans and upset critics by releasing direct-to-video sequels  of most of its recent theatrical features.  After eleven years, The Little  Mermaid gets its own treatment...but this one is actually pretty good.  Disney has come a long way from &quot;Jafar&quot; to here, stopping along  the way to create the excellent &quot;Simba's Pride&quot;.  This movie  starts awkwardly, and the first few minutes are both cheesy and a complete  rip-off of the opening of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;.  But, if you stay  with it, it really does get better.  There's actually excitement and at  least one or two decent songs.  The animation, however, is still very  direct-to-video, produced by the Disney TV team rather than the feature  film department...but even the characters are looking more three  dimensional than previous &quot;cheapies&quot;.
