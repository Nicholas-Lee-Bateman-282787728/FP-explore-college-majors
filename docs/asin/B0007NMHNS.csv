Seldom have I seen a performance that completely captures the essence of a character as does that of Megan Fellows as Anne. To see her is to see Anne as she unfolds through the pages of Montgomery's charming and insightful novel. This adaptation and performance is simply the best. It has everything one would expect from a great story, filled with charm, humor, sadness, and gladness. While it is filled with stories that touch on all the aspects of human strength and frailness it is a story of love. The pure and innocent love of a young girl who overcomes the difficulties life has dealt her. Beyond that it is a lesson in how one person filled with love and imagination can change the lives of all those she comes in contact with.

We laughed and cried all over again, and we still enjoy watching them together.The casting was perfect.  Anne, Gilbert, Diana, Marilla, and Rachel were exactly as I had pictured them!  In fact, the actresses who played Marilla and Rachel went on to play their respective characters in the television show Avonlea that was based off of Lucy Maud Montgomery's books.The third movie takes place when Gilbert is off at war.  For lovers of the books, just be aware that this was a storyline created entirely by the makers of the movie.  It's not a Lucy Maud Montgomery creation at all, and there is no book or story relating to this plot at all.

One was the incredible scope of Megan Follows' performance, as she plays Anne through three phases of her life.  Simply marvelous.  And second, that though the stories will appeal to all audiences, they were mainly about Anne's serious interaction with other women --her step mother,  friends in school, women of the town, women at college, women where Anne goes to teach and finally even women in Europe during the war.  There are plenty of strong men in the series, and wonderful actors, but these fine interesting relationships make this a top notch film in many respects.  The photography was very simply gorgeous. I recommend this as top flight family entertainment, and of interest to people of all ages, really.

883916,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B0007NMHNS,A_Plain_Janeite,"[1, 1]","I was first introduced to movies 1 & 2 when I was a late teen (over a decade ago), during one of the PBS telethons.  I had not read the books before, so I had nothing to compare them to (perhaps that's a good thing).For me, the acting is top notch, the storyline uplifting, scenery/locations breathtaking, and the score *particularly the theme* enthralling (although not included on the soundtrack, the piano rendition by Jonathon Lee is amazing)!I can't believe it's taken me this long to add to my collection!In November I was able to finally purchase the book set, and have since eagerly devoured books 1-8.I highly recommend any fan of the movie series to do this; there's so much depth to the story than is portrayed on screen!I will say that I'm a tad disappointed now in regards to the 2nd movie, being it contains very little of the events and characters of book 2,  and basically skipped all of book 3 (which chronicles Anne & Gilbert's 4 college years at Redmond).Too, we see the formation of new characters; combining 2 or 3 originals into one.  For example, Morgan Harris = Roy Gardner (book 3), and Mr. Grayson (book 4); Emmeline Harris = Sophie Sinclaire, & Elizabeth Grayson (book 4) ; Margaret Harris =  Miss Sarah Pringle, Mrs. Campbell, &  Mrs. Adoniram Gibson (book 4);  Pauline Harris = Pauline Gibson (book 4).I suppose it had to be done to accommodate the merging of books 2-4 into one cohesive story.  But I would have preferred that the movies stayed closer to the books.  Really, it would have been better to leave out book 4 (the least interesting so far in my reading), and focus on books 2, 3, & 5  for the second movie, and 6-8 for the third.I haven't seen the 3'd movie in years; but have plans as soon as I finish pt. 2 of the second movie.Unfortunately, it really doesn't follow any of LMM's book series at all (aside from one event).The books were set in the late Victorian era (1876- onward; for in-depth info on each books timeline, etc. go here: anneofgreengables.wikia(DOT)com/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_Wiki ), whereas the movies are set in the mid to late Edwardian period.The last book in the ""Anne"" set- ""Rilla of Ingleside""- takes place during WW1, but is centered around her oldest children.The only semi-consolation is, at least Megan (Anne), and Jonathan (Gilbert) reprise their roles, and gives fans a little closure for their characters romantic storyline; along with some deleted scenes._______Also, I don't know if my eyes were deceiving me, but it seemed like on the first disc, there were moments when the words were out of sync with their mouths.I chose to go with the ""Collector's Edition"", being my research has lead me to believe the ""Restoration"" is not much of an improvement-- at least for the money; and the 4th movie sounds like a downright abomination!**You might want to check out this site for a comprehensive comparison of some of the releases (namely the ""Restored/Restoration"" vs. ""Collector's (Anniversary)"" edition**:avonleavignettes(DOT)com/anne/comparison.htmlavonleavignettes(DOT)com/anne/comparison2.htmlavonleavignettes(DOT)com/misc/restoration.htmlavonleavignettes(DOT)com/misc/20threview.html________In conclusion, I highly recommend this series for those that enjoy period drama, or are looking for something suitable for family viewing (at least 1 & 2)!  I feel this trilogy series really brings to life the essence of this beloved book series, and for that- despite some major changes- I give it 4 stars!Other film adaptations like it: ""Christy"" (short lived TV series 1994/95) based on Catherine Marshall's novel.  And a brand new series by the Hallmark channel entitled ""When Calls the Heart"", based on Janette Oke's ""Canadian West"" book series._______**Side note, there is an interesting interview here with Kevin Sullivan about the movies, and some reasons of his for writing them the way he did:  avonlea.hu/guide/interviews/kevin_sullivanAs mentioned in that interview, there was a lawsuit between him and LMM's heirs, so perhaps that had a bearing on the storyline of the 3'd movie?  Perhaps this is also why nobody else has attempted to make another adaptation? ...I for one would be interested in seeing another interpretation more true to the books, but I have doubts that it will ever happen.**",4,The Essence of Anne (Movies 1 & 2),1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,4282,"['was', 'first', 'introduced', 'movies', '1', '2', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'teen', 'decade', 'ago', 'one', 'PBS', 'telethons', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'had', 'nothing', 'compare', 'perhaps', 'good', 'thing', '.For', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'storyline', 'uplifting', 'scenery/locations', 'breathtaking', 'score', '*particularly', 'theme*', 'enthralling', 'not', 'included', 'soundtrack', 'piano', 'rendition', 'Jonathon', 'Lee', 'amazing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'taken', 'long', 'add', 'collection', 'November', 'was', 'able', 'finally', 'purchase', 'book', 'set', 'have', 'eagerly', 'devoured', 'books', '1-8.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'movie', 'series', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'story', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'will', 'say', ""'m"", 'tad', 'disappointed', 'now', 'regards', '2nd', 'movie', 'being', 'very', 'little', 'events', 'characters', 'book', '2', 'basically', 'skipped', 'book', '3', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', '4', 'college', 'years', 'Redmond', '.Too', 'see', 'formation', 'new', 'characters', 'combining', '2', '3', 'originals', 'one', 'example', 'Morgan', 'Harris', '=', 'Roy', 'Gardner', 'book', '3', 'Mr.', 'Grayson', 'book', '4', 'Emmeline', 'Harris', '=', 'Sophie', 'Sinclaire', 'Elizabeth', 'Grayson', 'book', '4', 'Margaret', 'Harris', '=', 'Miss', 'Sarah', 'Pringle', 'Mrs.', 'Campbell', 'Mrs.', 'Adoniram', 'Gibson', 'book', '4', 'Pauline', 'Harris', '=', 'Pauline', 'Gibson', 'book', '4', '.I', 'suppose', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'accommodate', 'merging', 'books', '2-4', 'one', 'cohesive', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'movies', 'stayed', 'closer', 'books', 'Really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'leave', 'out', 'book', '4', 'least', 'interesting', 'so', 'far', 'reading', 'focus', 'books', '2', '3', '5', 'second', 'movie', '6-8', 'third.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '3', ""'d"", 'movie', 'years', 'have', 'plans', 'as', 'soon', 'finish', 'pt', '2', 'second', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'really', ""n't"", 'follow', 'LMM', 'book', 'series', 'aside', 'one', 'event', '.The', 'books', 'were', 'set', 'late', 'Victorian', 'era', '1876-', 'onward', 'in-depth', 'info', 'books', 'timeline', 'etc', 'go', 'here', 'anneofgreengables.wikia', 'DOT', 'com/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_Wiki', 'movies', 'are', 'set', 'mid', 'late', 'Edwardian', 'period.The', 'last', 'book', 'Anne', 'set-', 'Rilla', 'Ingleside', 'place', 'WW1', 'centered', 'oldest', 'children.The', 'only', 'semi-consolation', 'least', 'Megan', 'Anne', 'Jonathan', 'Gilbert', 'reprise', 'roles', 'fans', 'little', 'closure', 'characters', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'deleted', 'scenes._______Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'eyes', 'were', 'deceiving', 'seemed', 'first', 'disc', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'words', 'were', 'sync', 'mouths.I', 'chose', 'go', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'being', 'research', 'lead', 'believe', 'Restoration', 'not', 'much', 'improvement', 'least', 'money', '4th', 'movie', 'sounds', 'downright', 'abomination', '**You', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'site', 'comprehensive', 'comparison', 'releases', 'namely', 'Restored/Restoration', 'Collector', 'Anniversary', 'edition**', 'avonleavignettes', 'DOT', 'DOT', 'DOT', 'DOT', 'com/misc/20threview.html________In', 'conclusion', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'enjoy', 'period', 'drama', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing', 'least', '1', '2', 'feel', 'trilogy', 'series', 'really', 'life', 'essence', 'beloved', 'book', 'series', 'that-', 'major', 'changes-', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'Other', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Christy', 'short', 'lived', 'TV', 'series', '1994/95', 'based', 'Catherine', 'Marshall', 'novel', 'brand', 'new', 'series', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'entitled', 'When', 'Heart', 'based', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'Canadian', 'West', 'book', 'series._______**Side', 'note', 'interesting', 'interview', 'here', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'movies', 'reasons', 'writing', 'way', 'did', 'avonlea.hu/guide/interviews/kevin_sullivanAs', 'mentioned', 'interview', 'was', 'lawsuit', 'LMM', 'heirs', 'so', 'perhaps', 'had', 'bearing', 'storyline', '3', ""'d"", 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'also', 'why', 'nobody', 'else', 'attempted', 'make', 'adaptation', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'interpretation', 'more', 'true', 'books', 'have', 'doubts', 'will', 'ever', 'happen', '**']",N/A

Megan Follows played the part of Anne Shirley to absolute perfection. I will watch the first two DVD's endlessly. I never grow tired of watching my favorite books come to life on screen. Of course this was not the case for the ""Continuing"" story. It was not continuing anything as far as Lucy Maud Montgomery was concerned. I found the third film to be terribly depressing and it annoyed me to death that the third film did not follow the books. I've seen it once and do not plan on watching it again. (Apparently Megan Follows had many misgivings about the same thing). I'm glad she played Anne once more, and her acting was superb as usual but the final film had none of the magic of the first two.As for the quality of the DVD's. Not so good. Which is why I only gave four stars. On several occasions the voice track did not match the actors. This happened on both DVD's of the first two films. It was terribly distracting. It would right itself eventually, but it was annoying nonetheless. The Continuing story DVD had side two on side one.

Thank you Amazon for providing vendors who compete in price and quality.I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when it was on PBS, when each segment was on a week-by-week schedule, torment waiting 7 days to watch the next story one hour at a time.  I read the books in between because the suspense was too much and was captivated by L.M. Montgomery, the author.I've spent the last 5 days watching the dvd trilogy, remembering Anne's antics, allowing her to get on my nerves; funny how you view a movie in different stages of your life and relate to it in a new way.This really is a beautiful love story and I thank Kevin Sullivan for maintaining all of the same actors throughout the trilogy.  That is what makes it very special.  Thank you Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie for allowing 'The Continuing Story' be the closure for us in Anne and Gilbert's life by your maintaining continuity and making the story(s) believable as the viewer watches you grow and mature.So much in life does not stay the same, no matter how much we wish it could.  L.M. Montgomery did not include a war in her books, however it is important as it shows the viewer that life isn't to be lived behind rose-colored glasses.  Anne and Gil are shell shocked through the ravages of the war, yet one thing remains constant, their love for one another.  The final story does not end with a kiss, a hug or a fade out.  The Trilogy ends as Ms. Montgomery would have ended it--with the viewer knowing that the only thing that matters to Anne and Gil is that they are together and that is enough for them.",5,"This should be Anne of Green Gables, The Story",1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,1640,"['Waited', 'long', 'time', 'purchase', 'set', 'price', 'Thank', 'Amazon', 'providing', 'vendors', 'who', 'compete', 'price', 'quality.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'when', 'was', 'PBS', 'when', 'segment', 'was', 'week-by-week', 'schedule', 'torment', 'waiting', '7', 'days', 'watch', 'next', 'story', 'one', 'hour', 'time', 'read', 'books', 'suspense', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'captivated', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'author.I', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'last', '5', 'days', 'watching', 'dvd', 'trilogy', 'remembering', 'Anne', 'antics', 'allowing', 'get', 'nerves', 'funny', 'how', 'view', 'movie', 'different', 'stages', 'life', 'relate', 'new', 'way.This', 'really', 'beautiful', 'love', 'story', 'thank', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'maintaining', 'same', 'actors', 'trilogy', 'what', 'very', 'special', 'Thank', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'allowing', ""'The"", 'Continuing', 'Story', 'be', 'closure', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'life', 'maintaining', 'continuity', 'making', 'story', 'believable', 'viewer', 'watches', 'grow', 'mature.So', 'much', 'life', 'not', 'stay', 'same', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'wish', 'could', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'war', 'books', 'however', 'important', 'viewer', 'life', ""n't"", 'be', 'lived', 'rose-colored', 'glasses', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'are', 'shell', 'shocked', 'ravages', 'war', 'yet', 'one', 'thing', 'constant', 'love', 'one', 'final', 'story', 'not', 'end', 'kiss', 'hug', 'fade', 'out', 'Trilogy', 'Ms.', 'Montgomery', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'viewer', 'knowing', 'only', 'thing', 'Anne', 'Gil', 'are', 'together', 'enough']",N/A

OK, maybe the first installment the best, as the second and third deviated from the original books more and more, to eventually have little to do with the L.M. Montgomery stories other than the characters.  I believe Megan Follows (who plays Anne) actually had some issues with this.Why three stars?  Clearly, not so much my rating of the films themselves, but of the DVD quality.  The films should get 5+ stars. However, I purchased this particular DVD set under the impression that, as opposed to the earlier DVD editions, the image had been 'digitally restored,' as the package claims.  Not only was the video quality not any better than previous editions, it still is only slightly better than an VHS copy!  This has been something that has always bothered me deeply, because such gorgeous cinematography coupled with super acting deserves, in my opinion, superior quality digital editions.  To this day, the films never have gotten such treatment.  If they have, they sure do not look like it.  There is really no reason why the video quality should not be better than it is.  Maybe they tried to compress too much into too little space, I don't know.  Some scenes are almost painful to watch (i.e. the scene when Matthew and Anne arrive at Green Gables), because the image quality is quite poor.  I hope that eventually Sullivan Productions releases these films (as well as the 'Road to Avonlea' series, whose DVD releases also lack in video quality) with the quality they (and us) deserve.So, if you have considered buying this set to replace the earlier editions with the expectation to be wowed by superb digital video restoration, save your money!

The first, Anne of Green Gables, is by far the best, and is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations I have ever seen. The second, Anne of Avonlea AKA Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel, is also wonderful, a worthy sequel to the first and a lovely adaptation of the next few books in the series. And as for the third, Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story... well, it's just bad. Not only does it have nothing whatsoever to do with the books besides names, it's not a good movie even when taken on its own. Other reviewers have already explained its problems, but I'll just touch on the biggest ones.First off, it is an in-name-only adaptation of the books, so don't expect the storyline to follow the books AT ALL: second, the writing is terribly sloppy, reading more like a bad fanfic than anything else: the plot is unbelievable, chock-full of contrived coincidences (so Anne just *happened* to run into old friends and loved ones not once, not twice, but THREE times while gallivanting about Europe?): and finally, the characters have changed completely, not just from the books, but from the first two movies, as well. I realize that, in-story, years have passed between the second and third movies, but Anne, Gilbert, Diana and the rest all seem to have gone through 180 degree personality changes. And who made the decision to make Anne a klutz who squees like a fangirl every time she sees Gil? I mean, *I* squee like the fangirl I am whenever Gil comes onscreen, but I'm a viewer, I'm supposed to do that! Anne would never behave that way around Gil.In any case, the first two miniseries are perfectly charming and fantastic, more than making up for the abortion that is The Continuing Story. I highly recommend the Anne trilogy DVD to anyone who loves Anne of Green Gables, period films or just all-around great storytelling.

I am very glad they are closed captioned.1. Anne of Green Gables is one of the best novels ever written and the mini-series is presented very well and is accurate to the book. It is an outstanding rendition. The release of this set is nicely timed with the 100th anniversary of the novel.2. I like the first sequel even though they made changes, mostly because they were faithful to the flavour of the novel and kept most people & characters the same as they were in the books. This movie is semi-loosely based on Anne of the Island and Anne of Windy Poplars. However, I do miss Roy Gardner!3. I do not care for the 2nd sequel because I feel they went too far from the words that made Montgomery famous. I would have preferred if they had presented Anne's House of Dreams which is one of LMM's best books. Instead they borrowed ideas from Rilla of Ingleside and made Gilbert (and Anne) go off to war. They did not present A & G's wedding well at all and I was disappointed. Jon Crombie's characterization of Gilbert was very altered.

Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert ask for a foster child to help out at their farm.  Instead of the boy they expected, Anne Shirley arrives.  They agree to keep her for the time being but Anne's head in the cloud constantly gets her in trouble.  But what Marilla sees in Anne is herself and Matthew loves her spunk.  Anne proves that she is quite intelligent and excells at the local school.  Diana Berry becomes her best bossom buddy for life.  While Gilbert Blythe becomes her love interest but she is not speaking to him because of his continual kidding.  Anne trains to become a province teacher but decides to give it up when Matthew sudenly dies.This introduced us to the incredible Megan Follows who shined in as Anne.  It also gave great roles to two American treasures, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth.In Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel (a.k.a. Anne of Avonlea), Anne's adventures in Avonlea continue.  Anne wants to be a writer but everything submitted is rejected.  That is until life long bossom buddy Diana Berry submits it to a writng competition and it wins.  Anne gets a posting in Kingsport at an exclusive girls school.  But she finds out that the Pringles run this town and she took the place of one of their clan.  She spends the rest of the movie converting everyone over.  On the romance side, Diana gets married but Anne rejects Gilbert's proposal.Once again, Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst give great performances and are joined by the great Wendy Hiller as the head of the Pringle clan (although she really can't stand her relatives.)Part 3 is Anne of Green Gables: The Story Continues.  Anne is continuing her ambitions as a writer and her love for Gilbert Blythe.  But WWI breaks out and Gilbert enlists.  When Gilbert goes missing it's upto Anne to find him. (By the way this is not based on a LMM book but fans wanted closure, so the producers made this final episode!)This is a much more serious episode but Megan Follows shows you she is up to it.This new set has all three mini-series plus two documentaries and a lost mini - episode.If you want a DVD set that is good for the whole family.  It is well written and directed.

883973,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B0007NMHNS,Mr. Mambo,"[276, 285]","I watched these on VHS with my family years ago. Back then my daughter, about ten or so, same age as Anne when we first see her, was reading the novels; renting the videos was a natural thing. I was reluctant to watch the first story--my tastes tend more toward gritty crime and action stuff--but I watched them with my wife, daughter, and 8-yr. old son. It did not take me long to get caught up in the enthralling story. Canadian actress Megan Follows with her flaming red hair, which she is initially so ashamed of, is absolutely perfect as Anne Shirley. I would say she was born to play that role. All of the characters and portrayals are so wonderful that you will be thoroughly entertained. The late and indescribably great Richard Farnsworth is his typical screen self: stoic, quiet, restrained, shy, honest, fun-loving, humble, self-sacrificing, hard-working, strong, venerable. And gents: isn't that a list of very admirable traits? What man would not want to be remembered in such a way? So there you have one reason why you, as a man and father, should watch this series: if you pattern yourself after Mr. Farnsworth in this film, you will be on the right track. I absolutely defy anyone, even the most macho guy in the world, to not gush with tears upon viewing the scene where Farnworth's character buys, and then presents the beautiful party dress to Anne.Another reason to watch this: you and your children will be seeing a solid and dignified life being put together before your eyes. Anne is an intelligent girl, but she understands the value of hard work. She loves to have fun, can be a bit contrary and capricious, but when the job needs to be done, she will do whatever it takes. She is an orphan who, through sheer determination and hard work, overcomes her meagre beginnings to really make a name for herself in the world. She is happy, and she takes life as it comes. Most importantly, she has a good heart and high moral standards. What parent would not want their child to be so described?While it is very true that nowadays it is difficult to find good ""family"" viewing, if you look around, you will find it. Start here, dads; buy this set for your family and most importantly, spend some quality time with them watching the set. This is one of the best things you could do for them.I guarantee it: you will laugh, you will cry, you will be afraid, you will exult. You will experience every emotion life has to offer. There are no cardboard cutout characters here; no one is perfect. That's another reason to watch: it's like life, and through meeting these living and breathing characters with all of their frailties and foibles, your kids will get a taste, albeit a vicarious one, of what the world is like. Perhaps they will begin to understand that life is not quite fair, that you have to work pretty hard, that people can be unkind even when you are kind to them, and most important, to be yourself. Anne the unkempt orphan comes into the life of the dour old spinster and her hard-working farmer brother, and gradually over time she becomes their savior. She saves them from a life of monotony, self-involvement and predictability; she teaches them how to be patient, how to laugh, how to prioritize. Isn't that what children do for their parents, if the parents will let them?Anne is a girl who becomes a truly successful adult, if you measure success by how happy, intelligent, self-assured, confident, caring and fulfilled she is. If your kids can pick up some of those traits by watching the series, and you can help them, how can you go wrong?",5,Essential Viewing for Fathers,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,3581,"['watched', 'VHS', 'family', 'years', 'ago', 'Back', 'then', 'daughter', 'about', 'ten', 'so', 'same', 'age', 'Anne', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'was', 'reading', 'novels', 'renting', 'videos', 'was', 'natural', 'thing', 'was', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'first', 'story', 'tastes', 'tend', 'more', 'gritty', 'crime', 'action', 'stuff', 'watched', 'wife', 'daughter', '8-yr.', 'old', 'son', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'enthralling', 'story', 'Canadian', 'actress', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'flaming', 'red', 'hair', 'initially', 'so', 'ashamed', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'role', 'characters', 'portrayals', 'are', 'so', 'wonderful', 'will', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'late', 'indescribably', 'great', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'typical', 'screen', 'self', 'stoic', 'quiet', 'restrained', 'shy', 'honest', 'fun-loving', 'humble', 'self-sacrificing', 'hard-working', 'strong', 'venerable', 'gents', ""n't"", 'list', 'very', 'admirable', 'traits', 'What', 'man', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'remembered', 'such', 'way', 'So', 'there', 'have', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'man', 'father', 'should', 'watch', 'series', 'pattern', 'Mr.', 'Farnsworth', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'track', 'absolutely', 'defy', 'anyone', 'even', 'most', 'macho', 'guy', 'world', 'not', 'gush', 'tears', 'viewing', 'scene', 'where', 'Farnworth', 'character', 'buys', 'then', 'beautiful', 'party', 'dress', 'Anne.Another', 'reason', 'watch', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'solid', 'dignified', 'life', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'eyes', 'Anne', 'intelligent', 'girl', 'value', 'hard', 'work', 'have', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'contrary', 'capricious', 'when', 'job', 'be', 'done', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'orphan', 'who', 'sheer', 'determination', 'hard', 'work', 'meagre', 'beginnings', 'really', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'world', 'happy', 'life', 'Most', 'importantly', 'good', 'heart', 'high', 'moral', 'standards', 'What', 'parent', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'child', 'be', 'so', 'described', 'very', 'true', 'difficult', 'find', 'good', 'family', 'viewing', 'look', 'around', 'will', 'find', 'Start', 'here', 'dads', 'buy', 'set', 'family', 'most', 'importantly', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'watching', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'could', 'do', 'them.I', 'guarantee', 'will', 'laugh', 'will', 'cry', 'will', 'be', 'afraid', 'will', 'exult', 'will', 'experience', 'emotion', 'life', 'offer', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'characters', 'here', 'one', 'perfect', 'reason', 'watch', 'like', 'life', 'meeting', 'living', 'breathing', 'characters', 'frailties', 'foibles', 'kids', 'will', 'get', 'taste', 'vicarious', 'one', 'what', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'begin', 'understand', 'life', 'not', 'quite', 'fair', 'have', 'work', 'pretty', 'hard', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'unkind', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'kind', 'most', 'important', 'be', 'Anne', 'unkempt', 'orphan', 'life', 'dour', 'old', 'spinster', 'hard-working', 'farmer', 'brother', 'gradually', 'time', 'savior', 'life', 'monotony', 'self-involvement', 'predictability', 'how', 'be', 'patient', 'how', 'laugh', 'how', 'prioritize', ""n't"", 'what', 'children', 'do', 'parents', 'parents', 'will', 'let', 'Anne', 'girl', 'who', 'truly', 'successful', 'adult', 'measure', 'success', 'how', 'happy', 'intelligent', 'self-assured', 'confident', 'caring', 'fulfilled', 'kids', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'traits', 'watching', 'series', 'can', 'help', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

The story of the orphan Anne who is taken in by two siblings, Matthew & Marilla Cuthbert is so appealing for all the characters are people we can relate to & love. Anne is a fiery, wilful redhead, played excellently by Megan Fellows. She is ambitious, hot-tempered, and yet possesses a vulnerability that makes her so lovable. Richard Farnsworth is amazing as the soft-spoken Matthew Cuthbert who loves Anne unconditionally, and Colleen Dewhurst plays Marilla Cuthbert, an aging spinster, who seems like a curmudgeon, but is really a softie when it comes to Anne...the stories of Anne's adventures will make your heart sing, and yearn for more innocent times, when kids played with a carefree spirit, and no worries...when imagination was put to good use, and the great outdoors were a main source of entertainment.Anne of Green Gables - The SequelContrary to some reviews, I truly enjoyed this DVD. Megan Fellowes reprises her role as Anne Shirley, who embarks on an adventure when she takes up a teaching position at Kingsport Ladies College, finding challenges & romance along the way...but as always, Anne finds her way back to Avonlea. I won't give too much away here, but suffice to say that this DVD is worth watching[ despite being very loosely adapted from the books] if only because all the characters are played so well by the actors/actresses. Megan Fellowes performance is truly a joy to watch, she is an amazing actress with a great range of emotions, and the story flows smoothly, with humor, heartache, and romance. What more could one ask for?Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing StoryThis was the worst in the Anne series and is only worth watching for Megan Fellowes' performance. As always, she does an amazing job as Anne, and in fact I could never imagine any other actress doing justice to Anne's character! Back to the DVD, I felt that the writers did a poor job of continuing Anne & Gilbert's story...they got them married off in a jiffy [when so many fans were eagerly anticipating a nice, long-drawn fairytale wedding], and then after a brief stint in NY, Gilbert enlists in WW I! So, Anne of course has to go find him when he is reported missing, and the adventures she encounters along the way make up the rest of the story. This sequel is definitely the weakest in the DVD trilogy, but nevertheless a worthwhile watch, if only to see Anne again, and if you yearn for the Anne of before...then I suggest watching the earlier two DVDs which are far superior in production and acting to this one.CONCLUSION - I'd only recommend purchasing this DVD set if you don't already own the individual DVDs and are keen to view the new documentaries. Actually, it might help to shop around as I've seen this DVD set retailing at much less at other places. Also, there's a new Kevin Sullivan production of Anne titled ""Anne of Green Gables - a New Beginning, which purports to trace Anne's life before she came to live with the Cuthberts, but which apparently is not based on the LM Montgomery books.  I'm not sure as to when this DVD is being released, but some fans might want to wait till all four Anne movies are released in one complete set.",5,"Contains all 3 Anne movies, 2 new documentaries and some extras",1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,3985,"['Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'CollectionThis', 'DVD', 'collection', 'three', 'Anne', 'movies', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', '-The', 'Sequel', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', '-The', 'Continuing', 'Story', 'are', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'discs', 'as', 'well', 'additional', 'bonus', 'features', 'such', 'additional', 'footage', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'missing', 'episode', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'Death', 'two', 'new', 'documentaries', 'L.M', 'Montgomery', 'Island', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'Classic', 'as', 'well', 'featurette', 'WWI', 'historical', 'commentary', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'Here', 'brief', 'review', 'Anne', 'movies', 'Anne', 'Green', 'GablesI', 'loved', 'reading', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'stories', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'then', 'discovered', 'DVDs', 'adult', 'found', 'Anne', 'story', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'treasured', 'classic', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'story', 'orphan', 'Anne', 'who', 'taken', 'two', 'siblings', 'Matthew', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'so', 'appealing', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'love', 'Anne', 'fiery', 'wilful', 'redhead', 'played', 'excellently', 'Megan', 'Fellows', 'ambitious', 'hot-tempered', 'yet', 'vulnerability', 'so', 'lovable', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'amazing', 'soft-spoken', 'Matthew', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'Anne', 'unconditionally', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Marilla', 'Cuthbert', 'aging', 'spinster', 'who', 'curmudgeon', 'really', 'softie', 'when', 'Anne', 'stories', 'Anne', 'adventures', 'will', 'make', 'heart', 'sing', 'yearn', 'more', 'innocent', 'times', 'when', 'kids', 'played', 'carefree', 'spirit', 'worries', 'when', 'imagination', 'was', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'great', 'outdoors', 'were', 'main', 'source', 'entertainment.Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'SequelContrary', 'reviews', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'Megan', 'Fellowes', 'role', 'Anne', 'Shirley', 'who', 'adventure', 'when', 'up', 'teaching', 'position', 'Kingsport', 'Ladies', 'College', 'finding', 'challenges', 'romance', 'way', 'always', 'Anne', 'way', 'back', 'Avonlea', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', 'suffice', 'say', 'DVD', 'worth', 'watching', '[', 'being', 'very', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'books', ']', 'only', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'actors/actresses', 'Megan', 'Fellowes', 'performance', 'truly', 'joy', 'watch', 'amazing', 'actress', 'great', 'range', 'emotions', 'story', 'smoothly', 'humor', 'heartache', 'romance', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'one', 'ask', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Continuing', 'StoryThis', 'was', 'worst', 'Anne', 'series', 'only', 'worth', 'watching', 'Megan', 'Fellowes', 'performance', 'always', 'amazing', 'job', 'Anne', 'fact', 'could', 'never', 'imagine', 'other', 'actress', 'doing', 'justice', 'Anne', 'character', 'Back', 'DVD', 'felt', 'writers', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'continuing', 'Anne', 'Gilbert', 'story', 'got', 'married', 'off', 'jiffy', '[', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'nice', 'long-drawn', 'fairytale', 'wedding', ']', 'then', 'brief', 'stint', 'NY', 'Gilbert', 'WW', 'So', 'Anne', 'course', 'go', 'find', 'when', 'reported', 'missing', 'adventures', 'way', 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'story', 'sequel', 'definitely', 'weakest', 'DVD', 'trilogy', 'nevertheless', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'only', 'see', 'Anne', 'again', 'yearn', 'Anne', 'before', 'then', 'suggest', 'watching', 'earlier', 'two', 'DVDs', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'production', 'acting', 'one.CONCLUSION', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'are', 'keen', 'view', 'new', 'documentaries', 'Actually', 'might', 'help', 'shop', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'set', 'retailing', 'much', 'less', 'other', 'places', 'Also', 'new', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'production', 'Anne', 'titled', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'New', 'Beginning', 'trace', 'Anne', 'life', 'came', 'live', 'Cuthberts', 'apparently', 'not', 'based', 'LM', 'Montgomery', 'books', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'when', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'fans', 'might', 'want', 'wait', 'till', 'four', 'Anne', 'movies', 'are', 'released', 'one', 'complete', 'set']",N/A
