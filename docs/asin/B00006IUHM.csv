717176,A2KZK48T08QE7P,B00006IUHM,Ange Vilain,"[0, 3]","This series is a gripping account of Germany's occupation of the Channel Islands during WW II.  As compelling as this series is, it does not paint the Nazi officers with a broad brush; not all of them wanted to be there, or involved in the war for that matter.  It also follows the lives of a handful of families living under stringent rules and the fear that many citizens had concerning losing their homes, limited rations of food (their farms were co-opted by the Nazis to feed their soldiers), and potential loss of life.The series also depicted the work ""farms"" where POWs were virtual slaves with very little to eat and sometimes not even that.  Many of the POWs succumbed under these stark and harrowing circumstances.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and the desperation shown in this series is heart-breaking.This is a well-written, well-acted series and I recommend it to all who want to know what life was like in an occupied land during WW II.",5,Excellent Depiction of Life Under Nazi Occupation During WW II.,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,967,"['series', 'gripping', 'account', 'Germany', 'occupation', 'Channel', 'Islands', 'WW', 'II', 'As', 'compelling', 'series', 'not', 'paint', 'Nazi', 'officers', 'broad', 'brush', 'not', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'involved', 'war', 'matter', 'also', 'lives', 'handful', 'families', 'living', 'stringent', 'rules', 'fear', 'many', 'citizens', 'had', 'concerning', 'losing', 'homes', 'limited', 'rations', 'food', 'farms', 'were', 'co-opted', 'Nazis', 'feed', 'soldiers', 'potential', 'loss', 'life.The', 'series', 'also', 'depicted', 'work', 'farms', 'where', 'POWs', 'were', 'virtual', 'slaves', 'very', 'little', 'eat', 'sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'Many', 'POWs', 'succumbed', 'stark', 'harrowing', 'circumstances', 'Desperate', 'times', 'call', 'desperate', 'measures', 'desperation', 'shown', 'series', 'heart-breaking.This', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'series', 'recommend', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'occupied', 'land', 'WW', 'II']",Enemy at the Door - Series 2

717182,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00006IUHM,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[7, 7]","A Brit WWII epic comparable to `Foyle's War' which set the 6-star standard. Foyle lived in a town waiting to be invaded. In ""Enemy at the Door"" the people of Guernsey were actually occupied by the Nazi forces. The channel island became a prison camp ruled by Nazi fear. Very compelling dramatic portrayals of what probably took place.""Enemy at the Door 2"" begins already 3 years into the war. In June, 1940, Guernsey, received occupying German forces. The Nazis planned the next step to be mainland invasion, but what did the Guernsey locals do? This is a continuation of ""Enemy at the Door: Series 1"" (highly recommended.) Each of 13 episodes (50 min) are like a stand-alone story about living on this occupied island, amidst the fears of war, yet having to learn to live with and under an enemy force. Stories surrounding the lives of locals create both exciting and heartbreaking plots. Loves, interaction, hateful attacks, prison, death, it's all there. VERY UN-PREDICTABLE, as real war life. The occupation really happened, the DVD is drama, the result is heart-pounding believable, almost documentary.Many locals have mixed feelings, some must walk the fine line between helping the Nazi command and looking out for the needs of the island's inhabitants during the occupation. Many lean on the defiant side of the line. Island doctor, Philip Martel (Branard Horsfall), reluctantly takes a role on the local committee to work with the enemy command in hopes it will advance fair treatment for the Guernsey population. Actions lead to imprisonment. Complications of 2 sides caught in an unwanted situation makes this series believable.An eye-opener for those never experiencing war. Defiance/survival tension for those under the occupation force. Not your normal WWII drama. You hate the German force in one episode and feel compassion for a Nazi officer in another. Emotional & enough connection by main characters to tie together all episodes. ""Enemy at the Door"" explains cohabitation and interaction between people during war, NOT the military war itself.A further look at the events of the channel island Nazi occupation come with the 6-episode (398 min) ""Island at War"". It's like adding another series to this. It is equally arresting viewing and comes in a package of British WWII tales. ""WARTIME BRITAIN"" also adds ""Housewife 49"" (93 min) and ""The Heat of the Day"". 3-in-1 pack, all European front WWII, all worth viewing.My wife and I were surprised to find this historical drama quite addicting. Very believable situations and human reaction make ""Enemy at the Door"" a recommended viewing. Both Series ONE & TWO.",5,NEW 2011 release look at war in your doorstep.
