And yet the most profound questions these alleged professionals ask seem to be along the lines of ""When will I next get laid?""  This is definitely a series in which the women try too hard to be like men. The mysteries themselves are competently written, and the acting is perfect. It's the structure of the team and main characters I find impossible to believe. I just cannot believe that two such capable women could be so vacuous, shallow, oversexed, and short sighted about their own lives and what is really important in life. The understory to each mystery, in which we get glimpses of the lives of Ash and Scribbs, never fail to undermine the watchability of the show, because their lives are so pointless and trivial. No serious reflection on anything, no aspirations about anything, no value on anything, except, as I said, getting laid.  As that rarely happens, the show is neither sexually nor violently intense. Almost a cozy, except instead of the warm wisdom of a Poirot or the unfailing optimism of Davison's LAST DETECTIVE, you get female, blond versions of Heckle and Jekyll bumping into the walls of life without ever catching on to what it is about.",3,Well built mysteries but truly lame characters,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,1375,"['MURDER', 'IN', 'SUBURBIA', 'allegedly', 'crack', 'investigative', 'team', 'Ash', 'Caroline', 'Catz', 'Scribbs', 'Lisa', 'Faulkner', 'who', 'witness', 'incredible', 'corruption', 'alienation', 'greed', 'perversion', 'sparkling', 'suburbia', 'yet', 'most', 'profound', 'questions', 'alleged', 'professionals', 'ask', 'seem', 'be', 'lines', 'When', 'will', 'next', 'get', 'laid', 'definitely', 'series', 'women', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'men', 'mysteries', 'are', 'competently', 'written', 'acting', 'perfect', 'structure', 'team', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'impossible', 'believe', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'two', 'such', 'capable', 'women', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'vacuous', 'shallow', 'oversexed', 'short', 'sighted', 'own', 'lives', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'understory', 'mystery', 'get', 'glimpses', 'lives', 'Ash', 'Scribbs', 'never', 'fail', 'undermine', 'watchability', 'show', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'pointless', 'trivial', 'serious', 'reflection', 'anything', 'aspirations', 'anything', 'value', 'anything', 'except', 'said', 'getting', 'laid', 'rarely', 'show', 'sexually', 'violently', 'intense', 'Almost', 'cozy', 'instead', 'warm', 'wisdom', 'Poirot', 'unfailing', 'optimism', 'Davison', 'LAST', 'DETECTIVE', 'get', 'female', 'blond', 'versions', 'Heckle', 'Jekyll', 'bumping', 'walls', 'life', 'ever', 'catching', 'what', 'about']",Murder in Suburbia - Series 1

991016,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000FII2Z2,Mel Odom,"[35, 36]","Detective Inspector Kate ""Ash"" Ashurst and Detective Sergeant Emma ""Scribs"" Scribbins are a homicide team operating in Middleford, a suburb of London.  The murders they usually investigate involve sex and lots of money, with the occasional dive into revenge and jealousy.  The six-episode first season is an absolute delight to watch, providing a murder, suspects, and a trail of tricky clues to keep armchair detectives guessing throughout.Caroline Catz (NEW STREET LAW) plays Ash and Lisa Faulkner (SPOOKS, MI-5) plays Scribs.  Both women are veterans of BBC detective and drama series, and their experience shows in their sleek handling of their roles.  When you first see them on screen, you immediately buy into their characters.Created by Nick Collins, the series is as much about the two women as it is the murders they solve.  Ash and Scribs lament over the lack of good men left in the world, and the fact that cops don't usually fare well in relationships.  Scribs is the more laidback, rule-ignoring one of the pair, while Ash is more image conscious and seems to have rules for everything.The two characters and actresses are delightful to watch.  During the first three episodes they grow and become more comfortable.  By the time the fourth episode rolls around, I felt like they were old friends settling in to tell me of their further exploits.The plots are intriguing and plotted well enough, though without the usual forensic evidence that most series seem to require these days.

The plots are tired imitations of great detective series that we have all watched if we subscribe to Prime.Many of the cast are fine actors who are far too talented for the lame dialog and trite story lines. The series is full of cliches, such as ""When X died part of me died too!"" Or something else along those lines.There is nothing special about the cinematography or direction. I am left wondering how anyone could give the series a rating of ""4"" or ""5"" in the face of amazingly well crafted series, like ""Taggart"" or ""Whitechapel.""Who in UK watched this? What demographic? What time of day? My fantasy is that exhausted housewives kept the series floating for 2 seasons, watching in the late afternoon after housework was done whilst waiting for children to return home for tea; or after children were packed away to do homework and getting everyone ready for bed was the next chapter in mum's book.

991026,A20UHWR387EFAG,B000FII2Z2,Smeddley,"[1, 1]","This series is very reminiscent of Midsomer Murders, only with two female detectives and a more suburban (less village-like) setting.  So not really at all like it, but similar in many respects...Now that I have you confused, I'll say that if you like Midsomer Murders you'll probably like this series.  It spotlights the more old-fashioned police work, unlike the flashy forensics shows that are all the rage at the moment.  Ash and Scribs work mostly with interviewing suspects and gathering information, and while forensic work does poke its head in occasionally, it's never the focus.  There are the dead ends and red herrings, and a few fun twists and turns.  It does have the predictable 'the suspect breaks down and confesses' problem, which I can't imagine is very realistic, but in terms of a TV show is fairly accepted.  The bad guy pouring out everything and explaining how it was done give the viewer so much more of a sense of closure than the suspect just being arrested and taken off to court, without anything being explained.  So that unrealistic bit I can certainly overlook.Plus, the characters are wonderful.  Neither is perfect, which is refreshing, and they have such a believable relationship.  They're not the best of friends, but they have an easy banter.  They're not terribly alike, but nor are they polar opposites.  They're witty and a bit acerbic, but not morose or mopey.  And as characters, they're both likeable.  And there's the attraction to and mystery of their boss.  Just enough of a hint of something there to get you hooked.Last but not least, the mysteries are good, solid whodunits.  A keen mind can solve the case along with Ash and Scribs, or you can be lazy and let the story unfold.  There's nothing too bizarre about them, and yet they are original enough to be entertaining.",5,Murder really shouldn't be this entertaining!,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1822,"['series', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'only', 'two', 'female', 'detectives', 'more', 'suburban', 'less', 'village-like', 'setting', 'So', 'not', 'really', 'similar', 'many', 'respects', 'Now', 'have', 'confused', ""'ll"", 'say', 'like', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'series', 'spotlights', 'more', 'old-fashioned', 'police', 'work', 'flashy', 'forensics', 'are', 'rage', 'moment', 'Ash', 'Scribs', 'work', 'mostly', 'interviewing', 'suspects', 'gathering', 'information', 'forensic', 'work', 'poke', 'head', 'occasionally', 'never', 'focus', 'are', 'dead', 'ends', 'red', 'herrings', 'few', 'fun', 'twists', 'turns', 'have', 'predictable', 'suspect', 'breaks', 'down', 'confesses', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'very', 'realistic', 'terms', 'TV', 'show', 'fairly', 'accepted', 'bad', 'guy', 'pouring', 'out', 'everything', 'explaining', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'give', 'viewer', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'closure', 'suspect', 'just', 'being', 'arrested', 'taken', 'off', 'court', 'anything', 'being', 'explained', 'unrealistic', 'bit', 'can', 'certainly', 'overlook.Plus', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'refreshing', 'have', 'believable', 'relationship', ""'re"", 'not', 'best', 'friends', 'have', 'easy', 'banter', ""'re"", 'not', 'terribly', 'alike', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', ""'re"", 'witty', 'bit', 'acerbic', 'not', 'morose', 'mopey', 'characters', ""'re"", 'likeable', 'attraction', 'mystery', 'boss', 'Just', 'enough', 'hint', 'something', 'there', 'get', 'hooked.Last', 'not', 'least', 'mysteries', 'are', 'good', 'solid', 'whodunits', 'keen', 'mind', 'can', 'solve', 'case', 'Ash', 'Scribs', 'can', 'be', 'lazy', 'let', 'story', 'unfold', 'nothing', 'too', 'bizarre', 'yet', 'are', 'original', 'enough', 'be', 'entertaining']",Murder in Suburbia - Series 1
