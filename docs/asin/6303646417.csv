383356,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,6303646417,Ace-of-Stars,"[11, 14]","*Having just come off of the 'reading' section, reviewing the 'audiobook' version of ""LIES And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"" I felt I'd do Mr. Franken a good turn by reviewing this movie as well. Why? Because, quite honestly, I'd never considered Al Franken to be that much of a comedian/satirist. I still feel that way for the most part; but as so many here have already said, this movie is something of a rare gem -- made rarer by the fact that the studios who produced it limited its theatrical release and its 'promotional budget,' so it never had much of an initial audience. In the end, however, that's not necessarily a bad thing, because now those same decisions have positioned this movie to potentially become a 'cult favorite,' given enough time & exposure.Prior to finding out about this movie just a little over a year ago, I had no knowledge of Al Franken's career in film or sitcoms -- or much of anything else prior to his book writing & radio talk show involvement. The only thing he had ever done that was even halfway memorable to me from his ""Saturday Night Live"" days was when he would periodically appear with Jane Curtain on the show's ""news"" segment (""Weekend Update""), appealing to the audience to ""...Find out what you can do for ME, 'Al Franken'."" Not even his ""Franken and Davis"" skits imprinted themselves on my memory.And I had *never* heard of ""Stuart Smalley"" until a ""certain someone"" began derogatorily referring to Al Franken this way. I was first made aware of this name after a CSPAN2 broadcast of a ""BookTV"" expo wherein a very perturbed Bill O'Reilly, who did not appreciate being labeled a ""lying liar,"" blew-up in front of everyone in attendance and, by extension, in front of the nationwide audience. Since that event, Mr. O'Reilly began to belittlingly refer to Mr. Franken on his radio and television ""Factors"" as ""Stuart Smalley.""Curious to understand O'Reilly's reason for applying this name to Franken, I found myself doing some research, whereupon I learned for the first time that ""Stuart Smalley"" was an ""SNL"" skit character created by Franken -- a sheepish, somewhat effeminate and over-drenched in 'hyper-positiveness' ""self-help"" guru. Inevitably, my delving into it would cause my attention to stumble across this movie based on the ""Stuart Smalley"" character.""Yeaaaahhhh...... Riiiiiiiiggggghhht......."" I thought to myself -- ""An ENTIRE movie (which I had NEVER heard of) based on a character (whom I had NEVER heard of) that appeared in variety show ""skits"" (which I had NEVER seen and was totally unfamiliar with) -- and, besides, Al Franken????"" And even though I thought it would be a nice non-violent way to 'beach-slap' Bill O'Reilly as my own individual response to his irritating obnoxiousness, there was no way I was going to waste good money for something (at an 'undiscounted' price, even) that would only later make me feel like a fool for doing so.But, as always, I read the reviews of others, and came away with the impression that MAYBE these folks knew something I didn't. These were, for the most part, clear-headed movie-lovers and critical thinkers -- they weren't ""Franken-Groupies"" lauding Mr. Franken because he's ""Al Franken"" (""groupie"" type reviews revolving around any actor/director/etc. are, for me, an instant warning sign to tread very carefully). The points, personal testimonies, genuine emotion, etc., expressed by the reviewers touched something in me, and against all better judgment I put this title on my order form.Is it a 'great' movie? Well..... no.Does that mean it's not a 'good' movie or that I'm not impressed with it? Absolutely not! I really did enjoy this movie; loved its uplifting (albeit saccharine) message; I even found myself able to 'identify' with the over-the-top (or is that 'under-the-bottom'?) Stuart. Franken, surprisingly, makes it easy for the audience to root for Stuart and to want to see him ""win.""And, yes, it is quite funny -- not so much in the ""gut-busting"" hilarious way, but more in a 'cute' and 'self-exploratory' way that makes us 'laugh at ourselves' while not even being aware that what we ARE in fact doing is laughing less at Stuart and his dysfunctional family and more at ourselves and our own dysfunctional families. (A stroke of genius on Franken's part? -- Or just a lucky stab in the dark? -- We may never know.)So just how impressed and satisfied was I with this movie? Enough to send an email to Mr. Bill O'Reilly to personally THANK him for 'bringing it to my attention' (true story) -- although to be more accurate, he pointed me in its direction.",3,"""What Can We

383362,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303646417,David Baldwin,"[5, 6]","I remember the Stuart Smalley sketches from ""Saturday Night Live"".  They used to back-end them on the show after the news where the less funny sketches were left to die.  This is not to say ""The Daily Affirmations"" were not funny, just mildly amusing tweekings of new-age 12-step programs that went down easy but eminently forgettable.  What amazes me about this film is how remarkably it has transcended it's roots as a 5-minute sketch into a wholly satisfying feature film.  Opening Stuart's character up to a larger world has done wonders.  It succeeds in showing the crisises that Stuart confronts both personally and professionally, namely, he loses his cable access show and his dysfunctional family is falling apart.  These turmoils are not only humorous their poignant.  Unfailingly, Stuart confronts these problems with all the lessons he's learned in self-help programs.  You can also say that this film is a great time-capsule of the nineties when 12-step programs were all the rage though, to the film's credit, it does not mock these programs that have been helpful to so many people.  Al Franken doesn't skip a beat in transferring Stuart from the small screen to the large screen.  He is abetted with a strong supporting cast that includes Laura San Giacomo, Harris Yulin, Shirley Knight, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Lesley Boone.

383366,A35FEM4C0LQTPN,6303646417,Mike Leone,"[31, 33]","Sadly, a lot of folks have never heard of this little gem.  It had a very short theatrical release but has been gaining a wider audience, largely among members of 12-step programs, through its various video releases.To describe the story line of this very funny movie would be to sell it short, because the premise doesn't sound like it would lend itself to such a delightful comedy.  But the film grabs one's attention from the very beginning with its montage of 50s and 60s family photographs during the opening credits.  Are these possibly family photos of the lead actors at an earlier stage of life?  When Vincent d'Onofrio's name is on the screen, the guy in the photo looks an awful lot like him.  And then we're off and running, with Stuart telling us on his television show that he has just received a sweater that one Melissa D. knitted for him.  Melissa is a recovering sex addict and knitting the sweater ""gave her something to do with her hands.""From that point on, the pace only rarely slackens, as we are introduced to Stuart's various friends and nemeses, beginning with Roz Weinstock, very possibly the meanest and most sadistic boss since Captain Bligh, and deliciously played by Camille Saviola.  Roz has fired Stuart for maligning her on the air, and she is only the first of a series of people Stuart manages to annoy as he lives out his affirmation of ""I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, doggone it, people like me.""  Perhaps not everyone likes him, certainly not the customer in the restaurant (an unbilled role, possibly director Harold Ramis?) who has to wait while Stuart explains his latest predicament to his best friend and Al-Anon sponsor Julia, wonderfully played by Laura San Giacomo.From there, it is a constant back-and-forth for Stuart between Chicago, where he lives, and Minneapolis, ironically one of the chief centers of recovery programs, and the home of his very dysfunctional family.  Stuart's beloved Aunt Paula has died, setting in motion an ever-muddier chain of events that eventually teach Stuart in a big way that the only one he really has the power to change is himself.  Nevertheless, the ever-optimistic Stuart continues to offer his gifts to others, some of which are eventually picked up and appreciated.Just as the setting goes back and forth from Chicago to Minneapolis, so the time frame goes back and forth from the present to the past through black-and-white flashbacks, some happy, some less so.  These give us some idea of how Stuart has come to be the way he is today, and of the ghosts that he has to grapple with while living out his affirmation.The film does take a rather serious turn near the end, but Al Franken as Stuart Smalley helps to keep the tone somewhat light during this section.  And, as in real life, not all the loose ends ever get neatly tied up, but Stuart has nevertheless made his impact, as we see in a very heartwarming ending.While most of the actors in the film are not household names, a number of them are quite experienced and turn in some memorable performances.  Harris Yulin, Shirley Knight, Lesley Boone and Vincent d'Onofrio are all good as Stuart's family members, the men in particular.  There are also a number of memorable cameos, particularly Julia Sweeney as the constantly apologizing Mea C., and Walter Olkewicz and Jeremy Roberts as the Skoag brothers who try to force the teetotaling Stuart to drink beer at a bar.The music is fun also, beginning with the codependent song that is played during the opening credits.  And it was great to hear Ethel Merman blasting her way through ""Everything's Coming Up Roses,"" during one of the scenes where Stuart is trying to pull himself up by his bootstraps.This picture has some of the funniest lines I have ever heard in any film.  My particular favorite is Stuart's brother Donnie's attempt to define for him what an ""easement"" is, despite the fact that he obviously doesn't have the slightest notion.  But many will like even better Stuart's comment to his sister about the pound cake.  While there is plenty here for audiences in general to laugh at, there are also a number of jokes that are targeted toward members of 12-step programs, and especially those programs geared toward helping friends and family members of those addicted to alcohol and drugs.  It's obvious from the writing that these are topics near and dear to screenwriter Franken's heart.So, I recommend this movie with just the caveat that you will find it funnier and closer to home if you have some familiarity with the programs that the film gently pokes fun at.  And even if you don't, after seeing the film you may still wind up with a new approach to life.",5,"He doesn't really save his family, but...",1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,4685,"['Sadly', 'lot', 'folks', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'little', 'gem', 'had', 'very', 'short', 'theatrical', 'release', 'been', 'gaining', 'wider', 'audience', 'largely', 'members', '12-step', 'programs', 'various', 'video', 'releases.To', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'sell', 'short', 'premise', ""n't"", 'sound', 'would', 'lend', 'such', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'film', 'grabs', 'one', 'attention', 'very', 'beginning', 'montage', '50s', '60s', 'family', 'photographs', 'opening', 'credits', 'Are', 'possibly', 'family', 'photos', 'lead', 'actors', 'earlier', 'stage', 'life', 'When', 'Vincent', ""d'Onofrio"", 'name', 'screen', 'guy', 'photo', 'awful', 'lot', 'then', ""'re"", 'running', 'Stuart', 'telling', 'television', 'show', 'just', 'received', 'sweater', 'one', 'Melissa', 'D.', 'knitted', 'Melissa', 'recovering', 'sex', 'addict', 'knitting', 'sweater', 'gave', 'something', 'do', 'hands', 'point', 'pace', 'only', 'rarely', 'are', 'introduced', 'Stuart', 'various', 'friends', 'nemeses', 'beginning', 'Roz', 'Weinstock', 'very', 'possibly', 'meanest', 'most', 'sadistic', 'boss', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'deliciously', 'played', 'Camille', 'Saviola', 'Roz', 'fired', 'Stuart', 'maligning', 'air', 'only', 'first', 'series', 'people', 'Stuart', 'annoy', 'out', 'affirmation', ""'m"", 'good', 'enough', ""'m"", 'smart', 'enough', 'doggone', 'people', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'everyone', 'certainly', 'not', 'customer', 'restaurant', 'unbilled', 'role', 'possibly', 'director', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'who', 'wait', 'Stuart', 'latest', 'predicament', 'best', 'friend', 'Al-Anon', 'sponsor', 'Julia', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo.From', 'there', 'constant', 'back-and-forth', 'Stuart', 'Chicago', 'where', 'Minneapolis', 'ironically', 'one', 'chief', 'centers', 'recovery', 'programs', 'home', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Stuart', 'beloved', 'Aunt', 'Paula', 'died', 'setting', 'motion', 'ever-muddier', 'chain', 'events', 'eventually', 'teach', 'Stuart', 'big', 'way', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'power', 'change', 'Nevertheless', 'ever-optimistic', 'Stuart', 'offer', 'gifts', 'others', 'are', 'eventually', 'picked', 'up', 'appreciated.Just', 'setting', 'back', 'forth', 'Chicago', 'Minneapolis', 'time', 'frame', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'past', 'black-and-white', 'flashbacks', 'happy', 'less', 'so', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'Stuart', 'come', 'be', 'way', 'today', 'ghosts', 'grapple', 'living', 'out', 'affirmation.The', 'film', 'take', 'rather', 'serious', 'turn', 'end', 'Al', 'Franken', 'Stuart', 'Smalley', 'keep', 'tone', 'somewhat', 'light', 'section', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'loose', 'ends', 'ever', 'get', 'neatly', 'tied', 'up', 'Stuart', 'nevertheless', 'made', 'impact', 'see', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'most', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'household', 'names', 'number', 'are', 'quite', 'experienced', 'turn', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'Lesley', 'Boone', 'Vincent', ""d'Onofrio"", 'are', 'all', 'good', 'Stuart', 'family', 'members', 'men', 'particular', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'memorable', 'cameos', 'particularly', 'Julia', 'Sweeney', 'constantly', 'apologizing', 'Mea', 'C.', 'Walter', 'Olkewicz', 'Jeremy', 'Roberts', 'Skoag', 'brothers', 'who', 'try', 'force', 'teetotaling', 'Stuart', 'drink', 'beer', 'bar.The', 'music', 'fun', 'also', 'beginning', 'codependent', 'song', 'played', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'great', 'hear', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'blasting', 'way', 'Everything', 'Coming', 'Up', 'Roses', 'one', 'scenes', 'where', 'Stuart', 'trying', 'pull', 'up', 'bootstraps.This', 'picture', 'funniest', 'lines', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'film', 'particular', 'favorite', 'Stuart', 'brother', 'Donnie', 'attempt', 'define', 'what', 'easement', 'fact', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'have', 'slightest', 'notion', 'many', 'will', 'like', 'even', 'better', 'Stuart', 'comment', 'sister', 'pound', 'cake', 'plenty', 'here', 'audiences', 'general', 'laugh', 'are', 'also', 'number', 'jokes', 'are', 'targeted', 'members', '12-step', 'programs', 'especially', 'programs', 'geared', 'helping', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'addicted', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'obvious', 'writing', 'are', 'topics', 'dear', 'screenwriter', 'Franken', 'heart.So', 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'caveat', 'will', 'find', 'funnier', 'closer', 'home', 'have', 'familiarity', 'programs', 'film', 'gently', 'fun', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'film', 'may', 'still', 'wind', 'up', 'new', 'approach', 'life']",Stuart Saves His Family VHS

It ran at midnight, and I stayed up to watch and record it purely because I knew Vincent D'Onofrio was in it. I wasn't expecting anything startling, but I was pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable it turned out to be.Al Franken was very watchable in the role of Stuart Smalley - the (mostly) positive title character who goes on a journey of discovery and learns that despite his best efforts and intentions, the only person he has the power to save is himself.Laura san Giacomo was pleasant in the role of Stuart's sponsor and friend and my main reason for watching, Vincent D'Onofrio, made the experience well worth depriving myself of sleep.While the film deals with some serious issues in the midst of the steady comic overtones, it doesn't shove it hard into your face. And while it's clear that Stuart isn't going to succeed in everything he attempts (his father is far too content with the way he is to want to change, even with the threat of jail hanging over his head), there are some small successes that make it worth the effort.The most touchings part of the movie (for me, at least) is Stuart's reconciliation with his older brother, Donnie (played by D'Onofrio).

It's more of a drama where  Stuart tries to save the people he loves the least: members of his family.  In the skits, he is irratating and annoying. But in this movie, the viewer  will respect him more as a sensitive human being who needs a friend like  anyone else. And we find out that he has friends that you can't just find  in any old 12 step program. They are loyal and understand him. Especially  Julia. She doesn't pre-judge him. Everything Stuart goes through, she goes  through it with him. Everyone deserves a soulmate like that. You also feel  for what Stuart is being put through by his family. Stuart is human (with  some minor considerations) just like the rest of us. This movie helped me  get through the rough times I had in my family. It is also probably the  first SNL movie with an ending that can bring one to tears. It's okay  though. The mark of a good movie is in the the ending. Stick around during  the credits to listen to the music. There is a song on there called  &quot;What Makes A Family&quot;.

Granted, it is funny in spots,and there are some excellent performances by all members of his family, especially Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother. The strange thing is, now this movie is also an excellent example of how alcoholism can tear apart a family. I know what you're think, how is this funny? If you remember the Stuart Smalley bit that Al Franken did on SNL, that routine is used as just a rough framework for the movie. The real story of the movie is how Stuart deals with the alcoholism that is slowly (and literally) killing his brother and his father. This movie portrays alcohol addiction probably better than most movies that start out to seriously portray this addiction but then inevitably get sidetracked by smarmy soap opera-ish subplots. Stuart is himself a mental wreck and then to have him thrown into the fray whereas he has to try to save everyone in his family makes for a fairly interesting, and sometimes quite funny, movie.
