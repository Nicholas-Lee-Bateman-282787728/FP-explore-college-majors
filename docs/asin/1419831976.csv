It's an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash-ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitchhikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in ""love"" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick.I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. It's obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place.

At first I wondered why I never saw it, but then realized that I was in the Air Force and overseas when it was released (1973). I read about the hippie generation and all of the protests that were going on here in the U.S. This movie gave me insight into that time from a different perspective. Still, a sexual relationship between a 54 year old man (William Holden) and a 19 year old girl (Kay Lenz) is a bit over the top and one certainly doomed to fail. This movie shows how wrong it is and makes me wonder how such a thing could happen in real life? I love this movie in that it takes me back to that time and place, and yet makes me wonder how such a thing could ever happen in real life. The difference in their ages and maturity should ensure that this type of thing should and would never happen.

175982,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,1419831976,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[3, 3]","For years I have read about the 1973 film ""Breezy."" It was considered a peculiar directorial choice by superstar Clint Eastwood, his first effort solely behind the camera (and his third followingPlay Misty For Me (1971)andHigh Plains Drifter). Knowing what we do today about Eastwood's directing talents, perhaps it's not such a surprise. ""Breezy,"" a box office bomb and practically forgotten, was one of the first clues Eastwood was something more than an action star.A small film made for $750,000, it is a surprisingly tender romance between 50-something executive Frank Harmon (William Holden) and Breezy (Kay Lenz), a teenage homeless hippie chick. Eastwood has said ""Breezy"" was one of his proudest achievements. It was an audacious effort from a man most famous forDirty Harry. WhileHarold and Maudedabbled with the taboo of an old woman and young man having a sexual affair, it did so through dark comedy. ""Breezy"" plays it straight.It is perhaps an implausible love story, though the film goes to great efforts to convey a certain serendipity of things falling into place. Holden's performance as Harmon is a wonder, and you forget what a great actor he was. We are familiar with his Oscar-winning role inStalag 17and his explosive performances inThe Wild BunchandNetwork. Holden's earnest work in ""Breezy"" was arguably some of the best of his career.Holden the ""Golden Boy"" (Growing Up with William Holden: A Memoir) was one of the most attractive movie stars in history, with chiseled features, natural charisma and athletic physique. I think the character of Harmon was very close to him in spirit, a reclusive loner burned out by the frustrations of life. Harmon is divorced, living alone in an expansive house in the Hollywood hills. By day he sells real estate and by night drinks too much while involved in passionless affairs. His best years are behind him as we see his aged facade in weathered closeups. ""Breezy"" details that while Holden/Harmon lost his youth many years ago, he still has some spark, at one point hopping over a tennis net. So the shadows of a once redoubtable allure are still there.Lenz does a great job as Breezy, a role which garnered her a Golden Globe nomination. She's a fast talker, hitchhiking across Los Angeles with a guitar strapped to her back. Adorned in bell bottoms and fringe jackets, she ends up on Harmon's property by chance and he's forced to give her a ride into town. So begins a series of misadventures culminating with Breezy staying in Harmon's guest bedroom. Their unique relationship initially is father-daughter, but Breezy senses Harmon is a deeply wounded man symbolized by the scene where they find an injured dog on the side of the road.I'm not sure in the entire history of hippiedom there was ever a girl quite like Breezy. She's street smart, yet innocent. She has a crash pad of friends, but does not follow their lead in doing drugs. She hasn't taken a bath in days, yet looks fresh as a daisy. One could misread this film as a middle-aged male sex fantasy, and certainly Eastwood was in his 40s at the time. Many female critics, most famously Judith Crist (Judith Crist's TV guide to the movies.), were not kind in their reviews. It's a tough, if not brave, dynamic to tackle, though Breezy's revelations about her parents dying five years before may offer clues as to her interest in Harmon, not to mention her homeless travels.The scene where Harmon and Breezy consummate their attraction is tastefully done, equal parts gentle and erotic as they quietly embrace within the comfort of shadows. Eventually they are playing on the beach and Harmon is buying her new clothes, an intentional reversal of the scene many years ago when Gloria Swanson purchased Holden a stylish wardrobe inSunset Boulevard. It's doubtful this relationship could last very long, and Harmon admits as much. But as a wise soul once said, ""The only thing that surprises me is the people other people fall in love with."" A sweet time capsule of an era long gone.",4,The shadows of a once redoubtable allure...,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,4012,"['years', 'have', 'read', '1973', 'film', 'Breezy', 'was', 'considered', 'peculiar', 'directorial', 'choice', 'superstar', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'effort', 'solely', 'camera', 'third', 'followingPlay', 'Misty', 'Me', '1971', 'andHigh', 'Plains', 'Drifter', 'Knowing', 'what', 'do', 'today', 'Eastwood', 'directing', 'talents', 'perhaps', 'not', 'such', 'surprise', 'Breezy', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'practically', 'forgotten', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'clues', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'something', 'more', 'action', 'star.A', 'small', 'film', 'made', '750,000', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'romance', '50-something', 'executive', 'Frank', 'Harmon', 'William', 'Holden', 'Breezy', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'teenage', 'homeless', 'hippie', 'chick', 'Eastwood', 'said', 'Breezy', 'was', 'one', 'proudest', 'achievements', 'was', 'audacious', 'effort', 'man', 'most', 'famous', 'forDirty', 'Harry', 'WhileHarold', 'Maudedabbled', 'taboo', 'old', 'woman', 'young', 'man', 'having', 'sexual', 'affair', 'did', 'so', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Breezy', 'straight.It', 'perhaps', 'implausible', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'great', 'efforts', 'convey', 'certain', 'serendipity', 'things', 'falling', 'place', 'Holden', 'performance', 'Harmon', 'wonder', 'forget', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'are', 'familiar', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'inStalag', '17and', 'explosive', 'performances', 'inThe', 'Wild', 'BunchandNetwork', 'Holden', 'earnest', 'work', 'Breezy', 'was', 'arguably', 'best', 'career.Holden', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'Growing', 'Up', 'William', 'Holden', 'Memoir', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'attractive', 'movie', 'stars', 'history', 'chiseled', 'features', 'natural', 'charisma', 'athletic', 'physique', 'think', 'character', 'Harmon', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'spirit', 'reclusive', 'loner', 'burned', 'out', 'frustrations', 'life', 'Harmon', 'divorced', 'living', 'alone', 'expansive', 'house', 'Hollywood', 'hills', 'day', 'real', 'estate', 'night', 'drinks', 'too', 'much', 'involved', 'passionless', 'affairs', 'best', 'years', 'are', 'behind', 'see', 'aged', 'facade', 'weathered', 'closeups', 'Breezy', 'details', 'Holden/Harmon', 'lost', 'youth', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'spark', 'one', 'point', 'hopping', 'tennis', 'net', 'shadows', 'once', 'redoubtable', 'allure', 'are', 'still', 'there.Lenz', 'great', 'job', 'Breezy', 'role', 'garnered', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'fast', 'talker', 'hitchhiking', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'guitar', 'strapped', 'back', 'Adorned', 'bell', 'bottoms', 'fringe', 'jackets', 'up', 'Harmon', 'property', 'chance', 'forced', 'give', 'ride', 'town', 'So', 'series', 'misadventures', 'culminating', 'Breezy', 'staying', 'Harmon', 'guest', 'bedroom', 'unique', 'relationship', 'initially', 'father-daughter', 'Breezy', 'Harmon', 'deeply', 'wounded', 'man', 'symbolized', 'scene', 'where', 'find', 'injured', 'dog', 'side', 'road.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'entire', 'history', 'hippiedom', 'was', 'ever', 'girl', 'quite', 'Breezy', 'street', 'smart', 'yet', 'innocent', 'crash', 'pad', 'friends', 'not', 'follow', 'lead', 'doing', 'drugs', ""n't"", 'taken', 'bath', 'days', 'yet', 'fresh', 'daisy', 'One', 'could', 'misread', 'film', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'sex', 'fantasy', 'certainly', 'Eastwood', 'was', '40s', 'time', 'Many', 'female', 'critics', 'most', 'famously', 'Judith', 'Crist', 'Judith', 'Crist', 'TV', 'guide', 'movies', 'were', 'not', 'kind', 'reviews', 'tough', 'not', 'brave', 'dynamic', 'tackle', 'Breezy', 'revelations', 'parents', 'dying', 'five', 'years', 'before', 'may', 'offer', 'clues', 'interest', 'Harmon', 'not', 'mention', 'homeless', 'travels.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Harmon', 'Breezy', 'consummate', 'attraction', 'tastefully', 'done', 'equal', 'parts', 'gentle', 'erotic', 'quietly', 'embrace', 'comfort', 'shadows', 'Eventually', 'are', 'playing', 'beach', 'Harmon', 'buying', 'new', 'clothes', 'intentional', 'reversal', 'scene', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'purchased', 'Holden', 'stylish', 'wardrobe', 'inSunset', 'Boulevard', 'doubtful', 'relationship', 'could', 'last', 'very', 'long', 'Harmon', 'as', 'much', 'wise', 'soul', 'once', 'said', 'only', 'thing', 'people', 'other', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'sweet', 'time', 'capsule', 'era', 'long', 'gone']",N/A

The legendary William Holden portrays his characters middle age angst to perfection. Kay Lenz is perfectly cast as the young free spirit. Both do a fantastic job with their roles. This movie has something for everyone. A little humor, romance, drama. Its also does an excellent job of capturing the vibe of California in the early 1970's. It would appear that most scenes are shot on location. Very few if any scenes appear to be shot on a sound stage.

It's directed by Clint Eastwood, and it stars William Holden as a burnt out, middle aged man who hooks up with Kay Lenz, a young hippie girl.  It sounds like a disaster on paper, but Clint really makes it work.  The performances are sincere, the location shooting wonderful, and it has a lot of real life in it, so it doesn't feel like a Hollywood movie.  Holden gives a very good performance in the twilight of his career.  Most of old Hollywood had a difficult time in the 1970's finding decent work after the studio system fell apart, both actors, actresses, and directors, but Holden somehow managed to make the transition quite well and kept his dignity in tact.  Many old Hollywood stars had to star in 2nd and 3rd rate films (disaster films were big refuges for old Hollywood stars eager to keep working), but Holden didn't resort to that.  Here he is excellent, and Kay Lenz is quite good.  In the hands of a lesser director, this could have been a cheesy soap opera, overly sentimentalised made for Oxygen TV type of movie.  Luckily, Breezy is directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the greatest filmmakers working today (and one of the greatest working back then too).  While the film does have a little cheese, it's not enough to negate the whole movie, and it's an excellent, obscure film in the Clint Eastwood filmography.",4,Obscure little gem from our friend Clint Eastwood....,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,1440,"['rather', 'obscure', 'film', 'shame', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'really', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'William', 'Holden', 'burnt', 'out', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'young', 'hippie', 'girl', 'disaster', 'paper', 'Clint', 'really', 'work', 'performances', 'are', 'sincere', 'location', 'shooting', 'wonderful', 'lot', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Holden', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'twilight', 'career', 'Most', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', '1970', 'finding', 'decent', 'work', 'studio', 'system', 'fell', 'apart', 'actors', 'actresses', 'directors', 'Holden', 'somehow', 'managed', 'make', 'transition', 'quite', 'well', 'kept', 'dignity', 'tact', 'Many', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'had', 'star', '2nd', '3rd', 'rate', 'films', 'disaster', 'films', 'were', 'big', 'refuges', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'eager', 'keep', 'working', 'Holden', 'did', ""n't"", 'resort', 'Here', 'excellent', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'quite', 'good', 'hands', 'lesser', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cheesy', 'soap', 'opera', 'overly', 'sentimentalised', 'made', 'Oxygen', 'TV', 'type', 'movie', 'Luckily', 'Breezy', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'working', 'today', 'one', 'greatest', 'working', 'back', 'then', 'too', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'cheese', 'not', 'enough', 'negate', 'whole', 'movie', 'excellent', 'obscure', 'film', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'filmography']",N/A

William Holden's ""Frank"", is a ""middle-aged"" (more like almost 60!)is complete stick-in-the-mud divorced realtor who sells beautiful SoCal homes for well under 100K. Frank is void of personality and the most droll real estate agent I've ever witnessed, he talks nothing about the property, only the prices and appears to all around him  an unsmiling drip of a man.SURPRISE! Breezy meets Frank through a chance encounter and suddenly the Breeze breaks down Frankies defenses and gets him to ""take off his tie"" and eat cotton candy and eventually bed this young Breezy girl who must have some daddy/sex  issues to work out. But can they make this relationship  work out with their age differences and lifestyle conflicts? The gimpy middle aged women who would pay to see this dreck before cable and Lifetime Channel came out will be satisfied that they do in fact, work it out.  The film ends with the time worn reunion couples-walk off camera while sharing amusing chatter to the recurring background music that plagues ""Breezy"".Kay Lenz was maybe all of 20 when this was made and she has a likable smile and demeanor. WIlliam Holden was old enough to know better and is painful to watch. If you are a fan of 70's cinema, there are a few interesting throwbacks that make ""Breezy"" just a little better than watching the Jewelry Channel. Personally I had more fun clowning this movie- waiting for Breezy's friends ""Charley and Squeaky"" to appear, hoping for a ""subplot involving hard dope or STD's"".

In this latter production Holden has multiple prolems. His marriage has ended in divorce. He satiates his needs with ""one nighters"". He's a ""Babbitt"" in a time and area of non conformity. He's a hopeless cynic, unable to understand why the world doesn't act the way he wants it. Enter Breezy,a Pennsylvania runaway, the type Holden knows well in his job as a real estate agent. Enter more problems. Breezy genuinely likes/loves him despite a 30+year age difference. The duet has absolutely nothing in common except in the bedroom. Right up to story's end, Holden can't fathom why a 20 year old girl could love him, especially when he doesn't even like himself. ""Breezy"" is exactly what the title implies. It's a nice way to spend a couple of hours.The seventies were not particularly a good time for ageing actors, but William Holden held up fairly well in ""The Blue Knight"",""Network"", and ""Breezy"". In this latter effort, Holden has multiple problems: a divorce that he has pushed in a battle of wills, a midlife crisis which he satiates with ""one nighters"",""babbitry"" in an area and time of non conformity, and a deep rooted cynicism seemingly based on a world not conforming to anything, much less his evpectations. Elton John? What a stupid name for a ""crapper""! Enter Breezy, a type  which he knows well as a real estate agent. Enter another problem. A relationship with a drifter from Pennsylvania, certainly old enough to be his daughter. The couple obviously has nothing in common save for the bedroom, which can also be mystifying to any man who has little self esteem and, almost to the end,simply cannot fathom why anyone would like him, much less love him.

A poorly planned, and almost non existant marketing campaign certainly didn't help matters. In fact, Universal had already delayed the release of the film for over a year because of early negative critical reaction.An unfortunate casualty of Breezy's failure, was the film career of Kay Lenz. At only 19 years old, she was not only a beautiful young woman, but a fine actress as well. What should have been a launching pad to stardom, simply became a detour to low-budget film work, and guest starring roles on TV. While many critics seem to focus on the directing skills of Clint Eastwood, or the wonderful acting of William Holden, it's Kay Lenz who is the heart and true ""star"" of Breezy. She was nominated for a Golden Globe (Most Promising Newcomer - Female) for her performance.Deceptively simple in its approach, Breezy is a wonderfully rich film about relationships and LOVE. Not just the love between two people, but a love for LIFE itself.JMFootnotes;The original runtime of the film was 108 minutes. This DVD release is 106 minutes.Breezy is often confused with 1974's ""Ginger in the Morning"" starring Sissy Spacek.Fans of the TV series ""LOST"", might find it interesting that in season 4, the Philip K.

At first I thought it was one of those typical, youth culture exploitation films (which I love!) from the '60s & '70s. Instead, I found myself engrossed in what turned out to be a small, touching dram-ady about a young girl, who helps an older man learn to love and care again.In this 1973 film, we meet Frank Harmon (an excellent, William Holden) a well to do, middle-aged, real-estate agent. He is a tired, cynical, emotionally burned out shell of a man, who has a nasty divorce in his past. He seems content with burying himself in his work, meaningless one night stands and being a single, among middle-aged couples. But that is about to change. Into his life, semi-accidentally comes, Edith Alice Breezerman AKA 'Breezy'. Breezy (Kay Lenz) is a 19 year old hippie girl, who seems to just get by in life with her wits, beautiful smile and her pollyan-ish view to always see the good in people. At first Frank resists this pretty girl, who is young enough to be his daughter and his complete polar opposite. But little by little, Breezy seems to slowly break a hole in the emotional wall, that Frank has built around himself. He starts to actually love and care about someone other than himself. Conversly, Frank must also deal with the attitudes and views of his middle-age friends and collegues about his new May-December relationship. Will their love survive?This really is a wonderful, small film about learning to love again. It is among Clint Eastwood's early directorial efforts and he does a quite remarkable job of creating an emotional love story (the opposite of the'70s action flicks, he was more well known for starring in at the time). Jo Heim's script is very smart and witty. While the above plot synoposis might sound a bit 'heavy', this film actually has some light, rather funny moments satirizing the attitudes of both the young and older generations and espousing the ideal, that you are only as old as you feel inside.The cast of this film is wonderful. William Holden is an expert at playing a stick in the mud, curmudgeon. He really shows us a man who is emotionally closed off, but who eventually reveals his true self. Its a remarkable performance. In the title role is Kay Lenz as Breezy. Her line readings are sometimes flat and rather wooden, but that really dosn't matter. This young actress has a rather charismatic persona, that really does light up the scenes she's in. I think this works with this character and shows us why this girl is so appealing to this man. Together, Holden and Lenz do have some very good chemistry together and that's what makes their romance so believable. Kudos should also go to Roger C.

175996,A30TK6U7DNS82R,1419831976,Kevin Killian,"[7, 8]","BREEZY beats most of Clint Eastwood's present-day output by a country mile, for it has no pretensions to being anything other than what it is, and plus in hindsight it is, oddly enough, one of the movies that best tells it like it was about hippie culture.  The things that seemed ""off"" about it back in the day (Michel Legrand's ""folk music"" theme, for example, repeated endlessly, even in a sitar variation) have reached a pitch of resonance today.  I for one, got ready to weep every time the orchestra seemed about to launch into the nth variation on ""Breezy's Song.""  Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote many bad lyrics in the period, but their lyric for ""Breezy's Song"" perfectly encapsulates the hippie ethos that Kay Lenz' character is supposed to embody.She is great, and another example of the strong roles for women that Eastwood seems drawn to even from the beginning.  She is so young and beautiful, nearly flawless, that it seems odd her hair is always clean like a Breck girl, even in the beginning scenes when she exclaims over William Holden's shower as though she's never seen one.  He plays Frank Harmon, a real estate agent in Laurel Canyon.  That's the weak part of the picture, Eastwood never makes Holden believable as a salesman.  He's not driven enough.  He's more laidback than the hippies on the corner.  Almost as great are the twists and turns that the screenplay makes.  On the surface a placid little mood piece, BREEZY has at least two great shocks, both taking place in hospitals, that will leave you with your jaw on the floor.  Jo Heims, who did this screenplay, was also responsible for an earlier Eastwood vehicle, the thriller PLAY MISTY FOR ME, and she knows how to throw a curveball.  Shame that she is not more widely recognized among the great screenwriters, but perhaps her tragically early death has something to do with her current eclipse.  For me, all the things people say Robert Towne does, Jo Heims really does, but backwards and in high heels.(She also wrote the Patty Duke thriller YOU'LL LIKE MY MOTHER.)Holden is good, and manages to look younger as the movie rolls on and the love of Breezy reinvigorates him.  Ultimately the movie depends on how much you can stand of Kay Lenz.  Some think she's too intense for the movie.  For others, she will seem too twee with her positivist philosophy of finding a bright spot in anything and counting on love to see her through.  Her frequent nudity is unabashed and ""natural,"" and it's great to see a woman on screen whose breasts are so very different from each other, something you hardly ever see today in Hollywood!  A wonderful bonus is the presence of Jamie Smith-Jackson as Breezy's best girlfriend, the miserably drug-addled hippie girl Marcie.  Jamie Smith-Jackson!  Cult legend of cult legends!

While definitely offbeat, this is a pleasant, beautiful little film that many people can enjoy because it does not rely on outlandish computer generated effects or gunplay,explosions,etc. Rather, it tells a story of relationships in varying degrees between several people: the main story being that of William Holden and Kay Lenz. One of the reasons I liked this movie was due to the utter professionalism of William Holden: his dialouge and style are very believable and Eastwood the director ( on his 3rd outing, not his 1st as had been stated by a reviewer from Virginia : Play Misty For Me and High Plains Drifter being his 1st and 2nd films respectively) manages to pull a rather likeable performance from newcomer Kay Lenz: you feel like you really would like to have her as a friend. The camera work is very nice with some beautiful outdoor/romantic shots and there is an amusing inside joke ( the couple attends a movie starring who else?) as well as a strong &quot; fake out twist&quot;near the end that manages to make Mr. Holden realize what is REALLY important in life. The ending I found very refreshing and surprising/amusing. The supporting cast is fine and a scene involving his ex girlfriend is particularly powerful- it will wrench your heart. Also notable is the interesting decor of the homes and clothing styles, a favorite of many people who grew up during this time and love the earlier retro/mod look. The main song that is heard at times during the film is very hummable and you will like it. In summary, this is a small gem of a film. You can feel the intelligence behind it and just know that Eastwood was destined to do great things in directing as well as acting.It has many things going for it and I would have to respectively disagree with the reviewer from Virginia that didn't like the film: he/she went way out of their way to malign it with a level of venom that was puzzling.

Kreca ""mkreca@earthlink.net""","[27, 28]","One of Clint Eastwood's early yet still obscure directorial efforts, ""Breezy"" gently and charmingly explores the nature of wisdom, which can be present in the most unusual of people and the real meaning of happiness, which is usually found in the oddest and least-expected of places, usually when one is not looking for it.Amid the smoldering cultural wreckage of the recently-ended 1960s with its nagging remnants of the shrill ""don't trust anyone over 30"" crowd and the seemingly still-unbridgeable ""generation gap,"" which had left many men and women from all age groups deeply confused, adrift and alienated, the odd and quirky relationship between the youthful, Ophelia-like Edith Alice ""Breezy"" Breezerman (Lenz) and the cynical, middle-aged Frank Harmon (Holden) successfully and simultaneously reveals several very simple but still frequently-ignored truths; that wisdom and insight are not necessarily the sole province of the ""aged"" and that a carefree, happy spontaneity isn't and shouldn't be automatically restricted to the ""young."" And, more subtly, we also are quietly reminded that neither wisdom nor happiness can realistically exist isolated from one another and that the bitter memories and unpleasant experiences of our own respective pasts can often tragically keep us from getting what we truly want and need the most.Like the Italian neo-realist director Sergio Leone, in whose classic ""spaghetti westerns"" the eponymous ""man with no name"" successfully toiled in the 1960s, director Eastwood slowly and deliberately unfolds the personalities of the film's characters (warts and all) but does not self-consciously over-present or stereotype them, which adds to the power, insight and poignancy of this understated and well-produced film, topical, yes, but in its own way, timeless, one head and shoulders above such glittery, simpleminded and laughably stereotypical trash like ""Pretty Woman.""",4,Wisdom & Happiness,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,1914,"['One', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'early', 'yet', 'still', 'obscure', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'Breezy', 'gently', 'charmingly', 'nature', 'wisdom', 'can', 'be', 'present', 'most', 'unusual', 'people', 'real', 'meaning', 'happiness', 'usually', 'found', 'oddest', 'least-expected', 'places', 'usually', 'when', 'one', 'not', 'looking', 'it.Amid', 'smoldering', 'cultural', 'wreckage', 'recently-ended', '1960s', 'nagging', 'remnants', 'shrill', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anyone', '30', 'crowd', 'seemingly', 'still-unbridgeable', 'generation', 'gap', 'had', 'left', 'many', 'men', 'women', 'age', 'groups', 'deeply', 'confused', 'adrift', 'alienated', 'odd', 'quirky', 'relationship', 'youthful', 'Ophelia-like', 'Edith', 'Alice', 'Breezy', 'Breezerman', 'Lenz', 'cynical', 'middle-aged', 'Frank', 'Harmon', 'Holden', 'successfully', 'simultaneously', 'reveals', 'several', 'very', 'simple', 'still', 'frequently-ignored', 'truths', 'wisdom', 'insight', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sole', 'province', 'aged', 'carefree', 'happy', 'spontaneity', ""n't"", 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'automatically', 'restricted', 'young', 'more', 'subtly', 'also', 'are', 'quietly', 'reminded', 'wisdom', 'happiness', 'can', 'realistically', 'exist', 'isolated', 'one', 'bitter', 'memories', 'unpleasant', 'experiences', 'own', 'respective', 'pasts', 'can', 'often', 'tragically', 'keep', 'getting', 'what', 'truly', 'want', 'need', 'most.Like', 'Italian', 'neo-realist', 'director', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'classic', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'eponymous', 'man', 'name', 'successfully', 'toiled', '1960s', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'slowly', 'deliberately', 'personalities', 'film', 'characters', 'warts', 'not', 'self-consciously', 'over-present', 'stereotype', 'power', 'insight', 'poignancy', 'understated', 'well-produced', 'film', 'topical', 'yes', 'own', 'way', 'timeless', 'one', 'head', 'shoulders', 'such', 'glittery', 'simpleminded', 'laughably', 'stereotypical', 'trash', 'Pretty', 'Woman']",N/A

You will absolutely love it!The story line was well edited; what I mean by this is that you never get that; ""it-can-only-happen-in-a-movie"" sense. This is what the story is about:Breezy is a young (about 18 or 19), free spirited girl who lives her life spontaneously, but deep inside is a very wise soul. She doesn't have a job or goes to college, but lives day to day and always seems to be happy. She smiles a lot and is wise enough to know that happiness is all a matter of perspective, how one chooses to interpret things and see the world. You get the sense, very early in the movie that Breezy is a genuinely good person.Frankie is an older gentleman (50s) who lives alone and doesn't feel that he needs anyone in his life. He has convinced himself that being alone is not all that bad. He is a real estate broken that owns a very nice home and seems to live a quiet life. You get the sense, early in the movie that Franky is genuinely a good person as well.Like two boats floating on the surface of a vast ocean, its currents (fate) seem to draw the two boats towards each other. You would think that judging just from surface factors, that each person has something that the other might want or need. Breezy needs a home, food and stability. Franky; companionship and love--yet the movie is about something deeper, something more genuine, something that transcends time and space and the limitations of our conditioned mind.Nothing is rushed, everything just unfolds naturally. Breezy, her innocence, her purity causes her to very quickly fall in love with Franky, whose many more years of mental conditioning causes him to put up much more of a resistance.

176011,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,1419831976,Silver Screen Videos,"[0, 0]","Clint Eastwood is accepted today as one of the best directors of our time, but he had to learn his craft just like everyone else. After helming a couple of his own films, Universal gave him the opportunity to direct ""Breezy,"" a very unlikely romance and a project that, quite likely, no one else wanted. Poorly promoted by the studio and very different from what fans of Eastwood and star William Holden were accustomed to, the film predictably flopped at the box office. That's a shame, because the movie (which Eastwood views as one of his favorites) and is quite a charming romance, despite some potentially tawdry subject matter.Simply put, ""Breezy"" is a romance between Frank, a 50-something man (Holden) and Breezy, an 18-year-old girl (Kay Lenz). He's a highly successful real estate agent who's still recovering from his wife dumping him and has pretty much shut out the world emotionally. She's about the world's most innocent hippy runaway, sweet, honest, trusting, caring, and vulnerable. After nearly being raped by a man who picks her up while she is hitch hiking, she runs away and enters Holden's house which is unlocked. She soon leaves but later comes back to get the guitar she left behind and winds up leaving and coming back several times during the course of the movie. Gradually, the two wind up falling in love.In another director's hands, this material could have been exceptionally sleazy, but Eastwood makes it seem quite natural. It's no surprise that Holden, who looks quite weather beaten, could be believable... he shows the same inner softness he displayed in a handful of scenes in ""The Wild Bunch"" hidden behind his familiar cynical exterior. Lenz, however, is quite a surprise in her first lead role, at 19. Eastwood's talent with less experienced actors comes through here, as Lenz never goes overboard in her portrayal of the innocent Breezy. The result is a romance that feels natural, with both characters realizing (Holden somewhat later than Lenz), that their relationship is not just about sex and convenience but real love.Of course, the couple's relationship is threatened when the outside world, namely Holden's friends, finds out about it. While his best friend (Roger C. Carmel) engages in good natured jealous fantasies when thinking about it, others are not as approving. The screenplay does not do Eastwood or the cast any favors here, failing to take a realistic look at the actual dynamic of the relationship. There is no discussion of possible political, religious, cultural, or any other type of differences between the characters, which might give them a better reason to reconsider what they are doing. Instead, the movie feels a bit like an R-rated version of an After School Special about tolerance.It's a tribute to Eastwood, Holden, and Lenz that viewers are willing to go along with the romance and not ask the hard questions the characters themselves never do. There is some great camera work here, especially in a shadowy sequence in which Lenz seduces Holden for the first time. The love scenes suggest the equally moving ones Eastwood would film twenty years later in ""Bridges of Madison County."" Viewers will know they are caught up in the film's charm when, by the end of the film, they no longer think of themselves watching a love story about a man and a girl young enough to be his daughter, but, simply, a love story about two lonely, likable, and needy people.",4,A Light Breeze of an Unusual Romance,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,3431,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'accepted', 'today', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'time', 'had', 'learn', 'craft', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'helming', 'couple', 'own', 'films', 'Universal', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'Breezy', 'very', 'unlikely', 'romance', 'project', 'quite', 'likely', 'one', 'else', 'wanted', 'Poorly', 'promoted', 'studio', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'fans', 'Eastwood', 'star', 'William', 'Holden', 'were', 'accustomed', 'film', 'predictably', 'flopped', 'box', 'office', 'shame', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'views', 'one', 'favorites', 'quite', 'charming', 'romance', 'potentially', 'tawdry', 'subject', 'matter.Simply', 'put', 'Breezy', 'romance', 'Frank', '50-something', 'man', 'Holden', 'Breezy', '18-year-old', 'girl', 'Kay', 'Lenz', 'highly', 'successful', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'still', 'recovering', 'wife', 'dumping', 'pretty', 'much', 'shut', 'out', 'world', 'emotionally', 'world', 'most', 'innocent', 'hippy', 'runaway', 'sweet', 'honest', 'trusting', 'caring', 'vulnerable', 'nearly', 'being', 'raped', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'hitch', 'hiking', 'away', 'enters', 'Holden', 'house', 'unlocked', 'soon', 'later', 'back', 'get', 'guitar', 'left', 'behind', 'up', 'leaving', 'coming', 'back', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'movie', 'Gradually', 'two', 'wind', 'up', 'falling', 'love.In', 'director', 'hands', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'exceptionally', 'sleazy', 'Eastwood', 'seem', 'quite', 'natural', 'surprise', 'Holden', 'who', 'quite', 'weather', 'beaten', 'could', 'be', 'believable', 'same', 'inner', 'softness', 'displayed', 'handful', 'scenes', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'hidden', 'familiar', 'cynical', 'exterior', 'Lenz', 'however', 'quite', 'surprise', 'first', 'lead', 'role', '19', 'Eastwood', 'talent', 'less', 'experienced', 'actors', 'here', 'Lenz', 'never', 'overboard', 'portrayal', 'innocent', 'Breezy', 'result', 'romance', 'natural', 'characters', 'realizing', 'Holden', 'somewhat', 'later', 'Lenz', 'relationship', 'not', 'just', 'sex', 'convenience', 'real', 'love.Of', 'course', 'couple', 'relationship', 'threatened', 'when', 'outside', 'world', 'namely', 'Holden', 'friends', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'Roger', 'C.', 'Carmel', 'good', 'natured', 'jealous', 'fantasies', 'when', 'thinking', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'approving', 'screenplay', 'not', 'do', 'Eastwood', 'cast', 'favors', 'here', 'failing', 'take', 'realistic', 'look', 'actual', 'dynamic', 'relationship', 'discussion', 'possible', 'political', 'religious', 'cultural', 'other', 'type', 'differences', 'characters', 'might', 'give', 'better', 'reason', 'reconsider', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Instead', 'movie', 'bit', 'R-rated', 'version', 'School', 'Special', 'tolerance.It', 'tribute', 'Eastwood', 'Holden', 'Lenz', 'viewers', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'romance', 'not', 'ask', 'hard', 'questions', 'characters', 'never', 'do', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'here', 'especially', 'shadowy', 'sequence', 'Lenz', 'Holden', 'first', 'time', 'love', 'suggest', 'equally', 'moving', 'ones', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'film', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'Viewers', 'will', 'know', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'film', 'charm', 'when', 'end', 'film', 'no', 'longer', 'think', 'watching', 'love', 'story', 'man', 'girl', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'daughter', 'simply', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'lonely', 'likable', 'needy', 'people']",N/A

Kay Lenz is in the starring role, as Edith Alice Breezerman (she's nicknamed Breezy, because of her devil-may-care attitude). Breezy is a carefree young woman, who has hippie values. She drifts around, with no possessions except her guitar, and the clothes on her back.Breezy has no family, because her folks were killed in an accident. She indulges in casual sex, with a guy she barely knows. And she takes shelter, where ever she can find a place to crash. One day while hitchhiking, Breezy accepts a ride from a man who turns out to be deranged. She barely manages to escape unharmed, from this creepy guy.Breezy's next ride, is with a middle-aged, affluent man named Frank Harmon. Despite Frank's reservations, he gives Breezy a ride. With no where else to go, Breezy later shows up at Frank's extravagant house. Frank reluctantly takes her in, feeds her, and lets her stay with him for a while. Frank and Breezy, have to adjust to each other's very different lifestyles, and outlook on life. Soon enough, Breezy becomes angry about Frank's judgmental attitude towards her. So she leaves his place, but then comes back to him after a short while.Bit by bit, Breezy manages to charm the cynical Frank, with her happy-go-lucky disposition. She quickly becomes infatuated with Frank, who gradually succumbs to a growing sexual attraction between them. Because Frank is more than twice Breezy's age, he feels increasingly uncomfortable, with their erotic involvement. And so, he must decide if their affair should continue or not.Kay Lenz is very believable, as the baby-faced, waifish Breezy. William Holden plays the up-tight, world-weary Frank, with a dignified sensitivity. The rest of the cast, is mediocre at best. The southern California scenery in this film, is gorgeous. And it certainly ads to the lush, romantic tone of this film.The basic lesson of this film, is that life and love are to be enjoyed, without inhibitions or regret. And it was a valuable lesson, that the young taught their elders back in the 70s, when this movie was made. Just goes to show, that you're never too old to learn new ways of living and being.

A 50 plus well-to-do business guy with a 19-year-old hippie drifter? Not necessarily uncommon but in this film the girl's not in it for the money and the guy's not in it for the sex. They genuinely love and cherish each other, and strangely, this is the element of controversy.William Holden plays Frank, a cynical divorced real estate broker who lives by himself with only a series of uncommitted relationships for companionship and a mental rulebook that precludes serious involvement. He is  surrounded by like-minded cynics that all want for something they have long since given up on . . . youth. Not so much in chronological terms, but more in attitude and that sense of wonder about life. Breezy is the very embodiment of that sense of wonder, and despite her 19 years, possesses a wisdom that cuts through the cynical disillusionment of Frank, who unlike what you'd expect, never makes a sexual advance toward the younger girl, even though she's very attractive and probably willing. For her part, Breezy recognized the sensitive soul that Frank has taken pains to suppress and confounds his suspicions by giving of herself to him without asking for anything in return. When he eventually gives in to his feelings, the age difference becomes irrelevant, but Breezy and Frank do not exist in a vacuum and the outside world eventually fills his head with doubt. His best friend, while being envious of the ""zing "" Breezy has put into Frank's life, laments thus: ""Why should a young girl like that love an old fart like me? I'd be a meal ticket for her and nothing more."" And even if it could be more, ""where could I go with her without feeling like a child molester?"" And so Frank smolders in a crisis of perception that already had been countered by Breezy in an earlier scene. ""Is that how it is Frankie? Do you start believing what you see in the mirror and forget about what you feel inside? Do you stop feeling because the outside of you makes it seem foolish? Does becoming older mean feeling foolish? What's there to look forward to if you can't go on loving and being loved?""

Holden pushes her repeated advances away, until he finally realizes she has a beautiful heart and falls in love with Lenz's ""inner beauty.""  Remarkably, the actors are good enough to make this unlikely tale believable.Contrary to one of the other reviewers, the Holden character is not dying of anything.  However, he jilts a thirtysomething woman who truly loves him, after which she marries another man, after which that man shortly dies in a car accident.  From her hospital bed, the woman tells Holden that ""life is short"" and to accept love whenever he finds it, from wherever it comes.This woman's advice, and Lenz's generosity and forgiving sprit to a friend who stole her guitar, convince Holden that Lenz has a good heart and that he should accept her love.That a 17-year-old hippie girl would fall head-over-heels in love -- and so fast! -- with a crumageonly fiftysomething square is a nice fantasy for crumageonly middle-aged men.

I do not know if or what awards this film got but Eastwood, Holden, Lenz and the story ""Breezy"" all should have gotten Oscars.It shows so clearly and with great dialogue, excellent humor and honesty about how some stupid things in our culture and some prejudices can tear others down and make a sadder world...even destroy love between two who find this amazingly rare thing in life...BUT, the prejudice and judging others and terrible narrow minded people did not win in this movie.Thank you Clint for having it end the way it did...no sadness or evil winning this time.
