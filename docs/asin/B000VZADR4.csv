First of all it was more J-Ho than Marc- wasn't the movie about Hector? That and the ignorant accents used by Marc and JHo while they were impressive- that they could pull them off that is- annoyed me immensely- and I could see why there existence but they weren't really necessary. Also, the dialogue makes Puerto Ricans seem as if they have a lack of intelligence. This is a bad representation above all and is a negative portrayal of Hectors character- it might be accurate but it makes him seem deficient in many ways no wonder his and friends and family didn't support it. Some of you guys are too ethnocentric. Save ur money and buy this used.*This is an edit- I saved this movie to show it to my Grandma (I showed it to four other people also) and was shocked to discover that it didn't have Spanish dubbing. I was thus unable to show it to her for she wouldn't understand. This makes this movie even more of a shame. I would have rated it a 2 if I noticed this sooner. I have never watched a Hollywood released CD that didn't have a Spanish version- they're all usually English, Spanish and French. Its very ironic that this movie based on Hispanic personas, with Hispanic actors and depicting a story of a certain generation (many peole of this generation who are still alive today do not speak the English language) would lack this. Its also a shame that with Jho and Marc as the main attractions this deficit wasn't addressed. Tisk!",3,Why the high ratings?

1105730,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B000VZADR4,Fernando,"[3, 4]","I am not a J-Lopez fan, not much of today's salsa fan and I consider Mark Anthony a great salsa singer but only a tepid actor. Having established that, I love '70s salsa (salsa that you could dance AND listen to) and grew up listening to Hector Lavoe. After watching this movie I realized that I had in fact caught -quite by accident- perhaps the last radio interview Lavoe gave before he died in the early `90s. None of the drama here got was even hinted at during that radio interview and the movie explains why.J-Lopez is by far the most over-rated celebrity ever but in this movie she gives an unimpeachable performance, she's solid. In the first two minutes she draws you in and the movie manages to show her different sides, inconsistencies and develops her into a complex character. Mark Anthony earns his money too; he's funny and introspective. Director Leon Ichaso is hit-and-miss in recreating the characters' torrid relationship but made a beautifully artsy movie; it was good to FINALLY see a director using the palate of Caribbean colors to full effect in film.There are a few duds in El Cantante though, and they cost it a few stars.1) The film runs longer than it needs to; after a while it begins to rehash and overkill the points it's trying to make.2) ""Puchi"" (Lopez) is supposed to be a feisty yet uneducated girl from the barrio but her dialogue is often above her experience, as if she had years of therapy and has all kinds of insights to share. I loved her part of the script but it is above the experience the character is supposed to have had.3) The use of fragmented scenes bespeaks of Lavoe's losing sight of reality through drug use, but it is overdone and sometimes without clear purpose. It also runs -inexplicably- throughout the movie, not just after Lavoe's first use of hard drugs.4) Lavoe sang a lot about social issues (i.e. ""Juanito Alimana"") but this gets no mention in the movie.5) Anthony is a great salsa singer in his own right but his sounds NOTHING like Lavoe's nasally/throaty voice. Either sing like him or dub someone who does.6) One is led to believe that Lavoe's partner, Willie Colon, faded into obscurity after leaving the combo. In fact, Colon hooked-up with Ruben Blades and became even more famous than Lavoe ever was. He then went solo and recorded his own songs. I confess I didn't even know Lavoe and Colon had collaborated so closely originally, since Blades/Colon were THE legendary duo, recording perhaps the most famous salsa classics together. This movie was made not because Lavoe was the most famous salsa singer but because of the tragedies in his life.7) Salsa does get overplayed in the movie. Yes, it sets the mood but this is supposed to be a drama, not 1/4 music video. A nitpicky aspect is that while the wardrobe is exquisitely adapted to the '70s and '80s, many of the salsa dance moves are blatantly contemporary. This won't be lost on anyone who dances salsa.I have traveled a lot and from South Africa to London to Moscow to Japan, salsa is danced in ballrooms everywhere. For crying out loud, there was even a salsa combo in the early '90s of Japanese musicians (""La Orquesta de la Luz"") who sang salsa in Spanish! This movie is about how that revolution started and how one of its most prominent singers became a victim of his own success.A very solid 3 1/2 stars, finally an American-Latin movie with nuance (not many of those) but with a little way to go still.

But now that the film is available for DVD viewing in the home, the public can appreciate the very fine qualities of this surprise work.  And it may not be too late for an Oscar nod for Jennifer Lopez...The film is based on the life of Hector Lavoe (Marc Anthony), the Puerto Rican King of Salsa who gained fame and stardom in the 1970s and 1980s as not only a talented singer but also as a charismatic 'man of the people'.  His rise to fame is related in a tremendously effective black and white late in life interview with Hector's wife Puchi (a brilliant role for Jennifer Lopez!) offering in flashback sequences the rise and fall of the King of Salsa, a life cut short by both drug abuse and AIDS.  Much of the film is devoted to musical sequences that bristle with the excitement of Salsa music and Anthony carries his role as Lavoe very well.  The cast is uniformly excellent with some fine new faces.  Write/director Leon Ichaso lets the drama slip a bit in favor of the music, but still the performance of Jennifer Lopez as the smart but sleazy, tacky and wise Puchi is dynamite.  The film is far more solid than expected: the opportunity for Lopez to demonstrate her talent is well worth watching.

It is tough to watch people on the screen for 2 hours slowly slip into an irreversible chasm of their own doing. Thus we come to the latest in the ""going-downhill-singer flick"" in EL CANTANTE about the late  salsa singer Hector Lavoe who revolutionized the Latin music world in the 1970's. He rises to success and ultimately plummets into drugs and eventually succumbed to HIV/AIDS in 1993.It's a downer. Marc Anthony is magnificent,but not as electrifying, as Lavoe was in real life,but still does an adequate job in the singing sequences. Is he an actor though? I think not. He really needs help and direction in that field. Who does act in this film? JLo, that's who! As Hector's positively domineering and dominating wife/lover Pucci, Lopez scores big and gives this film the energy that is needed to propel the story along.Yes, Anthony and Lopez are real life husband and wife, but Anthony's lack of acting skills really shoots the screen chemistry apart. Sorry,Marc, but your wife is way better than you are. Watch SELENA!

As it turns out, I had indeed guessed right.  Knowledge of this particular artist or his musical genre is not essential in any way.First, however, there are some legitimate criticisms of this film that can be made.  Jennifer Lopez, who produced this film, gives her character's role in this movie way too much screentime.  Hector's girlfriend, Puchi, is interesting and important, but she is not nearly as important as Hector himself.  The viewer is short-changed when it comes to being educated about Hector Lavoe, who is El Cantante.  He played a very significant role in the development and growing popularity of Salsa, but we are not told enough of his story.  The script is far too vague about too many things.But the movie has two very strong aspects that serve to outweigh its limitations.  First, the music is fantastic.  Every single one of the musical interludes presented in this film are vivid and colorful and soulful.  This film will make you a fan of Salsa if you weren't already.  Second, the acting is superb.

It stars Jennifer Lopez as the late wife of the late singer from Puerto Rico, Hector Lavoe.  It also stars Jlo's husband Marc Anthony as Lavoe.WARNING THERE MAY BE SOME SPOILERSFor those of you who don't know who Hector Lavoe was, he was a singer from Puerto Rico.  Might I also say that Marc Anthony played Hector very authentically, so realistically that I thought I was looking at the real Hector Lavoe.  And Jlo does a very good job of playing Hector's hotheaded wife Puchi.  So the acting wasn't bad.Well onto the film.  At the beginging, Hector's dad threatens to disown him if he moves away to America.  Well certianly enough, Hector chases after his dream of making it big in the land of the free.  There he meets up with some people and they make a band together.  And there he also meets the love of his life, Puchi.  You had to admit it was really cute when Lavoe and Puchi were dancing together at the party.  And then when he had a hangover, she sat right next to him telling him not to die on her birthday.  Wow what a touching moment that was too.Well anyways, this story was told from Puchi's side of the story.  She goes on to explain how Hector and her had troubling realitionship when it came to fighting, affairs with other girls, perhaps even men, drugs, Hector's sister getting into fights with Puchi.  But non the less, they loved each other.  All though I have to admit that I liked the part where Hector was supposted to get married to Puchi in the church and she went to his hotel room and they got married there instead.  All I can say is I don't know how Hector handled a difficult woman like that, but he's a real trooper!It also tells about Hector's abuse of drugs, how his procrastanation lead to his manager quiting, his suicide attempt after he finds out that his son was accidently shot and killed by his best friend, and to the point where he finds out that he contracted AIDS in the 80s.Now onto the Spanish and subtitles in this film. Also might I add that Jlo didn't speak very much Spanish in the film, but I have to at least give Marc credit for speaking more Spanish then Jlo.  Also since I know enough Spanish to get by, even without the subtitles I could understand most of the time what he was saying.  But what about the folks who don't know!  Uh oh!  But the subtitles for me where very average when it came to this film.  Although they did a cleaver job of translating the lyrics of the songs onto the screen.The music was very enjoyable to listen too.But one thing I do have to critise about the film, is where in the heck was Hector's childhood in the film?!  And at times it could be slow, perhaps even hard to understand.  But other then that it was a pretty ok film.  It wasn't the best film in the world, but it's a decent biography on Lavoe and Puchi.I give credit to the actors and the director and producer for trying to make a decent, but overlooked film about Lavoe!Salud!",3,"Muy Interesante, Pero Muy Mediano",1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,2983,"['film', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'very', 'mediocore', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'late', 'wife', 'late', 'singer', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Hector', 'Lavoe', 'also', 'Jlo', 'husband', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'Lavoe.WARNING', 'THERE', 'MAY', 'BE', 'SOME', 'SPOILERSFor', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Hector', 'Lavoe', 'was', 'was', 'singer', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Might', 'also', 'say', 'Marc', 'Anthony', 'played', 'Hector', 'very', 'authentically', 'so', 'realistically', 'thought', 'was', 'looking', 'real', 'Hector', 'Lavoe', 'Jlo', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Hector', 'hotheaded', 'wife', 'Puchi', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad.Well', 'film', 'beginging', 'Hector', 'dad', 'disown', 'away', 'America', 'Well', 'certianly', 'enough', 'Hector', 'dream', 'making', 'big', 'land', 'free', 'up', 'people', 'make', 'band', 'together', 'also', 'love', 'life', 'Puchi', 'had', 'admit', 'was', 'really', 'cute', 'when', 'Lavoe', 'Puchi', 'were', 'dancing', 'together', 'party', 'then', 'when', 'had', 'hangover', 'sat', 'right', 'next', 'telling', 'not', 'die', 'birthday', 'Wow', 'what', 'touching', 'moment', 'was', 'too.Well', 'anyways', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'Puchi', 'side', 'story', 'explain', 'how', 'Hector', 'had', 'troubling', 'realitionship', 'when', 'came', 'fighting', 'affairs', 'other', 'girls', 'perhaps', 'even', 'men', 'drugs', 'Hector', 'sister', 'getting', 'fights', 'Puchi', 'non', 'less', 'loved', 'other', 'have', 'admit', 'liked', 'part', 'where', 'Hector', 'was', 'supposted', 'get', 'married', 'Puchi', 'church', 'went', 'hotel', 'room', 'got', 'married', 'there', 'instead', 'can', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Hector', 'handled', 'difficult', 'woman', 'real', 'trooper', 'also', 'Hector', 'abuse', 'drugs', 'how', 'procrastanation', 'lead', 'manager', 'quiting', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'out', 'son', 'was', 'accidently', 'shot', 'killed', 'best', 'friend', 'point', 'where', 'out', 'contracted', 'AIDS', '80s.Now', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'film', 'Also', 'might', 'add', 'Jlo', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'very', 'much', 'Spanish', 'film', 'have', 'least', 'give', 'Marc', 'credit', 'speaking', 'more', 'Spanish', 'then', 'Jlo', 'Also', 'know', 'enough', 'Spanish', 'get', 'even', 'subtitles', 'could', 'understand', 'most', 'time', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'what', 'folks', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Uh', 'oh', 'subtitles', 'where', 'very', 'average', 'when', 'came', 'film', 'did', 'cleaver', 'job', 'translating', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'screen.The', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'too.But', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'have', 'critise', 'film', 'where', 'heck', 'was', 'Hector', 'childhood', 'film', 'times', 'could', 'be', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'even', 'hard', 'understand', 'other', 'then', 'was', 'pretty', 'ok', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'film', 'world', 'decent', 'biography', 'Lavoe', 'Puchi.I', 'give', 'credit', 'actors', 'director', 'producer', 'trying', 'make', 'decent', 'overlooked', 'film', 'Lavoe', 'Salud']",El Cantante

I didn't know anything about Hector Lavoe before this film and sadly I still don't know that much about him.  I agree that as a biopic, the film fails to get the audience to connect with its main star.  In fact, it seems to go out of its way to show how much of a selfish jerk (keeping it P.G.) he was.  I think it has a lot to do with Anthony always wearing sunglasses in the film.  You have to show the movie audience your eyes.  That's how we bond with people.  The sunglasses allowed Marc Anthony to hide from the audience-and therefore gave us a sense that Anthony's performance was false.  Lopez needs to give up the singing and stick to acting.  Also, I do agree with some of the other reviewers has said about the direction and editing.  I don't think they should have approached this film like a faux documentary.

1105751,A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,B000VZADR4,Penumbra,"[3, 4]","As a fan of Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, Rueben Blades and Fania All Stars, I was interested in seeing this movie.  The story is framed as an interview with Hector's widow, Puchi, and the story is told from her point of view.  The interview scenes are filmed in black and white, but when we flash back to scenes of Hector's life the film is in vibrant color.  The movie treats us to a lot of beautiful color, motion and music.  It certainly has plenty of eye and ear candy.Jennifer Lopez gives a fine performance as she moves from a fun loving  young girl to a mature woman who lives a life filled with drugs, disappointments and tragedy.  Lopez has a lot to work with here as more dramatic time is devoted to Puchi than to Hector.Marc Anthony does well with the role which concentrates more on the singing than the drama. As expected, he does a marvelous job interpreting Lavoe's music, using the original Willie Colon arrangements.  Although Marc Anthony looks about 30 pounds lighter than Hector Lavoe was, there are moments when Anthony's resemblance to Lavoe is downright eerie! It also surprised me how well Anthony manages to physically portray the age ranges as he transitions from a 16 year old kid singing with his dad in Puerto Rico, to an endearing young guy with big talent and a corny sense of humor, and finally to a man in his late 40's ravaged by booze, drugs, AIDS, and personal tragedies.There is a very nice cameo by Victor Manuelle playing the young Rueben Blades performing an acoustic version of the song, ""El Cantante.""  Blades wrote the song as a tribute to Hector and presents it to him as a gift.Although I was familiar with Hector Lavoe's music, I didn't know anything about his personal life.  I wish that the story was told a bit differently with more emphasis on other aspects of his life, and the emergence of the salsa genre.  Instead, it becomes the story of yet another entertainer who is destroyed by alcohol and drugs - a story that was already old when the first version of ""A Star is Born"" was filmed in 1937.  Even with the drug use,  I thought Hector Lavoe's life could have provided material for a more meaningful story than this.There are nice extras on the DVD including two full length feature commentary tracks - one with director, Leon Ichaso - and one with the writers, David Darmstaeder and Todd Antony Bello.  There is one deleted scene, ""just say no to drugs.""  A feature called  ""the sound and the heat of 'El Cantante' "" - kind of a ""making of..."".  The feature package is rounded out with the theatrical trailer and sneak peeks of other films.The music and visuals are beautiful.  I wish they had chosen to concentrate on more positive aspects of Lavoe's life.

Zwick,"[1, 3]","**1/2In 1963, Hector Perez was already a promising young singer in his native Puerto Rico when, at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City to try and make a name for himself as a performer there.  In no time flat, he was playing in clubs, had signed a lucrative recording contract with the Latin-flavored Fania Records, and had changed his name to the far more exotic-sounding Hector Lavoe.  From the mid-1960s to his death from AIDS in 1993, Lavoe was an international sensation who helped to popularize the musical style known as ""Salsa.""  But, as with most artists, he lived a life of self-destructive self-indulgence, marked by serial philandering and hardcore drug abuse.  He also had a volatile relationship with ""Puchi,"" the Bronx girl who became his wife and who narrates ""El Cantante,"" the glossy movie about his life.Despite the novelty of the milieu and an undeniable sincerity on the part of everyone involved in its production, ""El Cantante"" remains doggedly conventional, lackluster and superficial in its treatment of the kind of material with which we are all too familiar from previous biopics that have chronicled the rise and fall of artists of all categories and stripes.  Marc Antony brings a certain ferocity and depth to his portrayal of the struggling celebrity, but real-life wife Jennifer Lopez is all fluttery overacting as the woman who stood by her man through good times and bad (mostly bad).  The music is enjoyable, but I'm afraid we've all been down this road so many times before that ""El Cantante"" fails to stir either our passions or our sympathy for the sadly benighted couple and all that they're going through.

Marc Anthony plays Hector and Jenifer Lopez his wife--Puchi. One of the many problems with this film was that Marc did not have a strong screen presence and his performance became overpowered by the amazing performance by Jenifer Lopez who did such a wonderful job I started thinking it was more about Hector's wife than about Hector.One effective part of the film I thoroughly enjoyed was how the story cut back and forth through an interview of Hector's wife looking back on Hector's life story. The interview was shot in black and white contrasting with the rich colors of the rest of the film.Despite this technique, the rest of the film was hard to follow. It seemed to follow a pre-made formula of music montage after music montage intercut with short scenes of dramatic acting, as if the director was following a manual of how to make a musician's biopic film. Also the use of fancy, rapid editing was way overused and after a while seemed only there to give it a sophisticated look.I love long films but this two hour movie had me checking my watch frequently. Overall it was a big disappointment and I felt the only thing that was good in the film was Jenifer Lopez's performance.

Instead she turns it into an ego trip in which the supposed title character is almost a cameo performer. Instead she has most of the screen time playing the untalented and unknown by the public, co-dependant, queen bitch, wife. Rather than a film filled with the mostly brilliant music produced by Lavoe, ironically in a film titled El Cantante (the singer) , we are served a series of monologues by Lopez bemoaning Lavoe's well known drug battles, without acknowledging her own apparent drug issues. But really the biggest problem is the pointless focus on the wife, the film should have been about Lavoe and his music, not Lopez and her desire to be on screen.Interspersed with these poorly acted monologues we get snips of songs here and there (the subtitled lyrics are a joke, mostly not even close to the intent of the lyrics), then of course there are the repetitious family blow up scenes, which look like they would be more at home on one of the spanish soaps, than on the big screen. A pity really, while Anthony is certainly a passable singer he is no where near the same league as Lavoe in his prime. But he does do a credible job on portraying Lavoe, a shame it did not get more time as he could have really pulled it off.Then the film just ends. Even then the closing shot is of Lopez. Not a shock, but Lavoe and his life, just as in real life, deserved better.",1,No stars for JLO ego trip,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,1498,"['Only', 'JLO', 'ego', 'balls', 'waste', 'opportunity', 'make', 'grand', 'movie', 'one', 'Salsa', 'Fania', 'biggest', 'stars', 'Instead', 'ego', 'trip', 'supposed', 'title', 'character', 'almost', 'cameo', 'performer', 'Instead', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'playing', 'untalented', 'unknown', 'public', 'co-dependant', 'queen', 'bitch', 'wife', 'Rather', 'film', 'filled', 'mostly', 'brilliant', 'music', 'produced', 'Lavoe', 'ironically', 'film', 'titled', 'El', 'Cantante', 'singer', 'are', 'served', 'series', 'monologues', 'Lopez', 'bemoaning', 'Lavoe', 'well', 'known', 'drug', 'battles', 'acknowledging', 'own', 'apparent', 'drug', 'issues', 'really', 'biggest', 'problem', 'pointless', 'focus', 'wife', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Lavoe', 'music', 'not', 'Lopez', 'desire', 'be', 'screen.Interspersed', 'poorly', 'acted', 'monologues', 'get', 'snips', 'songs', 'here', 'there', 'subtitled', 'lyrics', 'are', 'joke', 'mostly', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'intent', 'lyrics', 'then', 'course', 'are', 'repetitious', 'family', 'blow', 'up', 'scenes', 'look', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'home', 'one', 'spanish', 'soaps', 'big', 'screen', 'pity', 'really', 'Anthony', 'certainly', 'passable', 'singer', 'where', 'same', 'league', 'Lavoe', 'prime', 'do', 'credible', 'job', 'portraying', 'Lavoe', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'pulled', 'film', 'just', 'Even', 'then', 'closing', 'shot', 'Lopez', 'Not', 'shock', 'Lavoe', 'life', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'deserved', 'better']",El Cantante
