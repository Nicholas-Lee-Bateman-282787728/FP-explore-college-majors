It's not scray, it's badly acted, and it's a waste of time. I rented it because I liked the book, however, the screenwriter (who should be shot) totally messed it up. There's more gratuitous nudity in this film then scares. There was actually one part where I turned my head away from the screen, that was when the guy fell out the window butt naked, and showed the viewer his .... There are a bunch of more sex scenes, each looking like they were taken from a slasher movie. This was just appauling, it was almost a complete mockery of the book.Another thing, where was John Jaffery's party? apparently, the screenwriter didn't read the book. There's no Peter Barnes, no Louis, no Elmer, no Anna Moysten and no Ann Veronica Moore. This was just stupid, they ruined the book. Instead, we have Edward's nephew (oops! I ment son! because in this movie, he's his son!)Ricky, Sears, Edward and John all in a very stupid situation. Early in the movie, Edward jumps off a bridge (what? no, John is supposed to jump off a bridge, but in the film, Edward does!) and even stupider things happen.I can go on and on about how this film is a complete disgrace, but I believe that i've said enough.

Had I done the reverse, I would have had the novel in mind all along. GHOST STORY is one of my favorite 80s movies, and a decent enough spooker. I love the Chowder Society, played by Fred Astaire (Ricky), John Houseman (Sears), Melvin Douglas (John) , and Douglas Fairbanks, jr (Edward). Patricia Neal also has a small role as Ricky's wife.  Seeing them once again reminded me of how hollywood has (to its shame) nearly shut older actors out of the industry. Of course, the dark core of the story is embodied by Alma (Alice Krige) who is guilt / vengeance / nightmare incarnate. She is back to show the Chowder Society that not all things can be buried and forgotten. Ms. Krige is perfectly cast. I don't know what it is about her, but she has some cold quality that gives me the willies! This in spite of her beauty (even naked!). I kept waiting for her to strike someone dead.

202338,A17W36X7XYEG0N,6300182851,"Bookworm ""Pandora""","[2, 2]","For a movie made in 1981, this one still packs a whollop! For anyone not familiar with this little gem, this one is not for the faint of heart. In this day of SAW and HOSTEL, this movie still has the ability to scare the crap out of you! It isn't overly bloody or violent, but what it lacks in substance, it more than makes upfor it with it's suspenseful crawl through the ghostly heart of a woman's revenge. Based on the novel of the same name, four old men (Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, Fred Astaire,and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in their last starring roles) spend their evenings in a New England town swapping ghost stories. Soon they start dropping like flies, starting with one of the Mayor's (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) twin sons, played to the hilt by Craig Wasson in a dual role (beware...there is frontal nudity and it is shockingly displayed). Not long after the mayor falls to his death and soon, the doctor (Melvyn Douglas)is visited by a strange woman in black and dies of a heart attack. The remaining members of the group are beside themselves and Craig Wasson soon reveals his connection to a strange young woman with whom he had a torrid and short lived affair. Alice Krige is just lovely here and at her horrifying best as the object of Craig Wasson's desire and his ill-fated brother's as well. Not long after his twin brother's shocking death, he tells his father's friends what he knows about ""Alma"" who is later revealed as Eva, the woman whom the old men fancied years before. Eva's sad story is told in flashbacks and what eventually happened to her is one of the most horrifying and heartbreaking aspects of the movie. It doesn't take long for the surviving members (Fred Astaire and John Houseman) to make the connection and figure out they're all in danger. But ghosts have a way of exacting revenge, especially a woman scorned so it doesn't take a genius to figure out what's happening. I have to say this is one of the more enjoyable and certainly one of the best horror movies from the 80s. It's certainly worth a look on a dark and stormy night. But I do take issue with the excessive nudity. It isn't necessary in a movie like this. Alice Krige for all her talent must have felt it was essential for her career to bare her breasts. If that's true, then that's a sad commentary on the world today. Craig Wasson certainly isn't ashamed of his body given the amount of flesh he exposed in this film and in several others.

It's one of the least coherent, illogical messes ever committed to film.It's hard to know where to begin blasting this movie. It's so melodramatic as to be frequently laughable, for starters. The soundtrack, which is sometimes hauntingly beautiful, is more often jarringly inappropriate.The script is inconsistent, bringing up names out of nowhere and never explaining them (such as the name of the town in which the story takes place, which comes off sounding like a character who doesn't exist the way in which it is brought up), and introducing characters who drop out of the action equally inexplicably (Fenny Bates).The two young lover leads, Craig Wasson and Alice Krige, have zero chemistry together (Krige moved on to better roles, at least). Wasson is cast in a dual role, playing both the lead and his brother, seeming no different at all except for a paste-on moustache, which is just bizarre, considering there is no mention of the two being twins and any other actor could have been cast. He also has the most comically inappropriate full frontal nude scene ever gratuitously thrown into a movie, again for no appreciable reason.The effects are generally pretty bad - especially in the aforementioned comically inappropriate gratuitous full frontal nude scene, which is employed while Wasson's character falls unbelievably out of a window.The entire reason for the ghost's haunting makes no sense at all, making her seem merely petty and not really sympathetic at all (considering her death was accidentally caused) - and why is she after Wasson's dual characters, anyway, considering they had nothing to do with her demise?But the worst of all sins in this film is the portrayal of the haunted old men - splendid actors all, completely wasted in this awful mess - in their youth. They are all effeminate beyond belief, tittering like girls constantly, even dressing in drag for a party scene. They don't even bear much resemblance to their older counterparts.This movie is just embarrassingly awful, in every way.

202342,A2Y2AOCBKWV0FC,6300182851,Carlo Barlo,"[2, 2]","I first saw this movie back in 1981. I remember my dates face buried in my shoulder through most of it. Ghost story is based on the Peter Straub novel of the same name, most people state that the book is far better than the movie, and I tried reading the book, but it was drawn out and tedious. The movie entails the story of a group of afluent old men in a small New England town who share a terrible secret, and a spirit bent on revenge. Alice Krige absolutely shines in this movie. I had a huge crush on her after seeing this film. She is sexy, seductive, mysterious. She is also the undead spirit of a woman killed some 50 years before by the ""chowder society"" the a fore mentioned group of old men. The special effects are somewhat dated, but effective. The cinematography is excellent, and the setting of the town is at times very beautiful. There is one very hokey scene of Craig Wasson falling to his death that will probably make you laugh.But, if you like a series of freaky killings instigated by a animated rotting corpse, this is your film. But the flashback scenes are very well done, and the love story is enthralling. There is a sense of sadness that runs through the film its a very somber mood that runs though the entire movie. In my opinion, the ghost was justified in her revenge. But watch it for yourself. This isnt a gorefest, it has some gore, but its more psychological terror.

If approached as a low rent horror film that has been given an upper crust treatment it works just fine.  I had to bid around but I got a brand new copy of the now out of print DVD Image produced for Universal.  While not perfect for the price (both Laserdisc releases were much more, even the VHS) I was pleased.  The picture has been correctly framed in a 1:85:1 widescreen release and the picture has been given a very nice, but not exceptional transfer.  Colors were fine, flesh-tones seemed fairly accurate and there was very little grain apparent.  The sound delivered the score and effects just fine, dialogue was soft at times, but that may have been due to the film itself.  It is to bad that Universal let its contract with Image lapse (Universal was un-happy with the lower prices Image started charging for its 50 Universal movie only editions) and these titles go out of print.

The older of the two kind of explained why towards the end but it didn't make all that much sense.  Furthermore, the ghost was doing just fine without them, so why enlist their aid?Aside from those plot points, the film is entertaining.

They meet regularly in the evening to sip brandy and tell ghost stories to each other. When they were young men they met a woman named Eva Galli (Alice Krige) who fascinated them. She lived alone in a mansion. She was beautiful, free spirited, intelligent. They all in their own way fell in love with her. And one night something terrible happened. They covered it up and tried to forget her. Now, it seems their own ghost story is coming back for them.What are the movie's drawbacks? The film seems too long, mostly because much of the background is told in flashbacks with younger actors portraying the four old men. Another part of the story is told in flashback dealing with a contemporary element. The flashbacks, for me, just take far too much time to establish the base of the story. Second, there are too many skin shots of Craig Wasson as the son of one of the men and Alice Krige rolling around in bed or staring out of windows. The skin isn't essential to the story and seems to be nothing more than pandering to the audience.What makes the movie work for me? A number of things. Astaire, Houseman, Douglas and Fairbanks bring a lot of history and nostalgia to the movie. They also bring a good deal of skill. It's pleasing to see these actors given a chance to do their stuff one more time. This was the last film Astaire and Douglas made. Second, the whole idea of old men sitting around a fire, sipping brandy, and scaring the bejeesus out of each other while something from their past slowly circles nearer to them makes for a fine setup. Third, the look of the film is first rate. The story largely takes place in a small, picture-perfect New England town with two-story brick mansions which have mullioned windows and pocket doors, and the white church with a steeple is next to the town square. There's snow on the ground, snow falling, trees stark with bare branches and a full moon at night. Eva Galli's old, boarded up mansion, empty since she disappeared, is a decrepit, decaying horror for anyone brave enough to rip down the boards and enter. Fourth, Craig Wasson does a fine job as the puzzled, worried son who gradually realizes that a woman he thought he loved a few months before his father died looks an awful lot like Eva Galli in the one faded photograph of her that remains. Fifth, Alice Krige is terrific. She plays two parts but the same essential character. She gives off waves of sexual challenge. When she turns quiet and simply looks, there are moments when you really don't want to know what she's seeing.The DVD picture looks fine.

202352,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6300182851,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[31, 35]","Pull down the shades and turn off the lights as it's time for a ghost story, of sorts...Ghost Story (1981), based on the bestselling Peter Straub novel, was directed by John Irvin (Raw Deal, Next of Kin), and lists an impressive cast including Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and John Houseman.  Also appearing are Craig Wasson and relative newcomer Alice Krige, whose only other film appearance prior to this was Chariots of Fire (1981), although she has since had a long career, and I most remember her as the creepy mother from the film Sleepwalkers (1992), which was adapted from a Stephen King novel.  She's also the best element in the film.The film takes place mostly in a small New England town and is about four elderly men, members of The Chowder Society (they get together regularly to tell each other ghost stories), and a secret they've shared for the last 50 years, one that coming back to haunt them, both figuratively and literally speaking.  It seems these men, now town elders, participated in an event, one which they vowed never to speak of again, but has begun to manifest itself, possible through guilt, in terrible nightmares suffered by all four men.  Also, there's a little matter of a couple of nasty deaths...Having read about this film so long ago in a Fangoria magazine, I had wanted to see it at the time it came out, but, alas, being all of about 11, I was restricted from partaking in all the nekkid and/or gory goodness of R-rated films.  So, what's the deal with this film?  Based on excellent source material and incorporating an experienced and highly talented cast, you'd think you'd have a real winner on your hands, right?  Well, yes and no...what one may really notice the most after watching this film is the missed opportunity.  I think the main problem is the same one suffered by author Stephen King in that the source material, the novel by Straub, is very lengthy, highly detailed, and extremely difficult to transfer onto the silver screen without seriously altering the material.  Sure, the main elements will come through, but it's the intimate, complex details that tend to get lost, the ones that give the story depth and heart.  The actors do a wonderful job, although Wasson, even though I like him a lot, seemed an odd choice to play the son of one of the elderly men.  He ends up being sort of the catalyst that forces the older gentlemen to dredge up secrets buried, but never forgotten.  The cast is wonderful, the direction well, done, the sets and scenery highly effective, but the element that brings the film down is that even at almost two hours, the story is missing the ookie goodness from the novel.  Obviously the adapter had to pick and choose what parts to keep and what parts to omit, as is the case with any novel adapted to the screen, but the poor decisions as to what to keep and keep out become apparent as the story progresses, and the viewer begins questioning why the story becomes spotty and even crumbles at some points.  The pacing is extremely slow, giving up little until it's ready.  This may cause some viewers to become bored, but I rather enjoyed the gradual build up as it allowed for the viewer to really become immersed and soak up the positive, along with the negative, aspects of the plot.  There are numerous flashbacks throughout, as the mystery unfolds, and I thought they were handled particularly well.  The motivations of some key plot elements seemed unclear, specifically the Krige's character and the reasoning as to why she had contact with one of the elder men's sons, but I was able to get past that.  I thought the special effects were done very well, and helped immensely in adding a somewhat gothic feel to the film.  The film was definitely a horror movie, but took the road less traveled focusing on more of the horror inherent within the story, rather than providing the visceral imagery we've come to expect in modern horror films.  The nudity in the film seemed a bit gratuitous, and while I enjoyed seeing an attractive woman bare her assets, it wouldn't have hurt to have a little less.  There are some really good scares here, and given a bit of patience, the viewer will be rewarded.  There are weaknesses in the story, and viewers who've read the book will most likely be disappointed, as the film just cannot compete, even though it does give a good effort.  All in all, a solid, spooky, atmospheric slow-moving horror film with definite flaws that more or less equal its' strengths.The wide screen print here isn't as good as it could be, as the picture appears murky and has a dull, lifeless quality.  This isn't constant, but very apparent in a number of scenes.  The audio could use a bit of remastering, as it's uneven, soft and hard to discern sometimes, but there are English subtitles available, which I made use of through most of the film.  There are no special features other than a theatrical trailer, which I found a bit disappointing.  While this isn't one of the better truly scary films I've seen, it does have something to offer, as it's certainly not the worst, either.  It wouldn't be among my top recommendations, but if you find yourself one lonely and dark night looking for a bit of a fright, you could do a lot worse.  If you've read the book, you might do well to skip the film.Cookieman108",3,"""Dance with me, you little toad.""",1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,5353,"['Pull', 'down', 'shades', 'turn', 'off',

202355,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300182851,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","It's been at least fifteen years since I read Peter Straub's Ghost Story, and I must admit I've forgotten almost everything about the actual story.  What I do remember is my conviction that Straub's novel was truly a masterpiece of the horror genre.  Straub is a complete writer, not some penny dreadful hack, and that almost guarantees that no film can possibly do any of his writings justice.  Movies revolve around characters and actions, and Straub's fiction really plays on a much higher level.  Frankly, I'm surprised that anyone would even attempt to adapt Straub for the big screen.  Robbed of its atmospheric build-up, Ghost Story (the film) proves quite incapable of immersing you in the dark shadows haunting the Chowder Club Society meetings.  Unable to take on a life of its own onscreen, Ghost Story feels to me like an old made-for-TV movie.The four elderly, distinguished gentlemen who make up the The Chowder Society have been trading ghost tales and scary stories for decades.  For fifty years, however, not a one of them has ever even thought about mentioning the most disturbing story of all, one that they all secretly share.  Eva was her name, a saucy little newcomer who had all four of their college-age hearts pitter-pattering as they stumbled over one another pitching woo in her general direction.  It's weird enough for four best friends to all be wooing the same girl at the same time, but the director manages to make it even stranger and more confusing.  Two of the guys constantly giggle like schoolgirls, none of them seem to have a clue about the essential nature of man-woman communications, and they all combine to make one of the film's most climactic scenes little more than pedestrian in terms of their emotional reactions.As older gentlemen, the members of The Chowder Society are quite distinguished and refined.  It's a solid core of aging actors: Fred Astaire, John Houseman, Melvyn Douglas, and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  It's rather sad in a way, though, watching true Hollywood greats rapidly approaching the ends of their careers.  Astaire's dancing days were long over by this point, but his often-overlooked acting ability is quite evident here - he, Houseman, and a young Alice Krige (Eva/Alma) basically carry the movie on their backs.Ghost Story isn't a bad movie by any means; clearly, though, it falls far short of the mark set down in Straub's original novel.  There's just an almost complete lack of atmosphere on display here, even during the most dramatic scenes.  Moving at a preternaturally slow pace, the film will surely turn off a lot of younger fans expecting a lot of in-your-face action from start to finish.  It's hard to assign much blame for the ordinariness of this movie, though, as it really comes down to the fact that Peter Straub's fiction just doesn't lend itself to theatrical adaptation.",3,Straub's masterful novel just doesn't lend itself to theatrical adaptation,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,2862,"['been', 'least', 'fifteen', 'years', 'read', 'Peter', 'Straub', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'almost', 'everything', 'actual', 'story', 'What', 'do', 'remember', 'conviction', 'Straub', 'novel', 'was', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'genre', 'Straub', 'complete', 'writer', 'not', 'penny', 'dreadful', 'hack', 'almost', 'guarantees', 'film', 'can', 'possibly', 'do', 'writings', 'justice', 'Movies', 'revolve', 'characters', 'actions', 'Straub', 'fiction', 'really', 'much', 'higher', 'level', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'anyone', 'would', 'even', 'attempt', 'adapt', 'Straub', 'big', 'screen', 'Robbed', 'atmospheric', 'build-up', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'film', 'quite', 'incapable', 'immersing', 'dark', 'haunting', 'Chowder', 'Club', 'Society', 'meetings', 'Unable', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'onscreen', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'feels', 'old', 'made-for-TV', 'movie.The', 'four', 'elderly', 'distinguished', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Chowder', 'Society', 'have', 'been', 'trading', 'ghost', 'tales', 'scary', 'stories', 'decades', 'fifty', 'years', 'however', 'not', 'one', 'ever', 'even', 'thought', 'mentioning', 'most', 'disturbing', 'story', 'one', 'secretly', 'share', 'Eva', 'was', 'name', 'saucy', 'little', 'newcomer', 'who', 'had', 'four', 'college-age', 'hearts', 'pitter-pattering', 'stumbled', 'over', 'one', 'pitching', 'woo', 'general', 'direction', 'weird', 'enough', 'four', 'best', 'friends', 'be', 'wooing', 'same', 'girl', 'same', 'time', 'director', 'make', 'even', 'stranger', 'more', 'confusing', 'Two', 'guys', 'constantly', 'giggle', 'schoolgirls', 'none', 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'essential', 'nature', 'man-woman', 'communications', 'combine', 'make', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'little', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'terms', 'emotional', 'reactions.As', 'older', 'gentlemen', 'members', 'Chowder', 'Society', 'are', 'quite', 'distinguished', 'refined', 'solid', 'core', 'aging', 'actors', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr', 'rather', 'sad', 'way', 'watching', 'true', 'Hollywood', 'greats', 'rapidly', 'approaching', 'ends', 'careers', 'Astaire', 'dancing', 'days', 'were', 'long', 'over', 'point', 'often-overlooked', 'acting', 'ability', 'quite', 'evident', 'here', 'Houseman', 'young', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Eva/Alma', 'basically', 'carry', 'movie', 'backs.Ghost', 'Story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'clearly', 'far', 'short', 'mark', 'set', 'down', 'Straub', 'original', 'novel', 'just', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'atmosphere', 'display', 'here', 'even', 'most', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'Moving', 'preternaturally', 'slow', 'pace', 'film', 'will', 'surely', 'turn', 'off', 'lot', 'younger', 'fans', 'expecting', 'lot', 'in-your-face', 'action', 'start', 'finish', 'hard', 'assign', 'much', 'blame', 'ordinariness', 'movie', 'though', 'really', 'down', 'fact', 'Peter', 'Straub', 'fiction', 'just', ""n't"", 'lend', 'theatrical', 'adaptation']",N/A

Membership in the club, in fact, requires that one present such a story. The four friends are Ricky Hawthorne, a business owner, Sears James, a Lawyer, along with Dr. John Jaffrey and Edward Charles Wanderley, the Mayor. When Edward's son, David, living in New York, falls from a window after the girl he's sleeping with turns suddenly into a demon, Edward grieves. His other son, Don, a college professor who's fallen on hard times, shows up in town, not getting a great reception from Edward, who always preferred the other, more ambitious son. But now the four elderly gentlemen are unsettled and have nightmares. Clearly, something is bothering them. Edward becomes so distraught that he wanders across a bridge in the snow. When he sees the same female apparition that caused his son to fall to his death, Edward, too, falls to his death from the bridge. Although his death is ruled a suicide, his son Don and Edward's three remaining elderly friends doubt it. Don approaches the remaining three friends, requests membership in their group and offers up a bizarre ""ghost"" story of his own.It is great to see movie icons like Fred Astaire, Melvin Douglas, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr at least one more time on the screen. The movie for me sort of drags in the end and loses steam, but the ending is gratifying enough. Throughout the year I like to watch Astaire movies like Follow The Fleet, The Bandwagon, and Silk Stockings, but I reserve the month of October to watch him in Ghost Story. It's a movie that won't really disappoint...",5,Ghost Story: Great Fred Astaire Appearance,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2618,"['surprising', 'can', 'include', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'horror', 'sentence', 'movie', 'Astaire', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'musical', 'icons', '1930s', '1940s', 'However', 'late', 'life', 'made', 'little', 'horror', 'movie', 'worth', 'reviewing', 'horror', 'movie', 'worth', 'revisiting', 'month', 'October', 'What', 'Halloween', 'scary', 'movie', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'not', 'moive', 'will', 'keep', 'up', 'watch', 'pretty', 'good', 'twists', 'turns', 'Ghost', 'Story', '1981', 'American', 'horror', 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Irvin', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Peter', 'Straub', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Craig', 'Wasson', 'dual', 'role', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'feature', 'Astaire', 'Fairbanks', 'Douglas', 'first', 'film', 'feature', 'Michael', ""O'Neill"", 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Woodstock', 'VT', 'Saratoga', 'Springs', 'NY', 'Stetson', 'University', 'Deland', 'FL.In', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'four', 'elderly', 'friends', 'form', 'what', 'call', 'Chowder', 'Society', 'informal', 'club', 'where', 'regale', 'other', 'scary', 'stories', 'Membership', 'club', 'fact', 'one', 'present', 'story', 'four', 'friends', 'are', 'Ricky', 'Hawthorne', 'business', 'owner', 'Sears', 'James', 'Lawyer', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Jaffrey', 'Edward', 'Charles', 'Wanderley', 'Mayor', 'When', 'Edward', 'son', 'David', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'window', 'girl', 'sleeping', 'turns', 'suddenly', 'demon', 'Edward', 'other', 'son', 'Don', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'up', 'town', 'not', 'getting', 'great', 'reception', 'Edward', 'who', 'always', 'preferred', 'other', 'more', 'ambitious', 'son', 'now', 'four', 'elderly', 'gentlemen', 'are', 'unsettled', 'have', 'nightmares', 'Clearly', 'something', 'bothering', 'Edward', 'so', 'distraught', 'bridge', 'snow', 'When', 'same', 'female', 'apparition', 'caused', 'son', 'fall', 'death', 'Edward', 'too', 'death', 'bridge', 'death', 'ruled', 'suicide', 'son', 'Don', 'Edward', 'three', 'remaining', 'elderly', 'friends', 'doubt', 'Don', 'remaining', 'three', 'friends', 'requests', 'membership', 'group', 'up', 'bizarre', 'ghost', 'story', 'own.It', 'great', 'see', 'movie', 'icons', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Melvin', 'Douglas', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'screen', 'movie', 'sort', 'drags', 'end', 'steam', 'ending', 'gratifying', 'enough', 'year', 'like', 'watch', 'Astaire', 'movies', 'Follow', 'Fleet', 'Bandwagon', 'Silk', 'Stockings', 'reserve', 'month', 'October', 'watch', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'disappoint']",N/A

We then cut to a snow New England town and meet four old men, who call themselved ""The Chowder Society"". We soon learn that the man who fell to his death is the son of the town's mayor and Chowder Society member Edward Wanderley. Wanderley's other son, Don, and twin of the man who died, travels home to be with his father and attend the funeral. Troubling nightmares begin to haunt the old men, and when Wanderley dies after falling into an icy river, Don begins to suspect something is targeting the Chowder Society. Don tells the surviving members a story of a strange woman that he had fallen in love with, and we soon learn that this woman is the same one we saw at the beginning when Don's brother fell to his death. He believes this young woman is responsible for the deaths of his father and brother. The men of the Chowder Society then tell Don the dark secret which they've kept hidden for several decades.I enjoyed several elements of this film. The setting and cast are top notch. The snowy New England town lends itself perfectly to the atmosphere of the film. The top names in the film, Fred Astair, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Melvyn Douglas lend what could've been a cheezy b-movie, an aire of dignity and legitimacy. But it's Alice Krige who does most of the heavy lifting in the film, and she really carries the film with her role of Alma/Eva.Where ""Ghost Story"" falls apart is the pacing. The story begins to drag, particularly when Don tells us about his history with Alma. And right from one flashback we jump into another, and the film's tone and pace shift yet again.

It was obviously made on the cheap by people who didn't know much about horror movies but is inept in special ways. Why, for instance, does most of the movie take place in a series of poorly lit hallways? If there's a movie with more hallways in it than this one, I'm not aware of it. The movie makes a big deal about unfolding in the town of Milburn, which seems to be populated by about six people. When we do see a handful of extras, they look exactly like extras and you can sense them making an effort to be unobtrusive. Much of the movie apparently never made it to the screen; the end credits list several characters never seen. The movie, which never recovers from its awkward introductory scenes, comes to a dead halt during the campus flashback sequence, which was also the weakest, most &quot;writerly&quot; part of the book. Others reviewers here have mentioned the waste of Patricia Neal, the pained acting of Craig Wasson, and the porcelain beauty of Alice Krieg, who somehow survives the cinematographer's botch job (she outclasses the movie as a whole and has a great evil giggle to boot). To the list of complaints against the filmmakers, I'd like to add 1) the director's bizarre penchant for men in dresses (in a movie where practically nothing happens, there are not one but two such scenes); 2) editing and an overall narrative logic that rival the lunacy of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;; and 3) the hilariously bad &quot;special effects&quot; by Albert Whitlock, which are so primitive they'd put William Castle into despair. Do I have anything good to say about this movie?

Up to that point in the book it was rivetting, scary, really excellent as the reviewers said. But the shape shifting nonsense ruined the book, in my opinion.The movie dispensed with the shape shifer ""explanation"" of the ghost - it was left completely out, and you had no idea what the origin of Eva Galley was. In fact, from the movie you dont know who she was in the first place when the boys first met her - she was as mysterious then as she ended up being as a ghost. No explanations were offered and none were needed.Alice Krige was indeed the star of the show and her performance was perfect.

The reason behind her revenge makes an interesting story that may please soft-core fans of the genre.Based on Peter Straub's novel (which I have never read), ""Ghost Story"" stars several famous, accomplished actors, Fred Astaire (devoid of his dancing shoes), John Houseman, Douglas Fairbranks Jr and a new comer, the beautiful Alice Krige.  Overall, the performances are good by the ensemble cast but the real star, in my opinion, is Krige as Eva/Alma, the ruthless ghost who has risen from her frozen surroundings to get her revenge. Aside from being possibly the most attractive killer cadaver ever screened, her performance really stands out. She is seductive, cold and calculating and her voice, along with that accent, makes her rather unpleasant character kind of irresistible. She was indeed perfectly cast and it looks like she had a great time playing the elusive ghost tormenting the cowardly men of The Chowder Society. She also has some of the best dialogue in the film and delivers each line with a mixture of seduction and malice - ""Dance with me you little toad"", ""I think I'll take a bite out of you"", ""I thought you'd be dying to see me"", ""I will take you places you have never been, I will show you things you have never seen and I will see the life run out of you"".The cinematography is also excellent here and the overall look and feel of the film is effective and at times, chilling. We get some beautiful, eerie shots of the sleepy, quaint village covered in ice and blankets of snow adding much needed tension and fear, a frozen lake, a dark crumbling house with leaking, crumbling walls and colourful period costumes.The main problem with ""Ghost Story"" however is that it's a horror film with very little bite since the chills are few and far between. Although I have never read Straub's original novel, it has been stated that, not surprisingly, it is superior and very different to the film since several important elements were removed. Apparently Eva/Alma is a shape-shifter, a Manitou and this is not the direction the film went which is a shame as these otherworldly transformations would have raised the fright factor in the movie. With that said, the make up effects are very good. The vindictive spook appears in various stages of decomposition throughout unfortunately she appears for only a couple of seconds of screen time and the viewer has to wait another 30 minutes or so before the nasty corpse is briefly shown again.

That being said, the film does have good points such as just the presents of the four stars alone as well as Patricia Neal. Jack Cardiff's camera work is well done.

202370,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6300182851,Get What We Give,"[9, 9]","Ghost Story feels, at times, like it was designed to be a mini series. It's too long and there are several false starts and too much expositional material as the director attempts to include far too much of the information laid out in the novel.The premise is that in this New England township there is a group of very well heeled old codgers who regularly get together to share ghost stories with each other. Their continued friendship through the years seems to have been cemented in a singular deed that they committed in their youth - a deed that none of them dares to mention and none of them wishes to revisit.However, the old boys' past comes roaring into the present when one of them loses a son in a freak accident. After the accident his twin brother begins a relationship with a woman whose past, present, and future are very weird. Through this relationship, he feels compelled to investigate his brother's death and what connection it has with his father and the other members of the Chowder Society (the storytelling group of the old men).It is these flashback/present day/recent past recollections made by Craig Wasson's character that bogs down the film. It would seem that this material could have been much more effectively told in the film by simply a short spat of dialogue.Where this film excels is in the very real horrors of the ghost who is seeking revenge against the members of the Chowder Society. This is due, in no small part, to the remarkable and stellar cast that Ghost Story boasts: the historically far too little used John Houseman, Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal, Alice Krige (in one of her first and best performances), and Craig Wasson.This is a ghost story. As with The Changeling and The Haunting (1960), it depends not on gore or tricks to deliver its horror. It builds based on characters and actions of the characters.When the ""reveal"" occurs and the resolution begins, you can actually feel the dampness, and the oppressive atmosphere. You can sense the urgency of the characters - their need to complete their tasks before all is lost. But can they? Should they? After all, it was these old mens' actions that brought about the reality of this Ghost Story.Worthy of your time.

The guilt these men bear is unspeakable for an act they committed many years ago.  As the movie begins, the audience sees how the men are tormented in their dreams, but from what?  What unfolds is a chilling ghost story which, ""at times"" is quite effective presenting that ever elusive feeling of horror to the audience, especially for a ghost story, which is so hard to do.The creators of this ""Ghost Story"" provided the viewer with a mildly effective mesh of reality and dream to leave the viewer somewhat unsettled and aware that something scary or horrifying is about to happen.  The acting of Alice Krige is outstanding in this film...she is a natural in her role as the vengeful ghost.On the down side for ""Ghost Story"", there is no question that this movie is also boring at times as well.  For instance, the reminiscing of past events, especially about the youth of the old men, while informative, is actually incredibly boring...there are some lengthy scenes that really bring the movie down and cause the action to stagnate, the effect of which is sheer boredom in the audience.Also, this movie has way too much ""gratuitous nudity"", and this does hurt the film to some degree because, as I said, the movie gets boring and there is a lot of simply filler space...that said, I recommend that the viewer pay close attention to Emma's ghost-like mannerisms during the intervals of these scenes...she's quite creepy!  However, the nudity and sex scenes are obviously why we haven't seen this movie on television.  Another minor issue that I have with ""Ghost Story"" has to do with the two human characters, a young man and kid, who appear to be apparitions of some sort, but are really humans...in my humble opinion, their presence in this movie is completely unnecessary and nonsensical.  The horror, metaphysical/supernatural quality and mystery of the ghost is reduced to some extent as a result of this flaw.Overall, this is a pretty decent ghost story and horror movie with some definite flaws, but it's actually better than a lot of today's garbage.  I mildly recommend ""Ghost Story"" to the horror movie fan, but don't expect too much from this flick and you might actually walk away relatively satisfied with what you do get from it.  In other words, it's worth a rent, but I would not buy it.  ""Ghost Story"" may not quite deserve THREE STARS, but I'm going to give it anyway because it is better than average for a horror movie but not without flaws.

202378,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6300182851,Jeffrey Leach,"[4, 4]","I'll never, ever forget how ""Ghost Story"" begins. What a scary scene! We see veteran actor John Houseman, with all the gravitas he can muster, sitting around a campfire on a beach. He's surrounded by a bunch of kids as he recounts a tale of the supernatural that chills the blood. Houseman tells the story of a ship trying to make land in a dense fog only to sink on the rocks along the coast. Every hand onboard went down with the ship, called the Elizabeth Dane by the way, but the spirits of these angry sailors return from time to time to wreak havoc on the descendants of the townspeople who erroneously guided them to their doom. Isn't that a great story! Well, you sort of need to hear it come from Houseman to get the full effect. Wow! OH, WAIT A MINUTE! Sorry, wrong movie! The film in which Houseman told this story is John Carpenter's ""The Fog."" The movie I'm reviewing is ""Ghost Story,"" an entirely different film made a few years later that deals with a supernatural spirit seeking vengeance from the grave! Well, ""Ghost Story"" begins in much the same way, with Houseman telling a ghost story in front of a fire.There isn't a ghostly sailor to be found here, though. ""Ghost Story"" is a movie about four octogenarians who share a dreadful secret, a secret that has suddenly come back to haunt them years after the event took place. The four gents--Dr. John Jaffrey (Melvyn Douglas), Edward Wanderley (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), Ricky Hawthorne (Fred Astaire), and Sears James (Houseman)--have all lived a wonderful life. They form the upper class of their small New England village, they married good women, and their retirement consists of weekly sessions of their ""Chowder Society,"" which means they sit around telling ghost stories. Fun stuff, except there is one story that never receives a telling. It's a story about something that happened back when they were young men with gleams in their eyes, a story involving a young woman named Alma (Alice Krige). This young lass was rich, see, and all the men in town were just itching to land her as a wife. But Alma was a bit fickle, at least for a time, and when she finally did make her choice it led to nothing but juvenile jealousy. As we learn in the movie, it's only a short jump from jealousy to something far more sinister.But all of that happened decades ago. Certainly, such an event couldn't cause problems in the present, right? Wrong. Problem is, Alma's hostile spirit has decided to not only target the members of the Chowder Society, but some of their offspring as well, in this case Don and David Wanderley (Craig Wasson). These boys are the twin sons of the aforementioned Edward Wanderley, and the two men couldn't be more different in their outlook on life. One of the sons is a high-powered financial type with a plush office and big penthouse apartment. The other son is a dreamer, an educated book lover who can't seem to find steady employment except for the occasional stint as a part-time professor at various colleges. Both Don and David share something in common, however, and that is a visit from an attractive young woman who takes a keen interest in them. We learn exactly what this interest is, of course, in plodding detail thanks to the recollections of one of the brothers later on during a Chowder Society meeting. Let's just say that said woman, once one gets to know her, exhibits certain suspicious characteristics that hint at something otherworldly. In short, she's freaky weird in a real bad way. So bad, in fact, that one could very well find oneself soaring out of a window in one's birthday suit to get away from her. Ooooh!I'm giving away a few details here, but you'll still need to watch the film to understand exactly what the Chowder Society members did as youngsters to merit such attention from a spiteful spirit. You'll also need to watch to see what the spirit does in the present day. ""Ghost Story"" does manage to convey a few chilly shocks over the course of its two hour runtime, some real unsettling dialogue from Krige's character too, but the movie isn't as good as it could be. The main problem with this Peter Straub adaptation is its length. This flick feels like a television miniseries. We're in the present day listening to the members of the Chowder Society, then we're off to follow the misadventures of Don and David Wanderley, then it's fifty or sixty years into the past in order to understand the tragedy leading to numerous deaths in the preceding material. Whew! That's a lot of ground to cover! And unfortunately, the movie doesn't feel the need to maintain a consistent pace throughout. For example, the story related by Wanderley's kid about his run-in with Krige's character moves like molasses on a January day, and that's in spite of these scenes containing some of the creepiest stuff in the movie. The rest of the film moves at about the same pace.""Ghost Story"" still has its moments, though. It's nice to see these old actors onscreen one more time, especially Houseman and Astaire. It's also nice to see that young whippersnapper Alice Krige stealing every scene she's in. The DVD version of the film is a bit of a disappointment. The only extra is a theatrical trailer, but I guess we couldn't expect a commentary track from Douglas, Houseman, Astaire, or Fairbanks considering they all passed on ages ago. I recommend the film to horror fans, but others would probably do well to look elsewhere if they want a good ghost story.",3,Geriatric ghoulishness,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,5473,"[""'ll"",

Despite the perpetual nudity in the middle of this motion picture, it is apparent that several scenes and minutes were edited from the original script. It is understandable why the ghost was seeking revenge but how and why she took the avenues she did to attempt her revenge albeit retribution for the wrongs committed decades before left me filling in several holes.Much discussion has been focused on corpses and rotting flesh, and quite a bit of it is featured. However, another central theme is the disastrous consequences that can result from succumbing to the proverbial weaknesses of the flesh.Don Wanderley, the protagonist, is a well-educated but an apparently financially insecure individual who initially is on the right track teaching literature courses at a small liberal arts college, a location where just as he is forming a relationship with an academic contemporary he, unfortunately, also meets the dean's new secretary, who turns out to be the evil ghost, on her first day at work.The secretary, who later introduces herself as Alma Mobley, is played by the elegant Alice Krige and is a siren who occupies Wanderley's mind immediately upon their first encounter. By the end of the day, Wanderley and Mobley have gone out on a dinner date that leads to a night of passionate lovemaking.After that evening, Wanderley's life is headed for a downward spiral. As the story develops, he has by and large abandoned his academic responsibilities as well as the aforementioned female colleague who might have complemented him as a spouse. Mobley, that woman who quickly entered his life thanks to her alluring physical traits, is starting to make lifestyle demands, which are ultimately disclosed as pieces of a long range plan to, in ghostly form, avenge her murder that was committed fifty years before and was kept secret by and among four gentleman, one of whom was Wanderley's father.And as the demands increase, the more eerie and apparently psychotic Wanderley finds Alma Mobley to be. As events transpire, Wanderley, having finally seen a destructive pattern that has suddely invaded and overtaken his life, is in a quagmire. He resolves to rectify his situations, and upon action realizes that in spite of the destruction that has already been incurred, much more trouble, which will include scenes of murder, will lie ahead.Furthermore, the movie adaptation of Ghost Story is a moral tale in its own right. It is very understandable why Wanderley, especially being a young, single man, surrendered so easily to the temptations of Alma. However, he ended up becoming involved with a woman who, to the degree that she was attractive physically, was, to the same extent, unattractive psychologically.All in all, Ghost Story is an ultimately disturbing personification of why beauty is more than skin deep and why one should never judge anything merely at the surface level, especially when there is so much at stake!",4,"HOT, GORY SST",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,3005,"['Ghost', 'Story', 'interesting', 'horror', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'perpetual', 'nudity', 'middle', 'motion', 'picture', 'apparent', 'several', 'scenes', 'minutes', 'were', 'edited', 'original', 'script', 'understandable', 'why', 'ghost', 'was', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'how', 'why', 'took', 'avenues', 'did', 'attempt', 'revenge', 'retribution', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'decades', 'left', 'filling', 'several', 'holes.Much', 'discussion', 'been', 'focused', 'corpses', 'rotting', 'flesh', 'quite', 'bit', 'featured', 'However', 'central', 'theme', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'can', 'result', 'succumbing', 'proverbial', 'weaknesses', 'flesh.Don', 'Wanderley', 'protagonist', 'well-educated', 'apparently', 'financially', 'insecure', 'individual', 'who', 'initially', 'right', 'track', 'teaching', 'literature', 'courses', 'small', 'liberal', 'arts', 'college', 'location', 'where', 'just', 'forming', 'relationship', 'academic', 'contemporary', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'dean', 'new', 'secretary', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'evil', 'ghost', 'first', 'day', 'work.The', 'secretary', 'who', 'later', 'Alma', 'Mobley', 'played', 'elegant', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'siren', 'who', 'Wanderley', 'mind', 'immediately', 'first', 'encounter', 'end', 'day', 'Wanderley', 'Mobley', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'dinner', 'date', 'night', 'passionate', 'lovemaking.After', 'evening', 'Wanderley', 'life', 'headed', 'downward', 'spiral', 'story', 'large', 'abandoned', 'academic', 'responsibilities', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'female', 'colleague', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'complemented', 'spouse', 'Mobley', 'woman', 'who', 'quickly', 'entered', 'life', 'thanks', 'alluring', 'physical', 'traits', 'starting', 'make', 'lifestyle', 'demands', 'are', 'ultimately', 'disclosed', 'pieces', 'long', 'range', 'plan', 'ghostly', 'form', 'avenge', 'murder', 'was', 'committed', 'fifty', 'years', 'was', 'kept', 'secret', 'four', 'gentleman', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'Wanderley', 'father.And', 'demands', 'increase', 'more', 'eerie', 'apparently', 'psychotic', 'Wanderley', 'Alma', 'Mobley', 'be', 'events', 'transpire', 'Wanderley', 'having', 'finally', 'seen', 'destructive', 'pattern', 'suddely', 'invaded', 'overtaken', 'life', 'quagmire', 'rectify', 'situations', 'action', 'spite', 'destruction', 'already', 'been', 'incurred', 'much', 'more', 'trouble', 'will', 'include', 'scenes', 'murder', 'will', 'lie', 'ahead.Furthermore', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'moral', 'tale', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'understandable', 'why', 'Wanderley', 'especially', 'being', 'young', 'single', 'man', 'surrendered', 'so', 'easily', 'temptations', 'Alma', 'However', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'involved', 'woman', 'who', 'degree', 'was', 'attractive', 'physically', 'was', 'same', 'extent', 'unattractive', 'psychologically.All', 'Ghost', 'Story', 'ultimately', 'disturbing', 'personification', 'why', 'beauty', 'more', 'skin', 'deep', 'why', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'judge', 'anything', 'merely', 'surface', 'level', 'especially', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'stake']",N/A

However, this is different. VERY different. The plot is good and the actors are believeable. Not one scene in the movie that doesn't make any sense. Suspenseful from the first second, the movie captured my attention and destroyed my well-sleeping abilities for almost two weeks. The appearences of the Ghost come completely unsuspected and they are CREEPY AS HELL! ALICA KRIEG'S make up ( if she actually plays the &quot;THING&quot; I mean ) is more than chilling, although you don't get to see her in her whole rotten glory just a few seconds. But this is enough to make you want to turn the lights on and hide in your Bed! Believe me! You remember the End of Psycho- the Discovery of Norman's Mother? These kind of scenes are happening every 15 minutes here, and they manage to be really shocking.

202399,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6300182851,Nix Pix,"[2, 4]","A best-selling novel is just about the safest insurance that any director can buy toward the success of his own movie. Unfortunately, it's no guarantee or recipe for greatness. Author Peter Straub's ""Ghost Story"" is the rather chilling tale of four friends who accidentally murder a wealthy socialite - then move on with their lives. Too bad director John Irvin's ""Ghost Story"" is a convoluted chop job of the book with four imminent actors literally thrown into the plot. The film begins with four old men, Ricky (Fred Astaire), John (Melvyn Douglas), Edward (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) and Sears (John Houseman) living in quaint domesticity in a picturesque New England town. In the evenings they get together for tea and sharing tales of terror around the old campfire, or, in this case, fireplace.All, however, is not a postcard! Seems the boys are having a bit of trouble catching their winks. A series of disjointed nightmares about a rotting corpse ensue. But before we can invest in the terror of their subconscious, there's an abrupt and jarring cutaway to a fashionable New York apartment where a naked David Wanderley (Craig Wasson) finds his bathtub filling up. He also discovers a mysterious equally naked woman (Alice Krige) face down on a pillow in his bed. When he flips the seemingly harmless babe over it turns out to be a wormy disgusting corpse and David plunges to his death.  Now we are introduced to the Mayor of the small New England town - Edward Wanderley (Fairbanks). He calls his other son, Don (also Wasson - presumably because the film's budget precluded two actors from participating) to tell him about his brother's `accidental' death. Don immediately comes home.  But then Don learns about his father's club and, after daddy unexpectedly drowns Don regales the remaining members with a story of haunted romance. Seems he was a reasonably successful professor in Florida when he met Alma Mobley (Krige). The two are hot and heavy even though she throws out practically every sign known to man that she's a few apples short of a pie. Then the affair turns ugly and Don is sure that David has been killed by Alma who is really Eva, the ghost of the woman that Ricky, John, Edward and Sears killed nearly a half a century before. Go figure!The plot, such as it is, simply does not work. There's no provocation for Eva/Alma wanting either Don or David dead; no reason why Eva/Alma should wait sixty years to take vengeance on her killers (eg. an anniversary, a birthday, a round number...sixty years to the day, this sort of drivel), no explanation why the deaths occur in the order that they do; no logic behind Alma's invitation to Don that she's ""going to take him to places he's never been,"" and, finally; no reason why Mark Chamberlin, the actor who plays young John should look more like a youthful Fred Astaire than Tim Choate, the actor who plays Astaire's character, Ricky as a youth.This is not a cohesive narrative but a series of disjointed vignettes and bits of dry melodrama strung together with the hope that an audience will ""get it"" in the end. The film is big on gratuitous nudity - so much that a few scenes could technically be classified as soft core porn. Wasson is not an actor. He's a marionette, overplaying his hand like a prize ham. It's tragic to see the likes of Douglas and Astaire desperately trying to save face in this dismal excursion that ends as abruptly and absurdly as it begins.Albert Witlock's traveling matte effects - usually masterpieces of flawless escapism - on this outing are obvious and, in some cases, laughable. Watch for the scene where naked David plummets to his death through a plate glass ceiling into a swimming pool. It's the same slow-mo technical effect used in ""Psycho"" during the scene where Det. Arbogast (Martin Balsam) descends the stairs with a knife wound to his face. But that was 1960. Hardly worked then - definitely doesn't work now, and ""Ghost Story"" is a film unable to even begin to pucker up to the blood-soaked shower curtain of Hitchock's most gruesome thriller.As Universal's DVD packaging heralds, ""The time has come to tell the tale."" Indeed - this one's a stinker! This disc has been mastered from a film print, not an original negative. As a result there are age related artifacts throughout this presentation. Although they do not distract, they nevertheless degrade the visual material. The anamorphic DVD exhibits colors that can be nicely balanced. But on the whole there's a decided pasty quality to the film. Blacks are deep and, for the most part, solid. Flesh tones are way too pink! Fine film grain is present throughout. Details are generally nicely realized. A hint of edge enhancement is present as well as shimmering of fine details. Neither is distracting. The audio is 2.0 stereo with a characteristically dated fidelity. The only extra is a theatrical trailer.",3,DISMAL HORROR FILM WHOLLY LACKING IN SUSPENSE!,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,4881,"['best-selling', 'novel', 'just', 'safest', 'insurance', 'director', 'can',

202408,A37S3ACL57LN62,6300182851,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[4, 6]","Ghost Story is about a group of elderly men who are haunted by a woman that they were associated with long ago. Slowly, members of the group and their families begin to die, assumedly by their own hand. But they know better.A lot of this movie's appeal for me was the amazing cast. Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are all featured in the parts of the elderly men. It is exciting to see that these men could still get acting jobs well into their old age. Their experience also helps them. Fred Astaire especially does a remarkable job. Alice Krige does a good job with her role, being delicately pretty and somewhat chilling.The effects are dated. The scene in which a man falls to his death has a horrendously fake background. Also, the few glimpses of a rotting corpse are reminiscient of Tales from the Crypt.There is lots of nudity in this movie, both male and female. It depends on how one looks at it to see whether or not it is excessive. The first nude scene was certainly not necessary and could have been done differently. However, in terms of being realistic, some of it was needed. For example, the sex scene probably could have been done with less or no nudity, but it was more realistic in the way it was filmed. Also, when the characters are walking around naked after having sex, the camera does not shy away from showing anything. Instead of panning upward to show just faces and bare shoulders which would suggest nudity, it stays planted and when a woman's breasts or a man's butt come into the shot.The film is only somewhat suspenseful, especially compared to more modern horror movies. There are scenes that seem to be set up simply so a ghost or something strange can appear. However, these things never happen. The movie also leaves enough clues for the audience to begin to piece together the mystery themselves; when the story is finally told, it seems appropriate and the audience might have already figured it out.This movie resembles a film made more recently starring Harrison Ford called What Lies Beneath. I believe that that film is better in terms of suspense and the stories are quite similar.",4,A Good Story,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2151,"['Ghost', 'Story', 'group', 'elderly', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'haunted', 'woman', 'were', 'associated', 'long', 'ago', 'Slowly', 'members', 'group', 'families', 'begin', 'die', 'assumedly', 'own', 'hand', 'know', 'better.A', 'lot', 'movie', 'appeal', 'was', 'amazing', 'cast', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', 'are', 'featured', 'parts', 'elderly', 'men', 'exciting', 'see', 'men', 'could', 'still', 'get', 'acting', 'jobs', 'well', 'old', 'age', 'experience', 'also', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'especially', 'remarkable', 'job', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'being', 'delicately', 'pretty', 'somewhat', 'chilling.The', 'effects', 'are', 'dated', 'scene', 'man', 'death', 'horrendously', 'fake', 'background', 'Also', 'few', 'glimpses', 'rotting', 'corpse', 'are', 'reminiscient', 'Tales', 'Crypt.There', 'lots', 'nudity', 'movie', 'male', 'female', 'how', 'one', 'see', 'not', 'excessive', 'first', 'nude', 'scene', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'necessary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'However', 'terms', 'being', 'realistic', 'was', 'needed', 'example', 'sex', 'scene', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'less', 'nudity', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'Also', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'walking', 'naked', 'having', 'sex', 'camera', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'showing', 'anything', 'Instead', 'panning', 'upward', 'show', 'just', 'bare', 'shoulders', 'would', 'suggest', 'nudity', 'planted', 'when', 'woman', 'breasts', 'man', 'butt', 'come', 'shot.The', 'film', 'only', 'somewhat', 'suspenseful', 'especially', 'compared', 'more', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'set', 'up', 'simply', 'so', 'ghost', 'something', 'strange', 'can', 'appear', 'However', 'things', 'never', 'happen', 'movie', 'also', 'enough', 'clues', 'audience', 'begin', 'piece', 'together', 'mystery', 'when', 'story', 'finally', 'told', 'appropriate', 'audience', 'might', 'have', 'already', 'figured', 'out.This', 'movie', 'film', 'made', 'more', 'recently', 'starring', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'called', 'What', 'Beneath', 'believe', 'film', 'better', 'terms', 'suspense', 'stories', 'are', 'quite', 'similar']",N/A

202412,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6300182851,Sid the Elf,"[2, 5]","Ghost Story was released in 1981, adapted from a novel of the same name. Sid has never read the book, admitedly, but we really can't imagine it being better than this great movie. The film stars Fred Astaire, John Houseman and others.  Sid remembered seeing this flick one late night on tv. It scared the everliving out of this young elf then, so we decided to see if it held up today. So, we settled in with a little of the sacrament, and an inordinate ammount of food, sat back and watched a great horror flick. And if you were there, you'd have been like ahh sweet.Ghost story is centered around a group of guys called the Chowder society. We see them as young men and old men. As young men, they are a fruity barbershop quartet type of group. As old men they aren't much better, the're snooty old fogies. Except for Fred Astaire, you couldn't even make fun of him too much here. This actually works for the story though. You're not supposed to totally like these guys, but you're supposed to  kind of like them and that sucks you in. The basis of the Chowder Society is telling ghost stories. In their old age, the members have become unsettled. They are having nightmares, and one of them, Edward, dies. He is wandering around in the snow following the death of his son. He suddenly sees the hideous face of a creature. It looks like a dead woman whose corpse has been rotting for a very long time. Obviously, this scares him. It sends him over a bridge, falling to his death. Ironically, or maybe not, his son fell out of his high-rise window after seeing his girlfriend turn into that same horrible creature. This brings Edward's other son, David into town, wanting membership into the Chowder Society. So, he has to tell a ghost story. He tells one about his brother's girlfriend. Years earlier, he dated the same woman, but dumped her because she was cold to the touch and also because she was ugly. But she did put out a ton. I mean David was getting just a huge ammount of booty. A yooogge...ammount...of booty. Then his brother Don tells him that a woman stopped him on the street years later and thought he was David. David warns him, but his brother doesn't listen, dates this woman and she ultimately kills him then kills their father. Creepy.Now comes the why of all this. The old guys tell a ghost story of their own. 50 years ago, when they were in school a young woman came to town. Each of the guys wanted to make her a member of their personal chowder society. Giggety! Shockingly, she looked just like the woman who killed David's father and brother. Well, you know, when she was her normal ugly self, not the super ugly creature who caused two men to plunge to their deaths. So, she and Edward, David and Don's father, are all set to make a sexy time. But this yambag's bird is earthbound. What a loser! What a freak! Good. Good. More for you and me. This little scene was hilarious, just trust us. Then, this broad is making fun of Edward for his um, issue. And, to shut her up, he gives her a smack/push and she smashes her head against a stone fireplace. The Chowder Society thinks she's dead. Damn, now they all have to take turns with young Fred Astaire. Anyway, these are all promising young guys. If they admit to killing this girl, game over. So, instead, they stick her in the back of a car and push the car in a lake. Just as the car is being submurged, the girl starts to move. And the last we see of her alive is her screaming for help behind the back window of the car. The guys just stand on shore, stunned. They don't try to save her or get help. They let her die, and now she's back to haunt them all.David suggests that they go to the girl's old house to end the madness. The ghost's accomplices (don't ask) are there and they bump off one of the old men, and almost kill Fred Astaire. Eventually, Fred Astaire goes to the cops and they pull the car up. He and David confront the ghost/corpse and all is well.We just glossed over the ending of the film because it was terrible. As we said earlier, Sid saw this flick as a young elf and was terrified. As Sid remembers, the movie ended with the chick looking out the car window, and the car becoming submurged in the lake. Aparently, we blocked out the crappy ending. We really liked this movie. It was entertaining, ubercreepy, you could even go as far as saying it was kind of scary. And if it ended with the car dipping into the lake, this is a top 10 all-time horror movie. That awful ending knocked the flick down a peg in our eyes, but not enough to take a star away. This is a 5 star horror flick. Check it out, but turn it off when the chick is underwater.",5,Any real horror fan can appreciate the old school scares of Ghost Story,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,4653,"['Ghost', 'Story', 'was', 'released', '1981', 'adapted', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Sid', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'admitedly', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'being', 'better', 'great', 'movie', 'film', 'stars', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'John', 'Houseman', 'others', 'Sid', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'flick', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'tv', 'scared', 'everliving', 'young', 'elf', 'then', 'decided', 'see', 'held', 'up', 'today', 'So', 'settled', 'little', 'sacrament', 'inordinate', 'ammount', 'food', 'sat', 'back', 'watched', 'great', 'horror', 'flick', 'were', 'there', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'ahh', 'sweet.Ghost', 'story', 'centered', 'group', 'guys', 'called', 'Chowder', 'society', 'see', 'young', 'men', 'old', 'men', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'fruity', 'barbershop', 'quartet', 'type', 'group', 'old', 'men', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', ""'re"", 'snooty', 'old', 'fogies', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'fun', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'actually', 'story', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'totally', 'guys', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'kind', 'sucks', 'basis', 'Chowder', 'Society', 'telling', 'ghost', 'stories', 'old', 'age', 'members', 'have', 'become', 'unsettled', 'are', 'having', 'nightmares', 'one', 'Edward', 'wandering', 'around', 'snow', 'following', 'death', 'son', 'suddenly', 'hideous', 'face', 'creature', 'dead', 'woman', 'corpse', 'been', 'rotting', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Obviously', 'over', 'bridge', 'falling', 'death', 'Ironically', 'maybe', 'not', 'son', 'fell', 'high-rise', 'window', 'seeing', 'girlfriend', 'turn', 'same', 'horrible', 'creature', 'Edward', 'other', 'son', 'David', 'town', 'wanting', 'membership', 'Chowder', 'Society', 'So', 'tell', 'ghost', 'story', 'one', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Years', 'earlier', 'dated', 'same', 'woman', 'dumped', 'was', 'cold', 'touch', 'also', 'was', 'ugly', 'did', 'put', 'out', 'ton', 'mean', 'David', 'was', 'getting', 'just', 'huge', 'ammount', 'booty', 'yooogge', 'ammount', 'booty', 'Then', 'brother', 'Don', 'woman', 'stopped', 'street', 'years', 'later', 'thought', 'was', 'David', 'David', 'brother', ""n't"", 'listen', 'woman', 'ultimately', 'then', 'father', 'Creepy.Now', 'why', 'old', 'guys', 'tell', 'ghost', 'story', 'own', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'school', 'young', 'woman', 'came', 'town', 'guys', 'wanted', 'make', 'member', 'personal', 'chowder', 'society', 'Giggety', 'Shockingly', 'looked', 'just', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'David', 'father', 'brother', 'Well', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'normal', 'ugly', 'not', 'super', 'ugly', 'creature', 'who', 'caused', 'two', 'men', 'plunge', 'deaths', 'So', 'Edward', 'David', 'Don', 'father', 'are', 'set', 'make', 'sexy', 'time', 'yambag', 'bird', 'earthbound', 'What', 'loser', 'What', 'freak', 'Good', 'Good', 'More', 'little', 'scene', 'was', 'hilarious', 'just', 'trust', 'Then', 'broad', 'making', 'fun', 'Edward', 'um', 'issue', 'shut', 'up', 'smack/push', 'head', 'stone', 'fireplace', 'Chowder', 'Society', 'dead', 'Damn', 'now', 'have', 'take', 'turns', 'young', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Anyway', 'are', 'promising', 'young', 'guys', 'admit', 'killing', 'girl', 'game', 'So', 'instead', 'stick', 'back', 'car', 'push', 'car', 'lake', 'Just', 'car', 'being', 'submurged', 'girl', 'move', 'last', 'see', 'alive', 'screaming', 'help', 'back', 'window', 'car', 'guys', 'just', 'stand', 'shore', 'stunned', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'save', 'get', 'help', 'let', 'die', 'now', 'back', 'haunt', 'all.David', 'go', 'girl', 'old', 'house', 'end', 'madness', 'ghost', 'accomplices', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'are', 'there', 'bump', 'one', 'old', 'men', 'almost', 'kill', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Eventually', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'cops', 'pull', 'car', 'up', 'David', 'confront', 'ghost/corpse', 'well.We', 'just', 'glossed', 'over', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'terrible', 'said', 'earlier', 'Sid', 'saw', 'flick', 'young', 'elf', 'was', 'terrified', 'Sid', 'remembers', 'movie', 'ended', 'chick', 'looking', 'out', 'car', 'window', 'car', 'becoming', 'submurged', 'lake', 'Aparently', 'blocked', 'out', 'crappy', 'ending', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'ubercreepy', 'could', 'even', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'saying', 'was', 'kind', 'scary', 'ended', 'car', 'dipping', 'lake', 'top', '10', 'all-time', 'horror', 'movie', 'awful', 'ending', 'knocked', 'flick', 'down', 'peg', 'eyes', 'not', 'enough', 'take', 'star', 'away', '5', 'star', 'horror', 'flick', 'Check', 'out', 'turn', 'off', 'when', 'chick', 'underwater']",N/A

She really held this film together along with Fred Astaire who is always a pleasure to watch.  Some may recognize Krige as the head Borg in the film ""First Contact"" and her riviting appearance in Stephen King's ""Sleepwalkers.""  It's amazing how little this actress has changed in 25 years. She is still a very beautiful woman and is still acting.  She recently appeared as the lead evil doer in ""Silent Hill.""  She is a fine actress who has built a nice little following for herself in her long but quiet career.As far as the rest of this film.  I generally liked it.  It's just an old-fashioned spooky tale that unfolds slowly.  In fact, too slowly at times, hence the three stars rating I gave it.  It reminds me of the less gore-filled films of its era like ""Burnt Offerings"" which was another really good but under appreciated film in its time.

Alice Krige is bewitchingly mysterious as Eva/Alma though a lot of unresolved questions remain about who or what her character actually is and what provokes her to seek revenge fifty years after the original incident.  There are also a couple of other sinister characters (Fenny and Gregory) who are really just bit players in the movie but apparently play a large part in the book.  The movie makers might have well just cut them out since they add very little but confusion to the film.  Fred Astaire is the best of the four over seventy years old actors in the movie (the others are John Houseman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Melvyn Douglas and they are adequate but not great).  The filmmakers do do a good job of invoking a small New England town in winter but I didn't find the movie particularly scary though granted I watched it on my PC on a sunny afternoon.  Like some other reviewers I  found Alice Krige and Craig Wasson's nude scenes to be unnecessary and these scenes actually detracted from the credibility of the entire movie.  The movie and other reviewer's comments did leave me intrigued enough to find a copy of Peter Straub's novel the film is adapted from at the library this morning and check it out.",3,OK Ghost Story ..............,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1321,"['1981', 'film', 'GHOST', 'STORY', 'watchable', 'somewhat', 'compelling', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'bewitchingly', 'mysterious', 'Eva/Alma', 'lot', 'unresolved', 'questions', 'remain', 'who', 'what', 'character', 'actually', 'what', 'seek', 'revenge', 'fifty', 'years', 'original', 'incident', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'other', 'sinister', 'characters', 'Fenny', 'Gregory', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'bit', 'players', 'movie', 'apparently', 'play', 'large', 'part', 'book', 'movie', 'makers', 'might', 'have', 'well', 'just', 'cut', 'out', 'add', 'very', 'little', 'confusion', 'film', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'best', 'four', 'seventy', 'years', 'old', 'actors', 'movie', 'others', 'are', 'John', 'Houseman', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'Jr.', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'are', 'adequate', 'not', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'invoking', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'winter', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'particularly', 'scary', 'granted', 'watched', 'PC', 'sunny', 'afternoon', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'Craig', 'Wasson', 'nude', 'scenes', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'actually', 'detracted', 'credibility', 'entire', 'movie', 'movie', 'other', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'did', 'leave', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'find', 'copy', 'Peter', 'Straub', 'novel', 'film', 'adapted', 'library', 'morning', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Maybe it was the gratuitous nudity. Maybe it was because Alice Krige was really working the freaky for all it was worth. No wonder she was the Borg Queen.I saw this movie again and it's awful. First off, all the old actors are dreadful. Fred Astaire tries really hard to look innocent. John Houseman has fun, but John Houseman had fun with those Smith Barney commercials. The other two actors did nothing with their performances.To add insult to injury, the directing was atrocious. This woman's only weapon is scare these old guys when they are standing very close to a dangerous precipe. That's it. All the ambiguity over whether she is really a vengeful ghost or something older and infinitely more evil falls by the wayside. Everyone is naked for no apparent reason.This movie is awful on its own merits. Bad script. Lousy acting (with the exception of Alice Krige), and terrible directing (even the winter scenes fail to look cold or forbidding) combine to make this a dreary exercise in loathing. What's even worse is the fact that the book is so great.Maybe a good director will direct a version of Ghost Story that doesn't suck one of these days.

Alice Krige is just mesmerising as both the beautiful, doomed, Eva and the vengeful Alma.  But did they leave a lot on the cutting room floor?  I get  the sense that Patricia Neal's entire performance ended up there.The  problem with the script, I think is that they tried to keep too much of  Peter Straub's book, while cutting the heart out of it. (It's  a great  book, by the way- a real stay-up-all-night read)  They lose the central  premise of the &quot;ghosts&quot; being supernatural beings of  extraordinary cleverness, evil, and humor. But in keeping some of these  characters of the novel without explaining who they are, or what they are,  you are sort of left saying &quot;huh?&quot;  It also means that the four  men central to the story are just plain not-very-nice when it comes right  down to it. And it makes Eva's desire for revenge understandable, if not  laudableBut all kvetching aside, this is a beautiful movie.  It is shot  in upstate New York (ably standing in for Vermont), and is one of the few  movies I have ever seen to actually capture the other-wordliness that  winter in New England can be.  It is a fine musing on old age, lonelines,  and regret, and manages dome real jump-outta-your-seat shocks, while making  you care not only for the living, but for the dead as well.",3,"stylish, flawed",964137600,"07 21, 2000",2000,1372,"['fine', 'wonderfully', 'atmospheric', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'just', 'mesmerising', 'beautiful', 'doomed', 'Eva', 'vengeful', 'Alma', 'did', 'leave', 'lot', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'get', 'sense', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'entire', 'performance', 'ended', 'up', 'there.The', 'problem', 'script', 'think', 'tried', 'keep', 'too', 'much', 'Peter', 'Straub', 'book', 'cutting', 'heart', 'great', 'book', 'way-', 'real', 'stay-up-all-night', 'read', 'lose', 'central', 'premise', 'quot', 'ghosts', 'quot', 'being', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'extraordinary', 'cleverness', 'evil', 'humor', 'keeping', 'characters', 'novel', 'explaining', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'are', 'sort', 'left', 'saying', 'quot', 'quot', 'also', 'four', 'men', 'central', 'story', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'not-very-nice', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'Eva', 'desire', 'revenge', 'understandable', 'not', 'laudableBut', 'kvetching', 'aside', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'shot', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'ably', 'standing', 'Vermont', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actually', 'capture', 'other-wordliness', 'winter', 'New', 'England', 'can', 'be', 'fine', 'musing', 'old', 'age', 'lonelines', 'regret', 'dome', 'real', 'jump-outta-your-seat', 'shocks', 'making', 'care', 'not', 'only', 'living', 'dead', 'well']",N/A

Is there a difference between these two DVD's other than price?Ghost Story is an honest-to-goodness, bone-chilling horror flick..Horror movies made in the 60's and 70's contained some gore and/or nudity, unlike films made nowadays, which have both, but lacking the most important thing..A Plot!Holywood 'now' focuses more on graphics and booming sound. Give me an older horror movie anytime.Although, Ghost Story, surprisingly contained nudity, (Eva/Alma and Don making passionate love, Alma is walking to bed donned in her birthday suit, and we can't forget Don falling from a window, allowing it to 'all hang out') considering movie era of semi-innocence...BUT the difference is, GS has a plot.The best time to watch GS is on a cold, snowy winter's night...lights off. Or during a summer, windy evening, thunder is booming, ligtening zig-zagging and rain falling. Those with vivid imaginations will feel the true effects of this movie..Some might end up turning on a lamp..lolAlthough physical entities are important, 'a creaking door, a corpse resurfacing from the grave,' there's something to psychological (who done it, what's going to happen next) horror, too. GS has both.Although GS is based on Peter Straub's novel, there are very few similaries...even little things like, novel--Eva/Alma has a southern accent, movie--she has an English accent. To be honest, I prefer the English Accent..Mr. Straubs mistake.I don't understand why some advise not to watch GS if they've read the book..why not? Even though they differ in some ways, the movie is still worth watching.BTW, there are several excellent novels, made into movies. In some cases if you hadn't read the book you would have difficulty understanding the movie. Eg..The Sentinel/1977 movie with Christina Raines, based on the novel written by Jeffery Konvitz.All in all, Ghost Story a very good movie..it doesn't have the graphics like today's movies, so if graphics are your thing, only then would I suggest passing it up, but if you're a true fan of horror, go for it..PS.
