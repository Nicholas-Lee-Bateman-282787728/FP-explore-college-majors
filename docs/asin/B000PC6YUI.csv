The period costumes, manners, sets were all top notch. The actors did an incredible job and you always felt like you were really there with them. However, the reason I am giving this a 3 instead of a 5 is because there is no ending. Now this wasn't the fault of the people involved with making the show but apparently BBC pulled the plug at the end of series 3. Since the writers had no idea this was going to happen, the season finale of series 3 is full of cliff hangers, including the prospect of the Eliott sisters going against each other for real. For me there is nothing more frustrating than purchasing an expensive box set without any knowledge that the show doesnt really end. If I researched it better I would have passed on this as I feel duped. Still it is a wonderfully produced period drama and anyone would enjoy it.

Two sisters who had been raised as members of a priveleged class, find themselves penniless after the death of their profligate father who has denied them an education which would enable them to make their own way in the world. Both are talented dressmakers and designers, used to making their own clothes and both have an inborn flair for style and cut. They establish one of the first English Haute Couture fashion houses at a time when it was thought that only the French were able to create fashion, and gradually set their own style which converts a large number of society women to becoming regular clients. The dressing in the show is superb, going from the immediate post WW1 days through to the middle thirties, and the details of furnishings, cars and houses are perfect.

1069782,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B000PC6YUI,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[5, 5]","""The House of Eliott"" is a lavish and lush treat for anyone who loves the beautifully detailed BBC costume dramas traditionally showcased on ""Masterpiece Theater"" or (of late) on the A&E; channel. I've never been able to figure out why the Brits do this sort of thing so consistently well, but American producers attempting the same thing more often fall flat. Attention to detail, I think... or a total willingness to put the acting company in costumes and hairdos that may look distinctly odd, or unattractive to conventional modern eyes.This  three-season long series aired originally from 1991-1994 and follows the fortunes of the Eliott sisters,  Beatrice  ""Bea"", (Stella Gonet) and Evangeline ""Evie""  (Louise Lombard) who are left apparently impoverished by sudden death of their domineering father early in 1920s London. Bea is thirty-year old spinster who has raised her seventeen-year old sister after the death of their mother. Neither of them have any professional training, only the usual education  thought fit for a middle-class woman of the time,  no prospects for marriage... and no money.But Bea has the experience of running a household, and Evie is a skilled amateur artist... and they are accustomed to making their own clothes. They are fiercely determined to be independent, to have successful lives on their own... and with the aid of a circle of friends they are able to establish a small couture firm; the ""House of Elliot"". The series follows the sisters' business and personal ups and downs, and those of their circle of friends and employees. Bea and Evie clash with each other, over what they want to focus on with their business, just as often as they agree. It's soap-opera-ish but briskly paced. The details of period fashion are exquisite and fascinating, as the sisters very gradually develop confidence and style of their own, moving from dowdy post-war styles that seem a hangover from the age of Victoria, to very chic, jewel-colored clothes befitting the owners of a notable haute couture house.So much of our current culture landscape was just coming into flower in the 1920s. Mass entertainment like the movies, radio and recorded music, the retail fashion trade, telephones and commercial air transport, the near-universal utility of automobiles, and women pursuing independent careers and balancing that with a family life. The world of the Eliott sisters looks just enough like ours to be familiar... but just different enough to be intriguing. But one absolutely timeless, brief scene of an elegant Evie Eliott, in high heels and a knee-length skirt, sashaying briskly  along a London sidewalk is a reminder of  how swiftly expectations of what a woman should be, and those that a woman had of herself had changed  in a bare two decades.My one criticism is that the third series seems oddly truncated, as if the story arc just abruptly ended in mid-point. There were set-ups and situations in the last two episodes that were just left dangling, as if the plug was pulled before the writers could tie them all together with one satisfactory conclusion, or as if there was supposed to be one more season, to carry the story to a logical conclusion... say, with the beginning of the Depression that put paid to the  flamboyant and glittering decade of the 1920s.The ""bonus"" extras are hidden away on the first disc of each series: stills of the cast of each season, and of various movie and television credits. There is a recent interview with Louise Lombard, and a brief and rather disappointing feature on fashion of the 1920ies which would have been much improved with stills of the various costumes actually used in the series. And do not miss a Minnie Driver in a bit-part in episode 4 of the first season. All in all, the series is as rich and as lavish a treat as one of the Eliott sisters ensemble collections.",5,A Lavish Portrait of an Era,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,3859,"['House', 'Eliott', 'lavish', 'lush', 'treat', 'anyone', 'who', 'beautifully', 'detailed', 'BBC', 'costume', 'dramas', 'traditionally', 'showcased', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'late', 'A', 'E', 'channel', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Brits', 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'so', 'consistently', 'well', 'American', 'producers', 'attempting', 'same', 'thing', 'more', 'often', 'fall', 'flat', 'Attention', 'detail', 'think', 'total', 'willingness', 'put', 'acting', 'company', 'costumes', 'hairdos', 'may', 'look', 'distinctly', 'odd', 'unattractive', 'conventional', 'modern', 'eyes.This', 'three-season', 'long', 'series', 'aired', 'originally', '1991-1994', 'fortunes', 'Eliott', 'sisters', 'Beatrice', 'Bea', 'Stella', 'Gonet', 'Evangeline', 'Evie', 'Louise', 'Lombard', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'apparently', 'impoverished', 'sudden', 'death', 'domineering', 'father', 'early', '1920s', 'London', 'Bea', 'thirty-year', 'old', 'spinster', 'who', 'raised', 'seventeen-year', 'old', 'sister', 'death', 'mother', 'have', 'professional', 'training', 'only', 'usual', 'education', 'thought', 'fit', 'middle-class', 'woman', 'time', 'prospects', 'marriage', 'money.But', 'Bea', 'experience', 'running', 'household', 'Evie', 'skilled', 'amateur', 'artist', 'are', 'accustomed', 'making', 'own', 'clothes', 'are', 'fiercely', 'determined', 'be', 'independent', 'have', 'successful', 'lives', 'own', 'aid', 'circle', 'friends', 'are', 'able', 'establish', 'small', 'couture', 'firm', 'House', 'Elliot', 'series', 'sisters', 'business', 'personal', 'ups', 'downs', 'circle', 'friends', 'employees', 'Bea', 'Evie', 'clash', 'other', 'what', 'want', 'focus', 'business', 'just', 'as', 'often', 'agree', 'soap-opera-ish', 'briskly', 'paced', 'details', 'period', 'fashion', 'are', 'exquisite', 'fascinating', 'sisters', 'very', 'gradually', 'develop', 'confidence', 'style', 'own', 'moving', 'dowdy', 'post-war', 'styles', 'seem', 'hangover', 'age', 'Victoria', 'very', 'chic', 'jewel-colored', 'clothes', 'befitting', 'owners', 'notable', 'haute', 'couture', 'house.So', 'much', 'current', 'culture', 'landscape', 'was', 'just', 'coming', 'flower', '1920s', 'Mass', 'entertainment', 'movies', 'radio', 'recorded', 'music', 'retail', 'fashion', 'trade', 'telephones', 'commercial', 'air', 'transport', 'near-universal', 'utility', 'automobiles', 'women', 'pursuing', 'independent', 'careers', 'balancing', 'family', 'life', 'world', 'Eliott', 'sisters', 'just', 'enough', 'like', 'ours', 'be', 'familiar', 'just', 'different', 'enough', 'be', 'intriguing', 'one', 'absolutely', 'timeless', 'brief', 'scene', 'elegant', 'Evie', 'Eliott', 'high', 'heels', 'knee-length', 'skirt', 'sashaying', 'briskly', 'London', 'sidewalk', 'reminder', 'how', 'swiftly', 'expectations', 'what', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'woman', 'had', 'had', 'changed', 'bare', 'two', 'decades.My', 'one', 'criticism', 'third', 'series', 'oddly', 'truncated', 'story', 'arc', 'just', 'abruptly', 'ended', 'mid-point', 'were', 'set-ups', 'situations', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'just', 'left', 'dangling', 'plug', 'was', 'pulled', 'writers', 'could', 'tie', 'together', 'one', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'carry', 'story', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'say', 'beginning', 'Depression', 'put', 'paid', 'flamboyant', 'glittering', 'decade', '1920s.The', 'bonus', 'extras', 'are', 'hidden', 'away', 'first', 'disc', 'series', 'stills', 'cast', 'season', 'various', 'movie', 'television', 'credits', 'recent', 'interview', 'Louise', 'Lombard', 'brief', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'feature', 'fashion', '1920ies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'improved', 'stills', 'various', 'costumes', 'actually', 'used', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'bit-part', 'episode', '4', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'rich', 'lavish', 'treat', 'one', 'Eliott', 'sisters', 'ensemble', 'collections']",The House of Eliott - Complete Collection

It is as much a bargain as it is a beautifully filmed British drama about the London fashion industry.  From seamstress to industry giants, you meet and learn to love or hate all the people that work and create exclusive fashions.It is a delight.  Bea and Evie, the beautiful, unwed Eliott sisters, become the viewer's family. Splendid acting causes one to run the gambit of emotion as Bea and Evie struggle and succeed, over and over, first one-then the other, through a decade of trying to rise above the odds.  Being sheltered and uneducated, the two find themselves in the early 1920's without means, an exhausted estate, and only sewing skills in place of an education.  It was society's way.Through the episodes, they both face the hard road to finding love.  They both face the hard road to financial success.  A fantastic story of ladies taking on the world, usi8ng beauty, talent, and intellect--AND WINNING.  Unsurpassed 20s costuming and sets.  Experience NOT the Roaring Twenties, but the Sensual Twenties.34 episodes pass much too quickly, leaving one with the desire for more. The Eliott family is done, the episodes are completed, and there is nothing we can do about our own loss--EXCEPT--return to disc one and start again.  It's that good.A very interesting extra is a 2005 interview with Louise Lombard (CSI) who played Evie Eliott. She recalls show moments, while at interview time is only 4 days from delivery of a baby.  Lombard was also in ""The Black Velvet Gown"" a film made from the book by Catherine Cookson. Any Cookson movie is recommended.This DVD set gives viewers a very early look at Minnie Driver (Good Will Hunting, Circle of Friends).  She was cast as the second receptionist in Jack's photo studio.This is a first-rate series as proven by its presentation on the BBC, A&E;, PBS, BBC America, plus receiving costume design awards, Emmy, and a BAFTA.",5,"2 PROGRESSIVE LONDON LADIES, SISTERS, TAKE ON THE FASHION WORLD IN THE 1920s--BEAUTIFULLY!",1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2045,"['complete', 'collection', 'HOUSE', 'ELIOTT', '34', 'episodes', '1770', 'minutes', 'approximately', 'same', 'amount', 'superb', 'entertainment', '20', 'full-length', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'bargain', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'British', 'drama', 'London', 'fashion', 'industry', 'seamstress', 'industry', 'giants', 'meet', 'learn', 'love', 'hate', 'people', 'work', 'create', 'exclusive', 'fashions.It', 'delight', 'Bea', 'Evie', 'beautiful', 'unwed', 'Eliott', 'sisters', 'become', 'viewer', 'family', 'Splendid', 'acting', 'one', 'run', 'gambit', 'emotion', 'Bea', 'Evie', 'struggle', 'succeed', 'first', 'one-then', 'other', 'decade', 'trying', 'rise', 'odds', 'Being', 'sheltered', 'uneducated', 'two', 'find', 'early', '1920', 'means', 'exhausted', 'estate', 'only', 'sewing', 'skills', 'place', 'education', 'was', 'society', 'episodes', 'face', 'hard', 'road', 'finding', 'love', 'face', 'hard', 'road', 'financial', 'success', 'A', 'fantastic', 'story', 'ladies', 'taking', 'world', 'usi8ng', 'beauty', 'talent', 'intellect', 'WINNING', 'Unsurpassed', '20s', 'costuming', 'sets', 'Experience', 'NOT', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'Sensual', 'Twenties.34', 'pass', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'one', 'desire', 'more', 'Eliott', 'family', 'done', 'episodes', 'are', 'completed', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'own', 'loss', 'EXCEPT', 'return', 'disc', 'one', 'start', 'again', 'good.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'extra', '2005', 'interview', 'Louise', 'Lombard', 'CSI', 'who', 'played', 'Evie', 'Eliott', 'show', 'moments', 'interview', 'time', 'only', '4', 'days', 'delivery', 'baby', 'Lombard', 'was', 'also', 'Black', 'Velvet', 'Gown', 'film', 'made', 'book', 'Catherine', 'Cookson', 'Any', 'Cookson', 'movie', 'recommended.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'viewers', 'very', 'early', 'look', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Circle', 'Friends', 'was', 'cast', 'second', 'receptionist', 'Jack', 'photo', 'studio.This', 'first-rate', 'series', 'proven', 'presentation', 'BBC', 'A', 'E', 'PBS', 'BBC', 'America', 'receiving', 'costume', 'design', 'awards', 'Emmy', 'BAFTA']",The House of Eliott - Complete Collection

Top marks go for the camera work and the obvious pains that were taken with the costumes and the old cars.  However we did notice that it was usually the same taxi that drew up to deposit or receive the visitors to the HoE.The heavy dose of HoE brought certain things to our attention.  One of them was the event-crammed script; obviously designed to hold a grip on the viewers during the week that elapsed between one epidode and the next. There were innumerable sub-plots and characters who strutted the stage for a few episodes and were then summarily removed by death or disgrace or both.  The Sebastian character was good and so was the astute old financier ""Sir Desmond"", but out they went.Accents? Hmmm.Those who listen to old records of the 1920s or watch sound movies from that era, will know that the upper class accent was very very different from the broad cockney London accent.  Today most people in the London area have an accent (Estuary English) which is neither one thing nor the other.  Louise Lombard's Estuary accent would have raised eyebrows in the polite society of the 1920s and ""Evangeline"" would have been obliged to take elocution lessons if the HoE was to remain in respectable business.Stella Gonet's accent might have passed muster 90 years ago, but there were some oddities that kept cropping up, for example her pronunciation of ""appreciate"".  According to general practice (and the Oxford English Dictionary) the c in that word is sounded as ""-ch-"".  Persistently Ms. Gonet pronounced the word as ""appreessiate"".  This would hardly have been noticeable to the viewer of a single episode, but it grated quite a bit when the whole set of episodes was viewed over a week.Our advice to would-be purchasers of HoE is the same as the doctor's advice on prescription drugs: take the pills one at a time rather than swallowing them all at once.  When we get around to watching HoE again, we'll follow that advice.",3,Don't take all the pills at once,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2254,"['family', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'HoE', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Amazon', 'purchase', 'looked', 'forward', 'being', 'able', 'repeat', 'experience', 'decided', 'perhaps', 'rashly', 'view', 'entire', 'set', '30', 'episodes', 'period', 'week', 'three', 'four', 'evening.Our', 'impressions', 'were', 'mixed', 'Top', 'marks', 'go', 'camera', 'work', 'obvious', 'pains', 'were', 'taken', 'costumes', 'old', 'cars', 'However', 'did', 'notice', 'was', 'usually', 'same', 'taxi', 'drew', 'up', 'deposit', 'receive', 'visitors', 'HoE.The', 'heavy', 'dose', 'HoE', 'brought', 'certain', 'things', 'attention', 'One', 'was', 'event-crammed', 'script', 'obviously', 'designed', 'hold', 'grip', 'viewers', 'week', 'elapsed', 'one', 'epidode', 'next', 'were', 'innumerable', 'sub-plots', 'characters', 'who', 'strutted', 'stage', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'then', 'summarily', 'removed', 'death', 'disgrace', 'Sebastian', 'character', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'was', 'astute', 'old', 'financier', 'Sir', 'Desmond', 'went.Accents', 'Hmmm.Those', 'who', 'listen', 'old', 'records', '1920s', 'watch', 'sound', 'movies', 'era', 'will', 'know', 'upper', 'class', 'accent', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'broad', 'cockney', 'London', 'accent', 'most', 'people', 'London', 'area', 'have', 'accent', 'Estuary', 'English', 'one', 'thing', 'other', 'Louise', 'Lombard', 'Estuary', 'accent', 'would', 'have', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'polite', 'society', '1920s', 'Evangeline', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obliged', 'take', 'elocution', 'lessons', 'HoE', 'was', 'remain', 'respectable', 'business.Stella', 'Gonet', 'accent', 'might', 'have', 'passed', 'muster', '90', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'oddities', 'kept', 'cropping', 'up', 'example', 'pronunciation', 'appreciate', 'According', 'general', 'practice', 'Oxford', 'English', 'Dictionary', 'c', 'word', 'sounded', '-ch-', 'Persistently', 'Ms.', 'Gonet', 'pronounced', 'word', 'appreessiate', 'would', 'hardly', 'have', 'been', 'noticeable', 'viewer', 'single', 'episode', 'grated', 'quite', 'bit', 'when', 'whole', 'set', 'episodes', 'was', 'viewed', 'week.Our', 'advice', 'would-be', 'purchasers', 'HoE', 'same', 'doctor', 'advice', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'take', 'pills', 'one', 'time', 'rather', 'swallowing', 'once', 'When', 'get', 'watching', 'HoE', 'again', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'advice']",The House of Eliott - Complete Collection

1069796,A6Z969DHDXPCR,B000PC6YUI,Medusa,"[6, 19]","*SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!*The story line itself was rather formulaic, two young women who were denied an education by their tight fisted, philandering father, struggled to make a name for themselves in the fashion industry.  The attention to detail on set and especially w/the clothing was exact and the actresses wore their clothing well.  Each is beautiful in their own way; neither, however, is outstanding as an actress.I think that part of the problem is in viewing several episodes in one sitting.  That's when you can see all the flaws that become difficult to overlook, such as Evie working at her drawing board, becoming frustrated and crumpling the paper and throwing it on the floor or having words w/sister Bea and shouting in anger, storming out of the room and then taking two steps, turning around and saying ""I'm sorry"".  After a while, it became monotonous.As for the ending, it didn't leave me hanging as others have stated.  Bea and Jack were married and Jack had won a seat in Parliament.  Evie decided to stay in England to fight progress w/in the company rather than join her husband in Paris, so he, too, decided to stay by her side in England.  The only characters whose futures were undecided were Tillie and her husband.  Tillie left the House of Eliott to take a position as companion to an elderly disabled woman and her husband was to be the chauffeur and all around helper but those jobs fell through.  That's life.  Not everything turns out the way we want it to.  However, given that Tillie had been a loyal employee in the House of Eliott from the beginning, had the series continued, doubtless she would've been rehired and her husband would've been hired as the driver for the company.I seriously thought that the story line would develop that Evie would confess that she was a lesbian.  Each episode saw her becoming increasingly masculine, although beautiful and stunning in her new creations.  She even walked like a man w/her hands down at her side in a half fist.  Combined w/her football calves and her interest in a lesbian couple that was dancing in a club, it would've been the perfect opportunity to see where that story line would go.  By the end of the series, she looked more like a man than a woman.I liked the House of Eliott but it just isn't 5 star worthy.",3,Three stars is the best I can do,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,2304,"['*SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'AHEAD', '*The', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'denied', 'education', 'tight', 'fisted', 'philandering', 'father', 'struggled', 'make', 'name', 'fashion', 'industry', 'attention', 'detail', 'set', 'especially', 'w/the', 'clothing', 'was', 'exact', 'actresses', 'wore', 'clothing', 'well', 'beautiful', 'own', 'way', 'however', 'outstanding', 'actress.I', 'think', 'part', 'problem', 'viewing', 'several', 'episodes', 'one', 'sitting', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'flaws', 'become', 'difficult', 'overlook', 'such', 'Evie', 'working', 'drawing', 'board', 'becoming', 'frustrated', 'crumpling', 'paper', 'throwing', 'floor', 'having', 'words', 'w/sister', 'Bea', 'shouting', 'anger', 'storming', 'room', 'then', 'taking', 'two', 'steps', 'turning', 'around', 'saying', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'while', 'became', 'monotonous.As', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'hanging', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'Bea', 'Jack', 'were', 'married', 'Jack', 'had', 'won', 'seat', 'Parliament', 'Evie', 'decided', 'stay', 'England', 'fight', 'progress', 'company', 'rather', 'join', 'husband', 'Paris', 'too', 'decided', 'stay', 'side', 'England', 'only', 'characters', 'futures', 'were', 'undecided', 'were', 'Tillie', 'husband', 'Tillie', 'left', 'House', 'Eliott', 'take', 'position', 'companion', 'elderly', 'disabled', 'woman', 'husband', 'was', 'be', 'chauffeur', 'helper', 'jobs', 'fell', 'life', 'Not', 'everything', 'out', 'way', 'want', 'However', 'given', 'Tillie', 'had', 'been', 'loyal', 'employee', 'House', 'Eliott', 'beginning', 'had', 'series', 'continued', 'doubtless', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'rehired', 'husband', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hired', 'driver', 'company.I', 'seriously', 'thought', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'develop', 'Evie', 'would', 'confess', 'was', 'lesbian', 'episode', 'saw', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'masculine', 'beautiful', 'stunning', 'new', 'creations', 'even', 'walked', 'man', 'w/her', 'down', 'side', 'half', 'fist', 'Combined', 'w/her', 'football', 'calves', 'interest', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'was', 'dancing', 'club', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'see', 'where', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'go', 'end', 'series', 'looked', 'more', 'man', 'woman.I', 'liked', 'House', 'Eliott', 'just', ""n't"", '5', 'star', 'worthy']",The House of Eliott - Complete Collection

1069801,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B000PC6YUI,Scott FS,"[5, 6]","The House of Elliot is an enjoyable series about two sisters who were basically disenfranchised from their father after his death, who needed to rise out of poverty and disgrace, and found it in the world of fashion.  The younger sister, Evangeline has a serious eye for fashion, and the savvy and talent to make it into a career, with help and guidance from her older sister Beatrice.I am a fan of period dramas, so I was interested in this series.  It's set in the 20th century and reflects the age of flappers, professional photographers, and aeroplanes.  It also features a few cads and scoundrels who try to take advantage of the disgraceful state the girl's father left them in, by giving money to unknown relatives rather than providing for them.Thankfully, the sisters are up to the task of making it on their own.  After a few fits and starts learning the ropes of the fashion design industry, the girls try to make it on their own.  With the moral and financial support of a neighbor, the always-smiling and always sunny Jack Maddox (the photographer, who gives Beatrice her first job) and Evangeline's godfather Sir Desmond Gillespie, the two finally scrape together enough money to open their own custom fashion design house, able to imagine, create, sew and sell haute couture fashions to the rich and famous females of London.Several other memorable characters appear through out the series, including aunt Lydia, her father's sister, aunt Lydia's rather disreputable son, attorney Arthur, and Jack Maddox's rather tedious do-gooder Penelope Maddox.Recommended.
