598082,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLCS,A Customer,"[5, 6]","Summary:Siddalee 'Sidda' Walker (Sandra Bullock) is a successful playwright in New York whose mother, Viviane 'Vivi' Abbott Walker (Ellen Burstyn - older; Ashley Judd - younger), has left some very deep, emotional scars on her.  When Sidda happens to reveal some of these emotional scars to a Time magazine correspondent who later publishes them, Vivi is deeply offended and cuts off contact with her daughter.  It then becomes the responsiblity of Vivi's group of friends, the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (Shirley Knight, Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan), to intervene and bring Sidda and Vivi back together before Sidda's wedding to Connor McGill (Angus MacFadyen).In order to bring the two back together, the Ya-Yas (as they call themselves) go to New York, kidnap Sidda, and bring her back to Louisiana.  They then keep her quasi locked up while she is forced to experience the history of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood through their record book.  Along with the pictures in the book, the Ya-Yas tell her stories, leading up to the climactic story of when Vivi had a nervous breakdown, nearly killed her kids, including Sidda and her siblings, and ultimately ended up in a mental hospital.  Apparently Siddha was unaware of a lot of what was going on and, as a result, has held deep seated resentments toward her mother for a long time.Eventually Siddha and Vivi are able to come to grips with what has happened.  Siddha realizes that her mother wasn't perfect and Vivi admits to not being perfect.  Having found some resolution to the emotional turmoil that has upset them for so long they are finally able to let the past go and love each other once again.My Comments:I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be a 'chick-flick' that I wasn't going to like.  I came out regretting my initial sentiments.The story itself is really pretty simple.  The hardest part, perhaps, is just making sure that all of the flashbacks fit into the present.  There are a few places where things don't make a lot of sense and some additional information would have been useful, like, for instance, more information on Vivi's family - Why her mother hated her and why her father loved her so much?  It also would have been nice to have more information on why Vivi ended up marrying Shepherd 'Shep' Walker (James Garner - older; David Lee Smith - younger).  Without really understanding the backstory to Vivi it is a bit hard to understand why she had the nervous breakdown, but I don't know that you can ever fully explain why someone had one - you can just start to come to grips with the fact that it happened and the ramifications of it.  So, despite not having all of the information I would have liked to Vivi's backstory, the story was pretty good.  The only other thing I think I should mention is that it would also have been nice to see how this blow-up between Siddha and Vivi affected Siddha's siblings.  Even though she was the oldest, they were all probably old enough to remember at least some of the things that happened (this may be addressed in the book).As for the acting, I was very impressed.  I've never really thought Sandra Bullock was a great actress.  So, when I saw that she was the main character in this film, or at least, was supposed to be, I was a bit worried.  Well, she was okay, but she really isn't the actress to watch.  Ashley Judd is the one who really has to push the limits of her acting ability and she does a great job.  I think Ashley Judd has a lot of talent and was a very convincing younger Vivi, including the time during the emotional breakdown.  The older Ya-Yas were also very good.  Whenever they were on screen they pretty much stole the show from everyone else which, again, I can't say I minded because I'm not a huge fan of Sandra Bullock.  The one person who I wish would have had more screen time but did great with what he had was James Garner, who truly did a great job of playing the role of a saintly husband who put up with a lot.Overall, I surprised myself by finding ways to relate with this film.  I would suspect that pretty much every child holds some resentments towards their parents.  I know this is a bit Freudian, but those feelings can later emerge as relevant to people's attitudes towards their parents and life in general.  I think this movie (which is based on a book) does a great job of dealing with those issues and illustrating how devastating they really can be.  I highly doubt that any parent can prevent their kids from having issues with them, but this does give a good example of how those issues can be addressed at a later point, when both are adults and able to better understand how one's actions affected the other.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the movie and all of this psycho-babble Freudian analysis isn't really there, but I think it is.  Anyway, it is a movie that tugs on the heart strings, but I think most people can relate to the reasons why.  Because of that I would recommend this movie for pretty much anyone that has a mother, which means everyone (whether you know who she is/was or not).",4,Surprisingly not too bad,1061164800,"08 18,

First of all, Ellen Burstyn and Sandra Bullock have great and exciting chemistry as the bickering mother and daughter. Ashley Judd plays Burstyn's character as the film travels back in time, and boy Judd's acting is brilliant and don't say that often about her.

I suppose this film is aimed at primarily older women.  After watching the film though, I found it touching and insightful.  The primary conflict is generated when Sidda (Bullock), a successful playwright, has an interview by Time magazine which gets published and sounds harsher than it really should.  Sidda talks about her difficult (and traumatic) childhood growing up with Vivi (Burstyn).  Naturally Vivi reads this article and is deeply hurt/offended (""you ungrateful..."")  That's where this adventure begins with a series of flashbacks dating back to when Vivi was head priestess for her secret sisterhood of gal pals.  Definitely a chick flick.  But, hey, I'm a guy and I enjoyed it because of the funny storyline and good acting.But what really gnawed at my heart was the thought of having to live a life wondering what one did wrong.  In the case of Sidda, she blames herself for having such a horrible/painful childhood.  Little does she know that she's not to blame.  Growing up in a single parent family, sometimes I wonder if I was the cause of any of it.  Was there anything I could've changed to make things better?  I'm old enough now to understand that it was a mutual decision that no one could've affected the outcome of.  Though this film has been dubbed a drama, it certainly has its light comedic moments as well.If you're old enough to remember The Golden Girls on TV (and perhaps even found the show funny), then you'll probably enjoy this film as wellLEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (cute)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 3.5 (What's the source of all the pent up anger?

I found it ok, not great, and was surprised that it became such a phenomenal best-seller.  However, I just had to see the movie and have to say I think the movie actually improved on the book.  Ashley Judd was the stand-out performer in her role as the young adult Vivi.  She expressed all the pent-up frustration, the emptiness, and the loneliness that led Vivi to her breakdown. Ellen Burstyn was also memorable as the older and often ditzy Vivi. The other Ya-Yas (Fionnula Flannagan, Maggie Smith, and Shirley Knight) were all endearing though it took a large suspension of belief to accept Maggie Smith as a Southern belle.  They showed the unconditional love that binds women and had many humorous moments that lifted the film from its otherwise heavy message.The movie opens with one of its most pricless scenes---the young Ya-Yas beginning their secret society--- and keeps that richly textured friendship in evidence throughout the entire film. It closes with another potentially rich scene which doesn't quite become the tear-jerker I expected it to be, but does tie up the Vivi/Sidalee relationship quite nicely.This is a definite chick flick to see with your girlfriends or adult daughters.

Maggie Smith was also good as was Ellen Burstyn, but here character was really stupid and annoying. Her character was a huge drama queen, but it was way too over-the-top. I do not think a mother would burn and cut out picturesw of her daughter no matter how angry she was with her. Sandra Bullock was pretty good, but her accent kept on appearing heavily and reappearing. Maybe it was supposed to have gone away from living in New York. This movie was also a little long.

When the daughter of one of them (Sandra Bullock), a successful playright, has an interview with Time magazine in which she blasts her mother's impact on her life, the mother (Ellen Burstyn, who is superb!) goes ballistic, cutting the daughter out of her life, totally. Into this maelstrom charges the other members of the Sisterhood, kidnapping Bullock, and attempting to make things right!The film then jumps back and forth in time, with Ashley Judd (who gives an Oscar-worthy performance) playing the younger Burstyn. She has a lot of happy adventures with her Ya-Ya sisters, but also has to deal with racism, a jealous religious zealot of a mother, an overly loving father (David Rasche, breaking free of his usual comic roles), a true love who dies in WWII, and a family with a guy she 'settles' for (played, in present day, by the wonderful James Garner). There is also a dark secret that is the core of the mother/daughter alienation, which must be dealt with in order for the rift between Bullock and Burstyn to heal (No, I will NOT give it away!)If you do the math about the years covered, you realize the present-day story SHOULD be taking place in the early nineties, at the latest, but this doesn't hurt the overall effectiveness of the picture. As the other present-day sisters, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight, and (especially) Maggie Smith are WONDERFUL, as is Angus MacFadyen, as Bullock's sympathetic and likable fiance.While this is unabashedly a 'chick flick', something I really liked was that they DIDN'T fall back on that old chestnut of somebody dying to serve as a convenient catalyst for change and the healing process.

Many of the major cast members were represented by actors as children, young adults and in older versions of adulthood -- not with makeup but with completely different actors in each part.I am the first to admit that it would have been a gargantuan effort to boil 60 years of living into a two hour movie. The fact that the movie is at all comprehensible says a great deal about the talent of all those involved in it's making. And I commend them for the effort....but....The saga of the Divine Ya-Ya Sisters should have been a 12 part TV mini-series. That is really the only way to get to &quot;know&quot; these complex people and do justice to the whole Ya-Ya experience.That having been said, how was the movie? I liked it a lot, with reservations. Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Ellen Burnstyn, James Garner, Shirley Knight, Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan and the truly divine Angus MacFadyen anchor the story in place and keep it moving along. The presence of such a &quot;first-rate&quot; cast assures the viewer that this was a serious attempt to tell the story and not just a way to part the viewers from their money at the box office. The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood has been a cultural phenomenon for a number of years. Several million readers of the book(s) were excited, delighted and maybe just a little apprehensive to see how the tale would play out on the screen.I can only tell you my opinion but here it is: As a reader of the books, I still had a bit of a time keeping up with the back story and can only wonder whether someone unfamiliar with the clan wouldn't have become hopelessly lost in the twists, turns and flashback format of this version. A few of the plot devices (a red airplane instead of Lawanda the elephant) I understand. Other things left out or changed were a disappointment to me. But for getting a whole complicated story told in under two hours, well, it was a pretty good effort.

The rest of the cast is stranded as the editor and director cut short any non-verbal moments that might have resonated. Ellen Burstyn and Maggie Smith manage to grab a few good moments, but not often enough to save this poorly scripted, predictable, overly melodramatic film from being very entertaining to women who read the book.Of course maybe the fact they got the book made into a movie and Callie (Thelma and Louise) Khorie got another paycheck is reason to rejoice. I hope women want movies better than this one directed at them.This one is so mediocre I started to get angry at all the missed opportunities. I mean James Garner was supposed to be under-used and yet he was so mis-used, one felt like he was being abused when he is given such thankless things to do throughout the film. Yep that's how wrong this film get the book.  It feels like a bad Neil Simon play.If you can sit still for mediocre cable t.v. movies, then you might really appreciate what how the cast attempts to over-come the limitations of a dull screenplay. There are a few good lines of dialogue but far too many flat ones.  It's hard to believe these women have much genuine rapport with each other.Misfire.

Strong acting from both Sandra Bullock and Ellen Burstyn make the movie much better than it seems.  This movie has everything anyone would want, moments that would bring a tear to the eye of the fence raising guy on the Ford commercial, and then seconds later have you rolling over in laughter.  Although Ashley Judd has not recieved fantastic reviews for her version of Vivi, who is an extremely complicated character, everyone should understand Ellen Burstyn had the character after she had established who she is, Ashley Judd actually does a wonderful job, creating who that person is.  Is she all over the map as far as acting is concerned?  ABSOLUTLEY she is not consistent, however she is playing a very inconsistent person.The movie is about Vivi, the very interesting and eccentric mother of Sidalee.  Sidalee is a very succesful writer, who in a magazine article criticizes her mother Vivi.  Well mother doesn't like this and in her fit of rage refuses to speak to her oldest daughter.  The remainder of the movie shows the YA-YA sisterhood (Vivi's closest friends), trying to show Sidalee (Sandra Bullock)why her mother is the way she is.

When Siddalee Walker [Sandra Bullock], the daughter of Vivi [Ellen Burstyn], a successful playwright, has an interview with Time magazine in which she condemns her mother's impact on her life, Vivi goes ballistic, cutting her daughter out of her life. So, the other members of the Sisterhood &quot;kidnap&quot; Siddalee, attempting to set her straight about her mother.The film then jumps back and forth in time, with Ashley Judd playing the younger Vivi. She has a lot of happy adventures with her Ya-Ya sisters, but also has to deal with a jealous mother, a true love who dies in WWII and a family with a man [played, in present day, by James Garner] she had to settle with. There is also a dark secret that is the core of the mother-daughter alienation, which must be dealt with in order for the rift between Vivi and Siddalee to heal.The entire cast is just fabulous, including the present-day sisters, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight, Maggie Smith and of course, Ellen Burstyn. The dialog is full of wickedly hilarious one-liners about men, alcohol, friendship and growing old.The DVD is wonderful. There's commentary by Ashley Judd, Callie Khouri [the director], deleted scenes, a documentary titled &quot;Unlocking the Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,&quot; Alison Krauss' music video for &quot;Sitting in the Window of My Room&quot; and a lot more!Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, sadly, did not do much box office, which was a shame, as it is a realistic vision of women and life-long friendships.

598124,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B00005JLCS,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[3, 3]","I didn't read this book, but I received the DVD as a Christmas Gift from my son, who watched the film and enjoyed it.  I didn't see the movie in the theater.  All my friends refused to go because of the title.  They knew nothing about the plot or the film, just didn't like the title.  They are from the North.Nothing is exact, all things are general, but in reading the mixed reviews of this film, it appears more southern women than their northern sisters liked the movie, and more guys than usual enjoyed a chick-flick.  There is no way to avoid this IS a chick-flick, but it does hit the mark (under some of the excessive props) about the relationships that are interwoven into a woman's life (OK, mostly a SOUTHERN woman's life).  Being originally from the South (Florida is only geographically south), I understood this story from the perspective of my youth, but admit I know next to nothing about how most northern females spent their time growing up.There are some very good things about this film.  The music is absolutely wonderful.  A lot of thought went into selecting just the right music and that work and attention to detail shows.  Sandra Bullock finally had a role as an adult.  Ashley Judd gave her best performance ever.  The casting through the multiple layers of flash-backs was superb.  Watching Ashley in certain specific scenes you felt as if you were magically watching scenes Ellyn Burstyn filmed in the days of her youth and also we feel we know exactly how Ashley will age, the gestures, the voice, and facial expressions were phenomenal....great work.Viewers believing these characterizations are overdrawn or 'unbelievable' should meet the mother of one of my friends...she is Vivi (Ellen Burstyn).  Once again I felt some magic was going on and I was watching my friend's mother on the screen.  The members of the sisterhood had various personalities, but they were real and true-to-life, they complimented one another, and they never stood in the way of true friendship.The relationship between mothers and daughters is a delicate one to be sure, but one to be treasured.  Viewing this film with your mother and discussing it with her in detail would definitely add to pleasure to be gained from the experience of seeing this movie.  This plot line displays beautifully how painfully little some daughters know about the real history of their mother's past and their mother's psyche.  Time and social changes definitely wreak havoc in relationships between members of varying generations.  Secrets and shame water the individual personal-history details until these life experiences grow into weed-infested shrub fences between the generations. Thus the value of friends.  Life-long friends who will intercede to cut back the fences, reveal the secrets, and mend the damages of time.  Everyone needs this type of friend, some of us have them and some don't.  Those that do, should treasure them.A word about the men.  Southern men do seem to understand female qualities and relationships a little more than their northern counterparts.  James Garner was perfectly cast in his role as Shep Walker, Vivi's husband.  After all he is James Garner, extremely capable actor, not Maverick, you know, that was just another role.  The love he felt for Vivi was apparent both in the flashbacks and present day scenes.  When a woman has a man who understands her, accepts her for who she is, and loves her because and in spite of it, he too is to be treasured.  Sidda (Sandra Bullock) had such a man in her life in the character of Connor (Angus MacFadyen) which is why he was willing to cooperate with the sisterhood to help the woman he loved smooth out the wrinkles in her mother/daughter relationship, thus paving the way to finally attaining his own future happiness.  That he understood that particular need was an asset to his personality, one that all men don't possess, and Connor wasn't even from the south.The DVD contains some very interesting commentaries and featurettes and the friendships that grew during the filming between the females playing the various roles at different ages, regardless of their true chronological age, becomes very apparent in many ways in the special features.It is no secret that women are different from men, that is a positive thing, and this film celebrates these differences and reflects on some of the specific problems and some of the very special pleasures women experience because they are female.  View the film, learn from it, be reminded by it, enjoy it.  Not a perfect film for sure, but one that does a splendid job at portraying southern woman; warts, wonderfulness, and all.",3,Secrets from a Ya Ya....,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",2002,4654,"['did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'received', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'Gift', 'son', 'who', 'watched', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'friends', 'refused', 'go', 'title', 'knew', 'nothing', 'plot', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'title', 'are', 'North.Nothing', 'exact', 'things', 'are', 'general', 'reading', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'film', 'more', 'southern', 'women', 'northern', 'sisters', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'guys', 'usual', 'enjoyed', 'chick-flick', 'way', 'avoid', 'chick-flick', 'hit', 'mark', 'excessive', 'props', 'relationships', 'are', 'interwoven', 'woman', 'life', 'OK', 'mostly', 'SOUTHERN', 'woman', 'life', 'Being', 'originally', 'South', 'Florida', 'only', 'geographically', 'south', 'understood', 'story', 'perspective', 'youth', 'admit', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'how', 'most', 'northern', 'females', 'spent', 'time', 'growing', 'up.There', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'music', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'lot', 'thought', 'went', 'selecting', 'just', 'right', 'music', 'work', 'attention', 'detail', 'shows', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'finally', 'had', 'role', 'adult', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'casting', 'multiple', 'layers', 'flash-backs', 'was', 'superb', 'Watching', 'Ashley', 'certain', 'specific', 'scenes', 'felt', 'were', 'magically', 'watching', 'scenes', 'Ellyn', 'Burstyn', 'filmed', 'days', 'youth', 'also', 'feel', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'Ashley', 'will', 'age', 'gestures', 'voice', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'phenomenal', '.great', 'work.Viewers', 'believing', 'characterizations', 'are', 'overdrawn', ""'unbelievable"", 'should', 'meet', 'mother', 'one', 'friends', 'Vivi', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Once', 'again', 'felt', 'magic', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'watching', 'friend', 'mother', 'screen', 'members', 'sisterhood', 'had', 'various', 'personalities', 'were', 'real', 'true-to-life', 'complimented', 'one', 'never', 'stood', 'way', 'true', 'friendship.The', 'relationship', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'delicate', 'one', 'be', 'sure', 'one', 'be', 'treasured', 'Viewing', 'film', 'mother', 'discussing', 'detail', 'would', 'definitely', 'add', 'pleasure', 'be', 'gained', 'experience', 'seeing', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'displays', 'beautifully', 'how', 'painfully', 'little', 'daughters', 'know', 'real', 'history', 'mother', 'past', 'mother', 'psyche', 'Time', 'social', 'changes', 'definitely', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'relationships', 'members', 'varying', 'generations', 'Secrets', 'shame', 'water', 'individual', 'personal-history', 'details', 'life', 'experiences', 'grow', 'weed-infested', 'shrub', 'fences', 'generations', 'Thus', 'value', 'friends', 'Life-long', 'friends', 'who', 'will', 'intercede', 'cut', 'back', 'fences', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'mend', 'damages', 'time', 'Everyone', 'type', 'friend', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'should', 'treasure', 'them.A', 'word', 'men', 'Southern', 'men', 'do', 'seem', 'understand', 'female', 'qualities', 'little', 'more', 'northern', 'counterparts', 'James', 'Garner', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'Shep', 'Walker', 'Vivi', 'husband', 'James', 'Garner', 'extremely', 'capable', 'actor', 'not', 'Maverick', 'know', 'was', 'just', 'role', 'love', 'felt', 'Vivi', 'was', 'apparent', 'flashbacks', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'When', 'woman', 'man', 'who', 'who', 'because', 'spite', 'too', 'be', 'treasured', 'Sidda', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'had', 'such', 'man', 'life', 'character', 'Connor', 'Angus', 'MacFadyen', 'why', 'was', 'willing', 'cooperate', 'sisterhood', 'help', 'woman', 'loved', 'out', 'wrinkles', 'mother/daughter', 'relationship', 'thus', 'paving', 'way', 'finally', 'attaining', 'own', 'future', 'happiness', 'understood', 'particular', 'need', 'was', 'asset', 'personality', 'one', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'possess', 'Connor', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'south.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'interesting', 'commentaries', 'featurettes', 'friendships', 'grew', 'filming', 'females', 'playing', 'various', 'roles', 'different', 'ages', 'regardless', 'true', 'chronological', 'age', 'very', 'apparent', 'many', 'ways', 'special', 'features.It', 'secret', 'women', 'are', 'different', 'men', 'positive', 'thing', 'film', 'differences', 'specific', 'problems', 'very', 'special', 'pleasures', 'women', 'experience', 'are', 'female', 'View', 'film', 'learn', 'be', 'reminded', 'Not', 'perfect', 'film', 'sure', 'one', 'splendid', 'job', 'portraying', 'southern', 'woman', 'warts', 'wonderfulness']",N/A

I very much enjoyed this tale from start to finish.  It rang so clear on so many levels.... Separately and at the same time a tour de force about friendship, love, motherhood, secrets, the power of emotions and broken hearts and the unspoken and truth.Ashley Judd and Ellen Burstyn both play their role(s) commandingly well.  James Garner also stands out as the understated Shep.There were certain questions I had, like ""Where are the other three children, all grown up?"" but in a two hour movie sometimes pieces aren't all explained.I loved seeing The South as another character and the relationships between Vivi and all the people around her... from early childhood until we see her birthday party so many years later.I watched this with my 12-year-old daughter and was a bit concerned about the ""expressive"" language (read a plethora of four letter words and I don't mean ""love"" although that is said, too, as is fear).  Probably the most appropriate scene using bad language was between Vivi and Teensie during a ""chicken-esque"" car scene.... I said to my daughter, ""Ya know? You've got to be really good friends to be able to talk to each other that way.""My daughter's response: ""Yup, and to know you really don't mean it.""I would have liked to see a bit of a tighter performance from Sandra Bullock but with such a great group of actresses surrounding her... it would have been tough for anyone.I highly recommend this one, especially for a ""girl's night out"" or ""mother-daughter night.""",4,"Grab your Girlfriends, Some Popcorn and an Umbrella'd Drink",1080345600,"03 27, 2004",2004,1559,"['was', 'surprised', 'see', 'mediocre', 'reviews', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'tale', 'start', 'finish', 'rang', 'so', 'clear', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Separately', 'same', 'time', 'tour', 'force', 'friendship', 'love', 'motherhood', 'secrets', 'power', 'emotions', 'broken', 'hearts', 'unspoken', 'truth.Ashley', 'Judd', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'play', 'role', 'commandingly', 'well', 'James', 'Garner', 'also', 'out', 'understated', 'Shep.There', 'were', 'certain', 'questions', 'had', 'Where', 'are', 'other', 'three', 'children', 'grown', 'up', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'pieces', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained.I', 'loved', 'seeing', 'South', 'character', 'relationships', 'Vivi', 'people', 'early', 'childhood', 'see', 'birthday', 'party', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later.I', 'watched', '12-year-old', 'daughter', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'expressive', 'language', 'read', 'plethora', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'love', 'said', 'too', 'fear', 'Probably', 'most', 'appropriate', 'scene', 'using', 'bad', 'language', 'was', 'Vivi', 'Teensie', 'chicken-esque', 'car', 'scene', 'said', 'daughter', 'Ya', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'other', 'way', 'daughter', 'response', 'Yup', 'know', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'bit', 'tighter', 'performance', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'such', 'great', 'group', 'actresses', 'surrounding', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'anyone.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'especially', 'girl', 'night', 'out', 'mother-daughter', 'night']",N/A

598139,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JLCS,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This is a film about mother/daughter relationships and about unconditional love. Despite being marked by fine performances, the film never really grabs the viewer, at least, not this viewer. While moderately enjoyable, I found the film to fall a little flat, as the whole Ya-Ya thing left me cold, finding it all a bit silly.Not having read the book of the same name upon which the film is based, I  had no frame of reference. Judging strictly on the merits of the film, I found that it has its ups and downs. The name of the film is apparently derived from a childhood club to which a group of lifelong friends belonged as children in which they were all Ya-Ya priestesses.  These friends, of which Vivi (Ellyn Burstyn) is at the center of this story, are all trying to reconcile Vivi to her daughter Sidda (Sandra Bullock). The friends, as well as Vivi, are all aging southern belles from Louisiana. Sidda, however, has moved North, where she is a budding, successful playwright.Sidda had a traumatic childhood, as her mother is a mercurial woman with a drinking problem. It seems that Vivi never got over losing her childhood sweetheart during the war. She married another man, Shep Walker (James Garner), Sidda's father and a man who has loved Vivi unconditionally throughout their entire married life,  and proceeded to put her husband and her children through a living hell. Still, Vivi and Sidda manage to plod along as so many mothers and daughters do, until Vivi goes too far and Sidda decides that enough is enough.The story of Vivi, Sidda, and Shep is told in flashbacks, which provide the  most interesting parts of the movie. Ashley Judd is simply sensational as the young Vivi, and she outshines all the film and stage veterans in this film, infusing the role with a gritty reality. David Lee Smith is very good as the hunky young Shep, the husband who tries to understand a mercurial wife who has become unbalanced by her longing for what could never be.Ellen Burstyn as the senior Vivi is not as compelling as the younger one portrayed by Ashley Judd. The senior Vivi comes across as a silly, petulant, spoiled, self-absorbed woman who needs a good swift kick in the butt. Consequently, the viewer cares very little for what happens to her, even though she is eventually reconciled to her daughter and comes to appreciate her patient, selfless husband.Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, and Shirley Knight are all excellent as Vivi's lifelong friends, though Ms. Smith occasionally seems to have a bit of difficulty suppressing her British accent. They inject a touch of humor into their attempts to reconcile the estranged Vivi and Sidda, which is a good counterpoint to the underlying pathos of the film. Sandra Bullock is also excellent as the fed up Sidda, who has said that enough is enough. As in all her film, she charms the viewer. James Garner is wonderful as Vivi's long suffering husband, who comes to be appreciated by Vivi only at the end.Unfortunately, the director appears to have striven for mawkishness. Consequently, the ending of this film is enough to make one gag,  as Sidda is inducted into the Ya-Ya sisterhood. This alone is enough for me to counsel viewers to rent, and not buy, this film.",3,THERE IS NOTHING DIVINE ABOUT IT...,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,3228,"['film', 'mother/daughter', 'relationships', 'unconditional', 'love', 'being', 'marked', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'grabs', 'viewer', 'least', 'not', 'viewer', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'found', 'film', 'fall', 'little', 'flat', 'whole', 'Ya-Ya', 'thing', 'left', 'cold', 'finding', 'bit', 'silly.Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'based', 'had', 'frame', 'reference', 'Judging', 'strictly', 'merits', 'film', 'found', 'ups', 'downs', 'name', 'film', 'apparently', 'derived', 'childhood', 'club', 'group', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'belonged', 'children', 'were', 'Ya-Ya', 'priestesses', 'friends', 'Vivi', 'Ellyn', 'Burstyn', 'center', 'story', 'are', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'Vivi', 'daughter', 'Sidda', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'Vivi', 'are', 'aging', 'southern', 'belles', 'Louisiana', 'Sidda', 'however', 'moved', 'North', 'where', 'budding', 'successful', 'playwright.Sidda', 'had', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'mother', 'mercurial', 'woman', 'drinking', 'problem', 'Vivi', 'never', 'got', 'losing', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'war', 'married', 'man', 'Shep', 'Walker', 'James', 'Garner', 'Sidda', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'Vivi', 'unconditionally', 'entire', 'married', 'life', 'proceeded', 'put', 'husband', 'children', 'living', 'hell', 'Still', 'Vivi', 'Sidda', 'manage', 'plod', 'along', 'so', 'many', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'do', 'Vivi', 'too', 'far', 'Sidda', 'enough', 'enough.The', 'story', 'Vivi', 'Sidda', 'Shep', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'provide', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'movie', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'simply', 'sensational', 'young', 'Vivi', 'film', 'stage', 'veterans', 'film', 'infusing', 'role', 'gritty', 'reality', 'David', 'Lee', 'Smith', 'very', 'good', 'hunky', 'young', 'Shep', 'husband', 'who', 'understand', 'mercurial', 'wife', 'who', 'become', 'unbalanced', 'longing', 'what', 'could', 'never', 'be.Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'senior', 'Vivi', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', 'younger', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'senior', 'Vivi', 'across', 'silly', 'petulant', 'spoiled', 'self-absorbed', 'woman', 'who', 'good', 'swift', 'kick', 'butt', 'Consequently', 'viewer', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'even', 'eventually', 'reconciled', 'daughter', 'appreciate', 'patient', 'selfless', 'husband.Maggie', 'Smith', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'are', 'excellent', 'Vivi', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'Ms.', 'Smith', 'occasionally', 'have', 'bit', 'difficulty', 'suppressing', 'British', 'accent', 'inject', 'touch', 'humor', 'attempts', 'reconcile', 'estranged', 'Vivi', 'Sidda', 'good', 'counterpoint', 'underlying', 'pathos', 'film', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'also', 'excellent', 'fed', 'up', 'Sidda', 'who', 'said', 'enough', 'enough', 'film', 'viewer', 'James', 'Garner', 'wonderful', 'Vivi', 'long', 'suffering', 'husband', 'who', 'be', 'appreciated', 'Vivi', 'only', 'end.Unfortunately', 'director', 'have', 'striven', 'mawkishness', 'Consequently', 'ending', 'film', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'gag', 'Sidda', 'inducted', 'Ya-Ya', 'sisterhood', 'alone', 'enough', 'counsel', 'viewers', 'rent', 'not', 'buy', 'film']",N/A

You will learn answers to many of the mysteries of women and the world we inhabit (if only in dreams.).Imagine Charo, coochie-cooing the words YA YA! and you'll have an idea of the true meaning and fun of this movie. I will admit, I found it best to have a little knowledge of the book. But don't read the book. Listen to it. The (UNEDITED) audio version of this fine novel really gives life to the words and one can really appreciate the enunciation of the most important words about this group of life-long friends. YaYa!  (See my review of the audio tape on Amazon.com under ""ISBN: 0060094818"" and find out exactly what Charo REALLY has to do with this film.)Rebecca Wells wrote an earlier book based on similar characters and ideas, but the mother was not as likeable nor excusable. She hit the ""motherlode"" (pardon the pun!) when she penned ""The Divine Secrets...""  I would love to have these quirky women as caricatures in my life. What a gift to have this kind of lifelong communication and keepers of secrets (even though they all may need a good month at the dreaded ""Betty."")Hell, therapy would ruin their antics of these bigger than life characters. I love the southern charm of this story and yes, Steel Magnolias comes to mind. But nothing comes close to this bond, and the film is cast perfectly--unfortunately leaving no room for Shirley MacLaine's character. She couldn't do better than her role in ""Magnolias,"" no matter how far south the story may be set.In a series of stories from an amazing scrapbook (hurrah for the prop team -- the book appeared just as I imagined!) Siddha learns about her mother's past and the reason they both slam the phone against the counter when they finally answer each others' calls. The men in this movie are important characters, but are side men to the women's antics and the amazing charm these great Ya Yas have over all who meet them.The screenplay does  the best job possible while cutting out a few characters to keep the story flowing. No elephant available, but what a great view of the world the Ya Yas inhabit!  Siddha gets a return visit to the good memories while listening to the answers that mother would never had given her.... this is what the sisterhood is all about. She finds the wonder of being mothered by four deliciously free and feisty women.I wish all women could have the type of friendships these women found and hope that all daughters can find the love and support from such an open, wonderous group. I gave this to my best friend, announcing to her that she was on my YA YA list. I only hope that, after seeing this movie, you will begin the search for those lost YaYa sisters from your own past to find the joy, memories, and love this film exudes.All in all -- what fun, tragedy, enlightenment, discovery and ghosts come out of a simple event: Siddha's interview with a Time magazine writer looking for an edge to interview this up and coming playwrite.A long summer night: friends, family, entoxicating hints of shrimp gumbo, live cajun music, the scent of gardenias keep the viewer inside the world of Ya Ya! While we feel our bare toes (painted with bright red polish, of course) squishing between blades of the wonderous cushion of green green grass; we  leave as an honorary member of the Divine Secret Sisiterhood of that summer of the eternal Ya Ya .

Quido ""quidrock""","[2, 5]","with a treasured women's book.Casting was inspired, the cinematography and sets were beautifully filmed and the soundtrack was perfectly in keeping with the story, and a creative mix of artists.There is one major glitch in a film that is surprisingly well adapted from the book, and that is the focus on the present.  With less about Siddalee and her fiance, one or two more flashback gems of the Ya-yas as girls and as young mothers would have added greatly to the understanding of the ties that bind women together.  Most of the best moments are in the flashback sequences, although Ellen Burstyn, Maggie Smith and the rest of the older Ya Yas make for a strong and funny ensemble in the current day, and James Garner is completely believable as a Shep, worn down by years of living with the quicksilver Vivi.There is one scene from the past - a yard party before young Jack goes to war, where Ashley Judd as the young Vivi is so beautifully luminous in a yellow dress, that the whole novel comes alive again, and you can really believe in the power of her life force.  Sandra Bullock, on the other hand, is just adequate as Siddalee, with little of her usual sparkle, and not really believable as a product of a southern upbringing.So, I guess I really mean that I enjoyed the novel much more, which is usually the case, but that I was pleasantly surprised toenjoy this film as ""somewhat Divine"".

598153,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JLCS,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","The 2002 film &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; is based upon the similarly titled novel written by Rebecca Wells.  Directed by Callie Khouri, the film focuses primarily upon the troubled relationship of Viviane Abbott 'Vivi' Walker (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Siddalee 'Sidda' Walker (Sandra Bullock).  Having grown up in Louisiana, Sidda moved to New York City where she is a successful playwright.  An interview that Sidda gives to a magazine includes descriptions of her troubled Louisiana childhood that infuriates her mother.  In an attempt to reconcile mother and daughter, Vivi's three lifelong friends decide to intervene: Teensy Melissa Whitman (Fionnula Flanagan), Caro Eliza Bennett (Maggie Smith) and Necie Rose Kelleher (Shirley Knight).  Unknown to Vivi, they kidnap Sidda and return her to Louisiana where they explain Vivi's troubled past through a scrapbook containing the secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  The four created the sisterhood when they were children, but continued it into adulthood.  Hence, the film is filled with copious flashbacks to the foursome's childhoods in Louisiana during the Great Depression, events that occurred during World War II and events that occurred in the 1950's.  As young adults, the four friends are played by Ashley Judd (Vivi), Jacqueline McKenzie (Teensy), Katy Selverstone (Caro) and Kiersten Warren (Necie).  Sidda as a child in the 1950's is played by Allison Bertolino.  (As children during the Great Depression, the four friends are played by four child actresses.)As the above description demonstrates, the film focuses primarily upon female characters and was intended to appeal to female viewers more than male viewers.  The few male characters (all rather minor in the story) are Sidda's fianc&eacute;e Connor McGill (Angus MacFadyen), her father Shepherd 'Shep' Walker (James Garner in the present and David Lee Smith in the 1950's), and Jack (Matthew Settle).  The many flashbacks to the past in the film are edited well with the events that occur in the present, but the film's portrayal of mental illness could have been better.  The film could also have had much better male character development, especially with Shep, who comes across as being nothing more than a completely henpecked and domineered husband.

Excellently directed and superbly produced, DSYYS takes the viewer through the turbulent relationship between mother and daughter and the friends who try to keep them together.  Through flashbacks, we see what made this relationship so temultuous but also see how the relationship blossomed in less troubled days.This film is not a chick flick.  This film is about relationships.  It's about the relationship between parent and child.  We all have them.  Whether we have good relationships with our parents/children or not, this film will bring a healing to the soul that nothing else can.Yes, there is a moral to this film.  There is a resolution.

598158,A3DE9GQDO6O6D1,B00005JLCS,"Nancy R. Katz ""NancyK18""","[5, 9]","I have just returned from seeing Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood and am already making plans to see this movie again.  To sum it up, I LOVED THIS MOVIE and heartily recommend it to  everyone. Based on the books Little Altars Everywhere and The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood by Rebecca Wells, this movie is a rare blend of poignancy and comedy performed beautifully by the cast which includes Ellen Burstyn, Ashley Judd and Sandra Bullock.By now many readers are familiar with the story of how Divine Secrets, written and published after Little Altars Everywhere, was sold primarily through word of mouth first by booksellers and then by readers around the country.  Appealing to women and their sense of camaraderie, the book was immediately sought after by reading groups and Ya-Ya groups began springing up around the country. Perhaps they were the late 90's answer to the earlier feminist consciousness raising groups but many readers seemed to have a need to get in touch with their feminine side and girlfriends after reading these books. And when plans for the movie were announced, many pleased readers couldn't wait to see how the movie transfered to the screen.  While I read and loved Little Altars Everywhere, I held off on reading The Divine Screts of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood for some reason and am now I'm wondering if the book is as good as the movie.In the movie, directed by Callie Khouri who also directed Thelma and Louise, Ellen Busrstyn plays Vivi Walker a Southern belle from Louisiana and one of the Ya-Yas.  The Ya-Yas are a group of women friends who have been there for each other for more years than they care to admit to. Spanning over 50 years, the movie shifts from present times to ther past as we watch scenes from both books.  And as we watch, we get an idea what the Ya-Yas are all about as we first glimpse them as young girls to their loves during WWII to the women as young mothers and finally to the present when Vivi is in a rage and about to disown her oldest child.  Seems as thogh Siddalee, an up and coming director, when interviewed by a magazine was quoted as saying her mother is, ""one of the most charming wounded people in the world and also dangerous.""  Now it is up to the other three Ya-Yas to inform Siddalee about the Ya-Yas and in a bold move they kidnap her from her home and lover to a cabin in Louisiana.  It is there, over a period of a few days, that Sidalee learns about the Ya-Yas ands their divine secrets. And as the viewer watches these scenes play out one can't help but marvel at the fine cast.  We watch Ashley Judd play the young high spirited Vivi to perfection and then Ellyn Burstyn as the older and still vibrant Ya-Ya and mother. Sidalee is played by Sandra Bullock and the other Ya-Yas are played by Maggie Smith, who totes around an oxygen tank for her emphysema, Shirley Knight and Fionnula Flanagan who I remember as Clothilde from Rich Man, Poor Man. Even James Garner as Shep, Viv's husband seemed to be the right choice.This film has beautifully crafted scenes which I won't forget too soon. From the first one where we watch as the young Ya-Yas pledge allegiance to one another to a wonderful scene late in the movie between mother and daughter where the divine secret is revealed, you'll think about your own Ya-Ya Sisterhood and laugh and cry.This is one of those movies which stays wih you long after you leave the theater. See the movie. You may even want to read the books. And then ask yourselves if if you don't agree with me that the Ya-Yas are wacky, fun, infectious, sad, confusing, confounding but always lovable.  I bet you'll also agree with me when I say again YEAH YEAH FOR THE DIVINE SECXRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD!While this movie has been termed a chick flick or mother daughter film it is truly a wonderful represntation of what women mean to erach other.

I would have preferred a script more true to the book. With careful editing, the movie could have been as good as the book, but instead it tries to cover too much.

They are now easier to stomach without getting overly sappy.A mother and daughter reflect on their past after the daughter's commentary in a magazine sparks up the mother's bitterness.The mother, played by Ellen Burstyn in the present time and by Ashley Judd in the past, has kept a few too many secrets from her daughter; and, it takes the assistance of three of the mother's closest friends, the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, to make amends between the two.I admit that I am not the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world.  But, after seeing this movie, I believe she will finally get that Oscar nomination she's been looking for.. as well as Ellen, Ashley, and Maggie Smith who plays Caro, one of the friends in need.I did not see one bad performance out of any of the cast, child actors included.

Not everyone isa disciple, as demonstrated by a recent tongue in cheekjoke made on the Daily Show With Jon Stewart.Here, Ashley Judd reprises once more her type-cast role ofsomeone having a delinquent side to her personality, (asalso seen in several other movies in which she's aprotagonist), and does a fine job in playing the role ofa woman, reminiscing biographically of the highs and lowsof her life, when her own daughter decides to get marriedand and enter an adulthood of her own.

She has to deal withthat, in view of reestablishing a relationship with ownfamily, that for many years had grown distant, cold andconfrontational.

I gather from other reviewers that the book was a lot better than the film.  No surprise there.  I think that the script is smart and has a lot of potential.The cast that was assembled is certainly loaded with talent.  I don't know why it wasn't better.For me, the two central characters just lacked something to engage my sympathy.  Sandra Bullock who is a terrific actress and whose performances in other films have been almost entrancing, just didn't grab me here.  First of all, I couldn't imagine her as a successful, powerful playwright.  Then she was so lackluster, I just didn't care about her.  Her Irish boyfriend was terrific though.I think what really dimmed the film for me was the performance of  Ellen Burstyn. She was so unlikable that again, I really wanted to get her off the screen.

598173,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLCS,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 9]","**1/2 ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" will remind you of how much fun ""Steel Magnolias"" was.  This latest helping of deep-fried Southern cornpone does have a few pertinent observations to make about dysfunctional mother/daughter relationships, but the artificiality of the whole enterprise robs the film of any real significance it might have had (""Steel Magnolias"" was artificial too, but at least it had a hell of a funny script to render the absurdity enjoyable.  ""Sisterhood"" is not nearly so generous in the laugh department).Sandra Bullock stars as Sidda Walker, a successful playwright whose relationship with her mother - the fiery, temperamental and mercurial Vivi - has been anything but smooth sailing.  After Vivi reads Sidda's comments about her in a TIME Magazine interview - in which she appears to blame her mother for her unhappy childhood - a serious rift develops between mother and daughter.  In an attempt to heal the breach, Vivi's three lifelong pals - the girls with whom she helped found the secret order of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood - decide to perform an emergency ""intervention.""  They ""kidnap"" Sidda for the time being and force her to confront the truths about her mother in the hopes that Sidda will understand her better.  This set-up paves the way for the film to go flashbacking all over the map, as Vivi, Sidda, her father and a whole host of other people conjure up the memories that ultimately reveal the true picture of Vivi's troubled life.""Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" despite the best of intentions perhaps, has phoniness stamped all over it, starting with the whole cutesy Ya-Ya Sister nonsense.  Any film that features four grown women gathered in a candlelit circle, wearing makeshift bejeweled hats, making blood pacts and periodically yelling out ""Ya-ya"" to one another is already pushing too hard to try to win us over.  I also guess we're supposed to think it's cute when these three older women spike Sidda's drink in a bar, drag her unconscious onto an airplane (with her fianc&eacute;'s full approval, apparently), and hold her ""hostage"" in a home in Louisiana.  That Sidda doesn't just tell them all to go to hell and run out the front door is the strangest mystery the film has to offer.In actuality, ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" does have a few meaningful moments.  These occur most frequently when the characters are allowed to settle down and do some quite reflecting, most notably Vivi herself, either in her current incarnation as harridan supreme (brilliantly enacted by Ellen Burstyn) or in her previous one as a well-meaning young mother coping with personal tragedy and mental illness (Ashley Judd plays her in these scenes and one is struck by just how easily, in facial terms at least, she might well grow up to be Burstyn.  It's a good match).  Some of the flashbacks, in particular, are searing in their portrayal of actual emotional pain, so much so that we feel further demeaned every time the film foists another of those cutesy, folksy moments of eccentric humor on us - which happens far too often I'm afraid.  When all is said and done, the serious message of the film simply becomes buried under all the funny hats, mumbled incantations, phone banging, pie throwing, drug imbibing that end up defining the m&eacute;tier of the project.""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" feels like two movies actually - the quiet one which wins us over with its subtlety and charm and the loud one which repels us with its self-consciousness and corniness.  Sorry to say it's the second movie that ultimately emerges victorious.",2,"Not  much ""divine"" here",1038528000,"11 29, 2002",2002,3582,"['**1/2', 'Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'will', 'remind', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'was', 'latest', 'helping', 'deep-fried', 'Southern', 'cornpone', 'have', 'few', 'pertinent', 'observations', 'make', 'dysfunctional', 'mother/daughter', 'relationships', 'artificiality', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'film', 'real', 'significance', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'was', 'artificial', 'too', 'least', 'had', 'hell', 'funny', 'script', 'render', 'absurdity', 'enjoyable', 'Sisterhood', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'generous', 'laugh', 'department', '.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'stars', 'Sidda', 'Walker', 'successful', 'playwright', 'relationship', 'mother', 'fiery', 'temperamental', 'mercurial', 'Vivi', 'been', 'anything', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'Vivi', 'Sidda', 'comments', 'TIME', 'Magazine', 'interview', 'blame', 'mother', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'serious', 'rift', 'mother', 'daughter', 'attempt', 'heal', 'breach', 'Vivi', 'three', 'lifelong', 'pals', 'girls', 'whom', 'helped', 'found', 'secret', 'order', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'decide', 'perform', 'emergency', 'intervention', 'kidnap', 'Sidda', 'time', 'being', 'force', 'confront', 'truths', 'mother', 'hopes', 'Sidda', 'will', 'understand', 'better', 'set-up', 'way', 'film', 'go', 'flashbacking', 'map', 'Vivi', 'Sidda', 'father', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'people', 'conjure', 'up', 'memories', 'ultimately', 'reveal', 'true', 'picture', 'Vivi', 'troubled', 'life', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'best', 'intentions', 'perhaps', 'phoniness', 'stamped', 'starting', 'whole', 'cutesy', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sister', 'nonsense', 'Any', 'film', 'four', 'grown', 'women', 'gathered', 'candlelit', 'circle', 'wearing', 'makeshift', 'bejeweled', 'hats', 'making', 'blood', 'pacts', 'periodically', 'yelling', 'out', 'Ya-ya', 'one', 'already', 'pushing', 'too', 'hard', 'try', 'win', 'also', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'cute', 'when', 'three', 'older', 'women', 'spike', 'Sidda', 'drink', 'bar', 'drag', 'unconscious', 'airplane', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'full', 'approval', 'apparently', 'hold', 'hostage', 'home', 'Louisiana', 'Sidda', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'go', 'hell', 'run', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'strangest', 'mystery', 'film', 'offer.In', 'actuality', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'have', 'few', 'meaningful', 'moments', 'occur', 'most', 'frequently', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'settle', 'down', 'do', 'quite', 'reflecting', 'most', 'notably', 'Vivi', 'either', 'current', 'incarnation', 'harridan', 'supreme', 'brilliantly', 'enacted', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'previous', 'one', 'well-meaning', 'young', 'mother', 'coping', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'mental', 'illness', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'scenes', 'one', 'struck', 'just', 'how', 'easily', 'facial', 'terms', 'least', 'might', 'well', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'Burstyn', 'good', 'match', 'flashbacks', 'particular', 'are', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'actual', 'emotional', 'pain', 'so', 'much', 'feel', 'further', 'demeaned', 'time', 'film', 'cutesy', 'folksy', 'moments', 'eccentric', 'humor', 'far', 'too', 'often', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'serious', 'message', 'film', 'simply', 'buried', 'funny', 'hats', 'mumbled', 'incantations', 'phone', 'banging', 'pie', 'throwing', 'drug', 'imbibing', 'end', 'up', 'defining', 'm', 'eacute', 'tier', 'project', 'Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'feels', 'two', 'movies', 'actually', 'quiet', 'one', 'over', 'subtlety', 'charm', 'loud', 'one', 'self-consciousness', 'corniness', 'Sorry', 'say', 'second', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'victorious']",N/A

598176,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005JLCS,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 5]","""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" is based upon the novel of the same name, a tale of female friendships withstanding the ups and downs of a segregated South, WWII, and battles with alcohol and prescription drug addiction. Vivi, Teensy, Necie, and Caro are the Ya Ya's, bonded in a midnight blood-swapping First Nations-inspired ceremony complete with headdresses and Ya Ya war chant. They slip into adolescence together, sharing first crushes, a night in jail over indecent exposure, and supporting each other through humiliation and loss.Siddalee, Vivi's adult daughter who happens to be a successful playwright in New York, says more than she intends to in an interview, and the offensive results are published in Time Magazine. When Vivi reads Sidda's confessions of her mother's beatings, alcoholism, and dark nature, she is outraged, writing Vivi out of her will and cutting her face out of all of the family photos. The remaining Ya-Yas (Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight, Ellen Burstyn) come to the rescue by kidnapping Sidda and bringing her back to Louisiana to share with her the secrets of the Ya-Yas.The movie's most grievous flaw is playing up the material as a comedy. In the book, the elements of comedy serve to enlighten an otherwise dark, tragic tale of loss, abandonment, and abuse, but the film shoots itself in the foot by trying to elicit laughs.The casting is also suspect: although James Garner plays a strong, silent husband with a tender heart, the Ya-Ya actresses (one from England, one from Ireland) never seemed authentically ""Southern,"" most times looking lost, and frequently slipping into their native accents. For once, could someone cast Southern women as Southern women, please? Ashley Judd is luminous as the young Vivi, but bears nothing in common resemblance-wise with Ellen Burstyn, who plays older Vivi. Sandra Bullock is a restrained Sidda, much more earthbound than the zany, alcohol-sodden Ya-Yas (the scene with Sidda and the Ya-Yas in the restaurant was just painful--Note to producers: it is NOT funny drugging someone with a date rape drug).The original novel, at over 300 pages, has been cut down to a two-hour film, but in doing so, eliminates important subplots (Vivi's confinement and near-death illness in a nightmarish Catholic school as punishment from her hatred-filled, obsessively French Catholic mother) and changes others (Sidda's elephant ride becomes a plane ride). Willetta's mistreatment at the hands of rich, pro-Civil War relatives (calling her the n-word, making her wear a maid's uniform) forces young Sidda to see for the first time that Willetta has a family and feelings, too, but the scene is cut short in an attempt to play it up as comedy (a food fight at the table). The book's original explanation behind Shep planting sunflowers for Vivi is never explored, so the film's touching symbolism of sunflowers (on Sidda's warbonnet, the film's poster) is never explained and doesn't make sense for those that haven't read the book.The soundtrack by T Bone Burnett (the man behind O Brother Where Art Thou) is worth purchasing, as it combines Cajun, blues, gospel, and standards by a variety of artists, capturing the feel of the post-WWII South, but the DVD should be a rental. Extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, trailer, and scrapbook. This will appeal to fans of the original book, but may not make much sense to everyone else because of the massive plot trimming.",3,Could have been so much more....,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,3470,"['Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya-Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'tale', 'female', 'friendships', 'withstanding', 'ups', 'downs', 'segregated', 'South', 'WWII', 'battles', 'alcohol', 'prescription', 'drug', 'addiction', 'Vivi', 'Teensy', 'Necie', 'Caro', 'are', 'Ya', 'Ya', 'bonded', 'midnight', 'blood-swapping', 'First', 'Nations-inspired', 'ceremony', 'complete', 'headdresses', 'Ya', 'Ya', 'war', 'chant', 'slip', 'adolescence', 'together', 'sharing', 'first', 'crushes', 'night', 'jail', 'indecent', 'exposure', 'supporting', 'other', 'humiliation', 'loss.Siddalee', 'Vivi', 'adult', 'daughter', 'who', 'be', 'successful', 'playwright', 'New', 'York', 'more', 'interview', 'offensive', 'results', 'are', 'published', 'Time', 'Magazine', 'When', 'Vivi', 'Sidda', 'confessions', 'mother', 'beatings', 'alcoholism', 'dark', 'nature', 'outraged', 'writing', 'Vivi', 'will', 'cutting', 'face', 'family', 'photos', 'remaining', 'Ya-Yas', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'come', 'rescue', 'kidnapping', 'Sidda', 'bringing', 'back', 'Louisiana', 'share', 'secrets', 'Ya-Yas.The', 'movie', 'most', 'grievous', 'flaw', 'playing', 'up', 'material', 'comedy', 'book', 'elements', 'comedy', 'serve', 'enlighten', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'tragic', 'tale', 'loss', 'abandonment', 'abuse', 'film', 'shoots', 'foot', 'trying', 'elicit', 'laughs.The', 'casting', 'also', 'suspect', 'James', 'Garner', 'strong', 'silent', 'husband', 'tender', 'heart', 'Ya-Ya', 'actresses', 'one', 'England', 'one', 'Ireland', 'never', 'seemed', 'authentically', 'Southern', 'most', 'times', 'looking', 'lost', 'frequently', 'slipping', 'native', 'accents', 'once', 'could', 'someone', 'cast', 'Southern', 'women', 'Southern', 'women', 'please', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'luminous', 'young', 'Vivi', 'nothing', 'common', 'resemblance-wise', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'older', 'Vivi', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'restrained', 'Sidda', 'much', 'more', 'earthbound', 'zany', 'alcohol-sodden', 'Ya-Yas', 'scene', 'Sidda', 'Ya-Yas', 'restaurant', 'was', 'just', 'painful', 'Note', 'producers', 'NOT', 'funny', 'drugging', 'someone', 'date', 'rape', 'drug', 'original', 'novel', '300', 'pages', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'two-hour', 'film', 'doing', 'so', 'important', 'subplots', 'Vivi', 'confinement', 'near-death', 'illness', 'nightmarish', 'Catholic', 'school', 'punishment', 'hatred-filled', 'obsessively', 'French', 'Catholic', 'mother', 'others', 'Sidda', 'elephant', 'ride', 'plane', 'ride', 'Willetta', 'mistreatment', 'hands', 'rich', 'pro-Civil', 'War', 'relatives', 'calling', 'n-word', 'making', 'wear', 'maid', 'uniform', 'forces', 'young', 'Sidda', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'Willetta', 'family', 'feelings', 'too', 'scene', 'cut', 'short', 'attempt', 'play', 'up', 'comedy', 'food', 'fight', 'table', 'book', 'original', 'explanation', 'Shep', 'planting', 'sunflowers', 'Vivi', 'never', 'explored', 'film', 'touching', 'symbolism', 'sunflowers', 'Sidda', 'warbonnet', 'film', 'poster', 'never', 'explained', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book.The', 'soundtrack', 'T', 'Bone', 'Burnett', 'man', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Cajun', 'blues', 'gospel', 'standards', 'variety', 'artists', 'capturing', 'feel', 'post-WWII', 'South', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'rental', 'Extras', 'include', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'trailer', 'scrapbook', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'original', 'book', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'everyone', 'else', 'massive', 'plot', 'trimming']",N/A

The emphasis of the story has been moved from the YaYas to daughter SiddaLee.  (I well understand that if you hire Sandra Bullock as Sidda, you'd best be thinking of more than an occasional narrator.)This is the story of a spirited, deeply flawed woman and her painful, oftentimes hilarious relationship with her husband, friends and most of all, her very vulnerable grown daughter.  The setting is small town Louisiana and the Deep South flavor is almost palpable.I believe I am as willing to suspend belief as the next moviegoer, but I will admit I was sorely tried.  The leap that must be taken to be convinced that Ashley Judd ages into Ellen Berstyn is too much for me.  Not only is there no physical resemblance between the two, their acting, gestures and styles are poles apart.  Both Judd and Berstyn turned in good performances, but not of the same woman.  The same goes for young Sidda, Alison Bertolino and Sandra Bullock.  This little girl could never turn into Sandra Bullock!The trio who carried off southern accents was James Garner and Ashley Judd, who were born to it, and very British Maggie Smith, who emphatically was not.  The rest needed serious coaching.  The supporting roles of husband Shep (James Garner), and the three other YaYas, Maggie Smith, Shirley Knight and Fionula Flanagan seriously needed expansion and explanations which were not given.  Less time given to the present, and more to the past would make the lives and characters more explicable.The book had a connectedness, intensity and wild hilarity that I missed in the film.

The movie is about a group of women who have been friends since childhood and who come together to help heal a rift that has developed between one of their circle and her eldest daughter, Sidda, who is about to be married but is having second thoughts because of some old family skeletons in her closet which are causing her a lot of self-doubt.  The mother, Vivi, is furious because her now famous daughter has alluded to some less than flattering things about her childhood in a national magazine.  The Ya-Yas decide that enough is enough and they pull out the big thick scrapbook containing the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood to help clear the air. They hope Sidda will better understand her mother and maybe Vivi will better understand herself if they let Sidda in on some of the very private and hidden secrets of her own childhood that no one has ever really talked truthfully about before. Through flashbacks we come to know the principal characters and we share their growing and changing and the tragedies and triumphs and simple things that make up their intertwined lives. I absolutely loved the movie and I was sorry when it was over.  I was very moved by the unconditional love of the circle of female friends that have hung together ever since childhood, through thick and thin. I laughed and cried with them because of  the genuine way they were portrayed. I loved the character of Vivi played by Ellen Burstyn and Ashley Judd, so filled with emotion and conflict over not living out one's dreams. Every actor or actress in this film did a great job but Sandra Bullock's Sidda was not as deep as I think it could have been.  The other female characters were so sizzling with life that Sidda came off as rather flat.  The theme of not being able to forgive oneself was illustrated so movingly and with such satisflying depth that it gave food for thought long after the credits rolled.  The childish origins of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood are shown in such captivating and stylish fun and it is easy to see how the magical bonds of friendship could keep sustaining these women for their whole lives.  The almost pagan Catholicism practiced by these Louisiana belles gave a wonderful flavor to the whole film.  I loved the bits of French sprinkled throughout the conversations. I loved the eccentric and comical deeds and misdeeds of the Ya-Yas.  The movie spoke to me about the power and the endurance of women and the glory of committed friendship and its bonds.  I found it inspiring, sad, comic, filled with life and love.

All I can say to potential viewers is: If you haven't read the book, you might like the movie, although it is terribly frustrating in all its loose ends that are never explained. If you HAVE read the book, pretend this is another story entirely.I agree with another reviewer here who said that the makeshift southern accents were pitiful in some cases. So was much of the rest of the movie. What we have here is the story of a daughter who has held her impossibly sexy and gorgeous lover in an emasculated state of suspension for 7 years because she is afraid to marry him. Why? Because Mommy Dearest was a really bad mommy. But then...she was a good mommy too, and we see both bad and good in a series of disjointed flashbacks.This device worked beautifully in the book. All the humanity of the mother, Vivi, as well as her madness and sadness, came through. In the movie, she seems merely self-indulgent and more than a little nuts. No charm to speak of.As far as the much-touted Ya-Ya Sisterhood, not much is left of it but the name and some really silly ceremonies. None of the depth comes through as it did in the book.On the other hand, this is a fairly interesting ""chick flick"" if you have nothing else to do on a too-hot weekend afternoon.
