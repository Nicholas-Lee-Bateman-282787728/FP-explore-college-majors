The supporting characters do not have to carry him.This is my first review of a series and I know it sounds a bit incoherent, but I hope I have expressed myself well enough to indicate that I think this is a first rate show, with first rate writers and actors, and I hope this series will continue for many many years.I know this would be a physical hardship for the actors and I would continue to be a purchaser of this series even if the actors are given more time off to recover sufficiently.

Perhaps it's because they do so few episodes each season that things don't get stale, but it works.However, as excellent as the show and the individual episodes are, the DVD set itself is below par. There are no commentaries on ANY of the 16 episodes, the special features are a focus on the stunt crew and a panel from the SD Comic Con 2009 that did not even have Jeffrey Donovan or Gabrielle Anwar; while the performance of Bruce Campbell, who is the reason I started watching the show in the first place, is hilarious, the jumpy editing and short total run of the clip makes the viewer feel disappointed.Had there been even one commentary with some of the stars, or a run of outtakes from various episodes, I would have bumped the review up a couple stars.

1260405,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002BWP2BW,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","Burn Notice Season 316 Episodes on 4 Discs being released June 15, 2010""Burn Notice"" is a series about a spy who was ""burned"" and had to settle in a city without any records of a past and make due with his surroundings. Luckily for Michael Westen, he ended up in beautiful Miami with all the mojitos you can drink and the great Bruce Campbell in his company. What's so hard about that?It turns out quite a bit. Jumping into the third season without seeing the previous two appears to be not to challenging a feat as the premise is simple and the episodes engaging. Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) has a relationship with a ""trigger-happy"" ex-girlfriend, Fiona Glenanne (Gabrielle Anwar) and someone who used to be an FBI informant, Sam Axe played by Bruce Campbell to help him out on jobs that he and the other two plan together to make some money or help out someone in need. This season begins after Michael cuts all ties with his former employers who in theory had been protecting him and now the gloves are off and he is on his own.Spy training comes in handy in lots of situations and one really enjoyable element of the series is the use of Michael voiceovers to give instruction on useful tricks and techniques in the spy business for whatever he is doing at the moment. It feels almost like a how-to course and when you see him make a complex device out of everyday items to catch the signal of a cell phone, you'll be hooked and wonder if you could make one yourself if given the chance.Of course, what spy show wouldn't be complete with undercover missions, picking up accents, and lots of explosions? These are plentiful and at the end of the day, the three get to go to the bar together or home to Michael's mother, Madeline (Sharon Gless) and her badly-made birthday cake. Sam stays at Michael's mother's place and is in the process of hefty renovations in season three due to a sun room he blew up presumably at the end of season two.In this season, Michael has attracted the attention of a suspicious Detective trying to entrap him in any way possible. Luckily for him, he always seems to be one or two steps ahead and even attempts to solve one of her cases to get her to back off. Michael also wonders if getting back into his old line of work would be more secure than his current lifestyle and takes steps to open that door back up even though Fiona and Sam disagree with him. Some villains jump into play to attempt to use Michael's skills and promptly dispose of him. The ending of this season leaves Michael in a great cliffhanger.Fiona is a hard-as-nails lady who doesn't leave herself vulnerable to her emotions and prefers to take the direct approach in life and in her work. She is coined as ""trigger-happy"" which is an accurate assessment of her instinctual behavior. She considers romance with Michael to be what Michael's mother calls ""trench warfare"" so she is always on guard. Sam Axe enjoys courting old ladies with large bank rolls as it affords him the opportunity to drive many fantastic looking cars and he also serves as back-up and reconnaissance on many missions. Michael's mother is somewhat scatterbrained and a terrible cook, but is fiercely loyal to her son and his friends.This is a very enjoyable action series on the beach with lots of explosions, car chases, undercover character work, and mojitos.Bonus Features:There is a featurette on the ""Burn Notice"" Stunt Unit that lasts almost ten minutes and details how a car chase scene goes down complete with voiceovers from Michael Weston's character and clips from the show to tie it together. Also it has the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International panel for Burn Notice featuring Bruce Campbell, Ben Shenkman, Matt Nix, Alfredo Barrios Jr, Jake Karnes, and Seth Peterson.

I have stopped even looking for good shows unless something catches my attention in another way.I got turned on to this at Netflix and was blown away. This is the best TV show I have seen for a long, long time. Mix Miami Vice, Macguyver, the Bourne movies and add a touch of noir detective voice over, and you get the idea. The blend is fresh, exciting, enjoyable to watch, well written, shot, and acted. There is a great blend of drama, action, and comedy, and the writers manage to throw in plot twists and multiple story arcs which keep one guessing, yet do not feel contrived.The characters seem real and believable. The mix and chemistry are great, and the development of characters and long term arcs is very well handled at all levels. Good job to everyone involved in this. In this day and age, it is not easy to create and maintain a good show like this.Highly recommended. I am going to buy seasons 1 and 2.UPDATE July 4, 2010:I have now purchased the first three seasons and watched them all. The quality holds up nicely and the show remains really good.

1260425,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002BWP2BW,Mark Turner,"[23, 25]","Season three of BURN NOTICE does much to forward the story of ex-spy Michael Westen's attempt to rejoin the spy world while at the same time rounding out the story of Michael Westen the human being. While that may not sound like much in a weekly action series that takes some doing. To do so with the perfect combination of action, humor and story is even tougher. But the people behind this series make it seem easy.If you recall from the origin of the series, Westen was a super spy who was put on burn notice. A burn notice is when a spy gets left out in the cold or as he puts it in the voice over at the start of each episode ""...when you're burned you've got nothing; no cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they've decided to dump you in. You do whatever work comes your way."" Fortunately for Westen he was left stuck in Miami.And in Miami Westen was fortunate to have contacts like an ex-flame Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) who has an explosive temper to match her skills with weapons and bombs, a friend from his past and ex-Navy SEAL Sam (Bruce Campbell) who keeps him in touch with information and his mother Madeline (Sharon Gless) who, well, does all the things a worried mother would do. I mean what would have happened had they stuck him in a small Midwestern town?Westen, played superbly by Jeffrey Donovan, has shown in two previous seasons that while killing was his living while going up against bad men around the world, he truly has a heart of gold. Each episode formed around two core stories, the first being about Michael attempting to find out who burned him and the second being a case where he had ""clients"" that he had to help with one problem or another. Season two put him in touch with a lead that could have led him to the person behind the burn. But that season ended with her being shot and ""management"" telling him they would stop protecting him.Thus we start season three with Michael still stuck in Miami with the same crew. The only difference is that now the agency that prevented people from finding out he was alive and where he was located, have stopped all protection. This results in bad guys around the world coming in search of Michael while he continues trying to find a way back in as well as help a new client each episode.A lead takes Michael into meeting with an agent of sorts who takes on former spies and uses them as mercenaries for various tasks. Once again Michael has the chance to find out who burned him and to get back in. But as we've seen all along, former love Fiona would be happier if he put his past in the past and focused on their future. But Michael is driven by a need to help, a need to serve his country and a need to find out who did this to him not just to get back in the game but to make sure the people he cares about are safe as well.What makes this series work is the same thing that a number of series have begun to take seriously: the cast. When you have a cast that gels well together and that you can believe, it makes the difference. Think back to a series with a cast of 4 or more people that didn't work and you'll see what I mean. When it works the viewer cares about the characters and is willing to invest time to be with them each week. And while they shoot people and blow things up, these are characters you begin to care for.Each actor does a job that unfortunately has gone unrecognized by awards programs thus far. Anwar is great as the sexy love interest whose emotions are much more revealed than her character would be in any other show. Gless does a great job as a worrying mother trying to make up for the past. Campbell takes his iron jawed, womanizing, best bud character and makes him the kind of guy you'd want to have a drink with. And Donovan as Westen is amazing.Each week Westen is called on to turn himself into another cover, another person, to do the job he needs to do. Donovan in short plays not just Westen but Westen playing other people, be it mentally challenged individuals, terrified accountants, tough talking deal makers or cold blooded murderer. He does so with ease while making Westen's character seem like the most competent spy that ever existed.Season three brings Michael closer to finding out who had him burned. It provides several stories that show the depth of character and truly caring person he really is. It offers plenty of action for fans. And it shows that Michael has more familial feelings than even he would care to admit. Season three has it all. The only thing missing that can fault this DVD offering is that season four isn't there and ready to go as well. It will start soon though and you have the choice of catching up and becoming a fan by renting/buying all three previous seasons before it begins or just jumping onboard now. No matter what, this is one series that deserves to be watched.One bonus for TV fans in season three: the reunion of actresses Gless and Tyne Daly, the former stars of CAGNEY AND LACEY, together again in one episode. If you were a fan, you'll love seeing them together again.",5,THIRD DEGREE BURN,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,5074,"['Season', 'three', 'BURN', 'NOTICE', 'much', 'forward', 'story', 'ex-spy',

1260436,AZAC7B4HD5ZVC,B002BWP2BW,Steven Herring,"[1, 1]","Burn Notice season 3 is really a story of two seasons. The first half is not nearly as interesting as the second. The first half struggled to find a good back bone story for the overall mythology of the show. With Management no longer watching his back Michael is left to deal with his enemies alone. It sounds like a great premise, but was not executed well. First there is a cop that wants to put Michael down, a Middle eastern spy who wants revenge, amongst others. They never had any excitement to them and just felt too serialized. The enemies just never seemed to actually be a match for Michael Weston. The show already has it serialized part covered with the cases of the week. It didn't need any more predictable story lines. There was one standout in the first eight though, and that was when Brennan returns to exact revenge on Michael. That episode was very unpredictable and kept me on the edge of my seat.As the show reached it's hiatus a great overall arc began to take shape through the introduction of Gilroy. He is a Black Ops sociopath that uses Michael to do his dirty work or he'll kill everyone he knows. He played very similar to Carla from season two, but was far more threatening. This arc lasted for the second half of the season as week after week Michael unraveled another piece to his plan. In it's conclusion the plan is nothing that I saw coming. The finale leaves you wanting more and ends with a great mirror image of Michael. As you ask yourself what he could become.The acting as always is top notch and the voice overs by Jeffery Donovan are always enjoyable and the best part of the show in my opinion. Along with Brennen other characters resurface such as Sugar (drug dealer Michael shot in the pilot), Larry, and Nate all lead to some great episodes. The video quality is much improved over previous seasons that have been released. The grain though still evident is kept at a somewhat lower saturation level throughout the season. The bonus features are scarce and I miss the days of the scene specific commentary from season one. The only interesting special feature is a seven minute look at the Burn Notice panel at Comic Con.Overall this season would be a great addition to your Burn Notice library. Just bare with the sometimes boring first half of the season because the second half is riveting and everything you want from this top notch show.",4,A tale of two halfs,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2390,"['Burn', 'Notice', 'season', '3', 'really', 'story', 'two', 'seasons', 'first', 'half', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'second', 'first', 'half', 'struggled', 'find', 'good', 'back', 'bone', 'story', 'overall', 'mythology', 'show', 'Management', 'no', 'longer', 'watching', 'back', 'Michael', 'left', 'deal', 'enemies', 'alone', 'great', 'premise', 'was', 'not', 'executed', 'well', 'First', 'cop', 'put', 'Michael', 'down', 'Middle', 'eastern', 'spy', 'who', 'revenge', 'amongst', 'others', 'never', 'had', 'excitement', 'just', 'felt', 'too', 'serialized', 'enemies', 'just', 'never', 'seemed', 'actually', 'be', 'match', 'Michael', 'Weston', 'show', 'already', 'serialized', 'part', 'covered', 'cases', 'week', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'predictable', 'story', 'lines', 'was', 'one', 'standout', 'first', 'eight', 'was', 'when', 'Brennan', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Michael', 'episode', 'was', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat.As', 'show', 'reached', 'hiatus', 'great', 'overall', 'arc', 'began', 'take', 'shape', 'introduction', 'Gilroy', 'Black', 'Ops', 'sociopath', 'Michael', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'everyone', 'played', 'very', 'similar', 'Carla', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'threatening', 'arc', 'lasted', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'week', 'week', 'Michael', 'unraveled', 'piece', 'plan', 'conclusion', 'plan', 'nothing', 'saw', 'coming', 'finale', 'leaves', 'wanting', 'more', 'great', 'mirror', 'image', 'Michael', 'ask', 'what', 'could', 'become.The', 'acting', 'always', 'top', 'notch', 'voice', 'overs', 'Jeffery', 'Donovan', 'are', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'opinion', 'Brennen', 'other', 'characters', 'resurface', 'such', 'Sugar', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Michael', 'shot', 'pilot', 'Larry', 'Nate', 'lead', 'great', 'episodes', 'video', 'quality', 'much', 'improved', 'over', 'previous', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'grain', 'still', 'evident', 'kept', 'somewhat', 'lower', 'saturation', 'level', 'season', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'scarce', 'miss', 'days', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentary', 'season', 'one', 'only', 'interesting', 'special', 'feature', 'seven', 'minute', 'look', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'panel', 'Comic', 'Con.Overall', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'addition', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'library', 'Just', 'bare', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'riveting', 'everything', 'want', 'top', 'notch', 'show']",Burn Notice: Season 3
