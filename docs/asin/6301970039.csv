281771,ADWQPR0LJD4J,6301970039,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","Scream Factory brings fans of the obscure another lost nugget with its Blu-ray release of 1989's &#34;The Horror Show.&#34; Although it was marketed outside of the U.S. as a sequel to the &#34;House&#34; movies, it has nothing to do with either of the previous entries in the series. The only thing in common with those two is the movie's production crew and the fact that it's about a house in which supernatural happenings occur. There are a few unintentionally hilarious parts to be found in the film, but overall it's a mess that really comes unraveled in the end.After seemingly dying in the electric chair, mass murderer Max Jenke (Brion James) returns from the dead seeking revenge on the detective who captured him, Lucas McCarthy (Lance Henriksen). The killer is now in spirit form and able to manifest himself anywhere he pleases. He begins terrorizing McCarthy's family with every intention of killing them one by one. The desperate McCarthy must find a way to put a stop to Jenke's bloody trail of retribution.&#34;The Horror Show&#34; is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1). It goes without saying that the picture quality is better than any VHS or DVD copy floating around out there. It's clean but doesn't lose any of the film's gritty 1980s flavor.The movie's DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo provides home viewers with an enjoyable experience. Henry Manfredini's musical score adequately accentuates all the thrills and chills filmmakers attempt to throw at them. Unfortunately, good sound can't save an already disastrously confusing film. It can only help to make the pain of watching less excruciating.&#34;The Horror Show&#34; is rated R for violence, gore, adult situations, nudity, and language. It's pretty much par for the course when it comes to horror movies of the 1980s and 1990s. I'm positive it was mandatory to have at least one nude scene in all of these types of films during that era.Scream Factory offers up some fun bonus material for &#34;The Horror Show,&#34; which we've come to expect. Producer Sean S. Cunningham provides audio commentary for the feature. There are new interviews with actress Rita Taggart and stunt coordinator Kane Hodder. A theatrical trailer is included as well.There are those who say it's all about the journey and not where you're going. If that's a mantra you live by, &#34;The Horror Show&#34; may be worth a watch for you. I would like to mention that throughout the film, Lance Henriksen and Brion James do pour their hearts into their respective roles. All I can say is it's nowhere near as entertaining as I remember it being when I first saw it on cable back in the day. I'm rather lenient when it comes to my horror and slasher films, but this was a bigger mess than I'm able to make excuses for and just accept.",3,"""The Horror Show"" Blu-ray Provides Little to Get Excited About",1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,2799,"['Scream', 'Factory', 'fans', 'obscure', 'lost', 'nugget', 'Blu-ray', 'release', '1989', '34', 'Horror', 'Show.', '34', 'was', 'marketed', 'U.S.', 'sequel', '34', 'House', '34', 'movies', 'nothing', 'do', 'previous', 'entries', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'common', 'two', 'movie', 'production', 'crew', 'fact', 'house', 'supernatural', 'happenings', 'occur', 'are', 'few', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'overall', 'mess', 'really', 'unraveled', 'end.After', 'seemingly', 'dying', 'electric', 'chair', 'mass', 'murderer', 'Max', 'Jenke', 'Brion', 'James', 'dead', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'detective', 'who', 'captured', 'Lucas', 'McCarthy', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'killer', 'now', 'spirit', 'form', 'able', 'manifest', 'anywhere', 'terrorizing', 'McCarthy', 'family', 'intention', 'killing', 'one', 'one', 'desperate', 'McCarthy', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'put', 'stop', 'Jenke', 'bloody', 'trail', 'retribution.', '34', 'Horror', 'Show', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', 'Widescreen', '1.78:1', 'saying', 'picture', 'quality', 'better', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'copy', 'floating', 'around', 'there', 'clean', ""n't"", 'lose', 'film', 'gritty', '1980s', 'flavor.The', 'movie', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Stereo', 'home', 'viewers', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Henry', 'Manfredini', 'musical', 'score', 'adequately', 'thrills', 'chills', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'throw', 'Unfortunately', 'good', 'sound', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'already', 'disastrously', 'confusing', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'help', 'make', 'pain', 'watching', 'less', 'excruciating.', '34', 'Horror', 'Show', '34', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'gore', 'adult', 'situations', 'nudity', 'language', 'pretty', 'much', 'par', 'course', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', '1980s', '1990s', ""'m"", 'positive', 'was', 'mandatory', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'nude', 'scene', 'types', 'films', 'era.Scream', 'Factory', 'up', 'fun', 'bonus', 'material', '34', 'Horror', 'Show', '34', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Producer', 'Sean', 'S.', 'Cunningham', 'audio', 'commentary', 'feature', 'are', 'new', 'interviews', 'actress', 'Rita', 'Taggart', 'stunt', 'coordinator', 'Kane', 'Hodder', 'A', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'included', 'well.There', 'are', 'who', 'say', 'journey', 'not', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'mantra', 'live', '34', 'Horror', 'Show', '34', 'may', 'be', 'watch', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'film', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Brion', 'James', 'do', 'pour', 'hearts', 'respective', 'roles', 'can', 'say', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'entertaining', 'remember', 'being', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'cable', 'back', 'day', ""'m"", 'rather', 'lenient', 'when', 'horror', 'slasher', 'films', 'was', 'bigger', 'mess', ""'m"", 'able', 'make', 'excuses', 'just', 'accept']",N/A

Though this film contains truly dramatic and chilling moments, not to mention an atmospheric soundtrack, it is sadly let down by the fact that there are long periods in which nothing much happens.

The special effects from the 80s through the 90s didn't rely as much on cgi, yet some how they were still just as convincing. Briton James as the invincible killer and has some unique tricks to taunt L H and his family.

However we were pleasantly surprised to learn it was a nice 80's horror film starring one of our all time favorites...Lance Henrikson. Ever since he captivated us in Pumpkinhead we have welcomed his appearance in any film, especially a B horror. The Horror Show embodies the Saturday evening movie rental experience as a kid. This would be the type of film you'd see on the shelf and just know it would deliver copious amounts of B delight. Once you'd finally lure Santa out of the vavum section, it would be off for some chini takeout and back to the house for a fun evening of B goodness. It's unfortunate we we didn't stumble upon this gem back in the 90's, but better later then never.The movie opens up in complete chaos as Detective Lucas McCarthy (Henrikson)is hunting down deranged a serial killer known as Meat Clever Max. Obviously this is not a man one would want to mess with. He's even more lethal than the Lopper. As Detective Lucas come upon the crime scene he finds two decapitated police officers, one whose head is cooking up in a deep fryer. Once Det. McCarthy's partner gets chopped up, it's officially go time. As a tense battle ensues Meat Clever Max if arrested and scheduled for the death penalty. As Meat cooks in the electric chair he vows to reign down revenge upon Det. McCarthy as a ghost. The remainder of the film is Det. McCarthy's battle with the ghost of Meat Clever Max as his attempts to rescue his family from the spirits deadly revenge.The Horror Show delivered exactly what we were expected from a nice 80's B horror. Once Lance Henrikson was headlining the event we were assured for a real treat. It's the perfect type of film to throw into your Halloween season viewings, if you tend to be an avid fan of 80's and 90's horror like us. The guy that plays Meat Clever Max is one of the oddest looking individuals we have come across. This guy was perfect for the role as his face alone is horrific. We had heard that Stalker Friend tried out for this role, but fell short when he couldn't figure out how to read the script. He carried the correct physical attributes, but unfortunately fell short in the mental department. He was suggested more for a role as a Myers type killer being he mastered that ""far away"" look.",4,Henrikson should have used Pumpkinhead as his sidekick,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,2411,"['When', 'first', 'stumbled', 'Horror', 'Show', 'had', 'assumed', 'was', 'unauthorized', 'documentary', 'Santa', 'antics', 'have', 'horrified', 'many', 'years', 'However', 'were', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'learn', 'was', 'nice', '80', 'horror', 'film', 'starring', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'Ever', 'captivated', 'Pumpkinhead', 'have', 'welcomed', 'appearance', 'film', 'especially', 'B', 'horror', 'Horror', 'Show', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'movie', 'rental', 'experience', 'kid', 'would', 'be', 'type', 'film', ""'d"", 'see', 'shelf', 'just', 'know', 'would', 'deliver', 'copious', 'amounts', 'B', 'delight', ""'d"", 'finally', 'lure', 'Santa', 'vavum', 'section', 'would', 'be', 'off', 'chini', 'takeout', 'back', 'house', 'fun', 'evening', 'B', 'goodness', 'unfortunate', 'did', ""n't"", 'stumble', 'gem', 'back', '90', 'better', 'later', 'then', 'never.The', 'movie', 'up', 'complete', 'chaos', 'Detective', 'Lucas', 'McCarthy', 'Henrikson', 'hunting', 'down', 'deranged', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'Meat', 'Clever', 'Max', 'Obviously', 'not', 'man', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'mess', 'even', 'more', 'lethal', 'Lopper', 'Detective', 'Lucas', 'come', 'crime', 'scene', 'two', 'decapitated', 'police', 'officers', 'one', 'head', 'cooking', 'up', 'deep', 'fryer', 'Once', 'Det', 'McCarthy', 'partner', 'chopped', 'up', 'officially', 'go', 'time', 'tense', 'battle', 'Meat', 'Clever', 'Max', 'arrested', 'scheduled', 'death', 'penalty', 'Meat', 'electric', 'chair', 'reign', 'down', 'revenge', 'Det', 'McCarthy', 'ghost', 'remainder', 'film', 'Det', 'McCarthy', 'battle', 'ghost', 'Meat', 'Clever', 'Max', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'family', 'spirits', 'deadly', 'revenge.The', 'Horror', 'Show', 'delivered', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'expected', 'nice', '80', 'B', 'horror', 'Once', 'Lance', 'Henrikson', 'was', 'headlining', 'event', 'were', 'assured', 'real', 'treat', 'perfect', 'type', 'film', 'throw', 'Halloween', 'season', 'viewings', 'tend', 'be', 'avid', 'fan', '80', '90', 'horror', 'guy', 'Meat', 'Clever', 'Max', 'one', 'oddest', 'looking', 'individuals', 'have', 'come', 'guy', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'face', 'alone', 'horrific', 'had', 'heard', 'Stalker', 'Friend', 'tried', 'out', 'role', 'fell', 'short', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'read', 'script', 'carried', 'correct', 'physical', 'attributes', 'unfortunately', 'fell', 'short', 'mental', 'department', 'was', 'suggested', 'more', 'role', 'Myers', 'type', 'killer', 'being', 'mastered', 'far', 'away', 'look']",N/A

As of yet, this film isn't available on DVD in the U.S.  Tis a shame.As others point out, this is very similar to Craven's Shocker, which was released shortly after this.  Both films deal with serial killers executed in the electric chair, only to be resurrected as a kind of electrical specter hellbent on revenge.Shocker got most of the attention, but what Shocker didn't have is two of the coolest character actors ever.  Both Lance Henriksen and Brion James are major league badasses, and having them square off against each other is a treat.No, the movie isn't perfect, but better than you'd think.  In Freddy Krueger-like tradition, ghostly killer, James, sometimes appears to Henriksen as a kind of prankster.  Sometimes it's kinda funny, but his character is so vicious and imposing that it seems out of character.  Killer Max Jenke doesn't seem like he's really got much of a sense of humor and would be acting this way.  Plus on hand is the reliable nerdy guy who's all informed as to what's going on and tries to convince the very skeptical Henriksen.  Nothing much is a surprise, it's all riddled with cliches, but the power of the two leads keeps this one constantly watchable.It should have a DVD release, dammit!",4,Shocking!!,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,1318,"['one', 'great', 'old', 'days', 'HBO', 'HBO', 'would', 'NEVER', 'play', 'movie', 'today', 'yet', 'film', ""n't"", 'available', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'Tis', 'shame.As', 'others', 'point', 'out', 'very', 'similar', 'Craven', 'Shocker', 'was', 'released', 'shortly', 'films', 'deal', 'serial', 'killers', 'executed', 'electric', 'chair', 'only', 'be', 'resurrected', 'kind', 'electrical', 'specter', 'hellbent', 'revenge.Shocker', 'got', 'most', 'attention', 'what', 'Shocker', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'coolest', 'character', 'actors', 'ever', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Brion', 'James', 'are', 'major', 'league', 'badasses', 'having', 'square', 'off', 'other', 'treat.No', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'better', ""'d"", 'think', 'Freddy', 'Krueger-like', 'tradition', 'ghostly', 'killer', 'James', 'sometimes', 'Henriksen', 'kind', 'prankster', 'kinda', 'funny', 'character', 'so', 'vicious', 'imposing', 'character', 'Killer', 'Max', 'Jenke', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'got', 'much', 'sense', 'humor', 'would', 'be', 'acting', 'way', 'hand', 'reliable', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'who', 'informed', 'what', 'going', 'tries', 'convince', 'very', 'skeptical', 'Henriksen', 'Nothing', 'much', 'surprise', 'riddled', 'cliches', 'power', 'two', 'leads', 'one', 'constantly', 'watchable.It', 'should', 'have', 'DVD', 'release', 'dammit']",N/A

This is one of those great gonzo-killers-who-won't-die-even- when-they're-dead films that were so hot in the 80s. Don't get me wrong, I love watching the late, great Brion James chew scenery, and Lance Henriksen gives a good performance though he's somewhat hampered by the fact that he can't chew back since he's supposed to be a cop, a family man and reasonably sane. He still manages to give his characterization a real edginess. I mean, he gets to pull his own chest open in one scene. Can you get much edgier than that?
