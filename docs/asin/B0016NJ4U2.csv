Some of the greatest works of art come from tortured souls and this seems to be the case here. From a troubled childhood to secrets he took to his grave this video gives great insight into the man behind the masterpieces.,4,A fascinating life,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,303,"['Having', 'been', 'fan', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'work', 'watched', 'video', 'great', 'interest', 'greatest', 'works', 'art', 'come', 'tortured', 'souls', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'troubled', 'childhood', 'secrets', 'took', 'grave', 'video', 'great', 'insight', 'man', 'masterpieces']","The Extraordinary Voyages of Jules Verne, From the Sea to the Air, from the Earth to the Moon"

It also asserts that some of his ideas are thought to be stolen.

He was so far ahead of his time that he was intimidating to some who lean towards the more simple and clear-cut.  The reputed hidden messages ranging from hidden treasure to sex continue to interest and plague Verne enthusiasts.
