1214707,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001LLH8SE,Acute Observer,"[2, 3]","Blindness, 2008 filmThe traffic light turns to green but a car does not proceed. The driver can't see! One passer-by offers to drive his car home. The man gets out, the driver takes off with his car! Is it ""psychosomatic""? A couple speaks in a foreign language. ""Where are the car keys?"" Patients are taken by priority, not by appointment. More tests are needed at the hospital for this unusual condition. The next morning the Doctor can't see! It must be infectious. Other people have this problem. The ambulance operators are dressed for protection. The TV news tells of the ""white sickness"" that blinds people, they will be quarantined. Two men fight in the ward, one of them is that car thief. A young girl has to go now. A man falls and is bleeding. More patients arrive at the hospital. They do not provide care for that injured man, and threaten to shoot the doctor!There isn't enough food or medical supplies for this ward. People get the news from a small radio. The blindness is spreading. There are car, bus, and airplane accidents. People refuse to travel. Loud noises scare the sightless, the guards shoot three patients who leave their ward. They must bury the dead and also share the rations fairly. The car thief knows the Doctor's wife can see. She forgot to wind her watch. One patient goes outside and is shot at. Ward 3 wants to take over and loot the other patients. The patient who was born blind has an advantage. [The man who is armed is superior to the unarmed man said Machiavelli.] How can they survive with less food? What can they do? The leader of Ward 3 has a new plan. ""Have a nice day."" Any volunteers? Will they starve to death? An individual choice? Some women volunteer for this duty.The women enter Ward 3. ""We love you."" They return bearing the body of a young woman. ""What happened?"" A man was killed. They can get food now. Or will they submit? The men decide to fight for their rights. What can they do? A fire breaks out. That woman calls the guards. They have disappeared! The patients walk outside. There are signs of chaos in the streets, but no people! What happened? A small group goes to an apartment house to find a home. They wash in the bathroom. What kind of life will they have now? What happens when they run out of food? One man suddenly recovers his sight! [Then the story ends abruptly.]The credits roll. I didn't recognize the city used for the background. The story of a plague that comes upon the people echoes the Great Flu sickness of 1918 (which led to the end of the Great War), or the cholera epidemics of the 19th century. Gathering people into a small space echoes the concentration camps of WW II and other times. The only problem with this story is the lack of an ending or an explanation for this sudden outbreak of a new disease.[In WW I the Germans confiscated all of the butter in Denmark for their domestic needs. This was followed by an epidemic of blindness which disappeared when butter became available in peacetime. The scientific research led to the discovery of Vitamin A. People knew then that eating butter and eggs were unlikely to get tuberculosis, a disease of poverty and poor nutrition. It was a fatal disease until the discovery of antibiotics.]",2,A Parable about Society,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,3234,"['Blindness', '2008', 'filmThe', 'traffic', 'light', 'green', 'car', 'not', 'proceed', 'driver', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'One', 'passer-by', 'offers', 'drive', 'car', 'home', 'man', 'out', 'driver', 'off', 'car', 'psychosomatic', 'couple', 'speaks', 'foreign', 'language', 'Where', 'are', 'car', 'keys', 'Patients', 'are', 'taken', 'priority', 'not', 'appointment', 'More', 'tests', 'are', 'needed', 'hospital', 'unusual', 'condition', 'next', 'morning', 'Doctor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'must', 'be', 'infectious', 'Other', 'people', 'have', 'problem', 'ambulance', 'operators', 'are', 'dressed', 'protection', 'TV', 'news', 'tells', 'white', 'sickness', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'quarantined', 'Two', 'men', 'fight', 'ward', 'one', 'car', 'thief', 'young', 'girl', 'go', 'now', 'man', 'bleeding', 'More', 'patients', 'arrive', 'hospital', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'care', 'injured', 'man', 'threaten', 'shoot', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'enough', 'food', 'medical', 'supplies', 'ward', 'People', 'get', 'news', 'small', 'radio', 'blindness', 'spreading', 'are', 'car', 'bus', 'airplane', 'accidents', 'People', 'refuse', 'travel', 'Loud', 'noises', 'scare', 'sightless', 'guards', 'shoot', 'three', 'patients', 'who', 'leave', 'ward', 'must', 'bury', 'dead', 'also', 'share', 'rations', 'fairly', 'car', 'thief', 'Doctor', 'wife', 'can', 'see', 'forgot', 'wind', 'watch', 'One', 'patient', 'outside', 'shot', 'Ward', '3', 'take', 'over', 'loot', 'other', 'patients', 'patient', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'blind', 'advantage', '[', 'man', 'who', 'armed', 'superior', 'unarmed', 'man', 'said', 'Machiavelli', ']', 'How', 'can', 'survive', 'less', 'food', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'leader', 'Ward', '3', 'new', 'plan', 'Have', 'nice', 'day', 'volunteers', 'Will', 'starve', 'death', 'individual', 'choice', 'women', 'volunteer', 'duty.The', 'women', 'enter', 'Ward', '3', 'love', 'return', 'bearing', 'body', 'young', 'woman', 'What', 'happened', 'man', 'was', 'killed', 'can', 'get', 'food', 'now', 'will', 'submit', 'men', 'decide', 'fight', 'rights', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'A', 'fire', 'breaks', 'woman', 'guards', 'have', 'disappeared', 'patients', 'walk', 'are', 'signs', 'chaos', 'streets', 'people', 'What', 'happened', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'apartment', 'house', 'find', 'home', 'wash', 'bathroom', 'What', 'kind', 'life', 'will', 'have', 'now', 'What', 'when', 'run', 'food', 'One', 'man', 'suddenly', 'sight', '[', 'Then', 'story', 'abruptly', ']', 'credits', 'roll', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'city', 'used', 'background', 'story', 'plague', 'people', 'echoes', 'Great', 'Flu', 'sickness', '1918', 'led', 'end', 'Great', 'War', 'cholera', 'epidemics', '19th', 'century', 'Gathering', 'people', 'small', 'space', 'concentration', 'camps', 'WW', 'II', 'other', 'times', 'only', 'problem', 'story', 'lack', 'ending', 'explanation', 'sudden', 'outbreak', 'new', 'disease', '[', 'WW', 'Germans', 'confiscated', 'butter', 'Denmark', 'domestic', 'needs', 'was', 'followed', 'epidemic', 'blindness', 'disappeared', 'when', 'butter', 'became', 'available', 'peacetime', 'scientific', 'research', 'led', 'discovery', 'Vitamin', 'A', 'People', 'knew', 'then', 'eating', 'butter', 'eggs', 'were', 'unlikely', 'get', 'tuberculosis', 'disease', 'poverty', 'poor', 'nutrition', 'was', 'fatal', 'disease', 'discovery', 'antibiotics', ']']",Blindness

Your eyes make their way to the search field, then they move to the keyboard giving the OK to your fingers to begin typing. Your eyes bounce back to the screen.  You glance over at the time, but it's hard to see for some reason: something in your eyes is obstructing your view. You rub them gently, to get rid of whatever it is, but you notice it's now worst.  You open your eyes wider, in an attempt at getting more light in your eyes,  but nothing works.  You rub them again, and nothing.  You close your eyes and wait a while, and open them: nothing.  You are scared now, what is happening?  You rub them one last time out of futility, open them up as wide as you can, and realize the truth: you are now blind!This is not a big budget movie, with stunts, and cool special effects, this is a work of art. This is a study into the nature of man (and women).  This is what would happen if ""smart"" people develop the ultimate bioweapon, and unleash it on the population.  This is what happens when a tree in the Rain Forest is cut down freeing a virus that causes blindness.  This is a look into a potential experiment orchestrated by God to punish man for his sins.  I can go on and on in speculation, asking how or why this happened, but this is what this movie does.  It creates a curtain for you to peek in and see things you should not ever have see.  It's ironic that this movie shows blind people in deplorable circumstances, but yet you can't seem to stop watching. You share the movie with Julian Moore's character, moving through the twisted earth, a world that has turned upside down, and is not the same place we once ruled. Civility and logic are replaced with unruliness and fear. The macabre scenes are surprising.  They illicit pity, and remorse.  You ask why this is happening, and hope to get an answer with each continuing chapter.  After ""seeing"" Blindness, all I wanted to do was talk about it.  I was excited to finish the movie and engage in conversation about the the deplorable nature of humanity in the face of adversity.  If the eyes are the windows to the soul, what happens when there is no one to see your eyes?This movie was the scariest, engrossing, best disaster film I've seen in a long time.  Stories that take a group of people and put them in a position where all is lost, and nothing else matters but survival, and make them work together to solve a common goal or perish is what this author craves.

1214713,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001LLH8SE,Amazon Customer,"[11, 17]","Blindness / B001LLH8SE*Spoilers*When a mysterious epidemic of unusual blindness begins spreading throughout the human population, the government response is swift: the infected are thrown into quarantine to fend for themselves until either a cure is found, or the infected die. One of the infected is accompanied by his wife, who is (unbeknownst to everyone but her husband) immune to this strange disease. She alone can see in the new community that awaits her.This premise is a bit odd, but I am willing to accept it for the sake of the ""point"" of the film, which is how society might potentially break down in the face of widespread trauma and lack of governmental controls. Having said that, I do find it patently ridiculous that the blind are just tossed into an empty building to fend for themselves. I would expect at the very *least* for there to be closed circuit television and communication devices between the scientists and doctors on one side and the blind and infected on the other. If not for mercy, then in order to study the effects of the illness. How do the scientists hope to determine a cure when they have no way to interact with the infected: no blood samples, no behavioral information, and nobody to run tests on? So this particular angle - that the infected are all on their own from the get-go - is ridiculous. But, like I said, I'm willing to accept it in order to move the premise forward.At first, the blind adapt as well as can be expected. Quarantine is stressful under the best of conditions, but especially when suddenly handicapped in such a way that they can no longer care for themselves in the manner they have been used to - even such a task as locating and using the restrooms now requires whole new senses to rely on. Add on top of this a good dose of trauma, coupled with complete isolation from the outside world, and terror that if they stray to close to the border fence they will be shot instantly, and you can imagine that the overall mood is grim. As the wards fill up, the malcontents gravitate to one another, eventually setting up a territorial monarchy, monopolizing the food supplies, and demanding ""payment"" from the other groups in exchange for food. The malcontents are aided in this task by the implausible-yet-valuable addition of a gun and a sharp hunting knife (why the prisoners weren't searched initially is problematic, but even more so is why the violent and psychotic gun-owner didn't attempt to shoot the medical staff when they came to drag him away), as well as the addition of a blind-from-birth man who was picked up by accident in the general hysteria surrounding the disease. The blind-from-birth gentleman is soft-spoken and appears to be generally kind, but he has no apparent qualms about helping to rob and rape the ward population.Thereafter follows an extremely disturbing and graphic rape sequence which I would definitely recommend viewing if trying to understand the dynamics of power imbalance in gender relations (the 'good' men deride the women for refusing to volunteer; the women reasonably ask why the men aren't volunteering to go themselves; the 'good' men protest that is *different* and this is 'no big deal' because, hey, it's ""just"" sex, right?) and which I would definitely *not* recommend viewing if you are just looking for a nice, quiet Friday night movie.The woman are brutalized and beaten, and one woman is killed in the process, whilst the 'good' men back in the ward continue to fail to understand what has happened. When the prisoners finally flee the ward, they find that the guards are away from their posts and the whole world is infected with blindness. They stumble hopelessly forward, seeking survival in the ravaged supermarkets, hoping to avoid being victimized by the other victims, and praying that the wild dogs in the streets don't eat them. Our immune heroine steers a small group of survivors to her old home, where she nurtures them to health, and tries to cope with her own feelings of being the constant nursemaid to hundreds of helpless, traumatized people, and presumably her feelings regarding her husband's infidelity, her own rape, and her murder of one of the inmates. (I say ""presumably"" because these events are not revisited, and I can only assume that the heroine is coping with them.) The movie ends with the ""Ground Zero"" patient regaining his sight as mysteriously as he lost it, and the implication that, as he goes, so does the rest of the world.""Blindness"" is deep and thought-provoking, and the premise is certainly interesting, if not new: that, in the absence of societal controls and in the face of extreme trauma, we'll basically be reduced to murderous, rapacious, Thunderdome inhabitants. While I am essentially sympathetic to this viewpoint and I am not ignorant of, say, the Stanford Prison Experiment, at the same time I am skeptical of the way the movie had to be set up ""just so"" in order to obtain this effect.In order to obtain this ""just so"" effect, for instance, the `bad' elements of society are given a huge edge - deadly weapons and a blind-from-birth man who can be their `eyes' when the rest of the prisoners are still struggling to adapt. The `good' prisoners are handicapped by being in a closed space - they cannot simply leave or flee. That's quite a bonus on the side of evil and quite a handicap on the side of good, and the artificiality of the situation undermines the premise somewhat. Consider also that it is never resolved why the victims are so very passive in their fate. We have no concrete numbers, but we can estimate that the 'bad' group has approximately 20 men versus multiple wards of 35-40 people each. The 'bad' group is able to monopolize the food supply...how? By showing up and grabbing all the boxes whilst waving a pistol around, apparently. But this tactic really only works for so long against desperate, starving, traumatized people who in many cases no longer care if they live or die and likely have a great deal of unexpressed rage to work out against this world-which-blinded-them in general and their tormentors in particular - especially when the dictator has a limited number of bullets and a very low chance of hitting *you*, personally. We just have to accept, however, that they can and do monopolize the food with an iron grip, in order to proceed to the ""inevitable"" raping and killing of the women. This just feels terribly artificial, and the whole reason of the movie breaks down.In the end, I am willing to concede that if society breaks down it is possible that a few violent overlords may terrorize the rest of us, but I don't feel that this movie demonstrates that dynamic so much as it demonstrates that when strict, unrealistic controls are imposed on a world, it will respond in the one direction the writers left available. I think, perhaps, it might have been more interesting to explore this concept within a more realistic framework (such as if everyone went blind at the same time), but I suspect that in the absence of forced enclosure to consolidate the bad elements and provide them with unlimited power, the terrorization would be less possible and the 'good' people would more likely win the day. But I'm an optimist.This movie provides captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",2,Dismal and Bleak,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,7305,"['Blindness', '/', 'B001LLH8SE*Spoilers*When',

1214714,AOMO0EZ6P60E1,B001LLH8SE,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This was a very interesting movie with excellent acting and an intriguing plot but it lost a star due to what I would consider an illogical story element. First, as with any &#34;apocalyptic&#34; movies, a suspension of disbelief is required in general.In a nutshell, the movie follows a group of folks who fall victim to a blindness epidemic and get thrown into an abandoned facility by the military to be quarantined. One of the women, the always excellent Julianne Moore, who is immune to the blindness pretends to be blind so she can accompany her husband, Mark Ruffalo. The majority of the movie is a harrowing tale of how a growing population of confined blind prisoners with no care-taking whatsoever with the exception of rations being provided survive in an adult &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; situation.To describe my issue, I need to put a &#34;spoiler alert&#34; disclaimer before I continue and it may dissuade some from watching given the graphic nature of a portion of the movie I describe.When a nefarious faction in the &#34;prison&#34; begins to ruthlessly extort and rape the other groups in exchange for the rations that they control and horde, why does it take Moore's character so long to do anything about it. The main two characters played by Moore and Ruffalo have established that they are clearly intelligent and pragmatic as they keep their &#34;faction&#34; together and as civilized as possible, yet Moore's character rarely uses her ability &#34;to see&#34; to their advantage. How hard would it be to sneak in when the bad guys are sleeping and/or distracted before things get completely out of their control. She and the other women are repeatedly raped but it isn't until one of the women is killed during one of these episodes that she sneaks in and kills the ring-leader.Sure, one of the baddies has been blind since birth giving him additional sensory abilities to detect sound, but having sight when everyone else is blind is almost a super-power that isn't used until very late. This is likely to increase the dramatic impact. It would have made much more sense and thus more dramatic if everybody was blind.Beyond that it is an excellent twist on the apocalyptic drama.",3,"Excellent premise with a few ""scratch-your-head"" moments",1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2207,"['was', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'excellent', 'acting', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'lost', 'star', 'due', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'illogical', 'story', 'element', 'First', '34', 'apocalyptic', '34', 'movies', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'general.In', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'group', 'folks', 'who', 'fall', 'victim', 'blindness', 'epidemic', 'get', 'thrown', 'abandoned', 'facility', 'military', 'be', 'quarantined', 'One', 'women', 'always', 'excellent', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'immune', 'blindness', 'be', 'blind', 'can', 'accompany', 'husband', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'majority', 'movie', 'harrowing', 'tale', 'how', 'growing', 'population', 'confined', 'prisoners', 'care-taking', 'whatsoever', 'exception', 'rations', 'being', 'provided', 'survive', 'adult', '34', 'Lord', 'Flies', '34', 'situation.To', 'describe', 'issue', 'need', 'put', '34', 'spoiler', 'alert', '34', 'disclaimer', 'continue', 'may', 'dissuade', 'watching', 'given', 'graphic', 'nature', 'portion', 'movie', 'describe.When', 'nefarious', 'faction', '34', 'prison', '34', 'begins', 'ruthlessly', 'extort', 'rape', 'other', 'groups', 'exchange', 'rations', 'control', 'horde', 'why', 'take', 'Moore', 'character', 'so', 'long', 'do', 'anything', 'main', 'two', 'characters', 'played', 'Moore', 'Ruffalo', 'have', 'established', 'are', 'clearly', 'intelligent', 'pragmatic', 'keep', '34', 'faction', '34', 'together', 'as', 'civilized', 'possible', 'yet', 'Moore', 'character', 'rarely', 'ability', '34', 'see', '34', 'advantage', 'How', 'hard', 'would', 'be', 'sneak', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'sleeping', 'and/or', 'distracted', 'things', 'get', 'completely', 'control', 'other', 'women', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'raped', ""n't"", 'one', 'women', 'killed', 'one', 'episodes', 'kills', 'ring-leader.Sure', 'one', 'baddies', 'been', 'blind', 'birth', 'giving', 'additional', 'sensory', 'abilities', 'detect', 'sound', 'having', 'sight', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'blind', 'almost', 'super-power', ""n't"", 'used', 'very', 'late', 'likely', 'increase', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'thus', 'more', 'dramatic', 'everybody', 'was', 'blind.Beyond', 'excellent', 'twist', 'apocalyptic', 'drama']",Blindness
1214715,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001LLH8SE,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Jose Saramago's novel of the same name is somewhat of a masterpiece.  It really stokes the flames of one's internal beliefs and it transcends genre to the point where it becomes soulfully haunting.  I remember reading it and feeling this intense pressure, as if it was weighing down on me in this way that caused me to shiver within its allegorical poignancy.  Dissecting the human intuition in a way that bled us of our barriers and forced us to confront the fragility of selflessness, kindness and even godliness was a tall mountain to climb and yet Saramago's prose was so rich, so complete.When the film adaptation was talked about back in 2007 I was excited.  This is such a unique and visionary tale.  I really wanted to see something special come from this.  Fernando Meirelles had a good track record behind him and so when he was announced at the helm, I was doubly excited.  Add to that Julianne Moore and the ever underrated Mark Ruffalo and you had my full attention.  In fact, `Blindness' was one of my most anticipated for the year 2008.Then those scathing reviews poured in and it was basically shut out everywhere and those devoted to the novel claimed it an epic failure; so I didn't bother to see it.I happened to stumble upon this a few weeks ago and decide to dedicate my afternoon to soaking it in.  Worst case, I'd have my own scathing review to write.  I think the problem with `Blindness' stems from the depth of the novel.  It is just too complex for the big screen.  Some stories need the printed page because it allows them more space to really develop.  Between the lines, Saramago's novel built on so many layers that it felt so organic and lived in and truly heartfelt.  You could feel yourself pulled into the soul of this prose.  Sadly, this film adaptation feels more surface than ingrained.  Certain aspects of the novel that breathed a symbolic depth into the story (like the nameless faces) seems somewhat hollow on film, and the juxtaposition of characters isn't as fully fleshed as it is within the novel's pages.  Some of the situations feels more awkward than poignant (the love affair between the doctor and the prostitute for one lacks the hard-hitting depth it carried in the novel) and the editing seemed almost distracting at moments.That said, Meirelles is a visionary director and this film looks sublime.  The cinematography is outstanding and is very key to the atmosphere created here.  Julianne Moore is just great, as is Danny Glover, but sadly the rest of the cast either comes across oddly stereotyped (an issue handled more delicately in the novel) or barely significant.  Mark Ruffalo, someone who I usually adore, is kind of awful here.Oh well; sometimes it is too much to ask that one of your favorite novels becomes one of your favorite films.",3,Turning a blind eye...,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,2802,"['Jose', 'Saramago', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'somewhat', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'flames', 'one', 'internal', 'beliefs', 'genre', 'point', 'where', 'soulfully', 'haunting', 'remember', 'reading', 'feeling', 'intense', 'pressure', 'was', 'weighing', 'down', 'way', 'caused', 'shiver', 'allegorical', 'poignancy', 'Dissecting', 'human', 'intuition', 'way', 'bled', 'barriers', 'forced', 'confront', 'fragility', 'selflessness', 'kindness', 'even', 'godliness', 'was', 'tall', 'mountain', 'climb', 'yet', 'Saramago', 'prose', 'was', 'so', 'rich', 'so', 'complete.When', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'talked', 'back', '2007', 'was', 'excited', 'such', 'unique', 'visionary', 'tale', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'special', 'come', 'Fernando', 'Meirelles', 'had', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'helm', 'was', 'doubly', 'excited', 'Add', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'ever', 'underrated', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'had', 'full', 'attention', 'fact', 'Blindness', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'year', '2008.Then', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'poured', 'was', 'basically', 'shut', 'out', 'everywhere', 'devoted', 'novel', 'claimed', 'epic', 'failure', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'see', 'it.I', 'happened', 'stumble', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'decide', 'dedicate', 'afternoon', 'soaking', 'Worst', 'case', ""'d"", 'have', 'own', 'scathing', 'review', 'write', 'think', 'problem', 'Blindness', 'depth', 'novel', 'just', 'too', 'complex', 'big', 'screen', 'stories', 'need', 'printed', 'page', 'more', 'space', 'really', 'develop', 'lines', 'Saramago', 'novel', 'built', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'felt', 'so', 'organic', 'lived', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'could', 'feel', 'pulled', 'soul', 'prose', 'Sadly', 'film', 'adaptation', 'feels', 'more', 'surface', 'ingrained', 'Certain', 'aspects', 'novel', 'breathed', 'symbolic', 'depth', 'story', 'nameless', 'somewhat', 'hollow', 'film', 'juxtaposition', 'characters', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fleshed', 'novel', 'pages', 'situations', 'feels', 'more', 'awkward', 'poignant', 'love', 'affair', 'doctor', 'prostitute', 'one', 'hard-hitting', 'depth', 'carried', 'novel', 'editing', 'seemed', 'almost', 'distracting', 'said', 'Meirelles', 'visionary', 'director', 'film', 'sublime', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'very', 'key', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'here', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'just', 'great', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'sadly', 'rest', 'cast', 'across', 'oddly', 'stereotyped', 'issue', 'handled', 'more', 'delicately', 'novel', 'barely', 'significant', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'someone', 'who', 'usually', 'adore', 'kind', 'awful', 'here.Oh', 'well', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels', 'one', 'favorite', 'films']",Blindness

Also, these are people who have all just gone blind so they have had no time to develop compensatory skills. These people then threaten the survival of the person who can see, threatening to remove food and so forth and they want the seeing person to submit to them.  They can wave a gun around against a huge crowd of people but they can't aim at anything.  There you are with your two good eyes watching this from that crowd.  What does any person with an intact sense of survival do?  Answer: you IMMEDIATELY find or make some weapons (a skill you have which they don't since you can see, sneak up on those who are threatening you, take aim (something they can't do) and KILL THEM!!!!  If you are so naive as to imagine that you would submit to a bunch of suddenly blind people who don't want to share food with you and want to rule you, when you are the one who can see, then go ahead and watch this movie.  I cannot believe I wasted my time doing so.BTW, I believe I read and saw an earlier version of this called THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, written and filmed in the 1960s or 1970s.

Unfortunately, this film is so badly written my jaw dropped! Why do filmmakers endlessly treat their audience like complete idiots? There were enough plot holes to drive an ocean liner through!This disaster takes place in a large cosmopolitan city in a foreign country, most likely England. You can tell from the cars' license plates, and everyone speaks English with either an American or English accents. Now you would think in a Western Democracy with a functioning legal system, people would not be treated like cattle and isolated in squalor - literally from the beginning - with the very first victim. It didn't matter that the first victim included professionals from the upper crust of society. It's obvious Blindness is attempting to be a bizarre cross between George Orwell's, ""1984"" and William Golding's, ""Lord of the Flies"" with absolutely no explanation for the complete lack of any form of civil rights or common sense.All I witnessed on the big screen was: Innocent and helpless people being treated like animals; a stupid spouse, who kisses her infected husband's eyes in solidarity, but runs around pretending to be blind; human excrement everywhere; naked fat people lounging throughout the prison walls; innocent people blindly being gunned down by soldiers 100 feet away in a control tower without any quarantine protection; blind villains, led by someone who conveniently has a loaded gun and who blindly shoots into the crowd in order to single-highhandedly rob everyone of their valuables, by threatening 100's of physically fit blind men and women with hunger; a prostitute stabbing a guy in his leg with high heeled shoes for feeling her breasts, but he can't get any penicillin for the subsequent infection because the government won't answer the phone, so he goes outside so a soldier in the unprotected guardhouse can bump him off before the gangrene does!

Blindness offers a remarkably fresh perspective from which to view the extreme frailty and ruthlessness of the human animal.Let it simply be said that this film is very good.  Blindness is an intelligent and frightening tale, most effective because of the restraint and realism employed.  Far more than entertainment, this is a  statement on the very fabric of our species and how little it takes to tear it apart.All involved do well to elevate Blindness to stunning success, high above the thousands of films that focus only on the mundane.

Yes, it's ugly, and that's exactly what makes it appealing, that the filmmakers DIDN'T stay in established parameters of filmmaking. It's raw and makes you feel gutted in the end, which is the mark of a film that delivers on it's premise. If thinking is something you'd rather not do when watching a film, this one is not for you.There is a great deal to revel at due to the dark portrayal of humanity after a mysterious illness strikes everyone except one woman sightless.

Amith (kndy),"[11, 19]","Imagine that one day you lost your eye sight completely...Imagine everyone in the world starting to lose their eye sight and all becoming blind.That is the storyline of the film ""BLINDNESS"" directed by Fernando Mierelles (known for his work for the 2006 award winning film ""The Constant Gardner"").  What happens when everyone has gone blind except for one.VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is presented in (1:85:1) widescreen and was well done.  Fernando Mierelles and Cesar Charlone were able to work together to recreate the disgusting, dark and creepy quarantine area perfectly but most of all, to showcase so many people all blind inside the quarantine area and the real world as they walk the freeways, rummage throughout the city, etc.  Well done!Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film and you can hear everyone clearly.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are two special features included on the DVD.* ""A Vision of Blindness"" - Making of Blindness Documentary - This one hour featurette actually enhanced my appreciation for the film.  A lot of the main talent to the extras had to undergo blindness training.  At first using a blindness coach and wearing sleeping eye masks for hours and trying to manage themselves through areas and depending on others to get from one point to another.  Also, to make sure that the experience was real during filming, the main characters had to wear special contact lenses which made them blind.  Another interesting bit of information was how many countries this film was shot in.  Many variety of locations in order to achieve realistic results and they succeeded.  But the most difficult task for the crew was getting the OK from Jose Saramago (the original writer of the novel), a man who never gives out the rights to his films.  But in this case, because the producers didn't look like the Hollywood types, he gave them the OK.  A very awesome featurette.* Deleted Scenes - Deleted scenes with a written intro by the director.  I can understand why they were cut out.  In the film, you were lead to believe that everyone inside were people who were infected by the blindness but in the deleted scenes, a significant scene was that both those who were blind and those who came into contact with those infected were in quarantine.  Another was more ruthlessness in the rape scenes and also other scenes which I was happy to see trimmed out of the film.I enjoyed ""BLINDNESS"" and definitely was surprised after watching the special featurette of how far the director went to make sure everyone had blindness training and having to wear the special contact lenses.  It definitely made the movie much more believable and also their utilization of locations to have a world that has gone astray because everyone has gone blind.  At first, I was wondering if they were constructive sets made in the back lot and a lot of CG but they really went all out in trying to find locations where to make this film happen.""BLINDNESS"" is one of those films that incorporated an all-star cast from talent worldwide.  Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo and Danny Glover are well known names in the US.  Yoshino Kimura and Yusuke Iseya are well-known in Japan.  Alice Braga is well known in Brazil (and the US for her role in ""I Am Legend""), Gael Garcia Bernal is known for his work in Mexico and Spain (also in the US for ""Babel"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") but featuring so many talent from all over the world was a good idea.Performances from each of the cast members were well done and overall, the storyline was gripping, provocative and startling.  Of course, watching the film, you kind of think to yourself, how is it that everyone has gone blind except the doctor's wife (Julianne Moore), at first I was wondering if her being able to see would be a cure but the film doesn't go that direction.  And the direction the storyline went, I was very satisfied with.  Overall, the film shows a side of humanity that eventually gets tested and pushed to a very dark side.  Everyone become equals, there is no prejudice, there is no difference in who is rich and who is poor.  When everyone is blind, everyone can either work as a group or be alone.  Eventually by the end of ""BLINDNESS"", you see that there is hope.I enjoyed the film but watching the DVD and watching the featurette ""A Vision of Blindness"" made me enjoy this film much, much more because you see how much was put into it, how much commitment from the various crews in different countries to the final moment when you see the reaction from Jose Saramago, the writer of the novel as he watched the film with director Fernando Meirelles and his reaction at the end.""BLINDNESS"" is a film worth watching and even moreso, watching it on DVD.

1214733,A34H90POFYRHGT,B001LLH8SE,dSavannah George-Jones,"[6, 13]","I read the book, and it is a very intense look at what happens when social mores collapse. It is not really about blindness, but about what happens, as the director said, when people lose something - in this case, their sight and then their ability and/or need to follow society's conventions.Critics and reviewers have mentioned that they were confused by the lack of explanation of the blind plaque - well, that is sort of the point - it is a mystery, and no one knows why it is happening, but it has to be dealt with and they have to move on.Other reviewers also mentioned how disgusting the film is - again, that's part of the story. If you can't see, then why would you bother to stay clothed? How could you possibly clean the place up if you can't see? If you have to go to the bathroom, and don't know where it is, and can't see to find it, wouldn't you just go where you are? And if the water is disgusting and horrible as portrayed, why would you even bother trying to get clean in the first place?Yes, the book and movie are unsettling - but again, that's the idea.Usually, movies made out of books are a pale imitation of the book.

1214735,A1R58912KISXTV,B001LLH8SE,Elli,"[22, 32]","{Attention - The following review contains spoilers so be warned.}This movie is not for everyone and I'm in the camp of ""It's not for me."" I wasn't really bothered by unexplained subjects in the movie such as - where the blindness came from, why only one character still had sight, what country/city the movie was taking place in, even the open ending quality of the last scene didn't faze me (though I think these things might annoy other viewers).  I just didn't find this movie necessarily thought provoking or exceptionally well done simply because of it's depiction of a group of people (most likely a metaphor for larger society) gradually succumbing to desperation after being put and left in deplorable conditions.  I've seen this kind of story line done other times  . . . (Lord of the Flies comes to mind) and I never get the fascination. Just because a story is dark and depressing doesn't make it magic gold for me.Part of my dislike for the movie stems from what I found to be scenes done more to shock the unsuspecting eyes of the audience then to some how convey the story line better.  For instance I had issues with the graphic rapping of the women (which seems to be a favorite form of victimization writers put in these movies).  Just the scene of the women coming back from ward 3, weak, beaten up, and carrying the naked dead body of one of the women is enough, in my opinion, to get the point across.  But the director felt the need to show as much debasing and violence done to the women as he could get away with.  (From my understanding the rape scene was meant to be longer but some female audience members in the 1st screenings of the movie were getting up and walking out so the director edited it - [...]Another issue that bothered me was the way the film was directed.  Every glare or white surface area shown in the film suddenly became hyper-white . . . meaning the whiteness just got over exaggerated.  Some people may find that a nice creative touch, but I found it annoying after awhile right along with the weird blurring and awkward camera angles.Notwithstanding, some of the plot details left me sitting there like ""I get the feeling they're going for a realistic approach with this movie but . . . Do they expect me to believe this?"" For Example --Why would a guy who suddenly goes blind while driving opt to just go home instead of going to the hospital right away?-I just can't see a person who is standing in the middle of a cross walk, who looks reasonably sane, pleading for help and getting ignored by everyone around him. Not even the drivers of the cars that are managing to avoid running him over call out a simple ""Get the hell of the street!"" to him.-Why would the guards at the facility who have been talking to the blind people all along (though primarily through a bull horn . . . ) suddenly see a stray man leave a line and rather than say ""stop where you're at"" or even ""get back in line"", they don't say a word but decide to shot the guy instead?(I feel like there was this straining right from the beginning of the movie to show this ""see . . . see how cruel humans are?"" theme even before societal structures broke down and conditions deteriorated into madness.)-Oh and like another reviewer mentioned - just how many bullets was in that gun being waved around by the King of Ward 3?  There was never any mention that the King had more ammunition.  There was never any scene of him or Mr. Blind-from-Birth reloading the gun.  Yet they just kept firing away like they had a magical gun that never ran out of bullets.-And I have to say, if these people in the facility were on the edge . . . at one point willing to do anything for food, why revolt and killing the tormentors never seemed like a reasonable option is a mystery to me.  The oppressors only had one gun and the two other wards put together theoretically out number Ward 3. I'm thinking Ward 3 could have been over powered with enough reasonable planning.  But I guess such action would not go with the overall running theme of showing humans as deplorable, pathetic, and worst than rabid animals.But anyway, if you honestly enjoy watching movies that are ""base, shocking, [and] violent"" or like movies that result in ""conversation about the deplorable nature of humanity in the face of adversity"" than this movie would be for you.  Some of the other issues I had with this movie probably wouldn't bother you.  But for the rest of us I guess we'll stick to something else.",1,Not for everybody,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,4491,"['Attention', 'following', 'review', 'spoilers', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'camp', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'bothered', 'unexplained', 'subjects', 'movie', 'such', 'where', 'blindness', 'came', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'still', 'had', 'sight', 'what', 'country/city', 'movie', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'even', 'open', 'ending', 'quality', 'last', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'faze', 'think', 'things', 'might', 'annoy', 'other', 'viewers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'necessarily', 'thought', 'provoking', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'simply', 'depiction', 'group', 'people', 'most', 'likely', 'metaphor', 'larger', 'society', 'gradually', 'succumbing', 'desperation', 'being', 'put', 'left', 'deplorable', 'conditions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'story', 'line', 'done', 'other', 'times', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'mind', 'never', 'get', 'fascination', 'Just', 'story', 'dark', 'depressing', ""n't"", 'make', 'magic', 'gold', 'me.Part', 'dislike', 'movie', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'scenes', 'done', 'more', 'shock', 'unsuspecting', 'eyes', 'audience', 'then', 'how', 'convey', 'story', 'line', 'better', 'instance', 'had', 'issues', 'graphic', 'rapping', 'women', 'be', 'favorite', 'form', 'victimization', 'writers', 'put', 'movies', 'Just', 'scene', 'women', 'coming', 'back', 'ward', '3', 'weak', 'beaten', 'up', 'carrying', 'naked', 'dead', 'body', 'one', 'women', 'enough', 'opinion', 'get', 'point', 'director', 'felt', 'need', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'debasing', 'violence', 'done', 'women', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'understanding', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'longer', 'female', 'audience', 'members', '1st', 'screenings', 'movie', 'were', 'getting', 'up', 'walking', 'out', 'so', 'director', 'edited', '[', 'issue', 'bothered', 'was', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'glare', 'white', 'surface', 'area', 'shown', 'film', 'suddenly', 'became', 'hyper-white', 'meaning', 'whiteness', 'just', 'got', 'over', 'exaggerated', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'nice', 'creative', 'touch', 'found', 'annoying', 'awhile', 'right', 'weird', 'blurring', 'awkward', 'camera', 'angles.Notwithstanding', 'plot', 'details', 'left', 'sitting', 'there', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'going', 'realistic', 'approach', 'movie', 'Do', 'expect', 'believe', 'Example', 'Why', 'would', 'guy', 'who', 'suddenly', 'driving', 'opt', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'instead', 'going', 'hospital', 'right', 'away', '-I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'person', 'who', 'standing', 'middle', 'cross', 'walk', 'who', 'reasonably', 'sane', 'pleading', 'help', 'getting', 'ignored', 'everyone', 'Not', 'even', 'drivers', 'cars', 'are', 'managing', 'avoid', 'running', 'call', 'out', 'simple', 'Get', 'hell', 'street', 'him.-Why', 'would', 'guards', 'facility', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'talking', 'blind', 'people', 'primarily', 'bull', 'horn', 'suddenly', 'see', 'stray', 'man', 'leave', 'line', 'rather', 'say', 'stop', 'where', ""'re"", 'even', 'get', 'back', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'decide', 'shot', 'guy', 'instead', 'feel', 'was', 'straining', 'right', 'beginning', 'movie', 'show', 'see', 'see', 'how', 'cruel', 'humans', 'are', 'theme', 'even', 'societal', 'structures', 'broke', 'down', 'conditions', 'deteriorated', 'madness', '-Oh', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'bullets', 'was', 'gun', 'being', 'waved', 'King', 'Ward', '3', 'was', 'never', 'mention', 'King', 'had', 'more', 'ammunition', 'was', 'never', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Blind-from-Birth', 'reloading', 'gun', 'just', 'kept', 'firing', 'away', 'had', 'magical', 'gun', 'never', 'ran', 'bullets.-And', 'have', 'say', 'people', 'facility', 'were', 'edge', 'one', 'point', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'food', 'why', 'revolt', 'killing', 'tormentors', 'never', 'seemed', 'reasonable', 'option', 'mystery', 'oppressors', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'gun', 'two', 'other', 'wards', 'put', 'together', 'theoretically', 'out', 'number', 'Ward', '3', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Ward', '3', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'powered', 'enough', 'reasonable', 'planning', 'guess', 'such', 'action', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'overall', 'running', 'theme', 'showing', 'humans', 'deplorable', 'pathetic', 'worst', 'rabid', 'animals.But', 'anyway', 'honestly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'are', 'base', 'shocking', '[', ']', 'violent', 'movies', 'result', 'conversation', 'deplorable', 'nature', 'humanity', 'face', 'adversity', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'issues', 'had', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'rest', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'something', 'else']",Blindness

Brazilian director Meirelles (City of GodandThe Constant Gardener) successfully conveyed Saramago's literature work to the screen, honoring the title of cinema as the seventh art and demonstrating again his creativity and competence as a movie director. As usual, good cinema is almost always not a commercial success, and this explains the harsh criticism by some movie critics and the disappointment of many movie goers.As a quick warning, if you dislike odd movies with shocking content but with quite a philosophical message, such as Kubrick'sA Clockwork Orange, then do not waste your time and money buying/watching this movie. But if decide to you give it a try, please, do not expect a logical explanation for such a rare event as to all people but one going blind in an unnamed city, with characters with no name. It doesn't matter, and it is completely irrelevant for the message Saramago indented. This is a story that lets you think and reflect on human values and our true nature, in a modern society that is more worry about money and so many superfluous things.So Paulo city is the main background for the movie, though some scenes were also shot in Toronto, and old town Montevideo, Uruguay. Despite the strong Portuguese and Latin American origin and influences of the film (actor Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is Mexican and actress Alice Braga is Brazilian), the movie was produced in English language, and casting renowned American actors Julliane Moore, Dany Glover and Mark Ruffalo, in order to reach out to wider audiences in North America, Europe and Asia. The script faithfully follows the original novel storyline, with the normal simplifications imposed by the limited running time, and above all, by softening and blurring some of the most brutal, cruel and shocking events in the original novel, but without sacrificing the message Saramago intended for the readers. Even though at some point it begins to look like a boring ""end of the world"" flick or if you find the raping scene too shocking, hold on and do not get confused, wait until the end, that this movie about a powerful message regarding human feelings, instincts and values, that will really make you wonder about our western society's values and about our human nature.If you really enjoy the movie, I highly recommend you to read the original literary work, and alsoDeath with Interruptions(Intermitncias Da Morte, Portuguese Edition), another novel by Saramago, on which he again plays with a fantastical scenario, but his time citizens of an unnamed country do not die. In this work he explores other aspects of human nature in a less brutal and more humorous way. Again, no logical explanation is necessary for such a rare event to occur, and again it doesn't matter, though actually a very silly explanation is provided.",5,Masterfully and faithfully transferred the message about human nature and values from Saramago's novel to the screen,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,2989,"['film', 'based', 'excellent', '1995', 'novel', 'Nobel-laureate', 'Portuguese', 'writer', 'Jos', 'eacute', 'Saramago', 'Blindness', 'originalEnsaio', 'Sobre', 'Cegueira', 'Portuguese', 'Edition', 'Brazilian', 'director', 'Meirelles', 'City', 'GodandThe', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'successfully', 'conveyed', 'Saramago', 'literature', 'work', 'screen', 'honoring', 'title', 'cinema', 'seventh', 'art', 'demonstrating', 'again', 'creativity', 'competence', 'movie', 'director', 'usual', 'good', 'cinema', 'almost', 'always', 'not', 'commercial', 'success', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'movie', 'critics', 'disappointment', 'many', 'movie', 'goers.As', 'quick', 'warning', 'dislike', 'odd', 'movies', 'shocking', 'content', 'quite', 'philosophical', 'message', 'such', ""Kubrick'sA"", 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'buying/watching', 'movie', 'decide', 'give', 'try', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'logical', 'explanation', 'such', 'rare', 'event', 'people', 'one', 'going', 'blind', 'unnamed', 'city', 'characters', 'name', ""n't"", 'matter', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'message', 'Saramago', 'indented', 'story', 'think', 'reflect', 'human', 'values', 'true', 'nature', 'modern', 'society', 'more', 'worry', 'money', 'so', 'many', 'superfluous', 'things.So', 'Paulo', 'city', 'main', 'background', 'movie', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'shot', 'Toronto', 'old', 'town', 'Montevideo', 'Uruguay', 'strong', 'Portuguese', 'Latin', 'American', 'origin', 'influences', 'film', 'actor', 'Gael', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Bernal', 'Mexican', 'actress', 'Alice', 'Braga', 'Brazilian', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'English', 'language', 'casting', 'renowned', 'American', 'actors', 'Julliane', 'Moore', 'Dany', 'Glover', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'order', 'reach', 'out', 'wider', 'audiences', 'North', 'America', 'Europe', 'Asia', 'script', 'faithfully', 'original', 'novel', 'storyline', 'normal', 'simplifications', 'imposed', 'limited', 'running', 'time', 'softening', 'blurring', 'most', 'brutal', 'cruel', 'shocking', 'events', 'original', 'novel', 'sacrificing', 'message', 'Saramago', 'intended', 'readers', 'Even', 'point', 'look', 'boring', 'end', 'world', 'flick', 'find', 'raping', 'scene', 'too', 'shocking', 'hold', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'confused', 'wait', 'end', 'movie', 'powerful', 'message', 'regarding', 'human', 'feelings', 'instincts', 'values', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'wonder', 'western', 'society', 'values', 'human', 'nature.If', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'original', 'literary', 'work', 'alsoDeath', 'Interruptions', 'Intermitncias', 'Da', 'Morte', 'Portuguese', 'Edition', 'novel', 'Saramago', 'again', 'fantastical', 'scenario', 'time', 'citizens', 'unnamed', 'country', 'do', 'not', 'die', 'work', 'other', 'aspects', 'human', 'nature', 'less', 'brutal', 'more', 'humorous', 'way', 'Again', 'logical', 'explanation', 'necessary', 'rare', 'event', 'occur', 'again', ""n't"", 'matter', 'actually', 'very', 'silly', 'explanation', 'provided']",Blindness

Vision is our crutch.  What would happen if we were all suddenly without sight?An epidemic strikes fear in the populous as blindness spreads like a yawn.  Those affected are quarantined into deplorably cramped and filthy conditions, leading to the ugly side of humanity rearing its instinctive head as preservation dominates decency and morality.  When Ward 3 begins to assert their dominance over the other groups, forcing the weaker Wards to relinquish cherished valuables and sexual sanctity for the sake of survival (Ward 3 has all the food), it's up to the others - led by the only seeing person in the facility - to fight back and reclaim decency.Helio San Miguel provides a powerfully allegorical picture of the human nature under the stress of societal implosion.  In a brilliantly ironic twist, the resolution of the films displays to both the characters and the viewers how human depravity can sink the majority to subhuman, no, inhumane levels, and even the previously righteous may become wicked.  It is only after the realization of our immorality that we are aware, that we can see.  The concept itself is wonderfully thought provoking.The problems with this film, however, are numerous, and most fall into the believability area.  Even if this were even remotely possible, there is no way the afflicted would be isolated without medical study.  Further, while the odds of infidelity in a completely blind world would definitely increase, the odds of the infidelity coming from a person married to the only woman with sight are remote.  Much worse is the idea of a larger group in this sort of situation would allow a few malcontents to turn all others into milquetoast capable of allowing their women to willingly walk into a brutal gang rape.Overall, I'd say that it's a brave attempt at the seemingly unwinnable endeavor of book-to-film transition.  The camerawork - at times iridescent, at others irritating - could easily sway a viewer one way or another.  The complete lack of any explanation, specifically the cause of the affliction, the conditions of isolation, and the magical, last-minute cure, hurt the concept's credibility.

1214739,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,B001LLH8SE,Jeremy Storly,"[6, 6]","The film begins with close-ups of red and green stoplights that evoke the human retina interspersed with unfocused and above-shots of traffic, forcing us to consider the theme of vision immediately, in the first few frames.  Likewise, the shorts of the intersection remind us of the retina.  Soon, we realize, the image has been somehow filtered, and seems to allow only shades of red and green, making the viewer effectively blind.  Soon after, as in the award-winning novel by Jose Saramago, the first mysterious case of blindness occurs.Fernando Meirelles, a brilliant director whose other films include the tremendous _City of God_, is not without a vision for this film.  By establishing a mood that alternates between the claustrophobic and agoraphobic, he attempts to capture the sense of blindness which Saramago pulls off on the page so expertly, but which is difficult to pull off on screen.  Meirelles is sensitive to the challenge that faces him, and he approaches the task admirably and smartly.  His film is an adaptation, not an appropriation, and he pays due homage to his source material.  What works in-text sometimes does not work on-screen, as any great director knows, but any attempt to improve on Saramago would seem egotistical.  Meirelles knows this, and he makes every noble attempt to faithfully adapt Saramago's work to the screen.The trouble is, everything happens so fast that we have little time to absorb it all.  Characters speak, act, and move on, and we have little time to dwell on their emotions.  When the woman suffers and dies after giving herself over to the enemy, we are provided with a sense of injustice, but are left with little sorrow.  The fast-paced technique that worked well in a film like _City of God_, which inspires an abhorrence for injustice and involves the viewer in the chaos felt by its characters, does not work in the more internally-driven _Blindness_, which requires more time to appreciate the pathos.  In the novel, we come to know the doctor's wife as a sort of philosopher-king; on-screen we see her as a frazzled woman thrown about by the influences of her environment.  It is not that the director does not have vision, and it is not that Julianne Moore does not do everything in her power to pull off the part; it is that we feel this is all happening in fast-motion.  Even the 'dog of tears', a powerful symbol in the novel, becomes just a dog in the film.  We need more time; sometimes just a few more lingering seconds could have turned a cursory moment into a poignant and memorable episode.At times, we are given the opportunity to see what a film like this could have become.  The 'raining' scene is a nice pause in the action, and it is notable that it is probably one of the most memorable scenes in the film.  Likewise, the scene late in the movie between Danny Glover and Alice Braga works well, partially because it is a minor scene that is given the attention it deserves.Some have criticized the film's ending.  In my opinion, this is the one time the director is spot-on.  With Saramago, there are no such things as clean resolutions, and Meirelles is at sensitive to this.Meirelles had his vision.

Moore (actress) can still see for no apparent reason since she insists on touching her husband after he tells her it is contagious and not to.The biggest head scratcher is this - there are no doctors researching them and instaed of being monitored all people are quarantined, forgotten about and told to 'distribute food amongst thmselves'. What really doesnt add up is how organized these 'blind' people are when they need to be to benefit the film. How do you know what food is in what boxes? Perishables and not? They could barely find a cot to sleep on before.Of course the 'head' of the opposing ward has to be so evil and vile that they want to barter food for sex w/ the other husbands women. And not only does J. Moore find her husband cheating during the movie but the fact that he basically sent her over as a whore a handful of times doesn't seem to bother her too much since she continues to be affectinate towards him as the movie goes on. And of course Moore starts out as a wife who is a homemaker w/ a heavy liking for wine but rises up to be the hero when gov't soldiers try taking away their freedoms. These women bounce back in a remarkable way considering they are gangraped almost daily for food. The de-evolution of people was way over the top especially with everyone instead of working together just trying to manipulate the other. Not believable to me at all w/ their afflictions. These people can't even figure out how to find a bathroom much less organize, sell and keep food for any length of time.I found this movie to be unrealistic, way over the top and had scenes where truly blind people would never had made it out of. I'm shocked that J. Moore signed up for a movie like this one.

It's kinda like an updated Testament-ish inspired piece, or it wishes it were that.. Now, I don't have a problem with the fact the blindness is never explained; many great films have the same kind of hook.. Also,  I didn't have a problem with the acting..well, not from the main characters anyway. I like Julianne Moore & Mark Ruffalo; although from time to time I kept thinking Moore was acting/playing that character as if she were Laura Liney playing the character..maybe that's just me.. afterall, both have similar acting styles....What I did have a BIG problem with is the fact that Julianne Moore's character, not only being the only one able to see, but the fact that when the hoods took over, she did nothing, when she had ample opportunity to do something. That was one of the main reasons she stayed & said she was blind like her husband. Had she taken control, as any normal person would; especially when we've been led to believe that her character was a strong & determined female from the moment she stepped on screen. Also, the film could have been wrapped up in about 90 mins.. The movie was 121 Mins, but it felt sluggish, tiresome & Titanic-ish in it's pace.. Though I did like the shovel scene where she flips the police or guards off..but that's all the protesting she did? The inflicted did nothing to deserve being treated like hardcore criminals & even shot like in the one sceneFinally, there's the ending...which was downright odd.. it just suddenly ends.. There's no huge revalation or climax.. It's as if they ran out of budget or got bored making it (I was certainly bored by the end). Unless the ending was the first guy regaining his sight means EVERYONE will be getting their sight back?? OMG, then the clean up..and now they gotta discuss the rapes and acting like wild animals.. Afterall, we really aren't far off from jungle creatures.. So there's a sequel right there... Ugh, on second thought, I don't wanna see any MOORE of this movie..I referenced 1983's underrated ""Testament"", & while that film was about nuclear holocaust & the aftermath, this film really wasn't about anything or anything important, which is ultimately frustrating because I really wanted to like this much more than I actually do...I also insist that when you have more than 5 studios/production companies making/financing a movie, it's usually because it's going to be a stinker, and I counted over a dozen companies involved here.. and I think it's safe to say that none of them made any money off this mess.",2,JULIANNE Could Have Done MOORE,1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,2758,"['***Yeah', 'going', 'contain', 'spoilers', '.ooops', ""y'all"", '***Okay..I', 'just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'used', '2', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'based', 'trailer', 'most', 'movies', 'today', ""'m"", 'left', 'feeling', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'incomplete', 'project..', 'kinda', 'updated', 'Testament-ish', 'inspired', 'piece', 'were', 'that..', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'fact', 'blindness', 'never', 'explained', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'hook..', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'acting..well', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'anyway', 'like', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'time', 'time', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Moore', 'was', 'acting/playing', 'that', 'character', 'were', 'Laura', 'Liney', 'playing', 'character..maybe', 'just', 'me..', 'afterall', 'have', 'similar', 'acting', 'styles', '.What', 'did', 'have', 'BIG', 'problem', 'fact', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'able', 'see', 'fact', 'when', 'hoods', 'took', 'over', 'did', 'nothing', 'when', 'had', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'do', 'something', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'stayed', 'said', 'was', 'blind', 'husband', 'Had', 'taken', 'control', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'especially', 'when', ""'ve"", 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'character', 'was', 'strong', 'determined', 'female', 'moment', 'stepped', 'screen', 'Also', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wrapped', 'up', 'about', '90', 'mins..', 'movie', 'was', '121', 'Mins', 'felt', 'sluggish', 'tiresome', 'Titanic-ish', 'pace..', 'did', 'shovel', 'scene', 'where', 'police', 'guards', 'off..but', 'protesting', 'did', 'inflicted', 'did', 'nothing', 'deserve', 'being', 'treated', 'hardcore', 'criminals', 'even', 'shot', 'one', 'sceneFinally', 'ending', 'was', 'downright', 'odd..', 'just', 'suddenly', 'ends..', 'huge', 'revalation', 'climax..', 'ran', 'budget', 'got', 'bored', 'making', 'was', 'certainly', 'bored', 'end', 'ending', 'was', 'first', 'guy', 'regaining', 'sight', 'EVERYONE', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'sight', 'back', 'OMG', 'then', 'clean', 'up..and', 'now', 'got', 'ta', 'rapes', 'acting', 'wild', 'animals..', 'Afterall', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'far', 'jungle', 'creatures..', 'So', 'sequel', 'right', 'there', 'Ugh', 'second', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'see', 'MOORE', 'movie..I', 'referenced', '1983', 'underrated', 'Testament', 'film', 'was', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'aftermath', 'film', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'anything', 'important', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'much', 'more', 'actually', 'do', 'also', 'insist', 'when', 'have', 'more', '5', 'studios/production', 'companies', 'making/financing', 'movie', 'usually', 'going', 'be', 'stinker', 'counted', 'over', 'dozen', 'companies', 'involved', 'here..', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'none', 'made', 'money', 'mess']",Blindness

1214745,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B001LLH8SE,kacunnin,"[3, 5]","Jose Saramago's Nobel Prize winning novel BLINDNESS is an extended metaphor about the human condition.  We are all blind, Saramago says, and then he shows us in graphic detail what he thinks about human nature.  We are violent, selfish, greedy, weak, and ultimately we will fail each other.  His story, about the sudden onslaught of some unexplained contagious disease that renders everyone (or almost everyone) blind, is metaphoric; it was never meant to be taken as realistic.  This is not a science fiction novel, or a horror story, or even a psychological thriller.  It's a brooding, depressing castigation of the entire human race.So is it any surprise that the movie doesn't work?  Metaphors are very hard to translate to film.  In the movie, we actually SEE the blindness take over, from one character to the next - and we want to know why.  We see one character apparently immune to the blindness - and we want to know why.  We see the unnamed and unexplained fascistic government throw all of the sick people into some sort of run-down asylum where they are kept away from the ""seeing"" population by an armed militia - and we want to know why.  We see the filth in the hallways (these people begin defecating on the floor about 30 minutes after arriving at the facility), the brutality, the grotesque violence - and yes, we want to know why.  But Saramago wasn't interested in the details of his plot (thin as it is) - he was interested only in the brutal metaphor he was developing over 300 pages of text.  And the film isn't interested in the plot, either.I was able to enjoy some of the visual elements of the film, especially after the core characters leave the asylum and venture out into the city.  There is a feeling throughout the film that something important is being said, and I was willing to give that a chance; but beyond a general condemnation of the human race, I'm not sure what that point really is.  Overall, the ""plot holes"" so many viewers are complaining about are there because the plot doesn't matter.  If you're looking for a movie about what would really happen if everyone in the world suddenly went blind, this isn't it.

(This has been done; anybody out there see the campy ""Day of the Triffids""?  Wish I'd been watching THAT...

And as this captive society devolves, a very ""Lord of the Flies"" scenario ensues. This was interesting, and actually more believable than the psychologies shown in the initial scenes. (I had the impression those scenes were rushed through, in order to get to the grittier/meatier stuff.)  Julianne Moore is believable as the only sighted person in this Kingdom of the Blind.The final scene endeavors to encourage.

This film isn't an interesting little foray into ""what would happen to the world if everyone went blind?"" as much as it is an answer to the question ""what would happen to our democratic, moral society in the face of mass hysteria?""  There are few ideas more terrifying than contagious blindness.  The lack of explanation for this effect is what fuels the hysteria - suddenly everything we thought we knew about the world is turned upside down.The film is brutal.  It reveals everything ugly about human nature.  There are no ""good"" people, and many ""evil"" people because all morals get sacrificed when basic human needs (food, shelter, and yes, sex) are no longer satisfied.  This film punishes the senses.  Most of the time, you wish you were blind like the main characters so you did not have to see the ugliness around them.  But at the same time you cannot look away.  This film draws you in.  Also, I do like the way the scenes shift, with a fade to the white blindness and then a fade into the next scene.  Most films feel like a series of comic strip panels fed to the viewers piecemeal and in a great hurry to resolve the story.  This film takes on a slow, meandering quality, which isn't for everyone, but at least it's something different.This movie isn't the greatest, but what it is is a film you rarely see produced.  Once you get past the shock value and understand the message that is being conveyed here, it is a decent film.  I give it about 3 1/2 stars.  It isn't something I'd purchase though, personally.  Rent it if you want to see a new take on Lord of the Flies.  To be sure, the plot is contrived to drive home the point.  It's fiction.  Deal with it.The message here is rather simple: human nature is ugly, it is gross, and when we have to fight for our existence, all morality is stripped away leaving only our animal nature.

Given the premise and situation, the movie was appropriately bleak and the settings reflected that. It started off with promise. And the reactions of the newly blinded people are realistic. There's frustration, trying to cope, etc etc. Psychologically, I felt that much of the film was handled appropriately. It is very thought-provoking and this leads me to give the movie a star for effort, and another for the psychological impact.However, the plot holes in this movie made it thoroughly unenjoyable.-What's the cause of this white sickness? NEVER explained. The first victim, the Japanese man, is suddenly struck blind. There's no apparent reason for him to come down with it. He wasn't a scientist, wasn't involved in any experiment, whatever. It's just like bam! He was chosen at random by cruel Fate. And oh yeah, he just took it calmly. He didn't scream for someone to call 911 and take him to the hospital. He just for taken home by the man who eventually stole his car. He waited and lay there for his wife to come home. WTF?-How exactly is it spread? Never explained. Yeah, it's contagious, but it seems that some of the cases came from mere physical contact (not sneezing or sharing fluids or other standard methods of infection)-Why is the Doctor's wife the only one immune? ... Ditto.-The treatment these people received was appalling. Basically all these blinds are thrown into a building and left to fend for themselves. Not even people in Hazmat suits came by to check if they were okay and make sure there was adequate medical care, etc. Why weren't scientists and doctors at least keeping in contact with these people? The phones were useless because no one outside was answering them, leaving the blind people truly cut off from the outside world, WITHOUT ONE SINGLE IOTA OF HELP WHATSOEVER. Oh sure, they dumped off food. But that's it. Dumping, and leaving BLIND PEOPLE to figure out how to distribute and handle the food themselves. The fact that these people were dumped here with no attention or care is the one biggest, gaping plot hole in the movie.-What was happening to society at large? Was this a world plague or something? There's no mention if other areas/continents were infected.-If in the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king, then the Doctor's wife is a GODDESS. But she lets the King of Ward 3 do his little bully thing, instead of nipping it in the bud and taking his gun and/or food. And then she let these women go through that.-The timeframe. ... What timeframe? What's the span of the events in the movie? A week, at least, for sure. A month? Probably (due to the deterioration of the facility and the increasing dirtiness of the people). Two months? I don't know. We're never told how much time is progressing.-Mrs. Doctor going into the dark basement. Gee, what a SMART idea. Everyone else is relying on you to take care of them, you're the only one with eyes, and you risk your life in the darkness, what if she fell and broke a leg or something? Everyone'd be royally screwed, then.-The ending. ... WTF? No more soldiers guarding the facility, just like that, no explanations. Great, the guy who first went blind regained his sight so apparently everyone else (who is still alive, at least) will regain sight. But again... how? Why? What happens to the world? Is the cause of blindness ever discovered?The movie had TONS of potential. It was a fascinating idea and it started off well and progressed well (aside the gaping plot holes I explained above) but it started to drag on and I was fidgeting around as I impatiently waited for the conclusion.I read the book after I saw the movie, and I will say that I liked the book better, but the movie provided great visuals.

The story of an unknown plague that is making people go blind is both intriguing and unsettling.The government forces the infected to be corralled in an old abandon quarantine site. What bothered me most in this film is when a small group of these infected take over the complex with one pistol and start rationing food for money and sex to the rest of the infected, the only person who can see in the complex, goes along with letting these scum rape her and the other women. These people are blind!?, how hard would it be to just walk up and crack this guy in the head with a pipe? I know they have a blind person on their side who was blind since birth giving them an advantage over the others, but this is a very noisy and disgustingly smelly place and no amount of blind training would make it possible to hear or smell anyone getting close to you. It's just ridiculous as this women is presented as a very brave person who opts to go into this place to take care of her husband.Another problem is that it is just too long and drawn out with long stretches of unnecessary scenes.

1214756,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B001LLH8SE,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[2, 3]","Fernando Mereilles (City of God,The Constant Gardener) has accomplished something quite remarkable with this adaptation of Nobel Prize Winner Jose Saramago's most powerful novel.  The cinematographers employed a unique palette and approach to evoke the ""white blindness"" described in the book, and the screenplay gets right at the heart of this story about the ease with which we can lose our humanity, and the possibility that some will retain it even in the harshest of circumstances.  Those who criticize the film for failing to explain why the blindness occurred or why one woman retains her vision throughout, are missing the point.  All of this goes unexplained in the novel as well, and the narrator of the novel does no more than to speculate.  The real point is that Saramago, like Camus and Kafka  and other great novelists working in similar vein, is not aiming for ""scientific realism"" but for philosophical truth, and what he wants is not so much a plausible scenario but a situation in which certain themes can be explored.  In this the filmmakers were wise to follow Saramago's lead and simply plunge the viewer into the heart of a mystery.  (Although it has to be said that a highly contagious airborne virus that affects the nervous system to induce blindness is more plausible than a lot of science fiction - and the idea that some people would be immune, and that the story would focus on one of them, is not all that weird.  The media hysteria over a few cases of ""swine flu"" suggests that the reaction depicted here to a much more severe and rapidly spreading epidemic is not so distant from the truth.)One element of the novel that I wish there had been a way to incorporate more into the film is the inquisitive and exploratory nature of the narration.  In spite of its holding out a ray of hope for humanity in the small band of strangers who stick together and help each other at all costs, this is a dark story, both in the novel and as depicted in this film.  What made the book less, frankly, depressing, was that along with telling the story, the narrator wonders at odd things people do and at why things are the way they are.  His meandering queries and meditations, that interweave themselves in and throughout the story, bring a light and amusing touch to an otherwise difficult narrative.  It's hard to imagine how the filmmakers might have done this - perhaps they could have used voiceover, but I think that would have taken away from the immediacy of the story they wanted to tell.  Part of what makes this film adaptation so effective is that it pushes the viewer (paradoxically but effectively) to adopt the ""point of view"" of the blind, introducing overexposed, half seen imagery at pivotal junctures that make it seem as though one cannot see what is going on but is being jostled along and must ""feel"" ones way through to a semi-coherent grasp of a situation.  I do think they managed this, which is quite a feat, and it would have been a distraction to include a narrator.  So light touches, meditations on minutia, could only appear very seldom in this story.  The large poodle that appears late, who retains his manners unlike most of the ravenous mutts wandering streets, struck me as one such whimsical touch.  Others include a long moment listening to radio, or a shower in the rain.  A few other light touches bring small relief from the overall bleak tone of the still remarkable and powerful film.Extras: A documentary included with the dvd, ""A Vision of Blindness"" is among the best of the ""making of"" type documentaries I've seen in a long time - it felt like a ""real"" documentary and not like the usual ""puff piece"" that consists mostly of actors saying how great the director was, along with flattering behind the scenes footage.  There was all that, but I had a sense that the director of the documentary had his own voice and created something artistic in its own right.  It follows the basic trajectory from the difficulty acquiring the rights from Saramago himself, who had never before had the confidence to entrust his work to a director, to the completion of the film and Saramago's enthusiastic and tearful reaction upon seeing it.  But the doc covers a great deal between and follows the process of developing the film in some detail from concept to completion.",4,Very effective adaptation of Saramago's story on film,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,4325,"['Fernando', 'Mereilles', 'City', 'God', 'Constant', 'Gardener', 'accomplished', 'something', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'adaptation', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'Winner', 'Jose', 'Saramago', 'most', 'powerful', 'novel', 'cinematographers', 'employed', 'unique', 'palette', 'approach', 'evoke', 'white', 'blindness', 'described', 'book', 'screenplay', 'right', 'heart', 'story', 'ease', 'can', 'lose', 'humanity', 'possibility', 'will', 'retain', 'even', 'harshest', 'circumstances', 'who', 'criticize', 'film', 'failing', 'explain', 'why', 'blindness', 'occurred', 'why', 'one', 'woman', 'vision', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'unexplained', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'narrator', 'novel', 'more', 'speculate', 'real', 'point', 'Saramago', 'Camus', 'Kafka', 'other', 'great', 'novelists', 'working', 'similar', 'vein', 'not', 'aiming', 'scientific', 'realism', 'philosophical', 'truth', 'what', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'situation', 'certain', 'themes', 'can', 'be', 'explored', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'wise', 'follow', 'Saramago', 'lead', 'simply', 'plunge', 'viewer', 'heart', 'mystery', 'be', 'said', 'highly', 'contagious', 'airborne', 'virus', 'nervous', 'system', 'induce', 'blindness', 'more', 'plausible', 'lot', 'science', 'fiction', 'idea', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'immune', 'story', 'would', 'focus', 'one', 'not', 'weird', 'media', 'hysteria', 'few', 'cases', 'swine', 'flu', 'reaction', 'depicted', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'severe', 'rapidly', 'spreading', 'epidemic', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'truth', 'One', 'element', 'novel', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'way', 'incorporate', 'more', 'film', 'inquisitive', 'exploratory', 'nature', 'narration', 'spite', 'holding', 'out', 'ray', 'hope', 'humanity', 'small', 'band', 'strangers', 'who', 'stick', 'together', 'help', 'other', 'costs', 'dark', 'story', 'novel', 'depicted', 'film', 'What', 'made', 'book', 'less', 'frankly', 'depressing', 'was', 'telling', 'story', 'narrator', 'wonders', 'odd', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are', 'meandering', 'queries', 'meditations', 'interweave', 'story', 'bring', 'light', 'amusing', 'touch', 'otherwise', 'difficult', 'narrative', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'voiceover', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'immediacy', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell', 'Part', 'what', 'film', 'adaptation', 'so', 'effective', 'viewer', 'paradoxically', 'effectively', 'adopt', 'point', 'view', 'blind', 'introducing', 'overexposed', 'half', 'seen', 'imagery', 'pivotal', 'junctures', 'make', 'seem', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'being', 'jostled', 'must', 'feel', 'ones', 'way', 'semi-coherent', 'grasp', 'situation', 'do', 'think', 'managed', 'quite', 'feat', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'distraction', 'include', 'narrator', 'So', 'light', 'touches', 'meditations', 'minutia', 'could', 'only', 'appear', 'very', 'seldom', 'story', 'large', 'poodle', 'late', 'who', 'manners', 'most', 'ravenous', 'mutts', 'wandering', 'streets', 'struck', 'one', 'such', 'whimsical', 'touch', 'Others', 'include', 'long', 'moment', 'listening', 'radio', 'shower', 'rain', 'few', 'other', 'light', 'touches', 'bring', 'small', 'relief', 'overall', 'bleak', 'tone', 'still', 'remarkable', 'powerful', 'film.Extras', 'documentary', 'included', 'dvd', 'Vision', 'Blindness', 'best', 'making', 'type', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'felt', 'real', 'documentary', 'not', 'usual', 'puff', 'piece', 'mostly', 'actors', 'saying', 'how', 'great', 'director', 'was', 'flattering', 'scenes', 'footage', 'was', 'had', 'sense', 'director', 'documentary', 'had', 'own', 'voice', 'created', 'something', 'artistic', 'own', 'right', 'basic', 'trajectory', 'difficulty', 'acquiring', 'rights', 'Saramago', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'had', 'confidence', 'entrust', 'work', 'director', 'completion', 'film', 'Saramago', 'enthusiastic', 'tearful', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'doc', 'great', 'deal', 'process', 'developing', 'film', 'detail', 'concept', 'completion']",Blindness

I don't know if I'd have the courage to see it to the end or cut myself short and my loved ones with the idea of sparing everyone from the pain, suffering, and complete and utter despair of going blind only to die shortly after.It's a tiny bit like the ending sequence of &#34;The Mist&#34; when the car runs out of gas and all inside the car are still surrounded by the mist and are &#34;blind&#34; to what is going on outside of their small space.  The final decision in that situation is where I'm drawing a parallel to the movie I'm reviewing.With that said - the movie itself and how the charctaers act or interact after the opening sequences is what leaves quite a lot to be desired for me overall.

Like other reviewers that hated this movie, I also admit that it starts great. A potentially gripping story begins (the potential to be up there with one of the best sci fi movies ever), but instead of expanding, exploring and developing the movie breaks down on so many levels in front and behind the camera. It basically becomes cheap horror by doing what ALL LOW BUDGET films do to provide suspense; dumbing down all the protagonists and making the antognists overly annoying and ingenious. That is all I will say about that. However, what really got me was the bad acting (sorry Juliane Moore carries this movie nowhere for me, her supporting cast are non-actors or good actors with no screen time).

You only have to see similar reviews of ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy on this website to see the same types of grumbles from the sort of people who would be better off reading ""The Beano"", than indulging in serious intellectual pursuit. ""Ooh, it doesn't tell me what the apocalypse was"", ""ooh, there isn't any punctuation"", the same with this film, ""ooh, why is everyone blind"", ooh, why this, why that?"". Pitiful.Rant over! Deep breath. OK, as a scientist and a rationalist, I myself have sometimes had to take films or books to task for omissions in plot or continuity that genuinely ruin the film, usually in prequels and sequels that take liberties with the already defined paradigms that the plot should be built on. That being said, like The Road, it makes no real difference in ""Blindness"" to the story why people went blind, they just did. Accept it. This is not an essay on communicable diseases or an instructional and educational film on disease management, it is a social commentary on how ordinary people might act in extraordinary circumstances.Ok, the Japanese ""Patient Zero"" does act with unusual calmness, and it might be considered unusual that the quarantined people are placed in an asylum to fend for themselves. How then the actions and motivations of the people unfold is the point of the story.No-one can say that ""There is no way that people would do that if.."" How do you know? ""There is no way that people would sit by whilst millions of their countrymen were systematically rounded up, had their human rights taken away and were gassed and incinerated"". (Germany). ""There is no way that neighbours would suddenly turn on each other and hack each other to death by the million"" (Rwanda). ""There is no way people would murder and rape their neighbours by the thousand in a modern country, no way"". Did you ever go to Bosnia? 1996? Ifor? ""There is no way that The Authorities would do this, that, the other.."". Did any of you left in New Orleans after Katrina feel that The Authorities did a particularly fine job, or cover themselves with glory either before or immediately after the hurricane?Of course, we would presume because we are bought up on Hollywood fantasies that ""The Authorities"" would handle the situation, and Hazmat teams and nice people from CDC would run nice lovely hospitals and sort everything out. But for reasons unknown, this doesn't happen in the film, and it doesn't matter. The blindness and the subsequent inaction of the authorities is just a vehicle to strip away the fundamental building blocks of society. That The Authorities will look after us, and that we can look after ourselves. Now imagine the Authorities wont look after us, and our ability to look after ourselves is removed by our lack of sight.With all of that stripped away, we then have to fall back on our fortitude and strength of character. No-one knows how they will react in a disaster. Its easy to imagine that we will be the ones to take command and assume leadership, but experience shows that often a large majority of people will freeze, some become catatonic and not be able to deal with a situation like that. When something as fundamental as sight is removed, anything could happen.This is the situation that faces our protagonists. Yes, I felt frustration that Julianne Moore's character did not make a better fist of things, that she allowed the women of the facility to be treated as they were, but she was overwhelmed by the situation and only snapped out of it when she hit rock bottom, and even then her actions might not have been considered terribly effective, but again, until we have been faced with similar trauma, we cannot judge her actions with any certainty.""Why didn't the other wards gang up on ward three and fight them?"" We might well ask ""Why didn't inmates of the concentration camps attack their guards and escape?"" The answer, fear?I found the pace of the film slow, but the acting and direction top notch.

1214763,A1KVUPBV07ZCJL,B001LLH8SE,Phil Elmore,"[1, 3]","I was originally intrigued by the idea of this film based on, strangely enough, the outrage it caused among those with vision impairment.  The offense taken seemed to be based on the idea that, suddenly struck blind, society descends into savagery, and thus the film is saying that blind people are less ""civilized"" than those with sight.After watching the film, I didn't see it that way.  As has already been stated countless times by other reviewers, this is an allegorical film about humans' ability to brutalize one another -- indeed, their penchant for and willingness to embrace doing so.  As is necessary in films of this type, a great many people are much more quick to victimize (or callously disregard the helplessness of) their fellow citizens than I think they truly would be, at least in the early stages of a society-wide plague.  Why is it that filmmakers are so quick to see members of the military as unfeeling monsters only too happy to deny medical treatment to wounded prisoners, quick on the trigger and ill-prepared to cope with stress?  This is a caricature of a stereotype, and this type of cheap characterization is only too common in the movie.There are a few redeeming points.  One character, a prostitute, is simply brilliantly done, both in her introduction to the viewer and in her sudden plight (not to mention how she is later utilized in the film, as a means of contrasting Julianne Moore's transformation from wife and lover to caretaker and mother (for Moore's film husband begins to resent her and eventually acts on this resentment).  Danny Glover, a wise, one-eyed blind man (HA! SYMBOLISM!) is strangely underutilized, which is a shame, for there's depth to mine in his character's strangely cheerful reaction to the plague.Certainly, elments of the ""plague of blindness"" bring to mind zombie films, from the quarantine of victims to the willingness of military personnel to shoot those so interned.  The rest of the movie is simply a bleak meditation on the animal nature of people who are, for whatever reason, suddenly freed from the boundaries of polite society.Some of the practical aspects of a world in which almost everyone is blind are disturbing and difficult to watch (or contemplate).  Consider bathrooms that nobody can clean, or trash that nobody can see to clear away: it's a formula for filth and degradation when the blind inmates of the quarantine camp are left to fend for themselves.Roger Ebert stated very plainly that he found ""Blindness"" extremely unpleasant to watch, from its distorted camera work to its intrusive, overly loud soundtrack.  He wasn't wrong.  The subject matter is equally hard to watch.  The movie is, frankly, depressing and revolting, making it less than enjoyable but something bordering on interesting.  It's worth watching for the performances of its actors, I guess, which were quite good (Mark Ruffalo, who seems flat at first, eventually proves quite capable and subtle in his portrayal of Moore's husband).Those who enjoy entries in the ""The End Of The World As We Know It"" (TEOTWAWKI) genre will want to add it to their resumes of watched  movies... but many more will, I think, be just as happy passing it up.  I have to admit that, even now, I'm not sure how I feel about it.  Is it a ""good"" movie?  Not really.  Is it well-executed?  Only in part; it has deep flaws, ranging from its plot to its filmmaking.  Is it thought-provoking?

The logic behind its greatness is this:Blindness, the film, is based on the 1995 book Ensaio sobre a Cegueira. The book's author, Jos&eacute; de Sousa Saramago, was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1998.Ergo #1: it is a good book.Saramago was reluctant to sell the book's movie rights, fearing a film would do an injustice to his work, but eventually acquiesced (not to the highest bidder, mind you) because he felt this group, with Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles at the helm, understood his vision, and their proposed treatment captured the essence of his book.Ergo #2: it's a good movie.Many a defense of the film has shouted ""If you don't like this movie, read the book and you will!"" I haven't read the book so my reaction to Blindness, the film, is based on the sub par experience of merely watching the movie. Little things like the fact that not one actor in this film acted in such a way as to convince me that they might be blind should matter.Blindness is a story about a society where everyone except the star goes blind. It focuses on a group that is quarantined in a well-lit, ahem, but over-crowded asylum. Conditions degrade very quickly and chaos ensues. It's horrific.I went to see this film knowing nothing about it. I had seen the director's earlier film City of God and thought it was magnificent. I liked the BLindness movie poster and I'm a big Julianne Moore fan. She's very good in the film. She's the only one who is not blind and at one point, while showering in a room full of blind people, she is the first and only one to hear the faint sounds of a radio being played in another room. That's good acting! It would be wrong to object to the unlikelihood of this by invoking the prejudice that blind people develop a heightened sense of hearing, the same bigotry that doesn't know blind people walk around naked and poop on the floor, like they do in this faithful filmic adaptation of a book.The Blindness in this film, however, is a special Blindness. Everything doesn't go black, it goes white. It's an allegory. The director attempts to recreate this experience for the viewing audience by washing out the film to a milky white blur which is fine in concept but its execution seems entirely random--to the point of directorial conceit. Like when the husband and the hooker, who share a bond the husband can't enjoy with his wife (she's not blind), are having sex, we watch them through the milky white blur. Why? Because it's the arty European thing to do. There will be gratuitous sex and the wife will understand.Before the big gang rape scene, there is a scene where the really bad guy, the guy who conveniently found a loaded weapon and proclaimed himself ""King"", is barking orders at everyone. Julianne's character heckles him and he snaps ""I will never forget your voice"" while pointing the gun at her. Blind people have an acute sense of hearing and can do that. But just before Julianne participates in the big rape scene, she talks to him face to face and he seems to have forgotten her voice. If it seems confusing as to why Julianne's character would go through the humiliation of all the women being raped, one fatally, before using her meager advantage of sight to kill this guy, I guess we are to conclude that rape is the only reason a woman will kill. Anything less than that, up to and including the mere threat of rape at gunpoint, and she will just suffer.And you should too.

It certainly did for me.The first half of the story takes place in a ward whose occupants have inexplicably gone blind and been quarantined. In unexpected naive b movie fashion the authorities and its incompetent police forces are the oppressor. That is until some of the ward unit occupants decide to dictate over their peers.The second half may raise your interest as it is set in a very surreal outside world. Nevertheless, empty streets filled with trash and people stumbling around scrambling for food will make two words roam in your head: ""zombie movie""...unless you've never seen one.The morals of the story are the same you'll find in better prison, holocaust and catastrophy movies. The ones of failure and strength of human nature in times of extreme distress. Most of us viewers will not find many surprises in this film. The acting is solid and the cinematography beautiful, however I doubt it will prevent some of you to press the fast forward button.Other problems are the fact that there is not much room to identify with any of the characters. One does not know where the whole story takes place. The cityscape and backround music are reminiscent of South American metropoles, but almost all speak English as in American English.

Would civilization keep it's dignity, or would it all fall apart at the blink of an eye?If one looks at the movie this way, than this is really a great piece of work.

Then, after she leaves where the stocked food is, apparently a bunch of blind people start following her and smothering her, causing her husband to have to run in and save her. That scene may work good in a farce, but in a serious drama, it just comes off as unintentionally hilarious.Blindness is a film directed by they man who made the ever-so-brilliant ""City of God"", a movie that was very disturbing but made us think. And while Blindness does have excellent visuals, the script is very weak at times. This film has a great cast- Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore, and even Danny Glover are among the few shining stars in this movie.In Blindness, a man is driving home and has just gone blind. Another man saves him and takes him home. Later, the next day, everyone has gone blind except for a Doctor's Wife. The blind are then taken to a building where they are stored in, with The Doctor's Wife being the only one in there with sight. There, A blind man in Ward 3 commands everyone to live under their rules. They have to pay for food. After everyone runs out, they state that they take must take the men's women if they need food. The people then rebel against them and fight for their own survival.This isn't a bad movie. It has excellent acting, great visuals and a good cast of talented actors. Moore proves herself to be an excellent actress here, and really gives a great performance. However, this movie feels very shallow and empty. The plot is good but contradicts itself at times.You know your movie is in trouble when the most interesting scene is where The Doctor's Wife, pretending to be blind, locates a shovel and flips the bird at the guards watching. And you also know it's in trouble when you find yourself laughing at scenes that are supposed to be serious.Overall, this is an OK movie, but be warned, it is very complicated and hollow.",3,The seeing eye has gone blind,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,2026,"['One', 'particularly', 'wierd', 'scene', 'Blindness', 'when', 'Doctor', 'Wife', 'grocery', 'store', 'food', 'where', 'stocked', 'shelves', 'are', 'empty', 'Then', 'where', 'stocked', 'food', 'apparently', 'bunch', 'blind', 'people', 'start', 'following', 'smothering', 'causing', 'husband', 'have', 'run', 'save', 'scene', 'may', 'work', 'good', 'farce', 'serious', 'drama', 'just', 'off', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious.Blindness', 'film', 'directed', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'ever-so-brilliant', 'City', 'God', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'made', 'think', 'Blindness', 'have', 'excellent', 'visuals', 'script', 'very', 'weak', 'times', 'film', 'great', 'cast-', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'even', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'are', 'few', 'shining', 'stars', 'movie.In', 'Blindness', 'man', 'driving', 'home', 'just', 'gone', 'blind', 'man', 'home', 'Later', 'next', 'day', 'everyone', 'gone', 'blind', 'Doctor', 'Wife', 'blind', 'are', 'then', 'taken', 'building', 'where', 'are', 'stored', 'Doctor', 'Wife', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'sight', 'blind', 'man', 'Ward', '3', 'everyone', 'live', 'rules', 'have', 'pay', 'food', 'everyone', 'out', 'state', 'take', 'must', 'take', 'men', 'women', 'need', 'food', 'people', 'then', 'rebel', 'fight', 'own', 'survival.This', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'excellent', 'acting', 'great', 'visuals', 'good', 'cast', 'talented', 'actors', 'Moore', 'be', 'excellent', 'actress', 'here', 'really', 'great', 'performance', 'However', 'movie', 'very', 'shallow', 'empty', 'plot', 'good', 'times.You', 'know', 'movie', 'trouble', 'when', 'most', 'interesting', 'scene', 'where', 'Doctor', 'Wife', 'pretending', 'be', 'blind', 'shovel', 'bird', 'guards', 'watching', 'also', 'know', 'trouble', 'when', 'find', 'laughing', 'scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious.Overall', 'OK', 'movie', 'be', 'warned', 'very', 'complicated', 'hollow']",Blindness

There are those who say the film is vile but I wasn't disgusted, it didn't leave me depressed, it did nothing but leave me feeling indifferent (the worse possible reaction to a film). Any subtext in the novel by Jose Saramago is completely missing in the film. The story centers on an outbreak of blindness which prompts government to confine the afflicted in a housing facility without any supervision leaving them to their own devices; among them is one seeing woman. There are many problems with the script like the lack of character development, there isn't enough revealed about any of the characters to care much about them. The biggest problem in the film is the premise its built upon which isn't plausible in any way, if you watch a film like '28 Days Later' for example the premise is not centered in reality but the reactions to the events are; therefore its easy to suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be transported by the story. Blindness fails in this department. One example of how stupid the script becomes is the case of one blind man taking control and lording it over the other blind members, you would think the one seeing woman would have an advantage over the blind dictator if not the situation (its not as if any of the blind people would know her from any one else) but this does not happen right away, instead she complies to all of his insane demands allowing herself and others to be degraded by the situation. Now if her character had been developed or if there was a discernible subtext we may have some insight into why she doesn't act at the time and what prompts her to act later but because those elements are missing we are none the wiser. This story is supposed to enlighten us into the deeper nature of human beings once civility and society are jeopardized but it fails to pull it off. I found no in-depth view of human nature, as a matter of fact The Walking Dead does a better job of doing this in one episode than this dragged out failure of a film and I expect a lot less from a zombie flick than I do from a film based on a Saramago novel.

The movie is faithful to the book.The story suffers from what I will call the short-term view. Of course there is bound to be chaos and confusion in the short-term; there is hardly any surprise in that. The entire story feels like a voyeuristic romp through desperation and depravity, without the redeeming quality of saying anything important about what it means to be human.When a large number of severely handicapped people - some of them criminals - are thrown together and forced to fight for survival in a hellhole without the benefit of any civilized law and order, what would you expect to happen? The singing of Kumbaya while roasting s'mores around a campfire? Do you think that the ""true nature"" of a person can be judged by how that person behaves when faced with some horrible circumstance? Whether it's good or bad circumstances, you can't always predict who will be the hero or the villain, though it's safe to say that the majority falls somewhere inbetween.Could the blindness be an allegory for some other blind spots we have?
