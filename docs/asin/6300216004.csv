[Should you ever allow a stranger into your home?[ Is his talk about religion? Watch those hands! Will he leave fingerprints? He leaves. Elsewhere Morris eats his mother's breakfast. A telephone call summons him to work. Gill reviews the newspaper then calls from home. Morris is on the job and talks to a witness about a description. She is hazy on details. Another day arrives. Gill knocks on another door and gains entry. [How does he select his victims?] Then he calls the police! He knows about telephone tracing (old technology). Back home he reads the newspaper. The police try to create a likeness. [No Identikit?] There is no match on the fingerprints.Morris talks to that witness, they ride a bus. He can't overlook any possibility. Gill visits another apartment. He has a free gift for a woman. But her sister drops in! There is comedy in Morris' talk with his mother. Gill goes to work in a theater. [Acting skills?] A story in the newspaper gets a response. [One ruse used by the police.] The police replay the conversation. Gill visits another apartment, dressed as a policeman! Later a disguised Gill visits a bar and finds a friend who will offer shelter. [Believable?] Morris finds a clue, but arrives too late. Gill calls from a restaurant about the reinstatement. [Do dark glasses disguise or call attention to the wearer?] Morris takes his lady friend on a boat ride. They talk. A midget shows up to confess to the police about those five stranglers. [Is this really funny?] Morris gets an idea for a ruse. It gets a telephone call from the strangler. ""You are very clever."" The detectives arrive too late.Morris brings Katherine Palmer home. Will she pass the test? She smokes a cigarette. [Is this funny?] The police report the arrest of a suspect. Gill shows up at Katherine's apartment. This time he calls in advance. But she gets a warning telephone call in time! Gill flees to a theater. The police arrive to search the theater. They find no one there. Did they overlook somebody? Morris asks questions about the wardrobe department. Then he takes a souvenir! He returns secretly. Gill tries to escape and is shot. But Morris is knocked out by a sand bag. Gill asks for forgiveness. [Nobody heard those shots? Where was Morris' partner?]This story is based on the Boston Strangler whose recurring murders scared many in the mid 1960s. While the press imagined a single man as the suspect, the real killer was married with a child. Who knows what sets off a serial killer? There is another movie about the ""Boston Strangler"" which may be better. The comedy scenes detract from this movie about a serial killer. There may be a book on this subject.

219703,A16F2K8VG7GDS9,6300216004,"Daniel Friedman ""dfja17""","[15, 16]","Nowadays, when it seems that a successful film has to be either a big holiday or summer special-effects blockbuster, or a cheap independent circuit success, it makes one long for the days when good films with good stories were made for modest budgets and provided a decent piece of entertainment without overloading the senses. This dying breed of the movies is still around, however, and although often under appreciated, should be sought out. One case in point is No Way to Treat a Lady, a black comedy that combines a crime drama with the often humorous relationships men have with their mothers.In spite of the film being a thriller, we know from the beginning who the bad guy is. It's Rod Steiger, who gets to really stretch and ham it up as a theater manager/serial killer who murders each of his victims in some outlandish disguise to win their trust. George Segal is the cop who must crack the case and, at the same time, fend off his wonderfully annoying mother, Eileen Heckart (whose running gag line, &quot;Who ever heard of a Jewish cop?&quot; gets repeated over and over again throughout). Steiger's character is one of those vain killers who checks the newspaper for reports of his exploits and who takes to calling Segal when the facts are reported wrong or when he wants to taunt the authorities. Segal is rather bland, although it's not really his fault since the role doesn't give him much to do other than to react to the other characters, particularly his mother, Steiger, and Lee Remick, as his love interest and would-be victim of the murderer. Steiger goes way, way over the top, but it works because the film has set him up to be not only flamboyant, but overreactive to mother issues of his own. His various disguises get odder and odder as the film moves along, and when it shifts from comedy into resolution of the crime mode, his character becomes that much more menacing, not because he's funny but because we learn, as Segal puts the pieces together, that he is honestly and truly deranged.Remick serves as the breath of fresh air, only because her character is the only one who isn't dealing with some sort of emotional crisis.

His  flamboyant portrayals are perhaps borne out of his real life highly strung,  emotional state, where his characterizations are often used as a release  valve (take his Napoleon in Waterloo, made shortly after his separation  after ten years from Claire Bloom). Here too his performance is galvanized  through his emotions into an unforgettable roller coaster ride you'll just  want to repeat over and over. He plays a middle aged theater owner, who  through a warped obsession with his mother, turns to killing women in the  locality of a similar age. His theatrical background means he has access to  a veritable Aladdin's cave of disguises, a different one for each murder.  Here Mr. Steiger excels himself, it is all pretty nasty really, but done  with such comedic brilliance and relish as to become compulsive viewing.  Lee Remick, looking utterly gorgeous and radiant (and pretty self assured  for a 1967 movie, a little ahead of it's time despite the fact she  ultimately becomes an intended victim) is a witness saught after by George  Segal's detective on the case Mo Brummel. The bi-play between these two  characters is also superb, as they become romantically linked, and as an  extra bonus, Eileen Heckart is hysterical as George's henpecking Jewish  mother. This is Steiger's film though, he is just awesome in every scene,  in disguise or out, especially as the gay wig seller, and in his fixated  post-murder phone calls to Segal's detective, where he tries to create a  relationship of sorts, much to Segal's chagrin!

219707,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300216004,Gregor von Kallahann,"[9, 15]","A very perceptive bio-writer in one of the British film reference books (I forget which) noted that Lee Remick was basically quite badly used by Hollywood and that after such early career successes as ANATOMY OF A MURDER and DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES, she somehow wound up being relegated to ""girlfriend"" roles in mid-60s comedies (e.g. this one and other fluffier fare like THE WHEELER DEALERS) or was cast as the ""wife"" (THE DETECTIVE--well, OK, it's a wife role with a twist--she's a nymphomaniac--BUT it was basically a secondary role nonetheless).It was no wonder that by the 70s, she basically became a TV actress. At least that medium offered her meatier and,yes, starring roles.  For years, she seemed locked in a rivalry with Liz Montgomery for the title of Queen of the TV Movies.  And by that point, that probably wasn't such a bad niche to find yourself in.But in 1967, you could say that Remick was floundering a bit. NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY is one of those 60s films that tries very hard to be sophisticated but never quite pulls it off.  The laughs are pretty paltry in this would-be black comedy.  The Jewish mother jokes are there, the slightly naughty gay jokes are there, the Catholic jokes are there.  They seem pretty dated and, well, almost quaint now.But Rod Steiger DOES get a chance to chew the scenery with the best of them.  He's the real reason to watch this movie, and his role as the homicidal ham-of-a-thousand-faces is one that rightly revels in.  Steiger pulls more accents in this one flick than Meryl has managed in her entire career.  It's over-the-top fun and makes you wish that Hollywood has treated him a little better too.The film could have been better with just a little more edge.  Sharper writing and directing would have made a huge difference.  As a period piece, NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY is well worth watching.  As a vehicle for Steiger, it pretty much works.

Spain,"[1, 22]","Many Americans criticize and protest vehemently against the way women and girls are treated in various cultures outside of the United States, particularly in nations with predominantly Muslim populations. Many of us vent considerable outrage to call attention to the religiously sanctioned suppression of women's rights, the murder, the public floggings and beatings, the stoning, burning and disfigurement of women and girls in places as diverse and different from each other as India, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Iran, and elsewhere.And yet, here, in the land of the free, in the allegedly most democratic and religiously enlightened nation in the world, our movie industry routinely conjures up and drags out of the pit a big-budgeted, all-star cast ""snuff"" film such as ""No Way to Treat A Lady"". If there ever could be a cinematic reference point to what constitutes pornographic content in filmed, fictional violence, then this film would be the superior example. It presents the disgustingly irrational aberration of misogyny - the male hatred of women -- as it metastasizes in the hopelessly diseased mind of a repugnant, mentally ill character, escalating in intensity until it manifests itself as a full-blown, stark, raving, and uncontrollable homicidal rage to destroy individual members of the female species. To kill them. Murder them. To end their lives by asphyxiating them. To crush their windpipes. And all this only three years after the Boston Strangler. Great timing.These murders are filmed with a feverish, ferocious attentiveness to mood, setting, and editing. The director deliberately prolongs the suspense leading up to each of the stranglings by giving Rod Steiger enough time to work himself up to bellowing like Godzilla before he chokes the breath out of the women with his bare hands.Why is this considered entertainment??? I had a mother, and still have sisters that I love, respect, and would protect and defend until I died doing it, you understand?. I don't see anything funny, or interesting, or entertaining, or diverting, or profound, or clever, or ingenious about watching any fictional character/s direct so much festering, gleefully violent hatred towards females. I don't care how talented the performers are. This is culturally sanctioned violent pornography designed to remind women everywhere that the bogeyman's after you and is gonna get you no matter what. So, run, girl, run! Scream a little, too. That makes bogeyman get sooo excited. Oh, and by the way, don't forget to trip and fall, so it'll be easy for the bogeyman to GET YOU. Don't fight back, either. That makes the bogeyman MAD enough to go after your daughter, usually while she's standing naked in the shower.It would be easy to regard and describe films like this as ""sick"", but I won't take that bait, because to be ""sick"" implies that you can get better, if you can get the help you need to treat what ails you. Well, Hollywood ain't getting any better. From Alfred Hitchcock's film of Robert Bloch's novel ""Psycho"", to Joseph Ruben's ""The Stepfather"", to Jonathan Demme's recreation of Thomas Harris' ""The Silence of the Lambs"", the male ""id"" of the American film industry has strutted, preened and pranced around rubbing our faces in some seriously depraved images of women and girls enduring the worst sadism, the most humiliating suffering, both psychic and physical, that male egos could imagine. Newspapers on a daily basis are full of stories about men (who probably ""get-off"" on this kind of ""entertainment"") going out into the real world and acting out their misogynistic nightmares on women in the invaded privacy of their homes, girls' school dormitories and, as recently as yesterday, women's fitness clubs.All I can say is, you better check yourselves, all you men, fathers, brothers, husbands and lovers. You better be ultra-watchful of your reactions and your thoughts while you watch these cinematic instruction manuals on how to bring out your dark side and unleash it on women only.",1,"An obscenely misogynistic film disguised as ""entertainment""",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,4008,"['Many', 'Americans', 'criticize', 'protest', 'vehemently', 'way', 'women', 'girls', 'are', 'treated', 'various', 'cultures', 'United', 'States', 'particularly', 'nations', 'predominantly', 'Muslim', 'populations', 'Many', 'vent', 'considerable', 'outrage', 'call', 'attention', 'religiously', 'sanctioned', 'suppression', 'women', 'rights', 'murder', 'public', 'floggings', 'beatings', 'stoning', 'burning', 'disfigurement', 'women', 'girls', 'places', 'diverse', 'different', 'other', 'India', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Somalia', 'Iran', 'elsewhere.And', 'yet', 'here', 'land', 'free', 'allegedly', 'most', 'democratic', 'religiously', 'enlightened', 'nation', 'world', 'movie', 'industry', 'routinely', 'up', 'drags', 'pit', 'big-budgeted', 'all-star', 'cast', 'snuff', 'film', 'such', 'Way', 'Treat', 'Lady', 'ever', 'could', 'be', 'cinematic', 'reference', 'point', 'what', 'pornographic', 'content', 'filmed', 'fictional', 'violence', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'superior', 'example', 'disgustingly', 'irrational', 'aberration', 'misogyny', 'male', 'hatred', 'women', 'hopelessly', 'diseased', 'mind', 'repugnant', 'mentally', 'ill', 'character', 'escalating', 'intensity', 'full-blown', 'stark', 'raving', 'uncontrollable', 'homicidal', 'rage', 'destroy', 'individual', 'members', 'female', 'species', 'kill', 'Murder', 'end', 'lives', 'asphyxiating', 'crush', 'windpipes', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'Boston', 'Strangler', 'Great', 'timing.These', 'murders', 'are', 'filmed', 'feverish', 'ferocious', 'attentiveness', 'mood', 'setting', 'editing', 'director', 'deliberately', 'suspense', 'leading', 'up', 'stranglings', 'giving', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'enough', 'time', 'work', 'bellowing', 'Godzilla', 'breath', 'women', 'bare', 'hands.Why', 'considered', 'entertainment', 'had', 'mother', 'still', 'have', 'sisters', 'love', 'respect', 'would', 'protect', 'defend', 'died', 'doing', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'funny', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'diverting', 'profound', 'clever', 'ingenious', 'watching', 'fictional', 'character/s', 'direct', 'so', 'much', 'festering', 'gleefully', 'violent', 'hatred', 'towards', 'females', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'talented', 'performers', 'are', 'culturally', 'sanctioned', 'violent', 'pornography', 'designed', 'remind', 'women', 'everywhere', 'bogeyman', 'gon', 'get', 'matter', 'what', 'So', 'run', 'girl', 'run', 'Scream', 'little', 'too', 'bogeyman', 'get', 'sooo', 'excited', 'Oh', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'trip', 'fall', ""'ll"", 'be', 'easy', 'bogeyman', 'GET', 'YOU', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fight', 'back', 'bogeyman', 'MAD', 'enough', 'go', 'daughter', 'usually', 'standing', 'naked', 'shower.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'regard', 'describe', 'films', 'like', 'sick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'bait', 'be', 'sick', 'implies', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'can', 'get', 'help', 'need', 'treat', 'what', 'Well', 'Hollywood', 'ai', ""n't"", 'getting', 'better', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'Robert', 'Bloch', 'novel', 'Psycho', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'Stepfather', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'recreation', 'Thomas', 'Harris', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'male', 'id', 'American', 'film', 'industry', 'strutted', 'preened', 'pranced', 'rubbing', 'seriously', 'depraved', 'images', 'women', 'girls', 'enduring', 'worst', 'sadism', 'most', 'humiliating', 'suffering', 'psychic', 'physical', 'male', 'egos', 'could', 'imagine', 'Newspapers', 'daily', 'basis', 'are', 'full', 'stories', 'men', 'who', 'probably', 'get-off', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'going', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'acting', 'out', 'misogynistic', 'nightmares', 'women', 'invaded', 'privacy', 'homes', 'girls', 'school', 'dormitories', 'as', 'recently', 'yesterday', 'women', 'fitness', 'clubs.All', 'can', 'say', 'better', 'check', 'yourselves', 'men', 'fathers', 'brothers', 'husbands', 'lovers', 'better', 'be', 'ultra-watchful', 'reactions', 'thoughts', 'watch', 'cinematic', 'instruction', 'manuals', 'how', 'bring', 'out', 'dark', 'side', 'unleash', 'women', 'only']",N/A

219719,AK8LX5E8O3AT5,6300216004,Timothy Ramzyk,"[0, 2]","Rod Steiger plays a temperamental mama's boy, who, in various personaes goes about strangling middle-aged NY ladies. Were never sure what exactly his motivations are but they have something to do with living in the shadow of his red-lipped mother, who was a theatrical giant of the NY stage. Fledgling detective (George Segal) is assigned the case, and establishes a cat-and-mouse relationship to Steiger, through a series of phone-calls.NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY may deserve some credit for establishing what have become some very well-worn cliches of the serial-killer genre but that doesn't make it a particularly good film. Steiger madly overacts, and neither the weak script or his overblown performance ever lend any dimension to his character. I've read that he was initially offered the part of the detective but turned it down in favor of the killer which he believed ""would steal the show."" Steal it he does, but is almost outdone by Eileen Heckart's grating performance as Segal's nagging Jewish mother - which comes off too broad for a Mel Brooks film, let alone a black comic thriller.Overall the film is too tame to be frightening, with humor not clever enough to be witty, and action too indifferently directed to be stylish. Maybe at some point the filmmakers realized that a neurotic Rod Steiger strangling middle-aged women wasn't all that entertaining and didn't know where to go?Where you might want to go is THEATER OF BLOOD which successfully uses the same premise but is actually both funny and frightening, or to WHEN A STRANGER CALLS for an urban thriller with more grit and suspense.",2,No way to make a thriller,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,1606,"['Rod', 'Steiger', 'temperamental', 'mama', 'boy', 'who', 'various', 'personaes', 'strangling', 'middle-aged', 'NY', 'ladies', 'Were', 'never', 'sure', 'what', 'exactly', 'motivations', 'are', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'living', 'shadow', 'red-lipped', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'theatrical', 'giant', 'NY', 'stage', 'Fledgling', 'detective', 'George', 'Segal', 'assigned', 'case', 'cat-and-mouse', 'relationship', 'Steiger', 'series', 'phone-calls.NO', 'WAY', 'TO', 'TREAT', 'A', 'LADY', 'may', 'deserve', 'credit', 'establishing', 'what', 'have', 'become', 'very', 'well-worn', 'cliches', 'serial-killer', 'genre', ""n't"", 'make', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'Steiger', 'madly', 'weak', 'script', 'overblown', 'performance', 'ever', 'lend', 'dimension', 'character', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'initially', 'offered', 'part', 'detective', 'turned', 'down', 'favor', 'killer', 'believed', 'would', 'steal', 'show', 'almost', 'outdone', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'grating', 'performance', 'Segal', 'nagging', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'off', 'too', 'broad', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'black', 'comic', 'thriller.Overall', 'film', 'too', 'tame', 'be', 'frightening', 'humor', 'not', 'clever', 'enough', 'be', 'witty', 'action', 'too', 'indifferently', 'directed', 'be', 'stylish', 'Maybe', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'realized', 'neurotic', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'strangling', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'Where', 'might', 'want', 'go', 'THEATER', 'OF', 'BLOOD', 'successfully', 'same', 'premise', 'actually', 'funny', 'frightening', 'WHEN', 'A', 'STRANGER', 'CALLS', 'urban', 'thriller', 'more', 'grit', 'suspense']",N/A
