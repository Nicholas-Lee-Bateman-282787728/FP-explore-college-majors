It was heartbreaking to see them act out what the Walshes went through. I truly admire the Walshes for triumphing over their horrible tragedy. Wow, John Walsh had a son who looked a lot like Adam if you notice in the portrait of the real Walsh family at the end. Every child is loved individually though...I am so glad they didn't just give up on their marriage...on life...etc. They have touched many lives. I SO appreciate what they have done.

Before Adam, child abductions were almost unheard of, and unfortunately today it seems to be the norm.  The acting and writing of this movie is superb, and to watch this without tears is almost impossible.  To have endured such a tragedy as the Walsh family did, and to not only survive but to dedicate your life to fighting for the rights of all children is beyond remarkable.

And the little boy Adam in the movie-he seems to so sweet.And when he came up missing-I was very,very sure that this worried that couple very much! The real sad part of this movie was when they found out what happened to him--(I don't want to even speak about the details)- the poor father just went into a fit-and with the poor wife standing there helplessly bursting into tears! You know-we are living in a time where children are no longer safe! There are a lot of evil monsters out there just ready to harm these innocent children because they don't know any better! Parents-please love your children-talk to them about what is going on,and what to expect.I was very,very happy to find that the movie was on DVD! Though the case was a little damaged,the DVD is the most important to me.I want to be able to see the movie.Thank you so much for having this movie on DVD,and sending it on time.

At the time I deemed it unwatchable, not for the subject matter which is painful to watch, but because it was recorded as SLP speed, which meant crappy picture/audio.  So there it sat, until I finally gave it away.  Now...Hen's Tooth Video, obviously a small, independent company, has issued it on DVD.  The picture is decent as well as the sound.  I also glad to report that it is closed=captioned, so my hearing impaired 86-year-old mother can watch it.  Daniel J. Travanti was nominated for an Emmy for his performance as John Walsh, Adam's father.  His heroic efforts got Congress to enact the Federal Missing Children's Act, and of course he went on to host the long-running TV series, ""America's Most Wanted."" He definitely turned a negative into a positive, albeit at a tragic cost.  JoBeth Williams, the mom in the ""Poltergeist"" movies, also turns in a moving, heartbreaking performance as the mother of missing Adam.
