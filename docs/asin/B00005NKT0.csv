Yeah, the plot is contrived. The acting, when it isn't over the top is almost painfully stilted and forced but it is just great fun. However, on the up side, Gail O'Grady spends half the movie in a tight fitting swim suit.Don't expect a masterpiece. This movie is straight off the Lifetime Movie Channel so, of course, the schmuck husband (Midkiff) is a no damn good cheating liar. This guy has almost no redeeming qualities at all. And his stupidly transparent efforts to juggle a clingy wife (O'Grady) and his new girlfriend (Rinna) are so inept you just can't help but get sucked in.This movie is good fun to watch, especially on a rainy weekend when you have an hour or two to kill.",3,You can't help but watch,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,818,"['Guilty', 'guilty', 'guiltiest', 'pleasures', 'have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'proud', 'love', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'plot', 'contrived', 'acting', 'when', ""n't"", 'top', 'almost', 'painfully', 'stilted', 'forced', 'just', 'great', 'fun', 'However', 'up', 'side', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'movie', 'tight', 'fitting', 'swim', 'suit.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'movie', 'straight', 'off', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'so', 'course', 'schmuck', 'husband', 'Midkiff', 'no', 'damn', 'good', 'cheating', 'liar', 'guy', 'almost', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'stupidly', 'transparent', 'efforts', 'juggle', 'clingy', 'wife', ""O'Grady"", 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Rinna', 'are', 'so', 'inept', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'sucked', 'in.This', 'movie', 'good', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'rainy', 'weekend', 'when', 'have', 'hour', 'two', 'kill']",Another Woman's Husband

669286,A1LF4NXBKM5W01,B00005NKT0,marsdaman,"[1, 1]","Once again, Lifetime proves that their movie collection is much better than Showtime's--which you pay handsomely for. Exs Include: This movie, Going Broke or [for] Broke(starring Delta Burke), Wicked Minds(Angie Everheart), The Craiglist Killer, Everything She Ever Wanted(Gina Gershon ),Unthinkable, The one where a manipulative man controls his sister-in-law and daughter for his own selfish purposes(getting the daughter to kill his wife and raping and later marrying his former sister-in-law), the one where Jennie Garth had AIDs, the one where the Big Bang Theory's  Cuomo--the tastefully sexy jockette--is playing a fat girl for a classroom project and for her own issues she has with her family, etc. There are so many. Often times, they allow you to look and see what not to do or wonder how in the world people can mess their lives up that way. There are also twisted and thrilling movies. There are true movies. Also, the type of movie is many times better than Showtime plus all of them are watchable with your 13 year old. You don't have the movies distributed by the big time production companies--which do not offer Denzel; Gibson; Russell; Van Damme, Snipes, Superhero; horror; etc., but you get family movies in return and don't have to worry as much about blocking them.A man--in which life comes too easy for and in which life is really good for--gets bored with what he has. His wife(Gail O'Grady) is really beautiful and--in modern times--is the equivalent of June Cleaver all wrapped into one. On top of all this, she works as a swimming instructor, so she has sexual prowess, too. All the mental and emotional qualities that make her a good wife make her boring to some. Roxy, her mother--who has always felt entitled as a mother due to simply giving birth--makes her shell house size. That's her only unfixable problem in a woman a good man wants as a wife and it rubs him the wrong way. So, he opts for the woman that is every thing that she's not. Looking at the other woman--shrink by trade--she would make someone a good wife, but she's not as good of a woman as his wife. He lies to this woman about his name(an important detail later on) and some other details, too. It's not clear at first to her, though, and she accepts his Bahaman trip offer. If it was not for the facts that her little brother drowned when she was just a little girl; she's been scared of swimming ever since; and she wants to swim for her trip, she would never have met her beau 's wife. Opposites attract and they become really good friends, while one relationship crumbles and the other sizzles. The irony is that it's the same man. The other woman doesn't even know that he's married, bc he lied to her what his name is. If she knew that his name was Johnny, she would have known. By this point and via his own choice, he's virtually separated from his wife and something causes him to do a 180(my guess is that he had to fess up to some of those lies that he's told and figured that she wasn't going to have him). Anyway, his uxorious doormat is waiting to catch him and they make up. They're back together when the 3 are together at church and the other woman leaves, knowing finally who he really is! He finally knows the tandem's friendship. The wife doesn't know yet about their relationship, though. A chance encounter when she finds a picture of them together changes everything; now, she knows who the other woman is. Her life crashes around her. Unbeknownst to her--her new friend offered her some great probono shrink work in her life, bc she is stronger now than ever before. Therefore, they were helping each other. She stands up to Johnny and her neglecting mother, Roxy. She's free and that's not the end, but it's good for this kind of movie! 5 Stars Out of 5.",5,Nothing Magically Happens N This Movie; Everything Has A Reason 4 Happen'n & It is Artfully Done!,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,3780,"['Once', 'again', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'collection', 'much', 'better', 'Showtime', 'pay', 'handsomely', 'Exs', 'Include', 'movie', 'Going', 'Broke', '[', ']', 'Broke', 'starring', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Wicked', 'Minds', 'Angie', 'Everheart', 'Craiglist', 'Killer', 'Everything', 'Ever', 'Wanted', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'Unthinkable', 'one', 'where', 'manipulative', 'man', 'sister-in-law', 'daughter', 'own', 'selfish', 'purposes', 'getting', 'daughter', 'kill', 'wife', 'raping', 'later', 'marrying', 'former', 'sister-in-law', 'one', 'where', 'Jennie', 'Garth', 'had', 'AIDs', 'one', 'where', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'Cuomo', 'tastefully', 'sexy', 'jockette', 'playing', 'fat', 'girl', 'classroom', 'project', 'own', 'issues', 'family', 'etc', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'Often', 'times', 'allow', 'look', 'see', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'wonder', 'how', 'world', 'people', 'can', 'mess', 'lives', 'up', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'twisted', 'thrilling', 'movies', 'are', 'true', 'movies', 'Also', 'type', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'better', 'Showtime', 'are', 'watchable', '13', 'year', 'old', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movies', 'distributed', 'big', 'time', 'production', 'companies', 'do', 'not', 'offer', 'Denzel', 'Gibson', 'Russell', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Snipes', 'Superhero', 'horror', 'get', 'family', 'movies', 'return', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'as', 'much', 'blocking', 'them.A', 'man', 'life', 'too', 'easy', 'life', 'really', 'good', 'bored', 'what', 'wife', 'Gail', ""O'Grady"", 'really', 'beautiful', 'modern', 'times', 'equivalent', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'wrapped', 'one', 'top', 'swimming', 'instructor', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'too', 'mental', 'emotional', 'qualities', 'make', 'good', 'wife', 'make', 'boring', 'Roxy', 'mother', 'who', 'always', 'felt', 'entitled', 'mother', 'due', 'simply', 'giving', 'birth', 'shell', 'house', 'size', 'only', 'unfixable', 'problem', 'woman', 'good', 'man', 'wife', 'wrong', 'way', 'So', 'woman', 'thing', 'not', 'Looking', 'other', 'woman', 'shrink', 'trade', 'would', 'make', 'someone', 'good', 'wife', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'woman', 'wife', 'woman', 'name', 'important', 'detail', 'later', 'other', 'details', 'too', 'not', 'clear', 'first', 'Bahaman', 'trip', 'offer', 'was', 'not', 'facts', 'little', 'brother', 'drowned', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'girl', 'been', 'scared', 'swimming', 'ever', 'swim', 'trip', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'met', 'beau', 'wife', 'attract', 'become', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'one', 'relationship', 'crumbles', 'other', 'sizzles', 'irony', 'same', 'man', 'other', 'woman', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'married', 'bc', 'lied', 'what', 'name', 'knew', 'name', 'was', 'Johnny', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'point', 'own', 'choice', 'virtually', 'separated', 'wife', 'something', 'do', '180', 'guess', 'had', 'fess', 'up', 'lies', 'told', 'figured', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'have', 'Anyway', 'uxorious', 'doormat', 'waiting', 'catch', 'make', 'up', ""'re"", 'back', 'together', 'when', '3', 'are', 'together', 'church', 'other', 'woman', 'knowing', 'finally', 'who', 'really', 'finally', 'tandem', 'friendship', 'wife', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'relationship', 'though', 'chance', 'encounter', 'when', 'picture', 'together', 'changes', 'everything', 'now', 'who', 'other', 'woman', 'life', 'crashes', 'Unbeknownst', 'new', 'friend', 'offered', 'great', 'probono', 'shrink', 'work', 'life', 'bc', 'stronger', 'now', 'ever', 'Therefore', 'were', 'helping', 'other', 'up', 'Johnny', 'neglecting', 'mother', 'Roxy', 'free', 'not', 'end', 'good', 'kind', 'movie', '5', 'Out', '5']",Another Woman's Husband
