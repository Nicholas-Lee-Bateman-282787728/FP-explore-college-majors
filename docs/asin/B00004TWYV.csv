I thought I'd heard my home theater system really jam, but this DVD made me feel like I was experiencing 5.1 for the first time again.  Love Annie's live version of &quot;Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves&quot;, but it's all fantastic.  Good special features, too.",5,Sweet Dreams are made of THIS!,1013212800,"02 9, 2002",2002,376,"['one', 'best', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'Not', 'only', 'music', 'great', 'DVD', 'quality', 'amazing', 'thought', ""'d"", 'heard', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'really', 'jam', 'DVD', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'experiencing', '5.1', 'first', 'time', 'again', 'Love', 'Annie', 'live', 'version', 'quot', 'Sisters', 'Are', 'Doing', 'Themselves', 'quot', 'fantastic', 'Good', 'special', 'features', 'too']",N/A
551202,A8V74RZY8TIRJ,B00004TWYV,"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[0, 0]","Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart reunite for ""PeaceTour,"" bringing their collective talents once again to their fans in a very enjoyable concert performance.  Annie has never failed to astonish me with her amazing vocal range.  Opening with the hard edge rock beat of their ""Peace"" cd's ""I Want It All,"" the duo moves through both their Eurythmics hits, as well as selections from Annie's solo releases.  Standouts include a rousing medley including- ""I Love You Like A Ball And Chain,"" ""Would I Lie To You?"" and ""Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves"" which showcases vocal talents from three of the back-up female singers.  Dave's skills on guitar are brought solidly to the forefront as he and Annie go into a nice acoustic session, (with a GreenPeace inspired backdrop of pine trees) featuring a lovely take on the duo's ""Here Comes The Rain Again"" and Annie's solo hit ""Why,"" which is followed by an enchanting take on ""The Miracle of Love.""As the concert grows to a close the audience is informed that the proceeds from the ""PeaceTour"" concert will be donated to two environmentally conscience organizations, ""Amnesty"" and ""GreenPeace,""  This is followed with Annie sweetly pleading, ""please think about joining these worthwhile organization to make a difference,"" and then we're swept into a  performance of ""Peace"" (is just a word) and the concert is closed suitably with Eurythmics signature ""Sweet Dreams &lt;are made of this>.""Annie and Dave are outfitted in camouflage Army pants and shirts with bright silver, fur lined jackets and hoods! The entire band and back-up singers are also clad in Army camouflage clothing.  But the poor taste in costuming is forgotten when the music, and most of all, Annie's vocals kick in!  She could stand wearing rags and be dripping with mud, and her voice would still transcend the listener to overlook her attire.  All said, the Eurythmics's ""PeaceTour"" performance is an enjoyable experience and a very welcomed addition to any fan's dvd library!",4,"Annie & Dave Reunite for ""PeaceTour""",1190246400,"09 20, 2007",2007,1991,"['Annie', 'Lennox', 'Dave', 'Stewart', 'reunite', 'PeaceTour', 'bringing', 'collective', 'talents', 'once', 'again', 'fans', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'concert', 'performance', 'Annie', 'never', 'failed', 'astonish', 'amazing', 'vocal', 'range', 'Opening', 'hard', 'edge', 'rock', 'beat', 'Peace', 'cd', 'Want', 'duo', 'Eurythmics', 'hits', 'as', 'well', 'selections', 'Annie', 'solo', 'Standouts', 'include', 'rousing', 'medley', 'including-', 'Love', 'A', 'Ball', 'Chain', 'Would', 'Lie', 'Sisters', 'Are', 'Doing', 'Themselves', 'vocal', 'talents', 'three', 'back-up', 'female', 'singers', 'Dave', 'skills', 'guitar', 'are', 'brought', 'solidly', 'forefront', 'Annie', 'go', 'nice', 'acoustic', 'session', 'GreenPeace', 'inspired', 'backdrop', 'pine', 'trees', 'featuring', 'lovely', 'take', 'duo', 'Here', 'Rain', 'Again', 'Annie', 'solo', 'hit', 'Why', 'followed', 'enchanting', 'take', 'Miracle', 'Love', 'concert', 'close', 'audience', 'informed', 'proceeds', 'PeaceTour', 'concert', 'will', 'be', 'donated', 'two', 'environmentally', 'conscience', 'organizations', 'Amnesty', 'GreenPeace', 'followed', 'Annie', 'sweetly', 'pleading', 'please', 'think', 'joining', 'worthwhile', 'organization', 'make', 'difference', 'then', ""'re"", 'swept', 'performance', 'Peace', 'just', 'word', 'concert', 'closed', 'suitably', 'Eurythmics', 'signature', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'lt', 'are', 'made', '>', 'Annie', 'Dave', 'are', 'outfitted', 'camouflage', 'Army', 'pants', 'shirts', 'bright', 'silver', 'fur', 'lined', 'jackets', 'hoods', 'entire', 'band', 'back-up', 'singers', 'are', 'also', 'clad', 'Army', 'camouflage', 'clothing', 'poor', 'taste', 'costuming', 'forgotten', 'when', 'music', 'most', 'Annie', 'vocals', 'kick', 'could', 'stand', 'wearing', 'rags', 'be', 'dripping', 'mud', 'voice', 'would', 'still', 'transcend', 'listener', 'overlook', 'attire', 'said', 'Eurythmics', 'PeaceTour', 'performance', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'very', 'welcomed', 'addition', 'fan', 'dvd', 'library']",N/A

If you can listen to the stripped down to guitar versions of some of their most popular songs they render here like only they can, and NOT have chills listening to Annie break her heart up into pieces and vocalize it, then you are the one who placed the chill in her heart.Watch Dave look at her as she sings and pick up on when she is going to hold a note out and when she is not while backing her with nothing but a few strums of a guitar!
