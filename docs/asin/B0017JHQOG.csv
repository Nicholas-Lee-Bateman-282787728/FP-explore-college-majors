The premise behind it is great, in fact, one of the most original ideas to come in a while. With that said, the movie lacks that awe and gripping interest you'd think it would have. Jack Black(as Jerry) is the star of the movie, playing the oddball thats sort of just, ""there"".Jerry is never ""fully"" employed at the video store owned by  Mr.Fletcher(Glover) and run by Mike(Mos Def,who by the way is still learning how to act,however a living legend in Hip-Hop), while Jerry's providing the much needed comedic relief in a rather ordinary business(a throwback to Black's character in 'High Fidelity').Jack Black's used to full comedic potential,he does crank out laughs. The holes in the plot,and sometimes dull,uninspired moments is what holds the movie back from holding any 'classic' title. The basis of the movie is almost overshadowed by the other issue of land developers wanting to demolish the video store residence to construct new,ritzy condos(youve seen this situation a million times,why again?),putting the 'fabrication filming' on the back burner. So again,3 stars, it had all the resources for a timeless flick,but fell short due to,maybe bad editing choices,who knows? In the end, the product holds very little weight,if any.

1157083,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0017JHQOG,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I had enormously high hopes for `Be Kind Rewind'; the premise, the actors, the whole concept behind this film just looked like prime comedic entertainment.  Sadly, `Be Kind Rewind' doesn't deliver as solidly as it could, and should have.  It has its moments, and they are great when they actually happen, but I found that the film tried too hard to deliver sentiment and in the end wound up sacrificing the comedy.In other words; there are large segments of this film that are downright boring.The film follows two friends, Mike and Jerry, as they try and recreate popular films with their handheld camera and neighborhood friends.  The reason for this is that Mike was left in charge of a video store, and Jerry, his best friend, accidentally erased all the videos when he got himself magnetized.  In fear of losing business for his boss Elroy, who is already fighting the town to keep his store, Mike and Jerry decide the only way to save the video store is to make fakes (sweded).  The movies are shorter, rougher and completely ridiculous, but they are a major break from the norm and become a local phenomenon.When the cast is amerced in the filmmaking process the film is outright perfection.  Their recreation of `Ghostbusters' is a total laugh riot, and the sporadic clips of remade films like `Boyz N the Hood' and `Rush Hour II' are brilliantly staged and captured.  The concept around each films creation is flawlessly entertaining, and the actors all have so much fun doing it.But sadly, when they are not gallivanting around impersonating your favorite screen characters, the film tends to fall a little flat.  The whole back-story of the famous jazz musician that supposedly was born in the small town (Passaic New Jersey) from which the film spawns is decent but its place within the film should not have taken priority.  It could have been a nice segway into more comedic territory but instead it proves to be the films major plot point, thus taking away from what should have been the major focus.  Thus, the beginning and end of the film are dreadfully detached from the heart of the film, and I found my attention wavering.  The middle of the film is entertaining throughout, but getting there and leaving there is another story altogether.I am not always a fan of Jack Black's humor, but here he works very well.  Mos Def is not nearly as funny (he's a much more serious actor) and I think that the initial casting choice of Cave Chappelle might have worked a little better in keeping the film funny throughout, but I like Mos Def in general and found him to be effective when necessary.  The supporting cast of Danny Glover and Mia Farrow are not used as well as they could have been though, but when they are on screen they do a stand up job.  The films real star is Melonie Diaz who was just incredibly flawless as the duo's leading lady Alma.  She steals every scene she inhabits and proves to be the focus of the audience's attention.The direction of the film is nicely handled, the style behind it making the film itself feel about as homemade as their faux productions.  The dialog and interactions between characters feels very real, not Hollywood at all.  The film moves as if you were to stage a camera in your living room and just record your friends all day long.  This aids in creating the natural comedic feel of the film, I just wish that the material had been tightened a little to allow the comedy to really remain the focal point of the film.`Be Kind Rewind' is not a bad film, but it could have been so much better.  I still recommend checking it out; you may enjoy it far more than I did.  The meat of the film is perfection, but the films potential wasn't fully realized as far as I am concerned.",3,If only the entire movie had been sweded...,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3737,"['had', 'enormously', 'high', 'hopes', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'premise', 'actors', 'whole', 'concept', 'film', 'just', 'looked', 'prime', 'comedic', 'entertainment', 'Sadly', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'as', 'solidly', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'great', 'when', 'actually', 'happen', 'found', 'film', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'deliver', 'sentiment', 'end', 'wound', 'up', 'sacrificing', 'comedy.In', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'large', 'segments', 'film', 'are', 'downright', 'boring.The', 'film', 'two', 'friends', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'try', 'recreate', 'popular', 'films', 'handheld', 'camera', 'neighborhood', 'friends', 'reason', 'Mike', 'was', 'left', 'charge', 'video', 'store', 'Jerry', 'best', 'friend', 'accidentally', 'erased', 'videos', 'when', 'got', 'magnetized', 'fear', 'losing', 'business', 'boss', 'Elroy', 'who', 'already', 'fighting', 'town', 'keep', 'store', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'decide', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'video', 'store', 'make', 'fakes', 'sweded', 'movies', 'are', 'shorter', 'rougher', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'are', 'major', 'break', 'norm', 'become', 'local', 'phenomenon.When', 'cast', 'amerced', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'film', 'outright', 'perfection', 'recreation', 'Ghostbusters', 'total', 'laugh', 'riot', 'sporadic', 'clips', 'remade', 'films', 'Boyz', 'N', 'Hood', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'II', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'staged', 'captured', 'concept', 'films', 'creation', 'flawlessly', 'entertaining', 'actors', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'doing', 'it.But', 'sadly', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'gallivanting', 'impersonating', 'favorite', 'screen', 'characters', 'film', 'fall', 'little', 'flat', 'whole', 'back-story', 'famous', 'jazz', 'musician', 'supposedly', 'was', 'born', 'small', 'town', 'Passaic', 'New', 'Jersey', 'film', 'spawns', 'decent', 'place', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'priority', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'segway', 'more', 'comedic', 'territory', 'instead', 'be', 'films', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'thus', 'taking', 'away', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'focus', 'Thus', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'dreadfully', 'detached', 'heart', 'film', 'found', 'attention', 'wavering', 'middle', 'film', 'entertaining', 'getting', 'there', 'leaving', 'story', 'altogether.I', 'am', 'not', 'always', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Black', 'humor', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'Mos', 'Def', 'not', 'nearly', 'funny', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'actor', 'think', 'initial', 'casting', 'choice', 'Cave', 'Chappelle', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'little', 'better', 'keeping', 'film', 'funny', 'like', 'Mos', 'Def', 'general', 'found', 'be', 'effective', 'when', 'necessary', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'are', 'screen', 'do', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'films', 'real', 'star', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'incredibly', 'flawless', 'duo', 'leading', 'lady', 'Alma', 'scene', 'be', 'focus', 'audience', 'attention.The', 'direction', 'film', 'nicely', 'handled', 'style', 'making', 'film', 'feel', 'as', 'homemade', 'faux', 'productions', 'dialog', 'interactions', 'characters', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'moves', 'were', 'stage', 'camera', 'living', 'room', 'just', 'record', 'friends', 'day', 'long', 'aids', 'creating', 'natural', 'comedic', 'feel', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'material', 'had', 'been', 'tightened', 'little', 'allow', 'comedy', 'really', 'remain', 'focal', 'point', 'film.', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'still', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'may', 'enjoy', 'far', 'more', 'did', 'meat', 'film', 'perfection', 'films', 'potential', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'realized', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned']",N/A

In a way it's a shock considering it contains one of the big comedy stars of the moment, but hey there you are. This is without a doubt one of the more kooky pictures by Black, and let's be honest he's been in some pretty bizarre movies not counting Pick of Destiny. His character, Jerry also seems to be completely insane with a certain level of sanity that is quite endearing in its own way.Be Kind Rewind, although the title of the film is the name of an ancient VHS store, and like the VHS this store is pretty much dead. One problem with the VHS which has plagued it from its birth to its death is that when exposed to magnetism, everything disappears. This is the basis of the story for which the film revolves.The store of Be Kind Rewind is close to a century old and is rumoured to be the birth place of famous Jazz musician Fats Waller. Mike (Mos Def) and his friend Jerry (Black) are left in charge of the store while the current owner Elroy (Danny Glover) goes to do some research into the competition. The store doesn't have long left as Elroy is left an Ultimatum that he needs to bring the building up to safety codes or it will be torn down to make room for a new condo. For whatever reason, Jerry being completely insane and all wants to raid a power station which leads to the electricity raiding Jerry making him magnetic. After that event Jerry returns to the video store and due to his new found magnetism he incidentally erases all the movies on the video. Much to Mikes dismay, Jerry recommends they shoot their own versions of the movie starting with Ghostbusters.This film is as unusual as it sounds and has some really side rippingly hysterical moments. The movie remakes by the duo are something to be experienced and make you wish they would be released as a seperate entity to this film. Jack Black as always has the viewer (myself) roaring with laughter as he makes the illusion of him being a complete nut job entirely believable. Mos Def's character, it has to be said was nothing entirely special and I just found myself becoming annoyed by his presence on screen. The presence of Danny Glover gives this a feel of authenticity as it's a film in which the main stars find themselves recreating classic movies, and although they didn't remake any of the Lethal Weapon movies, it would have been fun if they did simply due to Danny Glover being a part of this picture.Overall it's an hysterical piece which starts off as completely bizarre in every way, but turns into one of the more heart warming and genuine films of the year.

I read the middling reviews of Be Kind Rewind, and I had moderate expectations. The film is slow to start. When it does pick up, it's delightful, witty and surprisingly poignant. By embracing the ridiculous, yet brilliant plot, the film manages to plausibly straddle the line between preposterous and believable.It's refreshing to see Jack Black do comedy and drama; it helps restrain his wackiness into something more endearing. Danny Glover and Mia Farrow were fantastic. In this all-star cast, relative newcomer Melonie Diaz gave the best performance. I plan to make a point to see more of her films soon.This movie delivers many laughs and quite a few tears. It's definitely worth seeing.

1157095,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0017JHQOG,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","Known for his inventive music videos, Michel Gondry made a huge splash with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" which still has Jim Carrey's best performance ever, a great concept and a genuinely affecting love story. His follow-up ""The Science of Sleep"" was also quite out there and was likable but there was a feeling like it was too out there for its own good...plus pacing problems. With another premise built more on fantasy and surrealism than reality, we have ""Be Kind Rewind"" which was met with a rather lukewarm response. Seems like overkill since the film was entertaining from beginning to end. Not a laugh-riot per se but wasn't a give-me-back-my-2-hours awful either.Mike and Jerry work at the ""Be Kind Rewind"" video store, probably one of the last remaining stores that carries VHS in New Jersey. Despite being known as the home of music legend Fats Domino, the store is in danger of shutting down and the owner Mr. Fletcher leaves for awhile leaving the store in the hands of Mike. But Jerry has an accident that leaves him magnetized which causes him to erase the tapes found in the entire store. Not wanting to face the owner, they decide instead to ""swede"" the tapes: shot using very low-budget effects and more than half the length of the originals, they basically redo the films and become a bit of a neighborhood sensation in the process.When I first heard of the film's story and the idea of customers getting hooked, I couldn't tell if the customers were that dim to realize that the movie isn't Ghostbusters or Rush Hour 2 or if they just found it better and more exciting than actually watching them. But upon watching the film I realized that it doesn't really matter since, like all of Gondry's films, reality mixes with imagination very frequently. In essence, this film's more a fairy tale than going for outright plausibility (do people even still own VHS players?). But the film's more for people who just want to watch a movie.The main draw is probably the ""sweded"" versions of movies with effects are quite crude though they're quite charming in how they try to replicate them. It was also nice to see their effects actually improve...for lack of a better word, as their first feature Ghostbusters is quite low-budget but then get more inventive with each film they do (their King Kong for instance). And the actors make it entertaining as they don't just do naughty humor with body parts said everywhere yet passing the film off as a film of heart. That was my one complaint with films done by Judd Apatow as the film's are indeed funny but then they try to add more drama and character moments which felt a bit disconnected from the frequent male body part words characters can say in a minute but here, the actors add a bit more of a charm to it. However, the film is the best when it shows redone scenes from older movies but then it's like they just drop it and their sweded films are more talked about then shown.I think a film like this is one where it'll connect with people just as much as turn off the others. Unlike other films where there's a huge praise for it, this is more of a love it/hate it thing and for awhile, I'm teetering more towards the love it side the more it sinks in.",4,Charming viewing for some,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,3233,"['Known', 'inventive', 'music', 'videos', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'made', 'huge', 'splash', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'still', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'great', 'concept', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'love', 'story', 'follow-up', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'there', 'was', 'likable', 'was', 'feeling', 'was', 'too', 'out', 'there', 'own', 'good', 'pacing', 'problems', 'premise', 'built', 'more', 'fantasy', 'surrealism', 'reality', 'have', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'was', 'met', 'rather', 'lukewarm', 'response', 'overkill', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', 'Not', 'laugh-riot', 'se', 'was', ""n't"", 'give-me-back-my-2-hours', 'awful', 'either.Mike', 'Jerry', 'work', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'video', 'store', 'probably', 'one', 'last', 'remaining', 'stores', 'VHS', 'New', 'Jersey', 'being', 'known', 'home', 'music', 'legend', 'Fats', 'Domino', 'store', 'danger', 'shutting', 'down', 'owner', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'awhile', 'leaving', 'store', 'hands', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'accident', 'magnetized', 'erase', 'tapes', 'found', 'entire', 'store', 'Not', 'wanting', 'face', 'owner', 'decide', 'instead', 'swede', 'tapes', 'shot', 'using', 'very', 'low-budget', 'effects', 'more', 'length', 'originals', 'basically', 'redo', 'films', 'become', 'bit', 'neighborhood', 'sensation', 'process.When', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'story', 'idea', 'customers', 'getting', 'hooked', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'customers', 'were', 'dim', 'realize', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Ghostbusters', 'Rush', 'Hour', '2', 'just', 'found', 'better', 'more', 'exciting', 'actually', 'watching', 'watching', 'film', 'realized', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Gondry', 'films', 'reality', 'mixes', 'imagination', 'very', 'frequently', 'essence', 'film', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'going', 'outright', 'plausibility', 'do', 'people', 'even', 'still', 'own', 'VHS', 'players', 'film', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'movie.The', 'main', 'draw', 'probably', 'sweded', 'versions', 'movies', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'crude', ""'re"", 'quite', 'charming', 'how', 'try', 'replicate', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'effects', 'actually', 'improve', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'first', 'feature', 'Ghostbusters', 'quite', 'low-budget', 'then', 'get', 'more', 'inventive', 'film', 'do', 'King', 'Kong', 'instance', 'actors', 'make', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'do', 'naughty', 'humor', 'body', 'parts', 'said', 'everywhere', 'yet', 'passing', 'film', 'off', 'film', 'heart', 'was', 'one', 'complaint', 'films', 'done', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'film', 'are', 'indeed', 'funny', 'then', 'try', 'add', 'more', 'drama', 'character', 'moments', 'felt', 'bit', 'disconnected', 'frequent', 'male', 'body', 'part', 'words', 'characters', 'can', 'say', 'minute', 'here', 'actors', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'charm', 'However', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'redone', 'scenes', 'older', 'movies', 'then', 'just', 'drop', 'sweded', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'talked', 'then', 'shown.I', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'where', ""'ll"", 'connect', 'people', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'turn', 'others', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'huge', 'praise', 'more', 'love', 'it/hate', 'thing', 'awhile', ""'m"", 'teetering', 'more', 'towards', 'love', 'side', 'more']",N/A

Wynes,"[0, 2]","I rented this on Blu-Ray, which part of me found slightly amusing since the subject matter is about a video rental store still stocking nothing but VHS, struggling with the transition to DVD.  That's just one of many things in this movie that seem so incredibly improbable -- is there a single person in the Western World who cannot afford $30 for a DVD player at Wal-Mart, and must therefore keep renting VHS tapes from their corner store?The plot of this film is ridiculous and it's impossible to suspend disbelief through most of it.  There is this old VHS rental place where Jerry (Jack Black) spends his time hanging out when he isn't hiding in his camper-trailer with tinfoil on his head to protect him from the mind control beams he thinks are being sent out by the local power company.  He gets electrified in a botched attempt to sabotage the power plant -- in a fit of over-the-top slapstick -- and become magnetized.  When he later handles all the VHS cassettes at the store, his magnetism de-gausses the tapes resulting in all of them being blank.  In order to cover for this catastrophe, the shop's temporary manager (""musician"" Mos Def) comes up with the idea to re-create the movies as needed by re-enacting them and shooting this re-enactment on videotape.The premise has some promise, and initially it delivers.  Their attempt to re-create ""Ghostbusters"", with low-budget effects such as the signature proton particle streams concocted from Christmas tree garland and wire, is quite amusing.  Their later attempt to re-create ""Driving Miss Daisy"" also generates a few good laughs.  But the idea that anybody who rented these re-creations would be amused by them is palpably absurd.  Yet that's exactly what happens.  This small independant video store is being nearly run out of business by its rival, a presumably heartless corporate franchise store, and the local shop is about to have its building condemned.  Can the nonsensically popular makeshift video re-enactments generate enough new business to save the shop from this ubiquitous Hollywood cliche?  Who cares.  The laughs stopped coming very quickly after they began, I didn't much care about any of the characters, and the plot depended on characters being simultaneously outrageously stupid and preposterously sentimental.  Like a bad episode of M*A*S*H, it turns on a dime from goofy slapstick to maudlin junk.The picture quality seems to be quite good, there was very little film grain, close-ups were rather decent, and there are some nice sunlit shots outdoors that really showcase the Blu-Ray format's superiority to DVD.

1157100,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0017JHQOG,Danielle Turchiano,"[2, 3]","If you thought the pairing of Jack Black and Mos Def in Michel Gondry's Be Kind Rewind was going to be the equivalent of a cinematic Odd Couple, you wouldn't be completely wrong.  Black is back at his usual silly antics as Jerry, a slightly paranoid oddball who frequents the video rental store at which Mos Def's Mike works.  And Mos Def himself works well as the straight man, a quiet thinker who only wants to get his work done in a way that makes his boss, Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover), proud.  When Fletcher has to leave town for a few days and leaves Mike in charge of the store, he gives him one simple, though slightly illegible rule: Don't let Jerry in the store.  Of course by the time Mike figures out what the note says, it's too late: somehow in yet another one of his harebrained schemes, Jerry manages to get magnetized, and he wipes all of the tapes clean of content just by standing near them and then decides no one will notice if they just reenact the movies and rent out their own versions to the small town folk.  Underneath the chuckles, though, Be Kind Rewind's deeper character moments and strong emphasis on the importance of an artistic drive and entrepreneurship are what sets it apart from being just another slapstick buddy comedy.Gondry is almost tongue-in-cheek with his message in Be Kind Rewind, one he tells through both men but in different ways.  He wants everyone to get out there and tell their stories, regardless of the amount of money or the size of their crew, and he offers an almost feature length ""how to"" through Be Kind Rewind.  Jerry is the carefree dreamer who finds a love of performing so much so that after they finish shooting their first ""remake,"" he stays in costume as Mike hands the tape over to a nosy customer (Mia Farrow).  Conspicuously in her peripheral eyeline, he mouths lines from the movie in an attempt to get noticed.  Black adds just enough desperation to his eyes in that scene that he suddenly stops being just another cartoonish character and becomes a complicated man.  And it is in those moments the film really picks up on their journey.While time seems to stand still in Be Kind Rewind (with the store being reluctant to stock DVDs and Mike clinging to old stories about a childhood hero), the result is never distracting or corny because the simpler things clung to are universally missed.  These are two ""every men"" who did not set out to be heroes or revitalize their community, even though they stumble into doing just that.  It is most satisfying and refreshing then, when Hollywood comes knocking on their door, it is not because they are so impressed with what they are doing; instead Gondry ""keeps it real"" with his plot twist and effortlessly weaves grace and naturalism into his slightly satirical film.The most fun is had by the filmmakers and the audience alike during the sequences in which the amateurs film their own version of Ghostbusters, Rush Hour 2, and even The Lion King.  There is something just innately thrilling about watching grown men (and women-- Melonie Diaz' Alma) run around their hometown with a handheld camera and sneak shots; it makes you want to get up and create something for yourself, too, and each brief snippet just leaves you wanting more... in a good way.Reviewing Be Kind Rewind on DVD is poetic, and maybe even a little ironic, considering it is the medium to which Fletcher was fighting the conversion, and in following that tongue-in-cheek telling, Gondry inserted an additional scene directly into the feature on the disc--a scene that talks directly about Fletcher's failing business because of his failure to adapt with the times and technology.  At about a minute long, many might not remember this wasn't in the theatrical version, but in its short time on screen it offers a bit more empathetic look at Fletcher and his business.The DVD offers both original 2.35:1 widescreen and a compressed full screen version of the film, and all of the menus have the ""homemade"" look that Mike and Jerry made famous on their own films.  It is a promising start to a disc that unfortunately cannot live up to the expectations.  New Line only offers two real extras on this release: one is a ten-minute featurette (""Passaic Mosaic"") that features interviews from the cast as well as locals of the streets on which they filmed.  While this extra is unique in that it actually looks at the real people (or the locals) who were brought in as consultants or background actors on the film, it cannot make up for the fact that the only other piece of bonus footage is the long version of the theatrical trailer.  Considering other extras (like some of Mike and Jerry's versions of classic films) leaked online almost immediately when the theatrical release was being promoted, it can only be assumed New Line is waiting to release a Special Edition, again a bit poetic as Mike and Jerry often had to make their customers wait for ""custom"" videos because they hadn't yet shot that title.",4,Inspired By (Or

1157104,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0017JHQOG,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[35, 38]","VHS is pretty much dead now, but it has one characteristic that ""Be Kind Rewind"" revolves around: expose it to magnetism, and it dies.So you can probably guess what happens in Michel Gondry's fourth movie, and his first foray into all-out comedy. It has some plot holes and a rather bizarre premise, but there's a warm, funny little heart buried in the kooky antics and wild remakes of every movie from ""Ghostbusters"" to ""Lord of the Rings.""Be Kind Rewind is an ancient video store, and supposedly the birthplace of unknown jazz legend Fats Waller. It's also due to be razed for a new block of condos -- so store owner Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) goes on a scouting trip for a week, leaving his conscientious clerk Mike (Mos Def) in charge.Unfortunately local weirdo Jerry (Jack Black) tries to destroy a local power plant, because he believes it's controlling his brain. Instead he gets fried, and his body becomes a walking electromagnet -- which they only discover after he's wandered through the store, erasing all the old tapes. Even worse, a regular customer (Mia Farrow) wants ""Ghostbusters"" by that evening.So Mike and Jerry hurriedly shoot their OWN version of the movie, with the help of Alma (Melonie Diaz) and soon they find that their ""Sweded"" movies have a growing fanbase, and they are statewide celebrities. But the demolition deadline is approaching, and Hollywood lawyers are threatening them for copyright infringement -- will the town's new devotion to these quirky ""Sweding"" moviemakers help them stay?Michel Gondry's movies are always set in ""real life,"" but with a few drops of the unreal -- memory erasure, waking surrealist dreams, that kind of thing. And even though ""Be Kind Rewind"" is set in a grimy, shabby New Jersey town, it has the same delightfully unreal quality -- it's a genial buddy comedy where literally anything can happen.I'll admit, there are some moments that don't entirely work. Note the awkward ""this town is a swamp"" exchange, and we're expected to allow the plot holes to slide (where did the infringement lawyers go?). And that whole magnetized body fluids thing was just gross.But despite its flaws, it's somehow a very lovable movie. It's crammed with physical and verbal comedy (""Iloveyou Iloveyou we'relovers kissme!""), ranging from amateur train hijacks to an inept break-in at a DVD rental store. And a merely entertaining movie becomes sidesplitting when our heroes start shooting a ghastly no-budget ""Ghostbusters"" with fishing rods, tinsel, and bags of goo. This is followed by ""Robocop,"" ""2001,"" ""Rush Hour 2,"" ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and several others -- all with no budget, borrowed costumes, cardboard sets, and a cast of rank amateurs.Gondry is obviously having a roaring good time lampooning Hollywood blockbusters. But he also injects some deeper currents into what could have been a one-joke movie -- there's a bittersweet subplot about the possibility of losing the store that has brought a community together. Yeah, it's supposed to tug at the heartstrings, but it really does work -- particularly since the movie rental industry is going belly-up.One particularly nice touch is that the movie ends -- and is punctuated by -- scenes of a very low-budget, old-looking biopic of Fats Waller. Initially it just seems like another conceit, but it turns out to be very important to the plot.Black is a delight as the insane Jerry, brimming with manic energy -- in one scene, he encases himself in aluminum foil. Mos Def's Mike is more pleasant and low-key as the responsible boy-next-door type, and Danny Glover is outstanding as the paternal, gravel-voiced Mr. Fletcher. Diaz is also quite solid as a vague love interest/codirector/costar; and keep an eye out for Sigourney Weaver in a small cameo.Michel Gondry's fourth full-length film is a big-hearted, mildly bittersweet little comedy, with the slightly unreal quality you expect from his films.

1157113,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0017JHQOG,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[3, 3]","When Elroy Fletcher(Danny Glover), owner of Be Kind Rewind video rental store, goes out of town he leaves Mike (Mos Def) in charge with one rule: Keep Jerry (Jack Black) Out! But when Jerry becomes magnetized trying to sabotage the local electric plant he makes his way into the video store and erases all the video tapes in the store. Finding that none of the local video stores carry video tapes having switched to the more popular DVD, and with customers threatening to call Elroy, Mike and Jerry take matters into their own hands and start recording their own versions of popular movies. Claiming that the versions are imported versions of films from Sweden, their ""Sweded"" films become popular amongst the citizens of Passaic, New Jersey.French director Michel Gondry is a very unique director, taking a look at his 2004 masterpiece Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and you can see that this isn't your average director. Having amassed a body of work that doesn't just stop at film (he played the drums on Kanye West's Diamonds From Sierra Leone) Michel Gondry has become something of an underground sensation. He created effects that would eventually be used in high profile films such as The Matrix, and was the first to use morphing technics in a video clip. Put him together with rap phenom, as well as Emmy and Golden Globe nominated actor Mos Def and rock star/ comedian Jack Black and what do you get?...A great and heartfelt movie that's a love letter to film, an ode to the classic DIY spirit, and a reminder of the importance of history and the ability to change it and make it our own. Written by Michel Gondry based on an idea he got from directing Dave Chappelle's Bloc Party, Be Kind Rewind is a movie that mixes heart with comedy in a fashion that never seems schmaltzy and is very original. And the atmosphere of the movie is infectious, as the duo begin inviting others to help in making the ""Sweded"" videos you feel drawn in as if you're part of the process. This movie has also sparked something of a revolution, look up Sweded on Youtube and you can find other people Sweded versions of movie and movie trailers.With actors like Danny Glover and Jack Black you expect a mixture of good acting and well played out comedy in this movie, and in casting Mos Def and Jack Black the casting directors definitely made the right choice. Jack Black is of course Jack Black, which doesn't always work in every role he plays, but here he understates slightly, dialing down his tendencies to overact on occasion. Mos Def, as always, proves masterful playing the straight man to Jack Black's crazy, perfectly filling out the bromance. Of course, you can never count out Danny Glover who is the most tortured soul in the movie as a man set in his ways realizing that he has to change with the times if he wants to keep his business, and he greatly excels at making you feel and understand the emotions of the character.If the movie fails in one thing, it's at the very beginning. The set up for the grand scheme of the plot is not very well thought out, and a little awkwardly executed. While on paper the idea of Jack Black's character becoming magnetized and demagnetizing every movie in a video store looks great on paper (and does make for a few hilariously great slapstick moments), the execution of him becoming magnetized is even a little too quirky for this quirky comedy and throws off the pacing for a few moments near the early parts of the movie. Gondry quickly gets back on track though, but at the same time the movie feels a little cramped with everything he's trying to throw at you. The movie is filled with a lot of great ideas, and at times it can feel a little cramped with everything that's been put in there.All in all, I would highly recommend the movie, and this is definitely a movie that takes more than one viewing to fully appreciate it. At a time when everything being cranked out of Hollywood is either a remake, adaptation, or a sequel this ode to originality is definitely a breath of fresh air.4/5",4,Be Kind Rewind,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,4047,"['When', 'Elroy', 'Fletcher', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'owner', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'town', 'Mike', 'Mos', 'Def', 'charge', 'one', 'rule', 'Keep', 'Jerry', 'Jack', 'Black', 'when', 'Jerry', 'magnetized', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'local', 'electric', 'plant', 'way', 'video', 'store', 'video', 'tapes', 'store', 'Finding', 'none', 'local', 'video', 'stores', 'carry', 'video', 'tapes', 'having', 'switched', 'more', 'popular', 'DVD', 'customers', 'threatening', 'call', 'Elroy', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'start', 'recording', 'own', 'versions', 'popular', 'movies', 'Claiming', 'versions', 'are', 'imported', 'versions', 'films', 'Sweden', 'Sweded', 'films', 'become', 'popular', 'citizens', 'Passaic', 'New', 'Jersey.French', 'director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'very', 'unique', 'director', 'taking', 'look', '2004', 'masterpiece', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'can', 'see', ""n't"", 'average', 'director', 'Having', 'amassed', 'body', 'work', ""n't"", 'just', 'stop', 'film', 'played', 'drums', 'Kanye', 'West', 'Diamonds', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'become', 'something', 'underground', 'sensation', 'created', 'effects', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'used', 'high', 'profile', 'films', 'such', 'Matrix', 'was', 'first', 'use', 'morphing', 'technics', 'video', 'clip', 'Put', 'together', 'rap', 'phenom', 'as', 'well', 'Emmy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominated', 'actor', 'Mos', 'Def', 'rock', 'star/', 'comedian', 'Jack', 'Black', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'great', 'heartfelt', 'movie', 'love', 'letter', 'film', 'ode', 'classic', 'DIY', 'spirit', 'reminder', 'importance', 'history', 'ability', 'change', 'make', 'own', 'Written', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'based', 'idea', 'got', 'directing', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'Bloc', 'Party', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'movie', 'heart', 'comedy', 'fashion', 'never', 'schmaltzy', 'very', 'original', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'infectious', 'duo', 'begin', 'inviting', 'others', 'help', 'making', 'Sweded', 'videos', 'feel', 'drawn', ""'re"", 'part', 'process', 'movie', 'also', 'sparked', 'something', 'revolution', 'look', 'up', 'Sweded', 'Youtube', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'people', 'Sweded', 'versions', 'movie', 'movie', 'trailers.With', 'actors', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Jack', 'Black', 'expect', 'mixture', 'good', 'acting', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'comedy', 'movie', 'casting', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Jack', 'Black', 'casting', 'directors', 'definitely', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'Jack', 'Black', 'course', 'Jack', 'Black', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'role', 'here', 'slightly', 'dialing', 'down', 'tendencies', 'overact', 'occasion', 'Mos', 'Def', 'always', 'masterful', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'Jack', 'Black', 'crazy', 'perfectly', 'filling', 'out', 'bromance', 'course', 'can', 'never', 'count', 'out', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'most', 'tortured', 'soul', 'movie', 'man', 'set', 'ways', 'realizing', 'change', 'times', 'keep', 'business', 'greatly', 'making', 'feel', 'understand', 'emotions', 'character.If', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'beginning', 'set', 'up', 'grand', 'scheme', 'plot', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'little', 'awkwardly', 'executed', 'paper', 'idea', 'Jack', 'Black', 'character', 'becoming', 'magnetized', 'demagnetizing', 'movie', 'video', 'store', 'great', 'paper', 'make', 'few', 'hilariously', 'great', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'execution', 'becoming', 'magnetized', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'quirky', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'off', 'pacing', 'few', 'moments', 'early', 'parts', 'movie', 'Gondry', 'quickly', 'back', 'track', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'little', 'cramped', 'everything', 'trying', 'throw', 'movie', 'filled', 'lot', 'great', 'ideas', 'times', 'can', 'feel', 'little', 'cramped', 'everything', 'been', 'put', 'there.All', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'definitely', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'time', 'when', 'everything', 'being', 'cranked', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'adaptation', 'sequel', 'ode', 'originality', 'definitely', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.4/5']",N/A

It struggles at time to have heart, zaniness, independence and marketability.The plot revolves around a near-defunct video rental place where Jack Black accidentally erases all the VHS tapes.  He and his partner, Mos Def, get it into their heads to start filming their own stripped down versions of whatever movies their customers come in to rent, and hilarity ensues.  Almost.  While the ""Sweded"" movies, as they come to be called, did make me laugh quite a bit, there are far too many things going on in this movie for it to ever really pull together into a nice whole.  Oddly enough, a lot of the glaring flaws of Jack Black and Mos Def's camcorder remakes of the classics occur in the actual movie as well.  Scenes that end abruptly, storylines that go nowhere and choppy pacing plague this film.  For example, the details of how Jack Black erases all the videos is just too slap-sticky and out of place for the rest of the movie, not to mention it gobbles up an inordinate amount of the storyline for no real good reason.The one thing that never falters is the acting with Jack Black (who isn't my favorite) turning in an enjoyable lead along with Mos Def, Danny Glover, and a host of other famous faces.In the end I did smile much more than groan and would have to say I enjoyed myself, I just wish they had focused on the core premise more and trimmed some of the fat.",3,Choppy but with heart,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,1437,"['movie', 'be', 'little', 'torn', 'what', 'be', 'time', 'have', 'heart', 'zaniness', 'independence', 'marketability.The', 'plot', 'around', 'near-defunct', 'video', 'rental', 'place', 'where', 'Jack', 'Black', 'accidentally', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'partner', 'Mos', 'Def', 'get', 'heads', 'start', 'filming', 'own', 'stripped', 'versions', 'movies', 'customers', 'come', 'rent', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'Almost', 'Sweded', 'movies', 'come', 'be', 'called', 'did', 'make', 'quite', 'bit', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'movie', 'ever', 'really', 'pull', 'together', 'nice', 'whole', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'lot', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Mos', 'Def', 'camcorder', 'remakes', 'classics', 'occur', 'actual', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Scenes', 'end', 'abruptly', 'storylines', 'go', 'nowhere', 'choppy', 'pacing', 'plague', 'film', 'example', 'details', 'how', 'Jack', 'Black', 'videos', 'just', 'too', 'slap-sticky', 'place', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'up', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'storyline', 'real', 'good', 'reason.The', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'acting', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'turning', 'enjoyable', 'lead', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'host', 'other', 'famous', 'end', 'did', 'smile', 'much', 'more', 'groan', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'focused', 'core', 'premise', 'more', 'trimmed', 'fat']",N/A

To think that someone would come up with a movie about movies is just hilarious.  Jack Black with Mos Def as his straight man is a brilliant combination.The movie is a little slow at the beginning as each one is getting into character and you are getting the lay of the land with the video store named ""Be Kind Rewind,"" which is way behind the times.  You see there are all VHS and absolutely no DVDs.  The owner (Danny Glover) goes on a trip leaving Mike (Def) in charge of the store, being told to keep Jerry (Black) out of the store, but he really does not 'get' what he is being told since it is a note written in reverse.  This takes on a few minutes of the flick, and is really funny.Jerry gets a shock of his life, make sure to watch this scene closely when they are both near the fence, and he becomes electrified, causing the tapes to erase.  This is where the movie takes off and where we scene the ingenuity of the plot to take off.  Sweded is a term they use in the movie that is what they do to make their own version.  Like they are making fun of movies like Blair Witch where the viewers really love the new kind of flick.There is a lot of scenes around Pasaic NJ, although a farce, it is a movie about community and pokes fun of the big movie makers who take things like this way too seriously.  Glover does an admirable job as a supporting actor as does Mia Farrow.  There are some new faces as well and Jack Black is very funny although somewhat silly at times.

1157126,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0017JHQOG,"Maine Writer ""David""","[7, 19]","When I first heard the premise of Be Kind, Rewind, I was skeptical. After all, in what universe could you get people to rent VHS tapes? But, if any director could create such a screwy world and find both humor and heart in it, it would be Michel Gondry, right?  I loved Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (it may be my all time favorite movie), and the quirky Science of Sleep was very enjoyable. So, I went into Be Kind, Rewind fully ready to love it. Sadly, however, Be Kind, Rewind doesn't measure up. It feels like a movie that can't quite decide what world it wants to inhabit -- in the process it feels rushed, forced, and artificial, as if the pressure to be quirky and heartfelt sabotaged both.The (almost) saving grace of this movie is that it clearly reflects an original, albeit only partially formed, vision. Charm and playfulness, however, aren't enough. And while Jack Black's performance is endearing to a degree, and many of the other actors seem so earnest in trying to bring Gondry's vision to life, they all ultimately have so little to work with that most of the characterizations fall flat.In the end, Be Kind, Rewind is at best a partially realized movie that needs to be rewound and remade.

I've wanted to see it since it came out and I finally got the chance. Now I don't know why the heck I was rushing!I feel the movie trailer cheats people. It makes you think this movie is hilarious when it's only funny in ""some"" spots and those spots aren't that great. I expected drop dead, nonstop laughter after seeing the ads for this movie. What I got was a chopped up script, goofy acting and straight silliness. I expected a lot more from a Jack Black comedy.The main thing that got to me was how unrealistic it was. And I'm not talking about the ""sweded"" movies. I'm talking about the fact that it is 2008 and people are still renting VHS tapes?!!!!  Come on!  Who is still renting VHS tapes in this day and age? That's why this film was ridiculous. Who only rents VHS now? Do they still make movies in VHS anyway? Please! I know this was just so they could have a way for the movies to be erased but this is something I could not get over. I especially couldn't get over it where Craig and his crew was concerned. Do you think these young, modern guys would be renting video tapes? I don't know if that was an inside joke or what but that's the main question going through my head.There were too many things unexplained. How did they get the money for remaking all these movies? When Mike and Jerry first begin this caper, they worked with what they had. As they begin to make more movies, they start having props, costumes and hiring people to be in the film. With what money? Also, wouldn't Mr. Fletcher had heard that this was happening in his video store even if he were out of town? I think two idiots making films over would have been national news, seeing how they did copyright infringement, etc.I don't know why Jack Black was in this film. I couldn't tell if it were independent or low budget after a while. I surely didn't understand why Mia Farrow, Danny Glover and Sigourney Weaver would even fart anywhere near this movie unless they were paid millions.This is the most disappointing movie I've seen in a while. Maybe my hopes were too high and maybe I relied on the trailer too much. It's not terrible but it sure as heck isn't great and the funniest parts are the shortest. I also think they could have picked more interesting movies for the characters to create and the film would have been funnier. It's funny when the Ghostbusters and Rush Hour 2 segments are created but after that, Be Kind Rewind goes downhill fast.I really don't know whether to recommend it or not.

Both Mr. Fletcher and Mike are interested in the life of Fats Waller, a great old time jazz music legend who was born in their building. Fats Waller reminds me of the great music legend himself, Fats Domino. Mr. Fletcher is old school and only carries VHS movies because he hasn't yet adopted to the change of the more modern world and because most of his clients only have VCRs. The area where the video store is located, the building itself, has been condemed and is about to be demolished, even though Mr. Fletcher has always maintained that it is a historical site because it was the birth site of Fats Waller.Mr. Fletcher leaves Mike in charge of the video store as he leaves out of town to celebrate the anniversary of Fats Waller's death.Mike's friend, Jerry (Jack Black), works for an electrical power plant company down the road and lives in a trailer that is right next to the plant.Jerry and Mike try a sabatoge mission because Jerry is convinced that the microwaves from the power plant are messing everybody up, only that the mission goes bad for Jerry and he ends up becoming magnitized. He goes back to the video store and accidently erases all of the VHS tapes in the store.When one of the customers, Miss Falewicz (Mia Farrow) comes in to rent Ghostbusters, Mike and Jerry say they don't have the movie availble, but Miss Falewicz informs them that if the movie isn't ready by the next day, she will call Mr. Fletcher and tell him how the store is being run. Mr. Fletcher asked her to keep an eye on the video store before he left.So they set in motion to film Ghostbusters on their own in only a couple of hours. You'll really laugh at how they redo the movie, like the library scene in Ghostbusters. It's passed from one person to another and before you know it, they start SWEDEDing other movies like Driving Ms. Daisy, King Kong, Men in Black, Robocop and Rush Hour.SWEDED is a term used by Jerry for their custom made films. While filming Ghostbusters, they meet Alma (Melonie Diaz) and she becomes the leading lady in all their movies.They become neighborhood movie stars and slowy try turning a profit to help fix the building from being torn down. The community gets involved and they start making their favorite movies and staring in them, like Boyz in the Hood.But then the government finds out about the infringment violations and gets involved. They destory all their tapes and fine Mr. Fletcher like 3 billion dollars.Mike, Jerry, Alma, and Mr. Fletcher lose all the money they raised and the demolition is now inevitable, so as a last hurrah they come up with an idea to make a movie on Fats Waller involving the ideas and the community themselves.This movie is really about friendship, community, and the heart and soul of film making, and why people fall in love with movies in the first place.It reminds you of those movies that hold a special place in your heart not because it was the #1 movie of all time, or because it has the most blood and guts, but rather because you can see that in that movie, they put their heart and souls into it.That is what Be Kind Rewind is really about, when movies were made carefully and heart and soul were put into a movie, not the big budget rush to DVD movies that are too often made now a days.GREAT MOVIE....with HEART and SOUL....you could not ask for more.Acting is amazing, , the story is original, the soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to, the remakes are funny and you'll laugh at how they do them.The ending is really sad, it really reminds me of the innocence lost in today's film market and leaves you longing for the days of the past.",5,GREAT HEARTFELT FILM....WORTH SEEING,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,3729,"['Danny', 'Glover', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'owner', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'Mike', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'Mike', 'are', 'interested', 'life', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'great', 'old', 'time', 'jazz', 'music', 'legend', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'building', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'great', 'music', 'legend', 'Fats', 'Domino', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'old', 'school', 'only', 'VHS', 'movies', ""n't"", 'yet', 'adopted', 'change', 'more', 'modern', 'world', 'most', 'clients', 'only', 'have', 'VCRs', 'area', 'where', 'video', 'store', 'located', 'building', 'been', 'condemed', 'be', 'demolished', 'even', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'always', 'maintained', 'historical', 'site', 'was', 'birth', 'site', 'Fats', 'Waller.Mr', 'Fletcher', 'Mike', 'charge', 'video', 'store', 'town', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'death.Mike', 'friend', 'Jerry', 'Jack', 'Black', 'electrical', 'power', 'plant', 'company', 'down', 'road', 'trailer', 'right', 'next', 'plant.Jerry', 'Mike', 'try', 'sabatoge', 'mission', 'Jerry', 'convinced', 'microwaves', 'power', 'plant', 'are', 'messing', 'everybody', 'up', 'only', 'mission', 'bad', 'Jerry', 'up', 'becoming', 'magnitized', 'back', 'video', 'store', 'accidently', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'store.When', 'one', 'customers', 'Miss', 'Falewicz', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'rent', 'Ghostbusters', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'availble', 'Miss', 'Falewicz', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ready', 'next', 'day', 'will', 'call', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'tell', 'how', 'store', 'being', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'asked', 'keep', 'eye', 'video', 'store', 'set', 'motion', 'film', 'Ghostbusters', 'own', 'only', 'couple', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'really', 'laugh', 'how', 'redo', 'movie', 'library', 'scene', 'Ghostbusters', 'passed', 'one', 'person', 'know', 'start', 'SWEDEDing', 'other', 'movies', 'Driving', 'Ms.', 'Daisy', 'King', 'Kong', 'Men', 'Black', 'Robocop', 'Rush', 'Hour.SWEDED', 'term', 'used', 'Jerry', 'custom', 'made', 'films', 'filming', 'Ghostbusters', 'meet', 'Alma', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'leading', 'lady', 'movies.They', 'become', 'neighborhood', 'movie', 'stars', 'slowy', 'try', 'turning', 'profit', 'help', 'fix', 'building', 'being', 'torn', 'down', 'community', 'involved', 'start', 'making', 'favorite', 'movies', 'staring', 'Boyz', 'Hood.But', 'then', 'government', 'out', 'infringment', 'violations', 'involved', 'destory', 'tapes', 'fine', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', '3', 'billion', 'dollars.Mike', 'Jerry', 'Alma', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'lose', 'money', 'raised', 'demolition', 'now', 'inevitable', 'so', 'last', 'hurrah', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'make', 'movie', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'involving', 'ideas', 'community', 'themselves.This', 'movie', 'really', 'friendship', 'community', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'making', 'why', 'people', 'fall', 'love', 'movies', 'first', 'place.It', 'movies', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'not', 'was', '1', 'movie', 'time', 'most', 'blood', 'guts', 'rather', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'put', 'heart', 'souls', 'what', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'really', 'about', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'carefully', 'heart', 'soul', 'were', 'put', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'rush', 'DVD', 'movies', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'made', 'now', 'days.GREAT', 'MOVIE', '.with', 'HEART', 'SOUL', '.you', 'could', 'not', 'ask', 'more.Acting', 'amazing', 'story', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'remakes', 'are', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'how', 'do', 'them.The', 'ending', 'really', 'sad', 'really', 'innocence', 'lost', 'today', 'film', 'market', 'longing', 'days', 'past']",N/A

I was actually pretty pumped to see it but the movie turned out to be a lot different than what I went in expecting. I was looking forward to a solid Jack Black style comedy but most of the movie wasn't funny in the least and more time was placed on the character's problems than the remade movies which was the appealing aspect of the movie to me. A movie that was sold as a comedy was instead a ""Poor guys turns problems into something positive for the community"" film which wasn't what I showed up to watch.The Good: There are a few chuckles here and there but not the pay off I was expecting. The production overall wasn't bad, including acting, cinematography and sound of the movie.The Bad: The story overall was ridiculous which would have been fine if the creator was going for a straight comedy instead of a film with serious underpinnings. They way in which they magnetized Black's character was terrible and could have been done in a substantially better way. Not enough time was devoted to the movie remakes.

Filming in negative with photocopied faces for example.  The kind of creativity that Gondry showed in his previous work, (mainly The Science of Sleeps TV studio) is on full display here.  The D.I.Y ethic is in effect here and while the film itself feels a little meandering and unintentioned that is also what makes it work.  Yes this movie is unrealistic, and yes it might not be as comedic as it wants to be, but there is an undeniable current of good will and optimism on display.  This is the very thing that megabudget CG films are missing most often, the power of the FAN to make works greater than those of of the machine.  I laughed enough at the likeable characters portrayed here and enjoyed the cast of side characters just enough to recommend this to the adventurous film goer and Gondry fans.The BluRay sports a decent transfer which is most evident in the amazing opening shot of NY, there are some fun extras like J.B. and Mos Def improvising some film music, and a really cool tribute to Fats Waller.This movie isn't for everybody and is probably the least of Gondrys work but it should leave those receptive to it with a little glow in their hearts.",4,"M.

1157145,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0017JHQOG,RMurray847,"[9, 10]","Here's what I knew when I sat down to watch BE KIND, REWIND.  It features Jack Black (not usually known for his subtle work) and Mos Def, who has done some over-the-top but amusing work himself (HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE, 16 BLOCKS).  I knew that these two were involved in accidentally erasing all the videos in a rundown old video rental place, and to undo the damage they had done, they set about refilming all the movies.I expected a loud, slick parody with lots slapstick.  What I saw was a film whose tone and pace shifted constantly.  It was a surprising film in that it dares to confound expectations at all times.  It had some truly funny moments, some quiet moments of surprising depth and some instances where the film almost ground to a halt.I suppose that knowing it came from Michael Gondry (of ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND and ADAPTATION) should have alerted me that nothing would be conventional about the film.  I think I let the presence of Jack Black distract me.I'm glad I saw the film, and I had a pleasant time doing so.  But it's slack pacing and constantly shifting tone did lull me into a drowse from time to time.  This film will not do well at the box office, but it's also the sort of film that will develop a small but fevered cult-lite following.Mos Def works at the store named BE KIND REWIND, run by the kindly Danny Glover.  The main thing this incredibly run down store in a run-down section of Passaic, NJ has going for it is the fact that this is the building in which Fats Waller was born many decades ago.  Mos and his friend Jack Black have listened to stories about Waller for years, and so they feel a dedication to keeping the store going and they feel an obligation to the poor and downtrodden denizens of their neighborhood.  (We simply have to accept that none of these folks is yet clamoring for a DVD player.)  So when Jack Black (a conspiracy-theory nut who runs a really shabby mechanics shop and lives in a trailer) becomes magnetized (don't ask) and erases all the videos...it's panic time for these two.  Glover is away for a few days, and has left Def in charge.  So these two ""brain trusts"" come up with idea of recreating all the films, one at a time, in the hopes of not being caught for their irresponsibility.They first take on GHOSTBUSTERS, and the clever manner in which they recreate scenes from this film on a literally zero budget (and take on many of the roles themselves) is pretty darn priceless.  The biggest laughs of the movie, by far, come in these re-creations.  Later they take on RUSH HOUR 2.No one in the neighborhood is tricked by these films...but the two auteurs inadvertently create a demand for these 20 minute, no-budget renditions, and they start a little business recreating films on demand.  They get several different movies in production at once, so we see DRIVING MISS DAISY, MEN IN BLACK and KING KONG (among others), all being recreated in a junkyard.  The methods they come up with to re-create beloved scenes are inspired in their lunacy (and serve as excellent reminders about how so much of filmmaking is the right camera angle!).The film also tries to become a somber meditation on this neighborhood, and the value of preserving it.  The building is set for rehabilitation by the city, and Glover must grapple with his impending loss.  The city officials aren't really painted as ""bad guys""...and no one is really saying the city doesn't deserve a rehab.  It's just more about the way that the old must give in to the new, and how sometimes the old wasn't all it was cracked up to be anyway.There are more plot twists towards the end, and eventually the film, which is pretty lightweight, is weighed down by a sense of sadness.  While I'm okay with sadness permeating a ""comedy"" (see DARJEELING LIMITED, for example)...the sadness in this case translate into a film that nearly grinds to a halt...everyone just moves slower and looks droopy.The script is certainly part of the problem.  Gondry was clearly shooting for whimsical...but the scenes of re-filming movies are too close to parody for the whimsy to really work.  And the two leads are also a problem.  Jack Black is trying to reign in his natural tendency to be antic, to ground himself more in reality...yet the script wants him to be a nut.  Mos Def, who comes across as more naturalistic, has a mumbling or diction problem that makes him hard to understand at times, and makes him vaguely annoying.  Glover is doing his ""sad old man"" bit again, and Mia Farrow shows up to do her ""slightly wacky old lady"" thing.  Sigourney Weaver shows us to do a tiny cameo, and her star presence is completely wasted.There are many things to admire and laugh at in BE KIND, REWIND.  By the same token, there is much to fault.  It's amazing how such a quiet movie could be so WILDLY uneven.[...]",3,"3 1/2 stars.

Farrow as Miss Falewicz,Melonie Diaz as Alma Sykes,and Arjay Smith as Manny.This is a movie with a ton of heart that doesn't quite get it out there,unfortunately,until the film is winding down.The story finds Glover as the owner of a video store in Passaic,N.J.,still selling VHS movies,and doing poorly.Def is his employee and Black is Def's best friend.Glover touts his old store as the birthplace of the legendary pianist great Thomas&#34;Fats&#34;Waller.When Glover leaves for Kansas City to attend the 60th anniversary of Fats'death,he puts Def in charge.Black,who lives in a junk yard trailer just down the street,and is a bit&#34;off sided&#34;,gets an idea to sabotage the local hydro electric generator.Def joins him but at the last minute backs out.Black throws a grappling hook into a transformer and electricity arcs all over the place,affecting Black.Next morning Black visits Def in the store and suddenly all of the movie tapes have been erased.It seems Black has acted as a giant magnet and unknowingly done the deed.If Glover finds out they're in deep trouble,so what to do?They decide they will make their own versions of the movies they have in the store.They do so and slowly but surely their business starts taking off like never before.When folks ask,Black tells them these are special imported versions of the films;&#34;Sweded&#34;(as in Sweden)versions.Glover returns from his trip with some ideas to modernize his store into renting DVDs.Glover also has a deadline of six weeks to keep with the city,as they want him to make renovations on his property or risk getting it torn down.It seems with all the money Def and Black have generated,they will be able to perform the necessary renno's.Who should walk in but a rep from the movie companies who is there to confiscate and destroy all the movies the two have made because they violate copyright laws.That having been done they have but one move left.The entire neighbourhood will pitch in together to make a movie of their own,about the life of Fats Waller.On the night of the demolition all the participants are gathered inside the tiny store and they throw a sheet up to capture the images from a projector.Well,it seems not only did the people inside see the film but an entire crowd outside got to enjoy the images also.Will the store be demo'd now?The recurring theme of Fats Waller resonates throughout this film.There is no bigger fan of the great pianist than myself,and I was very pleasantly surprised when events were unfolding before me.That aside though,the film seems to start out in one direction,veers away,then comes back to it.By that I mean we are slowly introduced to the main characters Def,Glover and Black.Then we go to cartoonish and silly time,with Black getting magnetized by the transformer.You really have to watch the scene to appreciate what I mean.The plot,over time, ends that silly plot thread and we're finally back to the business at hand.This movie would have worked fine on the level it started at,without having to resort to a screwy plot device like getting magnetized.It just didn't work for me because it was so silly and out of character with what we had so far seen.The constant is Def,Black and Glover who play it quite&#34;real&#34; with each other.Also there are some funny moments here and there especially the fun Def and Black have making 20 minute shorts out of full length movies.There's only one scene I howled at and that is when they are doing the Fats Waller story.Black comes out of wardrobe,with a derby hat,an afro wig and black face on.Again,you have to see it to believe it.At the end with the showing of the Fats Waller story,the film finally displays its' heart,but it is too little,too late.I was really surprised when I saw the rep from the movie company,who turned out to be none other than Sigourney Weaver doing a cameo.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Both w/s and full screen versions are here.There is a featurette and the trailer.All in all,while the theme of Fats Waller prevails throughout the film(an idol of mine),I cannot in all conscience give it more marks than I have.It has some funny moments throughout and the actors are good in their parts.But it veers into the realm of the silly and unreal while keeping an air of &#34;reality&#34;with its' character interaction,so there is a conflict there.Its real heart comes out far too late to do it any good. 3-3 1/2 stars.",3,"A movie with alot of heart,but....",1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,4609,"['Be',

I looked at the cast and knew they were all talented actors. What could possibly go wrong? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is ""the execution"". The film isn't sure what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? In large part. Is it a drama? Well, kind of. Is is social commentary? It tries to be. Is it a documentary about Fats Waller? Yes, distractingly enough, it is.The central concept is that a decrepit video store run by Danny Glover is left in the custody of Jack Black and Mos Def. Jack Black being (of course) the problematic troublemaker erases all the tapes after becoming magnetized (this is the comedy part...), requiring the two of them to remake all the movies with a camcorder, a process known as being ""sweded"" for reasons too complicated to get into here. The best portions of the movie are in the middle hour of the film where they are remaking everything from ""Rush Hour 2"" to ""Driving Miss Daisy"". The evil government wants to condemn the video store that Glover insists is the birthplace of Fats Waller (although he later admits that is a lie), and the three principals get sued for copyright infringement in an uninspired cameo courtesy of Sigourney Weaver. The final half hour or so of the film can't decide if it's drama, social commentary, or something completely different. This distinct lack of focus and plodding pace detract dramatically from the film.I really wanted to like this movie: I loved the premise, I liked the performers, and I thought it had immense potential.

Surprisingly, these homespun, zero-budget productions of such well-known items as ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"" quickly become a public sensation, with customers queuing up for blocks on end just for a chance to order up a ""remake"" of their choice.If ""Be Kind, Rewind"" proves anything, it is that one can stretch a one-joke premise only so far before it twangs right back in redundancy and attenuation. The movie parodies are frankly more lame than they are inspired, but winning performances (Black, Mos Def, Danny Glover, Mia Farrow and Sigourney Weaver, among others), an unusual locale (Passaic, New Jersey), and a certain roughhewn coziness in the movie's appearance and tone make this a harmless enough little trifle fit for a rainy day rental - though I doubt anyone will be requesting a camcorder version of ""Be Kind, Rewind"" anytime soon.",3,a better idea than it is a movie,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,1361,"['bizarre', 'industrial', 'accident', 'human', 'magnet', 'lovable', 'whacko', 'named', 'Jerry', 'Jack', 'Black', 'inadvertently', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'friend', 'low-end', 'video', 'store', 'low-end', 't', 'even', 'converted', 'DVDs', 'yet', 'compensate', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'loss', 'merchandise', 'employees', 'devise', 'scheme', 're-shoot', 'destroyed', 'films', 'own', 'camcorder', 'hoping', 'fool', 'gullible', 'customers', 'thinking', 're', 'renting', 'real', 'things', 'Surprisingly', 'homespun', 'zero-budget', 'productions', 'such', 'well-known', 'items', 'Ghostbusters', 'Rush', '2', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'quickly', 'become', 'public', 'sensation', 'customers', 'queuing', 'up', 'blocks', 'end', 'just', 'chance', 'order', 'up', 'remake', 'choice.If', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'anything', 'one', 'can', 'stretch', 'one-joke', 'premise', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'right', 'back', 'redundancy', 'attenuation', 'movie', 'parodies', 'are', 'frankly', 'more', 'lame', 'are', 'inspired', 'winning', 'performances', 'Black', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'others', 'unusual', 'locale', 'Passaic', 'New', 'Jersey', 'certain', 'roughhewn', 'coziness', 'movie', 'appearance', 'tone', 'make', 'harmless', 'enough', 'little', 'trifle', 'fit', 'rainy', 'day', 'rental', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'requesting', 'camcorder', 'version', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

The vomit jokes and the magnetic pee were two of the more gross aspects of the film.  The gal in the piece was underrated I think and did well considering the script.Getting everyone involved in making new editions of older films was a fun idea.  I was entertained by their versions of 2001 a Space Odessey (""Can't open the bay pod doors, Dave; you'll have to take a jog around the ship."") and Driving Miss Daisy, Rush Hour 2, and so on.  Funny, but certainly not ""side splitting"" once the novelty of the premise of the film wore off.The small love triangle with Mos Def, Jack Black and the female lead was very small to practically unnoticeable.The jazz fan played by Danny Glover was also under-played; they made a big deal out of it at the film's start and then they tried to make a new movie after being threatened with demolition.  Wooden acting by Sigourny Weaver.You can buy this flick as a cheap DVD on Amazon for about $8.00 but why?Don't be unkind.

A mere plot summary does not do justice to the quirky charm that makes this movie so darn fun - it has to be experienced.But this is a review, so here goes nothing.  Elroy Fletcher (Glover) runs a run-down video store on a run-down block of run-down Passaic, New Jersey.  (OK - that last bit is redundant.)  He goes on a scouting mission to modernize his store, leaving Mike (Def) in charge, with one basic rule:  don't let Jerry (Black) in the store.  Mike can't figure out the message at first, but he already kinda knows that Jerry never had screws in the first place, much less screws that are loose.Jerry still manages to get into the store after having magnetized himself in a raid on a local power plant.  The details of this ""raid"" shouldn't be spoiled, but I will say that it involves the most brilliant set of urban camouflage ever used.  Jerry demagnetizes all the tapes, and in order to keep their few customers happy, Jerry and Mike begin filming their own versions of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" ""King Kong,"" ""Rush Hour 2,"" etc.  The movies are marketed as special versions that have been ""Sweded,"" and the customers go bonkers for them.So what was first a bizarre character study gradually evolves into a paean to the magic of the movies.  The movies help us create our own little truth, even though every movie involves a thousand lies.  Who cares if a certain musician wasn't born in Passaic?  If there's a movie about the musician and it says he's from Passaic, that's all that matters.All the actors play their parts marvelously, with a lot of charm.  Even Black, who has enough zany energy to overwhelm a movie like this, works well within the ensemble.  I love Jack Black, but a lot of his movies (""School of Rock"") work because the other actors get out of his way. Here, the other actors work in balance with Black and the result is a movie that stars Jack Black but isn't a ""Jack Black movie.""Innovative camera work and a touching script make ""Be Kind Rewind"" one of the best feel-good movies from the last year, and over time this movie could evolve, a la ""Shawshank Redemption,"" into a modern classic.  I only give it four stars now because I think it might even be better on repeated viewings, at which time I will amend this review.

When I heard that he was cast in 'Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy', I was a little surprised, but thankfully tuned in to view a great performance by him in a film that some would eventually hate, but would slowly grow to be another cult classic.'Be Kind Rewind' is very touching and strangely interesting to watch. This is also an incredibly original premise for a movie as well which gives it extra cred/props/kudos, take your pick.At times the energy builds and you're very much into the remaking of the movies, the hype being generated, the Ghetto-fabulous neighborhood with the Video Store/Thrift Shop. And at other times, something is telling you to turn it off. I don't know why such a film hits both ends of the spectrum as this one does, but  it does. About the time, near the end where Danny Glover's character is thinking about switching to DVD's, this film should've really tried harder to wrap itself up and not continue for another 25 laborious minutes, which does feel laborious as you can see and feel the end coming, but always wondering where it's at.Maybe this film was a victim of poor editing choices done in post, or maybe it was just trying to achieve too much at all times. The Fats Waller plot theme is very quaint, but it's just that -- quaint, and after an audience has invested so much time in a movie that is probably the very - last - way they want to feel, unless it's something with Cher or Susan Sarandon. The writing should've managed that a little better and probably would've been better served with a few more rewrites. The very ending is a bit unbelievable and hokey, and has an ""Aww, shucks"" feel to it.This is probably only the second three star review I've ever given as I don't believe three stars really tells the reader anything.

This transfer and hidef preservation fall right in with what New Line has been known for: awesome supplementals to their titles. The 7.1 DTS and DTS-HD on the main feature compliment the first ""2.0 DTS"" I have seen, for the features. Could not access pop-up menu effects once I was into any of the special features, but they played nicely while watching the main film.So many of the colors are blands, grays, and darks that few colors get to shine through on the film, but the night footage and VHS ""organic"" feel come across nicely and actually add to the movie. A good color test for your display might be the purple shirts. The menu options are fun and have a nice transition speed/sound effects.Now for the special features:Behind the scenes featurette: 30+ minutes of how and why they made the film. The director's accent is hard to follow most times, and JB makes light of it for probably the funniest part of the docu. Half of this set is video blogs and filming stories but one has to be a JB fan to get through it all. I was playing the segment in-store and one customer commented on how JB ""gets old"" as his rants get quite lengthy.Portrait of Passaic, New Jersey: A great 10 minute piece for anyone that lives there or wants to see how things have evolved for this locale. Too few films make just a segment on the culture of where they filmed, so this represents nicely.Conv. with JB and Gondry: 5 minutes, more of the film blog feel and same style excerpts from main docu.Musical Trbute to FW with Mos Def: 6 minute segment filmed in a club environment with Mos Def giving a great performance - better than anything in the film. Probably worth the price just for the MD fans.JB and MD improv on Sweded songs: 5 minute street scene doing what they do best - trying to entertain the crew with improv.Complete Fats Waller Biopic: The entire 11 minute film they show parts of in the film (beginning credits and the last film showing in-store). A respectful yet ""Be Kind Rewind-ish"" montage to the artist.The Infinifilm symbol from either main menu or special features menu access all of the lengthy Blu credits - could not find any Easter Eggs on this first try though (as with other Infinifilm DVDs).Overall - worth the BD price if you are fans of the main three - JB, MD or Fats.",4,A Blu review only...,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,2391,"['four', 'stars', 'following', 'review', 'are', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'only', 'Was', 'played', 'Sony', 'BDP-S301', 'transfer', 'hidef', 'preservation', 'fall', 'right', 'what', 'New', 'Line', 'been', 'known', 'awesome', 'supplementals', 'titles', '7.1', 'DTS', 'DTS-HD', 'main', 'feature', 'compliment', 'first', '2.0', 'DTS', 'have', 'seen', 'features', 'Could', 'not', 'access', 'pop-up', 'menu', 'effects', 'once', 'was', 'special', 'features', 'played', 'nicely', 'watching', 'main', 'film.So', 'many', 'colors', 'are', 'blands', 'grays', 'few', 'colors', 'get', 'shine', 'film', 'night', 'footage', 'VHS', 'organic', 'feel', 'come', 'nicely', 'actually', 'add', 'movie', 'good', 'color', 'test', 'display', 'might', 'be', 'purple', 'shirts', 'menu', 'options', 'are', 'fun', 'have', 'nice', 'transition', 'speed/sound', 'effects.Now', 'special', 'features', 'scenes', 'featurette', '30+', 'minutes', 'how', 'why', 'made', 'film', 'director', 'accent', 'hard', 'follow', 'most', 'times', 'JB', 'light', 'probably', 'funniest', 'part', 'docu', 'Half', 'set', 'video', 'blogs', 'filming', 'stories', 'one', 'be', 'JB', 'fan', 'get', 'was', 'playing', 'segment', 'in-store', 'one', 'customer', 'commented', 'how', 'JB', 'old', 'rants', 'get', 'quite', 'lengthy.Portrait', 'Passaic', 'New', 'Jersey', 'great', '10', 'minute', 'piece', 'anyone', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'evolved', 'locale', 'Too', 'few', 'films', 'make', 'just', 'segment', 'culture', 'where', 'filmed', 'nicely.Conv', 'JB', 'Gondry', '5', 'minutes', 'more', 'film', 'blog', 'feel', 'same', 'style', 'excerpts', 'main', 'docu.Musical', 'Trbute', 'FW', 'Mos', 'Def', '6', 'minute', 'segment', 'filmed', 'club', 'environment', 'Mos', 'Def', 'giving', 'great', 'performance', 'better', 'anything', 'film', 'Probably', 'price', 'just', 'MD', 'fans.JB', 'MD', 'improv', 'Sweded', 'songs', '5', 'minute', 'street', 'scene', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'trying', 'entertain', 'crew', 'improv.Complete', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'Biopic', 'entire', '11', 'minute', 'film', 'show', 'parts', 'film', 'beginning', 'credits', 'last', 'film', 'showing', 'in-store', 'respectful', 'yet', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind-ish', 'montage', 'artist.The', 'Infinifilm', 'symbol', 'main', 'menu', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'access', 'lengthy', 'Blu', 'credits', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'first', 'try', 'though', 'other', 'Infinifilm', 'DVDs', '.Overall', 'BD', 'price', 'are', 'fans', 'main', 'three', 'JB', 'MD', 'Fats']",N/A

In that area, this film delivers.  Jack Black plays Jerry, a guy that is more than a little weird who happens to magnetize himself while trying to sabotage the power company.  His pal Mike is played by Mos Def.  Mike works in a small video store that still rents -- perish the thought -- VHS videos.  The owner of the store, Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover), is a jazz fan that repeatedly told Mike and neighborhood kids tales of famous jazz musician Fats Waller and how he'd lived in the same building that Mr. Fletcher's video store Be Kind Rewind now occupies.  Mr. Fletcher goes off for a reunion of his buddies and while he is gone, Mike lets Jerry in the store (despite Mr. Fletcher's mixed up instructions not to let that happen) while he's magnetized and of course the store's inventory of tapes winded up erased.Mike and Jerry take matters into their own hands and wind up creating replacement films for the customers that come in demanding something to watch.  With a bunch of blank tapes and video camera in hand, they start creating their own versions of the films that customers are asking for.  Sweded versions of films.  (Short versions of films that still convey the main story.)Soon the neighborhood residents and customers are all in the act, helping to create the films that they want to see.  Meanwhile Mr. Fletcher has to raise enough money to save his building from urban renewal and the hands of developers.  Can he raise enough money to save his business and building or will outside forces keep that from happening?Warning to light sensitive viewers, the film starts out 'blinking' (strobing) intentionally.  If you are sensitive to such things, avoid the film. At a minimum consider yourself forewarned.  The same strobing is done later in the film, so don't consider it safe just because you've gotten through the early segments of the film.Included in the film are several nods to other films as we get to see films Sweded.  Films like Robocop, Driving Miss Daisy (which really would be improved by such a process ;-) , Ghostbuster and more.  It's fun to see Mike and Jerry making their own versions of these films and it's interesting to see the reaction of the customers as more customers keep showing up to see the versions of movies that they've done.I've rated this film at 4 stars though I really think it's more of a 3.5/5 stars film.  I've rounded up, but could just as easily have leaned in the other direction and rounded down towards 3 stars.  The film is rated PG-13 and is family friendly enough to see with younger viewers.  Share it with your family if you'd like a few laughs.",4,So many movies would be better Sweded :-),1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,2994,"['So', 'many', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'really', 'were', ""'Sweded"", 'film', 'little', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'end', 'may', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'story', 'had', 'changed', 'way', 'fun', 'charming', 'picture', 'end.Of', 'course', 'nothing', 'film', 'really', 'believable', 'film', 'Jack', 'Black', 'expected', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'crazy', 'zany', 'area', 'film', 'delivers', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Jerry', 'guy', 'more', 'little', 'weird', 'who', 'magnetize', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'power', 'company', 'pal', 'Mike', 'played', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Mike', 'small', 'video', 'store', 'still', 'perish', 'thought', 'VHS', 'videos', 'owner', 'store', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'jazz', 'fan', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'Mike', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'tales', 'famous', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Fats', 'Waller', 'how', ""'d"", 'lived', 'same', 'building', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'video', 'store', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'now', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'off', 'reunion', 'buddies', 'gone', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'store', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'mixed', 'up', 'instructions', 'not', 'let', 'happen', 'magnetized', 'course', 'store', 'inventory', 'tapes', 'winded', 'up', 'erased.Mike', 'Jerry', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'wind', 'up', 'creating', 'replacement', 'films', 'customers', 'come', 'demanding', 'something', 'watch', 'bunch', 'blank', 'tapes', 'video', 'camera', 'hand', 'start', 'creating', 'own', 'versions', 'films', 'customers', 'are', 'asking', 'Sweded', 'versions', 'films', 'Short', 'versions', 'films', 'still', 'main', 'story', 'Soon', 'neighborhood', 'residents', 'customers', 'are', 'act', 'helping', 'create', 'films', 'want', 'see', 'Meanwhile', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'save', 'building', 'urban', 'renewal', 'hands', 'developers', 'Can', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'save', 'business', 'building', 'will', 'outside', 'forces', 'keep', 'happening', 'Warning', 'light', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'film', 'out', ""'blinking"", 'strobing', 'intentionally', 'are', 'sensitive', 'such', 'things', 'avoid', 'film', 'minimum', 'consider', 'forewarned', 'same', 'strobing', 'done', 'later', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'safe', 'just', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'early', 'segments', 'film.Included', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'nods', 'other', 'films', 'get', 'see', 'films', 'Sweded', 'Films', 'Robocop', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'really', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'such', 'process', 'Ghostbuster', 'more', 'fun', 'see', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'making', 'own', 'versions', 'films', 'interesting', 'see', 'reaction', 'customers', 'more', 'customers', 'keep', 'showing', 'up', 'see', 'versions', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'done.I', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'really', 'think', 'more', '3.5/5', 'stars', 'film', ""'ve"", 'rounded', 'up', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'leaned', 'other', 'direction', 'rounded', 'down', 'towards', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'family', 'friendly', 'enough', 'see', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Share', 'family', ""'d"", 'like', 'few', 'laughs']",N/A

A simple yet absurd idea fuels quality parody laughs, but the story attempts to have meaning - which it is unable to muster. Essentially a series of skits sewn together with incongruous drama, Be Kind Rewind bizarrely executes a plot that fuses reality and fantasy in the most unpalatable of manners. When every harebrained concept is wholly unrealistic and the conflict is depressingly real, the outcome is one that can't find resolution - least of all satisfactorily.In Passaic, New York, Mike (Mos Def) is left in charge of a shoddy video rental store called ""Be Kind Rewind,"" while owner Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) takes a vacation to investigate how to make his business boom. Being threatened by contractors who wish to level his dilapidated building, his only hope is to raise a huge sum of money to pay for the necessary repairs. When neighboring friend Jerry (Jack Black) accidentally becomes magnetized and erases all of the VHS tapes in the store, Mike must quickly think of a plan to replace them. Jerry suggests re-filming each movie using themselves as actors, and much to everyone's surprise, the customers actually like the home-made short films. Recruiting Alma (Melonie Diaz) and several of the townsfolk, (allowing them to become ""stockholders of their own happiness"") Mike and Jerry start raising money to save the nostalgic store, but soon events spiral out of their control when studio agents discover the copyright-infringing antics of the desperate duo.A few riotously funny gags occur outside of the direct spoofs of popular blockbuster films, but for the most part the real draw is the amateur filmmaking stabs at vastly recognizable cinematic sensations. An unusual camouflage skit is thrown in for unrealistic measure, a badly botched break-in, and Jack Black donning an awkward ""blackface"" look are but a few of the jokes mixed in to Be Kind Rewind. Unfortunately most of them are insignificant next to the laughs derived from the mocking of famous films. From Ghostbusters to Rush Hour 2 to Robocop to Driving Miss Daisy, nothing is sacred and everything is fair game.Be Kind Rewind starts to work on the level of a mindless buddy comedy, but quickly diverts to a lackluster drama that wishes to exude some meaningful motifs of believing in yourself, overcoming odds and the power of community, but it seems tragically wasted. Instantly the boundaries of realism are dashed aside when Jack Black becomes magnetized during his power plant sabotage attempt, and continuously as the city's colorful characters all willingly play along by participating in the re-filming of classic movies.The concepts in the film are so largely unfathomable that it doesn't matter that director Michel Gondry interferes with the viewer by adding distortion to the screen or other devices that remove the audience from becoming lost in the ridiculousness of simply watching a movie. Gathering together $60,000 in one week, ""Sweding"" dozens of films with little more than three actors and a few props and battling evil movie studio lawyers, Be Kind Rewind doesn't include much in the way of rationale. Regardless of the few decent laughs, this is a film that loses its focus early on and besots the audience with immature sight gags that blend slapstick with crudeness. By the nonsensical conclusion, little is resolved other than that many decent little ideas couldn't add up to a fulfilling feature film.Michel Gondry has again taken an intriguing idea and crafted a bizarre comedy rife with experimentalism. Ludicrous and laugh-out-loud funny at times, dreadfully serious and grounded in reality at others, Be Kind Rewind never fully realizes the potential of its comedic premise with a slew of mixed messages adrift in a sea of unbelievability. The suspension of disbelief required by the audience becomes a far more demanding task when such delirious events happen in a setting so bleakly realistic. Unfortunately, Gondry's film isn't kind enough to just let us have our laughs.- The Massie Twins",2,Be Kind Rewind Movie Review,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,4117,"['Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'could', 'work', 'short', 'film', 'feature', 'length', 'comedy', 'dry', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'simple', 'yet', 'absurd', 'idea', 'fuels', 'quality', 'parody', 'story', 'attempts', 'have', 'meaning', 'unable', 'muster', 'Essentially', 'series', 'skits', 'sewn', 'together', 'incongruous', 'drama', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'bizarrely', 'plot', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'most', 'unpalatable', 'manners', 'When', 'harebrained', 'concept', 'wholly', 'unrealistic', 'conflict', 'depressingly', 'real', 'outcome', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'resolution', 'least', 'satisfactorily.In', 'Passaic', 'New', 'York', 'Mike', 'Mos', 'Def', 'left', 'charge', 'shoddy', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'called', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'owner', 'Mr.', 'Fletcher', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'vacation', 'investigate', 'how', 'make', 'business', 'boom', 'Being', 'threatened', 'contractors', 'who', 'wish', 'level', 'dilapidated', 'building', 'only', 'hope', 'raise', 'huge', 'sum', 'money', 'pay', 'necessary', 'repairs', 'When', 'neighboring', 'friend', 'Jerry', 'Jack', 'Black', 'accidentally', 'magnetized', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'store', 'Mike', 'must', 'quickly', 'think', 'plan', 'replace', 'Jerry', 're-filming', 'movie', 'using', 'actors', 'much', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'customers', 'actually', 'home-made', 'short', 'films', 'Recruiting', 'Alma', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'several', 'townsfolk', 'allowing', 'become', 'stockholders', 'own', 'happiness', 'Mike', 'Jerry', 'start', 'raising', 'money', 'save', 'nostalgic', 'store', 'soon', 'events', 'spiral', 'control', 'when', 'studio', 'agents', 'copyright-infringing', 'antics', 'desperate', 'duo.A', 'few', 'riotously', 'funny', 'gags', 'occur', 'direct', 'spoofs', 'popular', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'real', 'draw', 'amateur', 'filmmaking', 'stabs', 'vastly', 'recognizable', 'cinematic', 'sensations', 'unusual', 'camouflage', 'skit', 'thrown', 'unrealistic', 'measure', 'badly', 'botched', 'break-in', 'Jack', 'Black', 'donning', 'awkward', 'blackface', 'look', 'are', 'few', 'jokes', 'mixed', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'are', 'insignificant', 'next', 'laughs', 'derived', 'mocking', 'famous', 'films', 'Ghostbusters', 'Rush', '2', 'Robocop', 'Driving', 'Miss', 'Daisy', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'everything', 'fair', 'game.Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'work', 'level', 'mindless', 'buddy', 'comedy', 'quickly', 'diverts', 'lackluster', 'drama', 'exude', 'meaningful', 'motifs', 'believing', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'power', 'community', 'tragically', 'wasted', 'Instantly', 'boundaries', 'realism', 'are', 'dashed', 'aside', 'when', 'Jack', 'Black', 'magnetized', 'power', 'plant', 'sabotage', 'attempt', 'continuously', 'city', 'colorful', 'characters', 'willingly', 'play', 'along', 'participating', 're-filming', 'classic', 'movies.The', 'concepts', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'largely', 'unfathomable', ""n't"", 'matter', 'director', 'Michel', 'Gondry', 'viewer', 'adding', 'distortion', 'screen', 'other', 'devices', 'remove', 'audience', 'becoming', 'lost', 'ridiculousness', 'simply', 'watching', 'movie', 'Gathering', 'together', '60,000', 'one', 'week', 'Sweding', 'dozens', 'films', 'little', 'more', 'three', 'actors', 'few', 'props', 'battling', 'evil', 'movie', 'studio', 'lawyers', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', ""n't"", 'include', 'much', 'way', 'rationale', 'Regardless', 'few', 'decent', 'laughs', 'film', 'focus', 'early', 'besots', 'audience', 'immature', 'sight', 'gags', 'blend', 'slapstick', 'crudeness', 'nonsensical', 'conclusion', 'little', 'resolved', 'other', 'many', 'decent', 'little', 'ideas', 'could', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'fulfilling', 'feature', 'film.Michel', 'Gondry', 'again', 'taken', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'crafted', 'bizarre', 'comedy', 'rife', 'experimentalism', 'Ludicrous', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'times', 'dreadfully', 'serious', 'grounded', 'reality', 'others', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'never', 'fully', 'potential', 'comedic', 'premise', 'slew', 'mixed', 'messages', 'adrift', 'sea', 'unbelievability', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'audience', 'far', 'more', 'demanding', 'task', 'when', 'such', 'delirious', 'events', 'happen', 'setting', 'so', 'bleakly', 'realistic', 'Unfortunately', 'Gondry', 'film', ""n't"", 'kind', 'enough', 'just', 'let', 'have', 'laughs.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

(A rare event these days! :-D)My thoughts ...-- Danny Glover and Mos Def were wonderful. I get hot and cold on Jack Black, and mostly he left me cold in this movie (although, surprisingly, he warmed up in the ""making of"" documentary that was included on the DVD. Perhaps he should've been more himself in the movie.)-- It was also fun to see Mia Farrow as a crazy neighbor lady. And with the lampooning of ""Ghost Busters"", the tongue-in-cheek casting of Sigourney Weaver as a corporate lawyer was perfect!-- Casting aside, I thought the pacing of this movie was a bit uneven. The trailer presents it as a straight-forward comedy, but it is far more than that.

All talents are capable but of no use on this production.Albiet the writer's strike of '07 has been over for awhile. However , "" Be Kind Rewind "" is a reminder. I like Mos Def and Jack Black , respectively. Sadly , they have as much chemistry as tennis shoes and mustard. I was taken aback by the shotty cinetography and bad acting. It felt as though someone had written a generic script and cast everyone that was available for the weekend. Ironic , because the premise of the film is based on the same synopsis. Don't look for any hilarious moments in this lemon. Danny Glover's performance as a video store proprietor is as generic as it gets. Jack Black tries to save some of the film with the comedic skills that launched his career and Mos Def attempts to flesh out his character as well. Too bad it's all for nothing. I haven't a clue why this film recieved the greenlight for production.

But, what was funny was the concept of remaking the movies that got erased.  It became funny once they started ""shooting"" Ghostbusters.  One of my all time favorite movies!!  The fact that they hit a lot of parts of Ghostbusters was funny.  This movie kind of brings you back to the days where video tape was king!!!  None of this DVD stuff.  Which they make a reference to the DVD as starting to take over the market.  This movie, once it caught momentum, really turned out to be funny.  Especially when they began shooting ""Rush Hour 2"" and need to film a scene where Jackie Chan, played by Jack Black, had to kiss the villain, who was their mechanic.  Which is a guy!!  He didn't want anything to do with the scene and quit.  Saying, ""You guys gotta find someone else"".  They ended up finding a girl to play the parts of the women in their movies.  And their little projects just cranked up and it was funny!!!If you want a movie that doesn't try to hard in the laughs department, yet makes you laugh just out of being silly, then this movie is one for you.  I recommend you watch this movie with a group of people who enjoy the older movies like, Robocop, Ghostbusters, Rush Hour, Men in Black, etc.  These movies were the ones they had to redo.

""Be Kind, Rewind"" has the friendly, bumbling, everyman feel of comedies like ""The Full Monty"" or ""Waking Ned Devine"" (although obviously, set in a New Jersey ghetto and not in picturesque Ireland).  Like those comedies, ""Be Kind, Rewind"" is generally a smiler, and not a knee-slapper, but that's OK with me - I like to smile.The basic premise of this picture has been covered here by other reviewers - inner city video-store clerk and kooky pal try to cover-up accidental erasure of the store's VHS tapes by remaking blockbuster Hollywood hit movies with a hand-held video camera.I really like the premise - in today's prefab comedy market, I think that a screwball premise like this one should be appreciated and encouraged.  I, for one, am sick and tired of all the witless parodies (like Scarey Movie 943, Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie).  Film comedy has suffered terribly over the past decade or so from those kinds of cheap products.And speaking of cheap products, these two film auteurs turn out some truly smile-worthy efforts as they producer ""Sweded"" (where they got that word, I don't know) remakes of films as diverse as ""The Lion King, ""Robocop"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""2001"".The film starts off somewhat slowly, but it has some interesting characters, including Sigourney Weaver as a hardball-playing copyright infringement attorney and Mia Farrow as a depressed, yet tidy video customer.  I imagine all the actors involved had fun with this movie.What was saddening to me is that, at the video store where I rented this, there were large displays of idiotic, brain-dead parodies, like ""Meet the Spartans"", and only three copies of ""Be Kind, Rewind"".
