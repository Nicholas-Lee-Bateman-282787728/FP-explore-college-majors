Prins-Stairs ""Spaction3""","[8, 16]","This was the WORST dubbed season of the series ever, I would stick to just downloading the originals or finding imports of them on eBay if you can.  The way this season was butchered, the way these characters were voiced, The replacement music added, the stuff changed in this dub, insulting.  Jason Griffith is the WORST voice actor I have ever heard, have you actually listened to him in Sonic Riders?  The way he made Sonic say ""Yeah"" compared to the way Ryan said it in ""Sonic Advance 3"" and other games is insulting to the character.  I was originally looking forward to this but then when I saw how much it was altered and edited, I just could not watch anymoreDon't buy this DVD, you would be better off just recording the episodes off of TV for yourself.",1,A series that was great in Japanese but these season has been terribly butchered,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,762,"['was', 'WORST', 'dubbed', 'season', 'series', 'ever', 'would', 'stick', 'just', 'downloading', 'originals', 'finding', 'imports', 'eBay', 'can', 'way', 'season', 'was', 'butchered', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'voiced', 'replacement', 'music', 'added', 'stuff', 'changed', 'dub', 'insulting', 'Jason', 'Griffith', 'WORST', 'voice', 'actor', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'have', 'actually', 'listened', 'Sonic', 'Riders', 'way', 'made', 'Sonic', 'say', 'Yeah', 'compared', 'way', 'Ryan', 'said', 'Sonic', 'Advance', '3', 'other', 'games', 'insulting', 'character', 'was', 'originally', 'looking', 'forward', 'then', 'when', 'saw', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'altered', 'edited', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'anymoreDo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'recording', 'episodes', 'TV']",Sonic X - Complete Fifth Season

It has more episodes than the standard volumes. The third season in my opinion was the best of Sonic X. By the way, if you buy this the cover does NOT look like the one Amazon is displaying!!! It only has Sonic on it in that pose on there, and there's a nighttime background with a spaceship behind him.",5,"It's a cool DVD, not worth the prices being charged on here though",1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,405,"['bought', 'DVD', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'October', '2006', 'like', 'fact', '2', 'discs', 'more', 'episodes', 'standard', 'volumes', 'third', 'season', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'Sonic', 'X', 'way', 'buy', 'cover', 'NOT', 'look', 'one', 'Amazon', 'displaying', 'only', 'Sonic', 'pose', 'there', 'nighttime', 'background', 'spaceship']",Sonic X - Complete Fifth Season
