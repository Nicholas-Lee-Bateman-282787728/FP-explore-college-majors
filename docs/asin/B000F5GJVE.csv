983268,A2U65YGOZL64GM,B000F5GJVE,Christine de Guzman,"[25, 25]","First of all, I can't rave enough about this series.  I am 22 years old now and remember growing up watching this show on the Snick lineup on Nickelodeon.  I used to watch all the shows that would air on those nights but I can only really remember this one the most.  It was just so awesome.  I would always wait for something scary to actually happen and it never did, but it was still such a great show.  The fact that it wasn't violent or anything of that sort at all made it age appropriate for anyone.  After everyone's repeated requests for this series to be on DVD, it FINALLY is available!  At first it was only available through Amazon.ca, which is how I obtained it, but now I believe it is available in the US.  I give this 4 stars because it is such a great show and I've been waiting so long to have it on DVD.  The only main complaints I have are that the case could have been made better.  It is not very sturdy but the company could have at least put an outer casing instead of making it look like it was missing something.  Also, the interactive menu on the DVDs play the beginning of the theme song.  For some reason it re-plays the first 3-5 seconds then goes on to play the rest. It sounds like the DVD is defective but it actually isn't. It's kind of annoying but just ignore it.  They could have been a bit more creative with the menus, but who cares.  The front cover has scenes that don't appear to be on the first season and there is a centered picture of all members from this season.  On the back cover, it only lists four.  I didn't think that was fair to the other members.  Also, the DVDs weren't done through a digital transfer so the quality isn't that great.  I suppose it would have been better if Nickelodeon made the DVD set but hey, beggars can't be choosers, right? I'm satisfied with just having an official set on DVD but I hope they will do all the seasons and perhaps improve them.  I watched it the first day I received it and felt so nostalgic.  It's just as good as I remembered it and I still appreciate watching it today.  It's unfortunate that TV shows these days are just uncreative garbage.  I think that they should bring back all the good shows from the 90s and put them on DVD.  Are You Afraid of the Dark is definitely legendary in my book.",4,FINALLY!,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2294,"['First', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rave', 'enough', 'series', 'am', '22', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'remember', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'Snick', 'lineup', 'Nickelodeon', 'used', 'watch', 'shows', 'would', 'air', 'nights', 'can', 'only', 'really', 'remember', 'one', 'most', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'awesome', 'would', 'always', 'wait', 'something', 'scary', 'actually', 'happen', 'never', 'did', 'was', 'still', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'violent', 'anything', 'sort', 'made', 'age', 'appropriate', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'repeated', 'requests', 'series', 'be', 'DVD', 'FINALLY', 'available', 'first', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'Amazon.ca', 'how', 'obtained', 'now', 'believe', 'available', 'US', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'such', 'great', 'show', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'so', 'long', 'have', 'DVD', 'only', 'main', 'complaints', 'have', 'are', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'better', 'not', 'very', 'sturdy', 'company', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'put', 'outer', 'casing', 'instead', 'making', 'look', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'Also', 'interactive', 'menu', 'DVDs', 'play', 'beginning', 'theme', 'song', 'reason', 'first', '3-5', 'seconds', 'then', 'play', 'rest', 'DVD', 'defective', 'actually', ""n't"", 'kind', 'annoying', 'just', 'ignore', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'creative', 'menus', 'who', 'front', 'cover', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'first', 'season', 'centered', 'picture', 'members', 'season', 'back', 'cover', 'only', 'four', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'fair', 'other', 'members', 'Also', 'DVDs', 'were', ""n't"", 'done', 'digital', 'transfer', 'quality', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'suppose', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Nickelodeon', 'made', 'DVD', 'set', 'hey', 'beggars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'choosers', 'right', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'just', 'having', 'official', 'set', 'DVD', 'hope', 'will', 'do', 'seasons', 'perhaps', 'improve', 'watched', 'first', 'day', 'received', 'felt', 'so', 'nostalgic', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'remembered', 'still', 'appreciate', 'watching', 'today', 'unfortunate', 'TV', 'shows', 'days', 'are', 'just', 'uncreative', 'garbage', 'think', 'should', 'bring', 'back', 'good', 'shows', '90s', 'put', 'DVD', 'Are', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'definitely', 'legendary', 'book']",Are You Afraid of the Dark?: Season 1

I am 24 and have been looking for this series since tv shows started appearing on dvd sets and finally they are here. I still love this show. The characters around the campfire are not the stars- the scary stories they tell take center stage. We're not talking blood and gore but stories where little girls are trapped on the other side of a mirror, or a teenage ghost is still waiting in a grave yard for her boyfriend to take her prom, or a pair of cheap glasses let you see an another dimension, or vampires move in next door and your mother invites them in. This is still spooky and the stories don't always end happily. The seasons episodes are as follows.1.The Phantom Cab2.The Lonely Ghost3.Laughing in the Dark4.The Twisted Claw5.The Hungry Hounds6.The Prom Queen7.The Captured Souls8.The Nightly Neighbors9.The Dark Music10.Jake and the Leprechaun11.The Super Specs12.The Sorcerer's Apprentice13.The Pinball WIzardIf you are a fan of the show you must also pick up season 2. One sour note- this dvd set was not made with an outer cover. Oh well.

My girlfriend, our son, and I have been enjoying these DVD's!!! I remember watching this series on Nickelodeon's Snick, years ago. The case these discs come in is overall cool! The DVD's aren't as easy to get out as other DVD cases....but it's not har either. The picture quality is not widescreen, nore HD. They are as we all watched them in the 90's. Standard format and average picture. But none the less the picture is fine. It looks fine/good on a LCD, & in a Blu-ray player too! I have my Blu-ray player set up so it does play this set in widescreen. And I use HDMI, & it looks good. The sound is good quality for it's age also. This set has the entire first season (13 episodes) and comes w/ a bonus episode. The opening is slightly different from what I remember. It starts off the same. Then has extra music and footage of episodes. It's all good though. It may be due to being manufactured in Canada. They may have aired the opening that way in Canada. If you used to watch & follow this show (especially with the original cast) you won't be let down buying this set! I've seen this set sell on here for about $115.00. Me personally....I wouldn't pay nearly that, even though I watched this like crazy back in the day! I paid $25.00 for it. And I think that is well worth it! If you happen to find this DVD set for even around $40.00 you may wanna get it. I guess people are saying it is hard to find. It is 100% authentic & manufactured by I believe Direct Source or Coliseum.",5,Submitting my aproval for Are You Afraid Of The Dark?
