616546,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,B00005JMCT,Adi Adler,"[1, 2]","One of the things the producers behind 'American Pie 2' were proud of was that most of the cast (and all of the major players) of the first movie returned. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Oz (Chris Klein), which was an integral part of the group in the first two movies, isn't even mentioned in 'American Wedding'. An actor's absemce (whether it's due to his unwillingness to rejoin the franchise or any other reason) is understandable. And since Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) had so little to do, Oz's absence was a blessing in a way. But a mention of him and his whereabouts would have made much more sense than completely erasing him from the American Pie 'mythology', hoping we (the viewers) won't notice.While Finch &amp; Kevin fade into the background, Stifler (Seann William Scott) gets a much bigger part than ever before. He's still an obnoxious girl chaser, who didn't seem to outgrow his highschool juvenile - jock personna, up until the end of the movie.Besides the big change in the group dynamics, this movie (unlike 'Pie 2') takes a big turn story wise. Jim, Michelle, and their wedding are now the center of the movie, instead of the group's friendship &amp; dynamics. We don't get to see the 'stories' of Kevin or Finch, for instance, develop any further, or hear a word about their current relationships (besides the inevitable encounter with Stifler's Mom).The laughs, though, are still there. They still are, or course, immature and pretty coarse, but by now, this is wat is expected of the 'American Pie' series.",3,Is a bad pie still an American Pie?,1079568000,"03 18, 2004",2004,1571,"['One', 'things', 'producers', ""'American"", 'Pie', '2', 'were', 'proud', 'was', 'most', 'cast', 'major', 'players', 'first', 'movie', 'returned', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Oz', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'group', 'first', 'two', 'movies', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', ""'American"", 'Wedding', 'actor', 'absemce', 'due', 'unwillingness', 'rejoin', 'franchise', 'other', 'reason', 'understandable', 'Kevin', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'Finch', 'Eddie', 'Kay', 'Thomas', 'had', 'so', 'little', 'do', 'Oz', 'absence', 'was', 'blessing', 'way', 'mention', 'whereabouts', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'completely', 'erasing', 'American', 'Pie', ""'mythology"", 'hoping', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice.While', 'Finch', 'amp', 'Kevin', 'fade', 'background', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'much', 'bigger', 'part', 'ever', 'before', 'still', 'obnoxious', 'girl', 'chaser', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'outgrow', 'highschool', 'juvenile', 'jock', 'personna', 'up', 'end', 'movie.Besides', 'big', 'change', 'group', 'dynamics', 'movie', '2', 'big', 'turn', 'story', 'wise', 'Jim', 'Michelle', 'wedding', 'are', 'now', 'center', 'movie', 'instead', 'group', 'friendship', 'amp', 'dynamics', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', ""'stories"", 'Kevin', 'Finch', 'instance', 'develop', 'further', 'hear', 'word', 'current', 'relationships', 'inevitable', 'encounter', 'Stifler', 'Mom', '.The', 'laughs', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'are', 'course', 'immature', 'pretty', 'coarse', 'now', 'wat', 'expected', ""'American"", 'Pie', 'series']",American Wedding

To me the premise sounded a bit forced.  An American Wedding?  Come on.  But...once I saw the movie I told everyone I knew they had to see this movie.I was glad to see that Stifler was more of a main character in this movie...because he is always good for several laughs...and the whole mess-up with the flowers shows that Stifler is a multidementional character...not just one who likes to antagonize everyone.As always the movie was chocked full of slapstick and bathroom humor.

616550,A5S3BAWLNT10P,B00005JMCT,Amazon Customer,"[0, 2]","If there were any concept of talent or justice in Hollywood, Jesse Dylan would not be allowed to direct another film as long as he lived. I watched this film with my expectations set about as low as I could possibly set them. And amazingly the film was even worse.For those who don't know, the American Pie movies, of which this is the third, are a series of comedies that want to have their American Pie and eat it, by opting for both trying to gross us out and then claiming a kind of cloying moral message at the end,. These kids are desperate for sex, but of course at the end of it, they always do see that there's more to life than sex.And, naturally, because the films have to cop out anyway to satisfy what they see as a hormonally challenged teen target audience, they get the sex as well.The first of the films did surprise a little by the eventual maturity of its message, even though - as I said - it still compromised so thoroughly that the message rang kind of hollow. It wasn't much of a movie, but there was at least the claim of a sweet conventional morality to it. The second one was pretty much more of the same.Still, average to weak as they were, they were Citizen Kane compared to American Pie 3, which is made with the lowest level of technical proficiency I've seen on the big screen in a long while.In this chapter, which we've been told  - thank the powers above for small blessings - will be the final one, Jim (Jason Biggs) and his longtime girlfriend Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have decided to get married. Of course hilarity ensues even during the proposal which Jim fudges so completely that Michelle thinks he's requesting an embarrassing sexual favour in public. Jim's buddies Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) are willing to help on hand to help with the arrangments, but despite their best efforts they can't keep the obnoxious Steve ""Stifmeister"" Stifler (Seann William Scott) out of the picture. He's the one who - even more than the rest - has only one thing on his mind,Both Finch and Stiffler find themselves in even more conflict when Michelle's younger sister, Cadence (January Jones), turns up, and they are both interested in her.So, the scene is set. The movie has a lot to play with. After all, so many things can go wrong in the run up to a wedding, and there's always that old fall back of the disastrous bachelor party and losing the ring. Written by Adam Herz - you should know who to blame - American Pie 3 does every predictable thing you can think of but does most of them so badly that you hardly notice.Director Jesse Dylan appears unable to direct, his cinematographer Lloyd Ahern II, appears unable to light, and editor Stuart Pappe appears to have two hands full of thumbs. And no sense of rhythm. If you doubt my comments on the cinematography and you are unfortunate enough to see this film, look particularly at the lighting in the car scenes, where a huge light seems to be hidden just under the dashboard. If you want to check out why I say the editing is so bad, just watch a dance scene in a gay bar where Stiffler struts his stuff to outdance a gay dancer. It's about as badly filmed and edited as you can possibly imagine such a sequence being.I am a great fan of Allyson Hannigan, who I liked a lot as Willow in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, but she's wasted here, and you spend a lot of time feeling sorry for her - in the relatively brief sequences she's on screen.  Seann William Scott has been much better than this, even in the awful Bulletproof Monk. And in Evolution. Here he mugs so excruciatingly at times you wonder whether the director is really this bad or whether Scott's doing it to get back at him for something. Eugene Levy as Jim's dad has a couple of good scenes, but it's all repetition from the earlier films.And of course there's the gross out stuff. The pie of the first movie becomes an engagement cake, a dog licks someone's crotch, dog excrement gets mistaken for chocolate truffle, pubic hair ends up all over a wedding cake, and of course there are numerous scenes where dubious sexual activity, or actions mistaken for dubious sexual activity take place. It's all like an update of the old - and even then tiresome - Brian Rix farces that used to grace the English stage.",1,Can I give it minus 5?,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,4301,"['were', 'concept', 'talent', 'justice', 'Hollywood', 'Jesse', 'Dylan', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'direct', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'lived', 'watched', 'film', 'expectations', 'set', 'as', 'low', 'could', 'possibly', 'set', 'amazingly', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'worse.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies', 'third', 'are', 'series', 'comedies', 'want', 'have', 'American', 'Pie', 'eat', 'opting', 'trying', 'gross', 'out', 'then', 'claiming', 'kind', 'cloying', 'moral', 'message', 'end', 'kids', 'are', 'desperate', 'sex', 'course', 'end', 'always', 'do', 'see', 'more', 'life', 'sex.And', 'naturally', 'films', 'have', 'cop', 'out', 'anyway', 'satisfy', 'what', 'see', 'hormonally', 'challenged', 'teen', 'target', 'audience', 'get', 'sex', 'well.The', 'first', 'films', 'did', 'surprise', 'little', 'eventual', 'maturity', 'message', 'even', 'though', 'said', 'still', 'compromised', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'message', 'rang', 'kind', 'hollow', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'there', 'was', 'least', 'claim', 'sweet', 'conventional', 'morality', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'more', 'same.Still', 'average', 'weak', 'were', 'were', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'compared', 'American', 'Pie', '3', 'made', 'lowest', 'level', 'technical', 'proficiency', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'long', 'while.In', 'chapter', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'thank', 'powers', 'small', 'blessings', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'one', 'Jim', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Michelle', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'have', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'course', 'hilarity', 'even', 'proposal', 'Jim', 'so', 'completely', 'Michelle', 'requesting', 'embarrassing', 'sexual', 'favour', 'public', 'Jim', 'buddies', 'Finch', 'Eddie', 'Kaye', 'Thomas', 'Kevin', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'are', 'willing', 'help', 'hand', 'help', 'arrangments', 'best', 'efforts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'obnoxious', 'Steve', 'Stifmeister', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'picture', 'one', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'rest', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'Both', 'Finch', 'Stiffler', 'find', 'even', 'more', 'conflict', 'when', 'Michelle', 'younger', 'sister', 'Cadence', 'January', 'Jones', 'up', 'are', 'interested', 'her.So', 'scene', 'set', 'movie', 'lot', 'play', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'run', 'up', 'wedding', 'always', 'old', 'fall', 'back', 'disastrous', 'bachelor', 'party', 'losing', 'ring', 'Written', 'Adam', 'Herz', 'should', 'know', 'who', 'blame', 'American', 'Pie', '3', 'predictable', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'most', 'so', 'badly', 'hardly', 'notice.Director', 'Jesse', 'Dylan', 'unable', 'direct', 'cinematographer', 'Lloyd', 'Ahern', 'II', 'unable', 'light', 'editor', 'Stuart', 'Pappe', 'have', 'two', 'hands', 'full', 'thumbs', 'sense', 'rhythm', 'doubt', 'comments', 'cinematography', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'look', 'particularly', 'lighting', 'car', 'scenes', 'where', 'huge', 'light', 'be', 'hidden', 'just', 'dashboard', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'why', 'say', 'editing', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'watch', 'dance', 'scene', 'gay', 'bar', 'where', 'Stiffler', 'stuff', 'outdance', 'gay', 'dancer', 'as', 'badly', 'filmed', 'edited', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'sequence', 'being.I', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'Allyson', 'Hannigan', 'who', 'liked', 'lot', 'Willow', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'TV', 'series', 'wasted', 'here', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'relatively', 'brief', 'sequences', 'screen', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'even', 'awful', 'Bulletproof', 'Monk', 'Evolution', 'Here', 'so', 'excruciatingly', 'times', 'wonder', 'director', 'really', 'bad', 'Scott', 'doing', 'get', 'back', 'something', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Jim', 'dad', 'couple', 'good', 'scenes', 'repetition', 'earlier', 'films.And', 'course', 'gross', 'out', 'stuff', 'pie', 'first', 'movie', 'engagement', 'cake', 'dog', 'someone', 'crotch', 'dog', 'excrement', 'mistaken', 'chocolate', 'truffle', 'pubic', 'hair', 'up', 'wedding', 'cake', 'course', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'where', 'dubious', 'sexual', 'activity', 'actions', 'mistaken', 'dubious', 'sexual', 'activity', 'take', 'place', 'update', 'old', 'even', 'then', 'tiresome', 'Brian', 'Rix', 'used', 'grace', 'English', 'stage']",American Wedding
616551,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMCT,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Riding a runaway train downhill, this mess of a third outing suffers from a seemingly rushed production and lazy setup that found half of the original cast missing (why bother?) and helplessly regurgitated jokes that didn't work that well the first time and certainly don't work that well the third.  The problem is that nothing feels fresh or new and everything is laced with this overwhelming feeling of desperation.  This is coming from someone who still enjoys the original `American Pie', despite it losing its effect upon subsequent viewings (it is one of those films that is never as funny the second time around, which is odd).  The cast is bored with this, even Seann William Scott (who I firmly believe should have been considered for a Supporting Actor nomination back in 1999) and the plot points just never exceed past the moderately low bar set by the second film (which was better than this but leagues below the original).  All the obvious wedding humor is used, and a slew of gags feel like lazy rip offs of jokes used in the first and second installments.

616552,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JMCT,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[4, 5]","I must say that while I am very satisfied with how they ended this series, I am a little sad to see Jim (Jason Biggs), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), and the gang leaving. Unlike most teen movies, the American Pie series actually gets you to care for the characters.  I feel a slight connection to these characters. For example, I want to see Michelle again. The character, who has grown from a mere punch line into a frontman, is hilarious not to mention beautiful. When I heard that Alyson Hannigan was getting married in real life, I was a little sad (darn you Alexis Denisof), but it's not like I have a chance or anything. Also, Jim and Michelle are, in this way only, like my parents: my mom is Irish Roman-Catholic while my father is Jewish. Anyway, the movie follows the continuing exploits of Jim and Michelle before their wedding. They want the wedding to be perfect so they naturally choose NOT to invite Stifler (Seann William Scott), but he eventually is able to wrangle himself into the ceremony. Like Michelle, Stifler has grown in importance. In the first movie, he was a supporting character; he wasn't part of the group or the pact. In the second movie, the gang didn't want him at the beach house, but they needed him. In this one, they don't want him at the wedding, but he actually is the unofficial star of the movie. He and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are both vying for Michelle's hot (but nowhere near as beautiful as Alyson) Cadence (January Jones) and they actually switch personalities; Stifler becomes cultured and polite (only in front of the Flaherty family) while Finch becomes the rude ""Finchmeister"". Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) doesn't have much to do besides add a little support to Jim. The film could have been done without him. I'm not saying that it should have been done without him, I'm just saying that it could have. I wanted the entire gang back, but I'll elaborate later. Meanwhile, Jim is trying hard to impress Michelle's parents while Michelle struggles to write her vows. As usual, laughs are inevitable while the characters struggle to achieve their separate goals: there is Stifler with the bachelor party, Jim and his nervousness, Michelle's dirty nature, and Finch's strange knowledge. If you liked the first two movies, you owe it to yourself to see ""The Thrilling Climax"". However, not everyone in the group decided to be a part of that climax. The one that I'm most surprised about is Oz (Chris Klein). He was part of the main group, something that Stifler was not. He was one of Jim's best friends and he wasn't even mentioned throughout the film. Also, he is a good counter-balance to Stifler: they are both popular jocks, but Oz is sensitive while Stifler is crass. Now if you have Oz, you have to have Heather. After all, the two are in love. If Heather was cut first, I can see why Oz wasn't there, but I don't understand why anyone was cut. Next is Vicky and Jessica. They are a pair, and while Vicky wouldn't have too much to do, Jessica (who would have Vicky with her for the ride) would be able to give advice to Jim and Michelle. Finally, there is Nadia, the only member of the lost gang who was even mentioned. I can understand why she was cut the most, however, she could have created some conflict for the two lovebirds. Before I wrap up this review, I must say this: be warned: there is a scene in this movie so disgusting that I almost threw up in the theater. I have never in my life come that close to barfing due to a movie in my life. So in conclusion,... It's like Michelle says in American Pie 2; you can't be too uptight. It causes problems.

616553,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00005JMCT,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[1, 1]","Keep in mind that the title of my review and my rating of the film is not saying that this film, the third and final in the ""American Pie"" trilogy"", has nothing wrong with it. There are quite a few flaws. For starters, where the heck's the cast?Jim, Alyson, Stifler, Kevin, Jim's dad and Finch return to the fold, but wihtout Vicky, Stifler's brother (who admittedly had a very small part but was hysterical when shown), Jessica, Oz, Heather, the Sherminator and especially Nadia (although her and Vicky are both referenced to at one point), the film does feel a little half baked at times.This one major qualm aside, ""American Pie"" otherwise measures up to the first two films in the series. I do agree with the many reviewers who said the film beloned to Sean William Scott. But unlike those reviewers, I look at this in a positive way, since his character Stifler provided us with such classic moments in the first two. I mean, who else could've done the pale ale scene so well in part one?In this film, Jim (Biggs) is finally ready to pop the question to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). She accepts, and things soon go haywire, and provide more classic moments to this already classic trilogy, including Stifler's dance off at a gay bar, that special haircut, and the bachelor party from hell. And since it's the unrated version, the bachelor party is even hotter.The extras are extremely intriguing. I haven't watched them all yet, but I'm sure they will be when I find the time.In conclusion, despite the cast being absent, this a truly great finale for this classic trilogy of teen sex comedies. Please, buy it as soon as possible (that is, after you see the first two).",5,"Don't Believe The Bad Reviews, This Film As Funny As 1 & 2",1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,1673,"['Keep', 'mind', 'title', 'review', 'rating', 'film', 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'third', 'final', 'American', 'Pie', 'trilogy', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'flaws', 'starters', 'where', 'heck', 'cast', 'Jim', 'Alyson', 'Stifler', 'Kevin', 'Jim', 'dad', 'Finch', 'return', 'fold', 'Vicky', 'Stifler', 'brother', 'who', 'admittedly', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'was', 'hysterical', 'when', 'shown', 'Jessica', 'Oz', 'Heather', 'Sherminator', 'especially', 'Nadia', 'Vicky', 'are', 'referenced', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'feel', 'little', 'half', 'baked', 'times.This', 'one', 'major', 'qualm', 'aside', 'American', 'Pie', 'otherwise', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'do', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'film', 'beloned', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'reviewers', 'look', 'positive', 'way', 'character', 'Stifler', 'provided', 'such', 'classic', 'moments', 'first', 'two', 'mean', 'who', 'else', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'pale', 'ale', 'scene', 'so', 'well', 'part', 'one', 'film', 'Jim', 'Biggs', 'finally', 'ready', 'pop', 'question', 'Michelle', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'things', 'soon', 'go', 'haywire', 'provide', 'more', 'classic', 'moments', 'already', 'classic', 'trilogy', 'including', 'Stifler', 'dance', 'off', 'gay', 'bar', 'special', 'haircut', 'bachelor', 'party', 'hell', 'unrated', 'version', 'bachelor', 'party', 'even', 'hotter.The', 'extras', 'are', 'extremely', 'intriguing', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'when', 'find', 'time.In', 'conclusion', 'cast', 'being', 'absent', 'truly', 'great', 'finale', 'classic', 'trilogy', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedies', 'Please', 'buy', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'see', 'first', 'two']",American Wedding
616554,A200C7YQJ45LRR,B00005JMCT,"Anthony Rupert ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!!""","[2, 3]","The interesting thing I noticed about the reviews for this movie is that every review literally has a completely different opinion of it, regardless of how they rated it. Basically, I liked the original American Pie, and I thought American Pie 2 was even better. THIS movie was okay, but I think only people that are really, REALLY into the first two movies can appreciate it.Jim has been dating Michelle for years, and he finally asks her for her hand in marriage, which she accepts. Eventually, Stifler decides to throw Jim a bachelor party, along with Jim's usual friends Kevin, Finch, and Oz -- wait, Oz isn't there. He wasn't even mentioned in the whole movie! What's up with that?I read somewhere that someone said this movie should have been called The Steve Stifler Show. I totally see where that reviewer is coming from (especially since Seann William Scott got higher billing than Alyson Hannigan). Yeah, Stifler WAS the funniest character in the first two movies, but in comparing those movies to THIS one, it seems like the antics and situations he was in have gone from funny and dumb to just dumb -- well, during the first half of the movie, anyway. And you have to admit that the scene in the gay bar wasn't 100% necessary.To me, the only character that was completely funny throughout the whole movie was Jim's dad (I have yet to see Eugene Levy on screen when he isn't extremely funny). The DVD extras weren't all that, either (but are they ever?) The ""Enter the Dominatrix"" thing was really kind of pointless, and  the ""Stifler Speak"" segment (starring...who else?) really makes you start to wonder just whose movie this is. All in all, though, while not a total waste of time, I'm glad I only rented this movie. But if you already own the other two movies, you might as well add this one to your collection. American Wedding really helped make 2002 the year of Sequels That Nobody Went to See along with Legally Blonde 2 and Analyze That.Anthony RupertP.S.

616555,A13T9FCU0J1GO5,B00005JMCT,Anthony Sunclades,"[0, 2]","This series was a goldmine for Universal.  No one expected a raunchy story about high school kids trying to get laid to spawn and a franchise and make $350 million in US box office.  The first film is a classic high school movie.  The sequel was good, and funny, but hampered by too many characters and too many storylines.  This one goes back more towards the original, with a few main characters and the rest just fading into the background.  Some addition by subtraction in this movie are the removal of the following characters, Oz, Nadia, and Oz's and Kevin's girlfriends.  See, some of those characters were so useless that I cannot even remember their names.  As usual you get the shot of Jim's dad catching Jim in an embarrassing situation and you have something gross happen to Stiffler.  One of the major flaws is the early incarnation of Stiffler.  At the beginning he is a loudmouth who comes off more as nerd, than jerk.  It takes a few scenes for Stiffler to resort back to being a jerk, the Stiffler that we know and love.  In the end this film draws on the sweetness that made the first two more than gross our comedies.  This is a funny film that, the second time around loses its luster, so this is not really built for repeat viewings.About the DVD:  Included on the DVD are deleted scenes.  There is a rather useless documentary on Stiffler speak and a &quot;Cheesy Wedding Video&quot; which is just that, cheesy.  One thing to take from this film is that Stiffler, is best suited as a background character, not as a main character.T",3,Better than the second one ...,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,1553,"['series', 'was', 'goldmine', 'Universal', 'one', 'expected', 'raunchy', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'trying', 'get', 'laid', 'spawn', 'franchise', 'make', '350', 'million', 'US', 'box', 'office', 'first', 'film', 'classic', 'high', 'school', 'movie', 'sequel', 'was', 'good', 'funny', 'hampered', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'storylines', 'one', 'back', 'more', 'towards', 'original', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'rest', 'just', 'fading', 'background', 'addition', 'subtraction', 'movie', 'are', 'removal', 'following', 'characters', 'Oz', 'Nadia', 'Oz', 'Kevin', 'girlfriends', 'See', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'useless', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'remember', 'names', 'usual', 'get', 'shot', 'Jim', 'dad', 'catching', 'Jim', 'embarrassing', 'situation', 'have', 'something', 'gross', 'happen', 'Stiffler', 'One', 'major', 'flaws', 'early', 'incarnation', 'Stiffler', 'beginning', 'loudmouth', 'who', 'off', 'more', 'nerd', 'jerk', 'few', 'scenes', 'Stiffler', 'resort', 'back', 'being', 'jerk', 'Stiffler', 'know', 'love', 'end', 'film', 'sweetness', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'more', 'gross', 'comedies', 'funny', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'luster', 'not', 'really', 'built', 'repeat', 'DVD', 'Included', 'DVD', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'rather', 'useless', 'documentary', 'Stiffler', 'speak', 'quot', 'Cheesy', 'Wedding', 'Video', 'quot', 'just', 'cheesy', 'One', 'thing', 'take', 'film', 'Stiffler', 'best', 'suited', 'background', 'character', 'not', 'main', 'character.T']",American Wedding

Well, welcome to ""American Wedding"". I'm not gonna say that this doesn't deserve to be in the 'Pie' series, or that it isn't good or enjoyable, because it most definitley is, but there is something missing. I was worried right off the bat when I heard that half the cast, Chris Klein As Oz, Shannon Elizabeth As Nadia, Tara Reid As Vicky, Mena Suvari as Heather, and Natasha Lyonne as Francesca, would be absent from the film. Not only that, but the director's previous comedy was some embarrasing pot comedy. The abscene of the cast is definitley felt, and it's a hard feeling to shed while watching the movie. As the movies have dealt with the progression of relationships and friendships, I guess it is uunderstandable that some friends don't always stay together once they have graduated into adulthood. It happens. Our hero Jim(Jason Biggs), is finally ready to pop the question to band geek/girlfriend Michelle(the adorable Alyson Hannigan), and does so in the film's hilarious opening teaser that stays true to the series' popular, and now famous, opening moments. Jim's best buds Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), are also around, as everyone prepares from the upcoming nuptials. All isn't merry when perennial jock head Stifler(Sean William Scott), stumbles back onto the scene and causes more chaos for the duo as the wedding nears.  Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad, and he has, thankfully, a larger role here. We even see more of Jim's mom!. Newcomers to the series include funnyman Fred Willard as Michelle's father, and beautiful January Jones as Cadence, Michelle's younger sister. Anyone who is worried that the nice, romantic wedding storyline will overshadow the raunch and comedy of the previous two films, will be happy to know that the raunch, sex, nudity, and everything else is still predoominant in the film. It isn't as raunchy as part 2, but it definitley delivers. Scott, as Stifler, is practically the star of the movie, as it seems that the movie focuses a lot more on him than on Jim and Michelle. Sean seems to overdo Stifler way too much this time. It is evident right from the start that he going overboard, and it appears that it isn't so much a Stifler performance, than a Stifler caricature, as so many others have said. Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin, must of had nothing else to do. Why else would he appear in a film that barely registers that he's there?. His role is so transparent, that I can't figure out what they were trying to do with him. The direction of the film is a bit off too. There seems to be scenes that might of gone on longer, but were obviously cut short. Some shots cut away to something real quickly and is given the impression that there was more there. Jesse Dylan, the director and, Bob's son, didn't seem to be a great choice, and his work shows that someone else would of been better. The heart of the first film isn't as well done here either. It was a tad shakey in the sequel too, but there's more here than in 2. The acting is as solid and believeable, minus Stifler, as it always has been. I still believe Hannigan to be a wonder. She has come a long way from that flute tuting band dork from the original. Biggs is still a likeable hero, because he is an every-guy type of person. And Levy, well, Levy is just a god. The film is filled with some definite laugh out loud moments, and some nice scene with Jim and Michelle, but it didn't quite hit the bullseye like the original. Part 2 was better, because it felt more like a 'Pie' film. Namely because everyone was there. The raunch is there, the comedy is there, and the sweetness is felt more than the sequel. It's not great art, but it isn't trying to be. This is for the fans and for the people who enjoy these movies. They really won't be disappointed, even though it isn't the same.

I have noticed that American wedding has recieved alot of bad reviews, I really do not know why.  This was a great ending to the series.  Many of the jokes were original and hilarious (There was a scene where Steve Stifler literally ate dog crap, sure it was gross but it was funny as hell) plus the bachelor party was hot!!!!  Plus I really love the fact that Steve Stifler had a major part in the movie when originally he was just a co-character in the first American Pie.  He had to be everybody's favorite charcter of the series because of the way he behave and all he ever thinks about is getting laid. In this film, he is more perverted then ever.

Even though his attempt to propose to her in the perfect way ends up going horribly wrong, Michelle says yes!  So now it is time to plan a wedding which means they have to do the usual things- Find a dress, decide where to get married, and meet the new relatives.  Jim and his friends (Stifler, Finch, and Kevin) try to do whatever the can to help without getting into trouble or end up getting into sexual situations.  Stifler is only being part of the wedding because Jim said he can plan his bachelor party.  Plus things start to become very interesting when Stifler and Finch both meet Michelle's very attractive sister Cadence and both try to compete for her affection.  Stifler starts to suck up to Candence's parents and behaves like Finch only on front of them and Candence.  That prompts Finch to start behaving like Stifler, he starts calling himself the ""Finchmeister"".  Ironically she like both of their acts.In general, American Wedding was one flat out hilarious movie.  A Perfect way to end the series.  The only thing I hated was the absence of many of the characters like Nadia, Oz, Vicky, Heather , and Sherman.  There was one scene where Stifler mentioned Nadia but that was it.  It would have been nice to see them.  Other then that I really loved this movie and anybody who wants to laugh should see this film.",5,This is Awesome!,1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,2260,"['3', 'films', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'are', 'hilarious', 'are', '5', 'star', 'worthy', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'one', 'weakest', 'series', 'have', 'noticed', 'American', 'wedding', 'recieved', 'alot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'great', 'ending', 'series', 'Many', 'jokes', 'were', 'original', 'hilarious', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'literally', 'ate', 'dog', 'crap', 'sure', 'was', 'gross', 'was', 'funny', 'hell', 'bachelor', 'party', 'was', 'hot', 'really', 'love', 'fact', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'had', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'originally', 'was', 'just', 'co-character', 'first', 'American', 'Pie', 'had', 'be', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'charcter', 'series', 'way', 'behave', 'ever', 'getting', 'laid', 'film', 'more', 'perverted', 'then', 'ever', 'Anyway', 'here', 'plot.After', 'dating', 'Michelle', 'years', 'Jim', 'time', 'pop', 'question', 'Even', 'attempt', 'propose', 'perfect', 'way', 'up', 'going', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Michelle', 'yes', 'So', 'now', 'time', 'plan', 'wedding', 'have', 'do', 'usual', 'things-', 'Find', 'dress', 'decide', 'where', 'get', 'married', 'meet', 'new', 'relatives', 'Jim', 'friends', 'Stifler', 'Finch', 'Kevin', 'try', 'do', 'whatever', 'can', 'help', 'getting', 'trouble', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'sexual', 'situations', 'Stifler', 'only', 'being', 'part', 'wedding', 'Jim', 'said', 'can', 'plan', 'bachelor', 'party', 'things', 'start', 'become', 'very', 'interesting', 'when', 'Stifler', 'Finch', 'meet', 'Michelle', 'very', 'attractive', 'sister', 'Cadence', 'try', 'compete', 'affection', 'Stifler', 'suck', 'up', 'Candence', 'parents', 'behaves', 'Finch', 'only', 'front', 'Candence', 'Finch', 'start', 'behaving', 'Stifler', 'calling', 'Finchmeister', 'Ironically', 'acts.In', 'general', 'American', 'Wedding', 'was', 'one', 'flat', 'out', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'Perfect', 'way', 'end', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'hated', 'was', 'absence', 'many', 'characters', 'Nadia', 'Oz', 'Vicky', 'Heather', 'Sherman', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Stifler', 'mentioned', 'Nadia', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'Other', 'then', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'anybody', 'who', 'laugh', 'should', 'see', 'film']",American Wedding

Which was a huge part of the success of American Pie. It was SEXY and FUNNY! We had a handful of beautiful girls and guys in REALISTIC, funny and SEXY moments.American Wedding on the other hand, has NONE of that. Stiffler (Scott) pretends to be somebody else in order to beat out Finch (Thomas) and get into Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) sister Cadence's (the very attractive January Jones) pants. This story line takes up about 70% of the movie and nobody actually does. It's like telling a story an entire movie and never delivering with the punchline. Instead we end up with a sex scene with Grandma.The American Pie movies have made a lot of money for their studio. You'd think that they'd have the green light to do WHATEVER they wanted... and they did!Well, they chose to use that power to do jokes typical of JACKASS like eating dog poo, dancing in gay bars, having sex with grandma, humping dogs and shaving pubic hair.Me personally, I would have rather seen the sexiness brought back. Bottom line. American Wedding ISN'T sexy. It's mostly GROSS with some laughs. In fact, on the DVD, the Director even says that the studio recommended they add something to make it sexier. Preferably with Cadence, and they didn't.The unrated version does feature an extended bachelor party. It isn't that big of deal. Would have rather seen Cadence do something MILDLY sexy.

While not quite as good as the first two Pie films, American Wedding does have it's good points and does continue to make us laugh.  The bad thing is that none of the orininal girls are here except for Alyson Hannigan and even though the guys are back, Chris Kline is missing...oh wait, that's not so bad.  Anyways, this movie is really more about Stifler (William Scott) and Finch (Kaye Thomas) than really anyone else.  I mean, the film is about Jim (Biggs) and Michelle (Hannigan) getting married, Jim trying to impress her uptight parents (played brilliantly by Fred Willard and Deborah Rush) while trying to keep Stifler under control.  The real story though is Stifler's efforts to woo Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) upon finding out she's still a virgin.  The problem is Finch is also trying to woo her as well.  Of course things go bad, people's feelings get hurt, the wedding gets jepordized as does Stifler's friendship with the gang.  The funny scenes mostly include crude humor and sex related antics, and of course there are beautiful strippers (Amanda Swisten & Nikki Schieler Ziering)...but the funniest part happens in a gay bar when Stifler has a dance off against Bear (Eric Allen Kramer) which is just drop dead hilarious!  It's almost as good if not better than the dance off in 'Starsky & Hutch'...and it's makes this movie stand out a bit from being just another random sex-comedy.  Yes, the American Pie series is over (well, 'Bandcamp' was released straight to video but I'm not sure too many people cared to see it...I mean, Eugene Levy was in it, but I don't even think he could have been enough of a draw) but it ended with a decent bang, not an explosion, but more than a pop.

I was amazed, when American Pie 2 was released, the film makers actually managed to capture lightning in a bottle twice. I guess three times was entirely too much to hope for. The major problem with American Wedding versus American Pie and American Pie 2: there's a LOT more Stifler in it. Chris Klein has not returned as Oz. This is bad. It completely scotches the special magic of the series as the unfolding story of four friends (and one jerk) who meet once a year, no matter what, as their lives progress. Because they're just that important to each other. I'm morally certain that many scenes and plot elements originally intended for Oz were given to Stifler instead. Unfortunately, Stifler himself is not that interesting. He's irritating and repellant, actually. Light comic relief as a supporting character, sure, lovely. Carrying the movie on his shoulders, no.Again, as with American Pie 2, the relationship between Finch and Stifler's mother is relegated to a few brief moments at the end of the movie. Jennifer Coolidge who plays Stifler's mom has put on quite a bit of weight since the first film - it shows in her face and she's typically shot from the clavicle up - which severely limits what they can do with her. It's too bad really. The most complex, intense, potentially interesting and humorous relationship in the series is condemned to a few minutes worth of footage per film. And that little bit of Finch and Stifler's mother is the best thing in American Wedding, earning two stars all on its lonesome. The rest of the movie is a waste.

616582,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00005JMCT,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[1, 2]","""American Wedding"" was not as good as many people said it was. It was basically just the same old story. It was also ridden with gross humor, profanity, and crude humor. I'm not saying that those are bad thing, but it just didn't work in this film. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a good one. I have mixed thoughts on this one. ""American Wedding"" is part three in the American Pie movie seris, but it was weak. It didn't have the entire same cast, and most of the laughs come from Eugene Levy, who is the hilarious guy from ""Bringing Down the House."" He reprises his role from the previous films, and he is most of the comedy in the movie.When the film starts, we see main character Jim, and his girlfriend Michelle. They have known each other for several years, and Jim proposes fresh out of collage, and she says ""yes."" Jim's parents are thrilled that their son is finally getting married. Jim's first problem is that he has to decide from his two best friends, Finch and Kevin, which one is going to be his best man. They both know that it is not going to be Stifler, a person who went to high school with them, and who is not liked by everyone else. Jim and Michelle don't even invite him to the wedding, for fear that his continuious profanity, and rude ways would ruin the event. But Stifler somehow gets Jim's parents to invite him to the wedding, and finally Jim allows him to plan the bachlor party. Michelle's parents Harold and Mary arive, as does her sister Candence, who both Finch and Stifer both set their eyes on. All in all, everybody is excited about the event, except Jim's grandmother who objects to the wedding because of Michelle not being Jewish, but the main thing on Jim and Michelle's mind is that they could get married without a hitch.A main problem with ""American Wedding"" is that Stifler was unjustifly mean. It seemed that the only reason for him being in the movie is for him to ruin the wedding. There were a few funny parts in the movie-for example the scenes where Jim tries to learn how to dance for his wedding, or some of the things Stifler does throughout the film. Take this one scene where Stifler lost the best man ring when the dog eats it. He waits for it to come out of the other end, but when he goes off to clean it, somebody else mistakes it for some kind of a chocolate candy. I'm sure you could picture the rest. It was gross, but it was funny. ""American Wedding"" cannot be called a classic, but I guess it is worth the hour and a half that it takes.

616583,AKZMP6OOE89GV,B00005JMCT,Elite14,"[3, 4]","Why must hollywood ruin everything? This is the final chapter in the American Pie movies &amp; that's a good thing. Part of the problem with the last two 'Pie' movies is that there isn't much original material. They all follow the same formula: Humilate Jason Biggs, Stifler is the comedy &amp; also does something disgusting (ex. eat dog poop), Finch &amp; Stifler's mom, Jim's talks with his dad, &amp; some blatent nudity scenes that don't need to be there.The original was new, fresh, and a genius of a movie. This one is just awful. If you like Stifler, however, this is your movie. Don't get me wrong, I think he's hilarious at times. The other two films gave you his humor in doses. In this flick he is given free reign and he is sometimes irritating. I mean what 23 year old is still going to act like that? Honestly, I don't care about the marriage. You never get a romantic feel from the little chemistry Jason Biggs &amp; Alyson Hannigan have. I don't even know why Thomas Ian Nichols is in this movie. He doesn't have much to do here. Eddie Kaye is back as Finch. Even his character is getting old. And if I have to hear about him &amp; Stifler's mom again, I am going to throw up. Even the bachelor party (a.k.a. the nudity) felt forced. Does Jim only have three friends in his life? And the 'relationship' between Stifler and Michelle's sister is idiotic. There is NO WAY that a girl would go out with him after he treats her like he does in this movie. But, welcome to hollywood.The movie is not a total loss, though. Jim's dad is back and as funny as ever. Stifler does have some really funny moments. His attempt at wooing Michelle's sister are quite funny. January Jones is incredibly hot. And that's about it.The only reason I bought this movie was because I wanted the trilogy. I think it's the worst of the three, by far. I wasn't all that crazy about part two either, but at least it FELT like an American Pie movie. It had all of the characters (even though some were just there for show), &amp; it had some funny moments for the other characters. This film is all about Stifler &amp; it falls flat. It should have never been made in the first place. I can't recommend this movie for more than a rental.Even the special features are somewhat disappointing.

If you enjoyed watching these kids grow up in the previous two ""Pies"", I guarantee you'll definitely be entertained by the final installment. I didn't really expect much because sequels usually aren't as great as their predecessors, but I ended up enjoying this one anyway. I found myself (and the entire crowd) laughing at most of the scenes, laughing so hard that it would be difficult to hear what they were saying during most scenes. Most of the comedy is pretty gross and sexual, which surprised me as to seeing many children under 15 with their parents/guardians were watching this movie together and actually seeing that these kids were laughing at these jokes. I would advise parents who want what's best for their children to leave them at home, or well, they'll find a way to watch it with their friends anyway.Although Jim and the gang are back, there are a few cast members missing, such as Chris Klein, Mena Suvari, and Tara Reid just to name a few, but those that decided to film the last Pie certainly made it worth my time and money. I really enjoyed this movie and I would reccommend it to anyone, as long as they're not easily offended by crude humor.

But that doesn't disregard the fact that for what the films were, they were good.They were funny in an uncomfortable way, but then again I'm sure that by now you know that.This one however was not. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the film but it wasn't very good. The characters that originally made the films watchable in the first place became old hat and stretched. They weren't the same characters anymore.Also the cinematography was extremely wierd for a comedy.In the first two the look of the films was easy going and light. This one was dressed up witha lot of colour and styalised shots. None of which is needed in a comedy film.Anyway, If your one of those people who lives for teen comedy such as this trilogy, Road trip and frankly anything starring Sean William Scott, then unfortunately you generally know nothing about film. Don't worry about it though, much of us fanatics would love to take your place so that we could like more films and criticise less.

I saw this movie after hearing great reviews from the critics and was expecting it to be the best one of them all.  I was undoubtfully wrong.  There are alot of problems with this movie that the others didn't have.  It seemed in this one the creators were trying way too hard for some cheap laughs than in the other ones where the awkward and surprising situations the characters got themselves into were the funniest.  Every character hits the mark right on in this one, except for Sean Williams Scott.  It came as a shock to me because like many others, Stifler is my favorite and most rememorable character.  But in this movie, Mr. Scott is completely overacting and Stifler therefore seems way to over the top.  So over the top that it makes you not want to watch him, more less care about him.  There are some few funny scenes in the movie.  The most funniest are of course the most outrageous.  But between those parts it is undeniably slow.  For instance, Stifler mistakingly enters a gay bar and shows off his dancing moves.  It wasn't funny at all and seemed like a scene that should be obviously deleted to the cutting room floor and never seen again.

The movie itself I would give about 3.5 stars. American Pie 1 and 2 are better, but AW is NOT a bad movie and is still an excellent final chapter to the entire American Pie series. My qualms lie with what Universal Studios has chosen to do with the ads, and it occured with a previous Universal DVD release, Animal House.The AW DVD has some features that are cool, including deleted scenes and the Unrated version goes into why they created an unrated version. What I also like with the unrated DVD release is that you have both the theatrical release and the unrated version. I think that's an excellent marketing ploy. The extra scenes are okay, but I don't know if they are totally worth it except one part where Finch, Kevin and Stifler are asked if they would like to see the two strippers kiss. Their answer to it is hilarious and it pays a great homage to AP2.But, the one annoying thing about this DVD (as it is with the Animal House DVD) and is the only reason I gave the DVD a 1-star rating, is the commercials. Now, supposedly, unlike the Animal House DVD, you can skip the commercials. Yet, I was unable to skip them with my particular DVD player except by stopping the movie and then restarting it. This is better than my Animal House DVD, in which my only recourse was to turn off the DVD player.So, if you don't mind having the commercials thrown into your face and you haven't seen this movie, I would suggest possibly renting it first to see if you want it. I myself have already written my displeasure with Animal House and American Wedding to Universal. I have a feeling this is the route they will continue to take, which is sad as I have other Universal movies on DVD that I enjoy. However, if enough consumers write to them and complain, hopefully they will listen and change their tactics.Again, the movie is funny and great (3.5 stars), but the DVD release with the adds forced upon the viewer is what kills the rating for this release.

Although a lot of the cast from the first one didn't return, the movie is still hilarious. When you think about it, the ones that returned are the ones that made the movies so strong in the first place anyway. Okay Shannon Elizibeth isn't back and yes she is sexy but  she was awful in the last one. Chris Klein played the normal one of the gang....so who needs him lol. They should've at least mentioned his character once though since he was supposed to be their good friend.Anyway the movie would be totally pointless if Sean William Scott didn't return as Stiffler. Okay he has a little too much screen time and that laugh he does can get annoying too. However the movie smartly handles his character. He's supposed to be an annoying big mouthed jerk. That's why Jim (Jason Biggs) doesn't want him at his wedding. So Stiffler does everything he can to be part of the wedding. All that is hilarious too. We also get to see that he has a bit of a sensitive side a long the way as well.The scenes where Finch ( Eddie Kaye Thomas)  acts like Stiffler in-order to impress Michelle's sister is very funny too. Stiffler and Finch both have eyes for the same girl. Stiffler thinks he needs to act like Finch to get her and Finch thinks he needs to act like Stiffler. The result is hilarious. Lugene Levy (Jim's dad) is another strong point of the all the movies and they'd be boring without his pep talks that always embarrass Jim as well.

I don't think I stopped laughing throughout the whole thing.  Many of the film's jokes build on humorous moments from the two AMERICAN PIE movies, but that's okay.  There's loads of fun in this installment surrounding the impending wedding of the nymphomaniac ""Band Camp"" girl, Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), and the friend-to-home-baked-goods ne'er-do-well, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs).  The movie isn't so much about Jim and Michelle, though.  Seann William Scott steals the show (again?) as wild party boy Stifler, and Hannigan's character ends up being little more than a prop.  Still, the film has a heart, and there are a few touching moments (even though they might make some folk cringe a bit ;).One hilarious moment is when Stifler accidently wanders into a gay bar and sets out to prove that he's appealing even to gay men by showcasing his dance moves to a collage of 80s dance tracks!  Another great scene senters around the mis-aptly scheduled ""bachelor party.""  Once again, the AMERICAN WEDDING franchise proves that it is the modern leader in sexual/toilet humor, but manages to tell a story in such a way as the humor appears simply part of life (well, isn't it, then?)

616609,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JMCT,Joe Sherry,"[2, 3]","A Film by Jesse DylanI thought American Pie was funny.  I really didn't like American Pie 2 and thought it was mostly a waste of time.  For some reason I decided that I wanted to see the third (and presumably final) movie in this franchise: American Wedding.  Even more surprising is the fact that I enjoyed the movie and found it funny.Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) and Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan) are getting married.  Jim and Michelle first met in the first American Pie movie where Jim, unable to get a date for prom, asked band geek Michelle.  Michelle turned out to be a nympho-maniac and ended up being Jim's first sexual experience (and a one night stand).  In the second movie Jim turned to Michelle to help him gain confidence and experience with women so he could impress Nadia.  By the end of American Pie 2 Jim realized he really loved Michelle and they ended up together.  American Wedding opens with Jim proposing to Michelle and a disturbingly funny scene with Jim's father (Eugene Levy) bringing Jim the diamond ring which he forgot all the while Michelle is under the restaurant table (you can guess what she is doing).Jim's friends Kevin Meyers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are helping Jim with wedding plans so that Michelle can have the wedding of her dreams (which Jim promised).  Early on in the movie they mention that the best thing about this wedding is that Stifler (Sean William Scott) will not be there.  Of course this means that Stifler will end up crashing the party.  Initially he believes he is crashing a graduation party (Jim and friends are just graduating from college), but instead it is the engagement party.  While Jim, Kevin and Finch have matured somewhat since American Pie 2, Stifler is exactly the same foul, crude, loudmouthed guy he has been since the first movie.Instead of being the same old same old that we got from American Pie 2, American Wedding actually shows growth in the story as well as in the characters (I can't believe I just said that).  Yes, Jim is still bumbling, but he means well and truly loves Michelle and it feels like Jim has actually grown as a person.  He is more mature and willing to try to overcome his limitations as a person.  Kevin is not much more than window dressing and a familiar face.  Finch is finch, but it feels like he fits in with the group a lot more.  Amazingly enough, Steve Stifler grows the most as a character.  Stifler starts out as loud and obnoxious, but throughout the movie he starts to think more of others (in a Stifler sort of way) and tries to do the right thing.  He backslides and takes steps forwards, and in the end is a better person than when he started in the movie.Yes, there is some of the gross out humor that was such a big part of the first two movies, but there is less of it.  There are a couple of scenes that fit perfectly into the other movies as a gross out scene, but as a whole, American Wedding is less crude than American Pie or American Pie 2.  The focus truly is on relationships: the friendship of Jim, Kevin, and Finch; the family relationships of the Levinsteins and the Flaherty's; Jim and Michelle; Stifler trying to get with Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones); Stifler trying to be a better friend.  The story is told with a lot of humor and some crudeness, but ultimately American Wedding is a gentler movie than either of the American Pie movies.Oddly enough, there was no mention of the missing characters.  While it was appropriate that the women (except for Michelle) were not in the movie (they were pretty much all ex-girlfriends and former lust interests, there was no mention of Oz.  Oz was part of Jim's circle of friends and while after three years of college friends do drift apart, you would think that Oz would merit a throwaway line for continuity's sake.  After all, the movie did reference Nadia.  This isn't something that should bother anyone during the movie, but it was something that I thought of after the movie was over.Note: There is quite a bit of foul language, sexual humor, gross out humor, and other stuff that would be inappropriate for younger viewers or other viewers.

Now, they are all grown up and they all have their own jobs and are going to other schools. Jim then announces that he is planning to marry Michelle and then the gang comes together for the very last time, with the exception of Stifler. Stifler doesn't know that he isn't invited and goes around having the thought that he is involved in the wedding. Jim cannot have the words to tell him that Stifler actually ends up saving the wedding in spots and becomes a unlikely hero and the book closes on the American Pie saga.When I first heard that there was going to be a third American Pie, I had high expectations. My expectations were met with this hilarous film that closes out the film triliogy. But, I was suprised that the gang was cut in half and alot of the original cast didn't return for the third one. But, they managed to keep the best parts about the films. I thought that it was solid comedy at its best. It is dirtier, filthier, and full of cuss words. It's what made it very good.Sean Willam Scott basically carried the whole film on his shoulders and made the most laughs in the film. His character basically stole every scene that he was in. He made me and everbody laugh uproariously. Stifler was given the whole movie to shine and he took that chance and made one of the most hilarous comedic performances in recent history. He can really carry a film but was never given a chance to, up until now.In closing, American Pie has made us laugh with the famous Jim having intercourse with the pie and having sex for the first time. The third film closes out the series with a bang and makes us rememeber what it was all about all the way to the first film.I had a wonderful time watching these films and I hope you had one magical time with the American Pie saga.

Something about focusing the entire movie and Stifler just threw the chemistry off. Jim was the viewpoint character in the first two flicks but Seann William Scotts popularity had eclipsed that of Jason Biggs and thusly he dominated the movie at the expense of the other characters.Scott is fun to watch but you can't take an ensemble series and turn it into a one man show which is what they did so it didn't entirely work. When they worked the rest of the cast in the movie excelled. It was really the overemphasis on Stifler that really dragged the movie down and I consider myself a Stifler fan.

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","You cannot accuse ""American Wedding"" of false advertising on the basis of the cover of the DVD, because the character of Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) is featured prominently, right in the center.  Yes, it is rather amazing how the joke character from the original ""American Pie"" has taken over the series, and pretty much every memorable moment in this 2003 film belongs to Stifler.  But I am a fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and so I want to point out to director Jesse Dylan that he has Allyson Hannigan in this movie and why not take advantage of that fact and give her some good scenes?  After all, this is the actress who had the two biggest lines in the original ""American Pie"" (the second of which was ad-libbed).  But you can make the same argument for Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, and most of the cast in this one (and why is Thomas Ian Nicholas even back as Kevin?  He has nothing to do in this film).The title is pretty much the plot of this film, as Jim (Biggs) proposes to Michelle (Hannigan), under the traditionally embarrassing situation we have come to expect from every major moment in Jim's life.  Michelle wants the perfect wedding and Jim promises her one, which means learning to dance.  Michelle's parents show up when Jim is having another one of his embarrassing situations, which means he has to redeem himself.  But the person who most needs redemption is Stifler, who is not invited to the wedding and does not deal well with rejection.  However, even the upcoming nuptials take a back seat when Stifler meets Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones) and tries to act like a human being in order to seduce her.  Meanwhile, Finch (Eddie Haye Thomas) is impressing Cadence by acting like Stifler and we are have totally jumped through the looking glass, boys and girls.Consequently, in ""American Wedding"" Stifler reaches hitherto unsuspected heights as he starts thinking with totally different body parts than is his standard operating procedure.  It is totally appropriate, given all the horrible things that have happened to Stifler in the previous films, that in this one he does the worst one yet, to himself, and on purpose.  You have to stop and think about it a while to realize that Stifler is having an actuabl moment of nobility (the first of maybe two or three).  Otherwise, outside of Samuel L. Jackson when one of his characters goes to town, Steve Stifler is the Picasso of profanity (with credit for the creativity of his profanity being shared between Seann William Scott and writer Adam Herz).Besides, when I start complaining that ""American Wedding"" did have enough sweet moments between Jim and Michelle, who is going to agree with me?  People watch the ""American Pie Trilogy"" for the vulgarity, both verbal and visual, so it seems rather ungracious to ask for something more (but they really should not have wasted Allyson Hannigan like this).",4,Do not watch this movie on a full stomach.

Like many people have said, I thought it would be a total letdown without some of the other characters but after watching the movie, I wasn't disappointed at all. To be honest with you all, I truly do believe that this is the BEST movie in the series. This made me laugh my mouth off from start to finish and the plot to the story was incredibly done. I also believe that the actors and actresses put their best effort to make a great ending to the series. However, this does get me questioning: will this movie truly end the series? I highly believe that there will be another one (I'm hoping too) and I'm sure a lot of people out there would want to see another AMERICAN PIE once they see this. There are some funny scenes and scenes you won't want to miss in this movie! The scene where Stifler enjoys the dogs licking his pants has to be the funniest scene I have seen so far this year! The bachelor's party is the best scene by far... see it and you will understand why this is so. The most disgusting scene is where Stifler eats the dog's crap, to save Michelle's mom from eating it (she believes it's chocolate and Michelle's mom loves eating chocolate). It was so disgusting, it put me off my food after seeing that bit but that definately wasn't a let-down to the movie. Another disgusting part which will make you jump off your seats is the part where Stifler is in a rush to meet Cadence in the closet. It's dark so Stifler cannot see and believes Cadence is in there so he starts feeling up ""Cadence"". Eventually, you'll find that Stifler is having sex with... Jim's grandmother when Finch opens up the door! There are some new characters added to the movie, like:Michelle's hot as blonde sister, CadenceMichelle's parentsJim's grandmaand plenty more.I really enjoyed this movie and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. There are a lot of excellent scenes in here and the movie is just fantastic. I would highly reccommend anyone to see this movie. It's so funny, even your parents will enjoy it.

616627,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JMCT,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 6]","I really should dislike this movie, because the comedy is even more disgusting and base than the previous movies in this series, but when the movie is funny, it's hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing.  Be warned, however, that much of the humor comes from gross situations.In this edition, Jim Levinstein (Jason Biggs) asks Michelle Flaherty (Alysson Hannigan) to marry him.  The big moment is to happen in a very nice restaurant.  Jim hints that he wants to ask Michelle a very important question, and his hinting about is misinterpreted by Michelle, who crawls under the table to do what she thinks Jim wants.  In the mean time, Jim's dad, played by SCTV alumni Joe Levy, shows up and sits in Michelle's chair, unaware that she is under the table.  Michelle goes unnoticed until Jim's dad mentions the wedding proposal, which causes Michelle to bump the underside of the table.  Jim jumps up, his pants are down, and it's embarrassment and pandemonium.  As funny as this scene is, it gets better, or worse, depending on how you look at it, from there.The movie ends up being a series of gags from beginning to end, that are both funny and often disgusting.  Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) is often involved in many of these scenes.  In one scene Steve and Jim are in the library with a dog when an accident with a cake happens.  When Jim's dad opens the library door to bring in Michelle's parents, Steve and Jim appear to be in a very bizarre position with respect to the dog.  You'll have to see this one to understand it or believe it.There are another pair of scenes that are related involving a gay bar, a bachelor party, with Stifler involved, of course, and Michelle's parents.  While not every moment of these scenes are funny, they are in several places, and I found myself laughing all the way through the scene where Jim is supposed to be having dinner at home with Michelle's parents.Stifler manages to get himself invited to the wedding, and even manages to convince Michelle's mother to let him carry the wedding ring.  Unfortunately Stifler manages to lose the ring, which a small dog then eats.  How Stifler gets the ring back is simultaneously funny and gross.While Stifler acts like the jerk he is for much of the movie, near the end we see Stifler make a mistake, and then pull out the stops to correct his error.  For just a moment we get to see Stifler actually act like a human, and the movie turns out all right.I watched many of the extra features on the DVD.  The two features I thought were the best were the deleted scenes and the outtakes.  Watch them after seeing the movie.I gave this movie three stars even though it was a laugh-fest all the way through.  Much of the humor is gross and disgusting, and the situations used to get the laughs are totally unrealistic and bizarre (well, none of these have ever happened to anyone I know).  If you enjoyed the first two ""American Pie"" movies, you'll enjoy this one as well.  Definitely not a family movie and many adults will find portions of the movie a bit too bizarre to be enjoyable.  However, for those who like Mad Magazine and can handle gross jokes, this movie is a blast.",3,A Lot Twisted and Really Funny,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,3167,"['really', 'should', 'dislike', 'movie', 'comedy', 'even', 'more', 'disgusting', 'base', 'previous', 'movies', 'series', 'when', 'movie', 'funny', 'hilarious', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'Be', 'warned', 'however', 'much', 'humor', 'gross', 'situations.In', 'edition', 'Jim', 'Levinstein', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Michelle', 'Flaherty', 'Alysson', 'Hannigan', 'marry', 'big', 'moment', 'happen', 'very', 'nice', 'restaurant', 'Jim', 'ask', 'Michelle', 'very', 'important', 'question', 'hinting', 'misinterpreted', 'Michelle', 'who', 'table', 'do', 'what', 'Jim', 'mean', 'time', 'Jim', 'dad', 'played', 'SCTV', 'alumni', 'Joe', 'Levy', 'up', 'sits', 'Michelle', 'chair', 'unaware', 'table', 'Michelle', 'unnoticed', 'Jim', 'dad', 'wedding', 'proposal', 'Michelle', 'bump', 'underside', 'table', 'Jim', 'up', 'pants', 'are', 'down', 'embarrassment', 'pandemonium', 'As', 'funny', 'scene', 'better', 'worse', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'there.The', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'series', 'gags', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'funny', 'often', 'disgusting', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'often', 'involved', 'many', 'scenes', 'one', 'scene', 'Steve', 'Jim', 'are', 'library', 'dog', 'when', 'accident', 'cake', 'When', 'Jim', 'dad', 'library', 'door', 'bring', 'Michelle', 'parents', 'Steve', 'Jim', 'appear', 'be', 'very', 'bizarre', 'position', 'respect', 'dog', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'one', 'understand', 'believe', 'are', 'pair', 'scenes', 'are', 'related', 'involving', 'gay', 'bar', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Stifler', 'involved', 'course', 'Michelle', 'parents', 'not', 'moment', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'several', 'places', 'found', 'laughing', 'way', 'scene', 'where', 'Jim', 'supposed', 'be', 'having', 'dinner', 'home', 'Michelle', 'parents.Stifler', 'get', 'invited', 'wedding', 'even', 'manages', 'convince', 'Michelle', 'mother', 'let', 'carry', 'wedding', 'ring', 'Unfortunately', 'Stifler', 'lose', 'ring', 'small', 'dog', 'then', 'How', 'Stifler', 'ring', 'back', 'simultaneously', 'funny', 'gross.While', 'Stifler', 'acts', 'jerk', 'much', 'movie', 'end', 'see', 'Stifler', 'make', 'mistake', 'then', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'correct', 'error', 'just', 'moment', 'get', 'see', 'Stifler', 'actually', 'act', 'human', 'movie', 'out', 'right.I', 'watched', 'many', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'two', 'features', 'thought', 'were', 'best', 'were', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'Watch', 'seeing', 'movie.I', 'gave', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'even', 'was', 'laugh-fest', 'way', 'Much', 'humor', 'gross', 'disgusting', 'situations', 'used', 'get', 'laughs', 'are', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'bizarre', 'well', 'none', 'have', 'ever', 'happened', 'anyone', 'know', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Definitely', 'not', 'family', 'movie', 'many', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'portions', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'bizarre', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'who', 'like', 'Mad', 'Magazine', 'can', 'handle', 'gross', 'jokes', 'movie', 'blast']",American Wedding

They were all much needed and very funny characters, and it would have been nice to see how the characters had developed over the three years that Jim and Michelle had apparently been dating.Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan are back to their best in this movie, whether it's trying to write their vows, or having special haircuts. Alyson's hair is now longer, and looks a lot better than when it was in that awful bob, when she was definitely still a band geek.You're introduced to quite a few new characters in this movie - Michelle's sister, who Finch and Stifler both fancy, and both try to outdo each other to win her affections, which provides some comic moments, when they seem to switch characters! There is also Jim's Gran, who gets offended at the fact Michelle isn't Jewish (never been an issue in the previous movies, so there's obviously been something cut out somewhere).  You also get some cringe-worthy (for girls) or sexy (for the guys) scenes featuring two strippers - one a dominatrix cop (whatever), and the other a prissy maid? There's a lot of breast action in this sequence, and of course, any nice eye candy for the girls is left out. There's also Stifler in a gay bar, which is hilarious for the dancing alone, and him not even realising he's in a gay bar!The uncut and unrated DVD is probably better to get. If you've seen it previously in the cinema, then you'll see lots of missing scenes, in-jokes etc. If this is your first viewing, then it won't really matter to you, that it's 8 minutes longer than in the cinemas and contains 17 minutes of `spiced up' footage - and all those 17 minutes seem to be included in the bachelor party sequence with the strippers. Whoopee.The outtakes and deleted scenes in the extras aren't really up to much. One of the strippers ""Nikki"" shows you behind the scenes of the bachelor party, and a cameraman gets to follow her around while she prepares for the big premier. You've also got Seann William Scott introducing a few of the deleted scenes and also a feature on ""Stifler Speak"", in which you get to see his original audition for the role of Stifler.A great finale to a trilogy, but only see if you've seen the previous two - and you'll probably end up being disappointed.",3,A disappointing finale,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,3114,"['always', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'great', 'trilogy', 'wedding', 'Most', 'people', 'say', 'American', 'Pie', 'Wedding', ""n't"", 'great', 'previous', 'two', 'nothing', 'can', 'beat', 'first', 'one', 'finale', 'movie', 'really', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'girls', 'bit', 'teary', 'well', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'Jim', 'Michelle', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'needed', 'movie', 'Stifler', 'Finch', 'Kevin', 'Jim', 'Dad', 'who', 'part', 'get', 'extended', 'movie', 'so', 'fantastic', ""'re"", 'also', 'missing', 'quite', 'few', 'cast', 'members', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Stifler', 'Mom', 'only', 'last', 'couple', 'scenes', 'see', 'reunited', 'Finch', 'bath', 'full', 'bubbles', 'Who', 'why', 'four', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'part', 'hopefully', 'final', 'part', 'American', 'Pie', 'were', 'all', 'much', 'needed', 'very', 'funny', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'had', 'developed', 'three', 'years', 'Jim', 'Michelle', 'had', 'apparently', 'been', 'dating.Jason', 'Biggs', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'are', 'back', 'best', 'movie', 'trying', 'write', 'vows', 'having', 'special', 'haircuts', 'Alyson', 'hair', 'now', 'longer', 'lot', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'awful', 'bob', 'when', 'was', 'definitely', 'still', 'band', 'geek.You', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'quite', 'few', 'new', 'characters', 'movie', 'Michelle', 'sister', 'who', 'Finch', 'Stifler', 'fancy', 'try', 'outdo', 'other', 'win', 'affections', 'comic', 'moments', 'when', 'seem', 'switch', 'characters', 'also', 'Jim', 'Gran', 'who', 'offended', 'fact', 'Michelle', ""n't"", 'Jewish', 'never', 'been', 'issue', 'previous', 'movies', 'obviously', 'been', 'something', 'cut', 'out', 'somewhere', 'also', 'get', 'cringe-worthy', 'girls', 'sexy', 'guys', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'two', 'strippers', 'one', 'dominatrix', 'cop', 'other', 'prissy', 'maid', 'lot', 'breast', 'action', 'sequence', 'course', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'girls', 'left', 'out', 'also', 'Stifler', 'gay', 'bar', 'hilarious', 'dancing', 'alone', 'not', 'even', 'realising', 'gay', 'bar', 'uncut', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'probably', 'better', 'get', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previously', 'cinema', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lots', 'missing', 'scenes', 'in-jokes', 'etc', 'first', 'viewing', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', '8', 'minutes', 'longer', 'cinemas', '17', 'minutes', 'spiced', 'up', 'footage', '17', 'minutes', 'seem', 'be', 'included', 'bachelor', 'party', 'sequence', 'strippers', 'Whoopee.The', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'up', 'much', 'One', 'strippers', 'Nikki', 'scenes', 'bachelor', 'party', 'cameraman', 'follow', 'around', 'big', 'premier', ""'ve"", 'also', 'got', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'introducing', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'also', 'feature', 'Stifler', 'Speak', 'get', 'see', 'original', 'audition', 'role', 'Stifler.A', 'great', 'finale', 'trilogy', 'only', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previous', 'two', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'disappointed']",American Wedding

616640,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JMCT,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 4]","Here we go again. The summer season always starts off so promising with such big event films as this year's X2: X-Men United, The Matrix Reloaded, and Finding Nemo bringing in the masses for some solid entertainment. But as the season goes on, more and more films are released that don't seem to quite live up to the films the summer started off with. And finally as we arrive to the final month of summer fun, the studios seem to repeat their ploy for the summer in this one month. After the surprising success of The Sixth Sense in August 1999 as well as the success of films like Signs and xXx in the same time period three years later, the studios have began to stand up and take notice that the last month of the summer doesn't have to be entirely disastrous. With the right story as well as a decent marketing campaign, a studio can still open a film big in the first two weeks of the month while dumping any low budget trash in the closing weeks of the summer. Since there seems to be no Shyamalan film in sight this year, Universal is willing to fill up the slot with the third, and possibly final, installment of their successful American Pie series. After the surprising success of the original in 1999, the box office saw the rebirth of the teen sex comedy genre though few films following in the foot steps of the American Pie film failed to match up. After a successful sequel in 2001, the cast comes together one more time to serve up a slice of pie to the movie-going public. But in a time when sequels have underperformed at the box office, will American Wedding be able to break the curse or will there be nothing but wedding time blues?The story centers around the marriage of Jim and Michelle as the rest of the American Pie clan clamors to get ready for the big day. The sexual confused group of kids from East Great Falls High has finally grown up and two of them are readying to take the big step into matrimony but there seems to be problems around every corner. Jim, who has subjected himself to a huge amount of public humiliation, has enough trouble trying to please Michelle's parents but soon realizes he has another problem: He can't dance. While Jim tries to figure out how to dance, his friends, Kevin and Finch, try to control Stifler, who seems to have plans of his own for the big day. Not only is he excited to through a bachelor party for Jim, with strippers of course, but eyes Michelle's younger sister, Cadence, who just happens to be a virgin. Like the previous American Pie films, things just seem to go from bad to worse as the day draws closer. The story for American Wedding seems to take itself seriously more then the previous efforts which works wonderfully. Even with that said, the film does seem to offer plenty of gross out humor that continues to surprising even the hardcore American Pie fans. Some of the gross out humor, as funny as it is, is a little too much especially one or more scenes involving Stifler, which the film seems to focus on more then in previous ventures.Though several cast members of the original two films don't make appearances in this film, the remaining cast works well enough together that you barely notice the changes. Jason Biggs, who has subjected himself to public humiliation involving a pie as well as superglue, continues his hilarious antics in the third installment in the series that made him famous, in more ways then one. Biggs should have a real promising comedy career seeing that he is willing to do anything for a film including making himself look like a weirdo especially in scenes that showing off his rear end. Alyson Hannigan, who returns as Michelle, isn't given as much screen time as she should have had but when she is featured; she gives the film its heart which greatly needed outside of the gross humor. Sean William Scott, who returns as the eccentric Stifler, seems to subject himself to as much humiliation as Jason Biggs including a scene to that is so disgusting and so funny that you won't believe it even when you do see it. Though the character of Stifler seems to be focused on more then in the previous films, he isn't focused on too much that film distracts the audience from the real story. The real highlight of every American Pie film has to be Eugene Levy, who returns as Jim's father. Levy, who was the only real funny character in the comedy Bringing Down the House earlier this year, is absolutely hilarious as usual and will hopefully have a long and fruitful comedy career outside of this franchise should this be the last film. The only part of the cast that didn't seem to work well was Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin. He doesn't really do much for the film and, in fact, doesn't really even say much through the course of the two hour feature. Why was he included while other members of the cast were cut? Did they really need all the male leads back for the last film? Is that why he was included? There really seems to be no clear answer.Overall, American Wedding is the one sequel this year that seems to outshine the previous efforts. Though the film is an achievement in that area, there are a few things to pick at. One of those things includes the number of cast members from the original films that were cut from this film. No clear explanation is given to why certain members of the original cast are not invited to the wedding. In fact, they are barely even mentioned outside of a passing note of Nadia. This isn't a big factor but does seem to pick at the back of the minds of a few fans. Another small problem about the film is some of the gross out humor. Though many of the scenes are very funny and don't seem to be retreads of scenes from the two prior films, some of gross out humor seems to be too much to take in especially the scene involving Stifler's search for the lost wedding ring. Outside of those small problems, American Wedding is the best comedy of the summer as well as the year so far. If this is the last film in the American Pie series, it is a wonderful thing to know that the comedy franchise went out on a huge high note.",4,The Moose Hole - No 'Wedding' Time Blues

Stifler (Seann William Scott) plans a raunchy bachelor party, while he and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) both try to woo Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones), who is in town for the wedding.""American Wedding"" was directed by Jesse Dylan, who is new to the ""American Pie"" franchise. It was written by Adam Herz, who created the characters and wrote the original ""American Pie ""  movie. So it's a little surprising that "" American Wedding"" possesses none of the charm that the first film did. ""American Pie"" succeeded, not only because it was funny, but because the characters were lovable and their plight sympathetic. Jim, Finch, Stifler, Kevin, and Michelle are back for this film, but their characters are barely written. If they convey anything at all, it is pathological self-importance. Stifler was always an egomaniacal jerk who had an inflated opinion of himself, and that was funny. In ""American Wedding"" he is too obnoxious for words and comes across as actually being mentally ill, which isn't funny. The jokes are forced. The situations are less believable and consequently less entertaining than in ""American Pie"" or ""American Pie 2"". There's nothing in ""American Wedding"" that will strike a chord with the audience as being an authentic, if exaggerated, take on the emotional or social experiences of young people today. It's just bad writing. Eugene Levy, who added so much to the first two ""American Pie"" films, is wasted on this one. His lines aren't funny. The unrated version of the film contains extra footage from Jim's bachelor party. More boobs, essentially. How can you have a bunch of young men and two barely-clad women in a room and.... nothing funny? Lots of cleavage, little writing. Recommended as a rental only if you've seen the first two and don't want to be left ignorant of the conclusion.The DVD: On the downside, there are 3 previews which cannot be avoided. Happily, both the R-rated theatrical version of the film and the unrated version are on the same disc. Bonus features include: deleted scenes, blooper reel, a featurette on ""Stifler Speak"", a featurette on the making of ""The Bachelor Party"" scenes, a ""making of"" Jim's grooming scene. And there are two commentaries, one by director Jesse Dylan and actor Seann William Scott, and the other by actors Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kay thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas. If you really like Stifler, you might enjoy the ""Stifler Speak"" featurette. And there are more boobs in ""The Bachelor Party"" piece. But, truthfully, these are appropriately uninteresting bonus features for an unfortunately uninteresting movie.",2,Three Is Definitely Not a Charm.,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,2947,"['third', 'final', 'installment', 'American', 'Pie', 'trilogy', 'Jim', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Michelle', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'are', 'planning', 'get', 'married', 'Jim', 'still', 'as', 'disaster-prone', 'ever', 'must', 'convince', 'Michelle', 'parents', 'worthy', 'daughter', 'hand', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'give', 'bride', 'wedding', 'dreams', 'Stifler', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'raunchy', 'bachelor', 'party', 'Finch', 'Eddie', 'Kay', 'Thomas', 'try', 'woo', 'Michelle', 'younger', 'sister', 'Cadence', 'January', 'Jones', 'who', 'town', 'wedding', 'American', 'Wedding', 'was', 'directed', 'Jesse', 'Dylan', 'who', 'new', 'American', 'Pie', 'franchise', 'was', 'written', 'Adam', 'Herz', 'who', 'created', 'characters', 'wrote', 'original', 'American', 'Pie', 'movie', 'little', 'surprising', 'American', 'Wedding', 'none', 'charm', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'American', 'Pie', 'succeeded', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'funny', 'characters', 'were', 'lovable', 'plight', 'sympathetic', 'Jim', 'Finch', 'Stifler', 'Kevin', 'Michelle', 'are', 'back', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'barely', 'written', 'convey', 'anything', 'pathological', 'self-importance', 'Stifler', 'was', 'always', 'egomaniacal', 'jerk', 'who', 'had', 'inflated', 'opinion', 'was', 'funny', 'American', 'Wedding', 'too', 'obnoxious', 'words', 'across', 'actually', 'being', 'mentally', 'ill', ""n't"", 'funny', 'jokes', 'are', 'forced', 'situations', 'are', 'less', 'believable', 'consequently', 'less', 'entertaining', 'American', 'Pie', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'nothing', 'American', 'Wedding', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'audience', 'being', 'authentic', 'exaggerated', 'take', 'emotional', 'social', 'experiences', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'just', 'bad', 'writing', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'who', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'wasted', 'one', 'lines', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'unrated', 'version', 'film', 'extra', 'footage', 'Jim', 'bachelor', 'party', 'More', 'boobs', 'essentially', 'How', 'can', 'have', 'bunch', 'young', 'men', 'two', 'barely-clad', 'women', 'room', 'nothing', 'funny', 'Lots', 'cleavage', 'little', 'writing', 'Recommended', 'rental', 'only', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'left', 'ignorant', 'conclusion.The', 'DVD', 'downside', 'are', '3', 'previews', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'avoided', 'Happily', 'R-rated', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'unrated', 'version', 'are', 'same', 'disc', 'Bonus', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'blooper', 'reel', 'featurette', 'Stifler', 'Speak', 'featurette', 'making', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'scenes', 'making', 'Jim', 'grooming', 'scene', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'one', 'director', 'Jesse', 'Dylan', 'actor', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'other', 'actors', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Eddie', 'Kay', 'thomas', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'really', 'Stifler', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Stifler', 'Speak', 'featurette', 'are', 'more', 'boobs', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'piece', 'truthfully', 'are', 'appropriately', 'uninteresting', 'bonus', 'features', 'unfortunately', 'uninteresting', 'movie']",American Wedding

Jim asks his band camp sweetheart, Michelle, to be his wife, and the hilarity ensues as the wedding plans unfold.  Planning a wedding is an enormous task to undertake, but add the cast of American Pie to it and it will be an extra raunchy, extra awkward good time.There were a few things that were openly absent here which helped make the first two movies such successes.  Here the friend foursome does not include Oz, Kevin never mentions his former girlfriend, Tara Reid, again, and Shannon Elizabeth does not appear as the everyman fantasy.  To make up for this, see the stripper scene at Jim's house.A lot of people were annoyed with this movie, and I think I see why although I thought it was a good idea.  Stiffler, the evil frat brat, has gone strait.  While he causes just as many problems, he is after a girl and wants to be seen as a nice guy.  When the time comes, he is able to put his best foot forward and actually saves the day at the end (the flowers).  Who would have thought?  But as his act is reveiled in the end, he gets his when he is tricked into having sex with grandma in the supply closet.  Ha ha ha ...In the end, this was a good conclusion to the triology.

The chocolate truffle scene for instance. Very funny thanks to Seann William Scott, but very gross at the same time. The bachelor party was one of my favorite parts of the movie.

As a result the gang (well, most of them) gets back together to help plan for and get ready for Jim and Michelle's big day.  As is the case when the gang gets together, lots of bad and hilarious things occur.  As an added plotline, Stifler (Sean William Scott) and his eternal nemesis Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) take on each other for the attention of Michelle's hot sister Cadence.THE COOL THINGS:Many felt that the movie would lose a step with a lot of the old cast (Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Shannon Elizabeth) not returning.  This is not the case however.  The movie actually became a lot tighter with a lot of the extraneous characters eliminated (as several of these characters only had bit parts in the second film).  The same trademarked sophomoric comedy you love and expect from this series continues to shine through, particularly through Stifler's overwhelming personality.  Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) continues to put on a superb performance as the coolest dad on the planet.  In all, all is right in the world with this film.BEST SCENES:1. Stifler and the Dog ""Treat""2. The Bachelor Party3. Stifler and Grandma4. The Proposal5. Jim and the Cake6. The ""Dance Off""THE VERDICT:Overall, the film doesn't lose a step and the laughs keep rolling when Jim and his boys hit the road.  This is a fitting end to an excellent series.

616649,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B00005JMCT,mrliteral,"[1, 2]","American Wedding, like its two predecessors, is, to some extent, reviewproof.  After all, teen sex comedies are rarely ambitious enough to try and earn critical praise.  Nonetheless, while it would be silly to judge American Wedding as a piece of art, it is fair to assess it on its own merits within its genre, and on that level, it is a decent, though not great, movie.The first movie in the trilogy - American Pie - was rightly regarded as a very good movie.  While it had some of the standard teen movie humor, it also was something better, primarily because of the characters who were both likable and not the standard cliches.  By the third movie, however, most of the characters who were so endearing before are either gone or relegated to minor roles.  Instead, the less serious characters - ones such as Finch and Stiffler and even the two principals in Wedding - Jim and Michelle - are the ones in the spotlight now.  The result is a movie that still has some good points, but is also a pale imitation of the original.The principal good things about the movie is the generally likable characters and the avoidance of some of the usual wedding-movie cliches.  In particular, I find it refreshing to have a movie without the standard romantic crises arising from dumb misunderstandings; at least in this movie, Jim and Michelle never really waver from their commitment to marriage; the complications come from other events.  On the other hand, the humor is often sporadic and even the events designed to get the biggest laughs - such as one involving two dogs and a cake - are hit-and-miss.For fans of the other movies in this series, this movie may be worth watching, but because it is dependent on those earlier movies, I cannot recommend it to anyone unfamiliar with the earlier films.  For the fans, however, this is a three-plus star effort, a bit above average but nothing really great.",3,The trilogy concludes,1080172800,"03 25, 2004",2004,1900,"['American', 'Wedding', 'two', 'predecessors', 'extent', 'reviewproof', 'teen', 'sex', 'comedies', 'are', 'rarely', 'ambitious', 'enough', 'try', 'earn', 'critical', 'praise', 'Nonetheless', 'would', 'be', 'silly', 'judge', 'American', 'Wedding', 'piece', 'art', 'fair', 'assess', 'own', 'merits', 'genre', 'level', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'movie.The', 'first', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'American', 'Pie', 'was', 'rightly', 'regarded', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'standard', 'teen', 'movie', 'humor', 'also', 'was', 'something', 'better', 'primarily', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'likable', 'not', 'standard', 'cliches', 'third', 'movie', 'however', 'most', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'so', 'endearing', 'are', 'gone', 'relegated', 'minor', 'roles', 'Instead', 'less', 'serious', 'characters', 'ones', 'such', 'Finch', 'Stiffler', 'even', 'two', 'principals', 'Wedding', 'Jim', 'Michelle', 'are', 'ones', 'spotlight', 'now', 'result', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'points', 'also', 'pale', 'imitation', 'original.The', 'principal', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'generally', 'likable', 'characters', 'avoidance', 'usual', 'wedding-movie', 'cliches', 'particular', 'find', 'refreshing', 'have', 'movie', 'standard', 'romantic', 'crises', 'arising', 'dumb', 'misunderstandings', 'least', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Michelle', 'never', 'really', 'waver', 'commitment', 'marriage', 'complications', 'come', 'other', 'events', 'other', 'hand', 'humor', 'often', 'sporadic', 'even', 'events', 'designed', 'get', 'biggest', 'such', 'one', 'involving', 'two', 'dogs', 'cake', 'are', 'hit-and-miss.For', 'fans', 'other', 'movies', 'series', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'dependent', 'earlier', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'earlier', 'films', 'fans', 'however', 'three-plus', 'star', 'effort', 'bit', 'above', 'average', 'nothing', 'really', 'great']",American Wedding

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[4, 6]","When compared to a train wreck I suppose this movie, &quot;American Wedding,&quot; the third in the American Pie trilogy, engages in a photo finish.  How to say that more succinctly and clear?  &quot;American Wedding&quot; is a cinematic disaster that should be avoided at all cost.  I suppose there may be a use for a movie like this.  After all the CIA still has Saddam Hussein and are surely interested in him telling all sorts of things.  Hussein could be forced into watching &quot;American Wedding,&quot; continuously looped until driven absolutely mad from being subjected to un-funny sight gags and tired forced American Pie I and II references until kicking and screaming he spills the Garbanzo beans.  Just the threat of having to watch the character Stifler in an annoyingly abrasive performance would be enough.Half of the cast bailed from American Pie I and II and for good reason.  Chris Klien (Oz) and Shannon Elizabeth (Nadia) are most notably absent and surely happy about their career choices to sit this one out.  While the majority of the movie industry have moved past the &quot;let's see just how gross we can make the sight gags,&quot; the American Pie team has not.  So, we are left with jokes about consumed dog poop and body hair from certain regions of the body making it's way into the air conditioner and all over the wedding food.  Not much in American Wedding is funny.  Not much in American Wedding is worth watching.So surely there must be something redeemable here.  Well die-hard fans of American Pie I and II may get a few yucks here and there and appreciate seeing Alyson Hannigan's &quot;Michelle&quot; character blossom beyond band camp.  And actually the soundtrack is quite good, but I can't recall the last time I or anyone else went to see a movie to listen to the soundtrack.

Bittersweet because only half of the cast has returned (no Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, or Natasha Lyonne), but the film is surprisingly better without them.  American Wedding finds Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) graduating college and preparing to marry, but not before Stifler (Seann William Scott) can hatch a bachelor party and nearly ruin the nuptuals.  Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Eugene Levy as Jim's dad return to add to the comic relief, even though Nicholas is hardly used at all.  Plenty of mishaps ensue naturally, and American Wedding almost becomes more of Scott's film (his performance goes from irritating to hilarious in the span of the film), but some of the gags (come on, the dog poop?) seem way out of place.

616654,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JMCT,Patrick L. Randall,"[2, 3]","Since 1999, we've all gotten a chance to know and love the ""American Pie"" gang, with all their true to life gaffes and foibles and the genuine goodness of their efforts.  Now, four years after the `fab four' from East Great Falls cemented their pact to lose their virginities by prom night, one of their number, Jim (who also did unspeakable things to apple pie in that first film), is getting married to his infamous `band camp' girlfriend, Michelle (Alyson Hanningan).  After two films of watching poor Jim (Jason Biggs) have every bad thing possible happen to him in his quest to gain sexual experience, it's nice to finally have Jim get it right and make the big trip down the aisle (though, the path there is no less hilarious).""American Wedding"" brings about half of the original cast back for one last go as Jim and Michelle take the final plunge.  It's good to see Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and, yes, even Stiffler (Sean William Scott), again.  Though, the absence of the others ranges from understandable to downright mystifying.  Kevin's ex-girlfriend, Vicki (formerly played by Tara Reid), really would have no place in this movie.  They broke up at the end of the first film and made peace with their respective directions in life at the end of the second.  So, her absence makes sense; as does the lack of the famous foreign exchange student, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth); although we do miss her.  The glaring omissions from this film are supercouple Oz and Heather (played by Chris Klein and Mena Suvari).  Their relationship was still going strong at the end of ""American Pie 2"" and they both were still integral parts of this group of friends.  One can only surmise that Klein and Suvari both felt that a third film was beneath them.  Hopefully, there's a better explanation than this because that would be disappointing.Issues with the casting aside, ""American Wedding"" still manages to embrace the heart of this series while losing very little of the humor.  At the very beginning of the movie, when Jim is preparing to propose to Michelle in a romantic restaurant, they end up in the kind of compromising situation that could only happen to Jim.  Once they are engaged, the challenge becomes planning the perfect wedding, Jim learning how to dance, and Jim meeting and trying to win the approval of Michelle's parents (played by Deborah Rush and the always amusing Fred Willard).  Separately, these are very daunting tasks. Together, they are even more taxing.  When you add the unwelcome presence of Steve Stiffler forcefully inviting himself to the wedding, it has reached a critical mass where nothing but bad things can happen.  Of course, this is Jim's wedding, so things will definitely go wrong.  He can't seem to do anything right to impressing Michelle's parents; he is having a difficult time getting Michelle her dream wedding dress; and, now that Stiffler has wormed his way into the wedding by promising to give Jim the dance lessons he needs, Jim has to keep the `Stiff-meister' reigned in.  Suffice to say, as things get more out of control, the movie gets funnier and funnier.  There is even a scene where Stiffler gets his comeuppance by having a markedly worse experience with a `brownie' than Jim had with a pie.  I believe that when all three movies are looked at, one will see that Stiffler has ended up having bad experiences with every conceivable bodily excretion.Stiffler was a totally obnoxious bore in the first two films and, if he had continued to be one here, ""American Wedding"" would have bombed.  Fortunately, Sean William Scott does a marvelous job at playing Stiffler as an obnoxious oaf who still has a heart.  Stiffler wants to right and be a better person, he just can't seem to get out of his own cocky way.  His maturity over the course of the film is one of its shining aspects.  He never loses that `Stiff-meister' quality, but he manages to balance with a little more heart.  The roles of Kevin and Finch are essentially window dressing in this film, brought back so that Jim could have his buddies to share in his experience.  However, there is a funny subplot where Finch and Stiffler compete for the affections of Michelle's sister, Cadence (January Jones).  Of course, no ""American Pie"" film would be complete without Jim's dad (the winning Eugene Levy) providing his `unique' brand of advice to help Jim through one of the biggest moments of his life.""American Wedding"" brings the `saga' of the ""American Pie"" guys full circle and provides a satisfying conclusion to their stories.

Apparently not realizing that the key to the success of the first two movies is the spiritual journey that the friends undertake as their lives change, the writers of American Wedding throw one gross out comedic scene after another.  The jokes wear very thin by the end.The story is very simple.  Jim and Michelle have been dating for a few years and now want to get married.  The rest of the movie is a series of goof ups, gross outs, and scene after scene of Steve Stifler doing stupid things.  With so much focus on the antics of Stifler, the wedding plot is almost completely drowned out.The worst part of the movie is not the juvenile humor, though.  The problem is that the jokes are telegraphed so that the audience already knows exactly what the punchline will be before the joke is actually executed.  It's one thing to cleverly set up a joke, but this movie shouts from the rooftops, ""Hey, we're telling a joke here!  Haha!  Stifler doesn't realize it's actually Jim's grandmother in the closet! Haha!  Get it??""This movie could have been written and executed much better.  Instead of trying to build heart around the humor, the writers could have (as they did in the first two movies) built the humor around the heart.The cast did the best they could, especially Eugene Levy reprising his role as the ever-caring dad.

The characters actually grew deeper, you cared about them more, you got a deeper insight into their behavior, and it was, well, just *funnier*.With American Wedding, unfortunately, they fell far short of matching anything near the comedy of the other two. Much of the original cast is missing, which didn't bother me too much since Oz (Chris Klein), Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) were my least favorite characters. (But I think we all missed Nadia.) The missing cast members weren't really the problem in American Wedding, however. The problem was that the characters became paper-thin stereotypes of themselves. We saw obligatory knock-off jokes from the first two. There's not much worse than a writer/producer team riding on their own coattails as opposed to actually coming up with something new and original. In part 2, Jim glued himself to...himself, so in part 3 we need another genitalia mishap. In part 2 Stifler got peed on, so in part 3 there was something involving feces. In general the humor in American Wedding is just rewritten scenes from one of the first two movies. There's very little new or original here.The most disappointing was Stifler (Sean William Scott) whom most of us love. I find it amazing that his character actually *regressed* from where it was in the original installment. Herz did a great job of creating a unique character in Stifler, the guy you all knew and hated in high school. He was not only funny but not an exact stereotype. In American Wedding he is a completely clich&eacute;d version of himself - he acts so stupid that you wonder if there's something wrong with him. Literally, they have him acting like he needs medical attention. It turns out that Stifler is featured in the movie more than any other, which would be great if they had given him any funny lines or scenes.In the end American Wedding is certain to please some, but I would save your money on the DVD.

616662,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JMCT,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","There's one thing you have to say for ""American Wedding"": like the two ""American Pie"" films that came before it, it is unapologetically unashamed of its shamelessness.  Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust.  ""American Wedding"" is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste.  In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor.  And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an ""American Pie"" world.In ""American Wedding,"" Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.Indeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular ""American"" outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.  This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in ""American Wedding,"" just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, ""American Wedding"" conveys a certain affection for its characters.

616666,A1K4NEHDEM1OPU,B00005JMCT,Scott Chiarelli,"[1, 1]","Being a huge fan of the American Pie movies I decided that I had to see the third and final one. I wasn't that excited about it because I thought that it would be impossible to top, let alone, compare to the first and second. This movie was not as good as the second(my favorite of the series), though it lives up to it's predecesors(I'm a bad speller). The movie was crudely disgusting like the others(never said that was a bad thing).  The movie had very few moments where I wasn't laughing my (butt)off, but only because they were working up to a joke and because it needed to be serious at a couple times.  Most of the characters are back which surprised me for I had heard that only Stiffler, Jim, Jim's Dad, and Michelle were going to be the only returning characters; Finch, Kevin, and Stiffler's Mom(for a few minutes) returned for the movie. I was disapointed to hear that Vicki and Oz didn't return.  Though some new characters were added for only this movie like Michelle's parents and sister.Now to give you the idea of the movie, which is not really given during the trailers.  The movie was ofcourse about Jim proposing to Michelle, but is placed from the proposal through the wedding. It is placed after college, showing where everyone is in life(the movie is not based on it, the movie just tells where everyone is at the moment the goes on). During the movie Finch and Stiffler fight over Michelle's beautiful and intelligent younger sister, going extremely far to try to get her.I feel that this movie was probably the best 3rd movie of a trilogy considering it is very hard to make a sequel to a sequel good without being repetative of the first 2.

616672,A2277ITC8732QQ,B00005JMCT,Stonecoldmark,"[1, 2]","I am a HUGE fan of the first 2 pie films. My high school life was nowhere near as fun and exciting as this so I was intrigued from the start. The films had interesting and fun characters and it was easy to want to see more.I missed the 3rd film &quot;American Wedding&quot; when it was in the theatre. I wasn't pleased that a majority of the cast was absent from this outing, so I just didn't bother.I just picked up the DVD, and watched it last night. I was to say it was better than I thought it would be, but still just average.What's sad is the premise had so much promise and with all that was built up about the bachelor party scene, I thought I was in for a rare treat.Jason Biggs &amp; Alyson Hannigan are still both excellent in their roles. There was a level of sweetness that really isn't seen in the first 2. Eugene Levy has an expanded role in this 3rd film. He is so welcomed. I have enjoyed his character and never think he's &quot;too much&quot;. It's nice to see this guy get some comedic respect after all these years.The biggest problem I have is with the &quot;Stifler&quot; character. In the beginning of this movie... his foul-mouthed antics are so over the top that it's annoying. It appears as if he didn't want to do the movie so decided to do a parody of Stifler. His character is just as unwanted onscreen as it is by the viewing audience.The other BIG letdown is the ""Bachelor Party scene"". Don't get me wrong; I like naked women just as much as the next guy, but this was lame; especially when much of the hype was about this scene. Sure the girls are smoking hot (most notably Nikki Schieler as the cop). But the scene falls desperately flat soon after. To the point where the gags are no longer funny but just sad. What should have happened is the Bachelor Party should have been the focus of the film, much like the first 2 where a major party was the focus. That would have been a nice way to draw in the other cast members to come back.After seeing the movie, it's easy to see why most of the cast did not comeback. The only question I have is, while Shannon Elizabeth will no longer do nudity and Mena Suvari is married to a very successful cinematographer, what is Chris Klein so busy doing that he can't come back as Oz? He's gone nowhere since the first 2 films.There are some great ""toilet humor"" gags in the film. I am a big fan of toilet humor and just watching Jim land into awkward situations is funny. Also seeing someone eat poop, while gross, is still pretty funny.All in all this was just an average film, a decent ending to an otherwise great franchise. I think it could have been much better if the creators paid more to substance than to cashing in on the name.If you are looking for a really funny college movie, I say get your hands on Van Wilder, that's a film that won't let you down.-Mark",3,Not as good as previous &quot;PIES&quot;,1088035200,"06 24, 2004",2004,2843,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'first', '2', 'pie', 'films', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'fun', 'exciting', 'was', 'intrigued', 'start', 'films', 'had', 'interesting', 'fun', 'characters', 'was', 'easy', 'want', 'see', 'more.I', 'missed', '3rd', 'film', 'quot', 'American', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'when', 'was', 'theatre', 'was', ""n't"", 'pleased', 'majority', 'cast', 'was', 'absent', 'outing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother.I', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'say', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'just', 'average.What', 'sad', 'premise', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'bachelor', 'party', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'rare', 'treat.Jason', 'Biggs', 'amp', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'are', 'still', 'excellent', 'roles', 'was', 'level', 'sweetness', 'really', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', '2', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'expanded', 'role', '3rd', 'film', 'so', 'welcomed', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'never', 'think', 'quot', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'nice', 'see', 'guy', 'get', 'comedic', 'respect', 'years.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'quot', 'Stifler', 'quot', 'character', 'beginning', 'movie', 'foul-mouthed', 'antics', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'annoying', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'movie', 'so', 'decided', 'do', 'parody', 'Stifler', 'character', 'just', 'as', 'unwanted', 'viewing', 'audience.The', 'other', 'BIG', 'letdown', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'scene', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'naked', 'women', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'was', 'lame', 'especially', 'when', 'much', 'hype', 'was', 'scene', 'Sure', 'girls', 'are', 'smoking', 'hot', 'most', 'notably', 'Nikki', 'Schieler', 'cop', 'scene', 'desperately', 'flat', 'soon', 'point', 'where', 'gags', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'just', 'sad', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focus', 'film', 'much', 'first', '2', 'where', 'major', 'party', 'was', 'focus', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'way', 'draw', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'come', 'back.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'most', 'cast', 'did', 'not', 'comeback', 'only', 'question', 'have', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'do', 'nudity', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'married', 'very', 'successful', 'cinematographer', 'what', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'so', 'busy', 'doing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Oz', 'gone', 'nowhere', 'first', '2', 'are', 'great', 'toilet', 'humor', 'gags', 'film', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'toilet', 'humor', 'just', 'watching', 'Jim', 'land', 'awkward', 'situations', 'funny', 'Also', 'seeing', 'someone', 'eat', 'poop', 'gross', 'still', 'pretty', 'funny.All', 'was', 'just', 'average', 'film', 'decent', 'ending', 'otherwise', 'great', 'franchise', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'creators', 'paid', 'more', 'substance', 'cashing', 'name.If', 'are', 'looking', 'really', 'funny', 'college', 'movie', 'say', 'get', 'hands', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'down.-Mark']",American Wedding

Every joke here seems recycled from the previous two films. We should have known that this movie would not live up to the high expectations set by the original two, since half the actors from the originals decided to take a pass on &quot;Wedding&quot;. I can't blame them, because reading the script must have reminded them exactly of the first two.I thought that after &quot;American Pie 2&quot; the producers would make a movie just for Stiffler, but watching &quot;Wedding&quot; made me realize how he cannot carry a movie all by himself. He is way over the top in this one, and becomes more annoying in the end than anything. He actually tries to redeem himself, and this is terrible for his character, because we loved him because he was not a good person, and did not want to be a good person. He can still swear with the best of them, but even the joy of the F-word is sucked out by the end of this movie.If you feel like completely shutting off your brain for a little while, then this movie is not that bad, but it cannot be argued that this is the least funny of the three, and there is little of the surprising heart that made the other two decent films.&quot;American Wedding&quot; is a perfect example of a studio flogging a dead horse, and hopefully we will not see an American Honeymoon or American Divorce.",2,A bad way to end,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,1449,"['course', 'are', 'third', 'installment', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'Every', 'joke', 'here', 'recycled', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'expectations', 'set', 'original', 'two', 'actors', 'originals', 'decided', 'take', 'pass', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'reading', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'reminded', 'exactly', 'first', 'two.I', 'thought', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', '2', 'quot', 'producers', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'Stiffler', 'watching', 'quot', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'movie', 'way', 'top', 'one', 'more', 'annoying', 'end', 'anything', 'actually', 'redeem', 'terrible', 'character', 'loved', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'can', 'still', 'swear', 'best', 'even', 'joy', 'F-word', 'sucked', 'out', 'end', 'movie.If', 'feel', 'completely', 'shutting', 'off', 'brain', 'little', 'while', 'then', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'argued', 'least', 'funny', 'three', 'little', 'surprising', 'heart', 'made', 'other', 'two', 'decent', 'films.', 'quot', 'American', 'Wedding', 'quot', 'perfect', 'example', 'studio', 'flogging', 'dead', 'horse', 'hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'American', 'Honeymoon', 'American', 'Divorce']",American Wedding

616678,A22QPZWME85Z8T,B00005JMCT,"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek""","[1, 1]","For fans or the notoriously raunchy ""American Pie"" series, a certain amount of doubts arise when considering whether or not to see this, the third insallment in the series.  Considering that the second movie was a definite step back from the first, it would be only logical that the next sequel would be even less funny.  Add that to the fact that half of the original cast is missing from this one and things don't look good from the start.  The result though, is very different from what one would expect when following this line of thinking.Somehow, the creators of the ""American Pie"" series were able to dig deep and wrench the last few satisfying drops of comedy from this franchise...with of course one catch.  You will enjoy this movie if you are a fan of the character of Stifler.  Despite the wedding based theme, he is the true main event and the star of the show.  Of course we still have the embarrassing situations that Jim manages to get himself into, the uncomfortable fatherly advice of Jim's dad, and the pseudo intellectual posturing of Finch, but through it all Seann William Scott's Stifler character is front and center and makes the most of it.  With the exception of the very funny opeing scene, Stifler is involved in all of the funniest moments that ""American Wedding"" has to offer, and there are quite a few of them.""American Wedding"" isn't quite equal to the original American Pie, but for fans of this series and this type of comedy, it will not dissapoint.

Marshall,"[4, 16]","After watching this movie I am even more convinced that the original ""American Pie"" film was a fluke....it worked....the other's in the series suffer from trying way too hard.This film has all of the usual actors in their roles with Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan on their way to the altar. So while the women plan a wedding the ""men"" run around town still in search of sexual pleasure in all of its most inane of forms. Stifler (Sean William Scott) is full of his typical gross antics, this time with dogs, dog waste and a focus upon the only thing he seems capable of understanding.....sex. While most of the silliness and surprise of the original ""Pie"" film worked that same vulgar effort misses sorely in this film, basically just grossing people out with the worst of gags and a really stupid and entirely gratuitous T&A; scene that could have easily been thrown on the editing floor.The filmmakers were smart enough to stay with Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Fred Willard and Deborah Rush as the parents who birthed all of these nincompoops!

I suppose as the old saying goes... If ain't broke, don't fix it huh?Also, what happened to OZ and the Sherminator? They were classic characters, seeing as it was a wedding shouldn't have all the characters from the previous two films been in it and got together (Nadia for example?) as a sort of a fair well / good luck tribute to Jim & Michelle? Or is it (as I suspect) that a fourth PIE film is in the pipeline? hmmm...But there aren't all bad moments, the classic personality swap of Stifler and Finch made me laugh the most, just imagine the Finchmeister and Stifler being polite and proper, and of course... the stag party, that's not to be missed!!!This film would be good as a rental DVD to watch with friends & family but unless you are a hardcore PIE fan, I wouldn't recommend buying it as the humour is something of an aqquired taste!
