Now,durign the opening scene, a killer jumps on a victim and shouts something like 'you think you're better than me, %^*%?!"" For no reason we ever learn about.The plot concerning people being killed off by things they fear most isn't used as much as you'd think and all of their 'fears' are either very generic fears or things that can fit into a very generic slasher.

But so what?  Yes, certain scenes seem familiar, but the plot on the whole is pretty original and well done.  I especially give kudos since the director of this movie didn't go to film school and just kind of did things his own way.  That's something you've got to respect.  Also, Debbie Rochon is wonderful as always; she's one of the best actresses out there today.  Too bad mainstream Hollywood hasn't really used her to her full potential yet.

682195,A11POTGSPSYW74,B00005TPCC,"Dolan Debattista ""www.variedcelluloid.com""","[3, 11]","I rented this movie primarily because I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and I didn't expect much  because I had never heard of it before. Fact is, I found this movie terribly boring and disappointing. It is probably due to the fact that its director never heard of the word ""originality"" in his life. In fact there are many obvious things which were literally copies from other far better horror films. The protagonist of the movie is a baby-sitter that is chased by an unknown murderer. Does that ring a bell? If it does not, watch ""Halloween"" and you'll know what I mean. And of course, the murders all take place on Halloween night. The girl whom the protagonist babysits is also shown watching ""Halloween"" during the movie. Wow, what a coincidence! Shame that this same thing was previously shown on ""Scream"" when a couple of teenagers are hanging around in a house also watching ""Halloween"" together. Oh, and by the way the girl killer in the movie is a mentally-ill woman who manages to escape from a mental institution. Again, an obvious ""Halloween"" copycat.Apart from all this, the movie does not even manage to catch your interest. Character development is practically non-existant, and you'll just don't care about all the victims slaughtered throughout. Not to mention the supposed climatic ending which this movie features. You'll just stare at the closing credits asking uselessly yourself ""What is this supposed to mean?""I'll tried to be as helpful as possible to make you open your eyes and stay away from this trash.

682196,A1EM1PEMH6OYDU,B00005TPCC,"J. Cook ""Scabboy""","[4, 5]","I personally thought this movie had a lot going for it. First off we have a great (female) killer with Debbie Rochon, who was shown as the killer in the first scene. The movie had many clich&eacute;s, many scenes that directly reminded me of movies like Scream, Halloween, Friday The 13th, and even cheesy scenes that look like they were ripped right from Friends. The movie had a lot of action, suspense, blood, some boobs (courtesy of Debbie Rochon), humor, a very fitting and neat score, and a very well done, and well entertaining climax in the movie.Some complaints that I had was the whole motive of Jane, and how she fit in with the group of friends. I thought a lot of it was far-fetched and unbelievable. But it is a movie, so I let it slide. One other thing was that the movie could have been a lot more violent and bloody. There were a lot of missed opportunities with it. Finally, the killer. I know she was supposed to be known right off the bat as the killer, but I would have much more preferred that anyone in the gang could be suspected.I watched Suburban Nightmare before I watched this, and I really didn't care too much for it. The movie wasn't at all bad, I just didn't like the story. Buying this, and knowing it was written and directed by the same guy (John Keeyes) I expected the same style of movie. After watching it, I felt that the movie was not only much better than Suburban Nightmare, but better written, directed and with better actors. Debbie Rochon really set this movie apart, and made the movie great. Her masturbation with the knife scene was a bit unnecessary, but very warmly welcomed. I think this is one of her finest movies from start to finish. I would highly recommend this movie, especially to slasher fans and fans of Debbie.",3,Not because I love Debbie Rochon...,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,1772,"['personally', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'First', 'have', 'great', 'female', 'killer', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'who', 'was', 'shown', 'killer', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'had', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'many', 'scenes', 'directly', 'reminded', 'movies', 'Scream', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'even', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'look', 'were', 'ripped', 'right', 'Friends', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'suspense', 'blood', 'boobs', 'courtesy', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'humor', 'very', 'fitting', 'neat', 'score', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'entertaining', 'climax', 'movie.Some', 'complaints', 'had', 'was', 'whole', 'motive', 'Jane', 'how', 'fit', 'group', 'friends', 'thought', 'lot', 'was', 'far-fetched', 'unbelievable', 'movie', 'let', 'slide', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'was', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'violent', 'bloody', 'were', 'lot', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'Finally', 'killer', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'known', 'right', 'bat', 'killer', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'preferred', 'anyone', 'gang', 'could', 'be', 'suspected.I', 'watched', 'Suburban', 'Nightmare', 'watched', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'story', 'Buying', 'knowing', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'guy', 'John', 'Keeyes', 'expected', 'same', 'style', 'movie', 'watching', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'much', 'better', 'Suburban', 'Nightmare', 'better', 'written', 'directed', 'better', 'actors', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'really', 'set', 'movie', 'apart', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'masturbation', 'knife', 'scene', 'was', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'very', 'warmly', 'welcomed', 'think', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'start', 'finish', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'especially', 'slasher', 'fans', 'fans', 'Debbie']",American Nightmare
682197,AAGFBE5EM7YKB,B00005TPCC,Roule Duke,"[9, 15]","I am a huge fan of actress Debbie Rochon and her work and I know I'm not the only one. She has being doing awesome acting in independent films for years and stands out in any role she is cast. Both American nightmare and her portrail of twisted killer Jane Toppan have won much praise and acclaim from audiences and rightfully so.American Nightmare a well shot and all round well acted independant slasher film that is fresh and original and has clearly being crafted with love and care not seen in many indy films by the director. The film relies more on psycological horror rather than buckets of blood, which is terrible when it is done baddly but here it works brilliantly due to competant directing and Miss Rochon's amazing performance.Debbie Rochon seems to completely dissappeare into her character, she done plenty of prep work and research to get into character and that is completely visble on screen. Occasionally Jane Toppan goes into a kind of psychotic outburst, I especially like these scenes the raw energy and anger is so genuine that we truely believe that what we are seeing is a disturbed murder.The fact that we believe so much in the Jane Toppan character makes the film so very much more suspenseful to watch as she stalks and destroys her prey. The unfortunate victims are all nice looking completely innocent every day people, which makes as feel sorry for them as they are slain. So many slasher movies expect us to feel pity for the total jerk characters when they are mutliated by mask wearing indestructable killers, and thankfully American Nightmare is completely free of these common slasher cliches. All the actors are great and characters are fleshed out blelievably. After seeing the making of documentory I realise that this is due to a thorough casting process under taken by the director.I guess that anyone who doesn't like this very cool and well made film has a problem with the some what abstract type ending. I personally liked it as it also doesn't have a quick fix now we can live happily ever after ending and also the surviving victims at the end of this film are visibly distraught, unlike other slashers where they are like happy ""we got away"" as though they forget about all their friends who were just killed the last couple of days. Also we get a gilmpse into the killers own life and heartache.I must say that anyone who apperciates a well crafted and thought out horror film will enjoy american nightmare immensely. And words or at least my words, cannot completely praise the amazing performance of Debbie Rochon.",5,Debbie Rochon vanishes into Jane Toppan,1021852800,"05 20, 2002",2002,2568,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'actress', 'Debbie', 'Rochon', 'work', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'being', 'doing', 'awesome', 'acting', 'independent', 'films', 'years', 'out', 'role', 'cast', 'American', 'nightmare', 'portrail', 'twisted', 'killer', 'Jane', 'Toppan', 'have', 'won', 'much', 'praise', 'acclaim', 'audiences', 'rightfully', 'so.American', 'Nightmare', 'well', 'shot', 'round', 'well', 'acted', 'independant', 'slasher', 'film', 'fresh', 'original', 'clearly', 'being', 'crafted', 'love', 'care', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'indy', 'films', 'director', 'film', 'more', 'psycological', 'horror', 'rather', 'buckets', 'blood', 'terrible', 'when', 'done', 'baddly', 'here', 'brilliantly', 'due', 'competant', 'directing', 'Miss', 'Rochon', 'amazing', 'performance.Debbie', 'Rochon', 'completely', 'dissappeare', 'character', 'done', 'plenty', 'prep', 'work', 'research', 'get', 'character', 'completely', 'visble', 'screen', 'Occasionally', 'Jane', 'Toppan', 'kind', 'psychotic', 'outburst', 'especially', 'scenes', 'raw', 'energy', 'anger', 'so', 'genuine', 'truely', 'believe', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'disturbed', 'murder.The', 'fact', 'believe', 'so', 'much', 'Jane', 'Toppan', 'character', 'film', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'watch', 'prey', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'are', 'nice', 'looking', 'completely', 'innocent', 'day', 'people', 'feel', 'sorry', 'are', 'slain', 'So', 'many', 'slasher', 'movies', 'expect', 'feel', 'pity', 'total', 'jerk', 'characters', 'when', 'are', 'mutliated', 'mask', 'wearing', 'indestructable', 'killers', 'thankfully', 'American', 'Nightmare', 'completely', 'free', 'common', 'slasher', 'cliches', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'blelievably', 'seeing', 'making', 'documentory', 'realise', 'due', 'thorough', 'casting', 'process', 'taken', 'director.I', 'guess', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'cool', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'problem', 'what', 'abstract', 'type', 'ending', 'personally', 'liked', 'also', ""n't"", 'have', 'quick', 'fix', 'now', 'can', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'also', 'surviving', 'victims', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'visibly', 'distraught', 'other', 'slashers', 'where', 'are', 'happy', 'got', 'away', 'forget', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'killed', 'last', 'couple', 'days', 'Also', 'get', 'gilmpse', 'killers', 'own', 'life', 'heartache.I', 'must', 'say', 'anyone', 'who', 'well', 'crafted', 'thought', 'out', 'horror', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'american', 'nightmare', 'immensely', 'words', 'least', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'completely', 'praise', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Debbie', 'Rochon']",American Nightmare
