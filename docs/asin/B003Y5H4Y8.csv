1371557,AAZRWLML88IZK,B003Y5H4Y8,A kids review,"[1, 1]","Have room for one more unoriginal story? A remake of the 2007 Israeli film of the same name, The Debt at least does a good job of adapting the original for a new audience. Flashing back and forth between two eras, The Debt tells the story of three Mossad agents who, in 1966, undertook a mission that made them national heroes... But did they really complete their mission, or is there more to the story? Three decades later, having enjoyed a life of some notoriety, the agents must decide whether or not to follow up on their original task, and as more details are revealed, the path becomes more treacherous for all involved. Though the shifts in time may be a little problematic for some at first, I found much to like in The Debt's smartly executed script and impressive acting. With stars like Tom Wilkinson, Helen Mirren, Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington, Ciaran Hinds, and Marton Csokas filling out the bill, you can be assured this is one thriller that will engage you from start to finish.",3,The Debt,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,999,"['Have', 'room', 'one', 'more', 'unoriginal', 'story', 'remake', '2007', 'Israeli', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Debt', 'least', 'good', 'job', 'adapting', 'original', 'new', 'audience', 'Flashing', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'eras', 'Debt', 'story', 'three', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'who', '1966', 'undertook', 'mission', 'made', 'national', 'heroes', 'did', 'really', 'complete', 'mission', 'there', 'more', 'story', 'Three', 'decades', 'later', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'life', 'notoriety', 'agents', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'follow', 'up', 'original', 'task', 'more', 'details', 'are', 'revealed', 'path', 'more', 'treacherous', 'involved', 'shifts', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'problematic', 'first', 'found', 'much', 'like', 'Debt', 'smartly', 'executed', 'script', 'impressive', 'acting', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'filling', 'out', 'bill', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'one', 'thriller', 'will', 'engage', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

1371560,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,B003Y5H4Y8,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[22, 28]","Debts take time, even generations, to settle. What we owe friends and loved ones often carries more urgency than those we'd eagerly pay enemies.In John (not football coach) Madden's taut espionage thriller ""The Debt,"" young Mossad agents Stephan (Marton Csokas), David ( Sam Worthington), and Rachel (an electrifying Jessica Chastain) felt they owed their families, countrymen, and the world the capture and trial of Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (an superb Jasod Christiansen), the near-demonic ""Surgeon of Birkenau."" Their meticulous plan falls apart,  but Rachel's brave and resilient act ends Vogel's life.At least they return with that story to their home country, becoming national heroes and inspiring Rachel's daughter's best-selling book on the event. It also became their near30-year secret until stunning news in 1997 draws out a now-retired Rachel (the always stunning Helen Mirren) as the only person to settle accounts not just for Vogel's victims but for her family. (Mirren sounds especially convincing telling her child's father, ""I wanted to do something to make my daughter proud of me."") Their cohort, David, may have been owed the biggest debt:  Vogel taunted him and his race years after murdering his family, and David took the guilt of the trio's secret to his grave.""The Debt's""  settings masterfully capture gray, decaying East Berlin under constant watch, tension, and cigarette smoke. Madden builds explosive action scenes from cramped, vulnerable backgrounds: the leaking apartment young Rachel cannot leave, the doctor's office where the Surgeon of Birkenau has her legs spread in stirrups.  The 1997 scenes serve as character development and don't quite measure until the film's jaw-dropping conclusion.  But Mirren's key scene getting needed information from an after-hours newsroom packs its share of humor and tension (sexual and otherwise).""The Debt"" is a sturdy, grown-up spy, revenge film, with Chastain and Mirren  providing a femimist twist.  Their thoughtful, even athletic performances settle the imagination it takes to see both actresses as one character(especially when dealing with David as lover, then martyr).

The movie is the story of a group of Israeli agents who infiltrate East Berlin to capture a Nazi war criminal known as the Surgeon of Birkenau.  This character is based on the Dr. Joseph Mengele, the doctor at Auschwitz who conducted medical experiments on Jewish prisoners at the death camp.  He was also known as The Angel of Death.  The three spies, two men and one women, capture but fail to extract their prey from East Berlin.  The remainder of the movie is about the ensuing events and how the trio dealt with their failure, pragmatically, morally and emotionally.  I do not want to say too much to give away more than necessary.  The drama is gripping a times although there are events and attitudes that are at times not believable - for example the female's impulsive romantic involvement with one of her colleagues.  Also, the actor chosen to play the elder version of one of the two males was at times weak, and this weakness was exacerbated by the fact that he bore little to no resemblance to his younger self; in contrast, the older actor for the other male and the woman were plausible versions of their younger counterparts.

The one thing that is hard to imagine though is that anyone could be better than Jessica Chastain as the young woman Mossad agent in 1966.Three Mossad agents are presented with a rather thankless task.  To abduct one of the horrific doctors from the Holocaust, who was experimenting on Jews and killing them, and bring him back to Israel so justice can be meted out.  If they had just been told to kill him in East Berlin, it would have been a much easier task. The actor who plays the villain does a virtuoso job.  I think that role would have been the most fun to do as an actor.This 1966 portion of the film, starring Chastain, is a 5 star effort.  Where the film is surprisingly not as stellar is with the story decades later when the female agent has aged into Helen Mirren.  Mirren is good but the whole contemporary portion of the story feels off after we've been in 1966 with our original threesome.  I assume this is always a problem when you are cutting back and forth between two time periods.

However, some of the story continues, granted on a much smaller scale, such as the manhunts for people suspected of war crimes like Adolf Eichmann, and the recovery of stolen artwork and artifacts. Much of the atrocities at the hand of the Nazis before and during World War II still linger and affect people today, more than 65 years ago at this writing. ""The Debt"" is a partially fictitious story about how the events of the 1930's and 1940's still carries on today. The story which begins about 20 years after the war doesn't end until 1997.The film begins in 1997 with the publication of a book about three young Israelis 30 years earlier in the service of Mossad in the mid-1960's. The book has been written by the young daughter of one of the agents, the mother now in her 50s. Although this is supposed to be a joyous occasion, the mother appears ambivalent about the whole affair, which is one of the keys to understanding this film. Mossad is the Israeli equivalent of the CIA, and the three agents were engaged in a manhunt for Dr Vogel, the so-called ""Surgeon of Birkenau"", who tortured victims in medical experiments during the Nazi regime in Germany. Although Dr Vogel appears to be a fictional character, I would guess he is largely based on the real-life Dr Joseph Mengele, who engaged in horrible medical experiments at the death camps at the behest of the Third Reich. The three Mossad agents, Rachel Singer, Stephan Gold, and David Peretz, have vowed to kidnap Vogel whom they believe is practicing gynecology in East Berlin under communist occupation and extradite him to Israel to face trial, similar to the fate of Adolf Eichmann only a few years earlier. Vogel, if based on Mengele, would be in his mid-50's in 1965.The film then flashes back to 1965 when two of the three agents, Rachel and David, pass through ""Check-Point Charlie"", the crossing station separating East and West Berlin from 1961 until 1990. Now in East Berlin, they meet up with Gold to resolve to kidnap the doctor. Their mission has three components. They must verify their subject as being the Nazi doctor, they must figure out a way to kidnap him, and lastly, the three with their prisoner must escape back into West Berlin under the nose of East Berlin guards. During this time, people caught trying to escape to the West from the East could be either imprisoned or shot. Presumably, once in West Berlin, they will be met by other members of the Mossad who will take Vogel back to Israel and force him to stand trial for war crimes and murder.Interspersed between the events of 1965-1966 are the events of 31 years later in 1997. Two of the three original agents, Rachel Singer, played by Helen Mirren, and Stefan Gold, played by Tom Wilkinson, are finding that the past has caught up with them, and they must deal with the events of three decades earlier. Singer's daughter has written a book about these young agent's experiences in the 1960's, but as events unfold, it may turn out that not all the events as written are completely accurate.An outstanding and mesmerizing tale of suspense and political intrigue, one of the best I have seen in recent years.

Three Israeli Mossad agents are tasked with capturing the Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel, also known as ""the Surgeon of Birkenau,"" and bringing him from East Berlin to Israel to stand trial for atrocities committed against the Jewish people.  Things do not go as planned, however, and the agents must improvise.  The movie alternates between the mission in 1965 and the aftermath in 1997, when the three are now old and famous, but bear a terrible secret.  Will they tell the truth or continue to perpetuate a lie?The acting is strong (particularly Helen Mirren as old Rachel and Jessica Chastain as young Rachel), and the directing is tight, maintaining suspense till the end.  The blu-ray transfer is great--both audio and visuals are what one would expect from a recent release.  The bonus features include the typical director's commentary and making-of documentaries.Parental advisory: The Debt contains some language and violence, including discussions of Holocaust atrocities.  While there is no nudity, there is implied sex and three uncomfortable-to-watch gynecological examinations with reproduction-related dialogue.

The acting was superb, especially Helen Mirren as the aging Rachel Singer, Jessica Chastain as her younger self, and&mdash;in a complex and brilliantly nuanced performance&mdash;Jesper Christensen as Dieter Vogel, ""The Suregon of Birkenau."" But I have to knock off a star for the weird casting.Martin Csokas and Tom Wilkinson are well enough matched in their respective roles as the young and older Stefan Gold, but I was so confused by the casting for the roles of David Peretz (Sam Worthington/Ciaran Hinds) that it took a while before I could follow what was going on. By the end of the movie, the relationships were more clear, but the stark difference in appearance between the two actors set off a cognitive struggle that caused me to miss a lot of other important details and nuances in my effort to keep straight just who was who. I think this one casting mistake is a major flaw of the movie, although the actors themselves did their best with what they were given.The casting problem aside, I really did like this movie, and more so the second time through it. You could have heard a pin drop when DH and I were watching it, so gripping was this tragedy of errors. But it's subtle in its pacing and effects, with the tension building internally and not as a result of lots of blow-em-up, bash-em-up, fire-em-up scenes. Someone wanting an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone action flick will most certainly be disappointed; but those seeking a sophisticated thriller that will keep them wondering long after the ending credits role will I think be captivated by it.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE DEBT (2010, 113 minutes) is of course the British remake of the great and incomparable Israeli film of the same title (The Debt - Hachov- Israeli Hebrew Drama Movie (English Subtitles)""HA HOV"" in Hebrew, see my review) from 2007, in that film the great Gila Almagor in the role of the beleaguered Rachel Singer. Here Helen Mirren does the honors and I have to say that she gives poor old Gila a run for her money.The setting is Israel, sometime in the late 1990s. Stephan (old, Tom Wilkinson; young, Martin Csokas) comes to see his ex-wife Rachel to tell her the old Nazi they led everyone to think they killed in the 1960s in now talking in the Ukraine. Here the Surgeon of Birkenau is played with menacing glee by that ever-evil Dane, Jesper Christiansen.Meanwhile poor tormented David Peretz (old, Ciaran Hinds; young, Sam Worthington) who was the third person on the 3-person Mossad team commits suicide. This is because earlier he had asked Rachel to allow him to tell the truth about their loss of the Nazi war criminal. After she told him it must be kept secret, he simply kills himself in a most horrific way.Of course this is a remake, and as such it does fall way short when compared to the original. You should see this film, but I always strongly suggest seeing the original. No one can do these films like the Israelis and Europeans. No one can act as well as Europeans and Israelis in such work. This remake unnecessarily loses a lot of the great suspense of the original; though it creates moments of suspense of its own, it sort of blows the whole operation and leaves the viewer simply bored. The original never did that. The original film has a tension that is inescapable.Not to say this is a poor job or the quality is bad; quite the reverse. For an audience that is in a hurry, I suppose this will do nicely if the original can't be viewed. However, I have very negative feelings about these immediate remakes.

1371584,A28C7103WO6CPD,B003Y5H4Y8,Fuinnimh,"[0, 0]","Seeing Jessica Chastain in both The Help, and Tree of Life, made me decide to see The Debt.Director John Madden directed Shakespeare in Love which won 7 Academy Awards including, Best Actress for Gwyneth Paltrow, and Best Supporting Actress for Judi Dench. He also directed Prime Suspect 3 starring both Helen Mirren and Ciaran Hinds, who both star in The Debt; and Captain Corelli's Mandolin.The Debt parallels real events. Mossad agents abducted Eichmann in Argentina in 1961, tried him in Israel, and executed him. The notorious Dr Mengele, the butcher of Auschwitz fled to South America, narrowly escaping the Mossad in Argentina, fleeing to Paraguay, and then Brazil. Birkenau is known also as Auschwitz Birkenau. Twenty four surgeons experimented on human captives, often performing unnecessary surgical operations without anaesthetic.In 1965, a rookie Mossad agent played by Jessica Chastain, crosses Checkpoint Charlie and joins two male agents in East Berlin, to identify and kidnap the notorious surgeon of Birkenau, now a gynaecologist. She must pose as a patient, and subject herself to the cold probings of her intimate place by the butcher, and take close up photos without arousing suspicion.Photographs of his terrible deeds haunt her and fill her with apprehension and fear. Photographs of smiling babies adorn his waiting room wall. A man who once took life from the world, now charged with bringing life into the world.Her legs in stirrups, vulnerable, afraid, he probes her intimate space with his instrument, as he asks probing questions, about her unfamiliar accent, about her mother, about how she found him. It's tense and gripping. He gives her sex advice, and injections which will help her become pregnant. Meanwhile her desire grows for the sensitive agent, but David though attracted is closed off, and a romantic triangle develops. Will the doctors advice pay off?When the mission goes wrong, the three agents and their captive remain in the same house. He would rather escape than die, and rather die than face trial. He senses the weakness in the relationships of his captors, and in their psyches, and pushes them to their psychological limits. He says things you would not expect to hear in a movie. As tensions mount, the great psychodramatic moments of the movie unfold. It's strangely intimate. He pushes the mother button with Rachel, while she shaves him with a cutthroat razor, and tears stream down her porcelain cheeks. She goes to the bathroom to throw up. When David, the sensitive one replies to him, 'you are a monster,' you can see from his facial expression that he is getting off on it. He plays them off each other. She is with him but it's you she wants. He seems able to read her mind, to guess her real name, intuit her condition. Here the acting is simply amazing and totally absorbing.The doctor succeeds in his goal. They return to Israel, with an invented truth, and a heavy secret. Thirty years later that secret will force Rachel out of retirement, so the real truth can remain unknown.The Debt is part suspense, part thriller, part psychodrama, its parts stirred by three great acting performances.Jessica Chastain as the lead is incredible, with a face crafted by the cinematic gods, one of the best new talents I have seen. I was totally wowed by her performance.Jesper Christensen delivers an astounding performance as the doctor, perhaps I am supposed to feel shock and outrage, yet I found it gripping and strangely delicious to watch the psychological cat and mouse game between him and her.Helen Mirren, shows a harder edge as the older Rachel, always a gripping presence.I love movies with a heroic female protagonist. When plans go awry, she steps out of the shadows looking for a light, she ventures into the stirrups, and she fights. She feels the fear and does it anyway.

I agree with one of the other reviewers - if this were a book, it would be impossible to put down.  The plot twists, and there are more than one, don't telegraph themselves up front, which heightens the overall sense of drama, and the movie doesn't let up, even in the last few minutes of the film.

But news arrives that at all old folks home in the Ukraine that the surgeon is still alive. We learn that the now retired Mossad secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stefan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) nee an explanation. Flash back to 1966 when the trio of  three Mossad agents (Rachel - played at the young age by Jessica Chastain, Stephan Gold (Marton Csokas)and  David Peretz (Sam Worthington) were  sent to capture the surgeon (Jesper Christensen) and erroneously allowed him to escape and promised each other to keep their secret, told the papers that he committed suicide. Rachel, Stefan and David decide they must complete their broken mission and go to the Ukraine, fine the surgeon and kill him. Stephan and David are not up to the task, so it is left to Rachel to finish their mission. The suspenseful hunt and chase is how the mission is accomplished.The manner in which the film is set into motion is a seamless interchange of the years 1944 during the war and the black and white images of the concentration camps, and 1965 when the three young Mossad agents captured the surgeon (and their interaction with him before his escape) and the present when the now 60ish Rachel carries out her duty. It is chilling, rich in character development, and maintains a degree of tension that is almost unbearable at times. But the other aspect of this film that keeps it form being yet another memoir of the mistreatment of the Jews in WW II is the element of humanity in each of the three Mossad agents as they deal with their task and yet interact with the evil and warped surgeon. This is a very strong film, one that deserves audience attention.

Often the problem with directors and editors is that they are so familiar with a script that they can start to play with nuances which an audience in a theatre cannot rewind to figure out or an audience at home is often too distracted by ongoing home & family issues to devote 100% maximum attention to capture the critical subtleties.Guide that can be read a few minutes into the movie:Characters: See them in Israel in 1965 and again in 1997. Rachel Singer (25) marries Stephan Gold (25) has author daughter (Sarah) but likes David Peretz (29). They are after Surgeon of Birkenau (Dieter Vogel) in E. Berlin on New Year's eve 1965.Goal: Capture Vogel in E. Berlin and put him on a W. Berlin train that briefly passes into E. Berlin before continuing back into W. Berlin.Problem: The cover up and lies about Vogel's death when he escapes and the consequences of resolving those lies is our story.Guide if confused after most or all of the way into movie:Gold asks Peretz to go after Vogel after he escapes from them. The guilt of living the false capture/killing lie (notice how ill he is from that guilt); also that Singer would not give permission to tell the truth. Finally, being asked by Gold to go to the Ukraine Psychiatric Hospital for the final killing of Vogel all leads him to suicide. Singer accidentally finds the real Vogel kills him and she dies after bleeding slowly (note closeup of blood dripping as she walks down the hallway) or outside the hospital (not shown in edited version). Leaves note telling a reporter the truth.Hint: Listen to sounds/music and visual symbolism. Three scenes where Vogel ministers to Singer and three scenes where Singer ministers to Vogel.Last scene on airplane, Singer looks at Peretz but he only looks down and not back then several ominous black vehicles come out of the blinding white light toward the airplane as they walk off.

1371596,A1SAZB83QFR0W2,B003Y5H4Y8,"JackOfMostTrades ""Jack""","[1, 2]","The Debt is a thoughtful political thriller with a greater emphasis on character development and conflict than death-defying feats, and the spirit of the filmmaking of this historical tale (shuttling between the 1960s and the 1990s)is told with the type of messy inventiveness of feature film making of the 1970's more than the paint by number flicks that are basically a sequence of special effect coups that ooos and ahhhs contemporary audiences in feature film and TV films today. What makes The Debt different is that it succeeds at creating a story that is character and plot driven at the same time. That Aristotelean idea that 'character is fate' plays out on this remarkable celluloid canvas--most significantly among the actors portraying the three young versions of the Mossad Trio, Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington, and Marton Csokas, thereby truly fulfilling the potential of narrative film to show character development, action, time and place juxtapositions, and subtle behavior at the same. Each agent is dedicated to bringing justice to his/her country, but each has a personal narrative and personality that makes them all convincingly vulnerable, albeit in different ways.  Their basic personalities evolve into the logical characters that we see over 30 years later in the 1997 sequences of the movie.Without revealing too much about this unpredicatable but plausible plot, I can say that most everything on the screen gets it ""right."" It seems to me ironic that a narrative that holds to the classic traditions of what makes a good tragedy/drama is a rarity, and that is characters that demonstrate personal imperfection, flaws, and vulnerabilities that exist evem within real life ""special ops"" members. A lot of action films nowadays would probably cast Achilles without a vulnerable heel (which basically destroys the point of the hero).The three Mossad operators given the task of bringing a Nazi war criminal to justice don't exude the confidence or invincibility of their implausible counterparts that audiences seem to thrive on--I expect for the value of escapism. Instead, the agents betray much inner conflict when having to make very difficult decisions. But that makes the action more riveting, not less.  For this reason, after watching the film, you're not as likely to feel you've just been on a fun roller coaster ride like your typical Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise vehicle--all visceral and quickly forgetable.The only trouble I had with the film is that the agents circa 1970 didn't much physically resemble the same characters some 30 years later. But that would have been a feat of casting not easily negotiated, so I would let the matter slide. It's a minor issue compared to the fact that popular audiences will 'let slide'the fact that what they are watching are one-dimensional cartoon figures that are on the side of ""right,"" without acknowledging that even justice has consequences and is rarely neatly tied up and set to rest. The Debt is entertaining and edifying, and exploits the medium craftily in its acting, direction, dialogue, and design. What more could you ask for?

Now, you're like what in the world could have caused him to do that???The ending was 100% disappointment: You're expecting some crazy action pact, edge of your seat-like events to unfold (it should be as good or better than the beginning).  You expect Helen Mirren to kick some former Nazi butt.  You expect to understand why the one agent killed himself.  Well...it's all very unfilling.  It felt like the person that wrote/directed the movie got lazy and just wanted to finish it.  If you're going to finish it in a nursing home, make it a little more exciting.Would I watch it again?

The action simply provides the bedrock for the psychodrama. THE DEBT is a remake of a 2007 Israeli film which was rather different.The acting in THE DEBT is excellent, particularly that of Jessica Chastain as the younger Rachel. Chastain is a talented actress who, though she has appeared in many films, has fortunately managed to avoid celebrity. Helen Mirren, who plays the older Rachel turns in her usual work of stellar caliber.It is 1965. Stefan, David and Rachel are Mossad agents tasked to capture the Mengele-esque ""Surgeon of Birkenau,"" a Dr. Vogel, who is living inconspicuously in East Berlin, practicing gynecology twenty years after escaping justice for his war crimes of useless and horrifying medical experiments on Auschwitz inmates.They capture Dr. Vogel but when they attempt to sneak him ""over the wall"" into West Berlin things go badly awry, and so the three agents are forced to care for him while awaiting extraction. Realizing that his captors have become as much a set of prisoners as he himself, the wily Vogel (who is an unrepentant Nazi to the core) begins to torment them psychologically; eventually, he makes his escape.Recriminations fly back and forth. Finally, Stefan convinces David and Rachel to agree to the story that they killed Dr. Vogel while he was trying to escape. Eventually, they are extracted, and return to Israel as heroes, where they are feted and invited to speak publicly about their successful mission.Thirty-odd years pass. Stefan is now head of the Mossad. Stefan and Rachel have been married and divorced, and have a daughter who is a notable Israeli journalist. Their daughter writes their memoirs which become an international best-seller.At the same time that their daughter's book comes to print, a Ukrainian journalist announces that he has gotten an exclusive interview with a old man claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau. Rachel, Stefan and David's thirty-five year old lie begins to unravel. How they deal with that unraveling and the consequences they face make up the kernel of THE DEBT.I didn't like THE DEBT. I can't appreciate films where the motives and motivations of the characters get twisted into Turkish Taffy by dint of their own stupidity. There's something pathetic about watching intelligent people knowingly sticking their feet into bear traps, and that's what we have here. THE DEBT's biggest failing is the moral relativism of its characters. Dr. Vogel is the only character who seems to have the courage of his convictions, however twisted they may be. What I kept asking myself as THE DEBT played out was why the three agents simply didn't kill Vogel after their first botched extraction attempt. In the end, their lie, made true, would have been a better resolution than the self-imposed unresolvable ethical morass in which they lived their lives.",3,"If there is no such thing as absolute morality, then child abuse is not evil, it just may not be your thing---R.M.

It begins in 1997 with a book event in which a young woman has honored her mother by writing about the mother's valor in 1966 in which she was instrumental in the tracking down and assassination of a Nazi war criminal.  But, as the film, progresses, the audience comes to understand that this incident was not exactly what it seemed and the mother might have to redeem herself in some way because of this.Helen Mirren is cast as Rachel, the mother and is outstanding in her performance.  So is Jessica Chastan, who plays the young Rachel.  Through flashback, the story unfolds with all its romance, terror and complex plotting as things go terribly wrong and young Rachel and her two male accomplices have to make some difficult choices.  The film is fast paced and exciting with twists and turns that kept me at the edge of my seat as the plot moved from 1966 to 1997 with an incredible new challenge for the older Rachel.The acting was superb and I loved this film.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[6, 7]","Seeing Jessica Chastain in both The Help, and Tree of Life.Director John Madden directed Shakespeare in Love which won 7 Academy Awards including, Best Actress for Gwyneth Paltrow, and Best Supporting Actress for Judi Dench. He directed a favorite of mine,Captain Corelli's Mandolin, starring Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz, And Christian Bale.I have also seen original movieThe Debt  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom].In 1965, a Mossad agent played by Jessica Chastain, crosses Checkpoint Charlie and joins two male agents  in East Berlin, to identify and kidnap Birkenau's notorious surgeon, now a gynaecologist. Rachel is recruited not for her field experience but for her language skills. She must pose as his patient, allow intimate probings by hand and speculum, and take close up photos without arousing suspicion.Mossad agents abducted Eichmann in Argentina in 1961, tried him in Israel, and executed him. Notorious Dr Mengele, butcher of Auschwitz fled to South America, narrowly escaping capture by Mossad in Argentina fleeing to Paraguay, then Brazil. Birkenau as known also as Auschwitz Birkenau.  Twenty four surgeons performed unnecessary experiments on human captives, often without anaesthetic.Photographs of the surgeon's terrible deeds haunt her and fill her with apprehension and fear.  Photographs of smiling babies decorate his waiting room wall.  A man who once took life from the world, now charged with bringing life into the world.Her legs in stirrups, vulnerable, afraid,  as he probes her he asks probing questions, about her unfamiliar accent, her mother, how she found him.  It's weird, tense and gripping.  He gives her sex advice, and injections to help her become pregnant.  Meanwhile, back at the house her desire grows for the sensitive agent, who though attracted is closed off, and a romantic triangle develops. You may wonder if the doctors advice will pay off.As the mission goes wrong, three agents and their captive are forced to remain in same house.  He would rather escape than die, and rather die than face trial.  He senses weakness in the relationships of his captors, and in their psyches, and pushes their psychological limits.  He says shocking things. ""You jews don't know how to live, you onl;y know how to die.""  ""You are veek""As tensions mount, great psychodramatic moments unfold. It's strangely intimate. He finds Rachels weak spot and as she shaves him with a cutthroat razor in that strangely intimate way a girlfriend might shave her lover, tears stream down her porcelain cheeks.  He pushes David's weak button. She goes to the bathroom to throw up.  When David,the sensitive one replies, 'you are a monster,' you can notice from his facial expression that he gets off on it.  He plays them like violins.  'She is with him but it's you she wants.  When she kisses him she thinks of you.'  He reads her mind, guesses her real name, intuits her condition. These are the most absorbing movie moments.The doctor succeeds with his violent goal. They return to Israel, with an invented truth, and a heavy secret. Thirty years later that secret will force Rachel out of retirement, so real truth can remain secret.The Debt is part suspense, part thriller, part psychodrama, its parts stirred by three great acting performances.Jessica Chastain as the lead is incredible, with a face crafted by the cinematic gods, one of the best new talents I have seen. I was totally wowed by her performance. At a restaurant nights ago, no one at my dinner table knew who she was.  Pretty soon everyone will know who she is. She has four movies yet to be releassed this year. I  could not imagine anyone else doing this role as well, except perhaps a young Helen Mirren.Jesper Christensen delivers an astounding performance as the doctor, perhaps I am supposed to feel shock and outrage, yet I found it gripping and strangely delicious to watch the psychological cat and mouse game between him and her.Helen Mirren, shows a much harder edge as the older Rachel, always a gripping presence, and I would be surprised if she is not nominated for best supporting actress.I love movies with a heroic female protagonist.  When plans go awry, it is she who steps out of shadows looking for light, she who ventures into stirrups, she who fights. She feels the fear and does it anyway. She is an everywoman required to do dangerous things. Other movies with great female protagonists would beBlack Book, andThe Girl Who Played With Firemovies. I wish Hollywood would make make more movies like these.  These are European movies.If you're like me, you may wonder what exactly is meant by the debt? Is it generational?  Is it karmic? Will the truth set us free?We can ask if there is a moral equivalence in entering another country to seize someone illegally so they can face a legal trial.  How legal would such a trial be? Let us remember there may be times when special forces need to go on a secret mission to find an elusive terrorist, perhaps in Pakistan, reponsible for thousands of civilian deaths, and a continuous threat.  Those who live by the sword die by  the sword.If you want to see original The Debt (subtitled), there are story differences.  In particular there is a scene where she shaves him, where he says 'why don't you kill me?' where she gives an interesting response, not in the remake. I prefer the more clear cut ending n the original.If you love this, recommendMunich (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)by Spielberg, an excellent thriller and story about Mossad agents responding to the massacre at the Munich Olympics which won five Oscar nominations including Best Picture, where Ciaran Hinds also plays Mossad agent, and Best Adapted Screenplay, andThe Readerwhich won five  Academy nominations including Best Picture, and an Oscar for Kate Winslet, because both have thematic similarities, andBlack Book, which I own, a Verhoeven movie.I don't think there has ever been been an Oscar given or even a nomination to two actresses playing the same character in the same movie.  It would make a good story, would it not?  I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",5,Karma has a way of seeking you out,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,6143,"['Seeing', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Help', 'Tree', 'Life.Director',

I'm sympathetic to the storyline, but I hate to say it, this one is laughably bad.  GREAT ACTING though, and the actual production itself is well done.  But the script is ridiculous, thoroughly lacking in credibility, and in the end, this is an exercise in ""fantasy escapism"" and nothing more.The story concerns the intertwined lives of three Mossad agents who were on a mission in East Berlin to capture and return to Israel for trial a Dr. Mengele-like Nazi who had been hiding under an assumed identity.  The operation becomes botched, and the doctor gets away.  But the Mossad agents agree to tell their superiors that while they succeeded in capturing the doctor, he escaped although got killed by them in the process of trying to escape, and would not be returned to Israel for trial.  Allegedly, this secret ""haunts"" these agents for the next 30 years (yeah, right), to the point that it disrupts their lives.  And the rest of the film is how at a late stage in life, two of them attempt to fix the problem.It would have been more credible for the story to be geographically placed on the moon rather than East Berlin.  The idea that a ""secret operation"" could have been run for an extended period of time by several strangers living in an East Berlin apartment building who go unnoticed and do not attract the attention of the Stasi or police would make anyone who knew anything about the Stasi and the East German police state laugh or cringe--I'm not sure which.  More than probably any place on earth, literally nothing could happen in East Berlin without the Stasi and the State knowing about it--often before it even happened.  There is absolutely zero credibility that an operation of this sort could have taken place, so instantly, this story is a fantasy and nothing  more.There's also likely equally little credibility that any intelligence operatives, let alone Mossad agents, would be ""haunted"" by a botched operation for the rest of their lives.  Based on what I know (including having known some intelligence operatives even if at the time I knew them I was not aware of that fact), if these people had the sort of psychological makeup that would lead them to being ""haunted"" like this, they would have never been intelligence agents in the first place.Helen Mirren is, as usual, great.  The acting overall is great.  The production is professional (although I'm getting a little tired of the ""realistic"" camerawork that leaves the screen image shaking rather than stationary).

He had performed gruesome experiments on Jews during the War.  The film begins in 1997 with Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren) celebrating the release of her daughter's book about the events leading up to Dr. Christensen's capture.  As Rachel reads a passage from the book to the audience, her mind and the movie revert back to 1966 when she (now portrayed by Jessica Chastain) and her partners, David (Sam Worthington) and Stefan (Marton Csokas) plan the doctor's kidnapping.  Their plan is to return him to Israel for trial.The film does a few flips back to the current time to force us to realize that things are not what they seem.  Rachel's former husband, Stefan (now played by Tom Wilkinson) is concerned about David (now played by Ciaran Hinds) for some reason.  Most of the film involves the capture.  It is grippingly thrilling for the most part.  A subplot involving the romantic triangle comes into play and is important as we will find out in the more recent time period.  Without giving too much away, there are loose ends that must be tied up.  The 3 older actors are brilliant as usual and the 3 younger ones hold their own.

Addedto this is an even more problematic factor: the younger and oldercounterparts don't look a bit alike, so keeping track of them bycharacter names can keep a viewer in a distracted frame of mind.Other than the script problems, it must be said that the acting is allon a high level, and the story is particularly engaging during theearlier 1967 sequences. This is partly due to the fact that Rachel(Jessica Chastain) gives the most impressive performance in the filmand is someone who immediately involves you in the story.

1371633,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B003Y5H4Y8,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[1, 1]","Full marks for ambition: pitting a crack squad from Israel's controversial secret intelligence agency against a retired Nazi makes for a complicated game of good versus evil in any weather. But when your monster, the ""Surgeon of Birkenau"" (surgeon? Why not butcher? Or slasher?) is not Josef Mengele but one of the lesser villains in the national socialist pantheon of evil (it is all relative, of course) and the Mossad squad is more conflicted in their mission than usual, there is certainly scope for something genuinely challenging.Much is made of Mossad's questionable methods and, in a pointed piece of irony, it is the Israeli Stephan Gold who dehumanises the Nazi prisoner and not, as convention usually requires, the other way round. This is courageous film making, and I can see John Madden getting flack for it in certain conservative quarters. All the more reason to applaud.So to the set up. Back in the seventies, when everything was grimy and brown, Mossad sent three of its youngsters to East Berlin to kidnap said surgeon, now working as a gynaecologist. Their scheme involves Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) feigning pregnancy to get close enough to Old Dr Gardener to validate that he is indeed their target. This presents some genuinely chilling scenarios: over a stilted conversation (during which he seems to suspects a ruse), a lone Jewish woman opens her legs with stirrups to a Nazi torturer and his instruments. It's a memorable, creepy scene, and it is well executed by all concerned.Satisfied that they have the right man, the surgeon is thrillingly apprehended and spirited away in preparation for a bold escape from Communist Berlin and rendition to Israel to stand trial for war crimes.Of course, the Mossad escape plan has as many holes in it as the permanently leaking roof of their safe house. When it is eventually upset - as, of course, it must be - it is by something as unforeseeable as a postal worker stepping outside for a cigarette. The team improvises an escape under a hail of bullets from the East German guards, but are nonetheless now intractably stuck behind the iron curtain with an elderly German doctor for a prisoner.In another courageous move, Dr Vogel turns out not to be much of a monster at all - his first concern is for his wife - but neither has he resiled a great deal from his Nazi views. With these he regales and taunts his captors and, sure enough, the shoots of some stockholm syndrome begin to emerge, particularly as regards young Rachel.You'd be forgiven for drawing a parallel with Silence of the Lambs - John Madden wants you to, I think - but the exchanges between Rachel and Dr Vogel have nothing like the weapons-grade intensity of Hannibal Lecter's interlocutions with Clarice Starling. They might have, had Dr Vogel been more of a Mengele.In the Berlin sequence there are some fine performances from an ensemble cast. A special shout out must go to poor old Marton Csokas - once a fairy in The Lord of the Rings and before that geeky Dr. Leonard on a New Zealand soap opera - who excellently plays Mossad leader Stephan Gold for three quarters of the film, but still hasn't got enough name recognition (or pronounceability, perhaps) to get a significant billing despite being a lead role in the film. Sam Worthington does, on the other hand, most recently having been seen as a tall blue mongrel Avatar, and he steals the show with an intense performance as David Peretz, the most idealistic and personally invested of the agents. Though she'd be a closer resemblance to a young Julianne Moore, Jessica Chastain does well as the young Helen Mirren, despite having to sexually tease both David and Stephan simultaneously in a pair of completely non-sensical relationships.The convoluted set of moral imperatives are further compounded by a series of twists that turn the screenplay into a tourniquet. It is difficult to discuss much more of the plot without spoiling surprises as there are so many, but this is symptomatic of the film's weakness: it tries to do too much everything: there are unnecessary angles, subplots, characters and locations. A bit more gusto with the editor's pen on this peripheral stuff might have given room for a better exploration of the central relationship between Rachel and Dr Vogel, which to me is the heart of the film.The East Berlin action over, we transpose to modern day Tel Aviv, where Madden needs Singer (now Helen Mirren, bearing the scars of the operation, physically and psychologically) to have a rationale for re-engaging in something she's long left behind. The device he chooses doesn't ring awfully true: a daughter conceived during the original operation to Stephan who has grown up and written a book about the raid which, despite it misreporting events entirely, Rachel is nonetheless sponsoring.It isn't clear why Rachel Singer would sanction a book about the botched raid, much less an inaccurate one by her own daughter, other than to paint her character into a corner suitable for the screenplay to develop. Screenplay accordingly does so develop: Mirren is characteristically watchable as Rachel, but the film still loses its way in the final reel (it does this even literally: Mirren is obliged to traipse up to a remote mental hospital in the Ukraine for her final showdown).When it should be building to unbearable proportions the tension dissipates and the film ends on a rather ambiguous down-beat. This may be a product of a director wanting to stay true to his intellectual principles at the expense of the easy thrills of a thriller. If so, I think Madden has taken the wrong option: After thirty years, little enough is still at stake (only egos, really) and too many guns and fight sequences have taken place to carry the notion that this film isn't, at its heart, a good old fashioned spy yarn. Fundamentally it is - and a compelling, tense and watchable one at that, though it will be interesting to see how it compares to the newly filmed Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.Olly

Chastain's is the standout performance in the movie.On a philosophical level, the movie questions the heroism of the actions of the Mossad agents, then it uses plot twists to nullify the heroism completely, and in the end grants one character a measure of redemption.It's interesting, but it's way, way overwrought, and though the movie is selling itself as being cerebral, in the end it appeals to emotional prejudices.

This film tells the story of the three agents.David, played by Sam Worthington, Rachel, played b Jessica Chastain, and Stefan, played by Marton Csokas, are Mossad agents. From the opening scene until the last, suspense is the word of the day. We have all seen what East Berlin was like, dark and dreary. Now, the three young people must plan and carry out their job. From one day to the next, danger is around the corner, and we are never sure of the plan. The danger of this film is that it moves from 1965 to 1997, when Rachel's now grown daughter writes a book telling of her exploits. The 1997 agents, now thirty years older, are played by Tom Wilkinson, Helen Mirren and Ciaran Hinds. This was a distraction for me, and I found the older characters more believable. In 1997, one of the characters realizes that he must tell his version of the truth and can no longer live a lie. This changes the path for the other two and brings the story of their exploits full circle.Any film with Helen Mirren is a good one. 'The Debt' is a film that is good but not great. The change of time from 1965 to 1997 is not even, and gives the film a confusing stance that takes time to understand. The story of the hunt for the Nazi criminal is an interesting one, but one that has been told many times. There are many twists and turns that kept this film alive for me.

I'll admit, it was a film I kept my eye on once I read about it on the IMDb message boards for Avatar some time ago, since Avatar was another film with Sam Worthngton. I remember it looking pretty interesting, however I'd not heard about it for some time after due to the delays. However during July, it had gotten advertised more, and I was ready to mark down August 31st as a ""must see"" date. However when I got a pass in an Alliance Films giveaway, I was excited.And thankfully this movie did not disappoint. The movie comes out next week, I'd say go see it.A remake of the 2007 Israeli flick of the same name, which I'll admit to having not seen, The Debt follows two of three secret agents who went on a mission to capture the surgeon of Birkneau, and bring him to Israel to expose him for the crimes he committed against Jewish humanity during WWII. His horrifying experiments have left thousands dead in brutal and gory ways. The gang had a plan set in place, and according to a new book written about the ordeal, the mission was completed. However, something about the mission has come back to haunt them... And futhermore, that very some 30 years later, thing has the two remaining agents fearing for what happens next in life!I don't want to give too much away, because believe me, the nervousness and suspense I felt throughout the movie is unmatched by any other film I saw this year. Believe me, this film is insanely well written. Matthew Vaughn of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class fame wrote the script, and boy you can tell he did. His charm and genius are all over the film, in a different fashion than the two mentioned films, but his clever writing style is there. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the turn of events is clever. There's loads of suspense throughout the film. Seriously, not one scene had me feeling calm at all. The film was  high octane, ferociously suspenseful thrill ride that had me on the edge of my seat from the first frame.The film also has a great ability to surprise people, and believe me, this movie is filled to the brim with surprise and intrigue. The film's central twist is especially shocking. Believe me, the movie definitely toys with your expectations and perception of events in pretty much every way possible. But the central twist is especially a shocker, as it completely comes out of nowhere and strikes you blindly. At the screening, you could feel everyone tense up, and especially as the film reaches its shattering climax, the suspense just got more unbearable. However, there is some good Vaughn style humour thrown in there for good measure too.The films' performances are fantastic. Helen Mirren shines as per usual as Rachel, and her young counterpart is not only very pretty but amazingly talented too. Jesper Christensen is amazingly scary as the villain, Vogel, and he does so without any gimmicks. But the real surprise is Sam Worthington as David. Believe me, he really, truly shines here. His portrayal is very convincing, and he manages to prove to the audience that he is not just a pretty face. As well as the film's direction is slick and sharp. madden has a fantastic eye for a shot, and it shows, there are a lot of moments of visual brilliance too, and some shots even look spooky at times.In short, The Debt is the biggest surprise of the year, and a true shiner in a dark age for cinema nowadays. If you would like to watch a movie that for once isn't 3D, for once doesn't force feed you with gimmicks, don't pass up this full tilt action thrill ride. Although I saw it for free at a screening, I would have felt like my money was put to good use if I paid to see it too. Do not miss this film!OVERALL: 10/10Pros: The Debt is an action packed, unbearably suspenseful film that is remarkably well written, stylishly shot and ferociously thrilling, a film not to be missed.Cons: None I can think of...",5,"If The Debt were a book, it would be one bloody page turner",1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,3928,"['saw', 'advance', 'screening', 'Debt', 'tonight', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'film', 'kept', 'eye', 'once', 'read', 'IMDb', 'message', 'boards', 'Avatar', 'time', 'ago', 'Avatar', 'was', 'film', 'Sam', 'Worthngton', 'remember', 'looking', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'however', ""'d"", 'not', 'heard', 'time', 'due', 'delays', 'However', 'July', 'had', 'gotten', 'advertised', 'more', 'was', 'ready', 'mark', 'down', 'August', '31st', 'must', 'see', 'date', 'However', 'when', 'got', 'pass', 'Alliance', 'Films', 'giveaway', 'was', 'excited.And', 'thankfully', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'out', 'next', 'week', ""'d"", 'say', 'go', 'see', 'it.A', 'remake', '2007', 'Israeli', 'flick', 'same', 'name', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'Debt', 'two', 'three', 'secret', 'agents', 'who', 'went', 'mission', 'capture', 'surgeon', 'Birkneau', 'bring', 'Israel', 'expose', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Jewish', 'humanity', 'WWII', 'horrifying', 'experiments', 'have', 'left', 'thousands', 'dead', 'brutal', 'gory', 'ways', 'gang', 'had', 'plan', 'set', 'place', 'according', 'new', 'book', 'written', 'ordeal', 'mission', 'was', 'completed', 'However', 'something', 'mission', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'futhermore', 'very', '30', 'years', 'later', 'thing', 'two', 'remaining', 'agents', 'fearing', 'what', 'next', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'believe', 'nervousness', 'suspense', 'felt', 'movie', 'unmatched', 'other', 'film', 'saw', 'year', 'Believe', 'film', 'insanely', 'well', 'written', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'Kick-Ass', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'fame', 'wrote', 'script', 'can', 'tell', 'did', 'charm', 'genius', 'are', 'film', 'different', 'fashion', 'two', 'mentioned', 'films', 'clever', 'writing', 'style', 'there', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'witty', 'turn', 'events', 'clever', 'loads', 'suspense', 'film', 'Seriously', 'not', 'one', 'scene', 'had', 'feeling', 'calm', 'film', 'was', 'high', 'octane', 'ferociously', 'suspenseful', 'thrill', 'ride', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'first', 'frame.The', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'ability', 'surprise', 'people', 'believe', 'movie', 'filled', 'brim', 'surprise', 'intrigue', 'film', 'central', 'twist', 'especially', 'shocking', 'Believe', 'movie', 'definitely', 'expectations', 'perception', 'events', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'possible', 'central', 'twist', 'especially', 'shocker', 'completely', 'nowhere', 'strikes', 'blindly', 'screening', 'could', 'feel', 'everyone', 'tense', 'up', 'especially', 'film', 'shattering', 'climax', 'suspense', 'just', 'got', 'more', 'unbearable', 'However', 'good', 'Vaughn', 'style', 'thrown', 'there', 'good', 'measure', 'films', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'per', 'usual', 'Rachel', 'young', 'counterpart', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'pretty', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'too', 'Jesper', 'Christensen', 'amazingly', 'scary', 'villain', 'Vogel', 'so', 'gimmicks', 'real', 'surprise', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'David', 'Believe', 'really', 'truly', 'shines', 'here', 'portrayal', 'very', 'convincing', 'prove', 'audience', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'As', 'well', 'film', 'direction', 'slick', 'sharp', 'madden', 'fantastic', 'eye', 'shot', 'are', 'lot', 'moments', 'visual', 'brilliance', 'too', 'shots', 'even', 'look', 'spooky', 'times.In', 'short', 'Debt', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'year', 'true', 'shiner', 'dark', 'age', 'cinema', 'nowadays', 'would', 'like', 'watch', 'movie', 'once', ""n't"", '3D', 'once', ""n't"", 'force', 'feed', 'gimmicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'full', 'tilt', 'action', 'thrill', 'ride', 'saw', 'free', 'screening', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'money', 'was', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'paid', 'see', 'too', 'Do', 'not', 'miss', 'film', 'OVERALL', '10/10Pros', 'Debt', 'action', 'packed', 'unbearably', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'remarkably', 'well', 'written', 'stylishly', 'shot', 'ferociously', 'thrilling', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Cons', 'None', 'can', 'think']",N/A

This is a story about three Mossad agents who fail in their assignment, lie to cover up their failure and the toll that takes on them.  The story line is good and progresses logically.  Every actor in this movie did an excellent job with varying amounts of understatement.  The locations used in the movie were very realistic and set the proper ""feel"" for the movie.I would have given this movie 5 stars, but for two things.1.  When you have a story that requires the use of the same characters at different ages and can't do it with make-up,you need to use actors that look like the same character at different ages.  While the Jessica Chastain/Helen Mirren match-up worked, Marton Csokas and Tom Wilkinson neither look nor sound like they could be the same person.  The same for Sam Worthington and Ciaran Hinds...and Ciaran Hinds is 4"" taller than Sam Worthington.2.  This is the second movie where Mossad agents are portrayed as poorly trained and emotionally unprepared for for their assignment.  When things don't go as planned, the command structure comes unglued and they all get very emotional.  It is very reminiscent of the movie Munich, in which Ciaran Hinds' character died, too.  I can only wonder about why they are portrayed that way.Still, I enjoy ""spy movies"" where the spies aren't supermen driving souped up cars and blowing everything to bits.",4,"Excellent movie, but somewhat miscast.",1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,1446,"['were', 'expecting', 'James', 'Bond', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'story', 'three', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'who', 'fail', 'assignment', 'lie', 'cover', 'up', 'failure', 'toll', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'logically', 'actor', 'movie', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'varying', 'amounts', 'understatement', 'locations', 'used', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'set', 'proper', 'feel', 'movie.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'two', 'things.1', 'When', 'have', 'story', 'use', 'same', 'characters', 'different', 'ages', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'make-up', 'need', 'use', 'actors', 'look', 'same', 'character', 'different', 'ages', 'Jessica', 'Chastain/Helen', 'Mirren', 'match-up', 'worked', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'look', 'sound', 'could', 'be', 'same', 'person', 'same', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', '4', 'taller', 'Sam', 'Worthington.2', 'second', 'movie', 'where', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'are', 'portrayed', 'poorly', 'trained', 'emotionally', 'unprepared', 'assignment', 'When', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'command', 'structure', 'unglued', 'get', 'very', 'emotional', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'movie', 'Munich', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'character', 'died', 'too', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'portrayed', 'way.Still', 'enjoy', 'spy', 'movies', 'where', 'spies', 'are', ""n't"", 'supermen', 'driving', 'souped', 'up', 'cars', 'blowing', 'everything', 'bits']",N/A
1371644,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003Y5H4Y8,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","Helen Mirren has star billing in THE DEBT, and while her performance is yet another in a long line of noteworthy turns..the real reason to see this film NOW is Jessica Chastain.  Chastain, who garnered significant acclaim for THE TREE OF LIFE and then pretty much stole all her scenes in THE HELP, continues her star-making year with a complex, even riveting performance in THE DEBT.The movie jumps around in time a bit, but is never difficult to follow.  We meet three aging former Mossad agents (Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkenson (her ex-husband, confined to a wheelchair) and Ciaran Hinds.  All three are clearly unhappy and we learn pretty quickly that they are carrying a secret knowledge about the time they spent together 30 years previously in East Berlin.  At that time, they were assigned to capture and bring back to Israel a noted Nazi war criminal (Jesper Christensen).  SOMETHING happened during that time.  Much of the film is an explanation of what that SOMETHING was...and then, how the aged protagonists will deal with the consequences when the pigeons return to roost.When the ""secret"" is revealed, it's a doozy because we have been set up very nicely.  But WHAT the secret turns out to be is far less important than HOW the secret has seeped into and poisoned almost every aspect of their lives.  This is a low-key espionage thriller that also serves as an interesting exploration of ethics.  At the risk of revealing too much, I won't discuss what those ethics are...but suffice it to say that when over, audiences of THE DEBT will likely spend more time discussing moral dilemmas than they will on the plot.It's a solid plot, with some very tense scenes set in those early days in East Berlin.  Chastain is the young Mirren, a new agent on her first assignment.  She's eager but very nave.  And very vulnerable emotionally to spending so much time living in a truly lousy loft with two handsome but very different men.  Sam Worthington (from AVATAR, and quite effective in this very quiet role) is the young version of Hinds...he's a deeply reserved man who clearly carries deep feelings.  This attracts Chastain, but his reticence pushes her into the arms of the team leader (Marton Csokas), a far more charismatic and forward man...but also vaguely repellant.  The dynamic of these three is very interesting...and becomes much more so when they capture their prey.  This experienced (and very evil) predator smoothly plays the 3 agents not so much against each other, but against their own inner doubts.  The group threatens to unravel.I think I've said all I dare about the substance of THE DEBT.  But I must praise the very good performances all around.  Wilkinson and Worthington are nice in their roles.  Mirren, not surprisingly, is terrific in a very non-glamorous role...and in the movie's final few scenes, she is quite stunning.  Csokas, looking like a young Russell Crowe, is as charismatic as he character requires, and I look forward to this performance launching him into a stronger career.  Christensen is chilling...the role of ""old Nazi war criminal"" is almost a clich&eacute; in films now, but here is seems freshly creepy.  And Chastain is the emotional heart of the film and she hits all her marks.  Her amazing bone structure grabs your attention first, but her subtle performance makes her the focal point of every scene she's in.  She's a star.So, there are many reasons to see THE DEBT.  It's not perfect...some of the modern scenes in Israel have little spark to their staging.  Occasionally the emotions on display teeter on the brink of melodrama.  But it's a very entertaining, thought-provoking film for adult audiences and I highly recommend it.",4,4.5 stars for this excellent adult thriller with great performances,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,3692,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'star', 'billing', 'DEBT', 'performance', 'yet', 'long', 'line', 'noteworthy', 'turns..the', 'real', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'NOW', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Chastain', 'who', 'garnered', 'significant', 'acclaim', 'THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'stole', 'scenes', 'THE', 'HELP', 'star-making', 'year', 'complex', 'even', 'riveting', 'performance', 'THE', 'DEBT.The', 'movie', 'jumps', 'time', 'bit', 'never', 'difficult', 'follow', 'meet', 'three', 'aging', 'former', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Tom', 'Wilkenson', 'ex-husband', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'three', 'are', 'clearly', 'unhappy', 'learn', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'are', 'carrying', 'secret', 'knowledge', 'time', 'spent', 'together', '30', 'years', 'previously', 'East', 'Berlin', 'time', 'were', 'assigned', 'capture', 'bring', 'back', 'Israel', 'noted', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'Jesper', 'Christensen', 'SOMETHING', 'happened', 'time', 'Much', 'film', 'explanation', 'what', 'SOMETHING', 'was', 'then', 'how', 'aged', 'protagonists', 'will', 'deal', 'consequences', 'when', 'pigeons', 'return', 'roost.When', 'secret', 'revealed', 'doozy', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'WHAT', 'secret', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'HOW', 'secret', 'seeped', 'poisoned', 'almost', 'aspect', 'lives', 'low-key', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'also', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'ethics', 'risk', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'what', 'ethics', 'are', 'suffice', 'say', 'when', 'audiences', 'DEBT', 'will', 'likely', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'discussing', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'will', 'plot.It', 'solid', 'plot', 'very', 'tense', 'scenes', 'set', 'early', 'days', 'East', 'Berlin', 'Chastain', 'young', 'Mirren', 'new', 'agent', 'first', 'assignment', 'eager', 'very', 'nave', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'emotionally', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'living', 'truly', 'lousy', 'loft', 'two', 'handsome', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'AVATAR', 'quite', 'effective', 'very', 'quiet', 'role', 'young', 'version', 'Hinds', 'deeply', 'reserved', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'deep', 'feelings', 'Chastain', 'reticence', 'arms', 'team', 'leader', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'far', 'more', 'charismatic', 'forward', 'man', 'also', 'vaguely', 'repellant', 'dynamic', 'three', 'very', 'interesting', 'becomes', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'capture', 'prey', 'experienced', 'very', 'evil', 'predator', 'smoothly', '3', 'agents', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'own', 'inner', 'doubts', 'group', 'unravel.I', 'think', ""'ve"", 'said', 'dare', 'substance', 'DEBT', 'must', 'praise', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'around', 'Wilkinson', 'Worthington', 'are', 'nice', 'roles', 'Mirren', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'terrific', 'very', 'non-glamorous', 'role', 'movie', 'final', 'few', 'scenes', 'quite', 'stunning', 'Csokas', 'looking', 'young', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'as', 'charismatic', 'character', 'look', 'forward', 'performance', 'launching', 'stronger', 'career', 'Christensen', 'chilling', 'role', 'old', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'almost', 'clich', 'eacute', 'films', 'now', 'here', 'freshly', 'creepy', 'Chastain', 'emotional', 'heart', 'film', 'marks', 'amazing', 'bone', 'structure', 'grabs', 'attention', 'first', 'subtle', 'performance', 'focal', 'point', 'scene', 'star.So', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'see', 'DEBT', 'not', 'perfect', 'modern', 'scenes', 'Israel', 'have', 'little', 'spark', 'staging', 'Occasionally', 'emotions', 'display', 'teeter', 'brink', 'melodrama', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'adult', 'audiences', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

It's a Hollywood production-- a big star in Helen Mirren-- and very well directed so the suspense keeps building and shocks, when they come, are really gut-wrenching.  What the film is about is what the Israelis wish they could have done-- found Josef Mengele and dealt summary justice to him.  So in this film, a group of young Mossad agents are out to capture a Nazi war criminal who, like the real-life Mengele, is a former Nazi doctor.  The movie doctor worked at Birkenau, a death camp where medical experiments were conducted using the helpless interned prisoners as guinea pigs.  There was a real Birkenau and medical experiments really were carried out on Jews and other prisoners, as most people who know anything about World War II are aware.The agents in the film are two young men and a young woman.  They find the Nazi war criminal and set about the process of capturing him for return to trial in Israel.  If I give any more of the story away, you won't need to see the film.  The story has a strong psychological subtext so it isn't all blood-and-guts espionage thriller.  Unlike Hollywood espionage pot-boilers like the &#34;Bourne&#34; series, it presents a far more realistic picture of what agents need to do to carry out their mission, and what can go wrong.  And, it isn't a unique film by any means; there have been other such movies about the capture of war criminals, some more factual than others.  But this one is worth seeing because of the splendid performance by Helen Mirren, and the technical perfection of the film itself, including the somber ambiance.  It's gritty and not for the squeamish.  But if you like psychological thrillers and/or espionage thrillers, even though the story is not particularly new, this one is definitely for you.

But 30 years later, following a lifetime of public praise, the unexpected suicide of David (Ciaran Hinds) leaves the other two members of the original team scrambling to maintain a secret that has haunted them for most of their adult lives.Written by the rising, young British writer/director, Matthew Vaughn, and featuring great performances by Helen Mirren, Jessica Chastain, and Jesper Christensen, The Debt is a spy film for people who favor pictures such as Steven Spielberg's Munich over the latest Mission Impossible installment.  It is a quiet, slow burning tale punctuated by infrequent and yet harrowing bursts of the most intimate and personal violence.  As opposed to many films which seek to provide tidy answers, it asks probing questions about the nature of vengeance, what it means to be Jewish in a post-Holocaust world, and what it costs to fight for the state of Israel.Truly ""great"" spy movies are somewhat difficult to find; and yet The Debt is that rarity.

1371651,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B003Y5H4Y8,Sean Curley,"[44, 51]","Director John Madden had a smashing back-to-back period in 1997-1998 with ""Mrs. Brown"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"", but since then he has been unable to replicate that level of success.  ""The Debt"", a remake of a 2007 Israeli thriller of the same name, is his best film since that period, and deserves a wider audience than it is likely to find in theatres after more than a year spent in limbo due to the difficulties of its distributor.  Madden and his cast and crew deliver a very solid adult-oriented Cold War thriller.  Spoilers follow.Our story takes place both in East Berlin in 1966 and Israel in 1997 (I would estimate the split to be perhaps 70/30 in the favour of 1966).  It opens with a book launch celebrating the exploits of three Mossad agents in killing a Nazi war criminal: agents Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren), David Peretz (Ciaran Hinds) and Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson).  We also see the mission in question, where the trio (played in 1966 by Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington, and Martin Csokas) are tasked to abduct Dr. Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), the 'surgeon of Birkenau', from East Germany.  It's not a great spoiler to say that this proves to be more difficult than originally anticipated.There are no Jason Bourne-style moves here:  Madden's depiction of special operations is very realistic, similar to the writings of John le Carre.  The atmosphere is well-handled, particularly the 1966 segments, which believably depict the decayed East Berlin.  The film's 1966 segments are at their strongest as a character drama, in the middle/late stretch where the three spies and their captive are confined to an apartment and forced to interact for an extended period as their options slowly seem to shrink.The main reason to see this film is Jessica Chastain, who may be the breakout star of 2011, with no less than seven features to be released due to a backlog.  In the past having this many films in a year can be dangerous (consider what 2004 did to Jude Law), but what is remarkable about Chastain's work this year is how different each performance has been so far.  She was an ethereal, idealized mother in ""The Tree of Life"", then a goodhearted white trash housewife in ""The Help""; now, in her first (and, I believe, only) lead role of the year, she plays a rookie field agent with depth and intensity.  She compares favourably to Helen Mirren's portrayal of the older Rachel.  The other standouts are Worthington, at last given a mainstream role where he can show his dramatic skills rather than be bland in an action film; and Christensen, who has a lot of fun as the detestable villain.Recommended.",4,A strong adult thriller with a great lead performance.,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2634,"['Director', 'John', 'Madden', 'had', 'smashing', 'back-to-back', 'period', '1997-1998', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'then', 'been', 'unable', 'replicate', 'level', 'success', 'Debt', 'remake', '2007', 'Israeli', 'thriller', 'same', 'name', 'best', 'film', 'period', 'wider', 'audience', 'likely', 'find', 'theatres', 'more', 'year', 'spent', 'limbo', 'due', 'difficulties', 'distributor', 'Madden', 'cast', 'crew', 'deliver', 'very', 'solid', 'adult-oriented', 'Cold', 'War', 'thriller', 'Spoilers', 'follow.Our', 'story', 'place', 'East', 'Berlin', '1966', 'Israel', '1997', 'would', 'estimate', 'split', 'be', 'perhaps', '70/30', 'favour', '1966', 'book', 'launch', 'celebrating', 'exploits', 'three', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'killing', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'agents', 'Rachel', 'Singer', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'David', 'Peretz', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Stephan', 'Gold', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'also', 'see', 'mission', 'question', 'where', 'trio', 'played', '1966', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Martin', 'Csokas', 'are', 'tasked', 'abduct', 'Dr.', 'Dieter', 'Vogel', 'Jesper', 'Christensen', ""'surgeon"", 'Birkenau', 'East', 'Germany', 'not', 'great', 'spoiler', 'say', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'originally', 'are', 'Jason', 'Bourne-style', 'here', 'Madden', 'depiction', 'special', 'operations', 'very', 'realistic', 'similar', 'writings', 'John', 'le', 'Carre', 'atmosphere', 'well-handled', 'particularly', '1966', 'segments', 'believably', 'depict', 'decayed', 'East', 'Berlin', 'film', '1966', 'segments', 'are', 'strongest', 'character', 'drama', 'middle/late', 'stretch', 'where', 'three', 'spies', 'captive', 'are', 'confined', 'apartment', 'forced', 'interact', 'extended', 'period', 'options', 'slowly', 'seem', 'shrink.The', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'breakout', 'star', '2011', 'less', 'seven', 'features', 'be', 'released', 'due', 'backlog', 'past', 'having', 'many', 'films', 'year', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'consider', 'what', '2004', 'did', 'Jude', 'Law', 'what', 'remarkable', 'Chastain', 'work', 'year', 'how', 'different', 'performance', 'been', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'ethereal', 'idealized', 'mother', 'Tree', 'Life', 'then', 'goodhearted', 'white', 'trash', 'housewife', 'Help', 'now', 'first', 'believe', 'only', 'lead', 'role', 'year', 'rookie', 'field', 'agent', 'depth', 'intensity', 'favourably', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'portrayal', 'older', 'Rachel', 'other', 'standouts', 'are', 'Worthington', 'last', 'given', 'mainstream', 'role', 'where', 'can', 'show', 'dramatic', 'skills', 'rather', 'be', 'bland', 'action', 'film', 'Christensen', 'who', 'lot', 'fun', 'detestable', 'villain.Recommended']",N/A

Her turn as Rachel Singer is Oscar-worthy - a beautiful balance of courage and vulnerability.Her on-screen chemistry with Worthington is breath-taking! Every scene they share is electrifying, and the part where they share a passionate, forbidden kiss is absolutely heartbreaking.But Worthington blew my mind as David. I didn't enjoy his roles in Avatar and the Titans films, though he first impressed me in Terminator Salvation.He undergoes a remarkable transformation here. I have never seen him look more tortured or lovelorn. Scenes with Chastain are sizzling hot, while those with Christensen sent chills down my spine.And keep a lookout for the train station action sequence - it's the only high-octane bit in the entire film, but superbly executed.I now have new-found respect for Worthington's abilities as an actor.

Worthing's character committed suicide by jumping in front of a on coming truck, and the other two hated each other and failed marriage. later in life, by random chance, Helen Mirren's character spotted the bad guy who escaped and after multiple cat and mouse schemes, proceeded to eliminate the bad guy.  the job they failed when they were young finally got done. interesting concept, problem is, it is too SLOW.  this is like a latin american novella where a simple plot takes forever to unravel. if ONLY they made this into an ""Mission Impossible"", get the Brothers Yuan to put in kung fu designs, more the EFX. but NO. so the movie degenerated to become a philosophical debate about right/wrong, moral/ethics.  all delivered in darkness, sad, heavy ambiance. end result is a no fun, self important, pseudo thriller movie.i demand my $7 back!!!!",1,"poor casting, poor plot kill this movie",1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2774,"['very', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'reasons', '1.', 'casting.the', 'movie', 'dream', 'team', 'cast', 'failed', 'due', 'poor', 'casting.the', 'plot', 'casting', 'two', 'actors', '3', 'title', 'roles', 'covering', 'young', 'period', 'old', 'period.however', 'actors', 'playing', 'young', 'role', 'zero', 'nada', 'zippo', 'resemblance', 'older', 'roles', 'indeed', 'people', 'age', 'can', 'get', 'wrinkles', 'pot', 'belly', 'obese', 'general', 'form', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'there', 'movie', 'instead', 'cast', 'Jessica', 'Chastin', 'play', 'young', 'role', 'was', 'played', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'old', 'role', 'Sam', 'Worthing', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Martan', 'Csokas', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'same', 'model', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'had', 'white', 'actors', 'paint', 'black', 'play', 'black', 'roles', 'made', 'slant', 'eyes', 'white', 'actor', 'play', 'asian', 'roles', 'make', 'believe', 'element', 'totally', 'absent', 'especially', 'when', 'plot', 'morphed', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'time', 'old', 'roles', 'past', 'time', 'young', 'roles', 'exactly', 'reason', 'many', 'viewers', 'complained', 'had', 'difficult', 'connect', 'scenes', 'who', 'who', 'story', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'character', 'present', 'time', 'character', 'past', 'time', 'movie', 'particularly', 'seamless', 'casting', 'failed', 'movie', 'telling', 'story', 'when', 'dots', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', 'better', 'option', 'would', 'be', 'Benjamin', 'Butt', 'model', 'using', 'make', 'up', 'computer', 'graphics', 'age', 'character', 'poor', 'casting', 'kills', 'movie.2', 'plot.the', 'story', 'three', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'tasking', 'bring', 'nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'back', 'Israel', 'trial', 'captured', 'bad', 'guy', 'escaped', 'agents', 'concocted', 'lie', 'amongst', 'told', 'world', 'killed', 'bad', 'guy', 'then', 'returned', 'Israel', 'live', 'lives', 'hero', 'adored', 'admired', 'worshiped', 'however', 'three', 'were', 'remorseful', 'experienced', 'great', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'feeling', 'were', 'living', 'life', 'lies', 'Worthing', 'character', 'committed', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'front', 'coming', 'truck', 'other', 'two', 'hated', 'other', 'failed', 'marriage', 'later', 'life', 'random', 'chance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'character', 'spotted', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'escaped', 'multiple', 'cat', 'mouse', 'schemes', 'proceeded', 'eliminate', 'bad', 'guy', 'job', 'failed', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'finally', 'got', 'done', 'interesting', 'concept', 'problem', 'too', 'SLOW', 'latin', 'american', 'novella', 'where', 'simple', 'plot', 'forever', 'unravel', 'ONLY', 'made', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'get', 'Brothers', 'Yuan', 'put', 'kung', 'fu', 'designs', 'more', 'EFX', 'NO', 'so', 'movie', 'degenerated', 'become', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'right/wrong', 'moral/ethics', 'delivered', 'darkness', 'sad', 'heavy', 'ambiance', 'end', 'result', 'fun', 'important', 'pseudo', 'thriller', 'movie.i', 'demand', '7', 'back']",N/A

It was based on an Israeli movie of the same name, which I haven't seen but which I assume was similarly structured in the way that the two time periods (1966, 1997) were handled.  One particular success is the way that the different generations of actors are convincing and credible as their younger and older selves.  We can believe that Jessica Chastain grows older to become Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington to become Ciaran Hinds, etc.  and that speaks to the care in the writing of the parts as well as the skills of the actors involved.  The reservation I have concerns the thirty years we don't see: we do see the anguish of the choice that the younger characters make (to tell a lie for the good of Israel is the way that Stefan Gold, the senior Mossad agent, frames the reasons for the lie), but when the three agents are feted as heroes, there is moral discomfort on the parts of the female agent Rachel (Mirren) and David Peretz, the other agent involved (Hinds).  That moral discomfort is heightened when Rachel and Stefan's daughter publishes a book about the 1966 operation that confirms the heroism of the agents and, unbeknownst to Rachel's daughter, cements the lie.  Revelation of the truth would of course discredit the agents and devastate the daughter, whom we see in the opening scenes at her big publication party.There comes a point where it seems that the truth will be revealed and the question is, what to do about it.  I won't give away the later part of the 1997 story except to say that Hinds and Mirren act their moral conflicts and scruples convincingly, but one does wonder how Rachel, Mirren's character, in particular managed the intervening years.  Especially one wonders how she handled the knowledge of her daughter's work on the book.  Divorced by this time from Stefan (who had impregnated her in the course of a one-night bedding in 1966), and as morally scrupulous as she seems to have become, is it credible that she would have let her daughter build her reputation as a writer on what she (Rachel) knows to be a lie?  David, the most morally scrupulous and most troubled of the three, left Mossad and Israel shortly after the events of 1966, and his guilt seems to have led him to have to seek psychiatric help, but we only hear about that on his return in 1997; it's not shown.  Things from Rachel's 1966-1997 life are likewise not shown.  Mirren is a good enough actor to convince us of her 1997 moral discomfort, but it's her success in communicating that that makes us wonder about the intervening years.

The details of the tale could have only come from her parents, which contradicts reality. The movie reminded me of my dad who told us kids WWII stories. Dad was stationed on a converted aircraft carrier which cruised off the coast of North Carolina. He never saw any action...but we heard stories about how his vessel (USS Solomon) captured a U-boat and how he worked on Ted Williams' airplane. There was a U-boat captured, but not by his ship and he did work on planes similar to that of Ted Williams. My sister believed every word and wrote a paper on WWII for her class based on my dad's inaccuracies. The teacher was a WWII buff and we then discovered dad was a BS artist. Imagine writing a book based on stories your parents tell you and selling it to the world!Helen Mirren is a great actress and basically if she is in it, I am willing to watch it. The story of the killing, as related in the book is fairly simple. The Nazi was captured and tied up. He got loose, attacked Rachel Singer (Helen), gave her a facial scar and fled. As she was laying there in her own blood, she manages to pull out a small hand gun and shoot the fleeing Nazi in the back, from a considerable distance in my opinion, and kill him. But is that how it happened? That is what the movie is about. Jessica Chastain plays the young Rachel Singer as she teams up in Berlin with Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas to bring the evil Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) to justice. As it turns out Dieter is now a gynecologist, so guess which of the three spies stages visits with him?The film moves slow in many scenes. Helen Mirren is her classy self. I thought Jessica Chastain did an excellent job in her role which got better as the movie progressed. Marton Csokas has a good scene toward the end of the film and Sam Worthington should stick to Avatar. You want to watch the film to see how things play out...which is to say I liked how things progressed but I wasn't overly pleased with the ending. 4 1/2 starsF-bomb, no nudity.",5,THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE...,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2110,"['young', 'woman', 'written', 'book', 'brave', 'parents', 'who', 'captured', 'killed', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'details', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'come', 'parents', 'reality', 'movie', 'reminded', 'dad', 'who', 'told', 'kids', 'WWII', 'stories', 'Dad', 'was', 'stationed', 'converted', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'cruised', 'coast', 'North', 'Carolina', 'never', 'saw', 'action', 'heard', 'stories', 'how', 'vessel', 'USS', 'Solomon', 'captured', 'U-boat', 'how', 'worked', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'airplane', 'was', 'U-boat', 'captured', 'not', 'ship', 'did', 'work', 'planes', 'similar', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'sister', 'believed', 'word', 'wrote', 'paper', 'WWII', 'class', 'based', 'dad', 'inaccuracies', 'teacher', 'was', 'WWII', 'buff', 'then', 'discovered', 'dad', 'was', 'BS', 'artist', 'Imagine', 'writing', 'book', 'based', 'stories', 'parents', 'tell', 'selling', 'world', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'great', 'actress', 'basically', 'am', 'willing', 'watch', 'story', 'killing', 'related', 'book', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Nazi', 'was', 'captured', 'tied', 'up', 'got', 'loose', 'attacked', 'Rachel', 'Singer', 'Helen', 'gave', 'facial', 'scar', 'fled', 'was', 'laying', 'there', 'own', 'blood', 'pull', 'out', 'small', 'hand', 'gun', 'shoot', 'fleeing', 'Nazi', 'back', 'considerable', 'distance', 'opinion', 'kill', 'how', 'happened', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'young', 'Rachel', 'Singer', 'up', 'Berlin', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'bring', 'evil', 'Dieter', 'Vogel', 'Jesper', 'Christensen', 'justice', 'out', 'Dieter', 'now', 'gynecologist', 'guess', 'three', 'spies', 'visits', 'film', 'moves', 'slow', 'many', 'scenes', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'classy', 'self', 'thought', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'role', 'got', 'better', 'movie', 'progressed', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'good', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'should', 'stick', 'Avatar', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'play', 'out', 'say', 'liked', 'how', 'things', 'progressed', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'pleased', 'ending', '4', '1/2', 'starsF-bomb', 'nudity']",N/A

What if that lie had become big enough to destroy not only your reputation, but those of your accomplices and your only daughter?Rachel Singer (played by Jessica Chastain as a young Mossad agent with no field experience in 1966 and by Helen Mirren in 1997 as a hardened veteran scarred by her past) is tasked with assisting two experienced operatives in the apprehension of a Nazi war criminal so that he may be tried and, in all likelihood, executed in Israel. Her colleagues are two men she'd never met named David Peretz (Sam Worthington in 1966 and Cirian Hinds in '97) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas in `66 and Tom Wilkinson in '97). Their target is Dieter Vogel, (played by Jesper Christensen) a man given the moniker ""the Surgeon of Birkenau"". And when we first learn of the mission we are shown Rachel (Chastain) unable to prevent Vogel's escape and shooting him after being beaten and cut in her confrontation with Vogel. These events were chronicled in a book written by Rachel's daughter and that portion of the book is being read aloud by Rachel at a luncheon publicity event. After the reading she's informed that Peretz (Hinds) walked in front of a truck rather than be escorted to a meeting with Gold (Wilkinson) and an associate of his.Suddenly Rachel is racked with guilt over her part in their fractured relationship. Their falling out was precipitated by her budding romance with Stefan and a shared deception that David could no longer live with. Stefan and Rachel soon resolve to correct their mistakes in hopes of sparing their reputations and that of their daughter Sarah (played by Romi Aboulafia).I love World War II movies as much as anybody does and more than some. There are few cinematic events as enjoyable as watching a sociopath get what he most definitely deserves.

1371664,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003Y5H4Y8,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'The Debt' is based on a 2007 Israeli film of the same name. The basic plot is the same: three Mossad agents, two men and a woman, attempt to kidnap a Nazi war criminal in East Berlin in 1965 and ferret him back to Israel for trial.Of course the main idea is taken from the actual abduction of Eichmann in Argentina in 1960. There are two main differences between the actual historical event and what we see here. First of all, and most important, the Mossad operation to abduct Eichmann, albeit extremely difficult, was possible as the agents were operating in a relatively free country (as compared to the countries of the Soviet bloc). To accept the idea that the Mossad would even consider attempting to ferret a Nazi war criminal out of East Germany at the height of the Cold War, that's something I had a hard time believing. Even the Mossad, I believe, would have considered such a plan as 'too risky'.The second principal difference between the Eichmann abduction and the one in 'The Debt', is that the fictional Nazi war criminal the Mossad agents abduct, 'Dieter Vogel', is modeled on the sadistic doctor of Auschwitz, Josef Mengele, and not the banal bureaucrat, Eichmann. Like the Vogel character, Mengele posed as a gynecologist, performing illegal abortions after the war. The real-life Eichmann proves much more interesting than the fictional Vogel, pretty much a standard Nazi film villain. Eichmann, on the other hand, is fascinating since he hardly fits the mold of the typical sadistic Nazi--rather, he resembled the ordinary German you might casually bump into randomly on the street--an individual one would hardly suspect as the chief facilitator of the Final Solution.If you think about it, it didn't take a whole lot of imagination on the screenwriters' part to come up with the main plot, which involves a true-life, successful intelligence operation, turned on its head. 'The Debt' in effect is an Eichmann-like abduction gone bad. There is a historical precedent for a botched Mossad operation--the Lillehammer affair, where the Mossad assassinated the wrong man in their quest to eliminate one of the leaders of the Munich massacre. That's a more likely scenario than the unlikely events depicted here. While the botched escape at the train station hardly seemed true to life, at least it was suspenseful. But when Vogel manages to untie himself and escape the apartment, the entire scenario seemed a little too convenient. Worse is the awkward denouement, where Helen Mirren playing the middle-aged heroine Rachel Singer, travels to Ukraine and ends up getting herself done in by the Nazi antagonist, only to dispatch him at the last second (and in the nick of time).It's not that I disliked the whole idea of Singer paying off her debt to her country--it's just that I couldn't believe an aging, retired Mossad agent, would take it upon herself to 'finish the job' herself. It's good for the movies but even retired Mossad agents realize there are certain protocols involved in various intelligence missions and one doesn't 'go rogue', especially when one is pushing seventy.'The Debt' is generally well-acted but in the end, I just didn't care about the love triangle which forms the basis of a rather tedious sub-plot. There was also a lack of continuity between the actors who were playing the younger roles and the older ones depicted in the present day.Perhaps what the film scenarists were getting at is that actors in organizations such as the Mossad, which is generally thought of as pretty favorable in the west, are also fallible. The protagonist certainly redeems herself in the end by sacrificing her life but do we really care? The absurd romantic angle grows tedious and we never become truly invested in the antagonist, who lacks a back story and is more a caricature, than a fleshed out human being.",2,Predictable Eichmann-like abduction tale turned on its head,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,3885,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'The"", 'Debt', 'based', '2007', 'Israeli', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'basic', 'plot', 'same', 'three', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'two', 'men', 'woman', 'attempt', 'kidnap', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'East', 'Berlin', '1965', 'ferret', 'back', 'Israel', 'trial.Of', 'course', 'main', 'idea', 'taken', 'actual', 'abduction', 'Eichmann', 'Argentina', '1960', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'differences', 'actual', 'historical', 'event', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'First', 'most', 'important', 'Mossad', 'operation', 'abduct', 'Eichmann', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'was', 'possible', 'agents', 'were', 'operating', 'relatively', 'free', 'country', 'compared', 'countries', 'Soviet', 'bloc', 'accept', 'idea', 'Mossad', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'attempting', 'ferret', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'East', 'Germany', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'something', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Even', 'Mossad', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'considered', 'plan', ""'too"", ""risky'.The"", 'second', 'principal', 'difference', 'Eichmann', 'abduction', 'one', ""'The"", 'Debt', 'fictional', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'abduct', 'Vogel', 'modeled', 'sadistic', 'doctor', 'Auschwitz', 'Josef', 'Mengele', 'not', 'banal', 'bureaucrat', 'Eichmann', 'Vogel', 'character', 'Mengele', 'posed', 'gynecologist', 'performing', 'illegal', 'abortions', 'war', 'real-life', 'Eichmann', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'fictional', 'Vogel', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'Nazi', 'film', 'villain', 'Eichmann', 'other', 'hand', 'fascinating', 'hardly', 'mold', 'typical', 'sadistic', 'Nazi', 'rather', 'resembled', 'ordinary', 'German', 'might', 'casually', 'bump', 'randomly', 'street', 'individual', 'one', 'would', 'hardly', 'suspect', 'chief', 'facilitator', 'Final', 'Solution.If', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'whole', 'lot', 'imagination', 'screenwriters', 'part', 'come', 'up', 'main', 'plot', 'true-life', 'successful', 'intelligence', 'operation', 'turned', 'head', ""'The"", 'Debt', 'effect', 'Eichmann-like', 'abduction', 'gone', 'bad', 'historical', 'precedent', 'botched', 'Mossad', 'operation', 'Lillehammer', 'affair', 'where', 'Mossad', 'assassinated', 'wrong', 'man', 'quest', 'eliminate', 'one', 'leaders', 'Munich', 'massacre', 'more', 'likely', 'scenario', 'unlikely', 'events', 'depicted', 'here', 'botched', 'escape', 'train', 'station', 'hardly', 'seemed', 'true', 'life', 'least', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'when', 'Vogel', 'untie', 'escape', 'apartment', 'entire', 'scenario', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'convenient', 'Worse', 'awkward', 'denouement', 'where', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'playing', 'middle-aged', 'heroine', 'Rachel', 'Singer', 'Ukraine', 'up', 'getting', 'done', 'Nazi', 'antagonist', 'only', 'dispatch', 'last', 'second', 'nick', 'time', '.It', 'not', 'disliked', 'whole', 'idea', 'Singer', 'paying', 'off', 'debt', 'country', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'aging', 'retired', 'Mossad', 'agent', 'would', 'take', ""'finish"", 'job', 'good', 'movies', 'even', 'retired', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'realize', 'are', 'certain', 'protocols', 'involved', 'various', 'intelligence', 'missions', 'one', ""n't"", ""'go"", 'rogue', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'pushing', 'seventy', 'Debt', 'generally', 'well-acted', 'end', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'love', 'triangle', 'basis', 'rather', 'tedious', 'sub-plot', 'was', 'also', 'lack', 'continuity', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'playing', 'younger', 'roles', 'older', 'ones', 'depicted', 'present', 'day.Perhaps', 'what', 'film', 'scenarists', 'were', 'getting', 'actors', 'organizations', 'such', 'Mossad', 'generally', 'thought', 'pretty', 'favorable', 'west', 'are', 'also', 'fallible', 'protagonist', 'certainly', 'end', 'sacrificing', 'life', 'do', 'really', 'care', 'absurd', 'romantic', 'angle', 'tedious', 'never', 'become', 'truly', 'invested', 'antagonist', 'who', 'back', 'story', 'more', 'caricature', 'fleshed', 'out', 'human', 'being']",N/A

The film has terrific twists and turns that nicely keep viewers guessing and on the edge of their seats; did they grab the right person? Will Vogel's taunting trip them up or will one of them do something rash?The only flaws with the film is that the alternating storylines taking place in past and present tends to dissipate the tension as well as the fact that we really never learn what motivated the characters to become Mossad much less take on this mission (beyond the loss of Rachel's mother during World War II in a concentration camp).The casting is terrific though with each actor doing a nice job of tailoring their performances so they seem as if they are playing the same characters. Aging the actors or using CGI to make them appear older would have distracted and pulled audiences out of the film (or at least me) and casting different actors that resemble each other to play characters 40 years later works for the film.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a nice, sharp presentation that's free of over processing. The presentation stays true to the theatrical presentation of the film--the greenish, cool tinge for the scenes set in 1965 East Germany adds to the oppressive look set behind the Iron Curtain. Fine detail is remarkably strong throughout in what was reportedly a 2K high def transfer.The lossless DTS audio impressively presents both the action and the quieter scenes that are dialogue driven.The special features include an audio Commentary with John Madden and Producer Kris Thykier where they alternate between giving us insightful observations about shooting the film, the characters and what they wanted to accomplish to merely describing the action.We get three featurettes including a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, an interview with Mirren discussing her character and ""The Berlin Affair"" which focuses on all three characters, their dynamics, etc.""The Debt"" has some terrific performances and although the structure doesn't always work to the advantage of the film, it's well worth checking out.",4,"Every secret has its price and at some point someone must pay ""The Debt""",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,2916,"['Set', '1965', '2003', 'Debt', 'two', 'parallel', 'stories', 'Rachel', 'Singer', 'Jessica', 'Chastian', 'playing', 'character', 'past', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'present', 'Stephan', 'Gold', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'ditto', 'David', 'Peretz', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'ditto', 'three', 'Mossad', 'agents', 'tasked', 'catching', 'Nazi', 'war', 'criminal', 'Dieter', 'Vogel', 'Jesper', 'Christiansen', 'East', 'Germany', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'present', 'Rachel', 'Stephan', 'David', 'must', 'deal', 'consequences', 'actions', '1965', 'bringing', 'three', 'unwilling', 'participants', 'back', 'together', 'final', 'mission', '.Director', 'John', 'Madden', 'Proof', 'writers', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'Kick-Ass', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Jane', 'Goldman', 'Peter', 'Straughan', '2007', 'Israeli', 'filmThe', 'Debt', 'Hachov-', 'Israeli', 'Hebrew', 'Drama', 'Movie', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'give', 'edgy', 'quality', 'gritty', 'remake', 'film', 'terrific', 'twists', 'nicely', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'edge', 'seats', 'did', 'grab', 'right', 'person', 'Will', 'Vogel', 'taunting', 'trip', 'up', 'will', 'one', 'do', 'something', 'rash', 'only', 'flaws', 'film', 'alternating', 'storylines', 'taking', 'place', 'past', 'present', 'tends', 'dissipate', 'tension', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'really', 'never', 'learn', 'motivated', 'characters', 'become', 'Mossad', 'much', 'less', 'take', 'mission', 'loss', 'Rachel', 'mother', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'concentration', 'camp', '.The', 'casting', 'terrific', 'actor', 'doing', 'nice', 'job', 'tailoring', 'performances', 'seem', 'are', 'playing', 'same', 'characters', 'Aging', 'actors', 'using', 'CGI', 'make', 'appear', 'older', 'would', 'have', 'distracted', 'pulled', 'audiences', 'film', 'least', 'casting', 'different', 'actors', 'resemble', 'other', 'play', 'characters', '40', 'years', 'later', 'film.The', 'Blu-ray', 'quite', 'nice', 'nice', 'sharp', 'presentation', 'free', 'processing', 'presentation', 'true', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'film', 'greenish', 'cool', 'tinge', 'scenes', 'set', '1965', 'East', 'Germany', 'oppressive', 'look', 'set', 'Iron', 'Curtain', 'Fine', 'detail', 'remarkably', 'strong', 'what', 'was', 'reportedly', '2K', 'high', 'def', 'transfer.The', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'audio', 'impressively', 'action', 'quieter', 'scenes', 'are', 'driven.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'audio', 'Commentary', 'John', 'Madden', 'Producer', 'Kris', 'Thykier', 'where', 'alternate', 'giving', 'insightful', 'observations', 'shooting', 'film', 'characters', 'what', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'merely', 'describing', 'action.We', 'get', 'three', 'featurettes', 'including', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'interview', 'Mirren', 'discussing', 'character', 'Berlin', 'Affair', 'three', 'characters', 'dynamics', 'etc', 'Debt', 'terrific', 'performances', 'structure', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'advantage', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

1371669,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B003Y5H4Y8,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[60, 73]","The Debt (an American remake of a 2007 Israeli film of the same name) is best described as a story on two levels.  On one level, it's a melodramatic espionage thriller that takes places in the 1960's, while on the other, it's a mystery that unfolds thirty years later, one that is centered around the events of the original espionage mission.  The film cuts back and forth between these two story lines, with a different trio of actors portraying the three main characters in each story line.In 1966, a trio of Israeli Mossad agents - Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain), David Peretz (Sam Worthington) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas) - are sent behind the Iron Curtain in East Berlin to kidnap an escaped Nazi war criminal, Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christiansen), the infamous ""Surgeon of Birkenau"".  The mission goes awry when, after successfully capturing Vogel, the plan to smuggle him out of East Berlin is disrupted and they are forced to go into hiding while they try to make other arrangements.  It is while he is being held prisoner that Vogel overpowers Rachel and almost escapes, leaving her face grievously scarred in the process.  But Rachel manages to shoot Vogel before he gets away, killing him, and the trio return to Israel as heroes and their mission becomes a Mossad legend.  Later, Rachel and Stefan marry, for reasons that are quite frankly never made clear and end up having a daughter, and David decides to leave.But in the current day (1997) story line, things are more complicated.  Rachel (Helen Mirren) is being honored at a publication party for her daughter Sarah (Romi Aboulafia) who has written a book about her parents' legendary mission.  Already visibly uncomfortable when asked to read a key passage from the book, Rachel becomes even more displeased when Stefan (Tom Wilkinson), now in a wheelchair and from whom she is completely estranged, shows up at the party, a situation clearly set up by Sarah who had told her mother than he wouldn't be there.  At the same time, David (Ciaran Hinds) has also resurfaced, clearly troubled. And we begin to learn that there are cracks in the legend, and ultimately, that the legend is nothing but a self-serving lie that all three have lived with for the last thirty years.I will acknowledge that my reaction to The Debt is in the minority as it was garnered a fair amount of critical praise, but that said, I found myself ultimately disappointed.  I cannot fault the performances of the stellar cast, nor can I really fault the director, John Madden, beyond the pacing problem.  I would probably lay the blame for my overall reaction with the script (the one done for the remake) which was written by Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman.  I have not seen the original Israeli film on which it was based, but in reading the plot summary it appears that some substantial changes were made for this version and that, from what some reviewers say, the original was better.  But that aside, for me the problem with The Debt lies in the fact that it requires some considerable suspensions of disbelief, and that, quite frankly, most of the characters are not particularly likeable or sympathetic.  Stefan is a manipulative, self-centered ladder-climber whose only concerns are his ambitions and his career.  And both Rachel and David are easily manipulated, in addition to forever vacillating in their feelings towards each other, towards Stefan, and inexplicably at times, towards Vogel.  And in their older selves, they have not grown wiser so much as simply worse.The pacing in the beginning is also something of a problem and I actually found myself falling asleep before things finally picked up with the abduction of Vogel. But even when things did pick up, I found myself not really liking it all that much. The characters were so flawed as individuals - and even more flawed as a team - it was difficult to accept the initial premise.  I wouldn't have sent that crew around the corner to pick up a pack of gum, let alone behind the Iron Curtain to kidnap an escaped Nazi.  And the fact that they weren't very sympathetic as individuals made the tepidly melodramatic love triangle subplot more tedious than anything else. I also found it difficult to believe that Vogel would've left Rachel alive before fleeing the apartment.  Or that any competent intelligence officer would've simply accepted their story when they got back.It also says something when the only halfway interesting scenes are the ones with the Nazi doctor, even when written as it is in the The Debt as something of a cliche. For that I'd have to credit the actor - Jesper Christensen - who manages to at least make his repellant doctor fascinating to watch - much like a particularly vicious caged rat - even if you've seen the basic character in countless movies before and the dialogue is just variations on the same old theme.  That Christensen's Vogel, even with the clich&eacute;s, was about the only thing in The Debt worth seeing, says a lot about the rest of the film.  As does the fact that even having Vogel for contrast does not make the ostensible heroes particularly sympathetic.Again, I recognize that my opinion is a minority one.  If you read a review by someone you trust and they say see it, then go ahead.  For myself though, I'd say The Debt is okay if you don't go in expecting much and if you can wade through the ramped-up self-inflicted angst the main characters wallow in for most of the movie.",3,A
