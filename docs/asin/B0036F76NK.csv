1328076,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0036F76NK,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","Over this past decade I've had the privilege of adopting a new term when describing certain films; pure.  Not very many films can achieve this specific title, because it takes something extra special to tap into that very human quality needed to display moments of such purity.  This isn't to be confused with another term I enjoy bestowing upon deserving films, `organic', which is similar but not the same thing.  No, this decade I can think of very few films that deserve to be defined as `pure'.  `Lost in Translation' and `Once' instantly come to mind.You can add '35 Rhums' to that list.'35 Rhums' is not a film for everyone.  As I can see from some reviews (here and on other sites as well), the nature of this film is not one that will appeal to everyone.  It is slow and there doesn't seem to be a definite plot (since this is far more of an internal and emotional film than one needing any defined structure).  I think too, this is such an exclusive theme that one kind of has to be a part of it to understand it fully.  Now I have not seen the 1949 Asian film from which this film was inspired (Ozu's `Banshun' or `Late Spring') but I am intrigued now and will certainly attempt to get my hands on it.  That film, as well as '35 Rhums', deals very particularly with the father/daughter dynamic.In '35 Rhums' we are introduced (rather casually, as is the nature of this beautiful film) to Lionel, an aging train conductor who is a widower and currently residing with his daughter, Josephine.  The film basically lays right there, allowing the audience to observe them as they interact and as situations within their lives move them to grow as individuals.  Lionel needs to let go and allow his daughter to gain some independence.  This is something that will be difficult for Lionel, but through interactions with others he comes to an understanding of the importance of the eventualities of life.What is so amazing about this film is that nothing is really defined.  We gather the dynamics of the relationship between Lionel and Josephine through pure observation.  Nothing is outlined and or fed to us.  I think that is also the biggest complaint for many people.  They have to really pay attention to understand the layers of this film.  Because nothing is made `black and white' for us, it could be easy to dismiss this film as pointless, but that would be a grave misunderstanding.It is life at its purist.That isn't to say that there are no indications of the films central theme and moral.  Director Claire Denis beautifully weaves in clues as to the emotional contemplations of her characters.  By subtly yet profoundly weaving in a storyline concerning a retired co-worker of Lionel's, she underlines the loneliness that comes from aging; that separation from those around him and the fear that it instills.The performances here are all beautifully connected.  Every character understands their place.  We are not given too much information about each person.  We simply observe their relationships and draw our own conclusions, which is a nice change of pace from the average film.  Alex Descas and Mati Diop are beautifully matched as father and daughter, showcasing a tender and affectionate relationship that hints at layers of frustration.  While they are undoubtedly connected they also subconsciously understand that they are holding one another back.  My favorite performance here comes from Nicole Dogue.  Her handling of Gabrielle is just plain beautiful.  She has the right amount of flirtatious concern that allows her to become that character we can never shake from our minds.  We can feel the pain that brims under the surface as she realizes she can never be all that she aspires to become.I urge you to take a look at this masterpiece.  Breathe it in and let is rest on your heart.  This is one of the most beautifully moving films I've seen this decade; a powerfully understanding film that continues to haunt me the more I think of it.",5,A shot of life...,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,3973,"['past', 'decade', ""'ve"", 'had', 'privilege', 'adopting', 'new', 'term', 'when', 'describing', 'certain', 'films', 'pure', 'Not', 'very', 'many', 'films', 'can', 'achieve', 'specific', 'title', 'something', 'extra', 'special', 'tap', 'very', 'human', 'quality', 'needed', 'display', 'moments', 'such', 'purity', ""n't"", 'be', 'confused', 'term', 'enjoy', 'bestowing', 'deserving', 'films', 'organic', 'similar', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'No', 'decade', 'can', 'think', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'deserve', 'be', 'defined', 'pure', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Once', 'instantly', 'come', 'mind.You', 'can', 'add', ""'35"", 'Rhums', 'list', 'Rhums', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'reviews', 'here', 'other', 'sites', 'well', 'nature', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'slow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'definite', 'plot', 'far', 'more', 'internal', 'emotional', 'film', 'one', 'needing', 'defined', 'structure', 'think', 'too', 'such', 'exclusive', 'theme', 'one', 'kind', 'be', 'part', 'understand', 'fully', 'Now', 'have', 'not', 'seen', '1949', 'Asian', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'inspired', 'Ozu', 'Banshun', 'Late', 'Spring', 'am', 'intrigued', 'now', 'will', 'certainly', 'attempt', 'get', 'hands', 'film', 'as', 'well', ""'35"", 'Rhums', 'deals', 'very', 'particularly', 'father/daughter', 'dynamic.In', 'Rhums', 'are', 'introduced', 'rather', 'casually', 'nature', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Lionel', 'aging', 'train', 'conductor', 'who', 'widower', 'currently', 'residing', 'daughter', 'Josephine', 'film', 'basically', 'right', 'there', 'allowing', 'audience', 'observe', 'interact', 'situations', 'lives', 'move', 'grow', 'individuals', 'Lionel', 'let', 'go', 'allow', 'daughter', 'gain', 'independence', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'Lionel', 'interactions', 'others', 'understanding', 'importance', 'eventualities', 'life.What', 'so', 'amazing', 'film', 'nothing', 'really', 'defined', 'gather', 'dynamics', 'relationship', 'Lionel', 'Josephine', 'pure', 'observation', 'Nothing', 'outlined', 'fed', 'think', 'also', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'understand', 'layers', 'film', 'nothing', 'made', 'black', 'white', 'could', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'film', 'pointless', 'would', 'be', 'grave', 'misunderstanding.It', 'life', 'purist.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'indications', 'films', 'central', 'theme', 'moral', 'Director', 'Claire', 'Denis', 'beautifully', 'clues', 'emotional', 'contemplations', 'characters', 'subtly', 'yet', 'profoundly', 'weaving', 'storyline', 'concerning', 'retired', 'co-worker', 'Lionel', 'loneliness', 'aging', 'separation', 'fear', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'beautifully', 'connected', 'character', 'place', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'person', 'simply', 'observe', 'relationships', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'average', 'film', 'Alex', 'Descas', 'Mati', 'Diop', 'are', 'beautifully', 'matched', 'father', 'daughter', 'showcasing', 'tender', 'affectionate', 'relationship', 'layers', 'frustration', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'connected', 'also', 'subconsciously', 'understand', 'are', 'holding', 'one', 'back', 'favorite', 'performance', 'here', 'Nicole', 'Dogue', 'handling', 'Gabrielle', 'just', 'plain', 'beautiful', 'right', 'amount', 'flirtatious', 'concern', 'become', 'character', 'can', 'never', 'shake', 'minds', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'surface', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'become.I', 'urge', 'take', 'look', 'masterpiece', 'Breathe', 'let', 'rest', 'heart', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decade', 'powerfully', 'understanding', 'film', 'haunt', 'more', 'think']",N/A

What do they want?These questions were going through my mind for most of this film.  I don't mind films that get off to a slow start, but this one got off to no start:  they had no story.Worse, the whole thing was like an Emily Dickinson poem, in the sense that you got the sense the director was daring you to guess what the theme of the movie was.  Incest?  Adultery?  I knew nothing, nothing about this film before starting it other than that critics loved it.  Had no idea what the theme was.  Spent the entire film trying to guess what they were trying to get at.One thing I concluded was that the director had no idea, either.  Sheesh, what incompetent direction.  Notice how, for example, when the chick is walking through the parking structure, he uses ""monster-cam"" behind her head to create a sense of foreboding?  For a long time I wasn't sure if this was going to be serial killer film or what.  It's not that I'm dumb:  it's just a question of one incompetent miscue after another on the part of the director.  For the first 40 minutes or so of the film, I thought that the father and his daughter were husband and wife.  If that wasn't intentional on the part of the director, then there is something wrong with the director.Mind you, whoever recorded and mixed the sound knew what they were doing.

1328079,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,B0036F76NK,Margaret Opine,"[0, 0]","UPDATED REVIEW: I had to watch it twice to truly see what everyone else was talking about it being a warm father-daughter story. It is a warm father-daughter story but the first time I thought it to be an inferred suggestion of something else. *I came to realize that my incorrect interpretation was because fathers are not always like the one in the movie though many try to be and hope to be and it depends upon the culture. Where I came from the culture would have frown on this story, as it is.I had written an angry review believing that the story was something else but after watching it twice the story is a ""coming of age story""; a daughter's time to leave the nest but she doesn't want to go because she doesn't want to leave her father but her father has a woman next door that is waiting in the wings for him, for a life with him...when he is through parenting and when his daughter has left the nest and safely has been launched into her independent life; there is a neighbor next door waiting to marry her but she is reluctant.  YOU SEE, she lost her mother when she was little and so she has only one parent and she is distant from her maternal grandmother and family.  She basically has no other family other than the family in the building: the woman who took care of her when she was little who wants to marry her father and the  man who wants to marry her. That's her family. She basically clings to her father. She wants to take care of him but he wants her to go free.*THE PERFORMANCES ARE SUPERB. Slow-moving,(very), not much dialogue, the actors had to carry the day and they did extremely well; the characters were real, their homes and lives are real--you become a tenant in the building and you join them in their world. THE BACKGROUND SHOTS were just so inviting; you feel as though you have taken flight to parts of Paris and Germany.This is a guild film, low budget. A chance to work with a favored director. Be sure and go to the special features for an interview with the director.--Margaret OpineUPDATE #2 July 20,2012...The principality about this (film) is this: It seems absolutely normal and ordinary but it has a powerful story that is quietly delivered unobtrusively but I had a problem with the father-daughter relationship from the beginning but I took that review down as a misguided interpretation so then I watch the film again and I see Lionel's misconduct regarding ""Gabrielle"" at the cafe. Lionel was not a gentleman. He boldly pursues another woman in front of G and then stays the night out with the woman, the proprietor of the restuarant. (This is highly inferred.) That breaks G's heart, of course. She's dreaming of the day when she and Lionel will be together, she wrote Lionel a letter about her feelings. (I'm thinking...is that how Lionel wants his daughter treated by her man? Of course not!) So why is he bahaving like that in front of his daughter who did not want her boyfriend to kiss her in front of her father?  She curbed her sexual behavior in front of her dad but he behaved poorly in front of her plus: Lionet is purposely shown to be crude when he is sitting on the neighbor's crouch, having been given the key in case of emergency while he was away on vacation. There was an emergency; he went in and while he was there he behaved crudely and the director did that deliberately...to say what?  Lionel is crude; he is not 'just a nice,loving dad'; he is crude and rude.  And, just to be clear, there is nothing in this film that says Lionel was married to his daughter's mother. It does say the daughter was impressed by him and thought her mother would be impressed too. Maybe she was a an affair. And how did she die--?--the script doesn't tell us. The script does not tell us a lot about these people yet we feel we know them. It's like they are pieces and parts of us. Maybe that is what the director hoped to do.",4,WATCHED IT TWICE TO GET THE STORY....,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,3884,"['UPDATED', 'REVIEW', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'truly', 'see', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'talking', 'being', 'warm', 'father-daughter', 'story', 'warm', 'father-daughter', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'be', 'inferred', 'suggestion', 'something', 'else', '*I', 'came', 'realize', 'incorrect', 'interpretation', 'was', 'fathers', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'one', 'movie', 'many', 'try', 'be', 'hope', 'be', 'culture', 'Where', 'came', 'culture', 'would', 'have', 'frown', 'story', 'had', 'written', 'angry', 'review', 'believing', 'story', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'watching', 'twice', 'story', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'daughter', 'time', 'leave', 'nest', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'father', 'father', 'woman', 'next', 'door', 'waiting', 'wings', 'life', 'when', 'parenting', 'when', 'daughter', 'left', 'nest', 'safely', 'been', 'launched', 'independent', 'life', 'neighbor', 'next', 'door', 'waiting', 'marry', 'reluctant', 'YOU', 'SEE', 'lost', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'so', 'only', 'one', 'parent', 'distant', 'maternal', 'grandmother', 'family', 'basically', 'other', 'family', 'other', 'family', 'building', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'who', 'marry', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'marry', 'family', 'basically', 'clings', 'father', 'take', 'care', 'go', 'free', '*THE', 'PERFORMANCES', 'ARE', 'SUPERB', 'Slow-moving', 'very', 'not', 'much', 'dialogue', 'actors', 'had', 'carry', 'day', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'homes', 'lives', 'are', 'real', 'become', 'tenant', 'building', 'join', 'world', 'BACKGROUND', 'SHOTS', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'inviting', 'feel', 'have', 'taken', 'flight', 'parts', 'Paris', 'Germany.This', 'guild', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'chance', 'work', 'favored', 'director', 'Be', 'sure', 'go', 'special', 'features', 'interview', 'director.', 'Margaret', 'OpineUPDATE', '2', 'July', '20,2012', 'principality', 'film', 'absolutely', 'normal', 'ordinary', 'powerful', 'story', 'quietly', 'delivered', 'unobtrusively', 'had', 'problem', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'took', 'review', 'down', 'misguided', 'interpretation', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'see', 'Lionel', 'misconduct', 'regarding', 'Gabrielle', 'cafe', 'Lionel', 'was', 'not', 'gentleman', 'boldly', 'woman', 'front', 'G', 'then', 'night', 'out', 'woman', 'proprietor', 'restuarant', 'highly', 'inferred', 'G', 'heart', 'course', 'dreaming', 'day', 'when', 'Lionel', 'will', 'be', 'together', 'wrote', 'Lionel', 'letter', 'feelings', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'how', 'Lionel', 'daughter', 'treated', 'man', 'course', 'not', 'So', 'why', 'bahaving', 'front', 'daughter', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'boyfriend', 'kiss', 'front', 'father', 'curbed', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'front', 'dad', 'behaved', 'poorly', 'front', 'plus', 'Lionet', 'purposely', 'shown', 'be', 'crude', 'when', 'sitting', 'neighbor', 'crouch', 'having', 'been', 'given', 'key', 'case', 'emergency', 'was', 'away', 'vacation', 'was', 'emergency', 'went', 'was', 'there', 'behaved', 'crudely', 'director', 'did', 'deliberately', 'say', 'what', 'Lionel', 'crude', 'not', ""'just"", 'nice', 'loving', 'dad', 'crude', 'rude', 'just', 'be', 'clear', 'nothing', 'film', 'Lionel', 'was', 'married', 'daughter', 'mother', 'say', 'daughter', 'was', 'impressed', 'thought', 'mother', 'would', 'be', 'impressed', 'too', 'Maybe', 'was', 'affair', 'how', 'did', 'die', 'script', ""n't"", 'tell', 'script', 'not', 'tell', 'lot', 'people', 'yet', 'feel', 'know', 'are', 'pieces', 'parts', 'Maybe', 'what', 'director', 'hoped', 'do']",N/A

Taxi driver Gabrielle (Nicole Dogus) and world traveler Noe (Gregoire Colin) are close, long-time neighbors. Denis doesn't force a single moment between the four, who have been friends for years, but are now forced with confronting buried emotions that, once unearthed, buzz like an electric wire.Descas is terrific as the brooding Lionel, who covets and judges and speaks more with his eyes than his . Originally from West Africa, he appears to have learned stoicism as a means of surviving in Europe.  Josephine is the apple hanging close to the tree, both in temperament and worldview. Their scenes together are tender - with a hint of tension. It boils over one night at an African caf&eacute; as two characters dance to the Commodores. Later, father and daughter take a trip that serves as Lionel's admittance that  Jo is smart, capable and pretty, and bound for a life apart from him.Politics sit in the foreground - Jo is an economics student debating slavery reparations and the global economy - but Denis acutely juxtaposes those academic debates with captures of working-class life: A low-key retirement party for one of Lionel's suddenly-rootless co-workers; a bowl of hot soup at lunch; and the title scene, where Lionel drowns his happiness? pain? in quick gulps of cheap booze, to the tinkling of a jazz piano.
