Congrats to the production team and talent for addressing this important issue. However, I think, certain scenes and interactions of the Actors were missing some guidance and directing. There is a lot of talent in this movie and with the right directing, this could have been a very interesting ride. Sometimes, it feels, people are trying to hard, or not hard enough.

All the actors were so good.An amazing story of the transformation of a person who finds out they have HIV and only 30 days to live. I think the obvious discussion on this movie is what it says about our health care system, the FDA, our government. Before I get to that, I just want to comment on that transformation. Matthew played this role so well, he was truly amazing. I loved how much his character changed throughout the movie. Before you say well yeah he was given 30 days to live, of course he changed.. I think we all know people who get a sentence like that and either give up or ignore it. Really inspiring character, loved the transformation.Then there is the FDA in this movie. Wow. I don't think of myself as someone who believes every conspiracy theory about the government, but the story told in this movie is one I have always struggled with. I DO believe that some pharmaceutical company out there has the cure for cancer, or AIDS, or something sitting on their shelf. Too much money is made on these diseases. Big pharm and the health care system make too much money on cancer, AIDS, and countless other &#34;incurables&#34;. If I was told I had an incurable disease with X amount of time left.

A very real human drama, set in an era of historical significance for our country, the Dallas Buyers Club expands your mind and leaves you with a new understanding.Matthew Mconaughey and Jered Leto's performances were incredible! Not only the physical changes - incredible weight loss for each for this film - but the way each immersed themselves in their characters.Prior to watching this movie I was not aware that it was based on a true story.  I was also not aware that 'buyers clubs' were apparently springing up in several states as a result of AZT being the only FDA approved treatment for AIDS in the mid 80's.My brother died of AIDs in 1989, making this subject close to my heart.  1993's 'Philadelphia' addressed AIDS in a different way - as something attacking the gay community.  The Dallas Buyers Club shows AIDS from a different perspective - a straight man who had unprotected sex with multiple partners, who out of a desperate desire to survive, discovers a course of treatment that works.  It's not federally approved, and thus, he has to break the law to get it to his 'buyers club' customers who tend to be members of the gay community with HIV and AIDS.  He is not an angel, he wants to make money off of it and initially that's his only desire.

1681661,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00GUO2SKA,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 9]","AIDS was, and still is to a certain degree, one of the most misunderstood and underestimated viruses to ever take root in mankind.  When the first cases started to trickle in, it was dismissed by many and assumed to target certain individuals, many people feeling that it was impossible for them to catch it.  Even today, recklessness and misinformation has caused many to underestimate the seriousness of this disease.  The 80&#8217;s in particular were a rough time for people dealing with this disease.  Misconception caused many to ignore symptoms and then when things were unavoidable, getting the proper care was nearly impossible, and in a way it was absolutely impossible.Enter Ron Woodroof.Woodroof defines rather perfectly the entirety of these issues.  He was a straight man living a reckless life that contracted HIV and then ultimately AIDS due to his substance abuse.  He thought AIDS to be a gay man&#8217;s virus and thus he deemed himself untouchable.  He was wrong.  When he finally came to terms with his desperate situation, he found that getting the medications that would help his condition was harder than it should be, and in the end it became apparent that the drug being peddled to people in his condition was actually making things worse.Desperate times call for desperate measures.&#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217; is that little film that could, that film that no one really saw making much of a stir past the obvious physical transformations of the two male leads and yet it went on to snag six Academy Award nominations and looks set to win at least two of them, possibly three.  When watching &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217; I&#8217;m forced to ask myself what it is that made this so palatable to the Oscar crowd, and I have to say that it is for reasons that make them less than a great movie; sadly.  All of the things that AMPAS loves so much (sympathetic character arcs, simplified facts, stereotypes, underdog elements, broad theatrics) are rampant in this film, which is a sad reality when you get your hands on some of the facets of the true story behind this film.  This could have all played out so differently.Ron Woodroof&#8217;s story is, in itself, rather remarkable.  Given thirty days to live and no real help, Ron was left to his own devises and with what he had, he lived for seven years.  Instead of laying down and dying, like he was told to, Woodroof sought out treatment, both legal and illegal, from all corners of the globe and wound up being a savior to many men and women suffering from AIDS and living without hope of ever really living.&#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217; attempts to tell us this story.My main issue with this film is the direction from Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e.  You can lather on all the elements that make this a poorly written film and yet, with superb direction the film could have floated easier.  Sadly, Vall&eacute;e&#8217;s direction is so pedestrian that the film feels almost dull, boring even, in many parts.  It just sits there, with little to no real presence.  It is also tonally inconsistent, and I blame Vall&eacute;e&#8217;s inability to find his footing with the material.  The editing is also choppy (why was this nominated for that?), which leads to a very uneven film that feels like a collection of scenes as opposed to a cohesive story, with many moments that either feel out of place of unnecessary.  And this leads me to my issues with the script itself.  It just feels so flatly underdeveloped.  No real aspect of this story feels wholly fleshed out.  I also was baffled at the obvious &#8216;moments&#8217; thrown in with no real context in order to present seeming character development.  That grocery store scene was so out of place and felt to overly theatrical for the character in question that it failed to do what it intended (show Woodroof&#8217;s growth as a human being) and merely made the film seem lazy.  Woodroof feels in many areas like a caricature, and some of the other players feel either completely vacant of all purpose (Eve) or like an extreme stereotype (Sevard, Barkley).  Rayon, while an obvious amalgam of every transgender stereotype of the 80&#8217;s, is the only character that felt whole to me, but a large part of that was due to Leto&#8217;s brilliant performance.The film has come under fire recently for misrepresenting facts, especially concerning Woodroof&#8217;s persona.  I find this disconcerting, because representing Woodroof as a homophobe turned &#8216;gay rights activist&#8217; feels like a cheap attempt to garner sympathy and, in the end Awards traction.Still, with all this bickering and seeming nitpicking, I can&#8217;t say that this is an awful film.  It isn&#8217;t.  It is just anticlimactic, and a film of this nature (or a story of this nature) needed more than that.  When the film was over, I felt as if I knew very little about the man and his journey, and the dumbed down presentation of the fight for and over AZT left almost no impression whatsoever.  It almost makes me wonder what this movie was even about.  While there are so many serious issues with the law, medicine, healthcare and especially the state of those three things during this time period, this film seems to blanket everything with a black and white &#8216;these are the bad guys, this is the good guy&#8217; perspective that it all feels false.Both Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto have been winning award after award for their transformative performances here, and it&#8217;s easy to see why.  They have very baity characters and have undergone such massive physical transformations to portray these characters that they are obviously being rewarded for various things.  For me, while McConaughey certainly gives of himself 100% here, he never really feels complete for me.  I blame a lot of this on the screenplay, which didn&#8217;t make Woodroof feel like a whole person.  This also was not a stretch for the actor, outside of the weight loss.  He&#8217;s played the charismatic Texas hick before, and aside from a crying jag or two (and I&#8217;ll mention that his crying scenes were his worst acted moments in the film), this feels like a typical McConaughey performance.  Leto on the other hand is actually rather remarkable here.  He completely disappears into this role and finds such nuances of character development, even with a character that wasn&#8217;t really given many moments to fully develop.  The look he gives after Woodroof defends him, the asking of his father for money, the breakdown in the mirror; all of these singular moments are heightened thanks to Leto&#8217;s beautiful performance.So, in the end, I have to express a certain apathy for the film in general.  I just didn&#8217;t care much at all, and the sad thing is that this is one of those stories that we should all care an awful lot about.",3,I'm supposed to care more; right?,1391644800,"02 6,

1681667,A2OLT21YBUKGTC,B00GUO2SKA,Anne Lee,"[1, 2]","Dallas Buyers Club has been nominated for several awards. As a result of those nomination, I purchased the movie. I am not a fan of Matthew McConaughey so without the award nominations, I wouldn't have rented this movie. I usually do not explain a movie when giving a review but a short explanation is necessary when explaining a rating for Dallas Buyers Club. In the 1980s when cases of the unknown HIV virus was new to the United States, the general population thought the virus was only contracted by gays. They didn't know it could be transmitted by IV drug users.. The movie is about a man who was not gay but was infected by an IV drug user. His friends abandoned him. He was not a saint. He found drugs not approved by the FDA but helped to keep him healthy so he sold them to customers who could pay a membership fee for club which gave out the drug.. As a patient, the character played by McConaughey looked for treatment other than AZT. He found he remained healthy from drugs manufactured outside the U.S. and let his &#34;club members&#34; purchase these drugs.  He cared only about himself. If an infected person asked for the drugs he purchased outside the U.S., he only distributed these drugs if the individual had the Club's monthly membership fee.I think the movie was suppose to glorify this man's search for drugs that would treat the HIV virus but he was a selfish man who shared his findings only if an infected man/woman could pay his fee.  I don't know what the viewer was expected to take from this movie. My feelings that after meeting other people who contracted HIV, the character played by McConaughey could have cared about others. The movie showed a selfish man who wasn't ready to accept the death sentence of HIV but wouldn't share his life extending finding unless he was paid. My overall feelings about the main character and the movie was negative. I hope for more humanity. Maybe the movie was realistic but I don't know. I would watch a movie that was inspiring rather than a movie  about nothing more than greed. My review is includes my personal feelings.

1681673,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B00GUO2SKA,Argyle Ronin,"[2, 2]","Matthew McConaughey is unrecognizable as real-life AIDS victim Ron Woodroof. His face is gaunt with sunken eye sockets and his skin is stretched tight over a skeletal frame. Ron's Texan swagger and blunt outlook eclipses McConaughey's laid-back, cool personality.  Jared Leto plays his drugged-out Queen sidekick, Rayon. Both men are HIV patients under the supervision of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), during the birth of the disease when FDA approved meds were non-existant.Ron is a natural homophobe. Before testing positive for HIV, he chases every vice there is: coke, whiskey, strippers, and gambling. Ron is a stereotypical Texan at heart, and works as an electrician and rodeo cowboy during his off-hours. When Ron is electrocuted on the job and lands in the hospital, he learns that he is HIV positive. This burns all ties with his friends and neighbors, who write him off as a ""queer.""During a random check-up with Dr. Saks, Ron meets his future business partner and best pal Rayon, an HIV-positive tranny. They don't quite ""kick it off."" Ron is hostile around his new flamer acquaintance, who he calls ""tinkerbell."" Rayon, already used to this type of derogatory slang, shrugs it off. They soon build a working relationship and join forces to distribute unapproved HIV/AIDS drugs to the local gay community in the Dallas area. This is the start of Ron's new venture, the Dallas Buyers Club, through which local HIV/AIDS patients receive unapproved treatment on the cheap. Ron charges $400 for a monthly membership; this includes meds, vitamins, and patient advice.Ron sets up shop in Rayon's apartment, and soon has customers snaking out of their second-story door, all the way to the parking lot downstairs. People are desperate for treatment. A blaring TV shouts that the government is issuing FDA-approved AZT for upwards of $10K per month. This is an insane mark-up from Ron's paltry $400. Everyone, doctor included, sees the good in Ron's hustle. The FDA catches wind and cracks down hard. All of Ron's drugs are seized and his operation is shut down.The best part of The Dallas Buyers Club is Matthew McConaughey's performance. He is charismatic, unflinching, and dead set on helping his fellow HIV/AIDS victims to treatment beyond government regulation. Small touches like Ron leaning in during a conversation with Dr. Saks over a candle light dinner reveal the character's earnest intentions. Other scenes, like Ron swinging around his IV bag in a rage after being dragged off by security for cussing out an FDA spokesmen at an AIDS support group remain long after the end credits roll. Ripping Rayon's pictures of Boy George off the wall of his office makes for some funny moments.The real Ron Woodroof passed away in 1992, after battling the virus for 7 years. This is 6 years and 11 months more than the 30 days his diagnosing physician told him he would live.

Mathew applies himself to fill the role of real life electrician and rodeo habitue' Ron Woodruff, who is told by doctors  that he has AIDS, and only 30 days left to live! McConaughy's performance is absolutely the most impressive of his career! In the scene where he violently reacts to the diagnosis of being HIV positive,  and storms out of the hospital is one of the most intense of the entire film!  McConaughy soon realizes the diagnosis is all to real as he begins to feel the effects of his failing health. Not only is his health failing, he also has to deal with the harsh rejection of friends who learn about his AIDS problem and quickly shut him out. leaving him feeling more and more alone.returning to the hospital, he is given some drugs for treatment and relief and quicly learns that not only are those drugs  inadequate, but so are the doctors who are treating him!  He begins to do his own research on some of the better drugs being used to treat patients with AIDS  in other country's, but not approved by the FDA in the USA!  So he decides to start smuggling the drugs in and begins selling them to other patients who otherwise would never get them. The doctors learn of this and soon Mcconaughy finds the FDA at his doorstep seizing his drugs and stopping his operation. Refusing to bend to the corruption of the FDA or the government he continues to locate the drugs that will ease the suffering and prolong his life and the lifes of those seeking the drugs from him. All throughout the film we follow McConaughy deeper and deeper into the world of those infected with HIV,how it effects their families and friends, not to mention the surrounding world of health care providers, hospitals, doctors, nurses and the seemingly endless problems that abound from every direction because of it.I highly recommend this film and if more stars were available to rate it, i would give it a well deserved 10!",5,Mathew McConaughy shines brightly in Dallas buyers club!,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,2024,"['give', 'Dallas', 'buyers', 'club', 'rating', '5', 'stars', 'specifically', 'acting', 'effort', 'Mathew', 'McConaughy', 'Mathew', 'fill', 'role', 'real', 'life', 'electrician', 'rodeo', 'habitue', 'Ron', 'Woodruff', 'who', 'told', 'doctors', 'AIDS', 'only', '30', 'days', 'left', 'live', 'McConaughy', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'most', 'impressive', 'career', 'scene', 'where', 'violently', 'diagnosis', 'being', 'HIV', 'positive', 'hospital', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'entire', 'film', 'McConaughy', 'soon', 'diagnosis', 'real', 'feel', 'effects', 'failing', 'health', 'Not', 'only', 'health', 'failing', 'also', 'deal', 'harsh', 'rejection', 'friends', 'who', 'learn', 'AIDS', 'problem', 'quickly', 'shut', 'out', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'more', 'more', 'alone.returning', 'hospital', 'given', 'drugs', 'treatment', 'relief', 'quicly', 'learns', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'drugs', 'inadequate', 'so', 'are', 'doctors', 'who', 'are', 'treating', 'do', 'own', 'research', 'better', 'drugs', 'being', 'used', 'treat', 'patients', 'AIDS', 'other', 'country', 'not', 'approved', 'FDA', 'USA', 'So', 'start', 'smuggling', 'drugs', 'begins', 'selling', 'other', 'patients', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'doctors', 'learn', 'soon', 'Mcconaughy', 'FDA', 'doorstep', 'seizing', 'drugs', 'stopping', 'operation', 'Refusing', 'bend', 'corruption', 'FDA', 'government', 'locate', 'drugs', 'will', 'ease', 'suffering', 'prolong', 'life', 'lifes', 'seeking', 'drugs', 'film', 'follow', 'McConaughy', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'world', 'infected', 'HIV', 'how', 'effects', 'families', 'friends', 'not', 'mention', 'surrounding', 'world', 'health', 'care', 'providers', 'hospitals', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'problems', 'abound', 'direction', 'it.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'more', 'stars', 'were', 'available', 'rate', 'i', 'would', 'give', 'well', 'deserved', '10']",N/A

I did not even notice this movie in the ads here, but I sure did rent it.  No problem, I knew Matthew would likely deliver, and also this movie had a following. The next day it won the Oscar for best picture.What is suprising is the well-documented story on how the FDA can stop actual, regular Americans who are only trying to get simple relief from a terminal disease, or what was terminal then.Yes, the story to me was all too familiar. My co worker and friend died in '83. And even now, people cant even be sure if we wil be ALLOWED to buy simple supplements, year to year. The holy FDA dares to tell the media that THEY are looking out for us. (When do they do that) No, they just want to control a great industry, in order to jack the prices up, and get into the action. And under the table campaign funds from pharmaceuticals, who would compete for dominance, not directly with the FDA but laws must be made to stop the free market. FDA can get paid off though. There are always needs to slip chemicals in, with untested effects, and try to impress buyers -with patents.True, some supplements being sold are cheesy hoaxes. But most of us learn to ask questions, listen to experts, dont take everything as fact. Our dietary needs and help with arthritis, and all other diseases without cures are all being addressed openly, on air and in stores.  The FDA is not prepared to even begin to catch up on the sophistication of the thousands of years of background and continual refinements being done without dirty hands making it expensive and yet profitable for ultra-rich, interested investors. The FDA is already bought out by the food INDUSTRY and the pharmaceuticals. We got sicker and poorer. I have fought health problems most of my life, including chemical sensitivities that almost killed me, left my immune system weak, and only now is more commonly discussed instead of doubted as legit, documented heavily for decades. Pharmaceuticals and foods, and environmental causes are not profitable, no fast bucks here.  But what is allowed to be added  to food and not even labeled is horrific.  Now, its said 80% of foods sold are GMO foods. Fresh foods from the ground and animals we always ate, are now modified to get big freakishly fast, and sit in your fridge for months.  Tested? oh ha ha. Are we ever allowed to just say NO? no. I DIGRESS..the long arm of the FDA is like a horror movie, only we are victims and we are real.At any rate, this movie is a suprise in the story of how some of the best treatments for HIV were not exactly available above capped dosing limits. Other treatments were not allowed to be prescribed or sold in the USA. / Even though they  helped people in agony, dying. The /wrong people were sick after all.This is a wrenchingly well done story to some, if not many of us, who were alive and recall living through of the early days of the HIV scare, when nothing was known and all the hateful separation, blame, and wild rumors on the causes was still pretty common. Some things change, most of our expectations of safe food and affordable prescriptions has gotten horribly worse. The chemical laden farms are industrialized, and so anti-organic. Corn farmers are being subsidized for the corn syrup industry?! and of course, corn syrup has a chokehold on the food industry, and so highly addictive, proven to cause bloated guts, ruin digestion, (weight gain) , AND increase your appetite. Takes weeks of fight to quit. Illegal in Europe. Here, we give farmers bonuses for a crop that needs little help to grow OR SELL. Why not shove corn in Ethanol and not humans.Matthew has an intensely heroic tale to tell as  one of the central people in getting HIV medications to the masses of victims. He was a tough atypical Texan, but became an American hero, when he went on an endless mission to find help instead of hate.He went to extremes to help others, not just himself, to get simple HIV treatments from Mexico to share with people he did not know and did not initially cotton to, and what a story it is. He fought the law. He got busted. He got beaten down badly. He fought left and right, and- changed his own ideas along the way too.You dont need to know much about those times, but the story is important to anyone who ever need unreleased, new medicines to be accessable to those who are terminal or just too miserable- to not take huge risks. (now we can get drugs that cause death, among other side effects, if we have money ) You can not judge the right or wrong of taking massive risks on untested drugs, unless it happens to you, or someone very, very close to you. Even if fear of loss is killing those that surround a patient, the patient is the one who should decide what to try, when to stop.As far as hating goes, there is  the story of hope in this great movie. Matthew brought lots of people into his home and his club, and when his mind was opened in a great, American hero, way, you love this goofball character. This movie sends a great message, with people standing up and being counted when they want a chance at life, cant travel to other countries, and cant afford insane costs.Made me consider that this country never had this sort of wild west pricing until recent decades. when disease is taking over more, and in chillingly more cases, anti-biotics dont work anymore. People walking away from drugstore counters, faces down, cant afford. We never let people suffer or die without meds because they were too expensive.So maybe this movie will remind some, and others will learn just how hard it was back then. The truth that we have a bigger, long fight to get the FDA back to what its PAID to do, to look out for citizens, not the pharmaceutical companies and the top/wealthy ~investors~ in these blood sucker corporations.  Since it IS the government who finances most of THEIR massivey expensive RESEARCH on new drugs. The drug lord-pharmaceuticals act like they deserve massive profits for SELLING the drugs that our tax dollars actually created.  /FIve stars for reality at its worst and its absolute best.

Maybe you won't notice that this movie is crap but I am trying to be a serious actor and make some money.""This film is based on the drug smuggling operation in the mid-1980's, instigated by  Ron Woodroof, described as a homophobe desperate to save himself after destroying his body with  drink, drugs and lots of unprotected sex with prostitutes. Diagnosed with AIDS, Woodroof, played by McConaughey, supposedly, ultimately pitted himself against the callous medical establishment and became the Robin Hood expert of experimental drugs he obtained illegally in other countries, which he then sold to desperate AIDS/HIV patients in Dallas. Given 30 days to live after his initial diagnosis, Woodroof supposedly survived for 7 years by self-medicating and avoiding toxic AZT, then in the experimental stages. Take that all you M.D.s and FDA.McConaughey also tries to sell us an ""epiphany"" to show that Woodroof began to truly care for the tragic parade of gays, transexuals, prostitutes and drug addicts lined up on his doorstep to buy and ingest anything that might save them. The film invents a key character in Woodroof's life, a stunningly beautiful Jared Leto as a drag queen ""Rayon"" , who partners with Woodroof to bring in the gay customers.  ""Rayon"" is completely fictional. This ""epiphany"" never happened. Leto, however, is captivating and the only thing of interest in the film.Admittedly, I have always disliked McConaughey's minimal acting skills, exaggerated drawl , and fascination with strippers, drugs and the seamiest side of life. He must write into his contracts that he gets to drop the F-bomb every 10 seconds. He has become a mainstream ""porn"" star, obsessed with filming his own image thin or buff, and frequently almost nude.  (Check out his male stripper movie to see the buff version if that floats your boat.) Brilliantly, he got more publicity for this movie by getting skeletal than for the substance of the material.  Still, it is impressive how he (and many, many untalented actors and musicians) grasp that repulsive characters and XXXXX rated material will get you great press and maybe some awards. Critics will fawn over drivel and the public will hold their noses to cringe through this disgusting film that purports to be bringing a meaningful topic to light (i.e. desperation of AIDS/HIV patients pitted against the inadequacy of the FDA and the medical profession to provide treatment) .  Instead this film distorts the truth and goes for shock value .  Ron Woodroof and his actions are barely recognizable in McConaughey's re-shaping of the facts.  Neither the real nor reel life Ron Woodroof was anything but a self-serving lowlife, who switched from selling recreational drugs to alternative ""medicines"" for the dying.  Did he actually help or poison these gullible customers.  The film does not address this.  Did he actually extend his own life or was his diagnosis misrepresented? Furthermore, the film presents Woodroof as a tall, swaggering, bull-riding, skirt-chasing bachelor while Woodroof was actually  married, a father, kinda short and mousy looking and reportedly homosexual himself. The homophobic reaction to AIDS at its onset (i.e. opinions they brought this on themselves with deviate behavior) , the terror , loss, and tragedy in the gay community, and the of the slow response of the medical community to find treatment and cures for the afflicted is a compelling story.  I do not think that story was well-served by this film.",1,"Seedy, Seamy,  and Sordid Lives",1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,3618,"['HEY', 'Look', 'here', 'got', 'disturbingly', 'thin', 'say', 'F', 'other', 'word', 'are', 'lots', 'grimy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'movie', 'crap', 'am', 'trying', 'be', 'serious', 'actor', 'make', 'money', 'film', 'based', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'operation', 'mid-1980', 'instigated', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'described', 'homophobe', 'desperate', 'save', 'destroying', 'body', 'drink', 'drugs', 'lots', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'prostitutes', 'Diagnosed', 'AIDS', 'Woodroof', 'played', 'McConaughey', 'supposedly', 'ultimately', 'pitted', 'callous', 'medical', 'establishment', 'became', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'expert', 'experimental', 'drugs', 'obtained', 'illegally', 'other', 'countries', 'then', 'sold', 'desperate', 'AIDS/HIV', 'patients', 'Dallas', 'Given', '30', 'days', 'live', 'initial', 'diagnosis', 'Woodroof', 'supposedly', 'survived', '7', 'years', 'self-medicating', 'avoiding', 'toxic', 'AZT', 'then', 'experimental', 'stages', 'Take', 'M.D.s', 'FDA.McConaughey', 'also', 'sell', 'epiphany', 'show', 'Woodroof', 'began', 'truly', 'care', 'tragic', 'parade', 'gays', 'transexuals', 'prostitutes', 'drug', 'addicts', 'lined', 'up', 'doorstep', 'buy', 'ingest', 'anything', 'might', 'save', 'film', 'key', 'character', 'Woodroof', 'life', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'drag', 'queen', 'Rayon', 'who', 'partners', 'Woodroof', 'bring', 'gay', 'customers', 'Rayon', 'completely', 'fictional', 'epiphany', 'never', 'happened', 'Leto', 'however', 'captivating', 'only', 'thing', 'interest', 'film.Admittedly', 'have', 'always', 'disliked', 'McConaughey', 'minimal', 'acting', 'skills', 'exaggerated', 'drawl', 'fascination', 'strippers', 'drugs', 'seamiest', 'side', 'life', 'must', 'write', 'contracts', 'drop', 'F-bomb', '10', 'seconds', 'become', 'mainstream', 'porn', 'star', 'obsessed', 'filming', 'own', 'image', 'thin', 'buff', 'frequently', 'almost', 'nude', 'Check', 'out', 'male', 'stripper', 'movie', 'see', 'buff', 'version', 'boat', 'Brilliantly', 'got', 'more', 'publicity', 'movie', 'getting', 'skeletal', 'substance', 'material', 'Still', 'impressive', 'how', 'many', 'many', 'untalented', 'actors', 'musicians', 'grasp', 'repulsive', 'characters', 'XXXXX', 'rated', 'material', 'will', 'get', 'great', 'press', 'maybe', 'awards', 'Critics', 'will', 'fawn', 'drivel', 'public', 'will', 'hold', 'noses', 'cringe', 'disgusting', 'film', 'be', 'bringing', 'meaningful', 'topic', 'light', 'i.e', 'desperation', 'AIDS/HIV', 'patients', 'pitted', 'inadequacy', 'FDA', 'medical', 'profession', 'provide', 'treatment', 'Instead', 'film', 'truth', 'shock', 'value', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'actions', 'are', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'McConaughey', 're-shaping', 'facts', 'real', 'reel', 'life', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'was', 'anything', 'self-serving', 'lowlife', 'who', 'switched', 'selling', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'alternative', 'medicines', 'dying', 'Did', 'actually', 'help', 'poison', 'gullible', 'customers', 'film', 'not', 'address', 'Did', 'actually', 'extend', 'own', 'life', 'was', 'diagnosis', 'misrepresented', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'presents', 'Woodroof', 'tall', 'swaggering', 'bull-riding', 'skirt-chasing', 'bachelor', 'Woodroof', 'was', 'actually', 'married', 'father', 'kinda', 'short', 'mousy', 'looking', 'reportedly', 'homosexual', 'homophobic', 'reaction', 'AIDS', 'onset', 'i.e', 'opinions', 'brought', 'deviate', 'behavior', 'terror', 'loss', 'tragedy', 'gay', 'community', 'slow', 'response', 'medical', 'community', 'find', 'treatment', 'cures', 'afflicted', 'compelling', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'story', 'was', 'well-served', 'film']",N/A

You forget these are actors-you feel the pain and desperation of these real people and wish there was some way to save them.Ron Woodruf is a homophobic hard partying cowboy who gets diagnosed with Aids in a time there was little awareness and no treatment. He is given 30 days to live. He is shunned by friends and becomes one of the people he himself once shunned. After frustration with lack of treatment (AZT is the only option and it is actually making people sicker), Ron goes to Mexico and discovers proteins and other treatments that are actually helping people, but are inexplicably banned here in the US. He gets the idea to start a Buyer's Club, where he sells membership and gives people the treatments he brings over. He starts an unlikely friendship/business partnership with Rayon, a transgender drug addict with a kind soul who he first meets while in the hospital. It is a touching scene, Rayon helps Ron with a leg cramp despite having just been insulted by him. They play cards and we start to see a special friendship forming. There is always this feeling of impending sadness, as we know how this will end for these characters we come to care about. The story plays out as Ron and Rayon battle their health, and Ron battles the FDA. We see Ron's transformation as a person. Jennifer Garner is also wonderful as the compassionate doctor who knows Ron is right but can do little to help.I won't spoil the end, but I left the theater with a lump in my throat and many things to think about after. I'm not usually impressed by actors but these two knocked it out of the park. If they don't win every award possible it's a crime-these are two of the best performances I've ever seen, let alone from this year.

I don't know that it's the triumphant masterpiece that it's being billed as but it was worth the $4.99 I paid to watch it.  Whenever an actor loses weight for a role, they make it out to be something more than what it is, as if &#34;well he must be a great actor since he lost 47 pounds for the role.&#34;  I'm not sure I'd go that far.  But leaving that aside for a moment, this is a great story and it will take you back to the bad ole days of the eighties and the nightmare that was our treatment of people suffering from HIV and AIDS.  I wept throughout remembering how terrible it was.  I cannot believe I could have forgotten the battles with the FDA and the fight to get something to treat these people.  I remember how we would scream at the TV, MY GOD they're dying! Let them try any drug they want!  But that's a little one-sided and I think that's where the movie is a little lacking.I'm having a hard time with this review because the movie's flaws are there but in other ways it kind of surpasses the flaws.  On the one hand, they make the FDA and the doctors one-dimensional bad guys, so worried about litigation that they'll let these people die before trying something other than AZT.  Now, with nearly 30 years of perspective, I can look back and realize that those doctors were doing the best they could in a bad situation that was overwhelming and beyond tragic.  I can also say that we were too slow but there are a LOT of reasons for being slow.  One of the reasons AZT was used was because they wanted something to treat these people fast, well fast got a lot of people dead.  The FDA has their flaws, make no mistake, but still these are good and decent people doing the best they can and the FDA does a remarkable job.  So, making them out to be the monsters of the film, ugh, I don't know.  It's just not that simple.Now the character Ron Woodruff is pretty remarkable.  He's not likeable and whenever you get an anti-hero, the filmmakers try to redeem him through the film and they take you on his journey from being a zero to a hero. That's so played.  You get a lot of that here.  The journey of Mr. Woodruff is fascinating and very sad.  I am grateful to have heard his story.  I don't think I would have liked to have met him though.What I got out of this film more than anything is just how cruel we can be as a race. How very unloved these people were and how much we have lost.  I really had forgotten how rotten it was back then.  It's not any better now, I know, but this film really brings it back.

Sadly, his father worked for what should have been the best of all places, a major pharmaceutical company. He believed in the flawed system shown in this film. Watch this for the great acting and the great information.Our access to a variety of supplements and natural products like raw milk and cheese from local farmers is being taken away from us by an FDA/USDA run for the purposes of major drug, agricultural and biotech companies. This film shows one of the many tragic results. When it comes to food and drugs, I believe in informed consent, not bans and fines. Seeing this film will teach you a lot about the dangers of letting drug companies supersede human rights.  If you want more info on the plot, there are many reviews here that give you that. I think it is such a wonderful educational opportunity that I want to comment mostly on the FDA aspect. Please note that this review will likely receive negative comments touting  the wonders of the FDA . There are people paid to do that and I have seen them show up every time big pharma is questioned. I don't get paid to answer them and won't waste my time.I'm surprised that Big Pharma allowed this film to be made. They are THAT powerful. As coincidence would have it, I finally got around to watching it shortly after learning that it had long been known, in another country, that a substance in Soy could treat AIDS. Note that is REAL SOY, not the GMO, ""Round Up Ready"", stuff we have here which is rich in pesticide residue. Why were we not told about this years ago?? Who is REALLY protecting our health and well-being. Certainly NOT the FDA. As this film shows, it only protects the drug patents of major U.S. manufacturers and biotech companies and much of medicine supports it for financial gain.Only last week, the FDA had approved a pain killer so lethal that states are now moving to ban it. How protective of human life is that?? If you don't already know, the FDA with its Corporate Dons, like former policy maker for Monsanto Micheal Taylor, (over food) and  Virginia Weldon (former Monsanto VP for public policy) now on the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee have been running a virtual war on supplements for decades.The reason is simple. Many of them work really well and most are from natural products which have to be synthesized to be patented. If they haven't figured out how to defy nature (the process of synthesizing often has side effects not present in the original) they don't want to see a natural drug that works on the market.  It is also easy to dissuade people from using them because most natural remedies work over time and don't have the immediate punch the pharmaceutical companies like to advertise. But your body doesn't like to be ""punched"". The movie illustrates that very well as the effects of AZT devastate patients in the early trials...This while the medical industry, which benefits financially from participation in these studies...gladly touted their worth...least they not be asked to do another.Symptomatic treatments that do nothing to enhance the body's immune system or replace vital nutrients do not create health. They create drug dependence. In a truly free society, informed consent would be the norm.

What a waste of his talent that was! In interviews he agrees that he was so glad to finally get roles which got him out of those films as well. Although I am losing count of the excellent jobs he has done in the last few years, this may be his finest achievement.  This is because he does handsome and charming so easily in all of his films and for the first half hour of this he is an almost detestable human being. The descriptive phrase ""sexist, redneck pig"" might have been personally coined for him in that first half hour which is saying a lot for the former leading man of rom-coms!This is based upon the true story of Ron Woodroof, a heterosexual in Dallas, who was an AIDS victim in the 1980s, when at best you might buy a few years of life if you had the disease. He manages to get quite a few more by grit and determination plus buying trips to places where he can get better drugs outside the USA.I didn't recognize Jared Leto for the first twenty minutes he was onscreen.  This was because he is in drag most of the time. He makes a very convincing woman.  When he goes to visit his father in men's clothing, it is the most heartbreaking moment of the movie. He does his best work since his supporting role in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.Both actors look like complete and utter wrecks by the time we get to the end.  They must have had to lose a lot of weight. They really go the distance with these roles. I just watched AMERICAN HUSTLE on the same night.  The acting in both is equivalent.  It is hard to say who does better as it is like comparing apples with oranges.I was in my 30s when the AIDS crisis broke and I remember it very well.

It did not disappoint. Matthew M. just gets better and better as he gets older; and I don't mean his looks, I mean his acting ability. Check out his HBO mini-series, &#34;True Detective&#34; and you'll see what I mean. Both he and Jared Leto lost a lot of weight for these roles and they both looked rather sickly, as one might expect from someone HIV/Aids. I read a little bit about the real Ron and it seemed he was even more foul than the character portrayed in this film. I am guessing they decided to tone it down a bit so as to make the audience more sympathetic to the character. And Matthew brought it. You definitely feel for his character throughout this film. Jared Leto perhaps stole every scene he was in. His character, Rayon, was a trip and a half. The scene that nearly gutted me was when he went to his father dressed like a man. I won't spoil this any further. But watch for that scene and see if you had the same reaction. I had no idea who Jared Leto was before this film. He is a very talented man. And, might I add, a very pretty man; which is why he made such a great transsexual woman. As a side note, I'm sure that Matthew appreciated not having to disguise his accent for this movie, being a native Texan himself. And let's not forget Jennifer Garner. She gave one of the best performances of her career in this movie. You start out not feeling sure who her character is, or how she fits in, or how she will evolve. But she does fit in and evolve.

1681790,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00GUO2SKA,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 2]","The fact it supposedly took nearly twenty years to bring the true story of Ron Woodroof to the screen is a somber fact which has not muted its impact over time.  This heart wrenching chronicle of one man&#8217;s desperate attempts against all odds features marvelous performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared  Leto.It is 1985 in Dallas, Texas, and rodeo rider, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), has an accident and ends up in the hospital where he learns he has the HIV virus which causes AIDs, a death sentence which, according to his doctor, gives him thirty days to live and put his affairs in order.  Stunned by the news, which heretofore was a sexually transmitted disease among homosexuals, Ron learns the grim truth about AIDs, a growing global epidemic.  What&#8217;s worse is the lack of any effective treatment even as trials for the experimental drug AZT begin via the Food and Drug Administration.  Frustrated by ineffective drugs and running out of time, Ron takes matters in his own hands and begins to research the disease and travels to Mexico and other exotic locations for possible answers.  He tries drug and vitamin combinations, a kind of AIDs cocktail, and begins to sell these to others.  He even finds a way to circumvent the law forbidding his selling drugs by offering memberships.  Helped by a fellow AIDs patient, Rayon (Jared Leto), his &#8216;clinic&#8217; sees an explosion in membership as his cocktail gains in popularity.  As the FDA and the IRS attempt to shut down his operation, he wages a one man fight against the forces that would close his enterprise and a hope for AIDs patients.It is interesting that the world has come a long way in the treatment and survivability of AIDs, but back then there were severely limited resources.  Also the stigma and intolerance of being gay was more pronounced.  Ron&#8217;s homophobic reactions evolve over time in a very convincing, realistic way, and he is affected and transformed to the point where he even takes on Rayon as an unlikely business partner and even friend.  That relationship, that unlikely pairing, is what makes the story fascinating and at times poignant.That it took a deadly malady to give his a life purpose and definition is the supreme irony.  By no means a saint, he has casual sex partners when he isn&#8217;t snorting cocaine or boozing it up, and when he isn&#8217;t scamming a buck, utters a plethora of profanities when it suits him.  He is a survivor and hustler who proves his resourcefulness in obtaining his drugs and vitamins even resorting to disguises, schmoozing, and legal maneuvering.McConaughey (Contact, The Lincoln Lawyer) lost as much as 47 pounds for this role to depict the AIDs ravaged survivor; it&#8217;s the role of a lifetime.  Leto (Requiem for a Dream) equally excels as the transvestite and drug addict who befriends Ron and provides a window into the world of gays and more potential clients.  Jennifer Garner registers a strong performance as a sympathetic doctor caught between treatment controversies.You almost wish that the filmmakers (director Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e and screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) had expanded upon the machinations of the FDA and pharmaceutical drug companies which held sway over life and death particularly in a standout scene near the end as Ron confronts the FDA in front of an audience.  But this is primarily an intimate portrayal of a rebel, one whose self discovery leads to remarkable action and a profound effect on many others.You do wish some of the plotlines had been more developed.  For instance, Ron&#8217;s police friend, Tucker, has a scene with his elderly father involving a drug; it would have been nice to develop that subplot which figures later when Ron needs help in a sticky situation.The film is a low budget production, but that enhances its realism.  A bittersweet story full of the charm and vigor that McConaughey brings to Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club lingers long after its closing credits as a testament of an imperfect person in an impossible situation who left a memorable mark..",4,The Art of Survival in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,4104,"['fact', 'supposedly', 'took', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'bring', 'true', 'story', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'screen', 'somber', 'fact', 'not', 'muted', 'impact', 'time', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'chronicle', 'one', 'man', '8217', 's', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'odds', 'features', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Jared', 'Leto.It', '1985', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'accident', 'up', 'hospital', 'where', 'HIV', 'virus', 'AIDs', 'death', 'sentence', 'according', 'doctor', 'thirty', 'days', 'live', 'put', 'affairs', 'order', 'Stunned', 'news', 'heretofore', 'was', 'sexually', 'transmitted', 'disease', 'homosexuals', 'Ron', 'grim', 'truth', 'AIDs', 'growing', 'global', 'epidemic', 'What', '8217', 's', 'worse', 'lack', 'effective', 'treatment', 'even', 'trials', 'experimental', 'drug', 'AZT', 'begin', 'Food', 'Drug', 'Administration', 'Frustrated', 'ineffective', 'drugs', 'running', 'time', 'Ron', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'research', 'disease', 'travels', 'Mexico', 'other', 'exotic', 'locations', 'possible', 'answers', 'drug', 'vitamin', 'combinations', 'kind', 'AIDs', 'cocktail', 'sell', 'others', 'even', 'way', 'circumvent', 'law', 'forbidding', 'selling', 'drugs', 'offering', 'memberships', 'Helped', 'fellow', 'AIDs', 'patient', 'Rayon', 'Jared', 'Leto', '8216', 'clinic', '8217', 'explosion', 'membership', 'cocktail', 'gains', 'popularity', 'FDA', 'IRS', 'attempt', 'shut', 'down', 'operation', 'one', 'man', 'fight', 'forces', 'would', 'close', 'enterprise', 'hope', 'AIDs', 'patients.It', 'interesting', 'world', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'treatment', 'survivability', 'AIDs', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'severely', 'limited', 'resources', 'Also', 'stigma', 'intolerance', 'being', 'gay', 'was', 'more', 'pronounced', 'Ron', '8217', 'homophobic', 'reactions', 'evolve', 'time', 'very', 'convincing', 'realistic', 'way', 'affected', 'transformed', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'Rayon', 'unlikely', 'business', 'partner', 'even', 'friend', 'relationship', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'what', 'story', 'fascinating', 'times', 'took', 'deadly', 'malady', 'give', 'life', 'purpose', 'definition', 'supreme', 'irony', 'saint', 'casual', 'sex', 'partners', 'when', '8217', 'snorting', 'cocaine', 'boozing', 'up', 'when', '8217', 'scamming', 'buck', 'plethora', 'profanities', 'when', 'suits', 'survivor', 'hustler', 'who', 'resourcefulness', 'obtaining', 'drugs', 'vitamins', 'even', 'resorting', 'disguises', 'schmoozing', 'legal', 'maneuvering.McConaughey', 'Contact', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'lost', 'as', 'much', '47', 'pounds', 'role', 'depict', 'AIDs', 'ravaged', 'survivor', '8217', 's', 'role', 'lifetime', 'Leto', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'equally', 'transvestite', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'Ron', 'window', 'world', 'gays', 'more', 'potential', 'clients', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'strong', 'performance', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'caught', 'treatment', 'controversies.You', 'almost', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'director', 'Jean-Marc', 'Vall', 'eacute', 'screenwriters', 'Craig', 'Borten', 'Melisa', 'Wallack', 'had', 'expanded', 'machinations', 'FDA', 'pharmaceutical', 'drug', 'companies', 'held', 'sway', 'life', 'death', 'particularly', 'standout', 'scene', 'end', 'Ron', 'FDA', 'front', 'audience', 'primarily', 'intimate', 'portrayal', 'rebel', 'one', 'self', 'discovery', 'remarkable', 'action', 'profound', 'effect', 'many', 'others.You', 'do', 'wish', 'plotlines', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'developed', 'instance', 'Ron', '8217', 's', 'police', 'friend', 'Tucker', 'scene', 'elderly', 'father', 'involving', 'drug', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'develop', 'subplot', 'later', 'when', 'Ron', 'help', 'sticky', 'situation.The', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'realism', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'full', 'charm', 'vigor', 'McConaughey', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'lingers', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'testament', 'imperfect', 'person', 'impossible', 'situation', 'who', 'left', 'memorable', 'mark..']",N/A

1681795,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00GUO2SKA,Darren,"[1, 2]","A bit of the old Hollywood Uplift, successfully disguised as a gritty, downbeat indie.  The immediate subject is the story of a bona fide Texas redneck who contracts HIV in the mid-80s and, frustrated by medical authorities who simply tell him to go write his will, inaugurates a membership club in which, for the cost of $400, Dallas' AIDS victims can have access to all the alleviating medicines they wish.  The larger subject -- and it's an important one -- is the way in which Big Pharma determines medical policy as formulated by agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.  The story is late in coming, though perhaps it will be news to those who have never seen the magisterial film &#34;And the Band Played On&#34; from 1993, which covers the same subject in rather excruciating detail for almost 3 hours.  (The studios dumped it on HBO in America, though it was theatrically released everywhere else.)  If you found yourself interested in the incestuous relationship between the big business of medical drug-makers and their compliant puppets in our government while watching this film, then I highly recommend that earlier film.Meanwhile, now that AIDS as a raging epidemic is considered &#34;history&#34;, Hollywood's studios can confidently release movies like &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34; and expect to win prestigious awards for it.  The Oscars are coming up later this month, and this movie will win its fair share of them.  And, like all Oscar-winners, this one isn't perfect.  I always enjoy admiring beautiful women, but I gotta be honest, the only reason Jennifer Garner is in this movie is because the producers clearly felt that we needed something else to look at besides scrawny bedridden men coughing their lungs out while shooting Peptide-T.  McConaughey's business partner, the transgendered Jared Leto (named, hilariously, &#34;Rayon&#34;), joins that long line of Tragic Queens that have littered mainstream films for decades.  (Can't these people ever have happy endings in the movies?)  And the character of Ron Woodruff himself is not entirely believable, despite the real-life provenance.  While the writers are careful to establish McConaughey as a feisty hustler in the early going, I'm not entirely convinced that his experience with the Small Con naturally translates into the jet-setting medicine buyer and deal-maker that we see emerge in the movie's second act.  In fact, I think the simple act of obtaining a passport ought to have been dramatized.  Because the McConaughey of Act 2 is a world away from the McConaughey of Act 1, who, besides being a hustler, is also a whiskey guzzling, coke sniffing, foul-mouthed, homophobic piece of (literally) trailer trash.  In other words, the writers trowled on the obnoxiousness in gobs.  So many gobs, in fact, that I started to suspect that the movie's depiction of Ron Woodruff is more or less fiction.  Lo and behold, a few minutes surfing the net reveals that Mr. Woodruff never rode in the rodeo, had a sister, an ex-wife, and a daughter, and was probably bisexual, none of which is indicated here.  Apparently, a bisexual man fighting the FDA isn't as interesting ... or as Oscar-worthy ... as a reformed homophobic bigot fighting the FDA.I'm giving this a higher rating than it probably deserves because it talks about an important subject, and also because of the performances.  The commitment of McConaughey and Leto is never in doubt.  In Leto's case, watch his reaction when McConaughey comes to his defense in a supermarket.  The scene itself is Oscar-bait (perfect as a clip after the nomination is announced during the Academy Awards telecast), but Leto's barely-registered gratitude is just so well done that it breaks your heart a bit.  Moments like that are why we watch movies in the first place.  As for McConaughey, his transformation into a great actor is now apparently complete.  Despite the screenwriters' mistakes with the character of Woodruff, McConaughey takes us by the collective hand and leads us into Woodruff's world with confidence and a consistent performance.  (Let's hope he didn't permanently damage himself with that dangerous weight-loss.)  It will be interesting to watch his career going forward: having spent the past few years doing serious work, and now getting recognized for his efforts, what next?  The Liam Neeson and Robert Downey Jr. route? -- bad action pictures and forgettable &#34;superhero&#34; extravaganzas?  He is now, after all, too old for those rom-coms he wasted so much time on through most of his career.  Let's hope instead that he simply continues to participate in interesting movies like this one.  4 out of 5.",4,"A movie with an important, if musty, subject",1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,4667,"['bit', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'Uplift', 'successfully', 'disguised', 'gritty', 'downbeat', 'indie', 'immediate', 'subject', 'story', 'bona', 'fide', 'Texas', 'redneck', 'who', 'contracts', 'HIV', 'mid-80s', 'frustrated', 'medical', 'authorities', 'who', 'simply', 'tell', 'go', 'write', 'will', 'membership', 'club', 'cost', '400', 'Dallas', 'AIDS', 'victims', 'can', 'have', 'access', 'alleviating', 'medicines', 'wish', 'larger', 'subject', 'important', 'one', 'way', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'medical', 'policy', 'formulated', 'agencies', 'Food', 'Drug', 'Administration', 'story', 'late', 'coming', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'news', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'magisterial', 'film', '34', 'Band', 'Played', '34', '1993', 'same', 'subject', 'rather', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'studios', 'dumped', 'HBO', 'America', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'everywhere', 'else', 'found', 'interested', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'big', 'business', 'medical', 'drug-makers', 'compliant', 'puppets', 'government', 'watching', 'film', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'earlier', 'film.Meanwhile', 'now', 'AIDS', 'raging', 'epidemic', 'considered', '34', 'history', '34', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'can', 'confidently', 'release', 'movies', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'expect', 'win', 'prestigious', 'awards', 'Oscars', 'are', 'coming', 'up', 'later', 'month', 'movie', 'will', 'win', 'fair', 'share', 'Oscar-winners', 'one', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'always', 'enjoy', 'admiring', 'beautiful', 'women', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'reason', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'movie', 'producers', 'clearly', 'felt', 'needed', 'something', 'else', 'look', 'besides', 'scrawny', 'bedridden', 'men', 'coughing', 'lungs', 'out', 'shooting', 'Peptide-T.', 'McConaughey', 'business', 'partner', 'transgendered', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'named', 'hilariously', '34', 'Rayon', '34', 'long', 'line', 'Tragic', 'Queens', 'have', 'littered', 'mainstream', 'films', 'decades', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'people', 'ever', 'have', 'happy', 'endings', 'movies', 'character', 'Ron', 'Woodruff', 'not', 'entirely', 'believable', 'real-life', 'provenance', 'writers', 'are', 'careful', 'establish', 'McConaughey', 'feisty', 'hustler', 'early', 'going', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'experience', 'Small', 'Con', 'naturally', 'jet-setting', 'medicine', 'buyer', 'deal-maker', 'see', 'emerge', 'movie', 'second', 'act', 'fact', 'think', 'simple', 'act', 'obtaining', 'passport', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'dramatized', 'McConaughey', 'Act', '2', 'world', 'away', 'McConaughey', 'Act', '1', 'who', 'being', 'hustler', 'also', 'whiskey', 'guzzling', 'coke', 'sniffing', 'foul-mouthed', 'homophobic', 'piece', 'literally', 'trailer', 'trash', 'other', 'words', 'writers', 'trowled', 'obnoxiousness', 'gobs', 'So', 'many', 'gobs', 'fact', 'started', 'suspect', 'movie', 'depiction', 'Ron', 'Woodruff', 'more', 'less', 'fiction', 'Lo', 'behold', 'few', 'minutes', 'surfing', 'net', 'reveals', 'Mr.', 'Woodruff', 'never', 'rode', 'rodeo', 'had', 'sister', 'ex-wife', 'daughter', 'was', 'probably', 'bisexual', 'none', 'indicated', 'here', 'Apparently', 'bisexual', 'man', 'fighting', 'FDA', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'Oscar-worthy', 'reformed', 'homophobic', 'bigot', 'fighting', 'FDA.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'higher', 'rating', 'probably', 'important', 'subject', 'also', 'performances', 'commitment', 'McConaughey', 'Leto', 'never', 'doubt', 'Leto', 'case', 'watch', 'reaction', 'when', 'McConaughey', 'defense', 'supermarket', 'scene', 'Oscar-bait', 'perfect', 'clip', 'nomination', 'announced', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'telecast', 'Leto', 'barely-registered', 'gratitude', 'just', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'heart', 'bit', 'Moments', 'are', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', 'first', 'place', 'McConaughey', 'transformation', 'great', 'actor', 'now', 'apparently', 'complete', 'screenwriters', 'mistakes', 'character', 'Woodruff', 'McConaughey', 'collective', 'hand', 'Woodruff', 'world', 'confidence', 'consistent', 'performance', 'Let', 'hope', 'did', ""n't"", 'permanently', 'damage', 'dangerous', 'weight-loss', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'watch', 'career', 'going', 'forward', 'having', 'spent', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'doing', 'serious', 'work', 'now', 'getting', 'recognized', 'efforts', 'what', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'route', 'bad', 'action', 'pictures', 'forgettable', '34', 'superhero', '34', 'extravaganzas', 'now', 'too', 'old', 'rom-coms', 'wasted', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'most', 'career', 'Let', 'hope', 'instead', 'simply', 'participate', 'interesting', 'movies', 'one', '4', '5']",N/A

What sets Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e's film apart is its refusal to sentimentalize the material: in McConaughey's performance he comes across as both homophobic and insecure. Even though he forms a close relationship with cross-dresser Rayon (Jared Leto), it's clear that he views homosexuality as somehow deviant. On the other hand, once he has been diagnosed with AIDS, Woodroof is ostracized by his fellow-Texan drinking buddies, who accuse him of being gay. We may admire Woodroof's ingenuity, as he exploits the system to procure supplies of drugs for his buyer's club, but we remain unsure as to his motives; is he performing a service or simply proving to himself that he can defy the doctors' prognosis that he has only 30 days to life? Or both. The film is deliberately shot in washed-out colors; this is a dark, subterranean world of seedy bars and ascetic hospital wards, where AIDS sufferers try to cope with the trauma of living with the disease, while being exploited by doctors such as Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare), who are more interested in profit motives than patient welfare.

Human Beings COULD solve problems in the natural world that no other species is capable of, and make the life of this world optimally thrive and flourish. Human Beings would do exactly this if they tapped into the visionary capability the Universe has bestowed upon them--and at times, they have done so. John Muir and Teddy Roosevelt. Rachel Carson. Ignaz Semmelweis and Louis Pasteur. And what did the Medical Establishment DO to Semmelweis and Pasteur? Obstruct, impede, block, suppress, and fight them ALL the way. The same one's who swore a Hippocratic oath.When Ron shouts in the hospital that the Dr in charge of the AZT study is a murderer, he is throwing a charge at the whole of the medical profession for hundreds of years. Dr's who have over-prescribed antibiotics and thus bred super-bugs to infect us all.  Drs who used to bleed their patients nearly to death in an attempt to' balance' their humours in the presentation of any symptoms of any kind.  Drs who would not wash their hands after dissecting corpses, who would then lay hands upon newly postnatal mothers. Drs who hounded Semmelweis out of the hospital, out of the city after disowning any responsibility for the unnecessary deaths of thousands upon thousands of mothers who had the misfortune to give birth in their sphere of influence. The authoritarianism of the medical profession is as profound an example of entrenched malignant interest as you can find. But what do you expect from a profession that sees the terminal cancer of your loved one as an opportunity to make some money and pay dividends to their shareholders?When somebody is diagnosed with a terminal illness--what is the FDA and the medical profession trying to protect them from? Should not the protocols be unfettered to give the widest possible latitude to the dying, with no known cure? Of course those who invest in pharmaceutical patents do not want that. It conflicts with their financial interests. So the citizens of other countries around the world often have access to treatments that the FDA will not sanction in the United States of America. Or if American Patent Medicines ARE produced, everyone around the world must pay through the nose for them. And some people claim we have the best health care system in the world. Of course, these people know absolutely nothing about the health care realities in the rest of the world, and have gobbled up a lot of undigested propaganda they have failed to verify and validate, but let them cling to their illusions--because no amount of facts, or reason, or insight is going to knock the scales from their eyes. Unless they or their significant others or their children get sick and are dying--and cannot get the treatments that might make a difference because the FDA and Big Pharma stand in the way with a big sign that says 'not for you'.This movie is about a journey of realization, a process of transformation, a fight for freedom, and an affirmation of hope. It is also a movie about a guy who did what he had to do to take care of himself, and others who shared his predicament. It demonstrates some of the best of what Human Beings can do, when they reach down inside themselves for the courage to fight to make a difference--and not surrender to authority, just because. Instead of trying to learn from him, trying to help him, trying to team up with him--the FDA used all their might and all their power to shut him down. Just like the Establishment did with Semmelweis and Pasteur. But YOUR Mother is alive today because they failed to stop Semmelweis, and YOU and I are probably alive because of Louis Pasteur, and Alexander Fleming, and Jonas Salk. There is an enormous teaching message in this film. Don't give the medical profession ALL the authority. Take some responsibility for learning what you can about your own health issues, like Ron did. We need to transform our relationship to our Drs from authoritarian to collaborative, and become partners in prevention as well as therapy. If Ron had known about prevention, he never would have needed therapy. This is a sad, movie--but only because those with the power to decide who lives and who dies did not do everything to try to do more. Let it be a lesson for us all. It's a lesson that's been bought for us, dearly, by millions condemned to death through indifference to human suffering.",5,Being Human,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,4559,"['Human', 'beings', 'owing', 'capacity', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'problem', 'solving', 'together', 'freedom', 'will', 'are', 'unique', 'position', 'be', 'sentient', 'agents', 'Universe', 'Human', 'Beings', 'COULD', 'solve', 'problems', 'natural', 'world', 'other', 'species', 'capable', 'make', 'life', 'world', 'optimally', 'thrive', 'flourish', 'Human', 'Beings', 'would', 'do', 'exactly', 'tapped', 'visionary', 'capability', 'Universe', 'bestowed', 'times', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'John', 'Muir', 'Teddy', 'Roosevelt', 'Rachel', 'Carson', 'Ignaz', 'Semmelweis', 'Louis', 'Pasteur', 'did', 'Medical', 'Establishment', 'DO', 'Semmelweis', 'Pasteur', 'Obstruct', 'impede', 'block', 'suppress', 'fight', 'way', 'same', 'one', 'who', 'swore', 'Hippocratic', 'oath.When', 'Ron', 'hospital', 'Dr', 'charge', 'AZT', 'study', 'murderer', 'throwing', 'charge', 'whole', 'medical', 'profession', 'hundreds', 'years', 'Dr', 'who', 'have', 'over-prescribed', 'antibiotics', 'thus', 'bred', 'super-bugs', 'infect', 'Drs', 'who', 'used', 'bleed', 'patients', 'nearly', 'death', 'attempt', 'balance', 'humours', 'presentation', 'symptoms', 'kind', 'Drs', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'wash', 'hands', 'dissecting', 'corpses', 'who', 'would', 'then', 'lay', 'hands', 'newly', 'postnatal', 'mothers', 'Drs', 'who', 'hounded', 'Semmelweis', 'hospital', 'city', 'disowning', 'responsibility', 'unnecessary', 'deaths', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'mothers', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'give', 'birth', 'sphere', 'influence', 'authoritarianism', 'medical', 'profession', 'as', 'profound', 'example', 'entrenched', 'malignant', 'interest', 'can', 'find', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'profession', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'loved', 'one', 'opportunity', 'make', 'money', 'pay', 'dividends', 'shareholders', 'When', 'somebody', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'illness', 'what', 'FDA', 'medical', 'profession', 'trying', 'protect', 'Should', 'not', 'protocols', 'be', 'unfettered', 'give', 'widest', 'possible', 'latitude', 'dying', 'known', 'cure', 'course', 'who', 'invest', 'pharmaceutical', 'patents', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'financial', 'interests', 'citizens', 'other', 'countries', 'world', 'often', 'have', 'access', 'treatments', 'FDA', 'will', 'not', 'sanction', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'American', 'Patent', 'Medicines', 'ARE', 'produced', 'everyone', 'world', 'must', 'pay', 'nose', 'people', 'claim', 'have', 'best', 'health', 'care', 'system', 'world', 'course', 'people', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'health', 'care', 'realities', 'rest', 'world', 'have', 'gobbled', 'up', 'lot', 'undigested', 'propaganda', 'have', 'failed', 'verify', 'validate', 'let', 'cling', 'illusions', 'amount', 'facts', 'reason', 'insight', 'going', 'knock', 'scales', 'eyes', 'significant', 'others', 'children', 'get', 'sick', 'are', 'dying', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'treatments', 'might', 'make', 'difference', 'FDA', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'stand', 'way', 'big', 'sign', ""'not"", ""you'.This"", 'movie', 'journey', 'realization', 'process', 'transformation', 'fight', 'freedom', 'affirmation', 'hope', 'also', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'take', 'care', 'others', 'who', 'shared', 'predicament', 'best', 'what', 'Human', 'Beings', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'reach', 'down', 'inside', 'courage', 'fight', 'make', 'difference', 'not', 'surrender', 'authority', 'just', 'Instead', 'trying', 'learn', 'trying', 'help', 'trying', 'team', 'up', 'FDA', 'used', 'might', 'power', 'shut', 'down', 'Just', 'Establishment', 'did', 'Semmelweis', 'Pasteur', 'Mother', 'alive', 'today', 'failed', 'stop', 'Semmelweis', 'YOU', 'are', 'probably', 'alive', 'Louis', 'Pasteur', 'Alexander', 'Fleming', 'Jonas', 'Salk', 'enormous', 'teaching', 'message', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'medical', 'profession', 'authority', 'Take', 'responsibility', 'learning', 'what', 'can', 'own', 'health', 'issues', 'Ron', 'did', 'need', 'transform', 'relationship', 'Drs', 'authoritarian', 'collaborative', 'become', 'partners', 'prevention', 'as', 'well', 'therapy', 'Ron', 'had', 'known', 'prevention', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'therapy', 'sad', 'movie', 'only', 'power', 'decide', 'who', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'everything', 'try', 'do', 'more', 'Let', 'be', 'lesson', 'lesson', 'been', 'bought', 'dearly', 'millions', 'condemned', 'death', 'indifference', 'human', 'suffering']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[8, 12]","Consider Big Pharma and the medical profession: they are more interested in what's profitable than what actually helps the patients.So a sort of vigilante medicine is at the heart of &#34;Dallas Buyers Club,&#34; a harrowing trip into the lives of AIDS patients in the mid 1980s. The direction is pretty nondescript, but the tragic true-life story and solid script somewhat buoy it up -- and the acting by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto is superb from beginning to end.Electrician/cowboy Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is your typical cowboy type -- he drinks, takes drugs, and has sex with lots of women. Then he is diagnosed with HIV, and given just thirty days to live. Ron refuses to just accept the diagnosis, and starts searching for drugs that can save him.Unfortunately, the only drug that MIGHT be able to save him is an antivital called AZT, which is in clinical trials for the next few years. So Ron sneaks it from the garbage and self-medicates. Then a doctor in Mexico prescribes him ddC and peptide T, neither of which have been approved by the FDA. But unlike AZT -- which doctors are pushing even though it's horribly toxic -- those medicines work.So a defiant Ron decides to open a &#34;buyer's club&#34; to sell these medicines to people who need them, with the help of Rayon (Leto) a HIV-positive transgender woman he has befriended. But when the local hospital learns that Ron has been using and distributing unapproved medicines, they become determined to shut him down despite the good he's doing.&#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34; is a devastating movie, because of what it reveals about AIDS in the past and present -- the fear, the hopelessness, the social ostracism, the slow failure of the body, and the uncaring Big Pharma/medical establishment. Most of the movie is just watching Ron wrestle the Grim Reaper into a headlock, even though we know he cannot win.The biggest problem is that Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e's direction isn't as great as other parts of the movie. It's not BAD, it's just sort of... meh. It moves in a straight line from beginning to end, with directorial few ups or downs. But the low-budget indie feel does work well, giving a dusty realism to Vall&eacute;e's style, despite a few &#34;Hollywood&#34; moments like a sympathetic love interest doctor who is charmed by Ron.I'm not really a fan of McConaughey, but I can safely say that he gives perhaps his finest performance ever here. He lost a lot of weight for this role, and it's often painful to see someone so emaciated and sickly, but burning with such passion and determination that it seems to eclipse his failing body.He also handles Ron's changes in attitude with a delicate touch. He starts off with a vile attitude towards gay and transgender people, but his abandonment by his friends and his reluctant friendship with Rayon change him into a more open, accepting person. Ron never becomes a NICE person (he's still rough, crude and somewhat mercenary), but he does learn to appreciate who people truly are.And Leto gives a pitch-perfect performance as Rayon, giving her a brashness and a vulnerability that makes her instantly endearing. Just consider the scene where she plays cards with Ron and casually talks about splitting the AZT. Jennifer Garner is the weak spot in the cast -- she's not bad, but her character is very Generic Hollywood Love Interest.Despite some flaws, &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34; is a harrowing, heartrending piece of work -- as well as McConaughey's finest performance.",4,Meds for AIDS,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,3505,"['Consider', 'Big', 'Pharma', 'medical', 'profession', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'what', 'profitable', 'what', 'actually', 'patients.So', 'sort', 'vigilante', 'medicine', 'heart', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'harrowing', 'trip', 'lives', 'AIDS', 'patients', 'mid', '1980s', 'direction', 'pretty', 'nondescript', 'tragic', 'true-life', 'story', 'solid', 'script', 'somewhat', 'buoy', 'up', 'acting', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'superb', 'beginning', 'end.Electrician/cowboy', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'McConaughey', 'typical', 'cowboy', 'type', 'drugs', 'sex', 'lots', 'women', 'Then', 'diagnosed', 'HIV', 'given', 'just', 'thirty', 'days', 'live', 'Ron', 'just', 'accept', 'diagnosis', 'searching', 'drugs', 'can', 'save', 'him.Unfortunately', 'only', 'drug', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'antivital', 'called', 'AZT', 'clinical', 'trials', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'So', 'Ron', 'sneaks', 'garbage', 'self-medicates', 'Then', 'doctor', 'Mexico', 'prescribes', 'ddC', 'peptide', 'T', 'neither', 'have', 'been', 'approved', 'FDA', 'AZT', 'doctors', 'are', 'pushing', 'even', 'horribly', 'toxic', 'medicines', 'work.So', 'defiant', 'Ron', 'open', '34', 'buyer', 'club', '34', 'sell', 'medicines', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'help', 'Rayon', 'Leto', 'HIV-positive', 'transgender', 'woman', 'befriended', 'when', 'local', 'hospital', 'learns', 'Ron', 'been', 'using', 'distributing', 'unapproved', 'medicines', 'become', 'determined', 'shut', 'down', 'good', 'doing.', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'devastating', 'movie', 'what', 'AIDS', 'past', 'present', 'fear', 'hopelessness', 'social', 'ostracism', 'slow', 'failure', 'body', 'uncaring', 'Big', 'Pharma/medical', 'establishment', 'Most', 'movie', 'just', 'watching', 'Ron', 'wrestle', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'headlock', 'even', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'win.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Jean-Marc', 'Vall', 'eacute', 'direction', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'other', 'parts', 'movie', 'not', 'BAD', 'just', 'sort', 'meh', 'straight', 'line', 'beginning', 'end', 'directorial', 'few', 'ups', 'downs', 'low-budget', 'indie', 'feel', 'work', 'well', 'giving', 'dusty', 'realism', 'Vall', 'eacute', 'style', 'few', '34', 'Hollywood', '34', 'moments', 'sympathetic', 'love', 'interest', 'doctor', 'who', 'charmed', 'Ron.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'McConaughey', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance', 'ever', 'here', 'lost', 'lot', 'weight', 'role', 'often', 'painful', 'see', 'someone', 'so', 'emaciated', 'sickly', 'burning', 'such', 'passion', 'determination', 'eclipse', 'failing', 'body.He', 'also', 'Ron', 'changes', 'attitude', 'delicate', 'touch', 'vile', 'attitude', 'towards', 'gay', 'transgender', 'people', 'abandonment', 'friends', 'reluctant', 'friendship', 'Rayon', 'change', 'more', 'open', 'accepting', 'person', 'Ron', 'never', 'NICE', 'person', 'still', 'rough', 'crude', 'somewhat', 'mercenary', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'who', 'people', 'truly', 'are.And', 'Leto', 'pitch-perfect', 'performance', 'Rayon', 'giving', 'brashness', 'vulnerability', 'instantly', 'endearing', 'Just', 'consider', 'scene', 'where', 'cards', 'Ron', 'casually', 'talks', 'splitting', 'AZT', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'weak', 'spot', 'cast', 'not', 'bad', 'character', 'very', 'Generic', 'Hollywood', 'Love', 'Interest.Despite', 'flaws', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'harrowing', 'heartrending', 'piece', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'McConaughey', 'finest', 'performance']",N/A

McConaughey is almost unrecognizable due to an approximately 50 pound weight loss.  He looks weak, frail and like he could be near death.

Based on a true story and written with sensitivity by Craig Borden and Melisa Wallack and directed with equal verve and insight by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e (The Young Victoria, C.R.A.Z.Y.), this is a film that lingers in the mind long after the closing credits. It deserves to be seen by everyone, not only for the incredibly fine performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, but because of the questions it raises about the interplay of disease, drug companies and current governmentally controlled medical practice guidelines.Texan Ron Woodroof  (Matthew McConaughey) is an electrician, a rodeo cowboy, a heavy drinker and cocaine abuser, and a woman chaser for casual sex. In 1985, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V. -positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence. His crash course of research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S. (especially the prolonged investigation of AZT), so Ron crosses the border into Mexico where he discovers Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), a discredited American physician with his own battery of drugs to fight AIDS. Woodroof learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner). A true homophobe, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron's lust for life. Rayon also shares Ron's entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a buyers club, where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Ron's pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, the embattled Lone Star loner lives life to the fullest like never before.In addition to the brilliant performances by McConaughey and Leto, there far fine cameos by Jennifer Garner, Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Donna Duplantier and Griffin Dunne.

1681925,A25GMONBLGQE1U,B00GUO2SKA,"H. Ross ""biblemonkey""","[0, 0]","Welcome to the 1980s. A decade of excess and limited consequences, where every desire can be fulfilled if you&#8217;re daring enough and your cash holds out. Or so it seems to Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a hard drinking cowboy with a penchant for anonymous sex, hard drugs, and bull riding. When he has an accident at work and is sent to the hospital, he discovers the real price for his hedonistic lifestyle&#8212;he has HIV, and he only has thirty days to live.Ron researches his condition. He discovers, to his amazement, that not just the &#8220;Tinkerbells&#8221; can contract HIV. He also finds that there is a drug available for testing that may help, but it is not for sale. Soon he embarks upon a journey that will take him through the most dangerous circles of black market prescription drugs and will reveal the seamy relationship between corporations and government, but it is also an adventure that will change his outlook on the disease itself and its sufferers.In Ron Woodroof, we have the least sympathetic of protagonists. A homophobe, a womanizer, an alcoholic, an abusive little man with scant thought for how to do anything with his life other than get laid and get high. And somehow, director Jean-Marc Vallee and company have made a movie that not only causes us to slowly come to cheer him on, but somehow does not let us forget what he truly is on the inside. To give us reasons to not forget his sins but, in remembering them, exult in his cause is a hard task to perform. The viewer is at once repulsed by him and, by stages, sympathetic with his plight and his changes in character.To be sure, the movie is a tad unevenly biased. There is not one unsympathetic homosexual character, while any character who does not instantly scream by their presence &#8220;I AM ON YOUR SIDE&#8221; is played off as barely human.  But that is minute compared to what the movie does right. Yes, the film has an agenda, and it announces itself with a bullhorn, but at least there is a clear direction and a &#8220;Dramatis Personae&#8221; that carries it off without being belaboring and insulting.&#8220;The Dallas Buyers Club&#8221; is a strange item. Challenged by being based on a true story, but having to follow scripting conventions. Having a larger purpose, but falling victim to certain movie clich&eacute;s. An odd marketing campaign that has no trust in the material itself, but rather plays the film off as a lark. Ignoring all of this, it is nearly impossible to not see the work at its heart. &#8220;The Dallas Buyers Club&#8221; is a modern day &#8220;Philadelphia.&#8221; Though it does not have as much of an emotional punch as &#8220;Philadelphia,&#8221; it manages to stand on its own merits as though that movie never even existed. Here is a film that tackles far more than a discussion about HIV and AIDS and moves on into corporate lobbying, the corruption of money on politics, and the human element that tends to get lost in the political and judicial process.

McConaughey gives a stunning, gritty and bittersweet performance as a rather unsavory real-life person Ron Woodroof.McConaughey won the Academt Award as Best Actor and few actors take such a risk in an unpredictable box-office movie. Slender McConaughey lost even more weight to portray the AIDS-stricken, gaunt Woodroof.While we can praise his performance, there are a lot of negatives about DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. The film is long and slow-moving. Although Woodroof is real, transgender Rayon (Academy Award winner Jared Leto) was created to give the Woodroof character an ally and more dramatic interaction. We are taken back to the 80's when AIDS was an automatic death sentence with no treatment, let alone a cure. It became a &#34;gay&#34; disease and people out of both homophobia and legitimate fear were uncertain how easily AIDS could be contracted--a simple sneeze? A handshake? DALLAS BUYERS CLUB takes us back to this time as heterosexual Woodroof deals with his own homophobia and those of &#34;friends&#34; who assume he must be gay.Woodroof starts the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB to get unapproved by potentially life-saving drugs to those afflicted by AIDS. Unfortunately, he is not crusading for the good of mankind but rather for his own needs. It all comes at a cost. It's $400 a month to join the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. Those who can't pay, can't get the medicines.  Although Woodroof softens a bit in his journey. He is never redeemed as he plays against the Law and the FDA. It never goes beyond the money he can earn from the club. He fights agains the harsh drug AZT because of the damage it does but at the time, it was the only approved treatment. As we learn later, a smaller dose of AZT combined with other drugs did provide an effective treatment-but not cure-for AIDS.McConnaughey is amazing in his role and deserves to be applauded. It's clear he had his heart in this project and he finally can be added to the ranks of great dramatic actors.There is a disappointment that the bonus features lack any information on the real Ron Woodroof. The bonus features are minimal and deal only with the making of the film.

Raunchy was an understatement, it was more like porn.  I am no prude and asked myself afterwards  WWJD?Texas cowboy Ron Woodroof (McConaughey; who must have lost a significant amount of weight to portray Woodroof) is a rough and tough rodeo cowboy with a trade of electronics, following in his father's footsteps.  This is all we are told about his family relationships.  Ron has many men friends, loves to party and has many addictions (don't we all)?Set in the mid 1980's, when the aids epidemic surfaced, many of us were appalled at the fast pace that this disease overtook our society.  We were not prepared for the full blown attack that devastated the homosexual community in the America's, more prominent in the third world countries.  We as a nation followed the process as the medical community fought hard to eradicate this very terminal condition.This movie is about the real life experience of Ron Woodroof and his battle with aids and his own homophobic attitude.  When Woodroof is told that he has 30 days to live, he is beyond distraught, beyond denial but finally realizes that there is truth to what the doctors are telling him, since he is experiencing his health deteriorating. He is not going to go quietly into the night. He picks up his boot straps and begins to evaluate his condition, becomes informed about the medical community, takes his power back and fights his own personal battle with the disease.For those of you, who were not focused on the aids epidemic of the 1980's, this movie will help you understand how fast and furious the disease took over everyone's life.  Yes, even us ""straight"" people.  In 1982, my husband had heart by-pass surgery, that involved a replacement of all his blood, many blood transfusions and in those days, no pre-requisites for giving blood. In hindsight, we know that before an operation, we can have transfusions done from blood relatives or even our own blood drawn.Jennifer Garner, playing the role of his physician also battles with this disease in her own way.  While the rest of the medical community is going full speed ahead with ""drug trials"", she is looking to be more conservative in her medical judgments.  She establishes a good rapport with the homosexual community and becomes open to other avenues of medical care.  This attitude establishes a friendship with Ron Woodroof and they begin the process of introducing alternative ways of fighting this disease.Other books for your consideration:When Society Becomes an Addictby Anne Wilson SchaefOut of the Shadows: Understanding Sexual Addictionby Patrick J.

The most coverage that AIDS and HIV get in this country today is perfunctory at best and ignored at worst. And while Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto give strong performances with an emphasis on immersion into their roles, they probably wouldn't have been my picks for Best Actor or Supporting Actor. There's no denying the greatness that McConaughey has achieved in the past few years alone, with films like KILLER JOE, MUD, MAGIC MIKE, BERNIE and his astounding work in HBO's TRUE DETECTIVE, but this film doesn't quite have the gravitas necessary to really support such a strong performance. And with the Academy's love of actors portraying real people, it wasn't a great surprise, but I would rather Best Actor had gone to Christian Bale in AMERICAN HUSTLE or Chiwetel Eijofor in 12 YEARS A SLAVE on the merits of their performances rather than on the merit of the film's story. Leto is similarly strong, but without the resume' of McConaughey, and I hope to see him in other films challenging expectations, and I think that's why he won. Who would ever have expected Jared Leto to win an Academy Award?I feel that DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is less of an exploration of challenging filmmaking and more of a reminder that AIDS is still very much a problem in our time.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[12, 16]","Already laden with awards from the Golden Globes, this audacious film has collected six nominations for Academy Awards. After viewing this moving story, I can certainly see why. Director Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e (&#34;Young Victoria&#34;) pulled off nothing short of a miracle when funding suddenly dried up and he filmed this in 25 days. He fed his cast on over-loaded credit cards.Through the use of dates (when initially diagnosed in 1985, our hero is given 30 days to live), we know that this actually happened; it is a brilliant script by two newcomers, Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, who used Ron Woodroof's life to inform their script (he's &#34;Woodruff&#34; in the film). Last year I saw the excellent documentary &#34;How to Fight a Plague&#34; and feel that the time lines and the learning curve about AIDS are realistic and factual.Some of this terrific cast are:* Matthew McConaughey (&#34;The Wolf of Wall Street&#34;) is Ron Woodruff, a macho rodeo cowboy and hustler. When told his diagnosis he lets the doctor know in no uncertain terms, what he thinks of THAT: &#34;Straight men don' get AIDS!&#34; Mr. M. lost 45 pounds to add realism to his role.* Jared Leto (&#34;Mr. Nobody&#34;) is Rayon, a transgender wannabe who partners with our hero to form the Buyers Club, a gimmick that (temporarily) circumvents Texas law. He lost 40 pounds as well as waxed his body for this role.* Jennifer Garner (&#34;Butter&#34;) plays Eve, a doctor who sees the value of reducing the toxic doses of AZT, despite her medical colleagues and Big Pharma. See how that works for her!* Denis O'Hare (&#34;J. Edgar&#34;) is Dr. Sevard, the face we soon come to see as evil because he represents the implacability of the ADA and Big Pharma.* Steve Zahn (&#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#34;) is our hero's brother Tucker, a Dallas cop and an all-around good guy.* Griffin Dunne (&#34;Broken City&#34;) is Dr. Vass, an American doctor exiled to Mexico because of his unorthodox approach to HIV and AIDS. This proves to be a game changer.Ron Woodruff is a rake hell, so expect &#34;F&#34; bombs by the score, sexual situations (he didn't get AIDS sitting home watching TV), drug use and realistic depiction of dying victims. No wonder it is rated &#34;R&#34; and is awarded with wins and nominations!

Even from the first scenes of the movie, he is obviously emaciated and very ill, and yet the diagnosis for a heterosexual man was shocking and unexpected since AIDS was considered a disease of homosexuals. He is instantly shunned by his buddies who accusing him of being a &#34;homo&#34;. The doctor gives him 6 months to live and starts him on a course of AZT, the only drug regimen available at the time to treat the disease. The afflicted who are enrolled in the blind trials are all made even sicker by the treatment, yet they line up to get a chance to get the drugs.Out of desperation, Ron heads to a clinic in Mexico run by a doctor willing to experiment with alternative therapies, none of which are sanctioned by the FDA. He starts feeling better and smuggles some of the drugs back into the U.S., and decides to start peddling them to others afflicted by the disease. He even travels to Japan to try and make a deal for some of the drugs. He enlists cross-gender dressing gay Rayon, played by Jared Leto, to help him in the business, Dallas Buyer's Club, which he runs out of his apartment.Woodroof's motivations are complex. No doubt he enjoyed the income from the brisk business he did in peddling the drugs, for which he charged a monthly fee for admission to the Dallas Buyers Club. He turned away those that couldn't afford it, even when they begged him pitifully. But he also put himself at great risk by providing a service for those desperately searching for a treatment and a cure. He could have just obtained the drugs for himself and a few others, but he chose to broaden his influence. Nevertheless, he isn't an entirely commendable person, as he continued using recreational drugs and having unprotected sex while ill.It's hard to imagine another actor who could have played this role with the bravado and swagger and vulnerability of McConaughey, though the scenes when you see his shriveled, emaciated body are hard to endure. I can't help wondering whether the actor has done any permanent damage to his body by losing 40 pounds off of an already slender frame. Nevertheless, this portrayal will define his body of work for years to come and put him in the running for other serious and substantial roles.",4,Struggle for Survival in the Early Days of the AIDS Epidemic,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,2435,"['Ron', 'Woodroof', 'played', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'living', 'up', '1986', 'doing', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'betting', 'rodeo', 'banging', 'multiple', 'girls', 'simultaneously', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'diagnosed', 'AIDS', 'Even', 'first', 'scenes', 'movie', 'obviously', 'emaciated', 'very', 'ill', 'yet', 'diagnosis', 'heterosexual', 'man', 'was', 'shocking', 'unexpected', 'AIDS', 'was', 'considered', 'disease', 'homosexuals', 'instantly', 'shunned', 'buddies', 'who', 'accusing', 'being', '34', 'homo', '34', 'doctor', '6', 'months', 'live', 'course', 'AZT', 'only', 'drug', 'regimen', 'available', 'time', 'treat', 'disease', 'afflicted', 'who', 'are', 'enrolled', 'blind', 'trials', 'are', 'made', 'even', 'sicker', 'treatment', 'yet', 'line', 'up', 'get', 'chance', 'get', 'drugs.Out', 'desperation', 'Ron', 'clinic', 'Mexico', 'run', 'doctor', 'willing', 'experiment', 'alternative', 'therapies', 'none', 'are', 'sanctioned', 'FDA', 'feeling', 'better', 'drugs', 'back', 'U.S.', 'start', 'peddling', 'others', 'afflicted', 'disease', 'even', 'Japan', 'try', 'make', 'deal', 'drugs', 'cross-gender', 'dressing', 'gay', 'Rayon', 'played', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'help', 'business', 'Dallas', 'Buyer', 'Club', 'apartment.Woodroof', 'motivations', 'are', 'complex', 'doubt', 'enjoyed', 'income', 'brisk', 'business', 'did', 'peddling', 'drugs', 'charged', 'monthly', 'fee', 'admission', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'turned', 'away', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'even', 'when', 'begged', 'pitifully', 'also', 'put', 'great', 'risk', 'providing', 'service', 'desperately', 'searching', 'treatment', 'cure', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'obtained', 'drugs', 'few', 'others', 'chose', 'broaden', 'influence', 'Nevertheless', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'commendable', 'person', 'continued', 'using', 'recreational', 'drugs', 'having', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'ill.It', 'hard', 'imagine', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'bravado', 'swagger', 'vulnerability', 'McConaughey', 'scenes', 'when', 'see', 'shriveled', 'emaciated', 'body', 'are', 'hard', 'endure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'actor', 'done', 'permanent', 'damage', 'body', 'losing', '40', 'pounds', 'already', 'slender', 'frame', 'Nevertheless', 'portrayal', 'will', 'define', 'body', 'work', 'years', 'come', 'put', 'running', 'other', 'serious', 'substantial', 'roles']",N/A

He is a real woman's man and he is very promiscuous. He is hurt one day at work and wakes up in the hospital. Doctors come in wearing masks to advise him that he has the HIV virus and that he has 30 days to live......Matthew McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof and Jarad Leto plays Rayon and both are dying of Aids. They become friends even though they have vastly different lifestyles and sexual beliefs. They both looked at the verge of death due to the weight they had lost to do the roles and their acting was superb. The Academy Awards proved the point. This is based on a true story of Ron's fight against the medical profession and the FDA to speed up and provide the right drugs to help dying aids patients.Ron had to overcome his homophobia and prejudice and realize that all of the Aids victims were in the same boat as he was. Condemned to death by an incurable disease and by the medical profession's slow moving research into a lethal disease. His point was, ""Who cares if the treatment is risky, we are all dying.""This movie isn't for everyone as it is very outgoing into Ron's sex life and very graphic. It is an excellent film and the acting is just over the top. Jennifer Garner plays Dr. Saks and she does a great job in that role as well.  The film is set in Dallas in 1985 and it is interesting to see the indifference of the medical industry and people in general to the Aids epidemic since is was perceived to be a disease  of drug users and the gay community.It is a sad movie and depressing at times as people die and waste away. The medical industry is pushing the AZT drug treatment and it seems to be killing people faster instead of helping them.

People who were not just tragic victims of the disease, but who actually fought for their lives. They fought an indifferent government, a medical system slow to change, an often corrupt system and the vitriol of a fearful public.Matthew McConaughey transforms himself not only physically, but emotionally to play an unlikely hero of the epidemic. Ron Woodruff is an electrician, sometimes rodeo cowboy, and ladies man who is nothing if not vehemently anti-gay in his viewpoint. In an accident at work,it his discovered that he is HIV positive, an absolute death sentence in those early days, he is given only thirty days to live. He soon goes about getting and taking the new drug AZT illegally when he can't get into a clinical trial. The drug along with his rampant alchohol and drug use, almost poison him to death and he eventually goes in search of promising new drugs only available in Mexico. He soon starts selling these drugs to other patients in need but the FDA and corrupt drug companies battle him seemingly every step of the way.In the hospital Ron meets Rayon a street smart transvestite who is played  brilliantly by Jared a It's Leto who I think, I think, steals the show. It is partly through Rayon that Ron reluctantly grows more tolerant of the gay community he now serves. They become extremely close by the films end.

Woodroof explored every option and in Mexico found alternative drugs, which he sold in his Buyers Club.

Those who had the disease and were promptly given a death sentence by not only the disease but by the medical community at large who at the time were at a loss at what to do to stem the tide of the disease. Also those who failed to understand anything about what was going on and choose to instead treat those who had the disease as outcasts. Realistically very little attention was being paid to the disease until well known personalities died from it (such as Rock Hudson and Freddy Mercury, among others.)This movie pulls no punches with lots of foul language, sex and drug use but also gives us a decent story to watch and a character (to love and hate at the same time). McConaughey does an outstanding job at playing the homophobic, womanizing, drinking, drug using rodeo cowboy who contracts the disease. His portrayal appeared very realistic even to the point of his weigh loss making him look even more the part.

First of all, I could hardly recognize Matthew McConaughey. His gaunt, emaciated face and body was almost painful to watch as you see him right from the onset with all the symptoms of AIDS. His whole life changes and his fight to stay alive and get the appropriate treatment as he sees fit is a liberating theme in the struggle to live despite all the ongoing conflict against him. Jared Leto also performed an A+ performance as his gay business partner.I did have a couple problems with the film. As a registered nurse living in those times, I couldn't figure out why he didn't get on the AZT clinical trials that should have been offered to him by the Dallas hospital. There was so much said against AZT that is not true. I have cared for AIDS patients who have lived on many more years taking AZT for their chronic illness, which AIDS really now is considered. Of course, it may be my lack of knowledge of how the drug was dispensed in the beginning. But knowing what I know now, AZT is given world wide and shipped to Africans who especially have this pandemic sad disease and it has been successful.Another problem I had with the movie was that there was too much of the &#34;F&#34; word in it. Just about every line of dialogue is deluged with this word. I personally don't have anything against any language, as language changes and its use will be described for all time and will continue to evolve, but the overuse of this word just got on my nerves.The story was good and I always like true stories best and especially any one of those that encompass the fighting spirit which McCanaugney portrayed, but I would have given 5 stars for this movie if the profanity hadn't been so overused.Regardless, see this movie. I will be highly surprised if McCanaugney and Leto does not win an Oscars for their performances. I would not recommend this for families; it is strictly an adult movie with adult themes shedding light on that population that suffer from AIDS. It might serve a message to those that are sexually promiscuous that your covert actions and behavior could highly lead you to having this horrible disease in the end of your life.I have cared for dying AIDS patients and it is not a pretty sight. Their last days, they are vomiting, have uncontrollable diarrhea, have night sweats and high temperatures, have sores all over their bodies, coughing and hacking from chronic pneumonia and it is almost impossible to comfort them in the end. And they do look like Matthew McCanughney. May God release us from this terrible disease upon our fellow brethren and hopefully, there will be a cure found soon. But meanwhile, do take precautions and use protection and abstain if you have a questionable sex partner---it's just not worth losing your life over it and dying from a quick encounter that could devastate your life.Kelly CyrAuthor of &#34;Supreme Love: A Battered Woman's True Story&#34;",4,Hard story about a hard cowboy and his path to try to find wellness,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,3044,"['was', 'movie', 'watching', 'spree', 'yesterday', 'instead', 'divulging', 'books', 'usually', 'do', 'watched', 'one', 'first', 'husband', 'First', 'could', 'hardly', 'recognize', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'gaunt', 'emaciated', 'face', 'body', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'see', 'right', 'onset', 'symptoms', 'AIDS', 'whole', 'life', 'changes', 'fight', 'stay', 'alive', 'get', 'appropriate', 'treatment', 'fit', 'liberating', 'theme', 'struggle', 'live', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'also', 'performed', 'A+', 'performance', 'gay', 'business', 'partner.I', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'problems', 'film', 'registered', 'nurse', 'living', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'AZT', 'clinical', 'trials', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'offered', 'Dallas', 'hospital', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'said', 'AZT', 'not', 'true', 'have', 'cared', 'AIDS', 'patients', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'taking', 'AZT', 'chronic', 'illness', 'AIDS', 'really', 'now', 'considered', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'how', 'drug', 'was', 'dispensed', 'beginning', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'AZT', 'given', 'world', 'wide', 'shipped', 'Africans', 'who', 'especially', 'have', 'pandemic', 'sad', 'disease', 'been', 'successful.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'much', '34', 'F', '34', 'word', 'Just', 'line', 'dialogue', 'deluged', 'word', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'language', 'language', 'changes', 'use', 'will', 'be', 'described', 'time', 'will', 'continue', 'evolve', 'overuse', 'word', 'just', 'got', 'nerves.The', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'always', 'true', 'stories', 'best', 'especially', 'one', 'encompass', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'McCanaugney', 'portrayed', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'movie', 'profanity', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'overused.Regardless', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'highly', 'surprised', 'McCanaugney', 'Leto', 'not', 'win', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'families', 'strictly', 'adult', 'movie', 'adult', 'themes', 'shedding', 'light', 'population', 'suffer', 'AIDS', 'might', 'serve', 'message', 'are', 'sexually', 'promiscuous', 'covert', 'actions', 'behavior', 'could', 'highly', 'lead', 'having', 'horrible', 'disease', 'end', 'life.I', 'have', 'cared', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'patients', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'last', 'days', 'are', 'vomiting', 'have', 'uncontrollable', 'diarrhea', 'have', 'night', 'sweats', 'high', 'temperatures', 'have', 'sores', 'bodies', 'coughing', 'hacking', 'chronic', 'pneumonia', 'almost', 'impossible', 'comfort', 'end', 'do', 'look', 'Matthew', 'McCanughney', 'May', 'God', 'release', 'terrible', 'disease', 'fellow', 'brethren', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'cure', 'found', 'soon', 'meanwhile', 'do', 'take', 'precautions', 'use', 'protection', 'abstain', 'have', 'questionable', 'sex', 'partner', '-it', 'just', 'not', 'worth', 'losing', 'life', 'dying', 'quick', 'encounter', 'could', 'devastate', 'life.Kelly', 'CyrAuthor', '34', 'Supreme', 'Love', 'Battered', 'Woman', 'True', 'Story', '34']",N/A

Certainly it's very emotional, a touching story of a man's ups and downs dealing with HIV/AIDS back at the genesis of the disease in the '80s. But while the movie is great with the heart, it is lacking for the head. What is not communicated nor explored are the thoughts and logic of the various characters. The protagonist's transformation from jerk to nice guy is a little too facile, and likely more from selfish and personal gain than a learned kindness. So I found myself a bit confused as to why this man was say, mad, at certain points: Because he couldn't help himself or others? Lost money or chivalrous intentions? At some point he evolves from a completely bigoted homophobe, but I'm not sure when or even why.The best parts of the movie involved the examination of how the American pharmaceutical corporation and medical research can conspire against the patients.

It's won many awards, not least for the 2 stars (Matthew McConaughey & Jared Leto). I was eager to see it.I wasn't disappointed. The film is based on the life of Ron Woodroof (pronounced Wood-ruff), played by McConaughey. In 1985 this good-ol' boy, straight homophobe was told that he not only had HIV, his t-cell count was so low that he was given 30 days to live. He wasn't going to take that lying down!In the film he goes to the library. He researches HIV, AIDS, & what treatments are available to him (none). He tries to con his doctor (Jennifer Garner) into putting him into an AZT trial. When he collapses again, he regains consciousness next to Rayon, a luminous transgender beauty played by Jared Leto. Rayon IS on AZT, but already splitting her trial dosage with another, & declines Woodroof's plea to split it with him too.Eventually Woodroof ends up at a clinic in Mexico. The doctor who runs it is vehement against AZT! 'That stuff is poison!' he says, & instead puts Woodroof onto a course of vitamins, protein injections, & European-approved drugs. Woodroof packs his car full of these items & heads back across the border. Where, despite wearing a priests' collar, he's stopped & questioned. Eventually he & the medication do make it back to Dallas, but here Woodroof runs up against a brick wall: his own homophobia. He just can't bear gay men, so selling something that'll save their lives is difficult for him. Re-enter Rayon...McConaughey as Woodruff is gritty. His emaciated form & drunken/stoned lurching around are entirely believable. But it's Leto, as Nylon, who electrifies the viewer. Leto also lost 30lbs for this (fictitious) role. He studied transgendered men in depth, & improvised the role of Nylon as he saw fit. He's astounding. Nylon is no angel. S/he's an AIDS-ravaged junkie who has lived her life as a sexual outlaw. In the most affecting scene, Nylon isn't even wearing makeup. Dressed as a man, he goes to visit his father, a banker. The father berates Nylon for his 'choices'. Nylon stares at his father & says 'there wasn't any choice. This is who I am.' Pow!I'll be honest; I re-watched this movie twice after my initial screening. It's simply 1 of the best films I've seen.

Refusing to accept that he had 30 days to live and suffering side effects from AZT, Woodroof starts sourcing alternatives, first from Mexico, then internationally. Wisely, he doesn't ""sell"" his drugs, but dishes them out for free, charging a flat fee for membership of The Dallas Buyers Club.The characters of Rayon and Dr Eve Saks are composites of transgender AIDS patients and doctors whom the writers interviewed and melded as supporting actors for the film.Both Matthew McConaughey as Woodroof and Jared Leto (almost unrecognizable) as Rayon immersed themselves totally in their roles by losing 50 lbs (23 Kgs) and 30 lbs (14 Kgs) respectively, worthy of their recognition at the Golden Globes and Oscar nominations. McConaughey has matured from lightweight romcom eye candy into a fine actor - Mud and cameos in Bernie and The Wolf of Wall Street - to name a few.Despite top drawer acting, the film as a whole falls a bit flat. At just shy of 2 hours, it was too long and, at times, repetitive. Sure, it was Woodroof's story, but Reagan's apathy to this growing pandemic was worth including, if only as an archival clip. Woodroof's frustration at the system was confined to run ins with the DEA, FDA, pharmaceutical companies and petty bureaucrats. Despite these shortcomings, it is an excellent depiction of our not too distant past.The characters alone make this film a ""must see"".

It is also, in a sense, about a journey from intolerance to acceptance, as our homophobic hero, Ron, humanizes and discovers he has some tender and empathic feelings for those he previously despised.And while I admired Ron's Texas can do attitude in that he both refused to bow to authority and discovered better alternatives to the glaring problems of sanctioned Aids medicines, what I loved above all else, unlike many of the reviewers who gave this film low ratings,  was the joie de vivre of the principle characters.Ron never regrets or apologizes for his lifestyle choices. He lived the life he loved - filled with cheap women, raw sex, gambling, booze and rodeo and despite being  a skilled electrician and extremely bright, he reveled in it. So too did Rayon, the very charming transgender woman played by Jared Leto in a remarkable performance. Rayon is softer and a bit sadder than Ron, but doesn't hesitate to call out all of Ron's biases and stupidities and bring him to earth. Also remarkable is the one glimpse we get into Rayon's back story which is shocking. I found it strangely liberating that these two wildly disparate people had had the guts to live out their own truth, freely and without hypocrisy.Wonderful performances by McConaughey, Leto and an unrecognizable Griffin Dunne as the charming, aged hippie doctor, Vass.

At the hospital he is told he has HIV and has less than thirty days to live. Does he succumb to the diagnosis, or does something else happen entirely?Dallas Buyers Club is based on a true story about Ron Woodruff. I must admit I was unfamiliar with this movie. The ticket seller gave me an unconvincing outline, and I was about to walk away when a couple overhearing our conversation assured me it was a good movie.I am glad to say they were correct. This is the exact type of movie that wins Oscars, and gets many nominations.Matthew Mc Conaughey deserves to be nominated for playing someone battling a deadly disease who takes on big drugs and the FDA, to enable other sufferers like himself to have access to supplements and life saving drugs. He reputedly lost about 40 pounds for the role, and at times does look very gaunt, which gives an added layer of reality to his portrayal.This is a multi faceted movie full of interesting characters, which operates on multiple levels at once. The personal struggle, the parallel struggles and contrasts, and the battle against different facets of authority. Jennifer Garner in a supporting role plays a feisty yet compassionate doctor, while a colleague with more of an eye to profit becomes a doctor shill for big drugs, which are experimental, still unproven, and in the clinical trial stage, and may have toxic side effects, while our protagonist has to chase down a caring and competent doctor in Mexico who was disbarred, for less toxic alternatives.Why does one experimental method, with an unproven drug, take priority over drugs that are unapproved by the FDA? Aren't drugs undergoing clinical trials also unapproved? In both cases aren't people offering themselves as guinea pigs, and why shouldn't they be allowed to do that? After all, it is their lives.I loved this movie, and I found the story far more engaging than I thought I would beforehand. I was particularly intrigued and a little surprised by how hard hitting it was against the FDA, and the role it plays in connection with the big pharmaceutical companies, and how it restricts our access even to harmless supplements.I love it when a character is resourceful, so I loved the answers he gives an FDA official when he is stopped and questioned at the border.As often happens in a movie of this nature, there is more than one great performance. An unrecognizable Jared Leto gives a breathtaking performance as a gaunt transgender woman also undergoing treatment who Ron meets, and who sources customers for him. Ray like others has to deal with Ron's homophobia, and it's refreshing to see how it plays out as the character develops. What I love is the journey the character makes through being confronted with his own mortality, and how that affects a wider circle of people.If Leto does not get an Oscar nomination for his role then there is no justice in Hollywood. He would have to be a leading contender for Best Supporting Actor, as Matthew McConaughey would be for Best Actor.One thing that has impressed me in recent years is McConaughey's transition from lightweight romcom, and pretty boy roles, to more challenging roles. For instance, I consider Lincoln Lawyer to be one of his best roles as a wheeler dealer lawyer but not the type of role for which an actor is typically nominated. He battles the system but has no weakness.Actors win Oscars for playing two types of roles:One is the psychopath, such as Daniel Day Lewis for There Will Be Blood, Javier Bardem for No Country for Old Men, and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.The second is actors battling disabilities or diseases and/or social injustice. Recently Octavia Spenser won for playing a maid dealing with racial discrimination, Meryl Streep for playing a Prime Minister battling alzheimers, and Christian Bale for playing a former boxer battling drug addiction. Jennifer Lawrence won playing a character battling grief who acts out sexually. Bradley Cooper was nominated for playing someone with bipolar disorder in the same movie. Jeff Bridges won an alcoholic country singer. More recently the trend has been moving toward playing real life characters.As often happens the best movies of the year are released in December and timed for an Oscar run.

1682105,A2ZRCNY3FVR4AI,B00GUO2SKA,"Lucas Goldstein ""Luke Goldstein""","[0, 1]","About a decade ago there was a small list of movie subjects virtually guaranteed to earn an actor an Oscar nomination. One of those coveted roles was someone with AIDS. Tom Hanks gave his majestic turn in Philadelphia and for a while the floodgates opened wide. Yet it slowed down dramatically as society changed; we became used to HIV/AIDS as a part of our daily social contract, and new fears arose to challenge the dramatic audiences. But for millions of people, the rise of AIDS was not just bait for acting accolades, it was a nightmarish reality they dealt with inside a world scarcely ready to understand it. In those times, people struggled to survive in any way they knew how and this story highlights one of those desperate and unstoppable souls.Dallas Buyers Club tells the tale of Ron Woodroof, a salt-of-the-earth, trailer-dwelling electrician who has lived his life in a haze between bottles and bimbos. Then the ball dropped, along with his T-cell count, and he found out he had HIV. Using his brain, which few people would ever imagine he had, he hustled, wheeled and dealed his way through medical trials and experimental treatments in order to stay alive. Once he realized that he could do it, he saw an opportunity to do the same for others, while also turning a nifty profit. Hey, even angels have a little dust on their wings.Being a true story about the phenomenon of these buyer&#8217;s clubs (where AIDS patients paid for memberships and got medications as a loophole through existing drug laws), it&#8217;s inherently dramatic, but the film shines far more in it&#8217;s performances than it&#8217;s storytelling. It needs to cover years of Ron&#8217;s life skating away from the long arm of the law, while still fighting day-to-day to keep his body healthy. Due to that time frame, it feels drawn out at times, but that&#8217;s where you find yourself watching the actors more their skill more than their story.Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto form an unlikely bond, not only through their characters, but also through the sheer trial they put their bodies through for the roles. Both actors were freakishly thin at varying points (nothing like Christian Bale in The Machinist, but damn close), yet emanating from those emaciated frames was an intensity which draws you in. The efforts and skills paid off because both McConaughey and Leto walked away with Oscar nominations (as did the film itself.)The movie also acts as a not-so-subtle polemic against the FDA and its cozy relationship with big pharma. In a country with millions upon millions of sick people in desperate need of specific medications, we watch in horror as the FDA ties it up in red tape, blocks approval of experimental drugs and outright lies about current treatments being useful, all in the name of record setting profits. Whether or not the unconscionable behaviors of the FDA agents in the film are completely accurate, the taste in your mouth when the credits roll is less than sweet.Dallas Buyers Club stands as a story of survival against all odds, interwoven with strong performances and strong opinions.",4,Performances Pull This True-To-Life Tale Along,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,3112,"['decade', 'was', 'small', 'list', 'movie', 'subjects', 'virtually', 'guaranteed', 'earn', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'One', 'coveted', 'roles', 'was', 'someone', 'AIDS', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'gave', 'majestic', 'turn', 'Philadelphia', 'floodgates', 'opened', 'wide', 'slowed', 'down', 'dramatically', 'society', 'changed', 'became', 'used', 'HIV/AIDS', 'part', 'daily', 'social', 'contract', 'new', 'fears', 'arose', 'challenge', 'dramatic', 'audiences', 'millions', 'people', 'rise', 'AIDS', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'bait', 'acting', 'accolades', 'was', 'nightmarish', 'reality', 'dealt', 'world', 'scarcely', 'ready', 'understand', 'times', 'people', 'struggled', 'survive', 'way', 'knew', 'how', 'story', 'one', 'desperate', 'unstoppable', 'souls.Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'tale', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'trailer-dwelling', 'electrician', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'haze', 'bottles', 'bimbos', 'Then', 'ball', 'dropped', 'T-cell', 'count', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'HIV', 'Using', 'brain', 'few', 'people', 'would', 'ever', 'imagine', 'had', 'hustled', 'wheeled', 'dealed', 'way', 'medical', 'trials', 'experimental', 'treatments', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'Once', 'realized', 'could', 'do', 'saw', 'opportunity', 'do', 'same', 'others', 'also', 'turning', 'nifty', 'profit', 'Hey', 'even', 'angels', 'have', 'little', 'dust', 'wings.Being', 'true', 'story', 'phenomenon', 'buyer', '8217', 'clubs', 'where', 'AIDS', 'patients', 'paid', 'memberships', 'got', 'medications', 'loophole', 'existing', 'drug', 'laws', '8217', 'inherently', 'dramatic', 'film', 'far', 'more', '8217', 'performances', '8217', 'storytelling', 'cover', 'years', 'Ron', '8217', 's', 'life', 'skating', 'away', 'long', 'arm', 'law', 'still', 'fighting', 'day-to-day', 'keep', 'body', 'healthy', 'Due', 'time', 'frame', 'drawn', 'out', 'times', '8217', 'where', 'find', 'watching', 'actors', 'more', 'skill', 'more', 'story.Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'form', 'unlikely', 'bond', 'not', 'only', 'characters', 'also', 'sheer', 'trial', 'put', 'bodies', 'roles', 'actors', 'were', 'freakishly', 'thin', 'varying', 'points', 'nothing', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Machinist', 'damn', 'close', 'yet', 'emanating', 'emaciated', 'frames', 'was', 'intensity', 'efforts', 'skills', 'paid', 'off', 'McConaughey', 'Leto', 'walked', 'away', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'did', 'film', 'movie', 'also', 'not-so-subtle', 'polemic', 'FDA', 'cozy', 'relationship', 'big', 'pharma', 'country', 'millions', 'millions', 'sick', 'people', 'desperate', 'need', 'specific', 'medications', 'watch', 'horror', 'FDA', 'ties', 'up', 'red', 'tape', 'blocks', 'approval', 'experimental', 'drugs', 'outright', 'lies', 'current', 'treatments', 'being', 'useful', 'name', 'record', 'setting', 'profits', 'Whether', 'not', 'unconscionable', 'behaviors', 'FDA', 'agents', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'accurate', 'taste', 'mouth', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'less', 'sweet.Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'story', 'survival', 'odds', 'interwoven', 'strong', 'performances', 'strong', 'opinions']",N/A

In this depressing (sorry) film he plays the real life Ron Woodroof.  Set in 1985 Dallas, Woodroof is a skilled electrician (like his daddy), who plays harder than he works.  He's a womanizing, part time bull-riding racist.  He also likes a little ""smack"" to go with his women and his booze.His negligence gets him a full blown case of HIV and ultimately AIDS.  Given a month to live (he makes it 7 years), Woodroof pulls out all the stops to get drugs to help fight the disease.  At the time, little was known about the disease but AZT was believed to have a positive effect and was approved for testing.  But certainly not in the large doses, Ron was taking.  His ill-gotten supply eventually runs out so he goes to Mexico to get some new treatment, none of which includes AZT or any other hard drug for that matter.Given that AIDS mostly affected homosexual men at the time, Woodroof was ostracized by his friends and co-workers.  He eventually has to put his homophobic beliefs aside and works with another patient at the hospital to create a ""club"" where membership includes free medicine.  This sidesteps the law against bringing drugs of any kind into the country and reselling them without a proper license.His friend Rayon (a memorable performance by Jared Leto) becomes his assistant and recruiter.  Woodroof ends up going to Japan, The Netherlands and China after his access to Mexico is curtailed.  All along the way, the DEA and other government entities stifle his ability to get treatment approved in the U. S.The film isn't pleasant to watch, but does raise the real issues of getting drugs fast tracked for those in dire need who have little to lose.

1682221,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00GUO2SKA,Paul Allaer,"[202, 230]","""Dallas Buyers Club"" (2013 release; 117 min.) brings the (real life) story of Ron Woodroof (played by Matthew McConaughey). As the movie opens, it is July, 1985 (we see a newspaper headline about Rock Hudson being outed with AIDS), and we are at a rodeo in Dallas where Woodroof is getting it on with two girls at the same time, while also placing bets on rodeo riders. A picture is quickly painted of Woodroof as the Texan wild and crazy guy. Yet soon we see him struggling, coughing and generally not feeling well and when he is admitted in the hospital, he gets the shocking news that he is HIV positive and is given only 30 days to live by the doctors. Woodroof goes ballistic and refuses to accept his fate, only to find that the FDA is allowing only one approved drug (ATZ) on the market. Woodroof eventually finds alternative medications in Mexico. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, let's talk about Matthew McConaughey's performance. He will simply blow you away. The very first shot of him (a head shot, in which he physically already looks terrible) is pretty shocking, to be honest (McConaughey reportedly lost 40 lbs. for the film). This role continue's McConaughey's recent string of top notch performances (Mud, Killer Joe, Bernie, The Paperboy, just to name those), and surely he will (or at least should) get strong consideration for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. (It just makes you wish that McConaughey wouldn't have wasted so many years playing those tiresome rom-com roles time and again.) Second, much has been said as well about Jared Leto's role. He first appears about 30 min. into the movie as the cross-gender dressing gay Rayon, to become Woodroof's business partner. It most certainly is a great performance (and is openly touted for Best Supporting Actor Oscar) but in my book, it doesn't come anywhere close to McConaughey's. Jennifer Garner has a small role as one of the Dallas Mercy hospital doctors, and gets completely blown away by both McConaughey and Leto. Third, this movie is most capably directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Caf&eacute; de Flore"". Fourth, the movie does not put either the FDA or Big Pharma in a kind light, as we are given the impression that both are in cahoots and do not care what is best for the public at large (I have no idea to what extent this was or is the case). Last but not least, there is an excellent collection of songs featured in the movie, with many staples from the 1970s and 80s including a number of T Rex songs (Rayon is obsessed with T Rex's Marc Bolan). But beware: the movie soundtrack (which is available here on Amazon) features primarily music ""inspired by"", rather then ""from"" the movie, and is not an accurate reflection of what you hear in the movie.""Dallas Buyers Club"" makes for an emotionally invested and moving experience that will tuck at your heart.

The 116 minute movie is Rated R. There are some highly sexual and sensual scenes, nudity, and bad language, as well as adult themes. It is based on a true story. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, this Indie was made with a modest shoestring budget of just$5 million dollars.Ron Woodroof (portrayed by Matthew McConaughey), is a rodeo junkie and electrician by trade. It is 1985, and he is man&#8217;s man. The movie opens with him having sex while watching a man thrown from a bull.A heavy drinker and drug user,and while fighting a persistent cough, Woodroof winds up in the hospital where he is diagnosed with AIDS, and given just 30 days to live.Woodroof goes through denial. Rock Hudson recently died of AIDS. The disease at the time was associated with homosexuals. Realizing that unprotected sex with women, intraveneous drug using prostitutes and the like, Woodroof has no doubt how he&#8217;d contracted the disease. What he isn&#8217;t ready for is the mistreatment and bullying by friends. (If I did not know McConaughey was in the film, I never would have recognized him. Losing close to fifty pounds, he is a skeleton of a man; sporting skin wrapped around bones &#8211;muscle and meat completely absent).Determined to fight the disease, Woodroof researches the illness, and medical treatments available, both conventional and unconventional.While being trated by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), he learns thatZidovudine (AZT) is in the testing stages. Groups are being selected, some receiving the drug, some a placebo (sugar pill). Here, Woodroof meets Rayon (Jared Leto), a transexual and serious drug abuser. Rayon has HIV, and is in the AZT trials.Becoming highly informed, Woodroof begins treatment in Mexico. The drugs used are not illegal, or dangerous, butare notF.D.A. approved, and therefore create a border-crossing, distribution issue. Teaming up with Rayon, the two couple their talents; Rayon with his connections to the gay community (where, regardless of sterotypes,AIDSisprevelant), and Woodroof, as the supplier of AIDS treatment medication, starts a club where the meds are free, but the membership is $400 a month.Trouble with the government, local police, andstaff at the hospital, Woodroof and Rayon fight a constant legal battle for the rightto save themselves and others who are infected and have been classified as terminally ill, while engaged in wars agianst their own demons.Performances by McConaughey and Leto were amazing. There is no doubt why the two won Academys. No doubt. While it is not one of my favorite movies of, it was a very good movie. I did not play with my phone, post on Facebook or Tweet. This says a lot.

Dying men, families and friends who rejected them. Homemade signs as anyone entered town saying &#34;BillyBob is a f*****, and he has AIDS. Funeral homes who would not take a person who had died with HIV. I could go on and on, but this film gives us a first hand experience.&#34;Dallas Buyers Club,&#34; directed by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e gives us the story of a man, who had unprotected sex, mainlined drugs and developed HIV. You can find this kind of story anywhere, but it is the performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto that bring this film to life. Ron Woodroof, played by McConaughey was a real-life figure. Diagnosed with HIV he could not believe it, a heterosexual man, cowboy, rodeo man, found himself with a 30 day life sentence. Unable to be part of the AZT trials, he began exploring alternative medications, went to Mexico and got better. He became partners with the men he detested the most, and soon became friends with them.Jared Leto, as the transsexual, Rayon, is the epitome of an actor that transcends space and time. He deserves the Academy Award for his portrayal. We become emotionally involved with these two characters as they try to save their kind, while at the same time making money by charging to belong to the 'Club' and obtaining medications to keep them alive. Fighting the FDA, the physicians, big Pharma and any legal entity , they did their thing. Both actors lost a great deal of weight fir these roles, and it shows. We are waiting for them to keel over.Try not to come to this film with pre-conceived ideas about this community. Let yourself into the story, and believe and observe their life.

He became a one man ACT UP movement. Jared Leto, in an amazing transformation of gender and sexual identity,  personifies the plight of outcasts who are swept along on his mad journey.

1682260,A1VHGHK5NN7NGN,B00GUO2SKA,Raymond Louis Llompart,"[0, 1]","simply, and a big IF, by chance.Matthew McConaughey gives a solid, quite engaging performance. I have no way to make an analogy since I had never seen him  acting, but the little I hear is that he lost a lot of weight for this role, but you will barely see the results unless you have a clear portrait of him as the stud that he has been in the past------a totally RIPPED body.But if you don't, then he appears quite normal during most of the movie, makeup taking care of the ""facial wasting"" that consumes an Aids patient's face towards the final stage-----indeed,for years before in so many cases.That does not help the movie.But, gladly, it does nothing to detract from what is a very confident portrayal of this, as I stated before, in exact level of importance:1-LOWLIFE2-HUSTLER3-Aids patient4-""activist"" by serendipity.Perhaps this is where the movie faces its greatest, most intractable problem of trust.The character has been a hustler all his life, just about,it would seem, and in desperation starts to find ways in which to get some of the substances that are being tried through studies in which, alas, yet inevitably, you have some of those in a trial taking nothing but a pill of sugar, say.This problem did not end with Aids, but arguably it was the Aids community and its most ardent Activists (""ACT UP"", for example) that brought the issue to the fore------and fighting the FDA again and again, was able to finally win the battle and have many of these trials, whatever degree of positive signs of control over the virus with a substance, let it be released to a fast-dying population. The matter, again,is still in contention with some Aids drugs, but even more so with Cancer drugs that may increase your lifespan by perhaps a year.The film offers us a relative indictment against the FDA, that carries too much weight for me to contend right here in a most methodical way, but let us just say that a deeply complex issue is reduced to a simplistic, perhaps even homophobic fight which confuses and distorts the issue at hand in a way that is irresponsible for the filmmaker.One has to wonder what can a young audience take away from this movies' management of such a sensitive issue when such complexity is rendered so cynically and thinly.The protagonist, as I said before, is no activist working for a cause-------or even for HIS cause. While at first you see the desperation that impending death brings to his behaviour, soon you can see that in true hustlers' manner this sham of a human being goes on to try to establish a so-called ""Buyers' club"" (as with Marijuana in the past 10 years or so, again, set up by Aids patients, yet used MANY TIMES as a front for anyone wanting to buy great pot-----this writer having been a not too amused observer).It cannot be stated with enough passion the PHONINESS of his ""large-scale"" endeavor,what with going to Japan, Mexico, setting post at a motel where, yes, you can get the drugs (AZT, primarily, it would seem) for FREE, BUT the monthly membership is $500.00........This is all presented in such a silly, haphazard way that no intelligent person would buy into this. Yet, one of the lures of the film is that it is a ""true story"". Well, it may all have happened, but it comes across as a complete sham since the man, we have come to confidently believe, can barely get through a conversation without a curse, less so flying to Japan to shop for medications.This repulsive ""dude"", one could exaggerate, make us all go ""right-wing"" and think that after all, you deserve anything you get.The film's irresponsible way to ""celebrate"" this man as an example of all those with the GUTS, the nerve, the heart-breaking act of fighting the government (mind you, many of these having been Heterosexual persons, not gay) is perplexing, no more than at the end when a group awaits his arrival to thank him for his ""success"".Whatever CONCRETE success is never entirely clear, but we can be confident, TOTALLY so, that this man wasn't doing this for anyone but himself.We should perhaps remember this film for having the most despicable example of an Aids patient out there, and come to think of it, such a thought must be accompanied by the fact that he isn't gay,as generally has been the case with films depicting Aids patients, but a poor, dispossessed, white trash STRAIGHT IV user.The creators of this ""spectacle"" had the chance of offering us the opportunity to find a heterosexual IV user with Aids,one with a few more bits of humanity in him, and yet we are left with one more caricature of the IV user as little more than a con artist, self-absorbed  and repulsive.",3,"A lowlife HUSTLER first, AIDS victim second, and ACTIVIST, well......",1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,4632,"['simply', 'big', 'IF',

1682285,A2ET0V06QC9EF2,B00GUO2SKA,Robert A. Ladner,"[0, 0]","In the early days of what we call now the AIDS epidemic, people didn't know how they got it or what they could do to stay alive. AZT was the only thing that worked, and it was like the early days of chemotherapy for cancer: the cure was worse than the disease, unless what you really wanted to do was to live, at which point you would put up with awful side effects in order to stay alive. This is a story of one man who devoted his life to keeping alive, crossing borders and breaking laws to get the drugs he needed to stay ahead of the disease, and in the process helped unknown hundreds of others with AIDS to eke out a few more months or years in their lives before their immune systems totally crashed and they died.  How he did it and how long he kept on doing it is the story.At one level, it is like watching &#34;Titanic:&#34; You know the ship is going to sink and everybody you care about is going to die. People die &#34;movie deaths&#34; in this show, and while it's not pretty to watch, it doesn't come close to the horrible ways some people died because of AIDS.  If you have known the disease since the late 1980s, as I have, you know what AZT toxicity does, and how the opportunistic infections that kill you with AIDS act on your body and what you can look like when you're circling the drain. None of that in this film, and if you had seen a little more of it you would have understood the screaming horror that so many faced in the days before anti-retrovirals.  But this is not a documentary about the FDA turning its back on &#34;unproven&#34; drugs that worked sometimes, and the lives that so many people lived in self-experimentation and self-medication, the hundreds of people whose lives became one elaborate self-created clinical trial after another.  It's the story of one angry man who didn't understand why he was dealt the hand that Fate had given him, but he was not going to give up to the disease or the bureaucracy or the law, and in so doing he was going to stay afloat for another hundred days and hold up some others with him instead of dragging them down. And by the end of the movie, the ship has gone down and everybody you care about is gone, but in the process you have seen a lot of bravery and a lot of determination and a lot of ways that people make up their mind that whatever it costs, they want to live one more day.",4,Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey deserved their Oscars,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2368,"['early', 'days', 'what', 'call', 'now', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'stay', 'alive', 'AZT', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'worked', 'was', 'early', 'days', 'chemotherapy', 'cancer', 'cure', 'was', 'worse', 'disease', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'live', 'point', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'awful', 'side', 'effects', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'devoted', 'life', 'keeping', 'alive', 'crossing', 'borders', 'breaking', 'laws', 'get', 'drugs', 'needed', 'stay', 'ahead', 'disease', 'process', 'helped', 'unknown', 'hundreds', 'others', 'AIDS', 'eke', 'out', 'few', 'more', 'months', 'years', 'lives', 'immune', 'systems', 'totally', 'crashed', 'died', 'How', 'did', 'how', 'long', 'kept', 'doing', 'story.At', 'one', 'level', 'watching', '34', 'Titanic', '34', 'know', 'ship', 'going', 'sink', 'everybody', 'care', 'going', 'die', 'People', 'die', '34', 'movie', 'deaths', '34', 'show', 'not', 'pretty', 'watch', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'horrible', 'ways', 'people', 'died', 'AIDS', 'have', 'known', 'disease', 'late', '1980s', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'AZT', 'toxicity', 'how', 'opportunistic', 'infections', 'kill', 'AIDS', 'act', 'body', 'what', 'can', 'look', 'when', ""'re"", 'circling', 'drain', 'None', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'screaming', 'horror', 'so', 'many', 'faced', 'days', 'anti-retrovirals', 'not', 'documentary', 'FDA', 'turning', 'back', '34', 'unproven', '34', 'drugs', 'worked', 'sometimes', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'lived', 'self-experimentation', 'self-medication', 'hundreds', 'people', 'lives', 'became', 'one', 'elaborate', 'self-created', 'clinical', 'trial', 'story', 'one', 'angry', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'dealt', 'hand', 'Fate', 'had', 'given', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'disease', 'bureaucracy', 'law', 'so', 'doing', 'was', 'going', 'stay', 'afloat', 'hundred', 'days', 'hold', 'up', 'others', 'instead', 'dragging', 'down', 'end', 'movie', 'ship', 'gone', 'down', 'everybody', 'care', 'gone', 'process', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'bravery', 'lot', 'determination', 'lot', 'ways', 'people', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'want', 'live', 'one', 'more', 'day']",N/A

There was also outstanding supporting work by Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto, who played a transgender AIDS patient named Rayon. When the movie begins, we are introduced to Ron Woodruff, a hard-drinking, sex-crazed, racist and homophobic man whose life is falling apart. As time progresses, he makes a gradual change to becoming a man who values his (and others') lives more due to his illness. He is also a man who doesn't give up or give in, as evidenced by his multiple run-ins with the FDA and the DEA, and symbolized by the final frames of the film. And more than anything, that is what I think the movie is about: overcoming when the odds are against you. This is a powerful and moving story, based in fact, which deserved every award it received at the Oscars. Matthew McConnaughey, on somewhat of a winning streak lately, put in some of his finest work here and went the extra mile by making a significant physical transformation to inhabit the character and person of Ron Woodruff. Jared Leto also deserves mention in this regard for his transformation as well. Jennifer Garner also does well as Ron's doctor and (eventual) friend, one of the few people not afflicted with AIDS who sees his plight and tries to help him. Her performance was imbued with a certain kindness and gentleness which I found rather appealing. As far as technical qualities are concerned, Jean-Marc Vallee did a great job directing, the cinematography was excellent and I thought that the music was good as well. There's really nothing to complain about with this film at all.

1682340,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00GUO2SKA,Sheryl Fechter,"[7, 9]","It seemed to be a whole different world in the eighties.  Presidential elections, foreign issues gone awry, joblessness, the war on drugs, ""Just say no"", then along with this unrest was the balance of a false lulling of stability, which was easy to be secure in.  I personally was working for a major pharmaceutical company in their lab department.  Then HIV-AIDS hit like a hurricane, leaving us all baffled, unaware and totally perplexed.  Especially for the subject, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), who is a hard playing Texas rodeo man, a good old boy along with his other homophobic cowboy friends.  A drug user and womanizer, he set the precedence of how we were still quite unaware and ignorant of how one would acquire HIV at the time.  Upon reaching 1985, by the time of his diagnosis, Ron starts to fight his prognosis; which is,You've got 30 days to live.  Get your affairs in order.He begins to learn all different ways that the medicine companies do, more so do not, work with the doctors and patients to help find the cure for this awful disease.  Ron learns that the side-effects are more deadly than most anything else and that the real medicines to help cannot be gotten here in the U.S.  They are labeled unapproved although not illegal.  This puts anybody in the middle of a paradox where life sustaining medicines cannot be gained merely because of testing technicalities.While Ron returns to the hospital to inquire about AZT and how to gain more of this medicine, he meets up with the compassionate and sympathetic doctor who was there during his diagnosis, Eve (Jennifer Garner). While she is informing him that there are still no procedures available, none similar to the AZT trials.  No matter how hard Ron is trying to find ways around these, each of his ideas are thwarted. A man is observing the conversation across the hall from them, Rayon (Jared Leto), who is a homosexual man and a transvestite with HIV himself.  He too is looking for help, extremely ill and not receiving anything real.During such travail with these two men and a huge dichotomy in his Law Enforcement brother, Tucker (Steve Zahn), with the legalities of this all concerning his brother's life and his own sworn oath to uphold the law, the sufferings of everyone are even more apparent. Ron starts believing they could be helpful to one another, Rayon and himself, so they begin the ""Dallas Buyers Club"".  Instead of having people with their illness purchase separate doses of medications and/or supplements, they have them join their club of members for a fee.  Ron frequently travels down to Mexico to see a Dr. there (Griffin Dunne) who used to be one in the U.S. and transports these unapproved medicines back to the States.  It takes time for the Ron and Rayon to achieve their success,  Ron has to overcome his own homophobic tendencies concerning Rayon.  With all the emotion of human tragedy this story plays out at every angle and in every way with an overwhelming amount of desperation in Ron and their members.The complete standout of this 'based on a true story' movie is its character portrayals.  They are more than stellar when considering each McConaughey and Leto dropped an estimated forty pounds off of their already slim bodies.  They appeared emaciated, gaunt and vaguely skeletal, offering this terrifying state from the very start.  From the very beginning, it shocked me to see this and the unrecognizable Jared Leto.  If I didn't already know he was in this movie ahead of viewing, I would not have guessed it.  I seriously doubt that I could have.Jean-Marc Vallee directs this American horror story in a linear fashion. Without veering off into subplots to take the focus off of the outstanding pain the central characters are experiencing.  The cinematographer (Yves Belanger) does a wonderful, if not masterful, job showing in exquisite detail every emotion to be felt. The scene concerning Woodroof in the singly lit, very darkened room with a bevy of butterflies is superlative in every way.  Belanger captures the emotion of being so alone while being so surrounded in a single moment.  Surrounded also by what could potentially save his life, but no way to capture it is palpably horrific in its full understanding.  The camera work in this movie is very nuanced and doesn't miss the small things, the things you want, more so, have to see that capture a person, feeling, or an emotion. The ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is an extremely dark thematic movie that sheds light onto a time that we couldn't understand.  All we knew of the time was we could feel it. Feel totally helpless during it, feel it horrifically and this is exactly what the movie delivers.",5,"""Newsflash For Y'All...There Ain't Nothin' Out There That Can Kill Ron Woodroof In 30 Days"" - Ron",1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,4688,"['seemed', 'be', 'whole', 'different', 'world', 'eighties', 'Presidential', 'elections', 'foreign', 'issues', 'gone', 'awry', 'joblessness', 'war', 'drugs', 'Just', 'say', 'no', 'then', 'along', 'unrest', 'was', 'balance', 'false', 'lulling', 'stability', 'was', 'easy', 'be', 'secure', 'personally', 'was', 'working', 'major', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'lab', 'department', 'Then', 'HIV-AIDS', 'hit', 'hurricane', 'leaving', 'baffled', 'unaware', 'totally', 'perplexed', 'Especially', 'subject', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'hard', 'playing', 'Texas', 'rodeo', 'man', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'other', 'homophobic', 'cowboy', 'friends', 'drug', 'user', 'womanizer', 'set', 'precedence', 'how', 'were', 'still', 'quite', 'unaware', 'ignorant', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'acquire', 'HIV', 'time', 'reaching', '1985', 'time', 'diagnosis', 'Ron', 'fight', 'prognosis', ""'ve"", 'got', '30', 'days', 'live', 'Get', 'affairs', 'order.He', 'begins', 'learn', 'different', 'ways', 'medicine', 'companies', 'do', 'more', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'doctors', 'patients', 'help', 'find', 'cure', 'awful', 'disease', 'Ron', 'side-effects', 'are', 'more', 'deadly', 'most', 'anything', 'else', 'real', 'medicines', 'help', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'gotten', 'here', 'U.S', 'are', 'labeled', 'unapproved', 'not', 'illegal', 'anybody', 'middle', 'paradox', 'where', 'life', 'sustaining', 'medicines', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'gained', 'merely', 'testing', 'technicalities.While', 'Ron', 'returns', 'hospital', 'inquire', 'AZT', 'how', 'gain', 'more', 'medicine', 'up', 'compassionate', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'who', 'was', 'diagnosis', 'Eve', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'informing', 'are', 'still', 'procedures', 'available', 'none', 'similar', 'AZT', 'trials', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'Ron', 'trying', 'find', 'ways', 'ideas', 'are', 'thwarted', 'man', 'observing', 'conversation', 'hall', 'Rayon', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'homosexual', 'man', 'transvestite', 'HIV', 'too', 'looking', 'help', 'extremely', 'ill', 'not', 'receiving', 'anything', 'real.During', 'such', 'travail', 'two', 'men', 'huge', 'dichotomy', 'Law', 'Enforcement', 'brother', 'Tucker', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'legalities', 'concerning', 'brother', 'life', 'own', 'sworn', 'oath', 'uphold', 'law', 'sufferings', 'everyone', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'apparent', 'Ron', 'believing', 'could', 'be', 'helpful', 'one', 'Rayon', 'begin', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'Instead', 'having', 'people', 'illness', 'purchase', 'separate', 'doses', 'medications', 'and/or', 'supplements', 'have', 'join', 'club', 'members', 'fee', 'Ron', 'frequently', 'down', 'Mexico', 'see', 'Dr.', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'U.S.', 'unapproved', 'medicines', 'back', 'States', 'time', 'Ron', 'Rayon', 'achieve', 'success', 'Ron', 'overcome', 'own', 'homophobic', 'tendencies', 'concerning', 'Rayon', 'emotion', 'human', 'tragedy', 'story', 'out', 'angle', 'way', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'desperation', 'Ron', 'members.The', 'complete', 'standout', ""'based"", 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'character', 'portrayals', 'are', 'more', 'stellar', 'when', 'considering', 'McConaughey', 'Leto', 'dropped', 'estimated', 'forty', 'pounds', 'already', 'slim', 'bodies', 'appeared', 'emaciated', 'gaunt', 'vaguely', 'skeletal', 'offering', 'terrifying', 'state', 'very', 'start', 'very', 'beginning', 'shocked', 'see', 'unrecognizable', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'was', 'movie', 'ahead', 'viewing', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'guessed', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'could', 'have.Jean-Marc', 'Vallee', 'American', 'horror', 'story', 'linear', 'fashion', 'veering', 'off', 'subplots', 'take', 'focus', 'outstanding', 'pain', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'experiencing', 'cinematographer', 'Yves', 'Belanger', 'wonderful', 'not', 'masterful', 'job', 'showing', 'exquisite', 'detail', 'emotion', 'be', 'felt', 'scene', 'concerning', 'Woodroof', 'singly', 'lit', 'very', 'darkened', 'room', 'bevy', 'butterflies', 'superlative', 'way', 'Belanger', 'emotion', 'being', 'so', 'alone', 'being', 'so', 'surrounded', 'single', 'moment', 'Surrounded', 'also', 'what', 'could', 'potentially', 'save', 'life', 'way', 'capture', 'palpably', 'horrific', 'full', 'understanding', 'camera', 'work', 'movie', 'very', 'nuanced', ""n't"", 'miss', 'small', 'things', 'things', 'want', 'more', 'so', 'have', 'see', 'capture', 'person', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'extremely', 'dark', 'thematic', 'movie', 'light', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'knew', 'time', 'was', 'could', 'feel', 'Feel', 'totally', 'helpless', 'feel', 'horrifically', 'exactly', 'what', 'movie', 'delivers']",N/A

1682346,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00GUO2SKA,SJreviewsEverything,"[0, 0]","The first scene of Dallas Buyers Club is disorienting, immediately confounding the viewer with obscured vision, indecipherable gasps, and lack of context. The next several scenes are similarly abrupt, provocative, and compelling. It sets the stage for what feels like a film.Turns out your gut reaction is wrong, though. This movie, while starting with promise, winds out to be your typical sentimentalist junk about the AIDS crisis during the 1980s. I don&#8217;t mean to sound heartless or uncaring, but we&#8217;ve seen plenty of movies like this before.Based on true events, Dallas Buyers Club is the story of an &#8220;odd couple&#8221; of a homophobic loser joining forces with a transgender woman to deal, and eventually set up a business, to distribute medication which alleviates the symptoms of AIDS. Each has their own selfish reasons for entering into this arrangement (elements which I think make the story compelling), but it predictably falls into the sappy selflessness you&#8217;d expect. This is truly the stuff Oscar dreams are made of.I don&#8217;t mean to say this movie was terrible, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t good. If the events in the film are all true ones (which, for all I know, they may have been), they certainly weren&#8217;t set up well enough. For instance, Matthew McConaughey&#8217;s Ron Woodroof is somehow able to break through his first con job, as a cancer-stricken priest, without breaking a sweat&#8230; It&#8217;s suspending a lot of disbelief that, given the devastating circumstances of being HIV+, Woodroof can all of a sudden develop alternate personae faster than That&#8217;s So Raven.Lazy touches like this make the film overall underwhelming for me.

[It's an amusing story about his early high school issues with acne.] You would never be able to tell that from the way he looks in Dallas Buyers Club.Seriously, McConaughey looks awful, and that's saying a lot considering who he is. He looks like he's wasting away, which is appropriate to the character of Ron Woodroof, who is dying of AIDS.In the 80s, when I grew up, we were going to die of one of two things:1. &#34;Russia&#34; (in quotes because it wasn't really Russia; it was the USSR) was going to destroy the world in nuclear fire (or a computer mistake was. It was probably 50/50 which direction that would go).2. We were all going to die of &#34;the AIDS.&#34;Dallas Buyers Club completely captures the horror of discovering having HIV in the 80s and the prejudice that went with it. [Like when I was in middle school and all of my friends told me (completely seriously) that I was going to die because I sat in the same chair as someone with AIDS that had visited our classroom.] McConaughey is absolutely brilliant. The wail he releases in his car once he has actually confronted what's going on is... I have no other word than chilling.Seriously, I have never thought much of McConaughey other than that he's mostly a pretty boy that can memorize lines. He's never stood out to me as more than someone with a charming smile, but, in this, he is amazing. His willingness to destroy his body for the part rivals anything Christian Bale has ever done, and he brings a stellar performance along with it. If he doesn't get best actor for this role, it will be a huge injustice.Jared Leto's performance is also incredible as the fictional conglomeration character Rayon. The relationship between Woodroof and Rayon is demonstrative of Woodroof's changing views as he formed relationships in the community suffering from the same fate as he.AIDS and the fear of AIDS doesn't carry with it the same weight as it used to, and I don't think people growing up in the 90s and later have the same understanding of HIV as people who went through the 80s when it suddenly became an epidemic. Safe sex has become normative, at least, the idea of it has. Prior to 80s and HIV, the idea of using &#34;protection&#34; during sex was mostly to prevent unwanted pregnancies. At least, that's my perception of it.At any rate, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerful movie, the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it.",5,Best Actor?,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2627,"['heard', 'interview', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'NPR', 'while', 'back', 'how', 'family', 'lost', 'lawsuit', 'won', 'most', 'attractive', 'award', 'such', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', '[', 'amusing', 'story', 'early', 'high', 'school', 'issues', 'acne', ']', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'way', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club.Seriously', 'McConaughey', 'awful', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'who', 'wasting', 'away', 'appropriate', 'character', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS.In', '80s', 'when', 'grew', 'up', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'one', 'two', 'things:1', '34', 'Russia', '34', 'quotes', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'Russia', 'was', 'USSR', 'was', 'going', 'destroy', 'world', 'nuclear', 'fire', 'computer', 'mistake', 'was', 'was', 'probably', '50/50', 'direction', 'would', 'go', '.2', 'were', 'going', 'die', '34', 'AIDS.', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'completely', 'horror', 'discovering', 'having', 'HIV', '80s', 'prejudice', 'went', '[', 'when', 'was', 'middle', 'school', 'friends', 'told', 'completely', 'seriously', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'sat', 'same', 'chair', 'someone', 'AIDS', 'had', 'visited', 'classroom', ']', 'McConaughey', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'wail', 'car', 'once', 'actually', 'confronted', 'what', 'going', 'have', 'other', 'word', 'chilling.Seriously', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'McConaughey', 'other', 'mostly', 'pretty', 'boy', 'can', 'memorize', 'lines', 'never', 'stood', 'out', 'more', 'someone', 'charming', 'smile', 'amazing', 'willingness', 'destroy', 'body', 'part', 'anything', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'ever', 'done', 'stellar', 'performance', ""n't"", 'get', 'best', 'actor', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'huge', 'injustice.Jared', 'Leto', 'performance', 'also', 'incredible', 'fictional', 'conglomeration', 'character', 'Rayon', 'relationship', 'Woodroof', 'Rayon', 'demonstrative', 'Woodroof', 'changing', 'views', 'formed', 'relationships', 'community', 'suffering', 'same', 'fate', 'he.AIDS', 'fear', 'AIDS', ""n't"", 'carry', 'same', 'weight', 'used', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'growing', 'up', '90s', 'later', 'have', 'same', 'understanding', 'HIV', 'people', 'who', 'went', '80s', 'when', 'suddenly', 'became', 'epidemic', 'Safe', 'sex', 'become', 'normative', 'least', 'idea', 'Prior', '80s', 'HIV', 'idea', 'using', '34', 'protection', '34', 'sex', 'was', 'mostly', 'prevent', 'unwanted', 'pregnancies', 'least', 'perception', 'it.At', 'rate', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'powerful', 'movie', 'most', 'powerful', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

What makes this movie so much more ground breaking and shocking is that it is based on true events and the real Ron Woodard, who took his life in his own hands, said doctors don't know everything, and self medicated.... proving that sometimes, even doctors aren't always right. They said he had 30 days to live and Ron lived 7 years after being diagnosed with HIV.What was really heartbreaking is his initial diagnosis. He goes through denial. Of course, back in 1985 they didn't know much about the virus. The assumption was that only intravenous drug users and homosexuals were the at risk population. When Ron is doing his own research, he stumbles across a sentence that mentions those who have unprotected sex are at risk as well. That's when it hits him - the doctors didn't mix up his blood with someone else's (as he first claims).... he remembers all of the risky sex he's had and he knows that he truly does have the HIV virus.Jared Leto plays a cross dresser, and he won best supporting actor at the Oscars, a well deserved win for him as well. At first, McConaughey's character is homophobic, but once him and Leto team up to start the buyers club, he realizes that gay people are humans too.I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen the movie yet. The emotion is raw, the acting is incredible, and the story as a whole will really make you think about our war on HIV and AIDS. For a man to have the courage to step up and realize that the subjects of an AZT test trial are just getting sicker, and for him to go out and take matters into his own hands is really inspiring. It also goes to show that for the most part, the FDA might be a good idea, but it still is a flawed system  in some aspects.If you're up for an emotional, true story with great acting and a wonderful script, get this movie.

1682382,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B00GUO2SKA,T. Briggs,"[17, 25]","This movie bothered me for many reasons.  It would be as if 12 Years a Slave had been told from the point of view of the Slave Master who was suffering from tired arms after whipping his housekeeper.What I mean is the protagonist is not a very likeable or likely hero in the Battle for Our Lives in the War on AIDS.  He's an ugly womanizing homophobe with a single redeeming quality, that being, he's tenacious as hell.  But aren't we all when our lives are on the line?  But this is called The Dallas Buyers Club and not The War on AIDS.  There is talk that it doesn't reflect the reality of Ron Woodruff, who some claim was bisexual.  But really, who cares?This was 2 movies.The first movie is the movie seen by those who know AIDS as something someone else has to worry about.  That's the majority of Americans.  They seem to like this movie and the characters as portrayed by McC and Leto.  We see him lose everything except his dignity on the way down and then we see him use his dignity as currency to rebuild his life even as those around him are losing theirs.  One of the saddest moments was when a straight woman shows up at his DBC and in the same moment we learn with him that she has full blown AIDS we hear them screwing their brains out and we understand.  I'm not sure we'd be as understanding if this was a movie about gays and it was two men doing that.Which brings me to the other movie.  And that's the film seen by those of us who have survived this long as the plague took everyone we knew and flushed them down the toilet of life.  For us this plague started as someone turned the lights out on the Disco ball and the Anti-Christ was elected to office.  The first wave seemed to be the hemophiliac kids whose neighbors, churches and schools made their last days a nightmare.  Then wave after wave of friends who would show up at happy hour with their diagnoses but otherwise looking fine.  They'd go on meds and be dead within months.  If they were lucky enough to have a partner the next few months was filled with nausea and diarrhea, night sweats and a slow and painful death followed by the deadpatient's family, most of whom had written off their gay sibling, coming to claim their loot often times leaving the partner in an empty home or on the street.  It is a memory of ACT-UP, a giant quilt, cancelled insurance plans.  Friends found hanging in their basement days after getting their diagnosis and funeral after funeral, sometimes two a day for about 10 years.  None of them had a nickel to join a buyers club though we heard they were starting up in places like NYC and SFO.  But ACT-UP took care of that and soon everyone could get a drug that had once been shelved for side effects and lack of efficacy but which soon became the most expensive drug ever produced.  And after Ryan White was terrorized by his friends, school and church Congress finally got the courage to pass the Ryan White Act which made those drugs available to everyone through State run plans.  Yes the drug companies made a fortune as did their investors.  We were the largest running experiment in the history of the world as millions of us signed up for every test, every med, any chance at a cure and we still died by the boatloads.It is 30 years later and American still can't make a movie about the horror we experienced as a nation because the nation didn't experience it.  They left us to die or fight for our lives on our own and then got snippy because we were successful and jealous that our dying became a cause celebre.  I've lost dozens of close friends and many more dozens of acquaintences.  For us this movie doesn't show the face of AIDS in America, though as expected, the gay guy does die but the protagonist's death is told to us in white text on a black screen right before the credits roll.  One wonders who claimed the body.  But considering the movie is not called Cowboy with AIDS or AIDS in America the ultimate fate of the subject of the movie, the actual Dallas Buyers Club seemed like a footnote.  The same kind of footnote this movie made of the milions who weren't theoretically straight cowboys who learned to tolerate a drag queen/trans/whatever.  This film didn't even really dignify Leto's character with any real depth other than just another boy in a dress.It must have been a tough roll for McC to play and for that he deserves an award.  Leto seemed a bit comfortable in his role which earned him an award.  But the Academy was smart in leaving it there because the fact is, as a movie, it just kind of sucked in so many ways and the more I think about it the more offensive it becomes.But it's worth the watch even if it offends more than it uplifts.",2,A Tale of Two Films,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,4698,"['movie', 'bothered', 'many', 'reasons', 'would', 'be', '12', 'Years', 'Slave', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Slave', 'Master', 'who', 'was', 'suffering', 'tired', 'arms', 'whipping', 'housekeeper.What', 'mean', 'protagonist', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'likely', 'hero', 'Battle', 'Lives', 'War', 'AIDS', 'ugly', 'womanizing', 'homophobe', 'single', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'being', 'tenacious', 'hell', 'are', ""n't"", 'when', 'lives', 'are', 'line', 'called', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'not', 'War', 'AIDS', 'talk', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'reality', 'Ron', 'Woodruff', 'who', 'claim', 'was', 'bisexual', 'really', 'who', 'was', '2', 'movies.The', 'first', 'movie', 'movie', 'seen', 'who', 'know', 'AIDS', 'something', 'someone', 'else', 'worry', 'about', 'majority', 'Americans', 'seem', 'like', 'movie', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'McC', 'Leto', 'see', 'lose', 'everything', 'dignity', 'way', 'down', 'then', 'see', 'use', 'dignity', 'currency', 'rebuild', 'life', 'even', 'are', 'losing', 'One', 'saddest', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'straight', 'woman', 'up', 'DBC', 'same', 'moment', 'learn', 'full', 'blown', 'AIDS', 'hear', 'screwing', 'brains', 'out', 'understand', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'understanding', 'was', 'movie', 'gays', 'was', 'two', 'men', 'doing', 'that.Which', 'brings', 'other', 'movie', 'film', 'seen', 'who', 'have', 'survived', 'long', 'plague', 'took', 'everyone', 'knew', 'flushed', 'down', 'toilet', 'life', 'plague', 'started', 'someone', 'turned', 'lights', 'out', 'Disco', 'ball', 'Anti-Christ', 'was', 'elected', 'office', 'first', 'wave', 'seemed', 'be', 'hemophiliac', 'kids', 'neighbors', 'churches', 'schools', 'made', 'last', 'days', 'nightmare', 'Then', 'wave', 'wave', 'friends', 'who', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'happy', 'hour', 'diagnoses', 'otherwise', 'looking', 'fine', ""'d"", 'go', 'meds', 'be', 'dead', 'months', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'partner', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'filled', 'nausea', 'diarrhea', 'night', 'sweats', 'slow', 'painful', 'death', 'followed', 'deadpatient', 'family', 'most', 'whom', 'had', 'written', 'off', 'gay', 'sibling', 'coming', 'claim', 'loot', 'often', 'leaving', 'partner', 'empty', 'home', 'street', 'memory', 'ACT-UP', 'giant', 'quilt', 'cancelled', 'insurance', 'plans', 'Friends', 'found', 'hanging', 'basement', 'days', 'getting', 'diagnosis', 'funeral', 'funeral', 'sometimes', 'two', 'day', '10', 'years', 'None', 'had', 'nickel', 'join', 'buyers', 'club', 'heard', 'were', 'starting', 'up', 'places', 'NYC', 'SFO', 'ACT-UP', 'took', 'care', 'soon', 'everyone', 'could', 'get', 'drug', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'shelved', 'side', 'effects', 'lack', 'efficacy', 'soon', 'became', 'most', 'expensive', 'drug', 'ever', 'produced', 'Ryan', 'White', 'was', 'terrorized', 'friends', 'school', 'church', 'Congress', 'finally', 'got', 'courage', 'pass', 'Ryan', 'White', 'Act', 'made', 'drugs', 'available', 'everyone', 'State', 'run', 'plans', 'Yes', 'drug', 'companies', 'made', 'fortune', 'did', 'investors', 'were', 'largest', 'running', 'experiment', 'history', 'world', 'millions', 'signed', 'up', 'test', 'med', 'chance', 'cure', 'still', 'died', 'boatloads.It', '30', 'years', 'later', 'American', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'horror', 'experienced', 'nation', 'nation', 'did', ""n't"", 'experience', 'left', 'die', 'fight', 'lives', 'own', 'then', 'got', 'snippy', 'were', 'successful', 'jealous', 'dying', 'became', 'cause', 'celebre', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'dozens', 'close', 'friends', 'many', 'more', 'dozens', 'acquaintences', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'face', 'AIDS', 'America', 'though', 'expected', 'gay', 'guy', 'die', 'protagonist', 'death', 'told', 'white', 'text', 'black', 'screen', 'right', 'credits', 'roll', 'One', 'wonders', 'who', 'claimed', 'body', 'considering', 'movie', 'not', 'called', 'Cowboy', 'AIDS', 'AIDS', 'America', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'subject', 'movie', 'actual', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'seemed', 'footnote', 'same', 'kind', 'footnote', 'movie', 'made', 'milions', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'theoretically', 'straight', 'cowboys', 'who', 'learned', 'tolerate', 'drag', 'queen/trans/whatever', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'dignify', 'Leto', 'character', 'real', 'depth', 'other', 'just', 'boy', 'dress.It', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'roll', 'McC', 'play', 'award', 'Leto', 'seemed', 'bit', 'comfortable', 'role', 'earned', 'award', 'Academy', 'was', 'smart', 'leaving', 'there', 'fact', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'sucked', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'more', 'think', 'more', 'offensive', 'watch', 'even', 'more', 'uplifts']",N/A

Losing over 70 pounds for the role Matthew plays a real-life HIV positive/AIDS patient who is infected with the disease in 1985, the beginning of the AIDS epidemic.Ron Woodroof (Matthew) is a straight rodeo cowboy who has negative feelings towards gay to the point of homophobia. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS (because of unsafe sex with multiple women) he soon finds his world upside down and realizes AIDS is not just a gay disease and that it has no boundaries.The film takes an honest look at how HIV/AIDS patients were treated during the Ronald Reagan years when , he as President, never once uttered the word AIDS and showed little compassion for those inflicted with it. If Reagan had assigned more money to AIDS research and for medicines to help people live longer and healthier lives thousands of men, women and children may be alive to this day.Once Ron Woodroof realizes the AZT drug (the only drug that was made available to AIDS patients at that time) was actually killing him even more he discovers that in other countries like Mexico and Japan there have been discoveries of new meds but they are not available in the U.S.. So, he arranges to go to these countries, bring in the pills and sells them to those who can afford them. Remarkably, when Ron was diagnosed he was told by doctors he had 30 days to live: he lived for seven more years!The &#34;Dallas Buyer's Club&#34; is nominated for an astonishing six Oscars this year including nominations for Matthew as Best Actor, Jared Leto (as a transgender HIV positive woman) as Best Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay and Best Picture.Matthew reportedly lost 70 lbs for the role and he does a virtuoso performance as an AIDS patient.",5,"""TRUTHFUL, HONEST AND EMOTIONAL""",1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1822,"['34', 'Dallas', 'Buyer', 'Club', '34', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'down', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'carrer', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'Losing', '70', 'pounds', 'role', 'Matthew', 'real-life', 'HIV', 'positive/AIDS', 'patient', 'who', 'infected', 'disease', '1985', 'beginning', 'AIDS', 'epidemic.Ron', 'Woodroof', 'Matthew', 'straight', 'rodeo', 'cowboy', 'who', 'negative', 'feelings', 'towards', 'gay', 'point', 'homophobia', 'Once', 'diagnosed', 'HIV/AIDS', 'unsafe', 'sex', 'multiple', 'women', 'soon', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'realizes', 'AIDS', 'not', 'just', 'gay', 'disease', 'boundaries.The', 'film', 'honest', 'look', 'how', 'HIV/AIDS', 'patients', 'were', 'treated', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'years', 'when', 'President', 'never', 'once', 'uttered', 'word', 'AIDS', 'showed', 'little', 'compassion', 'inflicted', 'Reagan', 'had', 'assigned', 'more', 'money', 'AIDS', 'research', 'medicines', 'help', 'people', 'live', 'longer', 'healthier', 'lives', 'thousands', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'alive', 'day.Once', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'AZT', 'drug', 'only', 'drug', 'was', 'made', 'available', 'AIDS', 'patients', 'time', 'was', 'actually', 'killing', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'countries', 'Mexico', 'Japan', 'have', 'been', 'discoveries', 'new', 'meds', 'are', 'not', 'available', 'U.S..', 'So', 'go', 'countries', 'bring', 'pills', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'Remarkably', 'when', 'Ron', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'was', 'told', 'doctors', 'had', '30', 'days', 'live', 'lived', 'seven', 'more', 'years', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyer', 'Club', '34', 'nominated', 'astonishing', 'six', 'Oscars', 'year', 'including', 'nominations', 'Matthew', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'transgender', 'HIV', 'positive', 'woman', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Picture.Matthew', 'reportedly', 'lost', '70', 'lbs', 'role', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'AIDS', 'patient']",N/A

I couldn't imagine being in Matthew McConaughey's shoes basically fighting a losing battle against the FDA.  It just seems so unfair that an organization can tell someone on the brink of death that they can't use a certain type of treatment that may potentially buy them time because it is not approved by the FDA.  I understand why there are the restrictions there are (i.e., the potential deadly and severe side-effects for various medications and legal implications), but when it comes to life or death, I think you should be allowed to give anything a shot.  What's the worst that could come of it?  There's a chance you will die.  I'm pretty sure most people would take that chance compared to a 0% chance of living without at least giving it a shot.

1682424,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00GUO2SKA,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0'The Dallas Buyers Club' is the first mainstream film that has the guts to question both the efficacy and legitimacy of Orthodox Medicine's early AIDS medication research as well as highlighting the unhealthy relationship between the researchers, doctors and pharmaceutical companies, who pushed toxic treatments on an unsuspecting public. The man who led the valiant crusade against this nasty coterie of entrenched interests was the unlikely Texas electrician and part-time rodeo cowboy, Ron Woodroof (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaghey), who went from being a redneck homophobe to a tolerant, alternative health activist.When we're first introduced to Woodroof, he's the epitome of what some may call 'Trailer Trash'. Woodroof pals around with his homophobic buddies, has sex with prostitutes and uses drugs like candy. After sustaining a work-related injury (he's zapped by a faulty electrical current), Woodroof's brought to the hospital to recover. The tests reveal that he's got AIDS and he's told he has 30 days to live. First Woodroof's in denial but remembers that he had unprotected sex with an intravenous drug user. As he researches causes of AIDS in the library, it dawns on him that his drug use in general probably was also a big factor leading to his illness. As we break into Act II, Woodruff's life is upended as he's ostracized by his community and must fend for himself as he seeks a cure.When AZT first came out, the double blind experiments prevented subjects from knowing whether they were getting the real thing or a placebo. Woodroof is forced to bribe a hospital worker to obtain the drug but after using it for a short time, finds his health getting worse. When his supply at the hospital runs out, it's then that he hears about a doctor in Mexico, Vass, who might have some AZT. It turns out that Dr. Vass was barred from practicing in the US after giving his patients non- approved, alternative medications. It's this Dr. Vass who enlightens Woodroof about the dangers of AZT and how it's completely toxic. He gives him the protein, peptide T, along with some other non-toxic medication and Woodroof finds himself getting better. I'm not sure if the medication did the trick or it simply was the lack of flooding his body with toxic stuff like AZT that stabilized the very ill Woodroof, but whatever the case, this Dr. Vass was on to something.After his health begins to improve, Woodroof gets the idea that he can make money by importing the alternative AIDS medications and selling them by subscription (Dallas Buyers Club members must pay $400 per month to get the medications); he smuggles them into the US dressed as a priest and claiming they're for his personal use. Earlier, Woodroof met a transsexual diagnosed with AIDS by the name of Rayon (Jared Leto) who he tries to avoid due to his homophobia. But after his own bout with the illness, Woodroof becomes more accepting of Rayon, who becomes his business partner, bringing in new clients from her contacts in the gay community.'Dallas Buyers Club' is perhaps the first mainstream film that criticizes both allopathic medicine and big Pharma. When Dr. Sevard finds out about the buyer's club, he castigates Woodroof because his efforts are interfering with his AZT trials. It's obvious that in the doctor's view of things, only orthodox medicine has the right to grant access to treatment for AIDS sufferers. Worse is the attitude of the FDA in the form of point man Richard Barkley, who ends up confiscating Woodroof's medications and threatens to have him jailed. Later, Woodroof attempts to challenge the FDA's new rules which make it illegal to dispense alternative medications for AIDS sufferers. While Woodroof loses in Federal Court (the Judge sympathizes but argues that legally, his hands are tied), he emerges as a hero to the gay community along with progressive sympathizers.Not everyone in the medical community views Woodroof as a demon. Gradually, Dr. Eve Saks comes around to his point of view. She's right however, when Woodroof gets angry over the fact that Rayon was taken to the hospital and given AZT while he was away. Dr. Saks tells Woodroof that ultimately Rayon died from her own drug usage and not from one or two days of AZT treatment. The idea that Woodroof would lash out like that is understandable given the fact that he had just learned of Rayon's death. But ultimately,Woodroof's blaming Rayon's death solely on AZT (especially for the short time she was administered the drug), was irrational.If there is one sour note in the film, it's in one of the closing credits. We're informed that due to Woodroof's efforts, AZT was modified so that it was less toxic and millions of AIDS sufferers were saved. I hardly believe that Woodroof would have been happy with such a statement. The whole point of the film was that Woodruff was a crusader who fought for alternative medications and he himself lived longer, not because of toxic pharmaceutical products but because he took benign alternative ones--which perhaps gave his body a better chance than the kind of medicines touted by mainstream physicians and their government minions.In the end, even Woodroof's alternative medications were not enough to prevent him from dying of AIDS. But he lived seven years longer than his initial diagnosis of 30 days. 'Dallas Buyers Club' not only bravely holds up a mirror to a medical establishment that has for too long been given a free pass in regards to increased scrutiny but it's also a perceptive tale of a man who transformed himself from a bigot and self-centered materialist to a compassionate healer with a moral and humanitarian core.",4,"McConaughey is superb as redneck homophobe transformed into

The film is based on the true-life tale of Ron Woodroof, an AIDS-infected person who began smuggling unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he found them effective at improving his symptoms.McConaughey's portrayal is realistic as morally-questionable fighter. His HIV diagnosis doesn't automatically cause Ron to become a pious individual. He realizes that he could make money by importing drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that the drugs are for his personal use. He partners in his business with Rayon (Jared Leto), an HIV-positive transgender woman, since she can bring many more clients.The pair establish the &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34;, charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. The film is enlightening in depicting that there were many AIDS-medication buyers clubs across the country. But if the long lines of people seeking the non-approved drugs (as depicted in the film) were true it seems that would have caused much unwanted attention.Jared Leto gives a layered performance as Rayon. Rayon becomes the moral core of the film. She is there to show Ron's evolution against his homophobic prejudice. He is almost unrecognizable but his muscular body looks extremely well for someone who is depicted as an emaciated dying AIDS-infected drug addicted.The characters of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) were fictional; the writers interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists and doctors for the film and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles.While Woodroof was known for outlandish behavior, according to those who knew him both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was. Actually McConaughey's disposition as the confrontational brash character is as he has often been in film roles.A major point is never made of Ron nor Rayon never expressing having any conscious regarding refusing to serve others who may not be able to afford the $400 Buyers Club fee.",3,Dallas Buyers morally-questionable Club,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2220,"['Dallas', 'Buyers', 'morally-questionable', 'ClubDallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'biographical', 'drama', 'film', 'starring', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'film', 'based', 'true-life', 'tale', 'Ron', 'Woodroof', 'AIDS-infected', 'person', 'who', 'began', 'smuggling', 'unapproved', 'pharmaceutical', 'drugs', 'Texas', 'when', 'found', 'effective', 'improving', 'symptoms.McConaughey', 'portrayal', 'realistic', 'morally-questionable', 'fighter', 'HIV', 'diagnosis', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'cause', 'Ron', 'become', 'pious', 'individual', 'could', 'make', 'money', 'importing', 'drugs', 'selling', 'other', 'HIV-positive', 'patients', 'able', 'get', 'over', 'border', 'masquerading', 'priest', 'swearing', 'drugs', 'are', 'personal', 'use', 'partners', 'business', 'Rayon', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'HIV-positive', 'transgender', 'woman', 'can', 'bring', 'many', 'more', 'clients.The', 'pair', 'establish', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'charging', '400', 'month', 'membership', 'extremely', 'popular', 'film', 'enlightening', 'depicting', 'were', 'many', 'AIDS-medication', 'buyers', 'clubs', 'country', 'long', 'lines', 'people', 'seeking', 'non-approved', 'drugs', 'depicted', 'film', 'were', 'true', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'much', 'unwanted', 'attention.Jared', 'Leto', 'layered', 'performance', 'Rayon', 'Rayon', 'moral', 'core', 'film', 'there', 'show', 'Ron', 'evolution', 'homophobic', 'prejudice', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'muscular', 'body', 'extremely', 'well', 'someone', 'who', 'depicted', 'emaciated', 'dying', 'AIDS-infected', 'drug', 'addicted.The', 'characters', 'Rayon', 'Dr.', 'Eve', 'Saks', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'were', 'fictional', 'writers', 'interviewed', 'transgender', 'AIDS', 'patients', 'activists', 'doctors', 'film', 'combined', 'stories', 'create', 'two', 'composite', 'supporting', 'roles.While', 'Woodroof', 'was', 'known', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'according', 'who', 'knew', 'film', 'McConaughey', 'made', 'rougher', 'actually', 'was', 'Actually', 'McConaughey', 'disposition', 'confrontational', 'brash', 'character', 'often', 'been', 'film', 'roles.A', 'major', 'point', 'never', 'made', 'Ron', 'Rayon', 'never', 'expressing', 'having', 'conscious', 'regarding', 'refusing', 'serve', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'afford', '400', 'Buyers', 'Club', 'fee']",N/A

McConaughey plays  Ron Woodruff a homophobic electrician/rodeo rider who will screw any woman with a pulse. After being shocked trying to save a co-worker's life, he ends up in the hospital where his blood work reveals that he is HIV positive and progressed to full blown AIDs with a virtually nonexistant T-cell count.He's in denial because he's never had sex with a male and doesn't believe that anyone other than gay men get AIDS. He quickly comes to accept his diagnosis when he learns that 17% of men can get the disease from being involved with IV drug users. When he discovers there is a trial for a new drug--AZT--he pushes his way into getting some despite the fact that he is rejected for the trial. Without physician supervision, he ends up taking a toxic dose of the drug and is hospitalized.With the help of a sympathetic doctor (Griffin Dunne) in Mexico and a gay transvestite (Jared Leto in a brilliant performance) he meets in the hospital, Ron starts a &#34;buyers&#34; club where he can get medication for himself and others that the FDA hasn't approved but that (according to evidence) helps those with the disease.END OF SPOILERS:Anchored by McConaughey's and Leto's superb performances, the film gets able support from Jennifer Garner as a sympathetic doctor. As good and convincing as McConaughey's performance is (and it is essential to believe in the story itself), Leto positively shines losing himself in his role as &#34;Rayon&#34;.The writing is exceptionally good as is the direction but, what truly sells the film, are the performances.The Blu-ray looks extremely good and, if it falls short of exceptional in areas like the amount of detail and depth, it has more to do with the choices of the director of photography and director than the short comings of the transfer itself.The audio, although it isn't exceptionally active, sounds quite good as well. &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34; is primarily a dialog driven film. The rodeo sequences exhibit the most depth and activity.The special features are underwhelming and this is where Universal has failed to provide additional value to the consumer. We get two deleted scenes and a promotional featurette that acts almost as extended trailer for the film. What would have been nice is a featurette or two on the real people that inspired the film, a historical documentary on the times providing some context for the film (and contrast as there are clearly good guys and bad guys in this film but the situation was a lot more complex and less black and white than portrayed) and a bit of background on AZT itself (as well as other medications used in the drug cocktail) might have been nice to have.I suspect that we will see a double dip here given the Oscar nominations. If the film wins, expect to see some sort of deluxe edition trotted out in a bout six months or so with featurettes. I would consider this verison the &#34;bare bones&#34; release version. I would normally recommend buying a film like this because it features such terrific performances but, given the lack of special features, I would hold off if you want to get some sort of deluxe version and not get stung. If all you are interested in is the film, by all means pick this up.Recommended.",4,"Exceptional movie, performances but the Blu-ray (and DVD) are lacking in special features (this is for the original release)",1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,3556,"['34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'drama', 'associated', '34', 'true', '34', 'story', 'movie', 'already', 'built', 'what', 'truly', 'norm', 'are', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'film.SPOILERS', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'done', 'exceptional', 'work', 'late', 'film', 'feather', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'McConaughey', 'Ron', 'Woodruff', 'homophobic', 'electrician/rodeo', 'rider', 'who', 'will', 'screw', 'woman', 'pulse', 'being', 'shocked', 'trying', 'save', 'co-worker', 'life', 'up', 'hospital', 'where', 'blood', 'work', 'reveals', 'HIV', 'positive', 'progressed', 'full', 'blown', 'AIDs', 'virtually', 'nonexistant', 'T-cell', 'count.He', 'denial', 'never', 'had', 'sex', 'male', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'other', 'gay', 'men', 'get', 'AIDS', 'quickly', 'accept', 'diagnosis', 'when', '17', '%', 'men', 'can', 'get', 'disease', 'being', 'involved', 'IV', 'drug', 'users', 'When', 'trial', 'new', 'drug', 'AZT', 'way', 'getting', 'fact', 'rejected', 'trial', 'physician', 'supervision', 'up', 'taking', 'toxic', 'dose', 'drug', 'hospitalized.With', 'help', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'Mexico', 'gay', 'transvestite', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'hospital', 'Ron', '34', 'buyers', '34', 'club', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'medication', 'others', 'FDA', ""n't"", 'approved', 'according', 'evidence', 'disease.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Anchored', 'McConaughey', 'Leto', 'superb', 'performances', 'film', 'able', 'support', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'good', 'convincing', 'McConaughey', 'performance', 'essential', 'believe', 'story', 'Leto', 'positively', 'losing', 'role', '34', 'Rayon', '34', '.The', 'writing', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'direction', 'what', 'truly', 'film', 'are', 'performances.The', 'Blu-ray', 'extremely', 'good', 'short', 'exceptional', 'areas', 'amount', 'detail', 'depth', 'more', 'do', 'choices', 'director', 'photography', 'director', 'short', 'comings', 'transfer', 'itself.The', 'audio', ""n't"", 'exceptionally', 'active', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'primarily', 'dialog', 'driven', 'film', 'rodeo', 'exhibit', 'most', 'depth', 'activity.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'underwhelming', 'where', 'Universal', 'failed', 'provide', 'additional', 'value', 'consumer', 'get', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'promotional', 'featurette', 'almost', 'extended', 'trailer', 'film', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'featurette', 'two', 'real', 'people', 'inspired', 'film', 'historical', 'documentary', 'times', 'providing', 'context', 'film', 'contrast', 'are', 'clearly', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'film', 'situation', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'complex', 'less', 'black', 'white', 'portrayed', 'bit', 'background', 'AZT', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'medications', 'used', 'drug', 'cocktail', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have.I', 'suspect', 'will', 'see', 'double', 'dip', 'here', 'given', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'wins', 'expect', 'see', 'sort', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'trotted', 'out', 'bout', 'six', 'months', 'so', 'featurettes', 'would', 'consider', 'verison', '34', 'bare', '34', 'release', 'version', 'would', 'normally', 'recommend', 'buying', 'film', 'such', 'terrific', 'performances', 'given', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'hold', 'off', 'want', 'get', 'sort', 'deluxe', 'version', 'not', 'get', 'stung', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'means', 'pick', 'up.Recommended']",N/A

Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey in an absolutely amazing performance) is a 35-year-old electrician and rodeo hanger-on who lives hard and parties harder, everything from smoking and drinking to drugs and careless sex.  When an injury on the job ends up sending him to the hospital, the doctors there do some tests and awkwardly inform him that he tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. They then inform him that he should start putting his affairs in order as they estimate that he only has maybe thirty days to live. Ron, a stereotypical homophobic redneck, angrily rejects the diagnosis, believing - as most people did back then - that AIDS was something only ""f[expletive for homosexual]s"" got, the mere implication being more offensive to him than the potential death-threat of the disease.Woodroof immerses himself in booze and drug binge denial at first.  But when thinking about something he read - about how some people get AIDS from intravenous drug use - he reflects on some past behavior and comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. Snapping himself out of his depression, he begins to read everything he can find on AIDS, particularly on treatment research.  At the time, the drug AZT was the only thing that seemed to show any promise at combatting the disease.  The problem though was that AZT was only in the clinical trials stage in the US, a process which was going to take a year before the drug could be approved by the FDA for doctors to prescribe to patients.  Facing a 30-day diagnosis, a year's wait was a death sentence for people like Woodroof.  Refusing to accept the situation, and faced with no way to legally buy the drug, Woodroof sets out to get it any way he can. Eventually he ends up going to Mexico to a clinic run by a Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), an American physician whose license was revoked for violating US regulations in his AIDS-related work. Dr. Vass puts Ron on a cocktail of other drugs, along with some vitamins, that he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms of AIDS, there being no known way of treating the HIV virus itself.Seeing an opportunity, Ron begins to buy up large stockpiles of the unapproved drugs and vitamins and smuggle them into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons to help pay for the costs of his own treatment. To broaden his reach, the still very homophobic Woodroof enters into an unlikely partnership with a transvestite named Rayon (Jared Leto in an equally bravura performace), a fellow HIV patient, who he met during a stay in the hospital, realizing that Rayon would have more contacts with AIDS patients in the gay community, which at the time was where the vast majority of them were. Eventually their questionably legal business grows into the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization that allows them to circumvent the law against selling the drugs by simply giving the drugs to members who have to pay a monthly fee for their memberships.A lot of what makes this movie worth seeing are the outstanding performances by Matthew McConaughey (Magic Mike, The Lincoln Lawyer) and Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, Lord of War), both of whom went to extraordinary lengths to make this film (McConaughey lost 50 pounds and Leto lost 30 pounds to achieve the gaunt look needed to portray the effects of AIDS over time). McConaughey is amazingly intense as he takes Woodroof first through the emotional gamut of dealing with the AIDS diagnosis, and then transforms himself as he shows Woodroof dealing with his situation with absolute determination to survive regardless of what it takes, rapidly adjusting his life and his views and calling on talents he never knew he had to become the person he needs to be -  and the person other people need him to be - to survive. Leto's Rayon is also a great character study, giving depth to his character by showing another side to Rayon's outer flamboyance, revealing things by his character's very unwillingness to reveal them.*** Warning - Possible spoiler in next paragraph ***But it is McConaughey who drives the film and who commands your attention.  One of the sequences that best shows the intensity McConaughey throws into his performance occurs as he shows Ron's life rapidly falling apart as news of his diagnosis spreads. His former friends turn on him, his co-workers refuse to let him on the job site, and finally he returns one night to his rented trailer only to find the door locked, an eviction notice taped to it, and the words ""F[expletive for homosexual] Blood!"" spray-painted across the side. To which McConaughey's Ron responds in sheer rage, yelling to the silent trailers around him ""I still live here, you hear me?! I fu[expletive]in' live here!!"" He is _so_ not going gentle into that good night.*** End of possible spoiler - You may read safely from here on. :)  ***The rest of the cast is also quite good.  Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno) is effective at bringing out the dilemmas of the time as Eve Saks, the doctor who gets to know both Woodroof and Rayon, caught between her desire to help and the restrictions put on her by the medical bureaucracy, particularly as she comes to doubt the approved approach both in terms of its effectiveness and its motivations. And Steve Zahn (Treme, Diary of a Wimpy Kid) provides a nice counter-balance as Ron's sympathetic brother Tucker, a Dallas cop caught between enforcing the law and the ties of family.What's also remarkable about Dallas Buyers Club is that it was made on a comparative shoestring budget - just $5M - most of which McConaughey had to raise himself. And yet it looks better than half of the big-budget films hitting theaters these days.  And partly because of this, there's a leanness to the feel of the film that fits the core story, where time matters and no moment can afford to be wasted.Highly, highly recommended, not only for McConaughey and Leto's outstanding performances but for its portrayal of people struggling against not only a procedure-bound medical bureaucracy but also against a system geared against them by the enormous influence of pharmaceutical companies",5,"Matthew McConaughey is outstanding as Ron Woodroof, a Texan with AIDS who refused to just roll over and die",1390176000,"01 20,

Leto and McConaughey BECOME different people for this film.  Just amazing to watch.The main issue with this film is that it is a depressing, slowly paced, struggle against enemies who always win because they have the government in their pockets.  It's the feel bad movie of the year.That said, it is very important that we highlight the struggles of the little guy versus the evils of Big Pharma and Big Government.  Movies like this demonstrate and reveal how cruel and greedy and outlandishly stupid the government is.This man's struggle is worth knowing about, but it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.

The two give quite possibly the best performances I've seen in a film all year in which I actually forgot I was watching actors in a film and instead felt as if I was watching real people. There's no doubt they will both receive nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.While this kind of story does feel a bit familiar overall, it's excellent screenplay and sense of realism along with the excellent performances make up for it. While it's defiantly not easy viewing and a bit of a downer to watch, it's a truly inspiring (and important) true story and one of the years best films.McConaughey has been made out to be a bit of a laughing stock after starring in a series of really mediocre films.
