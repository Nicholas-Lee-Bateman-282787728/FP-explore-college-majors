885429,A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G,B0007P0XBO,"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF""","[2, 4]","On one hand you could say that ""Ocean's Twelve"" isn't trying to be like it's very cool, very well done predecessor ""Ocean's Eleven,"" and just be its own film on its own terms while advancing the story of Danny, Rusty, Tess, Virgil, Turk, Yen, Frank, Basher, Linus, Saul, Reuben, Terry Benedict, and now bringing in a few others such as Isabel played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Francois Toulour played by Vincent Cassel.On the other hand, you could say that this is like a case of ""Kill Bill 1"" and ""Kill Bill 2"" where the idea is the same, the characters are the same, but you have two films that are quite different from one to the next.  Tarantino, however, more than succeeded in his Kill Bill vision because no one can deny the seamlessness from the first film to the second film.  Between ""Ocean's Eleven"" to ""Twelve"" however is a certain span of time where certain things transpire.  And while the film takes a good run at bringing us all up to speed, we can sense in the opening minutes that the group has kind of lost its initial magic.However, this is nitpicking in my opinion.  What I think happened here is that director Soderbergh wanted to make his own original ""Ocean's Eleven"" movie (remember the first was based off an old rat-pack flick starring Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis jr, and Peter Lawford).  The plot makes sense; Terry Benedict, the hammerhead shark who owns everything that Danny and his bunch robbed in the last flick, recovers from his losses and goes practically door-to-door to all the members of the eleven and demands his money back, with interest.  Of course, the fact that they pulled a fast one on him doesn't make him less intimidating, in fact he's scary as hell now.  They regroup and decide that America is totally red-flagged for them right now, so they move their entire operation to Europe to pull off one huge job to pay back everything Benedict wants.  The only problem is that Rusty's old girlfriend happens to be a detective now, and she's right on their trail.  Soderbergh does a great job of bringing us up to speed, and reigniting the spark between the members of Danny's elite group.When they pull the heist though, things don't exactly go as planned.  Someone called the ""Night Fox"" (if I remember correctly) has beaten them to the punch.  This is Europe's version of the ultimate cat-burglar, played by Vincent Cassel, who taunts Danny at first, and then decides to go head-to-head with him to see who is the ultimate thief.  The only thing greater than Toulour's chances of winning is Danny's unflinching confidence, and Soderbergh goes through the script with his man always at #1.His script, though, is a bit more worldly than his first, and incorporates a few scenes that would have no place in the first film.  Take for example the scene where Vincent Cassel, as Toulour, does a Capoeira dance in the patio of his mansion situated on a beautiful European landscape.  It's very intersting to watch, and Cassel does a wonderful job, but it's not ""Cool, baby"" like the first film.  I'd imagine a scene like this would have hit the cutting room floor in editing on the first film.  Also, what about the scene at the end where (spoiler coming) Rusty takes Isabel to see her long-lost father at the end, and we have this touching, quiet moment in a old Mediterranean setting, where the ocean waves (Ocean, get it?) lap gently against the beach.  Yeah fine, touching, but why?  It doesn't belong if you're trying to make a cool film.  Ah ha!  Maybe Soderbergh wanted to take this film franchise a step further, into what he thinks might be more sophisticated cinema, and incorporated scenes like this, that are a bit more dramatic?I'm going to have to disagree with you on that...  They may be dramatic and perhaps more ""arthouse"" to a certain extent, but I'm not convinced they belong in a film about a bunch of cats who pull off heists, steal expensive stuff, and get away clean, which in the history of cool may well be one of the coolest things to ever exist, besides rock n' roll.Granted, there are some great moments in this film, like how about when Linus (who has spent the greater portion of the film trying to prove he's ready to work on his own terms) discovers that the person who bailed he and his friends out of jail was his mother?  Classic.  Damon is actually quite crucial to the proceedings here.  He tries, he stumbles, he acts ambitious and confident, but seething below is an unprepared, very green young kid, who is still a bit bleary eyed at the big, bright world around him.  There's another scene in a cafe where Rusty, Danny and Matsui (Robby Coltrane) are speaking in ""code"" about a heist they plan to pull.  Of course the stuff is ludicrous, it's just a ruse to throw off Linus who tries like crazy to decipher what they're saying.  When it comes time for him to talk; he looks at Danny and Rusty hopefully, then turns to Matsui and recites lyrics from ""Stairway to Heaven.""By the way, Bruce Willis shows up, and can you believe nobody asks him when he is going to retire?  What a wasted opportunity.It leaves the franchise in a strange place.  The ending indicates that they all went back to Vegas, scot free this time, and have the time of their lives.  Maybe if there's an ""Ocean's Thirteen"" it'll be in Vegas, maybe this time with a bit less dram-uh, and a bit more of that sweet, swingin' stuff baby.",4,"This isn't your daddy's ""Ocean's Eleven""

In Twelve, unfortunately, most of the cast is absent for most of the film. Saying that, this film was great because these characters looked human and vulnerable. I mean they full off this spectacular heist in the first movie and in this movie they are trying to stay alive by making another amazing score, but, there is the ever present danger of Andy Garcia's character threatening to kill each of them.This film had very large shoes to fill. It's the same with every sequel that follows an amazing first movie. Some folks have been very harsh with their comments of this movie. I say the same thing every time I view a movie. You have to keep an open mind and try not to compare the sequels with the first movie. On its own  this movie has lots of charm, its filmed in Europe in three of the most exciting cities on the continent. Its kinda sad because they seem to bungle everything (have you seen anything so sad as those guys being arrested and hauled off to jail?) before it comes together.  Yes it has a lot of star power, but no not everyone is enamored with the faces of ""A"" list celebrities. Sometimes we are enamored with their acting ability. Oh, yes.

885432,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0007P0XBO,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","Okay, let&#8217;s do this one by the numbers. Not in numerical order because as I have noted in reviewing Ocean&#8217;s 13 and then the granddaddy Ocean&#8217;s 11 (modern version, no the 1960s Frank Sinatra and pals &#8220;classical&#8221;) in that order there is not such sequencing here. What I mean by the numbers here in this last of the trilogy to be reviewed is the number of heists that it takes this time in Ocean&#8217;s 12 to get square. See in 11 and 13 the crew just did one big caper and done, hitting the casinos in Vegas (we definitely can forget the Las Vega moniker since we are more than honorary citizens after three films) just for the sake of doing it or to help an old comrade out. Here there are several capers that did not seem to connect together and, frankly, there were too many moving parts to try to hold this immediate sequel together.Here is the problem. We know from 11 that Danny (played by George Clooney of course) and the boys took a big haul, over 150 million from three casinos in Vegas from one multi-billionaire owner Terry Bennett (played by Andy Garcia). But old Terry did not get where he was in the world by being beaten up six ways to Sunday by a bunch of &#8220;unconnected&#8221; independent street hoods. And thus Terry must seek revenge (not to mention that he lost his girlfriend, Danny&#8217;s ex , played by Julia Roberts, back into Danny&#8217;s arms) and so strong-arms the guys into paying every cent taken plus interest.Of course street guys naturally have already spent a good portion of the dough one way or another and so under a two week time limit set by Terry to get each and every dollar back (plus interest) the boyos must go back to work. And here is where the too many moving parts comes in. They are working Europe for any kind of dough they can get but the work is slow so what they are left with is a challenge/dare by a rich well-known master thief named the Night Fox. The prize, whoever can grab the extremely well-guarded Faberge egg (from Tsarist times in Russia), will in the case of the Night Fox be declared the max daddy king thief or for Danny and the boys the money to get out from under Terry&#8216;s death threats.

885436,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007P0XBO,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","The thing is, I should have known this was going to happen, and in a way I did.  I mean, I've been vocal about not getting into `Ocean's Eleven' and I just had this horrible feeling that this movie was going to be just as bad.  I never imagined that it would be worse, but `just as bad', yes.The whole concept behind the original film was taking a bunch of highly recognizable stars and throw them into a fast paced (albeit brainless) caper of a film where they got to be funny (sort of) and interact on a very personal level with one another, hopefully to engage the audience and make a lot of money.  The problem was that not one of the actors could live up to their own hype.  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts...all actors who are genuinely charming and interesting and engaging, yet together at this magnitude they were lukewarm at best.  The problem with `Ocean's Twelve' is that they repeat the same ineffective formula, adding only layers of confusion and stupidity to spice things up.I can't even really begin to explain to you what they are trying to pull off here, but I'll attempt it.  The gang is all back, except this time they are stealing money to save their lives since Terry Benedict (the guy they robbed in the first film) has found them all and tells them if they don't pay back what they stole with interest then they are dead men.  They flee to Amsterdam to try their hand and getting back the money but there is a thief called the Nightfox who is one step ahead of them the entire way.  Seems that he sit he one who tipped off Benedict as to their whereabouts because he felt threatened by Ocean's success and wanted to prove once and for all that he was the better thief.Add to the mix Rusty's (that's Pitt) former flame Isabel Lahiri, who has an agenda all her own, and you have a slightly confusing, rather bland and boring answer to the mess they handed us in 2001.I really wanted this to be so much better than it was.  I thought that maybe the spark they were missing in `Ocean's Eleven' would be found after these years went by and they might bring something fresh and exciting to the table, but this atrocity if far worse than the original.  Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Garcia, Zeta-Jones, Caan, Affleck, Cheadle (who fares better than anyone else) and especially Damon are all just boring.  There is no natural charm in these actors.Honestly, aside from one hilarious scene where Tess pretends to be Julia Roberts in order to complete a heist and is accosted by Bruce Willis, the film almost put me to sleep.  That one scene saved the film a bit.I have yet to attempt the third film (it's been sitting on my DVR for months now) but I will soon.  I'm not looking forward to it, but I would feel incomplete if I didn't at least give it a try.  I want to give this movie an F because I was so furious with its lack of real effort, but I'm going to settle for a D, maybe D-.  The film is dreadful in scenes, but Roberts elevates the whole film with three minutes of pure unadulterated charisma, and for that I am grateful.",2,Talk about sloppy seconds...,1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,3053,"['thing', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'way', 'did', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'been', 'vocal', 'not', 'getting', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'just', 'had', 'horrible', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'bad', 'never', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'worse', 'just', 'bad', 'yes.The', 'whole', 'concept', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'taking', 'bunch', 'highly', 'recognizable', 'stars', 'throw', 'fast', 'paced', 'brainless', 'caper', 'film', 'where', 'got', 'be', 'funny', 'sort', 'interact', 'very', 'personal', 'level', 'one', 'hopefully', 'engage', 'audience', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'problem', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'actors', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'hype', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'yet', 'together', 'magnitude', 'were', 'lukewarm', 'best', 'problem', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'repeat', 'same', 'ineffective', 'formula', 'adding', 'only', 'layers', 'confusion', 'stupidity', 'spice', 'things', 'up.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'begin', 'explain', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'here', ""'ll"", 'attempt', 'gang', 'back', 'time', 'are', 'stealing', 'money', 'save', 'lives', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'guy', 'robbed', 'first', 'film', 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'back', 'what', 'stole', 'interest', 'then', 'are', 'dead', 'men', 'flee', 'Amsterdam', 'try', 'hand', 'getting', 'back', 'money', 'thief', 'called', 'Nightfox', 'who', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'entire', 'way', 'sit', 'one', 'who', 'tipped', 'off', 'Benedict', 'whereabouts', 'felt', 'threatened', 'Ocean', 'success', 'wanted', 'prove', 'once', 'was', 'better', 'thief.Add', 'mix', 'Rusty', 'Pitt', 'former', 'flame', 'Isabel', 'Lahiri', 'who', 'agenda', 'own', 'have', 'slightly', 'confusing', 'rather', 'bland', 'boring', 'answer', 'mess', 'handed', '2001.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'thought', 'maybe', 'spark', 'were', 'missing', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'years', 'went', 'might', 'bring', 'something', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'table', 'atrocity', 'far', 'worse', 'original', 'Clooney', 'Pitt', 'Roberts', 'Garcia', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Caan', 'Affleck', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'especially', 'Damon', 'are', 'just', 'boring', 'natural', 'charm', 'actors.Honestly', 'aside', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'Tess', 'be', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'order', 'complete', 'heist', 'accosted', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'film', 'almost', 'put', 'sleep', 'one', 'scene', 'saved', 'film', 'bit.I', 'have', 'yet', 'attempt', 'third', 'film', 'been', 'sitting', 'DVR', 'months', 'now', 'will', 'soon', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'would', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'did', ""n't"", 'least', 'give', 'try', 'want', 'give', 'movie', 'F', 'was', 'so', 'furious', 'lack', 'real', 'effort', ""'m"", 'going', 'settle', 'D', 'maybe', 'D-', 'film', 'dreadful', 'scenes', 'Roberts', 'whole', 'film', 'three', 'minutes', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'charisma', 'am', 'grateful']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

The strength of Ocean's 11 was that it started at point A and it ended at point B, and it did so in a convincing and entertaining matter and threw in a believable plot twist at the end. It was very simply and straightforward.Ocean's 12 is nothing like this. The film is in desperate need of a better editor, as it is so bloated and ponderous that towards the middle of the film, if you've even managed to keep track of who's stealing what from whom and why they're doing it, you won't even care any more. You'll just be begging for the ending.  The film is filled with bizarre camera angles, such as a shot of an incoming airplane that for some inconceivable reason is filmed sideways. There are also some very bizarre scenes, such as a scene where Julia Robert's character has to pretend to be Julia Roberts, and a thief break-dances through lasers.However, the biggest flaw of the movie is the absence of a good heist scene. The heist in Ocean's 11 was masterful, and there is nothing in this film that even comes close.

The entire movie plays like their own personal vacation to Europe, and while they have a grand time spitting out witty dialogue and chewing the scenery the audience is left to ponder a hopelessly contrived story line that is frankly fairly boring.  At one point in the early going Clooney and Pitt's characters admit to one another that they are reaching; that is how the whole movie feels.

Now that I've watched in on DVD, surprisingly I quite like it and actually think it's as good as its prequel [in a different way though].I like the combination of light action, romance, comedy, and a bit of suspense here. The strongest point of the movie must be a medley of huge stars [Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Garcia, Zeta Jones,  Roberts]. Even supporting actors are all first-class! All of them play their parts really really well and even the supporting cast could hold their own against the big actors. It is amazing that you can feel a burst of energy and charms from these people in almost every scence. I actually felt like watching a celebrity party in a way, LOL.Another thing I like in the movie is the sizzling romance. They didn't even have to use cheap sex scenes to tell the story. The chemistry between Clooney and Roberts is okay and the Pitt-Jones pairing is just incredible.More good things: neat script with lots of funny quirky lines, good editing and delicious outfitting [but well we all know that Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Zeta Jones, and Roberts would look good even if they wore paperbags!]Okay, now the weak points: The plot is kinda weak and not very believable. The movie could be confusing at times. I had to watch it twice to pick up some of the details. Also, those who go in expecting series of action would surely be disappointed. There is not a single violent scene in the movie if I remember correctly. The suspense element is not too good either. What else, there is not a whole lot of high tech gadgets for this Ocean's 12. Maybe these are why some people don't like this sequel as much as Ocean's 11.So to sum it up, I think it's a fun movie if you watch it as a romantic comedy. The movie can't quite boast its action and suspense elements though.Recommendation: Rent it and you'll get good two hours of entertainment.

885446,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0007P0XBO,Benjamin,"[7, 12]","I really wanted to like OCEAN'S TWELVE. Really, really, really. It was going for that same great, hip vibe as its 2001 predecessor. It had the original cast, and it added in some new, gorgeous movie stars like Catherine Zeta-Jones and French star Vincent Cassel to look at. And, most importantly, it had director Steven Soderbergh at the helm once again.But, I hate to say it, the movie just doesn't work. The plot is overly complicated nonsense that relies too heavily upon title cards to tell us what day it is. Scenes seem contrived so that every cast member can be featured. George Clooney, the lead in the first film, is basically an afterthought here. Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Andy Garcia appear in glorified cameo roles, for I think even Elliott Gould gets more screen-time.The star who carries the majority of the narrative this time is Brad Pitt, and, boy, does he look fantastic. His clothes are great, and he's charming and is still reaping the benefits from that TROY fitness routine. I mean, since OCEAN'S TWELVE works best as an opportunity to ogle pretty movie stars, it satisfies that most often when Brad Pitt is onscreen.But it's not as funny as the first one.

885447,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0007P0XBO,Bill Garrison,"[0, 2]","Ocean's 12 is a slick sequel to Ocean's 11 with all of the stars returning including George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (the slickest of the 12).  The DVD includes exactly one feature, the theatrical trailer.  I assume a more loaded DVD will be released in the future.  I enjoyed Ocean's 11 so much because of the interaction of the characters and the complicated stealing of the money from the Bellagio.  Ocean's 12 includes all the characters and the great interaction, but the heists are more of an afterthought.Terry Benedict wants his money back from the first movie and evidently he is pretty convincing as a ruthless killer because all 11 guys decide they have to steal the money back.  They head to Europe where some thug supposedly has some jobs for them.  Once there, they intereact with new master criminals ""The Mark"" and the ""NightFox.""  The plot shifts to the background once again as the characters take over.  The amusing dialogue and slick cinematogrophy make this an enjoyable movie.The one negative of this movie is Julia Roberts.  I won't detail what happens exactly, but you'll get a clue when the Matt Damon character starts to mention that Tess (played by Julia Robers) looks exactly like someone famous.  When this point comes into play, the movie comes to a standstill and I was left waiting for this painful interlude to conclude.Ocean's 12 isn't as strong as the original, but I still had a great time watching all of these stars gather for one movie.

885450,A3AF8P0GINFADV,B0007P0XBO,Black Barbie,"[2, 4]","This film is top class entertainment, but not in the same style as Ocean's 11. The former was stylish and slick with George Clooney leading the pack, losing none of the sexiness he had in his ER days. However, this time around, Zeta Jones is at the forefront as she spars with Brad Pitt. Because of this, the dynamic has to change. It does work to a certain extent though but this feature doesn't seem to have the spark of the first one.Brad Pitt is just gorgeous and plays his part of Rusty Ryan well but I cannot help feeling he didn't get as good of a deal as Clooney did in the first one. The relationship between him and Zeta Jones feels forced in this story and Pitt deserves better than that.The jokes are funny and pack the right punches - undoubtedly an integral part of the film but I do think that the only problem is that some members of Ocean's 12 are left out such as Don Cheadle's character, Bernie Mac's and Scott Caan/Casey Affleck's characters, who in the first film were funnier than this one.Also, what about Andy Garcia. It feels as if he is on the periphery when he should be at the forefront? In order for the film to be really tight, all the characters should have had equal share of the action and the jokes and it just didn't happen in this film, Bernie Mac in prison for half of it? - what was that about?Zeta Jones is successful physically as the sexy detective but in spirit, she's too wooden. Clooney taking a back seat in this in film is sorely felt. It isn't Rusty Ryan's 12 or Lahiri's 12, it is his pack so it kind of feels out of place that he's just lurking in the shadows.However, the great factor of this film is Vincent Cassel. He is wicked as the smooth talking and sleek Francois Toulour and commands each scene that he is in, ESPECIALLY one awesome capoeira style scene. Just like he did in 'La Haine', he is cool and effective. Matt Damon is jokes in his part of the insecure Linus Caldwell, desperately trying to prove himself, also showing how versatile he is as an actor.Last Thought: At face value, great idea, not a terrible sequel but considering the amount of talent in this film, it could have been much better.",3,All Star Cast but...,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2162,"['film', 'top', 'class', 'entertainment', 'not', 'same', 'style', 'Ocean', '11', 'former', 'was', 'stylish', 'slick', 'George', 'Clooney', 'leading', 'pack', 'losing', 'none', 'sexiness', 'had', 'ER', 'days', 'However', 'time', 'around', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'forefront', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'dynamic', 'change', 'work', 'certain', 'extent', 'feature', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'spark', 'first', 'one.Brad', 'Pitt', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'part', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'deal', 'Clooney', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'relationship', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'feels', 'forced', 'story', 'Pitt', 'better', 'that.The', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'pack', 'right', 'punches', 'undoubtedly', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'do', 'think', 'only', 'problem', 'members', 'Ocean', '12', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'such', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Scott', 'Caan/Casey', 'Affleck', 'characters', 'who', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'funnier', 'one.Also', 'what', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'periphery', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'forefront', 'order', 'film', 'be', 'really', 'tight', 'characters', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'equal', 'share', 'action', 'jokes', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'film', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'prison', 'half', 'what', 'was', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'successful', 'physically', 'sexy', 'detective', 'spirit', 'too', 'wooden', 'Clooney', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'film', 'sorely', 'felt', ""n't"", 'Rusty', 'Ryan', '12', 'Lahiri', '12', 'pack', 'kind', 'feels', 'place', 'just', 'lurking', 'shadows.However', 'great', 'factor', 'film', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'wicked', 'smooth', 'talking', 'sleek', 'Francois', 'Toulour', 'scene', 'ESPECIALLY', 'one', 'awesome', 'capoeira', 'style', 'scene', 'Just', 'did', ""'La"", 'Haine', 'cool', 'effective', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'jokes', 'part', 'insecure', 'Linus', 'Caldwell', 'desperately', 'trying', 'prove', 'also', 'showing', 'how', 'versatile', 'actor.Last', 'Thought', 'face', 'value', 'great', 'idea', 'not', 'terrible', 'sequel', 'considering', 'amount', 'talent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

They plan a lot and talk alot but never really get around to doing anything. The movie is beautiful to look at, the people are lovely to look at, but the plot nevers goes anywhere. There are some funny scenes when the actors make fun of themselves in a very personal way and Topher Grace has a short, funny scene as himself.

And having seen it twice now, I can say that although I was not disappointed in the least, and while actually liking it, I can see how many people did not, and fully understand the many negative reviews on this site.The whole gang's back in action for the sequel, this time jaunting all over Europe in an attempt to recoup the money they stole from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the original. Benedict wants his money back or else, but the group is hampered by the activities of the mysterious ""Nightfox"", a masterthief who for some reason has it out for Danny Ocean and Co. There are also complications from Rusty's old girlfriend (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who happens to be a charter member of Interpol.The tone of the sequel is quite different from the first; it's looser and more art-house/foreign film in feel. Scenes are strung together with only casual attention to moving the actual plot. Sometimes it doesn't work, like a screechy scene involving Julia Roberts pretending to be herself, or in the nonexistent chemistry between Brad Pitt and Zeta-Jones (they don't even seem aware of each other's physical presence). But when it does, it's great, like a bit in a train station involving the loss of one of the 11 or another routine regarding Danny's real age.By far the best scene in the film comes courtesy of the Nightfox, played by the very French Vincent Cassel. Only a frenchman could make getting past security a joyous dance that's half Cirque du Soleil and half Gene Kelly. This scene alone is worth the price of rental.With this sequel George Clooney and Co. fall a bit into the trap that plagued the original Ocean's Crew: Having a lot of fun off-screen and expecting that to translate automatically on-screen. If you liked the original for the tightly written crime heist it was, than this film may not be for you (the DVD itself doesn't help with the almost total lack of good extras.). But if you liked the first movie for the star power and for the obvious good time the cast was having, then you might enjoy Ocean's 12.

Such is the premise that Ocean's Twelve, the sequel to Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven remake of the Rat pack classic 1960s caper film, must have been pitched at studio executives with. Simply put, never has a film about less, with less characterization and more smug mugging for the camera ever worked better. There were a plethora of such films in the 1960s, both American and European, and even Japanese, but none with the star power this film has. Style, on very rare occasions, can trump substance, and this film is that exceptional one that proves that substance usually is king.Ok, what of the plot? In the first film Danny Ocean (George Clooney)and his crew stole $160 million from the casino of a big time casino owning mobster named Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). This film opens three years later, with all eleven thrives hunted down and given a deadline with which to pay back the money with interest, or die. Of course, there are plot holes galore. The whole set up is untenable, and the fact that such smooth operators would so easily expose themselves is ridiculous. Still, there are some really funny scenes of Bernie Mac in a massage, Rusty (Matt Damon) as a lap dog, and assorted other funny scenes. Only Ocean manages to escape such a threat- but not for long, as he re-teams with the others to make things right....What I find amazing is how many reviewers panned this film. It reminded me of the roasting the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla got; as if a film about a big lizard stomping on New York would or should have been Oscar caliber? This is why I started off talking about pretense, and its ability to salvage potentially bad films. In this case, it works, and so does the film.

However, it still manages to be quite a bit of fun, especially when it dips into the Hollywood palette for inspiration.Ocean's Twelve's thin plot require Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia, his talent wasted in this non-role) to want his money back bad enough (even though insurance covered his losses) to threaten the original ""Ocean's 11"" (a title the press uses and everyone but Danny is tired of hearing) into pulling off another job -- since they've already spent most of the money. This leads to a competition with The Night Fox (French star Vincent Cassell) when he reaches their target, the home of a recluse (a cameo by Jeroen Krabbe) before they do.Meanwhile, Rusty's (Brad Pitt) ex-girlfriend, Isabel Lahiri (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who manages to somehow look younger in each of her successive pictures) is on the hunt for the group and for the elusive ""most successful thief of all time"" -- who has some secrets of his own. This time Tess gets into the act for an unnecessary diversion involving her impersonation of a famous celebrity to whom she holds an uncanny resemblance, and another celebrity's confusion at this. It is a lot of fun, but adds nothing to the plot, merely padding the already extensive running time.Unfortunately, without this and another shorter diversion, there would be little to recommend (Topher Grace, as himself, has the film's best line) since only Matt Damon's character Linus shows any signs of growth. Others, like Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner, seem only to be around to make an appearance and round out the dozen (Mac spends most the film in jail, and Reiner is vacillating about whether to get involved).Working on the same budget as Ocean's Eleven, director Steven Soderbergh manages to make Ocean's Twelve feel like a smaller film, despite taking place over an entire city, instead of just one building. All in all, it's a pleasant way to kill two hours, but I don't think anyone is going to be clamoring for Ocean's Thirteen.",3,"Fun, but little substance",1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2150,"['Made', 'original', 'screenplay', 'was', 'modified', 'fit', 'characters', 'success', 'predecessor', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'definite', 'signs', 'wearing', 'out', 'welcome', 'However', 'still', 'be', 'quite', 'bit', 'fun', 'especially', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'palette', 'inspiration.Ocean', 'Twelve', 'thin', 'plot', 'require', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'talent', 'wasted', 'non-role', 'want', 'money', 'back', 'bad', 'enough', 'even', 'insurance', 'covered', 'losses', 'threaten', 'original', 'Ocean', '11', 'title', 'press', 'everyone', 'Danny', 'tired', 'hearing', 'pulling', 'off', 'job', ""'ve"", 'already', 'spent', 'most', 'money', 'competition', 'Night', 'Fox', 'French', 'star', 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'when', 'target', 'home', 'recluse', 'cameo', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'do.Meanwhile', 'Rusty', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Isabel', 'Lahiri', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'somehow', 'look', 'younger', 'successive', 'pictures', 'hunt', 'group', 'elusive', 'most', 'successful', 'thief', 'time', 'who', 'secrets', 'own', 'time', 'Tess', 'act', 'unnecessary', 'diversion', 'involving', 'impersonation', 'famous', 'celebrity', 'whom', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'celebrity', 'confusion', 'lot', 'fun', 'nothing', 'plot', 'merely', 'padding', 'already', 'extensive', 'running', 'time.Unfortunately', 'shorter', 'diversion', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'recommend', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'film', 'best', 'line', 'only', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'Linus', 'signs', 'growth', 'Others', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'seem', 'only', 'be', 'make', 'appearance', 'round', 'dozen', 'Mac', 'most', 'film', 'jail', 'Reiner', 'vacillating', 'get', 'involved', '.Working', 'same', 'budget', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'make', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'feel', 'smaller', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'entire', 'city', 'instead', 'just', 'one', 'building', 'pleasant', 'way', 'kill', 'two', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'going', 'be', 'clamoring', 'Ocean', 'Thirteen']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

That the cast was populated with some of Hollywood's finest - Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, and the best actor in Hollywood at the moment, Brad Pitt - made the film worthwhile.  The amount of money that it made pretty much guaranteed a sequel.  I thought to myself, ""It probably won't be as good, but if the same cast comes back, it'll have to be fun!""I was dead wrong.  The entire cast looks like they just mailed in their performances (with the exception of Damon, who has some truly inspired lines and situations - berating his partners for using disparaging language, being rescued by his mother, telling Ocean he's ready for ""a more central role,"" etc.).  Not only that, but the lackadaisical effort extends to the editors, the director, the scriptwriters, etc.  As far as sequels go, this one was pointless to start with because everything that could be done was done in the first film.  But the action within this movie itself is also pointless!  For example, instead of lowering himself 2 feet over a wall to make a shot with a harpoon, the conspirators instead choose to raise an entire house (one with 3 high-tech security systems) 2 feet so the shot can be made from an adjoining roof.  Surely one of those secturity systems would notice the entire house being raised, and if not, the people living in it surely would!In a good movie, I wouldn't question such absurdity (and Roger Ebert seems to think the absurdity is the point).  But this is not a good movie, and everything in it is so needlessly complex you can't stand it because the payoff isn't worth the effort.  I was reminded of the Gene Siskel test: a good film is one that is more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch.  This movie isn't even more interesting than a documentary of the empty restaurant where the actors will have their lunch later that day.To add insult to injury, the DVD is bad.  The sound (at least on my system) is terrible - the music track is at a level about twice as loud as the dialogue track.  Were the producers trying to hide the inanity of the film?

Since there are so many in the cast, it is a real feat to make them all memorable, give them a reasonable amount of screen time and make sure that everyone has some good lines.The trick in this kind of movie is to keep it similar enough to the first movie to keep the audience of the first one signing on to the new film, but different enough to not bore them.  Ocean's 12 has enough twists and turns to make it fun and enough self-knowledge to add some spice.  For example, a delicious part of the movie is using the similarity in appearance between Tess Ocean (played by Julia Roberts) and Julia Roberts to some effect in the film, even though her ears and nose and accent make it obvious she is NOT Julia Roberts.This is not a great film, not even a great caper film.  But it is stylish, quick moving, doesn't resort to raunch, and gives its big cast some individual moments to act.

Ocean's Eleven managed to straddle this line quite well, resulting in an entertaining popcorn movie. Director Steven Soderbergh kept his cast in check, never letting them go too far over-the-top and shooting it with a style that was always interesting to watch. The big question for the sequel is if he could pull of the same feat without repeating himself too much.If the first film was about Danny's redemption by reconciling with Tess, then Ocean's Twelve is about Rusty's (Pitt) redemption by reconciling with his past love, Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones), a determined Interpol agent. It elevates the movie ever so slightly above the standard heist story by giving everything that happens a somewhat poignant spin.Once again Soderbergh keeps the pace brisk and breezy, making the two-hour running time fly by. Like its predecessor, Ocean's Twelve is beautifully shot with atmospheric lighting, an eclectically groovy soundtrack from British DJ David Holmes (that evokes a `60s Euro-lounge vibe) and tight editing that makes it stylistically consistent with the first movie. Soderbergh is an excellent visual storyteller and this is evident in several scenes that he depicts without any dialogue, instead resorting to music married to visuals that conveys exactly what's going on. He understands the kind of movie he's making and doesn't try to be too cute or wink knowingly at the audience, instead focusing at the task at hand: making a confident, entertaining movie. Granted, Ocean's Twelve is no Traffic (2000) but you could do a lot worse with two hours of your time.",4,Not as bad as it could have been,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,1762,"['big', 'budget', 'star-studded', 'casts', 'one', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'always', 'danger', 'having', 'look', 'too', 'smug', 'self-indulgent', 'instead', 'having', 'fun', 'audience', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'managed', 'straddle', 'line', 'quite', 'well', 'resulting', 'entertaining', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'kept', 'cast', 'check', 'never', 'letting', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'over-the-top', 'shooting', 'style', 'was', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'big', 'question', 'sequel', 'could', 'pull', 'same', 'feat', 'repeating', 'too', 'much.If', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'Danny', 'redemption', 'reconciling', 'Tess', 'then', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'Rusty', 'Pitt', 'redemption', 'reconciling', 'past', 'love', 'Isabel', 'Lahiri', 'Zeta-Jones', 'determined', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'movie', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'standard', 'heist', 'story', 'giving', 'everything', 'somewhat', 'poignant', 'spin.Once', 'again', 'Soderbergh', 'pace', 'brisk', 'breezy', 'making', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'fly', 'predecessor', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'atmospheric', 'lighting', 'eclectically', 'groovy', 'soundtrack', 'British', 'DJ', 'David', 'Holmes', '60s', 'Euro-lounge', 'vibe', 'tight', 'editing', 'stylistically', 'consistent', 'first', 'movie', 'Soderbergh', 'excellent', 'visual', 'storyteller', 'evident', 'several', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'resorting', 'music', 'married', 'visuals', 'conveys', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'kind', 'movie', 'making', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'too', 'cute', 'wink', 'knowingly', 'audience', 'instead', 'focusing', 'task', 'hand', 'making', 'confident', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Granted', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'Traffic', '2000', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'two', 'hours', 'time']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

885478,A2GYX971VETQBV,B0007P0XBO,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[0, 1]","Well, I guess I shall have to add my name to the unhappy guest book of those who expected so much from this film only to be sadly disappointed.  But I would like to add that it is more than just a matter of spoiled expectations.  Had OCEAN'S TWELVE been released in a world without its explosive prequel, it would have suffered from the same attacks that are being levied against it.  I was worried from the opening ten minutes of the film when Terry Benedict goes on his ""rounds"" tracking down each member of the original crew.  These ten minutes felt like a newborn colt trying to find its balance.  Moreover, tracking down all of the members was excessive and we could have been spared the tedium.After a while, the film finds its pace and settles into a standard, ""enjoyable"" caper film.  One thing pointed out by others that I have to second is the lack of screen time for all of our main characters.  Part of the fun of OCEAN'S ELEVEN was the fact that the job required eleven experts to pull it off.  Of course, it is hard to recreate these conditions in a sequel, but this film seems to require only a couple of crooks while the rest are along for the ride.  We hardly get to see any of our beloved characters, with the exception of Matt Damon (whose character is extremely fun to watch).  The question is: Why bring all of these stars along if you're not going to use them?  Secondly, why add more?  When Catherine Zeta-Jones came on the scene, everything went up in smoke.  Not only is her character a cheap copy of Rene Russo and Esther Canadas in the remake of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (the smart & sassy investigator combined with a great criminal's daughter), she is boring to watch in comparison to the other actors in the film who get far less screen time.  Moreover, I will not give it away, but bringing in Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis to play the parts that they do seems simply a contrived way to get more stars on the screen and disrupts the flow of the story.Of course, OCEAN'S TWELVE is not without its good moments.  In particular, the flashback sequence when the audience finally learns how the squad pulls off the first robbery is dynamite and Matt Damon brings a real sense of humor to every scene that he is in.  I'd say that, overall, it is an average caper film right up until its closing minutes.  The final ""twist"" is not a twist at all, but rather a ""deus ex machina "" in order to have a nice and snazzy ending where our heroes end up on top.  The only problem: much of the footage we see in the closing sequence is absolutely new and does not merely expand what has gone before, it completely rewrites it.  One knows that they wanted to have a great ending to this film, but this ending is simply too crazy to pull off.  And that's saying a lot for an action film that has already required me to give up my grip on reality.  I would recommend OCEAN'S TWELVE as an average, Hollywood action film with plenty of unused star power.

885483,A105YVLAZNYQUU,B0007P0XBO,Dentallica,"[8, 14]",The first movie worked because it highlighted how the thieves planned and executed the amazing heist. This one fails because 95% of the movie has nothing to do with showing us a theft. It's like they figured 'we showed a theft last time - so let's focus on the story this time'. That's all well and good except for this movie - the heist IS the story. So in other words they forgot to show us the very movie we went to see. So instead of seeing how these guys work - we get to see lots of junk. Not for a second does the audience believe the Oceans crew is in danger because the story has no substance to it. On the plus side Catherine Zeta Jones is ridiculously hot - so that's great to see. On the down side - Julia Roberts looks terrible (as per usual) but this time she plays the character Tess who plays the actress Julia Roberts!!!??? This whole scene with Bruce Willis is awful and ridiculous. I cant believe they filmed it - let alone wrote it. I half expected the scene to turn into a blooper reel and the director apologizing for trying out this bad idea. Anyway - overall this movie was boring and garbage. I expected to see a heist film that showcased how professional thieves work their trade. Instead I saw a movie that had nothing going for it other than beautiful talent.

The thieves that formed Danny Ocean's (played by George Clooney) team have gone their seperate ways and used their money in different fashions.  Then, Dirk Benedict, played by Andy Garcia, manages to track them down and gives them two weeks to pay him back what they stole, plus interest.  Problem is, Danny and the boys are too hot to work in the United States, so they are forced to go to Europe in an attempt to steal the money they owe Benedict.That sounds like a great idea for a sequel.  It gets better, there is a rival thief that is jealous of Ocean's notoriety.  Therefore, he complicates the plans of Ocean and his gang and sets up a little contest between himself and Ocean.  This sounds like an even better movie.However, it wasn't.In 'Ocean's Eleven,' the audience was in on most of the plan to rob three casinos.  Other crime movies had set the audience up to expect that things would go wrong, and that things were going wrong, yet somehow Ocean and his crew would overcome the obstacles.  In the end, you come to realize you were duped, and the caper is pulled off beautifully with charm, grace, and humor.It doesn't work a second time around.  The whole cast is back, and again, the audience is on the plans.  This time, things really start to fall apart, or so they seem.  It is also not nearly as much fun the second time around.  The little site gags, like Rusty (played by Brad Pitt) eating his way through the movie in Ocean's Eleven, are gone.  Most of the dialogue is flat.  The middle part of the movie is just not enjoyable.So, why do I give it three stars?  The movie does have its moments.  Its fun to see what the various members of the crew are up to with their portion of the loot from the first movie.  It is fun to see them plan another caper.  It is fun to see Linus, played by Matt Damon, attempt to grow in his role as a master thief with assistance from Rusty.  The ending sequence is also what you'd expect from a sequel to 'Ocean's Eleven.'What made 'Ocean's Eleven' so great was the tricks it pulled and the all-star cast.  The entire cast is back, including Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac, but many of them are misused.  Bernie Mac's character, Frank Catton, has some funny quirks that get him caught in the movie, but he largely disappears for most of the movie.  The same tricks can't be pulled on a suspecting audience this time.I'd recommend this movie to die-hard fans of the original, but lower your expectations to stave off disappointment.  It is probably best rented first, and save a purchase if you really enjoy it.Overall grade:  3.25 stars.",3,The Truly Unnecessary Sequel,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,2661,"[""'Ocean"", 'Twelve', 'attempts', 'pick', 'up', 'where', ""'Ocean"", 'Eleven', 'left', 'off', 'thieves', 'formed', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'team', 'have', 'gone', 'seperate', 'ways', 'used', 'money', 'different', 'fashions', 'Then', 'Dirk', 'Benedict', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'track', 'down', 'two', 'weeks', 'pay', 'back', 'what', 'stole', 'interest', 'Problem', 'Danny', 'boys', 'are', 'too', 'hot', 'work', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'forced', 'go', 'Europe', 'attempt', 'steal', 'money', 'owe', 'great', 'idea', 'sequel', 'better', 'rival', 'thief', 'jealous', 'Ocean', 'notoriety', 'Therefore', 'plans', 'Ocean', 'gang', 'up', 'little', 'contest', 'Ocean', 'even', 'better', 'movie.However', ""wasn't.In"", 'Eleven', 'audience', 'was', 'most', 'plan', 'rob', 'three', 'casinos', 'Other', 'crime', 'movies', 'had', 'set', 'audience', 'up', 'expect', 'things', 'would', 'go', 'wrong', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'wrong', 'yet', 'somehow', 'Ocean', 'crew', 'would', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'end', 'come', 'realize', 'were', 'duped', 'caper', 'pulled', 'off', 'beautifully', 'charm', 'grace', 'humor.It', ""n't"", 'work', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'whole', 'cast', 'back', 'again', 'audience', 'plans', 'time', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'so', 'seem', 'also', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'little', 'site', 'gags', 'Rusty', 'played', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'eating', 'way', 'movie', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'are', 'gone', 'Most', 'dialogue', 'flat', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'enjoyable.So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'fun', 'see', 'what', 'various', 'members', 'crew', 'are', 'up', 'portion', 'loot', 'first', 'movie', 'fun', 'see', 'plan', 'caper', 'fun', 'see', 'Linus', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'attempt', 'grow', 'role', 'master', 'thief', 'assistance', 'Rusty', 'ending', 'sequence', 'also', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'sequel', ""'Ocean"", 'Eleven', ""'What"", 'made', 'Eleven', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'tricks', 'pulled', 'all-star', 'cast', 'entire', 'cast', 'back', 'including', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'many', 'are', 'misused', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'character', 'Frank', 'Catton', 'funny', 'quirks', 'get', 'caught', 'movie', 'largely', 'most', 'movie', 'same', 'tricks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'pulled', 'suspecting', 'audience', 'time.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'lower', 'expectations', 'stave', 'off', 'disappointment', 'probably', 'best', 'rented', 'first', 'save', 'purchase', 'really', 'enjoy', 'it.Overall', 'grade', '3.25', 'stars']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

885492,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0007P0XBO,Emily Todd,"[2, 3]","I am a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh's 2001 ""Ocean's Eleven"".  It was funny, fast-paced, slick, and a pure joy to watch some of the world's biggest movie stars joke around with each other.  What amazing chemistry George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, etc. had together!  I came into ""Ocean's Twelve"" with high expectations.  It seemed impossible to me that the sequel could be any less wonderful.  As I left the theater, dispirited, I complained to my family, ""How could Soderbergh mess things up so bad?""  All he had to do was provide us with a reasonable script and his stars would do the rest.  Unfortunately, the script was very weak and therefore, the movie simply collapsed.The film's key structural problem is evident at the outset. After a promising opening, during which Garcia locates George Clooney and Julia Roberts, we then have to watch him confront Brad Pitt. Then Matt Damon ... then Carl Reiner ... then Bernie Mac ... then Elliott Gould ... then Don Cheadle ... and so on and so forth until the entire first reel is finished. At this point you may come to the same startling realization that I did; the movie still hasn't started.In this overplotted, overpopulated, and overscripted mess of a heist film, I soon found myself inexplicably frustrated with it.  The entertaining banter between the eleven thieves that made the first film so enjoyable is now stale and painfully unoriginal as are the individual identities of each thief.  In ""Ocean's Eleven"", each character was indispensable and played a crucial role in the big heist as opposed to ""Ocean's Twelve"", where all of the characters stand about joking around with each other; and not much else.The reason for this, I discovered after doing a bit of reading upon returning from the theater, is that the script was originally written by George Nolfi and intended to be a completely different, unrelated film.  Soderbergh simply took the script and tweaked it until he could fit in all of his characters.  THERE is the problem.  The script was not originally developed for this cast of characters or their personalities and therefore never flows properly.  Soderbergh merely altered some low-quality, preexisting material, packed in his stars like sardines and called it a film.I'm sure many will leave the theater as puzzled as I was as to why they disliked ""Ocean's Twelve"" so greatly.  Well, it's simply because scripts are not interchangeable and cannot be shuffled about from one film to the next.  Soderbergh made this film in order to earn a quick buck and didn't even have enough investment in the film's quality as to take the time to write an actual script!",2,"""Twelve is the new eleven.""",1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2670,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', '2001', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'was', 'funny', 'fast-paced', 'slick', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'world', 'biggest', 'movie', 'stars', 'joke', 'other', 'What', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'etc', 'had', 'together', 'came', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'high', 'expectations', 'seemed', 'impossible', 'sequel', 'could', 'be', 'less', 'wonderful', 'left', 'theater', 'dispirited', 'complained', 'family', 'How', 'could', 'Soderbergh', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'provide', 'reasonable', 'script', 'stars', 'would', 'do', 'rest', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'therefore', 'movie', 'simply', 'collapsed.The', 'film', 'key', 'structural', 'problem', 'evident', 'outset', 'promising', 'opening', 'Garcia', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'then', 'have', 'watch', 'confront', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Then', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'then', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'then', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'then', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'then', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'entire', 'first', 'reel', 'finished', 'point', 'may', 'come', 'same', 'startling', 'realization', 'did', 'movie', 'still', ""n't"", 'started.In', 'overplotted', 'overpopulated', 'overscripted', 'mess', 'heist', 'film', 'soon', 'found', 'inexplicably', 'frustrated', 'entertaining', 'banter', 'eleven', 'thieves', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'now', 'stale', 'painfully', 'unoriginal', 'are', 'individual', 'identities', 'thief', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'character', 'was', 'indispensable', 'played', 'crucial', 'role', 'big', 'heist', 'opposed', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'where', 'characters', 'stand', 'joking', 'around', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'else.The', 'reason', 'discovered', 'doing', 'bit', 'reading', 'returning', 'theater', 'script', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'George', 'Nolfi', 'intended', 'be', 'completely', 'different', 'unrelated', 'film', 'Soderbergh', 'simply', 'took', 'script', 'tweaked', 'could', 'fit', 'characters', 'problem', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'originally', 'developed', 'cast', 'characters', 'personalities', 'therefore', 'never', 'properly', 'Soderbergh', 'merely', 'altered', 'low-quality', 'preexisting', 'material', 'packed', 'stars', 'sardines', 'called', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'will', 'leave', 'theater', 'as', 'puzzled', 'was', 'why', 'disliked', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'so', 'greatly', 'Well', 'simply', 'scripts', 'are', 'not', 'interchangeable', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'shuffled', 'one', 'film', 'next', 'Soderbergh', 'made', 'film', 'order', 'earn', 'quick', 'buck', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'enough', 'investment', 'film', 'quality', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'actual', 'script']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

Lots of bad things going on that suck - storywise, but tons of cool things that don't - cool-wise. Literally, every scene that the whhole gang is in together is a great scene. They have so much good chemistry, it's unreal. But you have to acknowledge the plot points and fiascoes. Like, if these guys could prosper in Amsterdam, why didn't they just stay there and live off their money? Instead, they get scared because the guy from the last film wants his money back, has found them in America, and has people in place to kill every one of them. So they scramble to get the money they once stole and spent so that they can get it back to him in one piece. I could trash this thing with all kinds of plot holes, but I'd rather not because I like it.I need you guys to know that there is a very excellent sountrack to this movie. If not entirely, it is at least to the music played during the French thief's dance. Without a doubt, this is the coolest part of the movie. One of the coolest things I've ever seen in a film. And the actor did his own dance stunts.Ocean's Eleven have made a terrible mistake. They never expected retaliation. That is a lousy idea for a movie, in my opinion.The stealth aspect is really lousy and that's why we always wanted to see this film. To make sure that it was better than the last. Their latest idea of who the twelve will be is a mix of ideas between Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts. Bad film with a great cast put together by a lousy script and a worse director. Often, the handheld camera shakes and takes the weirdest angles. This thing could have been incredible if they'd kept the Brad Pitt stuff, realized who they wanted as the lead ( Pitt or Clooney) and made sure that the important stuff was in the forefront.When I say ""average wonder"" we are talking about people who could be there or not. There are perfectly good reasons to not keep them and even less reasons to keep them. This movie had one reason, and everyone involved was thinking too broadly, but not too intelligently.But, it is very funny in that it makes fun of the things it deems cool. When one informant-type tells Catherine Zeta Jones that Brad Pitt dresses like a gigolo, you immediately know why he said it and you question your own appreciation of his clothes when minutes ago you know you loved his style. Really, Brad Pitt is so ridiculously cool in this thing that you want to be him for a few minutes.Matt Damon's is easily the best role in the film. He seems to have reinvented his character for the better. He really is great. And no matter how cool the French guy is, what he does later is impossible according to what the Ocean's thief says about the layout. Plot hole.The thing about this film is that no one cares about being plausible. They wanted to make a movie with lots of cool guys doing cool things and they succeeded. That's the only reason I don't give it two stars. They did what they wanted to do. All the way down to a great idea thrown in about Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis.

It featured a classy and glamorous cast of popular Hollywood icons including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon and the lovely Julia Roberts. Directed by the talented Steven Soderbergh(Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich), it became a worldwide hit crime caper movie recognized for its sharp dialogue and flairing style. Three years later, in 2004, nearly the entire wonderful cast of the first installment return along with exuberant director Steven Soderbergh, who this time travel all through Europe in search of riches. Professional thief Danny Ocean(Clooney), and his filthy-rich team of brilliant experts, which includes Rusty Ryan played by a cool Brad Pitt, and Tess Ocean, Danny's wife who would rather stay in the shadows about the con business, here played by the gorgeous megastar Julia Roberts. This time,though, they' re not stealing for their own sake, as the slick thieves have been threatened by casino master Terry Benedict, who gives them a limited amount of time to recooperate the money they originally stole from him in the first film or he promises to take care of the team in a grisly and unpleasing manner. The stakes are set higher this time around, as the gang travels through Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris looking for a way to steal millions of dollars so they can live, and also encounter a rival and increasingly jealous sly con artist(Vincent Cassel) who is making their alreday skillful jobs a little more difficult. The backdrops and scenery are lush, fresh, and vibrant bringing life to an already colorful film. The performances are magnificent, thanks to undeniable star power that blends flavorful character opera with rich and detailed situations their characters are placed in, and there are some intriguing cameos to spice things up. There are some brisk although tense chase and action scenes to keep the pace lively. Overall a worthy sequel to a savvy and thrilling predecessor. An entertaining and juicy heist dramedy that features Catherine Zeta-Jones who is absolutely fabulous in her role as a cunning and beautiful international detective hot on the criminal mastermind's trail. Steven Soderbergh has a keen eye for kinetic direction, with eye-catching shots of European city streets, pitch-perfect editing, and an outrageously interesting screenplay that will keep you experiencing loads of fun. All these elements are combined to create a glorious caper movie that will satisfy artistic moviegoers, and has sheer quality and entertainment value that is utterly enjoyable. The only bonus feature on the DVD version will be the film's original theatrical trailer that sparked anticipation for a movie that deserved attention. The DVD edition will be available in seperate Fullscreen and Anamorpic Widescreen formats.

However, the first film was clever, intriguing and fresh! Ocean's Twelve isn't.  It wants to be by giving us just the reverse in its set-up.Yes, we've got the whole gang back again. However, this time out, there seems to be no real reason for each and every person. The writers have not created a piece specifically for this crew of 11 plus one. (The screenplay, in fact, is cobbled together from a unique screenplay never intended to be used for Ocean's 12, but rather a movie all on its own with far fewer players).Instead of each person having a unique job to perform, the writers decide to drop all the dead wood into a jail cell for the majority of the time. This provides the remaining actors (sic - the major box office stars: Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Damon, and Zeta Jones) far more ""face"" time on the screen.What we get is a love interest for Pitt with Zeta Jones (which is really the reason to see this film - because it clicks and Zeta Jones is dynamite in her scenes). We get a very very convoluted premise for the dynamic of the film...and we get an ending that wants to roll everything up nice and neat, although it has little believability.The ""French Connection"" in this film is a well known and admired French actor who delivers very well on his star potential. However, to propose that this character, physically lithe as he may be, could ""dance"" his way through multiple random laser beams...well, it's just downright laughable. Then there's the whole ""Mommy comes and save me..."" bit.  I won't elaborate on these fronts because I don't want to give away the movie.It's not a bad film - it's just not really good as a film of intrigue goes. NOW, that said...it's tons of fun watching these actors have fun with each other and poking fun at each other.

Its a big banner film and features some of the biggest names in Hollywood.My point : So What? THere's absolutely no story in this movie.The ones of you frowning while reading this please note that its nothing but a plot to prove how clever some film makers can be. All in all it falls flat on its face.The ever so gorgerous,Catherine Zeta Jones in this film looks like she doesnt even belong to it. The time she's playing Miss Clever Detective made me sink in my seat in the theater.Brad Pitt , sadly in this movie is all about expressions, running around beautiful cities and getting arrested. He eats a few chocolates and snacks here and there. Tries to do his jiggs, wears an awesome suit that fits him like second skin. He hits on girls and tries to play Mr.Cute. He's still tolerable.Moving on , Geroge Clooney's got older and his cute boy image just wont work as far as this film goes. He bores with his silence cause he has nothing better to do in the film. I expected a lot from this film. Its one of those ""Oh look everyone's going for it. It has to be a good film"" Sadly this bored me.I liked the short Asian guy not because he's shorter than me but he wasnt as drowing in pretence as the other characters in this movie were.Julia Roberts and her acting in this film was anything but consequential. She should have sat out the entire film than introduce us to her new boring self.I absolutely can't stand how fake she is the scene on the swing with Clooney towards the end of the film.Matt Damon is a saving face. He seems like someone who managed to pull this from a One Starrer to a Two Starrer. Sadly there's not much of the neat guy. I thought the one scene where he quotes the lyrics of the mesmering ""Kashmir"" was actually quite funny. I noticed how the film maker tries to create the impression that a lot is happening throughout the length of the film. It amuses me how accurate it is in its monotony.In any case , opinions come and opinions go. I might try to sound like I'm saving my @$$ when Im saying this but a lot of fools and wanna be's all over the cities liked the film. So did the intellects and the outstanding unachieving achievers. Even my girl friend who saw this along with me,liked it.So would you render my opinion as useless? Gimme a Break!

Well should the urge ever overcome you, Oceans's Twelve is the only film that refuses to just wrap up the 'plot' for good. There are about a zillion climaxes that are all anti-climatic. Steven Soderbergh couldn't even get one of them right?Andy Garcia comes back and demands that Ocean's 11 give him back the money they stole, plus extra. So they go off to Europe to steal things by not stealing them and not really planning anything at all. The whole film is made up of narcissistic filler. Ooooohh it's all so sophisticated and cool isn't it? Puh-lease.This movie shouldn't have been made. Ocean's Eleven may have worked well but Twelve was taken from a non-related script called 'Honor Among Thieves' and adapted into a sequel, that no one asked for. So how do you go about cramming in 12 main characters into a story that did not have 12 main characters? You can't.As a result Ocean's 12 never interact all at once. Several characters are left with nothing to do, forgotten about, stand about like idiots, fight for even a couple of lines of dialogue (all sarcastic, self-aware, nausiatingly 'cool' dialogue btw), disappear, reappear, wonder what the hell they're doing, forget who they are etc...It's just plain horrible and too convoluted and contrived for its own good. The whole film seems out of order and you are frequently left wondering what on earth is going on. This elitist, condescending attitude makes us feel like the movie was made for the cast instead of us.Plus Julia Roberts looks dreadful in this. She's very pale and thin and gaunt-looking. I thought I was looking at Skeletor to begin with. And if you don't believe how sickeningly 'clever' the film thinks it is, a certain plot development has Julia Roberts play Tess Ocean playing Julia Roberts (oh stop, that's too ingenious for my feeble, average movie-goer mind). Somehow Catherine Zeta Jones comes off a prettier, if not a better actress (I do NOT like Catherine Zeta Jones-but she was an exception here when compared to the Plain Jane Julia Roberts) as her accent is still all over the place.The only good bit about the film is Vincent Cassell in a small supporting role as a master thief (like everyone else in the film). Funny how his one character is more interesting than a dozen others combined. Plus, we actually get to see him do stuff other than stand around. Which helps.Don't waste your time with this film.

It is there to lure you into not seeing nor looking for details and logical connections. And it works. The main action is in the editing of the film. Very short sequences jumping from one place to another across the world and from one time to another back and fro, even in fake black and white. You are so busy trying to follow the line, to recognize the characters and place them where they are supposed to be that you don't see that nothing happens and what does happen is not shown nor explained. Ah the beautiful coronation egg : what happened to it ? Where was it stolen ? By whom ? The only thing we are about sure is that the egg in Rome was a fake and everyone was fooled, except maybe the gang itself who was, we learn that later, playing the game of the real thief who seemed to have been setting up all that hullabaloo just to recuperate his daughter. Sentimental ending and a big check for the real thief who was burglarised, covered by his insurance and yet wanted his money back with interests.

Not only did these entertainers have much in common, they were also wonderful actors.  They teamed for the original ""Ocean's 11"" motion picture in 1960.  Actually filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada at many of the popular casinos in town (sadly, many of the older landmarks are now gone).Ocean's 11(1960) is now considered a classic and thanks to the continued broadcasting of the film by the cable network, American Movie Classics.  It's a film you can watch over and over again.They also reteamed in Sergeants 13 (Robin and the Seven Hoods1962). They also did concerts togethers.Sammy Davis Jr. died in 1990, Dean Martin died on Christmas 1995 and Frank Sinatra passed in 1998.In 2000, George Clooney decided he would make a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" for 2001.  He got together a slew of young popular actors, middle age and senior actors and rolled the dice onOcean's Eleven [Blu-ray] (2001). It became a curious hit because some people liked it, but it was quite different than the original 1960 version and it did not have the suspense, mystic or twist ending of the original.Well, George Clooney agreed to make a sequel, ""Ocean's Tweleve.  The entire main cast is back and some of the smaller roles too.  This time they go to Amsterdam.  Too much chatter and use of hand-held cameras.  After 50 minutes, I just did not care about this film.  Where is the juicy heist?  The only character that held my interest was ""Yen"" played again by Shaobo Qin.

By this I don't mean those movies that are essential components to trilogies that continue the story; I mean those movies that basically take an established cast and throw them in a completely new storyline. The problem is trying to meet the expectations of an audience that loved the first and wants a new movie to love for all the same reasons. So many people were disappointed to learn that ""Ocean's Twelve"" was not yet another heist movie.This film had to be a sequel. The plot takes advantage of the relationships the characters developed in the first film, and throws in many subtle jokes the average viewer may miss if they don't listen closely. Some of the phrases like ""thief a la mode"" used in the film may require a bit of culture to appreciate. While Ocean's teams do work together in the same fashion as the first film, the thievery itself doesn't take the spotlight in the film. ""Ocean's Eleven"" was the traditional heist film in its plot development with its climax at the point of executing the plan. Ocean's Twelve breaks away from this formula in favor of developing opportunities for some great character interaction.The film disappoints with many characters taking a back seat in their roles to such an extent that the film could have been named after Pitt's character, with the Benedict aftermath merely serving as a catalyst for the characters finding their way back together. However, it would have been unreasonable for all eleven original characters to share an equal share of the spotlight and still turn out as well. The story is more about Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones than George Clooney and Julia Roberts. The rest of the cast perform very well and the guest-star appearances, including an unforgettable one by Bruce Willis, are hysterical. Half of the time I was unsure if the actors were even acting!! It appeared as if they were not even looking at the script, and instead talking amongst themselves like, ""Hey, so how you've been?"". ""Oh, I `v been good, the kids at home are taking up a lot of my time, ya know"". Come on now, really.In the end, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is not a mere heist film but an Intelligent Comedy that may need to be watched more than once to appreciate some of the subtleties in the dialog. Just the amount of activity on this film's message board regarding some of the subtleties in the plot is a testament to the thought that went into making this film.

It's overly stylish with way too much camera movement. If you thought Bourne Supremcy had too much camera movement then you saw nothing until you see this. The plot makes no sense also. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) brings Ocean's 11 back together because he wants them to pay him back the money they stole. Someone here wrote that it would've saved a lot trouble if they just killed him. They're not killers though..they're thieves. Anyway the movie jumps all over place so much that it's impossible to keep up with it.I only recommend it because the cast is so good. They're so good that it's a shame that the script isn't better. Matt Damon and Brad Pitt shine the most. Surprisngly this is more of Pitt and Cathrin Zita Jones' film than it is George Clooney's. Hell Matt Damon even has more to do than him. The film spends too much time with Jones' cop character who's on the trail of them. I think it even spends more time showing her trying to catch them than it does explaining what it is they actually plan on doing. Plus why is it even called Ocean's 12 ? There is still only 11 of them. I guess it is called that due to the addition of Jones' to the cast but she's trying to catch them through most the movie. She's not part of their team.The scene that probably is the most entertaining is the one where Tess (Julia Roberts) poses as....Julia Roberts. I don't know how doing that is supposed to help get George Clooney and the others out of jail though. It's just meant to be funny I guess and it is. Most of the scenes in the movie you don't know what they are doing or why. The first one was much more involving. It's  disapointing how Steven Soderbergh approuched making this sequel.

885524,A12W99SK787ZJ9,B0007P0XBO,"J. J. Chiappelli ""jjcx""","[10, 15]","Watching ""Ocean's Twelve"" is sort of like hearing that there's a big party going on where all the popular people are going to be, getting an invitation even though you're the most uncool kid in school, and then being stranded on the doorstep as it begins to rain.  You can see that a lot of beautiful, famous people are having a whole lot of fun, but somehow, you get the feeling that you're not supposed to be a part of it.There's a whole lot of starpower in this movie.  Massive powders kegs of it.  Stars left and right.  As if the first movie didn't have enough, this one throws Albert Finney, John Travolta, and Catherine Zeta-Jones into the mix just to entice you even more.And I love most of the actors/actresses in this movie.  And with the exception of Julia Roberts, the cast does a pretty good job.  Those who reprise their roles from the first film show that they haven't gotten ""out of shape"" and those who are newcomers fit their roles nicely.But the script and the story both leave a lot to be desired.  The dialogue thinks it's a lot cooler than it really is---there's not much wit or snap or sass in this movie.  It's a straightforward, lame action-movie script that feels very boring to hear.  The director tries to compensate for this with stylistic cuts and camera angles, or by having the actors speak with flair.  Flair they've got, but the material they're delivering still sounds dead and passionless no matter how great their acting is.The story is no better.  There's no focus---you have this sublot with Linus trying to get promoted to Shift Leader and then there's a subplot about Danny and Tess and then there's this whole romantic plot between Rusty and Lahiri.  All of that would be fine if the movie could take one storyline at a time and develop it more strongly.  Instead, the movie rapidly cuts between them so that you never get a chance to get hooked into it.  None of the subplots seem all that interesting and so you end up with a case of quantity over quality (a flaw of many big-budget pictures).And when you realize what the main plot-line is, it's actually pretty dull and has none of the sparkle or charm of the first movie.  In the first movie, there was a gang of likeable underdog thieves who are going to steal a bunch of money from an unlikeable casino owner.  In this movie, there's a bunch of idiots who have to steal the Faberge egg because they're in a thievery competition with a petty Super Thief.  That's just dumb.  Surely, somebody could've found a more interesting and more believable reason for the Ocean's Eleven gang to come together again and pull another heist.

The script for ""Twelve"" was written as a separate film, but it was adapted for the ""Eleven"" characters to make it ""Eleven""'s sequel.The heists aren't as clever or fun, and there are bigger and looser story element loose ends.  For example, Ocean's crew didn't want to try to steal a mask (or whatever it was) because the museum's random-movement laser beam security made even attempting it futile.  But the competing thief had no qualms about it.  His goofy-looking yoga exercises we saw here and there paid off in his choreographed movement through the laser beams.  But it was a cheat.  It didn't look like he was in any kind of danger - it looked too smooth (not unlike in ""Attack of the Clones"" when Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are shooting at the evil robot army.  They were filmed on a green-screen stage shooting at nothing, and the baddies were added months later.  So, you don't see any degree of tension on their faces or sense of palpable danger -- the baddies were positioned in front of their laser fire, so it just looked like Portman and Christensen were playing a video game).Same in ""Twelve"" -- the limber thief just looked like he was casually moving through.  Too casually.  And then there would have been the problem with him doing it again, carrying the mask, to get out.It was too conveniently resolved in the film.  No tension.But this movie was meant to be a light-hearted romp, not a serious caper film, right?  It looked mostly like a travelogue film for Amsterdam.At least the in-jokes were reasonably funny.This movie only gets 3 stars, and I don't care what the DVD has on it.

""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of these films that should not have a sequel made, at least not one as bad as ""Ocean's Twelve"".  ""Ocean's Eleven"" did what so many other remakes have tried and failed to do, which is top the original, however just because a film is good and does well at the box office does not mean a sequel should be thrown together to cash in.  This is exactly how ""Ocean's Twelve"" feels to me, it comes off as if director Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney were talking and said, ""Hey wouldn't it be cool to get the entire gang back from the original and do another one?"".  But instead of taking the time to either write a proper story to follow up the original or at least have one written that does the original justice, we get this heaping pile of crap that is ""Ocean's Twelve"".""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up quite some time after ""Ocean's Eleven"".  Danny Ocean and his wife, Tess (George Clooney and Julia Roberts respectively), and the rest of the eleven are enjoying their retirement from criminal life and reaping the rewards from their last heist (seen in the original film).  However, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) has not forgotten what Danny Ocean and his crew stole from him and someone has supplied him with all the information he needs to find Ocean's Eleven and make them pay with interest.  This leads Danny to reunite his crew to attempt several jobs to try to repay the debt before they all wind up dead, but now there is competition from rival thieves, not to mention one of Danny's crew is dating a law enforcement agent.""Ocean's Twelve"" I'm sure sounded good to the executives and I know they saw dollar signs at the prospect of getting the entire original cast back plus the addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but the un-original plotline, and boring script caused this movie and this possible franchise to come to a halt in my opinion.  Studios need to learn that just because you have a stellar cast, and a talented director does not always equal an excellent movie.

The first movie had such a great atmosphere and mood, and that mood was ""cool"". While this okay sequel still is ""cool"", it may too ""cool"". The movie becomes too much of one big antic. Things get too crazy and too over the top by the end. While the twists are good and slick, they are not very comprehensible. The plot of this sequel revolves around the same ol' gang who has been tracked down by Benedict. He wants his dinero back con interest. So, Danny and the boys go back to work, except they find out they've been set up by the master theif known as the Night Fox, who apparently wants to prove he's better than the group by beating them to every heist. If you've seen the first movie then you probably know how the formula works in the end. What I did like about the movie itself was that it did keep that ""cool"" mood and great chemistry between the characters. It was fun, no doubt about it. Some hilarious moments, but at times they get too wacky. Also, I loved the way the movie was shot, the cinematography really added to the whole experience. But, I have one complaint. Some shots are done with a steadicam, the others are camcorder style very much the same way Soderburg shot Traffic. Both ways are fine, but why mix them? Having those two different techniques mixed in didn't go well with me. Anyway, you'll enjoy the cameos, and the one hilarious but over the top scene where they basically make fun of Julia's pregnancy because it was during this shoot that she found out she was pregnant. The movie is good, but not as good as its predecesor.ACTING: The cast had the best times of their lives making this movie. I wish everyone could have a job where they get paid large amounts of money and get to fool around and have fun while making a quirky comedy. The movie has all the same cast members back, but for some reason and I don't know why, I didn't feel the same connection between the characters this time around. I found that I had more fun watching them in the first film than this one, and it's hard for me to explain it. If you see the movie you might feel the same way.BOTTOM LINE: Big fun, great time, but too crazy.

885543,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007P0XBO,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 1]","The first thing that strikes the audience in Ocean's Twelve is the star studded cast.  Besides the obvious actors such as Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julie Roberts the film has great depth of supporting actors with minor parts.  Several of these small parts have actors that already have established themselves with major parts in other prestigious films.  For example, Johan Wideberg, a Swedish actor known from Oscar nominated All Things Fair (1995), Eddie Izzard and Robbie Coltrane all appear at some point in the film.  Next to these actors, the audience will of course also recognize Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, Casey Affleck, and Vincent Cassel among many others.  Despite this enormous talent pool Ocean's Twelve does not succeed in creating a sublime cinematic experience, which will awestruck the audience.  Instead, the viewers get to experience a half-empty drama with good chemistry while the actors carry out an overtly planned design.The story begins within Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his group ripped of in the predecessor, Ocean's Eleven.  Benedict demands that Ocean and his cohorts return all the money that was stolen from him with interest.  Initially, this idea for the sequel provides an interesting angle, but the interest quickly eradicates itself by trying to do too much on the screen without detail or feeling for the atmosphere.  In a hurried number of sequences the audience gets to follow Benedict's quick visits to all of Ocean's buddies, as he presents the idea that he will kill them unless they return the money.Unfortunately, the film continues with lack of appealing intrigue, as no complex scheme will get them out of the mess with Benedict.  As an alternative, the film takes the audience to Europe where Ocean and his partners intend to find a way to steal the money that Benedict wants in less than two weeks.  Amusingly, the story brings them to plan the theft of a very valuable document from an eccentric loner who never leaves his highly secure mansion.  However, the document will not give them more than a couple of million, which is just a drop in the bucket of what they need.  This is a little absurd, as Ocean and his associates are aware of the feeble sum while they go on with an elaborated and most likely very time and monetary consuming plan to get the document.  Nonetheless, this is necessary, as it will lead the story to its next phase.Fortunately, Ocean and his friends succeed in the break in, but someone has beaten them to it, as the thief before them was aware of them trying to steal the document.  However, this provides a connection for Ocean to who ratted on them to Benedict.  One name appears, the Night Fox, and now Ocean and his buddies are on the warpath to find this Night Fox.  Simultaneously, as they try to find the Night Fox, the Europol has placed them under surveillance. This is due to their recent breaking and entering into the loner's house.Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) leads the unit that keeps the surveillance of Ocean and his friends' movement. To make things a lot more complicated, she used to be Rusty Ryan's (Brad Pitt) old girlfriend.  This seems to be both a problem and an advantage, as she has inside knowledge of how Rusty operates, but he knows how she thinks. In due time Isabel follows the group of skilled thieves to Rome, Italy.  In Rome, the audience gets to see the beginning of the big showdown, which brings some entertaining and amusing moments.Steven Soderbergh directs a visual journey that moves rapidly from one scene to another in a manner, which feels constructed.  Nonetheless, the cinematography is brilliant where the audience gets to experience first-class visuals, which truly enhance the story.  The chemistry between the characters seems very authentic, maybe even a little too authentic at times, as it really feels as if they are good buddies.  The downside of the story is also the friendship, as it produces a feeling as if these guys are having a good time in Europe while shooting this film.  The audience never experiences any kind of anxiety or fear of death, as they know that they only have another two weeks to live if they do not raise the money, which seems very important to them.",3,Visually Stunning & Star Studded...,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,4349,"['first', 'thing', 'audience', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'obvious', 'actors', 'such', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'film', 'great', 'depth', 'supporting', 'actors', 'minor', 'parts', 'Several', 'small', 'parts', 'have', 'actors', 'already', 'have', 'established', 'major', 'parts', 'other', 'prestigious', 'films', 'example', 'Johan', 'Wideberg', 'Swedish', 'actor', 'known', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Things', 'Fair', '1995', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'appear', 'point', 'film', 'Next', 'actors', 'audience', 'will', 'course', 'also', 'recognize', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'many', 'others', 'enormous', 'talent', 'pool', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'not', 'succeed', 'creating', 'sublime', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'awestruck', 'audience', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'get', 'experience', 'half-empty', 'drama', 'good', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'carry', 'out', 'overtly', 'planned', 'design.The', 'story', 'begins', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'who', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'George', 'Clooney', 'group', 'ripped', 'predecessor', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Benedict', 'Ocean', 'cohorts', 'return', 'money', 'was', 'stolen', 'interest', 'Initially', 'idea', 'sequel', 'interesting', 'angle', 'interest', 'quickly', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'detail', 'feeling', 'atmosphere', 'hurried', 'number', 'sequences', 'audience', 'follow', 'Benedict', 'quick', 'visits', 'Ocean', 'buddies', 'idea', 'will', 'kill', 'return', 'money.Unfortunately', 'film', 'lack', 'appealing', 'intrigue', 'complex', 'scheme', 'will', 'get', 'mess', 'Benedict', 'alternative', 'film', 'audience', 'Europe', 'where', 'Ocean', 'partners', 'intend', 'find', 'way', 'steal', 'money', 'Benedict', 'less', 'two', 'weeks', 'Amusingly', 'story', 'plan', 'theft', 'very', 'valuable', 'document', 'eccentric', 'loner', 'who', 'never', 'highly', 'secure', 'mansion', 'However', 'document', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'more', 'couple', 'million', 'just', 'drop', 'bucket', 'what', 'need', 'little', 'absurd', 'Ocean', 'associates', 'are', 'aware', 'feeble', 'sum', 'go', 'elaborated', 'most', 'likely', 'very', 'time', 'monetary', 'consuming', 'plan', 'get', 'document', 'Nonetheless', 'necessary', 'will', 'lead', 'story', 'next', 'phase.Fortunately', 'Ocean', 'friends', 'succeed', 'break', 'someone', 'beaten', 'thief', 'was', 'aware', 'trying', 'steal', 'document', 'However', 'connection', 'Ocean', 'who', 'ratted', 'Benedict', 'One', 'name', 'Night', 'Fox', 'now', 'Ocean', 'buddies', 'are', 'warpath', 'find', 'Night', 'Fox', 'Simultaneously', 'try', 'find', 'Night', 'Fox', 'Europol', 'placed', 'surveillance', 'due', 'recent', 'breaking', 'entering', 'loner', 'house.Isabel', 'Lahiri', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'unit', 'surveillance', 'Ocean', 'friends', 'movement', 'make', 'things', 'lot', 'more', 'complicated', 'used', 'be', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'problem', 'advantage', 'inside', 'knowledge', 'how', 'Rusty', 'how', 'due', 'time', 'Isabel', 'group', 'skilled', 'thieves', 'Rome', 'Italy', 'Rome', 'audience', 'see', 'beginning', 'big', 'showdown', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'moments.Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'visual', 'journey', 'rapidly', 'one', 'scene', 'manner', 'constructed', 'Nonetheless', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'where', 'audience', 'experience', 'first-class', 'visuals', 'truly', 'enhance', 'story', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'very', 'authentic', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'authentic', 'times', 'really', 'are', 'good', 'buddies', 'downside', 'story', 'also', 'friendship', 'feeling', 'guys', 'are', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'Europe', 'shooting', 'film', 'audience', 'never', 'kind', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'death', 'know', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'weeks', 'live', 'do', 'not', 'raise', 'money', 'very', 'important']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)
885544,A293GSESZUQWX4,B0007P0XBO,"Kimberly M Wilson ""precisioner""","[6, 8]","""Ocean's Eleven"" was a caper of the grandest kind: compelling mission with high stakes, satisfying execution and enough twists to keep you engaged and rooting for them to win.  It even had a love story to boot.  It was everything you wanted in a big Hollywood movie, with class and style in spades.  It also had a cliff-hanging ending that seemed to have a lot of promise.  So needless to say, I had high hopes (with caution) for the sequel.I was disappointed. (WARNING:Major spoilers ahead)THE GOOD:First, the movie wasn't a complete wash.  The wit remained.  There was loads of entertaining one-liners and cheeky banter.  Brad Pitt's acting was wonderful, and I think his character seemed to be the only one that remembered what they were the first time around: cool crooks.  Even Clooney lost some of his edge, with the whole ""Do I look 50"" banter.  But I digress.  OK, the good.  Lots of beautiful people.  Nice locations.  Matt Damon delivered his role well.  I dunno.  Nice cinematography.THE BAD:Terrible pacing.  Twenty minutes in I still had no clue what I was watching.  To add insult to injury, Benedict was about as menacing as a grandmother yelling ""Get me my switch.""  This is the super-duper bad guy? Someone who thinks poking someone with a cane is supposed to make him ditch his HONEYMOON?!  And it got worse from there.  So many false starts for no apparent reason.  Sitting in the cafe with that guy who was totally incomprehensible did not add one shred of anything to the plot, characterization or enjoyment of the film.  And I could rattle off about 5 other pointless or too long scenes that were more suited to skits on a (bad) episode of SNL that in a movie with a forward moving plot. I've read complaints that this movie was just a vanity project to get ""the boys"" back together, and scenes like this seem to confirm that. Also, how predictable was it that the master thief was CZJ's father.  YAAAAWWWNNN! I saw that like an hour before they showed it, and, worse the reveal was cheesy and maudlin.THE UGLY:Everyone got arrested?!?!?!?! Huh?  What happened to our intelligent, always-one-step-ahead-of-the cops, master crooks?  Even if the arrests were staged, where's the fun in seeing everyone in jail?  Also, in the first film, the twins bickered and were dim, but were ultimately buddies. I LOVED them.  But in 12, their characterization totally changed,  and their petty, infantile bickering turned into snarky hatred - considerably less charming.  And the Julia Roberts thing was indefensible.  It totally broke the suspension of belief and again, contributed nothing.  The actors seemed to enjoy it, though.  I'm happy for them.  But, honestly I could have forgiven (almost) everything if the payoff of the heist would have been worth it.  That is why it is with infinite sadness that I must report (I cannot emphasize this point enough) the heist SUCKED!  To watch an entire movie with a disastrous, convoluted and banal heist plan (although that hologram thing was cool) only to find out that they had actually robbed some guy on a train (in a pickpocket job that Casey Affleck's character probably could have pulled by himself) days earlier made me want to sue for two hours of my life back.I really hope the Ocean's 13 redeems this tragic film.",2,At the risk of sounding redundant...disappointing,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,3281,"['Ocean', 'Eleven', 'was', 'caper', 'grandest', 'kind', 'compelling', 'mission', 'high', 'stakes', 'satisfying', 'execution', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'engaged', 'rooting', 'win', 'even', 'had', 'love', 'story', 'boot', 'was', 'everything', 'wanted', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'class', 'style', 'spades', 'also', 'had', 'cliff-hanging', 'ending', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'promise', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'caution', 'sequel.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'WARNING', 'Major', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'First', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'complete', 'wash', 'wit', 'remained', 'was', 'loads', 'entertaining', 'one-liners', 'cheeky', 'banter', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'think', 'character', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'remembered', 'what', 'were', 'first', 'time', 'cool', 'crooks', 'Even', 'Clooney', 'lost', 'edge', 'whole', 'Do', 'look', '50', 'banter', 'digress', 'OK', 'good', 'Lots', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Nice', 'locations', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'delivered', 'role', 'well', 'dunno', 'Nice', 'cinematography.THE', 'BAD', 'Terrible', 'pacing', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'still', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'watching', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Benedict', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'menacing', 'grandmother', 'yelling', 'Get', 'switch', 'super-duper', 'bad', 'guy', 'Someone', 'who', 'poking', 'someone', 'cane', 'supposed', 'make', 'ditch', 'HONEYMOON', 'got', 'worse', 'there', 'So', 'many', 'false', 'starts', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Sitting', 'cafe', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'totally', 'incomprehensible', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'one', 'shred', 'anything', 'plot', 'characterization', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'could', 'rattle', 'off', '5', 'other', 'pointless', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'suited', 'skits', 'bad', 'episode', 'SNL', 'movie', 'forward', 'moving', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'read', 'complaints', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'vanity', 'project', 'get', 'boys', 'back', 'together', 'scenes', 'seem', 'confirm', 'Also', 'how', 'predictable', 'was', 'master', 'thief', 'was', 'CZJ', 'father', 'YAAAAWWWNNN', 'saw', 'hour', 'showed', 'worse', 'reveal', 'was', 'cheesy', 'maudlin.THE', 'UGLY', 'Everyone', 'got', 'arrested', 'Huh', 'What', 'happened', 'intelligent', 'always-one-step-ahead-of-the', 'cops', 'master', 'crooks', 'Even', 'arrests', 'were', 'staged', 'where', 'fun', 'seeing', 'everyone', 'jail', 'Also', 'first', 'film', 'twins', 'bickered', 'were', 'dim', 'were', 'ultimately', 'buddies', 'LOVED', '12', 'characterization', 'totally', 'changed', 'petty', 'infantile', 'bickering', 'turned', 'snarky', 'hatred', 'considerably', 'less', 'charming', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'thing', 'was', 'indefensible', 'totally', 'broke', 'suspension', 'belief', 'again', 'contributed', 'nothing', 'actors', 'seemed', 'enjoy', ""'m"", 'happy', 'honestly', 'could', 'have', 'forgiven', 'almost', 'everything', 'payoff', 'heist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'why', 'infinite', 'sadness', 'must', 'report', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'point', 'enough', 'heist', 'SUCKED', 'watch', 'entire', 'movie', 'disastrous', 'convoluted', 'banal', 'heist', 'plan', 'hologram', 'thing', 'was', 'cool', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'had', 'actually', 'robbed', 'guy', 'train', 'pickpocket', 'job', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'character', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'days', 'earlier', 'made', 'want', 'sue', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'back.I', 'really', 'hope', 'Ocean', '13', 'tragic', 'film']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

An exercise in star power, yes, but put this many high profile stars in a movie with this many characters, plot twists and settings, the ability to exercise any acting talent is very limited. This film just jumps around from one scene to the next like a headless chicken. In its attempt to create a complex but stylish heist film, it somewhere loses a sense of purpose or reason. Within the first 10 minutes of the film we are taken to at least 8 or 9 different cities in the United States. Then later we are taken to Amsterdam, Rome, and France, and maybe some other places I have now forgot. And in dealing with this many characters and all the back and forths this film does to you,  after a while it starts to feel like your driving in a car with no shocks on an extremely bumpy road. And again, with this many characters involved in the story, it gives not one actor leverage enough to develop his or her character and display some real acting ability.

885547,A1UH9J9NXAUMM6,B0007P0XBO,Kristen Drewski,"[5, 11]","Out of four stars I give it one and a half or maybe two. The acting was decent and I like the interaction between Brad Pitt and George Clooney. The problems with the film overshadow the film though. The plot is horrible, most of the returning cast is given nothing to do and the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones is zilch. I was excited to see this film but the original was better as is with most films. The direction also seemed to be lacking as Steven Soderbergh favored lots of hand held shots. Personally I think that this type of film needs to have a certain look to it. It has to be sharp and stylish, it can't look like anyone could of filmed it. They also had these fuzze freeze frame type shots that were unecessay and detracted from the film. They created these type of breaks from the film and detracted because suddenyl you were reminded you were watching a film. The other problem was the backstory between Catherine and Brad. We had the beginning where we learn how they know each other and that was all that was needed. We did not need to see how they met, it simply made the movie longer and detracted away from the main plot, which sucked. If they wanted to make the film longer they should have given more screen time to Don Cheadle, Eliiot Gould, Carl Reiner, or any of the other cast members. I didn't like Catherine Zeta-Jones's character at all really. I thought the idea of her character was unecassary. They could of made a better film if they would've come up with a better script that gave Rusty Ryan a better backstory. The one they came up with was half assed. Anyway, if you have a low IQ or have no idea what seperates a good movie from a bad one you will think this movie was great and that it was one of the best films you've seen this year. If you liked the film and thought it gave you something to do for two hours you in my boat. I thought it was entertaining and it was better than staring at my computer. I'll probably end up buying it though simply because I love the interaction between Brad and George and the french dude is hot.

Keep that in mind when you watch ""Ocean's Twelve"" because it is playing off of that joke that this Steven Soderbergh's sequel has its best moments.  There have been films whose greatest crime was substituting style for substance, but in this 2004 film it is star power that makes up for the last of substance.  If came back to gawk at the stars then you will enjoy this movie a lot more than if you are back to watch the gang pull off another complicated heist.  They have to do that this time because Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) has tracked down all eleven of the gang members and told them he wants his money back (with interest).  So Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) are putting the gang together and looking for a big job they can pull off before their deadline.If there is one lesson we learned from watching ""Ocean's Eleven"" it was to assume that EVERYTHING that happens is part of the master plan.  Of course, the goal in the first film was to fake the viewer out as much as Terry Benedict.  Soderbergh knows that and knows that we know that and hopes that we do not know that he knows that we know that so that he can play with our minds once again.  That is indeed the goal, but this film stops short of even making it to the red zone.  It is just that everybody is having such a good time they never really notice that this movie is barely a pale imitation of the original (remake), which is underscored when the cast is once again going through all those made up names for players and capers.  Inviting such comparisons to ""Ocean's Eleven"" is not always a good thing in this movie, because it always loses out.That is not to say that the cast is not engaging.  They throw Catherine Zeta-Jones into the mix so that she can fulfill the same role with Brad Pitt that Julia Roberts played for George Clooney in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  But compare the characters in the two films and you will find that Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac and the rest having absolutely nothing in this film like the set pieces they had the first time around.  Everybody had their moment to shine in the first film, but in the second they are more likely to be sitting around in a jail cell.  If there was one thing they would have wanted to duplicate here it was those set pieces.  But instead of Bernie Mac persuading somebody to sell him some vans we get him being miffed about the gang being called Ocean's Eleven.  At least he gets that moment because some of the others get a lot less than that little bit and that is a big shame.The other problems are that when we get to the big revelation at the end we have two reactions, each of which is rather fatal to our enjoyment of the film.  The first is that the payoff was not worth the confusion.  Certainly it is not half as interesting as the caper in the original (remake).  The second is that the final revelation is essentially a cheat, offering a radical interpretation of the prior events to show how they done did it this time around.  In trying to do the same thing but in a different way to try and get away with it the second time the end product is a film where the best say you can say for the production is the cast got to spend time shooting in Europe.",3,Twelve is not the new eleven; it is more like an old five,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,3353,"['Remember', 'chuckle', 'got', 'end', 'credits', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'when', 'said', 'Introducing', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Tess', 'Keep', 'mind', 'when', 'watch', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'playing', 'joke', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'sequel', 'best', 'moments', 'have', 'been', 'films', 'greatest', 'crime', 'was', 'substituting', 'style', 'substance', '2004', 'film', 'star', 'power', 'up', 'last', 'substance', 'came', 'back', 'gawk', 'stars', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'are', 'back', 'watch', 'gang', 'pull', 'off', 'complicated', 'heist', 'have', 'do', 'time', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'tracked', 'down', 'eleven', 'gang', 'members', 'told', 'money', 'back', 'interest', 'So', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'are', 'putting', 'gang', 'together', 'looking', 'big', 'job', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'deadline.If', 'one', 'lesson', 'learned', 'watching', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'was', 'assume', 'EVERYTHING', 'part', 'master', 'plan', 'course', 'goal', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'fake', 'viewer', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Soderbergh', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'know', 'so', 'can', 'play', 'minds', 'once', 'again', 'indeed', 'goal', 'film', 'short', 'even', 'making', 'red', 'zone', 'just', 'everybody', 'having', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'never', 'really', 'notice', 'movie', 'barely', 'pale', 'imitation', 'original', 'remake', 'underscored', 'when', 'cast', 'once', 'again', 'going', 'made', 'up', 'names', 'players', 'capers', 'Inviting', 'such', 'comparisons', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'always', 'not', 'say', 'cast', 'not', 'engaging', 'throw', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'mix', 'can', 'fulfill', 'same', 'role', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'compare', 'characters', 'two', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'rest', 'having', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'set', 'pieces', 'had', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'Everybody', 'had', 'moment', 'shine', 'first', 'film', 'second', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'sitting', 'around', 'jail', 'cell', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'duplicate', 'here', 'was', 'set', 'pieces', 'instead', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'persuading', 'somebody', 'sell', 'vans', 'get', 'being', 'miffed', 'gang', 'being', 'called', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'least', 'moment', 'others', 'get', 'lot', 'less', 'little', 'bit', 'big', 'shame.The', 'other', 'problems', 'are', 'when', 'get', 'big', 'revelation', 'end', 'have', 'two', 'reactions', 'rather', 'fatal', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'first', 'payoff', 'was', 'not', 'confusion', 'Certainly', 'not', 'half', 'as', 'interesting', 'caper', 'original', 'remake', 'second', 'final', 'revelation', 'essentially', 'cheat', 'offering', 'radical', 'interpretation', 'prior', 'events', 'show', 'how', 'done', 'did', 'time', 'around', 'trying', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'different', 'way', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'second', 'time', 'end', 'product', 'film', 'where', 'best', 'say', 'can', 'say', 'production', 'cast', 'got', 'spend', 'time', 'shooting', 'Europe']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

Brad Pitt introduces us to the new character, Isabel (Catherine Zeta Jones), who just happens to be federal agent with a great lead on the heist pulled by the 11.  Pitt's character, Rusty, flees the scene and we fast forward to the present.We now catch up with the various members and current situations.  Danny (George Clooney) and Tess (Julia Roberts) are now married and doing well.  That is, until Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracks them down.  From here, he confronts every person that was involved in the heist and tells them he wants all of it back including interest over three years.  So, the gang has to come up with a plan.  Since they are too hot to work in the states, they head overseas to Amsterdam.Here, they take a small job just to get started and learn that Benedict had help from another thief known as the Night Fox (Vincent Cassell).  Danny and the Night Fox meet and make a bet as to who can steal an egg first.  That will prove who the better thief is. Thus, the scheme begins.Like Ocean'11, the movie takes us on a ride that keeps the audience guessing what is going to happen next, as well as racking the brain to try to pick up clues and hints along the way.  Steven Soderbergh does another fantastic job directing the great looking cast.Matt Damon's character, Linus, gets to use his wits a little bit more in this film.  Yet, he still gets a little mixed up.  This just continues the training that he received from Danny and Rusty in the first film.  The film also includes a few cameos by people like Bruce Willis and...Julia Roberts???Other members of the crew that gets laughs includes the Chinese ""grease man"" played by Shaobo Qin, Basher (Don Cheadle), and Frank (Bernie Mac).  Like the trailers show, they are all back.  This includes classic comedy actor Elliott Gould, Scott Caan, Casey Afleck, Carl Reiner, and Livingston Dell.  Zeta Jones is a great addition to the already stunning looking cast.  We later learn that she plays a crucial part in the film, even if she may not know it.Even though the film is not as good or clever as the first, it still manages to entertain on its own.  The star power only helps give it the slick look that it needs to keep the audience interested and satisfied.",4,"12 not quite the new 11, but close",1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,2301,"['Ocean', '12', 'starts', 'where', 'Ocean', '11', 'leaves', 'off', '3', 'years', 'earlier', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'new', 'character', 'Isabel', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'federal', 'agent', 'great', 'lead', 'heist', 'pulled', '11', 'Pitt', 'character', 'Rusty', 'scene', 'fast', 'forward', 'present.We', 'now', 'up', 'various', 'members', 'current', 'situations', 'Danny', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Tess', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'doing', 'well', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'down', 'here', 'person', 'was', 'involved', 'heist', 'back', 'including', 'interest', 'three', 'years', 'So', 'gang', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'are', 'too', 'hot', 'work', 'states', 'head', 'overseas', 'Amsterdam.Here', 'take', 'small', 'job', 'just', 'get', 'started', 'learn', 'Benedict', 'had', 'help', 'thief', 'known', 'Night', 'Fox', 'Vincent', 'Cassell', 'Danny', 'Night', 'Fox', 'meet', 'make', 'bet', 'who', 'can', 'steal', 'egg', 'first', 'will', 'prove', 'who', 'better', 'thief', 'Thus', 'scheme', 'begins.Like', ""Ocean'11"", 'movie', 'ride', 'audience', 'guessing', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'as', 'well', 'racking', 'brain', 'try', 'pick', 'up', 'clues', 'hints', 'way', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'fantastic', 'job', 'directing', 'great', 'looking', 'cast.Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'Linus', 'use', 'wits', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'film', 'still', 'little', 'mixed', 'up', 'just', 'training', 'received', 'Danny', 'Rusty', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'few', 'cameos', 'people', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Other', 'members', 'crew', 'Chinese', 'grease', 'man', 'played', 'Shaobo', 'Qin', 'Basher', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Frank', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'trailers', 'show', 'are', 'back', 'classic', 'comedy', 'actor', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Casey', 'Afleck', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Livingston', 'Dell', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'great', 'addition', 'already', 'stunning', 'looking', 'cast', 'later', 'learn', 'crucial', 'part', 'film', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'it.Even', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'clever', 'first', 'still', 'entertain', 'own', 'star', 'power', 'only', 'give', 'slick', 'look', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'satisfied']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

This isn't a BAD movie at all...it's actually quite good.  However, it just isn't as slick as the first one, and it doesn't have the whole ""super-cool heist"" element of the first movie, and that's what made ""Ocean's 11"" so damn good.The premise of ""Ocean's 12"" is that Terry Benedict (played by Andy Garcia) has received an anonymous tip about the crew that robbed his casino a few years ago.  He personally visits each member of the crew and delivers an ultimatum: repay all the money that was stolen from him, with interest, in two weeks, or he'll kill them.  Everyone is forced to band together again in search of a new scam so they can repay Benedict and save their own skins.Like the first movie, there are a lot of twists and turns in ""Ocean's 12"" that keep the story moving and the audience entertained.  There's another mastermind feeding Benedict information, and his motives are quite surprising (and comical).  The addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones to the cast is one of the best things about the film: her character works for the government and she is trying to bring down her former flame Rusty (Brad Pitt) and the rest of the gang before they can pull off another job.There is a bit involving Julia Roberts that is by far the best part of the movie.  I'm not going to spoil it by going into detail, but you'll be laughing hysterically when you see it.  (It was kind of a predictable twist, since they started hinting at it right at the start of the film, but it's still really funny.)  Also, there are a lot of celebrity cameos in this movie, so keep your eyes open: you'll be very surprised when you see who pops up on screen!Overall, this is a good movie: funny, smart, and very entertaining.  I think my expectations were too high because I enjoyed the first movie so much, and there was no way ""Ocean's 12"" could possibly have lived up to my standards.  It really is good, though, and it's one of the few sequels that's actually worth seeing.",4,"A little disappointing, but still worth your time",1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,2057,"['love', 'Ocean', '11', 'as', 'much', 'do', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Ocean', '12', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'However', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'slick', 'first', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'super-cool', 'heist', 'element', 'first', 'movie', 'what', 'made', 'Ocean', '11', 'so', 'damn', 'good.The', 'premise', 'Ocean', '12', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'received', 'anonymous', 'tip', 'crew', 'robbed', 'casino', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'personally', 'member', 'crew', 'delivers', 'ultimatum', 'repay', 'money', 'was', 'stolen', 'interest', 'two', 'weeks', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'Everyone', 'forced', 'band', 'together', 'again', 'search', 'new', 'scam', 'can', 'repay', 'Benedict', 'save', 'own', 'skins.Like', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'lot', 'twists', 'Ocean', '12', 'keep', 'story', 'moving', 'audience', 'entertained', 'mastermind', 'feeding', 'Benedict', 'information', 'motives', 'are', 'quite', 'surprising', 'comical', 'addition', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'cast', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'character', 'works', 'government', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'former', 'flame', 'Rusty', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'rest', 'gang', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'job.There', 'bit', 'involving', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'going', 'detail', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'when', 'see', 'was', 'kind', 'predictable', 'twist', 'started', 'hinting', 'right', 'start', 'film', 'still', 'really', 'funny', 'Also', 'are', 'lot', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'movie', 'so', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'surprised', 'when', 'see', 'who', 'pops', 'up', 'screen', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'funny', 'smart', 'very', 'entertaining', 'think', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'way', 'Ocean', '12', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'lived', 'up', 'standards', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'few', 'sequels', 'actually', 'worth', 'seeing']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

Beusch,"[4, 16]","Ocean's 11, both the 1960 and 2001 version, are entertaining, star-studded vehicles that have an interesting and engaging plot in addition to the stellar cast. Ocean's 12 also resembles one of the old Rat Pack films. Unfortunately, it resembles the Rat Pack films Sargeant's Three, Four for Texas and Robin and the Seven Hoods. Namely, it's a film with which the producers figured they had enough star wattage to overcome a terrible screenplay. But all the king's horses (or the chairman of the board's, for that matter) can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.The ""plot"" is that Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is back, he's mad and he wants the money back that Ocean's Eleven stole from him in the first film. In addition to the crew from the first film, we have the stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones, who hopefully had the sense to at least realize that she was attached to a dud before filming wrapped. The cast goofs its way around the screen for two hours, figuring that since they had such a ball filming this 120 minute cast party, the audience will have a ball as well even though the script is trash. However, all the film has to offer is some location footage in Europe, a bunch of warmed-over, unexciting capers and a lame new adversary (Vincent Cassel). All this is made even more surprising by the presence in the director's chair of Steven Soderbergh. It's shocking to realize that the force behind Sex, Lies and Videotape, Erin Brockovich and Traffic would allow himself to be attached to this aimless, formless, boring romp.Perhaps the low point in the film comes when Julia Roberts, as Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) wife, Tess, impersonates ... you guessed it ... Julia Roberts. The audience is treated to fifteen minutes of the most painfully self-congratulatory in-jokes about Roberts and her tics. Bruce Willis shows up in a painful cameo to make sure that even more star power is slapped on the script's cheesy situation. I guess, in Ocean's 13, Brad Pitt, as his character Rusty Ryan, is going to impersonate Brad Pitt and run into Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston at the same time as hilarity ensues.(NOT!)I really wish this stinker hadn't done as well at the box office as it has. Had this film been a flop, the producers would have (1) stopped the series at two films or (2) if they had decided to continue, would have been forced to invest as much time and effort into the script as they did cramming as many stars into the cast roster as possible. It's a lazy, sluggish, uninspired exercise from a lot of people who have the talent to do much, much, much better -- just like the later Rat Pack films. I liked the original and bought it on DVD and was looking forward to the sequel. However, when this bomb comes out on DVD, the only way it's going to be added to my collection is if someone uses it as a coaster for my drink.",1,Recalls the Rat Pack in All the Wrong Ways,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2854,"['Ocean', '11', '1960', '2001', 'version', 'are', 'entertaining', 'star-studded', 'vehicles', 'have', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'plot', 'addition', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Ocean', '12', 'also', 'one', 'old', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'films', 'Sargeant', 'Three', 'Four', 'Texas', 'Robin', 'Seven', 'Hoods', 'Namely', 'film', 'producers', 'figured', 'had', 'enough', 'star', 'wattage', 'overcome', 'terrible', 'screenplay', 'king', 'horses', 'chairman', 'board', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'Humpty', 'Dumpty', 'back', 'together', 'plot', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'back', 'mad', 'money', 'back', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'stole', 'first', 'film', 'addition', 'crew', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'stunning', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'hopefully', 'had', 'sense', 'least', 'realize', 'was', 'attached', 'dud', 'filming', 'wrapped', 'cast', 'goofs', 'way', 'screen', 'two', 'hours', 'figuring', 'had', 'ball', 'filming', '120', 'minute', 'cast', 'party', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'ball', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'script', 'trash', 'However', 'film', 'offer', 'location', 'footage', 'Europe', 'bunch', 'warmed-over', 'unexciting', 'capers', 'lame', 'new', 'adversary', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'surprising', 'presence', 'director', 'chair', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'shocking', 'realize', 'force', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Traffic', 'would', 'allow', 'be', 'attached', 'aimless', 'formless', 'boring', 'romp.Perhaps', 'low', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'George', 'Clooney', 'wife', 'Tess', 'guessed', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'audience', 'treated', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'most', 'painfully', 'self-congratulatory', 'in-jokes', 'Roberts', 'tics', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'up', 'painful', 'cameo', 'make', 'sure', 'even', 'more', 'star', 'power', 'slapped', 'script', 'cheesy', 'situation', 'guess', 'Ocean', '13', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'going', 'impersonate', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'run', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'same', 'time', 'hilarity', 'ensues.', 'NOT', 'really', 'wish', 'stinker', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'as', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'flop', 'producers', 'would', 'have', '1', 'stopped', 'series', 'two', 'films', '2', 'had', 'decided', 'continue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'invest', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'script', 'did', 'cramming', 'many', 'stars', 'cast', 'roster', 'possible', 'lazy', 'sluggish', 'uninspired', 'exercise', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'talent', 'do', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'later', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'films', 'liked', 'original', 'bought', 'DVD', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'sequel', 'However', 'when', 'bomb', 'out', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', 'going', 'be', 'added', 'collection', 'someone', 'coaster', 'drink']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

The Eleven from the first film find themselves tracked down by a very irate Terry Benedict (Garcia).  He wants his money back ($160 million to be exact), and if that means the Eleven have to come out of ""retirement"" to do it, then so be it.  They have two weeks before he enacts his revenge.  That is enough to get the gang back together to plan a couple of heists to return Benedict's money to him.  As the capers progress, they find that another thief, by the name of the Night Fox, is out to prove that he is better than them.  Of course, this throws a wrench into their plans, and they must make a deal with him if they want any hope of getting the money they so desperately need.  Also on their trail is Europol agent Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones), who has a history with Rusty (Pitt) that may prove his downfall.""Ocean's Twelve"" is almost everything its predacessor was.  Plot is secondary to the interaction of all the big names who seem to be having the time of their lives making this fun film.  And it is a fun film to watch.  Pitt, Zeta-Jones, Clooney, Damon, and Roberts are the ""stars"" of the film, hogging the majority of the screen time.  Also, there are some surprise cameos that work very well.  Some of the best jokes come at Julia Roberts' expense, and she is a trooper for going along with a story point that some viewers might not truly appreciate.  I Think it works.All in all, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is an enjoyable film that falls just short of its predacessor.  It is an entertaining heist movie that works really well.

885574,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B0007P0XBO,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 0]","After grossing nearly one-hundred and eighty-five million dollars domestically and well over four-hundred and fifty million dollars world-wide, Warner Brother executives were eager to jump on the bandwagon while the property was still hot and pump out a sequel as quickly, and cheaply, as possible. Steven Soderbergh insisted that the production budget be kept around the same as that of the original film - eight-five million dollars respectively - and asked all his actors, specifically George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, to take significant pay cuts from their usual twenty-million dollar-per-picture salary. And with the WB studio in a tight market race, currently tied for second place with The Walt Disney Company, they need a hit more then ever, especially if they want to come close to recovering profits lost on the multi-million dollar disaster, Alexander. Perhaps the executives of the studio could learn a thing or two from these con-artists.The story picks up some time after the original film ended and takes audiences across such glamorous European locations as Amsterdam, Paris and Rome in another crime-capping adventure. It has been three years since Danny Ocean and the rest of the gang of thieves and con artists broke into the ""impenetrable"" vault of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas casino and ripped a cool one-hundred and sixty million dollars right under his nose. After splitting the money amongst the eleven members of the Ocean's team, each went their separate ways, with the exception for Danny and Tess of course, and attempted to lie low and live an easy going life with their newly acquired fortune. Unfortunately for them, a fellow con-artist with a grudge against the group breaks Rule Number One by ratting them out to Terry Benedict, thus causing the ruthless casino owner to pay a visit to each and every one of the team members demanding a return of his one-hundred and ninety-eight million dollars - that's the amount of money they stole plus interest over three years - within two weeks. Considering they are too hot to find suitable work in the United States after their last stunt, they travel to Europe to steal an antique item only to run into complications with their criminal rival, ""The Night Fox"", who just happened to be the man who broke Rule Number One. On top of that, the gang has to deal with Isabel Lahiri, an intrepid female Europol agent with extensive links with Rusty Ryan, who is vividly determined to catch them in the act. When it comes to the story treatment for Ocean's Twelve, one must learn not to take these sorts of genres, specifically the caper-comedy, seriously. They are for mere entertainment purposes only and not to be destined, or taken as such, for Oscar-caliber quality or serious thought. On another note, the script is not as original as it may seem. In fact, it was originally designed as John Woo action-flick vehicle but when it came to developing the highly-anticipated sequel to Ocean's Eleven, Warner Brothers decided to rewrite the script to specifically fit with each of the characters of the series. Though some may feel cheated by this piece of trivia, this turns out ten times better then anything John Woo could have slapped together, so look on the bright side of things here.The complication Ocean's Twelve faces, the exact same predicament the original feature ran into three years ago, is that with so many cast members, specifically ones with marquee names, increases the likelihood of each person receiving limited screen time which inevitably causes complaints of certain characters being underused. Quite surprisingly, the whole Brad Pitt/Catherine Zeta-Jones romance angle worked amazingly well and added yet another intriguing twist to the already complicated storyline. Unfortunately, what does not work out quite as well as it should have was the ""family"" element to Catherine Zeta-Jones' Isabel Lahiri, if it can be properly described as such. There is hardly any mention of her family other then in limited moments of the film and the scene near the end where she reunites with her father seemed senselessly tacked onto the end without a second thought as to what it should have meant but was not. Perhaps it is due to all these separate story elements - the romance between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the wager with ""The Night Fox"" - that George Clooney's Danny Ocean seems quite left out of the picture compared to the last go-around where it was completely and entirely his film. Not that this was a significant problem but this is just yet another demonstration of the sometimes unequal shifting of story involvement amongst the numerous characters of the film series. Without giving too much information away, let us simply say that the way Tess is used in order to help the Ocean's gang pilfer a specific item from an Italian art museum was hilarious. Sure, it does wear a little thin as more time is spent on but, in the end, it works invariably. The only one that can truly be said as being underused in this picture is Andy Garcia reprising his role as the menacing Terry Benedict, the victim of Ocean's Eleven's casino heist from the first film. His appearance in the film, in the beginning and near the end, is really nothing more then a mere cameo, possibly to fulfill the contractual obligation he signed to appear in the sequel with the rest of the cast. This, on the other hand, can not be said of Matt Damon's Linus Caldwell who seems to have had a significant increase in the amount of screen time from the last film, playing a more central role in the story, specifically near the end.Overall, Ocean's Twelve, in spite of its failure to surpass the magnificence of the original which essentially set the precedent for all modern crime capers to follow, does indeed match it based on pure entertainment value and would certainly be a feature Frank Sinatra and the rest of the crooning Rat Pack would be proud of. All in all, the film itself has very few problems to raise complaint about - A drawback that was apparent with Ocean's Eleven as well was that the first thirty minutes of the picture start off quite laboriously and nothing exactly interesting happens or no real action occurs. Granted, this is to set up the situation and the characters but considering this is a sequel and most audience members are aware of the original film, this should not have taken as long as it did. And was it absolutely necessary to bring back every single member of the original Ocean's Eleven cast for this film? Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner barely appear at all - you could count on both hands, possibly only one, the number of lines each one of them has in this feature - and should have been written out entirely based on what they contribute - nothing. Middling complaints aside, Steven Soderbergh's skillful editing, mixing and cinematography style works wonders, except for the occasional still-picture shots, near the beginning and the end of the film, but are not so off-putting as to be entirely noticeable or discomforting. Though not holding quite the level of prestige as some notable sequels that have managed to surpass the expectations set upon by the first film might have, the series still able to maintain its suave composure, intricate white, and stylized flare to make more then worthwhile viewing over the holiday season this year.",4,The Moose Hole - The House Wins Again!,1102723200,"12 11,

885575,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0007P0XBO,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 4]","After the tightly plotted, detailed heist depicted in ""Ocean's Eleven,"" I can see how some people would be disappointed in the loosey-goosey, improvisational style of its sequel, ""Ocean's Twelve."" It's as if Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and the others, fed up with actually having had to WORK on the first film, just decided to take a European vacation and improvise a story from their home movies. However, I found the good spirits and jokiness of ""Ocean's Twelve"" hard to resist. The plot has Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracking down Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his cohorts, demanding repayment of the $160 million (plus interest) they stole from his casinos. This means they have to plot new heists, and fast. However, they find their efforts at thievery thwarted at every turn by a mysterious figure known as the Black Fox (Vincent Cassel). Also complicating their efforts is Isabel (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the ex-girlfriend of Rusty (Pitt), who also inconveniently happens to be an Interpol agent. The film has plot twists galore, including one in which Danny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts) is forced to impersonate a certain well-known actress who shall remain nameless here.

885576,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007P0XBO,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","This sequel to 2001's hit movie ""Ocean's Eleven"" reunites director Stephen Soderbergh with its all-star cast, and even adds a couple of stars. Three years after they knocked over Las Vegas' Bellagio Casino, heist mastermind Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is living the straight and narrow with Tess (Julia Roberts), while the rest of the gang has scattered around the world. The Bellagio's vindictive manager Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) vowed to make the thieves pay, and now he has found them all. Benedict gives Ocean's Eleven two weeks to pay back the money they stole, with interest, or take their chances with his assassins. The guys don't have the money, so it's off to Europe to steal the necessary funds. A heist in Amsterdam puts an ambitious EuroPol agent, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), on their trail. And Ocean's crew have unwittingly gotten themselves into a competition between thieves, but it's not clear who is challenging them or why.The trouble with ""Ocean's Twelve"" is that director Stephen Soderbergh was apparently so preoccupied with his own cleverness that he forgot about the audience. I get the impression that everyone involved with the film participated for his or her own enjoyment, but the viewer is left in the cold. Audiences want to see an ingenious heist in a heist flick, but there is none here. Soderbergh has filled this film with A-list movie stars: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julia Roberts. Yet he undermines their strengths by shooting indoor scenes in dim, orange, incandescent light, partially out-of-focus. We can't see the guys' faces, and Julia Roberts looks absolutely homely. At least Catherine Zeta-Jones looks good, if ridiculous, in leather power suits. The script is more nonsensical than is reasonable even in a cheesy heist flick. It consists mainly of disjointed meaningless conversations that are supposed to be funny. There are some awkward cameos by movie stars playing themselves. So we don't have a story, attractive stars, or a heist.We do have style, for better or worse. Where ""Ocean's Eleven"" took inspiration from the story in the original 1960 film that starred Hollywood's Rat Pack, ""Ocean's Twelve"" embraces the style of the Swingin' Sixties. Shots flipped on their side, quick cutting, and mugging at the camera recall television of that era  ""Ocean's Twelve"" isn't bad light entertainment if you're looking for something that doesn't demand -or benefit from- your full attention. But constant reminders that the folks on the screen are having more fun that you are is off-putting.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005 release): The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer.

885577,A1KAR9G699RM56,B0007P0XBO,M. Miller,"[0, 1]","First of all, I have neither seen the previous Ocean's Eleven nor the original Ocean's Eleven. And with that out of the way...This story takes the 11 thieves across the world to repay for their crimes.  However, all is not so simple for the group as a competitor trained by the best starts to compete with them.  In addition, with the team's safety already on the rocks a detective, played by Catherine Zeta Jones, gets ever closer to catching them.My opinion of this movie is low for two reasons.  First of all this frankly isn't my type of movie.  What is the difference between thieves and robbers really?  Well, there is apparently enough to make the thieves the good guys (although this is a very thief vs. thief movie.)Second of all, the movie has a twist, a big one.  Now I am not going to give it away, but pretty much it makes a large chunk of the movie unnecessary and really quite pointless.  Not to mention the twelfth member's lack of involvement.  Really no point in being twelve except maybe it makes the name a little more interesting.The only saving grace was the limited amount of humor in the character's interactions.  Yet that even failed with an overplayed, boring, and at first way over your head, spoof about Julia Robert's character having a resemblance to, guess what, Julia Roberts!In summary, I cannot compare it to any previous Ocean movie so I am just going to say the movie was not worth it.  It was not worth the price of the ticket nor my time.  If you like crime movies then that will help, but the humor is lacking and the crimes aren't even interesting.

Hmmm.  So full stars like the first, hell, it had to be at least slightly entertaining?  Right?  Well. . . yeah, it was mildly entertaining, and I think that most of the revulsion waited until the credits were rolling to actually subdue me.  Was there a point here that I missed?  Not really.  The first installment was (though not the greatest movie of all time . . . . not even close)fun to watch if you didn't dig too deep, but the sequel flutters like an expiring balloon.  Andy Garcia hunts down all the evil-doers who ganked $160 million dollars from his Las Vegas casino in the first movie and gives them two weeks to pay all the money back, plus interest.  Which they all get together to do.  Now... am I missing the point here or could they just have had him whacked out and be done with it.  Short movie then, but at least more plausable.  Hell, he got the money back through his insurance.  And the fact that we're supposed to look at them as good little criminals who would never dream of killing anyone . . . where's Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro?  F*ck that!  All in all, it's pretty stupid and pretty pointless and the fact that it all boils down to a rivialry between the master of all French thieves and Ocean's Twelve really makes it hard to swallow.  Julia Roberts plays Tess pretending to be Julia Roberts and that's probably the most entertaining part of this whole movie.  That and Bruce Willis' cameo.  Far more movies out there to make this one look like what it was: a sad sequel to a mediocre movie with so much star-power that it detracts from everything else.

This gets confusing.- The ""big heist"" they're supposed to pull off isn't nearly as cool as the first one. You don't witness too much of the planning, and the execution is completely boggled. Most of it is improvisation on the characters' part; they seem less ""in control"" of the situation as they did in the first movie.- A few REALLY cheesy scenes--*SPOILER ALERT* Like the scene where Julia Roberts's character pretends to be Julia Roberts *END SPOILER*- Qute a few unnecessary scenes and sub-plots--*SPOILERS* For example, the Bruce Willis cameo and the search for Isabel's father *END SPOILERS*Bottom line: Don't even bother renting.

Except for the neo-rat-pack having fun, and maybe encouraging the viewer to believe he/she is a member and in on all the sly inside wit, it is a bit hard to see the attraction of this film.Yes, some reviewers gave Twelve three stars--am it is unclear why.  It is long, disorganized, pandering, narcissistic, and without much coherence to the plot.Basically, the gang from the last film has been caught by the obnoxious casino owner.  He will kill them all if they don't repay what they stole from the casino vault--with interest.  For no clear reason, they head off to Europe to pull an even bigger heist.  Along the way, they fall into rivalry with a master thief reminiscent of 'the Fox' in the Peter Sellers classic ""After the Fox.""Through it all, it is virtually impossible to tell what is going on or to discern just what role most of Ocean's dozen will play in the proposed new heist.

As the advance material on TV says, the victim Mr. Benedict wants back his 0.16 billion with interest, giving the gang 2 weeks to get it before he takes it out of their hides (apparently, when you're that rich, murder for hire is but a trivial expense account item).  Clooney and his crew are forced to become expatriates to do any real stealing, so they're off to Amsterdam and a romp over the European Union in general.  They soon discover, however, that Europe is not big enough for TWO such bella donnas, so Ocean begins his competition and cooperation with ""Night Fox"", revered by the European authorities as as much of a master in robbery as Rembrandt is to painting, on account of his mentoring and his own accomplishments.  I'm thinking that his presence is what makes the Eleven into Twelve.  The plot moves to Italy, with the focus being on the Romanoffs' Coronation Faberg&eacute; egg, a target that would give N.F. the compassion to pay off Ocean et al.'s debts from his endless bank accounts, should they get it.  But after this, the plot begins to splinter into many shattered parts, and I couldn't keep up with it.  Benedict has some sort of hand in the whole thing, in combination with Night Fox, and before long, you feel you're in the middle of something like Dickens' ""Great Expectations"".  The camera work and the action are quite good though, on what looks like an anamorphic 2.35:1 presentation, and just letting the scenes flow over you is not a bad experience.

Pee Kitty ""PK""","[2, 4]","Quick Summary:Imagine if the Ocean's crew were dropped, without explanation, into a non-comedic version of the old Pink Panther movies, while the director tried to pretend that it hadn't happened.Full version:After the success of the excellent Ocean's Eleven, the studio was under pressure to quickly capitalize on it. They needed a sequel, and they needed one NOW. Unfortunately, writing a good screenplay takes time, so they decided to adapt an existing one. Someone tracked down a decent script involving an ensemble cast of thieves, and a team of writers hastily swapped the Ocean's crew in instead and added some ties to the first film.The result? A film that feels like what it is -- a patchwork, overdone monstrosity. The plot makes no real sense -- the action is easy enough to follow but the characters' motivations don't make any sense. The ending has two ""big reveals"", one of which you see coming from a mile away. The other... is one of those twists that you don't see coming only because there was never once a hint of foreshadowing. One that has to ""cheat"" by being completely hidden, because if they had even hinted at it (like with a good twist), you would've seen THAT one coming as well.All in all, a clunky mish-mash of attempted action, attempted suspense, attempted comedy, and bad plot twists. Save your money and skip right from Ocean's Eleven to Ocean's Thirteen. You won't regret it, and you don't need to know a thing about this movie to understand it.

It wasn't an Oscar-caliber film, but it wasn't an embarassment to Steven Soderbergh, either.The sequel may cause Steven to cringe when he looks back on it. Featuring all manner of experimental camera work, for which the director has become known after Traffic, it also features a storyline so convoluted that you'll spend most of the movie going, ""Huh?"" By assuming that our bond with the characters from the first film will carry over to the second, Soderbergh grants himself the freedom to pack four hours of plot into a two-hour window with little explication and even less character development.The resulting mess is somewhat redeemed by the sheer star power, but even the sudden appearance of Bruce Willis cannot quite save a pivotal scene that plays on the fame of one of the stars.

This time around, they've managed to add several more talented actors to a cast that was incredible to begin with.  I don't think an excess of stars is what did this film in, though.  The actors continue to work well together - its a misguided script that is the biggest culprit.Things take a turn for the worst right from the beginning, as we find that this time around they will be pulling off their heists in order to repay Benedict, the same man they defied against impossible odds in the first film.  This might have seemed like a good idea at the time, a way to defy the conventions of this kind of film, but its not carried out in a convincing way.  Even worse, the fact that Ocean's gang are reuniting out of fear this time puts a big damper on things.  There's an air of desperation about the gang this time, and it tends to undermine their sense of fun.  Not to mention it raises the question of how they ever got up the nerve to pull off that last big heist in the first place.  They owned Mr. Benedict in the last film, completely, yet this time around they are so afraid of him that they'll do just about anything to pay him back.I could forgive all the careless storytelling if the sense of comraderie or the snappy banter that really carried the first film was still there.

An attractive cast of well-known actors allowed to be as charming and rascally as possible, creating a sense of fun that carried right out to the audience.  We felt we were picking up on a little of the vibe that the actors themselves had when making the film...""we're slumming and we love it.""  It also had an actual heist to be involved in, which when finally executed, was taut, amusing and generated real suspense and surprise.OCEAN'S TWELVE loses almost all of that.  The actor's seem more pleased with themselves than actually having fun.  No doubt folks like George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones pulled own nice paychecks, spent most of their time in luxury hotels in beautiful European cities and probably never really looked at their scripts until they showed up on set.  It feels that way to the viewer at least.The premise is that they are forced to return the money they stole in the first movie (with interest), and naturally they have spent it all already.  So they have to concoct a bigger heist.  There's also some side-stuff dealing with another thief who may or may not be helping/thwarting them in their efforts.  To be quite honest, when the movie was done, I had to really wonder just what exactly had happened.  The implication was that they hadn't really pulled off a heist at all.  Who knows?  And more importanly...who cares!The movie kind of rambles.  And it makes huge mistakes in the use of its cast.  In the first, the ""stars"" (Clooney, Pitt, Julia Roberts) received quite a bit of support from their lesser stars (Matt Damon...really funny, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould (big laughs), Carl Reiner, etc.).  In OCEAN'S TWELVE, these guys are relegated to background roles, imprisoned early on, etc.  They are sorely missed.  It was the mixed-up chemistry of the group that added so much spark to the first.  Now we have to look mostly at Clooney & Pitt.  Unless you're huge fans of them at their most smug and self-satisfied, they ain't easy to watch.The only clever part was when the character played by Julia Roberts is forced to impersonate Julia Roberts.  That's pretty funny, and Roberts gamely pokes fun at herself.  However, Roberts (pregnant during the shoot, I think) looks wan and frankly skews from uninterested to unhealthy looking.  She brings very little joy to the proceedings.Everyone involved should feel a little ashamed of themselves, because they're usually quality folks, from the stars to the director.  So it really feels almost palpable that they did it mostly for the money.

885611,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007P0XBO,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","2004`s ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001`s ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off.  When we last saw them, Danny Ocean and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities.  However, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict, the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean`s doorstep demanding restitution.  He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences.  Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it`s never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat).  What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries - one a detective and the other a rival thief - who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film.  For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh have come up with a ha`penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories.  Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start.  Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors.  Moreover, there is a side foray involving Julia Roberts trying to pass herself off as Julia Roberts that is inane, incredible, preposterous and embarrassing.  The sequence is indicative of the lazy, half-hearted approach the filmmakers have taken towards both their material and their audience.It's also unpleasant watching the one character with even a smidgen of a moral code crossing over to the dark side at the end of the story - and asking us to get all misty-eyed and choked-up when it happens (at least when Anakin does it, we aren't expected to cheer him on from the sidelines).The high-priced, big-name actors - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon and Albert Finney - go through the motions, but they seem hopelessly cut adrift by the meandering, substandard screenplay.  Actually, only Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the detective and former girlfriend of Brad Pitt, is given anything of genuine substance to work with here.  All the rest are just picking up paychecks.In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it.

I often comment that all Julia Roberts can do is play variations of herself in movies- or to put it another way, no matter what she does in a movie, it's Julia Roberts all over again.  The joke this time is on me.  Amidst the plethora (gotta use the word once in a while)of stars, some of whom simply walk through their parts, is Julia- who is doing herself. I mean it. She plays herself. That's not a bad device-especially since it's what she does best.That aside (or even likewise), there's not too much to this flick.  It either confuses or leaves much of the mystery out (which is why it all has to be explained in the last scene), and there's hardly any attention devoted to how they pull off their capers. A lot of technical stuff is minimized- which is fine with me- but in its place the film merely chugs along as the gang meanders from one mistake to another, more like the Pink Panther than a Topkopi.  The cast does appear to enjoy themselves, which is probably true, but there's not much acting going on. It's the Oceans 11 gang just  reprising for a laugh. In some instances, it gets downright embarassing as when, in an obvious satirical effort, Matt Damon over-does his naive role. Most often, these stars simply throw digs at each other and use their moronic lines to poke fun- all giggles but no substance.  The European locations for many of the scenes are invitingly filmed: Amsterdam and Rome look splendid and provide wonderful backdrops- especially if you've seen enough of Vegas, and who hasn't?! Otherwise, the script is not too deep, the scheme is far too superficial and most humor has to rely on slapstick.  All in all- it's a romp, but one that's not very daring.  If there's a plus it's Catherine Zeta Jones getting more screen time than Julia- always  a positive- but don't take this film too seriously and don't expect much. It's light entertainment and a feast for the stargazer -more for the voyeur than the viewer- and that's about it.",3,WELL- WHAT HAVE WE HERE?,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1997,"['one', 'books', 'often', 'comment', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'can', 'do', 'play', 'variations', 'movies-', 'put', 'way', 'matter', 'what', 'movie', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'joke', 'time', 'Amidst', 'plethora', 'got', 'ta', 'word', 'once', 'while', 'stars', 'whom', 'simply', 'walk', 'parts', 'Julia-', 'who', 'doing', 'mean', 'not', 'bad', 'device-especially', 'what', 'aside', 'even', 'likewise', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'flick', 'much', 'mystery', 'why', 'be', 'explained', 'last', 'scene', 'hardly', 'attention', 'devoted', 'how', 'pull', 'off', 'capers', 'lot', 'technical', 'stuff', 'minimized-', 'fine', 'me-', 'place', 'film', 'merely', 'along', 'gang', 'meanders', 'one', 'mistake', 'more', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Topkopi', 'cast', 'appear', 'enjoy', 'probably', 'true', 'not', 'much', 'acting', 'going', 'Oceans', '11', 'gang', 'just', 'reprising', 'laugh', 'instances', 'downright', 'embarassing', 'when', 'obvious', 'satirical', 'effort', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'naive', 'role', 'Most', 'often', 'stars', 'simply', 'throw', 'digs', 'other', 'use', 'moronic', 'lines', 'poke', 'fun-', 'giggles', 'substance', 'European', 'locations', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'invitingly', 'filmed', 'Amsterdam', 'Rome', 'look', 'splendid', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'backdrops-', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'Vegas', 'who', ""n't"", 'Otherwise', 'script', 'not', 'too', 'deep', 'scheme', 'far', 'too', 'superficial', 'most', 'humor', 'rely', 'slapstick', 'all-', 'romp', 'one', 'not', 'very', 'daring', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Julia-', 'always', 'positive-', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'film', 'too', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'light', 'entertainment', 'feast', 'stargazer', '-more', 'voyeur', 'viewer-']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

The scene where Tess, played by Roberts, has to pose as Julia Roberts to get them into the museum to steal a valuable picture, this scene, although intended to be funny, doesn't quite break it. Even the cameo by Bruce Willis doesn't help. It seems that the actors had fun together making 12, but as I was watching them, I didn't feel a part of their jokes. The camera work, mostly handheld, gets quite annoying after a while, especially the quick panning across the room where the 12 are plotting the heist.

It just goes to show that you can have a rock solid cast with the most talented actors in the business and still have a poor story.George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are three of the most intensely talented actors in Hollywood today. And George just has so much charisma and outlandish humor that it's almost enough to make you forget that this story just stinks. I very much wanted to love this film. I TRIED to like it, I really did. But the story is so contrived and predictable that you just want to pull your hair out that you're so bored.The acting has no fault.

I have a couple of questions though, even though I have seen the film several times, there are things I apparently miss, and thought maybe someone could help me out. First, in regard to Linus' mother being the head of whatever international security organization she was with, how could she know that Linus was part of Ocean's gang, and not only not do anything about it but get them all out of jail? How could she aid and abet her son? Was she lying about being the Section Chief?  The other question is similar, in regard to Isabel. She forged the arrest warrant for all of them, and got caught, yet there were no legal repercussions for her.Since I haven't seen ""Lost in Translation,"" what did Matsui do to Linus?How in the world did Yen breathe in that bag for two days, and didn't he ever have to relieve himself? I also missed the reason he had to be sent in the bag in the first place. I really have seen the film, but I miss this stuff.

Having nailed the formula down pat with ""Ocean's Eleven"" - ridiculously implausible action and pulp coincidences, snide and smarmy rock soundtrack (evoking a Guy Ritchie-ish &eacute;lan), smash-cuts and wobbling Steadicams, overlapping, smart-ass dialog, and A-List megastars glutting all 70 millimeters of the widescreen - director Steven Soderbergh now hurls ""Ocean's Twelve"" at us like an elitist Upper Class Molotov cocktail and hopes we don't run screaming into the sallow beigeness of our mundane, everyday lives. Filled as it is with man-toys (from Clooney's too-hip instigator, Danny Ocean, to Damon's stuttering novice, Linus, to Pitt's glib Tyler Durden franchise, here named Rusty Ryan) and toy women (the stunningly rapturous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Rusty's ex-sex, Detective Isabel, and the stunningly bland Julia Roberts playing Tess, Ocean's spouse), we find the camera righteously slewing all over creation trying to cram them all in, making for a movie so self-aware of its megastar cheese-wattage that it can't quite get over its own smugness.2004's ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off. When we last saw them, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities; however, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict (Andy Garcia), the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean's doorstep demanding restitution. He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences. Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it's never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat). What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries, one a detective (Zeta-Jones) and the other a rival thief (Vincent Cassel), who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.With the remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"", things seemed to move so quickly with such flair and style that substance didn't matter that much and it managed to pull off the trick and come across as fluffy fun. The sequel clearly tries to pull off the same trick but it cannot manage it and, although it has some fun moments, it ends up being pretty messy, lacking slick pace and failing to really please the audience in the way that its predecessor did.  ""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film. For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh (""Out of Sight"") have come up with a ha'penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven."" Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories. Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start. Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors.  In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it, whether its eleven or twelve pieces.",2,Oceans Twelve  (2004),1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4374,"['Director', 'Steven', 'SoderberghCast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Elliot', 'Gould.Running', 'Time', '125', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'language.Sesame', 'Street', 'having', 'aneurysm', 'movie', 'slogan', 'Twelve', 'new', 'Eleven', 'Having', 'nailed', 'formula', 'down', 'pat', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'ridiculously', 'implausible', 'action', 'pulp', 'coincidences', 'snide', 'smarmy', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'evoking', 'Guy', 'Ritchie-ish', 'eacute', 'lan', 'smash-cuts', 'wobbling', 'Steadicams', 'overlapping', 'smart-ass', 'dialog', 'A-List', 'megastars', 'glutting', '70', 'millimeters', 'widescreen', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'now', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'elitist', 'Upper', 'Class', 'Molotov', 'cocktail', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'screaming', 'sallow', 'beigeness', 'mundane', 'everyday', 'lives', 'Filled', 'man-toys', 'Clooney', 'too-hip', 'instigator', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'Damon', 'stuttering', 'novice', 'Linus', 'Pitt', 'glib', 'Tyler', 'Durden', 'franchise', 'here', 'named', 'Rusty', 'Ryan', 'toy', 'women', 'stunningly', 'rapturous', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Rusty', 'ex-sex', 'Detective', 'Isabel', 'stunningly', 'bland', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'playing', 'Tess', 'Ocean', 'spouse', 'find', 'camera', 'righteously', 'slewing', 'creation', 'trying', 'cram', 'making', 'movie', 'self-aware', 'megastar', 'cheese-wattage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'own', 'smugness.2004', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'up', 'where', '2001', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'left', 'off', 'When', 'last', 'saw', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'George', 'Clooney', 'hand-picked', 'gang', 'professional', 'thieves', 'had', 'successfully', 'heisted', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'fortunes', 'three', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'casinos', 'then', 'headed', 'separate', 'ways', 'start', 'life', 'anew', 'upstanding', 'members', 'respective', 'communities', 'however', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'past', 'way', 'catching', 'up', 'person', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'try', 'hide', 'when', 'Tony', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Bellagio', 'owner', 'still', 'stewing', 'money', 'was', 'stolen', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'up', 'Ocean', 'doorstep', 'demanding', 'restitution', 'Ocean', 'gang', 'two', 'weeks', 'come', 'up', '97', 'million', 'owe', 'face', 'consequences', 'Thus', 'Danny', 'up', 'gang', 'once', 'again', 'heads', 'off', 'Europe', 'hoping', 'lift', 'few', 'priceless', 'art', 'pieces', 'stave', 'off', 'certain', 'death', 'never', 'made', 'entirely', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'Benedict', 'proposing', 'carry', 'out', 'rather', 'grandiose', 'threat', 'What', 'Danny', ""n't"", 'count', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'up', 'two', 'worthy', 'adversaries', 'one', 'detective', 'Zeta-Jones', 'other', 'rival', 'thief', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'trouble', 'ever', 'bargained', 'for.With', 'remake', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'things', 'seemed', 'move', 'so', 'quickly', 'such', 'flair', 'style', 'substance', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'trick', 'come', 'fluffy', 'fun', 'sequel', 'clearly', 'pull', 'off', 'same', 'trick', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'fun', 'moments', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'messy', 'lacking', 'slick', 'pace', 'failing', 'really', 'please', 'audience', 'way', 'predecessor', 'did', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'disappointment', 'whole', 'host', 'reasons', 'most', 'rooted', 'format', 'structure', 'film', 'second', 'outing', 'writer', 'George', 'Nolfi', 'returning', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Sight', 'have', 'come', 'up', ""ha'penny"", 'storyline', 'intricacy', 'elegance', 'tale', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Not', 'only', 'caper', 'seem', 'haphazardly', 'planned', 'beginning', 'end', 'resolution', 'miserably', 'flat', 'providing', 'amazement', 'amusement', 'expect', 'find', 'kinds', 'stories', 'Perhaps', 'idea', 'stealing', 'priceless', 'Faberge', 'Egg', 'just', ""n't"", 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'chutzpah', 'style', 'knocking', 'whole', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'casino', 'so', 'enterprise', 'more', 'less', 'doomed', 'failure', 'start', 'perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'failed', 'find', 'enough', 'characters', 'do', ""'re"", 'roaming', 'streets', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Rome', 'what', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'extended', 'European', 'vacation', 'talented', 'woefully', 'underused', 'actors', 'type', 'film', 'plotting', 'everything', 'sad', 'truth', 'plotting', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'pretty', 'damn', 'awful', 'way', 'slice', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'pieces']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

For one, this movie felt more like Ocean's 5 instead of 12 as one reviewer put it.

Don't get me wrong, the actors did good considering the script they had to work with but even after viewing this a second time, I felt that more should have been done with the story. Speaking of the story, it is somewhat hard to understand what is going on at times. Now I usually compliment movies that keep the audience guessing as to what is going on but Ocean's 12 seemed to do so for the sake of trying to cover plot holes. I won't give out spoilers but if you liked Ocean's 11 than you should watch this just to see what I'm talking about. Overall, Ocean's 12 is not a bad movie but more should have been done with it in accordance to the first.

885634,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0007P0XBO,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 5]","There is a common maxim in Hollywood that a sequel will probably make 50 - 70% of the money the original made. This is why a huge hit is almost always guaranteed to spawn a sequel.`Ocean's 11' was a fun, glittery romp through Vegas featuring a huge list of stars. The film made a lot of money and all of the A-List celebrities had a great time making the film with director Steven Soderbergh. A sequel was inevitable.`Ocean's 12' is about 50 - 70% as good as the original. If this is good enough for you, please purchase your DVD through Amazon or rent through Netflix. It isn't good enough for me.All of the stars are back and Catherine Zeta-Jones has joined the crew for their new romp, this time, through Europe. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the mark in `11', wants his money back. He searches out each of the people in Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) troupe and threatens them into returning his money, with interest. Rusty (Brad Pitt) and Danny gather the gang to figure out who or what they can rob. Everyone is back, because everyone owes money to Benedict. Linus (Matt Damon) remarks that they are too hot to pull any jobs in the US and the kind of money they need means a big job. They head to Europe. Amsterdam. Rusty has his eye on a reclusive mark who owns the original stock certificate of the Dutch Trading Company. The mark is extremely paranoid of being robbed, so his house is safe. Or is it... Oh, let's face it, with the A-List stars assembled for `12', you probably aren't there to see a great story. Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to have realized this as well.Let's set aside the implausibilities in the screenplay for a moment. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould and all of the rest are back. They are pretty much the same characters they were in the previous film. They like each other. They don't take anything too seriously. They are ready to have some fun and they know they will win. This isn't really a film about performances either. Julia Roberts' character, Tess Ocean, actually impersonates a pregnant Julia Roberts in one scene. It's this kind of wink, wink fun that made the first film such fun. It also captured the spirit of the original starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. perfectly. While making the original, the Rat Pack performed concerts at nightclubs, gambled and then shot the film, in that order.Unfortunately, because the caper stuff is practically non-existent and we know that nothing will ever truly affect any of the stars of `12', we have to like the Wink Wink Nudge Nudge stuff they concoct in order for the film to be a success. The previously mentioned bit about Julia Roberts playing herself is amusing, for a few moments, but it wears thin very quickly. Clooney is very cool and aloof. Nothing, I repeat nothing, ever seems to be giving him the upper hand or causing him to lose any sleep. Pitt is a mirror image of Clooney. They did add a little wrinkle for his character. He has had a relationship with Zeta-Jone's international cop. This seems to be the central relationship in the film and it work's ok, but it also highlights the fact that nothing else is going on with the rest of the cast.Let's address the screenplay for a moment. The film is filled with the most ridiculous implausibilities. Naturally, the first thing you should do if you are trying to keep a low profile is to purchase a well-known hotel, on the Sunset Strip, in West Hollywood, which is frequented by television and movie stars. Pitt's character, Rusty. does this. It also leads to one of the funniest lines in the entire film.The story is convoluted and filled with some of the most ludicrous plans I have ever seen. This would be completely acceptable if there were anything new going on as well. Instead, we get to watch the pretty actors on their European holiday.For long periods of time, many of the b-level characters simply disappear. Conveniently, they are locked up, allowing the few who are free to bring Robert's character into the action.Also, there is a rather pathetic attempt to make Zeta-Jones' character more dramatic. The subplot is so wane that it appears to have been tacked on, at the last minute. The only good thing about this aspect of the story is to watch one of the actors involved, but it doesn't come until the very end.""Ocean's 12"" is barely acceptable because everyone is clearly enjoying themselves. Would I rather watch a bad film in which everyone is enjoying themselves or a bad film in which everyone appears miserable? I'll take the former.Much like ""11"", the sequel uses a lot of locations and this adds a bit to the polished look of the film. First in Amsterdam, then Rome, the film moves around with a wild abandon, again, paying little attention to the story.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of ""12"" is that the director, Soderbergh, displays very little of the cinematic flair he is known for. In his earliest films, he presented the story in an almost Cubist way. Little bits of the narrative would be jumbled up, or there would be small shifts between the dialogue and the actual scene we were watching. For instance, in ""Out of Sight"", Clooney's character is talking to someone on the phone, off screen, as we watch he and Jennifer Lopez share dinner on screen. It is an interesting and effective way to speed up the action and enrich the story. As Soderbergh has gained more and more acclaim, and made films with bigger and bigger budgets, he seems to be slowly abandoning this style. There was a little of it in ""Erin Brockovich"" and in ""Ocean's 11"". There is almost none of it in ""12"". Instead, ""12"" is a fairly standard-looking big budget Hollywood film. Unfortunately, Soderbergh appears to be selling out.I have nothing against a bunch of great looking rich people having fun while they work. But should we pay for the pleasure of watching it as well?",3,One Too Many,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,5938,"['common', 'maxim', 'Hollywood', 'sequel', 'will', 'probably', 'make', '50', '70', '%',

885639,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0007P0XBO,Tsuyoshi,"[13, 17]","'Ocean's Twelve' has committed many typical mistakes when Hollywood studios fail to come up any new ideas, but still want to make a movie quickly.  OK, let me tell you one by one:A) THE DISJOINTED PLOT (or making an unnecessary sequel).  Right, we don't need this.  We already have slick, stylish 'Ocean's Eleven' so why make this one?  Add to this question, what's the point of this new '12' anyway?  George Clooney and other guys came back.  Right, and Andy Garcia's (last time) humiliated casino owner came back, who wants his money back.  So Ocean and his pals have to pull off another heist in Holland, in order to pay the cash quickly.  So far, OK.BUT. hey, anyone, can you summerize this?  The film next introduces another (French) crook Vincent Cassel, and another retired crook, and Catherine Zata Jones's female investigator (from 'Europole', and she happens to know Brad Pitt's character ... how convenient), and many cameos from Hollywood, including Bruce Willis as himself.  And Julia Roberts flies to the place when Ocean's men are in trouble, all the way from America.  To prove what?  I still do not know.B) EUROPEAN LOCATIONS.  And they went out of USA, to travel to such places as Rome and Amsterdam.  That means there is no gorgeous, glittering feeling of Las Vegas, the town which no doubt helped create the stylish mood of the original.  But anyway, the entire cast must have had fun.C) SO MANY CAMEOS and references to other films.  If you don't have good idea, get cameos.  It's easy, you pay just a little (by the standard of Hollywood), the stars work only a day or two, and the audiences will be amused.  That's what some people are thinking.  So, besides the star of 'Pulp Fiction' you see Eddie Izzard, Robbie Coltrane, Jared Harris, Albert Finney, Jeroen Krabbe, Topher Grace ... should I continue?  Plus, there are many film references, none of which are as amusing or intelligent as Tarantino.Am I too harsh?  Maybe or maybe not.  But I am sure that what was good in '11' is all missing in '12.'  Maybe you still call it a 'dream team' with Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac.  But they forgot one thing, and that's imagination.

The movie worked on a lot of different levels and though the cast including a huge list of stars, each character had just enough screen time to make the audience care for everyone involved on Danny Ocean's team.  The plot of the film was tight and the payoff for the audience was in learning how the heist was pulled off.  OCEAN'S ELEVEN was only expected to be a moderate success, but ended up doing quite well.  So well, in fact, that they quickly put together plans for a sequel.Thus came OCEAN'S TWELVE.  Beginning three years after OCEAN'S ELEVEN ended, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the casino owner the gang ripped off in the OCEAN'S ELEVEN has uncovered the identities of everyone that was involved and wants his money back plus interest,  close to $190 million.  They've got two weeks to pay up or they're all good as dead men walking.  Apparently there isn't a gig with a big enough pay off in the U.S. (or perhaps the filmmakers just wanted to spend some time in Europe) so the crew travels overseas:  Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris.  Meanwhile, the group is being hunted by an Europol agent, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is connected to Rusty's (Brad Pitt) past and they are also being out conned everywhere they go by a Frenchman known only as the ""Night Fox.""All of the members of OCEAN'S ELEVEN are back in this movie (that was one of the film's tag lines--something like ""They're back, all of them"") but unfortunately most of them have much smaller roles to play.  Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, et al are basically regulated to roles as props and set pieces.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is added as part of the cast (thus the ""twelve"" of the title) and is a nice addition, but she's the only new element added that adds any flavor to this facsimile of the first movie.  Also, instead of trying to think of something original, the general plot of the movie falls into the land of the absurd so much than when the final revelations are revealed the whole film comes off as being a disappointment and a cop-out.I was disappointed by OCEAN'S TWELVE.  It could have been a great follow-up to an excellent heist picture.  Instead Soderburgh, Clooney, and crew must have decided that they would rather have fun than focus on making a movie.  Thus, what is left is a film full of stars and fluff, but one that has no substance or style.  It has some small moments, but those are drowned out by the lack of intention and purpose.  Stay tuned for OCEAN'S THIRTEEN to see if Soderburgh and Clooney end up redeeming themselves for the failure to pull-off the coup in OCEAN'S TWELVE.",3,No New Tricks Here.,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,2736,"['OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'was', 'great', 'heist', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'original', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'film', 'included', 'more', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'movie', 'worked', 'lot', 'different', 'levels', 'cast', 'including', 'huge', 'list', 'stars', 'character', 'had', 'just', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'audience', 'care', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'team', 'plot', 'film', 'was', 'tight', 'payoff', 'audience', 'was', 'learning', 'how', 'heist', 'was', 'pulled', 'off', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'was', 'only', 'expected', 'be', 'moderate', 'success', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'quite', 'well', 'So', 'well', 'fact', 'quickly', 'put', 'together', 'plans', 'sequel.Thus', 'came', 'OCEAN', 'TWELVE', 'Beginning', 'three', 'years', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'ended', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'casino', 'owner', 'gang', 'ripped', 'off', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'uncovered', 'identities', 'everyone', 'was', 'involved', 'money', 'back', 'interest', 'close', '190', 'million', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'weeks', 'pay', 'up', ""'re"", 'good', 'dead', 'men', 'walking', 'Apparently', ""n't"", 'gig', 'big', 'enough', 'pay', 'off', 'U.S.', 'perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'wanted', 'spend', 'time', 'Europe', 'crew', 'overseas', 'Amsterdam', 'Rome', 'Paris', 'Meanwhile', 'group', 'being', 'hunted', 'Europol', 'agent', 'Isabel', 'Lahiri', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'connected', 'Rusty', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'past', 'are', 'also', 'being', 'out', 'conned', 'everywhere', 'go', 'Frenchman', 'known', 'only', 'Night', 'Fox', 'members', 'OCEAN', 'ELEVEN', 'are', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'tag', 'lines', 'something', ""'re"", 'back', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'have', 'much', 'smaller', 'roles', 'play', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'et', 'al', 'are', 'basically', 'regulated', 'roles', 'props', 'set', 'pieces', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'added', 'part', 'cast', 'thus', 'twelve', 'title', 'nice', 'addition', 'only', 'new', 'element', 'added', 'flavor', 'facsimile', 'first', 'movie', 'Also', 'instead', 'trying', 'think', 'something', 'original', 'general', 'plot', 'movie', 'land', 'absurd', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'final', 'revelations', 'are', 'revealed', 'whole', 'film', 'off', 'being', 'disappointment', 'cop-out.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'OCEAN', 'TWELVE', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'follow-up', 'excellent', 'heist', 'picture', 'Instead', 'Soderburgh', 'Clooney', 'crew', 'must', 'have', 'decided', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'fun', 'focus', 'making', 'movie', 'Thus', 'what', 'left', 'film', 'full', 'stars', 'fluff', 'one', 'substance', 'style', 'small', 'moments', 'are', 'drowned', 'out', 'lack', 'intention', 'purpose', 'Stay', 'tuned', 'OCEAN', 'THIRTEEN', 'see', 'Soderburgh', 'Clooney', 'end', 'up', 'redeeming', 'failure', 'pull-off', 'coup', 'OCEAN', 'TWELVE']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

You would think with all that star power the movie would be fairly good, but it is not. The movie seemed to try too hard to be better than the last. The film didn't portray the same magic and chemistry that was felt when these superstars got together last time. In fact it felt at times like they were faking it.In the last film the chemistry felt natural and the script flowed well through the actors abilities. In Ocean's 12 there are scenes where the chemistry seemed to be forced upon you. For instance, when the gang is plotting their first heist of the film, the scene and script forced you to remember that all of these stars are in the same room. The scene involved a lot of cutting, which is okay, but it also involved a lot of arguing and lines spoken off camera. It is rather annoying.In fact, a lot of the movie is filmed with all of Ocean's gang in the same room, talking and/or arguing instead of splitting camera time, showing each member, working on, or prepping for their part in the heist. This was an element of story telling that worked so well in the last film and it was forgotten in this film.Much of the other part of the film focuses on introducing Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, her past and how her current status as a Europol (interpol?) agent fits into the story. And while building her character is important to the plot, it takes away too much time from Ocean's gang who are supposed to be the focus of the movie. This is what people who enjoyed the last  film no doubt came back to see and were ultimately denied seeing.The plot itself is also forced. After all of Ocean and gang's meticulous planning in the first film, you would think that they would have also planned for the possibility that Terry Benedict {Andy Garcia) would want his money back and some revenge. Yet Ocean's 12 finds the gang in not so secret and others in extremely not so secret places. Benedict of course finds them with help from a secret source which if he was as evil as he was made out to be, should not have been needed. And now out of fear for their lives, Ocean and gang must pay back the money. To have this as the driving force of the movie is weak.The only good thing is the humor is still there. And there is a lot of subtle humor that some people might not pick up on. It is in these humorous scenes where some of the magic from the first film comes through.If you are a fan of the last film (I am), you will desperately want to find ways to like this film (I did).

This was a great disappointment to me, because I loved Ocean's Eleven.  Ocean's Twelve doesn't have the elegant and simple wrap-up to the plot that Eleven did - I had to watch this three times to fully understand what happened, and even now I'm not sure that I totally have it.  Twelve does not spend as much time on the characters and doesn't have the same amount of action as Eleven.  In other words, it just isn't as cool.This is not to say that Twelve doesn't have its moments.  I thought that the opening sequence of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracking down our intrepid heros was well done, particularly as it shows a bit about how each person spent their money and reacts to the news that Benedict wants it all back.  The problem is that this is the end of the character story with the exception of Catherine Zeta Jones and Brad Pitt, which is a sort-of love story.There are certainly some funny moments in the film, such as when Yen gets stuck in a bag and when Ruben asks his palm-reader why she couldn't see Benedict coming.  The end with Julia Roberts is hysterical.  Overall, the acting is excellent and the score, again, is fantastic.  The film is shot in a 70s sort of style, and the music reflects this; sadly, I think that the music is more effective than the camera angles and lighting.Regarding the DVD, there were very few special features.  This is basically the film in a couple of languages and the trailer; I suspect that something with commentary will eventually come out, but I'm not sure.If this had been the first film in the series instead of the second, I probably would not have gone to see a sequel.  That said, it's not bad, the actors are fun to watch, and you will definately have some of the music in your head once you're done watching the film.",3,"A little disappointing, not to mention confusing",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,1833,"['Ocean', 'Twelve', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'was', 'great', 'disappointment', 'loved', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', ""n't"", 'have', 'elegant', 'simple', 'wrap-up', 'plot', 'Eleven', 'did', 'had', 'watch', 'three', 'times', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'totally', 'have', 'Twelve', 'not', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'characters', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'amount', 'action', 'Eleven', 'other', 'words', 'just', ""n't"", 'cool.This', 'not', 'say', 'Twelve', ""n't"", 'have', 'moments', 'thought', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Terry', 'Benedict', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'tracking', 'down', 'intrepid', 'heros', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'particularly', 'bit', 'how', 'person', 'spent', 'money', 'news', 'Benedict', 'back', 'problem', 'end', 'character', 'story', 'exception', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'sort-of', 'love', 'are', 'certainly', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'such', 'when', 'Yen', 'stuck', 'bag', 'when', 'Ruben', 'palm-reader', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'Benedict', 'coming', 'end', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'hysterical', 'Overall', 'acting', 'excellent', 'score', 'again', 'fantastic', 'film', 'shot', '70s', 'sort', 'style', 'music', 'sadly', 'think', 'music', 'more', 'effective', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting.Regarding', 'DVD', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'basically', 'film', 'couple', 'languages', 'trailer', 'suspect', 'something', 'commentary', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure.If', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'instead', 'second', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'see', 'sequel', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'actors', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'will', 'definately', 'have', 'music', 'head', ""'re"", 'done', 'watching', 'film']",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

While this second effort lacks that suave style, it still manages to be exciting and keeps you guessing until the very end.For a basic plot summary, ""Ocean's 12"" begins with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) wanting his money back.  In order to come up with those kind of funds, the now-infamous thieving gang led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty (Brad Pitt) must take their act overseas and face off against a formidable foe in the burglary business.  This time, however, Ocean's wife (played by Julia Roberts) has a bigger role in the proceedings.The reason this film manages to still hold up under the huge success of its predecessors is two-fold:1.  The interplay between the characters is still excellent and quite funny.  It must have been a hoot to film this one, as it sure seems as if all the main players had a great time with each other.2. The plot continues to move forward and never gets predictable or stale.  It might not quite have the ""flash"" of the first one, but it still is entertaining (especially as it gears up for the climax).Overall, ""Ocean's 12"" is a solid (if less spectacular) follow-up to the glitzy original.
