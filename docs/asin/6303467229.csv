376014,A2879ZDXJVG5ZB,6303467229,"Human ""Master Critic""","[4, 10]","I was surprised to see this movie on Amazon.  The film was originally made by a small company in Utah (I think) that promotes family values and other grabage like that.  So of course, The Buttercream Gang is clean as a whistle and is pretty heavy-handed in preaching its message. But this just adds to the entertainment value!  The movie is so corny and purposeful that these elements become entertaining by themselves.Even when I was ten years old and I watched this, I realized how corny and amatuer it was.  That only made me love it more.  My brothers and I can quote this entire movie.  I bet I've seen it more than almost anyone else on the planet.  This movie practically raised my brothers and me.  We must have watched our favorite parts of it almost every day when we were younger.  Even now (I'm 24), we'll throw it on sometimes and get a big kick out of it.  Our favorite part is the baseball game.  I've always loved the Buttercreamers' treehouse.  The blossoming love story is hilarious.  They could have at least picked an attractive female for the role!  And you have to love Rev. Wilky and Mr. Graff.  Both are upstanding gentlemen and potential pedophiles, since they're always hanging out with young boys.If you have young children, be careful when showing them this movie.  The gang scenes are pretty scary.  The film includes several gang fights/muggings and even a little bit of gore/blood.  But of course, the so-called ""gangs"" only have three people in them, and they're not packing heat, or shanks, or anything else.  They prefer to brawl with their fists, but you never even see anyone throw a punch; you just see the results.  The ending is really, really bad.  The filmmamkers try to make you think that Pete got capped or wasted in Chicago, but instead, he becomes a classic do-gooder.  So why the heck was everyone acting sad?  For our (the viewers') sake?  Please.  How terrible is that.  Some of them are even crying and stuff.  It's really bad.  It doesn't make a lick of sense, except to build some phoney drama. Anyway, I could go on forever about this movie.  I gave it five stars because it has so much sentimental value, and I guess it's a good movie for kids.  I know I sure used to enjoy it.  There's also a sequel, which is much cheesier than the original.  But that's a different movie and a different review.  Enjoy it!",5,They call themselves the blades...Ha ha ha,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2362,"['was', 'surprised', 'see', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'small', 'company', 'Utah', 'think', 'family', 'values', 'other', 'grabage', 'So', 'course', 'Buttercream', 'Gang', 'clean', 'whistle', 'pretty', 'heavy-handed', 'preaching', 'message', 'just', 'entertainment', 'value', 'movie', 'so', 'corny', 'purposeful', 'elements', 'become', 'entertaining', 'themselves.Even', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'watched', 'realized', 'how', 'corny', 'amatuer', 'was', 'only', 'made', 'love', 'more', 'brothers', 'can', 'quote', 'entire', 'movie', 'bet', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'almost', 'anyone', 'else', 'planet', 'movie', 'practically', 'raised', 'brothers', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'favorite', 'parts', 'almost', 'day', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'Even', 'now', ""'m"", '24', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'sometimes', 'get', 'big', 'kick', 'favorite', 'part', 'baseball', 'game', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Buttercreamers', 'treehouse', 'blossoming', 'love', 'story', 'hilarious', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'picked', 'attractive', 'female', 'role', 'have', 'love', 'Rev', 'Wilky', 'Mr.', 'Graff', 'are', 'upstanding', 'gentlemen', 'potential', 'pedophiles', ""'re"", 'always', 'hanging', 'out', 'young', 'boys.If', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'showing', 'movie', 'gang', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'scary', 'film', 'several', 'gang', 'fights/muggings', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'gore/blood', 'course', 'so-called', 'gangs', 'only', 'have', 'three', 'people', ""'re"", 'not', 'packing', 'heat', 'shanks', 'anything', 'else', 'prefer', 'brawl', 'fists', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'anyone', 'throw', 'punch', 'just', 'see', 'results', 'ending', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'filmmamkers', 'try', 'make', 'think', 'Pete', 'got', 'capped', 'wasted', 'Chicago', 'instead', 'classic', 'do-gooder', 'why', 'heck', 'was', 'everyone', 'acting', 'sad', 'viewers', 'sake', 'Please', 'How', 'terrible', 'are', 'even', 'crying', 'stuff', 'really', 'bad', ""n't"", 'make', 'lick', 'sense', 'build', 'phoney', 'drama', 'Anyway', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'movie', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'so', 'much', 'sentimental', 'value', 'guess', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'know', 'sure', 'used', 'enjoy', 'also', 'sequel', 'much', 'cheesier', 'original', 'different', 'movie', 'different', 'review', 'Enjoy']",N/A

It is about a bunch of fat kids who eat way too much butter cream, hang out in a tree house, and wait for their spider senses to alert them that Ms. Jenkins has fallen down for the 15th time that day. No group of teenagers does that in real life.And what is so tough about Pete, the supposed ""hard one""? That he wears his hat sideways and smashes glass bottles. Perhaps this young man needs to be dropped off in Compton late at night (yes I have been there late at night) and put on his ""hard"" act. Let's wait and see how long it would take for Pete to reform his ways, and start rolling up his shorts again like the rest of the butter eaters, uh I meant creamers.And why does Old Man Winters give Pete and his goons free treats? Just do the right thing and turn them in to the authorities! Bad example for kids watching.

A bunch of kids who hang around in a tree house, doing good deeds for the fellow citizens, like Mrs. Jenkins, who is constantly falling down despite their many efforts to save her. Furthermore, they visit the local convenience store, where their good deeds are rewarded with BUTTER CREAM BARS. Do you see where I'm getting at? It's all in how you look at it. I mean, the dude who wrote and directed this film must've had a perfect childhood in some far off land where he was shielded from all contact with REAL people. REAL civilization is something that this man knew nothing about. His idea of rebellion was stealing candy and butter cream bars from a general store, as you see in the film - when the leader of the group becomes a ""rebel"" after he moves away and joins the local ""gang"", and then shortly after steals a few ""butter cream treats"" for his buddies - who all react in wide eyed horror over what he just did. You see? This movie manipulates. It is DANGEROUS. Life doesn't happen that way! We should ALL steal butter cream bars! But first of all, we need to find out one thing: where in the HECK do you find those things anyways?! I've never seen one! Do they exist?! DO THEY?! I mean, if you're going to call the movie the BUTTER CREAM GANG make sure that butter cream bars exist first. To top it all off, the director makes the young actors in the film wear these extremely short shorts and ride around on bikes. I think he had a hidden agenda there. I could be wrong.
