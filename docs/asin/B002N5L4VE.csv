1278930,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B002N5L4VE,Kasey G,"[3, 6]","Farrah Fawcett made some terrific TV movies/miniseries in her time - ""Small Sacrifices"", ""The Burning Bed"". Unfortunately, ""Hollywood Wives"" is not one of them.Even if you see this in a bargain bin like I did, and are expecting a camp-tastic, over-the-top, so-bad-it's-good hootfest like ""Lace"" or ""Valley of the Dolls 1981"", don't bother with it. You will be sadly disappointed.Despite the fact that this is a Hollywood production about Hollywood, the script is ludicrous. We are expected to believe that Farrah's character is a successful 50-something actress with a hit film in which she also performs the soundtrack herself. Can you actually name a 50-something actress who had a hit single from her own film?None of the characters in this fiasco are likeable. The male actors are all forgettable. Robin Givens and Melissa Gilbert both play self-centered, ""put-upon"" women. I actually found myself identifying with the villain more than any of the other characters. I was hoping he would do away with Fawcett's spoiled daughter.I miss Farrah. She seemed like such a fun person. When I want to remember her I will watch her as Jill Munroe, Diane Downs....anything but in this mess!This DVD is for completists who need to see everything Farrah's ever done, everyone else needs to stay far, far away.",1,"A Boring, Pathetic Attempt at a Glitzy Hollywood Sudser",1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1301,"['Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'made', 'terrific', 'TV', 'movies/miniseries', 'time', 'Small', 'Sacrifices', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'Unfortunately', 'Hollywood', 'Wives', 'not', 'one', 'them.Even', 'see', 'bargain', 'did', 'are', 'expecting', 'camp-tastic', 'over-the-top', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'hootfest', 'Lace', 'Valley', 'Dolls', '1981', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed.Despite', 'fact', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'ludicrous', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'Farrah', 'character', 'successful', '50-something', 'actress', 'hit', 'film', 'also', 'soundtrack', 'Can', 'actually', 'name', '50-something', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'hit', 'single', 'own', 'film', 'None', 'characters', 'fiasco', 'are', 'likeable', 'male', 'actors', 'are', 'forgettable', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'play', 'self-centered', 'put-upon', 'women', 'actually', 'found', 'identifying', 'villain', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'do', 'away', 'Fawcett', 'spoiled', 'daughter.I', 'miss', 'Farrah', 'seemed', 'fun', 'person', 'When', 'want', 'remember', 'will', 'watch', 'Jill', 'Munroe', 'Diane', 'Downs', '.anything', 'mess', 'DVD', 'completists', 'who', 'need', 'see', 'everything', 'Farrah', 'ever', 'done', 'everyone', 'else', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away']",N/A
1278931,AETEH7SOTOFRT,B002N5L4VE,KittyScratchesBooks,"[4, 4]","I was only able to watch this movie once and I thought that it was a terrific treat to watch three solid actresses Robin Givens, Farrah Fawcett (and this down to earth lady did not deserve to die so soon in life, I blame that Jack-ass twerp of a man ""oddly know as Ryan"") and Melissa Gilbert.It was enjoyable as far as watching the entire ensemble cast. Well worth the purchase for your movie collection. I loved how the women interacted as friends and it was a refreshing change to watch down to earth women play the roles of (in a way, themselves) but in a way that was something that --as an audience--you'd want to be part of. Imagine having a midnight massage with your best girl friend--non-sexual, but just fun and unusual. I am adding this to my wish list. This is good for those in their 40 something years, a guilty pleasure, but a welcome pleasure, particuarly being that this is Farrah's last role. This is much better than the former Hollywood WIves.The first Hollywood Wives novel is very good, but the TV version was weak. The new generation was surprisingly much better. To understand the enjoyment, you have to have been born between 1965-1970 to really appreciate these actresses working together in a Jackie Collins based novel.There were some surprising scenes in which I thought that things were not going to end well for the scene of the stalking....it was pretty disturbing and Collins does base these incidents from people that she personally knows in Hollywood which is what makes certain themes in this one , realistic, just because  of who would even think up these events if one were not inspired by what the author knew.So, with the others, I agree that this is well worth your time, if you like these actresses and their past work. The price is reasonable and I would suggest to purchase it because it is difficult to find these actress types of this quality talent in any current project of this time. Even better, I thought that I was the only one who really admired the performances regardless of what others think. It may have it's sleaze, however, I have a dear friend who lives in the heart of Hollywood and he knows everyone from damned ""snooki"" to ""Kardashian"" to Lil Kim and pretty much what Jackie Collins portrays about Hollywood ""anything"" is pretty much true, because anything TRULY goes in Hollywood and there are those who are so wealthy that their security is far better than any kind that we will ever see.

1278933,A135WQ77OCZID7,B002N5L4VE,"Perry R. Johnson ""Perry R. Johnson""","[21, 23]","Hollywood Wives: The New Generation is a sleazy story about self-centered women. It reminds you of a drug store novel. However, Farrah gives her last performance in a leading role and proves she is still sexy at 56. Also, Farrah was a damn good actress. It is wonderful that she had a good leading role before she got sick and ultimately left us. The draw backs are the younger actors. Even though they are pretty to look at, the actors just can't act. Melissa Gilbert does a good role and so does Robin Givens with Jack Scalia. Robin Givens proves she can act but her role is small compared to Farrah's and Melissa's. However, then again, I guess they are bigger stars. If you are a Farrah fan, this is a must for your collection. Farrah proves she is a sex symbol in her late fifties and women can be just as sexy as men, late in life. She will become a legend like Marilyn Monroe. In summary, the movie involves wife beating, adultery, selfishness, and kidnapping. However, this is Farrah's last starring role and a good one to remember her as being the sex symbol and actress that she was.",3,Farrah's Last Leading Performance: A Memorable Perfomance,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,1093,"['Hollywood', 'Wives', 'New', 'Generation', 'sleazy', 'story', 'self-centered', 'women', 'drug', 'store', 'novel', 'However', 'Farrah', 'last', 'performance', 'leading', 'role', 'still', 'sexy', '56', 'Also', 'Farrah', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'actress', 'wonderful', 'had', 'good', 'leading', 'role', 'got', 'sick', 'ultimately', 'left', 'draw', 'backs', 'are', 'younger', 'actors', 'Even', 'are', 'pretty', 'look', 'actors', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'good', 'role', 'so', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'Jack', 'Scalia', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'can', 'act', 'role', 'small', 'compared', 'Farrah', 'Melissa', 'However', 'then', 'again', 'guess', 'are', 'bigger', 'stars', 'are', 'Farrah', 'fan', 'must', 'collection', 'Farrah', 'sex', 'symbol', 'late', 'fifties', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'sexy', 'men', 'late', 'life', 'will', 'become', 'legend', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'summary', 'movie', 'wife', 'beating', 'adultery', 'selfishness', 'kidnapping', 'However', 'Farrah', 'last', 'starring', 'role', 'good', 'one', 'remember', 'being', 'sex', 'symbol', 'actress', 'was']",N/A
