Written and directed James Hacking, it is a predictable story with a predictable script and put together in a casual way that at least doesn't stir any feathers. Nor does it stir much genuine interest.  It seems like a paste together story for husband/wife team of Dougray Scott and Claire Forlani.Befuddled Rob Haley (Dougray Scott) was apparently a rising chef in London, put down by food critic Kate Templeton (Claire Forlani), and further distracted by the death of his wife.  In response to the need for change he moves to the country where he finds a pub-like spot in which he decides to create a caf&eacute; - a truly gourmet spot in the middle of nowhere.  He hires friends to help cook and wait tables.  He garners interest from the townsfolk for his delicious cuisine - especially his 'perfect trifle'.  His efforts do not go unnoticed - Kate Templeton visits, loves the food, and naturally falls in love with Rob...
