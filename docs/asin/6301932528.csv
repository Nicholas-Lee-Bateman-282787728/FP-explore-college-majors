Some of the antics were only mildly amusing, but there was nothing that was laugh out loud funny in the entire show. It's amazing to see these people in the crowd laugh uproariously at what you would have to force yourself to laugh at, or just snort a bit.All in all, it was fun to see Pee-Wee's Playhouse with an adult spin to it, but it wasn't at all very funny",1,Has its ups and downs.

Reubens clearly borrowed a little bit of fashion sense from a 1950s kiddie show host named Pinky Lee, who dressed in a suit that was a little too small for him and a bow tie, but the similarities quickly end there! Pee-Wee was intending to do a parody of a kids' show with this production, and he most certainly did with this staged performance recorded live at the famed Roxy Theater! His cast of characters included the brilliant Phil Hartman, Edie McClurg, John Paragon and Lynn Marie Stewart among a host of great comedic talents.The fascinating thing about this production, aside from the fact that it is completely hilarious, filled with double entendres and knowing winks to the audience, is that it really held true to the basic tenets and concepts that people had for what a children's program should do, despite mocking the concept completely! And that's likely why CBS offered him a chance to host a Saturday morning program called ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse,"" where he created an actual kid's show based on all of the characters and material offered in this clearly adult version! Of course, on ""Playhouse"" the production had to be sanitized for the kids' protection, but the roots of that are firmly entrenched in the soil of this performance!If you enjoyed the CBS program, and later ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" This is a must own!",5,Pee-Wee's Ribald Start,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,1537,"['Paul', 'Reubens', 'was', 'member', 'Groundlings', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'equivalent', 'Chicago', 'famed', 'Second', 'City', 'troupe', 'story', 'now', 'beloved', 'character', 'Pee-Wee', 'Herman', 'quite', 'interesting', 'one', 'clearly', 'borrowed', 'little', 'bit', 'fashion', 'sense', '1950s', 'kiddie', 'show', 'host', 'named', 'Pinky', 'Lee', 'who', 'dressed', 'suit', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'small', 'bow', 'tie', 'similarities', 'quickly', 'end', 'there', 'Pee-Wee', 'was', 'intending', 'do', 'parody', 'kids', 'show', 'production', 'most', 'certainly', 'did', 'staged', 'performance', 'recorded', 'live', 'famed', 'Roxy', 'Theater', 'cast', 'characters', 'included', 'brilliant', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'John', 'Paragon', 'Lynn', 'Marie', 'Stewart', 'host', 'great', 'comedic', 'talents.The', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'production', 'aside', 'fact', 'completely', 'hilarious', 'filled', 'double', 'entendres', 'knowing', 'winks', 'audience', 'really', 'held', 'true', 'basic', 'tenets', 'concepts', 'people', 'had', 'what', 'children', 'program', 'should', 'do', 'mocking', 'concept', 'completely', 'likely', 'why', 'CBS', 'offered', 'chance', 'host', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'program', 'called', 'Pee-Wee', 'Playhouse', 'where', 'created', 'actual', 'kid', 'show', 'based', 'characters', 'material', 'offered', 'clearly', 'adult', 'version', 'course', 'Playhouse', 'production', 'had', 'be', 'sanitized', 'kids', 'protection', 'roots', 'are', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'soil', 'performance', 'enjoyed', 'CBS', 'program', 'later', 'Pee-Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'must', 'own']",N/A

273404,A1G1PX4U6RSZEA,6301932528,Jeremy P,"[54, 56]","The Pee-Wee Herman Show was a successful performance which catapulted Paul Reuben's career beyond his own imagination.  The performance was held in front of a live audience at the Roxy in La for around 5 months.  Luckily HBO brilliantly caught one of these live performances and gave people the opportunity to see Pee-Wee Herman.  Pee-Wee Herman along with an ensemble cast of notables produced a hilarious performance that had me laughing from start to finish.  Let us not ignore the actual set design for the show as well as Jambi the Genie.  The show put Pee-Wee on the map of stardom due to his creativity and ingenious ways of entertaining his fans.  The show immediately starts with Pee-Wee Herman digging through a bag of toys pulling out one thing after another, and stumbles upon ""NAKED GUMBY AHH"".  Another funny idea was the Mr. Bungle skit.  The Mr. Bungle skit was an actual 1950's dramatization on exhibiting manners.  The funny part of this whole skit is they actually showed this to little girls and boys back in the 1950's.  One scene shows the boy getting served hot food and next to the hot food the cafeteria person places a big piece of cake on the tray.  By the end of the skit Pee-Wee says something like ""is that piece of cake big enough for ya!?"" then does his Pee-Wee laugh.  Classic.  I think the real interesting phenomenon of Pee-Wee Herman was he could entertain both adults and children.  Understandably this led to his hit Saturday Morning cartoon show ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"" which had several emmy nominations throughout the late 80's and early 90's.  Furthermore Pee-Wee teamed up with Tim Burton to mesh together a film called ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"".
