It was filmed in and around Cardiff, Wales - mostly at night, or supposedly so, which makes the grey levels of the movie so effective. Sir John Mills' daughter was selected to play the lead character almost as an afterthought. This opportunity helped launch Hayley Mills' film career when Walt Disney saw her performance. The bonus audio commentary track (with Hayley Mills) is also well worth hearing. This bygone-era snapshot of the working class Cardiff docks neighborhood shows a very true to life picture of a hard, gritty existence and it makes for a good, suspenseful movie.",5,Hayley Mills' introduction,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,641,"['late', '50s', 'British', 'Black-and-White', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'was', 'filmed', 'Cardiff', 'Wales', 'mostly', 'night', 'supposedly', 'so', 'grey', 'levels', 'movie', 'so', 'effective', 'Sir', 'John', 'Mills', 'daughter', 'was', 'selected', 'play', 'lead', 'character', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'opportunity', 'helped', 'launch', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'film', 'career', 'when', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'saw', 'performance', 'bonus', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'also', 'well', 'worth', 'hearing', 'bygone-era', 'snapshot', 'working', 'class', 'Cardiff', 'neighborhood', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'picture', 'hard', 'gritty', 'existence', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'movie']",N/A
241617,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6300988872,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 3]","For a movie that starts with a murder fueled by rage and ends with a dangerous decision to be made in rough seas, Tiger Bay is one of the most touching and endearing studies of childhood and friendship you could hope to see. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed.When a young Polish seaman named Korchinsky (Horst Buchholz) returns to his home port in Wales after a long spell at sea, he is the happiest man alive. He has some money in his pocket and a good-looking girlfriend. He can hardly wait to arrive at her apartment flat, which he has been paying the rent on. But he meets someone else living there. When he finally locates his girl, he finds she's been seeing someone else, a man she thinks has ""class."" It's the old story. She begins screaming at him. He loses his temper and screams back. She pulls a gun from a dresser drawer and orders him out of her apartment and out of her life. In a mater of seconds he's wrestled the gun away from her and she's lying dead on the floor of multiple bullet wounds. And while this has been going on, ten-year-old Gillie (Hayley Mills) has been crouched down and staring at what she could see through the mail slot in the door. Gillie is bright and quick. She lives with her aunt down the hall. She's good at making up stories, not lies, exactly, but close enough. Her friends won't play cops and robbers with her because she doesn't have a toy gun. She loves to imagine adventures. Korchinsky hears the police arriving. He hides the gun and then hides himself. As soon as he disappears, Gillie nips in and takes the gun from where she saw Korchinsky hide it. But now Korchinsky spots her.For the rest of the movie we follow Gillie as she avoids Korchinsky, as she shows off the gun to a friend during choir, and as Detective Superintendent Graham (John Mills) questions Gillie and the neighbors to try to make sense of the murder. It doesn't take long for Korchinsky to abduct Gillie with a tale of escaping on an adventure to another country. He knows she is the only one who can identify him. Gillie, her head full of excitement, is no dummy, but she longs for what she imagines. Korchinsky, in fact, turns out to be a young man over his head, almost as young in some ways as Gillie. He begins to see Gillie as the same kind of uncomplicated dreamer in some ways he is. While he convinces Gillie not to give him away, he leaves her for a few hours so he can sign on to a ship soon to sail for Caracas. When Gillie is found alone and waiting for Korchinsky to return, Superintendent Graham must try to convince Gillie that Korchinsky is dangerous and that she must corporate to capture him. Gillie, despite the best efforts of Graham, will not betray her friend. The cat and mouse struggle between Graham and Gillie is one of the most amusing situations in the movie.The climax is on the freighter bound for Caracas just outside the three mile zone off the coast of Wales. The inspector has arrived on a pilot boat with Gillie to identify Korchinsky. He is determined to bring Korchinsky in. Just when it looks like Korchinsky will be safe, Gillie falls overboard in the high seas. The only one who sees her fall is Korchinsky. If he lets her die unseen, he will remain on the ship and be safe as it heads away from Britain. If he dives in to try to save Gillie, he will be picked up by the pilot boat, even if he saves her, and returned to Wales, sooner or later to be tried for murder. It's his choice and he has only seconds to decide.This was Hayley Mills first movie. She was 13 and she is extraordinary. Buchholz and Mills (her father) do fine jobs, but the movie fails or succeeds on whether or not the person of Gillie captures us. We not only have to identify with Gillie, we have to believe in her. Mills makes Gillie a person we root for, a person we understand why she won't turn in her friend even after she realizes he won't be taking her anywhere. Mills does all this with straightforward and unaffected charm, and without a speck of sentimentality.But nothing is perfect in this world, and Tiger Bay is cursed with one of the most awful screen scores I've ever heard. It's not only loud, it's cloyingly sentimental with tons of lush strings. Worse, it punctuates every tense scene with cliche-ridden horn stings and drum beats. The score does a disservice to the movie. The DVD transfer is first rate. The movie is in black and white, and the docks and Gillie's gritty working class neighborhood look just as tough as they probably were. With the exception of the score, the movie is the work of skilled craftsmen who knew how tell a story.

Slipman,"[12, 13]","Hayley Mills, in her screen debut, stars as lonely, mischievous 11 year old outcast tomboy Gillie in the sensitive and gritty drama ""Tiger Bay"".  Mills, a recent inhabitant in her aunt's flat in a squalid harborside Cardiff, Wales neighborhood, is shunned from play by the local kids for lack of a cap pistol.  In a chance encounter she meets Polish sailor Korchinsky played by a handsome Horst Buchholz.  He had just disembarked from the freighter he had been working on and was looking for his girlfriend Anya, who had moved to a new apartment.  Gillie was to be his guide there as this was where she also lived.As Buchholz entered the apartment, he realized that something was amiss.  His girl Anya, played by Yvonne Mitchell had dumped him for a more gentlemanly beau.  In an angry spew she cut him to the quick and threatened him with a gun.  Buchholz wrested the pistol from her and in a murderous jealous rage shot her dead.  Little did he know that Gillie was observing the entire encounter by peering through the letterbox after she heard noises while loitering on the staircase nearby.The shots soon brought police and Buchholz fled hiding the gun he used near to where Mills was hiding to evade the fleeing Buchholz. Mills seeing the gun, grabbed it now having the key to entrance to the games the local kids were playing.  Unfortunately Buchholz saw her take and seeing him she ran away from him with the gun.Buchholz realizing that the young girl could implicate him started searching for her. After finding her, he gently detained her promising her stowage aboard his ship.  These two lonesome outcasts soon forged a friendship but eventually became separated.  Mills still in hiding was finally found by authorities as kidnapping had been feared.Loyal to her friendship with Buchholz, Mills was reluctant to betray him when questioned by police superintendant Graham, played by her father Sir John Mills.  Gillie's reluctance allowed Buchholz time to try to escape by signing onto another ship soon departing.  The drama played out with Gillie steadfast in her silence and the inspector trying to wring the truth out of her.""Tiger Bay"" was an underrated drama, filmed beautifully in black and white in the seedy environs of Cardiff dockside.  The acting performances by all the starring cast was top notch.  The relationship between Buchholz and Mills was poignantly depicted.

Two would make 'Black Hawk Down' look like a CND march. She's the radioactive little scamp of whom Mohammed Ali allegedly whimpered ""blimey, I'm off to the rumble in the jungle"".In this movie our Haze demolishes half of Wales in the pursuit of true lurve. Bullets cannot faze her. Cars bounce off her. Murderers melt before her gaze. Arnold Swarzenegger pleads a prior engagement. Stephen Seagal...well, we won't bother about him. Actually, Wales is already quite dangerous before four foot nothing of Hayley goes into action. She is a witness to a murder so the police want her to help them with their enquiries. But first they have to catch her. There are no SWAT teams in Wales so they are immediately in trouble. Next to her, Richard Kimble has rickets. It takes 15 officers and a bus to stop her. They should have sent an armoured truck. Resistance is futile.The murderer is played by Horst Bucholz, the only member of 'The Magnificent Seven' people can't remember in pub quizes. The police discover that Bucholz has gone to board a ship and escape Britain, so they chase to the docks. The whole universe loves Hayley and throws various impediments in the way of the car but to no avail. Once on board the ship, the chief inspector, played by real life father John Mills, wants our Haze to identify the culprit and gives her a very stern lecture on the importance of honesty and morality. Being a modern Miss, our Haze quickly comes to the conclusion as to what really matters in life...Looks! Give Mr Bucholz a recording contract. Preferably Ricky Martin's. She won't give up the bad guy who is forced to reveal himself when she rather expediently falls over board. They are both rescued. He hugs her. She weeps. He hugs her some more. Oh, how I hate him.

Really classy film with great acting, and of course the screen debut of Hayley Mills.I have the Region 1 version of this film which is pan and scan, but this Region 2 version from England is far superior in that it is in the correct screen aspect ratio, and the transfer is far better than the one for American/Canadian buyers.  It also has extras: being Hayley Mills doing the audio commentary, which is a lot of fun to listen to.  But one needs to have the correct compact disc player (if you are American or Canadian) to play other region DVD's.

241628,A4JHEO7H330AF,6300988872,Tom Brody,"[2, 2]","TIGER BAY is a black and white movie, starring America's former heart-throb, Hayley Mills. To provide some perspective, Shirley Temple was an earlier heart-throb, while Meg Ryan and Reese Witherspoon were subsequent heart-throbs.  Most of the film takes place at a seaside city in Wales, and the viewer is occasionally treated to the distant sounds of horns emanating from cargo ships.  In a nutshell, Hayley Mills witnesses a murder while looking through the mailslot in a tenement apartment.  She is pursued by the murderer, who is a handsome young merchant marine.  They quickly become close friends, where Hayley's motivation stems from her lack of any father figure.  Eventually, both of them escape on a cargo ship, the POLOMA CARACAS.  The viewer is treated to great cinematography, bringing to mind the gritty black and white photography of Helen Levitt, who photographed street urchins amidst tenement buildings in New York City.  The film is 1 hour and 42 minutes long.THE TOM-BOY.  The initial scenes are of a shipyard in Cardiff, a city in Wales.  We see lower class tenement buildings.  The protagonist is played by HORST BUCHHOLZ, a handsome man.  He plays a Polish seaman, who left his Polish girlfriend behind at their apartment in Cardiff.  We see Horst coming ashore, and he is presented as a likeable character.  He strides through his neighborhood, expecting to find his Polish girlfriend (Anya) at their apartment.  He toussels the hair of an Anglo-African boy, and helps another Anglo-African child on his swing.  At 7 minutes, Hayley Mills makes her entrance.  She is playing with some boys, and she establishes herself as a tom-boy.  She sticks out her leg and trips one of the boys.  She gets into a fist fight with the boys, and exclaims, ""I'm not a lady!""  She likes playing with firecrackers, which her auntie calls ""bombs.""FINDING ANYA.  Horst discovers that the girlfriend (Anya) had moved away from their apartment.  But at the ten minute point in this fast-moving film, he succeeds in finding her in another apartment building.  He embraces her, and speaks lovingly in Polish.  But Anya rejects him.  Horst spots evidence of another man, in Anya's dingy apartment, such as a small table with two plates and two sets of silverware.  Horst promises to quit his job at sea, and to find a land-based job.  But Anya complains that Horst will always love the sea more than her, and she complains that he will always return to sea for a job on a ship.THE AUNTIE.  At 12 minutes into the movie, there is a little scene of Hayley and her auntie, a laundry-lady.  She greets Hayley with, ""You're late you bad girl, where have you been?""  (Hayley had been on a shopping errand.)  ""Put the change on the table,"" she tells Hayley. ""There wasn't no change,"" Haley replies.  ""Sausages, my girl, are nine and a half.  I gave you two and six.  Now what did you do with the nine,"" demands the auntie.  ""I dropped it, it wasn't my fault,"" replies Haley, which is the first of her many lies that are told in this movie.  ""All my life is spent struggling to skrimp together a few pennies to bring you up decent, and this is how you repay me.  A thief at your age . . . little girls wanting to play with guns and bombs and dressing up like gangsters,"" complains the auntie.  Hayley's job is to deliver the auntie's laundry to customers, and to collect the fee.  She brings the freshly ironed pants to the customer (Mr. Williams).  When Mrs. Williams opens the door, Hayley hides to the side of the door, and then jumps out, and gives Mrs. Williams a scare.  ""It's two bob,"" announces Hayley, requesting payment for the ironed pants.  ""WHERE'S YOUR MANNERS, DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL YOU TO SAY PLEASE,"" angrily asks Mrs. Williams.  Then, Mrs. Williams requests permission to pay the money a week late.  Hayley replies, ""Okay,"" and Mrs. Williams turns to enter her apartment.  But immediately, Hayley exclaims, ""NO ONE EVER TELL YOU TO SAY THANK YOU?""  To add to her mischief, Hayley immediately sets off a firecracker, causing Mr. Williams to cut himself while shaving.  ""Cut yourself bad!!!"" teases Hayley, taunting the man who stand before his shaving mirror, bleeding.LOVER'S SPAT.  Then, in the same apartment building, Haley witnesses an escalating lover's spat between Horst and Anya.  The cinematography provides periodic close-ups of Hayley's eyes, as they peek through the mail slot.  She sees Horst strike Anya, and she sees Horst kill Anya with a gun.  Horst realizes that Hayley had seen the murder, and he goes after her, and she hides in a closet.  In the closet, Hayley finds the gun, and she tucks the gun into her apartment, and she escapes from Horst and returns to her auntie.HAYLEY-THE-LIAR.  At 20 minutes in this brisk-moving film, the landlady discovers Anya's dead body.  As part of the police inquiry, the police interrogate the auntie and also Hayley.  Hayley pretends that she knows nothing, and just states that the suspect is fat, is tall, dresses ordinarily, and has fair skin.  The auntie insist that the police leave, because Hayley is scheduled to sing in the church choir.MORE CAT-AND-MOUSE IN THE CHURCH.  And so, Hayley rushes off to the church, quickly dons her white gown, and joins the choir to sing.  She brings along the gun, and shows it to a choir boy next to her.  In one hand, she displays a bullet.  During her singing solo, Hayley notices that the murderer is in the audience in the church.  The event is actually a wedding ceremony for an Anglo-African couple, and other people in the audience seated in the pews are also Anglo-Africans.  During the solo, Hayley breaks off, because she is shocked by the sight of the murderer.  After the ceremony, Hayley dashes up to the attic of the church to hide.  The murder follows her, and grabs Hayley, and takes away the gun.  But the murderer has a change of heart.  He falls to his knees, and starts praying.  He calmly explains to Hayley why he killed Anya (""because she said she doesn't want me any more"").  Hayley agrees to join the murderer on a cargo ship, because she wants to be employed on a cargo ship.  (I told you that the plot moves along rapidly.)THE MOTLEY PAIR.  In the next scene, the police interrogate the choir boy who has the bullet.  The boy's mother had discovered the bullet in the boy's pocket.  The boy tells the police that Hayley has the gun.  (The purpose of this part of the plot, is to depict the fact that several confusing clues are disclosed to the police.)  The murderer enters a tavern, with the goal of viewing a schedule of cargo ships.  In the bar, the radio announces the fact that Haley is missing, and that she is armed with a gun.  The murderer dashes out of the tavern, and is re-united with Hayley, who had agreed to wait outside the bar while he was making his inquiry about the cargo ship schedule.  The fact that Hayley is also a ""wanted person"" makes the plot more dangerous, because now the police are after the murderer (they still have no idea what he looks like) and because the police are also after Hayley.  At this point, it is evident that the storyline has taken an improbable turn.  The plot is now like a Mark Twain story, where a child befriends an escapee.  Haley and the murderer spend the night in a broken-down house, in the nearby countryside.  The pair tell happy stories to each other.  Hayley rides a white pony, with the murderer walking at her side.  (The viewer has no choice but to subject himself to this improbable plot twist, aside from switching off the movie.)MORE SLEUTHING.  The police inquire at the apartment formerly occupied by Anya, now occupied by a different woman (Christine).  This woman hands over a cloth bag containing the murderer's belongings, which contains evidence in the form of a photograph of the murderer standing next to Anya.  At the time that the police drop by Christine's apartment, it was by coincidence the case that the murderer was also at Christine's apartment, because he wanted to retrieve his cloth bag.  Christine lets him hid behind a curtain, and he escapes.  Meanwhile, the newspapers have a headline showing Hayley's photograph, proclaiming that she is a runaway who needs to be captured.  There is a manhunt, and in short order, Hayley is captured.  The police determined that she had not been telling the truth, regarding her earlier pretense of not knowing the physical appearance of the murderer.  This further establishes Hayley as a pathological liar.THE POLOMA CARACAS.  Meanwhile, there is a brief scene were the murderer bribes his way onto passage on the ship, Poloma Caracas, where he is to find employment as a seaman.THE WRONG SUSPECT.  At one hour and 14 minutes into the movie, there is a police lineup, where one of the men in the lineup is the primary suspect.  The primary suspect is a boyfriend of Anya, who happens to be an older married British man.  Hayley is forced to review all of the men in the lineup.  She points out that the older British man is the person she saw at Anya's apartment, and she implicates him as the murderer.  But the police are able to determine that Hayley is a liar.  In recounting what she saw through the mail slot, she states that the couple were Polish and were speaking Polish with each other.  This enables the police to establish that their primary suspect (the older British man) is not a suspect at all (because he is not Polish).  Meanwhile, the Poloma Caracas is about a mile out to sea, and is headed to the 3-mile boundary that will enable the murderer to be free of British control.THE CHASE.  The police realize that the true murderer is the seaman, and they jump into their police car, and zoom to the docks, with Hayley in tow.  The police car is momentarily blocked on a narrow road, by a clunky-looking steam roller.  Hayley is in the back seat, and she smiles broadly because the police car is blocked, thereby increasing the probability that the murderer will make good his escape.  At any rate, the police with Hayley jump into a small boat, and catch up with the Poloma Caracas, climb aboard, and directly confront the murderer.  Hayley repeatedly insists that she never saw the murderer, even though the murderer stands directly in front of her (the murderer tries very hard to remain calm, but he is shown clenching his fists).SURPRISE ENDING.  Don't worry, I will NOT give away the surprise ending.  The last few minutes of the movie contain a few surprising about-faces.  There is a clever surprise ending.  Despite the cleverness of the last few minutes, the ending is somewhat forced, improbable, and not really satisfying.  But the fact that the last minute of this fine movie is improbable, should not stop Amazon.com customers from enjoying this rapid-paced, finely-acted adventure.  As I mentioned before, the cinematography is extremely good, and at least as good as that as in any Alfred Hitchcock movie.  What I have in mind, is Alfred Hitchcock's black and white classic murder mystery, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.",5,"Fast moving plot, excellent acting, beautiful cinematography",1386979200,"12 14,
