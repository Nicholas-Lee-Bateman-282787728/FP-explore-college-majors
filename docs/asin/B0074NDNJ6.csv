IT appears to be predictable and annoying at times while following the story line. It started out slow and just could not pick up enough speed for me. I compare it to a bad version of American Psycho but even AP had more action than this dud. It seems that the writer ran out of ideas and the creative juices just stopped flowing. If you must see it rent it first.,2,Slow burn,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,444,"['need', 'movie', 'put', 'sleep', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'watching', 'IT', 'be', 'predictable', 'annoying', 'times', 'following', 'story', 'line', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'enough', 'speed', 'compare', 'bad', 'version', 'American', 'Psycho', 'even', 'AP', 'had', 'more', 'action', 'dud', 'writer', 'ran', 'ideas', 'creative', 'juices', 'just', 'stopped', 'flowing', 'must', 'see', 'rent', 'first']",American Translation

1526397,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B0074NDNJ6,Rick L. Parrish,"[5, 6]","Not your average cup of tea here in Amerioa.  This French film has more in common with American Psycho than Psycho if you're going for a literal American Translation.  The young stars are mesmerizing and totally beautiful eye candy in the process.  Be warned the French have no problem with full frontal nudity and in the case of Pierre Perrier's lap dance sequence (seducing and dominating yet vaguely submitting to his girlfriend in one of the movies most erotic and disturbing scenes)indicates they have no problem with full male arousal as well.  The movie is hard to peg but suffice it to say the girl falls for the boy who also likes guys and (as a little kicker that would destroy most relationships) unlike his hetero bent...he prefers to kill his male hustler tricks in the bargain.  It's a road trip movie as only the French could imagine it and certainly it is full of meanings and shifting shadows that you garner at your own level of maturity and insight.  It's the modern equivalent of the movies Alain Delon and Gerard Depardieu did in the sixties and eighties respectively stretching the envelope of French Cinema (and world cinema for that matter).  I am not familiar with this Director's work (Pascal Arnold in collaboration with Jean-Marc Barr, cinematographer and editor) but am highly intrigued now by this dark blooded take on love and sex and modern morality of serial killers in pursuit of themselves and escaping themselves (and remarkably with zero blood or gore on screen).  Perrier is certainly an actor to take note of in his male/female nubile and nebulous embodiment of the wounded loner ready to take a mate and to share his psychic wasteland (and the actor's willingness to do just that). He hits his notes perfectly and interprets the music he is playing masterfully for such a young man.  His eyes hold you like no other I've seen in years on the screen and you can almost (but not quite) understand the girl's almost Svengali attachment. The girl is played by Lizzie Brochere (playing the American) who certainly holds her own both as eye candy and against Perrier's performance and by balancing her character's subjectivity allows him to achieve his performance while defining her own aggressive passivity and is not redundant(again a remarkable acting achievement for one so young).  It speaks to modern society's detachment on the human level.  This is subjective art of the first order...so for me to try to explain it to you further would be an exercise in my own vanity.  It would be a greater sin to give away more of the plot or the ending. The movie was so controversial abroad that there is a Directors' comment included on the disk. See it yourself and judge if you like or dislike where the envelope bursts in on your own particular sense of self and loss.  I did not find it to be disjointed or incoherent as others have said, in fact just the opposite and I came away profoundly disturbed by my ability to connect with both these characters.  French Cinema at its best speaks to the human condition and this one succeeds magnificently on a visceral level.",5,The French Are Famous For Their Wine...And This Is New Wine.,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,3105,"['Not', 'average', 'cup', 'tea', 'here', 'Amerioa', 'French', 'film', 'more', 'common', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Psycho', ""'re"", 'going', 'literal', 'American', 'Translation', 'young', 'stars', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'totally', 'beautiful', 'eye', 'candy', 'process', 'Be', 'warned', 'French', 'have', 'problem', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'case', 'Pierre', 'Perrier', 'lap', 'dance', 'sequence', 'seducing', 'dominating', 'yet', 'vaguely', 'submitting', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'movies', 'most', 'erotic', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'have', 'problem', 'full', 'male', 'arousal', 'well', 'movie', 'hard', 'peg', 'suffice', 'say', 'girl', 'boy', 'who', 'also', 'guys', 'little', 'kicker', 'would', 'destroy', 'most', 'relationships', 'hetero', 'bent', 'kill', 'male', 'hustler', 'tricks', 'bargain', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'only', 'French', 'could', 'imagine', 'certainly', 'full', 'meanings', 'shifting', 'shadows', 'garner', 'own', 'level', 'maturity', 'insight', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'movies', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'did', 'sixties', 'eighties', 'respectively', 'stretching', 'envelope', 'French', 'Cinema', 'world', 'cinema', 'matter', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'Director', 'work', 'Pascal', 'Arnold', 'collaboration', 'Jean-Marc', 'Barr', 'cinematographer', 'editor', 'am', 'highly', 'intrigued', 'now', 'dark', 'blooded', 'take', 'love', 'sex', 'modern', 'morality', 'serial', 'killers', 'pursuit', 'escaping', 'remarkably', 'zero', 'blood', 'gore', 'screen', 'Perrier', 'certainly', 'actor', 'take', 'note', 'male/female', 'nubile', 'nebulous', 'embodiment', 'wounded', 'loner', 'ready', 'take', 'mate', 'share', 'psychic', 'wasteland', 'actor', 'willingness', 'do', 'just', 'notes', 'perfectly', 'music', 'playing', 'masterfully', 'such', 'young', 'man', 'eyes', 'hold', 'other', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'screen', 'can', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'understand', 'girl', 'almost', 'Svengali', 'attachment', 'girl', 'played', 'Lizzie', 'Brochere', 'playing', 'American', 'who', 'certainly', 'own', 'eye', 'candy', 'Perrier', 'performance', 'balancing', 'character', 'subjectivity', 'achieve', 'performance', 'defining', 'own', 'aggressive', 'passivity', 'not', 'redundant', 'again', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'achievement', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'modern', 'society', 'detachment', 'human', 'level', 'subjective', 'art', 'first', 'order', 'so', 'try', 'explain', 'further', 'would', 'be', 'exercise', 'own', 'vanity', 'would', 'be', 'greater', 'sin', 'give', 'away', 'more', 'plot', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'controversial', 'abroad', 'Directors', 'comment', 'included', 'disk', 'See', 'judge', 'like', 'dislike', 'where', 'envelope', 'own', 'particular', 'sense', 'self', 'loss', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'disjointed', 'incoherent', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'fact', 'just', 'opposite', 'came', 'away', 'profoundly', 'disturbed', 'ability', 'connect', 'characters', 'French', 'Cinema', 'best', 'speaks', 'human', 'condition', 'one', 'magnificently', 'visceral', 'level']",American Translation

He leads an unconventional life in that he lives in a rubbish Puegeot van and makes money by playing poker. As he says, he is just lucky and as luck would have it he bumps into Lizzie Brouchere who plays Aurore. She is a Daddy's girl, half American, half French and half stupid, as she falls for this Romeo at the drop of a hat or as it turns out a drop of her knickers. Any way it isn't just a one night thing for either of them as the following day he whisks her off to a life of free living and free loving.The only catch is they have to go in his van, and he also has a thing for men. When I say a thing I don't mean his trouser snake, no he sort of wants to seduce young men and then sort of kill them. Well for most this could be a big `elephant in the room' moment when she finds out, but in true lover's style, they decide they can work something out.So not an average tale and not an average production, as the production values are really good; there is an underlying air of tension through out and there is lots of `getting it on' right from the start. The acting of the two leads is both assured and accomplished; the soundtrack is pretty good too.To say any more might spoil the plot, but really so much does happen and there are subtle twists that keep the atmosphere of brooding dread ramped up right until the conclusion. I was pretty much hooked from the beginning. It is in French with some `American' as Chris calls it and the sub titles are all pretty good, with a ninety minute run, this is another really good independent French film so if that is your `le sac' then you should enjoy",4,French Road Movie With A Raving Nutter!,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1671,"['Pierre', 'Perrier', 'Chris', 'hot', 'unconventional', 'life', 'rubbish', 'Puegeot', 'van', 'money', 'playing', 'poker', 'just', 'lucky', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Lizzie', 'Brouchere', 'who', 'Aurore', 'Daddy', 'girl', 'half', 'American', 'half', 'French', 'half', 'stupid', 'Romeo', 'drop', 'hat', 'out', 'drop', 'knickers', 'way', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'night', 'thing', 'following', 'day', 'off', 'life', 'free', 'living', 'free', 'loving.The', 'only', 'catch', 'have', 'go', 'van', 'also', 'thing', 'men', 'When', 'say', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'trouser', 'snake', 'sort', 'seduce', 'young', 'men', 'then', 'sort', 'kill', 'Well', 'most', 'could', 'be', 'big', 'elephant', 'room', 'moment', 'when', 'out', 'true', 'lover', 'style', 'decide', 'can', 'work', 'something', 'not', 'average', 'tale', 'not', 'average', 'production', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'underlying', 'air', 'tension', 'out', 'lots', 'getting', 'right', 'start', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'assured', 'accomplished', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'good', 'too.To', 'say', 'more', 'might', 'spoil', 'plot', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'happen', 'are', 'subtle', 'twists', 'keep', 'atmosphere', 'brooding', 'dread', 'ramped', 'up', 'right', 'conclusion', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'hooked', 'beginning', 'French', 'American', 'Chris', 'sub', 'titles', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'ninety', 'minute', 'run', 'really', 'good', 'independent', 'French', 'film', 'so', 'le', 'sac', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy']",American Translation
