I don't understand how Jim Breuer isn't more popular, he should be one of the top stand up performers, he's definitely a lot funnier than many of them! Buy this special you won't be let down.",5,Jim Breuer Is Hilarious!!!,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,333,"['great', 'stand', 'up', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Breuer', 'personal', 'favorite', 'bit', 'one', 'AC/DC', 'always', 'crack', 'up', 'hysterically', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'Jim', 'Breuer', ""n't"", 'more', 'popular', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'top', 'stand', 'performers', 'definitely', 'lot', 'funnier', 'many', 'Buy', 'special', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'let', 'down']",Jim Breuer: Hardcore

Thing is something was left out. Remember in the comedy central version where he quotes Metallica? Well for some reason it's not in the dvd which kinda makes me mad, but I laugh every time I watch it.",5,Very funny,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,387,"['Ok', 'saw', 'comedy', 'central', 'thousand', 'times', 'so', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'buy', 'dvd', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'commericals', 'end', 'get', 'next', 'joke', 'Thing', 'something', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Remember', 'comedy', 'central', 'version', 'where', 'Metallica', 'Well', 'reason', 'not', 'dvd', 'kinda', 'mad', 'laugh', 'time', 'watch']",Jim Breuer: Hardcore
718916,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00006JU6T,Michael Crane,"[10, 10]","Anytime you see stand-up comedian Jim Breuer take the stage, you know it's going to be a good time.  It's not just a regular night of stand-up, it's a all-out crazy party!  Jim Breuer takes no prisoners in this Comedy Central Special, ""Jim Breuer: Hardcore.""You almost get exhausted by just watching him run around the stage like a madman.  There is hardly a second that goes by where you're not laughing hysterically.  In this special, Breuer talks about music, drugs, growing up, being a father, being married, and more.  There's also a band that Jim travels around with when he performs, which really separates this comedy special from the rest.The DVD has a few special features, such as never-aired performance segments and two segments from Jim's first Comedy Central performance.  It's not a lot, but for a comedy special DVD, those are some really cool extras.The only major drawback is the breaks in where the commercials would usually separate the show if you were watching it on cable.  It kind of ruins the flow at times.  You would really be getting into it all and then all of the sudden there's a little segment break that was intended for commercials.  And there's A LOT of those breaks, so be warned.  Still, it doesn't ruin the overall experience.If you love comedy that's insane, different, unpredictable, and ""drop-to-the-ground"" funny, then Jim Breuer is your guy.  ""Jim Breuer: Hardcore"" is a must-have for all comedy fans.  A very high replay value on this one.  Check it out as soon as you can.",5,Comedy Gold,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,1518,"['Anytime', 'see', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'Jim', 'Breuer', 'take', 'stage', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'regular', 'night', 'stand-up', 'all-out', 'crazy', 'party', 'Jim', 'Breuer', 'prisoners', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Special', 'Jim', 'Breuer', 'Hardcore', 'almost', 'get', 'exhausted', 'just', 'watching', 'run', 'stage', 'madman', 'hardly', 'second', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'special', 'Breuer', 'talks', 'music', 'drugs', 'growing', 'up', 'being', 'father', 'being', 'married', 'more', 'also', 'band', 'Jim', 'around', 'when', 'really', 'comedy', 'special', 'rest.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'never-aired', 'performance', 'segments', 'two', 'segments', 'Jim', 'first', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'performance', 'not', 'lot', 'comedy', 'special', 'DVD', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'extras.The', 'only', 'major', 'drawback', 'breaks', 'where', 'commercials', 'would', 'usually', 'separate', 'show', 'were', 'watching', 'cable', 'kind', 'flow', 'times', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'getting', 'then', 'sudden', 'little', 'segment', 'break', 'was', 'intended', 'commercials', 'LOT', 'breaks', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'Still', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'overall', 'experience.If', 'love', 'comedy', 'insane', 'different', 'unpredictable', 'drop-to-the-ground', 'funny', 'then', 'Jim', 'Breuer', 'guy', 'Jim', 'Breuer', 'Hardcore', 'must-have', 'comedy', 'fans', 'very', 'high', 'replay', 'value', 'one', 'Check', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'can']",Jim Breuer: Hardcore
718917,A21I83YY8UA97L,B00006JU6T,Modern Fix,"[2, 2]","If you have cable, you probably have seen most of this on Comedy Central. For those cable-challenged, Jim Bruer is most visible from his stint on Saturday Night Live (yeah, he was ""goatboy""). He was also stoner ""Brian"" in the movie Half Baked. Here is his standup (with a heavy metal band backup, thus the ""hardcore""). He works the band in whenever he ends a good joke by breaking into some basic AC/DC cloned metal riff. Yeah, I don't get it either, but Bruer is generally funny. He's only got about three basic voices that are spun into whichever character he's trying to bring forth (which accentuate the core of any of his routines), but does so with conviction and keeps the crowd laughing. Much of his humor is embellished stories from Breur's youth, giving him the fan connection of, `Yeah, I probably partied with that guy in highschool'. A couple of added scenes deleted from the Comedy Central special are some bonus laughs. And if you are really into Jim Bruer, you'll dig the extra footage of his first Comedy Central appearances where you might recognize earlier, less polished versions of his later material.",4,Generally funny,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,1122,"['have', 'cable', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'cable-challenged', 'Jim', 'Bruer', 'most', 'visible', 'stint', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'yeah', 'was', 'goatboy', 'was', 'also', 'stoner', 'Brian', 'movie', 'Half', 'Baked', 'Here', 'standup', 'heavy', 'metal', 'band', 'backup', 'thus', 'hardcore', 'band', 'whenever', 'good', 'joke', 'breaking', 'basic', 'AC/DC', 'cloned', 'metal', 'riff', 'Yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'either', 'Bruer', 'generally', 'funny', 'only', 'got', 'three', 'basic', 'voices', 'are', 'spun', 'whichever', 'character', 'trying', 'bring', 'forth', 'accentuate', 'core', 'routines', 'so', 'conviction', 'crowd', 'laughing', 'Much', 'humor', 'embellished', 'stories', 'Breur', 'youth', 'giving', 'fan', 'connection', 'Yeah', 'probably', 'partied', 'guy', 'highschool', 'couple', 'added', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'special', 'are', 'bonus', 'are', 'really', 'Jim', 'Bruer', ""'ll"", 'dig', 'extra', 'footage', 'first', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'appearances', 'where', 'might', 'recognize', 'earlier', 'less', 'polished', 'versions', 'later', 'material']",Jim Breuer: Hardcore
718918,A1VIPYGKFWJTDT,B00006JU6T,T. Bradley,"[1, 2]","Breuer is funny as hell. His stand up is getting better and better. What a difference from his old Comedy Central stand up special (Pulp Comics I think). With his tales of growing up on LI, to him becoming a grown up (yeah ok) its pretty darn funny. Cant wait for him to start working on some new stuff, and maybe make some appearances on the Opie and Anthony XM radio show.To not find his stuff funny means you have no sense of humor, or like Chris Kattan funny (aka awful/terrible idiot comedy). Didnt laugh once...? C-span...? pffft. Someone has it in for a certain comic.
