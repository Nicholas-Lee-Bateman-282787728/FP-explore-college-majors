1106398,A6YUEKCR3SUM6,B000W2C29S,Bruno F. Smid,"[4, 5]","I had read some reviews before  purchasing the set. What we viewed was a wonderfully and tastefully presented story of a young and vibrant woman married to a wealthy, but due to war injury, impotent man whom she loved and attentively cared for. With some encouragement from her husband who senses her loneliness, she becomes involved with the husband's forest warden.The relationship with the forest warden changes from pure physical needs and  gradually evolves into a more emotional and caring one, however, all along, she never neglects her husband. Some of the encounters and love scenes with the warden are explicit, but presented in a natural way, as opposed to the way physical sex is being portrayed in todays movies and TV programs. The photography is such that it is believable, but not xxx-rated. All through the movie, it is the characters and their relations that are important - not the few sex scenes.The set includes a very helpful and important narrative by the director and commentaries about the sexual aspects of the movie, the issues faced by the actors and their acceptance on basis of the tasteful way in which these scenes were filmed.Anyone looking for a lot of ups and downs, raw or unusual sex will be disappointed.

1106403,AYG1U47VFZ165,B000W2C29S,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[22, 26]","I guess you could write all the live-long day about the number of times this D.H. Lawrence novel has been brought to the big screen, the small screen, or the direct-to-DVD screen, but I don't think LADY CHATTERLEY has been given such highbrow treatment before (though I admit I haven't seen the full BBC adaptation, which I hear is quite entertaining).  I guess the entertainment industry's love affair with the classic novel enjoys the same lusty high and lows that the mylady does with the gamekeeper!  For what it's worth, many others have made much ado about the film's pacing so I'll spare you my quaint concerns on that matter suffice it to say that I think director Pascale Ferran could've trimmed the 40 minute set-up just a wee bit to get to the juicy ""first contact"" and probably not sacrificed much story.  Also, critics have been quick to praise ""every frame of the film is bustling with life"" (paraphrased), but that's certainly not the case with this DVD release as I found much of the picture quality poor to medium with some of the greenery of Clifford's (her invalid husband) estate to be lost to grain.  And the use of colors and costumes (once sexually awakened, Constance Chatterley's fabric of choice seeming goes from flannel and burlap to elegant silky satins freshly colored in Crayola ""Harlot Red"") could be the source of endless discussion and fascination, but, in the end, any film exploration of the Chatterley affair inevitably always comes down to the matter of how the two lovers get it on.And these two do get it on quite well.  The DVD cover art boasts ""the most frankly sensual movie in memory.""  I've read elsewhere that the coupling is intended to be as close to authentic as possible, and by authentic I can only assume that the critic politely meant to say that it's relatively short, subtle, and mostly not overtly HBO or Cinemax theatrical where the two last for hours only to end up in a huddled poised sweaty sculpturesque mess only fit for Victorian paintings.  ""Earthy"" is a word that comes to mind for me.  Their first coupling is awkward -- paced as though it was plucked from reality -- with mylady clearly not quite knowing what to do, what to think, or what to make of the experience while Parkin remains -- at all times -- largely servant-like.  Afterwards, neither take a moment to bask in the awakening, per se; largely, they both desire to return to their lives, and it isn't until a few days later that they experience the real emotional awakening that comes from their attachment.With each successive encounter, these two grow more and more adventurous and expressive until, finally, it's plain to see that they've committed to one another much more than their initial bonding, one that was clearly predicated on their employer/employee relationship.  Constance -- at the talents of Marina Hands -- is deftly portrayed both in and out of the sexual experience, and her character becomes a bit more of a mouthpiece for defying the social conventions of the time -- speaking to her husband in favor of change; wanting to and talking about having a child to her husband who cannot give her what she wants; using her personal wealth to establish her lover at a time when men didn't live off the wealth of women -- but not much more of a mouthpiece than the character has had in previous screen incarnations.So, in the end, we're given a film where the encounters do seem, feel, portray the physical relationship and the budding emotional one as arguably much more authentic than before, but that's about it.  In the end, Constance has found love, and Parkin's accepted his place in the universe, and the film climaxes (a bad word, yes, but you knew it was coming ... ouch!) with perhaps the most curious moments that 50% of viewers would say cries out for a sequel ... but methinks D.H. Lawrence isn't around to take advantage of it.I can't help but add that, come the conclusion, Constance is still governed by her issues.  Her lust.  Her desire.  Her thirst for life and love.  Her endless femininity.  But, also, she's curiously weighted down just a bit by a free-spirited, globe-trotting sister who looks frighteningly like a young boy in awkward drag.Such is life ...",3,Lady Chatterley Has Issues ...,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,4223,"['guess', 'could', 'write', 'live-long', 'day', 'number', 'times', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'novel', 'been', 'brought', 'big', 'screen', 'small', 'screen', 'direct-to-DVD', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'LADY', 'CHATTERLEY', 'been', 'given', 'such', 'highbrow', 'treatment', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'full', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'hear', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'guess', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'love', 'affair', 'classic', 'novel', 'same', 'lusty', 'high', 'lows', 'mylady', 'gamekeeper', 'what', 'worth', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'ado', 'film', 'pacing', 'so', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'quaint', 'concerns', 'matter', 'suffice', 'say', 'think', 'director', 'Pascale', 'Ferran', 'could', ""'ve"", 'trimmed', '40', 'minute', 'set-up', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'get', 'juicy', 'first', 'contact', 'probably', 'not', 'sacrificed', 'much', 'story', 'Also', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'quick', 'praise', 'frame', 'film', 'bustling', 'life', 'paraphrased', 'certainly', 'not', 'case', 'DVD', 'release', 'found', 'much', 'picture', 'quality', 'poor', 'medium', 'greenery', 'Clifford', 'invalid', 'husband', 'estate', 'be', 'lost', 'grain', 'use', 'colors', 'costumes', 'once', 'sexually', 'awakened', 'Constance', 'Chatterley', 'fabric', 'choice', 'seeming', 'flannel', 'burlap', 'elegant', 'silky', 'satins', 'freshly', 'colored', 'Crayola', 'Harlot', 'Red', 'could', 'be', 'source', 'endless', 'discussion', 'fascination', 'end', 'film', 'exploration', 'Chatterley', 'affair', 'inevitably', 'always', 'down', 'matter', 'how', 'two', 'lovers', 'get', 'two', 'do', 'get', 'quite', 'well', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'most', 'frankly', 'sensual', 'movie', 'memory', ""'ve"", 'read', 'elsewhere', 'coupling', 'intended', 'be', 'as', 'close', 'authentic', 'possible', 'authentic', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'critic', 'politely', 'meant', 'say', 'relatively', 'short', 'subtle', 'mostly', 'not', 'overtly', 'HBO', 'Cinemax', 'theatrical', 'where', 'two', 'last', 'hours', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'huddled', 'poised', 'sweaty', 'sculpturesque', 'mess', 'only', 'fit', 'Victorian', 'paintings', 'Earthy', 'word', 'mind', 'first', 'coupling', 'awkward', 'paced', 'was', 'plucked', 'reality', 'mylady', 'clearly', 'not', 'quite', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'think', 'what', 'make', 'experience', 'Parkin', 'times', 'largely', 'servant-like', 'Afterwards', 'take', 'moment', 'bask', 'awakening', 'se', 'largely', 'desire', 'return', 'lives', ""n't"", 'few', 'days', 'later', 'experience', 'real', 'emotional', 'awakening', 'attachment.With', 'successive', 'encounter', 'two', 'grow', 'more', 'more', 'adventurous', 'expressive', 'finally', 'plain', 'see', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'initial', 'bonding', 'one', 'was', 'clearly', 'predicated', 'employer/employee', 'relationship', 'Constance', 'talents', 'Marina', 'Hands', 'deftly', 'portrayed', 'sexual', 'experience', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'mouthpiece', 'defying', 'social', 'conventions', 'time', 'speaking', 'husband', 'favor', 'change', 'wanting', 'talking', 'having', 'child', 'husband', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'what', 'using', 'personal', 'wealth', 'establish', 'lover', 'time', 'when', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'off', 'wealth', 'women', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'mouthpiece', 'character', 'had', 'previous', 'screen', 'incarnations.So', 'end', ""'re"", 'given', 'film', 'where', 'encounters', 'do', 'seem', 'feel', 'portray', 'physical', 'relationship', 'budding', 'emotional', 'one', 'arguably', 'much', 'more', 'authentic', 'before', 'end', 'Constance', 'found', 'love', 'Parkin', 'accepted', 'place', 'universe', 'film', 'climaxes', 'bad', 'word', 'yes', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'ouch', 'perhaps', 'most', 'curious', 'moments', '50', '%', 'viewers', 'would', 'say', 'cries', 'out', 'sequel', 'methinks', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', ""n't"", 'around', 'take', 'advantage', 'it.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'add', 'come', 'conclusion', 'Constance', 'still', 'governed', 'issues', 'lust', 'desire', 'thirst', 'life', 'love', 'endless', 'femininity', 'also', 'curiously', 'weighted', 'down', 'just', 'bit', 'free-spirited', 'globe-trotting', 'sister', 'who', 'frighteningly', 'young', 'boy', 'awkward', 'drag.Such', 'life']",Lady Chatterley

As to the pace being too slow, that complaint stems from a failure to understand whose point of view we are seeing.  Hint: the title.  The pace is what it is to be consistent with the timeframe of a woman's natural emotional reactions to major life events, especially relative to the period of the film.  The setting is very Eden-like and the protagonists are a variation on Adam and Eve minus the theological baggage, so isn't this a story one wishes would never end?

1106406,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000W2C29S,Grady Harp,"[97, 98]","DH Lawrence's novels may be tough to translate to the screen, so much of his writing is dependent on the words on the page as they form images of extraordinary beauty and sensuality. His novels are quintessentially British and reflect on the dehumanizing effects of modernity and industrialization, confronting issues relating to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, sexuality, and human instinct. During his lifetime he was even labeled a pornographer, but that was then and now is now, and under the gifted guidance of director/writer (with Roger Bohbot and Pierre Trividic) Pascale Ferran, Lawrence's exquisite tale of sexual awakening has found what for this viewer is the finest transition of the novel to the screen.The place is England after WW I and Sir Clifford Chatterley (Hippolyte Girardot) is the paraplegic wealthy husband of Constance/Lady Chatterley (a radiant Marina Hands). Quite apropos for the era, Constance tends to her impotent husband, does needlepoint, and takes walks to while away her boredom. On one of her walks she encounters the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), seeing a partially nude man for the first time in her life. The impact awakens her somnolent sexuality and she manages to visit Parkin daily, gradually allowing her lust to unfold. Parkin is 'below her class' but is a masculine, sensuous embodiment of everything Constance has never experienced. They slowly bond and both of them become passionately in love, finding lovemaking in Parkin's hut, in the woods, in the rain - wherever they encounter. Constance wants to have a baby and convinces Clifford that she can become impregnated and the resulting child would be 'Clifford's' by pact. Constance travels to London, the Riviera, and other ports, only to return home believing that Parkin has reclaimed his ex-wife. But there are many surprises that greet her and the manner in which the story resolves (in Ferran's hands) leaves us unsure of the future.The film is captured amidst the beauties of the natural world - flowers, trees, springs, brooks - and these aspects of the natural world are an influential part of Constance's sexual awakening. Yes, there are scenes of complete nudity and love making but they are photographed so well byJulian Hirsch that they become an integral part of the story. The musical score by B&eacute;atrice Thiriet finds the right quality of elegance and sensuality. If there is a problem with this nearly three-hour film it is in the editing by Yann Dedet and Mathilde Muyard that takes liberties with scene transitions that prove disruptive.But it would be hard to imagine two actors who could match the subtlety and sexual tension that Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coullo'ch to this film. It is breathtakingly beautiful to experience DH Lawrence's story in the hands of the French crew and cast.

Lawrence's famous-- or infamous novel, depending on your point of view-- is extremely well done and for the most part a joy to watch. The plot is familiar: Lady Chatterley (the perfectly cast Marina Hands) is reduced to taking care of her husband, Sir Clifford (Hippolyte Girardot), a casualty from World War I, in a marriage that is less than perfect on every level. One day she glimpses the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), a masculine, humpy man not in her class, naked from the waist up bathing himself. The rest is, as they say, herstory. Lady Chatterley spends the rest of the over-two-hour film having sex with Parkin whenever possible. What begins as clothed passion eventually becomes naked, abandoned love.All three main characters are well cast, complex and believable. Sir Clifford, for all his coldness and upper class snobbery, is a sympathetic figure as evidenced in the scene when he stalls out his motorized wheel car and has to depend on the help of both his wife and Parkin as well as when he confronts Constance with her own drawing of class distinctions.As difficult as love may be between classes, particulary in this time in British history, we are left in the end of this beautifully filmed movie believing that it just may be possible. Parkin and Constance engage in some of the most torrid sex scenes you are likely to see.The film is a little too long and at times gets a little too much like ""Elvira Madigan"" with all those trysts in the meadows. And I kept wondering why Sir Clifford's nurse didn't know what Lady Chatterley was doing when she was so often not at home but always out in the fields with her man.

Is it a coincidence that Marina Hands looks a bit like Audrey Tautou in Amelie? And that the contrast of her crushed red velvet suit against the lush green forest also seems a bit like Amelie's red/green contrasting color-range? Maybe this is a French sensibility for beauty?2) Why is it taking so long for Connie and Parkin to touch? I know it is coming. When. When. When. Okay, maybe now. No. Okay.3) Why is Mellors called Parkin? Why is he built more like a boxer than the thin and young aesthetic man I was expecting?In answer to my last two issues -- I am glad that the beginning was long and drawn out. The time it takes to get to the first touch builds the tension and lets us in to their experience.And Jean-Louis Coullo'ch as Parkin won me over in a big way. By the time Constance and Parkin are in the middle of their love affair, I am smitten. The look in his eyes and his inner core vulnerability propel the emotional story.Also, something other reviewers hadn't mentioned yet, the supporting cast is wonderful, especially in the extended European cut of this movie, where they are given more time to flesh out their roles. No one is a villain. Yes, Hippolyte Girardot's Clifford is cold and distant. But his pride is hurt as much as his body.  I enjoyed seeing his interactions with Mrs. Bolton. With Mrs. Bolton he found someone that would look up to him and who he could mentor and teach, and who would nurture him.Marina Hand's performance is generous and subtle. She allows us to recognize ourselves in what she experiences. The connection and chemistry between the characters is compelling.This Constance and Parkin relationship is about the honest revealing of one person to another. With each encounter they learn more about each other.Director Pascale Ferran mentioned in the extra features that she was going for truthfulness in sensation and being in the moment. That is rare to see in movies, although people are hungry for it.

It was on &#34;the list&#34; in high school, but I wasn't interested enough to revisit, since it wasn't anything forbidden to me by then. I remember everyone else running around giggling at all the &#34;descriptions&#34; and all the dirty words they wanted to use to shock their friends. If this movie got &#34;racy&#34; later on, I don't believe I could stomach it, due to the stodginess of those presumably involved. Rather an unlovely film in my estimation, but then maybe as an American I am more used to more epic offerings such as Gone With the Wind, which I saw about the same year I was reading Lady Chatterly  under the bed :-).

1106424,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000W2C29S,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Lady Chatterley"" is a tale of repression, lust and sexual liberation set in post-World War I France. Despite its title, the movie isn't an adaptation of ""Lady Chatterley's Lover,"" the taboo-shattering D.H. Lawrence novel that scandalized the world when it was published in 1928. The film is actually based on a Lawrence work entitled ""John Thomas and Lady Jane"" that came out the previous year.  But the theme and storyline are just about as erotic and provocative as what we find in its more famous successor.This version features Marina Hands as the beautiful young wife of an aristocratic mine owner who's been rendered wheelchair-bound and impotent by injuries he sustained on the battlefield. Deprived of sex, Constance begins to fantasize about the husky gamekeeper who lives in the woods on the estate, and it's not long before the two of them have consummated their relationship.  Jean Louis Coulloc'h is a particularly interesting casting choice as Parkin, for his scrappy features, thinning hair, linebacker's build and non-matinee-idol looks remove the story from the realm of dime-novel romance and into the arena of sheer physical attraction and lust.  At least for awhile, that is, until the almost inevitable rush of feelings begins to overtake the couple, and the harsh realities of sexual mores, marital bonds and class distinctions that so define the era in which they live begin to make themselves felt.Co-written by Roger Bohbot and director Pascale Ferran, the movie is long (two-hours-and-forty-one minutes, to be exact!), episodic and deliberately paced, but the lush setting, understated human drama and moving performances keep us riveted for the duration.",4,Lush study of lust,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1682,"['Lady', 'Chatterley', 'tale', 'repression', 'lust', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'set', 'post-World', 'War', 'France', 'title', 'movie', ""n't"", 'adaptation', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', 'taboo-shattering', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'novel', 'scandalized', 'world', 'when', 'was', 'published', '1928', 'film', 'actually', 'based', 'Lawrence', 'work', 'entitled', 'John', 'Thomas', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'came', 'out', 'previous', 'year', 'theme', 'storyline', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'erotic', 'provocative', 'what', 'find', 'more', 'famous', 'successor.This', 'version', 'features', 'Marina', 'Hands', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'aristocratic', 'mine', 'owner', 'who', 'been', 'rendered', 'wheelchair-bound', 'impotent', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'battlefield', 'Deprived', 'sex', 'Constance', 'fantasize', 'husky', 'gamekeeper', 'who', 'woods', 'estate', 'not', 'long', 'two', 'have', 'consummated', 'relationship', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'Coulloc', 'h', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'casting', 'choice', 'Parkin', 'scrappy', 'features', 'thinning', 'hair', 'linebacker', 'build', 'non-matinee-idol', 'looks', 'remove', 'story', 'realm', 'dime-novel', 'romance', 'arena', 'sheer', 'physical', 'attraction', 'lust', 'least', 'awhile', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'rush', 'feelings', 'begins', 'overtake', 'couple', 'harsh', 'realities', 'sexual', 'mores', 'marital', 'bonds', 'class', 'distinctions', 'so', 'era', 'live', 'begin', 'make', 'felt.Co-written', 'Roger', 'Bohbot', 'director', 'Pascale', 'Ferran', 'movie', 'long', 'two-hours-and-forty-one', 'minutes', 'be', 'exact', 'episodic', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'lush', 'setting', 'understated', 'human', 'drama', 'moving', 'performances', 'keep', 'riveted', 'duration']",Lady Chatterley

Pretty but dissatisfied Lady Chatterley, married to an invalid of WW1, has her passions aroused when she comes upon the gamekeeper having a wash.

The scenery is beautiful, and the passion builds, from an initial quick encounter to hours full of love.I loved the way the director filmed Lady Chatterley's holiday on the Riviera with her family in grainy footage, making it seem unreal to her, as against the bright clear colours of life on the estate.Not a film to watch with your granny (obviously); a wonderful and stirring portrayal of a love affair.",4,"The characters may not be as I imagined, but they absolutely work",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,911,"['started', 'off', 'dubious', 'one', 'Pretty', 'dissatisfied', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'married', 'invalid', 'WW1', 'passions', 'aroused', 'when', 'gamekeeper', 'having', 'wash.', 'My', 'main', 'objection', 'was', 'said', 'gamekeeper', 'here', 'named', 'Parkin', 'instead', 'original', 'Mellors', 'was', 'not', 'sex-god', 'had', 'envisioned', 'older', 'seriously', 'taciturn', 'even', 'curmudgeonly', 'character.But', 'was', 'soon', 'captivated', 'increasingly', 'romantic', 'assignations', 'hut', 'fire', 'Parkin', 'cottage', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'passion', 'builds', 'initial', 'quick', 'encounter', 'hours', 'full', 'love.I', 'loved', 'way', 'director', 'filmed', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'holiday', 'Riviera', 'family', 'grainy', 'footage', 'making', 'seem', 'unreal', 'bright', 'clear', 'colours', 'life', 'estate.Not', 'film', 'watch', 'granny', 'obviously', 'wonderful', 'stirring', 'portrayal', 'love', 'affair']",Lady Chatterley

Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" is the 1992 version with Joely Richardson and Sean Bean playing the lead roles, this 2006 French adaptation is well-done too. I just felt that in adapting it in French, the finer nuances of D.H. Lawrence's original English was lost. The movie is also rather long, clocking in at almost three hours [the first hour was extremely slow-moving] and could have done with some editing.Anyway, in this adaptation, the director Pascale Ferran has adopted an earlier, less scandalous version of Lawrence's work as her source, focusing instead on sex as a catalyst that brings about major changes in the two leads. Lady Constance Chatterley [Marina Hands who went on to star in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly] is an oppressed young wife whose WW I vet and crippled husband, Clifford [Hippolyte Girardot] is unable to fulfill his wife's physical or emotional needs. He moves them to his country estate, Wragby where Constance feels lost and bored. Things change when Constance comes upon the half exposed [waist up] gamekeeper Oliver Parkin [Jean-Louis Coulloc'h] and fascinated, she contrives situations where the pair meet and eventually begin an affair. The sex scenes are very sensual, focusing not so much on the pure gyrations of the act but also on the facial expressions on the two people involved. Both actors really get into their roles, and their vivid facial expressions, especially Marina Hands', convey not just pleasure, but also the dawning realization of the power of sex. There are about six sex scenes in this movie, and there is a sort of chronological development in the pair's affair that mirrors the progression of their feelings for each other - from the first almost clumsy and brief encounter to the development of closeness and eventually love.Marina Hands plays her role with consummate skill, from an almost naive and relatively inexperienced young woman to one who experiences a thoroughly sensual awakening and a liberation of senses. Jean-Louis Coulloc'h as the gamekeeper Parkin is credible as the rough yet gentle gamekeeper who is aware of the discrepancies in class between him and the lady of the house, yet loves with his body and soul.Beautifully filmed, ""Lady Chatterley"" mesmerizes with its in-depth characterizations and its sensual portrayal of a passionate love story that crosses the lines of class and rules of society.",4,Breathtaking adaptation,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,2432,"['favorite', 'adaptation', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'Lover', '1992', 'version', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'playing', 'lead', 'roles', '2006', 'French', 'adaptation', 'well-done', 'too', 'just', 'felt', 'adapting', 'French', 'finer', 'nuances', 'D.H.', 'Lawrence', 'original', 'English', 'was', 'lost', 'movie', 'also', 'rather', 'long', 'clocking', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', '[', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'extremely', 'slow-moving', ']', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'editing.Anyway', 'adaptation', 'director', 'Pascale', 'Ferran', 'adopted', 'earlier', 'less', 'scandalous', 'version', 'Lawrence', 'work', 'source', 'focusing', 'instead', 'sex', 'catalyst', 'major', 'changes', 'two', 'leads', 'Lady', 'Constance', 'Chatterley', '[', 'Marina', 'Hands', 'who', 'went', 'star', 'Diving', 'Bell', 'Butterfly', ']', 'oppressed', 'young', 'wife', 'WW', 'vet', 'crippled', 'husband', 'Clifford', '[', 'Hippolyte', 'Girardot', ']', 'unable', 'fulfill', 'wife', 'physical', 'emotional', 'needs', 'country', 'estate', 'Wragby', 'where', 'Constance', 'lost', 'bored', 'Things', 'change', 'when', 'Constance', 'half', 'exposed', '[', 'waist', 'up', ']', 'gamekeeper', 'Oliver', 'Parkin', '[', 'Jean-Louis', 'Coulloc', 'h', ']', 'fascinated', 'situations', 'where', 'pair', 'meet', 'eventually', 'begin', 'affair', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'sensual', 'focusing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'pure', 'gyrations', 'act', 'also', 'facial', 'expressions', 'two', 'people', 'involved', 'actors', 'really', 'get', 'roles', 'vivid', 'facial', 'expressions', 'especially', 'Marina', 'Hands', 'not', 'just', 'pleasure', 'also', 'dawning', 'realization', 'power', 'sex', 'are', 'six', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', 'sort', 'chronological', 'development', 'pair', 'affair', 'progression', 'feelings', 'other', 'first', 'almost', 'clumsy', 'brief', 'encounter', 'development', 'closeness', 'eventually', 'love.Marina', 'Hands', 'role', 'consummate', 'skill', 'almost', 'naive', 'relatively', 'inexperienced', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'sensual', 'awakening', 'liberation', 'senses', 'Jean-Louis', 'Coulloc', 'h', 'gamekeeper', 'Parkin', 'credible', 'rough', 'yet', 'gentle', 'gamekeeper', 'who', 'aware', 'discrepancies', 'class', 'lady', 'house', 'body', 'soul.Beautifully', 'filmed', 'Lady', 'Chatterley', 'in-depth', 'characterizations', 'sensual', 'portrayal', 'passionate', 'love', 'story', 'lines', 'class', 'rules', 'society']",Lady Chatterley
