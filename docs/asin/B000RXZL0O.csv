1084367,A1OTT1WRI3H2V8,B000RXZL0O,Christina Roberts,"[1, 1]","Rules of Engagement is a very good sitcom. It's hilarious and cast perfectly.The fist season only had 7 episodes because it was a mid-season replacement for ""Old Christine""This is a review of the DVD, not the show.The Complete First Season:The set is not really a boxed set, but more of just a normal DVD. It's packaged in a normal DVD case. The front cover has a cast picture resembling that of the opening sequence. The back has a series summary and features included. There is only one disc with the same picture as the front cover on it. The menues have nice color to theme as the theme, ""How Many Ways"" by Senor Happy, plays with as a background of images of the cast. You have the choice to either watch all 7 episodes in a row, or just one at a time.The picture is presented in Widescreen format, the audio is very clear.It is a cheap set, but why spend a lot of money for just one disc?The features actually aren't bad, but they aren't the best features. There's a table read, which is very entertaining.If you are a fan of the show, then buy this DVD!!!!!!

1084372,A2TOX3E4WZ8BSQ,B000RXZL0O,"Ivan K. Samuelson ""Bolski""","[25, 28]","Rules of Engagement's season 1 is a pretty funny season, albeit it's short at only 7 episodes. Luckily, it's been picked up for a second season and so far, has been a hoot to watch.If you've been married for many years, are in engaged or you're still swinging in the singles crowd, this show has it for everyone. Patrick Warburton and Megyn Price play the happily but haggard married couple Jeff and Audrey. Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich play Adam and Jennifer, the newly engaged couple who don't know what they're in store for. Then, there is David Spade as Russell. A 40-something single person who still chases women like they're going out of style.Jeff is hilarious as the husband who loves his wife, but has become numb to many things after being married for 12-years. Adam proposed to Jennifer quickly without thinking about it and is now beginning to see where his ""freedoms"" that he had as a single man are slowly going away, yet he still loves Jennifer. Then there's Russell who laughs at everything the married and engaged couple go through but nothing really works well for him either.This DVD comes with all 7 episodes in 1.78:1 anamorphic wide screen format. The picture is crisp and clear. The sound is great, for a TV show. It contains some special features including bloopers, the cast doing a screen reading and a set tour with Oliver Hudson. But, that's about it which is kind of a shame. No commentary from any of the cast. So, I'd give a 4 stars to the show itself, but only a 3.5 for the DVD. The DVD is not a 3, so I have to go with 4 stars.But, for those that have not seen the show, here is a listing of the episodes:1. Pilot.Audrey and Jeff invite Adam and Jennifer, a newly engaged couple, to an art opening. However, Audrey and Jeff have an argument the day before the event that makes them question why they got married and Jeff begins to talk to Adam about some of the ""issues"" of being married since he sees Adam apparently being so happy to be engaged. Married men, be prepared to laugh out loud on what Jeff has to say. Meanwhile, Audrey tries to fix Russell up with her girlfriend, hoping it will change his ways. Pretty funny for an opening pilot, but not the best. Jeff's ""balanced-ish"" checkbook bantering with Audrey is classic though and VERY funny. 3/52. The Birthday Deal.Audrey hosts a lavish birthday party for Jeff against his wishes since it costs so much. But, he can't complain about it because he'll never get his ""birthday deal"" from Audrey. Adam and Russell want to find out what the birthday deal is and Adam and Jennifer come up with their own ""birthday deals"". This one is better than the pilot. 4/5.3. The Young and the Restless.Adam isn't sleeping well in Jennifer's small bed so he brings in his larger bed. However, Jennifer can't sleep in it because of Adam's previous partners. This causes them to discuss memories of past relationships with hilarious results. Meanwhile, Audrey is jealous after Jeff takes her up on a bet that he can get another woman's phone number and Russell has no issues in helping Jeff out. 4/5.4. Game OnAdam purchases a $500 video game set without talking with Jennifer first. She then has him agree to discuss any future major purchases with her. Rather than spending a ton of money on getting her hair fixed, she decides to choose a cheaper alternative and Adam sells his video game system to Russell and takes up solitaire instead. Married guys, have you ever run into this before? ;) These ""choices"" lead to hilarious results. Audrey accuses Jeff of caring more about sports than her. Overall, this hits home really well. 4/5.5. KidsAdam and Jennifer plan for a romantic get away. However, they begin to discuss their plans for the future and when Jennifer finds out that Adam wants her to stay home with the kids, things begin to fall apart. Meanwhile, Audrey wonders why after 12 years they don't have kids. It turns into Jeff and Audrey saying there is a ""physical"" problem that isn't allowing them to have kids so they seek counseling. What happens with Jeff and some magazines is hilarious bar none. 5/5.6. Hard Day's NightJeff helps Jennifer move a heavy couch and ends up straining his neck. Jennifer gives him a neck massage that results in an arising surprise that upsets Audrey. Meanwhile, Russell is having ""issues"" with a schoolyard bully that is preventing him from getting closer to a teacher. The Adam/Russell story is not bad, but the Jeff/Audrey and Jennifer arch is hilarious. 4.5/57. Jeff's Wooby.Possibly the funniest episode out of all of this first season. Adam is surprised when Jennifer wants to set a definite date for their marriage. Audrey takes Jeff's high school and college t-shirts and makes them into a blanket. However, this causes Jeff to reminisce about all his ""memories"" of how he got the shirts to the point that he won't shut up. Russell's new date makes a lot of sexual references in her conversations, yet she won't sleep with him. Eventually, they decide that she's the ""she"" in ""that's what she said!"".

I love almost anything that David Spade is in, but this is really great regardless.David Spades character (Russell) is like a 5th wheel to his friends Adam (Oliver Hudson) and Jennifer (Bianca Kajlich) who are an engaged couple and his other friends Jeff (Patrick Warburton) and Audrey (Megyn Price) who are a married couple.  Jeff is hilarious with his deadpan humour and deep voice and it seems like Oliver Hudson got some comic skills from his mother Goldie Hawn because he's also great (and cute).There are some good special features here such as bloopers, set tour with Oliver Hudson, from table reading to taping and Rules Of Engagement dvd-rom content.I love this show so much that I can't wait for season 2 (although it's delayed because of the strike).  It's the kind of show you can watch a few times and still laugh at.  I really love Jeffs Wooby episode, where Russell has a new date that makes lots of s*xual refrences in her conversation but won't sleep with him.  That's got to be the funniest.
