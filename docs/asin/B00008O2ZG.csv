First of all, the love scenes came too quickly, it didn't even make sense.  Second of all, how dumb could that girl get.  First she didn't know who those people were chasing her than she knew who the people were.  It was like Lady, make up your mind.  This was just as bad as that movie ""Ritual"".  This is a waste.

The classic ""hero-saves-damsel- in-distress"" film but with an Afrocentric flavor. Wendy Davis has an unusual brand of beauty. The more you see her, the better she looks. Tricky plot, plenty of ""edge-of-your-seat"" drama/action.
