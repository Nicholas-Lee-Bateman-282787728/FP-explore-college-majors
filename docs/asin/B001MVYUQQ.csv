1217848,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001MVYUQQ,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 4]","If it's one thing I've got to say about many (not all, but most) of the negative reviews of this product, is that most of them come from people have no taste in horror films and they have a very low vocabulary. Many of the one-star reviews for this film consisted of a grand total of three sentences and common complaints among them went like this; ""It was boring."" ""It wasn't scary."" ""The camera was too shaky."" ""It wasn't realistic."" That's what many of the negative reviews consisted of, with many of them not giving an explanation for why they thought it was so bad. In one review, the person complained about if the camera man was a professional, why did the camera shake so much? I didn't think the camera shook that much, and anyway, I don't think camera crews are trained for zombie attacks. I think this film absolutely fantastic and it does feel real. I believe that this film is indeed one of the best zombie films of the decade.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A news crew is doing a documentary on the Los Angeles fire department and for the most part nothing interesting has happened yet, and they're having a good time hanging out with the firemen. Then one day, the department receives a call, so the news crew goes along with them for this call to an apartment complex. When they get inside, they go into an apartment for an elderly old woman, only to find out that she has become a zombie and attacks the firemen. As the firemen desperately try to get out of the apartment complex to get two firemen to the hospital, it gets quarantined and everyone in the complex is sealed in, including the firemen and news crew. So the news crew decides to document what is happening while the people inside the building try to find a way out, and avoid being eaten by the rabies-infected zombies, or shot by the military for trying to escape. This is hectic, frenzied horror film that does deliver the scares.MUSIC: There is none, sadly.ACTING: I thought the actors were for the most part convincing, but not all of them were and sometimes the dialogue felt hammed up. It was generally good overall and most of the actors seemed to know what they were doing.ACTION: This film is done similar to Cloverfield's cam corder footage, so that's what it looks like. This film is pretty much Cloverfield meets 28 Days Later, and it's an absolute blast. This film has plenty of scares and tense moments around every corner, and it's quite violent as well. It is a bloody film with nice gore effects. Unfortunately, there were times in which I felt the characters were a little slow to catch onto the fact that you need to shoot or bludgeon the zombies in the head in order for them to stay dead. Not to mention they were slow to catch onto the fact the disease is spread through bites or bodily fluids getting into cuts and openings. The action scenes were fantastic and well-scripted though, which made up for the characters being dumb.OVERALL: I'd recommend a buy, definitely. If you haven't seen a good zombie film in awhile, this is a must-have horror film.THE GOOD: It's scary, it's bloody, the actors were good, it felt real, and I love the cam corder footage.THE BAD: Starts off slow, no music, some moments of questionable acting.",5,ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE FILMS EVER!  9.25 OUT OF 10,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,3219,"['one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'negative', 'reviews', 'product', 'most', 'come', 'people', 'have', 'taste', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'vocabulary', 'Many', 'one-star', 'reviews', 'film', 'consisted', 'grand', 'total', 'three', 'sentences', 'common', 'complaints', 'went', 'was', 'boring', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'camera', 'was', 'too', 'shaky', 'was', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'what', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'consisted', 'many', 'not', 'giving', 'explanation', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'one', 'review', 'person', 'complained', 'camera', 'man', 'was', 'professional', 'why', 'did', 'camera', 'shake', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'camera', 'shook', 'much', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'camera', 'crews', 'are', 'trained', 'zombie', 'attacks', 'think', 'film', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'feel', 'real', 'believe', 'film', 'indeed', 'one', 'best', 'zombie', 'films', 'decade.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'news', 'crew', 'doing', 'documentary', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'fire', 'department', 'most', 'part', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'happened', 'yet', ""'re"", 'having', 'good', 'time', 'hanging', 'out', 'firemen', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'department', 'call', 'news', 'crew', 'along', 'call', 'apartment', 'complex', 'When', 'get', 'inside', 'go', 'apartment', 'elderly', 'old', 'woman', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'become', 'zombie', 'firemen', 'firemen', 'desperately', 'try', 'get', 'apartment', 'complex', 'get', 'two', 'firemen', 'hospital', 'quarantined', 'everyone', 'complex', 'sealed', 'including', 'firemen', 'news', 'crew', 'news', 'crew', 'document', 'what', 'happening', 'people', 'building', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'avoid', 'being', 'eaten', 'rabies-infected', 'zombies', 'shot', 'military', 'trying', 'escape', 'hectic', 'frenzied', 'horror', 'film', 'deliver', 'scares.MUSIC', 'none', 'sadly.ACTING', 'thought', 'actors', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'convincing', 'not', 'were', 'sometimes', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'hammed', 'up', 'was', 'generally', 'good', 'overall', 'most', 'actors', 'seemed', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing.ACTION', 'film', 'done', 'similar', 'Cloverfield', 'cam', 'corder', 'footage', 'what', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'Cloverfield', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'absolute', 'blast', 'film', 'plenty', 'scares', 'tense', 'moments', 'corner', 'quite', 'violent', 'as', 'well', 'bloody', 'film', 'nice', 'gore', 'effects', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'times', 'felt', 'characters', 'were', 'little', 'slow', 'catch', 'fact', 'need', 'shoot', 'bludgeon', 'zombies', 'head', 'order', 'stay', 'dead', 'Not', 'mention', 'were', 'slow', 'catch', 'fact', 'disease', 'spread', 'bites', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'getting', 'cuts', 'openings', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'fantastic', 'well-scripted', 'though', 'made', 'up', 'characters', 'being', 'dumb.OVERALL', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'buy', 'definitely', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'good', 'zombie', 'film', 'awhile', 'must-have', 'horror', 'film.THE', 'GOOD', 'scary', 'bloody', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'felt', 'real', 'love', 'cam', 'corder', 'footage.THE', 'BAD', 'slow', 'music', 'moments', 'questionable', 'acting']",N/A

What I dislike though, are movies that fail to follow any reasonable logic, even if only its own internal logic based on the premises upon which the movie is created.The handheld camera perspective hit it big in Blair Witch Project, was unfortunately utilized in Cloverfield, and reaches its nadir as a filming technique with in Quarantine.  Like in Cloverfield, the characters have to keep justifying why they keep filming when any other reasonable person would ditch the camera and focus on survival, or would at least stop filming if they had even a drop of respect for human beings (my friend getting maimed/eatened/killed?  Great!  Roll film!).The worst problem with this movie are the characters.  At the beginning of the film, they witness a crazed old lady frothing at the mouth bite the throat out of a police officer, then ten minutes later kill a cleaning lady.  Then the entire building is mysteriously quarantined by the government (HMMM... obviously something stronger then a flu is going around right?).  So what do they do?  They gather everyone into one place, INCLUDING ANOTHER WOMAN FROTHING AT THE MOUTH!  Are you kidding me?  The entire building is quarantined, which any reasonable person would suspect to mean some kind of crazy virus is present, so they gather everyone together without knowing what the virus is and how it is spread, and bring down a woman who is literally dripping salvia like a water fountain?The comedy continues when the CDC sends in probably the worlds most inept entry/investigation team.  They send in only 3 people to secure an entire building which turns out not to be a problem because they don't even secure the building, or any of the people.  Apparently the 2 Soldiers have no idea how to keep their distance from potentially hostile suspects, or to keep their weapons pointed at them.  As a result, they get easily eaten by rabid humans.  The CDC doctor is also equally inept, though his getting eaten takes a little longer.  If the Army/CDC is going to enter the building, why wouldn't they use at least a platoon sized element and secure the entire building?  Why wouldn't they at least restrain the obviously rabid humans before trying to drill their brains?Towards the last twenty minutes of the film, the main character, a female reporter, breaks completely down in hysteria and becomes so annoying I actually began to fast forward through her bouts of hysteria.  She literally does nothing but cry, sob, and shake for the last twenty minutes of the movie.  For the last ten minutes of the movie we are treated to having to watch some zombie roam around in the attic wearing nothing but white underwear as the two remain humans cower in the dark.  All I could think was that it looked like a fruit of the loom commerical gone terrible wrong.When you clap when the main characters die, its probably not a good movie.",2,Blair Witch Project meets 28 Days Later,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,2973,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'action', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movies', 'outlandish', 'premises', 'What', 'dislike', 'are', 'movies', 'fail', 'follow', 'reasonable', 'logic', 'even', 'only', 'own', 'internal', 'logic', 'based', 'premises', 'movie', 'created.The', 'handheld', 'camera', 'perspective', 'hit', 'big', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'utilized', 'Cloverfield', 'nadir', 'filming', 'technique', 'Quarantine', 'Cloverfield', 'characters', 'have', 'keep', 'justifying', 'why', 'keep', 'filming', 'when', 'other', 'reasonable', 'person', 'would', 'ditch', 'camera', 'focus', 'survival', 'would', 'least', 'stop', 'filming', 'had', 'even', 'drop', 'respect', 'human', 'beings', 'friend', 'getting', 'maimed/eatened/killed', 'Great', 'Roll', 'film', '.The', 'worst', 'problem', 'movie', 'are', 'characters', 'beginning', 'film', 'witness', 'crazed', 'old', 'lady', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'throat', 'police', 'officer', 'then', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'kill', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'Then', 'entire', 'building', 'mysteriously', 'quarantined', 'government', 'HMMM', 'obviously', 'something', 'stronger', 'then', 'flu', 'going', 'around', 'right', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'gather', 'everyone', 'one', 'place', 'INCLUDING', 'ANOTHER', 'WOMAN', 'FROTHING', 'AT', 'THE', 'MOUTH', 'Are', 'kidding', 'entire', 'building', 'quarantined', 'reasonable', 'person', 'would', 'suspect', 'mean', 'kind', 'crazy', 'virus', 'present', 'gather', 'everyone', 'together', 'knowing', 'what', 'virus', 'how', 'spread', 'bring', 'down', 'woman', 'who', 'literally', 'dripping', 'salvia', 'water', 'fountain', 'comedy', 'when', 'CDC', 'sends', 'probably', 'worlds', 'most', 'inept', 'entry/investigation', 'team', 'send', 'only', '3', 'people', 'secure', 'entire', 'building', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'secure', 'building', 'people', 'Apparently', '2', 'Soldiers', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'keep', 'distance', 'potentially', 'hostile', 'suspects', 'keep', 'weapons', 'pointed', 'result', 'get', 'easily', 'eaten', 'rabid', 'humans', 'CDC', 'doctor', 'also', 'equally', 'inept', 'getting', 'eaten', 'little', 'longer', 'Army/CDC', 'going', 'enter', 'building', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'least', 'platoon', 'sized', 'element', 'secure', 'entire', 'building', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'least', 'restrain', 'obviously', 'rabid', 'humans', 'trying', 'drill', 'brains', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'female', 'reporter', 'completely', 'down', 'hysteria', 'so', 'annoying', 'actually', 'began', 'fast', 'forward', 'bouts', 'hysteria', 'literally', 'nothing', 'cry', 'sob', 'shake', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'having', 'watch', 'zombie', 'roam', 'attic', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'white', 'underwear', 'two', 'remain', 'humans', 'cower', 'dark', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'looked', 'fruit', 'loom', 'commerical', 'gone', 'terrible', 'wrong.When', 'clap', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'die', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

1217853,A3W3LP0RSWLJCS,B001MVYUQQ,Annihilatrix1138,"[1, 2]","Those genuinely good zombie movies are few and far between, sadly. Since the gem that was ""28 Days Later"" (heck, even its sequel) we've seen, in my opinion, only two that register as good to me: Zack Snyder's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and Robert Rodriguez's grindhouse homage, ""Planet Terror."" Everything else is always lacking. Even the master himself, George A. Romero, managed to make a lackluster addition with ""Diary of the Dead.""This is why ""Quarantine"" has received high marks from me, because it managed to do right by the genre. Yes, perhaps with mixed results, but there's no denying that the final product was indeed entertaining, and frightening in the right places.This movie had a lot to live up to for several reasons. One, because it's a remake of a very cherished Spanish film, ""[REC]"" (I've never seen it myself, I'm afraid, but many reactions to ""Quarantine""s existence led me to believe ""[REC]"" is indeed cherished). Second, because this film's release fell within the same year as another of a little similarly-made monster movie, ""Cloverfield,"" which arguably set the standard for the ""found footage"" way of making a movie.The final results are very commendable. The story follows a news reporter and her fellow cameraman as they tag along with the L.A. fire department on a typical call. They arrive at an aging apartment complex to discover that a virus is quickly spreading throughout the building, tenant by tenant. When the group tries to escape, they find that they are effectively locked inside by the CDC, with no word as to what is happening.As the minutes tick by, the quarantined ""prisoners"" of the complex have to try and stay alive as they slowly (very slowly) figure out the cause of this virus.I had a few problems with this movie. The whole thing might as well be a case study in natural selection, as this group of survivors doesn't catch on very quickly. Even with people dying all around them, they still treat these infected with kindness as they continue to spring up. Perhaps it was the filmmaker's misconception that his audience was as misinformed as his characters. The plot, what little there is of it, develops very slowly with most of the development happening in the last ten minutes. That, and the owner of the building manages to think up new ways out of his own complex at random times, but always a minute too late.(SPOILER ALERT:) The landlord of the building, at the very end of the movie, mind you, suddenly remembers that there is a way out of the building through the basement. Why, when the group is so desperate for a way out, does he decide to withhold this information until there's no chance of reaching it?It's these little slip-ups that make the movie annoying at times, but that quickly goes away as the zombies start growing in number. The action is very, for lack of a better word, cool. That is where this film really shines. In addition to its first-person filming style, the movie is a joy to watch. I've always liked the way ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" were shot. I wish there were many more like them, but it is very easy to get it wrong (""Diary of the Dead"").If the filmmakers had placed more faith in their audience, and maybe added a less predictable ending, then ""Quarantine"" would have been up there with ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch"", instead of being the inferior of the three. As it stands, it's a nice addition to the zombie genre that provides some very nice scares and action, but even that might only stand up with one or two viewings.Perfect as a rental, and for those who still have ""Cloverfield"" fever.EXTRAS: A very long list of trailers, a couple five-minute long ""Making-of"" documentaries, and commentary by the Brothers Dowdle.",4,A Worthy Addition To The Zombie Genre,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,3742,"['genuinely', 'good', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'sadly', 'gem', 'was', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'heck', 'even', 'sequel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'opinion', 'only', 'two', 'register', 'as', 'good', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'grindhouse', 'homage', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'Everything', 'else', 'always', 'lacking', 'Even', 'master', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'managed', 'make', 'lackluster', 'addition', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'why', 'Quarantine', 'received', 'high', 'marks', 'managed', 'do', 'right', 'genre', 'Yes', 'perhaps', 'mixed', 'results', 'denying', 'final', 'product', 'was', 'indeed', 'entertaining', 'frightening', 'right', 'places.This', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'several', 'reasons', 'One', 'remake', 'very', 'cherished', 'Spanish', 'film', '[', 'REC', ']', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'many', 'reactions', 'Quarantine', 's', 'existence', 'led', 'believe', '[', 'REC', ']', 'indeed', 'cherished', 'Second', 'film', 'release', 'fell', 'same', 'year', 'little', 'similarly-made', 'monster', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'arguably', 'set', 'standard', 'found', 'footage', 'way', 'making', 'movie.The', 'final', 'results', 'are', 'very', 'commendable', 'story', 'news', 'reporter', 'fellow', 'cameraman', 'tag', 'L.A.', 'fire', 'department', 'typical', 'call', 'arrive', 'aging', 'apartment', 'complex', 'discover', 'virus', 'quickly', 'spreading', 'building', 'tenant', 'tenant', 'When', 'group', 'escape', 'find', 'are', 'effectively', 'locked', 'CDC', 'word', 'what', 'happening.As', 'minutes', 'tick', 'quarantined', 'prisoners', 'complex', 'have', 'try', 'stay', 'alive', 'slowly', 'very', 'slowly', 'figure', 'out', 'cause', 'virus.I', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'movie', 'whole', 'thing', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'case', 'study', 'natural', 'selection', 'group', 'survivors', ""n't"", 'catch', 'very', 'quickly', 'Even', 'people', 'dying', 'still', 'treat', 'infected', 'kindness', 'continue', 'spring', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'misconception', 'audience', 'was', 'as', 'misinformed', 'characters', 'plot', 'what', 'little', 'very', 'slowly', 'most', 'development', 'happening', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'owner', 'building', 'think', 'up', 'new', 'ways', 'own', 'complex', 'random', 'times', 'always', 'minute', 'too', 'late', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'landlord', 'building', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'mind', 'suddenly', 'way', 'building', 'basement', 'Why', 'when', 'group', 'so', 'desperate', 'way', 'decide', 'withhold', 'information', 'chance', 'reaching', 'little', 'slip-ups', 'make', 'movie', 'annoying', 'times', 'quickly', 'away', 'zombies', 'start', 'growing', 'number', 'action', 'very', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'cool', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'shines', 'addition', 'first-person', 'filming', 'style', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'way', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'were', 'shot', 'wish', 'were', 'many', 'more', 'very', 'easy', 'get', 'wrong', 'Diary', 'Dead', '.If', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'placed', 'more', 'faith', 'audience', 'maybe', 'added', 'less', 'predictable', 'ending', 'then', 'Quarantine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'there', 'Cloverfield', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'instead', 'being', 'inferior', 'three', 'nice', 'addition', 'zombie', 'genre', 'very', 'nice', 'scares', 'action', 'even', 'might', 'only', 'stand', 'up', 'one', 'two', 'viewings.Perfect', 'rental', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'Cloverfield', 'fever.EXTRAS', 'very', 'long', 'list', 'trailers', 'couple', 'five-minute', 'long', 'Making-of', 'documentaries', 'commentary', 'Brothers', 'Dowdle']",N/A
1217854,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001MVYUQQ,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 4]","I'm not the kind of person to throw a fit over movie remakes. Some are good, some are bad. [REC] is one of my favorite modern horror movies since it practically came out of nowhere and managed to keep me interested every step of the way. I didn't know Quarantine was a remake of it until a few months ago (I pretty much ignored Quarantine when it first came out), so I finally gave it a shot to see how it stacked up against the original. Rather than saying that [REC] is better in every single way, I'll simply tell you that Quarantine is nearly a scene-for-scene remake of the original. As a result, I was getting bored with the movie about 1/3 of the way through. The only thing that really surprised me was a little bit more gore than what the original had, but that was it. If you've never seen [REC], then Quarantine should be a nice surprise. And hey, if you're one of those people that hates to ""read movies"", this one doesn't have subtitles.Quarantine is a 'found footage' horror movie, shot by a news cameraman who followed news reporter Angela Vidal during a segment that showed the daily life of firefighters in the city. Angela interviews the firemen, sees the different rooms in the station, finds out what they do in their free time at work, and even finds out a dirty little bet one of them has that involves her. After some time, the alarm sounds and they head off to an apartment building where an old woman seems to be having some kind of strange problem. Angela follows the firemen and police officer to the woman's room as they try to calm her down and take care of the situation. After a couple of minutes, the woman takes a bite out of a man's neck and it's clear that she's more than disturbed. Along with the firemen, Angela and her cameraman are locked in the building with several of the residents, including a mother and he young daughter, without any explanation. Even the police officer doesn't know what's going on and isn't getting any information. Time goes by, and more people begin to act violent, attacking the others. How do you survive while being locked inside a dark building with no way out? Breaking a window and climbing out isn't an option either- as military personnel have the building surrounded and are quick to take down anyone they can see. What's going on here?The title of the movie kind of gives away what the main problem is, and it's also the one whole difference between [REC] and Quarantine. I won't say much as to not spoil either movie, but where [REC] had a plot involving the Vatican, that's nowhere to be found here. Everything else is nearly identical to the original- even Angela's outfit towards the end! Not that I'm complaining about that one...but this is why I can't really give the movie a low rating. How can you give a lower rating to something that's essentially a translated version of something else? All the scares are still here, from a sudden drop to frantic chases. It may not have surprised me at all this time around, but again, if you never saw the original and this one is more accessible, then you'll probably get something out of it and enjoy it.I will say that my major complaint with Quarantine is that this movie's Angela Vidal is nowhere near as cool as the original's. Here, she's basically just there for us to follow around since the cameraman works with her. Original Angela had no problem taking charge and standing up for herself. To be blunt, this movie's star is boring. The cameraman is ok, but his camerawork seems to lack dynamic too. The funny thing is that here we get to see a bit more than what was shown in [REC] as far as the gore and violence goes, partially due to the lightning and angles. Apart from Angela's average performance, the rest of the acting was above average, though the apartment residents don't get much screen time, and the ones that do aren't the most interesting ones.It seems like I have more complaints than pros to say about Quarantine, but that's just because I saw it after the original, which I've seen several times. Quarantine is still a fine horror movie that isn't a toned down version of the original.

Yes, it's an example of a serious and debilitating problem in the US horror movie genre right now in that it's a remake of another movie.  I'm sure most horror fans like myself are tired of seeing unnecessary remakes of classic horror movies we've already seen and are ready to see some original stories being written.  However, when the film in question is a remake of a foreign-language film and it sticks to the original concept and story, then I don't have so much of a problem.  And so it is with ""Quarantine"".Yes, it's a remake of the Spanish movie [*REC].  Since the two films are almost identical, I prefer this one since I don't have to take my eyes off the action to read subtitles.  ""Quarantine"" is a claustrophobic, tense, and chilling little film and I enjoyed it very, very much.  Jennifer Carpenter put in a great performance, as did the rest of the cast, and if you enjoy good horror movies you will enjoy this one.  Is it a milestone in the horror film genre?  No.  But then again, milestones are few and far between, hence the term.  I *can* tell you that ""Quarantine"" is the most memorable horror film I've seen since it premiered in US theaters and pretty much kept me on the edge of my seat once things kicked into gear.My only qualm with the DVD release is the price.  $19.95 for a single edition DVD with so few extras?

It has only the slightest of originality, in its setting. But non-stop screamfests, just for the sake of being a screamfest, wear thin. Especially when efforts by the protagonists seem futile. I've always wanted just a simple zombie gore-fest w/ no point. Now that I got it, I wasn't much impressed. There has to be some type of story line that at least implies hope.. Without it, all you have is a ""Friday the 13th"" league slasher. Anyone can make those. They have their fans-I used to be one of them. But nowadays I like some type of statement to be made, or at the very least a certain degree of plausibility, within the rules the genre or a particular movie sets for itself. In that manner, the standard George Romero set has rarely been met, though you can see his influence in this movie. My holding such movies to that standard may not be entirely fair. Those type of flicks are fine for some. Completely unacceptable to many others, including me. This movie reminds me a lot of ""Cabin Fever,"" in its futility. I liked neither. I'm very scrutinizing when it comes to my horror flicks these days I guess. For all I sat through in this movie, when the credits rolled, I was extremely dissatisfied.",1,Not impressed.

1217862,A244T2V6PVFCZ6,B001MVYUQQ,"Brett ""Reviewer""","[0, 1]","""Quarantine"" explores an interesting idea: what if a group of people were suddenly quarantined within a building, among infected and highly dangerous individuals, and forced to try and survive? The story centers around a female reporter who is doing a show on a fire-fighter station within Los Angeles. With her cameraman filming the entire process (the show's format is that it is filmed entirely from the camera of the cameraman within the show, much like ""Cloverfield"" or ""Blair Witch Project""), the reporter accompanies the firefighters on a mission to provide medical assistance to a sick woman. The woman turns dangerous, and suddenly they and the residents of the apartment building find themselves sealed in by the US government and military.The story progresses from there, showing the characters' reactions to the situation, as well as their attempts at surviving the dangerous and sick individuals and animals within the building. Eventually, the basis of the quarantine is revealed, but until then it remains a well-acted, largely fast-moving show.The main weakness with the story is that there are several moments where you want to slap the characters. While some stupid decisions are expected (these are people in a highly frightening and unfamiliar situation), the characters make repeated mistakes that pull you out of the film. The show also suffers from some pacing issues at the beginning - it takes a while for the ""quarantine"" situation to emerge after a slow segment at the beginning of the film.Nonetheless, it is a reasonably well-done horror film, with a basis in reality.",4,Interesting premise with some issues concerning execution,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,1597,"['Quarantine', 'interesting', 'idea', 'what', 'group', 'people', 'were', 'suddenly', 'quarantined', 'building', 'infected', 'highly', 'dangerous', 'individuals', 'forced', 'try', 'survive', 'story', 'centers', 'female', 'reporter', 'who', 'doing', 'show', 'fire-fighter', 'station', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'cameraman', 'filming', 'entire', 'process', 'show', 'format', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'camera', 'cameraman', 'show', 'much', 'Cloverfield', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'reporter', 'firefighters', 'mission', 'provide', 'medical', 'assistance', 'sick', 'woman', 'woman', 'dangerous', 'suddenly', 'residents', 'apartment', 'building', 'find', 'sealed', 'US', 'government', 'military.The', 'story', 'progresses', 'there', 'showing', 'characters', 'reactions', 'situation', 'as', 'well', 'attempts', 'surviving', 'dangerous', 'sick', 'individuals', 'animals', 'building', 'Eventually', 'basis', 'quarantine', 'revealed', 'then', 'well-acted', 'largely', 'fast-moving', 'show.The', 'main', 'weakness', 'story', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'where', 'want', 'slap', 'characters', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'are', 'expected', 'are', 'people', 'highly', 'frightening', 'unfamiliar', 'situation', 'characters', 'make', 'repeated', 'mistakes', 'pull', 'film', 'show', 'also', 'pacing', 'issues', 'beginning', 'while', 'quarantine', 'situation', 'emerge', 'slow', 'segment', 'beginning', 'film.Nonetheless', 'reasonably', 'well-done', 'horror', 'film', 'basis', 'reality']",N/A

Others hate it because it was a frame for frame remake of Rec.  Still others hate it becuase the characters don't act the way they wanted them to.  This film really seemed to strike a nerve around here.  Look at the reviews for most other Amazon titles.  You will rarely see such a mixed bag.Jeez...I'm glad I didn't read these reviews before seeing it for myself.  I whole-heartedly enjoyed it.  It very much had a Cloverfield feel, but with a rampaging virus instead of a monster.  I didn't see any Resident Evil in this movie - it was much better than that.  This film was solidly Cloverfield meets 28 Days Later.The ending is no surprise; we all know that we are watching a video of the recorded events.  That of course gives us no reason to root for our heriones to see the light of day - no reason to become too attached to them or care for their safety.  Nevertheless, I like the fact that the filmakers gave us 10 minutes to meet the main characters.  Even that small connection to them was important.If I was forced to find a single negative about this film, it would be that it is unlikely that a camaeraman would film the events as well as he did once his survival was at stake.  I'd think the camera would be used as little more than a flashlight at that point.  Cloverfield did a better job of explaining the camera, as the cameraman felt as though the video would be his legacy - that he knew he wouldn't survive the day.Putting that minor point aside, this was really a great film.",5,"Picky, picky people.

The reporter actress carries the acting portion well, especially in the last 10 minutes, without saying a word.The ""reality show"" camera work was at first annoying.  As the action began, I understood the effects the director/writer intended.  Vision is limited and thus, the intensity and shock-factor increased.  Again, I was surprised to be able to enjoy it.And a bonus: the idea of the reason for the ""quarantine"" is almost plausible.

It lends a natural hysteria and suspense to the atmosphere. What I don't like about it in this film is that this is a professional camera guy who cannot keep the darn thing still, even in the calmest parts. I understand in the ""amateur"" shot films such as ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch"" that the person behind the lens doesn't understand that all the bouncing around is distracting.The story is about a news crew, consisting of two people, doing a story about firefighters. When these firefighters get a call, they naturally tag along to get a more in depth piece. It's a medical call, and when they get to the building they realize it's more serious than just some old person in possible trouble, and soon they are in full quarantine locked inside with people who have gone murderous with some sort of uncontrollable rage. They aren't zombies at all, they are alive but infected, and that makes them even stronger. All the people stuck in this building are in shock that the police and CDC would allow them to be picked off one by one and not lift a finger to help, so they take matters into their own hands, and plan a way out that is invisible to all the people watching the building for a breach of containment.The circumstances are pretty well explained, and make sense in a round a bout way, enough to where you aren't saying ""shenanigans"", but still in the end it's not quite tied up in a neat little frothy bow, and you are left with a sense of incompletion and dismay. I wasn't scared at all during the whole thing, I cringed a few times because it's very bloody and violent and you are rooting for the survivors to make it through so you get invested in their well being.

1217874,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001MVYUQQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","The director of ""Quarantine"" is John Erick Dowdle, but since his film borrows so heavily from three other directors, they probably deserve just as much credit. One is George A. Romero, who basically reinvented the zombie genre with the original 1968 version of ""Night of the Living Dead."" In ""Quarantine,"" a group of survivors are trapped in a building with infected flesh-eating monsters. Subtler ideas also come into play: a young girl showing signs of fever; a TV set that displays a scrambled news report; the vague explanation that it's caused by some kind of virus. To be fair, I'm not entirely sure that the zombies in this film are dead, as they are in Romero's film. They are, however, mentally altered to the point of base animal instincts. And they bite people. The other two directors are Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S&aacute;nchez, who introduced the world to the Queasy Cam with ""The Blair Witch Project."" ""Quarantine"" is shot entirely with a handheld news camera, often in dark corridors with only the camera's light to guide the characters along. Is something hiding in the corner there? Look out!Jaume Balaguer&oacute; and Paco Plaza are the only filmmakers credited for inspiring ""Quarantine."" They wrote and directed ""[REC],"" a 2007 Spanish movie about a young TV news reporter, a cameraman, and the shocking footage they capture in an isolated building. That's right, folks--""Quarantine"" is an American remake of a foreign horror film. I'm not at all surprised by this, considering the popularity of films like ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""Shutter,"" ""The Eye,"" and ""Mirrors."" Is this to say that ""Quarantine"" is a bad movie? I wouldn't quite go that far; it's not at all an original story, but it does get the job done. Barely.The foundation of the plot (provided by the ads but not by the film itself): On March 11, 2008, the government sealed off an apartment complex in Los Angeles. No one inside the building was ever seen again. Thanks to newly discovered camera footage, the truth of what happened that night is now open to the public. It's an interesting setup, although when you think about it logically, it's unlikely the footage would ever be found, and that's because it's difficult to imagine anyone going back into complex. Isn't the point of quarantining to permanently seal everyone off? Be that as it may, the film opens with a news reporter named Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman, Scott (Steve Harris), covering a story about Los Angeles firefighters at night. After some friendly banter, the alarm sounds. Angela and Scott tag along in one of the fire trucks. They end up at an old apartment complex where, apparently, an old woman has been screaming. They go upstairs and find Ms. Espinoza (Jeannie Epper), half-crazed and apparently foaming at the mouth. And then an even crazier person jumps out of the darkness and attacks. Not long after, the authorities surround the building and refuse to let anyone out.Do I really need to describe the rest of the plot? I'm sure you have a pretty good idea of where this is going. But there is something I'm curious about. It seems awfully convenient that a veterinarian just happens to be one of the tenants, and isn't it nice that he just happens to speculate that the infected have some mutated strain of rabies? If Dowdle trusted his audience, if he truly believed in what he was doing, he would have just let the scenes happen. He would not have tried to provide us with an explanation, not even a vague one. And he certainly wouldn't have included the final five minutes, which involves a multitude of newspaper clippings with the oddest headlines. It only worsens the confusion over the rabies theory. All we needed was the scene of the TV showing the scrambled news report; it might have been ripped off from ""Night of the Living Dead,"" but at least it was a genuinely tense moment. It helped that the power was completely cut off just as the last vital bits of information got through.As I said before, it would be too much to call this a bad movie. Some of it is actually quite scary, due in large part to both the lack of lighting and the unsteady camerawork. What a reliable technique for a horror film. It was successfully used this year in ""Cloverfield,"" a film that achieved greatness because it chose to not explain anything. It just happened, as it would in real life (were such a thing possible). ""Quarantine"" would have been much better if it had been allowed to do the same.Here's a word of warning: If you've seen the trailer, then you already know how the movie is going to end. Too bad the final shot was also one of the most chilling--I don't think it would have been included in the trailer had it not been. And be aware that not everyone will be able to tolerate nearly ninety minutes of the Queasy Cam, which only gets shakier as the film progresses. While I'm not recommending ""Quarantine,"" I did find some of it intriguing. There was one scene in particular that I enjoyed a great deal; when a zombie attacks Scott, he uses the camera to bludgeon it to death. Within two or three blows to the head, spatters of blood cover the entire lens. It's an interesting perspective, to say the least. It's also one of the few original ideas this movie had to offer. Everything else is an example of what has already been done. This isn't a good sign, because in all honesty, I'm not sure future zombie films will be able to give us anything new.",3,"Zombies Take Over, News at Eleven",1223683200,"10 11,

It is the things we do not see in the darkness, the things we see in our own minds, that make these types of movies appealing.  Quarantine is a good movie.  It could have been a great movie.  It is good for the darkness, the ""follow me around and film"" quality.  The acting does not seem contrived, for the most part, it does seem candid.  The first half is predictable and that is not a bad thing.  Zombie movies are usually predictable.  People get trapped with people that are infected.  Slaughter occurs.  The problem with the movie is that past the first half, someone told Jennifer Carpenter to start freaking out.  A little freak-out would have been fine.  But the continuous screaming was grating.  It was out of character for the tough fun loving reporter that was portrayed at the beginning.  I was ready to turn it off.  Thankfully, it did not go on to the end -- and at that point -- the ""quiet"" was now out of character for Carpenter.  I am not sure what the director thought they were doing.  Blair Witch Project was a quiet horror film.  Breathing is enough to create panic in a viewers mind.  Screaming was over the top in Quarantine.  So Quarantine gets an A for concept and camera work.  It gets a C for execution in the second half.  It gets a B for less development than expected of the perceived details of the infection.  And, without revealing the end (!), an A for the end....If you can work through the incessant screaming, and get to the end.  This is a short film, and it works -- it just difficult to listen to.",3,"Nice concept, but less screaming next time",1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,1653,"['love', 'zombie', 'movies', 'love', 'idea', 'ala', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'creating', 'first', 'person', 'raw-amateur', 'account', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'darkness', 'things', 'see', 'own', 'minds', 'make', 'types', 'movies', 'appealing', 'Quarantine', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'darkness', 'follow', 'film', 'quality', 'acting', 'not', 'seem', 'contrived', 'most', 'part', 'seem', 'candid', 'first', 'half', 'predictable', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'predictable', 'People', 'get', 'trapped', 'people', 'are', 'infected', 'Slaughter', 'problem', 'movie', 'first', 'half', 'someone', 'told', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'start', 'freaking', 'out', 'little', 'freak-out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'continuous', 'screaming', 'was', 'grating', 'was', 'character', 'tough', 'fun', 'loving', 'reporter', 'was', 'portrayed', 'beginning', 'was', 'ready', 'turn', 'off', 'Thankfully', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'end', 'point', 'quiet', 'was', 'now', 'character', 'Carpenter', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'director', 'thought', 'were', 'doing', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', 'quiet', 'horror', 'film', 'Breathing', 'enough', 'create', 'panic', 'viewers', 'mind', 'Screaming', 'was', 'top', 'Quarantine', 'So', 'Quarantine', 'A', 'concept', 'camera', 'work', 'C', 'execution', 'second', 'half', 'B', 'less', 'development', 'expected', 'perceived', 'details', 'infection', 'revealing', 'end', 'A', 'end', 'can', 'work', 'incessant', 'screaming', 'get', 'end', 'short', 'film', 'just', 'difficult', 'listen']",N/A

1217879,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001MVYUQQ,Dave. K,"[1, 3]","QUARANTINE****  Out of 5Release Date- October 10th, 2008Running Time- 89-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- John Erick Dowdle & Drew DowdleDirector- John Erick DowdleStarring- Jennifer Carpenter, Jay Hernandez, Johnathon Schaech, Columbus ShortQuarantine is a remake of the 2007 film REC, which I haven't seen since there is no region 1 release. I always try and see the originals before the remakes, but in this case I wasn't able to so I'll be reviewing Quarantine as its own movie since I cannot compare it to the original version.The latest fad in Hollywood is the documentary look, which was made famous by The Blair Witch Project even though Cannibal Holocaust did that first. But with the recent movies like George Romero's Diary of the Dead and Cloverfield this look is now in. And another fad right now is making zombie movies where they aren't exactly zombies, which has also been done plenty of times with flicks like I Drink Your Blood and Romero's The Crazies. But since Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later a lot of filmmakers are doing movies that follow the zombie movie formula and the infected act like zombies, but they aren't actually zombies.Going into Quarantine I really wasn't expecting much from it at all; and quite honestly it turned out a lot better than I thought it would. In my opinion Quarantine ranks as one of the best horror films of 2008 and the only movie I'd give the edge to is Eden Lake, but Quarantine comes close and like I said to me it's one of the best of 2008.The screenplay by John Erick Dowdle & Drew Dowdle is the only real flaw of the movie. While not poorly written or anything the characters lack any depth and are barley developed. In many ways the characters really are nothing more than faceless victims. I suppose the viewer might be able to sympathize with some, but odds are you probably won't connect with the characters. Quarantine is one of those movies that odds are you won't remember the names of most if not all of the characters. The screenplay isn't bad or anything; the structure is overall well done and it works well, but the only real flaw was the lack of character development.Director John Erick Dowdle manages to make up for any flaws with the script with the direction. His scenes are well paced and with the visual look he's able to create a movie that feels real. Quarantine in my opinion is quite intense; once we get to the apartment complex the suspense and tension kick in right away and John Erick Dowdle is able to sustain that for pretty much the entire running time. I'm not one to scare easy when you've seen as many horror films as I have it gets even harder and while I can't say I was ever really scared I did find several scenes to be downright creepy. I thought for sure Quarantine would run out of steam, but it never does and in my opinion always manages to stay suspenseful and creepy. Like I said I found this one quite intense, but towards the end I did find it to slightly drag, but it still keeps the suspense level high even if it does slightly drag.Some people have complained about the shaky cam and in most cases I agree with those complaints, but I found it to work well here and I didn't mind it at all and the look of the film is great and eerie.The performances were mostly strong despite the characters lacking any depth. Jennifer Carpenter delivers a terrific performance. The only other movie I have seen with her is The Exorcism of Emily Rose and I thought she was brilliant in that. Here in Quarantine her performance was a lot of fun early on before the horror started and when it did start she really nailed it. I may not have seen much of her work, but I'm 100% sold on her talents as an actress. Jay Hernandez an actor who I quite like makes the best out of his character and like Carpenter, brings more to the role than what was written.Quarantine may not be the perfect horror movie, but it does succeed in what it aims for; I was quite surprised at how much I really enjoyed this one. Quarantine may not break any new ground in the horror genre, but it does get the job done and is quite creepy and suspenseful.As for the Blu-ray; the features are the same as the DVD and are really lame also the features are in standard definition and not HD; due to the look of the film and due to all the scenes being set in the dark you don't get the full HD experience. That's not to say the transfer isn't good; the HD looks great, but don't expect to be blown away by it; the sound however I found to be strong.",5,Far better than I expected,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,4504,"['QUARANTINE****', 'Out', '5Release', 'Date-', 'October', '10th', '2008Running', 'Time-', '89-MinutesRating-', 'RScreenplay-', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'Drew', 'DowdleDirector-', 'John', 'Erick', 'DowdleStarring-', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'Columbus', 'ShortQuarantine', 'remake', '2007', 'film', 'REC', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'region', '1', 'release', 'always', 'try', 'see', 'originals', 'remakes', 'case', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reviewing', 'Quarantine', 'own', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'original', 'version.The', 'latest', 'fad', 'Hollywood', 'documentary', 'look', 'was', 'made', 'famous', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'even', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'did', 'first', 'recent', 'movies', 'George', 'Romero', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'Cloverfield', 'look', 'now', 'fad', 'right', 'now', 'making', 'zombie', 'movies', 'where', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'zombies', 'also', 'been', 'done', 'plenty', 'times', 'flicks', 'Drink', 'Blood', 'Romero', 'Crazies', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'lot', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'doing', 'movies', 'follow', 'zombie', 'movie', 'formula', 'infected', 'act', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'actually', 'zombies.Going', 'Quarantine', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'quite', 'honestly', 'turned', 'out', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'opinion', 'Quarantine', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', '2008', 'only', 'movie', ""'d"", 'give', 'edge', 'Eden', 'Lake', 'Quarantine', 'close', 'said', 'one', 'best', '2008.The', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'Drew', 'Dowdle', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'movie', 'not', 'poorly', 'written', 'anything', 'characters', 'lack', 'depth', 'are', 'barley', 'developed', 'many', 'ways', 'characters', 'really', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'faceless', 'victims', 'suppose', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'sympathize', 'odds', 'are', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'connect', 'characters', 'Quarantine', 'one', 'movies', 'odds', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'names', 'most', 'not', 'characters', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'bad', 'anything', 'structure', 'overall', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'was', 'lack', 'character', 'development.Director', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'script', 'direction', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'visual', 'look', 'able', 'create', 'movie', 'real', 'Quarantine', 'opinion', 'quite', 'intense', 'once', 'get', 'apartment', 'complex', 'suspense', 'tension', 'kick', 'right', 'away', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'able', 'sustain', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'running', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'scare', 'easy', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'even', 'harder', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'ever', 'really', 'scared', 'did', 'find', 'several', 'scenes', 'be', 'downright', 'creepy', 'thought', 'sure', 'Quarantine', 'would', 'run', 'steam', 'never', 'opinion', 'always', 'stay', 'suspenseful', 'creepy', 'said', 'found', 'one', 'quite', 'intense', 'end', 'did', 'find', 'slightly', 'drag', 'still', 'suspense', 'level', 'high', 'even', 'slightly', 'drag.Some', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'shaky', 'cam', 'most', 'cases', 'agree', 'complaints', 'found', 'work', 'well', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'look', 'film', 'great', 'eerie.The', 'performances', 'were', 'mostly', 'strong', 'characters', 'lacking', 'depth', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'terrific', 'performance', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Here', 'Quarantine', 'performance', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'early', 'horror', 'started', 'when', 'did', 'start', 'really', 'nailed', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'work', ""'m"", '100', '%', 'sold', 'talents', 'actress', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'actor', 'who', 'quite', 'like', 'best', 'character', 'Carpenter', 'more', 'role', 'what', 'was', 'written.Quarantine', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'horror', 'movie', 'succeed', 'what', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Quarantine', 'may', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'horror', 'genre', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'quite', 'creepy', 'suspenseful.As', 'Blu-ray', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'DVD', 'are', 'really', 'lame', 'also', 'features', 'are', 'standard', 'definition', 'not', 'HD', 'due', 'look', 'film', 'due', 'scenes', 'being', 'set', 'dark', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'HD', 'experience', 'not', 'say', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'good', 'HD', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'sound', 'however', 'found', 'be', 'strong']",N/A

But that's just me ...The first fourteen minutes of the film (I timed it), are absolutely excruciating. An awkward news-reporter and her cameraman are shooting a piece on the ""changing face of the fire-department."" This team meanders around the station, gathering mundane interviews and intruding in the men's shower-room (a scene not in Balaguero's original film). (Though this feet-dragging eternity should contrast the ""fast-paced"" events to follow, the film really never ""picked-up"" for me). Sooo, after enduring nearly fifteen minutes of bad/boring/distasteful/obvious ""hose"" jokes, the alarm rings and the audience is transported the second (and final) location: an apartment building (And, thus the title Quarantine).The expansive cast means that the audience never establishes a connection with any particular person. As a result, there is no sense of loss when a character dies. More importantly, there is no sense of shock. ""Oh, another person died ... okay."" Other films about infection/pandemics have handily dealt with this problem. Boyle's28 Days Lateraddresses the results of a massive Ebola/rabies outbreak, but tracks a small group ... the audience aligns itself with them. Here, a death is both shocking and terrifying ... the audience ""takes it personally."" Synder's remake of Romero'sDawn of the Deadhas an epic cast. The director closely developed a few characters and their deaths have impact (especially in the director's cut). Clever tactic. With Quarantine, the audience struggles to recall a single name ... and in some cases, the audience sees an infected person and thinks, ""Who was that? When did he/she become infected?!"" This confusion distances the audience. We just don't/can't care.Let's talk about the camera work. The entire film is told through the cameraman's lens. Translation: the ENTIRE work is deliberately shaky, deliberately unfocused (at times), and occasionally disorienting. Those who suffer from motion-sickness might not be able to tolerate this work (now, I am completely vulnerable to motion-sickness and felt fine). Personally, I am bored with this approach. WhenThe Blair Witch Projectused the first-person hand-helds, audiences took notice (I'm not saying it was a great film, mind you). WhenCloverfieldtinkered with this idea, audiences were still receptive. Now, it's just played-out. I didn't find the constant dropping of the camera ""tense,"" I didn't find depending on the camera for light ""nail-biting"" ... I found it annoying.***possible spoiler -- skip to next paragraph if you have not yet seen the film***So, what's good about this work? I appreciated the commentary on new technology vs. old technology. (Though the second I saw ""first-person camera,"" I knew how the film would conclude ... and ummm, a big sarcastic thanks to all involved in promotions for giving the ending away in the trailers and the posters! The entire audience was furiously discussing this as the credits ran). And, I liked the sense of claustrophobia (there are a few parallels to Marshall'sThe Descent, so you may be ""in luck"" if you enjoyed that film).Listen, extreme close-ups of disemboweled animals, compound fractures, and foamy ""strangers"" don't ""do it"" for me. But it may for you!! Some people really like a visceral experience and care less about plot or character-development. However, if you are not in this group, my advice would be to avoid Quarantine. If you are looking for a great ""zed-word"" film, buy/rent Synder or Boyle's work (and while it's WAY old-school, Cronenberg'sRabidis pretty amazing). Moreover, if you are seeking a great film on communicable diseases, Petersen'sOutbreakhas some seriously suspenseful moments.Avoid Quarantine ... like the plague.",1,Full of Sound and Fury (So Saith Zombie-Shakespeare).,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,4044,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'like', 'films', 'are', 'heavy', 'close-up', 'gore', 'cheap-scares', 'meaning', 'surprise', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'moments', 'may', 'still', 'like', 'film', 'prefer', 'horror', 'bit', 'more', 'cerebral', 'horror', 'hooks', 'subconscious', 'surfaces', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'sweaty', 'nightmares', 'just', 'first', 'fourteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'timed', 'are', 'absolutely', 'excruciating', 'awkward', 'news-reporter', 'cameraman', 'are', 'shooting', 'piece', 'changing', 'face', 'fire-department', 'team', 'station', 'gathering', 'mundane', 'interviews', 'intruding', 'men', 'shower-room', 'scene', 'not', 'Balaguero', 'original', 'film', 'feet-dragging', 'eternity', 'should', 'contrast', 'fast-paced', 'events', 'follow', 'film', 'really', 'never', 'picked-up', 'Sooo', 'enduring', 'nearly', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'bad/boring/distasteful/obvious', 'hose', 'jokes', 'alarm', 'rings', 'audience', 'transported', 'second', 'final', 'location', 'apartment', 'building', 'thus', 'title', 'Quarantine', '.The', 'expansive', 'cast', 'audience', 'never', 'connection', 'particular', 'person', 'result', 'sense', 'loss', 'when', 'character', 'More', 'importantly', 'sense', 'shock', 'Oh', 'person', 'died', 'okay', 'Other', 'films', 'infection/pandemics', 'have', 'handily', 'dealt', 'problem', ""Boyle's28"", 'Days', 'results', 'massive', 'Ebola/rabies', 'outbreak', 'small', 'group', 'audience', 'aligns', 'Here', 'death', 'shocking', 'terrifying', 'audience', 'personally', 'Synder', 'remake', ""Romero'sDawn"", 'Deadhas', 'epic', 'cast', 'director', 'closely', 'developed', 'few', 'characters', 'deaths', 'have', 'impact', 'especially', 'director', 'cut', 'Clever', 'tactic', 'Quarantine', 'audience', 'recall', 'single', 'name', 'cases', 'audience', 'infected', 'person', 'thinks', 'Who', 'was', 'When', 'did', 'he/she', 'become', 'infected', 'confusion', 'audience', 'just', ""don't/ca"", ""n't"", 'care.Let', 'talk', 'camera', 'work', 'entire', 'film', 'told', 'cameraman', 'lens', 'Translation', 'ENTIRE', 'work', 'deliberately', 'shaky', 'deliberately', 'unfocused', 'times', 'occasionally', 'disorienting', 'who', 'suffer', 'motion-sickness', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tolerate', 'work', 'now', 'am', 'completely', 'vulnerable', 'motion-sickness', 'felt', 'fine', 'Personally', 'am', 'bored', 'approach', 'WhenThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Projectused', 'first-person', 'hand-helds', 'audiences', 'took', 'notice', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'WhenCloverfieldtinkered', 'idea', 'audiences', 'were', 'still', 'receptive', 'Now', 'just', 'played-out', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'constant', 'dropping', 'camera', 'tense', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'depending', 'camera', 'light', 'nail-biting', 'found', 'annoying', '***possible', 'spoiler', 'skip', 'next', 'paragraph', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film***So', 'what', 'good', 'work', 'appreciated', 'commentary', 'new', 'technology', 'vs.', 'old', 'technology', 'second', 'saw', 'first-person', 'camera', 'knew', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'conclude', 'ummm', 'big', 'sarcastic', 'thanks', 'involved', 'promotions', 'giving', 'ending', 'away', 'trailers', 'posters', 'entire', 'audience', 'was', 'furiously', 'discussing', 'credits', 'ran', 'liked', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'are', 'few', 'parallels', ""Marshall'sThe"", 'Descent', 'may', 'be', 'luck', 'enjoyed', 'film', '.Listen', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'disemboweled', 'animals', 'compound', 'fractures', 'foamy', 'strangers', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'may', 'people', 'really', 'visceral', 'experience', 'care', 'less', 'plot', 'character-development', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'group', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'avoid', 'Quarantine', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'zed-word', 'film', 'buy/rent', 'Synder', 'Boyle', 'work', 'WAY', 'old-school', ""Cronenberg'sRabidis"", 'pretty', 'amazing', 'Moreover', 'are', 'seeking', 'great', 'film', 'communicable', 'diseases', ""Petersen'sOutbreakhas"", 'seriously', 'suspenseful', 'moments.Avoid', 'Quarantine', 'plague']",N/A

If you've seen the trailer, you know what happens next...they are quarantined and what lurks in the hallways isn't welcoming their visit.It's been a while since a zombie movie has come out that was flat out suspenseful and scary.  ""28 Days Later"" was the last film to do so and since then the zombie genre has been relatively dead (no pun intended).  With ""Quarantine"" we get a revival of the genre, at least temporarily.  The scares were a plenty, the zombies were biting, and gore wasn't held back either.  Also, the movie was shot in the same cinematic style as ""Cloverfield"", but it proved advantageous to the film.  The use of this style enhanced the scares and the suspense and made you feel as if you were there.""Quarantine"" is a great way to open the Halloween season for movies.

So she films herself hanging out with and playing around with the firemen waiting to get some really good footage. She finally gets her wish when the alarm goes off and every one is rushing to the fire trucks. When they come across the building the call came from they notice it is not on fire, but something wicked is waiting inside. Turns out that there are some infected people inside and they are hungry for flesh, remind you of something.

And while this movie is not horrible it is the weaker of the two in my opinion. This one just seems uneven at times to me and losses its realness after a while, the first half of this film is great though. At first this film feels more like a documentary for real but half way through it goes into a ""Cloverfield"" feel.

I say that as compared to other remakes of this kind because this one at least does have some creepy moments. There is some great behind the scenes footage that shows how these guys filmed this movie, interesting stuff and they do a good job on the commentary. As far as the acting every one is solid and believable in the situation, I was really surprised by that.This is a decent movie that I fond to be entertaining enough for at least a rental, my Bro agreed with me on that.

I didn't find myself shocked or scared for even a second in the movie and was thoroughly bored. Out of anything, it was Ms. Carpenter's character that was the scariest here...mostly annoying. It made me angry, even. Just seeing how the press might behave when covering something might be spot-on, but it irritated the heck out of me. Like, they just capture something amazing and surprising on camera, with people shot or eaten. ""Did you get that?"" she asks the cameraman. Or when she was interviewing Brianna. The mother was in the background and said something in agreement about how Brianna was brave. The lady basically told the mother to shut up and that it's not good for an interview because it confuses the audience if someone off-screen speaks. Right away, I said out loud ""What a jackass."" If it was me, I'd have said ""Well, forget you. If that's how you are, then this interview is over."" I would be thinking that I wouldn't want to help her get some good ratings and she wouldn't use my daughter (the only kid there) for them.I also hate how so many women characters are whiny and weak in the movies. That doesn't have to always be in scary flicks. After Carpenter's character was spooked out for a while, I'd have liked this more if she kicked butt. Pull some H2O/Jamie Lee action and lop off someone head with an axe, for crying out loud!So, this is apparently a rip-off of ""[rec]"". I haven't seen that, but this is evidently just a remake showing again that American moviemakers just love to redo other's ideas and hope that they do better. They speak of wanting to do justice to the original or be a tribute -- but more times than usual, they fail.Oooh, I have a great idea! See that little girl foaming at the mouth? Well, my voice is so soothing, there's nothing to worry about. 'C'mon, honey. Take my hand. Everything will be fine.' Hey...help!

Previews make it look like people are trapped in an old building with zombies running amok in it. Maybe they came up from the sewers.In fact it follows a reality TV reporter who is following an LA fire crew on calls. They go to a building when neighbors have reported screams coming from the apartment of an old lady. What follows is the outbreak of a savage, mind destroying disease where tenants and first responders find them sealed in with those already infected, by the CDC.Like Cloverfield and Blair Witch, the film is shot from the single camera view of the reality reporter's camera man. Unlike those films the camera work is clean and does not distract the viewer. Watch the long shot when a call comes as the camera man has to follow the reporter down a hall, a flight of stairs and into a truck and realize it was all done in one take without cuts. The first 20 minutes of the film are the  `reality show' walking around the fire house, talking to members of the fire crew and setting the stage by letting you meet the key players in the film. This is clearly the set up but it doesn't feel stilted. You don't feel like saying `get on with it"" because you care about the characters. Carpenter, as the on air talent is likeable and believable, going from bubbly on air talent, to real reporter as things turn serious to scared human as she realizes just how deep in they are. And she takes the viewer with her.Previews make this look like just another zombie film. There are certainly elements of that in Quarantine but for the genre it is so much better than much of the competition. They even have an explanation, scary in how reasonable it is, for what is happening. Is it ""Sound of Music?"" of course not.

Do you love watching film where you're not sure who's talking because the person holding the camera decided to put it down to get a beer, or gave you a five minute clip of their feet because they forgot to turn the camera off while they were strolling around? Do you love to see rehashed versions of the zombie plague, and wished someone would try to waste time explaining another way this ""could happen to you,"" legitimately? Are you a conspiracy theorist? If you said yes to all of these questions, you still probably shouldn't watch Quarantine.Quarantine is a remake of the Spanish movie Rec, filmed way back in 2007. The premise is simple: a lowly news reporter(played by Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman(Steve Harris) are shooting a special interest story on a fire-house in Los Angeles. After some rowdy behavior and horrible jokes, we learn that all of the firemen want to get into Carpenter's pants. The firemen get a medical call, and they rush to the rescue, with reporting crew on-hand. However, this isn't a routine medical call, and the group must try to survive as the government keeps them secured in an apartment building while they and the residents succumb to a fatal, zombie-inducing disease.Where to begin? The story itself isn't all that bad. As with any zombie story, there is usually some asinine way that a zombie plague starts, whether it be a biological weapon, voodoo, or ""it just happens."" So I can deal with the explanation of an accelerated form of rabies that makes people crazy and want to eat other people, even if it has already been done(see 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later). However, the initial scene at the fire-house, where everything is normal as the news reporter covers her in-depth analysis of the lives of firemen, drags on forever. It must be only 10 minutes of the movie, but it felt like an hour. You'd think maybe they could show some basic character traits to develop later on in the movie, but no, they get around that rather quickly.The camera-work really killed this movie. I know, it's meant to put you in the movie, and make things more suspenseful when you don't know what's really going on. However, it's been done too much in such a short time, and better every single time. Cloverfield, Diary of The Dead, the Spanish version of this film, all following suit of The Blair Witch Project . It didn't make things suspenseful. All it did was let the special effects crew be lazy with the gore, disrupt any notion of a story-line, and give me a headache.The only good thing to come out of this camera-view narration was when the cameraman bashes a zombie in the face, giving us a great view of its dental work. We could have had that, if they broke up the camera view a bit. Maybe mixing it into some normal shooting would have been better for the movie. It would have helped some views that could have made this movie(such as the dog and guy in the elevator scene) and helped to fix some scenes that were more annoying than interesting(such as the opening of the movie at the fire-house.) There was also a point that we saw a topless zombie in a diaper. I thought, ""Hey, at least we're getting some full frontal nudity,"" until my friends corrected me that it was actually an old man.To be fair, the acting wasn't horrible. The apartment residents, cops, doctors, and the cameraman did a great job of keeping things suspenseful, as much as they could with a hand-held camera anyway. Jennifer Carpenter was another matter. Overreactions of her as a news reporter at the beginning made it seem that she was overreacting throught the movie, in order to make her video a piece of sensationalism. Even when we see her come to terms with the reality of what's going on after Mrs. Espinoza is shot, it seems trite. Maybe it is because she keeps looking at the damn camera.",2,This Movie Should Be Quarantined.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,3877,"['Sorry', 'cheesy', 'title.Do', 'love', 'amateur', 'home', 'movies', 'Do', 'love', 'watching', 'film', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'talking', 'person', 'holding', 'camera', 'decided', 'put', 'down', 'get', 'beer', 'gave', 'five', 'minute', 'clip', 'feet', 'forgot', 'turn', 'camera', 'off', 'were', 'strolling', 'around', 'Do', 'love', 'see', 'rehashed', 'versions', 'zombie', 'plague', 'wished', 'someone', 'would', 'try', 'waste', 'time', 'explaining', 'way', 'could', 'happen', 'legitimately', 'Are', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'said', 'yes', 'questions', 'still', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Quarantine.Quarantine', 'remake', 'Spanish', 'movie', 'Rec', 'filmed', 'way', 'back', '2007', 'premise', 'simple', 'lowly', 'news', 'reporter', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'cameraman', 'Steve', 'Harris', 'are', 'shooting', 'special', 'interest', 'story', 'fire-house', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'rowdy', 'behavior', 'horrible', 'jokes', 'learn', 'firemen', 'want', 'get', 'Carpenter', 'pants', 'firemen', 'get', 'medical', 'call', 'rush', 'rescue', 'reporting', 'crew', 'on-hand', 'However', ""n't"", 'routine', 'medical', 'call', 'group', 'must', 'try', 'survive', 'government', 'secured', 'apartment', 'building', 'residents', 'succumb', 'fatal', 'zombie-inducing', 'disease.Where', 'begin', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'zombie', 'story', 'usually', 'asinine', 'way', 'zombie', 'plague', 'be', 'biological', 'weapon', 'voodoo', 'just', 'can', 'deal', 'explanation', 'accelerated', 'form', 'rabies', 'people', 'crazy', 'want', 'eat', 'other', 'people', 'even', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'see', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'However', 'initial', 'scene', 'fire-house', 'where', 'everything', 'normal', 'news', 'reporter', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'lives', 'firemen', 'drags', 'forever', 'must', 'be', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'felt', 'hour', ""'d"", 'think', 'maybe', 'could', 'show', 'basic', 'character', 'traits', 'develop', 'later', 'movie', 'get', 'rather', 'quickly.The', 'camera-work', 'really', 'killed', 'movie', 'know', 'meant', 'put', 'movie', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'However', 'been', 'done', 'too', 'much', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'better', 'single', 'time', 'Cloverfield', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'Spanish', 'version', 'film', 'following', 'suit', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'suspenseful', 'did', 'was', 'let', 'special', 'effects', 'crew', 'be', 'lazy', 'gore', 'disrupt', 'notion', 'story-line', 'give', 'headache.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'come', 'camera-view', 'narration', 'was', 'when', 'cameraman', 'zombie', 'face', 'giving', 'great', 'view', 'dental', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'broke', 'up', 'camera', 'view', 'bit', 'Maybe', 'mixing', 'normal', 'shooting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'views', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'such', 'dog', 'guy', 'elevator', 'scene', 'helped', 'fix', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'annoying', 'interesting', 'such', 'opening', 'movie', 'fire-house', 'was', 'also', 'point', 'saw', 'topless', 'zombie', 'diaper', 'thought', 'Hey', 'least', ""'re"", 'getting', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'friends', 'corrected', 'was', 'actually', 'old', 'man.To', 'be', 'fair', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'apartment', 'residents', 'cops', 'doctors', 'cameraman', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'things', 'suspenseful', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'anyway', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'was', 'matter', 'Overreactions', 'news', 'reporter', 'beginning', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'overreacting', 'throught', 'movie', 'order', 'make', 'video', 'piece', 'sensationalism', 'Even', 'when', 'see', 'come', 'terms', 'reality', 'what', 'going', 'Mrs.', 'Espinoza', 'shot', 'trite', 'Maybe', 'looking', 'damn', 'camera']",N/A

She engages the firemen - one of whom is Jake (Jay Hernandez) - in various games, flirts with them, makes random comments, and covers inane topics like their sleeping quarters.  What they want, however, is to cover a real emergency and ride the fire truck.  They should have thought of the old proverb: Be careful what you wish for.They arrive at an apartment complex, and link up with some policemen, where some tenants report that an old lady upstairs screamed.  Upon investigation, it appears that she is pale, incoherent, and foaming at the mouth (or has about 10 Alka-Seltzer tabs in her mouth).  Then, without warning, the old lady dives on a policeman, and goes for his neck like it's a chicken leg from Popeye's.  He's screwed.  We all know where this is going.All other occupants are herded into a terrifyingly dark situation, the building is quarantined from the outside by the CDC and an ominous paramilitary group of some kind, people make irrational decisions under stress, the cause of the outbreak is tracked back to a mysteriously reclusive man who lives in the attic, and suspense builds as the tides turn in the game of ""Zombie Tag"".  After all, when in a confined environment, zombies can gain numbers; their human combatants cannot.There is a healthy amount of gore, as well as some very good scares and shocks that are at times brilliant and at others predictably perfect.  Because of some very fine acting, which provides a fairly smooth, chaotic pace, the thrills are accentuated.  Although, Jennifer Carpenter's staccato hyperventilation the entire second half of the movie got a bit irritating.  It was not nearly as bad, however, as the first person point of view filming technique.The ""hand-held shaky camera, first person vantage point"" trend has jumped the shark.  I didn't mind it in Cloverfield, and thought it added to the movie.  It was shaky, but not so much that the story or action was hindered.  With this movie, however, there was just too much movement, and it appeared as if the cameraman was breakdancing.  This technique officially needs to be quarantined.Overall, it's a good, Romeroesque, addition to the zombie genre.

1217911,A34ZY8SF7XYSZS,B001MVYUQQ,"Jason T. Fetters ""Horror Fanboy & Japanologist""","[1, 5]","This Halloween is so slow for horror movies. My friend and I decided to go out and see one of the only horror movies playing for the season, Quaratine. Ok, I paid full movie theater price to see it and my friend used a free pass. We both left disappointed.It starts out as a good movie. The main characters are introduced quickly and there's a few laughs inside the fire station. Then when everyone arrives at the apartment complex, this movie nose dives straight into the ground. I will say one thing. It was a good premise that a better director could have done more with. There were so many options for a thinking director to explore. But this movie decided to full back on stupid characters getting themselves killed in a bad horror movie. The idiot screaming victum afraid to open the door and then she/he does, only to be killed off in a most uninteresting way. Do you really care to know what's behind the door that badly?One of the most irritating aspects was the sound track. When everyone is trapped inside the apartment building, you hear constant sirens, police shouting out orders via bull horn, and air raid sirens sounding off. This outside noise just doesn't stop, giving Quaratine a fake quality. How many times can you hear the same looped siren noise on the soundtrack? Its sound effects overkill at its worst.The limited perspective doesnt' work either. You have a newswoman and her camera man walking around. That's your whole view right there. Whatever the camera man picks up. Its such a narrow scope that you can so tired of such a wasted opportunity to get long shots. Various characters such as a police man and others repeatedly yell at her camera man to shut off the camera. That order gets so old very quickly.Certain apartment dwellers have been affected by an extreme form of rabies that cause them to turn into George Romeroesque, flesh eating ghouls. But no one does it like George and this director shouldn't have tried. The rabid rabies victums run up on people and begin to eat them alive. Something every horror fan has seen since Night of the Living Dead.That is the movie's only plus. I like the idea of rabies infected human monsters. The problem is the movie shows an infected character faraway in a room and firemen and the police try to talk sense into said character, who waits until the victum is within biting distance then jumps in for the kill. That gag setup is used over and over and over until you find saying thinking here's comes enough cheap attack with the long drawn out overplayed suspense sequence. It worked the first couple of times but it gets old at the sixth time.From what I saw it looked like Quarantine relied on old style makeup for its effects instead of the dreaded horror movie killer, CGI. I still have nightmares on how poorly constructed the effects in The Haunting were.That's a rare plus for Quarantine. A return to 80's movie makeup when people like Rick Baker, Tom Savini, and Dick Smith ruled the big screen.Overall, I can't recommend this sorry piece of trash to anyone out there. If you must, go for a rental six months from today. Or catch a youtube clip. The best thing to do is avoid any viewing of Quarantine at all. The biggest horror for me was the price to go see this junk at the theater.

1217913,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001MVYUQQ,J from NY,"[0, 0]","""Quarantine"" borrows heavily from 2007's ""Paranormal Activity"" and George Romero's ""Night of the Living"" both in concept, design, and specific scene sequences.  While it succeeds in equalling or surpassing neither of them, this is not a terrible movie. I haven't seen the original so I can't say if it's better or worse, but as with ""Pulse"", I'm inclined to take a shot in the dark and guess the director went softer and made the content a little more mainstream.Jennifer Carpenter has a great pair of tubes.  She can scream with the best of them and I wouldn't want antique plates or old people with heart conditions around her when she gets upset.  While it was just annoying in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", it is used to excellent effect in this grisly, relentlessly nightmarish, and actually unpredictable tale of an apartment filled with tenants--one of whom has decided to unleash a rabid/bubonic plague upon the nation, I guess--who are slowly falling victim to a disease which turns strong firemen into frothing cannibals and little children into Mommy Haters.  (Of course, the guy who owns the apartment is a foreigner, and as Hollywood always has to imply in some way, they all just want us eating each other and causing mass chaos!)The build up of the movie is pretty slow and we're treated to watching Carpenter act like the bubbly, somewhat annoying actress she can be, schmoozing it with a bunch of firemen and wanting to advance her career as a local? newswoman by travelling with them into an inferno.  She does, but I think the Empire State Building burning down would be preferable for most people compared to what actually happens.  The incident with the first ""sick"" old woman drooling blood and frothing, responding in a somewhat human and somewhat non human way at the attempts of firefighters/cops to calm her down and then taking a big juicy bite of one of LAPD's ""finest"", you get a real jump.  The terror of the film isn't so much in all the bloodletting but in the tension (who really DID get bit?) of who or who is not a ""carrier"". Romeo gets it pretty bad too, which I found gratifying, because he's one of the only people in the film who looked like he got handpicked from ""Cold Case"" or some Gap ad.The only unbelievable thing in the film is that the guy behind the camera keeps filming it.  You can believe that in ""PA"" because it's just stationed there the whole time and in ""Blair Witch"" because they need to keep a record of what they're doing since they don't have a map, but not in this.  Was this guy trained to be a professional boxer or did he take ballet? Is he going for the ""Just In Case Super Nobel Peace Prize?""  There are tons upon tons of once well intentioned tenants spitting their teeth out, growing what seem to be fangs and trying to bite everyone and he just dances away with the camera.  (He even kills one of them with it, and it doesn't crack.)The ending could have been much better.  Jennifer Carpenter gobbling the camera man would have been a REAL George Romero move, or vice versa.

Scary huh? Well what if you were locked inside your home with dozens of angry flesh eating zombies? Eww, now THAT'S scary. Such is  the premise of Quarantine, a zombie film that pays homage to the new age of first person camera views ala ""Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" while also managing to pay tribute to classic and modern zombie films such as ""28 Days Later"" and Romero's original classic, ""Night of the Living Dead.""A film crew from a local LA news station is shadowing a group of firemen when they get sent to an apartment complex. Everything seems routine until an old woman in one of the apartments becomes extremely violent, biting a police officer in the neck and throwing a firefighter three stories off a balcony. Shortly after the CDC arrives and barricades the doors in the apartment complex, sealing them in. Outside the windows soldiers are stationed with orders to shoot on sight anyone attempting to leave the building. The complex's dozen or so inhabitants, along with the news crew, firemen, and police, are trapped in the dark, and the disease is spreading quickly.All us zombie buffs remember Romero's miserably failed attempt to bring the first person camera experience to the zombie genera with ""Diary of the Dead.""  It would seem the master who created the zombie genera may not have been cut out for the first person perspective. His film had numerous problems, from far too many cuts, idiotic use of music, to unlikable and unbelievable characters. Quarantine, fortunately, has far more in common in terms of style with ""Cloverfield"" then it does with Romero's failed movie. The initial confusion, the mounting dread, anger, despair, and the final chaos are portrayed very will in this film. Rarely do the scares seem gimmicky, and unlike in other first person films it actually makes sense that they don't just put the camera down. Here it's not just for documenting the events, it's also used as a weapon and a primary light source since the power is shut off in the complex rather early on. Plus, since the complex is rather small and confined there aren't that many places to run anyway so ditching it would cause more harm then good. Dare I say, but I think Quarantine may have just solved the most pressing problem first person films had. Kudos.Any zombie buff worth his salt can spot the homage's to classic zombie films. The dark confined space with the hysteric female lead and strong black character is very reminiscent of Night of the Living Dead, while the zombies themselves (okay, for you purists out there, the `infected') share a lot of characteristics with the zombies of 28 Days Later (virus very much like rabies transmitted through infected bodily fluid not limited just through biting), in both looks and movements. Piercing red eyes, quick jerky movements, snarling, throwing up blood, show signs of starvation in extreme cases, etc. Not just gross looking and fun to watch, but also extremely scary, much more so I'd say then the treatment they were given in 28 Days Later or any other recent zombie films including Romero's two most recent films. What really makes these zombies scary though is the fact that you know all of them. There aren't that many people in the apartment complex, so when you see an infected person running after the camera you know exactly who it is. Their not just random people you've never seen before, that girl coming after you is the little girl they interviewed earlier, or that skinny white guy who was fighting to go back up to his room earlier. The film doesn't give you many names, but it still gives one chills to see someone you were talking to ten minutes ago run after you trying to bite your flesh off.Unfortunately this movie is not without its share of flaws. Although the question of why they don't just drop the camera and run is solved in this film, what the man holding the camera chooses to film is this films big question mark. Hell, when you've got night vision on your camera, and you're in the middle of a pitch black room with a zombie that's looking for you, wouldn't it be smart to keep your eye on the zombie instead of the hysterical woman next to you? You know, just in case it hears you and decides to come after you? These problems persisted throughout the film and can really take the viewer out of the moment, and when that happens all the strengths of the first person view go flying out the window.Plus if you liked the subtle dry humor of Cloverfield you can forget about it. There is absolutely NO humor at all in this film, no funny wise cracks, no sarcastic witty character, no slightly scary yet humorous situations, just straight up horror the whole way through from the time they leave the station to the time the credits role. Which might be a good thing for you, but speaking personally, I liked the humor in Cloverfield, I liked the subtle sarcasm. Sometimes you need that in a film, there's only so much flesh eating zombie carnage you can watch before you start thinking the film takes itself a little too seriously. But hey, don't listen to me; I after all am one of the few people who actually liked Land of the Dead which apparently means I'm not to be trusted. Oh well.So what's the verdict? Mix a little bit of Cloverfield with a tad of 28 Days Later and a good helping of Night of the Living Dead, and you get Quarantine. Sound like a good time? You bet, but don't expect a masterpiece, these days masterpieces in the zombie genera are hard to come by. But hey, you take what you can get, and in this case you get one really fun, if somewhat flawed, zombie flick.Replay value; high.Movies to see if you liked this (besides the ones already

1217918,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B001MVYUQQ,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[2, 7]","This is a horrible movie experience.  I happened to get tricked into paying for this movie, based upon some positive reviews, but if I knew what it was going to be like, I wouldn't have watched it.This movie artistically is a ripoff of Night of the Living Dead and The Blair Witch Project.  It's a ""zombie"" movie masquerading as an ""infection"" movie, as I'll explain below.  It's like Blair Witch because everything is filmed from the first-person cameraman/interview format.  So one couldn't really call it creative.Intellectually it makes no sense.  The people trapped within a quarantined apartment building supposedly have a virulent form of rabies, but if one thinks about it, they are really ""zombies.""  Those who are attacked and killed ""come back"" as killers.  But it is (falsely) put forth as them being sick with rabies, which makes zero sense.  If they really have rabies, are crazed and super-energized, and are fiercely ripping other people to shreds, then the other people will die.  But the victims come back as ""zombies"", which makes no sense.  Would a rabid bloodthirsty animal stop ripping up its victim, just so that the victim will still live and bite others?  Of course not.  That's one thing that bugged me intellectually about the film.  Another bothersome thing is that the people act irrationally.  First of all, why wouldn't the outside forces communicate to those trapped inside more, rather than just shut them in and keep them in the dark?  Also, if there were others that are infected in the building, then why wouldn't you just keep the well ones in one area and protect them with the lone armed cop's gun?  So the fact that there are logical flaws in the people's behaviour, makes me less able to stomach the gore and sadistic elements of the whole ordeal.I realize that most horror movies have some sort of sadistic element within them, and this does as well.  Watching people being brutalized gives the viewer chills, but in a well-made movie at least, there is some way out, some way to fight back, and maybe some redemption.  But in this film, you just get a lot of brutalization with no resolution apart from everyone dying.  Further, it has particulary sadistic elements, in which you get to see close-up through the camera lots of people get viciously attacked and lots of ""infected"" people, many of them slightly built women who were just moments before decent human beings, beaten to death.  The fact that this looks very real and has nothing to do with fantasy-type monsters, makes it more disturbing in my view, than say, a guy getting eaten by a dinosaur.  At one point, a child becomes a zombie and attacks people and I was horrified at the thought that the child would have to be killed by the remaining well peopele, but at least the directors had the sense not to show that (the child attacks the cop and the cameraman runs off).This movie is very manipulative.  As I said above, what happened could never happen the way it happened, but the director has you trapped in this type of claustrophobic hell and you just cringe your way through it.  For example, the outsiders send in one doctor with just one bodyguard with a gun.  Of course, an infected guy goes crazy and kills the bodyguard.  Why didn't they send in two, three or five armed guys?

1217921,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B001MVYUQQ,K. Driscoll,"[2, 3]","Quarantine is a new virally marketed American horror film released over the weekend that closely resembles and quite likely mimics, and therefore hopes to duplicate the success of, such films asThe Blair Witch Projectand the more recently released monster movieCloverfield.  For that and the unoriginal plotline it does not get a perfect rating.  Quarantine is also a remake of a Spanish horror film called REC that has yet to see a release in the United States.  Other than those aforementioned fundamental flaws, Quarantine gets the job done.  By that I of course mean make your girlfriend jump and cringe and just overall creep her out.  It might even creep you out if you allow it to.Quarantine is essentially supposed to be footage of a small news crew in Los Angeles that is following around some firemen to capture some of their activities.  Jennifer Carpenter (The Exorcism of Emily Roseand television'sDexter) is the reporter that appears in almost every frame of this footage.  Their adventures lead them to a medical emergency at an apartment building, and the stage is set for some flesh-eating, gut-wrenching horror and suspense.  If you don't know what happens and you plan to try and enjoy this film in the theater than it is better that I stop revealing details here.Quarantine is well done.  It has some nail-biting moments and some scenes scary enough that I wanted to laugh instead, just to feel more comfortable.  That means it worked as a horror film in my view.  Additionally, I have to add that Jennifer Carpenter really is an outstanding actress.  Her performances in her other work lead me to infer she had little range.  Here she does some of the same but from a completely different character's vantage point and it's worth noting that if she didn't have such a unique look I would not have made the connection that she plays Dexter Morgan's sister on the Showtime television series.  The rest of the cast is also strong.  The director is John Erick Dowdle, who released a film I heard hyped a bit calledThe Poughkeepsie Tapes.

They're both interesting horror films hamstrung only by two major plot faults.The first is the cameraman/actor. All the film is done in 1st person, that is, it's shot by the guy playing a cameraman. Whilst this is interesting in that it makes like a real documentary its major drawback is that in order to film the action the actor doesn't actually take part in some situations where his help would be vital.The only time he helps in fighting one of the rabid mad people is when the newsgirl Jennifer Carpenter is attacked. And, by that time there's so many rabid mad people that he's left it too late.The next is that when trapped in an apartment block full of rabidly mad people only one person takes up a weapon. No one goes into any of the open apartments and gets a knife, or looks for a baseball bat. The newsgirl runs around screaming, followed by her trusty cameraman - who at least once butts someone with the camera, and that's it. What you have is a situation where the people are doing so little to help that they're almost lining up to be killed.For those reasons I hate both these films. All the interesting plot building at the beginning is destroyed by lemming-like characters.At one stage a group of these lemmings are standing in a room where they've shut a rabid person in behind only a flimsy glass door. One of the lemmings, with obvious no talent at self-preservation stands easily just on the other side of the glass, and is promptly attacked and infected.

This is one of those times.  A lazily-written script and dumb characters are worse to endure than mediocre special effects.  This movie's ho-hum premise is that a bunch of diverse (of course) people are stuck in an apartment house because of an outbreak of a mysterious disease: they're Quarantined.  Big surprise: A lot of bad, nasty things happen.  I'd describe this as ""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""Alien"" meets ""Blair Witch Project"" meets ""Cloverfield"".  The jerky camera work is extremely annoying, as it was in the latter two movies. The movie is boring and irritating by turns and a major gross-out at times; don't watch it while you eat!  It's not really scary, and not smart enough in the writing to be truly disturbing.  Now, maybe if they'd gotten Chuck Palahniuk to write the script, they'd have had something.

1217935,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001MVYUQQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","In 1999 audiences were placed into the middle of fear with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a film that used first person hand held camera to insert the viewer into the action. This was taken a step further early in 2008 with CLOVERFIELD. That form is kicked up one notch further with the release of QUARRANTINE.The film opens with a news reporter named Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) shooting a puff piece about what it's like to be a fire fighter. We're put through the paces as she gets to know the two men she'll be riding with that night, what the station is like, what the men are like, etc. Eventually, they are called out on a call and the film picks up the pace a bit. The earlier part may have been slow, but it establishes the characters well.They arrive at an old apartment building and are met by two police officers as well as a few residents. It seems screams were heard from the apartment of an elderly woman on an upper level. When they go to investigate, they get more than they bargained for.Miss Espinoza is shaky, startled, had blood on the front of her nightgown and seems to be drooling. As the officers try and calm her down so they can help her, she backs away. When the closest turns his back on her, she leaps on him and begins gnawing on his neck. Subdued by one of the firefighters, the rest take the injured officer downstairs.One of the residents is a veterinarian who attempts to help. They get the officer to another room to a long table to be looked at and return to the foyer only to nearly be bombarded by the body of the fire fighter whose been tossed over the railing to the floor. Nope, this is not an ordinary call.When they begin to leave the building to get help, they discover that the entire place has been sealed off from the outside. It seems the CDC has arrived and considers the whole place a danger. From here on out the film feels like a reversal of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: instead of barricading yourself inside to protect from what is out, we have a group of people locked in, trying to protect themselves from what is right next to them.The vet realizes what the problem is and using the symptoms states that this seems to be a case of rabies unlike any other. What should take days to appear is taking minutes. And while most would think rabies is curable, it seems that once the signs show it's a done deal.Characters are bitten, infected and shortly thereafter become the raving lunatics with foam filled mouths attempting to bite the nearest person who is uninfected. Every attempt to escape the building is met with blockaded doors, armed military and finally gunfire. There is no escape. And the chances of survival weaken with each fallen victim rising to infect more.Told from the first person perspective of the camera, somewhat in real time, the movie makes you feel as if you are there, in the midst of it all. The feeling of the walls closing in around you as the hope of exit is dropped over and over again permeates the film.When you get down to the final survivors you wonder if the film will allow them the safe haven of rescue. It seems doubtful but what point would there be in watching without that glimmer of hope we experience just as those in the building do?The acting here is tremendous. It would be so easy to simply read a script and meet your mark. But to play back and forth in a realistic sense takes talent. Carpenter does a great job going from novice to intrepid reporter to simply terrified observer trying to stay alive. The rest of the cast does just as great a job whether they're trying to live or foaming at the mouth.There are movies that terrify because of their subject matter. There are those that scare because of fears of the supernatural. But movies like this, where the possibility exist, where you find yourself less watching and more pulled into the part of the camera man, offer scares that stick with you. The only thing that could make it more terrifying is to turn to the person next to you and notice a bit of drool on their lips.",5,CLAUSTROPHIC HORROR,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,4033,"['1999', 'audiences', 'were', 'placed', 'middle', 'fear', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'film', 'used', 'first', 'person', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'insert', 'viewer', 'action', 'was', 'taken', 'step', 'further', 'early', '2008', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'form', 'kicked', 'up', 'one', 'notch', 'further', 'release', 'QUARRANTINE.The', 'film', 'news', 'reporter', 'named', 'Angela', 'Vidal', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'shooting', 'puff', 'piece', 'what', 'be', 'fire', 'fighter', ""'re"", 'put', 'paces', 'know', 'two', 'men', ""'ll"", 'be', 'riding', 'night', 'what', 'station', 'what', 'men', 'are', 'etc', 'Eventually', 'are', 'called', 'out', 'call', 'film', 'up', 'pace', 'bit', 'earlier', 'part', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'slow', 'characters', 'well.They', 'arrive', 'old', 'apartment', 'building', 'are', 'met', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'residents', 'screams', 'were', 'heard', 'apartment', 'elderly', 'woman', 'upper', 'level', 'When', 'go', 'investigate', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.Miss', 'Espinoza', 'shaky', 'startled', 'had', 'blood', 'front', 'nightgown', 'be', 'drooling', 'officers', 'try', 'calm', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'help', 'away', 'When', 'closest', 'back', 'her', 'gnawing', 'neck', 'Subdued', 'one', 'firefighters', 'rest', 'take', 'injured', 'officer', 'downstairs.One', 'residents', 'veterinarian', 'who', 'help', 'get', 'officer', 'room', 'long', 'table', 'be', 'looked', 'return', 'foyer', 'only', 'nearly', 'be', 'bombarded', 'body', 'fire', 'fighter', 'been', 'tossed', 'railing', 'floor', 'Nope', 'not', 'ordinary', 'call.When', 'begin', 'leave', 'building', 'get', 'help', 'discover', 'entire', 'place', 'been', 'sealed', 'off', 'outside', 'CDC', 'arrived', 'whole', 'place', 'danger', 'here', 'film', 'feels', 'reversal', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'instead', 'barricading', 'protect', 'what', 'out', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'locked', 'trying', 'protect', 'what', 'right', 'next', 'them.The', 'vet', 'what', 'problem', 'using', 'symptoms', 'be', 'case', 'rabies', 'other', 'What', 'should', 'take', 'days', 'appear', 'taking', 'minutes', 'most', 'would', 'think', 'rabies', 'curable', 'once', 'signs', 'show', 'done', 'deal.Characters', 'are', 'bitten', 'infected', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'become', 'raving', 'lunatics', 'foam', 'filled', 'mouths', 'attempting', 'bite', 'nearest', 'person', 'who', 'uninfected', 'attempt', 'escape', 'building', 'met', 'blockaded', 'doors', 'armed', 'military', 'finally', 'gunfire', 'escape', 'chances', 'survival', 'weaken', 'fallen', 'victim', 'rising', 'infect', 'more.Told', 'first', 'person', 'perspective', 'camera', 'somewhat', 'real', 'time', 'movie', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'midst', 'feeling', 'walls', 'closing', 'around', 'hope', 'exit', 'dropped', 'over', 'again', 'film.When', 'get', 'down', 'final', 'survivors', 'wonder', 'film', 'will', 'allow', 'safe', 'haven', 'rescue', 'doubtful', 'what', 'point', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'watching', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'experience', 'just', 'building', 'do', 'acting', 'here', 'tremendous', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'simply', 'read', 'script', 'meet', 'mark', 'play', 'back', 'forth', 'realistic', 'sense', 'talent', 'Carpenter', 'great', 'job', 'going', 'novice', 'intrepid', 'reporter', 'simply', 'terrified', 'observer', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'job', ""'re"", 'trying', 'live', 'foaming', 'are', 'movies', 'terrify', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'scare', 'fears', 'supernatural', 'movies', 'where', 'possibility', 'exist', 'where', 'find', 'less', 'watching', 'more', 'pulled', 'part', 'camera', 'man', 'offer', 'stick', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'make', 'more', 'terrifying', 'turn', 'person', 'next', 'notice', 'bit', 'drool', 'lips']",N/A
1217936,AAW58LG72PG7I,B001MVYUQQ,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 1]","QUARANTINE is a roller coaster ride of horror and splattering gore that is not apparent from the first few minutes.  Much of this film is taken liberally from nearly anything by George Romero or by ""hand held"" cam videos from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  But when you get past this cinematic borrowing, then what you have left is a dizzyingly paced horror film that makes victims into instant zombies.  The first few minutes involves a young and pretty television reporter (Jennifer Carpenter) who tags along with a fire truck crew in Los Angeles as they answer what they think is a typical call involving a 911 phone in.  What they quickly discover is that the first sick people have been infected with a super strain of rabies that causes the victim to become a crazed flesh-eating predator who in turn seeks out new victims. From the moment that the audience (and the surviving victims) realize this, the movie becomes a race as to whether the survivors can hold off the attacks of those who just moments ago were trusted friends.  What is troubling about QUARANTINE is not the gore of which there is plenty nor is it the inability of the victims to come up with a plan for survival.  Rather, what I found first laughable than annoying was the film's subtext that the government made the decision to quarantine the building in which the victims were holed up with the zombies.  Initially, I could not believe the speed with which the CDC (Center for Disease Control) would intervene.  The rationale provided by one of the victims (who surprisingly enough was a veteranarian) simply was not credible.  What was credible was the decision to enforce the quarantine by lethal force.  As I watched the victims get chomped on one by one, I began to see the real monsters were not the blood sucking zombies at all.  After all, they had no choice.  They were sick and not in control.  The real villains were the government officials who the film subtly implied were responsible for the virus in the first place. Films like this one leave a bad taste in the mouth because they make us realize that the inhuman decision by the CDC to quarantine using deadly force is probably a prophetically accurate one. Knowing this probably invested the movie with a subliminal visceral disgust that adds to its ability to place the viewer right there in that splatter-filled grungy apartment in Los Angeles.  It is probably just as well that we never get to know any of the victims too well before they encounter changed humans that Go Bump in the Night.",3,And Then There Were None,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,2532,"['QUARANTINE', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'horror', 'splattering', 'gore', 'not', 'apparent', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Much', 'film', 'taken', 'liberally', 'nearly', 'anything', 'George', 'Romero', 'hand', 'held', 'cam', 'videos', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'when', 'get', 'cinematic', 'borrowing', 'then', 'what', 'have', 'left', 'dizzyingly', 'paced', 'horror', 'film', 'victims', 'instant', 'zombies', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'young', 'pretty', 'television', 'reporter', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'who', 'along', 'fire', 'truck', 'crew', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'answer', 'what', 'think', 'typical', 'call', 'involving', '911', 'phone', 'What', 'quickly', 'discover', 'first', 'sick', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'infected', 'super', 'strain', 'rabies', 'victim', 'become', 'crazed', 'flesh-eating', 'predator', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'new', 'victims', 'moment', 'audience', 'surviving', 'victims', 'realize', 'movie', 'race', 'survivors', 'can', 'hold', 'off', 'attacks', 'who', 'just', 'moments', 'ago', 'were', 'trusted', 'friends', 'What', 'troubling', 'QUARANTINE', 'not', 'gore', 'plenty', 'inability', 'victims', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'survival', 'Rather', 'what', 'found', 'first', 'laughable', 'annoying', 'was', 'film', 'subtext', 'government', 'made', 'decision', 'quarantine', 'building', 'victims', 'were', 'holed', 'up', 'zombies', 'Initially', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'speed', 'CDC', 'Center', 'Disease', 'Control', 'would', 'intervene', 'rationale', 'provided', 'one', 'victims', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'was', 'veteranarian', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'credible', 'What', 'was', 'credible', 'was', 'decision', 'enforce', 'quarantine', 'lethal', 'force', 'watched', 'victims', 'get', 'chomped', 'one', 'one', 'began', 'see', 'real', 'monsters', 'were', 'not', 'blood', 'sucking', 'zombies', 'had', 'choice', 'were', 'sick', 'not', 'control', 'real', 'villains', 'were', 'government', 'officials', 'who', 'film', 'subtly', 'implied', 'were', 'responsible', 'virus', 'first', 'place', 'Films', 'one', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'make', 'realize', 'inhuman', 'decision', 'CDC', 'quarantine', 'using', 'deadly', 'force', 'probably', 'prophetically', 'accurate', 'one', 'Knowing', 'probably', 'invested', 'movie', 'subliminal', 'visceral', 'disgust', 'ability', 'place', 'viewer', 'right', 'there', 'splatter-filled', 'grungy', 'apartment', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'victims', 'too', 'well', 'encounter', 'changed', 'humans', 'Go', 'Bump', 'Night']",N/A

I was encouraged to see it by a friend and I should have known what kind of thing I was getting myself into when this friend is really into zombie movies.But Quarantine isn't a zombie movie.If you mixed 28 Days Later with The Blair Witch Project, you would get Quarantine.It was compared to Cloverfield because of the camera work, but I'd say it's more like the Blair Witch because of how horrible the camera is. At least there was some steadiness to Cloverfield.But enough of the comparisons.This film is about a late night reporter (the girl you see in the photo) doing a story about firefighters. After the first 20 minutes of learning some stuff about what it's like for them, there's an alarm and they're sent off to an apartment complex.They go inside and some of the tenets claim a woman was screaming in the upstairs. They go up to investigate and find this lady having trouble breathing and blood over her shirt.Then the attack comes and they're trapped inside the building. The police believe there to be some kind of outbreak and seal the place up tight.The plus side of the film is that the questions are answered. You find out what is going on and why. Another plus is how realistic everything is. Well, let me amend that. There are some recognizable faces in the cast so that puts a damper on the whole ""it's real"" thing going. You'll see people like Rade Serbedzija (of Batman Begins), Greg Germann (from Ally McBeal and other tv shows), and Dania Ramirez (from Heroes)The negative side; I really got sick watching this film. I still have a headache from it. I didn't get sick by Cloverfield. There's alot of cussing, but that's to be expected when you're scared out of your mind, right? And the big negative is the lead - the reporter. She is incredibly annoying. Her cameraman does all he can to calm her down but she just gets more and more agitated which translates into the whimpering and crying.I know defenders will say that's realistic, and maybe so.

But, if you're just looking for a pretty decent gory flick in the spirit of 28 Days Later (and in my opinion, way better the 28 Weeks Later) with a smidgen of Outbreak tossed in to boot, this is a worthwhile diversion.  I tend to believe the POV single camera technique is often annoying - shaky viewing perspective, typically too dark, action hard to follow - but for what it's worth, this is a watchable effort. Anyway, I never can forget the essence of Goldwaithe riff from the Rodney King debacle, ""don't film me, drop the camera and help me.""Jennifer Carpenter dances on my fragile last nerve as the self-absorbed sister on Dexter but here her constipated personality works well as the TV features reporter who finds herself inadvertently quarantined with an eclectic collection of apartment building residents and emergency response employees. Steve Harris (The Practice) is heard a great deal more than seen as the even tempered cameraman and thusly the individual accountable for documentation of this day of terror. Jay Hernandez is a relatively stock variety of firefighter with Greg German (one of my favorites from Ally McBeal) and Dania Ramirez (Heroes) also in the mix of the inevitable sacrificial lambs.The beginning of the movie is a little slow but once the core characters arrive at the emergency site, the action takes off and doesn't subside to the closing credits. So if you're looking for cerebral and that doesn't include brains on the table, pick another movie because the only thing provocative here is the sophomoric lewdness of the firehouse crew.",4,When did I say I wanted to be an Investigative reporter?,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,1751,"[""'re"", 'search', 'next', 'Kurosawa', 'Streep', 'Washington', 'film', 'will', 'shape', 'direction', 'cinema', 'new', 'millennia', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'waste', '90', 'minutes', 'here', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'pretty', 'decent', 'gory', 'flick', 'spirit', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'opinion', 'way', 'better', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'smidgen', 'Outbreak', 'tossed', 'boot', 'worthwhile', 'diversion', 'tend', 'believe', 'POV', 'single', 'camera', 'technique', 'often', 'annoying', 'shaky', 'viewing', 'perspective', 'typically', 'too', 'dark', 'action', 'hard', 'follow', 'what', 'worth', 'watchable', 'effort', 'Anyway', 'never', 'can', 'forget', 'essence', 'Goldwaithe', 'riff', 'Rodney', 'King', 'debacle', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'camera', 'help', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'dances', 'fragile', 'last', 'nerve', 'self-absorbed', 'sister', 'Dexter', 'here', 'constipated', 'personality', 'well', 'TV', 'features', 'reporter', 'who', 'inadvertently', 'quarantined', 'eclectic', 'collection', 'apartment', 'building', 'residents', 'emergency', 'response', 'employees', 'Steve', 'Harris', 'Practice', 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'seen', 'even', 'tempered', 'cameraman', 'thusly', 'individual', 'accountable', 'documentation', 'day', 'terror', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'relatively', 'stock', 'variety', 'firefighter', 'Greg', 'German', 'one', 'favorites', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'Dania', 'Ramirez', 'Heroes', 'also', 'mix', 'inevitable', 'sacrificial', 'lambs.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', 'once', 'core', 'characters', 'arrive', 'emergency', 'site', 'action', 'off', ""n't"", 'subside', 'closing', 'credits', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cerebral', ""n't"", 'include', 'brains', 'table', 'pick', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'provocative', 'here', 'sophomoric', 'lewdness', 'firehouse', 'crew']",N/A

All things combined make this one a fantastic piece in any movie lover's collection; plot, footage, characters, photography, technique, and direction are all excellent.  I am impressed.First, I suggest you do not look for the soundtrack.  This is not a movie, which features much music.  In fact, that is one of the most appealing aspects of the movie.  It looks and feels like raw footage from an on-scene television crew.  It is of course edited, but it feels unedited and real.  Despite the raw feel of this movie, it is not difficult to view as some homemade videos are.  Even scenes in which the camera is ""dropped"" or the lens is cleaned, the footage fits and continues to portray the story line.I believe the directors and producers did a fantastic job on this film.  I have never done either, but feel the perspective, and planning put into the film could not have been better.  Making a film look raw and unedited without actually being raw and unedited must be very challenging.  They did a great job.The cast is equally incredible.  Jennifer Carpenter is amazing.  Her portrayal of a terrified reporter is genuine and unforgettable.  I love how her fear gradually escalates from controlled professional champion of the people to panicked captive in a terrifying situation.  I really admire her ability to pull it off successfully.  I do not know if I have seen her in anything else, but she does a great job.  Beauty, talent, and skill are definitely traits she possesses.The plot is simple, but that simplicity is what makes it believable.  A disease, unidentified and devastating, leaves the residents of an apartment building, and their would-be rescuers trapped by the CDC and local emergency agencies in a desperate move to contain it.  Once the context is established, chaos builds quickly. The film starts in the fire station where character development begins.  Blood, vomit, brutal beatings, saliva, rotten flesh, explosive gunshots, and rabid dogs all make an appearance here.  They are not gut-wrenching though.  The style of filming makes gives them an eerie unenhanced quality.  As the events quickly build to climax, it is obvious that the thrills will not stop.I recommend this to all those would be filmmakers in America.  You can really see the things that make it easy to view.  I also suggest horror fans, zombie fanatics, and movie buffs look at this one.  It really is a great film.",5,Eerie realism and haunting terrorism combine,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2528,"['love', 'film', 'first', 'watched', 'year', 'ago', 'rental', 'mail', 'option', 'never', 'expected', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'things', 'combined', 'make', 'one', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'movie', 'lover', 'collection', 'plot', 'footage', 'characters', 'photography', 'technique', 'direction', 'are', 'excellent', 'am', 'impressed.First', 'suggest', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'movie', 'much', 'music', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'aspects', 'movie', 'feels', 'raw', 'footage', 'on-scene', 'television', 'crew', 'course', 'edited', 'unedited', 'real', 'raw', 'feel', 'movie', 'not', 'difficult', 'view', 'homemade', 'videos', 'are', 'Even', 'scenes', 'camera', 'dropped', 'lens', 'cleaned', 'footage', 'fits', 'portray', 'story', 'line.I', 'believe', 'directors', 'producers', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'either', 'feel', 'perspective', 'planning', 'put', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Making', 'film', 'look', 'raw', 'unedited', 'actually', 'being', 'raw', 'unedited', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'challenging', 'did', 'great', 'job.The', 'cast', 'equally', 'incredible', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'terrified', 'reporter', 'genuine', 'unforgettable', 'love', 'how', 'fear', 'gradually', 'controlled', 'professional', 'champion', 'people', 'panicked', 'captive', 'terrifying', 'situation', 'really', 'admire', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'successfully', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'have', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'great', 'job', 'Beauty', 'talent', 'skill', 'are', 'definitely', 'traits', 'possesses.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'simplicity', 'what', 'believable', 'disease', 'unidentified', 'devastating', 'residents', 'apartment', 'building', 'would-be', 'rescuers', 'trapped', 'CDC', 'local', 'emergency', 'agencies', 'desperate', 'move', 'contain', 'context', 'established', 'chaos', 'builds', 'quickly', 'film', 'fire', 'station', 'where', 'character', 'development', 'Blood', 'vomit', 'brutal', 'beatings', 'saliva', 'rotten', 'flesh', 'explosive', 'gunshots', 'rabid', 'dogs', 'make', 'appearance', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'gut-wrenching', 'style', 'filming', 'eerie', 'unenhanced', 'quality', 'events', 'quickly', 'build', 'climax', 'obvious', 'thrills', 'will', 'not', 'stop.I', 'recommend', 'would', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'America', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'things', 'make', 'easy', 'view', 'also', 'suggest', 'horror', 'fans', 'zombie', 'fanatics', 'movie', 'buffs', 'look', 'one', 'really', 'great', 'film']",N/A

B Cole ""Kegrun""","[4, 6]","Grab your Dramamine pills and get ready for a surprisingly good thrill ride.Angela (Jennifer Carpenter) is a news reporter trying to get a story on the LA Fire Department for the local news. Along with her is Scott (Steve Harris), the man behind the camera, to help film it. Angela and Scott are teamed up with two fire fighters, Jake (Jay Hernandez) and George (I think it was George...and I don't know who plays him...hehe). Sometime during the night, the fire department gets a call to come to an apartment building where a woman is locked in her room and there was a blood curdling scream heard from it. Unknowing of the danger that is lurking beyond the door, the firemen and the accompanying police officers bust the door down.After a scene that had me holding my breath in anticipation, the occupants of the building find themselves trapped inside... by our own people. The CDC (I think it was the CDC) has quarantined the building off...leaving our occupants trapped inside to face the terrifying monsters alone.Quarantine (a remake of the spanish film [REC]) uses the First Person camera view (likeCloverfieldandThe Blair Witch Project), which can be good and bad depending on who you are. Honestly, I think it was done really well and even believable. It almost felt like you were watching a home movie made with an HD camera. Also there is one scene where Scott is being attacked and he uses the camera to bash the face in on one of the infected. Great close ups I might add...hehe. If you do get motion sickness, I definitely recommend you taking some Dramamine pills beforehand.I have heard some discontent on Jennifer Carpenters acting also in this movie. Things like over the top or unbelievable. Seriously? I thought she was excellent. Extremely better than her role in the TV show Dexter. I honestly could see her emotions going from having fun, to getting excited, to being shocked, to getting scared, to falling back to the human instinct of 'save yourself first', and into going into almost complete shock. I almost wish I could have handed her a paper bag to breath in sometimes she was cry-heaving so hard in one scene.Finally I have to let you know this. I went into this movie thinking the worst. I really hated what I saw in the previews. I thought this movie was going to be REALLY bad. But I was very wrong. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Sure the movie had its hokey moments, but there were some decent jumps, scares, and heart racing moments that made me really enjoy myself.",4,Are you recording this?!,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,2500,"['Grab', 'Dramamine', 'pills', 'get', 'ready', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'thrill', 'ride.Angela', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'news', 'reporter', 'trying', 'get', 'story', 'LA', 'Fire', 'Department', 'local', 'news', 'Scott', 'Steve', 'Harris', 'man', 'camera', 'help', 'film', 'Angela', 'Scott', 'are', 'teamed', 'up', 'two', 'fire', 'fighters', 'Jake', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'George', 'think', 'was', 'George', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'hehe', 'Sometime', 'night', 'fire', 'department', 'call', 'come', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'woman', 'locked', 'room', 'was', 'blood', 'curdling', 'scream', 'heard', 'Unknowing', 'danger', 'lurking', 'door', 'firemen', 'accompanying', 'police', 'officers', 'bust', 'door', 'down.After', 'scene', 'had', 'holding', 'breath', 'anticipation', 'occupants', 'building', 'find', 'trapped', 'inside', 'own', 'people', 'CDC', 'think', 'was', 'CDC', 'quarantined', 'building', 'off', 'leaving', 'occupants', 'trapped', 'face', 'terrifying', 'monsters', 'alone.Quarantine', 'remake', 'spanish', 'film', '[', 'REC', ']', 'First', 'Person', 'camera', 'view', 'likeCloverfieldandThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'who', 'are', 'Honestly', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'even', 'believable', 'almost', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'home', 'movie', 'made', 'HD', 'camera', 'Also', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Scott', 'being', 'attacked', 'camera', 'bash', 'face', 'one', 'infected', 'Great', 'close', 'ups', 'might', 'add', 'hehe', 'do', 'get', 'motion', 'sickness', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'taking', 'Dramamine', 'pills', 'beforehand.I', 'have', 'heard', 'discontent', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenters', 'acting', 'also', 'movie', 'Things', 'top', 'unbelievable', 'Seriously', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'Extremely', 'better', 'role', 'TV', 'show', 'Dexter', 'honestly', 'could', 'see', 'emotions', 'going', 'having', 'fun', 'getting', 'excited', 'being', 'shocked', 'getting', 'scared', 'falling', 'back', 'human', 'instinct', ""'save"", 'first', 'going', 'almost', 'complete', 'shock', 'almost', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'handed', 'paper', 'bag', 'breath', 'sometimes', 'was', 'cry-heaving', 'so', 'hard', 'one', 'scene.Finally', 'have', 'let', 'know', 'went', 'movie', 'thinking', 'worst', 'really', 'hated', 'what', 'saw', 'previews', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'Sure', 'movie', 'had', 'hokey', 'moments', 'were', 'decent', 'jumps', 'scares', 'heart', 'racing', 'moments', 'made', 'really', 'enjoy']",N/A

1217951,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001MVYUQQ,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","A remake of the 2007 Spanish horror film REC, Quarantine is a decent bit of POV-style horror that doesn't do the whole handheld camera thing as well as one would hope, but does manage to provide some genuine and even surprising scares. Dexter's Jennifer Carpenter stars as a reporter who, along with her cameraman (Steve Harris) accompany a group of firefighters (among them Jay Hernandez and Jonathon Schaech) to a dingy old apartment building upon receiving a disturbance call. It isn't long before them and the rest of the apartment's tenants (including Greg Germann and Rade Serbedzija) discover something is horribly wrong, and find themselves quarantined and trapped inside the building as the blood starts to flow and the body count rises. While Quarantine offers nothing new at all to the genre, it does manage to provide some solid shocks, scares, and nicely done gore effects. The camera work isn't too quease-inducing, but the POV style doesn't always manage to work out for the best either, particularly towards the end of the film when a night vision mode gets implemented.

1217952,A3LH0LIL5BQNJW,B001MVYUQQ,Niels Bohr,"[0, 5]","The following is an excerpt from another reviewer Tony Mesnard. I just could not have put it better.""Things began well, with a nice set up that involved some good banter back and forth. The trip to the apartment complex and the realization that something horrible is happening works well. Sure, some scenes have been changed for added gore/shock value, but overall it was a good, if needless, remake. Unfortunately, what I like to call the ""Marilyn Burns Effect"" happens and ruins the last 1/3 of the movie. Horror aficionados will remember Marilyn as the actress in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. While many hold this film in high regards (and rightly so), Marilyn spends the last 10-20 minutes of the movie running, arms flailing and screaming her head off. Today, reviewing that film, it comes across more humorous than scary.And unfortunately, that's what happens in Quarantine. Towards the end, you just want to reach through the screen and slap the main character. I could go into a deep discussion of female hysteria in film, especially as it relates to needing a man to calm her down (usually with a slap to the face), but I won't. Needless to say, that stereotype continues in this film, complete with an unsuccessful talking down by her male camera person, and it turns into a self-parody.""I agree 100%! I sorta was entertained by the movie but not by much and the last 20-30 minutes left me wanting to turn it off. Hence my one star.

1217958,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B001MVYUQQ,Paulo Leite,"[1, 2]","This film is an almost shot-by-shot remake of the Spanish horror gem [REC]. So if the Spanish film was already an astonishingly successful shocker, this American remake is by no means less effective.A female news reporter and her cameraman are spending the night with the L.A. Fire Dept. Suddenly, they are called to an apartment building where a woman has gone berserk. They go inside only to discover the woman is suffering from a strange disease. As they try to leave the building with all the other tenants, they find the building sealed... and the disease starts spreading.What makes this film stand out is its rhythm, its pace and the way the screenplay brilliantly takes advantage of one confined space combined with several secondary spaces that, in time, take the story further and further.This film is indeed a true masterclass in narrative economy, where new spaces and new elements are given to the audience only when it's most needed. And the screenplay controls it with a superior craft. Once the horror gets going, there are no dull moments and you are kept at the edge of your seat asking ""what next? What next?"". Truly superb.As with many other films likeThe Blair Witch Project,CloverfieldandGeorge A. Romero's Diary of the Dead, this film uses the same storytelling device: it is all told through the eyes of a camera that's shooting the whole thing supposedly as it is being shot (thus, without editing). The camera style is shaky and the cinematography emulates an amateur work. Lots of people have a problem with that. Not me. Woody Allen briefly toyed with almost the same approach onHusbands and Wiveswith lots of success although in his case it was all beautifully photographed and just the camera was shaky with a couple of jump cuts.So this style is getting more and more common today and I suspect people will get more used to it. Yes, sometimes, it is all a big mess... but at the same time it is all very calculated because when the camera wants you to jump, it will give you what you need to see.I highly recommend this film. It is potent, violent, has a decent amount of gore and it is relentless.

This may be a remake of the Spanish movie that folks have referred to. I have not seen that movie so I will only make comments based on this movie. First, I don't like movies where someone is running around with a camera. Second, I didn't find the lead female actress compelling or memorable in any way. Third, what is up with the constant blaring police and fire sirens and the helicopter noise? I mean COME ON.  I find it fitting that every person in the building seemed to die, since this movie simply had nothing to offer.I just don't know what there is to say about this movie. So folks have been infected with some sort of souped up rabies vaccine. So someone in the building was a terrorist wanna be who may have created this super rabies vaccine. Ok, so the infection spread RAPIDLY, can you say ""28 Days Later"". And this film wants to be a zombie flick, albeit with a different sort of infection, and a terrorist. Victims seem to know that as a victim of this virus that they must instinctively try to EAT people, to BITE folks on the NECK or the HEAD, or the FACE.

1217966,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001MVYUQQ,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","QUARANTINE, I'll tell you right here, is better than I would have expected (or hoped).  It provided some genuine ""jump-in-your-seat"" moments and there is no doubt my heart was racing during much of it.  It is a pure formula film, almost totally unoriginal...yet it also shows that competent execution is so much a part of the success of a film, particularly in a genre like horror.This is another one of those ""Point of View"" (POV) films, where we see it all, unedited, through the lens of a camera (CLOVERFIELD and DIARY OF THE DEAD being recent examples).  This technique allows for some sloppiness of editing, lighting, and even continuity.  It saves, no doubt, a great deal on a film's budget.  However, it also requires the film to be effective without the use of a musical soundtrack and frequently requires some very lengthy takes, in which a major mistake by an actor or in the realm of special effects would call for an entire scene to be run again from the top.  I'm not suggesting such film techniques are technical marvels...but they have their own requirements that make the difficult.  As much fun as BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was when it came out (we'd not seen a film like it before), the movies that have come since using the POV method have really jumped ahead in terms of what they can do.  CLOVERFIELD, of course, was heavily computer enhanced after filming (unless I'm much mistaken, the monster destroying NYC was not real)...but QUARANTINE is much more down and dirty.  (I also acknowledge that it was a remake of a foreign film entitled REC, which I've read was also very good, even superior, but I have not seen it, so I can only comment on my experience seeing QUARANTINE.)We begin one evening in front of a fire station.  TV reporter Jennifer Carpenter (EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE and TV's ""Dexter""), speaking to the camera, tells us that she's going to be spending a evening riding along with a fire crew.  We see the raw footage she and her photographer put together...joking with the firemen, sliding down the pole, asking silly questions.  We can already picture in our heads what her editing piece will end up like...complete fluff, but making us feel good about the firemen protecting our city.  But then she and her two man fire crew are called to an apartment building because a woman inside is sick.  They rush into this old, run-down building, where two policeman have arrived ahead of them.  They reach the old woman's apartment to find her standing there, foaming at the mouth, breathing heavily and unresponsive to their questions.  And as we expect, in a sudden burst of action, she attacks her rescuers, going for the throat.  Chaos ensues.Then the folks inside the apartment, including the inevitably motley crew of residents, discover that they have been sealed inside the building by a heavily armed CDC crew.  Thus, they have also been sealed inside with an ever growing number of infected ""zombies.""  (It's not strictly a zombie movie...the ""monsters"" are sort of combinations of George Romero's zombies and Danny Boyle's ""infected"" from 28 DAYS LATER.)The movie plays out in a fairly predictable fashion.  You can almost predict the order in which folks will fall victim.  You know where the next attack is coming from.  You want to yell at the characters for doing stupid things.But you are also drawn into the predicament.  Part of this is the POV technique.  It does often make you feel immersed in the action.  The sound editing is excellent as well, whether it's the frightened breathing of the cameraman, the sounds of struggles two stories below or the screams of people standing just out of view.  While we see plenty of attacks, blood, and some gore...there is also a lot that happens off-screen as well...allowing our imaginations to run wild.  For example, in one scene, an unfortunate resident comes up in an elevator.  As he prepares to step out, a ""zombie"" dog rushes at him and begins to attack.  The man falls back into the elevator and the dog follows.  The doors close, and those who try to help the man are unable to reopen them.  We hear what's happening behind the door...and I'm sure what we imagine is as savage and bloody as anything the filmmakers would show us.  It's gruesome and unsettling.Overall, the film is well-acted by a bunch of unknown performers.  Most of the performers do a good job of seeming like ordinary guys.  I'm sure much of the dialogue was partially improvised.Let me discuss ""star"" Jennifer Carpenter in particular, though.  I've read some reviews accusing her of the most atrocious overacting.  Clearly, her performance just didn't work for some folks.  For me, however, she was quite effective.  She gives a performance that towards the end is almost...well, the only word I can come up with is ""rococo.""  She plays a somewhat vapid but fairly determined reporter, eager to catch everything on film, and frankly, somewhat removed from the reality of what is happening.  Then, after a particularly scary encounter, she is struck with the realization that this is REAL, it is happening to HER and there is a very, very strong chance she will die soon.  She goes into full throttle panic.  Whimpering, jumpy in the extreme, hyper-ventilating, etc.  She shows no bravery, and comes to rely on the pool of light from the video camera as her only connection to sanity and safety.  We are not used to seeing a main character in a film lose such total control over herself.  I don't want to say it is a ""daring"" performance, but to me, it's what helped to elevate the film beyond the norm.  It does make her somewhat passive in what transpires, because she's such a quivering mound of jello...but it also struck me as somewhat believable.  She seems, frankly, properly traumatized.  And I certainly caught no whiff of giggles from a heavily teen-aged audience.  I think we all  instinctively felt that her pants-wetting terror was a very believable reaction.QUARANTINE is a ""cheapie"" genre flick...no question.  But it was made with competence, commitment and no hint of irony.  It is scary, fast-moving and involving.  It left me sweating.  If a good, scary thrill is what you're looking for...I can heartily recommend QUARANTINE.  It's nice to say that about a horror film!",4,A surprisingly effective horror flick.

1217967,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001MVYUQQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Quarantine (John Erick Dowdle, 2008)Warning: this review contains almost unavoidable spoilers. Skip it if you haven't seen this (or the original, [REC]) yet.The worst thing about Quarantine, John Erick Dowdle's remake of Jaune Balaguero's impressive thriller [REC], has nothing to with the movie itself. While I know I shouldn't judge the movie based on anything but the movie (and, as in the case of all remakes, the original), it really, really annoys me when (and I can't really call this a spoiler) the people who released the film decided to use its final shot in the trailer. Okay, maybe I wouldn't have been nearly as annoyed had I not seen Balaguero's original and known it was the final shot, but I think it's pretty obvious given that scene, and the still from it used on the poster, how this movie is going to end.  There are at least two dozen scenes from the movie that would have worked equally as well. Why blow it for your entire moviegoing audience a month before they get to see the actual movie? That said, however, Quarantine is my favorite foreign-horror remake since The Ring, simply because Dowdle knew not to mess with success; his adaptation isn't quite slavishly faithful (and, like The Ring, the one main added scene actually fits in well with the atmosphere of the rest of the flick), but it's certainly more so than even the foreign-horror remakes we've seen directed by their original directors (yes, Takashi Shimizu, I'm looking at you). And that's topped off by my continued disbelief that Balaguero, whose Darkness was such a godawful mess five or six years ago, was capable of pulling off the original as well as he did. This is a conflation of highly improbables, and they all come together to make a really, really good movie.Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) plays Angela Vidal, the host of a late-night TV show that, from what we can tell, follows people working a certain job around and shows what they do while the rest of the world is asleep. Tonight, it's firefighters, and she and her cameraman Scott (Heist's Steve Harris) get partnered with Jake (Hostel's Jay Hernandez) and George (Living Hell's Jonathon Schaech). All goes well until the firefighters answer a call to aid a sick woman in a tenement building and find the police already on the scene. No sooner do they discover the woman is a lot more than just sick than everytihng explodes outside, with cops, firefighters, and the National Guard quarantining the building, trapping Angela, Scott, Jake, a badly-wounded George, a cop (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short) who's already close to the edge, and the rest of the building's inhabitants inside with the sick woman.As is increasingly common these days, the movie is shot purely from the perspective of a single camera (think Document of the Dead, Cloverfield, etc.). It's a trick that's kind of getting old now, but when used correctly, it's still very effective. It's used correctly here. The lack of omniscient cameraman makes for a movie that's simultaneously frustrating and jump-out-of-your-seat shocking on a fairly regular basis (after about fifteen minutes of setup in and around the firehouse); you're never exactly sure what's going on, and the level of detail you do get every once in a while is just enough to keep you straining to make out more. This is bound to turn off some film viewers who are more used to having everything laid out for them, but if you don't mind filling in some blank spots yourself, you'll find a lot to like here. It's that rarest of Hollywood productions, a remake that's almost as good as the film upon which it is based. *** ",3,Surprisingly un-awful.,1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,3615,"['Quarantine', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', '2008', 'Warning', 'review', 'almost', 'unavoidable', 'spoilers', 'Skip', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', '[', 'REC', ']', 'yet.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'Quarantine', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'remake', 'Jaune', 'Balaguero', 'impressive', 'thriller', '[', 'REC', ']', 'nothing', 'movie', 'know', 'should', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'based', 'anything', 'movie', 'case', 'remakes', 'original', 'really', 'really', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'spoiler', 'people', 'who', 'released', 'film', 'decided', 'use', 'final', 'shot', 'trailer', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'annoyed', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Balaguero', 'original', 'known', 'was', 'final', 'shot', 'think', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'given', 'scene', 'still', 'used', 'poster', 'how', 'movie', 'going', 'end', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'dozen', 'scenes', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'equally', 'as', 'well', 'Why', 'blow', 'entire', 'moviegoing', 'audience', 'month', 'get', 'see', 'actual', 'movie', 'said', 'however', 'Quarantine', 'favorite', 'foreign-horror', 'remake', 'Ring', 'simply', 'Dowdle', 'knew', 'not', 'mess', 'success', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'quite', 'slavishly', 'faithful', 'Ring', 'one', 'main', 'added', 'scene', 'actually', 'well', 'atmosphere', 'rest', 'flick', 'certainly', 'more', 'so', 'even', 'foreign-horror', 'remakes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'directed', 'original', 'directors', 'yes', 'Takashi', 'Shimizu', ""'m"", 'looking', 'topped', 'off', 'continued', 'disbelief', 'Balaguero', 'Darkness', 'was', 'such', 'godawful', 'mess', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'capable', 'pulling', 'off', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'conflation', 'highly', 'improbables', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'movie.Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Dexter', 'Angela', 'Vidal', 'host', 'late-night', 'TV', 'show', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'people', 'working', 'certain', 'job', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'world', 'asleep', 'Tonight', 'firefighters', 'cameraman', 'Scott', 'Heist', 'Steve', 'Harris', 'get', 'partnered', 'Jake', 'Hostel', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'George', 'Living', 'Hell', 'Jonathon', 'Schaech', 'well', 'firefighters', 'answer', 'call', 'aid', 'sick', 'woman', 'tenement', 'building', 'find', 'police', 'already', 'scene', 'sooner', 'do', 'discover', 'woman', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'sick', 'everytihng', 'explodes', 'cops', 'firefighters', 'National', 'Guard', 'quarantining', 'building', 'trapping', 'Angela', 'Scott', 'Jake', 'badly-wounded', 'George', 'cop', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'who', 'already', 'close', 'edge', 'rest', 'building', 'inhabitants', 'sick', 'woman.As', 'increasingly', 'common', 'days', 'movie', 'shot', 'purely', 'perspective', 'single', 'camera', 'think', 'Document', 'Dead', 'Cloverfield', 'etc.', 'trick', 'kind', 'getting', 'old', 'now', 'when', 'used', 'correctly', 'still', 'very', 'effective', 'used', 'correctly', 'here', 'lack', 'omniscient', 'cameraman', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'frustrating', 'jump-out-of-your-seat', 'shocking', 'fairly', 'regular', 'basis', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'setup', 'firehouse', ""'re"", 'never', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'level', 'detail', 'do', 'get', 'once', 'while', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'straining', 'make', 'out', 'more', 'bound', 'turn', 'off', 'film', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'used', 'having', 'everything', 'laid', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'filling', 'blank', 'spots', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'here', 'rarest', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'remake', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'based', '***']",N/A

Which is a lot to tolerate in a movie that's trying to present itself as psuedo-realism.  Yes, reality can be dull and boring. But do you want to watch that in a movie?A journalist and her cameraman tail a group of firefighter's call into a apartment building.  Somethings wrong with the old lady and she attacks.  Immediately a swarm of CDC cars helicopters, etc, swarm the building and plastic wrap the whole thing.  There is a ton of random quick panic scenes.  Nothing about this is in the slightest bit believable (although they do a fair job of explaining it later).  Things go worse as this ""rabies-like"" disease takes its zombie-like effect.The main go-getter journalist character is not in the slightest believable as a journalist.  Her acting is aweful, frankly.  The rest of the cast is fairly decent.  Its to bad so much of the movie is with her instead.They do all kinds of things which are unconvincing in this movie and it takes a lot to look past its flaws.  Take, for instance, a scene which I did like where the cameraman (in his one ""on camera"" scene) kills an infected woman:  there's a nice idea for a shot where the camera is recording the bashing of the woman to death.  Its a fun idea really, getting to that realism  (what would you use for a weapon, whatever is in your hand of course!), but the camera shows this as an up and down steady and straight movement.  Even when the camera supposedly hits the woman there's no shake.  Plenty of camera shaking elsewhere in the movie why not here?  The camera pans up to look through a laughably splattered lens. Then the camera man gives us a fairly convincing weep over having killed someone.  Ok, but not great.  Like many things in this movie its just not fully realized.The movie ends when the remaining  few are up in a room where they discover what may have caused all this to happen....except for some unknown reason this part of the movie seems rushed through and not developed.To much of this movie left me unsatisfied.

There was one really good rat-stomp scene which must have made PETA members cringe and start writing letters of protest. There was LOTS of blood, guts, vomit, ect, which kept it from being any more tedious than it already was. It made good use of gravity, the ""over the balcony, three stories to the tile floor with a splat"" scenes were not too bad, they could have used more of those. And what other situation can you imagine a firefighter hacking a small girl to bits with a fire ax actually being appropriate?? I also enjoyed seeing the annoying drunk being torn to pieces in the elevator by a mad dog, he had it coming. I think that sums up the good parts.But it was not a good movie. It was not suspensful, they totally missed the point on that count. There was way too much screaming, which made it more tedious than it had to be and already was.

So I said to myself, ""why not give the original a look to see if they were on par with each other."" And [REC] was worth the look. But why do I call Quarantine a ""re-do"" instead of a ""re-make"", you ask? I'll get to that in a minute.{REC} is a very well done Spanish film by Jaume Balaguer&oacute; & Paco Plaza that kind of combines the idea of Rage virus infected maniacs from28 Days Laterwith the notion that zombies and demonic possession are nothing more than a mutated virus strain. Oh don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything here!I mean really...both movies ultimately offer no better explanation for the origin of what's going on than any of its predecessors. I'd say thatResident Evil& 28 Days Later make the best attempts to suggest origins for why ""zombies"" are walking the earth, but even those leave the door wide open to prequels or sequels that change the whole idea of ""what started it all.""So enter [REC} with a somewhat unique explanation (a la videogame-esque recording device found by the characters late in the film) of why zombies haunt this story. But before that device is found, our characters go through a Hell of being trapped in a multi-level apartment building with some pretty ghastly creatures. 99% the same story for Quarantine.The camera work in both movies is unfortunately in the same vein as some recent films that tried to present a more realistic environment with a single hand-held camera capturing all the action, a laBlair Witch,CloverfieldorDiary of the Dead. But all that the hand-held camera work really does is annoy the living dead out of ya.Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [REC], inserted American actors and released [REC} as a ""re-do"" in America under the title Quarantine. Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine is clearly just a re-do.I'd recommend catching one or the other for some good fun scares.

1217986,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B001MVYUQQ,Stuart Conover,"[1, 2]","Before I type anything else I need to put that Quarantine is a remake of the Spanish film [rec] and as amazing as this movie is - [rec] was was an even better film. The American remake was directed by John Erick Dowdle and written by both he and his brother. While the two brothers don't have a long history in film what they have shown us so far says one - watch these two. I only hope that in the future their next movie is able to match Quarantine in quality. I've heard a people complain that the remake is bad because it wasn't as good as the original film. In all honestly I have no idea where to begin to disagree with that point of view because in all honesty it still is a great film.OK. There is another complaint and I'll address that right about now. Quarantine suffers from that wonderful movie going experience known simply as ""The Shakey Cam."" We are following a news reporter who was shafted with doing a public piece on firefighters and are watching the entire film unfold point of view style through the eyes of the cameraman who is assigned to film her story. After a ridiculous interview process (that almost seems too long) the alarm goes off and our reporters go out on the call.While a fire seems like a great way for the story to progress we arrive at the scene and find absolutely nothing. After establishing that there is in fact no fire to be put out it's suddenly made clear that there is no way out of the building. While they were searching for the reason they were called in the entire building has been sealed off by ""the government"" without giving a single reason whatsoever.Suddenly they find that one of the inhabitants of the condo building they are in is sick. Not just sick but apparently delusional as they attack our news crew as well as the firefighters that they are with. It quickly becomes clear that what everyone has been locked inside with is an infection that resembles the walking (or in this case) running dead. After they realize partially what is happening the first thought is of course to try to both survive and escape as no one believes that they can be infected. The clear thought that happens in every infection movie. Escaping where the infection is won't infect others it'll keep those there at ground zero safe.I am usually the first person to argue against a remake as the vast majority fall far short of the original. This is a case where the movie is made to truly emulate the original and not try to take too many liberties. While I've stated it is not as good as [rec] if you are someone who hates subtitles or just in general want to see a decent horror film and don't have the ability to track down the movie it's based off this is a must pickup. For any who are so stuck on the original that they cannot accept the remake?

My purpose will be largely to point out distinctions in opinion.  For example, some reviewers found Jennifer Carpenter's screaming to be annoying enough to desire reaching through the television screen and choking her to death.  Some found Ms. Carpenter's acting to be insulting to females which I can understand (barely) but that type of reaction seems to take things much too seriously!  I found the screaming to be absolutely top notch and hilarious, and about as highly entertaining as humanly possible (if one can truly deem screaming an acting skill) considering the stress level guaranteed by such a (more believable than you might think) situation.  The director did a good job making this scenario appear realistic.  This is a very smile and laugh-inducing flick if you just fast forward to the scenes when a zombie face (usually a formerly cute female) is glowing scarily (white or vampire blue) in the background.

1217993,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B001MVYUQQ,Terry Mesnard,"[2, 4]","I apologize for the pun above...I couldn't resist, mostly because it's true on both accounts. Firstly, a brief history lesson. Last year, a Spanish film called [rec] came out to much acclaim in Spain. It quickly traveled most of the Western world, building fans and kudos while systematically scaring the wits out of 99% of people who saw it. Since then, it's been out everywehre in the Western world in either theatres or on DVD.Everywhere except the United States.Here, we have Hollywood with the mentality of, ""why bring over a perfectly terrifying film when we can remake it in our own language."" Consequently, we still don't have [rec] here. But we do have Quarantine. Having seen [rec] and hearing that Quarantine was practically a frame-by-frame remake in some ways, I was curious to see how it'd hold up.Things began well, with a nice set up that involved some good banter back and forth. The trip to the apartment complex and the realization that something horrible is happening works well. Sure, some scenes have been changed for added gore/shock value, but overall it was a good, if needless, remake. Unfortunately, what I like to call the ""Marilyn Burns Effect"" happens and ruins the last 1/3 of the movie. Horror aficionados will remember Marilyn as the actress in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. While many hold this film in high regards (and rightly so), Marilyn spends the last 10-20 minutes of the movie running, arms flailing and screaming her head off. Today, reviewing that film, it comes across more humorous than scary.And unfortunately, that's what happens in Quarantine. Towards the end, you just want to reach through the screen and slap the main character. I could go into a deep discussion of female hysteria in film, especially as it relates to needing a man to calm her down (usually with a slap to the face), but I won't. Needless to say, that stereotype continues in this film, complete with an unsuccessful talking down by her male camera person, and it turns into a self-parody.I usually enjoy Jennifer Carpenter; I liked her in the Exorcism of Emily Rose and the few episodes I've seen of Dexter, but she just ruins any thrills in the last third of Quarantine. This probably won't surprise anyone, but Quarantine felt like a ""hipper,"" ""more stylized"" version of [rec], minus the themes introduced at the end and without any creativity. Don't get me wrong, Quarantine isn't a horrible film. It does have a couple decent scares. The problem is that whatever it can do, [rec] can do better. The fear in [rec] is palpable simply because it is simplistic in its presentation. It's a much scarier film. [rec] is, in fact, on my short list of films that have scared me. Quarantine just doesn't cut it. My recommendation is let your wallet do the talking and skip Quarantine for the much superior and terrifying [rec].",3,Quarantine is a [rec],1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2850,"['apologize', 'pun', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'mostly', 'true', 'accounts', 'Firstly', 'brief', 'history', 'lesson', 'Last', 'year', 'Spanish', 'film', 'called', '[', 'rec', ']', 'came', 'out', 'much', 'acclaim', 'Spain', 'quickly', 'traveled', 'most', 'Western', 'world', 'building', 'fans', 'kudos', 'systematically', 'scaring', 'wits', '99', '%', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'then', 'been', 'out', 'everywehre', 'Western', 'world', 'theatres', 'DVD.Everywhere', 'United', 'States.Here', 'have', 'Hollywood', 'mentality', 'why', 'bring', 'over', 'perfectly', 'terrifying', 'film', 'when', 'can', 'remake', 'own', 'language', 'Consequently', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '[', 'rec', ']', 'here', 'do', 'have', 'Quarantine', 'Having', 'seen', '[', 'rec', ']', 'hearing', 'Quarantine', 'was', 'practically', 'frame-by-frame', 'remake', 'ways', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', ""'d"", 'hold', 'up.Things', 'began', 'well', 'nice', 'set', 'up', 'involved', 'good', 'banter', 'back', 'forth', 'trip', 'apartment', 'complex', 'realization', 'something', 'horrible', 'happening', 'works', 'well', 'Sure', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'added', 'gore/shock', 'value', 'overall', 'was', 'good', 'needless', 'remake', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'Marilyn', 'Burns', 'Effect', 'last', '1/3', 'movie', 'Horror', 'aficionados', 'will', 'remember', 'Marilyn', 'actress', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'many', 'hold', 'film', 'high', 'regards', 'rightly', 'so', 'Marilyn', 'last', '10-20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'running', 'arms', 'flailing', 'screaming', 'head', 'Today', 'reviewing', 'film', 'more', 'humorous', 'scary.And', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'Quarantine', 'end', 'just', 'want', 'reach', 'screen', 'slap', 'main', 'character', 'could', 'go', 'deep', 'discussion', 'female', 'hysteria', 'film', 'especially', 'needing', 'man', 'calm', 'down', 'usually', 'slap', 'face', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Needless', 'say', 'stereotype', 'film', 'complete', 'unsuccessful', 'talking', 'down', 'male', 'camera', 'person', 'self-parody.I', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'liked', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dexter', 'just', 'thrills', 'last', 'third', 'Quarantine', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'anyone', 'Quarantine', 'felt', 'hipper', 'more', 'stylized', 'version', '[', 'rec', ']', 'themes', 'introduced', 'end', 'creativity', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Quarantine', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'film', 'have', 'couple', 'decent', 'scares', 'problem', 'can', 'do', '[', 'rec', ']', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'fear', '[', 'rec', ']', 'palpable', 'simply', 'simplistic', 'presentation', 'much', 'scarier', 'film', '[', 'rec', ']', 'fact', 'short', 'list', 'films', 'have', 'scared', 'Quarantine', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'recommendation', 'let', 'wallet', 'do', 'talking', 'skip', 'Quarantine', 'much', 'superior', 'terrifying', '[', 'rec', ']']",N/A

This movie was sweet and in my opinion one of the best zombie movies of my time. Yeah I guess its a remake of [REC] but I didnt see that movie, I seen this one so I could care less about that. The camera work is like Blair Witch or like most recent Cloverfield and in is done very well, adding to the effect's of the movie (I loved it when the camera man got attacked by a zombie and he smashed her face in with the camera), some dont like this style of camera work or for some it makes them sick, well to bad for you then, dont watch this movie. For me it made this movie so much more better because you feel like your seeing everything through the camera mans eyes and the way the zombies come at them (like the zombies in 28 Days later or The Dawn Of The Dead Remake) makes you feel their dread. The only thing I didnt like was how stupid all the people were around theinfected, for example when they first enter the apartment complex and confront the first infected and the first police officer to confront her turns his back to her (what are we to believe these people never seen a zombie movie before???). And there are many more dumb moments throughout the movie like that, the acting to me wasnt bad and if anything Jennifer Carpenter does an excellent job at being scarred out of her mind.

1218002,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001MVYUQQ,trebe,"[1, 2]","[Rec](2007) was an award winning Spanish horror thriller with a unique perspective, as the premise was that the entire movie consisted of video shot by a television crew, as they followed the activities of a fire department unit, and are swept into a strange and horrific situation.  With a few additional elements, Quarantine (2008) is basically a remake of [REC], with the setting moved from Spain to Los Angeles, with English replacing Spanish as the spoken language.  This review with compare the two films, and will assume the reader is familiar with REC, and contain some major spoilers.  So proceed as your own risk.Quarantine does a very good job of taking [REC]'s basic ""real-time"" approach to filmmaking, and duplicating it technically.  About 10 minutes longer than [REC], Quarantine introduces some new wrinkles into the basic story, changes some names and other details, but almost all of the significant elements of REC, are included in Quarantine.  Interestingly, in the making of featurette on the DVD, those involved with Quarantine do not mention [REC] by name, or even acknowledges it as a source.  John Erick Dowdle (Devil, The Poughkeepsie Tapes) and Drew Dowdle, receive writing credit for Quarantine, which was essentially adapted almost entirely from [REC], which was co-written by Luiso Berdejo, Jaume Balaguero, and Paco Plaza.  In their commentary for the film, the Dowdle's to their best to avoid mentioning [REC].The heroine of both films is TV host named Angela Vidal, with Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) assuming the role in Quarantine, originally played by Manuela Velasco in [REC].  Accompanied by her camera operator Scott Percival (Steve Harris), Vidal is at a LA fire station shooting a piece about firemen, when a call comes in and they join the unit on a call.  They enter a three storey apartment building, and together with two policemen, break into a unit where an old woman is apparently ill.  Behaving strangely, the woman bites one of the cops in the neck.  The group retreats downstairs, and discovers that the building has been locked down, and that the authorities will use force to prevent anyone from leaving.  Trapped inside with victims of a strange disease, the survivors' numbers dwindle, and hope begins to fade.One of the most significant changes in Quarantine, involves the abandonment of a religious element, and changing the cause of the ""infection"" to something similar to rabies.  A character with veterinary training recognizes the symptoms of the disease, and later tests of brain matter are attempted.Other changes result in increasing the level of action.  A dog named Max was mentioned in [REC], as a carrier of the disease, but was never seen.  In Quarantine, Max appears as a large ferocious dog, and the film also features an elevator that was not present in [REC], where several tense scenes occur.  Another incident features camera operator Scott Percival, bashing one of the infected to death with his camera, and when a survivor opens a window and exposes himself, he is shot by a sniper.Like [REC], Quarantine starts innocuously, and then suddenly plunges into a dark world of uncertainly and immense danger.  The building becomes a prison, where those inside become infected, and join a bloodthirsty hoard.  As the intensity of the violence increases, the setting becomes darker as electrical power is cut.  Soon the light mounted to the camera, becomes the sole source of illumination.  And when that is gone, the camera's infrared viewer provides the film's final haunting images.It isn't believable that a cameraman would continue to shoot, when people are being attacked, or when he is running for his life, however when you are caught up in the panic of what seems like a real event, it becomes easier to make allowances for questionable ""reality"".  Steve Harris has a more prominent role than the camera operator in [REC], and is a more active contributor.  Angela Vidal is more assertive in Quarantine, but the character isn't as believable or convincing as in [REC].  Jennifer Carpenter no doubt studied and learned from Manuela Velasco's performance.  Her performance isn't bad, it just lacks the intensity and realism of Velasco's.With [REC] providing a terrific example, Quarantine delivers a higher level of action, and although the characters and tone are a little different, the central thrust is much the same.  While both films are very similar and worth seeing, REC would be the one to see first.  It's unfortunate that those connected with Quarantine appear to be reluctant to acknowledge the debt owed to REC.  The Dowdle's did write a sequel,Quarantine 2: Terminal(2010), which does not follow in the footsteps of [REC]'s sequel[REC] 2(2009).",4,"a solid remake of a [REC], with a few

The setting is familiar - it is about a group of people trapped in an old LA apartment building. Malevolent forces that attack them come from inside the building, not from the outside, and the terrifying consequences are told from a viewpoint of a TV reporter Angela (Jennifer Carpenter).Though the images are spooky and acting is pretty strong (with so much screaming from Jennifer Carpenter, a scream queen of the new generation), the story gets weak as the film goes on. Characters repeat the same mistakes, often so incredibly careless when they should be cautious about approaching someone who is obviously ""infected.""""Quarantine"" is a Hollywood remake of the Spanish chiller ""[REC],"" which I think is a little overrated. For me, the ""Blair Witch""-like shaky handheld camera is not the best way to scare the audiences. The first-person camera effectively provides a realistic documentary touch at first, but the narrative gimmick soon becomes artificial and tedious as in ""Cloverfield."" If you are being chased by monsters or zombies, carrying around a camera with you is the last thing you would do.For anyone who has seen the original, the new version directed by John Erick Dowdle may look like an almost exact duplicate. The new version has become longer and the setting is now in Los Angles, but what happens inside the dark apartment building remains the same. If you have seen the original Spanish film, you have seen ""Quarantine.""""Quarantine"" is not as bad as some of the negative reviews might lead you to believe. It is only that jaded horror fans, me included, are hard to be impressed.

It's one of those times where you go... ""I want the 2 hours of my life back"". It's a waste of time watching this movie unless you are into corny zombie type flicks. The plot goes: Angela is a reporter who is doing a documentary on LA firefighters in their station.... at night! When the firemen got a call, she and her faithful cameraman tagged along. So they went in this building and found an old woman salivating and acting crazy like a mad dog. She bit one guy who bit another and another and so forth and so on... so in the end they were all infected with this rabies type thing. The sad part is, while they were in the building, they couldn't go out because the CDC locked them in (for some weird reason, they came out of nowhere). If anybody tries to get out, they will get shot. So they were all locked in this building with all these rabies infected zombies. All the lights were off but somehow, the elevator was working?! It did deserve 1 star for 2-3 scenes that made me jump off my seat because the zombie came out of nowhere. The whole movie is seen through the cameraman's lens (angela's cameraman) so it really made me dizzy.

1218007,A3DJXS3PFBB48P,B001MVYUQQ,Woodlandtrails,"[3, 6]","This should have been an excellent film because viewers already know the actors are very good from watching The Practice, Dexter, and other shows.  The script portrayed the reporter, firemen, policemen and others to behave unprofessionally and sometimes in just plain foolish ways which made it hard for viewers to relate to them or the movie.Movie SpoilersSomeone is experimenting with a rabies type disease in the attic of an apartment building.  Max, a dog belonging to 5 year old, Briana, gets the disease possibly from an infected laboratory rat.  Briana's father takes the dog to the veterinarian leaving an infected Briana and her mother at the apartment.  The little girl or her dog infected an elderly woman and her dog.  The elderly woman is screaming and acting crazy so police/firemen are called to the scene taking along a reporter and her cameraman along for a story.  The city quarantines the building while everyone is in there because the Max the dog at the vet clinic attacks everyone and the dog is wearing a tag with its address on it so they know where it lived.  Police, firemen, reporters and apartment renters are trapped in the building while the city police tell outside reporters everyone has been evacuated.  There is a veterinarian in the building who says tears, saliva and fever and death occurs to anyone bitten.Pro1.  The cameraman, Scott Percival was a true professional.  He hung onto the camera through it all and even put it down still rolling at times to assist his fellow survivors when they were attacked including his reporter co-worker.  He even continuously comforts his hysterical reporter co-worker who pays him back by deserting him.2.  The last fireman Jake is also professional and courageous.  He was going to kill an infected woman when trapped in an apartment with others and another idiot prevented him from doing so.  That woman attacked them all later.  Fireman Fletcher is also a hero.3.  Firehouse mascot Wilshire the Dalmatian and his stop, drop and roll routine if caught on fire was educational and amusing.Con1.  The last policeman Danny Wilensky acts completely unprofessional.  This guy initially pulled a gun on the fireman, reporter, cameraman and renter when he finds them trying to escape.  He knows people are dying around them and if bitten, they are infected and he foolishly wants to obey the order of a superior officer who turned off the electricity to their building and lied to the city saying they were evacuated.  This policeman sees people getting bitten and sees little Briana bite her mother.  He stupidly handcuffs the infected soon to be violent mother to the staircase endangering anyone coming up and down the stairs.  Then he runs after little Briana KNOWING she is dangerous and infected and says ""take my hand"".when her mouth is bloody and she is crazed.  He had the gall to act surprised when she bit him.2.  The young professional female reporter Angela Vidal is truly pathetic.  She never helps anyone who gets attacked especially towards the end.  Yet, she expects the cameraman and the one remaining fireman to help her when she is attacked.  She screams and jumps at every sound giving away their position and clings to the men.  Her Blair Witch filming towards the end was only missing the snotty nose.  The film photo above shows 2 hands and no weapon.  She is in a lab with glass equipment, chairs, and lab chemicals and all sorts of things that can act as improvised weapons but she just whines.  It was truly disgusting for a modern professional woman to behave this way.  There was a kind of satisfaction when she didn't make it either.3.  Too cliched.  The mother over reacting to the idea that her quite clearly infected 5 year old be isolated in other room was just too cliched.  If this woman had other children, she would not have acted like this and as a mother she should have wanted to protect the other children and people in the building.  She could have stayed with her daughter in isolation.  Instead the mother fights off the others from getting to her daughter and the mother gets bitten/infected and the infected child runs off to attack/infect others later.",2,Dumb Behavior,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,4171,"['should', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'film', 'viewers', 'already', 'know', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'watching', 'Practice', 'Dexter', 'other', 'shows', 'script', 'portrayed', 'reporter', 'firemen', 'policemen', 'others', 'behave', 'unprofessionally', 'sometimes', 'just', 'plain', 'foolish', 'ways', 'made', 'hard', 'viewers', 'relate', 'movie.Movie', 'SpoilersSomeone', 'experimenting', 'rabies', 'type', 'disease', 'attic', 'apartment', 'building', 'Max', 'dog', 'belonging', '5', 'year', 'old', 'Briana', 'disease', 'possibly', 'infected', 'laboratory', 'rat', 'Briana', 'father', 'dog', 'veterinarian', 'leaving', 'infected', 'Briana', 'mother', 'apartment', 'little', 'girl', 'dog', 'infected', 'elderly', 'woman', 'dog', 'elderly', 'woman', 'screaming', 'acting', 'crazy', 'police/firemen', 'are', 'called', 'scene', 'taking', 'along', 'reporter', 'cameraman', 'story', 'city', 'building', 'everyone', 'there', 'Max', 'dog', 'vet', 'clinic', 'attacks', 'everyone', 'dog', 'wearing', 'tag', 'address', 'know', 'where', 'lived', 'Police', 'firemen', 'reporters', 'apartment', 'renters', 'are', 'trapped', 'building', 'city', 'police', 'tell', 'reporters', 'everyone', 'been', 'evacuated', 'veterinarian', 'building', 'who', 'tears', 'saliva', 'fever', 'death', 'occurs', 'anyone', 'bitten.Pro1', 'cameraman', 'Scott', 'Percival', 'was', 'true', 'professional', 'hung', 'camera', 'even', 'put', 'down', 'still', 'rolling', 'times', 'assist', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'when', 'were', 'attacked', 'including', 'reporter', 'co-worker', 'even', 'continuously', 'hysterical', 'reporter', 'co-worker', 'who', 'back', 'deserting', 'him.2', 'last', 'fireman', 'Jake', 'also', 'professional', 'courageous', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'infected', 'woman', 'when', 'trapped', 'apartment', 'others', 'idiot', 'prevented', 'doing', 'so', 'woman', 'attacked', 'later', 'Fireman', 'Fletcher', 'also', 'hero.3', 'Firehouse', 'mascot', 'Wilshire', 'Dalmatian', 'stop', 'drop', 'roll', 'routine', 'caught', 'fire', 'was', 'educational', 'amusing.Con1', 'last', 'policeman', 'Danny', 'Wilensky', 'completely', 'unprofessional', 'guy', 'initially', 'pulled', 'gun', 'fireman', 'reporter', 'cameraman', 'renter', 'when', 'trying', 'escape', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'bitten', 'are', 'infected', 'foolishly', 'obey', 'order', 'superior', 'officer', 'who', 'turned', 'off', 'electricity', 'building', 'lied', 'city', 'saying', 'were', 'evacuated', 'policeman', 'people', 'getting', 'bitten', 'little', 'Briana', 'mother', 'stupidly', 'handcuffs', 'infected', 'soon', 'be', 'violent', 'mother', 'staircase', 'endangering', 'anyone', 'coming', 'up', 'stairs', 'Then', 'little', 'Briana', 'KNOWING', 'dangerous', 'infected', 'take', 'hand', 'mouth', 'bloody', 'crazed', 'had', 'gall', 'act', 'surprised', 'when', 'bit', 'him.2', 'young', 'professional', 'female', 'reporter', 'Angela', 'Vidal', 'truly', 'pathetic', 'never', 'anyone', 'who', 'attacked', 'especially', 'end', 'cameraman', 'one', 'remaining', 'fireman', 'help', 'when', 'attacked', 'screams', 'jumps', 'sound', 'giving', 'away', 'position', 'clings', 'men', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'filming', 'end', 'was', 'only', 'missing', 'snotty', 'nose', 'film', 'photo', '2', 'hands', 'weapon', 'lab', 'glass', 'equipment', 'chairs', 'lab', 'chemicals', 'sorts', 'things', 'can', 'act', 'improvised', 'weapons', 'just', 'whines', 'was', 'truly', 'disgusting', 'modern', 'professional', 'woman', 'behave', 'way', 'was', 'kind', 'satisfaction', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'either.3', 'Too', 'cliched', 'mother', 'reacting', 'idea', 'quite', 'clearly', 'infected', '5', 'year', 'old', 'be', 'isolated', 'other', 'room', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'cliched', 'woman', 'had', 'other', 'children', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'acted', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'wanted', 'protect', 'other', 'children', 'people', 'building', 'could', 'have', 'stayed', 'daughter', 'isolation', 'Instead', 'mother', 'fights', 'others', 'getting', 'daughter', 'mother', 'bitten/infected', 'infected', 'child', 'attack/infect', 'others', 'later']",N/A
