There's actually only one episode that has a Halloween theme, but the others are fun to watch.The show focuses on a British boy and his younger sister--named Charlie and Lola--and their friends. Each cartoon teaches kids about sharing and how to deal with disappointments by looking at problems in a different way.Although the animation is relatively simple, the mixed media used to create the graphics is very clever and leads to interesting visuals.The voice actors are wonderful as the characters ""Charlie"" and his younger sister ""Lola,"" and their friends ""Marv"" and ""Lotta,"" along with other kids either at school or in the neighborhood.The DVD menus are interactive and you can choose either ""play-all"" or ""episode selection.""Nice treat for kids, and adults who enjoy cartoons.",5,*Wonderful* Children's Show!,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,890,"['CHARLIE', 'AND', 'LOLA', '9', 'WHAT', 'CAN', 'WEAR', 'HALLOWEEN', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'DVD', '9', 'different', 'episodes', 'actually', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'Halloween', 'theme', 'others', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'show', 'British', 'boy', 'younger', 'sister', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Lola', 'friends', 'cartoon', 'teaches', 'kids', 'sharing', 'how', 'deal', 'disappointments', 'looking', 'problems', 'different', 'animation', 'relatively', 'simple', 'mixed', 'media', 'used', 'create', 'graphics', 'very', 'clever', 'interesting', 'visuals.The', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'Charlie', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lola', 'friends', 'Marv', 'Lotta', 'other', 'kids', 'school', 'neighborhood.The', 'DVD', 'menus', 'are', 'interactive', 'can', 'choose', 'play-all', 'episode', 'selection', 'Nice', 'treat', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'enjoy', 'cartoons']",Charlie and Lola: Volume 9: What Can I Wear for Halloween?
