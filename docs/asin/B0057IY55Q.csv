When I first remember hearing of this series, it was one that my parents watched on TV every Sunday evening.  My brother and I were sent to bed first, though.  :&#62;(  The box and video labeling are great!  The duplication process produced a quality product.  All of the menu items work.  I just wish there were more episodes to purchase.  If there were, I would purchase them.  When I get tired of these, I will tuck the DVD away and bring it out again in six months or so.  Then I'll enjoy watching them all over again.",5,Love it but wish there were more episodes!,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,569,"['have', 'loved', 'series', 'was', 'child', 'When', 'first', 'remember', 'hearing', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'parents', 'watched', 'TV', 'Sunday', 'evening', 'brother', 'were', 'sent', 'bed', 'first', 'though', '62', 'box', 'video', 'labeling', 'are', 'great', 'duplication', 'process', 'produced', 'quality', 'product', 'menu', 'items', 'work', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'episodes', 'purchase', 'were', 'would', 'purchase', 'When', 'get', 'tired', 'will', 'tuck', 'DVD', 'away', 'bring', 'out', 'again', 'six', 'months', 'so', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'over', 'again']",N/A

This set collects 32 of the best episodes, including some of the long lost soft core X episodes like &#34;Hoss and His Favorite Horse&#34;, and puts them all in one set. Plus there is a nice little photo gallery where Ben, Hoss and the boys pose nekkid in some beefcake shots. Little Joe was aptly named! There is also a special documentary called &#34;How Ben Sowed His Wild Oats&#34; which explains how Ben had 3 sons from 3 different wives, all who ended up dying. You won't find that on any of the season box sets. I like to watch these and then go out and eat a steak dinner at Ponderosa (or Bonanza if I can find one).",4,Don't be Insensitive!

The picture is sort of grainy and it's not the original theme song which I knew beforehand.  However, for the price and it being 32 episodes, it's a great price and sort of a ""why not"" purchase.

It wasn't packaged like I thought it was going to be. The dvd's were in individual dvd slip covers and slide securely in a pocket-type square place in the dvd case.

That was helpful info, for at least they're not illegal ...  yet ... no interest in hanging onto these pebbly, edited vids that lack even the famous Bonanza theme music.Missing music and multi-generation loss were not disclosed in product packaging, so it didn't even occur to me they would lack the original music.
